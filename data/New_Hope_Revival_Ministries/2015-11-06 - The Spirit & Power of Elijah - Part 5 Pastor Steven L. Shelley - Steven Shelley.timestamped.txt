[0:37] praise the Lord this is the eagle cry
[0:39] and I'm Pastor step Shelly I thank you
[0:42] for watching this program today I pray
[0:46] that before our time is up that you will
[0:49] have experienced a word that would
[0:52] challenge you inspire you encourage you
[0:55] correct you if you need some correction
[0:57] I know I do sometime what whatever your
[1:00] needs are I'm asking that the Lord Jesus
[1:03] would come and minister to your need I
[1:06] want you to know that he is faithful and
[1:08] true uh I I came to the Lord when I was
[1:12] just a small child and uh my my
[1:15] grandmother was a woman of Faith uh my
[1:19] parents were not particularly people of
[1:21] Faith they they knew that God was real
[1:25] but had uh uh had turned my father had
[1:28] turned from the Lord my mother had never
[1:31] had a real experience with God uh a as a
[1:34] young person and so God was so faithful
[1:39] and so good to visit me in my life I I
[1:42] said it that way so you'd understand it
[1:44] wasn't the influence of my parents uh uh
[1:47] although my grandmother helped me in a
[1:49] great way it it wasn't her influence
[1:52] either that called me to the Lord he
[1:54] called me he sovereignly called me to
[1:58] serve him and uh I did so with with
[2:01] radical Faith uh I wished I could tell
[2:04] you that I've never disappointed the
[2:06] Lord and never failed him in anyway but
[2:08] that would not be honest uh I would have
[2:11] to tell you the truth I'm sure I have
[2:13] many times along the way uh I've been
[2:16] discouraged like most of you and I felt
[2:19] like giving up a time or two along the
[2:21] way but God gave me strength he wouldn't
[2:24] let me uh he gave me strength to Keep
[2:27] Holding On Through The Midnight Hour and
[2:30] uh he would meet me sometimes he didn't
[2:32] come when I wanted him to come but he
[2:34] always would come in his timing uh I
[2:38] think we underestimate sometime how long
[2:41] we can hold on and God knows better and
[2:43] he knows and he never misses an
[2:46] appointment he comes at just the right
[2:48] time to encourage us and to Lift Us my
[2:52] parents divorced when I was 5 years old
[2:55] and uh of course that changed my life
[2:57] you can you can imagine it it uh it gave
[3:00] a different direction to my life perhaps
[3:03] than the one I would have chosen if I
[3:05] would have been making the choice but in
[3:08] all of that God was good to me and when
[3:10] I was seven years old he had visited me
[3:13] already before I was seven but when I
[3:15] was 7 years old he baptized me with the
[3:19] Holy Ghost and Fire and it changed me
[3:22] forever and ever you experience the real
[3:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost and and it
[3:28] will certainly affect you it will
[3:31] certainly redirect uh everything about
[3:34] you and uh it certainly did I entered
[3:38] into public ministry right after that at
[3:41] 7 years old and as some of you know my
[3:44] testimony I started pastoring at the age
[3:46] of 17 so I've uh given my life for the
[3:50] Lord I'm not here trying to brag on my o
[3:54] on my degrees or my experience or
[3:56] anything like that I I just wanted you
[3:59] to know uh for some reason I felt like I
[4:03] should speak to somebody and I wanted
[4:05] you to know that this is uh not my
[4:08] business this is not my career this is
[4:11] my life's calling and I just feel like
[4:14] God is calling to someone out there will
[4:17] you lay down your life and surrender and
[4:20] serve the Lord maybe there's a child
[4:23] maybe there's a young person watching
[4:24] this program and God has been dealing
[4:27] with you and you think I'm just a kid
[4:29] what can I do listen remember now thy
[4:32] Creator in the days of your youth if he
[4:36] is calling you now even as a child even
[4:39] as a teen surrender yourself call on him
[4:42] Jesus have mercy on me and give me
[4:46] strength to follow you you may be a a
[4:49] man or woman of marrying age and God
[4:52] calling you surrender serve him you
[4:54] might be an elderly person already a
[4:57] senior most of your life behind you and
[5:01] the uncertainty of how much longer you
[5:04] have on this Earth and you feel like
[5:06] you've wasted your life and yet God's
[5:09] calling to you now serve him don't walk
[5:12] in shame or condemnation of the years
[5:15] that you have not served him and don't
[5:17] let that keep you from surrendering your
[5:20] life to him now go right ahead uh even
[5:23] at an elderly Place give him your life
[5:26] and see if God can't use you you've
[5:29] gained life experience I'm sure there's
[5:32] someone that you could influence that
[5:34] you could speak to and encourage along
[5:37] the way I guess what I'm trying to say
[5:39] is whoever you are under the sound of my
[5:42] voice won't you surrender and serve the
[5:45] Living God he calls to you today he's
[5:48] giving you once again another
[5:50] opportunity to say yes maybe you're a
[5:53] Christian already and yet you've just
[5:55] been getting by growing less faithful as
[5:59] the the days go by less committed we're
[6:02] talking about the spirit and power of
[6:04] Elijah and one of the things that Elijah
[6:08] the prophet did as we read about in the
[6:10] Bible he challenged normal everyday
[6:15] Christianity or we'll say religion
[6:17] because of course this was the faith
[6:19] given to Moses which we now call the
[6:22] faith of the Hebrews or or Judaism and
[6:25] they were getting slack they were they
[6:28] were certainly rejecting the Covenant
[6:30] that had been made just uh holding on to
[6:33] bael with one hand and the Living God
[6:35] with other hand and Elijah just
[6:38] challenged them and said it's time to
[6:40] make up your mind I want to I want to
[6:42] challenge you and say also make up your
[6:45] mind we are in a study here on the
[6:48] spirit and power of Elijah past present
[6:51] and future we're looking at the life of
[6:54] Elijah the prophet because we understand
[6:56] from Malachi's prophecy that that Same
[7:00] Spirit and same anointing that was on
[7:03] the life of Elijah would return to the
[7:05] Earth uh multiple times to accomplish
[7:09] the same kind of mission the reason for
[7:13] the return of that spirit is to uh
[7:16] prevent the Earth from a curse lest I
[7:20] smite the Earth with a curse and so God
[7:24] sends that Elijah Spirit to call men and
[7:27] women to repentance and it pushes that
[7:30] cursing of the earth further and further
[7:33] out into the future so I'm thankful for
[7:37] every time that the spirit and power of
[7:40] Elijah has returned to the Earth uh to
[7:44] give more grace to give an extended time
[7:48] of Mercy to an earth that really has
[7:51] deserved the curse deserve the judgments
[7:55] of God we talked about the fact that MOS
[7:58] Elijah was a man of the Wilderness we
[8:01] talked about the fact that he was not
[8:04] afraid to confront false religion or
[8:07] even just the religious complacency of
[8:10] his day number three I want you to know
[8:13] that according to the Bible Elijah
[8:16] demonstrated the raw power of God I
[8:20] wrote it down like this I don't know if
[8:22] you'll appreciate this phrase understand
[8:24] this in the Nations like we would here
[8:26] in America but I said no phone baloney
[8:30] that means he is the real deal he walked
[8:35] before God with integrity and with truth
[8:39] and I'd like to show you that in the
[8:41] newer Covenant James chap 5 verse 17 and
[8:46] 18 it says Elias that's Elijah was a man
[8:52] subject to like passions as we are and
[8:56] he prayed earnestly that it might not
[8:59] rain and it rained not on the Earth by
[9:02] the space of 3 years and 6 months that's
[9:06] a long time to be Without Rain Verse 18
[9:10] and he prayed again and the heaven gave
[9:14] rain and the Earth brought forth her
[9:17] fruit now this wasn't any ordinary man
[9:20] this was a man who knew his God knew him
[9:26] uh I think this goes beyond a knowledge
[9:28] into a knowing which is an intimate
[9:33] encounter with the Living God I want you
[9:36] to know that's what God wants to have
[9:37] with you he doesn't want to just know
[9:40] you uh through religion or you know him
[9:44] through religion he wants you to know
[9:47] him to be intimately acquainted with the
[9:51] god of the Bible who is still the Living
[9:54] God today and you can have that you can
[9:58] experience that without all the
[10:00] trappings and the tradition of religion
[10:03] you can come to God in faith and ask him
[10:07] to come into your life with fullness and
[10:11] with power and I believe that he'll hear
[10:14] your prayer I'd like to read uh James 5
[10:18] again verse 17 and I think I have uh no
[10:22] just have verse 17 here in the Amplified
[10:25] Bible and it's a version of the Bible
[10:27] that I use sometime uh because it
[10:30] amplifies the meaning of some of the
[10:32] words and and makes it uh even easier to
[10:36] get a hold of and James 5:17 in the
[10:40] Amplified version of the Bible said
[10:42] Elijah was a human being with a nature
[10:46] such as we have you know we forget that
[10:48] sometime we read about these great men
[10:51] and even women of the Bible who walked
[10:54] with God who saw such Mighty
[10:57] demonstrations of the power of God and
[11:00] yet we can't relate to them because
[11:03] they're superheroes in our mind we we
[11:06] don't see them as ordinary human beings
[11:09] like us that God chose and made them
[11:13] superordinary you know they were
[11:15] superordinary but they started out as
[11:17] common vessels surrendered God chose
[11:20] them and when when God puts himself in
[11:24] the natural it becomes Supernatural
[11:27] That's the difference between the
[11:28] natural the supernatural uh common the
[11:32] ordinary and then you put God in it and
[11:34] it becomes extraordinary so here was
[11:37] Elijah a human being with nature such as
[11:41] we have with
[11:43] feelings affections and a constitution
[11:47] like ours that word constitution means
[11:50] will he had a will just like you and I
[11:54] do and you know sometimes that will of
[11:56] ours can get us in trouble we we have to
[11:59] keep taking our will and and sliding it
[12:02] under the Altar and saying Lord not my
[12:06] will but your will be done and he goes
[12:09] on to say and he prayed earnestly for it
[12:13] not to rain and no rain fell on the
[12:16] earth for three years and 6 months
[12:19] Elijah ordinary man like passions like
[12:23] emotions like feelings just like we have
[12:26] and yet a man of Supernatural power
[12:29] because he trusted in the Living God he
[12:32] didn't have to exaggerate the Miracles
[12:35] that took place in his meeting like we
[12:37] see happening sometime in the world he
[12:40] didn't have to uh try to make it sound
[12:43] bigger than it was so that he could
[12:45] build his mailing list or expand his
[12:48] television audience he was just the real
[12:51] deal what you saw is what you got he
[12:54] knew God he knew God and he was able to
[12:58] move that hand of God with his faith and
[13:01] and I want to be that kind of man I
[13:03] don't know about you he was genuine in
[13:05] every way there was no pretense about
[13:08] him he wasn't one way around one person
[13:11] and another way I believe he was just a
[13:13] man of consistency not perfect not a
[13:17] perfect man but a surrendered man and
[13:21] this is one of the reasons why we can't
[13:23] relate sometimes to the men and women of
[13:25] the Bible again as I said a moment ago
[13:28] we we don't see them as but that's why
[13:31] God lets a David be there my David was
[13:36] the apple of God's eye he was a a man
[13:39] beloved of God he failed God committed
[13:43] adultery then ended up committing murder
[13:45] to cover up his adultery and God didn't
[13:48] throw him out and and banish him to
[13:51] predition instead he made a way he sent
[13:55] a messenger he sent a prophet to correct
[13:57] his path and David learned the way back
[14:01] to God I want you to know if you've once
[14:03] known the Lord and walked in Intimate
[14:06] fellowship with him and you have fallen
[14:09] by the wayside and you think I could
[14:11] never get back to God I could never be
[14:14] where I was just as David look at the
[14:18] word of God concerning the life of the
[14:21] great King David hear him pouring out
[14:23] his heart of repentance before the Lord
[14:26] create in me a clean heart heart oh God
[14:30] renew a right Spirit Within Me Purge me
[14:35] cleanse me this was the rep uh the
[14:38] prayer of repentance that David prayed
[14:41] God must have heard him because he
[14:43] wasn't finished with David he continued
[14:46] to use him of course because of David's
[14:50] sins there are penalties he was not able
[14:54] to do all that was in his heart some of
[14:57] that Destiny passed down to the Next
[15:00] Generation in his line but you know what
[15:03] David said I I may not be able to
[15:06] physically be the one to build the
[15:08] temple of God the house of God but I can
[15:12] make it easier for the next generation
[15:15] and he began to gather the materials
[15:18] even though God said I'm not your hands
[15:20] are bloody David and I'm not going to
[15:22] let you build my house David could have
[15:24] gotten his feelings hurt over that but
[15:27] instead he said that's all right
[15:29] I I trust the Living God but I tell you
[15:31] what I'll do I'll gather the material
[15:34] I'll begin to get things in order so
[15:36] that when this next Generation comes on
[15:38] the scene uh he will be able to raise up
[15:42] the house of God without the bloody
[15:44] hands that I've had I love that about
[15:47] the character of David so you start
[15:49] looking through the Bible uh if you're
[15:52] focusing on the Miracles you'll see
[15:54] these Great Men of Might and power but
[15:57] if you want to look for a moment at the
[15:59] humanity this Bible is full of cracked
[16:04] Humanity flawed humanity and God didn't
[16:07] say there's nobody I can trust in the
[16:10] earth he took those moldable men and
[16:13] women that's the key that's the key when
[16:16] you can't be perfect be moldable be
[16:19] somebody God can deal with be someone
[16:22] who has a an ear to hear the correction
[16:25] of the Lord you know the Bible said that
[16:27] those who God loves he will chastise
[16:31] them he will punish them sometime uh I'm
[16:34] a father I have four wonderful children
[16:37] that I love with all my heart and a
[16:39] beautiful wife and we're so thankful for
[16:41] the children that God has given us but
[16:44] they disappoint us sometimes they don't
[16:46] do what we've asked them to do or what
[16:48] we expect of them and sometimes we have
[16:51] to bring discipline to their life but we
[16:53] don't stop loving them oh No in fact
[16:56] sometime you love them more because you
[16:59] know they need a little more love they
[17:01] need a little more physical connection
[17:04] to you and so you just draw them in a
[17:06] little bit closer you better not let
[17:09] them get away with it you better teach
[17:12] them as early as you can there are
[17:14] consequences for bad decisions there are
[17:17] consequences in life if you don't do the
[17:20] right thing but as a parent we don't
[17:23] love them any less we just believe that
[17:27] if we keep helping to shape them and
[17:30] point them in the right direction that
[17:32] they're going to do what's right the
[17:33] Bible tells us that that we should raise
[17:36] our children teach them the right way
[17:39] and when they're old they'll not depart
[17:41] from it that's a promise if you look at
[17:43] that in the original language it says
[17:45] that we should train up a child in the
[17:47] way he should go and while he is growing
[17:50] old he will not depart that means there
[17:54] will come a time of deep reflection in
[17:57] that life that boy or that girl that man
[18:00] that woman and during that time of deep
[18:03] contemplation they will remember praise
[18:06] God the way they were taught and the way
[18:08] they were raised and they'll have
[18:09] another opportunity to come and renew
[18:11] thems back to God but if you've been one
[18:14] that has failed the Lord he didn't love
[18:17] you less he didn't he didn't throw you
[18:20] away he just kept moving and working if
[18:23] you'll let him and if you've shut him
[18:25] out of your life because of your shame I
[18:28] encourage you right now open up the door
[18:30] again don't you shut out the one who
[18:33] gave himself for you just say Lord I
[18:35] really messed up I really failed you
[18:38] again but I plead with your mercy I come
[18:41] right back to you through Jesus and I
[18:44] ask that you will redeem me and restore
[18:48] me uh use me again for the kingdom you
[18:51] know I don't want to just be saved on a
[18:53] shelf I want to be redeemed and in the
[18:56] service of the Lord this Elijah he had
[19:00] all the Temptations that anyone else
[19:02] would have and yet he remained genuine
[19:05] to the Lord we saw right here that he
[19:07] had power to shut up the Heavens that
[19:10] they reain not open the Earth uh or to
[19:13] open the heavens so that it rain not
[19:14] upon the earth when we look in the Book
[19:17] of Revelation concerning that last
[19:20] individual who will operate in the
[19:22] spirit and power of Elijah we find out
[19:24] that he will also have the power to shut
[19:27] the heavens and the Earth so so I think
[19:29] we could say that any person any
[19:32] individual or any corporate body that
[19:35] operated in the spirit and power of
[19:37] Elijah they would have uh a real
[19:41] authority to do the work of God and
[19:44] sometimes that Authority would even uh
[19:47] give them uh the ability to shift things
[19:51] in nature if they needed to be shift to
[19:54] speak to the storm if the storm was
[19:57] hindering the plan of God the authority
[19:59] to speak to the storm Jesus did speak to
[20:03] that storm and the storm went on its way
[20:06] or perhaps speak to that tumor in the
[20:09] mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[20:12] watch it disappear let me tell you
[20:13] something the supernatural God we serve
[20:16] has power over nature he created nature
[20:19] and his laws supersede the laws that he
[20:22] established in nature in other words the
[20:24] Supernatural is over the natural every
[20:28] time and so in the natural there are
[20:30] certain things that happen uh in the
[20:32] natural someone gets cancer and if they
[20:34] don't get treatment or healing it just
[20:36] keeps working and working and working
[20:38] until it brings death but by the power
[20:40] of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the
[20:43] atonement uh uh the suffering of of his
[20:46] death and the blood that was shed for
[20:49] our salvation and for our healing by
[20:52] that we can know healing for cancer we
[20:55] can see healing in that area I've
[20:58] watched God heal cancer multiple times
[21:02] he is more than able to unstop deaf ears
[21:06] to open blinded eyes he can heal the
[21:09] dreaded plague of AIDS whatever the
[21:12] condition is he has power to heal and
[21:16] power to save and how we need a company
[21:19] of men and women right now in the earth
[21:21] we certainly do that would go forth in
[21:24] that power and authority of the Lord
[21:26] Jesus Christ to deal with some things
[21:30] that need to be dealt with I I think you
[21:33] could probably say Amen to that Elijah
[21:36] also learned to discern that even the
[21:39] smallest sign could be speaking of a
[21:43] tremendous outpouring for instance
[21:45] remember when that when it came to the
[21:48] the cloud about the size of a man's hand
[21:51] and uh the servant that's all he could
[21:53] see was this tiny little Cloud but but
[21:55] what was the prophecy that was released
[21:58] the prophecy was that there was about to
[22:00] be an abundance of rain and so part of
[22:04] that Elijah uh anointing is the ability
[22:09] to watch for even the smallest sign that
[22:13] God sends and attach a greater
[22:16] significance to that than what ordinary
[22:19] men would in other words we want to
[22:22] celebrate even the smallest
[22:24] demonstration of God's power in our life
[22:27] if if he moves even in the smallest way
[22:31] I've seen God do amazing outstanding
[22:34] things uh bigger than the mind can
[22:38] nearly fathom but I want to thank him
[22:40] for the little Graces that he gives I
[22:43] want to thank him for every time I've
[22:45] called on him and he's moved a headache
[22:48] you know I know he can heal cancer but I
[22:50] want to thank him for the times that
[22:53] that that I had stomach pain and I said
[22:55] father I need you to come and move that
[22:58] to heal me and he did and and so there
[23:01] are times when when we start out to obey
[23:05] God and the results that we're after we
[23:07] don't see them maybe you're a pastor or
[23:11] a leader of a Ministry and and it seems
[23:14] like it's so small and so
[23:17] insignificant and will never be what you
[23:19] would like to see it I want you to know
[23:21] God is in even the smallest things and
[23:25] you need to be able to to see
[23:29] uh even even the uh I I I started to say
[23:33] the the the manger the birth uh that was
[23:37] the beginning of his ministry but there
[23:39] was much more than just the manger uh
[23:42] there was the whole demonstration of his
[23:45] Healing Ministry and then ultimately the
[23:48] greatest part of his ministry was that
[23:51] he laid down his life and he didn't stay
[23:54] there he came back in resurrection power
[23:56] what you're doing right now that looks
[23:58] so small and insignificant that may be
[24:01] the manger of your ministry this the
[24:04] cloud about the size of a man's hand but
[24:07] I want to ask the Lord to give you
[24:08] discernment to be able to look at that
[24:10] small beginning and not despise it don't
[24:13] despise the day of small things little
[24:16] is much when God is in it and I believe
[24:19] Elijah had a revelation of that he said
[24:22] we better go tell Ahab there there's an
[24:24] abundance of rain about to come and his
[24:26] servants probably thinking what what are
[24:28] you talking about there's just a little
[24:30] small Cloud floating by but he saw the
[24:33] bigger potential of what God was about
[24:36] to do and also Elijah was the prophet of
[24:39] fire we talked about that a broadcast or
[24:42] two back where he called on the fire of
[24:45] God a with a 63w prayer and the Lord
[24:49] heard that prayer and answered by fire
[24:52] when we think about fire we often think
[24:55] about judgment and this is one form that
[24:58] the fire of God can take to fall to
[25:01] bring some judgment but I want you to
[25:03] know that the fire of God also speaks of
[25:08] a baptism of purification that's coming
[25:11] for the last day bride oh fire of God
[25:15] burn in our hearts burn out the chaff
[25:18] sort out the dross in us so that we can
[25:22] be
[25:24] refined like the Refiner's Fire and the
[25:27] Fuller's Soap that the Bible talks about
[25:30] nobody likes the fiery trials when
[25:32] you're right in the middle of them but
[25:34] oh when they have finished their work
[25:37] and they take that that mixed ore that's
[25:40] full of uh uh of all kinds of different
[25:44] elements and minerals and it looks like
[25:47] a a hodgepodge of nothing but when it
[25:50] goes through the fire then it melts down
[25:54] and it can be separated you can take out
[25:57] the iron oil
[25:58] you can take out all the other minerals
[26:00] and ore and separate it from the pure
[26:03] gold and what you have then left is the
[26:07] ability to remove the most valuable of
[26:10] all that stuff and bring forth gold and
[26:13] that's what God desires to do in your
[26:15] life to bring forth pure gold out of the
[26:18] midst of your trials out of the midst of
[26:21] your hardship he is refining you to
[26:24] bring you forth as a vessel of Honor
[26:28] that can Shine for the for the Master's
[26:31] cause uh there are all kinds of vessels
[26:34] in the Master's use some are common
[26:37] vessels of of of stone and and and so
[26:40] forth but there are vessels unto gold
[26:43] and I believe I'm speaking right now to
[26:46] vessels unto gold God is doing a work in
[26:49] your life don't resist the father but
[26:52] surrender to him right now father I ask
[26:55] for Grace Grace Grace for my friends and
[26:58] neighbors to surrender to the fire of
[27:02] refinement come into their lives by the
