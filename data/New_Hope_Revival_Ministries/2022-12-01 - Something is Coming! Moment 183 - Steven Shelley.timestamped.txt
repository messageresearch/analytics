[0:00] [Music]
[0:00] the impossibility that has held back the
[0:03] potential in your life and your walk
[0:05] with God it's about to become possible
[0:07] if you will step up and take what's
[0:10] yours
[0:12] [Music]
[0:19] it's no big prophetic thing to say
[0:22] change is on the way because change is
[0:25] always
[0:26] on the way
[0:28] God is not satisfied leaving us the way
[0:31] we he found us
[0:34] very little stays the same in this life
[0:38] it's not necessarily change that we
[0:41] don't like
[0:42] in fact some of us often cry out to God
[0:45] for change let me see your hand
[0:48] if you find yourself crying out to God
[0:50] for change so it's not change that you
[0:54] fear
[0:55] most of the time it's a dread and a fear
[0:59] of the unknown
[1:01] leaving behind the familiar
[1:05] can stress us
[1:08] not knowing what the next season will
[1:11] look like and how change will affect our
[1:14] lives our families our homes our jobs
[1:18] but I want to tell you in the name of
[1:19] the Lord the season that you are in
[1:22] right now is about to change
[1:25] [Music]
[1:27] incorporately but if you dare have faith
[1:31] you can change your personal season as
[1:34] well
[1:35] something's coming
[1:37] something we've been waiting on a long
[1:40] time something we've been praying for
[1:43] something that was prophesied a
[1:45] generation ago and you better be ready
[1:50] when it gets here something you're
[1:53] trying to do before but couldn't do in
[1:55] your own power something that you've
[1:56] been racking your brain over something
[1:58] that you've been praying about a wall
[2:00] that you couldn't get over in the past a
[2:03] situation that you've not been able to
[2:04] change no matter how hard you've tried
[2:07] the problem that just won't go away
[2:12] the impossibility that has held back the
[2:14] potential in your life and your walk
[2:16] with God it's about to become possible
[2:19] if you will step up and take what's
[2:22] yours
[2:23] it's a new season
[2:26] maybe you've been trying to get a suntan
[2:30] in the midst of winter
[2:33] maybe you've been trying to shovel snow
[2:36] in the middle of the summer
[2:39] then you're in the wrong season you've
[2:41] been working too hard at something that
[2:42] wasn't in God's timing maybe you're
[2:45] doing the right labor but in the wrong
[2:47] season you must stay in step with the
[2:50] Holy Ghost you must stay in step with
[2:53] the word you must stay in step with the
[2:56] spirit the spirit will keep you in the
[2:58] right season of the Lord
[3:01] no wonder we get discouraged when we're
[3:03] working so hard but we see such little
[3:05] result if you are doing all you know to
[3:08] do
[3:09] and you are seeing no fruit
[3:15] there is a reason for that
[3:19] you need to now ask yourself am I doing
[3:22] all the right things
[3:25] but in the wrong season
[3:28] because if you'll just wait for the
[3:29] season to change
[3:31] and go right back into doing all the
[3:33] right things that you know to do in the
[3:35] right season God will give you the
[3:37] Harvest that you're after
