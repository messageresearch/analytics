Description:
The Spirit of Adoption, the Spirit of Life and Truth is a relationship of intimacy much much higher than any relationship we know here on earth.  In this revelation of intimacy when His divine Spirit has joined itself with our once fallen human spirit,  we come to a revelation that He loves us so much, that His heart delights when we come to Him from the depth of our inner being, and we love Him like ‘Abba Father’.
TRANSCRIPT
========================================
i believe with everything that's within me that there will be accelerated maturity in the last of the last days [Music] this is the lord praying this is jesus communicating with the eternal spirit of the father that was within him and he didn't say in that moment of great testing and agony our father he didn't even pray god of the whole universe if you know anything about jewish prayer you know that almost all jewish prayer begins by acknowledging god as as ha holam the god of the universe the universe the god of the whole universe but this is the word made flesh and he is communicating in intimacy with the father that lived within him he didn't say our father he didn't say god of all creation he didn't say god of the whole earth or the whole universe he said my father my papa my daddy all things are possible with thee take away this cup from me nevertheless not what i will but what thou wilt folks if we're not uh developing a relationship of intimacy like that with our lord we are missing out on what the spirit of adoption has come to do inside of us he's bringing us to a mature place he's placing us as a son and one of the greatest strengths of a mature son is knowing where he stands you see that means he recognizes where he has been placed and when we recognize where we have been placed we have to recognize who placed us there amen and then we begin to yield to all that god has promised to do in us and for us and because of the spirit of adoption the spirit of life and the spirit of truth i can yield myself to a relationship of intimacy that it's really still much much higher than any relationship we know here on the earth but we we can come in a familiar way not in a dishonoring way and not in a in a false sense of familiarity but rather in a revelation that he loves us so much he is a lot less easily offended with us as than we think he knows us already he knows what to expect out of us and so i think his heart delights when we can come to him from the depth of our inner being and we can love him like abba father his divine spirit has joined itself with our once fallen human spirit and that holy spirit cries out in the spirit man cries out for the more for the more for the more to be had that spirit within you will cause you to be grateful for the first fruits it'll cause you to be grateful for the earnest of what god has deposited in your life but that same holy spirit will cry out for the full manifestation for the full and complete adoption and we believe i believe with everything that's within me that there will be accelerated maturity in the last of the last days it will not be wisdom gained from years of experience but it will be wisdom given as a gift from almighty god maturity that not only comes from experiencing life but a maturity that comes as a gift from god to the believer how by the spirit of adoption
