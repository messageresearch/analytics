========================================

Description:
There is a declaration John made and we do well when we apply it to our lives daily.  “I must decrease so He can increase” should be our daily prayer and worship.

Each time we press into worship in high praise to God, we attain a higher level. By His grace we never come back down to the same level. These temporary raptures bring us to a higher level of worship, praise, and revelation in our walk with Him, so we can come to the place of such yieldedness, where the molecules of our body speed up, and we reach into a dimension in the Spirit where this earth will no longer hold us.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the object friend of a believer the object of a believer is to become one hundred percent yielded to the Holy Spirit and as we come closer and closer to the coming of the Lord and we're laying off more of us more of us remember John said I must decrease so he can increase that ought to be a statement that we're constantly saying about our own selves I've got to decrease there has got to be less of me and more of him because when there's less of me and I'm depending more and more and more on the spirit of God that dwells in me then I am getting myself more and more ready for a translation these temporary raptures that we have like we had this morning as we were in worship and there was a high praise would go these are temporary raptures and then we come back down but we don't ever want to come back down to where we started we go up and we come back down but we're higher then God can speak to us on that level and we get in the next time and we press in and we praise and we let God deal with our heart and we Rapture again to maybe a higher level and then we come back down but by God's grace never to that level that we started out at because the spirit of God is taking us higher and higher this is where we we talk about uh we're going to speed up and they're going to slow down and we're going to meet in the middle the molecules of our body we're taking on another dimension in the spirit because this Earth is not going to hold us so we become more and more yielded to the Holy Spirit allowing him to be fully in us because we can do nothing of ourself because if if we try to do it of ourself that's what we get self exactly we end up with self
