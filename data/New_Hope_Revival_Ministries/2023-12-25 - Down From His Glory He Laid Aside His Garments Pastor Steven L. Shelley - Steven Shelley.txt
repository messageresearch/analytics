waiting on us hallelujah hallelujah isn't he good now don't you go quiet now you may be seated it's good to see you in the house of the Lord and our hearts and our prayers are going up for those who are unable to be with us uh sister uh Gertrude is still getting her strength and sister ter is with her and Maya is away and uh so we want to hold them up to the Lord in prayer and as I was sitting there more needs started coming to my mind aren't you glad that when we can't remember them all we can bundle them up I don't know how many times I've had to bundle them up and lay them at the feet of the Lord Jesus Christ we have so much to be thankful for in this hour and uh I'm not going to try to sing but uh I have a song but it's one of the most difficult it's a pretty difficult song so I'm not will try and sister Laurel is thanking me so she's going to buy my lunch one day for not doing that okay give them a hand clap aren't we blessed aren't we blessed praise God uh Ben is is streaming and uh Ben Ellsworth and he just sent a note I don't know if he cares for me reading it out loud or not too bad he's not here to stop me is he he said I wanted to be in church so bad this morning so very thankful for the stream but it's just not the same I just do not understand how people can stay home and stream when they could be at church isn't that a good testimony there's nothing like the atmosphere we need that now we try you know if we're streaming we try to make an atmosphere we we stream other services other churches and we get blessed and we stream special me meetings of different places and and we try to get blessed it's a little hard to do this time of year but we soon as this stuff is over I just can't I'm sorry you just have to forgive me I cannot stand I just can't sit and and watch message Believers sing and Christ is born on Christmas morning I I don't know how they can sing that in their churches when they know they know that's not the truth they know that wasn't born on December 25th and how could they sing that and expect people to be ble blessed pick another one you know there's other ones uh I like to sing oh come let us adore him because I sing that all year I sing that all over my house oh come let us adore him for he alone is worthy Hallelujah the lamb is worthy worthy worthy worthy but I just can't sing something like that for Christ is born on Christmas morning I even sometime along about July or August I I start singing when it's so hot you can't hardly stand it I start singing sometime Joy to the world Amen the truth is he was born folks and if he hadn't been born he couldn't have died hallelujah thank God that he did so that's kind of what I'm going to preach on today I know you're expecting my annual Christmas message and uh I don't want to disappoint you and uh so I'll give you my annual message in just a moment but uh I I want to read you this before I do you got this in your text but I want to read one quote and I didn't give it to them it's from the message s we would see Jesus is that your desire My Desire is to see him I want to see him in my home I want to see him in my family I want to see him in my own life I want to know he's there I want to see it in in my brothers and sisters I I'm not interested in in uh someone showing off how much they know or how much they've learned how many articles they've read uh people all the time will say I read an article well that don't make it so just because you read somebody wrote it don't mean it's the truth how many of you know that you you've got to take it to the word it's got to go back to that word of God and if it doesn't line up with the word I don't I don't care how good it sounds how educated it sounds I just really don't want any part of it but uh let me read this to you just this one quote from from s we would see Jesus paragraph 135 he said that's the message I was looking up there but I didn't give it to them that's the message to get to people not a cradle not a Manger Christmas is not mentioned in the entire book of the Bibles never one time did Jesus refer them to his birth but to his death so my annual Christmas message is about his death always because we know that he was born and we thank God that he was born but he didn't say remember my birthday he said remember my death this is what we have to keep before the people because it's possible to put him in a Manger this church age you know the yanes I don't know if if uh Sister Geraldine wrote it or brother Leno wrote it I'm not sure who wrote it but the yanes sang a song for years it said they've got him back in the manger again this church World they've put him back in a Manger because it's easier for them to deal with a little innocent baby in the manger but you know he'll never be that again the next time he comes he won't come like a little Meek mild lamb in a Manger he'll come as a a lion of the tribe of Judah he he'll come with a roar he'll come to deliver his people and he'll come to execute Justice and judgment on the earth so I want you to look to that one I want you to see uh of course the lamb and the lion I want you to know that the lamb has become a lion there's no doubt about that do you believe it let's stand let's just get at it no need for any more uh formalities here uh I looked real quick I didn't have a lot of extra time this morning um I left the house 5 minutes late and um when I got here I had to uh record a video greeting for the convention this morning in uh Nuru Kenya and uh my heart is there and I'm so thankful for what God is doing among those precious people I've been able to catch some of it online and uh they are blessed they didn't need me they're blessed with amazing anointed preachers and and glorious work worship but I needed them I would have loved to have been there but it wasn't the mind of God for this season so they asked me to send a greeting this morning and I was doing that and I didn't have a lot of time to check the birthday so the only one I saw I may have missed somebody you speak it out or tell on somebody if you need to next Saturday is Zachary ellsworth's birthday December the 30th and so we wish him a happy birthday he's just got off the the platform but we wish him a happy birthday is there another birthday this week that we should mention or an anniversary or anything like that all right so let's go right to the Lord that's they say that's terrible you'll mention zachar but won't talk about Jesus's I just did I just did John Chapter 13 if I were to take a subject today I would call this down from his glory he laid aside his garments all right John 13 beginning in verse one one now there now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own which were in the world he loved them unto the end you believe that and supper being ended not breakfast brother brandham used to say it wasn't the Lord's breakfast it wasn't his lunch it was supper and supper being ended the devil having now put it into the heart of Judas ascarot Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he was come from God and went to God he really didn't have to worry too much he knew where he come from and he knew where he was about to go he riseth this is Jesus riseth from supper and laid aside his garments he took off his outer tunic and he only had on then underneath a light cotton or linen garment and that inner garment would have been just above the knee most likely the outer tunic would have been longer and and more modest but he is with his disciples he's not in public he's with his disciples and he riseth from supper he laid aside his outer garments and he took a towel and wrapped it around himself girded himself it says in King James after that he porth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel where was wherewith he was girded do you see that can you picture that in your mind our Lord our Lord our conquering King nothing was made without him everything that was made was made by him and yet he has bowed down taken off his his uh robe that that protected his modesty and he has knelt down with a towel wrapped around his waist and he is washing the dirty disciples feet I should say the disciples Dirty Feet you got to watch where you put those things right uh and then and then he dries them with a towel that he's tied around his waist then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter saith unto him Lord Dost thou wash my feet and Jesus answered and said unto him now none of us are surprised at Peter are we we would expect as much out of Peter Jesus answered and said unto him what I do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know hereafter just bear with me Peter you may not understand it all now but you're going to understand it shortly and Peter saith unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet now Peter wasn't speaking to him in Rebellion he was speaking to him in loyalty and honor and respect I need to be the one if we can turn this thing around and let me wash your feet but I'll never let you wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me I want you to know the gentle rebuke of the master changed Peter's Outlook how many of you know it changed him and Simon Peter saith unto him Lord if that be the case if I can't have any part of you unless you wash my feet I would just appreciate you washing not just my feet only but wash my hands and my head what is Peter saying he's saiding just wash all of me I don't even like me Peter saying I don't even like me I don't even like who I am cleanse me from the top of my head right down to the bottom of my dirty feet this wasn't water that was going to do the job there was something coming greater than water what water can do what soap and water can do there is a blood how many of you know there is a blood that can do more water you can get dirty again you that have toddlers know you wash them clean them hose them down whatever you do and in a few minutes they're dirtier than they were to start with but I want you to know there is a blood that cleanses us so thoroughly so thoroughly so completely so totally that we don't ever have to be dirty in his side again All of Me Lord let's go on Jesus saith to him he that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet but it clean every is clean everywhere and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he ye are not all clean you may let me wash your feet but there's something staining somebody that can't be washed off with this water dried with a towel so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know ye what I have done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am few more verses if I then your Lord and Master hath washed your feet ye all also ought to wash one another's feet what an example are you with me this morning for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you it's so much deeper than just washing one another's feet I believe in foot washing and and I'm not even a Free Will Baptist but I believe in foot washing but I don't believe that's all he was talking about here I believe he was talking about the action of Grace and I believe he was talking about the action of forgiveness and I was I believe that he was saying we ought to learn how to show Grace to one another and we ought to learn how to cover iniquity with love because the blood does the work come on and if you have an opportunity to cover someone's nakedness or expose it Jesus is saying I would prefer you learn the lesson to cover it because my blood deals with every bit of that stuff did I miss did I did anyone misunderstand what I'm saying it's a respect that they showed to a drunken Noah instead of just standing there and gazing on his Humanity somebody decided to turn their back and show some respect and the bride if we're going to operate in perfect love we're not going to cover each other's sins in such a way that people are allowed to continue in their sin but we're not going to hold people to an accountability that we don't hold ourselves to how many of you understand that a lot of people are more worried about somebody else's sin they're real hard on somebody else's sin while they hold on to their own that's not how the bride's going to operate that may be how the church has operated but that's not how the bride Kingdom operates how many of you have been transferred from a church age to a kingdom a bright age verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things Jesus was talking some deep talk here yes sir that was much Beyond just washing one another's feet in some sort of a ceremony do you believe that it was yes do you believe that we should do it at to one another in a physical absolutely but if you never did it in the physical if you never had opportunity to do that again in the physical you have a chance to do that every day in your own life by letting people go by letting people go what do you mean by forgiving people not binding people to ourselves in unforgiveness forgive them well they didn't ask for forgiveness who cares it's not for him it's for you to get free how many of you don't want I don't want to stand in the last day and realize that broken chains have bound me if God breaks the chains step out of them get away from them little bride you're free father we thank you that you are alive in this house and you are alive in our hearts bless now our time together we pray in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and for his glory and the Saints said you may be seated I'll just mention I see here where brother Ryder has asked us to remember him he's fighting the flu in South Africa and I see where brother Trey and sister Autumn are not able to be here today but would of course we want to lift them up to the Lord in prayer and I see others that are joining us down from his glory Jesus laid aside his garments in John 13 4 that I just read in the complete Jewish Bible it says so he rose from the table removed his outer garments and wrapped a towel around his waist now when we see that towel around his waist it might remind us of a of a waiter's apron and and and that is wrapped around him to to uh to protect his unifor form but but it's also there to identify him so that you'll know he's there to do a job he's there to clean the table perhap maybe it's a a bus boy who is dressed like that so this was to do this in in what we call Middle Eastern culture but but historically it would be called uh far east or NE East culture in order for this to take place this is a real condescension you know we've heard from the scripture and from the message of the hour that because of the of the dirty roads and because of the terrain and because of the condition of the roads in that day Rome had not built all the roads yet they were rebuilding a lot of roads but they hadn't some of these were donkey trails and they got dirty and you'll read in a moment when I share with you something that brother random said there there there was manure I hope I don't nauseate you there was manure that had squeezed up between their toes when you went to a a a guest as a guest to someone's home and now it it's a at least a Canadian uh culture and and maybe maybe we have adopted that sum in the South that we take off our shoes when we go into somebody's house and we do that because uh we don't want to get their floors dirty with with dirt or debris or something on our shoes it was the opposite in the Bible that you didn't you weren't expected to take off your shoes because your shoes were dirty you had sandals on and so your feet were dirty anyway because the sandals are open with straps on top and on the ankle if you've seen the the shoes that they were beginning to wear in second temple period that were influenced by the Romans the the sandal of the second temple was a slip on but when the Romans came they started tying long straps around you've seen those Centurion type sandals that people even wear today you you start walking out those dirty roads with that kind of a footwear on and your feet are going to get dirty they're going to get smelly they're really really going to need to be cleansed because if you were invited to a place of esteem A A Home of esteem it was the rugs that they wanted to protect because these were handwoven rugs you go to Jerusalem you'll see them today in the in the old city and they're selling them and they come from the Orient and I find them to be extra beautiful some of them in in Vivid colors and they are they are durable but they're valuable and these rugs if they're real they are passed down from generation to generation to generation and they are to be long lasting so to keep them clean is it's a good step you can't keep from stepping on them but you can keep from stepping on them with dirty feet so brother random tells us that in this story in the Bible when a party was given and the guests were come then the Servants of the of the host would meet the guest at the door and they would they would uh help them assist them in taking off their sandals and they would take them over to a little place near the door and they would wash their feet and this was a real welcome it was oh my it was like saying uh uh my casa is your casa my house is your house you are welcome here but but not your dirty feet you get it I got carpets I got rugs so we're going to wash your feet and we're going to anoint your head and we're going to make you feel welcome but but Jesus was invited to the party remember and he didn't get the same Tru treatment that everybody else got but God wasn't going to allow him to go unwelcomed there was a woman who had needed him there was a woman who had needed his forgiveness and needed what he represented and she barged her way in and Uninvited Guest and she made sure that even though the host didn't take time I wonder how many church services this morning Jesus is invited to and implored to but then sat down on a stool in the corner with no one to worship him with no one to praise Him liturgy takes the place of praise and worship form and tradition takes the place of praise and worship we not only want him to come when we come but we want to thoroughly welcome him in our midst we want to see that his head is Anointed we want to see that his feet are washed and he is made to feel like we want him because we do love him and we do want him in the midst are you with me so back to John supper was ended supper is a time of self-gratification you're feeding the body a supper was a was a meal of Delicacies in that part of the world and uh the best food was saved for the evening meal and it was it was taken in courses and it was a long Affair so long that the custom was to recline while you're eating wouldn't you be kind of shocked if you invited somebody to your house and and they said can I pull the couch up here to the table and lay down while I eat but it was believed in that time that it was good for digestion to sort of sit in a in a halfway recline position so you you didn't have to be in a hurry you were already just kind of relaxed in your in your posture and you're just eating the Delicacies that have been saved been too too nice to to eat at breakfast or or lunch but but these were supper Delicacies so it was a time of self-gratification it was a time of enjoyment it was also time for the host to show off his wealth so if he was poor he offered uh what he had lentils uh cooked in some way maybe with a little lamb fat to give them a little bit of flavor but if he was a wealthier man he may have offered what we now call fogra he might might have given Goose liver or the liver of a of another kind of bird a duck or something like that these Delicacies were eaten in second temple period in the time of the Bible so uh if you were in a place of any esteem at all you had eaten well you had relaxed you had been given the best wine you had been given the best bread and the time of me was coming to an end the the Bible is clear when it tells us from the Greek into English supper being ended he's telling us it's no longer about each guest it's no longer about uh uh feeding the flesh something else is about to happen and so it goes on you you have to know sometime when your bless me period has ended you see people talk about the altar as though it was a place to come and get a blessing but really biblically the altar was never a place to come and get a blessing was it it was a it was a place to come and die so if you want a blessing you got to come and be willing to die there comes a time that it can't be about feeling it can't be about uh you know unction it can't be about Goosebumps there's a time that only faith can sustain us and that's the hour we're living in right now you you can't go on the strength of your shout you can't go on the strength of your praise you can only go on the strength of your faith and your faith will teach you that the more you praise the more oil gets poured on your faith it's a cycle and it's not vicious it's powerful it's a beautiful cycle the more we praise the more we worship Him the more of his blessings pour down but there comes a time that we can't just sit around and get F on the blessings on the Delicacies there time there comes a time that we have to work for one another there comes a time we have to fight for one another and Jesus is about to teach the disciples your your constant Buffet is about to be over you're fixing to face the deepest and darkest Trials of your life and the only way I know to give you strength to move forward is to show you how to serve one another the purpose of the five-fold Ministry is not to be served the purpose of the five-fold ministry is to serve and if anyone knows the value of respects it always does us right it always benefits us to show respects to the men of God but the ministry is not in place there that we would serve them God has raised them up that they might serve us so sometimes there's blessing but it's a mixture always of suffering and blessing it's a mixture of delicacy and servanthood it's a mixture of getting blessed by the presence of God but letting the spirit of the Lord not only anoint our mouth but go down and anoint our feet and take us to places as we surrender our will and say yes to him it it rubber meets the road after the meal is over are you following me that's when things start getting serious are we going to have another round of dessert are we going to start learning our lessons Jesus said it's time for the for the bless me to be done Delicacies are coming to an end and now I'm going to get up and show you how to serve one another and so he gets up and he lays aside his garments as we said a moment ago he took off his outer cloak a a and anyone can wash the feet of someone who loves them and who they love anyone even people that don't like feet are you with me anybody if you love somebody I don't think there's a mother that I've ever met that wouldn't have washed the most filthy feet in all the land if they belong to the one they loved that little one looking up now they might not always wash their husband's feet they might tell him to go get a shower but they're going to wash that little one's feet and they're going to Mother them and they're going to take care of them but I want you to know Jesus was about to show a bigger lesson than just washing the feet of those who love you those who are going to go all the way with you he was about to wash the feet of the very one that was to betray him this is how we know that we have crossed from Death to life when we can serve those who are out to destroy us I spent many years of my life God helped me to continue and to even do more but I've spent many years of my life ministering and serving people that were out to destroy me and you just have to say there's always going to be a Judas kiss but servanthood is not discriminatory we serve the body you know this message that I preached a few weeks ago again the second time I preached it in 2019 or 2020 and then I pre preached it again in 2023 dance or die I initially preached that message for a family that was sitting here in this church dying on the vine wouldn't praise wouldn't worship wouldn't say Amen wouldn't support what we were trying to do and God kept this is his Mercy week after week after week I would lay before the Lord for a word and he would give me a word like that dance or die giving them an opportunity to make I remember the day the spirit of God highlighted the quote from the church age book where brother brandom said sometime we just have to cry out to God I've been wrong and we don't gravel we don't gravel in our wrongness we don't have to get beat because we realize that we've been wrong we just cry out Lord I'm wrong and I want to be right and so when we're wrong and we want to be right sometime one of the ways that we can get out of that place get out of the rut get out of the grave get out of the spirit of death is to offer a praise to God one that exceeds the shoulders one that gets a little higher than the ears when someone says I've got a gun on you you better surrender I've got a feeling that you're going to do more than hips come on I got a feeling you're going to go as high as your agility will let you go you're going to fully surrender and sometimes that is all it takes is a full Surrender by saying yes I don't know how to undo the mess but I know how to praise you when I praise you it's not trying to vote for the preacher I'm not voting for the pastor by praising the Lord I'm not taking sides by praising the Lord I'm not going to use praise for a political move I'm going to praise him because he's worthy I'm going to praise him because he's wonderful well I knew that message wasn't going to provoke everyone to dance but in that moment it was my hope that it would provoke somebody to do something a little more than what they had done for over a year only we can hope only we can hope that as the word Goes Forth it catches us where we are and we respond to it from where we are and God lifts us High you can't respond to the word on a different level than the one you're walking on but if you will respond to the word on the level that you have have the level where you are God knows how to lift you to a higher place I know what it means to keep washing someone's feet when you realize that they're not for you they're against you I want to pass that test again and again and and again and again and again and again and I want you to pass that test Jesus was about to serve someone who was going to betray him someone who was going to sell him out someone who would doubt his authenticity you see the only way that Judas was able to do what he did he had to believe that Jesus wasn't who he said he was there was nothing in Judas that could have forced him to do what he did had he believed that Jesus was who he said he was now brother brandom said that Judas was saved and that he uh had uh had healed the sick and he had done some other Miracles and and and had you know repented so to speak whatever it looked like in that day but brother benam said where he made his final mistake was that he didn't go all the way up to the upper room and receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I cannot stress to you here and you out there the importance of having your own personal experience with the Holy Ghost it's the only thing that'll keep those Spirits out of your life and you can't get him and never come for a refilling you got to fill up and fill up and fill up and fill up he humbled himself brother brandom said he humiliated himself and if you look up that word humility you'll find that the root of humility is to humiliate in in Hebrew and Greek to humiliate when we think of the word humiliate it's like mocking someone to the to the extent that that they are destroyed to humiliate someone but the but the the original meaning of that word is really just to humble yourself to humiliate yourself in the message how can I overcome are you still with me I'm pushing through for you uh paragraph 100 Jesus gave us the example how to do it now we want to know how to overcome Jesus told us how to do it see I want you to read the next word did you know that humility is the key to overcoming I'd rather hear your testimony than you hear mine I'd rather hear what God is doing for you than for you to ask what God's doing for me this is one of the ways that we humble ourselves come on now one of the ways that we humble oursel is to talk less and learn more isn't that right ministers have a time with that I know we do but we must learn are you here are you sure praise God I need a water thank you excuse me how do we overcome Jesus told us how to do it see humility he GED himself he took a towel he washed the disciples feet and wiped them the very think of it the very G God Of Heaven humiliated himself do you agree with that he said we don't want to be humiliated he said that's the reason why women thank you that's the reason why women don't want their hair to grow out see the reason they don't want to dress like ladies should dress like men don't want to see it's the same thing they don't brother bandom is teaching us that it's a lack of humility that has plunged the Pentecostal Church into worldliness the lack of humility produces pride and that's exactly the reason why the church world is in the condition that it's in today he said they get humiliated but Jesus constantly look who he was greatness he said I'm going to say something greatness humiliates itself greatness humbles itself greatness so this great bride this unbelievable predestinated chosen bride must never choose to walk in Bride Pride we must always choose to walk in humility even in a world around us that doesn't know their right hand from their left hand if you understand what I'm saying say Amen in a message called the worst sinner in the city Minneapolis Minnesota brother Brandon said becoming a foot washer taking the towel and guarded himself South and wash the disciples feet I I just picked somebody up uh someone think well well you know why don't we ever have a a foot washing well we don't ever have foot washing so we could never you know we could never really enter into the spirit of this you I want you to think on what you're thinking entering into the spirit of this is not you washing my feet in church once a month brother entering into the spirit of this is living this out every day of Our Lives washing one another's feet letting his pain be your pain her heartache be your heartache this is servant good becoming a foot washer he washed the disciples feet he said let him that's great among you be the servant of all that was his example but us today oh hostile just let me let me let me have a little water here while you think on being hostile yes sir I wouldn't stoop to that fellow though that old drunk you know I wouldn't have nothing to do with him hello oh I'm Dr Jones see he said that's the reason we're not getting anywhere that's the reason why our pull pits are weak that's the reason today we don't have signs and wonders in our churches that's the reason today we don't have an oldfashioned Revival because Saints have become hostile instead of humble the key to overcoming he said is humility he said that's the reason today we don't have the pull pits are weak that's the reason today we don't have signs and wonders in the church that's the reason today we don't have an old passion Revival we're thinking we're somebody who are you preaching to all of us we're thinking we're somebody when we're nothing we can't overcome in a trip to Walmart I know I can't that's why I don't go you see everything what you used to see in an insane asylum you now see at Walmart people are insane they're moving closer and closer to Insanity because the bride is moving closer and closer to Eternity and as the bride moves closer to Eternity the world is moving closer to Total Insanity that's what the prophet told us the Bible said when a man thinks him something when he's nothing he does what the greatest Among Us well I've been here for 30 years the greatest Among Us there's no spiritual pedigree here I love it I'm so thankful for everyone that come and stood that came and stayed but that alone doesn't make you higher that alone doesn't make you better than somebody else you might be here because you're too lazy to go somewhere else that wouldn't be it that wouldn't be the right reason would it but that's no reason to think you're anything let me tell you something when we start thinking we're something it's When God says I got to show him I'm going to have to let him see who he really is I'm going to have to put the mirror up so she get a good glance at who she really is he knows nothing that he ought to know this is Brother random he knows nothing that he ought to know and he ought to know that he's a sinner he's a sinner in pergamin uh uh pergan Church age brother bam says in paragraph 281 I hope this isn't too much reading because I got a lot more the way up I didn't hear you the Way Up Is Down everything's falling down around us but the bride's not going down did you hear the song the bride's not falling the bride may have to listen to lies and she may have to fight her away way through the lies and the enemy may have to have the bride may have to have a song sung to her to remind us that when we can't hold on any longer he'll never turn us loose come on the way up is not up the Way Up Is Down he that humbles himself shall be exalted he that exalts himself shall be abased humbled himself he said don't try to be a big something try to be a little something it is good but can we do it but be what you are see be little in the sight of God be little in your own sight everybody else is above you hello oh my who could be greater than Jesus Christ who guarded himself and wash the disciples feet a foot washing flunky he become the god of Heaven the creator of Heaven down from his glory Jesus laid aside his garments that's what we're preaching on the god of Heaven the creator of heavens and earth washing dirty feet for fishermen oh with manure and stuff and dust off the roads where their garments had swept it up and washing it off a foot washing flunky what he was and then we think we're somebody we got to be doctor PhD so and so oh my that ain't Christ they don't display the lovely Jesus Christ he becomes servant to all when you have to announce that you're a genuine servant of God I'm a genuine called preacher I'm a genuine Apostle I'm a genuine Prophet when you have to tell us who you are there's no humility in that that's Pride it's actually false Pride because it don't mean anything let me tell you something the fruit is where it's at not immature fruit like Hawke was praying about we got to come to the place where we squeeze out some real fruit some mature fruit amen you don't have to have it on your on your business card you don't have to have it engraved on your Bible you don't have to go around telling every every body what part of the five-fold ministry you fulfill let your ministry open doors for you let your testimony do the work let the spirit that's on your life draw others you'll be surprised how God will bring somebody to you to hear what you have to say if you can't preach out there you need to get your eyes off of up here just being honest I'm telling you what they preached to me when I was a boy coming along if you've got your eyes on this you're looking at the the wrong thing we've got to learn to serve out there we've got to learn to minister out there and we've got to learn to serve in here if we're called to Ministry we're called to Ministry in here so that we can Bust It Out Hallelujah take it right out of the walls right out to where it's at brother Shaw ain't that right that's what you do God bless you for it the god of Heaven the creator of Heaven and Earth washing dirty feet for fishermen manuring stuff and uh uh you got to be Dr PhD so and so uh that won't display lovely Jesus Christ that ain't Christ he becomes servant to all that's right he taught us as an example that we should do to one another as he did unto us oh that's my Lord what makes him big because he made himself little see that's what made him big when you get to liking someone's brag is a little bit too too much well we are all human everybody likes to be appreciated but if you're living off of those words of affirmation alone they'll fail remember words are fickle aren't they it's not what you're looking for you're you're you're not looking for just someone to say something nice about you you're looking for your faith to open the door you're looking for the word of God to ooze out of you in such a way that it's non-religious but most sincere you don't have to say hallelujah amen glory to God amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen glory to God to be spiritual when I spoke in many conferences many many conferences around the world in the Pentecostal and charismatic world you would be surprised how many people I mean multitudes of people would come and introduce themselves to my wife and I and they would say I'm very spiritual I I just want to introduce myself I'm so and so and so and so and I'm called to do such and such and such and I'm very spiritual the first few times that was said to me I said oh really just like that oh really until I couldn't take it anymore and I finally changed my strategy and I said you know what sister what I have found out is people who are truly spiritual don't have to introduce themselves as such because if you get among someone who is spiritual they'll recognize you by The Same Spirit you won't have to validate yourself vindicate yourself how many of you know I hear people all the time talking about brother brandom's Vindication gets on my nerves a little bit because he kept saying God doesn't vindicate a man that's right I'm going to say that again for for any streamer that might be straggling and you need to hear it one more time we always talk about brother brandom's Vindication by thus sayith the Lord coming to pass by Miracles that took place by discernment that was correct and we say oh my God was vindicating him how come that servant of the Lord didn't run around touting his Vindication how come he went around saying God doesn't vindicate a man he vindicates his word now they immediately go to the quote where they want to confuse Us by saying the messenger and the message are the same well I want you to know something by Brother brandom's own definition the message is not William brandom by his own definition the message is the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and the only way Jesus can be revealed is for William brandom to get out of the way the only way for Jesus to be revealed in you is for you to get out of the way the only way for him to be revealed in me is to find Grace to be able to step out of the way are you with me oh my that didn't hit so well we might have to back up and hit that one again now I want you to know this wasn't the only time the Bible talks about Jesus or God humbling himself I want to read for you nine verses of Psalms 113 I I know that uh uh this may not have piqued your interest yet but stay with me would you I want to get this out praise ye the Lord Praise oh ye Servants of the Lord praise the name of the Lord this is David all the Psalms are not attributed to David but this is David blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and forever more from the rising of the sun until the going down of the same the lord's name not incessant testimonies of what God has done in me wow it's all right to share testimonies if we're pointing to the Lord but the same can be accomplished by lifting him up from the rising of the sun and the going down of the same the lord's name is to be praised are you here it's to be pray the Lord is high above all nations and His glory above the heavens who is like unto the Lord Our God who dwelleth on high who humbleth listen who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth God Is So lifted in glory god is so high in glory that if God is going to look into the heavens he has to come down to see it you hear what David said he's high above the Earth he's high above the heavens yet he humbleth himself to be able to look into the heavens he has to come down to see what's in the Earth this is this is a condescension isn't it this is down from his glory this is Jesus laying aside the Splendor that he had with the Father the glory that he had with the father hello let's go on he he raiseth up the poor listen to this he raiseth up the poor Out of the Dust he humbles himself to come down and once he gets here what does he do he ministers he raiseth up the poor Out of the Dust and lifteth the needy out of the dungill can anybody say Amen have you ever spent any time in the dung Hill every one of us were there every one of us were in the dust every one of us were in the dung Hill when he found us we didn't find the Lord the Lord found us that he may set him with princes who the poor that he may set him with princes even with the princes of his people he maketh the barren woman listen he maketh a barren woman to keep house there's a key here a woman who can't bear children of her own but she continues to Faithfully serve the house Faithfully serve her husband there's a conjunction here that's pretty powerful he maketh the barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful mother of children now how can you be a barren woman and be a mother of children at the same time well on the on the level if you look at this in the original you take the first the first surface level you can be a mother to other people's children you can love other children you can favor other people's children you can show your love as a mother to someone else's child not taking their place but supplementing serving as an accessory to help that woman but if you take this to the very original and go right back into the original it's saying more than to be a joyful mother of someone else's children it means if a woman who's Barren is keeping the house that it said let's read it again he said he maketh the barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful mother of children Praise You the lord it's prophetic how many of you know what that means it's prophetic by serving others he that bringeth a cup of water a cold water to a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive Psalm uh Psalm 18 and and 35 in the Amplified says you have also given me the shield of your salvation and your right hand Hallelujah has held me up your gentleness this is Psalm 18:35 in the Amplified your gentleness and condescension have made me great leak let's see if you can find that honey I want him to take a look at it it gives me a good place for water break did we miss that one somehow it's okay if we did Mark it down put it in your Bible mark it down you have also given me the shield of your salvation and your right hand has held me up has anybody ever experienced The Shield of the Lord's salvation blocking the enemy on your behalf has anybody ever experienced the Lord's right hand of power and authority holding you up when it looked like you were going under for the last time anybody with me and then I want you to hear this phrase right here I wish we could see it this phrase is so beautiful to me your gentleness and condescension thank you have the Mighty God did not make me great in his mightiness it was his gentleness that made me great it was the fact that he condescended that he came down down from his glory he stepped away from his Splendor it's because of that that you and I have been made saved we have been made redeemed we have been made great do you see that everything about our ESS is directly tied to his coming down from Glory his condescension I appreciate that John uh 1 you know this but let me read it to you John 1 1 through3 and the Amplified since you're so familiar with it in the King James he said in the beginning before all time was the word Christ and the Word was with God and the Word was God himself and he references Isaiah 9 and6 he was present originally with God does anybody believe that all things were made and came into existence through him Christ the word and without him was not even one thing made that has come into being and in John 1:14 in the Amplified it says and the word Christ became flesh human incarnate and Tabernacle fixed his tent of Flesh lived a while among us and we actually saw his glory his honor his majesty why because he brought it down to us such Glory as an only begotten son receives from his father full of grace favor loving kindness and Truth isn't that powerful Amen in a message perfect strength by Perfect weakness brother brandham says in paragraph 3:19 and their Jesus had been stood against the evil stood against those AR organizations stood against those Pharisees and become weak and submitted himself what help me now un death and died like a sinner died like a sinner on the cross bearing he who knew no sin yet he died there on the cross bearing our sins let's go on the very Psalms the very prophets that they believed in had quoted hundreds of years before for the very words that he said at Calvary and they failed to see it my God said David my God why hast Thou forsaken me Psalm 22 all my bones they stare at me not one of them is broke they wag their head and say he trusted in others he saved himself himself he can't save and all the things that the prophets had said was right there in front of them you hear that don't you as he hung there on the cross it was all hanging right right there in front of them and Jesus dying holding that word submitted himself God Emmanuel became so weak yes he came down from his glory he became so weak that he submitted himself to the death and to the grave and his soul to Hell remember and brother brandom screams with an exclamation weakness what is the message title perfect strength by Perfect weakness he's pointing to our example but out of that complete surrender come came forth on that Easter morning winding its way from the lowest he was the highest and did what become the lowest he come to the lowest people that's why you're here so your Shepherds it's us he come to the lowest people he went to the lowest city and the littlest man in the town had to look down on him you remember don't you from a tree went from there to death and from death to the grave and from grave to hell to the lowest that that could be got to the lowest hell that he could thought of he went into it he went to it but then from there God began to do what remember I would not suffer my Holy One to see corruption he wouldn't leave him in the bowels of hell if you and I humble ourselves God will not leave us in the dust if we will humble ourselves God will not leave us in the dust he will not leave us weak if we see how weak we can become In the Flesh in the in our own strength he will raise us up with his perfect strength every time every time every time every every time but then from there God began to raise him up through Paradise from there to the tomb and from the tomb to glory and so high that he had to look down to see Heaven exalted his Thrones in the heaven oh we're blessed we're so blessed we're so blessed let's go to the next one quickly uh forsaking all Tempe he gave up his sunship I want you to think on this just a moment down from his glory he gave up his sunship between him and the father to be made are you reading to be made sin for who did you know that he know no sin became sin for us our sins was placed upon him he gave up the sunship to become sin now he can he became as a sinner so that he could make Sinners Sons that's the story that's the story don't leave him in a Manger remember that he grew up he had a purpose more than just being coed over more than just receiving Gifts of frankincense and gold and myr he had a job to do Hallelujah now he takes Sinners and makes Sons out of them amen what a privilege yes sir now he gave his strength he became weak let's go on paragraph 153 now sir yes sir he gave his strength he became weak that he might be our strength he is can you all read that like you mean it you all remind me of elas when he first started can you all read that like you know what it says he became weak that he might be our strength let's read this part together he is our all sufficient strength praise God we don't need no other strength but the strength of the Lord Jesus he is my strength from day to day without him I would fall said the poet how wonderful how wonderful now I want you to look at this before we move to close in a bit 2 Corinthians 5117 and 18 let's study this carefully here therefore If any man be in Christ he is a this is why he came down to make Saints out of Sinners to make Sons out of Sinners come on he come to make Sons out of slaves didn't he do it therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature doesn't doesn't matter what he's done he's now a new creature old things are what and behold all things are become new now let's look at this and all things are of God who hath this is an important word let me hear you say this word reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and because of that hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation now that word reconcil there in the beginning of that verse is a word that means to [Music] exchange it means to buy back it means to return favor to does that say anything to you and then the word reconciliation that's what you're called to do is to restore the Divine favor to reestablish and interrupted or broken relationship because God returned favor to our lives by coming down from his glory yes he returned favor to our lives and because of that he gives us the grace as you've seen me do Jesus said this do you to one another he returns the grace and calls us to be ministers of reconciliation to do what to heal broken relationships most importantly that one that's between the man and his God the woman and her God we don't just get saved to be saved we're not just redeemed to be redeemed we're actually redeemed to be redeemers that's not taking anything away from the Christ that's giving Christ to the people and that's the responsibility of the Bride if you believe that say Amen verse 19 of the same chapter says to ITT that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us I'd like for you to read that that's the authority of the Bride the bride has Authority in reconciliation in the message living dying buried rising and coming paragraph 30 I'm just going to leave you to think brother brandom said' whatat a terrible thing that sin does it separates man from God and he was the sin offering that had to be offered for our sins and he was separated from the presence of God sin had separated him God placed our sins upon him and he was separated from God and that's why he cried why hast Thou forsaken me and because he was Forsaken and had taken this place and seen his people remember he saw his seed that he was come to be their Savior and to offer them life they had rejected him and it grieved him so till he was so brokenhearted until the blood and water and the chemicals of his body separated according to the description of the scripture and the examination of the Roman crucifixion his pericardium burst the sack that holds heart the fluid filled sack that protected his heart burst underneath the weight of the load and not only did Blood run through his body loose but so did water so that when the when the soldier came and took the spear and pushed it into his side some some people assume that was the empting of the bladder it had nothing to do with the bladder whatsoever it was the water that come out of the pericardium it was the heart's water the water that protects the heart and the blood and that issue had gone all the way through his body how many of you know you can't live long with that kind of thing happening filling up with blood and now fluid the the soldier thrust this spear into his side and blood blood and water come rushing out and the prophet tells us this was the bride being separated from her bridegroom he said in the same manner that Eve was taken from Adam the bride was separated from Christ that day hello that day on Calvary aren't we a blessed people oh yes we are yes we are all right and because he was forsaken did we finish that yes blood and water and the chemicals of his body separated now one more show us the father in Zurich he said now when he was here on Earth he said he was God he acted like God he preached like God he he healed like God but he died like a man my father my father why hast Thou forsaken me but he raised again like God God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself do you believe that I said do you believe that now let's move on to one more here for just a moment moment in a conference with God I'm going to skip a whole lot of scripture here but I'll come back to some of it before we are done in paragraph 122 uh of the message conference with God God dwells in humility not in PP that's always been the devil's idea PP God comes in humility he said that'll be a sign not a Lesser God but a man a man he cried like a baby when he was a baby he played in the streets like a boy when he was a boy do you hear this God in flesh the word in a body cried when he was a baby he had a poopy diaper you don't know what that does for me somebody said well brother I mean it doesn't take much to Thrill you does it that really Thrills me it Thrills me that he was in every way a man in every way a human being and yet God he worked in the carpenter shop with Joseph as a man at work he eat when he was hungry he sweated when he was hot he cried when he was sorrowful he was a man do you hear that this will be a sign to you God will dwell with you not a great big upy up man but a little low man with no background a sign that's a death stroke to the devil right there amen a lowly man he goes on that's a Deathstroke to every denomination and Pomp and all pumping Glory of this world it's a death stroke that the god of Heaven chose he could have come any way he wanted to come but he chose to come that way that's what happened at the conference it had to be decided that's the way he chose to come he didn't have to come that way he was the god of heaven but he chose to come as a baby down from his glory he chose to come that way that's what happened at that conference in heaven let me just call another under two conferences here he's preaching on that message conferences he said there was a time after a perfect life of 33 and a half years had been lived a man who wanted to live as much as I want to live as much as you want to live a man who had something to live for Brethren that he loved people that he loved sunsets that he like to see remember Jesus was a man God was in him there come a time when the spirit that was leading the lamb the dove oh yes now we're getting to something there had to be a conference between the lamb and the Dove and they formed a place to set it after the supper that night they crossed over a little brook cherith or somewhere and went across a brook and went into a garden called Gethsemane now that wouldn't have been the brook of cherith but you get the point they had to have a conference God and Christ had to talk it over the lamb and the dove had to sit together it was the dove that had to talk to the lamb and it was the Lamb's death powerful powerful now when they sat by that rock and all the Angels come down from heaven to listen in to this conference oh there was Gabriel Michael woodworm all the thousands of them sitting around the rock now that's a pretty powerful description but a very powerful thing was about to happen wasn't it I'm so thankful for that one more Perfection paragraph 52 even on a stormy night the birds had Nest the foxes had holes but I don't even have a place to lay my head the highest of all heavens of Heaven become the lowest of all those even to animal life was privileged to him above him as far as comfort of life not only that but in his death he suffered to death like no one ever suffered never in man ever suffered with such a broken heart till his blood and water separated before his death the last one along these this line paragraph 30 of living dying buried Rising coming he said what a terrible thing that sin does it separates man from God and he was the sin offering that had to be offered for our sins and he was separated from the presence of God sin had separated him God placed our sins upon him and he was separated from God and that's why he cried why hast Thou forsaken me this isn't poetic this is literal The God Who Lived the word who lived in him had to leave him God can't die God can't be crucified God had to withdraw himself from his own son so that his son could die in the flesh somebody said then how could it be Redemption because the blood that was in him was not of this Earth it wasn't of Joseph it wasn't of Mary it was God's Redemptive blood created for Redemption sin had separated him placed our sins upon him he was separated from God and that's why cried why hast Thou forsaken me go on and because he was Forsaken and had taken this place and seen his people he was come to be their Savior and to offer them life they had rejected him and it grieved him so till he was so brokenhearted until the blood and water what we just read a moment ago and the chemicals of his body separated now I want to give you one more verse and I'm going to close Hebrews 4 verse 14-6 seeing then we have a great high priest thank you Jesus that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted hello sir as we are like as we are read the rest let us therefore do what come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need I have to read one more I I I apologize Philippians 2 5 and 8 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of now that scripture verse there where says being made in the form of God that's where brother brandham gets the Greek word morphe and he added the preposition the Greek preposition to it and he called it inor which means in form I in form but it's e in in the Greek in Mor he took on the form remember the prophet explained that to us like the drama of a Greek Theater where the mask was changed the character was the same the actor was the same but in order to fulfill the role and play the part he had to change mask and that's where that word in morphe comes from one God one Spirit changing mask took upon him the form morphe of a servant and was made in the likeness of men that word reputation there is Kino like sister Megan's name Kino and it's from the word Greek word Kino and this is an important word it's from the Greek word Kino that we get the the the word or or or the theme kenosis and kenosis is the emptying of himself of all deity and that's what happened on the cross all that was of God had to leave him there so that he could die alone somebody said I don't understand how that could do anything for us what it actually does is it takes mortal men the old song that that the mamies used to sing my favorite song when I think about the birth of Christ says who do you think would believe such a thing who could believe that this story is true it says and the star one part of the second verse said and a star moved round in Heaven until it stopped right over them and some Shepherds said an angel came and told them about the birth listen this line they always knew that men went to heaven but now God had come to Earth The Inspirations used to sing it years ago The Wonder of Wonders oh how could it be that God became flesh and was given for me the almighty came down and walked among men The Wonder of Wonders he died for my sin uh uh uh talks about Mary sister Beverly I can't think of the verse can you think think of the line there um as she as she looked looked on his uh his his little face uh his voice had thundered can someone Google that The Wonder of Wonders I'd like to read those lyrics to you yeah as she heard his small cry his voice had thundered on Mount Si he created the womb I've got it now thank you he created the womb that had given him birth he was God incarnate come down to the Earth The Wonder of Wonders How Could It Be The Wonder of Wonders is there anything in that that makes you think of a Christmas tree is there anything in that that makes you want to give gifts to to one another is there anything in that that makes you makes you want to you know sing Under the stocking oh this is the story this is the story condescension is the story it's not a baby still laying in a Manger that's not the story people get so been out of shape this time of year because thugs will come and steal the little baby out of the manger scene oh they think that's the most awful thing in all the world if there is a town brave enough bold enough to put a a a a manger scene and then some little Thug will come and and steal it away or some freedom from religion act some freedom from religion Club member will come in there and hide that away I don't want to see that let me tell you something you've got more way more this world has got way more than a little baby on their hands oh yes they've got way more to answer for than what they do with a little baby in a Manger he's not in that manger anymore come on now this is this is the Story of All Seasons down from his glory that word Kino kenos or kenosis let me read you just a couple more quotes and I'm done I I won't feel I won't feel good if I don't and you may not be awake if I do but but I'm going to anyway adoption number two he said when he last cried Ella Ella my God my God that was a man why hast Thou forsaken me in the Garden of Gethsemane the anointing left him you know he had to die as a sinner he died a sinner you know that not his sins but mine and yours that's where that love come in how he took mine oh hallelujah how he took mine and then the unveiling of God this is beautiful paragraph 77 now when it's said there that he emptied himself or poured out it actually said in in in King James made himself of no reputation the meaning of it he emptied himself he poured out now we would think like this that he vomit uh the English word of emptied or poured out from him see something went out of him that was different from him and that would be in the flesh he goes on but the word kinos in the Greek does not mean that he vomit up or his arm went off or his eye went out another person it means that is he changed himself he poured himself into amen into another Mass into another form not another person went out of him called the Holy Spirit but it was he himself you get it and we do get it he himself poured himself into the people Christ in you how beautiful how wonderful to think God pouring himself into a human being into the believer pour out it was a part of the drama to do so God all the fullness oh the godhead bodily was in this person Jesus Christ he was God and God Alone not a third person or a second person or a first person but the person God revealed or veiled excuse me in human flesh and in the same message paragraph 238 and 39 notice all the glory musicians come all the glory that is in God is in this word all the blessings that's in God is in this word or in the the word it's hid to the unbeliever by what not not wrong something wrong with every tradition but there are Traditions that cause us to look in the wrong direction I'm going to slow down there are Traditions that cause us to look in the wrong direction someone posted today early this morning a picture of their little grandbaby putting the star on top of the tree and the caption we don't celebrate Christmas but we put little trees up for the kitties some people are unbelieving by their Traditions there are some Traditions that may take us toward Christ there are Holiness there are certain aspects of our personal walk of Holiness the way we dress that are not particularly sin issues but there are Traditions that we carry on because we believe that it draws us closer and makes us another example a greater example to the world around us people come and ask us where we go to church and where we worship because they can see that we take it seriously enough to change our Traditions anybody with me but I'm thinking to myself is this really what brother random me meant when he said these things are for the kitties was he really telling us that there's anything to take out of that tradition that causes someone to see Christ it doesn't it doesn't if we want to reveal Christ we reveal him in our own lives hello and we reveal him by by moving through his death and Resurrection come on now he said all that God was he emptied himself it's all in Christ all that God was he emptied himself kenos and came into Christ and we into Christ are where is that where you want to be folks he said well I'm into Christ you say and then believe there's three Gods baptized in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost believe in all these traditions and things that you believe in of the know you're still behind the veil see come into the veil he Christ is the word if you believe that let's stand forgive me for dulling you out there for a little bit I don't know how in the world we'll do it because it's a awful hard song but we have got to try to sing just a little bit of down from

it and thought about it and we are not going to have a service here on Tuesday night we're going to give this an opportunity to uh to die hopefully uh I feel like I'm fighting myself this morning and I'm not going to have it how many of you are not going to have it but I don't want to do anything that jeopardizes babies or or our older ones and I I really want God to do something for us Sunday we're going to have a great singer with us to help sing to us and looks like and uh some special friends of ours that I've wanted you all to meet them some Of You' have met them but some of you have not and I've wanted you to meet them for a long time and I don't know what God's going to do next Sunday but he's going to do something I know he is so if you will uh if you will not be offended then we will not have a service here Tuesday night you have the app you've got the prophet's messages you've got access to the word you you shouldn't have any problem finding something to feed on a't God good to us I had originally told some of the young brothers that I would meet with them on Thursday evening of this week but I'm not going to do that either and the reason for that is because we're waiting to see what company is going to do and how things are going to work out and uh I just feel like that we'll we'll we will wait till the first of the year to do that so you young brothers that uh knew about it and and wanted to participate I hope you won't be disappointed but I really want to do it in the right timing of the Lord and uh just turns out that I don't think it will be this week father we are so grateful to be in your house today we are so thankful for what you did for us you came a mighty long way from Glory walked among men and paid the price became sin for our salvation and deliverance the least that we can do is praise you with everything that we've got and do our very best to surrender to your word in this late hour I ask ask you to watch over this body right now in the name of Jesus Lord I truly believe that you are the Divine healer and the great physician and it really hurts our hearts to see something like that moving from family to family we believe God that you can stop it at the root and so we're asking that you would build us up this week not only physically but also spirit spiritually and that you would watch over those who are traveling this week bring them home safely to us at the right time as we go today Lord we take your peace with us there's nothing like your peace the enemy is a peace disturber but you are the prince of peace and we love you supremely today we give you Praise In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ we pray and the saint said amen would you go out of here with a praise in your heart and thanking God that you know who
