TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Weist in you the hope award [Music] hello there I'm Pastor Steven Shelley of New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and it's always a delight to come to you on the gospel Channel what beautiful days we have to serve the Lord and we are so excited about what God is doing what we're seeing the Lord accomplished we're excited about the outreach of Christian television we believe that as we have said many times before there's a lot of garbage on the television but God is using the television to take the gospel to the far reaches of the world I'm very blessed today and extremely honored to have in our studio in Alabama the founder and CEO of Omega television and the gospel channel brother Eric Erickson he was with us here a year and a half ago when we dedicated this studio to the Lord by a miracle the Lord provided the equipment that we needed to be able to come to you on a regular basis and he came all the way from Iceland to pray a dedication prayer and to be a part of the camp meeting and so it's really exciting to have him with us at this time brother Erickson we are delighted that you are with us in Alabama yep it's a privilege it's a wonderful time and opportunity to be here with you and all these wonderful people here and coming and to know everything is going so well here from the studio and how God had been given opportunity for you to take wonderful program here many different people and I feel it the very excited and when I come here in a stroller studio I say wow this is wonderful I want to copy and paste this through the people last time because it is a very comfortable it is very very good you know yeah I'm glad you've interviewed me many times on the gospel channel from Iceland yeah but this is my first time to interview you and before we started you were asking me about the camera shots and it just it made me laugh inside because it reminded me this this is must be a little turned around for you because you often do the interviewing and now you're on the spot I get to ask you questions yes and I'm maybe have the same feeling like the people that is coming to Castellano studio and I'm setting I'm hosting the pro right and they are so many time very nerve yes and when I sit down here I have a little bit nervous you know if any oh wow this is think you know good because you know you're not in confident you never know what I'm going to end yeah I want to start off by reading a scripture before we and start asking questions but I felt like the Lord laid a verse of scripture on my heart to share with all of you from the 28th Psalm and when I think about brother Eric Erickson and I think about the gospel channel I think about the beautiful people of Iceland because that's where it started and I think about how they have so faithfully prayed and supported the gospel channel so that now it's across Scandinavia and across the UK and in so many different places when I think of what God is accomplished with just a handful of people and what he is accomplishing today this scripture I think is very very appropriate in Psalm 28 and verse 7 it says the Lord is my strength and my shield my heart trusted in him and I am helped therefore my heart greatly rejoice it and with my saw will I praise him the Lord is their strength and listen and he is the saving strength of his anointed save thy people and bless thine inheritance feed them also and lift them up forever these are encouraging verses of Scripture and I believe that that's exactly what the Lord has done in the life and ministry of brother Eric Erickson in the gospel Channel he has been the saving strength of his anointed I believe my brother that you are a man called for a job and I think I've heard you say before that you were the most unlikely but God saw it differently that's how you saw yourself but I believe that when God looked at you he said that's the man for the job and it must have been true because here you are after all these years still still doing such a wonderful work for the Lord I would like for you to share with the people today your testimony of how you found the Lord your childhood a little bit yes where did you start it started in that way I mean every summer from for six years old I go to my grandfather and move it it was far away from the capital city it was in East part of Iceland and I call that every summer and my grandfather he was a really great men he was a very quick and very serious and but what he did he helped me to have a Lord's Prayer every night and he put his hand on my chest you know and they and we have the Lord's Prayer together and he did it every single night every time I was there and for six summer and then I very thankful for that because I know God was real he was far away and but I knew that this was the prayer I think that that was very important and many time I maybe just repeat the Lord's Prayer but it's sink into my life right exactly and we know that it's time you know the God knows and also we know the devil is real yes like Jesus absolutely and I have a wonderful father a mother but like the devil is coming in one day another he the divorce mmm and I was just four or five years and my mother she was quite sick she has asthma and she was not easy to take care of and so I remember that I I was put in some places where children born where they have no mother or no mother and so I was there you know just alone sometime I thought you know where are my father where I'm a mother I'm not seen and for a long time you know but I thought it was just a normal you know to be there in with all other children and but when I was with my grandfather it was quite a good time nice fellowship with all of the people that was there like a family but you know that the devil's real and and something took place you know the devil came to me the Bible said Satan himself he can take a form on the internal life absolutely and so he came in some way and and he fooled me and we know that in Iceland it was very superstition believing that people live in a rock by God and there was a man a boy like me same age he he was in communication with something you know he said this is the people I am in in a communication with and I was very curious because I was very hungry to know more sure and so he will always tell me about what he explains so and but he said you know they quite don't speak about it you know don't share about it you know if you if you share about it it will be will call a curse on our life oh yeah Wow be very helpful you knows he said so I was all at America very carefully I didn't want to put a curse on my life but when I was 12 years old I have a grandmother that was such a loving grandmother she took care of me and my mother was so sick she couldn't take care of me she loved me so much you know and I loved her so much you know and one day I maybe thought maybe as here with her about what had been said about my life that will be cross on my life if I will expose or tell about these people so I was very afraid you know told my my grandmother and she hurt me and but she didn't recognize how thin so serious but that has a very negative active-active on my life in effect on my life because he when I start to think about everything was working wrong with me you know I was not happy in school I did not feel any purpose to learn algebra I didn't see nothing purposely and so I was very curious or I go astray you know I start to smoke and drink even 12 years old wow that's young yo you're high things you know because my father mother did not watch me I I could live my life as I want but I was very very excited to find what life have to give then they came a tightening toughness in my life so much you know and I always thought you know this occurs on my life they say Eric there's a curse on your life and so I did bothered me very much you know and so the boy that was with me and when he was about 20 years he just killed himself you know oh and so the devil always told me hearing you next Wow and then I got to some working outside reykjavik in some farm outside i was there as a worker and there was a old lady there that was very sometimes he could be very upset you know and one times I was doing something that she's not too you know and she said you know go to die and I I was scared to death you know because I thought okay and they said you know there was a boy before me and that in his farm and he said the same to him and he killed himself oh my so I always thought I was the next one I'm sure and so I I go in a very very deep darkness and I in myself I always say believe God that he was far away and when I was 13 years old I live alive I was so desperately I want to kill myself I have been fighting with some boys and they was putting cold water on me and making fun you know and so conspiracy against me you know so I was very upset I I haven't arrived and I thought I want to kill myself you know and so I was so desperately you know then I heard a voice you know someone said to me Eric you allowed to go to movie today all the children at the farm so I certainly I forget you know and so I remember that we go to the town and there was a film that I saw called Ben okay Ben Hur yes and both of my friend that was a we was fighting one set my right and other or the left and then we start to watch this movie were very excited child Heston and it's a very great movie and then I came up scene where suddenly Jesus show him up in the film and I start to watch you know and I saw in the film you know when Jesus a he touched the people and he got healed you know and like that and I I just start to cry you know and I also see em because my friend you know move on with left on the right side you know I I was in sestra trouble you I try all my best not to to cry you know and I was so touched you know Wow and I felt Jesus is a wonderful you know wow just amazing you know and then after I we left the movie I I was allowed to sleep at my mother house in town so before I came as a big apartment on the pit for my mother lived there so I was certainly and I came to that house and people go in have a cigarette you know and so I want to smoke but I said you know Eric you cannot smoke Jesus you if you love Jesus and what can you do for Jesus what did Jesus do for you what can you do for him and if you if you are smoking your sin your sin against God but the negative was so strong you know I I I have a smoke you know and I'm had a very bad feeling you know and I came in my home at the mall that place and then people got to sleep I used to go to with a lure spray like my grandfather but the table said you a hypocrite you know you're sendin you break the law you are you are not good boy and now you come to ask for for for prayer and forgiveness you know and I was feeling very but I felt like I was betrayed you know and I'm betrayed Jesus only in years old only person that really loved me you know I knew and I was betraying him you know my and so I am feeling very very bad but that time I didn't know that them I could ask Jesus to fork in write and mention what he had done for me and to ask him to help me to live a Christian life help me to get rid of the topic you know and in that way I was feeling very bad you know and but life continued I was drinking with math friends you know and as soon I knew I was a bound by alcohol sure and then they came a track you know not so bad as it today you know but it was really bad you know mr. to take the pill you know sleeping pills all types of things you know so I found I was bound I could not in my own state they get loosed from the side so III was hopeless you know and I got so sick you know I was almost death you know I was in hospital I walk into hospital because I have not eaten for a long time and then I knew that was a lady old lady she believed in Jesus and she was going to Pentecostal church so I make a phone call to her from spittle from hospital and I and I said you can you please ask the people to pray for me I am such a need for help and she said yes of course Eric I want to ask we will pray for you tonight this was Tuesday night then and we will come together about 8:30 p.m. we will pray for you and so I was in a hospitai was in a room and there was another person in the same room young boy and so I was waiting eight thirty people then I thought you know what would come a great power you know healing power and would be safe and I were waiting nothing took place you know and then this the boy said oh look Eric Wow a concealed light coming down from heaven hmm it was like a star you know and I jumped out the room I thought Jesus was coming you know and he says I saw the light coming Eunice was like a star coming down here and I bet I didn't see it you know then I go and try to sleep you know and I start to pray for my family from a friend you know for the people that around me and I was feeling a bed in my stomach and then suddenly prop Lobot one o'clock in the night I slept you know then in the morning I wake up and we have a coffee time and were sitting down and very heavily you know Wow no help to get you know then someone put the pink on my shoulder I said Eric I woke up at night he was in the same room and I saw Jesus standing by your room and stood availability of foot foot you know and was a light shining over you and he saw and he told something about you and I don't remember what it was exactly but he looked to me I never seen such a kind and nice wonderful beautiful face you know with such a love instantly has slipped so I knew okay Jesus came you know hmm and so it came my hope in my life and I believe a problem forty tests later Jesus he showed himself to me in a meeting how old would you have been twenty-four twenty-four years young and I had been many meeting I would listen to testimony from people and they were telling what Jesus came and helped me I get loose from toe part I get loose from alcohol but I was struggling I was directly so the devil said Eric this is just emotion this is not so real you'll do it yeah and so I was sitting in a in evening it was a Sunday evening it was probably about three four hundred people in the church I was in the middle you know and I thought you know okay this is just an emotion this is not real so I said you know I want to go out you know because this is just a this is no real thing you know this is just emotion this is not fact so but I couldn't move because people were sitting you know so I could i okay I have to sit here all the meeting and suddenly someone stood up I start to speak some very strange language you know but if something very nice it come from the heart you know I first you know then came a silent you know deep silent and then someone stood up it start to interpret you know what was said everything that was said was a clear message to me what they were thinking what I going through you know and this is he did pick me for unbelief product and he told me if I come in faith and trust in him pray I will meet him he would show me a man so I was so excited to whom waiting for the oft call and then the optical creme because I was in the middle of it so many people came forward so I have to have a go to the small room and when I was just a kneeling in a small room nobody was around me some power came I felt down then I heard the voice speaking to me that was the Jesus speaking to me he was almost standing by my side you know and he said you know I'm going to help you I'm give to the new life I'm coming and so the first time I knew Jesus were real he was not far away he was just coming to me personally right personally and I stood to I was like a man that had been plant all my life I could see I could see I could hear my feeling was so good I was so inspired you know I said now I have a new life and now I am freed from all darkness from all the curse everything new him a always a new life and that's a forty-five years ago Wow so it must've - oh yes and and my heart are so much to reaching out to other people I tried to ask my father and mother and all the because my father mother was she said nice wonderful I could not have a more loving father and mother or stepfather stepmother all the time was just a love between the people but the devil came when I was young they split the and harmful things took place but later everything came in such a wonderful piece you know my father he was such a good man he was such a good relation with my mother my stepfather there was a good friend you know Wow and they were so kind you know and we never felt any strive or or evil things about anybody that's incredible they they was just a love you know my father never curse never spoke evil open no potty and he was a very special my mother see when I start to work check about things you know my my father of my mother he was a true belieber he taught my mother to pray to read from a pipe or and to love the Lord as well as my father or my father you know grandfather he taught everybody and every Sunday he he have everybody to come in one place and he was sharing God's Word to them so this is a background yeah but when I was born the devil know what he he want to kill me he want to destroy everybody but God mercy came in God came into my life and well funny thing is that one night I was with my friend he was a very tough guy he had been in and out of prison and he was always very kind to me and so I looked to me because he was here oh you he was he he he was strong everybody was praying with him you know he was my friend you know so you were honored to heaven in my room you know in the middle night will he was speaking to me up with Jesus you know and I thought about I could not argue with him you know and so so he said you know Eric this is truth because one of my friend that was been in a prison one time we broke out of the prison we took the the keeper of the prisoner but we took a many men close meant to the prison and it took the key from him and we just escaped from the prison Oh the pole it was after the whole nation on the ratin everybody wore blue government and that night he said you know now my friend he know the Bible he say no more drugs no more alcohol you have to control listen to him so that was how I came first time to hurt very powerful preaching Pentecostal very powerful you know Jesus a life free man him and so so okay getting people to come to meeting that was very typical but so I thought you know III wanting I know where they are they are now at home watching the TV why not to have a Christian TV in I thought it was something that came to my mind you know but this was on 7576 so this is the beginning that I knew to reaching out to people were through the media because the people are there and people have a free will and they can choose right absolutely and so this is a amazing how God brought me out of darkness came new life and then I knew that I want to do something for the Lord I like I want to like the big guy I want to like appellee grahame you know I and one of my favorite William million per annum that was my favor you know Siham polio knows as a godly man with such a wonderful powerful things in in their life healing to place you know absolutely I were watching cutting Coleman a Alan you know and so I want to feel like back up random like a pillock Raya make some order rope as you know then a lot told me Eric maybe they would like to be like you yes of course uh uh everybody had the same same opportunity to set the Lord and so Lord show me what are they doing why are why are I using them that's a good question so think about why are they use backup are they special maybe they have a special calling special office but what was that took them to function in Langley because I knew that prayers and fasting and seeking God wholeheartedly and they paid the price full price in the full price and they lay on the floor the whole night praying seeking God and having breakthrough like I was reading from the daughter of Billy Graham she said you know want many time in the early in Prak first in the morning I knew my dad had been praying the whole night he had such a fight with the devil you know and so we know that a Alan he locks him inside the room he was fasting and praying and he said to her if I don't open the door unless something will take place you know at a long time he has a really experienced from the Lord and God showed himself spoke to him out openly and they and this is same things with all over like when I have been studying blood random you know I I knew he was a young man he was not little Lord he was a rebellion against God you know there's a young boy yes but he called through lot of tough times so he came to the Lord and God left him a pen and gave him most powerful ministry I believe that anybody had in a lifetime I agree yeah and so so that was very inspiration for me or I were used to listen Katherine Kuhlman I have a one tape you know I thought all think about the power the place of the Lord how God can use a woman that is so skinny so thin you know this is a healing power so skinny you know so so I thought you know I was so thirsty for the Lord well I said lord I will give everything so can use me I want to I don't care I want to slay be in a one room with a one pet and was the one I I don't care I want the Holy Ghost I want to use by you I want to and i pray lord help me to reach out to millions of people and I knew the people say if we pray according to his will right we'll hear the pray amen so I oh that's good I say lord please help me to leech of millions of people for you and even sir you know mm-hmm this was when a 7576 yet I was in Norway I asked his prayer so now we are in a network in Europe Scandinavia Iceland reaching million no house exactly and I believe that we will go further absolutely absolutely this was a fantastic so how did how did this the network start I I know the Lord put the burden in your heart to reach millions of people yeah but you you must have not started with a million people you you must have been reaching feeling my humble beginnings I started with a small 1000 transmitted radio transmission 1986 I laugh every time in 1986 you're speaking to a neighborhood maybe maybe yes yes it was but it was a good stuff it was a good start because you were proving you were proving your desire little is much when God is in it and you were faithful over the little things and it was amazing I remember 1986 when we put the signal on the radio and we start to play the the the music and we spoke in God's Word and being with people to call in we did it very silently we didn't want to behave a big blow you know we just was on air we start to broadcast people's tuning back and forth and certainly we came up to the phone number please you can call if you have a prayer request whatsoever and the peel and the phone start or end you know amazingly avow someone was listening he are so many more than we thought you know amazing and so so I stay with that ratio for two and half years two and a half years and that was a lot of fight because the past or they just misunderstood things you know they thought they should have control of the radio station they said you make we will not help us we will be here and saying what to do so there was a fight you know and and put some really fight you know I was not happy about that you know and then then I start to think about it you know the Lord spoke to me in so clear way to reaching out to the whole world so so I thought you okay I will just use another way I want to have a powerful radio short-day and reaching from Iceland all over the world pow sure because a short day they go order of wall of the road so I thought this is answer so I go to America I stayed for six month see an exhibition they want to raise up a very powerful radio transmitter in Iceland and that kosta 1/2 million dollar and what about this was shoot but we knew nothing was impossible for God right so I I was in America 6 month with my family mmm Daniel was a small he was three years old when he came to America with me and my thought it was 2 years and we staying at Tucson and I was sharing the vision that God put in my heart and people were listening you know they was very excited you know and I saw the map and I show them how we can reach from Iceland all over the world you know but someone said to me one pastor Eric I have to confess that you know this sound like a smoke in air for me but now I can say things are real he said you know and so when I came back to Iceland I I was with a kids small kids and wife and I said you know I have to do something to live you know so I came to my mind you know I want to do something business you know so I said you know a carpet cleaning company that's easy you know I can work hard you know and then I have a time to serve the Lord right so I put some machine you know good machine you know little bit you know good price you know so I make business card from processor and I start to go to company offer the service you know and so we came to one company that was renting a cleaning machine and there was all couple there you know and they was trying to get some rent some equipment it was a really trouble so he came to bid my business card you know and they said you you can maybe help us you can maybe clean our house and as I certainly haven't do that you know and my heart starts to beat you know I have never done it before you know hmm this is a nice machine I have pocket you know I have never used it before so I called my wife and we have to go in this to this place we have to clean the house so I came there you know there was a whole nice couple you know they show me that the living room and carpeting and in the stairway and in a statement why Wow Austin I've never pushed it on me you're in the carpet clean yes but you have a clean carpet I always say to me mama so put the words it is you know and many people get out I was a pretty good power on you know starting all this is working very well you know so did he clean all the houses you know and they all cover the big smile you know this is want to be see such things on a carpet and they just pay that was the beginning a great business you know I did a great business you know Wow and then we have a company we have a cleaning company and and and then later a I hire my uncle you know and we were still in great job you know mmm and then one morning 8 o'clock 19 1 8 8 8 o'clock eight or nine that God spoke to me before the day I things are very cold dark outside I were feeling flu and I would not feel good you know I was feeling diamond force in air and I said wow I am just dying in Iceland you know it is a clean or rate or nothing to do just cleaning carpet you know so I could wake up early in the morning go to the bathroom and suddenly the light came you know and I felt the Lord speaking to me in a cesta clear way I want you to build me a Christian TV station realized Wow and so I put my hand like this you know a lot I I know that you're speaking to me I want to open you because you will speak it to me this is why I want to obey show of my wife see wake up you know I said you know God spoke to me to start the Christian TV station oh he said you know with a big guy you know be very careful in the voice of reason yeah be very careful I said yes of course you know and I knew what it mean you know I have to go to the small trailer room then he was still sleeping you know when he was still sleeping you know and then I kneeled down you know I pray the one now at two one and I certainly felt the Spirit of the Lord you know I say all things possible you know who would strengthen me Amen so III was say I knew I had son I think I have some faith sure I saw it was possible you know and so I start to think where can I get the transmitter but I need her license before ok there's a lot yes yes so so I asked for the government to give me license to have a Christian television so very soon I have the letter from the government we have granted you this request so I I have to go to that office and of course with my wife she's a saucers things as an important person you know and we came to this government office and people sitting that very seriously you know no smiling you know and their wonderful facility is a generic are you sure what your to make do you know what it costs to make it just the one hour in a national TV I said yes yes I know yeah no problem yeah I know yeah just my league you know need and then they have uh some nice document you know and and the the person that was the initiator of this is a generica I have to confess you're the most obstinate person I ever met in my life hmm I we don't know but we will give you this crisis and sign my letter you know I was and then I say say goodbye so we go to the car old Citroen car shut the door with the document with a license my wife was sitting by my side you know I started to thank God for this Jesus thank you yes we have no transmitted we have no money but we have the lies we have a license and then we put the car on race committee it was a car seat on the left and after you know it was one of the less than that because there were many tables of snow in Iceland so it had to lift the math you know so I could upgrade it so this was the beginning you know and then later I found out the company in East part well where they have a TV small TV network and I asked him to you have a transmitter available and he said you know properly we have a transmitted ten mods properly we we can sell or whatsoever how call me at the Banach I and I did you know they said you know yeah we can rent this to you and appropriate was are about twenty thousand Icelandic króna at that time that's about like $200 today but at that time you know that it's more now it's like a thousand $2,000 so I said yes that would be fine you know and okay we sent you that transmitter and then we found out you know the transmitter was a children to channel 59 so we have to change that frequency to channel 45 but because this was quite all transmitted so I said you know have you some talk of and talk about it that the transmitted no okay we we will do our best the birthday the government people that said you know we want to have the money and the front you know is a quite work and people they they thought he was just good idea but there was very serious so I said yes of course I understand that so I start to speak to some of my friends and one of the friend he said you know he was a former priest to the priest he said Eric no problem I will go to the churches and we will get the money that is needed that was about thousand dollars something like that so I said you know I was not so positive that he will come with money from not journey but they didn't say nothing you know then left if six weeks he he came you know he said Eric I'm very disappointed nobody want to help nobody nobody nobody want to help and so I continued to pray as I spoke to some company and I had to speak to them several time you know and one of my friend is wrote a check and and small church gave at ten thousand and then I finally came with the money and they would pick a smile you noted and they said oh yes we will work on the soon we will call you when we finished then one week later I have a phone call and the man said generic you have to come yes I I want the communist on these things voice you know so I have the world cup fourth floor stairway no elevator you know when they came on top I like it and they look to me very sad you know he said you know I'm be sorry but it didn't work you know you cannot use it transmitters oh no and I was almost paralyzed you know grab a try I'm a throat you know I say I don't understand you know I was sought as I was a darkness you know in my mind you know so I I have to go home and told my wife you know this is very strange we are not allowed to use the transmitter it was like a furnace of course this was like as someone had died you know because you were so close yes yes yes yes and I and then the phone ring I can you and I pick the phone the same voice you said you have to come again so I I saw a drove down working the fourth floor and said you know he said you know Eric you have to you must have been praying because we found out you can use the transmitter it was just a human mister praise God there's a scale you know we magnified too much you know you it's normal you can use it unbelievable and then like wow I thought was this was multiple use and then was another step you know it's needed some Mota later motivated is that you take the video signals into some piece and it will convert it to radio frequency to fit the transmitter okay and that cost about Iceland Colin three hundred thousand kronor that time I've also quite good morning but I had to have it you know and and I had not the money so I was very very think about that you know then I had someone that came to me he said you know my former son you know when I was young boy you know I I had some Sun you know everything broke up because the life story I will explain it yeah in the

outside Reykjavik in countryside there were no electric no phone nothing no doctor far away from anybody she was so sick when she was 12 years and then she open look up and Jesus came to her visible with a shining light and he cityscape inanity taylean on in theaters and see code to sleep and she woke up totally healed so I knew that the Lord he is chosen like all of us you sell me as when you

outstanding and I know that through the years you've shared bits and pieces of this but yeah I I just have a feeling that there are people on the other end yeah who are hearing this testimony maybe together like this for the first time yes and I think that they will appreciate even more when they turn on the gospel channel yeah and they hear how it started with a vision with a burden to reach millions men to reach the world yeah but but it started out just reaching a neighborhood yeah I think that's going to encourage a lot of people to pray for the gospel channel because the greatest days are just ahead yeah and we're talking about the history but yeah but the future is the brightest and now we have be living and planning I believe from from the Lord we want to have a live broadcasting from Monte to Friday on primetime prime time and we want to ask people to help us because we work on troop to part in Iceland but I cannot give from Monte to Frazier so I'm asking some brother sister what are involved in this great vision to reaching out to lost people to comment so I believe that from this place we will have a life everlasting in Scandinavia in England in Iceland and an anointing
