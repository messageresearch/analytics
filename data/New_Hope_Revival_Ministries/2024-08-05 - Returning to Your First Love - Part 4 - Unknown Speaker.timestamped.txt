[1:06:46] America aren't you glad you can be here
[1:06:50] in fact there's nowhere that I would
[1:06:52] rather be this morning than right here
[1:06:55] in the presence of the Lord anybody
[1:06:58] would choose this over the hospital or a
[1:07:01] prison but I choose it over
[1:07:04] everything I'm where I need to be and
[1:07:07] where I want to be and where I desire to
[1:07:10] be I just don't have a song in me Ben
[1:07:13] but thank you for for asking would you
[1:07:16] give these uh wonderful gifted
[1:07:20] anointed Chosen and appointed
[1:07:24] musicians agre great
[1:07:27] hand we appreciate
[1:07:31] them we thank God for
[1:07:34] them they give their talent and their
[1:07:38] gifts to the Lord and they and we are
[1:07:41] the
[1:07:42] beneficiaries uh of their yielded to the
[1:07:45] Lord we're blessed because of them and
[1:07:48] because of how God uses them there's
[1:07:50] only one thing I long for and that is if
[1:07:53] I could take Cade and his gift home with
[1:07:56] me all the time and so if I could just
[1:07:59] have a
[1:08:00] CD uh uh a a of his singing and playing
[1:08:05] it would be a great benefit and blessing
[1:08:07] in my life I'm looking forward to a time
[1:08:10] that we might be able to have something
[1:08:12] like that um because I think it would be
[1:08:15] a little awkward If he if he came and
[1:08:17] played the piano in my bedroom while I
[1:08:19] sleep I think that'd be that'd be a
[1:08:21] little awkward but uh you know what I
[1:08:24] mean there's just there just certain
[1:08:26] sounds and certain things that unlock
[1:08:29] things in us and uh we're not all
[1:08:32] attracted to the same sounds and that's
[1:08:35] okay there's nothing wrong with that but
[1:08:37] God knows exactly what it takes to
[1:08:39] unlock the gifts that are in your life
[1:08:42] and that's the atmosphere you want to
[1:08:43] get in you want to find yourself in an
[1:08:48] atmosphere that calls forth the seeds of
[1:08:51] your destiny you don't want to sit on a
[1:08:55] pew and rot
[1:08:58] away you want to find a place that
[1:09:00] challenges you and unlocks the gifts
[1:09:03] that are in your life and ultimately the
[1:09:06] choice is yours you make the choice
[1:09:09] isn't that right uh you may be seated
[1:09:12] just a moment if you don't mind to to
[1:09:14] stand in in a in a moment or two when we
[1:09:17] read the word we're so glad to have you
[1:09:19] today uh we are uh so blessed that you
[1:09:23] have sacrificed to come
[1:09:26] and we don't we don't take it for
[1:09:28] granted that you would make this
[1:09:30] sacrifice as some leaving out two and 3
[1:09:33] in the morning to get here and sleeping
[1:09:36] on mattresses and making sacrifices to
[1:09:40] to be with us and we get to go home to
[1:09:42] our comfortable beds and uh some people
[1:09:45] you know are just camping out but we're
[1:09:48] just so blessed and so thankful and
[1:09:50] we're going to do this again in October
[1:09:54] uh someone pulled the Ates for me would
[1:09:56] you I don't have it is it 15th through
[1:09:58] the 20th is that right October 15 16 17
[1:10:03] 18 19 and 20 I'm sorry but that already
[1:10:07] makes me
[1:10:09] tired we will be gathered here for our
[1:10:13] annual camp meeting and we're believing
[1:10:16] that the place will be full not only of
[1:10:18] hungry hearts and Believers but we
[1:10:20] believe the Heavenly Host will crowd in
[1:10:23] with us as well and uh I believe when we
[1:10:26] sing those words it reminds us Angels
[1:10:30] descending bringing from above we we
[1:10:33] don't worship angels we don't pray to
[1:10:36] angels we don't commission Angels but we
[1:10:40] are thankful oh so very thankful if we
[1:10:44] never see an angel it doesn't make any
[1:10:47] difference whether you see him feel them
[1:10:50] smell them sense them I don't care it's
[1:10:53] knowing by faith according to the
[1:10:56] promise of the word that you never go
[1:10:58] without them they're there he said he
[1:11:00] would give his angels charge over us to
[1:11:04] keep us and to protect us they not only
[1:11:07] go to church with us but they go to town
[1:11:10] with us and they go to work in the field
[1:11:12] with us or on the job I'm thankful that
[1:11:15] we are well covered and protected amen
[1:11:19] and sometimes it's just good to be
[1:11:21] reminded uh there are a number of
[1:11:25] Heavenly Host all kinds of divisions of
[1:11:29] the Angelic that we will only understand
[1:11:32] in in their fullness when we stand where
[1:11:35] they stand in the presence of the Lord
[1:11:38] they're very interested in what's going
[1:11:40] on in your life and their fact there's a
[1:11:43] they struggle just a little bit because
[1:11:45] the Bible tells us they long they long
[1:11:49] they look for the understanding that you
[1:11:52] have you know I don't want to call it
[1:11:55] jealous but they're they're they're a
[1:11:56] little stirred up because you carry a
[1:11:59] revelation that they don't carry you've
[1:12:02] got something angels have desired to
[1:12:04] have you you the word has been unlocked
[1:12:08] for you it isn't that a blessed thing
[1:12:10] Jesus is no longer standing behind a
[1:12:13] lattice and you're just catching little
[1:12:15] little pieces of him but he has now made
[1:12:18] himself fullface known to his little
[1:12:21] bride and we're learning of him oh my
[1:12:25] don't don't get to the place where you
[1:12:27] think you know it all and you don't need
[1:12:29] to keep learning of him we're told that
[1:12:32] even in eternity he will continue to
[1:12:35] unveil himself woo that's a multifaceted
[1:12:39] God that it would take all of eternity
[1:12:42] for us to learn of him to know his ways
[1:12:45] and to know who he is we're not just in
[1:12:47] love with what he does we're in love
[1:12:50] with who he is he is faithful in and
[1:12:53] true in every way uh we want to just
[1:12:56] mention a few uh little things here the
[1:12:59] birthdays for the week of the local
[1:13:01] assembly like we would normally do on a
[1:13:03] Sunday uh brother Billy is today would

[1:13:17] on this day many years ago she was born
[1:13:20] now she has made the Great Escape From
[1:13:24] Time

[1:13:30] eternity you know and a and and where
[1:13:32] would she get the
[1:13:34] calendar because that is eternity there
[1:13:38] oh Hallelujah but we like to remember
[1:13:41] that her life made a difference in our
[1:13:43] lives not just of course she certainly
[1:13:46] made a difference in Billy's life she
[1:13:48] brought him here by the grace of God but
[1:13:50] she made a difference in our lives as
[1:13:52] well tomorrow uh is is a special
[1:13:56] birthday uh and it is Marybeth Marybeth
[1:14:01] hawken's birthday uh we are blessed

[1:14:36] especially thankful for Mary Beth I
[1:14:38] really really am and so just really want
[1:14:41] to give God praise for her life and uh
[1:14:45] she has like all of us made sacrifices
[1:14:48] along the way to be where she is today
[1:14:51] and you can never outgive the Lord you
[1:14:54] you never can and tomorrow is Sister
[1:14:57] Teresa's excuse me Tuesday the day after
[1:15:00] Monday Tuesday is Sister Teresa's
[1:15:03] birthday and she's a mother to many and
[1:15:07] uh she is not only a mother to her
[1:15:09] natural-born children but she has a
[1:15:12] number of stepchildren that she's a
[1:15:14] mother to and then she has uh son in
[1:15:17] loves or or daughter how however that
[1:15:20] works uh I I hate to say in-laws Outlaws
[1:15:24] but her children have spouses and she
[1:15:26] mothers them and uh I'm thankful for
[1:15:30] their life I'm thankful that they're
[1:15:33] here and I'm thankful that they add to
[1:15:36] this body uh really add to this body and
[1:15:41] when they all decide to go on vacation
[1:15:43] together we feel it we're a third
[1:15:47] empty and we miss them and yet you know
[1:15:51] in some situations when there's a family
[1:15:54] so big in a church that family tries to
[1:15:57] run the church or push the pastor or uh
[1:16:01] threaten him you know and they've never
[1:16:04] done anything of the sort they've just
[1:16:07] they've just served and I'm so thankful
[1:16:09] for them and on Wednesday of this week
[1:16:13] we have just remembered our brother uh
[1:16:16] Benny West his his uh birthday if he
[1:16:19] would have remained here with us but uh
[1:16:21] he also left us to another land and this
[1:16:25] coming week on Wednesday brother and
[1:16:27] sister West would have an anniversary
[1:16:30] sister West will still remember that day
[1:16:32] they were married in
[1:16:34] 1955 if I've done the math right that
[1:16:37] means that if he would have lived they
[1:16:38] would have had 69 years together on this
[1:16:41] Earth I know she still misses him
[1:16:44] extremely so but she's just closer we're
[1:16:49] all just closer to Eternity where we'll
[1:16:52] be together forever and ever and uh then
[1:16:56] on Friday of this week uh my grandmother
[1:16:59] that I remember so much her her gift of
[1:17:02] faith she taught me to have a prayer
[1:17:05] life and how important it was to have a
[1:17:07] prayer life and I often look down at
[1:17:11] Elana and I think oh I wish my big mama
[1:17:14] was here that's what I called her I wish
[1:17:17] my big mama was here to see this sweet
[1:17:19] baby girl uh perhaps she looks over the
[1:17:22] balcony of heaven and I know that she's
[1:17:25] getting anxious for me to come and I'm
[1:17:27] getting anxious to
[1:17:29] go oh yes I have just about more over
[1:17:34] there than we have over here and it's
[1:17:36] real it's real I'm so thankful that the
[1:17:39] enemy has not been successful in trying
[1:17:42] to talk us out of our our revelation of
[1:17:46] Eternity it's real it's more real than
[1:17:49] the realm we're living in right now more
[1:17:52] real than the realm we're living in
[1:17:54] right now now so would you stand and let
[1:17:56] me read the word of God uh into your
[1:17:59] life and uh thank you for your patience
[1:18:02] last night and I I have had some good
[1:18:05] testimonies this morning already that
[1:18:07] some have found a breakthrough in their
[1:18:09] life I'm I'm always thankful when I hear
[1:18:12] that some people almost apologize for
[1:18:15] saying it and they say you know I I know
[1:18:17] I've said before that I've had a
[1:18:19] breakthrough but but I've really had a
[1:18:22] break I'm just going to thank God you
[1:18:23] had one every time
[1:18:25] there's just lots of things to get
[1:18:27] through the enemy is constantly laying a
[1:18:30] ceiling over your head he's always
[1:18:32] building something over you and you're
[1:18:35] breaking through it Hallelujah I feel
[1:18:38] sorry for people that don't understand
[1:18:40] how important it is to create an
[1:18:42] atmosphere for him to come in with their
[1:18:45] praise if I I as we were worshiping the
[1:18:49] Lord it just made me want to I wanted
[1:18:52] something to pour out I wished I would
[1:18:54] have had something literal that I could
[1:18:57] have just poured out on him I do but
[1:19:00] that's not how it works it's our love
[1:19:03] and our praise and our worship and our
[1:19:06] adoration that we pour out on him we're
[1:19:08] anointing his feet do you know it's
[1:19:11] important to anoint him with your praise
[1:19:14] with your tears with your with your
[1:19:17] Thanksgiving more than anything else in
[1:19:19] this hour we want to keep our Spirits
[1:19:22] right
[1:19:25] oh yes you can have the right Doctrine
[1:19:27] and have a wrong spirit and miss your
[1:19:30] visitation so you want to ask the Lord
[1:19:33] daily Lord keep my spirit right help me
[1:19:38] renew in me uh a right spirit and and he
[1:19:43] will doesn't he do it isn't he faithful
[1:19:47] okay uh in Exodus chapter 34 would you
[1:19:51] go back there with me today let me read
[1:19:54] these uh three verses and then I will
[1:19:59] very soon take us in a slightly
[1:20:02] different direction we are still
[1:20:07] remembering this word of Our Lord that
[1:20:11] our love grows cold because iniquity
[1:20:15] abounds and we want to warm it up we we
[1:20:19] really want to have a love affair with
[1:20:22] Jesus Christ there's so many things
[1:20:24] vying and fighting for our attention and
[1:20:28] we want him to be our number one in in
[1:20:31] every situation is that right and the
[1:20:33] Lord descended in the cloud and stood
[1:20:37] with him there and proclaimed the name
[1:20:41] of the Lord the the yod V the name of
[1:20:46] the Lord and the Lord passed by before
[1:20:49] him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God
[1:20:55] merciful and gracious longsuffering and
[1:21:00] abundant in goodness and true I I want
[1:21:04] us to do that quickly again the Lord the
[1:21:07] Lord God merciful and gracious
[1:21:11] longsuffering and abundant in goodness
[1:21:14] and Truth he never runs out Hallelujah
[1:21:18] we could never exhaust his
[1:21:21] supply thank you Jesus keeping Mercy for
[1:21:25] thousands forgiving
[1:21:27] iniquity and
[1:21:29] transgression and sin and that will by
[1:21:33] no means clear the guilty that means
[1:21:36] you've got to do something to initiate
[1:21:38] the
[1:21:39] clearing repentance visiting the
[1:21:42] iniquity of the fathers upon the
[1:21:44] children and upon the children's
[1:21:46] children unto the third and to the
[1:21:49] fourth generation now that's just the
[1:21:52] word of the Lord Romans 23 for all all
[1:21:57] have sinned for all have sinned and come
[1:22:01] short of the glory of God how many of
[1:22:04] you know all means all that's all father
[1:22:08] we are grateful that your presence
[1:22:11] surrounds us even now and we thank you
[1:22:14] that every Spirit every demonic power is
[1:22:18] subject to the authority of Jesus Christ
[1:22:22] in the lives of the Believers and we
[1:22:25] take that right now we take spiritual
[1:22:28] jurisdiction we take spiritual
[1:22:31] jurisdiction over this house in the name
[1:22:35] of the Lord Jesus Christ a and we demand
[1:22:39] that every opposing Spirit bow to his
[1:22:43] authority in the life of the believer
[1:22:46] you will neither distract or
[1:22:49] dissuade your your sting is taken from
[1:22:53] you and you must leave this atmosphere
[1:22:57] for the glory of God to fill the house
[1:23:01] there's no room for anything else other
[1:23:04] than the light of God's truth so we ask
[1:23:06] that you help us now to use the gift of
[1:23:09] faith that you've given to every man
[1:23:11] that we could pull on the word pull on
[1:23:14] the gift of God in this house that you
[1:23:17] might speak to us that you might give us
[1:23:19] both answers and correction that you
[1:23:22] might would bless us and challenge us
[1:23:25] Lord Jesus we submit uh to the word of
[1:23:29] God that it would just come and
[1:23:32] surgically improve who we are cutting
[1:23:36] out what is what is foreign what is a
[1:23:40] trespassing Spirit cutting it out the
[1:23:44] root of all bitterness cutting it out so
[1:23:47] that the healing bomb of Gilead and the
[1:23:50] life of the Lamb could come and fill in
[1:23:53] every void Hallelujah
[1:23:55] Hallelujah Lord I pray right now that
[1:23:57] any void that has been created because
[1:24:01] we repented of generational iniquity
[1:24:04] last night any void any empty spot we
[1:24:09] pray right now that the holy spirit of
[1:24:12] God would rush into that place in us to
[1:24:16] the inner recesses of the Hidden man and
[1:24:19] that you would expand Who You
[1:24:23] Are we give you full sway we give you
[1:24:27] full Dominion Lord over all of our Lives
[1:24:31] we Grant you permission it's what you
[1:24:33] told us really scripturally we must do
[1:24:36] we Grant you permission to come and take
[1:24:39] up full Abode in our lives have your way
[1:24:43] Lord we turn our stopwatches off and we
[1:24:47] say come and have your way so that when
[1:24:50] we leave here today we don't leave here
[1:24:53] like we came
[1:24:54] but we leave here better off and Fuller
[1:24:58] of your glory truth and we'll give you
[1:25:02] praise and honor and glory for it's in
[1:25:05] the name above every name the name of
[1:25:07] the Lord Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah
[1:25:10] that we pray and the Saints of the most
[1:25:12] high God
[1:25:14] said amen so be it you may be seated may
[1:25:17] the Lord bless you uh in a mighty mighty
[1:25:21] way God is good to us isn't he so we we
[1:25:25] spoke last evening extensively on the
[1:25:29] different applications of sin that are
[1:25:33] outlined for us in the Bible sin being
[1:25:36] almost a surface uh a marring of the
[1:25:41] surface and we we pray and we it can
[1:25:45] even be a one-time thing we pray we we
[1:25:49] repent we ask for forgiveness the blood
[1:25:52] comes the the sin is B Ed the sin is
[1:25:55] covered and it's as though we can just
[1:25:58] wipe it off because the penalty has
[1:26:00] already been uh paid the price The
[1:26:04] Ransom is paid now when we don't do
[1:26:07] anything about our unbelief it moves
[1:26:11] deeper into the recesses of who we are
[1:26:15] and it changes Us in sort of a way that
[1:26:19] we start making decisions and choices we
[1:26:23] we start Mak making room for our sin
[1:26:26] instead of making room for our savior
[1:26:29] and that means that it takes a deeper
[1:26:32] hold in our life and we call that
[1:26:35] transgression and that transgression is
[1:26:38] a willful
[1:26:40] act it's you know I know what you said I
[1:26:44] know what is right and you you would
[1:26:47] think that nobody would have such an
[1:26:49] attitude especially in this house but
[1:26:52] but yet people get that attitude to I
[1:26:54] know what's right I know what I ought to
[1:26:57] do but I'm going to do what I
[1:26:59] will you see it's not even that that
[1:27:03] every man is doing what's right in his
[1:27:04] own eyes that's out there but but in
[1:27:08] here we know better that's right you see
[1:27:10] you'll never be able to make your
[1:27:12] excuses before the Lord because you know
[1:27:15] better once your eyes have been
[1:27:18] enlightened once you have partook of
[1:27:20] that Heavenly gift once the blood of
[1:27:23] Jesus has been applied to your life in
[1:27:25] truth you can never claim ignorance
[1:27:29] again well I didn't know they say well I
[1:27:32] didn't know yes you knew yes you knew so
[1:27:35] mark this down whatever befalls your
[1:27:38] life whatever comes in the future just
[1:27:40] remember you were marked with a
[1:27:44] price the price of the High Calling of
[1:27:47] Jesus Christ and you can't invent your
[1:27:50] own
[1:27:51] faith you can't invent your own way to
[1:27:55] approach God if if you're going to
[1:27:57] approach him in worship or in the word
[1:28:01] there's only one way to do it and that's
[1:28:02] in
[1:28:05] spirit
[1:28:06] Spirit and in
[1:28:09] truth and we've got to have them both
[1:28:13] you see they're not Polar Opposites of
[1:28:15] one another you see really we could say
[1:28:18] that that word that went out from the
[1:28:20] logos we could call that spirit
[1:28:24] because it was Spirit originally but it
[1:28:28] went out as a as a word a decree a
[1:28:32] declare h a declaration from the Lord so
[1:28:35] it's not as though it's something
[1:28:37] entirely different they work together
[1:28:39] because the essence of them is the same
[1:28:42] word and spirit and and without both
[1:28:46] you've just got some substitution
[1:28:48] somewhere and it may appease your
[1:28:51] conscience but we're going to find out
[1:28:53] one day when we stand before him we have
[1:28:55] no excuse we have no excuse well
[1:28:58] somebody hurt my feelings well you're
[1:29:00] not alone in that well my parents didn't
[1:29:04] do everything right well you're not
[1:29:05] alone in
[1:29:06] that well I got looked over on my job
[1:29:09] well you're not alone in that you see
[1:29:12] anything you've walked through somebody
[1:29:14] else has walked through a pretty dark
[1:29:16] road too so we just know that it's by
[1:29:20] grace that any of us yes could get up
[1:29:24] above our stuff to get into the presence
[1:29:28] of the Lord amen the devil will try to
[1:29:31] make you think the grass is greener over
[1:29:34] on somebody else's
[1:29:40] lawn should I tell a story should I tell
[1:29:43] a granny story I've told it before it's
[1:29:46] not in the notes but my grandmother you
[1:29:49] know you remember what happened in my
[1:29:51] family oh so many years ago on a Christ
[1:29:54] Christmas Eve when the presence of God
[1:29:57] unannounced no one was praying but the
[1:30:00] Holy Ghost came in that big old
[1:30:02] farmhouse uh down near Highway 10 and
[1:30:06] between kton and clo Alabama just came
[1:30:09] in like a fire of God and people were
[1:30:13] slain out in the floor as the spirit of
[1:30:17] God showed up and my grandmother
[1:30:19] testified and I was able to meet some of
[1:30:22] those nieces and nephews now grown
[1:30:25] married and had children of their own
[1:30:27] who come up off the floor speaking in
[1:30:30] tongues and had never been in a
[1:30:32] Pentecostal service in their life had
[1:30:35] never seen it and you've heard me tell
[1:30:38] about my my grandmother's brother-in-law
[1:30:41] who was a Baptist preacher who took
[1:30:43] every opportunity that he had to tell
[1:30:46] people there's n no such thing there's
[1:30:48] nothing to speaking in tongues it it's
[1:30:51] it's of the devil it's not of God God
[1:30:54] and uh he always wanted to pick a fight
[1:30:57] or pick an argument with anybody
[1:30:59] anywhere that that had any connection to
[1:31:02] to Holiness people or Pentecostal people
[1:31:05] but when the spirit of God
[1:31:07] fell he he changed his mind in a
[1:31:10] hurry and my great grandmother Lizzy who
[1:31:14] had been told you can't pray unless you
[1:31:17] enter into a closet but there were no
[1:31:19] closets in her country Farmhouse there
[1:31:22] were only chifferobes or
[1:31:25] wardrobes you know pieces of furniture
[1:31:28] homemade and she said I can't get in
[1:31:31] there so I must not be able to pray she
[1:31:34] was that plain that simple that she
[1:31:36] thought if I can't shut the door I can't
[1:31:39] pray she didn't understand it was a door
[1:31:41] of her heart but when the Holy Ghost
[1:31:44] fell she went running through the house
[1:31:46] clapping her hands and she was screaming
[1:31:49] I wasn't even praying and he reached
[1:31:52] down and saved me
[1:31:55] and coming along behind her was my was
[1:31:58] my grandmother's brother-in-law who said
[1:32:00] there's nothing to this Holy Ghost he
[1:32:02] was running right behind grandmother
[1:32:05] clapping his hand saying people this is
[1:32:07] real people this is real people this is
[1:32:10] real you see you've just got to have an
[1:32:13] encounter with the real well well
[1:32:16] preacher don't you know there's a lot of
[1:32:18] fanaticism out there I do a lot of
[1:32:21] counterfeit out I do I know there but
[1:32:24] because there's counterfeit it reminds
[1:32:27] me that there is also a
[1:32:31] genuine praise be to God you you can't
[1:32:35] counterfeit a dollar bill if there's not
[1:32:37] a good one somewhere for you to make a
[1:32:40] copy of so it doesn't matter to me about
[1:32:43] the fanaticism of denominational
[1:32:46] Pentecost Etc I can't help what has
[1:32:49] happened or what will happen in the
[1:32:51] future but I know that I know that I
[1:32:53] know that I
[1:32:55] know so it wasn't too long that one of
[1:32:58] my grandmother's sisters she got slack
[1:33:01] because remember in that service that
[1:33:04] night the Holy Ghost gave a message in
[1:33:06] Prophecy my grandmother was laying on
[1:33:08] her back under the power of God and a
[1:33:11] prophecy came out of her mouth and said
[1:33:14] build me a church on Highway 10 and call
[1:33:18] it Shiloh and I will meet my people
[1:33:21] there powerful it wasn't in anybody's
[1:33:25] mind to do such a thing as that but the
[1:33:27] church was built a brush Arbor first and
[1:33:30] then a church and the whole family came
[1:33:33] and all the neighbors came and it wasn't
[1:33:36] long before the brush Harbor wasn't big
[1:33:38] enough and they added on to the brush
[1:33:40] Harbor and finally built the block
[1:33:42] Church uh that has been remodeled and
[1:33:45] sits there on the highway today just
[1:33:48] like it did back then but it wasn't long
[1:33:51] before one of my grandmother's sisters
[1:33:53] she had 15 brothers and sisters and one
[1:33:56] of the sisters got slack and just
[1:33:58] decided that she she would just talk to
[1:34:01] the Lord on her front porch and she
[1:34:04] didn't have to come to church to to be
[1:34:06] with God she she could just sit right on
[1:34:08] her porch on a Sunday and and be right
[1:34:11] with God and my grandmother would say to
[1:34:13] her uh uh I'll come and pick you up you
[1:34:17] won't even have to run out your gas but
[1:34:19] I really want to see you in the house of
[1:34:22] the Lord you'll gain so much strength if
[1:34:24] you come in fellowship with brothers and
[1:34:26] sisters of like faith and she began to
[1:34:29] make excuse after excuse after excuse
[1:34:32] and finally she said well Mildred I
[1:34:35] can't come to church I bought me a
[1:34:41] cow my grandmother said sis half the
[1:34:45] church members have
[1:34:48] cows and their cows don't keep them from
[1:34:50] church oh she said this cow of mine I I
[1:34:54] it keeps getting out and she said I I
[1:34:56] can't afford for it to get out and eat
[1:34:58] the neighbor
[1:35:00] gladiolas so she said I've got to sit
[1:35:02] home and watch that cow and and week
[1:35:05] after week my grandmother would stop to
[1:35:07] take her to church and she'd be sitting
[1:35:08] there in her in her house coat she said
[1:35:11] I can't go mild I got to watch my cow
[1:35:13] got to watch my cow my grandmother said
[1:35:15] one day she heard that till she thought
[1:35:17] she would just be sick and she spun
[1:35:19] around she was on the way to the car and
[1:35:21] she spun around and she said sister I
[1:35:24] tell you what if you don't quit making
[1:35:29] excuses God will take your
[1:35:33] excuse she said I didn't even know I was
[1:35:36] saying such a thing as that she said I
[1:35:39] didn't intend to I wasn't
[1:35:41] mad I'd come to I'd come to understand
[1:35:44] she just wasn't going but she said it
[1:35:47] must have been some inspiration to just
[1:35:49] come pouring out of my mouth so you know
[1:35:52] they didn't all have telephones so she
[1:35:54] didn't hear from her through the week
[1:35:56] but next Sunday she said I think I'll
[1:35:58] I'll stop and see if she'll go to church
[1:36:00] with me this morning she she said I
[1:36:03] pulled in and there she stood she'd
[1:36:06] already come down off the porch and was
[1:36:08] standing there on the little walkway
[1:36:10] ready to get in had her purse under her
[1:36:12] arm she said uh oh you're going to
[1:36:15] church with me this morning and she said
[1:36:18] I sure am and I'm going next Sunday
[1:36:21] too and the Sunday after that fact she
[1:36:24] said when the doors open from here on
[1:36:26] out I plan to be there if God will be my
[1:36:29] help so as they drove on to church she
[1:36:32] said mild you'll never believe what
[1:36:33] happened you had not been gone from here
[1:36:36] but a few
[1:36:37] minutes she said I am sitting here
[1:36:40] watching my
[1:36:41] cow she said every move she made I
[1:36:45] watched her I don't know how many times
[1:36:48] I had seen her stick her head through
[1:36:52] the wire to get the grass on the other
[1:36:55] side of the fence she said every day
[1:36:59] dozens of times she would work her way
[1:37:02] down that fence stick her head through
[1:37:05] the wire and get her some grass to chew
[1:37:08] on because they had kind of finished up
[1:37:10] what was on that side of the field she
[1:37:13] said but this day last Sunday I watched
[1:37:17] her do what I had seen her do dozens of
[1:37:20] times before she she moved down just a
[1:37:23] little bit she reached her head through
[1:37:26] the wire and she said I don't know what
[1:37:29] happened it was as though somebody took
[1:37:31] the cow and flipped her over she said
[1:37:34] she must have stumbled but I didn't
[1:37:36] really see her stumble I just saw her
[1:37:39] flip and there she
[1:37:41] lay she said I went out and she had
[1:37:44] broke her neck in the fence wire the
[1:37:49] same little place and she said I had to
[1:37:51] call the neighbor to come and put her
[1:37:53] out of her misery I couldn't stand to
[1:37:55] see her suffer like that she said and
[1:37:57] Mild it's your
[1:38:00] fault you owe me a
[1:38:03] cow because you said if I didn't quit
[1:38:06] making excuses God would take my excuse
[1:38:10] did you get the
[1:38:11] point he knows how he knows how so we we
[1:38:16] were talking last night about that
[1:38:18] generational iniquity and how how it
[1:38:21] comes down and I read you two quotations
[1:38:24] in the end from Brother brandham Where
[1:38:26] he talked about the sickness that has
[1:38:29] come on you it's because of sin but it
[1:38:31] may not be your sin at all it may be the
[1:38:34] sin of your father it may have come down
[1:38:37] through the generations and uh there's a
[1:38:40] remedy for it praise the Living God but
[1:38:43] but you may not understand it because
[1:38:45] you you know you're not guilty of
[1:38:47] something like that I I want to to give
[1:38:49] you these verses this morning Leviticus
[1:38:52] chap
[1:38:54] 26:
[1:38:56] 40-42 this is the answer this is the
[1:38:59] remedy you can get out from under the
[1:39:01] burden of the past are you listening it
[1:39:04] says and this is the new verse that I
[1:39:06] that I uh uh that I gave you I think if
[1:39:10] they shall confess their
[1:39:14] iniquity and someone say and that's a
[1:39:18] conjunction we're joining two thoughts
[1:39:20] together and the iniquity
[1:39:23] their so if they shall confess their
[1:39:26] iniquity the deep-seated iniquity and
[1:39:30] the iniquity of their fathers with their
[1:39:33] trespass which they trespassed because
[1:39:37] remember sin was strengthened unbelief
[1:39:41] was strengthened until willful sin
[1:39:43] became a trespass and trespass was left
[1:39:47] unrepented of until it rooted itself as
[1:39:51] an iniquity that would not not only
[1:39:53] affect you as an individual but
[1:39:56] generations to come if they shall
[1:39:58] confess their iniquity and the iniquity
[1:40:00] of their fathers with their trespass
[1:40:03] which they trespassed against me and
[1:40:05] that also they have walked contrary unto
[1:40:10] me
[1:40:16] Hallelujah verse
[1:40:20] 41 and and that I have also excuse me
[1:40:24] and that I also have walked contrary
[1:40:27] unto them and brought them into the land
[1:40:30] of their enemies if then their
[1:40:33] uncircumcised Hearts be
[1:40:36] humbled listen now and they even accept
[1:40:41] of the punishment of their iniquity that
[1:40:43] means they're they're willing to say oh
[1:40:45] god there may be there may be some
[1:40:48] consequences involved in
[1:40:51] this I'm sorry but there may be some
[1:40:54] consequences sometimes involved in these
[1:40:57] decisions to let these things go he said
[1:40:59] if they'll do all of that then will I
[1:41:02] remember my Covenant with Jacob and also
[1:41:05] my Covenant with Isaac and also my
[1:41:08] Covenant with Abraham will I remember
[1:41:11] and I will do
[1:41:13] what a nation needs to hear this today
[1:41:17] and I will remember the
[1:41:20] land God's made a promise
[1:41:23] if he made it for natural Israel he made
[1:41:26] it for Spiritual Israel you understand
[1:41:29] that don't you you're not just maybe
[1:41:32] you're not the natural Seed of Abraham
[1:41:35] but thanks be to God we're of the royal
[1:41:37] Seed of
[1:41:39] Abraham so if we're willing to own the
[1:41:41] past and repent of the past then we can
[1:41:45] receive the benefit of full Redemption
[1:41:49] and on top of that not only do we stop
[1:41:52] passing down
[1:41:53] that deep rooted desire and
[1:41:58] predisposition toward addictions and
[1:42:00] lust and things of that nature but now
[1:42:04] we have the ability to pass down a
[1:42:07] generational
[1:42:09] blessing that benefits the Next
[1:42:12] Generation and the Next Generation and
[1:42:15] the next generation are you still with
[1:42:16] me so I want to illustrate that for you
[1:42:20] in the message before we move on in the
[1:42:22] message the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:42:25] pull with me
[1:42:26] now this is vital for us to to get
[1:42:29] through this uh in in the baptism of the
[1:42:33] Holy Spirit 1958 he said as we were
[1:42:37] speaking to pick up the little subject
[1:42:39] again just for a minute how the
[1:42:42] illegitimate child could not enter the
[1:42:44] kingdom for 14 Generations 400 years and
[1:42:48] how that the iniquity of the parents was
[1:42:50] visited to the children to the third and
[1:42:52] the fourth generation now remember that
[1:42:54] brother brandham explains to us that
[1:42:58] there is a breaking that takes place in
[1:43:02] that under the New Covenant thanks be to
[1:43:05] God thanks be to God you see we're not
[1:43:08] looking to join a natural priesthood
[1:43:11] we're looking to be a part of a
[1:43:13] spiritual
[1:43:14] priesthood and so he goes on in in this
[1:43:18] and he said also listen also the
[1:43:21] righteousness of parents
[1:43:23] was
[1:43:25] visited he said what you do if there is
[1:43:30] coming tomorrow and you have a great
[1:43:34] grandson
[1:43:36] listen your action today will determine
[1:43:42] what he'll
[1:43:43] be
[1:43:47] then so it's not just
[1:43:50] iniquities that can be passed down in
[1:43:53] generational
[1:43:55] lines but also
[1:43:58] blessings and and
[1:44:01] faithfulness and the characteristics of
[1:44:04] a dedicated Christian I'm up here the
[1:44:08] characteristics of a dedicated Christian
[1:44:11] can also be passed down from generation
[1:44:14] to generation to generation oh come on
[1:44:17] now because remember these things affect
[1:44:21] not only our spiritual life life but we
[1:44:24] learn by science that our DNA and our
[1:44:27] RNA is also affected both by iniquity
[1:44:31] and by righteousness by
[1:44:33] godliness oh my my my my
[1:44:37] my that ought to cause every one of us
[1:44:41] to embrace that promise and do
[1:44:45] everything we can to reverse the
[1:44:48] curse and to put something on the Next
[1:44:51] Generation that will cause caus them to
[1:44:53] run harder after God than you and I have
[1:44:57] run after him is that possible it is it
[1:45:01] is he said so what you do if there is
[1:45:04] coming tomorrow and you have a great
[1:45:06] grandson your action today will
[1:45:08] determine what he'll be then for we read
[1:45:12] in the Bible
[1:45:14] MDC when he met Abraham returning from
[1:45:17] the slaughter of the Kings and Abraham
[1:45:20] the patriarch gave him a tenth a tithing
[1:45:23] of all that he had remember and then he
[1:45:27] said that of tithings that just only
[1:45:30] Levi would accept tithe but he said Levi
[1:45:34] who received tithes paid tithes when he
[1:45:38] was yet in the loins of
[1:45:46] Abraham Levi wasn't a son of Abraham he
[1:45:49] was several Generations removed
[1:45:53] and God credited to Levi's Grace
[1:45:58] account when Abraham was faithful to
[1:46:02] give God his
[1:46:05] portion oh my not getting too much help
[1:46:08] but I'll go on anyway do you realize
[1:46:11] that when you keep Covenant with God you
[1:46:14] are setting up the Next
[1:46:17] Generation to receive the benefit of
[1:46:20] keeping Covenant with a God who cannot
[1:46:24] lie with a God who cannot
[1:46:28] miss his mathematics are impeccable and
[1:46:32] he keeps up with every seed we
[1:46:36] sow and it not only benefits our lives
[1:46:39] now but it has the spiritual benefit of
[1:46:43] blessing our children and our
[1:46:45] grandchildren and our great
[1:46:48] grandchildren so if you're living under
[1:46:51] the guilt of something that you carried
[1:46:54] and passed on remember there is
[1:46:57] redemption there is
[1:47:00] forgiveness by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:47:04] and the curse can be reversed and you
[1:47:08] can pass on the favor and blessings of
[1:47:12] the Lord if my children can be
[1:47:15] predisposed genetically to my
[1:47:20] weaknesses then they can be predis
[1:47:22] exposed genetically to my
[1:47:26] strengths I'm looking at you cuz some of
[1:47:28] you are sleeping and that's okay I know
[1:47:31] you're tired but I I think you should
[1:47:34] hear this I really think you should hear
[1:47:38] this because I think we would not be so
[1:47:41] slack if we really kept in mind that
[1:47:45] what we do now is not only affecting now
[1:47:49] not only affecting us but it's sewing
[1:47:52] something into to the next what if
[1:47:54] they're already born well I want you to
[1:47:55] know what the blood can
[1:47:57] do the blood can rewire you now you just
[1:48:02] get the blood on your life and it can
[1:48:04] shift all kinds of
[1:48:07] things it can cause those negative
[1:48:10] dendrites to burn up in your mind and
[1:48:13] new holy thoughts to replace them my god
[1:48:18] get those negative thoughts out of my
[1:48:20] head and out of my children children's
[1:48:23] head and build new thoughts according to
[1:48:27] the word of
[1:48:29] God hallelujah
[1:48:32] strongholds pulled down and and towers
[1:48:36] of Truth raised
[1:48:39] up God he he has the power to to
[1:48:45] transfigure to to transplant to take out
[1:48:49] the old some of us have been building
[1:48:51] those trees in our brain for so long
[1:48:56] that we revisit them almost on a daily
[1:48:59] basis that old language of accusation
[1:49:02] that Satan has made against us and we
[1:49:05] revisit it and it gets stronger and
[1:49:07] stronger and every time we rethink those
[1:49:10] thoughts they are wired deeper and
[1:49:14] larger in the recesses of our brain and
[1:49:17] in our memory but if the blood of Jesus
[1:49:21] is an agent of full
[1:49:23] Redemption if he can turn everything
[1:49:26] back to the original form if he can take
[1:49:30] us back to God's original thoughts about
[1:49:33] who we are then he can take care of some
[1:49:36] ugly trees growing in your
[1:49:41] head we just need another bite like our
[1:49:45] brother was preach preaching exhorting
[1:49:47] us this morning we just need another
[1:49:49] bite to the Tree of Life anybody here
[1:49:52] yes sir good praise the Lord CU you
[1:49:56] don't get lunch until I'm
[1:49:59] done oh can you catch that brother
[1:50:01] brandom knocks on the pull pit five
[1:50:03] times I'm not sure why we needed to know
[1:50:05] that but we know it now Abraham was
[1:50:09] Levi's great grandson and here Levi at
[1:50:13] least eight or 10 hundred years later
[1:50:16] maybe several hundred I wouldn't know
[1:50:18] just what or how many but would have to
[1:50:20] figure it up through the generation but
[1:50:23] brother brandham knew that Levi was not
[1:50:25] a son of Abraham but Abraham begot Isaac
[1:50:28] and Isaac beg got Jacob and Jacob beg
[1:50:30] got Levi and here Levi Jacob would be
[1:50:34] his father Isaac his grandfather Abraham
[1:50:37] his
[1:50:38] great-grandfather and when Levi was in
[1:50:41] the loins oh
[1:50:44] my when Levi was in the loins of Abraham
[1:50:49] the Bible said he paid tithe
[1:50:53] to MDC the Bible said so that's not
[1:50:57] somebody's interpretation that's what
[1:50:59] the word said so you just remember that
[1:51:04] that you are positively affecting the
[1:51:07] Next Generation by keeping faithful
[1:51:10] Covenant with God not just in your
[1:51:12] giving but in your prayer
[1:51:14] life come on now and and in your desire
[1:51:18] to feed on spiritual things instead of
[1:51:21] fleshly carnal things by making good
[1:51:25] decisions now now one more one more
[1:51:27] place before we move into something else
[1:51:30] Hebrews in in the message Hebrews
[1:51:32] chapter 7 number one paragraph 161 your
[1:51:37] attitude your attitude toward Christ
[1:51:42] let's slow it down your attitude towards
[1:51:46] Christ will make a great
[1:51:50] impression on what your
[1:51:53] children will
[1:52:01] be you know it's powerful because it
[1:52:04] doesn't just have to be natural-born
[1:52:07] children because we're talking about a
[1:52:09] spiritual blessing now that transcends
[1:52:12] the natural come on your life that you
[1:52:16] live before your
[1:52:18] family will make an
[1:52:21] impression on on what your children will
[1:52:25] be if you're one of those people that
[1:52:27] that your first reaction to every bit of
[1:52:30] conflict is I'll just stay home I won't
[1:52:33] even go to
[1:52:37] church you know like you're like you're
[1:52:39] punishing who who are you
[1:52:42] punishing you you're trying to get me
[1:52:44] back by not coming well you know my
[1:52:47] brother sister The Joke is on you
[1:52:50] because you pay more than I do
[1:52:53] it's not really costing me anything but
[1:52:55] an amen and sometimes I just watch you
[1:52:57] sleep anyway when you
[1:53:00] come so that's all it's costing me is an
[1:53:03] amen so you're really the one that that
[1:53:06] is not going to benefit with that kind
[1:53:08] of attitude but listen if your children
[1:53:10] see
[1:53:12] you I've had it I've had them come to my
[1:53:14] office and tell
[1:53:15] me if your children see you treating the
[1:53:20] things of God like that
[1:53:23] before you know it when they've got a
[1:53:25] little conflict in their
[1:53:28] life they'll pout the same way that you
[1:53:33] pouted if you see that let let me just
[1:53:37] encourage you the next time God puts the
[1:53:41] mirror in your face and you see your
[1:53:45] negative way in your children
[1:53:53] he'll do it God will let you see it the
[1:53:57] next time you see your uh uh poor people
[1:54:01] skills or you see your emotions how your
[1:54:06] emotions lead you and you see your
[1:54:08] children being led by their emotion and
[1:54:10] you say
[1:54:11] uhoh now our first reaction is you're
[1:54:14] acting like your
[1:54:17] mother all daddies they just love that
[1:54:20] they just love that
[1:54:22] line they say to their wives you're
[1:54:25] acting like your
[1:54:27] mother they say to their children you're
[1:54:31] acting like your
[1:54:32] mother the reality is the mirror is
[1:54:35] turned and a lot of times we're seeing
[1:54:37] ourselves we don't like what we see in
[1:54:39] them and we don't like where it come
[1:54:41] from the next time that happens to you
[1:54:44] you ought to stop in that moment and say
[1:54:47] to your children I am so sorry amen that
[1:54:52] you have picked that up from me and I am
[1:54:58] going to believe the Lord to break the
[1:55:01] hold of that on both of our lives so
[1:55:05] that you can be set free to go higher
[1:55:08] than I've ever gone come
[1:55:10] on be more dedicated than I've ever been
[1:55:14] but if you keep sweeping that under the
[1:55:16] rug and you're not willing to accept
[1:55:19] your part of the responsibility blame it
[1:55:22] on on your
[1:55:25] mother-in-law see how quiet it
[1:55:30] is then you'll just then you'll just
[1:55:32] continue to pass on the negative I want
[1:55:35] to pass on oh my I want to be a
[1:55:38] worshipper let me give you an example I
[1:55:41] want to be a worshipper so that my
[1:55:43] children will catch that part of my
[1:55:49] DNA I sing God's praises to Elana every
[1:55:53] opportunity I can I sing over her I
[1:55:57] don't I mean I may not sing deep Myster
[1:56:00] songs of
[1:56:03] Revelation but I sing over her you know
[1:56:05] what I sing more than any song I Love
[1:56:10] Jesus better than ice cream ice cream's
[1:56:15] very
[1:56:17] good I love Jesus better than ice cream
[1:56:21] like I know I
[1:56:24] should even when I don't obey him or do
[1:56:28] all the things I
[1:56:30] should I love Jesus better than ice
[1:56:33] cream ice cream's very
[1:56:37] good and she does smile and she doesn't
[1:56:40] know that ice cream is
[1:56:44] good but her daddy will teach her before
[1:56:47] before too long as soon as he
[1:56:50] can I I I want her I I I and you know
[1:56:55] what I'm saying I I want to pass along
[1:56:58] somehow a
[1:57:00] desire to to to make Jesus the cner of
[1:57:06] everything because Oh my he ought to be
[1:57:09] he deserves to be he needs to
[1:57:13] be and I want to pass on to my children
[1:57:16] to to back the
[1:57:20] preacher I I'm going to say something a
[1:57:23] little self-serving here I want my
[1:57:25] children to know that that the gift of
[1:57:27] the preacher operates better in an
[1:57:32] atmosphere where there's a faith
[1:57:36] pool and a
[1:57:39] sium I want them to understand that
[1:57:42] because I'm not one who believes that
[1:57:43] sisters shouldn't say amen I believe
[1:57:46] sisters should say amen I believe they
[1:57:48] can say amen I believe they ought to say
[1:57:51] amen I I don't know how they can keep
[1:57:53] from saying amen because it's the same
[1:57:55] word that Witnesses in their heart amen
[1:57:59] they may not be as loud as some and and
[1:58:01] you know I sometimes people criticize
[1:58:03] because some people are just extra loud
[1:58:06] well you know what if you were if you
[1:58:07] were jumping in there you would know
[1:58:09] what someone else was doing in the first
[1:58:11] place I I want my children to know that
[1:58:13] the anointing is not dependent on their
[1:58:17] amen but their amen builds the
[1:58:20] atmosphere it causes others to start
[1:58:23] saying hey I better listen to that
[1:58:25] there's something here that might help
[1:58:26] me your attitude towards Christ will
[1:58:29] make a great impression on what your
[1:58:32] children will be your life that you live
[1:58:35] before your family will make an
[1:58:37] impression on what your children will be
[1:58:40] cuz the Bible said that he would visit
[1:58:43] the iniquity of the parents upon the
[1:58:45] children to the third and the fourth
[1:58:49] Generations so it's not just the
[1:58:52] iniquity it's not just the negativity
[1:58:56] but it's also the positive oh God wire
[1:59:00] in them the
[1:59:01] hunger and the
[1:59:03] desire and help me to correct my own
[1:59:06] path now we're we're going to move we're
[1:59:09] still talking about the stronghold of
[1:59:11] cold love we're still talking about
[1:59:14] believing for God to warm us up in our
[1:59:17] love for him and and in our love for one
[1:59:20] another but I mentioned to last Sunday
[1:59:23] that I had had an experience with the
[1:59:25] Lord and in that experience there were
[1:59:28] there were three
[1:59:30] Spirits demonic spirits that were um
[1:59:34] emphasized to
[1:59:36] me that we as his bride would be
[1:59:40] contending with in this season of
[1:59:46] proving we're being
[1:59:48] tested we're not only being tested we're
[1:59:50] being judged right the bride is not
[1:59:54] judged at the great white Throne
[1:59:56] judgment the bride is judged now what
[2:00:01] her attitude toward the word is now is
[2:00:05] part of her judgment and how she deals
[2:00:09] with opposition now is part of her
[2:00:12] proving and her testing and her judgment
[2:00:15] by the time we get there we're going to
[2:00:18] sit with him amen hallelujah and
[2:00:22] according to the word judge
[2:00:24] angels and
[2:00:26] Nations the the three Spirits if you
[2:00:30] thank you you have them there three
[2:00:32] spirits that we must contend with in
[2:00:35] this season of proving you might want to
[2:00:36] write them down number one seducing
[2:00:40] spirits and those are lying Spirits yes
[2:00:44] sir they don't tell the whole truth
[2:00:49] ever you you may be shocked to find out
[2:00:52] out that you may be sitting on the Pew
[2:00:55] with someone who never tells and it's
[2:00:58] going to get very quiet I'm prepared I'm
[2:01:02] prepared never tells the whole
[2:01:06] truth about
[2:01:08] anything they they've been
[2:01:11] rewired they've been rewired they can't
[2:01:13] even tell a
[2:01:15] story without embellishing the
[2:01:18] story and if they're ever in a hot seat
[2:01:23] you can hardly find the
[2:01:25] truth in what they say I'm not just
[2:01:27] talking about babies and children either
[2:01:30] I'm talking about
[2:01:31] adults that have been rewired it's
[2:01:34] iniquity that has rewired us to the
[2:01:37] level that that it's easier for some of
[2:01:40] us to to tell a
[2:01:44] lie than to tell the whole
[2:01:47] truth and we have even colorcoded our
[2:01:50] lies
[2:01:53] you know it's not it's it's not a black
[2:01:55] lie I don't know what a black lie
[2:01:57] is it's just a little white
[2:02:00] lie maybe it's a mediumsized white lie
[2:02:04] maybe it's a big old fat juicy white lie
[2:02:08] how many of you would just think that a
[2:02:09] lie is a Lie Is A Lie is a lie and the
[2:02:13] Bible said
[2:02:15] all you're not helping me huh all
[2:02:20] liars will have their place in the Lake
[2:02:22] of Fire and so the enemy desires to
[2:02:27] battle the minds of the bride with
[2:02:30] seducing spirits and some of those
[2:02:33] seducing Spirits are lying
[2:02:37] spirits that want to warp our thought
[2:02:41] process so that we answer when asked
[2:02:45] with a lie instead of the
[2:02:49] truth number two religious
[2:02:52] Spirits religious spirits will operate
[2:02:56] through
[2:02:59] delusions you can be
[2:03:02] 100%
[2:03:04] sincere and
[2:03:06] 100% sincerely
[2:03:10] wrong so your sincerity is not the
[2:03:14] measurement of your
[2:03:18] honesty you may sincerely think that
[2:03:21] you're telling it like it is but you may
[2:03:24] be sincerely wrong and the enemy if he
[2:03:27] can slip a religious spirit in on you oh
[2:03:31] my and it manifest in all kinds of ways
[2:03:35] yes around the message you know it
[2:03:37] manifest like this oh my four they sang
[2:03:40] four four songs The Prophet said three
[2:03:42] songs to prepare our hearts for the
[2:03:44] preaching of the word I'm pretty sure
[2:03:46] there was four and even though they
[2:03:48] didn't
[2:03:49] stop they went right in number
[2:03:53] five you may find it hard to believe
[2:03:56] that there are people around this truth
[2:03:58] that are that religious and that
[2:03:59] dogmatic but I know some of
[2:04:02] them and if I called their name you
[2:04:05] would know some of them it really
[2:04:07] matters to them it reminds me of the
[2:04:11] story that brother Perry green told many
[2:04:14] many times through his life of being at
[2:04:17] the brandom Tabernacle just after church
[2:04:19] order was preached and he said literally
[2:04:23] people were so afraid because of what
[2:04:26] had been said they were so afraid that
[2:04:29] even in the service they would if they
[2:04:32] had to express something to someone they
[2:04:35] would mouth
[2:04:37] it because they didn't want the sound of
[2:04:39] their voice to disturb the atmosphere
[2:04:42] that brother Brandon was trying to
[2:04:44] create and preserve and so after the
[2:04:47] service this night brother Perry green
[2:04:50] grabbed a broom that's just who he was
[2:04:53] and he said I'm going to help the
[2:04:54] janitor clean up because their service
[2:04:57] again
[2:04:58] tomorrow and he said I was being so
[2:05:01] careful because of what I heard and the
[2:05:03] way I saw people responding to what was
[2:05:07] said that I made sure that the broom I
[2:05:11] want you to hear this
[2:05:16] Jennifer when you're sweeping you be
[2:05:19] careful that broom
[2:05:21] he said I didn't want the broom to to
[2:05:25] knock the Pew and make a loud
[2:05:29] noise in the sanctuary cuz that was a
[2:05:32] set aart
[2:05:33] place and he said so here I am you know
[2:05:37] brother green was a was a generous sized
[2:05:40] man and he said I'm trying to work
[2:05:42] myself between the narrow little pews
[2:05:44] with my
[2:05:47] broom and uh I just kind of you know and
[2:05:51] he he said all of a sudden brother
[2:05:53] brandom says Hey Brother
[2:05:59] Perry he said I look up and brother
[2:06:01] brandom is hanging out the study door
[2:06:03] yelling at me across the empty
[2:06:06] sanctuary and he said I
[2:06:11] said he said Hey Brother
[2:06:16] Perry he said what's that I can't hear
[2:06:18] you brother green started walking toward
[2:06:21] him he he said yes sir I I just didn't
[2:06:24] want to be loud in here oh he said I
[2:06:27] just wanted to know if you wanted to go
[2:06:28] to breakfast again in the
[2:06:32] morning brother green said I understood
[2:06:35] that there was a time and a
[2:06:38] necessity and a and a reason yes
[2:06:42] sir that no longer
[2:06:45] applied at the end it was actually okay
[2:06:50] I I could if I would have the Pew I
[2:06:52] wasn't going to run the angel of the
[2:06:53] Lord out of the house people can get so
[2:07:01] religious over and dogmatic do you know
[2:07:04] that old word
[2:07:05] dogmatic that they lose the
[2:07:08] joy and they lose the victory in trying
[2:07:12] to keep the
[2:07:15] rules don't you let a religious spirit
[2:07:18] get a hold of you because it's the worst
[2:07:22] kind of spirit to
[2:07:25] overcome and then number three he
[2:07:29] specifically highlighted for me familiar
[2:07:32] spirits which a lot of people don't
[2:07:34] really understand I want to take a few
[2:07:37] moments this morning to go through some
[2:07:40] of this with you and it won't be perhaps
[2:07:42] as easy as it was last night because
[2:07:44] you're you're a little tired and I get
[2:07:46] it I understand I I get it I understand
[2:07:49] I want you to understand for first of
[2:07:51] all that I if we as the bride deal with
[2:07:55] some of these kinds of spirits in our
[2:07:57] life that try to distract us we must
[2:08:01] understand that the scripture and the
[2:08:04] message has distinguished for us the
[2:08:07] difference between being demonically
[2:08:11] oppressed and being
[2:08:14] demonically
[2:08:17] possessed oppression is when a demon or
[2:08:21] an evil spirit seeks to affect or to
[2:08:24] control an individual from the
[2:08:28] outside possession is when a door has
[2:08:32] been opened and the demon Spirit has
[2:08:35] tried to come in and occupy an
[2:08:38] individual from the
[2:08:40] inside both are biblical and both are
[2:08:45] still uh around we still see the enemy
[2:08:49] working in these ways even in the hour
[2:08:52] that we're living in right now let let
[2:08:54] me show you a quote from aw
[2:08:58] toer it's a powerful
[2:09:02] quotation I hope you won't mind me
[2:09:04] sharing it comes from a book that toer
[2:09:07] wrote called Born after midnight it was
[2:09:10] on the notes from
[2:09:16] today the scriptural way to see things
[2:09:22] is to set the
[2:09:28] lord
[2:09:30] always before us are you
[2:09:34] here put
[2:09:36] Christ in the center of our vision right
[2:09:41] in the
[2:09:43] center and if Satan is lurking around
[2:09:46] how many of you think he probably
[2:09:48] is he will appear on the margin
[2:09:53] only and be seen as but a
[2:09:57] shadow yes on the
[2:10:00] edge of the
[2:10:03] brightness do you understand what that's
[2:10:05] saying it is always wrong to reverse
[2:10:10] this to set Satan in the focus of our
[2:10:14] vision and push God out to the
[2:10:18] margin we must never focus on the the
[2:10:21] darkness we must always focus on the
[2:10:24] light we don't deny that Darkness exists
[2:10:28] we don't deny that Satan exists we don't
[2:10:31] deny that demons exist but we're not
[2:10:33] looking to the demon we're not looking
[2:10:36] to Behold The Darkness we're looking to
[2:10:39] see Jesus in the center of
[2:10:42] everything and the Darkness is over here
[2:10:45] in the peripheral you understand he said
[2:10:49] don't ever do the reverse nothing but
[2:10:52] tragedy can come of such
[2:10:56] inversion the best way to keep the enemy
[2:11:01] out I'm going to get a little stirred
[2:11:04] here in a moment if you don't help help
[2:11:08] me I'm not doing this for my
[2:11:12] health I I it's very important here to
[2:11:16] learn how to keep the enemy
[2:11:18] out and here's how we keep the enemy out
[2:11:22] we keep
[2:11:24] Christ
[2:11:28] in I know the world kind of picks up on
[2:11:30] this old old book that was written in
[2:11:34] his
[2:11:35] steps and the modern Church world for a
[2:11:38] long time they were wearing little
[2:11:40] rubber bands and things that said
[2:11:43] wwjd what would Jesus do I don't think
[2:11:47] you ought to have to tattoo it on your
[2:11:49] arm to remember I think it's as
[2:11:52] Christians we ought to remember when we
[2:11:54] react and respond am I reacting and
[2:11:57] responding because I'm looking at Christ
[2:11:59] in the center of my vision or have I
[2:12:02] become distracted by something else
[2:12:04] that's going on and am I responding uh
[2:12:07] like Christ or am I responding like the
[2:12:10] darkness that's trying to squeeze Christ
[2:12:12] out of my life it's a good thing to ask
[2:12:15] ourselves sometime now look at this he
[2:12:18] said the best way to keep the enemy out
[2:12:20] is to is to keep Christ in it is not the
[2:12:24] praying sheep oh this is so good so good
[2:12:28] it is not the praying sheep that Satan
[2:12:32] fears I'm going to let you all do
[2:12:45] it a Praying sheep can accomplish a lot
[2:12:51] but our ultimate Victory is when we keep
[2:12:53] the shepherd near
[2:12:55] us and we do that by building an
[2:12:59] atmosphere that he's comfortable
[2:13:03] in so I I want to show you the
[2:13:06] difference here quickly in the message
[2:13:08] between
[2:13:10] oppression and and possession in the
[2:13:12] message being led of the holy spirit in
[2:13:15] Minneapolis brother brandham says this
[2:13:17] to a woman in the prayer
[2:13:19] line you believe
[2:13:21] lady if the Lord Jesus will let me know
[2:13:25] what you're here for will you accept him
[2:13:27] as getting what you're after you
[2:13:30] will you have many things one thing you
[2:13:34] have a colon trouble you have a
[2:13:37] gallbladder trouble and you're nervous
[2:13:41] that's right and and then one great
[2:13:45] thing that's bothering you is demon
[2:13:49] oppression
[2:13:51] you always feel
[2:13:54] depressed like the devil's got you or
[2:13:58] something like that you're having a
[2:14:02] spiritual battle aren't you is that true
[2:14:06] he asked her the
[2:14:08] question and especially you get that in
[2:14:11] the afternoon after the dinner or
[2:14:13] something like that in the afternoon
[2:14:15] it's worse than it is for morning that's
[2:14:17] right cuz it makes you all upset see
[2:14:22] what it is it's nervousness
[2:14:25] see it look like there's an enemy
[2:14:30] fighting at you can anybody relate to
[2:14:32] that do you believe that God sent me to
[2:14:35] cast it away from you you do come here
[2:14:39] brother bam said better bow your
[2:14:42] head listen at his prayer our heavenly
[2:14:46] father Satan here trying to come against
[2:14:48] your Holy Spirit why the evil one come
[2:14:52] out of her in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:14:55] the son of God I adure Thee to leave her
[2:14:59] you're exposed Satan you go from this
[2:15:03] woman you're trying to make her commit
[2:15:06] suicide and you leave her in Jesus
[2:15:10] Christ
[2:15:11] name now look at here it's over now yeah
[2:15:14] you know it is is that right raise your
[2:15:16] hand if every worry is gone in that
[2:15:19] moment that may have been the absolute
[2:15:23] truth in that presence all of her
[2:15:27] worries were gone but she might have yet
[2:15:30] to have another battle or two with that
[2:15:33] spirit that was trying to oppress her he
[2:15:36] said you feel fine you're going to be
[2:15:38] all right so just go rejoicing and
[2:15:41] praising the Lord the Lord bless you
[2:15:44] thanks be to God and he goes on oh my
[2:15:46] how people ought to worship him give him
[2:15:48] praise he loves to be worshiped now be
[2:15:51] real reverent brother brandom goes from
[2:15:54] dealing with the woman's
[2:15:57] oppression to treating it like it is a
[2:16:00] possession because he said come out of
[2:16:04] her and we don't know uh this woman and
[2:16:08] we don't know exactly what her need was
[2:16:10] but it clearly indicates to me that a
[2:16:14] Believer even a
[2:16:16] believer can be oppressed of demonic
[2:16:20] spirits that torment the Mind brother
[2:16:23] bham said the greatest battle ever
[2:16:25] fought is fought on the Battlefield of
[2:16:28] the Mind it's the last battle for the
[2:16:32] bride when we come to the victory in
[2:16:35] this we have finished the testing period
[2:16:38] we have finished the proving period when
[2:16:41] we learn to think the thoughts of Christ
[2:16:44] and cancel the enemy's accusations we
[2:16:48] have overcome the last battle of our of
[2:16:51] our life it's over then and we step out
[2:16:55] of here not going anywhere until we can
[2:16:58] possess the thoughts of our own
[2:17:00] mind you're not going to be raptured
[2:17:03] until you can win the
[2:17:05] battle come on of your
[2:17:08] mind if the enemy can press a thought
[2:17:12] into your mind to take you
[2:17:16] out that's exactly what he will do but I
[2:17:19] tell you he is is defeated by the blood
[2:17:22] of the Lamb by the power of the revealed
[2:17:25] word by the name of Jesus Christ he is
[2:17:28] defeated he has been defeated a long
[2:17:31] time he is still defeated he'll be
[2:17:34] defeated
[2:17:36] tomorrow he'll be defeated when the when
[2:17:39] he's cast into that bottomless
[2:17:43] pit and he will ultimately be defeated
[2:17:46] on the other end of that when he is
[2:17:48] loose for a short season
[2:17:51] the reality is he is a created
[2:17:55] being who does not have eternal
[2:17:59] life I'm going to outlive the
[2:18:04] devil sir I'm going to outlive the
[2:18:08] enemy because I have grabbed a hold of
[2:18:12] Zoe
[2:18:14] life the life of God the only soul that
[2:18:19] live lives forever ever is the soul that
[2:18:22] has been possessed by the Zoe life of
[2:18:26] God the enemy knows that and so he can't
[2:18:30] change your
[2:18:31] destiny so he seeks to affect your
[2:18:35] relationship he seeks to cut off your
[2:18:38] fellowship from
[2:18:40] God he seeks to Circle you off like a
[2:18:43] weaker part of the
[2:18:46] fold if the enemy can separate you from

[2:24:18] explode don't confuse emotion with an
[2:24:22] experience don't think because you had a
[2:24:25] feeling that you've had The Full
[2:24:27] Experience there's something deeper that
[2:24:29] takes place when you get that sealing of
[2:24:32] the Holy Ghost it comes in such a manner
[2:24:35] and it's so deep and so powerful that
[2:24:38] your emotions don't even have an
[2:24:39] opportunity to register what God is
[2:24:42] doing on the inside of you so you
[2:24:44] receive the final portion of the Holy
[2:24:46] Spirit without any sensation at all
[2:24:51] it comes so deep that it bypasses the
[2:24:56] soul it bypasses the mind and the will
[2:24:59] and the emotions oh yes and it connects
[2:25:02] with that part of him that's already in
[2:25:05] you come on
[2:25:09] nowall he's all nervous and scared he's
[2:25:11] just mentally shook up it's demon
[2:25:13] oppression when you go to him tell him
[2:25:15] not to worry cuz he's going to get over
[2:25:17] it and you're over yours now your faith
[2:25:19] has made you well God God bless you you
[2:25:21] believe him to be the Christ now you
[2:25:23] know that there has to be some kind of a
[2:25:25] supernatural being here now if you
[2:25:26] believe it's Christ now be real Reverend
[2:25:28] I believe I believe I believe I believe
[2:25:30] it was Christ then I believe it's Christ
[2:25:32] now I believe when we gather together in
[2:25:35] the name of the Lord the Lord is here
[2:25:37] he's with us I believe when we welcome
[2:25:39] the Heavenly Host they're here I believe
[2:25:41] that heaven is constantly trying to
[2:25:43] break through into this
[2:25:45] realm so that you and I can have an
[2:25:48] experience that's deeper than just a
[2:25:50] feeling or a goosebump or a hair
[2:25:52] standing up I want an inner
[2:25:57] transformation that's so genuine and so
[2:26:00] real and so powerful that it can defeat
[2:26:02] the enemy any time and anywhere and
[2:26:04] under any
[2:26:05] circumstances in the message demonology
[2:26:08] thank you for helping me a bit more I've
[2:26:10] often heard people say brother Brandon
[2:26:11] why don't you take the initiative side
[2:26:13] go right out there and just take the
[2:26:15] side and rebuke the
[2:26:16] enemy I was afraid to I maybe had seen
[2:26:20] something that I should not have seen
[2:26:23] and I do realize Friends With all
[2:26:24] sincerity that it's a drama a stage show
[2:26:27] it's not just a drama or a stage show
[2:26:30] we're in church and it's the power of
[2:26:32] almighty God and it's demon spirits that
[2:26:35] are on the people if I tell Christians
[2:26:37] that you know Christians don't want to
[2:26:39] hear it Christians you know people who
[2:26:41] identify as Christian they don't want to
[2:26:43] hear that they can have any kind of
[2:26:44] Torment of demon Spirits they certainly
[2:26:47] don't want to think about possession and
[2:26:49] they rarely want to think about
[2:26:50] oppression but that that Realm of
[2:26:53] Darkness is just as real as the realm of
[2:26:55] the light and lately people are
[2:26:57] beginning to understand and I've had
[2:26:59] people say to me recently you know I
[2:27:01] don't it doesn't really matter to me
[2:27:02] whether my eyes are open to see Heavenly
[2:27:05] things or not because you've taught us
[2:27:06] that when our eyes are open we don't
[2:27:08] just see the
[2:27:11] light we also see the other
[2:27:15] side and it's true and and we've got to
[2:27:18] know greater is he greater is he greater
[2:27:20] is he we keep reminding
[2:27:22] ourselves he said now I don't say demon
[2:27:25] possession he said you say I got the
[2:27:27] Holy Ghost brother brandom I ain't got
[2:27:29] no demon well I I don't say possession
[2:27:31] it's it's demon
[2:27:33] oppression Satan in the flesh not Satan
[2:27:36] in the spirit now watch that Satan in
[2:27:39] the spirit gives unclean habits and so
[2:27:41] forth and unbelief he said you might
[2:27:44] live just as pure and holy and clean and
[2:27:45] yet be a sinner it's your faith that
[2:27:47] saves you many people they're just as
[2:27:49] pure and clean and yet a lot cleaner
[2:27:51] sometimes than people who profess
[2:27:53] Christian lives but yet would deny the
[2:27:55] Holy Ghost would deny every operation to
[2:27:57] the power of God they're unbelievers no
[2:27:59] matter they're very religious now listen
[2:28:02] and the Antichrist
[2:28:05] Spirit you know we're just sure we'll
[2:28:07] recognize anything that's of the
[2:28:08] Antichrist because we still have a
[2:28:11] denominational mindset sometime that
[2:28:13] tells us that we'll always come and and
[2:28:15] be against
[2:28:17] Christ on now but the reality is that's
[2:28:20] not how the Antichrist Spirit works
[2:28:22] because the mystery of iniquity has been
[2:28:24] in the earth since godliness was was
[2:28:28] showed up in in
[2:28:29] Bethlehem that mystery of iniquity has
[2:28:32] been right there the two seeds the twins
[2:28:34] running right close together and the two
[2:28:38] spirits will be so close together in the
[2:28:41] last
[2:28:44] days that it would deceive the elect
[2:28:51] he said and the Antichrist spirit is a
[2:28:54] very Oh My Eyes Are
[2:28:59] Open I've seen
[2:29:01] better if you knew how many times
[2:29:04] somebody had told me that through these
[2:29:06] 50
[2:29:07] Years brother it doesn't matter now I
[2:29:10] realize now it doesn't really
[2:29:12] matter I realize now God doesn't care
[2:29:15] the way you dress the way you live your
[2:29:16] life what you do he don't care about
[2:29:18] your Hab I realize now I realize now
[2:29:21] that that's not important I realize now
[2:29:23] that that doesn't matter My Eyes Are
[2:29:24] Open I've learned better you know what
[2:29:26] the word said about that kind of a
[2:29:27] spirit ever
[2:29:31] learning amen educated fools amen ever
[2:29:36] learning and never able to come through
[2:29:39] the heart knowledge of the
[2:29:41] truth full of
[2:29:44] information full of
[2:29:46] wwws come on but not full enough of the
[2:29:49] Holy Ghost that's right to recognize
[2:29:51] that Satan is trying to to steal your
[2:29:56] mind and when I was receiving this some
[2:30:00] time back it wasn't what the church was
[2:30:02] going to deal with they're dealing with
[2:30:05] this and more it's what the bride it's
[2:30:07] how the enemy is going to Target the
[2:30:08] bride that's right and if that lid of
[2:30:11] hell is ripped off and tens times 10,000
[2:30:14] times 10 thousands of demon Spirits are
[2:30:16] loose not against the church that's
[2:30:18] already gone
[2:30:20] but against the bride how do you think
[2:30:23] that you're going to have a
[2:30:25] picnic how do you think you're going to
[2:30:27] whistle Dixie in in an hour like this no
[2:30:31] it's a battle brother it's a battle it's
[2:30:33] a battle it's a battle it's a
[2:30:35] battle and and here's the thing you got
[2:30:38] to realize now you can't trust your own
[2:30:40] feelings amen there it is you you can't
[2:30:43] trust your
[2:30:44] feelings they're deceptive
[2:30:58] I feel led I don't feel
[2:31:01] led the thing you need to ask yourself
[2:31:04] is what did the word
[2:31:07] say they get this talk in the modern
[2:31:09] church I don't feel convicted I I don't
[2:31:12] have any conviction over that you know
[2:31:13] what that doesn't amount to a hill of
[2:31:15] beans it doesn't matter whether you feel
[2:31:17] convicted of it or not it doesn't matter
[2:31:19] whether you you think it's wrong or not
[2:31:21] it doesn't matter whether you feel
[2:31:23] guilty of it or not you are not even in
[2:31:25] the equation here if God's word said
[2:31:28] it that settles it and God is not
[2:31:32] obligated to make you feel
[2:31:35] guilty for doing what his word
[2:31:38] said oh my my my my my my my my my my
[2:31:51] well if God don't want me to do it he
[2:31:52] can stop
[2:31:59] me let me spin the
[2:32:03] chamber and hand you the
[2:32:07] gun because that's that that same kind
[2:32:10] of
[2:32:10] spirit that would cause you to play
[2:32:13] Russian
[2:32:14] Roulette put a bullet in the in the
[2:32:17] chamber and spin and Hope
[2:32:21] hear me and hope that you don't have the
[2:32:23] bullet when you pull the trigger that's
[2:32:25] the kind of spirit and attitude that
[2:32:27] causes somebody to say if God don't want
[2:32:29] me to do it he can stop
[2:32:32] me oh he can it's
[2:32:35] true he can but the problem is God
[2:32:39] doesn't Delight in being a
[2:32:42] puppeteer it's not his will to have to
[2:32:44] always pull the strings to get you to
[2:32:46] move or not to move God wanted to come
[2:32:48] and live inside of of you so he could
[2:32:50] lead through you he could lead from
[2:32:53] inside of you Hallelujah he didn't want
[2:32:56] a robot if God would have roed a robot
[2:32:58] he'd have built a robot that had no
[2:33:00] choice and the way some people preach
[2:33:03] predestination you would think that
[2:33:04] there was no choice at all that you had
[2:33:07] no decision at all and that is not what
[2:33:09] the word said it says we did choose but
[2:33:12] he chose
[2:33:14] first you had a choice but he chose
[2:33:18] first
[2:33:20] amen and if he would have wanted to make
[2:33:22] you a robot he could have fixed you so
[2:33:24] that you would have never went the way
[2:33:25] of
[2:33:27] sin but he wanted you to understand what
[2:33:29] Redemption feels
[2:33:32] like he wanted you to know what it means
[2:33:34] to be saved from something and brought
[2:33:37] into something he said that Antichrist
[2:33:40] Spirit let's see what time it is 1 128
[2:33:42] that Antichrist spirit is of very
[2:33:44] religious
[2:33:45] spirit Luke told me last night in a text
[2:33:47] at mine TI was crooked is it crooked
[2:33:52] Now problem was I didn't see the text
[2:33:55] for two hours after I was
[2:34:01] done that Antichrist spirits of very
[2:34:03] religious spirit just to the Mark just
[2:34:05] as religious as it can be the
[2:34:08] Antichrist Jesus even said if it would
[2:34:11] deceive the very elect if possible in
[2:34:13] the last day that's true so then it
[2:34:14] behooves you to know listen listen
[2:34:16] listen listen so then it behooves you to
[2:34:18] know where you're where you're do doing
[2:34:20] where you're
[2:34:26] standing and what you're talking
[2:34:30] to because that Spirit doesn't come in
[2:34:33] and present the opposite of
[2:34:35] Christ it presents another
[2:34:40] Christ and I just have a feeling that if
[2:34:42] you would have had confidence in the in
[2:34:44] the denominational Church's expression
[2:34:46] of Christ you'd have been out there a
[2:34:48] long time before now
[2:34:52] and then in a message the evening
[2:34:54] messenger it's the last quotation in
[2:34:56] this section brother brandom said today
[2:34:58] in my motel there laid a mother out
[2:35:00] there with not enough clothes on to w a
[2:35:02] mus a musket
[2:35:09] shotgun and her husband laying out there
[2:35:12] the same way in that cold
[2:35:15] wind they think their body so
[2:35:18] pretty they have to to show it he said
[2:35:21] don't you realize that's the
[2:35:24] devil Amen Let me see if I can get any
[2:35:26] amens he said don't you realize that's a
[2:35:29] devil that's right stripping their
[2:35:30] clothes only the insane does
[2:35:35] that oh it's
[2:35:38] quiet you know it's biblical though
[2:35:40] because Legion did it because he was
[2:35:43] crazy when he got clothed when he got in
[2:35:45] his right mind he put his clothes on
[2:35:47] didn't he notice we have that that but
[2:35:49] that's called style that's called
[2:35:53] modern we call it the we call it the
[2:35:56] devil he said I got the Bible to prove
[2:35:58] that's a devil it's devil possession
[2:36:01] it's demon possession not oppression
[2:36:05] possession he's got
[2:36:08] you the thing that would make a person
[2:36:10] strip their clothes off and walk up and
[2:36:13] down the street with their honey hanging
[2:36:15] out of their
[2:36:16] clothes or their bosom hanging out of
[2:36:19] their clothes a woman or a man to put on
[2:36:21] a pair of skinny jeans come
[2:36:25] [Music]
[2:36:28] on so that every shape of his body is
[2:36:32] exposed there's something wrong some
[2:36:40] where I saw a m I know I don't say it
[2:36:44] right uh where where someone said it's
[2:36:48] camp meeting time
[2:36:50] it's time to send out a memo to the guys
[2:36:52] on the platform to go and buy bigger
[2:36:57] pants and someone posted
[2:37:01] that we we got to let the musicians know
[2:37:04] I'm not talking about our
[2:37:07] musicians if they're guilty I'm talking
[2:37:09] about
[2:37:10] them but I thought even the this is the
[2:37:13] world out there the church out there has
[2:37:15] to has to send out a memo and say how
[2:37:18] about you folks buying some bigger
[2:37:26] britches he said that's not oppression
[2:37:28] that's not the enemy trying to control
[2:37:30] you from the outside in he he's found a
[2:37:33] throne he sat down on the inside 1
[2:37:37] Timothy 41 and2 now the spirit speaketh
[2:37:41] expressly that in the latter time some
[2:37:44] shall depart from the faith giving heed
[2:37:48] this is where he said we had to be
[2:37:49] careful giving heed to seducing
[2:37:53] spirits and doctrines of devils speaking
[2:37:57] lies in hypocrisy having their
[2:37:59] conscience
[2:38:01] seared with a hot iron can I read that
[2:38:04] in the Amplified thank you but the Holy
[2:38:07] Spirit distinctly and expressly declares
[2:38:10] that in the latter time some will turn
[2:38:12] away from the faith giving attention to
[2:38:15] deluding and seducing spirits and
[2:38:18] doctrines that demons
[2:38:21] teach through the hypocrisy and
[2:38:23] pretensions of liars whose consciences
[2:38:27] have are
[2:38:28] seared as
[2:38:31] cauterized second Timothy 3:13 but evil
[2:38:34] men and seducers shall wax
[2:38:37] worse and
[2:38:40] worse this is 2 Timothy 3:13
[2:38:45] deceiving read it for me and deceiving
[2:38:48] and being
[2:38:50] deceived and here is how a seducing
[2:38:53] Spirit can operate against you as a part
[2:38:55] of the bride of Christ second Timothy
[2:38:57] 215 through1 18 and and we'll see where
[2:39:00] we go from here
[2:39:01] study
[2:39:03] study
[2:39:05] study study that's not
[2:39:08] Google that's
[2:39:10] study that's not Duck Duck
[2:39:13] Go come on that is
[2:39:17] study study to show thyself approved
[2:39:20] unto
[2:39:21] God a Workman that needeth not to be
[2:39:24] ashamed rightly right that that that
[2:39:29] means the spirit is your spirit is right
[2:39:32] because if your spirit is not right you
[2:39:34] will divide the word according to your
[2:39:36] crooked
[2:39:37] Spirit rightly dividing the word of
[2:39:40] truth but shun profane and vain
[2:39:42] babblings for they will increase unto
[2:39:45] more ungodly
[2:39:51] overemphasizing things that matter that
[2:39:53] that really really really really really
[2:39:56] in the landscape of
[2:39:58] Eternity they don't
[2:40:02] matter more than you worrying about
[2:40:05] where where where Cain got his wife or
[2:40:08] where it's there the answer is in the in
[2:40:11] the message but instead of you getting
[2:40:13] so caught up in something like that the
[2:40:16] world you know how they like to get all
[2:40:18] carried away over something something
[2:40:19] like that you better find what
[2:40:22] matters and you better study to show
[2:40:24] thyself approved unto God a Workman that
[2:40:26] needed not to be ashamed rightly
[2:40:28] dividing the word of
[2:40:29] Truth now some of you have been under
[2:40:32] this ministry 30 plus
[2:40:35] years see I came here in 1990 how many
[2:40:38] years ago was
[2:40:40] that 34 years ago and some of you have
[2:40:44] been sitting under this ministry for 34
[2:40:47] years and our EMP is has always been
[2:40:51] take it
[2:40:55] back that's what I heard him
[2:40:57] say take it back to the
[2:41:01] word back to the Bible and somewhere
[2:41:05] along the way this cultish Spirit that's
[2:41:09] right the one that caused people to
[2:41:12] drink the
[2:41:13] Kool-Aid and the one that caused people
[2:41:16] to denominate themselves into little sex
[2:41:19] and groups and separate themselves into
[2:41:21] the jungles of the world that little
[2:41:23] Spirit started
[2:41:25] infiltrating those who had heard and
[2:41:28] recognized the message of a prophet and
[2:41:31] they started giving birth to their
[2:41:33] cultish ways you don't have to say
[2:41:35] anything might be better for you to be
[2:41:38] quiet they started giving in to those
[2:41:41] seducing ways and those cultish spirits
[2:41:45] and even though this word and message
[2:41:47] itself will never be denominated ated
[2:41:49] they they took the fringes of the
[2:41:51] message and they started denominating
[2:41:54] that and trying to make that a Creed
[2:41:56] it's craziness to me that you would try
[2:41:59] to take the revealed word of the hour
[2:42:01] and turn it into some kind of a
[2:42:05] Creed and and then they they weren't
[2:42:09] satisfied that God always uses cracked
[2:42:12] pots that's right just look at the
[2:42:17] disciples broken
[2:42:20] affected by their
[2:42:22] circumstances bruised men imperfect men
[2:42:27] God always uses imperfect people do you
[2:42:30] know why that's the only kind he
[2:42:34] has he uses what he
[2:42:37] has and he uses Us in spite of our
[2:42:43] weaknesses and our and our our our twist
[2:42:46] and turns uh uh the prod of our
[2:42:50] upbringing he he and when man begin to
[2:42:53] try to
[2:42:57] deze the
[2:42:59] messenger and they love to say it in
[2:43:02] their meetings more than a man more than
[2:43:05] a man he was more than a man he was more
[2:43:07] than a man putting this little uh seed
[2:43:12] out
[2:43:13] there that causes people to begin to
[2:43:17] hold on
[2:43:19] to the coattails of a
[2:43:22] man when he himself said don't pay any
[2:43:27] attention to
[2:43:31] me you keep your eyes on the
[2:43:35] Christ you keep your eyes on the word
[2:43:39] but we have a
[2:43:41] tendency to to try to deify our
[2:43:46] leaders and they began to build this
[2:43:50] this uh structure around the edges of
[2:43:54] the truth and and now it is so
[2:44:00] serious that they will take the printed
[2:44:04] uh sermon and hold it up with the Bible
[2:44:09] and say uh both of these are the
[2:44:13] absolute the problem is he didn't say
[2:44:17] that
[2:44:22] any quotation that you can't take right
[2:44:26] back to the
[2:44:29] book you better just leave that
[2:44:34] there because you're not going to be
[2:44:36] able to whip the devil with something
[2:44:39] that's not built on the
[2:44:41] word now I know people don't like this
[2:44:44] kind of
[2:44:45] preaching but that's why so many people
[2:44:48] get shook up in this hour when they find
[2:44:52] out that men have Clay
[2:44:56] feet and they're not perfect and they
[2:44:59] don't have perfect
[2:45:03] recall and they may
[2:45:07] exaggerate you won't shake at all that
[2:45:10] won't even shake you if you're built on
[2:45:13] the right
[2:45:16] foundation if you take your faith right
[2:45:18] back to that word you won't have any
[2:45:21] problem when you discover that your
[2:45:24] pastor is a
[2:45:28] man if you take what he preaches back to
[2:45:31] the word you won't have any problem when
[2:45:33] you find out that he's a man you won't
[2:45:36] have any problem when you find out that
[2:45:39] that Prophet was a man a man sent from
[2:45:43] God but a man his
[2:45:47] flesh was just is
[2:45:51] rotten let's see if I can push that
[2:45:53] Spirit a little
[2:45:54] bit was just as rotten as yours just as
[2:45:58] ju had just as much of a tendency to to
[2:46:01] to to to uh magnify the number of the
[2:46:05] crowd he said
[2:46:07] so I'm not accusing him you know he was
[2:46:10] a
[2:46:14] fisherman he understood how things could
[2:46:17] be and because because we have in our
[2:46:20] mind tried to deify somebody when we are
[2:46:23] face to face with their Humanity we just
[2:46:26] it's just easier to throw the whole baby
[2:46:27] out with the bath water and say it's all
[2:46:30] a lie and there's nothing to it you go
[2:46:32] right
[2:46:34] ahead you you go right ahead and do that
[2:46:36] because if you were born for this
[2:46:41] truth it'll track you down like a hound
[2:46:46] dog I pray I get to see it when it
[2:46:48] knocks you over and licks you in the
[2:46:51] face and reminds you of who you really
[2:46:54] are yes sir and how you've come this far
[2:46:57] by faith not faith in a prophet but
[2:47:01] faith in a word and not faith in a
[2:47:03] printed Bible but faith in the Living
[2:47:07] Word that raises off the pages of that
[2:47:10] Bible and makes Christ a reality in your
[2:47:13] everyday life there will always be a
[2:47:17] seducing spirit yes to whisper in your
[2:47:20] ear sir sir and there will always be a
[2:47:25] poor example before
[2:47:27] you of how to do it wrong and you've got
[2:47:30] to make sure that you keep bringing your
[2:47:33] focus back to Christ but here's the root
[2:47:36] of the problem you didn't
[2:47:42] study you knew the church age book but
[2:47:46] you didn't know the Bible
[2:47:51] am you knew the
[2:47:54] titles of the sermons but you didn't
[2:47:56] know the
[2:47:57] Bible and so basically you were taking
[2:48:00] someone's
[2:48:01] opinion for what the word said and I
[2:48:04] don't say that to be ugly I say that to
[2:48:08] Simply say shame on us shame on any of
[2:48:12] us that wouldn't understand the
[2:48:14] importance of taking people back to the
[2:48:17] foundation yes sir
[2:48:19] say but I couldn't understand it that's
[2:48:21] why we have the Holy Spirit and that's
[2:48:23] why God sent the church age Messengers
[2:48:25] Through the Ages to help po point us and
[2:48:29] help us to focus on thus saith the Lord
[2:48:32] help us to make sure that we don't get
[2:48:34] too far out there because if we let
[2:48:37] Google lead
[2:48:42] us we'll live by
[2:48:45] emotion and here's what people do this
[2:48:47] is so funny so so funny I met some
[2:48:50] people when I was in Salt Lake City that
[2:48:52] I know and have known for some years I
[2:48:55] met them in a in a strange place and I
[2:48:57] didn't I didn't I didn't recognize the
[2:48:59] man if the wife would have been there I
[2:49:01] would have recognized her and and he
[2:49:03] walks up and we start having this
[2:49:05] wonderful conversation and the last time
[2:49:07] I saw him he was all excited about a
[2:49:09] diet that he had found a particular kind
[2:49:11] of eating style that he had found and he
[2:49:14] was so happy and he was preaching it I
[2:49:16] mean he was more passionate about that
[2:49:18] than some people people are about the
[2:49:19] word and he was just pushing and
[2:49:22] preaching and pumping and pimping
[2:49:24] and you know how they
[2:49:26] do and so I just braced myself when I
[2:49:29] recognized who he was and I thought he
[2:49:32] is going to give me The Gospel According
[2:49:34] to
[2:49:37] keto but guess what he's changed
[2:49:41] religions and he's now on the carnivore
[2:49:47] diet so he began to preach to me the the
[2:49:51] glory of eating like a
[2:49:55] carnivore and I'm sitting there thinking
[2:49:57] about some of the things that that that
[2:50:00] cause me the most
[2:50:02] trouble and I'm thinking I don't know if
[2:50:04] I could even do that uh but but he gives
[2:50:07] me a 20 minute sermon and he's calling
[2:50:10] out names for me to go on YouTube check
[2:50:12] it out check it out check it
[2:50:15] out and I'm trying to take these names
[2:50:17] down because I'm I I have no
[2:50:22] intention but I'm trying to look
[2:50:24] interested you know how you do sometime
[2:50:26] in church you're try to look
[2:50:31] interested and I'm trying to follow him
[2:50:33] the best way you got to hear doctor so
[2:50:35] and so and doctor so and so and doctor
[2:50:36] so and so and doctor so and so and
[2:50:38] they've got these Amazing Stories to
[2:50:40] Tell and I said well what about the the
[2:50:41] other doctors that you recommended the
[2:50:44] oh he said they don't know what they're
[2:50:45] talking
[2:50:46] about come on now
[2:50:49] you ever met anybody like that are you
[2:50:51] sitting on the Pew with anybody like
[2:50:53] that they change flavors every time you
[2:50:55] see them oh come
[2:50:58] on this vitamin C is the best so you
[2:51:02] hear them and you order that vitamin C
[2:51:05] and the next time you ask them oh no I
[2:51:07] don't use that one anymore I bought
[2:51:08] another one it's the best It's the Best
[2:51:11] of the Best of the Best of the Best come
[2:51:13] on I got got me some magnesium and it's
[2:51:17] the best of the best of the best of the
[2:51:20] best I just don't know if that's true or
[2:51:23] not and then I was willing to stand
[2:51:27] there for that and then he starts
[2:51:29] talking to me about about the secret
[2:51:31] societies and and
[2:51:34] Nano and and there are no real Jews in
[2:51:37] Israel and on and on on I said come on
[2:51:40] honey I'm ready to
[2:51:44] go you see I realize that we have this
[2:51:47] we have this thing in us sometime that
[2:51:50] we get more excited we get so excited
[2:51:53] about the new
[2:51:55] thing but when somebody meets us later
[2:51:58] we've already gone on they want to know
[2:52:00] about the the old thing that was the new
[2:52:03] thing that's right and we don't remember
[2:52:05] the old thing that was the new thing
[2:52:07] we're now onto a newer newer thing and
[2:52:11] all the doctors that we trusted above
[2:52:13] all the other these three right here are
[2:52:16] now I know I know they don't like I know
[2:52:19] the government is after them I know that
[2:52:22] what they say is the absolute truth and
[2:52:25] then we say what about the oh no no no
[2:52:27] no no I found the three real doctors now
[2:52:31] these real doctors they really know how
[2:52:34] it's all supposed to be how am I
[2:52:36] supposed to have
[2:52:41] confidence to understand them you'd have
[2:52:43] to know what kind of a of a of a ride
[2:52:45] they're
[2:52:46] on Amen
[2:52:50] and uh because they now have confidence
[2:52:53] in this new doctor everything he says
[2:52:56] has got to be the truth I don't think
[2:52:59] I'd believe that if I were
[2:53:01] you cuz they're just practicing medicine
[2:53:04] anyway they're just learning you know
[2:53:07] anyway and when you think you found the
[2:53:09] best I'm going to stick with these guys
[2:53:11] they're going to help me through the
[2:53:12] rest of my life and then now you found
[2:53:14] the best and the new improved version
[2:53:16] and let me tell you something you might
[2:53:18] get by if that's your way of buying
[2:53:22] vitamins and you're choosing keto over
[2:53:25] carnivore and and uh you know whatever
[2:53:28] Atkins used to be the
[2:53:32] thing and then they found out that
[2:53:34] that's not good because you you need
[2:53:36] fruit and you need that in in some
[2:53:39] levels and so they've got new
[2:53:41] improved and you get caught up on that
[2:53:44] and you it's all you talk about and it's
[2:53:45] all you pump and all you all you sell
[2:53:47] and pedal and and so forth and
[2:53:51] Etc you can't let your faith be like
[2:53:57] that if someone can talk you out of this
[2:54:02] message they'll try to talk you out of
[2:54:05] everything they'll tell you the gifts
[2:54:07] are not for today they'll tell you that
[2:54:09] that there's no five-fold Ministry
[2:54:11] they'll they they'll tell you all
[2:54:13] they'll tell you you can't even have a
[2:54:14] personal experience with the Holy Ghost
[2:54:16] they'll tell you that Miracles were only
[2:54:18] for the apostles come on and as long as
[2:54:21] you stick with them you'll follow in
[2:54:23] that train of thought but if you let the
[2:54:25] enemy lead you
[2:54:28] around you'll end up an
[2:54:37] agnostic I knew right away as soon as
[2:54:39] someone starts telling me the Jews are
[2:54:41] not the real Jews I know what's coming
[2:54:43] next I know the next step in
[2:54:46] that we're the real Jews they'll start
[2:54:48] saying we're the scattered tribes of
[2:54:52] Israel and they'll start trying to make
[2:54:55] themselves the natural
[2:54:57] seed I remember when they came around
[2:54:59] and tried to tell us that that uh that
[2:55:02] Charles was the
[2:55:04] Antichrist Prince Charles now King
[2:55:06] Charles is the Antichrist I remember
[2:55:09] when they told us that Ronald Wilson
[2:55:12] Reagan
[2:55:14] 666 I remember when they told us at kusf
[2:55:19] and
[2:55:21] gorbachov and gorbachov even had the
[2:55:23] scar on his
[2:55:27] head and just a few weeks ago the
[2:55:29] picture goes all over the Internet of
[2:55:32] the blood on Donald Trump's
[2:55:35] face and people have introduced
[2:55:40] him as the as the Beast that has now
[2:55:43] received the
[2:55:44] wound so he is the Antichrist
[2:55:52] seducing Spirits right lying Devils
[2:55:56] things that will just pull you away and
[2:55:59] you say I'll never go there let me tell
[2:56:00] you something once you jump in that
[2:56:04] hole it's only God who can pull the
[2:56:06] rains this bride must be on guard we
[2:56:10] must watch for every seduction that the
[2:56:13] enemy would try he cannot change our
[2:56:16] election he cannot change our
[2:56:19] predestination but if he can affect our
[2:56:21] relationship with Jesus
[2:56:25] Christ I always worried about some folks
[2:56:28] along the
[2:56:30] way who got more excited about worship
[2:56:33] than they did the
[2:56:36] word I love worship I preach it I teach
[2:56:39] it and I practice it but it's the word
[2:56:42] that changes
[2:56:46] us if they give worship their full
[2:56:48] attention but use their phone during the
[2:56:54] preaching the enemy is
[2:56:58] subtle musicians are
[2:57:01] coming in a message called father the
[2:57:04] hour has come he said now he thought he
[2:57:07] had the spirit of
[2:57:08] God but it was a lying
[2:57:11] spirit because it was
[2:57:16] contrary to the word
[2:57:19] anybody that tries to tell you there's
[2:57:21] three persons in the godhead they're
[2:57:23] under a lying
[2:57:25] Spirit tell them if they approach you
[2:57:29] with that Doctrine just tell them I
[2:57:30] don't believe that
[2:57:32] lie how do you know that because it's
[2:57:35] contrary to the
[2:57:36] word here o
[2:57:39] Israel he's one
[2:57:42] Spirit somebody said well how many
[2:57:44] persons is he
[2:57:46] one Jesus is not the the second person
[2:57:50] in the godhead he's the only person in
[2:57:52] the godhead he's the only one that had a
[2:57:54] physical body to live in come on now you
[2:57:57] better stay with that word don't you let
[2:57:59] them confuse you with this too God
[2:58:02] mess it's too person mess that they're
[2:58:05] spreading around the truth come on it
[2:58:08] was a lying spirit because it was
[2:58:10] contrary to the word now if people say
[2:58:11] signs and wonders don't follow if they
[2:58:14] say signs and wonders don't follow if
[2:58:16] somebody tells you that signs and
[2:58:18] wonders don't follow the word it's a
[2:58:20] lying
[2:58:23] spirit it's
[2:58:25] contrary to the word to the
[2:58:28] word if the Bible said people tell you
[2:58:31] the Holy Ghost ain't in this day the
[2:58:34] same as it was in the other
[2:58:36] days what kind of spirit is it church
[2:58:39] it's a lying Spirit that's in false
[2:58:46] prophets it's not the it's not the false
[2:58:48] prophets who tell you that God is one
[2:58:50] you need to be worried about it's the
[2:58:51] ones who are telling you that that that
[2:58:53] he's three it's a one it's a people that
[2:58:56] are telling you the Holy Ghost is not
[2:58:57] for
[2:58:59] today it's a lying Spirit that's in
[2:59:04] false prophets they're telling you a lie
[2:59:07] it it all liberation of women and do all
[2:59:11] these other things and go out and act
[2:59:13] like the
[2:59:14] world it's a lying spirit it's not lying
[2:59:18] up with the
[2:59:19] word
[2:59:21] stay
[2:59:22] [Music]
[2:59:25] in all of
[2:59:28] it stay in all of it because according
[2:59:31] to what doctor you're
[2:59:33] following he'll tell you that red meat
[2:59:36] is good or red meat is not good
[2:59:38] and do you remember when we couldn't eat
[2:59:44] eggs and did you know that now the
[2:59:46] carnivore diet at least a modified
[2:59:49] version of the cardor diet is
[2:59:51] encouraging people to eat eggs lots of
[2:59:53] eggs lots and lots and lots of eggs up
[2:59:56] to 10 or 12 eggs a
[2:59:59] day the hens haven't
[3:00:01] changed the eggs haven't
[3:00:04] changed we're listening to other
[3:00:08] doctors so somebody with a deceiving
[3:00:11] Spirit can take a
[3:00:14] scripture lift it out of its context and
[3:00:17] and and to convince you that's why
[3:00:20] you've got to run it all the way
[3:00:24] through takes the Holy Ghost fill us
[3:00:26] fill us Lord may we not have to deal
[3:00:30] with these kinds of spirits in our life
[3:00:32] may we recognize them from the start and
[3:00:34] shut them down if someone comes to you
[3:00:38] and tries to get you to join in with
[3:00:40] their criticism of your
[3:00:43] church you should shut them down right
[3:00:46] away we're not a perfect Church you just
[3:00:49] tell we're not a perfect church but
[3:00:52] we're a church that's got a heart for
[3:00:54] God and I'm not going to listen to your
[3:00:57] criticism if they try to uh persuade you
[3:01:01] away from the message of Truth you let
[3:01:04] them know right now do what you need to
[3:01:06] do what you want to do what you feel to
[3:01:08] do but ask for me in my
[3:01:12] house we're not just a bunch of Dumb
[3:01:15] Bunnies following Shelly
[3:01:18] we had an experience tell them I had an
[3:01:20] experience with God before I came
[3:01:23] here I'm following the same Holy Ghost
[3:01:26] now that I was following way back
[3:01:29] when don't you let that thing don't give
[3:01:31] it an ear don't you let that thing take
[3:01:34] a hold of your life because if you do
[3:01:36] it'll wrap you up right they're telling
[3:01:40] you a
[3:01:42] lie the last and closing
[3:01:48] the second
[3:01:49] seal he said that Spirit speaks
[3:01:51] expressly that in the latter days they
[3:01:54] depart from the faith and would give
[3:01:56] heed to seducing you know what seducing
[3:01:58] is a seducing spirit in the church it's
[3:02:00] clergy yes it is seducing clergy Spirit
[3:02:04] how can you how can you preach that how
[3:02:06] can you say that aren't you aren't you a
[3:02:08] clergy aren't you a preacher I
[3:02:11] am and I don't have any problem saying
[3:02:14] this at all right because the enemy is
[3:02:16] looking for every opportunity he'll use
[3:02:19] whoever
[3:02:20] yields and he knows that the influence
[3:02:23] is often in the pulit so that's where
[3:02:25] those seducing Spirits sometimes try to
[3:02:27] work seducing clergy Spirit working of
[3:02:30] devils hypocrisies in the church he
[3:02:34] high-m minded wisdom you see smart
[3:02:37] intelligent having a form of godliness
[3:02:40] having a form of godliness but denying
[3:02:43] the Revelation the power and the working
[3:02:46] of the spirit
[3:02:51] from
[3:02:55] such for this is the sort that would go
[3:02:57] from house to house and Lead silly
[3:03:00] women that don't mean Holy Ghost watch
[3:03:03] him that don't mean Holy Ghost women
[3:03:06] silly women that's LED away with diverse
[3:03:08] lusts are you with me yes I'm closing
[3:03:12] I'm not nearly
[3:03:14] done I wanted to really to to get to
[3:03:17] that familiar
[3:03:19] spirit because these familiar spirits
[3:03:22] run with
[3:03:24] iniquity and they know more about us
[3:03:27] sometimes it seems that we know about
[3:03:30] ourselves because they observed the
[3:03:32] generation before
[3:03:34] us and they become so
[3:03:38] familiar we we deal with them and deal
[3:03:41] with them until we break that cycle
[3:03:42] through repentance until it's hard
[3:03:46] sometime to even recognize is when
[3:03:48] you're under the influence of that
[3:03:50] thing you see it's not just a familiar
[3:03:53] Spirit as one that works in
[3:03:55] witchcraft but I want you to know that
[3:03:58] there are uh I like to call them some
[3:04:01] people call them monitoring Spirits I I
[3:04:04] I think they move like reconnaissance
[3:04:07] Spirits they they they like to to dig
[3:04:10] what they can
[3:04:13] dig to hear what they can hear to learn
[3:04:17] what they can learn so that they can
[3:04:19] turn that thing around and use it
[3:04:22] against your
[3:04:24] life you see it's not just the spirit of
[3:04:27] the Lord that uh can sometimes discern
[3:04:30] things that are not to be known but
[3:04:32] sometimes familiar spirits can be
[3:04:34] involved and uh people will will kind of
[3:04:38] think that they're operating in a gift
[3:04:40] when
[3:04:41] actually it's a it's a
[3:04:44] spirit that's feeding them information
[3:04:48] and they use that to gain some sort of
[3:04:51] manipulation and influence over somebody
[3:04:53] and we better watch for that kind of
[3:04:56] Seduction because we found a word that
[3:04:58] is strong and is secure and we better
[3:05:01] make sure that we're not giving
[3:05:03] heed to anything that is not of
[3:05:07] God how do I do that stay with the word
[3:05:10] stay in the word Stay full of the Holy
[3:05:13] Ghost let Christ be in the center of
[3:05:16] your vision when darkness comes let it
[3:05:19] let it be over here in the edges of the
[3:05:21] brightness and Brilliance of Christ
[3:05:23] don't don't follow after that refuse
[3:05:27] that that vain uh uh uh uh fables and
[3:05:31] and all the kinds of things that the
[3:05:33] enemy will use to to pull you
[3:05:38] away don't you stick your head in the in
[3:05:42] the
[3:05:43] fence and try to eat the grass on the
[3:05:47] other side of the fence lose your
[3:05:50] balance and break your
[3:06:01] neck I just can't hardly wait until I
[3:06:03] find a perfect
[3:06:07] Church CU When I do I'm going to join
[3:06:13] it why would you want to ruin a good
[3:06:15] thing
[3:06:18] ain't that right why would you and I
[3:06:20] want to ruin a good thing if it's
[3:06:22] perfect we ought to leave them alone
[3:06:24] they don't need our
[3:06:26] problems you're never going to have a
[3:06:28] perfect
[3:06:30] place you're always going to have flawed
[3:06:33] people but oh as long as those flawed
