[0:37] Hello, I'm Pastor Steven Shelley and
[0:39] you're watching the Eagles Cry. I want
[0:42] to welcome you to the broadcast today.
[0:45] For the last few weeks, we have been
[0:48] studying the spirit and power of Elijah,
[0:52] past, present, and future. It's been an
[0:55] amazing study, and I hope that you have
[0:58] gleaned some nuggets of truth that will
[1:01] help prepare you to position yourselves
[1:04] to be one of those anointed with the
[1:07] spirit and power of Elijah. It is a it
[1:11] is a preparatory anointing, an anointing
[1:14] that will enable us to help prepare a
[1:18] people for the Lord. And I just believe
[1:21] that the scripture is so full of
[1:24] interesting nuggets that can be used and
[1:28] applied to our everyday life. You know,
[1:31] it's not just an ancient book of
[1:32] history. It is a living word. And that
[1:37] living word in us by the Holy Spirit is
[1:40] what quickens us to keep coming into
[1:44] alignment and into agreement with all
[1:47] that God has said about our lives. The
[1:49] enemy is always lying to us. Uh Satan is
[1:53] the father of all lies. And if we listen
[1:55] to him and agree with his accusations,
[1:58] we will never rise up into the fullness
[2:01] of our destiny. But if we begin to uh
[2:05] make our minds up, we are not going to
[2:07] agree with the lie of the enemy. Rather,
[2:10] we're going to come into agreement with
[2:12] what God's word has said about our
[2:15] lives. And when we do that, it releases
[2:19] something within us. It releases the
[2:22] anointing of God within us to continue
[2:25] to work in us and through us, purging
[2:29] us, preparing us, getting us ready to be
[2:32] vessels for the King of Kings and for
[2:34] the Lord of Lords. And I'm thankful
[2:37] again for the word of God and I'm
[2:39] thankful for you. I appreciate the Lord
[2:42] giving us this opportunity to minister
[2:44] into your life. If you have a prayer
[2:47] request that you'd like for us to agree
[2:49] with you in prayer over, we would be
[2:52] happy to do that, just send it to the
[2:54] contact information that's given to you
[2:57] on your screen. We'd be delighted to
[2:59] stand in faith with you for whatever
[3:01] your need is. We want to go right back
[3:04] into the study this week and see what
[3:08] God would say to us concerning this
[3:11] spirit and power of Elijah, how it might
[3:14] possibly work in us and through us as a
[3:18] many membered body of the Lord Jesus
[3:21] Christ here in the end time. Let me
[3:24] remind you our starting text, the theme
[3:27] of this study which is Malachi 4:es 5
[3:31] and 6. Behold, I will send you Elijah
[3:35] the prophet before the coming of the
[3:38] great and dreadful day of the Lord. And
[3:41] he shall turn the heart of the fathers
[3:44] to the children, and the heart of the
[3:47] children to their fathers, lest I come
[3:50] and smite the earth with a curse. Why is
[3:54] it important that the spirit and power
[3:57] of Elijah return again and again to the
[4:00] earth? It is important because it helps
[4:04] to spare the earth of a of of a smiting
[4:09] curse, I guess, would be a good way to
[4:11] put it. A smiting curse. And you know,
[4:14] there's so much evil and so much
[4:16] rebellion in the earth. I wonder how
[4:18] many times we would have earned a
[4:21] smiting curse. And yet each time God
[4:25] sent the spirit of Elijah and the power
[4:28] of Elijah to fall into the earth to
[4:32] somehow push that judgment out into a a
[4:37] future time period. And now we're coming
[4:40] once again very near to that hour. And
[4:44] so we're praying that the spirit and
[4:46] power of Elijah would fall in the earth.
[4:49] this time on a many membered bride. Not
[4:52] just one man operating in that
[4:54] anointing, but but a body, a corporate
[4:57] body operating in that anointing. Uh now
[5:01] I want us to turn today to Matthew chap
[5:03] 17 beginning in verse 9 going all the
[5:07] way to verse 13 because uh we can
[5:10] clearly see in the scripture that John
[5:13] the Baptist first it was Elijah then
[5:16] Elisha. Elisha had the spirit and power
[5:18] of Elijah on him. We know that. And then
[5:22] John the Baptist certainly had the
[5:25] spirit and power of Elijah on his life.
[5:28] In fact, he fulfilled a portion of
[5:31] Malachi 4:5 and 6. And you'll see that
[5:35] as we read this scripture together.
[5:37] Matthew 17 and9. And as they came down
[5:41] from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
[5:44] saying, "Tell the vision to no man until
[5:48] the Son of Man be risen again from the
[5:51] dead." And his disciples asked him,
[5:54] saying, Why then say the scribes, Elias
[5:58] must first come? And Jesus answered and
[6:02] said unto them, Elias truly shall first
[6:06] come. Notice the word shall is a future
[6:11] word, a word that is used for future
[6:14] tense, not has come. Shall come first
[6:19] and restore all things. But I say unto
[6:24] you, now remember, but is a conjunction
[6:28] adding two similar thoughts together,
[6:31] but not identical phrases. But I say
[6:35] unto you that Elias has come already. So
[6:38] Jesus confirms that there will be a
[6:42] future, a shall be uh coming of the
[6:46] spirit and power of Elijah. But he also
[6:49] confirms that Elias truly has come. He
[6:54] has come already. And they knew him not,
[6:57] but have done unto him whatsoever they
[7:00] listed. Likewise shall also the son of
[7:03] man suffer of them. Then the disciples
[7:06] understood that he spake unto them of
[7:10] John the Baptist. So here it becomes
[7:13] clear that Jesus was saying two things.
[7:17] He was saying to his disciples that
[7:21] those who prophesy, the scribes who say
[7:24] that Elias shall first come, they're
[7:28] right. He shall first come and restore
[7:32] all things. But Jesus was also saying to
[7:36] us, he is come already. They didn't know
[7:39] him. They did to him whatsoever they
[7:42] desired to do. That instant he was
[7:45] speaking about John the Baptist. I want
[7:48] you to notice the reason why it seems to
[7:51] be clear that the whole scripture is not
[7:55] talking about John the Baptist but two
[7:57] different comingings of the spirit and
[7:59] power of Elijah is because when we
[8:02] examine the ministry of John the
[8:04] Baptist, we do not see him as a
[8:08] restorer. Rather, he was a forerunner
[8:11] and a bridge. He was definitely a
[8:14] forerunner of the first coming of the
[8:16] Lord Jesus Christ, wasn't he? We also
[8:19] know that the ministry of John the
[8:22] Baptist, although he came in the spirit
[8:24] and power of Elijah, he did not forun
[8:28] the great and terrible day of the Lord.
[8:31] If John the Baptist would have been the
[8:34] entire fulfillment of this promised
[8:37] coming of the spirit of Elijah, then
[8:40] immediately after his ministry, we would
[8:43] have seen the great and terrible day of
[8:46] the Lord. And now we are 2,000 years
[8:50] beyond that and and have not yet seen
[8:52] the fulfillment of the complete great
[8:55] and dreadful day of the Lord. We know
[8:57] that that uh John the Baptist had a
[9:01] great ministry. It was a scriptural
[9:04] ministry. What I mean by that is it was
[9:06] prophesied in the scripture before John
[9:09] the Baptist was ever born. We can find
[9:12] that in Isaiah 40 and verse three. It
[9:16] says, "The voice of him that crith in
[9:20] the wilderness, prepare ye the way of
[9:23] the Lord. Make straight in the desert a
[9:27] highway for our God. Every valley shall
[9:30] be exalted, and every mountain and hill
[9:33] shall be made low, and the crooked shall
[9:36] be made straight, and the rough places
[9:39] plain, and the glory of the Lord shall
[9:42] be revealed, and all flesh shall see it
[9:44] together, for the mouth of the Lord hath
[9:47] spoken it." So we can certainly see here
[9:50] that John the Baptist came with a
[9:53] ministry that had been prophesied in the
[9:56] scripture. In fact, I want to share
[9:59] another verse that spoke about the
[10:01] ministry of John the Baptist. And that's
[10:03] also found in Malachi, not chapter 4
[10:06] this time, but chapter 3. If you'll look
[10:09] at Malachi 3:1, you'll see another
[10:12] reference to the spirit and power of
[10:16] Elijah and how it would operate in in a
[10:20] in a messenger's ministry that would
[10:22] forrun the coming of the Lord. Malachi
[10:25] 3:1, "Behold, I will send my messenger,
[10:28] and he shall prepare the way before me,
[10:32] and the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly
[10:36] come to his temple. Even the messenger
[10:38] of the covenant whom you delight in,
[10:41] behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of
[10:44] hosts." This was the forerunning
[10:47] ministry. Yes, he was definitely a
[10:51] person who would come and fulfill these
[10:53] scriptures. Valleys exalted, mountains
[10:56] and hills made low, and crooked places
[10:59] made straight. In other words, the
[11:01] ministry of John the Baptist was like
[11:03] building a bridge between the older
[11:06] covenant and the new covenant. But now
[11:09] when we look at that promise that there
[11:12] would be a restorer that the spirit and
[11:15] power of Elijah would come first that's
[11:18] what our lord said and restore all
[11:21] things then we have to look and see what
[11:24] a restorer is all about. To restore is a
[11:29] positive command to build. John's
[11:32] commission was to prepare the way by
[11:35] lowering mountains and raising valleys,
[11:38] by laying the axe to the root of the
[11:40] tree, reducing all human pride as grass
[11:44] before the Lord. But none of this is a
[11:47] command to restore. Therefore, again,
[11:51] this could not be a reference to John
[11:53] the Baptist and his ministry alone.
[11:57] There had to be a another installment,
[12:01] another fulfillment because the ministry
[12:04] of John the Baptist was not a restoring
[12:07] ministry. Now look at John chapter 1
[12:11] because I want you to look at every one
[12:13] of these scriptures to get the full
[12:15] picture. John chapter 1 beginning in
[12:18] verse 19 and going through verse 23. And
[12:22] this is the record of John when the Jews
[12:26] sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem
[12:29] to ask him, "Who art thou?" And he
[12:32] confessed and denied not, but confessed,
[12:35] "I am not the Christ." And they asked
[12:38] him, "What then? Art thou Elias?" And he
[12:42] saith, "I am not. Art thou that
[12:45] prophet?" And he answered, "No." Then
[12:48] said they unto him, "Who art thou, that
[12:51] we may give an answer to them that sent
[12:54] us?" What sayest thou of thyself? And
[12:57] look what he said. He went back to
[13:00] Isaiah 40 and he said, "I am the way. I
[13:04] am the voice of one crying in the
[13:08] wilderness, make straight the way of the
[13:11] Lord, as saith the prophet Isaiah."
[13:14] So he was letting them know, I am not
[13:18] fulfilling the entirety of Malachi 45
[13:21] and 6, but I am fulfilling the scripture
[13:25] in Isaiah 40 and3, the voice of him that
[13:29] crith in the wilderness. What this lets
[13:30] me know is that John was well aware that
[13:34] he was indeed coming in the spirit and
[13:37] power of Elijah, but that he would only
[13:39] fulfill a portion of Malachi's prophecy.
[13:43] Now, this scripture that I'm about to
[13:45] share with you now will help make that
[13:47] even clearer for you, I'm sure. And it
[13:50] is found in Luke 1, verse 13.
[13:55] But the angel said unto him, "Fear not,
[13:58] Zachcharias, for thy prayer is heard,
[14:02] and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a
[14:05] son, and thou shalt call his name John."
[14:08] Remember that Elizabeth was barren. And
[14:11] thou shalt have joy and gladness, and
[14:14] many shall rejoice at his birth, for he
[14:18] shall be great in the sight of the Lord,
[14:21] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[14:24] drink. And he shall be filled with the
[14:27] Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.
[14:30] Wow, what a prophecy. What a word of the
[14:34] Lord concerning this unborn child. he
[14:38] would receive the Holy Ghost even in his
[14:41] mother's womb. And many verse 16 of the
[14:46] children of Israel shall he turn to the
[14:50] Lord their God. Get that turn because
[14:53] that's again a reference to the work of
[14:57] the spirit and power of Elijah to turn
[14:59] hearts. And he shall go before him in
[15:04] the spirit and power of Elias. Elijah,
[15:09] who is him? Him is the Messiah. Him is
[15:13] none other than the Lord Jesus Christ,
[15:16] the promised savior. He shall go before
[15:19] him in the spirit and power of Elijah to
[15:24] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[15:28] children and the disobedient to the
[15:32] wisdom of the just to make ready a
[15:35] people prepared for the Lord. Did you
[15:38] notice that? It almost appears as though
[15:42] the angel of the Lord misqued the
[15:45] prophecy of Malachi. Now, how would that
[15:48] be possible that the angel of the Lord
[15:51] would come and misquote Malachi's
[15:54] prophecy? Because when he is speaking
[15:57] specific specifically about the ministry
[16:01] of John the Baptist, when he speaks
[16:04] specifically
[16:05] about the ministry of John the Baptist,
[16:08] he says this to turn the hearts of the
[16:12] fathers to the children. What about
[16:14] turning the hearts of the children to
[16:16] the fathers? It's not mentioned. Rather,
[16:19] he says and the disobedient to the
[16:22] wisdom of the just. Now, some people
[16:24] look at that and they say, "Well, it's
[16:26] the same thing." Well, I don't believe
[16:28] that the angel of the Lord's presence
[16:30] would come like that and misquote the
[16:33] scripture. I think it is very
[16:35] intentional. I think it is a message to
[16:38] us that the coming of John the Baptist
[16:42] in the spirit and power of Elijah would
[16:45] fulfill the first portion of Malachi 45
[16:51] and 6. the first part of that prophecy,
[16:55] turning the hearts of the fathers to the
[16:57] children. Now, how did John the Baptist
[16:59] do that? Well, in essence, he turned the
[17:02] hearts of the fathers to the children.
[17:06] And by doing that, it was bridging the
[17:09] gap between the fathers of the faith,
[17:12] the patriarchs of the faith to those who
[17:16] would come and receive the baptism of
[17:18] the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost.
[17:21] In other words, John the Baptist had an
[17:24] amazingly difficult task because his job
[17:28] was to let the fathers know that what
[17:31] God is doing now in the children is also
[17:35] for you. It is the fulfillment of what
[17:38] you have longed for. This one who is
[17:41] about to come is going to fulfill
[17:44] everything you have waited for your
[17:47] whole life. This is the Messiah. If
[17:50] you'll remember, that's how he did it.
[17:53] Behold the lamb of God which taketh away
[17:57] the sins of the world. You'll remember
[18:00] that when Jesus came to John the Baptist
[18:03] to be baptized. And this was an hard
[18:06] task. I mean, it was a hard thing for
[18:09] John to accept when he realized exactly
[18:12] who the Lord was. This wasn't just his
[18:15] cousin. This was the promised Messiah
[18:18] for all of Israel. And as he was walking
[18:22] down the bank of the river to be
[18:26] baptized, John gets a revelation that
[18:29] drops from heaven right down into his
[18:31] spirit. And he doesn't greet Jesus
[18:34] Yeshua by saying, "Hello, cousin. It's
[18:37] good to see you." But rather, he gives
[18:40] this prophetic declaration to all.
[18:44] Behold the lamb of God which taketh away
[18:48] the sins of the world. It was the job of
[18:52] the spirit and power of Elijah to
[18:54] identify the one who would come and
[18:58] redeem the sins of all Israel. This was
[19:02] the commission placed on the life of
[19:05] John the Baptist and he certainly did
[19:08] that well. But there needed to be the
[19:11] other portion of Malachi 4:es 5 and 6.
[19:15] It needed to be fulfilled as well. And
[19:18] we'll look at that sometime in the in
[19:21] the next broadcast probably. Now I want
[19:24] to go back and read verse 17 again and
[19:27] then talk about two of the words that
[19:29] are used there. He shall go before him.
[19:33] This is the prophecy of the angel of the
[19:35] Lord to Zachcharias concerning his son
[19:38] to be born John the Baptist. He shall go
[19:42] before him in the spirit and power of
[19:45] Elias to turn the hearts of the fathers
[19:49] to the children and the disobedient to
[19:51] the wisdom of the just to make ready a
[19:55] people prepared for the Lord. What a
[19:58] beautiful verse of scripture. to make
[20:01] ready a people prepared for the Lord.
[20:03] That's why we believe that there needs
[20:06] to be an outpouring again of the spirit
[20:09] and power of Elijah even in our day that
[20:12] will help make ready a people prepared
[20:16] for the Lord. Why does the scripture say
[20:19] in the spirit and power of Elijah? Well,
[20:25] that word spirit in the Greek is numa
[20:29] and it means wind. It means breath. It
[20:33] even means mind or mental disposition.
[20:38] So the the angel was saying to
[20:41] Zachcharias, your son is going to come
[20:44] in the same mental disposition as
[20:48] Elijah. Now, that's why we studied for
[20:51] weeks the characteristics
[20:54] of the prophet Elijah, a man of the
[20:56] wilderness, a man who was not afraid to
[20:59] confront false religion and the
[21:02] religious norm of the day, a man who
[21:04] came demonstrating the raw power of God,
[21:07] a man of extreme emotional highs and
[21:10] emotional lows, and a man who was chosen
[21:13] to confront the Jezebel spirit. Because
[21:16] the angel said, "When your son comes
[21:18] into his ministry, he's going to come in
[21:21] the same mental disposition as Elijah
[21:24] the prophet." And so if we examine the
[21:27] life of John the Baptist, we see a lot
[21:30] of the same characteristics that we saw
[21:32] in the life of Elijah. Perhaps you
[21:35] remember when John the Baptist was faced
[21:37] with a situation where he could have
[21:40] easily compromised. He is called on the
[21:43] scene before the ruling elder, the
[21:45] ruling leader of the day and given an
[21:48] opportunity that he he could have been
[21:50] political. But instead, if you will
[21:52] remember, he answered by Herod by
[21:55] saying, "It is not lawful for thee to
[21:59] have thy brother Philip's wife. You're
[22:02] breaking the commandment of God." Wow.
[22:05] This was a difficult thing to do. That
[22:07] sounds like Elijah confronting the
[22:10] prophets of Bahel. He knew this could
[22:12] cost him his life. And in fact, we know
[22:15] from the scriptural record it did cost
[22:18] him his life. His head was was cut off
[22:22] and and even presented on a charger
[22:25] simply because he would not compromise
[22:28] with the sin of adultery. He called out
[22:30] the leader of the land. He called out
[22:32] Herod and he said, "You're breaking the
[22:35] laws of God." In other words, it doesn't
[22:37] matter who you are and how much
[22:39] authority you have, you have an
[22:42] obligation to obey the word of the Lord.
[22:45] I like that. I believe that John the
[22:48] Baptist operated in the same mental
[22:50] disposition, in the same mind of Elijah
[22:54] the prophet and also in the same wind,
[22:57] in the same breath, in the same spirit,
[22:59] in the same vein of anointing. There's
[23:02] no doubt about it. So then we have the
[23:05] word power. He's going to operate in the
[23:07] spirit and power of Elijah. And that
[23:11] word power that's used there in the book
[23:13] of Luke is dunamis. Maybe that's a word
[23:16] that some of you Bible students are
[23:18] familiar with. Dunamis. It means
[23:21] strength, authority, military force,
[23:25] miraculous power, ability, abundance. So
[23:29] the the angel was saying to Zachcharias
[23:32] concerning the ministry of his son John
[23:34] the Baptist, he will operate in the same
[23:37] strength, in the same military force, in
[23:40] the same authority, in the same
[23:41] miraculous power, in the same ability,
[23:44] in the same abundance as Elijah the
[23:47] prophet. And so I think this is a
[23:51] tremendous confirmation that that spirit
[23:54] and power of Elijah was of such a
[23:56] tremendous value that God said it needs
[23:59] to not only just fall on Elisha, the one
[24:02] who would immediately follow the Elijah
[24:05] ministry. But at another very important
[24:08] time in history, it needed to come into
[24:10] the earth again. Please understand this
[24:13] is not reincarnation. This is not a man
[24:15] who has died, being reincarnated, coming
[24:19] back to visit the earth in a physical
[24:20] form. This is God taking of the spirit
[24:24] and the anointing and the
[24:26] characteristics of Elijah and saying,
[24:28] "These are of of of such value, I'm
[24:32] going to send them right back upon
[24:33] another man into the earth to fulfill a
[24:37] similar task." And what was the ultimate
[24:40] need for this spirit and power of
[24:43] Elijah? It was to prevent the earth from
[24:47] being smitten with a curse. How many of
[24:50] you remember that from the scripture?
[24:52] Now, how important
[24:55] was recognizing that John the Baptist
[24:59] was the fulfillment of scripture? How
[25:02] important was it in their day that that
[25:06] men and women be able to discern and to
[25:09] understand that John was not just an
[25:12] ordinary preacher, but he had come with
[25:15] a biblical ministry. He had come with a
[25:18] divine commission to introduce
[25:22] the the coming, the first coming of the
[25:25] Lord Jesus Christ. Not a restorer in the
[25:29] sense that things that were broken down
[25:32] and thing truth that had been lost was
[25:35] restored but in the sense of a
[25:37] bridgebuilder in in the sense that he
[25:40] did exactly uh the first part of
[25:44] Malachi's prophecy. He shall turn the
[25:47] hearts of the fathers to the children.
[25:50] And that's exactly what he did. And I
[25:52] want you to know that was a task. As I
[25:54] said a moment ago, it was very difficult
[25:57] for some of those uh uh patriarchs,
[26:00] those men who had walked in the laws and
[26:02] instruction of Moses. And now here comes
[26:05] a new ministry on the scene. It was very
[26:08] difficult for them. And had it not been
[26:10] for the work of John the Baptist,
[26:12] perhaps there wouldn't have been so many
[26:14] who were persuaded. I'm thankful for
[26:17] what God did then and what he's doing
[26:19] now. Let me pray for you. Father, thank
[26:21] you that you sent your word to heal us.
[26:24] Thank you for teaching us your ways.
[26:28] Thank you for helping to prepare our
[26:30] hearts for what you're going to do in us
[26:33] and through us in the end time. I ask
[26:36] you to pour out of your spirit upon
[26:40] every person who's seeking you right
[26:42] now. In the wonderful name of the Lord
[26:45] Jesus Christ, Yeshua, our Messiah, we
[26:48] pray. Amen. And amen. I can't tell you
[26:50] how much I appreciate you spending this
[26:53] time with me. And I can I humbly ask you
[26:56] to do it again. Will you stay tuned for
[26:59] the next Eagle's Cry? We'll be back and
[27:02] we're going to continue to study the
[27:04] spirit and power of Elijah. God bless
[27:07] you. Bye-bye for now.
