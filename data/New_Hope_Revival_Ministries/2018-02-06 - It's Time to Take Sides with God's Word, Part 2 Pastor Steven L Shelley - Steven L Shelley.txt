TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] will you live the Jesus life the Ascended life the supernatural life from the realm of the Spirit [Music] but I've got good news for you and that is God by nature is a redeemer [Music] is surrendering our mind to the word that's what makes the big difference that's the great mystery right Weist in you the hope a lord [Music] I'm pastor Stephen Shelley from New Hope revival ministries in Smith Station Alabama and I'm coming to you again on behalf of brother Eric Erickson and the gospel channel again we are so delighted to be in partnership with the gospel channel to bring you some programming hopefully it will be a blessing to you I want to thank you so much for calling the prayer line for your emails your contact with us is so greatly appreciated you know it's a delight when I'm able to go to the pulpit and share with the congregation that someone is on the other end of the television camera that you're watching and that you're being encouraged we even have had some of you precious folk have left a messages on the answering service because we have no idea when the programs are airing and repeat and so sometimes you're leaving a message on the prayer line and and what a delight it is to hear that message and hear the program playing in the background that just reminds us that what we do is not in vain and we've only been doing it for a few short years and to this magnitude only a very short time but the folks that the gospel channel have been doing this for many many years and their dedication to bring you good programming touches me deeply and I know that it is their desire to encourage the discouraged while also reaching out to those who have not trusted the Lord Jesus as their personal Savior so would you stand with the gospel channel with your prayers and with your giving we invite you to sow a generous seed into the work of the gospel Channel thank you for reaching out to us from Spain and from Ireland and we really would like to know just how far we're reaching out with the broadcast here on the gospel channel so you can also use the number on your screen to let us know where you're listening where you're watching from or you can write us an email and it would just be a blessing to be able to to go again to the congregation and say they're hearing us in Ireland they're hearing us in Scotland it's just a joy when we were together recently we were talking about one of the themes that the Lord had given us as the old year was leaving us and a new year was approaching and one of the things that the Lord said to us was that we should really take sides with the Word of God and you know the Word of God is more than a than the Bible the the Bible is of course the written record of God's Word but we also know that Jesus Christ our Messiah and Savior is the Living Word we know from John 1 that in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh the Word of God took on a fleshly form a body in our Lord Jesus Christ so who was Jesus he was God he was the Word of God made flesh in a fleshly body so when when the Lord began to speak to us about taking sides with the word it it's not just standing up for the Bible but it's taking sides with Jesus Christ I want you to know that around the world it's becoming very unpopular to to name the name of Jesus to be identified with Yeshua his Hebrew name to say I'm a Christian it it really is becoming unpopular again in the world and I think that it would be very very easy for us to blend into society to blend in to culture I recently heard in a political speech and saw young man who had made a tremendous journey to defect from his country where he had been a deeply persecuted and tortured had even lost a limb and he was given an opportunity as a student in that country somehow to visit another country another Asian country and when he returned to his country one of the things they wanted to know was did you meet any Christians were you in contact with any Christians and of course he was again persecuted and tortured because he couldn't deny that indeed he had met Christians on the journey so this reminds us that we're living in a very tolerant society but perhaps not as tolerant of old-fashioned Bible believers but I want you to know that I know that we're speaking right now to some old-fashioned Bible believers we're not just hearing from from young people we're hearing from the elderly and I want you to know that it really warms my heart when someone calls or contacts us and they say I'm nearly 80 or I'm in my 80s I'm 85 one dear sister called it really blesses us because I know that you are still here for a reason your life I pray that it has been well lived and that God is preserving you and and helping you in your health but you're alive for a reason for a purpose until the day that the Lord should call you home or he should come and rapture his bride out of this world you have a purpose you're not finished with your destiny and so for us to know that we can encourage you we can be a blessing to you we had intercessors to say I'm an intercessor in my church but I'm under attack and I need prayer what a joy for us to be able to stand with you in in your journey because we understand that the temptation is there to blend into society and and just go with the flow but God bless you strengthen you encourage you for taking a stand in this new year for the word of God and we mean as much as possible in a non-confrontational manner we're not talking about being judgmental we're not talking about being in people's faces in fact much to the contrary what we're talking about is living the word life the life that the Word of God produces the person of the word the character of the word the love of the Word of God I'm telling you the most beautiful love story that has ever been written in the in the history of all the world is this written record of God's Word it is history it is his story and it is a love story Oh what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we could and should be called the sons of God I don't know about you but I'm feeling my father's love right now there are times in the busyness of life that we don't feel that love and that protection and that concern but I'm telling you he is always there his love for us is unconditional it is unchanging and it is eternal so the least that we can do is to love him in response when we are shadowed overshadowed showered with his love it produces something so wonderful in our life a hunger a desire to be more like him and so we we owe him this duty of loving him and serving him and taking sides with him and pointing other pilgrims to the cross this is a journey and a journey is not accomplished in one day one year even there there are journeys like this journey the spiritual journey that is over the course of your lifetime I recognize that some people's deaths seaman timely while others live to be what we call a ripe old age but regardless of the span of time in any individual's life it is a journey we are journeying back to the heart of our Father we are heading back to his heart his mind in his great love for us and there are hills and valleys there are smooth places in Jesus and there are bumpy places in the kingdom of God but I want you to keep on keeping on taking sides for the word of God when we were with you last time sharing that theme we ended up in a verse of scripture that I'd like to begin with on this program in mark chapter 4 and verse 24 in the amplified version of the Bible it reads if any man has ears to hear let him be listening and let him perceive and comprehend this is the words of Jesus he wants you to perceive his word he wants you to be able to understand his word in fact he provides the spirit of understanding he washes our eyes or anoint our eyes with eyesalve by revelation that we can see God's Word in a very very personal way God is a personable God he's a God of relationship and this love story recorded in the Bible is a personal love story it starts off by God loving a nation his great love for a people a nation a tribe of people or a number of tribes of people making up a nation his great heart and love for the Hebrew people we call them now the Israeli people or the Jewish people but the New Testament reveals to us in in a much broader scope that his love is not just for a people it's also for individuals those who will join themselves to the Covenant that God has made with mankind that makes it very personal that makes it about me that makes it about you when you read the Bible your attitude is important the way you approach it the way you perceive it is important you must not view it as just a history book of what God has done or what God has been but you must see it as it was intended it is a book first of types and symbols and shadows and then in the newer covenant or the New Testament we see everything that was concealed in the Old Testament in symbol form and typology we see it revealed we see the key to the map to begin to understand what some of the offerings were speaking about all of the services of the temple the furniture of the tabernacle all of these things pointing not to a religion but to a person the Lord Jesus Christ I remember Jesus speaking one day in the Gospels and he said your father Abraham rejoiced to see me in his day I want you to know that that God was feeling his plan of redemption even to father Abraham he looked afar off the Bible says in in the English translation but in the Hebrew it speaks of a much deeper experience that Abraham was having he wasn't just looking far off in the physical distance but he was looking far off in the spiritual and he was seeing on that very mountain another day another lamb another sacrifice when I hear that even now it warms my heart because it was God wanting to encourage Abraham keep on keeping on no sacrifice is too great I receive your obedience and your willingness to obey as an offering as a sacrifice of your praise and your love for me and because of that I believe God wanted to give Abraham a token of understanding what it was all about in days to come in ages to come and so the New Testament reveals the coming of the Word of God in a body of flesh his earthly ministry just a short few years and his ultimate sacrifice for my sins I want to make it personal my sins to be forgiven we sing a song I owe the debt I could not pay he he paid a debt he did not owe I'm so thankful so thankful that my sin debt was paid ultimately once and for all first in the mind of God before the foundation of the world when the lamb was slain and then this thought of God this plan of God this whole I don't want to say scheme because when we hear that word we often think in the negative but the whole purpose of God was it was made real when it was made flesh when Jesus came in that earthly body of flesh he brought the purpose of God to the physical realm you could reach out and touch the word for the first time the word wasn't just an abstract a concept or a symbol a pillar of fire which was in every way beautiful and powerful the cloud by day in every way powerful and beautiful all of the miracles of the Old Testament the older covenant beautiful wonderful demonstrations of the power and authority of the one true Living God but it was not until Yeshua came it was not until the Lord Jesus was born of a virgin in a body of flesh that the purpose of God could be physically touched that little woman with the issue of blood if I can but touch the hem of His garment she wasn't just reaching out to touch the hem of a garment from that time period she wasn't just reaching out to touch the fringe of a prayer shawl that would have been already worn in the Second Temple period but she was reaching out to touch the Word of God made flesh the plan and purposes of God for this earth now fleshed out in an earthly body I want you to know the story does not end there in fact we see throughout the entirety of the scripture a plan of God being revealed unfolded unveiled slowly I have to say slowly but surely tying together the loose ends and putting the pieces of the puzzle together so that we can understand especially coming to the book of the revelation the last book of the of the New Testament we hear again a lot of symbols we hear a lot of of representations of things that will happen and we now know that some of the things that we read about in the book of the revelation are finished they are absolutely fulfilled and yet there are also many elements of that revelation by the way that's the revelation of Jesus Christ our Bible may title it the revelation of st. John the Divine but I want you to know that from from the first verse to the last verse it is unveiling again revealing a person the Lord Jesus Christ that's what this truth is about it's not about a religion it's not about a specific church or or a specific holy man it's not about a pastor or a prophet or an apostle it's so much more than that it's about Almighty God and in one phase one dimension of his ministry he became flesh he became an earthly man but I want you to know that what was in him is bigger than the body of a man eternal sovereign omnipotent God because the story doesn't end in the newer covenant in the New Testament because we can say the story goes on here we are you and I living 2,000 plus years since the Lord came since the word was made flesh and God still has a plan for today you know what I believe the gospel channel is a part of that endtime plan and so I want you to again bless bless them with your words bless them with your prayers and bless them with your gifing because I truly believe I'm not just saying that because I want to I want to make them feel good this is it's much more important than just a compliment or some form of flattery I truly believe by conviction that Christian television is one of the ways that God is revealing his endtime purposes and plans as we said a moment ago the story goes on the journey continues and I specifically feel that deep connection to the gospel channel it may not be the flashiest of the networks it may not even be the most powerful in the sense of of wattage of getting out we may not as of now cover as many satellites as some do or as many regions as some do but it's not over yet I truly believe that God has expansion in his mind for the gospel channel because I believe there's certain elements of the word that are so very important for the hour that we're living in right now we need to understand this Old Testament we need to understand this New Testament but we also need to understand what God desires to do in this hour that we're living in right now and that is what he did in 1 son what he did in one body he desires to do in a mini membered body a mini membered Bride he's racing up a company of over comers who emerge from the church yes of course Jesus Christ Yeshua our Messiah is married to the church I truly believe as he married himself to the nation of Israel in the Bible he is also committed to the church but in that church I believe according to the New Testament there will be those who rise up in the spirit of the overcomer who have an anointing to rise above the spirit of their age the spirit of this age that we live in right now now there are many spirits there there are many themes out there in in 2018 of course but one of the predominant spirits that relates to the church is the spirit we often refer to this as being the Laodicean Church age the the age of the Church of Laodicea we believe that the spirit that was predominant in that church age in that excuse me in that church there were seven churches of Asia Minor mentioned in the book of Revelation and we believe that those characteristics those attributes if you will of those seven churches that were present at the time that John was writing the book of the revelation those characteristics are very carefully recorded as well as a promised reward and I believe the detail in that in that narrative helps us to understand that it was much more than just seven churches and what was going on in those seven churches among those people though the peers perhaps they fellowship with one another and knew one another because the distances were not so great between those churches but I believe that we have the details recorded so carefully for us because it was prophetic and I believe that you can take the nature and the characteristics of those seven churches of Asia Minor are carefully recorded for us and lay them over the entirety of 2,000 plus years of church history and I believe you can see those predominant characteristics very evident across those ages of church history so that would mean that we are coming through Laodicea or the last I'm encouraged by the fact that there are no more Church ages after this the next is the bridal age or the the new the new day the new dawning the new millennium the wonderful reign of the Lord Jesus Christ which by the way is longer than a thousand years that's the millennial reign but after that a new heaven and a new earth at peace with God forevermore what a great thought that is and doesn't matter how many years we've been thinking about that it's still our blessed hope it is still the reason why we may not be conscious of the Lord's coming and his home that he has prepared for us every moment of the day what we may forget it some of us may have may even feel like that's just an outdated doctrine oh I'm telling you it's way more than a doctrine it's about to be a reality because as sure as you and I are sitting where we are right now me and Alabama and I don't know where you're sitting one of these days the dead in Christ are going to rise first and we which are alive and remain will be caught up together to meet them in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord you mean to tell me you really believe that preacher man with every cell in my body with all that I am I believe I'll tell you something else I believe I'm going to be a part of it one way or the other I'm nearing my fiftieth birthday so I realized that if Jesus terry's I don't have another 50 years of ministry left on this earth but I also believe that since the coming of the Lord is so near and we are seeing even even scriptures that that we have not emphasized through the years we've read them we had margins of understanding concerning them but you would almost call them hidden or I'm not sure the right term to use but but you know there are predominant scriptures that we associate with the endtime there's a list that we can make but there are scriptures especially hidden in the prophecies of the prophets of the Old Testament that we have not seen the full fulfillment and the full reality of those scriptures and now we're beginning to see things fulfilled and things lining up to be fulfilled that let us know that very soon every prophetic promise in this book is going to be fulfilled it's all going to be a reality now we say well this has happened but this hasn't happened this this here has happened but but this here has it but very very soon we're going to be able to say that everything that God so carefully recorded and men gave their lives to preserve it's a reality that's where we are the predominant spirit to go back to Laodicea just a moment the predominant spirit of the church we're not talking about the world at large because that that's huge there's a wildness there's an insanity that that is just bubbling sometimes beneath the surface in the world and sometimes spews like a volcano just a spirit of madness a spirit of insanity of people just absolutely losing their senses and you know my wife says to me sometimes how please tell me how that one human being could do that to another human being it's hard for many of us to understand because we have felt his love when you experience the love of our Heavenly Father and the way that he brought that love to us through the son our Lord Jesus Christ you're changed I mean you meet a love that is more than you've ever known before it's bigger than words and once that happens to you even even in a small way maybe you're like me and you're still discovering the depth of his love you're still understanding I mean I feel like that it's a revelation that continues to unfold oh how he loves me and I feel the same way about the blood I know by the scripture and you do as well why the blood came why why it had to be the way it was the life was in the blood and we understand that it was the shedding of blood not man's blood but blood that was specifically created for the token for the price the the actuation and activation we could say of the plan of redemption we understand that but I also believe that there is a depth there's a revelation there's an understanding of the blood just like his love that continues to expand I'm telling you there's power in the blood of Jesus Christ thank you Lord that it has been applied to my life thank God that many of you have invited him to come in by his spirit with his blood and set you free from the curse of sin and of death but I wanna i want more understanding i want to receive more revelation from him so yes there's all kinds of predominant spirits in the world we we're hearing about terrorism and and we're hearing about such strangeness such such unusual things emerging all of a sudden when it comes to issues of gender things that many of us no matter how hard we try we don't seem to to be able to understand I believe God died for everybody I believe his love is toward everybody I believe that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believe believeth on him might not perish but have eternal life I believe that is the Word of God but I believe there are some things happening today some spirits that are being unleashed on planet Earth that are so far from the mind and the purpose of God such a vending and such a perversion of God's original plan and I don't want to be offensive to anybody but I'm going to take sides with the word and I'm going to say that it's not going to be all right with God there is a day of giving account to God for how we have surrendered to his plan this is not a journey of performance you're not going to win unless you perform the right way or you keep all of the right regulations there are Bible Commandments there are instructions that we we must hear and we must obey but it's not a journey of performance it's going to be a journey of relationship of be being less and him being more in my life that's where we are so even though all this is going on in the world there that I think the predominant spirit of the church age that we're living in right now is is certainly Laodicea was a was an age of of people's rights everyone wanting wanting their rights it's also a period of of lukewarm Christianity a real watered-down non-committed form of what it means to be a bible-believing Christian and we might get by in the interim but but there's a reckoning coming and there is an awakening coming to a body of people I believe that with all my heart and that's one of the reasons why I'm coming to you today that's one of the reasons why we're partnering with the gospel channel it's because we believe that even in this dark hour of uncertainty we believe that God is going to have a people who will work the works of Jesus Christ where did you get such a crazy idea as that the Bible the words of Jesus we sometimes say the red letters I didn't plan to read this but in Revelation chapter 3 and I have amplified in front of me it says enter the angel messenger of the Assembly the Church in Laodicea these are the words of the Amen the trusty and faithful and true witness the origin and beginning and author of God's creation I know your record of works and what you are doing you are neither cold nor hot would that you were cold or hot God's desire for that church in Asia Minor was that they would be hot or cold cold or hot his desire for the church today in the church age of Laodicea is that we would be hot or cold but he said in verse 16 so because you are lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew you out of my mouth that doesn't seem to me like a God who will look over our continual disrespect for what he is asking of us be colder hunt you know this in-between straddling of the fence it's like the call of the of the captain in the Bible choose you this day whom you will serve if God be God and serve Him if by all be God than you you sir Bale but you have to make a choice and I believe that's what Jesus was saying through John to the church of present day that present day Laodicea but also to this church age perhaps beginning in the in somewhere around 1906 but but the beginnings of the Pentecostal age could be traced all the way back to 1895 but all of the recorded church history that most of us can get at our fingertips from from Azusa Street where the gifts were restored the power of the Holy Ghost we call it the Pentecostal experience because it was given on the day of Pentecost or the feast of Shavuot this these years from around 1906 to now making up this last church age and Jesus was saying all of these years even when Pentecost was fiery and when it was spreading like fire he was still saying to this church age I would that you were either hot or cold ah if if you don't make a choice you're gonna be spewed out of my mouth he said in verse 17 for you say I am rich I have prospered and grown wealthy and I am in need of nothing and do realize and understand do not realize and understand you say I'm wealthy and I am in need of nothing and do not realize and understand that you are wretched pitiful or pitiable poor blind and naked therefore I counsel you to purchase from me gold refined and tested by fire I want you to know that there is a truth there is a revelation in the Word of God that is so pure it has been tried and tested by fire and part of that revelation is that the journey continues the word became flesh in Jesus absolutely but but as everything the father was was poured into the Lord Jesus Christ and then everything that was in the Lord Jesus Christ was poured out upon the church on the day of Pentecost and so that's the continuation of the journey now in this spiritual atmosphere of Laodicea many people are just satisfied to just sit around and evidently be naked because the verse goes on to say therefore I counsel you to purchase from me gold refined and tested by fire that you may be truly wealthy and white clothes to clothes you and to keep the shame of your nudity from being seen and salve to put on your eyes that you may see this is Jesus speaking to his church I want to clothe you I want to hide the shame of your nakedness I want to I want to remedy your blindness by anointing you with eye salve this spirit of revelation and understanding so that you can be able to see that Jesus wants to live in you manifesting the same works the same power the same Authority the same spirit it's going to require that same spirit we know that because the Bible said if if that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead if it dwell in you it shall also quicken your mortal body if we have hope for a new body if we have hope for a change one of these days a glorious resurrection then we will have to be filled filled to overflowing not a trickle but but a flood fill to overflowing with the same spirit that lived in that body of our precious Lord that broken beaten bloody body of our Lord and this is the gift of God this is the continuation of the journey and so we must take sides with the Word of God we must stand in faith with the truth the revelation of who Jesus is in the scripture that we were going to go to a little while ago mark 4:24 finis man has ears to hear let him be listening let him perceive and comprehend and there we stopped now we're moving on verse 24 and he said to them be careful what you are hearing what you're hearing the measure of thought here's the reason why we must be careful what we hear because the measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you and more besides will be given to you who hear so let me remind you that it does matter what you hear there is error out there there are there are messages out there and doctrines out there that do not line up with the continuity of Scripture they don't dovetail with the written record of God's Word I don't care how warm and fuzzy they might make you feel how comfortable and familiar they may be and they may make you feel at home and at ease if they're not according to God's Word then we have an obligation to separate ourselves from those things and again stand with the word take sides with the Word of God so it matters what we hear and it matters how we hear in what attitude in what spirit are we listening because if we have the right spirit and the right attitude concerning the Word of God whether it's what we read or what's delivered to us by teaching or preaching our prophetic utterance if we have the right attitude and spirit toward that word then we open up and we receive it with faith and when we open up to God's Word and we receive truth by faith we study we pray we we connect verse to verse then that revelation expands on the inside of us as we agree with God's Word as we join our faith with God's Word in fact the Scriptures indicate that the more time we spend thinking about the word abiding in that word adding our faith to it then the more revelation we will receive from that word you can't hear a sermon on Sunday and and never reconsider it and expect that that word you heard is going to make a difference in your life I do believe that there's power in hearing the Word of God but I don't think that's just letting it register in the ear I think that hearing is letting it register in the heart so it's not just the physical ear or the physical hearing but it's the opening up of our faith and when we understand that the word comes to us first in seed form and then it is unveiled and revealed and as circumstances line up and as you experience things in your life that take you to another level of maturity you go back and revisit a scripture that you thought you had full understanding of and now because of your growth it doesn't always change what you believed about the scripture but many times it just takes it to a new height or a new depth to a richer and fuller understanding I'd like to say this is a Living Word because it's the written record of a Living Word the Living Word Jesus Christ and because the word is a person and the word is breathing and the word is living and it's in him that we move and breathe and have our being and because of that it's ever-expanding it's going deeper into the areas of our life that we're willing to surrender when we begin to understand that it helps us to see that are there are a lot of passages in the Bible that we can understand a little bit differently for instance the sowing of the seed by the sower and the ground the ground the condition of the ground determined the the future of the seed I I think it was good see but the ground was in different conditions and so how the ground was the condition of the ground determined what happened to the seed what you and I do with God's Word how we apply it how we revisit it how we pray for understanding from it it will absolutely determine how effective that word becomes in our life I want you to know that I'm not in any way talking about big more religious the Word of God does not make us more religious but a living relationship with the Word of God a daily one-on-one individual remember we talked about God living a nation and then God grafting into that nation of people that would love him that would love his word of people that he also loved and yet we still see all of that as a corporate body the church the believers but this thing in the in the end now right now this thing has to be more than has to be about more than just being plugged into a church Universal this has to be a one on one walk with Jesus Christ the word in this hour why are you saying that because of the spirit of the age because of the spirit of the culture Society what's going on around us we've got to know him not just know about him when we when we understand when we begin to look at some of the symbols of Scripture and the parables the stories that Jesus used to teach it wasn't to ultimately conceal the truth it was to cause us to think deeper about what he was saying so that the truth would be revealed it would well we call it progressive revelation revelation that starts and then it gets brighter and brighter and brighter like a woman we call it in the South sometimes drawing the drapes what we mean by that is and I'm sure my kids if I said drawing the drapes they wouldn't know what I'm in but it means a woman going to the to the window in the morning and and pulling the cord to cause the drapes to be drawn the curtains to be drawn to the side so that you can see I know I know now some people have this button you press and a motor Murr you know moves the curtains to the side but in the old days it was like this we just recently were in a a little home a vacation home that we rented in in Arizona of the United States in in the Sonoran Desert beautiful place older home but a beautiful place and there were so many windows in it they had so many of these blinds these these blinds that that can really block out the light but I don't like it that way I like the light and so every morning I'm in there drawing the drapes pulling the blinds open and that's how revelation is it's it's just it's like this it's just unfolding the more we pray into it the more we add our faith to it the more we lean toward it fellowship it speak about it share it read it again write a note in your journal I think God's trying to speak to me from this the more we do that that's also taking sides with the word and the more we do that the brighter the light gets that comes in the window the Bible talks about this in in 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 verse 18 in fact one translation of the Bible translates it this way and we all with unveiled face beholding the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another I think King James says from glory to glory but I sure do like the explanation in this translation the way this is described as we all with unveiled face beholding the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another it's getting brighter for this comes from the Lord who is the spirit the Lord as we know him the word is spirit form he came in a body but now he lives inside of us in a spirit form and so how do we know more of him how do we fellowship him how do we build relationship with him we can't see him he's inside of us by the Holy Spirit how do we build a relationship we do it in the spirit by the spirit spiritual things are discerned in a spiritual way by the spirit in other words we're not encouraging you only to visit the the written word because you could read this every day of your life and not believe it and be lost it's only when you can attach your faith to this word that it becomes alive in you that is the work of the Holy Spirit that's why we need the Holy Spirit we don't just need theology because theology can be so dry we need the living reality again the letter killeth but the spirit quickeneth the spirit is what makes the word alive to be able to truly embrace who God is and who we are in him and who he desires to be in us that's going to require a work of the Spirit it's going to require a revelation not just an education not just gaining the the knowledge the gnosis but supernatural in the sense that it is revealed to us by the spirit we need another degree of Revelation would you would you agree we need more understanding of God's Word I I just so feel like again that so many people today feel almost as though the Bible is irrelevant just antiquated I hear people saying all kinds of things you know speaking about racism and murder and all the that's all they they're they're reading the Bible with their opinions with with with their mindset and you've got to read the Bible as God's unfolding plan and obviously because Jesus came and fulfilled many of the requirements so many things that we read about in the Old Testament we we no longer have the obligation to stone the person who is transgressing the instruction of God but there's a payday coming there is a reckoning day as we said earlier but it's just not our responsibility to execute the Vengeance of God on the earth that's not our job but but now we have the living reality of the word and we serve Him not because we're afraid of him destroying us but the true believer we serve him because we love him because we know that he first loved us I want you to know that it's not a time to be starchy it's not a time to be a know-it-all it's a time to allow yourself to just be real humble before a great big loving wonderful papa a great father who wants to buy the spirit of adoption he wants to reveal himself to you and I and I believe that that everyone will not overcome I do it doesn't make me feel good to say that I believe there are many who will rather be overcome by the spirit of the age but I do believe that there is a remnant body I believe that the gospel channel will make it possible for many of that remnant body to be reached I believe this is one of the things that God is going to use in the end time to help equip us and to get us ready to be able to recognize our destiny in him I believe that there are many evils in modern technology and internet and television etc but I believe that that truth will also utilize all of these things we talked some time about the the evils and the wackiness of social media but I want you to know God can use social media he is using social media for his purposes is the enemy also using it yes he always will the devil is a hijacker he will hijack anything he can get his hands on to promote his agenda but I tell you something he's about to have a people on his hands that he's not going to know what to do with that may sound very very silly to some of you but I'm telling you it for me it's a promise when God will manifest himself in a mini membered body the bride the remnant of Jesus Christ of Victorious and overcoming people who through no struggle of their own because we're not struggling to get there we're struggling to survive so God can take us there it's not by our earthly striving that we're going to be more yielded it's not by our own works that we're going to come to full redemption it's by taking God at His Word it's by believing and it's about constantly and consistently visiting this precious love story this road map I grew up you know in what you might call a country church where the songs were simple but meaningful I remember one old song and I don't know if you've ever heard it or but I'm using my Bible for a road map that may sound you know who uses a road map today you know who knows what a map is I found out not too long ago that that my children had never really held in their hand a atlas why do you have to because it's it's on your phone and your your GPS is now on your phone or on your watch well I want you to know you can still get the point you've still got some somebody giving you directions to get to somewhere and I'll tell you this this road map is not nearly as confusing as the GPS can be some time I found out that you can plug in the right address and it can still take you to the wrong place but not this one not this one I encourage you this year of your life takes sides with the Word of God in a way that you never have before I pray for you that God will bless you and strengthen you and that he will encourage you and that this will be the year of moving from one degree of glory to the next degree of glory to the next degree of glory until we just move up into his presence I tell you I'm looking for that day when Jesus Christ is fully formed in the life of the believer here on planet Earth maybe not the majority but there's a remnant that's being called maybe some of this has spoken to your heart today it's way more than I intended to share and maybe it's because you're being positioned to be a part of that overcoming body the bride of Jesus Christ who will walk in the full revelation of who he is god bless you thank you for watching pray and support the gospel channel with you will you do that bye bye [Music] [Applause] you
