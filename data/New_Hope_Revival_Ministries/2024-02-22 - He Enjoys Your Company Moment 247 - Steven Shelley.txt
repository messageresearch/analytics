TRANSCRIPT
========================================
but I want you to know there's different kind of Destinies there's one that you make for yourself you you know you plan your life well God gets in the middle of that little cottage by the by the river white picket fence 2.5 children and God gets in the midst and he said that may be your thoughts that may be your plans that may be what you're planning for a destiny but I've got something entirely different and it may not seem great in the duration but it will certainly seem greater at the end of the journey in fact there's going to be some heartache and and trial and hardship on the way and when you and I were planning how our life was going to be we left all that out we left out all all difficulty we never made any room for trouble and look what happened God said I'm going to harness trouble I'm going to take control and dominion over problems and hardship and I'm going to use it so that it won't be wasted in your life it's going to bring you to a place where you can receive a personal intimate revelation of the glory of God before way before it's revealed to All Flesh we're talking about when God shows up in a manifested way and he wants a relationship with you you know that's powerful God has an appointment we you know one thing about his appointments he never runs late right you see there there are two paradigms in adoption one it is the uh Paradigm of of bridal uh Authority or Bridal possession Bridal inheritance and you relate to him as a bride and that is a very intimate personal thing remember he's not looking for worship he's looking for worshippers he's not looking for a group he's looking for individuals and that doesn't mean that it's not a many-membered bride it's a many membered bride it's a many membered body it's Oneness it's an intimate relationship with you on the other side of that coin is sunship and sunship is not as intimate and private and personal as Bridal we get them both God reveals certain things to us in the Paradigm of sunship authority possession and he reveals certain things to us in the Paradigm of of the bride and the bridegroom intimacy Fellowship just you and him and until we get that until we understand that and our minds don't make it something weird but our minds begin to make it something special because that's what it is he was searching for you if you would have been the only one he was searching for you he wants fellowship with you having fellowship with me is not enough for you he wants to have fellowship with you so I want you to understand that this bride that God has chosen for the last Church age of Leo he wants to reveal his glory to us in a very personal and private way when the when the veil of the tent Falls and it's just you and him that's the deepest encounter that you can have with the glory when everything else is shut out and it's just you and him that's where you know him as he desires to be known come on and there's nothing hidden you're you're naked before him just following along the Paradigm you realize that there's nothing you can hide from him and you also realize that he sees you as you are and loves you ever the more nothing that he sees about you in that intimate place of relationship causes him to love you less in fact he loves you more because you're making time for him and he enjoys your company
