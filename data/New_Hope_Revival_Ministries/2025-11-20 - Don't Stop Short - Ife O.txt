Description:
When your choices squeeze you into difficult places, remember: you were hand-carried there by the One who loves you most. He leads us through trials, through rejection and misunderstanding, because He wants to heal us. It doesn't feel like healing at first—but wait it out. There's always testimony at the end of the test. It's not who starts strong that matters, but who endures to the end, who runs past the finish line because the momentum won't let them brake.

Strip off whatever weighs you down. Pray fiercer, worship wilder, don't stop short. There's One waiting on the other side ready to welcome you home. Stay in your lane, and God will use every single one of us—not one left behind, not one warming the pew, but all of us fully spent for His kingdom.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
And if any of you have ever been in a situation like that where your choices brought on circumstances that squeezed you a little bit, you must also believe that God is sovereign. &gt;&gt; And your choice may have influenced where you are. Your the way you've lived your life may influence where you are, but but Satan didn't deliver you there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You were handd delivered by the one who loves you the most. He will take us to trials because he wants to purify us &gt;&gt; and get the nature out of us that is unlike him. &gt;&gt; He will. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; He'll carry us into sticky situations and and times of rejection and misunderstanding. And he does that because he wants to heal us. Somebody say, "Well, that don't feel like healing." Well, you've got to wait it out &gt;&gt; because there's healing on the other end. How many of you still believe there's a testimony at the end of the test &gt;&gt; ALWAYS? THAT'S WHO GOD IS. &gt;&gt; And the Bible tells us it's not the one that starts off and and THEN TURNS TO THE SIDE. It's the one who endures to the end, the one who runs the race all the way past the finish line. &gt;&gt; Some people say to the finish line. Try it. Try that. &gt;&gt; Next race you're running, I don't know how many races you run, but the next one you run, stop at the finish line. See if that helps. You're not stopping at the finish line. You got to cross it. &gt;&gt; And usually the momentum that you've picked up on the way will make it a little bit hard to put on brakes. &gt;&gt; How many of you want to burst into eternity like that? &gt;&gt; I HOPE WHEN I GET THERE, I JUST BURST IN. BECAUSE I COULDN'T SLOW DOWN. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU SLOW DOWN, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU SLOW DOWN, SISTER. IF YOU'RE GOING to run a race, RUN WITH ALL. RUN WITH EVERYTHING. Come on. &gt;&gt; Don't wear your fair coat to run this race. &gt;&gt; It'll weight you down. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not not physically now, but but spiritually strip off &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THERE'S A RACE TO FINISH &gt;&gt; AND THERE'S A FINISH line to cross. &gt;&gt; And we don't want to stop short of the victory. &gt;&gt; If you need to beat the ground a little bit more, do it. If you need to grab the arrows and beat again, do it. If you need to pray a little harder, do it. If you need to worship A LITTLE WILDER, DO IT. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO, don't stop short. &gt;&gt; There's a victory. There's a victory over there, brother, sister. There's one standing on the other side of the finish line, ready to welcome you in his arms. &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE IF WE WILL STAY IN OUR LANE, GOD WILL USE EVERY ONE OF US FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF HIS KINGDOM. I DON'T WANT one to be LEFT BEHIND. I DON'T WANT ONE TO FALL TO THE WAYSIDE. I DON'T WANT ONE TO JUST WARM THE PEW. I WANT US ALL TO BE USED FOR THE sake of the kingdom of God.
