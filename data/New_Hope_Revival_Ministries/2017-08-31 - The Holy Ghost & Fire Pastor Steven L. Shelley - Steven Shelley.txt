Description:
More than an emotional sensation or feeling, the Baptism of the Holy Ghost of God is the very life and character of Jesus Christ imparted to the Believer. This baptism is evidenced by a life that punctuates every Word of God with an “Amen! Glory!’ - a life that manifest every fruit of the Holy Spirit. We must maintain a living, continuous fellowship with the Holy Ghost in these last days, as it is the Spirit of Truth leading us back to the Word!

“But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all the truth.”

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
I want to read a scripture to you today it's found in the book of st. John chapter 16 beginning in verse 12 Jesus is speaking to his disciples and he says I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you when the Spirit of Truth has come and I want to tell you that the Spirit of Truth has come by the power of the Holy Ghost and fire and I was just reading some things that brother Branham the precious prophet of God said concerning the Holy Ghost baptism he said when the Holy Ghost comes it is life it is god himself in you and I don't know if that blesses you or not but that blesses me because the true genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire it's not just a sensation it's not just a feeling because feelings come and go sensations come and go when times are bad and when situations are rough well you don't always have a good feeling but the Holy Ghost is more than a feeling it is the very life of Jesus Christ living inside the believer I read where one of the saints asked brother Branham a question concerning what does it mean to be baptized into the body it's that the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ which we know is the right Christian baptism or is it the baptism of the Holy Spirit and Radames said we are baptized into the body of Jesus Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost by the baptism of the Holy Spirit in fact he said you can be baptized all kinds of different ways and still not be a part of the true body of Jesus Christ unless you receive the Holy Ghost baptism and remember that's not just on your flesh that's not just in the in the realm of the emotions but that is to the inside of the inside and when the Holy Ghost gets down into the inside of the inside the very nature of God is reflected brother Branham said he takes control and lives the life of Jesus Christ through us we realize that we've got to have the character of Jesus Christ living inside of us but what what what if you do feel something what if you do have a true experience with God I heard him say a genuine experience with God will punctuate every promise with an amen glory so when you have an experience with God a personal experience it makes every promise in the book personal the Holy Ghost of God is connecting you to the word to the life of Jesus Christ and making it very very personal he also said when the Holy Spirit comes he is the shepherd to feed you the Sheep food from his word we're not eating goat food today we're not eating the food of the Buzzard we're eating eagle food we're eating sheep food even the message of the hour preached a generation ago can become stale to us if we don't have a living continuing experience with the Holy Ghost don't you go another week don't go another day without knowing you can have a no soul you can have an experience with God that is so real that not only makes you feel good of course but it changes you from the inside out it's the completion of the new birth the Prophet taught us and every birth is a mess and I'm telling you it wouldn't hurt some of us starchy church people to go back to our roots and remember what it was like when our hearts were aflame with the power of the Holy Ghost and fire the real Pentecostal experience and a cost has become a denomination but the word Pentecost is not a curse word it's not a bad word it speaks of the life and the fire and the power of Jesus Christ and we need that today perhaps more in 2017 than we have ever needed it before God is still talking he's still speaking by his Spirit whatever he says today is going to line up with the message of the hour it's gonna fit the absolute Word of God but because the Holy Spirit is real and present and and and he is up-to-date he is now the Spirit of God is now he can take the Word of God this precious old book he can take the message of the hour given to us a generation ago and he can make it live by his Spirit until it becomes a personal experience to you and then every promise of God is punctuated by that experience a big old amen glory comes to the end of it and then one more thing I wanted to leave you with and that is that he told us that the evidence of the Holy Ghost he said a lot of things about the evidence of the Holy Ghost he said it was having a burden for the lost I'm just paraphrasing that and it was having all the attributes of Jesus Christ in you not just the speaking in tongues that that's just one of the things that the Holy Ghost can do you know that you can talk in tongues and not have the real genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost on the inside of the inside but once he comes there and takes over the control tower of your life I want you to know there are many F fruits and evidences brother branham mentioned a lot of different things but I like what he said here the evidence of the Holy Ghost is the fruit of it the fruit of the Spirit so here here it is in a nutshell precious Saints you can dance and jump and shout and speak in tongues and prophesy and see visions and by the way I believe in all of that all of that I believe in I believe God has a divine order of course but I believe in all of those manifestations of the Holy Ghost but you can do all that and still not have the genuine Holy Ghost down on the inside of the inside how do we know well one of the ways we know is by the fruit of the Spirit Galatians talks to us about the fruit of the Spirit I want you to know that we're needing some more of the fruit of the Spirit around the bride around those of us who who fellowship around the precious message of the hour we can have the gifts my we need some of that correction we need some of that to deal with the compromise that's creeping in the church so many of the churches who have believed this truth are really entering into a place of compromise and these days so we need the Lord to manifest himself through the gifts through the preaching of the word to help us stay on the straight and narrow the Prophet was having the experience stay in step little bride I just like to release that over you precious people whatever you do stay in step no matter what the enemy throws against you stay in step stay with the word and don't you settle for anything less than a real baptism of fire the baptism of the holy ghost I pray that those of you have never had the real Holy Ghost baptism that you'll tarry until you receive a power from God the witness of his word and I pray that some of you who had an experience with God receiving the Holy Ghost but but you you've become little lukewarm your fires died down a little bit it's possible you have to keep flaming of Fanning the flame you have to keep fellowshipping in the word and by the spirit and so if that's happened to you I pray God will give you a refilling there there's one feeling but many refilling he is life he is life I received that Holy Ghost baptism at the age of seven and that was a long time ago forty-two years ago and you know what he's still keeping me alive and he's come by the Spirit of Truth to lead us to the word and that's why we have the precious revelation of Jesus Christ today so again I just love every one of you and I want you to hold through the mark of God and press in with everything you have the Lord is soon coming to get his bride let's be ready let's make ourselves ready god bless you thank you for letting me greet you bye-bye [Music] you
