TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you'll have nobody to blame on the reckoning day but yourself but i want you to know that something has happened in this last church age there is a power and an authority that is available to you and i as a believer that's even more potent than it was in the first church age because we are the generation that has to overcome there has to be a people in the last of the last days that go all the way back to the beginning and say this is what we must possess as children of the lord jesus christ we must have the healing virtue among us we must be able to cast out devils in the name of the lord jesus christ we must see miracles and signs and wonders as the bible has promised and no generation has been better positioned to inherit those things than this one because jesus is no longer hiding himself behind the lattice he's no longer clothing himself in any kind of religious expression but he has now stepped out from behind the veil hallelujah and if you want to find where he is he's coming up out of the wilderness that's where he is and guess what i see when i see him i see a little bride walking out of that wilderness with him by the grace of god she smells just like he smells his anointing and his fragrance is upon her who is this that i see coming out of the wilderness hallelujah it's the bride of jesus christ leaning her head on her beloved listening to his heartbeat desiring to do his works hallelujah and all hell is against that truth all hell is against that revelation now you can let somebody keep you back you can let somebody hold you back if you want to but i'm telling you you'll have nobody to blame on the reckoning day but yourself i got my eyes on the prize you may still be under a denominational spirit and you may think the prize is a mansion or a gold street or a pearly gate but i want you to know that's not the goal the goal is jesus christ he's the goal to have him to be found in him that's the goal that's what we're pressing toward we're pressing toward a high calling and that high calling is to be found in the image and the character of the lord jesus christ hallelujah we're not going to walk barefooted we're not going to walk in a robe we're not going to conduct ourselves like they did in second temple period that's not where what we're talking about we're talking about irrelevant people not because they have fashioned themselves after the making of this whole world but because they have held to a truth let me tell you something jesus is more relevant than anything i know he is not outdated or old-fashioned or antiquated he is the same yesterday today and forever he lives and he is just as able to move among us today as he was in the book of acts as he was in the ephesian church age or any of the other church ages
