Description:
The Spirit of adoption can only be understood by understanding ancient Middle Eastern customs. Even a blood son had to be “adopted” before he could transact his father’s business. Therefore the Scripture is not talking about acceptance into God’s family but the transferring of His authority to His fully manifested sons.

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign a Son of God I have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but I have received the spirit of adoption now don't misunderstand this doesn't mean that he has brought someone in who didn't belong to him this is our concept of adoption our concept of adoption is when we bring someone into our family who is not blood of our blood flesh of our flesh born of our bone and we make them ours so the adoption that we're talking about here is not an adoption like America or like Europe but it is the adoption from the middle or Far East and that is where even a son even a blood full bona fide son could not carry the authority of his father until he had sat under tutors and been trained and taught and finally the tutor would say Hey you have reached the place where you can receive the full authority of the father's adoption and we understand that they were brought to the gate of the city and friends and neighbors were called and a proclamation was made and usually read by a father or a a one who was appointed sometimes the tutor and before the whole group of people that were gathered there the announcement was made this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him the exact language that was you hello the exact language that was used at the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ the same adoption fully adopted bringing you into a relationship with God where you no longer have to approach him who most holy Reverend hallowed father God Supreme no that's not the believer the believer says Papa we always approach God in reverential fear but we do not of human the kind of fear that brings us into bondage bondage too many people around the message are under a spirit of bondage and they're afraid to step out to be led by the spirit to encounter the reality of a living God causes them anxiety the very thing that God has said to Deliver Us from anxiety causes them anxiety come on when life overwhelms you this week and you don't know what to do next don't melt down don't take another pill say papa oh this scripture is telling us the spirit of adoption brings you into a unique fellowship and relationship with your God that should cause you not to move in the bondage of fear but cause you to move in the liberty of the spirit that has come to set you free if you know what I'm preaching this morning say something laughs
