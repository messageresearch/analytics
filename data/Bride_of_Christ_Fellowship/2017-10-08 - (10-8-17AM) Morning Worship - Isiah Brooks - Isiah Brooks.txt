want to say thank God for these Amazing Grace just getting here fellas coming in like this week is this something like that definitely but what can I say it's just been a wonderful time there's a lot coming up here just 50 miles out the Des Moines area I hit a deer just finished paying off my three days ago five days ago but you know I got his grace we need to come it was awkward of all this just kind of like a little black it's all right appreciate the Lord trust the service I don't know why I'm so nervous I'm nervous as I never knew the purpose of my exist and I was talking that needed too much geez then one day I heard to the reason for cavalry yes the moment or the first time in I truly fell free grace on me grace [Music] give the miss of all the God's grace only God open my eyes I'm I see I am crazed song hallelujah to know that from the beacon I was in it makes life worth longing to know he may be for his call oh how I long to go home and my face I shall endure I've been washed

mercy song show me this mercy song God sure the God is good to us ways have forgotten it but by God's grace we saw some earlier so we're gonna say it again before we leave today I don't believe in letting the devil get in the best get the best the best amen matthew 26 please some water please [Music] beginning at the 53rd verse of the 26th chapter of Matthew then said Jesus unto him put up again thy sword in his place into this place for all these that take the sword shall perish with the sword think it's all not that I cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels but how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be I love that question basically he's saying how if I did that then how can the Scriptures be fulfilled that's not the way God planned it in the same hour said Jesus to the multitude are you come out as against a thief with swords and starves for to make take me well i sat daily with you teaching in the temple and he laid no hold on me but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples forsook him and fled you love God let us pray I don't have any father we thank you for your grace and your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord we thank you Lord for breaking the bread of life to us this morning father we pray that you your will will be done this morning break and destroy the yokes of the enemy I pray this morning O God that you have preeminence in the service forgive us Lord for any and everything that we may have done or said or think thought that is not pleasing in non eyes Lord cleanse this house of God and glorify you'll name this morning in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen you may be seated we'd like to entitle this message identification to vindication I believe that it is not enough just to call ourselves message believe us actually the devil is a message believer because he believe it's right he believes it's true but the thing that Satan cannot do and that is to live it you see God vindicates his word and I have found in my pastoring for many years I find out that there are so many people who are claiming to be a believer but then when it comes to faith they seem to like lack what it takes as an overcomer now I say this because Amen we understand the prophet of God talks about two kinds of faith and he said there is a mental faith and I believe that all of us are born with a certain amount of faith that is mental Amen we we believe things that that really is impossible for us to do but those things that we we learn how to do become common to us and we never think about faith or the kind of faith it takes or took for us to achieve what we achieved even in our natural faith as a prophet of God said is of God the natural man can be wrong but God cannot be wrong see what I'm saying he can never be wrong he said no matter how rich how poor how popular or unpopular we are it's all must go but there's only one thing that our being here is centered around and that's Jesus Christ so God let us lay aside everything as secondarily and hold to him and he is the word he said granite Lord so what are you saying what I'm trying to say is that it's something that we must look and we must see and must understand that as individuals we must be vindicated by God wait a minute I must say it again see I didn't know I was going to preach this message until a few minutes ago God gave me something I thought he wanted me to preach this morning but he told me to do it this evening so I didn't even know I'm just bringing this up a priestess to my church because I really realized that we are coming to a place that we must only reset reflect the life of Christ God don't care about what you used to be he's not even interested it meant in in your agenda matter of fact everything about you must die and rot hallelujah and I really believe with all my heart Amen that the issues amen that are we have amen in this chart because I said this church I mean among the bride is because we want the pastor to perfect us hallelujah but the pastor has no ability in himself to prevent you he himself needs to be perfected and that perfection comes by Jesus Christ alone you better hear what I'm saying now let me say this to you the anointing of God can never be overlooked hello because I can preach to you all morning and if God presence is in here you're not getting anything why because it is the anointing that breaks the yokes it is God who comes down and he breaks the bread of life to you you understand me Oh listen I don't know what's happening but you know God don't like starchiness hello let me say it again God do not like stiff and starchy church folk God is a quickening spirit and in order for me to get this message over to you you gonna have to pull on him better than your doing you're not gonna work me up here you understand me I'm just here to preach the Word of God but you've got to pull on else Sharia in order to get what you need now how many needs something hallelujah amen Oh some of y'all didn't raise our hand so God saw that you don't need nothing huh so anyway you said it you did it he heard it is that okay do I sound rough to you I hope I do I'm hoping I'm rough because I want you to understand we're living in the last days we supposed to be super fire fault with God don't listen God let me say it like this do you really think being stiff and starchy is gonna make you holy that's no sign of holiness at all but you must understand that we are the most I should be the most happiest people in the world it's supposed to reflect through our lives what's only inside of us let me go on with the message but you see in our lives we supposed to only refract Christ is that right the prophet of God says in the lamb and the Dove he said as long as you've got malice Envy strife and all these things of the world then you know Christ isn't in there the Bible says if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God not even in you see when we think about the love of the love of the world and in the things of the world we think about fashions we think about houses we think about cars but I'm going to tell you something paulus is of the world hatred is of the world strife is of the world hello somebody and you know there are those people who seem to hold on to that thing of those things and as long as you hold all of those things God is not in you that's what he said in that you love the Lord I'm gonna praise the Lord if you don't right listen when it comes to this I can't listen the life is in there see it's just produced itself let me back it up the Bible says if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God is not even in you cause the life of God isn't in you the life is in there it's just produces itself it just lives its way out hallelujah so what are you saying I'm saying is heaven in you if heaven is in you it will live its way out hallelujah come on somebody jesus wept at the tomb of Lazarus hallelujah but while he wept he saw because he saw so much unbelief around him when he went to awaken Lazarus from the grave you know when Jesus says he's sleeping I'm going to wake him amen I would sleep people should have gotten excited you know but they come like that like Jesus was now leading them on a second of funeral procession but Jesus didn't go to lead them to a funeral procession he came to awaken Lazarus I wish that he would awaken Lazarus in here this morning hallelujah amen we need some fire come on now yeah people call me Pentecostals and you exactly right I'm of the original and I'm sorry I can't help myself and I get jealous for my lord I get jealous for my lord because he's worthy to be praised I don't care what you going through he's worthy to be praised hallelujah Amen I ain't gonna let no Rock crowd for me now come on and happy is the man see don't try to say the Christian because I joined church that's one way I'm a Christian because I sing in the choir that's something else I'm a Christian because I preach the gospel that doesn't make you a Christian I'm a Christian because I spoke with tongues that don't make you a Christian I'm a Christian because I dance in the spirit that don't make you a Christian I'm a Christian because I shout it that don't make you a Christian I'm a Christian because that I quit smoking I quit drinking if you did it within yourself there's something wrong yet that's right we mustn't do these things in ourselves if there's something in us that simply takes the world out of us then it begins to bear fruit of itself in other words you've got to have Christ on the inside of you he's the one that makes the change should I come down and clap your hands for you should I come down and we're here you work your mouth and say Amen you know I'm looking at these things because I want you to understand people don't try to pump me up listen I'm not supposed to pump you up you're supposed to pump me up I'm coming in hand you're supposed to blow me away with your amens you know I love you that's what I'm saying what I'm saying amen listen it becomes very difficult when a preacher try to preach without the anointing thank God I got something on the inside here amen listen every word must be vindicated hmm so let me say it like this if you're part of the word Amen that means your life's supposed to be vindicated not somebody else's life your life these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they're cast out Devils you see your life as an individual is supposed to reflect Christ hallelujah Oh glory to God listen the vindicated word of the hour oh yeah that's right you know what we do we take the message books in the taste the vindicated word of the hour that's not the vindicated word of the hour you the vindicated word of the hour hallelujah is that right the angel told John eat the book you must eat it because you must what prophesy again this is not a dead letter it's a quickening thing that's going on hallelujah and don't you know there without the quickening power you won't be quickened in the resurrection hallelujah you love the Lord Amen this has nothing to do with culture Oh people look at me somewhere you know what he's saying like this I was working with some Ukrainians and the run brother told me he said we want you to preach but don't you come over here we don't want you to preach black you ever heard such a thing I'm preaching black what is that hallelujah I think about he meant with when it comes over men Amen when those Jews starchy Jews and the power of God sucked him hallelujah starchy Jews when the power of God's touch when the power of God struck them the prophet of God said they jumped out of the windows ran down the street and they were crying he's alive he's alive they had so much quickening power on the inside of him they were willing to die they wasn't afraid of trouble when they got thrown in jail they didn't say woe is me they stuck a song or two Amen so glad I'm here so glad I'm here so glad I'm here in Jesus name hallelujah they get into shape here man they began to rock like I heard her brother say that was the first jailhouse rock amen because they rocked that jail and then till all the doors open up y'all hear me now people it must be the same it is the devil say oh you just you don't have to act like that and you don't do all like that Amen it's like a dog a man seeing you come home and then then miss you all day he gets to worshiping you y'all can relate to that right the dog don't want to just hold your hand he want to kiss your face that's what we ought to feel like this morning kissing the face of God and he keeps trying until he can reach it hard he yeah he did the jumpin y'all hear what I'm saying it is her life he cannot help him you can't expect a dog to act like a cat can't don't jump all he do is go around your legs for the dog he gets excited masters home hallelujah come on I wish you know that's why God called her gentle dogs he expect us to act like it sometimes especially in worship Hollywood you love the law hard I hope this is our brother Jesse my point is and then we're living it scaring me it's really I was telling brother I don't worry about the denomination's and people out there I mean if I can get a chance of witnessing him I'm happy to do so but I worry about those that are in the message who claim to have the Holy Ghost and I don't see any signs of it brother Brendan says shouting was wrong he didn't say dance was wrong he didn't say anything was wrong he just said don't get confused but when the life is there it's gonna produce those things you see what I'm saying this is a job I was going to preach I guess God didn't want me to preach it but I had got a message by God precious this is precious priceless is the word a priceless message given to you and priceless nothing can pay for it there's nothing no no value in this world that's worth trading it for heard of God identification and everybody said well I follow you know the prophet of God Elijah brother branham I follow you know his message and everything else folks let me ask you something go and tell the story about this junket a hand is bored following him this junket was staggering and all of a sudden the drunker looked back to make sure his boy was behind him and he saw his son doing the same thing what was his son doing following his daddy so every move his daddy made the boy made that's what following the message is every move the message make you move with the message y'all hear them saying you do as the message goes right that's the problem God let me ask you a question how many y'all before getting saved y'all danced in the world raise your hand raise your hey don't be ashamed I'm not trying to trick you but I'm trying to tell you something God gave you a gift of dancing the gifts of God are without repentance you just danced with the wrong partner right that means that gift is supposed to be used when you come to God I got you now but how are I'm to trick you what I'm trying to say if that gift listen don't you understand that when people see the joy of the Lord that you have that's what draws them what was the one thing that they said these men are drunk but not as you suppose they're drunk that drunk off new wine why is it that the wine we're drinking is not making us drunk it must be a different wine because the wine that God brings down brings you to a drunk state is that right Oh humming Allah how many y'all been drunk in the spirit I'm telling you I've been drunk in the spirit till I almost forget my name of where I am and where I am Ronnie I think I might have told you this before there was one time I was so drunk I was going up and down the road after service not knowing where I was going then some people had the gas they say that looks like brother Bruce Scott we better stop what's going on and they stopped me to say do you know where you're going I said no you know where you are no and then they gave me directions to get home but that's just we had such a powerful service and then I got so filled with God that I was in heavenly places though I was still on earth y'all hear what I'm saying this message it's the greatest thing that ever hit the earth and God wants you to will wanted to reflect y'all hear them say oh come on somebody is true you take a mirror and you take that mirror and you place it in the way of a Sun and you shine that thing in somebody face they're gonna jump Wow because the reflection of that Sun will still have the intensity of it enough to blind that person if you would if you didn't move the light and if we are reflectors we suppose reflect the Sun so much so it will get next to the person you reflecting me to oh lord help me Jesus anyway let's move on I don't mean to get I'm trying to take big character to move you out of this y'all too comfortable in these chests yeah maybe he need to get some metal ones or something at least you look like you're in the spirit and moving around a little bit you know you my family so I can talk to you like this I'll tell you what people just don't my point is this you want when you come to church you know who you trying to make happy Jesus you're trying to make him happy you don't want to go like like that Simon's house and you don't invite Jesus over to the house and nobody won't won't do nothing with him he has come but nobody won't anoint him nope nobody won't kiss his feet hallelujah and don't you know I'm in the state of Christ right now and the way you anoint Christ right now is you say I praise the Lord Sikkim when you've indicated that means Amen is a you know whether are you justified in other words you got somebody who's can prove that you are who you are or something to say no this is the original something that will was put a stamp on you because remember Jesus said if you don't believe that I am he because I have I'm telling you I'm he didn't relieve me because of the very works that I do the words that I do aren't there the works that the Messiah would do when he comes so he had he not only had a word which we say we have a word but God won't say show me the miracles I want to see your vindication what God has done in your life there's you know I told my I was talking with somebody I said this is the season of testimony they overcame by the blood and the word of their testimony everybody waiting to get to heaven to tell their testimony God gives you trials so you can tell your testimonies now vindication I don't want to be called a message believer without God vindicating Who I am I want God to vindicate that I am a believer no matter what he has to send me through oh come on somebody yes sir the word is the same today as it was yesterday today and forever is that right hallelujah look at what look at God Amen when God allows Stephen be stoned you know you think that was a coincidence or God didn't know that Stephen was going to be the first martyr to the New Testament church he knew that God knew that and and and we find out by God's grace and then Stephen was the one that was surprised if you want to put it that way he didn't know that he was going to be stoned right but it was God vindicating that Stephen had the same thing in him that Jesus had amen here they were thank you here they were stolen Stephen and his steed instead of Stephen getting angry and mad and upset huh you know what he said Lord forgive him charge nothing to these I always think about that because you know what if he would have said Lord revenge me of my adversary Paul would have been in trouble you see what I'm saying even though everybody looked like a enemy Paul looked like the enemy but only inside of him on the inside of him was God Himself Christ vindicating he was pedigree thoroughbred from the original vine you see what I'm saying you know I can't rest on all the things brother branham has done I got to have my own testimony you got to have your own testimony hallelujah somebody said oh you all have been there when the Holy Ghost fell on me well come on somebody can anybody say that this morning somebody listened because when the Holy Ghost fell on me I started jumping I started running I started shouting I started praising God I ain't gonna say no more I don't say it enough on that area but I'm gonna tell you something one of these old days this church and everybody else's church brother branham say these times of this service we can't become a farm memory there gonna be a time you wish you had praise God you gonna wish you had shouted you gonna wish you had dance you're gonna wish because they're gonna outlaw it hmm he said I just listened to him the other day he said these kind of churches they're going to shut down forbid us to even hey hands on the sick if you lay hands on the sick and you get your doing it they can put you to prison take you to prison or even kill you on the spot oh that's foolish virgin okay tell me what he said so you and I must understand I hear he was being stoned and the Bible said his face shine he wasn't frowning like if I had a brick I'll throw one at you no he wasn't thinking like that his mind was so elevated in God he caught he was in another round he was in the rim that God wants us all to live in in heavenly places in Christ Jesus so when these things come amen we can shine like this idiot he had the face of an angel hallelujah even the line of God was so over him it meant that God transfigured him right in front of the people's eyes that's the kind I'm talking about Amen why because Stephen stayed on the word listen he said his face might not have shined like a light up there but an angel knows what are you doing and the angel is a messenger that commissioned from God he doesn't have to take down he's knows exactly and them half a million howling wolves of clergy and out the there are condemning the man for what the way he was doing and the sermons he was preaching and Stephen stood and said you uncircumcised of the heart and ears and you resist the Holy Ghost like your fathers did so are you doing the same thing he was telling them the way back to God that opened up the Red Sea and tell them to God who reign on the place down in Egypt otherwise he was worshipping God he knew who he was worshipping he understood who he was worshipping and his God was God do you know God my question I tell my church I said okay people I said oh you everybody no mr. Savior you say you know him as Lord but there are tons of Christians who don't even know him as a friend how many of you disported know Jesus as a friend this friend I'm talking about he sticks closer than a brother y'all believe that but listen even in a time of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego when they were thrown into the fire where were all the other Jews but his friend their friend came all the way down from glory stepped into the fire just for some fellowship that's what I love about Jesus whenever I'm going through hard trials he just don't let me go alone he's always there hallelujah and I can count on him I count on him why because he's my friend hallelujah that's what God wants you to be to him he wasn't just the Lord and Shepard of those disciples but he was a friend he told him secrets hallelujah he fellowship with them hallelujah amen he didn't want them amen to make him listening way above him huh because he wanted to be a friend he wanted to be a brother he wanted them give the show that he was made of flesh too and he was a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of their infirmities but one of the things he wanted them to do he wanted them to love each other above all things you loved the Lord he wanted them to love each other above all things matter of fact when Jesus began to wash their feet remember Peter said ah ha ha no Lord I'm just not gonna do that he said if you can't do this you can't have no part of me ha ha because every true believer knows how to wash feet you know what watching feet is it is a wash away your stumbling the stumbling of your brother he may walk in places he may stumble he may fall but you know what you do you try your best to get lower than his feet huh you become his servant hallelujah you become listen people look at the falling brother but you know what God said when the brother or sister fall you get down hello I'm telling you without this kind of love you won't make him I didn't know I was preaching this message I was going to preach something else but God led him here he I tried to open up different messages there and then they wouldn't even open up it's ok Lord show me something I'm praying lord help me here just to want to open up so it's for you amen listen listen look my point is this we are the bride of Jesus Oh y'all got to understand I can't do this I went through the Methodist I've been a part of a Catholic Church I never joined but I went there for a couple of years I went to the Apostolic Church you know Jesus name whatever you want to call it and I still was empty I was shouting I was dancing I was running I was doing all of those things I had gifts you know but I didn't have him now I'm not saying everybody in that church was in my condition but I knew there was more for me is that right in the message the original see brother Branham said three seeds were sown Billiken graham Oral Roberts and William Branham three seeds right and our song in in the beginning of time my seed came under the umbrella of William branham's ministry you see I passed I passed milligrams ministry right I passed through those churches that those seeds that were sown that field I've passed through that right I wasn't satisfied I went I went and I passed duty the oil Roberts a field of apostolic administer that I wasn't satisfied y'all you mean huh because the seed in me was not sold by we are Vinny grandma or Robert that was that was their ministry but the seed that was sown amen was the real original seed that came by way of God hallelujah through a prophet and so therefore when I came to the right field now I'm at home now I can I can bring forth amen all that God wants me to bring forth because I'm in the right field I'll get the right nourishment I'm getting the right amen produce whatever you want to say I'm getting it all hallelujah o people of God and then we you say Oh brothers let me tell you something just a few testimony in this preaching but but you know I'm trying my best to surrender everything I got everything my mind my thoughts you know sometimes I can't even talk anyway so I need him to talk for me right so anyway I'm going shopping I bought me some shoes I come into the Stone Cold's right and I come into Cole's who this beautiful old lady oh my she was beautiful and all I could think about how pretty she was then and how she used to be I'm thinking she probably was a queen or something but anyway she comes up she's a tall skinny slim black lady amen and and and she she you could see character all over I mean she was dressed better than most of these message people and her husband was a Baptist but she's dressed she's got everything loose flowing down and everything else nothing and in the Holy Spirit sent by her shoes I said ma'am can I buy your shoes but she was hard of hearing so she couldn't hit me she went on up to the register and I just stood there and she put the shoes up on the counter and she said she the lady rang them up told her what time what it was she open with an old person of purses that women used to have she opened that thing up I'd like I wish I could give a picture that she opened that thing up and she looked and she said oh my sweetie she said can you hold those shoes for me and she says I realized I don't have enough money to pay them I said I got in her face I had to turn this way I said can i buy your shoes she said what did you say and the cashier said well he want to buy your shoes I said yes ma'am I said can i buy your shoes she said I said I want you to know I said they're real Christian still they're true Christians why you see why'd you say that brothers because I wanted her to know I was a Christian I'm not just doing this to be doing this but I was told by God when she didn't have enough money I said darkness he told me to buy him he knew she didn't have no money I was right there on time now hit me I bought that lady's shoes and the cashier started she started tearing up she said honey she said I don't mean no harm she said I'll tell you what she says you made my day by what you're doing she said I've had a rough day all day and seeing that you find these ladies shoes she said you have made my day and then she gave me a discount hallelujah you know God is good so when you listen to him see that's the kind of testimony you want you want the testimony that when God spoke you listened and you obeyed yes I mean you know I told the Lord I said see the devil I'm gonna tell y'all something - devil really hit me with a bad spirit of a week or so ago now think it is real bad it was like I was about to lose my mind and everything and when I came to myself I sold there were you in trouble I said I can't fight you I said but I'm gonna fight you I said you awakened something in me I said everybody I get a chance to witness - I'm a witness - hallelujah I witness - I started that day I went to a bra to this fella I tried to give him the church he wouldn't come I didn't then when I didn't get this one some the sky I witness to some time ago call me says hey I'm coming your church Sunday I see yes Lord hallelujah let me tell you something there were situations that I didn't know how to deal and I had to give him over to God and then and did last week amen I don't know what to pray something changing I'm telling you my wife called me about a victory that happened today I can't talk about it because it's too personal but God gave me victory in another situation ha cuz when I pray I believe God go answer huh when you pray and believe that God is gonna answer then God will answer hallelujah y'all believe that when you are believer how can God refuse you the thing is we need to endure because Satan is going to try to make you think God is a liar God doesn't answer his word and God answer every word your prayer requests he answered them some time he might say no but he ain't gonna leave you hanging he gonna let you say no in your spirit is no some way or another you love the Lord think about it Jesus was so in tune to the will of the Father the Bible said he could have why do you think they had this in here he could have called 10 legions 10,000 angels why do you think they had that in there he thought just wasn't equal you hear that was facts these are facts he could have called God gave him his choice an option he could have option out or stayed in it he could have called 10,000 angels but then he understood that's not the way it's supposed to happen he not my will but thine be done oh come on folks not my will but thine be done he could have called 10,000 even brother branham said those angels was there anything in the trees everywhere said all you had to do was move one finger it was all it would have been all over he had a choice God always gives us a choice but in order for God to vindicate you your will must become his will you understand me no matter how you might have a choice you might listen say Lord deliver me but is this what God wants to do at this present time see God wants us to go through things it's character-building and when you say well Lord I want to be more like you do you know you ask him for troubles it is okay I don't care what I go through Lord if they gotta take me to the guillotine that's okay as long as I know you with me none of the saints of over afraid because God said I'll never leave him nor I will forsake you so when they went through the fire they knew he was going to be there when they were getting ready to cut their heads off he knew they knew he was going to be there whatever they were going to do whatever Satan's plan was was not going to be disturbed by their human emotions and elements because they knew God was always with them why he promised it is that okay Jesus could have called but he went what he says but how then tell the Scriptures be fulfilled if I call these legions and they come to my rescue then there won't be a cavalry did we would have been locked in our sins but the Bible said for the joy of the UH what he he sowed the joy of the future he said his face like a flint see he knew that afterwards what it was going to reap cuz he was the one that he was the author of the law each seed shall bring forth of this kind so he knew that once he died because he said now this seed by soul only is of no value but it must die it must rot in order to bring forth hallelujah every seat and what happened God's allowed Christ to die so that we can live oh I don't know whether you can see it like I'm seeing it that's listen if I want to be dead I'm on the roof this if it wasn't for my chest movie you wouldn't know I was alive you understand me but God gave us life that we might have it more abundantly don't you people got it got it you know got it inches oh I am on our door don't not want maturity and in this day there's a lot of children that have more there's a lot of children with more chip maturity then grown-ups maturity you understand me but he don't ever want you to forget your child like y'all understand me he said in order to get there you must be at a child child children fussing fighting in a laughing plane they laugh and brave and they fuss and fight but you better not talk about their best friend hmm I'm telling you my baby with my grandbaby it meant he's smart as a whip and you know he's he's got a lot of energy so I'm talking to his older sister some things about his mom which I probably shouldn't have said and he said don't you beat my from the back he picked up on it I didn't call her name don't you beat it don't you be talking about my mama guess what he said my mama is good character I don't even know he knew the word you see when I'm trying to say you know he looked like the Talbot in this thinking he was mature he understood God is so good to me he corrects me a lot and that's the way I want I want I want to be the corrected you love the Lord let me listen Matthew 717 I want to bring something to you because I want y'all to understand nothing happens by chance God is he God be he has to prove us he has to prove us we have to be tried we've got to go through things right and don't you know that God even our gain some time for you to fall whoo you don't believe that explain Samson story do you think God didn't know Samson was going to fall it was part of his plan and God knew what Samson aim was gonna be even though he didn't know it hallelujah Oh what about the story Ruth do you think God did not allow Ruth a husband and family to backslide on purpose who understand the mind of God but he knew he had he had he had excuse me I said I'm Naomi Naomi's husband and family to backslide because there was a roof over there how were they going to get Ruth being into Jerusalem of Bethlehem how God allowed it amen and God allowed their lives to be lived in front of Ruth she was a more - but she was converted under their ministry think about it she knew that their God was God so much so when she followed Naomi she said yo God be my god yo people be my people how many y'all would do that see that I'm saying but it's the end result in what God is looking at oh come on somebody what if God would have spoke the word and all of us would appeared in heaven just like but God wanted you to know good and evil he didn't do it himself but he allowed the vessel Lucifer because Lucifer was an opposite of Christ he understand me and he knew that to know good and evil you would become gods which you were all along but you needed to know that negative part come on somebody you know I never understood why you had to put salt and cake all of that in you got baking powder yes so all of those ingredients help that thing rise up and be it's nice and it is and God uses these earthly ingredients to form and fashion your character after this there will never be another Lucifer ah because Gordon got all that devil out of you yahudim say over there you and I won't have to worry about no tears and sorrows no pain they'll never be a revolting a god against God ever will be singing Amazing Grace how sweet the sound knowing Amen that God not only I just love I love him because I realize he's forming God's out of us and we know he don't tell us the story how he came to existence but we know he's eternal he had no beginning no ending we can't comprehend but at the same time he's given us a part of eternity and one of these old days we may even come to understand it I don't know but we'll be so much like him is that the word yes sir when God put told him to pick up the pen and write and then he wrote it he said the broader be just so much like her he'll he'll put the pulling out of heaven hallelujah listen people you got to understand the Pentecostals you might call them live fire but at least they got something yeah Oh y'all don't say a minute brother branham said it's the same anointing same rain different seed that's the basis of the message right well if that rain gonna cause them to act the way they do I want some of it is that right Oh y'all don't get quiet brother ever say the seed the wheat and the tares my point is this Amen you're not gonna get anything from God the way you want without crying out that the truth hallelujah but that's a law he said you know no matter how scientific this world get become he said it a baby needed food he said okay honey when you need something from mama just ring the bell he said it'll never work it is a law of God when that baby wanted something they cry out you know rang the bell ring and it's true we're getting into a condition now and I don't mean no harm I love clapping hands but you know what if you go clap hands you need to open your mouth with it cuz now we're getting into this mr. Hollywood worship and nobody opening their mouth God won't you know open you my heart he's not the fruit of your lips our characteristic character it's produced by God you know that you know that hallelujah I was telling my church I said you know God is building masterpieces in us right and he uses Moses as a symbol and you know how Michelangelo chipped him away I said have you ever tried to chip something on especially in woodwork and it won't work just the way and now you got to get a bigger one hmm sometimes God got to get a bigger chisel because of stubbornness you don't want the big one yeah you don't want the big one you want the one that you know he's gonna delicately chip chip chip chip but he come to a place like a not something that he's gotta put a little bit more force on it don't cry don't worry about it God is just shaping you yeah I look at me like I know what I'm talking about on ahead to big chips before this ain't something I'm just saying I've been there amen but now that I understand I want the little ones when I hear them speak I want to be able to move you love the Lord I hope this is making sis I'm preaching about his inspiration but I want you to understand see when we talk about seed and it's so important that we understand what we're talking about Jesus Christ is the seed of God say Amen is that right he is the seed of God now when we talk about baptism of the Holy Ghost we're not just talking about you know are being filled but we're talking about oh I got an anointing of blood a spiritual blood gene entering the seed of God that he planted within us before the foundation of the world that's your birth hello that's your birth that's when God comes in that seed and brings life to it you've been born again right but you haven't produced the baby yet you know how the baby is produced by pushing and a lot of screens see people don't want to my brother and say this is the only kind this message can bring acts 2:38 streaming and Harlan babies see why he does you know my god because God knows it doesn't matter what part of the country you come from you know how to scream labor is something that every woman knows about it doesn't matter whether you're black white yellow pink striped or whatever you know what labor is y'all know what I'm talking about right my daughter I don't know there's a stage in that birth she called it the Ring of Fire she said that it that part is about it it's like it's gonna take your mind and you thinking I can't go any further and then the doctor says now it's time to push but the point is when that lady comes at that point that's why I'm trying to tell people about church how much time I got really well that's what I tell people about church don't come up here with coming false labor oh I want to hold it go and then you get down to the altar five minutes ten minutes no you ain't got that kind of pace to get it that quick somebody be but most people don't some people have to really labor and you know a lot of the churches don't took that out out of it it's still real right I mean brother Jess and I just witness there the women's retreat God coming in and sweeping the place people being filled with the Holy Ghost ha they came with a sincere mind they came with a determination there was like Jacob I'm not going to let you go until you bless me and God bless them but we want this little easy your Baptist experienced Methodists or something Catholic you know whatever how they do it you know what I got it now oh you want the little Eucharist oh yeah I was so shocked I was listening to a Christian about a Catholic place and they they got this thing with their people supposed to look forward to going and get the Holy Eucharist not ever see I pick it on the body but my point is sometimes people don't understand they just don't understand God is not a cookie he's not a wafer he called himself the bread of life and did you know before he become the bread of life he was that that that see but that she didn't become red until after it was crushed your understanding that she'd had to be crushed and made into a flowering type of substance in order to make the brain and every seed of God must be crushed come on somebody what was God doing I will show you your will see Samson had a will and brother branham said it like this he said he gave God his strength when God wanted his heart right God don't want your strength he loves it he loves you when you work in the church and do things but that don't save you and here it was he found out that his heart wasn't given to God because he kept running after the women hello but because he was seeing him because God was on a mission God put his eyes out he took away his pride took away his arrogance took away his strength his physical strength and guess what he did put him on the grinders wheel and while he was walking he was symbolically showing what God was doing to Samson crushing Samson crushing Samson round and around and around and around and around oh I did this fog come this way again yeah you ain't ready yet come on God took that wheel and he crushed Samson so much I can see something crying and you know whatever and I'm gonna tell you something when God crushed you you will cry yes you will repent when God crushes you you will repeat y'all hear what I'm saying but listen it's all in the making of God he had to go that way did you know Amen that's whether the bread that we called manna came down and seed for that same seed had to be crushed but God said I was that bread of life y'all hear me so they had a look little Sheena look crusher they put the seed an egg question made I thought the man was already you know ready to eat like he was you know perhaps it was like like sesame seeds and all I don't know but in order to make bread it had to be crushed and so when Jesus that communion breaks that bread and gives it to you it's all not only there's a simmer that you're part of him but he's saying you see you must come in this form and when you in this form you a part of me every seed must because don't think this is an easy ride God is going to bring every one of us into that place but after he takes you out of that place like you did Samson the Bible says Samson kill Luke fill the stars in his death because until you get to the place that you really and willing to die to yourself you're not there yet and that God's will live his will must live you love the Lord give me a little bit more fear you know they don't use in fearing nothing you know we I just heard the probably God say the other day he said don't feel communism oh look at the North Korean and all that for us those who are true believers will be gold I don't have to feel what they doing that God preparing that table before me that's not my table oh come on somehow my tables and Lord suppers on a new yuck and you and I must realize that this thing's in something wrong if they can't see where we are in time I'm so happy listen I'm happy it's going home time you say what brother works you ought not be so happy I'm sorry but I ain't because I can't save the people that God can't say hello did you know there are people that God cannot say because they end them to be saved hello there is a general generation that loves their father the devil and that's what we're living in we're living in a time where people love Satan more than they love God ha there are his children with what we hated because we're not here oh I wish that let me show you something you see these two bottles here this is Jesus and that's the devil okay the only way there's no way I can become that there's no way this become that we are not transformed into Devils the Cisse was born Devils this see says we're born God's now we may been like the word God we may have looked like children of Wrath but only inside of this this prefer that flesh was a seed of God right this is why Jesus said a fountain the sweet fountain came bring forth filled water because it ain't in the DNA is not in the gene it's not in the composition of the sea hallelujah and this she can never bring forth righteousness or holiness because this seed didn't come from God it knows nothing about holiness still I'm saying so when the devil says to you oh you've gone to hell you said I can't God made sure I wouldn't buy the seed that he planted in me before the foundation of the world the only way I can go is switch to the place I came from that's why Jesus said I came from God I go back to God those like Lucifer those like Judas those like Esau that came from the devil they go back to him God's not worried about his children coming to the light they can't help it why you say that because he said my sheep heareth my voice and the stranger they will not follow oh it looked like a lot of choosing hey but the thing I love about it because God chose it he did the choosing before the foundation of the world now understand me now I don't fully understand this but God based a history of predestination upon the things that we chose at that time whatever we chosen we did God then he'll stand with us now you love the Lord I gotta take a little while excuse me I'm almost done almost done just a thought I was telling my church the hardest thing for a pastor to do is get the people to see his vision God do you struggle brother you don't have to answer that but my point is it's the truth you know I got people in my church who's been with me for 10 years and and that's all they've been this thing with me and I said Lord I said I've tried to do missionary work I try to get people out there but there's nobody we want to sacrifice nobody who want to do anything nobody you know and then I found out that in most churches at least mine once I bring somebody in you know you got those they're waiting for you to bring the fish so they can clean it I don't need you to clean the fish icon go catch your own fish am I making sense you know you coming to church and the first thing they see somebody and the ain't got on a dress or ain't long enough oh you did an x-ray on you know that made them feel accomplished are you going down and looking at them you know people are sitting if they already sensitive when they come to church they're looking for love not criticism then we get them in here and if they ain't change in a month she's been here long enough she ought to know better now how long did it take you it's God who gives the revelation when God gives a revelation to an individual you'll never worry have to worry about them going backwards on it is that right it's the truth why can't we love people when they're different when God loves all of us and we're all different anyway I don't know God had that for somebody listen I preached a message I'm a preaching on this mess it's perfect because everybody you go everywhere you go people say perfect perfect perfect you know oh that's perfect you know go do this for me you go do they're perfect you ain't near perfect you know me they don't understand God is the only one that's perfect and the only thing that makes us perfect because God is in us your flesh ain't perfect mine is not right how can anything perfect die nothing that's perfect can die this come by some fault something flawed is what brings death and if it's perfect it can't die God is the only one that's perfect but he said be perfect for your father which is in heaven who I love that he didn't say God which is in heaven he said father which is in heaven your father which is in heaven so if God is perfect and imperfect if I'm born of him so I cannot die oh lord help me Jesus reason why I'm saying all of this is this we're coming to a time listen people you must know the word understand it was the word that he was tried with when Jesus out of all that he had suffered the devil came to him when he was almost at the end of his fast and tempted him or what the word misplacing it giving a different twist if he wasn't the word he could have possibly flunked the death but because he was the word he is the author and the finisher of it he caught it just like the other day I read a quote I didn't finish it and it comes out I think it's called the result of decision brother branham said even the prophets are deceived sometimes I just left it that day hey I know what you talked about he's never deceived on the word but he was working with this Jacob and Esau when Jacob came and disguised himself and Esau God blinded the prophesize God blinded the prophets all right just think he goes on like Nathan said unto David do all that was in your heart and God said you spoke makes me out of turn no no no he can't do that right so you see by God's God's grace God allows those things but if a man is truly born again if he got the Holy Spirit of God in him or even if he's just seed when Jesus did all he let me change them God will put something your way to see the weather you're gonna fight the stand on leaving did you know brother Ellen say that sometimes God have put things in your way you said what do you mean he said to those seventy except you eat my flesh and drink my blood he was cleaning house getting rid of all that make believe us come on at that point in time they should have stayed but because they had to process it what I tell people the worst thing you can do is try to process God where to come by faith in that processing you ain't got to see it you believe it your faith will give you sight right I'm almost done so anyway I look at these things I'm saying this to you and myself when God's began to take you to the chest don't think that God is not with you first of all he promised you you believe the promise I'll never leave you nor will I forsake you well I don't feel like he's listening who told you yet you got to feel it you don't have to feel it somebody sent me this look capture about this this was some from Africa and and and and this intellectual man was arguing with these children because they were saying how God is real and I love the Lord and this net and in the man said well have you ever seen him no have you ever felt him no well he said that don't make sense then God don't exist and the little boy said hey sir have you ever seen your conscience oh yeah he used another word I don't know whether was a memory or something he said have you ever seen it have you ever no no he said well then you don't make no sense so yo you ain't got no sense see if you came you didn't you never seen your sense but you say you got it but you never seen it so because you you've never seen your sense that means it doesn't exist so that means you've got no sense I thought that was really funny I mean it's your true people try to say things to you and they way of course you love the Lord folks I know this is elementary but my point is this everybody's working with your mind but this thing right here could be full of the knowledge of Malachi 4 and you know you won't change as long as this thing is in your head and ain't gonna change you it's the heart issues of life flows from this place right as a man thinketh in his heart see so you got to understand when you see and I just don't want to be see I don't want nobody else to be deceived I mean you know I've got my children I got my church and I said to myself I don't travel this Christian road for a long time and I don't see I don't know hundreds of more people leave God because of some silliness like God is to blame in closing you need to be vindicated you need vindication in your life you as individual signs and wonders oh wait to come to church well I want to see a miracle let your life be that miracle and let God show miracles in your life he wants to I've seen God do two things in the last month that there was no way I could have done it and I'm a pretty this way I saw two families two different families who don't even know each other husband and wife ready for divorce and God brought him back together supernaturally God has brought them back together now I didn't have nothing to do with it the only thing I could do was pray don't tell me what God can't do I know what God can do and I really believe that if God can take somebody's Muller somebody's animal and bring it back home he can bring your husband your wife home hallelujah just got to have enough love in your heart to receive them you love the Lord People of God I let me read this now what's the matter with the Pentecostal church tonight too much differences as soon as you get saved you start this way and a little trial comes along and you fall off and you go all this way and that this way and ups and downs and fusses and fights and carry on until how could God trust you would think those things to adopt you into the kingdom of God into the possession give you heir to all the spiritual benefits if the church would only hell together and quit fussing and splitting up and arguing over little baptisms and things like that you've been a lot better off and one church against the other he's a that isn't sons of God God can't trust you and my point is this when when things come and God sends them every trial you go through God has ordained it God has never said oh I didn't know that was happening everything you go through good or bad what I can tell you now before I became a Christian how many times God saved my life when I didn't even know him but he knew me he knew me he knew you and he protected you you think God has protected you all the time today and so that you can be lost I was telling my church in closing I said you know what I said God and it you've heard me say this before and none of these is or not I said God come along any cause of millions of people he detoured them in the wilderness for 40 years 40 whole years fine because in his mind Rahab was on the other side when they loved Egypt Rahab wasn't ready and God made them wandering in the wilderness that wandering wasn't in vain but that wandering was all ordained for God and what was it doing 15 it was separating the wheat from the tan and that that's what you must understand you're tried when the farmer go out there in the field Amen and bring in the wheat one of the first thing you get along right it's the threshing floor you got beat Bob you enjoyed the blessings first let him get come the BT City you so glad that you've been chosen to combine them pick you up right yeah but that ain't nearly done yet you've got to go through the threshing-floor you gotta be whooped God gotta break you away from that ciao hey y'all you think it's all over now I'm gathered it to the gardener you know it's fine but then somebody gonna come and buy some wheat and they want to make some bread and now you gotta be crushed process huh you got to go through it in order to be consumed you understand and that's all I want bring on the beatings if that's what it takes you know what I mean all I know is my mind is set on heaven now that's all I want I don't want to be left behind because of some silly thing right you know I this suit was given to me and it was so funny cuz I saw this brother with a suit on some months ago away uh same kind then when I saw him with the suit he didn't know it was given to me so I didn't know what he thought was he's like mice and he just went in Baltimore you know people think like that well you know so I had to tell about that's all brother I said ah I say this is exactly like my I said what brother I said it was a gift but it was a gift I had to tell him you know because people have strange ways about them you know they think that the manufacturers make one kind of a suit only one and they got it that was it so if you go buy one right it's not your is not you don't have a right to buy a suit like mine now it might sound silly but people think like that folks you know and my thing is you know that's carnal that that doesn't make sense I wouldn't care me about it first of all as I'm concerned he can come to my house right now I wish he was my size I give him all he wants you know I learned that I don't have a favorite suit per se that if I knew somebody needed it I wouldn't give it up I learned the lesson with tides people see your tyloo I like that that's okay you didn't have it but in the back of my mind I'm thinking I can go buy another one like it see that wasn't right that's just what y'all understand me that just wasn't right I gave it away because I knew I could get another one the same way same God and then one day I gave at Iowa and I couldn't find the same right now how do I do I feel right like I've been I've been cheated but what it was I was dishonest I wasn't pure in my heart you know me I gave it to him because I knew I could get another but God wants you to get when you know you can't give another one see that's the kind of giving God wants that kind that you know it's not looking for some reward you see Christians are great I can't explain it you can't help if you're a real Christian you cannot help it you know you'll be just like Martin I got one code in order to save this man's life I'm gonna cut this code in half he gonna have half and I'm gonna have half right that's Christians you can't help the Christ in you will compel you to do the things that Christ would do in all circumstances and that's how you know it's real because now you're doing things that you know that you would not have been capable of doing yourself those are the kinds of things that count that's what really counts when Christ is in you it's not like the probably God said well I you know I don't smoke no more I don't drink no more I don't I don't do this no more no no you need a birth anyway cuz I Richard on who to say hey I hadn't done it all from my youth I did it all and Jesus said would come follow me probably God said he called that man to be an evangelist and he denied it he turned it down he said with the gift that was in him was in him even when he was in hell he wanted this go back and evangelize you see what I'm saying so my point is don't whatever is in you this is another miracle I'm gonna tell you something I've had a brother with me Amen for years play the piano used to be the top-notch piano in the Lutheran Church but he wouldn't play for me and just the other day he says not only he's gonna play for me but he's gonna play with the other musician I got all I could see was I'm a happy Christian folks I enjoyed being a Christian I don't want to be not now I'm enjoy being a Christian you know it's not a burden to me the thing that burdens me is when I don't measure up

Jesus you know and I went to this church in Arizona I'm sacrificing my time because I'm tired I don't sing and everything at the concert and I'm going to this church to get refilled or get touched again or something like that and I go up and I got a nice quiet and everybody sitting in there all fires like they did some Methodists some church and you be the match since the Church of fire when they come in you coming in this church you don't worry about nobody she saw hear what they were saying but that was a part of mine she thought oh I'm a worship we don't worship we don't need a group he need you and when that when you come in it people say well you know I know I know a few I have system she's my house I call him that Trojan horse but nobody was gonna praise God and there was a

the Lord hey Maria people I'm tellin ya I see i'ma tell you something nothing's wrong with him you might not like him but there's nothing wrong with him right the problem is not the heels those same heels brought revivals to America it's not the end it's the people who speak in the Hills yes sir yes sir when those people probably know say some no song hae sung them with all there are and if you sing it with all your heart you get the same result but I see I see brother Jesse and I can hear his voice over all y'alls it's not supposed to be with the power of all your bosses y'all push it back off the pulpit don't think about how you sound noise make a choice for noise let's go you Love You Man appreciate what he's doing in this place that you're grateful that you've been chosen as the Bride of Christ to represent him in this part of the country then he'll know if I worship my praise not just here everywhere you go but especially here because you know he's don't meet you here I guarantee you you will see a sweet come here any of that you probably don't could never happen any car moving back things is usually not that you love the Lord keep going I you got something it's nothing but the title I want to be vindicated I am the bride and I want to be I want God to vindicate me surprise and whatever I do I want to do it just like how you know is God when God talk to you I can't explain it if I could I would be supernational I just know what he talks to me I know it's when is him I can't explain them if I tried to the devil tried and he'll try to imitate any confusion I don't need him to do that so I don't try to explain how I know but when he spoke to me and told me about that ladies shoes and then he rocked a department store about ready to shout when she says I don't I don't know what the other number I was a dad I know I said it it must be rad I know been so happy my life by somebody shoes because God told me to do so and I was so grateful because I just don't I just totally everybody and then God you set the stage that's all my church and I come from this I told my church si si I don't know what y'all message people say we don't do that I can't everybody else I just know who I am God started me out on the corner when I was in the Apostolic Church I knew by revelation to baptize people in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I never baptized Jesus only I baptized and named the Lord Jesus Christ and I would get out on that corner me and a couple of sisters and a brother too we get out then singing and maybe all of us sing it and I had my tambourine I play the tambourine and we witness we had see our sisters or brothers or the present and we agree mr. purple we got a baptized oh yes I know that cars and when they would yes anyway [Laughter] [Music] I'm nervous person desires you know I think you said a lot of things that are important don't you the vision for the church I've I shared it I think appreciate last last year in vision for the church is the fullness of Pentecost would be in the variety that's the vision because that's the prophecy we can't have a vision outside of the Word of God how many we that's the vision it's enough saith the Lord and so if we want that we've got to eventually you're not to sacrifice so much money to sacrifice the greatest privilege of our lives to be invited to not ask ourselves has not vindicated me that I'm going to be or we never want to get in a spot where that Satan can guilt us into being deceived the Lord the Holy Spirit of Truth [Music] we believe your spirit is here today that's truth so we can truly know have we been vindicated else ask ourselves have I really cried out to God for my desires I really labored in prayer for my desires falsely my brothers or do you see each tear I cry or as we saw when we remember Sharon out on Wednesday we know the prophecy when other nations we just don't know how you're gonna bring it to pass I don't know how you're gonna read their battle and I know you're gonna bring it to pass I hope we just have a strong hand a thing that I can hold that key of the word the word says the fullness of Pentecost the word says our stood the word says that we change the moment with you my help my hand of faith to be strong to hold that brothers despite maybe wandering around the lunar this Lord we'd say no symbol or despite the delay this you're allowing time to keep passing Lord relying things to get darker Lord our light shines brighter in darkness we thank you for your service you know my heart Lord I want to see
