TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Laughter] [Music] let's have a time of Prayer here by God's grace we had a little traffic on the way here so got here later than we wanted to get here but anyways are there any prayer requests for tonight I don't have any written down does anybody have any Haven Amen honey praise the Lord any other requests tonight Haven another one okay I remember our two friends honey that's a good request okay well let's just then pray for a safe travel for brother Troy who's coming in Friday night he's supposed to land at about 11:20 on Friday night so let's pray for brother Troy I do have three announcements here remember we have service Friday night I'm sorry Saturday night at 5 p.m. forgive me Saturday at 5 p.m. with brother Troy and then just one service on Sunday 11 a.m. with brother Troy I'll be taking him to the airport after first service because I think he has an early flight in the afternoon if not then he'll eat with us and then fly out I'd like to have communion but not this weekend but let's do it next weekend the 22nd of April and we'll have two services but I promise to keep it short so we can have communion in the in the evening so April 22nd also now to email everybody I just been feeling led to have communion so let's do that April 22nd let's do a p.m. service and then have communion that day the Lord's Supper one more announcement I shared this with brother Adam there's been two Canadians who have been going around to message churches interrupting their services and last week they were in southern Ohio and West Virginia if I'm not mistaken so I'm sorry no Albion Albion so they were up a brother Jim's church last Sunday night and they tried to interrupt the service and so they got removed from the service so I told brother Adam if they walk in well if they walk in while we're having service I guess we'll let them sit down but if they start interrupting it then I'll stop service and Adam and I will make sure they leave if they don't leave we'll call 911 their main thing is they're trying to cause division with worship and they're saying if we're singing any song that was written in the last few years it's satanic and so we're off the word and they've been really causing a lot of division they went to brother cams church and said some really awful things to brother cam and his family and like I said they were trying to interrupt the service last Sunday night in Albion up there brother Jim's Church so Jim called me on Monday and let me know about it he said just be prepared if they come by I don't know if they'll come by tonight I don't know if though I don't even know if they'll come to our church because we're so small but they've already visit our church once last year when brother Brian Hawkins preached in we were still having service in the other room Brian Hawkins preached on the Sunday night and they came to the service but Brian said they just left right afterwards they didn't say anything about the music so they've already been to our church one time I don't know if they'll come back again but since they were in the area at albi and I just thought I let Adam know I'll let you know so if I'm preaching and all of a sudden you hear me stop and say brothers you know are you the brothers that are causing division then Adam and I will try to talk to them we'll try to ask them to go out in the hallway we don't want to argue but we've got to ask them to move and then we ask them to leave if they want to debate about music cuz we're not here to debate tonight this is not a debate night and then if they don't we'd have to call the cops so and brother Adam has had a good point on the text he said brother Branham never did that and the brother Graham never would never support that in fact brother Graham tried to stay away from debates but if anybody wants to debate follow rules we could have one of those but it wouldn't be a service and there have to be rules and you know act like gentlemen and follow Christian standards and so forth like that but I just want to let you know if that happens so last last week when they were in I'm sorry two weeks ago when they were in Tennessee the pastors both called the cops and the cops escorted them off the grounds because they were causing such division and we actually actually can pray for those brothers tonight that'd be good that they'll get that spirit off them by God's grace are they worse telling people going in in the parking lot they were seeing sisters with you know two skirts that weren't all the way down to their feet and they were condemning them saying they were lost and it was just a real awful mess so we can just pray that there are two brothers from Canada I have their license plate and their vehicle so if you see a blue Ford Escape out in the parking lot and two brothers coming in we'll know who they are you know we'll ask them to leave or if they walk in here was some be quiet if they interrupt it then we'll have to have to remove them so that's an odd announcement usually don't have announcements like that to it that's part of the fanaticism I imagine that follows the message and we're thankful that God has given us truth in this hour okay so any other requests is at it so we have havens unspoken our two friends we keep praying for traveling mercies for the Troy and then the two brothers from Canada we'll pray to God will have mercy on them okay all right let's take those before the Lord here [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music]

let's get into the Word of God here tonight let's go to proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 it's going to be in house of Lord tonight by the grace of God it's good to see the Saints here tonight by God's grace nice to have brother Aaron brother did you drive from Mansfield yeah I thought so okay yeah if we were stopped for 10 minutes all of a sudden the Lord just opened this muscle then the Lord opened it up or something Dave ahead and praise the Lord hallelujah God is good proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 we'll go there by the grace Lord and also it's nice to have our brother with us here by God's grace what's your name again sir William I was gonna thought I was gonna guess William let's get brother waiting around with laws amen nice to have you sir all the way from Ghana is that right praise the Lord Amen well make yourself at home sir so good to have you here tonight by the grace of Lord proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 amen we've been looking at a little series on wisdom and we like to go a little bit further with that tonight I want to go back to that thought on my son here the instruction so we're gonna read proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 by the grace of the Lord proverbs chapter 1 verse 8 let's all read it together three two on three one two three my son here the instruction of thy father and forsake not the law of thy mother amen let's just have a word of Prayer let's just bow our heads if you ever need on your heart just make it known unto God here in God's presence Heavenly Father we come humbly yet boldly before the throne of grace Lord we realize we're nothing we realize we have no ability no merit of our own or we live by the merits of the blood of your son Jesus Christ we thank you for that blood that was shed oh the blood of Jesus that washes us white as snow Lord we're so grateful Lord God you've saved us by grace and now Lord that we're saved by grace we want to do works for you we want to express our faith Lord and do something for you Lord God bless us here tonight with your presence Lord speak to every heart dear God we just pray you'd have your way bless the visitors Lord God and thank you for safe travel for our brother William Lord and he can be with his grandchildren as his daughter and the family Lord we're so grateful for that Shirley you're a God of grace and mercy Lord so we give you praise and honor and glory in your house here Lord and blessed brother there and he's traveled so far and on the other saints that oppressed our way out to the house of God ministered to them by the Holy Spirit those live streaming as well we give you glory tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous bein seated praise the Lord so we want to look at this here tonight by God's grace we look at this thought on my son here the instruction so we got our wisdom series here I believe this is part 5 of this series and we just want to focus on all these times that Solomon by the Holy Spirit spoke directly to his son now it was probably ray of balm but it could have been just you know general to another son and of course we know also this applies not just to sons but also daughters because we know the wisdom is good for boys as well as for girls and if anybody ought to be interested in wisdom it ought to be the wise virgins of the message praise the Lord so we ought to have a great interest in the book of Proverbs and we ought to see the proverbs lived out in our daily lives if anybody should be wise if anybody should be walking in the commands of God and and be able to discern between the right path and the wrong path or a wise path and a foolish path it ought to be the wise virgins those who have their lamps trimmed and who have plenty of oil for the wedding procession praise God so we read our text here in proverbs 1 verse 8 now remember the message and purpose of Proverbs the youth so the young people are repeatedly admonished to pursue wisdom rather than foolishness you know Solomon is the author and he's just speaking to the young people to hear wisdom hear the word of God stay true to God's Word it's it's a direct message to the young people and so the youth should seek to become teachable rather than mockers scorners doubters sin lovers gang members they should seek to become like Christ amen and as we saw a few weeks ago there's 23 times that Solomon says my son and so we got about halfway through so I think tonight maybe we'll finish if the Lord's willing but I just thought as I read the book it was so striking he just he just kept saying my son my son and I thought my if the Holy Spirit wanted us to hear that and wanted them to hear that in the days of Solomon 3,000 years ago how much more does he want us to hear today amen to speak to our sons and our daughters that they should have the wisdom of the Holy Spirit and he remember he said hear ye children so he speaks to just all children four times and I think we covered all four of those if I'm not mistaken and member this is written from Solomon to his son at the very height of his wisdom mber proverbs was written at the height of his wisdom before he fell to all those wives and the idols that we looked at because he wrote Ecclesiastes at the very end of his life remember in Ecclesiastes he said I tried wisdom you know worldly wisdom I tried women I tried wine all these w's there's a list of like five W's and wisdom wine women he said I've tried all these and their vanity see because he had fallen he fell from the wisdom and he was his heart was more given to his wives than to the word amen and so it teaches us life can seem like vanity when you're not in the perfect will of God but when you're in the perfect will of God life is a joy life is happy life is righteous because the blessing of God rests upon your life amen it's exactly right and so this is written at their very height when he's closest to God we'd say when he's obeying God when he fears the Lord it's not when he's walking you know worshiping idols and and building a temples to idols to Molech and and baya Bale and all these other gods that he worship asked her often that was Ecclesiastes but this is where the Holy Spirit has really got ahold of his heart amen and he's walking the commands now let's review part 1 we looked at this we we saw that Solomon told his sons to do these things so our sons tonight we got malachite Elijah for our sons here tonight but it's - also our daughters amen so sons and daughters you need to do this you need to hear or obey the Word of God and sons and daughters you need to cry out and seek the fear of the Lord that's in chapter 2 you got to cry out and seek and ask God for wisdom for the fear of the Lord and then you've also got to accept God's chastening you got to learn that God is going to rebuke you sometimes God is going to spank you sometimes God is going to chasing you sometimes but you've got to get used to that because he only does it as a loving father he wouldn't chasing you or punish you or he wouldn't try you or allow you to be tried unless there was some good reason for it because he's perfect and in part one we saw we were to avoid evil company gangs of men that want to go be violent and kill people for a quick riches right we saw that in chapter one violent greedy men don't hang around people that are greedy and violent and then he warns stay away from strange women so you have to have your relationships in order your your marriage relationship your friends they've got to be god-pleasing relationships if you're gonna walk in wisdom because well as both Graham said the old proverb birds of a feather flock together amen now remember in part 1 also there were so many rewards children if you keep the Word of God honey want the rewards of God the greatest reward is eternal life proverbs called it the Tree of Life also most likely you're going to have a longer life if you serve the Lord you'll also have favor with God and with men and if you tithe and give offerings then your barns will be filled praise the Lord you'll have a life of pleasantness the Bible says you'll have a life of peace you will have deliverance from evil men and evil women if you choose the wise life I have pleasantness twice ok I didn't mean that you'll have health if you choose the the wise path you'll have good doctrine if you choose the wise path and the Bible says you'll have happiness if you choose the wisdom of the Lord amen I couldn't think of any better benefits than that praise the Lord and that's what we're grateful for so let's look at part 2 tonight now we'll start looking at new scriptures so get your Bibles right let's go to chapter 4 proverbs chapter 4 let's just take these my sons statements right out of the Bible here I was just inspired you know as I read through the Book of Proverbs I was just inspired to see my son my son and I believe it's something that we all can learn from don't you agree now so we start with verse 20 so in verse 20 through 27 Solomon gives his ninth this is the ninth time he says my son we've already gone through eight of them then because this is the ninth time the ninth out of 23 so proverbs 4 verse 20 let's look at that here now 20 says my son attend to my words incline your ear unto my say no incline of course we that means we got to humble ourselves and listen right got to incline your ear got a humble and listen let them not depart from nine eyes keep them in the mitts of thine heart for their life unto those that find them and health to all their flesh so here we have another promise that God will keep your body healthy if you keep the word of the Lord divine healing is a blessing or a favor or a reward to all those who walk in the ways of God that's right look at verse I'm sorry I want to make this statement right here remember your eyes and your heart are connected how we know that whatever we let in our eyes it has to impact our heart right so if we see good things our heart will be in a good condition if we see evil things our heart will be in an evil condition right so that's what the Bible says let's now keep your place there I'm gonna go to lamentations 351 the Bible teaches us plainly that whatever we see impacts our heart and so Solomon tells his son keep York my commands before your eyes so that means the children are going to read the Word of God right we've got to keep the children with their eyes on the word less video time and more time on the Word of God right because the eyes are going to affect the heart okay so it goes live lamentations 351 here let's read that by the grace of the Lord now this of course this is Jeremiah we know that lamentations 351 it says mine I effective mine heart because of all the daughters of my city so Jeremiah is he's lamenting for the destruction coming on Israel and he's seeing all the daughters being being violently a beaten and and carried away and taken captive and he's seeing all the young girls you know being taken captive and what he sees impacts his heart right and so what we see will impact our heart if we choose to see just jokes jokes jokes all the time we're not going to be in a sober attitude like we ought to be praise the Lord we'll just be a big Joker that day we don't want to be a Joker we want to be someone who can feel what the Holy Spirit wants us to feel that day but see in this case his eyes affected his heart now you know this when I preach this all the time second Peter 2 7 and 8 that's the story of lot and the Bible said lot daily saw things he saw and heard the evils of Sodom and it vexed his heart it tormented him so he would see homosexuals you know on the streets he would see violent gangs you know doing gang activities gang violence and it vet it tormented him everything that he saw it torment in his heart and God saved him because he was a righteous man amen and so we must expect that too if we watch you know violent news reports all the time that's going to affect us the wrong way yeah we have to know a little bit about the news but we should be more interested in God's news than the world's news because his news is always good news amen although it may be a trial it's still good news because all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord so see we've got to keep the commands of God in front of the eyes of the children they've got to be more readers than they are viewers is that right Church that true absolutely you know this is a video generation you know and everybody wants to just do video video video all the time but the best way to learn is to learn through reading reading and writing because it takes all your focus right when you watch a video you can do other things you know you you know we get people get used to that but when you sit down with the book with the Word of God and you focus on that word there's no other apps that can open up while you're reading your Bible there's no notifications that are going to drop down from the top of the Bible and say oh you better call so and so oh you better get supper ready it's just God's Word and now the Holy Spirit's got you alone and now there's a chance you can hear from the Holy Spirit that's the first command to young men my son so there's my son my son keep the Word of God in front of your eyes keep the Word of God in front of your eyes look at verse 23 this is beautiful look at us keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life now look at the word keep in the Hebrew the word keep means to put in jail or prison or a guardhouse didn't brother Adam preach a message called Paul a prisoner of Christ the Bible said keep your heart with all diligence other words keep your heart locked up in a prison with all your efforts don't let your heart wander out and desire other things keep it locked up keep it focused on the Word of God only with all diligence we should put all of our effort into keeping our heart just solely connected and solely interested in Jesus and His Word that's what the word keep means recently we were using at the middle school at Copley we were using the scripture for dating you know because they all start to date when they're in fifth and sixth grade and so we use this scripture I thought was very powerful you can't you know those and these kids aren't in the message or anything but we're trying to teach them true Bible doctrine and they've got to know you can't start dating it you can't start liking girls and you can't start liking boys you've got to put your heart you got to put your emotions in a prison until the right time don't give your heart away too early don't get infatuated fall in love with Christ amen don't give your heart away and don't be distracted because out of the heart flow the issues of life praise the Lord now so we need to remember we got to be a prisoner to Christ and not our phones amen not our jobs necessarily we've got to work but we can't be a prisoner to that we've got to be a prisoner to Christ the Spirit amen the rivers 24 put away from the afore word mouth this is still the same context he's speaking to my son and perverse lips put far from thee look at this verse 25 let thine eyes look right on and let thine eyelids look straight before thee so look the straight and narrow way today focus on the narrow way I love verse 26 it's beautiful this is a great thought for everybody here tonight ponder the the path of thy feet and let all thy ways be established turn not to the right hand nor to the left remove thy foot from evil I thought this was just such a good a good thought for all of us you know we ought to do this every service we ought to just you know before service you ought to sit maybe with your your your your face in your hands and just have some time with the Lord there and think about what direction is my life going ponder ponder the path of your feet what ways you know we ought to be able to do that say Lord am i walking in the ways of God this week have I had a good week where I've walking in your path or have I stepped out of the past some way that's though that's the trouble today we get so busy with the world weather Ram said nervous tensions and Laodicea right the pressures of riches the nervous tensions soft living all these spirits we got a battle we get so caught up in that we forget to ponder our steps and really think about what kind of life am i living but wisdom will tell you slow down and look at the path that you're walking in wouldn't that be good for our children they can see what how am i walking in my Christian walk in our home how am i am i am i stay are my eyes on the narrow path or if I got my eyes officer does something look more enticing or or more valuable than the Word of God it's so important to stop meditate and ponder your pass that you're walking in can you say amen to that many times we know we don't slow down that's why it's good to pray before service that's why it's good to pray after service spend some time stopping what you're doing and pondering where am I actually going with my life where are my feet walking I think the enemy wants us to not ponder our ways he wants to just get us so busy we're just getting well I'll just do my regular habits I'll just do what I always do we need to do what God wants us to do praise the Lord now go to chapter 5 let's look at it now look at this is the tenth time the tenth time Salman says my son let's go to verse one proverbs chapter five and this is important of us member not just it's for the young people of course but this is important for all of us to see proverbs 5 verse 1 through 6 this is another portion of scripture where he's talking to my son verse 1 my son attend unto my wisdom and bow thine heart to my understanding that thou mayest regard discretion and that thy lips may keep knowledge now let's just stop right there so we want our children to have discretion which is caution we want them to be cautious so before they make a decision we want them to consider is this the right decision right and I want I want my son and I know you want your son and your daughters to listen to you and and and regard your teaching the Bible said he says bow you're in other words I want my son to act like me I want my son to have my understanding of how to live my life like I love in the morning I'm not bragging anything but you know hard as adults I love in the morning when I'm up I'm praying on my knees and my children walk in because I want them to see what my life looks like when they're not around right I kind of enjoy that when they walk in the prayer closet and they don't know I'm in there I want them to have my understanding I don't want them to follow some other man or some other person I want them to have my understanding and follow the law of their mother right that's the word of the Lord that's what the scripture says and you always know what kind of knowledge your children have by what comes out of their mouth because the Bible says there let their lips keep knowledge so we need to make our children and teach them to memorize the scripture and say it out loud humph adults want to say out loud the Word of God as well see we got to be careful well just children need to say the Word of God we're the ones who have to create the atmosphere right it's up to us we've got to speak the word we've got to keep the knowledge and we've got to make sure their lips speak the Word of God because now he's now he goes into verse verse three look at verse three he says your lips seem to keep knowledge but in verse three he sews the other side somebody else is going to have lips two it's going to be the strange woman for the lips of a strange woman dropped as a honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil but her n is bitter as wormwood sharp as a two-edged sword her feet go down to death her steps take hold on hell lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life her ways are movable that they now cants not know them now later on if we get there tonight the Bible says the Word of God is like honey can you say amen to that well here it says here a strange lips of a woman are like a honeycomb - you see see how slick Satan is see how attractive sin is sin is pleasurable for a season sin is not as good as the Word of God but to your flesh if you're not careful if you don't silence the voice of a tempter it can sound as sweet as honey but we must remember the true honey the true sweetness is the word of the Lord nothing will be sweeter for your soul than the Word of God but look how the cow look how deceptive Satan is he can get a woman or a man for the sisters you can get a young man Satan can anoint that young man they're trying to take the virtue from our sisters are the young girls or are our older ladies you know in adultery or something like that Satan can so annoying that it'll sound so good in my it might even feel so good but it will take them down to the depths of hell that's exact right and so as a father Solomon he warns his son be careful of a smooth-talking woman be careful of a smooth-talking man when they talk outside of the word of God so what would Solomon warned his son in this passage passage he would warn him about a strange woman who can talk real sweet just because somebody talks smoother than oil and sweet as a honey don't believe them examine it by the Word of God that's right because her steps take a hold on hell is that right that's exactly right now look at verse 7 now verse 7 he addresses the children 5 verse 7 so now so he spoke to his son verse 1 through 6 and now he starts speaking to all the children verse 7 to 14 hear me now therefore o ye children and depart not from the words of my mouth remove thy way far from her so now he keeps going back to this woman and come not nod to the door of her house now we can type this as denominations denominations right are like women and they can preach so smooth all they talk about is the love of Jesus all they talk about you know is how much Jesus loves all them but when they justify wickedness when they say it's okay sisters to cut your hair now they've entered into an abomination for it's an abomination to justify righteousness is that right it's Obama I'm sorry abomination to justify wickedness forgive me when they say it's okay to cut your hair it's it's okay or to go to movie shows and it's okay to listen to worldly music and all these things what they've done is they've made a deceptive religion right that's Satan's religion Satan's Eden and it's smoother than oil oh we're all brothers and sisters oh we're all going to heaven well we don't know that right but we know those whose names are on the Lamb's Book of Life we'll keep all the Word of God that's how you know that's how you know whose names are on the Lamb's Book of Life those who keep the word of the it's exactly right so Salman now warns all the children be careful of the strange woman or the strange man of course for the sisters don't come to the door of their house lest thou give thine honor verse 9 unto others and thy years unto the cruel verse 10 less strangers be filled with thy wealth and the Labour's be in the house of a stranger and now mourn at the last when that thy flesh and thy body are consumed look at verse 11 I think I'm going to 14 yes and now mourn at the last and thy flesh and their body are consumed Sarver's 12 and say how have I hated instruction and my heart despised reproof and have not obeyed the voice of my teachers nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and the Assembly Amen don't you know that's what a lot of people do they'll make one decision and based upon that wrong decision they'll spend the rest of their years in sin you see it a lot with marriages you know someone will be married and they'll get divorced and as soon as they take a second husband or wife and they've entered in that relationship they're basically ruining the rest of their life because adulterers and fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God I wonder how many adulterers married to three times look back and say my I've wasted all these years I should have listened to the voice of the pastor said stay married to that person that first husband or wife right that's what the scripture says here and they give all their energy and strength to a second or third or fourth marriage when it should have been given to their first spouse it's exactly right they give their honor they give their years unto the cruel all right now let's go next section here so the children are warned of strange women or we'd say evil relationships let's go then this is the 11th time he says my son verse 15 drink waters out of thine own cistern and running wells I'm sorry I'm sorry and running waters out of thine own well let thy fountains be dispersed tar lost my spot abroad and rivers of water in the streets let them be only thine own and not strangers with thee let thy fountain be blessed and rejoice with the wife of thy youth let her be as the loving hind and pleasant row that her breasts satisfy thee at all times and be thou ravished always with their love and why wilt thou my son see speaking to his son be ravished with a strange woman and embrace the bosom of a stranger so Solomon obviously must have seen many men leave their first wife and then go take another and something sang our wife is just like a well whether you drink from that well or that well it's still water and he's saying drink from your well amen keep your vows stay true to your promise to God don't go off to another well at just water it's the same experience it's still water be happy with your water amen hallelujah he's telling his son this and now what did Solomon do later he took too many wives he took too many wells and the church said a thousand wells can I say like that and brother and David took five hundred and by her brother ma'am say today and choosing him a bride he said still David was a man after the heart of God and that was under the Old Covenant right in the New Testament it's one man one woman right there's only one cause where you can put him away and that's unconfessed fornication like jesus said but see Solomon must have seen this and he says my son just keep your own life don't go after other women it's just another different it's just another well it's this same thing it's just a different well stay true just love your well better than others amen that's the word of the Lord this is what the Holy Spirit wanted a king to tell his next son his son who was going to be king next right look at verse 21 yea I'll finish the chapter for the ways of manner before the eyes of the Lord and he pondereth all of his goings to the Lord sits there now he wonders why is he doing this now of course he knows but the Lord thinks about everybody's life right his eyes are on all of our steps look at verse 22 his own iniquity shall take the wicked himself and he shall be holding with the cords of his sins so see we you know people get tangled up in their own sins right it's their own fault remember God does not tempt any man he's tempted when he's drawn away of his own lust and he tangles himself in his own sin his own lust right it's his own fault if he sin it's his own fault if she said it's her own fault they're tangled in what they wanted they thought it was better than the Word of God so God lets him get tangled up in their own sin but God is rich in mercy God is quick to forgive amen and God loves to set the captive free hallelujah amen verse 23 he shall die without instruction this is the adulterer now and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray so this is the wisdom he would give he said son love your wife only be intoxicated with her love so always make sure you just love your wife so much and she is the most sweetest thing that you have don't let anything become sweet other than your wife just put all your love and all your affection to your wife and the brother said don't fall in love with anything else always stay just always stay excited about your wife praise the Lord if not you'll go down the path to hell it's just another well that one other woman just another well he says be true to your well now let's go to chapter 6 here so in chapter 6 verses 1 3 and 20 Solomon says my son three more times are you enjoying this by God's grace I I just thoroughly enjoyed this I want to see what would a king say to his son a man who had all the power all the authority any of us have he had beyond any any power or wisdom any King had at that time Solomon was the greatest king in all the world he had there was no limits to his power to his authority his relationships what would a man like that say to us and we get to know it by the grace of the Lord verse 1 let's go to chapter 6 verse 1 alright verse 1 my son if thou be surety for thy friend now surety means a pledge you made a promise to your friend it also means a mortgage so I don't know if that means you pay their mortgage it means both if you be out surety or a pledge to your friend if thou has stricken thy hand with a stranger so you've heard a stranger now are snared with the words of your mouth so there's the promise you made a promise with your mouth or you've said something with your lips now are taken with the words of thy mouth do this now my son and deliver thyself when thou art coming to the hand of thy friend go humble yourself and make sure your friend so see many times we make promises and if we make a promise we better keep it this is what a king would tell his son don't make promises you don't plan to keep that's why Jesus said don't swear by the altar don't swear by the temple he said let your yes be yes and your no be or no but he said if you make a promise if you make pledge go to your friend and make sure you keep your pledge humble yourself right Church because really your friend is not going to forget they're gonna remember that you have something is that right humble yourself well I'm too tired I don't know uh he she mistreated me or he mistreated me psalmist said no go humble yourself keep your word that's the wisdom a king would tell his son amen look at verse 4 he says go or give not sleep to your eyelids nor slumber to the eyelids deliver thyself as a row from the hand of the hunter and as a bird from the hand of the Fowler so see it's better it's better that you keep your word then go to sleep because you'll be tormented by your promise right and God will make sure you keep your word - right somehow that person will keep asking or or that will just it will hover over your spirit you know that you haven't kept your word and so he says humble yourself go to your friend and keep your promise amen do we want to raise children that make promises they can't keep well let's meet up at let's meet about the church and pray and then you don't come to pray let's meet up and and we'll just have we need to talk and we need to do some we need to make a little transaction and then you don't show up you don't keep your word well I promise I'll help you out with so-and-so dollars and then you the day comes and you don't help them out with the dollars what kind of person are you program said you're no better than your word you and I we're no better Christians than our word so if we create an atmosphere or we create an expectation we better follow through with that expectation amen hallelujah because we're minor we're little creators aren't we glory amen keep the word keep your word amen he told this to his son now so he said my son in verse 1 and verse 3 now let's go down to verse 20 we'll skip down to verse 20 because it looks like he goes to his son again yeah proverbs chapter 6 verse 20 now remember especially for our sons here mal kind Elijah this is what a king would tell his son my son keep thy father's commandment and forsake not the law of your mother you see how see how mothers got to be a lawgiver at the home see how she's got to have a law it's got to be right or wrong a mother's got to be we have a real backbone that she don't compromise because then the children will learn to compromise mother what mother says mothers got to keep that word she's got a law and the church said she's the fifth gospel we looked at that on Sunday remember that before Matthew Mark Luke and John get to the child the gospel of mama gets to the child and it's got to be a law it's got to be right and wrong the children need boundaries the children need to know this is right this is wrong that's right the verse 21 I love this bind them continually a Paul 9 heart and tie them about thy neck amen glory just always remember what mom said okay girls look at me children look at me always remember what your mama tells you never forget it right now KY never forget what your mother tells you to do keep it around your neck because it'll be life to you it'll be health to you it'll be long days for you it'll be a blessing to you amen look at verse 20 when thou goest it shall lead thee when thou sleepest it shall keep thee and when I'm sorry and when thou wakest it shall talk with thee yep any of the dots ever heard the voice of your mom or dad in your head I have when I'm scared my voice of my mom comes in my head when she taught me a second Timothy 1:7 God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power love and a sound mind the voice of my mother still stays with me and children that ought to stay with you let the voice of your mother the voice of your father it will talk to you if you're willing to listen to it don't forget it don't push it off and say I don't listen to that mom or dad I don't want listen bind it upon your neck and listen to your parents amen glory verse 23 for the commandment is a lamp and the law is light and reproofs of instruction are the way of life amen to keep thee from the evil woman look when it goes back to this King is really concerned about evil women this King is really concerned about adultery and fornication right he's really concerned there's something really destructive about a sexual relationship that doesn't glorify God it's very destructive this so this is the what the fifth time I thought I wrote it up there oh this is the third warning of an evil woman he just keeps bringing it make sure you pray before you get married a man Loree he just again and again don't be involved with strange men don't be involved with strange women keep the law of God around your neck and the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman in verse 24 verse 25 especially for the but the young men lust not after her beauty in thine heart neither let her take thee with her eyelids see that makeup coming in with her eyelids painted eyelids don't let her take her take you with her eyelids right or the beauty that she pretends to have right because it's not true beauty it's lust look at this for by means of a horse woman a man is brought to a piece of bread and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life so that evil woman's like a predator trying to get some prey right trying to hunt and try to snatch these young people out of our grasp Satan's trying to come through and fly down like a predator and snatch up our precious children and we've got to protect them amen we've got to instill wisdom in their heart that they stay away from these kind of flattering smooth-talking women and men that's the word of the Lord look at verse 27 can a man take fire in his wisdom and his clothes not be burned the answer of course is no can a man lust in his heart and not be hurt by that no it's going to affect him can a woman lust over a man and not be affected by that no they're gonna fall back in their walk with God they're gonna fall into their permissive will of God but we've got to keep lust out of our hearts and stay in the perfect will of God if you take sin if you take fire in your heart you're gonna be burnt right what we need is the Holy Ghost and fire in our heart Haven and that'll bring out that other evil fiery that wild fire amen the real consuming fire of God will burn out the lusts of the flesh that's right can 1 in verse 28 can one go upon hot coals and his feet not be burned of course not so he both into his neighbor's wife who summer touches her shall not be innocent you cannot partake of adultery in the physical or in the spiritual and have it not impact you it's going to impact you you're gonna fall away from where you used to be with the Lord just like tonight you can't walk out of here the same way you're they're gonna be rejoicing praise the Lord for the word of God or you'll walk out of here so I was so boring I better go turn on my phone and watch something exciting I was watching listening to a preacher last week and he had a friend who worked in the movie business a preacher and so his friend was working on the new spider-man trailer now I don't watch movies and I don't preach it's okay to watch spider-man it's not okay but he said his friend was working on the new part three amazing spider-man movie I don't even know if it's out yeah I don't know but I was just like this preacher so I was listening to what he said and he said this preacher his friend invited him over and he was at his friend's house he said he said hey watch this 30-second trailer of the new spider-man movie and he said okay you know and he kind of compromised a little bit but he said he watches 30-minute 30-second video and he said within the first five seconds his heart rate started going way up because of all the action and the music and the emotion and he said within the first 15 seconds he had such a heart rate his all his emotions were we're moving you know there's a they show a love scene or they you know that they show somebody struggling I'm gonna fall all this intensity and drama and he said by the end of the 30 seconds he was almost feeling like he was going to sweat because of all the drama and he said how deceptive is Satan in 30 seconds of music and images he can make your heart and emotions be so moved to the point of happiness or crying or Lessie all over a filthy lie I thought my that's powerful Satan his words are smooth as oil his words are sweet as honey to the flesh alright right Church and all and you got to be careful to you and I maybe shouldn't watch trailers and movies either amen because we get so excited over 30 seconds and at the bottom of it all there is no bottom it's the bottomless pit it's a lie there never was a spider-man but there's a devil man right who creeps them out like a spider injected with this poison how smooth-talking is the devil to get people's emotions involved for 30 seconds and then and then think about we come to church and do we do we give God do we sing the songs where it really gets our motions involved into it we'll sing a 3-minute song and have you and I felt our emotions have we felt the meaning behind that song at the cross at the cross where I first saw the light do we feel that we ought to feel that because that's all in last 4 minutes we ought to feel that no I remember when I went to the cross the first time amen and now I'm walking the light I remember when that sin burden rode away and I wept and gave God praise I remember that and it was such a dramatic event oh I'm going to sing with all my heart but see people won't put their hearts into it they say they're Christians right they won't they won't feel it within they'll go watch 30 seconds of spider-man or Batman or Avengers and get all excited about a filthy live from the pits of hell oh how we must guard our hearts and the church said I thought you might like that that really blessed me last week I'm like my praise the Lord what a lesson that we must learn Satan's lies are smooth as oil sweet as a honeycomb but it's only for a season and it's a deceptive path and the steps go down to hell that's exactly right my verse 31 now I'm sorry verse 30 men do not despise the thief if he steal to satisfy his soul when he's hungry but if he be found he shall restore Sevenfold now that's verse 30 as sinners because you and I despise anybody who breaks the Word of God and the church said so that sinners all sinner all Christians despise anybody who sins not condemning them but they just hate sin verse 31 but if he be found he shall restore Sevenfold he should give all the substance of his house but whoso committeth adultery with the woman lacketh understanding and he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul look at that that's powerful if someone commits physical adultery they are destroying their own soul is it do you think it's important that Solomon's trying to get his son to understand this you think it's okay that he talks about this a third time or are we getting tired with him warning us we shouldn't get tired with it because this is a matter of soul life or so death this is a matter right because there's only two masters you can't serve God and the devil you'll serve one or the other and we've got to choose Christ if not we're destroying our own soul by living for the devil living for ourselves so Solomon repeatedly again and again keeps emphasizing this remember adulterers will not inherit the kingdom of God and brother Branham takes it a step further and shows the woman's responsibility he said a woman will be as pure as the lily physically but when she wears the high heels and wears pants and wears tight clothes and causes men to lusts he said show answer for that on the day of judgment and be just as guilty as a prostitute why because she has the spirit of a prostitute she doesn't have the discernment to know that my beauty can cause others to lust when I display myself out like that the Bible said present your bodies a living sacrifice for Christ in Romans 12:1 and Wool woman that presents herself like that with the tight clothes and all these things like that she's percent presenting herself as a harlot is that right and because she caused it and didn't repent and knew better I talked to women and they knew better when they were sinners they knew better they knew what they were doing when they put on those high heels they knew what they were doing when they put on the tight shirts amen they knew what they were doing when they put all that makeup on they're trying to get attention they're trying to get people to look at them and talk with them they know what they're doing because God placed that understanding in their conscience enough to answer for it and they've rejected the Holy Spirit so many times and say well it's okay I'm not I'm not committing the literal act I'm not committing the literal act and they don't even pick up their Bible and read Matthew chapter 5 verse 27 where Jesus says if a man looks on her and lusts after he's guilty and committed adultery already in his heart or if a preacher preaches that they'll walk right over and say well I never committed adultery and yet they've got that spirit of adultery on them that's right church they lacketh understanding destroying their own Souls give me 10 more minutes here by the grace of Lord I don't I don't to wear myself a hide the fever yesterday so I'm just trying to overcome the fever so pray for me I woke up with a fever on Tuesday morning and by God's grace I feel a little better but I'm still feeling a little tired help me Lord now verse 33 yeah we'll go to 33 35 yeah a wound and dishonor shall he get and his reproach shall not be wiped away see once somebody commits that act of adultery they are dishonored for their life right they are wounded for life men that cheat on their wives they wound their wives for life now the and we'll forgive and the men ought to repent all these things like that but there are wounds that last let me understand that the Bible said a broken spirit who can bear it's so hard to bear that think about even my heart how my parents divorced that broke that broke my spirit and that still hurts me to this day to see my parents walk away from each other and leave my dad or see my dad leave my mom with six kids all by herself that still hurts me to this day it just hurts me and I think how could that be done now of course I love my dad I forgive my dad all these things like that but it still leaves pain in our hearts it scars us but see a man that commits adultery the wound and dishonor the reproach shall not be wiped away the Bible says so see how amazing it is if somebody in the New Testament now can get forgiveness and then Jesus wipes all this in a way right amen like the church in Corinth where Paul said you're adulterers you're effeminate your lies your thieves and such were some of you and such were some of me but the blood of Jesus and the Spirit of God has washed away all of our sins amen Lori without the blood of Jesus that reproach cannot be wiped away but with the blood of Jesus we can have light garments pure and white hey man and that's the only thing that'll wipe it away is the blood of Jesus Christ look at verse 34 for jealousy is the rage of a man therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance that speaking of someone who's been committed adultery with somebody else's wife he will not regard any ransom neither will he rest content though thou give us many gifts so this is speaking of the reproach so when someone commits adultery not only have they hurt their spouse but the other person's spouse they destroy their own soul all right let's go I got about five more minutes here some more minutes let's just hit a couple more oh I don't know if I can get to that one here thank you sir I appreciate that well yeah let's just go to Chapter seven then okay I just have to go quickly here because again he gives a fourth warning about the evil women a fourth warning and then he keeps going so Chapter seven has broke up there's a warning of a woman and then there's a break and then there's a warning of women at the end so again this must be a really important thing and how many parents feel burdened for your children to marry the right spouse I got six kids I got seven on the way and we pray all the time God prepare their husbands and wives for them may they make the right choice amen is that they don't take this seriously if they don't take it prayerfully they can destroy their own Souls brother Bram said you can ruin your entire life on the earth now we just read through that earlier remember decades of pain and decades have heard all these things to make the wrong decision I think it was one time it's okay honey if I say this story I think the girls one time were we're saying like Daddy I want to marry you did the girls say that one time but but you said you can't they can't marry daddy but they need to find a man who lives like daddy is that right we talked about that you know when they're young they don't know I thought so my girls say daddy could I marry you when I grew up I think that has a blessing you know like praise the Lord they think I'm a good man I'm living for Jesus amen but that's what we wanted to be we want them to remember that they shouldn't even take a man seriously unless he asked like unless he acts like their daddy Merrick I don't take a woman serious unless she acts like your mama dad I'm going to have these conversations yet with him they're really not teenagers except Lydia so I'm kind of getting an early start on my my father-son talk I'll say like that although we've talked about you know important things but what I'm saying is that this is so critical the Holy Spirit keeps coming again and again and again humming to be the word of God's inspired the Holy Spirit one of this repeated a fourth time be careful of strange women be careful of a strange man you think God was wasting his time with Chapter seven absolutely not God knew we needed Chapter seven just like we needed Chapter six amen giving us more wisdom more understanding of the ways of God let's not take it lightly Church for times sake let me just go through no yeah let's just maybe I'll just read the whole chapter here all right my son look look at this again my son keep my words and lay up my Commandments with thee keep my Commandments and live and my laws as an apple of thine I bind them upon thy fingers write them upon the table of thine heart amen santé wisdom thou art my sister and call understanding thy kinswoman that they may keep thee from the what strange woman what is going to keep Malachi and Elijah from a strange woman the Word of God if they let it be written on their hearts what kept John and I from a strange woman or brother Adam what kept us with wrong woman the gracious and loving word of God hallelujah that's it that's the only weapon we got is the Word of God amen didn't say give him a self-help or self-help book on marriage you didn't say that didn't say give them a you know a suit of clothes a certain suit of clothes to protect them or a gun or machine gun ar-15 he didn't say that don't give him a gun to protect them give them something greater than that the sharp double-edged sword of the eternal Word of God amen that will keep them from a strange woman give them the Word of God oh we should be so grateful for the word of the Lord all right finish let's go to verse 6 for anti window of my house I looked through a case now this is striking look at this story so Solomon one day was looking out of his window you guys ever look out your window he's looking out of his window at the in Jerusalem there and he looks out the window and he sees a young man walking on the streets and he writes down what he saw on the streets let's see what he saw he actually witnessed this one day in Jerusalem the City of God passing through the street near a corner I'm sorry two verse seven and behold among the simple ones I discerned among the use a young man void of understanding so now kind of lied you you don't want to be this guy this guy lacked understand he didn't understand what he was doing passing through the street near her corner there's that strange woman and he went the way to her house in the Twilight in the evening in the black and dark night so men should you be a young boy should you be out by all yourself out at night around corners where there's prostitutes don't hang around sinners this is what Solomon saw and behold there met with the woman with the attire so she's dressed like a and a sub to of heart she's loud and stubborn her feet abide not in her house the Bible said the godly woman guides the house but this prostitute was not in her house she's out there on the corner she's loud and stubborn at night waiting for men to get all by themselves so she can snatch them up and Solomon saw this take place one night now she is with now in the streets and lieth in wait in every corner so she caught him and kissed him and with the impudent face said unto him I have peace offerings with me this day I'd paid my vows look how religious she is she said I just went to church this is all ordained of God see I'm keeping the Word of God I made a promise to God I've kept the Word of God she's pretend to be religious Oh God sent you here to meet me right here this is ordained of God what a life from the pit of hell how do you know brother just because she's got a husband who's on a trip amen he took all the money and he's gonna be back on a certain day she's breaking the Word of God no matter how religious they are if they break the Word of God cast it down therefore came out for it to meet thee diligently to seek thy face and I have found the oh you're somebody special I was looking for you look at verse 16 I've decked my bed with coverings of tapestry with carved works and with fine linen of Egypt I perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon come let us take our fill of love into the morning let us Solace ourselves with love so Solomon saw this this woman's real loud she's talking so loud solomon can hear her talking all the way up in his palace he's just looking out the window oh my this harlots mixing in religion and all these things into her adulterous ways that's what's a noise does he always mix religion with sin religion with lust he always mixes it together verse 19 for the good man is not at home he's gone on a long journey oh you're not to worry about my husband he's gone he ain't gonna be back for a long time he had taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the day appointed with her much fare speech she caused him to yield with the flattering of her lips she forced him so she keeps going he keeps working it until he finally gives in after her straightway as an ox go to the slaughter or as a fool to the correction of the stocks till the dart strike through his liver as a bird haisa to the snare knoweth not that it is for his life hearken unto me now therefore o ye children and attend to the words of our mouth lowers listen to me there are people that are anointed with the devil out there that are trying to hunt your soul Satan is as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour and Satan's doing that through other people who are anointed with his spirit but children he says my son children listen to me let not thine heart decline to her ways don't lower yourself to her standards keep yourself on the standards of God go not astray in her pass for she has cast down many wounded yay many strong men have been slain by her her house is the way to hell going down to the chambers of death let's say into our feet by God's grace Oh true is the word of the Lord it's so true Psalm was so concerned about this this evil relationship a fourth time he visits this and he says now I've got an eyewitness testimony I've seen it of a young man who's off by himself out at night in the wrong place he thought he was strong enough to withstand her but pretty soon he fell she caused him to yield and fall see the wisdom of God would tell us first of all don't go out alone at the wrong time right the second thing would tell us don't even stop for a second to listen to the lie of the devil that right Church the the problem was he stopped to listen and we can't even stop and listen not even one time we must stay true to the word of the Lord now with this message how many want to remain faithful to the Word of God to our brothers that are married how many want to remain true to your well praise the Lord or young people want to remain true and stay pure for the word of God's sake our young people should win a bind the law of their mother and the instruction of their father around their necks and never forget what their parents taught them let's pray for that tonight let's pray for all of us that our relationships will be strong whether we're married or whether we're single we would not enter into the wrong relationship let's pray for our children that they will hear the voices of their parents all the day long hey man in church I remember when I was in high school I was I was in a really bad compromising situation an awful situation and I was about to do something very evil but then the voice of my youth youth pastor woman there was a woman pastor this shows how important it is to have voices that are telling you the truth even though she was out of position but I heard the voice of my youth woman pastor in my ear and it kept me from breaking God's Word and I can say praise the Lord for that was she out of position of course but was she trying to get me to hear the voice of God yes and like the Bible said if you hear and have an open heart to the instruction of your parents or the preachers that voice will keep talking to you all day amen what voice is that the voice of the Holy Spirit amen father to us bow our heads and have a word of Prayer Malachi you come to the piano
