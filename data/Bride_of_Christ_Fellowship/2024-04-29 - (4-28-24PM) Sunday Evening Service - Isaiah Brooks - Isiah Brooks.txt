========================================

I enjoyed it and I appreciate you he must have really have to push you a little bit but you got up there didn't you we appreciate it amen sometimes God has to push but once once we get there we feel better amen so we thank the Lord and we thank the Lord for his grace and his mercy and uh all that God is doing for us uh we're not going to be long tonight we'll do our best to uh give you the very thought the which God has given to us and um and um and then then we'll uh Journey on by the grace of the Lord I love the Lord I love worshiping him that song Always tear me up I I always think how without the blood of Jesus Christ I'm just a mess and uh I'm I'm the first to confess to that because I know where I came from what I used to be and what I am now and I can see where God has brought me and where he's taken me and I can truly say I'm not the man I used to be and I've seen changes in my life year by year and uh you know so that's what that's what keeps me going is not because I know so much more it's because I see the changes how God is changing Me From the Inside Out amen Genesis 3 please Genesis the 3r chapter 9 through the 13th verse how often I tried to change myself and uh when you try to change yourself you're in for a great disappointment but when you ask God to change you you put it in his hands and he's obligated to change you often times God want to hear that you want to be changed because there are so many people you know they really don't want to be changed but if you really are a Christian you get sick and tired of being sick and tired you get tired of your feeling and you get tired of all your thoughts and you know uh even your thoughts get on your nerves when they're not like the way the word the word want them to be you know so any anyhow Genesis 3:9 through3 and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I command thee that thou should not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord said unto the woman what is this that thou Hast done and the woman said the serpent beg God me and I did eat amen jump down to the 21st verse unto Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe with them and the Lord said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now let us let he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to tear the ground from whence he was taken let us pray father God we come before you Lord as humbly as we know how and we thank you for your grace your mercy and the reading of your word we pray father God that you bless the word bless it here today today as we approach your throne you're the only one that could break the bread and father we pray that you break the bread of life Lord fit something into our hearts that will never forget fit something in our heart that would change us fit something in our heart that would bring us closer to you most of all we ask that you give Grant to us a love that we may love you more than ourselves bless us now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated uh uh my subject this morning or tonight is the proof the proof of of of perfect love I I I believe that uh when God uh began to work here in the Garden of Eden he began to show us something even by himself you see God always desire his his will is for us to forgive each other uh if you if you take note to the scripture in which I read Adam and Eve had sinned against God and God had already told them that the day that you eat of this tree you should surely die but in the midst of all of this God provided a sacrifice and that was a lamb that was to show them that they were forgiven and even though they had transgressed God was the first to forgive because in reality they were supposed to die uh both physically and spiritually but God allowed them to live and to carry on and I just believe that when we get to heaven we'll meet them and the reason being how do I know God forgave them because God took a lamb as I said this morning and the lamb had to be a perfect lamb so the lamb became a substitute for Adam you understand me so that that lamb that repr represented the righteousness of God Amen was accepted as the substitute for Adam and Eve's sin love is displayed like that see God is love and God God uh he knows how to hate you understand that but God did not hate Adam and Eve because they were made in his very image and likeness they were actually a part of God Amen in so much that God made them uh little gods or amateur Gods Over the Garden of Eden and it's amazing that that Adam Not only was the god of of the land but he also was the god of the sea he was the god of God's creation and we know that everything had to obey him so we look at these things and we understand that uh forgiveness uh is displayed uh is one of the great attributes of divine love or perfect or perfection amen and what what what God did uh he also showed in the garden here that uh Adam and Eve once sinning against God uh was no longer friends of God they were actually had become enemy they had joined the enemy side when they listen to the devil and that's what we do but God has has a a plan for us amen and everybody that really is disobedient to the word and knows the word and and just will willfully become disobedient to the word becomes an enemy of the word so we realize by the grace of God here it was God Amen is uh forgiving Adam and Eve and and he did this so that we will know amen that God's will is to forgive right I mean you know we'll jump there in just a minute uh it is the doorway uh to Perfection uh forgiveness you know God uh wants everyone to forgive and and as I said he started uh with the Lord himself forgiving Adam and Eve now the thing that I love about this is that not only did God forgive Adam and Eve but he provided a way uh for them because he knew now that they have become like like Gods knowing good and evil that that one sin would just be the beginning of their downfall the Bible doesn't record how many times Adam and Eve sinned since after they fell but we know by God's grace that the very nature of God that once protected them was no longer there uh the the the very uh how can I say it the um the very cloth of the very uh clothes of Adam and Eve uh was taken back from them and and given back back to God Amen and that was God's protection that's why they didn't know they were naked Hallelujah because God protected them from those kind of a things now we look at this thing and we we think uh not much of it we we say well well God why did God in the law had the eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth because he wanted the law he wanted the that that that Foundation a strong Foundation to show you that really that's not the way God thinks in other words that's not his perfect will his perfect will is to forgive you to forgive your enemy but we find out that of course when it came to the Jewish people and they they look at them now uh when when there could be some forgiving and and some mercy somewhere they're still under the umbrella of ey for an eye and a two for tooth and this is why people can't understand the Jewish uh people today because they're not living under the Gentiles laws they're living under the law of God and if you do evil to me I'm going to do evil to you see this is what stumbled even the Jews when Jesus Christ came in his day who was the grace and mercy of God and he said forgive those that spitefully use you oh they couldn't understand that because they always have been taught an eye for an eye and when he when he said pray for those who speak evil of you and and and all of these things that were contrary to the very law in which they were taught you got to understand that this thing was so traditional traditionally ingrained in them till it basically became part of their DNA they really didn't know how to forgive they didn't know how to pray right and think about it even when Jesus was asked the questions Lord teach us how to pray and when he said forgive those amen who trustpass against you forgiveness that was was uh wasn't even in their vocabulary as such because in the law if if somebody even killed a relative uh they had the right to go find him and kill him and God had to establish what we call a City of Refuge where they could run and hide right because it was so ingrained that they would take years to wait on that person to avenge them of their relative it was in them and it's still in them today but the Bride of Jesus Christ she is the grace of God she is the mercy of God yall understand me she is the woman caught in adultery the LA wanted to Stone her but Grace and Truth says where is your accuser you see that's the kind of love and forgiveness God wants us to have it wasn't that she wasn't guilty but she was and and Jesus said listen where's your cons accusers in other words there's nobody to charge sin against you neither will I well that was so contrary to the law well of course you know nobody could keep the law you it was always partial and political and they brought the woman and left out the man when according to the law they both should have been brought there and they both should have been stoned see and that's how people even in that day was able to manipulate the law right oh yes even the Pharisees and the Sadducees they manipulated the law because even when Jesus healed on the on the day of the Sabbath they said it was unlawful they wanted to Stone him and Jesus corrected them said but you the one who's a hypocrite because if your mule or your donkey or whatever would fall in the ditch you would go get him out but here's a woman amen a daughter of Abraham that needs help and healing on that day and you won't serve Mercy to her Hallelujah he had to come he was the very essence of forgiveness he had to show them what Grace was right and he was perfect he did everything the father told him to do there was nothing he came short in y'all understand what I'm saying and the reason being because he had to cover your failure he had to cover my failure he's my perfection he's my perfect Grace he's my perfect forgiveness Hallelujah is that right remember when Jesus died on the cross he didn't forgive some he forgave all the whole world was saved by the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah even to this day the whole world is still saved by the blood of Jesus Christ the only reason why people are lost is because they will not accept their atonement Hallelujah y'all understand what I'm saying his mercy and Grace is still here until the blood is taken from The Mercy Seat Hallelujah Matthew 1823 2035 I'll keep going with this in just a moment because I believe that it steps it steps and then when you come to brotherly kindness and just before perfect love because you see in between there is always a brother is always a sister somebody is going to offend you somebody is going to do harmful y'all understand what I'm trying to say before you reach that level where Christ reached that level right somewhere right in there there must be something or someone you must forgive yes I try to prove it in just a moment see sometime people people think you you don't have to forgive you've got to forgive and if you are a True Believer you want to forgive but let me tell you something forgiveness is not always easy you need God to help you but listen I can tell you what when you say oh I don't forgave this person or I forgave that person as long as you feel these funny feelings it's not true the devil has lied to you you still got a problem that needs to be resolved yall understand me until you can see the person that you say you you forgiven and yet you have a problem in your feelings you have not forgiven there's still a little ounce of something there and most of that can only come by way of prayer you said brother what's what you talking about I know what I'm talking about I was offended and it took three and a half years or even more to forgive but I said it with my mouth Yes and I meant it with my mouth but the heart is deceitful you understand me but every time somebody would bring that brother's name up I feel that thing and when somebody would like that brother I'm like wait a minute I'm just being honest I'm just being honest but I would go to God In Prayer Lord deliver me deliver me it wasn't deliver the brother deliver me and that that that that prayer I kept praying it you know people would I mean it would just catch me off God brother you think you done forgot about it and somebody said well you know so and so and so and I think boom here's that feeling all over again and that's when I knew I need to get before God I had done all the confessing confessed to the brother even even allowed myself to be defrauded when I knew I was right I confessed to be wrong you understand me I did all of that to bring peace but it never would move y understand understand me but one day it disappeared you hear what I'm saying I don't know when it left me but it left me and I know to this day I would do anything for that brother if in need without even thinking about it y'all hear what I'm saying only God could move that out of my heart certain wounds are hurtful and they're deep and only God can move it but you cannot stop until God moves it you understand me you can't stop praying until God moves it now that's the human side of us but we know what's right we know what's right listen therefore is the kingdom of heaven like unto a certain King which would take account of his servants and when he had begun listen people said well you know when somebody do you wrong said don't you worry about it y'all know how we do it you reap what you Soul wrong attitude you know what your attitude supposed to be Lord have mercy and when he had begun to reckon one was bought unto him which owed him 10,000 talents but as far for us let me let me I I just remember to say this you know one time I I had held this thing and it was against it was my my my one of my best friends in South Carolina I had the story all twisted for years when we were boys he came to my house with a gun and I thought he was upset with me I'm like and he's at my screen though come on out come on out I he's upset but I'm thinking he's upset at me when he was upset at someone else but he wanted me to come out so I could join with him to go fight somebody and I was thinking he' come to my house to kill me so I wouldn't go out to to and for years for years cuz we calm down you know and everything and so happened you know I even told his mama about that incident we were just that close like brothers but that thing always bothered me how could he get me my you know my best friend gets so angry at me he'd bring a gun to my house well it was just over a year or two ago he and I we were discussing and said what what you talking about bro he said I didn't bring that gun to the house to he you I he said these two guys jumped me and I needed you to help me go get them y understand what I'm saying so misunderstood but I held that thing like a trophy it was just that real and I had to confess to him bro I tell you what I I had it all messed up up we laughed about it then but it wasn't funny to me all those years all no matter how close we got how many things we did together I always thought about him bringing that gun to my house but that's the way the devil works you know it work he works that way anytime we can get the wrong information and get it all twisted up and and he can cause something to harden our heart about something he'll do it Hallelujah you understand me but listen the thing that that that something happened even in my family not long ago and I it wasn't toward me but one of my daughters wrote in the text that maturity a person who is mature is has the ability to confront the situation in a mature way you don't run from it you confront it Hallelujah let's move on but as far as he had not to pay now I'm inan what did I have you turn there Matthew 18 23-35 but as much as he had not to pay his Lord commanded him to be sold and his wife and his children and all that he had and payment to be made the servant therefore fell down and worship him saying Lord have mercy with me and I will pay thee all that's you that's me then the Lord of that servant was moved with compassion and loose him and forgave him the debt is that what we did God we've been a sinner we've done all these wicked things I need you to save me my debt is who can pay it forgive me Lord I've done evil and God's mercy have mercy on us he comes and forgive us of our debt he literally set us free yet we want to hold debt over somebody else you owe me a confession you owe me to make this right and you know what we tell everybody else but the person just so you know Hallelujah but that's not the will of God hallelujah y'all know it's the truth oh my goodness but the same servant went out and found one of his fellow servants which ow him a 100 Pence and he laid hands on him took him by the throat saying pay me that thou owest you can almost visualize it and his fellow servants fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and I will pay thee sometime people make mistakes they don't mean to do it Hallelujah you know I had to tell a person I said you know in my P life and I can be moody still today but moodiness is not of God so anyway I had to tell them I forgive me because sometimes these mood swings gets on me you know what I mean you should have seen me a few years earlier you know but but I'm better now than I used to be right so anyhow uh you you you you you you you want to charge people every time I think about how much God has has forgiven me how can I for not forgive others and his fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patience with me and I will pay thee all you know y'all don't maybe some of you do but when you have come through a rough life and even as a young person people have done wor wicked things to you I remember the time when my brother and his friend join up together to beat me it was devastating to My Little Life y your brother joining forces with someone else to beat you up will I held that for a long time y'all don't understand me do you I held it I didn't understand it but you know what I had to forgive my brother I thought in my mind there's no way he could ever love me do and I'm talking about I'm in like the maybe the third fourth grade y'all understand me trauma and those things are hard to get rid of and only God can do it but in order to make Heaven you got to give it up Sir you got to forget about what happened to you you know oh this because this happened in my life I'm this way forget it it give it up cast your cares upon Jesus why because that kind of thing will deform you you have been transformed let it Transform You by the renewing of your mind let God wash away the heart and all the history I don't know who I'm talking to but I just hope somebody's being blessed we we are you you know I I've got so many things I could tell you and when I tell you let me say it like this when I came to Jesus Christ I was totally a mess and when I say rejected by my father you know the the the if it kind of said like this the black sheep of my family that kind of a thing and then when I Found Jesus you know that the church became a family y'all understand what I'm trying to say and then you find out in the church you'll have people to hurt you there too you can't get away from the pain you are the scars like the brother say in the song but it gives you wisdom it matures you Hallelujah is that right why because you want to in your heart you don't want nobody else to feel the kind of pain you felt when those things happen to you it is there so that if you meet somebody who's going through some of the same things or similar things in in their lives and they need to overcome then you can share it woo somebody now it's hard to share nowadays cuz people don't know how to keep things to themselves but there used to be a time you could talk to a Christian and they would hold that thing it would bring you closer together now you tell somebody Susie and Susie got a best friend she tells her best friend so amen it becomes a real bad situation right so what we do we hold it but you know it's it's against the word because the Bible said confess your faults one toward another we supposed to have love enough to share with one another some of our deepest hurts somebody can pray with you help you overcome only love can do this now I'm not talking about practic in is and I'm not talking about systematically doing it I'm talking about there must be somebody you know loves you so when Fellowship saw that what was done they were very sorry and I got to hurry up and came and told unto their lord all that was done in other words your attitude and your treatment toward your brothers and sisters is reported unto God and God it doesn't make him feel good about it because he's know how many times you come to him saying Lord have mercy he knows all the times that you know you were wrong and you did it anyway he's not talking about just sin he's talking about our iniquity And yet when somebody offends you or somebody across you you just want to hold it in your heart and bring it up like somebody you know regurgitating you know that's crazy you got you got only the pure in heart shall see God there is no way to escape that only the pure and heart shall see God and when your brothers and sisters make mistakes you supposed to make excuses for them did you know that brother Bram said you're supposed to make excuses for them you know they didn't mean to do that why because we don't wrestle against flesh and blood spiritual wickedness in high places and the best way of having a brother and sister to delivered is you pray for themen Hallelujah not talk about them and then pray pray for them Hallelujah then his Lord after that he had called him said unto him listen how God phrases this he said oh thou Wicked servant he calls you Wicked because you don't have the ability you won't you won't forgive he calls you Wicked yes sir sir I forgave thee all thy debt because thou desired me should not thou also have compassion on thy fellow servant even as I've had pity on thee and his Lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him what are the tormenters we don't know it could be a sickness cuz your body is not built to not forgive that's any kind of ailment torment you until you come to your senses to forgive till you should pay all that was due unto him and so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if you forgive if you if ye from your heart forgive not everyone his brother need their trespasses right in other words God said I won't forgive you either listen people a lot of so-called Christians ready to cross over the line and all of a sudden they think about all of the people they've never forgiven where do you think they're going because if they don't forgive you can't cross the line and go up you you don't forgive them God can't forgive you Hallelujah is that all right acts 7:59 acts 7th chapter 59 verse 60 and they stoned Stephen calling upon God saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit see I I I we're talking about okay we we said God don't you know he's looking at the lamb but listen people because he's our righteousness doesn't mean that we shouldn't live righteously we supposed to live righteously he's our Holiness we supposed to live holy Listen People of God you can forgive one of the greatest enemies of of the of of of the of the word is first of all the king demon unbelief the second one is stubbornness some people know to do right but just don't don't want to do it you know why they got pride pride is just before the fall I was thinking about that I thought today and I I was just thinking when God called because I'm in Jeremiah and God call him stiff neck you know what stiff neck is you think I'm going to apologize stiff that neck up puff out that chest God said I hate that look Hallelujah and they stoned stepen calling upon God and saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit here's enough if if he confess to me then I confess to him wrong the Bible says if you think your brother has an ought against you you go to him y'all where all the amens and he kneel down and cried without a l listen let me tell y'all something something this has to God preached this to me before I can preach it to you I must be first partake of the fruit God comes to me first yes sir you see I can't preach this you like I was telling a brother a minister who don't pay his tithing I said how can you preach on tithing if you don't pay your tithing I said you're a hypocrite yes sir right I said you can't preach on tithing and you're not preach you're not paying them yourself and he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice Lord lay not this sin to their charge and when he had said this he fell asleep I had a sister uh uh uh I won't I won't call her name uh she had come to me and uh uh I I put it away the Lord told me that you know she would she was soon to die that the time on Earth was almost over and I went and um I talked to her about it and she didn't say anything at that time but uh about a month or two before she passed and nothing was wrong with my sister uh I the Lord told me go and tell her her time is shorter now then before and I said Lord if you show me where she's at I go tell her and the Lord showed me put in my heart where she was I went there she was there I called her out of the house that she was in we sat in a little swing area I told her what the Lord had said to me and she said to me I can't forgive and I didn't know what she was talking about but in her younger days she had been ravished uh by a man and she didn't know how to forgive him and I told her I says listen uh which explained to me her whole entire life and and this is this is really a sincere thing I'm telling you and she said uh I said to her I said listen we cannot forgive like God God can forgive and forget but we're built in a different way I said we'll never forget it I said but you can G you can you can forgive so much to if that person needed you you could help them without thinking about it immediately she said I forgive two months later she died and I had forgotten that she had once been a Christian and before she came before she died in sin God called her back God delivered her from cigarettes and everything she told me I I I I saw her even though it crushed my heart when the Lord took her I I I I I almost lost my mind but at the same time I knew God was rich in Mercy and she forgave and and and immediately she she didn't have the nervousness that she had she didn't have to smoke or anything see all of that stem from that point from that thing that happened to her when she was young top in her class you know she was at a time going to a Catholic School topping her class going to church made herself a Christian and when that happened she fell in all the years of her life she carried that thing yall understand me but God was rich in Mercy y'all understand me God is rich in Mercy now what is he telling you whatever is in your life forgive it was the devil it's not flesh and blood Satan knows who you are he's trying to stop the seed of God from coming to his Perfection that's his whole purpose you so brother Brook I don't know about that let me tell you something brother brother bam said Mary Magdalene became the person that she was because her mother and father put her out and made her go work for her life a living you think God wasn't aware but she was seed you understand me she was seed and God never called her nothing but a daughter he forgave her the record was clean he whom the son is set free is free indeed and it's as long as you got that root there is always a possibility of a tree to grow listen Mark 32829 said verily I say unto you all sins shall be forgiven Unto the Sons of men and blasphemy without soever with blasphemy wherewith soever they shall blaspheme but see even people blashe blaspheme against God but they don't blashe the Holy Ghost but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost have never forgiveness but is in danger of Eternal damnation and even God said if you hear a man blaspheming the Holy Ghost don't pray for him anymore that's the only thing every other sin is forgivable and therefore we are expected to forgive yes sir H I know it's tough but it's true do you want a pure heart do you want to be able to love your your not only your loved ones but also your enemies amen Amen brother love them and I'm not talking about feeling like you do but loving them man Jesus did it he knew Judas was a devil and yet he loved him the Bible said he did yes sir you say well I was just filio love well do you love them filiol that's a new word but nevertheless I'm asking the question right cuz even if you loved them in that filio love you you've achieved something Hallelujah love the Lord Genesis 28 I got to hurry coming on through Genesis 20 38 excuse me 18 through through 25 and he said what pledge shall I give thee and he said thy signant and thy bracelet and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it her and came in unto her and she conceived by him and she arose and went away and laid by her her veil from her and put on a garment of her widowhood and Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend to the adullamite to receive his pledge from the woman hand but he found her not then he asked of men of that place saying where is the Harlot that was openly by the wayside and and they said there was no harlot in this place and he returned to Judah and and said I cannot find her and also that the men of the place said that's there was no harot in this place and Judah said let her take it to herself let we be ashamed behold I sent this kid and thou has not found her and it came to pass about three months ago after that it was told Judah saying Tamar thy daughter-in-law have played the hollot and also behold she is with child by hom and Judah said bring her forth and let her be burnt and when she was brought forth she sent to her her father-in-law saying by the man whose whose these are am I with child child and she said discern I pray thee who are thee these the signant the bracelet and the staff now now I I do admire Tamar and the reason why I say that because Judah did her so unfairly he really treated her bad and yet she forgave him enough and she wanted God so much that she was willing to play a harlot to continue his seed line Y yall understand me her her ambition was not even for her her am ambition was for the line of Judah to continue and by that Judah himself never said oh I'm sorry you know how you know you you you big you know so now you're going to say well you're rightous business is better than mine that was his way of saying I'm sorry right and God so watered her that he gave her twins and then the lineage of Jesus comes out of her so forgiveness just being able you have no idea why God set traps for you and set things in your way but you must overcome them in your soul how can you be joyous in your soul if you still got that little bit of Darkness there it's going to always come up and torment you I'm telling you from experience is that right I don't have much longer Jacob and Esau I'm just giving examples now years of hatred and Esau was going to kill Jacob you stole my birth right you know how even so jealous brothers and sisters that thing could be ugly at times it can develop into hatred right especially if Mom or daddy like the younger or more than like the Elder however you want to say it but it happens in life it happens in the church people have favorites people get jealous of it right you got people who want to you know how how could I say it play the piano and they know they can't it it's crazy it really is but if you look beyond that that is the effect of something else happening down here the cause and the effect amen hallelujah remember when brother brownon went into the bar and he found this man who was a well used to be a I think he was a lawyer something like that and he had become an alcoholic only because his his wife left him for someone else but listen God found him you understand me God found him what about the woman a man who had the purple hair and the purple nails and purple everything thought she was lost and couldn't be redeemed huh hurtful things happen in her life God found her redeemed her saved her Sanctified her y'all understand me cuz she was a daughter of God he was a Son of God listen you can sit back all you want so well I don't have to forgive no you do not if that's going to make you comfortable and happy don't but at the end of the road you will have the pay for that you will have to give answer to God on why you did not forgive when he's forgiven you all your sinsu I love that song brother you know all of the millions of blessings and I don't deserve not even one anybody in here has been blessed and you feel like you deserve it no amen because God's mercy and Grace is with us we need to start sharing that with one another this is what a church is all about you can we can unite in such a way the devil won't have space a crack to get in amen hallelujah is that right so I'm almost done Jacob and Esau and and we we we we see in the uh the 33rd chapter of of of Genesis Jacob lifts up his eyes and look and behold Esau how many times we've seen that happen right we've got a problem with a brother or sister and we might be a at a meeting and all of a sudden boom they're there now you just finished shouting and they just popped up on you and you think oh Lord and the Holy Ghost say to you you better get it right you better get it right oh Lord I'll do it later you know how many of y'all have done that come on somebody am I the only one who can raise their hand I'mma raise my hand for me and you we do it we put put it off we put it off we put it off but finally God gets a hold of you and you say I can't go no longer with this I got to make it right and then when you get it make it right the people oh I didn't think nothing about it oh when you what you I didn't even pay that no attention but in your heart in your mind this thing is a big thing see see it's the devil that makes it like that now here come Jacob I love Jacob I love him that's why God say Jacob lift up up his ey he didn't say Israel lifted it up his name had been changing though but Jacob was the one that made met Esau even though his even though his name had been changed excuse me even God basically saying you acting like Jacob now you ain't acting like Israel so anyway he meets Esau and I still can't understand these men there's something things about Abraham I don't understand how he suffered his wife to be another man's and how Jacob you know they followed the same pattern you it moves on moves on and and now Jacob saying I tell you what I'm coming but y'all go before me he was willing for all of them to be wiped out he was hoping for the mercy and grace of God but you understand now under the law it was a eye for eye they they are in their heart they didn't they didn't know nothing about forgiveness y'all we we we we look at all of these things and and we know even even so when it comes to the law and all of these things that that did happen during that time uh we we never see God teaching on Grace so the human mind is Vengeance you say that's not true yes it is because when Abel was killed Abel's blood cried out for vengeance and that was in the heart of every man even before the law was given Vengeance venge me of my adversary that's why the scripture said that the blood of Jesus Christ speaketh better things than able CU Abel spoke Vengeance and Jesus Christ spoke Lord forgive them for they know not what they do put all them in front right and I'm almost done and what happened God was working on both ends and whenever God works on both ends we ought to be grateful unto the Lord because if God is softening your heart he's also softening the other person's heart too because his will is for us to forgive and if God is working on one person's heart he's Al so working on the other one so that he they will all both understand each other Satan will be defeated cuz Esau said in the ninth verse and I'm closing he said I have enough my brother keep that that thou H has unto thyself and in other words Esau could have killed all of Jacob's children their cattle their everything because remember Esau said I'm going to kill you basically said I'm GNA get you and Jacob with the help of his mother ran over to his father-in-law and stayed there for 14 years that's a long time to hold a grudge and yet God was working on both blessing both and they come to an agreement and at the end of the story Jacob can now become Israel because he's forgiven his brother and his brother has forgiven him and in order for us to become what we call the Bride of Jesus Christ we got to have the spirit of forgiveness even as stepen had the spirit of forgiving forgiveness because I know myself if somebody's punching me in my face is going to take the Holy Ghost you can't do it on your own don't even don't even think it and I'm closing cuz remember I told you that one time you know I was jogging outside I was living in in Lia and and here come this big ferocious dog I don't know it was a rock W what it was it was a huge one and uh his master wasn't too far from him but wasn't close enough excuse me and I'm thinking to myself Lord I'm running I ain't I ain't running the opposite way yet but I'm running and that dog is getting closer and I'm thinking Lord remember when you calm that bull down remember what you did with the bees well that anointing never did come and I was so glad that man caught up with his big dog cuz I just felt like I was going to be eating alive that thing look so big and it was coming my way but then another time a different time down the road I'm running down the street from my house and this dog is on the other side of the street I see the dog break the chain he's coming my way and I'm running by a bush and I'm like I got to break this I'm gonna break this limb and the limb wouldn't break but the dog come just like that right like right there and stopped God is my witness he stopped and that's brother Brown said that boy look confused that dog looked confused and he turned around and there was another man on the other side of the street Crossing down by his house he turned and went over there and start barking at him and I continued running and I thought to myself Lord you're faithful you made me know it's not my will but your will whenever you determined this to happen that's when it happens so I witnessed that I'm a witness that God can can stop wild beast and that that dog was bad he he broke the chain I don't know whether it was because he saw me or what but I I just know that I was I was in a predicament that only God could help me out of and he did now that's my testimony but I just say by the grace of God people we need that when we when we say our prayer forgive us this day our daily bread give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our debts as we forgive th give our debors we need to REM we need to really mean that and we need to clean we need to get before God and says Lord what's in my heart if there be anybody that I have an all I haven't forgiven please help me Lord help me forgive and if I need cuz some things you may hold against a person and has ne ne has never necessarily said anything to them well then if that that's something that you have en envisioned in your mind but if you know that person no then that's you need to go to that person but if you don't know that you know what I'm trying to say some things you don't have to say cuz I I've learned that sometimes when you try to make things right if a person don't know about it it makes it worse cuz now you done gave them a battle they didn't have it's the truth so sometimes you just between you and God cleanse me oh Lord right I want to re I want to make this com I want to make this this this Perfection and I know that I can't have anything against my brother or my sister and that's what the Bible said love your neighbor even as You Love love yourself let's stand let's stand you know some people even hate God because of things that happen in their lives but we never understand some times it takes certain things to mold and make us into the person that God wants us to be regard regardless to how tragical or how bad it it seemed to be God ain't ignorant God ain't stupid and everything that does or happen to us a true SE to God God saw it before it happened and he looks at us to see okay do you still trust me do you still love me are you willing toat even forgive now y'all y'all don't y' y'all hear what I'm saying Jesus Christ death was not an accident it was planned by God God saw everybody that was going to spit on him he saw he saw the people that was going to slap his face matter of fact God when God made them he ordained them to slap it this wasn't some random person that ran up to slap Jesus those that cursed him God when they were born they were born to curse him just like the people who pierced him in the side and those that nailed him to the Cross all that scene you can put it drama act or whatever every one of those players was right on stage right on point to do exactly what they were ordained to do and yet Jesus said Lord forgive them for they know not what they do think about what I'm saying people these people that have done us wrong and done evil to us you know they many of them don't even know what they've done really and and they don't even know the depth of the things they've done but it's our D we're bride we must forgive and we should have a desire to forgive I I don't like the feeling of not of having a problem with anybody that's very uncomfortable and so in saying all I say if there be something that you need to straighten out with me I'm willing I I I have nothing to hide and God is know God God is my witness I love the people of God and I want to be free and I want to be see everybody else free yeah let's have a word of prayer our gracious father God we come before you we thank you thank you for your grace we thank you for your mercy we thank you for being so good to us Lord without you who are we we're nothing Lord you made us who we are all our test and trials everything that we've have ever gone through has not been a hiccup in your program but father you predestinated everything the good and the bad but you have confidence in us that we will come come through even as job when job friends his best of friends no doubt job took care of them at time helped them at time but when he fell into a spot of Affliction they became his accusers but job never hated him no it even got to the place Lord God you had job to go uh uh his friends to come back and ask job to pray and the only way job could have prayed for his friends is that he had to forgive them of all they had said to him all they had done to him otherwise the prayers would not have been effective but before job could reach that that that that uh that ground that place where you wanted him to be he had to face his accusers and he had to forgive them that not only that they might live but that he would live as well father we thank you for father for all of the things that we see in the word of God that brings us to the place that that is your will to forgive and it's our your will for us to forgive no matter what it may be bless us Lord keep us Lord guide us Lord help us now in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen hallelujah [Music] Mercy R my [Music] life Mercy roll my life I should have fallen my my
