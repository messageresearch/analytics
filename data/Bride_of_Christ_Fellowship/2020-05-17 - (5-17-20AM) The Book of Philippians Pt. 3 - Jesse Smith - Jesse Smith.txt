[Applause] [Music] [Music] we're standing in your presence we love you we left our voices let me receive in your eagerness a sweet smelling savor under the other that's why we live our live our lives are a living sacrifice your God so here a fresh nor we lay ourselves freshly as a living sacrifice upon your altar Marco upon your word we know Jesus Lord you taught that Lord is the altar or that purifies the sacrifice so Lord here we are we're purified in your presence by your word the washing of your word through the Holy Spirit father we love you we thank you Lord God we come to sacrifices now transform our minds that a sword passed underneath all that would exalt itself against the knowledge of God and transform us by the renewing of our minds today father and we might praise you and love you and worship you in this present world or God read it Lord Jesus as were established and present truth let us receive from your Holy Spirit today we thank you Lord for all your blessings bless His Word we're about to read if we get into our hearts in Jesus Christ let's take our Bibles here let's start with our scripture here we'll be down at Philippians chapter one memory verse let me in Shepherd 1 verse 7 here I got some grace 7 8 h.d how's everything with the sound this is okay thank you it means 1 7 8 9 I'll just read this myself here verse 7 8 9 these men that were you know keeping her in slave they could pay and then she would prophesy by demon power and I wasn't real prophesying his demons guess to me right but because they can figure out thing and they they could say what's going to happen to my mama then the woman with the demon powers could tell them I think my mi come to pass and they were making a lot of you the devil hastily expose a then we must you for once could be described by the unit and Paulette have access he would had to pay somebody and he would have to stand there I think it's beautiful you'd have to stand there and say write this and he'd get under the Holy Spirit you stand there and just let the Holy Spirit lead and my god what to say amen and so it's the Holy Spirit all would say Oh first you purchased and vilified so inaudible Oh God with joy outbreak just let the church continue let them get more so saved my let's some of this place going on on the outside right I got to dress the right way and make sure I grow my hair long I make sure thank God the barbers up and knock to get a haircut but a lot of times does message people that they initially come in but then they only let God work on the outside church the message has to change us from the ends you raise god your lies are the verification that Jesus Christ is still are they men you to fight for the truth I wonder who would defend it I wonder who would it be a coward and run away from all the arguments praise God who can I get to fight against evil spirits and doctrines of devils I wonder who could I'll get that kook knows you how about him I need somebody to defend and argue for the truth of the message I wonder who could do it churches should be all of us praise knock hey bading that remember I'm not saying argue with the evil spirit but all of I was that Paul would stand and he would proclaim in synagogues and he would he would explain the God Lord and try to tell him the truth you I bet myself I will tell you everything this is why I do this work but how about the Gospel race God you I got some problems but I'm going to go there I'm gonna have to answer any but I'm gonna do it real home last time we had a brother leave the church by oh I'm talking about them I really believe it I want everybody think I'm a good brother but I know they need to love that right Jose I love everybody think really good about me but I don't Satan is trying to rip our church now you get better we're supposed to get a humble grace guy we're supposed to seek God well what is the answer about that's why our peoples from what is the answer and so when it comes to you they say what do you think brother you'll have said this now verse 9 intent is such a beautiful prayer church so what was Paul praying he was praying for joy remember he was suffering with joy he would be so happy brain thank god there's those churches and philip i bless of bishops and then deacons thank you lord i want to see them so bad but then here he tells us more when he's Frankel let's see if he's praying them that God will make them millionaires let's see if God will give them every fleshly desire let's see if Paul's prank them to have meats and cheeses and good wines all praying for them since hit nods to people since his heart is in Jesus's heart we know that what Paul's prayer will be is the Heart of Jesus or then whatever proposed praying for that's what Jesus would have wanted them to have to because his heart was unified in Jesus's heart now I'm gonna pull some rope without of this app it's called a sword I don't walk the Greek because I didn't I didn't get this one Greek definition here helps me to understand it and I know YouTube as well by God's grace verse yeah verse 9 verse 9 and this I pray that your love may abound now what's the word about a mean church it means super about superfluous to be abundant to be enough and to have some spare leftover to be better to excel or exceed remain over and above so Paul prays that you have this superfluous overflowing what your baby gotta know that your love may about get more and more in the knowledge I'm sorry in knowledge and in all judgment what did Paul want you to have a what did Paul want your cup overflowing with you missed two things here he said through love so if you have a lot of love for Jesus you're overflowing these things so love of God produces it knowledge and all judgment oh you can't buy that at Walmart it's not available on Amazon you can read a book and get some good night that's it we've got to make sure that book lines up with this model what would a prophet pray for God give them you give them this and this and that he said God give them abounding overflowing love that we would see by growing in knowledge and in all judgment will knowledge of what what do we need to know more about church God's work praise God you ever find yourself like I'm reading through dirty Robby right now you ever find yourself it's like you forgot about this powerful scripture you could have used and like I could have used that like last week happens to me all the time I remember I preached at how did I forget that we're constantly learning new things but then we're also forgetting some of the knowledge so all silent you costly overflowing with knowledge searching we're not reading our Bibles more something's wrong with us because Paul said I don't want you having just a little trickle of Bible reading and knowledge he said I want you to have a overflowing Bible knowledge now at this point in my life I'm doing more Bible research I read my chapter every morning and night but then I'll do research and studying the Bible and passes and and writing about the scripture and that just keeps me meditating in God's Word so it's like all day long for three or four after nomina for three or four hours every day I'm just stuck in the scripture it's just constantly the Word of God and I like that phrase I can tell and I'm not gonna do it can you tell what you don't do it can you tell what it feels like your cuffs we're not overflowing your repiy you like that but Paul says this is my prayer that the Saints will be so filled with love that the knowledge will abound it'll superfluous it'll it'll flow out of them in knowledge and all judgment that's why I mentioned in the church of you years ago once are few more weeks ago if you don't have a Bible reading journal you probably need to get one if you're not meditating on God's Word and and learning more about the word that's not good now for me I don't have a journal I have a highlighter and markers and I just write all over my Bibles yeah do you want to see it I just go back and do that because if you're just doing a chapter to check it off your list that torito you really haven't fellowship with God are you really growing in knowledge with God and then while you're reading is something if the Lord put somebody on your heart pray for pray for you find a question sent me a text reads ssme need me I'd like to hear your questions we can do a question and answer service but Paul's prayer is that these Holy Ghost film message believers will have a bouncing knowledge so they can touch all things I try to reward it this morning as I'm Paul prays for their growth in love that knows and judges everything and it approves only things that are holy this maintains sincerity and blamelessness now with my family and with seven children I'm doing this all the time our nine children I'm trying to improve good YouTube videos or bad you too or disapprove bad YouTube videos that's right that's that's one area I can see end with music - constantly oh you heard this new song Oh check this out here's a link to a YouTube video and I found them the you know the more technology we get the more approving approving or disapproving we gotta do it's alright Church hey look guys it's making it late on Facebook at YouTube with all the thumbs up and thumb down those thumbs up and thumbs downs may be a witness against people on the day of judgment or witness for because Paul said you need to grow and be able to either prove something or disapprove that was his prayer not not that we should just say oh I don't know how to put on the show if we're saying we're putting it on the shelf every time our shelf is gonna break right there's only so much room on the shelf in Church of my life more and more has come off the shelf where God is giving me answers now do people to agree with me all done of course not but it makes sense to me God's gonna need a piece about like the trumpet's or the Feast of Trumpets or a marriage of divorce or whatever there are things that we're up on the shelf have now come down they're not on the Shelf anymore oh it's finished and that was post prayer so that we would know more and be able to judge the right things did you all know that you're all a bunch of judges did you know that you've got a gamble you've got a spiritual gamble you're all dressed in your judges robes today I can either gonna approve or disapprove of this sermon like several programs said you're either going to be a better Christian when you believe or not it's good that right usually an approve say Amen or rather think about something else I'd rather just go back to drifting along life's solemn main just drifting rather than happening the direction how many want to be directed to holiness praise God that was false prayer he said I want you to bow and just have more knowledge in the Word of God and more more judgment about what's good what's not what was the last time everybody read Philippians in the book anybody really lately you've been a long time since I read it's not really gonna join it anybody read lately good he's got nice review and this is what we stay we're resting on as a pastor I'm resting on you getting more knowledge and you're resting on me the same that's right we're resting on them aren't we I'm resting on you getting more knowledge about the word and also being able to judge things better at your home the songs you listen to the YouTube videos you watch or Facebook videos you watch I'm trusting that the pray you're throwing that and outgrowing that the many times for us will hear a song and the song has good lyrics make too much rock and roll lot right and that's where you guys don't listen to that version listen to a good gospel version of it praise God like there's different musicians I really enjoy but sometimes they just get to over in the rock'n'roll side and they gotta look it up our temperatures just hypocrite Church does a good job on music they'll take the same song that was the music was the wrong way and give it the right music and people are screaming shouting praises alrighty then hallelujah is the song the words a message of the solemn was more knowledge of but then the worldly Church the foolish person kind of perverted it with the rock-and-roll message right the style but then the real Church of God can bring it through and judge it right and bring the right message with the right style that's right and you know this is the time where we have so much time for YouTube and Facebook right you can't go I can't go to this you can't go to that there's not disclosed this is closed that's closed have you got closer to God through this time or further away well that walls prayer was that you get closer to God that was his that's what I've seen I just talked with a mentor brother man last week I was saying I've got nothing but blessings through this coronavirus time the only bad thing is that my briskets or because I'm doing all the schooling online and that mouse hurts my wrists I feel like sometimes getting carpal tunnel but I got to review that in Jesus name that's the only bad thing about this coronavirus so far because remember church it's just crow the virus is just a little bit worse than the flu the last number I saw was an eighty-five thousand Americans have died in the worst flu season in recent years has been 71 thousand Americans have died so it's it's bad it's just a little bit worse than the flu and you know then there's arguments that yo they're reporting flu deaths as coronavirus they're kind of putting all the deaths into the growing preference but who knows but this was Paul's prayer and this is what we're resting on so this is what we want to grow in and that's my church it doesn't matter to meet the church grows or not that doesn't matter but if the church isn't growing in knowledge and the church isn't growing in judgment and then there's something really problem then it doesn't matter if you grow physically it's is that the point is that you grow spiritually how many believe that it's all right because the Bible says in Acts chapter two million that the Lord added to the church such as would be saved I can't add to the church right you get out of the church the Lord has to add to the church and like Peter said with this tax for men add to your faith virtue so the spiritual part is up to you and I so if you could write somebody after 11 years what would you tell them what would your prayer be for that but you never seen them for 11 years I haven't seen Wendy for 2 months what would I write here's what pollard right after 11 over a decade is passed it's been a decade he said I pray that your cup will run over with knowledge about God's Word and you'll be able to judge even more things did you know even in education I'm a schoolteacher I learned in college the highest form of thinking there's many and there's factual thinking you know what the highest form is judgment it is the highest form of thinking is judging a topic anybody can squirt out the fact that the Emancipation Proclamation was in 1863 anybody can squirt that out but was it right and then defend it how do you know it was right judge it all right anybody anybody knows the first president was George Washington right but judge what kind of president what does joy okay now we're getting to some higher thank you now and so is Paul saying let your minds take a break just let anything into your mind that you want and it's okay doctor judge it was Paul saying that your mind lazy or make your mind more sharp what was he saying sure make your mind more sharp that you can judge everything that's trying to get into your home everything that's trying to get into your church I can tell you're enjoying this praise God y'all looking at me like a razor sharp like a razor praise God so that would be his prayer grow with knowledge so you're aware of what the scripture says and then grow in your ability to judge and he says if you do this no there's many times I can see you know you can see an are live student anyways life you can tell what people are really sincere serving God are not right and that's what Paul says if you are growing in knowledge about the word and you're judging things you will stay sincere before God that's what he says verse 9 I'm sorry I'm sorry verse 10 that ye may approve or test right approve things that are excellent that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ so if you are constantly growing in the word and loving more about sermons and loving reading your Bible right now I'm living researching I can find quotes here I can find scriptures there I'll just love it I feel like I'm growing all the time I can't we can preach it to you too I that's good I'm really enjoying it if you're not feeling like that that you lose your sincerity and then you start doing things that you're guilty of and you should be blamed for it right is it if it's the opposite if it's the opposite you'll be blameless and sincere so the effects of not judging everything and growing in knowledge you become insincere and you deserve to be blamed so this is a Prophet's prayer what about brother man would pray for me wonder what holiday for me right here then you will grow in your knowledge of God's Word and then you'll be able to judge even more things this is right this is wrong that's right that's wrong and you will remain sincere if you're growing in your knowledge and then your judgment now just we'll get to this event but right now I'm writing on this in the book there's going to be a section on in the next clip by God's grace he polishes knowledge and then discernment now in this case Paul's not talking about the gifts of the Holy Spirit but every Christian should have some form of wisdom knowledge faith now not everybody has divine healing gifts not everybody works miracles Paul said it remember not everybody prophesize but everybody should have on some level of judgment because he says all of you need to grow in judgment so see some of these spiritual attributes everybody will have if they're born again right not everybody will speak with tongues now that everybody will interpret tongues now we know that today right he's not many people speak with tongues today right not everybody knows miracles but everybody's for sure has gifts now but everybody has for sure a portion of wisdom knowledge faith and discernment in your character and Paul says invest in it grow in it don't get lazy with it right don't get lazy no don't fall away from it grow in it don't wither away from God's presence draw to it praise now let's feed you praise the Lord grow in God's grace and now to the Lord let me spend time here I'll give me 10 minutes up close here see look at how it goes like that how does our six minutes already can you buddy then no I can't believe it now the next word this servant is to grow it in all judgment so this is a discernment now see church we're growing in discernment but we do not judge the destinies of people's souls that's where we get name-caller right that's where we get bitterness that's where you get church splits right that's ready to get arguments with preachers all the time Paul of course is emphasizing the Holy Spirit and I didn't mean to that that's actually wrong he wasn't emphasizing the gifts he's emphasizing the attributes of all these for like this sermon knowledge I should I that's a mistake so Paul says I want you to have overflowing discernment to know right and wrong now go back to Hebrews 5 10 this is familiar actually you know yeah you got your BIOS but I can pull it my god no I don't so you'll have to read it sorry I thought that has here's 5 10 a lot of people said my brother or they you know I hear a lot of you run the message all we need some meat preaching or we need some deep preaching you know what that is that's judgment ok get any deeper than judging having the Holy Spirit in your life to judge whether this app is right this relationship is right or wrong this conversation is right or wrong you can't get any deeper than that that's the core to the Word of God oh come on preach me some meat I don't want any milk well let me show you what the meat is the meat is discerning between the right spirit and the wrong spirit Hebrews 5:10 Hall of God is high priest after the order of Melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered singing you're dull of hearing all saying I can't preach I'm not cussing to eat because you just can't receive it we wouldn't be able to understand it aren't you glad he could understand about hesita it was Jesus before he came to the flat body praise God hey it wasn't Jesus's body it was Jesus's spirit praise God but they couldn't handle that imagine they see Maragos a new Paul's a new false America if they couldn't handle both headaches preacher first vote for when for the time ye ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God now he lists them at the next chapter like faith America was laying on an eternal judgment water baptism he lists all the foundational doctrines it that you should be able to teach some money and are become such as have need of milk and not strong meat so Paul says Christians message Christians can start off and become really strong and start eating meat but then by their own choice they become little babies again they can't head they can't stomach imagine we we don't see that right with our children thank goodness he makes having a seven-year-old see Danny grab my Baba ma Makai my Baba imagine an eight-year-old chung or a 13 year old child got all these teeth oh can I have my Bible for bed before I go to bed tonight but Paul said you can do that in the spiritual you can be so hungry and they see the Word of God and rejoice in it but then because you get lazy and you don't grow up God he'll keep feeding you got to go back to just the first beginning doctrines I don't really understand even the water baptism no turkey neck and I say this with love we then people's leave this church and then there they're not even sure if the Lord Jesus Christ baptism is right anymore by them telling me by them telling me they don't know if father son Holy Ghost is right anymore or Lord Jesus Christ now what is happening this is happening they become lazy see and not growing in the Word of God not asking God for revelation right not hungry in the thirsting after righteous and now they're not even sure if our very foundation they're not even sure of their foundation in terms I told you recently researches sixty-year-old video many women come up to me not even sure of their saying yes been the message churches 30 40 50 years you see how this is fun deeply this is a board 60 year old men and women come up weeping I'm not even sure if I'm saved because you don't grow in knowledge you don't grow in judgment pretty soon you've allowed this are you sitting on that and my medicine habits or spirits you get a bad habit so listen to this get a bad habit to look at that and now your evil spirits and now they so confuse you your life doesn't even look like a Christian and now it's so confused you're not even sure if you're saying with a meant always wouldn't know that I'm safe sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost right David I don't want to be any doubts and hi you that by accepting the good approving the excellent and rejecting the evil every single day since to be at you don't get any days off dewy if the day we take off that today Satan gets in Christian that used to handle preach deep brother Jesse but now them I'm sure if I'm saying we go back to that and we make sure what was that salvation all about can we go back over justification again which is up I mean it's okay if you need that and you haven't studied it for a long time I'd say like are you wondering my saved or not am i sanctified or not so see they become as babes that need milk and not strong meat for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe in church i you know when i heard me part gave the message i went to churches and they told us over the pulpit they said we just throw up we do a circle of topics we do grace love salvation and the crops and they said that's our circle we just go round and around that circle there they can they minutes to me right there that they were a Milton Church and even before the message even before the message I was more hungry and I had to leave I didn't go to a Baptist Church because I was hungry for more of the Word of God I knew that I thought what about the gifts of the Spirit what about the super dancer what about miracles you see how real Christian that loves God real child of God real son or daughter they gotta have more than milk they gotta have meat raised up hey got a real child of God won't stay on milk a real child of God will go to meet verse 14 much strong me come on preacher preach speak to me briefly but strongly belong to them that are full of age even those who by reason of their use have their senses exercised to discern good and evil the most deep and impactful sermons should be ones that point you to each day recognizing the two spirits within the framework of the church all right now don't give your own there won't be red leather days where someone will preach his store beneath him go preach up America and be the great Mike service service will never bring it right with any man we talked about that there are servants will never forget but you're not if you're not growing within those red letter days something's wrong with your life that right church pretty soon you can't handle just the regular I'm sorry I should say the regular but yeah the regular teaching about the destruction judge right keep holy stay true stay sanctified judge that writer judge this right and wrong be holy every day living God's presence amen pretty soon that becomes old and spiritually people wither away and they can't understand God's working I don't want to be that kind of church Paul didn't want the Philippians to be that kind of church all only a church that grew in grace and knowledge in all judgment look Paul was so he was so serious he used the word jealousy you're ready jealous of your husband or wife you know your bread everybody jealous on you maybe your children or something this was a gothic joke not an evil one hard to reach them and then he'd seen their soul safe he stayed never he said a year and a half a year and a half I've been here preaching 14 years I've been preaching together by God's grace he stayed a year and a half with the Corinthians and he said I'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy I don't want you to become loose in your spiritual life I want you to remain chaste and pure I'm Seles over you that you remain true to Jesus in every area of your life don't flirt with the world oh praise God that's what he wrote where's my ten minutes he was jealous or zealous that work means zealous to remain pure immaculate clean virgins to Christ he was jealous oh don't don't let this in your life sinks don't let this in your life please don't that don't fall away from God don't become a slob little become lazy who's so jealous of them i I ice for house you I showed you Christ and now you must remain faithful to Christ you get the same body in terms this is powerful I preached this years ago no give me your bread the Galatians had less circumcision back in the church and they believed some of them were started leave okay yet to be saved yeah you got to believe in Jesus we also gotta be circumcised and Paul said am i become your enemy because I tell you the truth the people that he says you used to be you you wouldn't rip off your eyes and give them to me but now that was at the beginning but now when there he's coming against her circumcision that doctrine he's saying I'm your enemy now and he said my little children of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you now you know what he's saying Church he's saying due to your legalism I need to take you back and seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost because apparently you were not born again and that's some serious talk right there is it see when people start adding documents in that affect your salvation that you
