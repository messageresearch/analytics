[0:00] Grace good to see brother mercy and
[0:02] Claude and Patrick God bless you
[0:03] Brothers good to see you tonight boy
[0:05] you're going to really spoil me coming
[0:07] on Wednesday night brother so thank you
[0:08] for coming it's such a joy to have you
[0:10] Brothers God bless you
[0:13] Hallelujah God is so good I just want to
[0:17] read here uh 1 Corinthians 1 and 1
[0:19] through
[0:20] three I'm going to try to get through
[0:22] chapter 2 tonight we'll kind of see how
[0:24] the Lord leads by the grace of
[0:28] God first Cor Ians 1 veres 1
[0:38] through3 yeah I've just been you know as
[0:40] I've looked as we started the series
[0:41] I've just been astounded to see the
[0:43] actual state that the Corinthian Church
[0:45] was in and then to see uh what God did
[0:49] in them and God how God corrected them
[0:52] and then how Paul tried to solidify them
[0:56] or give them a foundation in Christ
[0:58] despite the sin in the church
[1:00] it's amazing grace hallelujah amen and
[1:03] so and then as I said uh uh you know if
[1:05] we look at our church and we don't have
[1:07] those issues then that means we're a
[1:08] pretty clean church by God's grace right
[1:11] a pretty mature Church by the grace of
[1:12] God right nobody's getting drunk at the
[1:14] Lord's table we had communion a few
[1:16] weeks ago nobody got drunk right nobody
[1:18] suing each other right hallelujah we're
[1:20] we're doing good with that Hallelujah no
[1:22] sexual sin nobody's sleeping around
[1:24] everybody's faithful to their vows and
[1:26] faithful if they're single and
[1:27] everything like that by the grace of God
[1:29] that's a pretty much mature church and
[1:30] we're thankful for that that's the mercy
[1:32] of God on our lives hallelujah we're
[1:34] thankful for God's mercy so we're very
[1:37] thankful and good to look at this of
[1:38] course this was a book of Acts church we
[1:40] saw it in Acts chapter 18 how Paul
[1:43] didn't want to stay there but uh Jesus
[1:44] said fear not I've got many people in
[1:47] this city and no man will hurt you what
[1:50] a blessing to know that Christ is with
[1:51] us hallelujah we have nothing to fear
[1:54] because Christ is with us amen so verse
[1:56] one I'll read one uh I'll read one and
[2:00] then we can all read two and three Paul
[2:03] called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ
[2:05] through the will of God and S sanes our
[2:08] brother 1 two three unto the Church of
[2:12] God which is at Corinth to them that are
[2:15] sanctify in Christ Jesus called to be
[2:19] Saints with all that in every place
[2:22] called upon the name of Jesus Christ Our
[2:25] Lord both theirs and ours Grace be unto
[2:30] you and peace from God our Father and
[2:33] from the Lord Jesus Christ may God add
[2:36] his Blessing to the reading of his word
[2:37] you can be seated you can switch over H
[2:40] I have a few uh slides to show here by
[2:43] God's
[2:44] grace you have to bear with me I got a
[2:46] cold after church on Sunday night I went
[2:48] home I started coughing and sneezing so
[2:50] if you have to forgive
[2:52] me a little uh got a little runny nose
[2:55] and so forth like that but other than
[2:57] that doing good by God's grace hope
[2:59] everybody else is doing everybody else
[3:00] doing good today Hallelujah I guess if
[3:02] you're at church you're doing good
[3:04] Hallelujah so I want to just uh briefly
[3:06] before we get started here look at again
[3:08] CI Scofield's outline of this letter
[3:10] this is of course the first letter and
[3:12] uh tonight we'll just be looking at at
[3:14] the second section the first section is
[3:16] the Believers standing in Grace we're
[3:18] going to start
[3:19] there and then uh we're going into the
[3:22] carnal state of the Corinthians now
[3:25] chapter 2 doesn't really deal with a lot
[3:27] of carnality as you'll see but then in
[3:30] chapter three so chap at the end of
[3:31] chapter one and chapter three and then
[3:34] especially five he deals with a lot of
[3:36] the carnality of course with sexual
[3:39] Morality In chapter 5 and so forth um
[3:42] but good good lessons for us how many
[3:43] you been enjoying the Corinthian Series
[3:44] so far Amen brother William said this to
[3:47] me now I can say it because he's not
[3:48] here he said brother Jesse I've been in
[3:49] the message 40 years he said and the
[3:51] word of God keeps getting deeper all the
[3:53] time I said praise God that's the kind
[3:55] of testimony I want to have that's why I
[3:57] told him I said the word of God is
[3:58] getting deeper all the time more rich
[4:01] and that's what we're going to see the
[4:02] word of God is here to enrich your life
[4:05] Hallelujah and if it's not enriching
[4:07] your life then it's time to have faith
[4:09] in it because the Bible said you got to
[4:10] mix Faith with the word of God
[4:12] hallelujah have faith in God's word how
[4:14] many want Faith tonight in God's word
[4:16] that would be the greatest blessing of
[4:17] your life that you could be enriched by
[4:19] the word of God that you hear tonight
[4:21] and strengthen you for your battles that
[4:23] lay ahead Hallelujah now I want to
[4:25] follow up on the scoffers I don't know
[4:27] uh if you remember I was preaching a
[4:28] little bit on scoffers on Sunday that's
[4:30] because brother brandham preached on
[4:31] scoffers at the beginning of the Rapture
[4:34] sermon 1965 from y Yuma
[4:38] Arizona and uh you know these are just
[4:40] my notes I didn't really have time to
[4:41] kind of like you know look make them
[4:42] look nice I just kind of put them in
[4:44] here but uh the the second example I
[4:46] gave you the first example was one of
[4:47] the Supreme Court Justices who said what
[4:49] is a woman I don't know what a woman is
[4:51] that's complete Insanity to not know
[4:53] what a woman is uh as we saw and then
[4:56] they want the first woman president how
[4:57] can they get a woman president if they
[4:59] don't know what a woman is that doesn't
[5:00] make any sense um but you know here I'm
[5:03] following up you know I I never finished
[5:05] this thought on the
[5:06] astrophysicist who uh of course is an
[5:08] atheist and tries to turn people away uh
[5:11] from from Christianity or any kind of
[5:14] Faith uh and I said you know he was so
[5:17] close on his uh his uh origins of the
[5:21] universe but so far away remember his
[5:24] Origins his Origins uh was that you know
[5:28] they had all these molecules that
[5:30] weren't very weighty light light
[5:31] molecules and then uh it Formed into
[5:34] these stars then when the stars exploded
[5:36] over billions of years all that all that
[5:38] was left over from the explosions cessed
[5:41] or came together and eventually made
[5:43] living organisms that's the biggest
[5:45] bunch of nonsense that's ever been
[5:48] spoken Hallelujah it reminds me of
[5:51] Charles Darwin who said the smaller the
[5:53] organism gets uh the less complex it is
[5:58] and we find out it's EX exactly the
[6:00] opposite the smaller you look I'm sorry
[6:03] the the the deeper you look into the
[6:05] Small Things the more complex they
[6:08] get yeah You' been uh nature been
[6:10] learning about cells yet cells and
[6:12] nucleuses okay you're going to get there
[6:15] huh how many know what do they compare
[6:16] one cell to one cell in your body what
[6:18] do they compare it to a massive City a
[6:22] cell just one cell and the nucleus then
[6:24] is like having its own uh major city
[6:27] like think of all the roads in a city
[6:28] right all the the connections that's
[6:30] what one cell is how many know how many
[6:33] uh cells in your body right now
[6:36] trillions and how many does your body
[6:38] make how many new cells does your body
[6:39] make every day Millions your body's a
[6:42] cell making machine Hallelujah and they
[6:45] just constantly and and then this this
[6:47] smart guy says well somehow all these
[6:50] molecules all came together uh and and
[6:53] then eventually we have living organisms
[6:56] that's a bunch of Tommy rot so he was so
[6:59] far away because he's basically saying
[7:00] stars have the power to write DNA after
[7:04] cesing for billions of years I put LOL
[7:07] on that one that makes me laugh out
[7:10] loud any person that knows I'm going to
[7:12] show you a picture in just a moment I'll
[7:13] just show it to you now this is one cell
[7:16] out of the trillions that are in your
[7:17] body this is one
[7:19] cell inside a cell is a nucleus right
[7:23] inside of the nucleus is
[7:26] chromosomes and if you start unwrapping
[7:28] a chromosome you'll eventually get to
[7:30] the DNA structure and it goes all the
[7:32] way down to a the a single Neo Neo uh
[7:35] Neo I can never say n nucleotide I
[7:38] cannot say it so forgive me I don't
[7:40] teach this this actually isn't my
[7:41] teaching uh subject matter right here
[7:44] this is far far above my pay grade but
[7:46] you break it down to the very building
[7:48] blocks of life right now DNA in other
[7:52] words has this these are all
[7:54] instructions this is you know Caris is
[7:56] going to be so tall Haven's going to
[7:58] have this color hair Victoria's going to
[8:00] have uh this size hands this is all the
[8:03] information this is instructions and
[8:05] it's in every
[8:07] cell but then the proteins and these
[8:09] other molecules come and they read this
[8:12] and then they go build the bones they
[8:14] build the muscles and all these
[8:16] things so God put a book of instructions
[8:19] in every single cell now I heard a good
[8:22] preacher say this uh he said he took a
[8:26] book to these atheists and he said uh
[8:28] what if I could give you any proof about
[8:31] God would you believe it and she'd say
[8:33] yes but it have to be substantial you
[8:35] know how how smart those people are have
[8:37] to be such substantial proof that then I
[8:39] could believe in God and he said okay
[8:42] what are the chances I told you that all
[8:45] these words in here all these letters in
[8:47] here were at one time all this ink was
[8:50] up in the sky somewhere and they
[8:52] randomly fell down and landed in exactly
[8:55] the right location to make this book
[8:57] what are the chances of that and she
[8:58] said oh there's no chance of that and he
[9:01] said what if I told you there's this
[9:03] much information and millions times more
[9:06] in every single cell in your
[9:10] body he said would that be enough proof
[9:13] and they said well no not really but
[9:15] they know it's
[9:16] right think about that in every cell I
[9:19] I've heard this Saints if you could
[9:21] unroll every
[9:22] chromosome if you could unroll it it
[9:24] would go all the way up to the Moon in
[9:25] back so many times there's so much
[9:28] information in just one of these uh
[9:31] cells here and these are chromosomes
[9:33] right and you've got trillions of so
[9:35] cells in your
[9:36] body see so the more com the more deeper
[9:39] you get the smaller you get the more
[9:41] complex it is that's how great our God
[9:43] is amen he hides these things from the
[9:46] wise and prudent and reveals it unto
[9:48] babe such as we
[9:50] learn hallelujah oh my so he's so far
[9:53] away how could
[9:55] Stars uh make DNA and write how could
[9:58] Stars put all that code in there and
[10:00] tell uh this chicken to be this size or
[10:03] or that that elephant to be that size
[10:05] how could Stars put that together
[10:07] randomly it'd be as impossible as this
[10:10] happening
[10:11] randomly there's nothing random to
[10:13] Creation it's all by God's design
[10:15] Hallelujah CU church let me tell you
[10:17] especially you young girls you're
[10:19] fearfully and wonderfully made amen
[10:21] that's what the Bible says and the Bible
[10:23] says my soul knows it right well my soul
[10:26] knows this was designed by a designer
[10:28] Hallelujah
[10:30] this was created by a Creator this
[10:32] wasn't random chance you're not random
[10:34] chance that you're here tonight
[10:36] Hallelujah you came here to hear about
[10:37] Jesus Christ and him crucified
[10:40] Hallelujah and the power of the Cross
[10:42] will change your life if your life
[10:44] hasn't been change it's because you're
[10:46] not drawing on the benefits of the cross
[10:48] of Jesus Christ hallelujah how many know
[10:51] that tonight amen so he's so far away
[10:53] because he's saying stars have power to
[10:56] write DNA but he's so close because we
[10:59] all came from the explosion of let there
[11:01] be
[11:02] light right so he's thinking oh there
[11:04] was an explosion and then all this came
[11:06] together well that's partially
[11:08] right right whatever God spoke on each
[11:11] of the seven or six days that's what
[11:13] happened he spoke it and it's like the
[11:15] word of God exploded and it created
[11:18] God's word is a creative act it's
[11:20] creative power and we all come from the
[11:23] explosion of God's word out of his mouth
[11:26] Hallelujah and then we all and then he
[11:29] also said see we came from Heaven well
[11:31] or the cosmos but we know we came from
[11:33] further than that we came from the mind
[11:35] of God the creator of the cosmos and he
[11:39] said we he said and he said we're
[11:40] literally Stardust well friends we
[11:43] didn't come from the stars but the Bible
[11:44] said will shine like the stars
[11:48] Hallelujah the Bible says anyone who
[11:51] tries to get people to live righteous
[11:53] will shine like the stars in
[11:55] eternity see that's why our young men
[11:58] our young teenagers try to encourage
[11:59] your friends to live a Godly life God
[12:02] will honor you if you honor God
[12:04] hallelujah I'm glad I gave my life to
[12:06] Jesus at 19 I had a lot of scars before
[12:08] that but I'm glad I repented and I'm
[12:11] glad I started preaching at 21 years old
[12:13] amen I would not change a thing
[12:15] hallelujah it's a joy to preach for
[12:17] Jesus Christ it's a joy to serve Jesus
[12:19] Christ to see God come and use you or
[12:22] speak through you or help somebody or
[12:23] answer one of your prayers there could
[12:25] be no greater privilege in life than to
[12:27] have Christ use you for His Glory
[12:28] Hallelujah
[12:30] amen glory to God and then the remember
[12:33] God told Abraham he said your seed will
[12:35] be like the stars of heaven so I do have
[12:37] a connection to the Stars Hallelujah but
[12:39] I did not come from the stars I came
[12:41] from the maker of the Stars
[12:43] Hallelujah so again church God is so
[12:46] great fearfully and wonderfully made
[12:49] hallelujah it's all by Design and that
[12:53] and now just so you know on those videos
[12:55] this had DNA has been enough to convince
[12:58] atheists that they is a God because
[13:01] there's so much order there's there's
[13:03] such a plan here uh there's so it's like
[13:05] code on a computer who's done code on a
[13:07] computer anybody done code on okay
[13:09] Nature has I'll add you a little bit
[13:11] right you write code what does the code
[13:16] do it makes the program do what makes
[13:19] the
[13:21] program yeah you can read it better and
[13:22] it makes the program run right Elijah do
[13:24] you you ever make an app or anything
[13:25] like that okay just did some code I did
[13:28] some code back in high school school too
[13:29] I just typed in a few things and then
[13:31] you click play or whatever and then the
[13:33] like you know the little thing the
[13:34] little computer guys would March and go
[13:35] this way and go that way when you set
[13:38] the code you set directions for what's
[13:41] going to happen and that's what God did
[13:43] God set directions inside of your body
[13:45] so you can be happy with how tall you
[13:47] are now I wish I was a little taller
[13:49] like Elijah M okay but I'm not going to
[13:51] be
[13:52] jealous or you might wish you had that
[13:55] this many this this type of smile or
[13:57] that type of smile or or this type of
[13:59] hair that type of hair but you got to
[14:00] know God had it all pre-planned out
[14:03] hallelujah hallelujah I'll say like this
[14:06] for some of us we just got to do the
[14:07] best we can with what we've been given
[14:09] Hallelujah right one thing for know one
[14:11] thing we know for sure when we get to
[14:13] heaven we'll have a glorified body
[14:15] likened unto his glorious body
[14:17] Hallelujah and then we'll shine with the
[14:19] same light that Christ has Hallelujah in
[14:21] other words we'll have the glory the
[14:23] light of the Holy Spirit now I want to
[14:25] look a little more I was reading this
[14:26] morning as I Was preparing my sermon I
[14:28] was reading through chapter one again
[14:30] just to kind of refresh myself in
[14:31] Chapter 2 and I want to look at verse
[14:34] two unto the Church of God which is at
[14:36] Corinth to them that are Sanctified in
[14:38] Christ Jesus called to be Saints with
[14:42] all that in every place call upon the
[14:44] name of Jesus Christ Our Lord both
[14:46] theirs and ours now I like this Paul
[14:49] connects the Corinthian Church to every
[14:50] other church so Church even though
[14:53] sometimes we feel all alone we're not
[14:55] all alone we're connected to Elijah's
[14:57] Church in Michigan right we're connected
[14:59] to brother Brooks's church out there
[15:01] brother Jim shakes out there we're
[15:03] connected by the Holy Spirit I mean how
[15:06] many times says uh Brian Hawkins come or
[15:09] Jim Jim shate come last time Jim shate
[15:10] came remember in November he preached on
[15:12] Dancing that's exactly what I was
[15:13] preaching the last time in other words
[15:16] God has given the Bride of Jesus Christ
[15:17] the same thoughts as we're going to see
[15:20] the bride of Christ has the mind of
[15:22] Christ Hallelujah so we're receiving the
[15:25] Same Spirit the same word and it it's
[15:28] something that unites us praise God
[15:31] doesn't divide us it's Satan that wants
[15:33] to divide us it's Jesus trying to unite
[15:35] us hallelujah amen now we of course we
[15:38] have to rebuke sin and everything like
[15:39] that H but but ultimately uh if people
[15:42] are saved we're United by the blood of
[15:44] Jesus Christ
[15:46] Hallelujah now uh I highlighted to them
[15:50] because scoffield if you got a scoffield
[15:52] Bible you'll see there's a footnote by
[15:54] them and remember this is the same group
[15:57] that has all the sin problems we noted
[15:59] previously so here's a quick reminder
[16:01] these are all the problems in the church
[16:04] first of all they are divided well uh
[16:07] I'm of Apollos I'm of Peter well I'm
[16:10] better than all of you I'm of Jesus I
[16:12] don't follow any preachers I follow
[16:13] Jesus well Jesus ordained preachers so
[16:16] you can't get away from preachers right
[16:18] right so they're all divided who's the
[16:21] greatest preacher and who baptized me
[16:22] how did I become a Christian which
[16:24] preacher brought brought me into the
[16:26] messeng OR which preacher brought me in
[16:28] into Christianity they're all divided
[16:29] about we're better than that preacher
[16:31] this preacher is better than that
[16:32] preacher that was the first problem then
[16:34] there was sexual immorality right a man
[16:37] sleeping with his
[16:38] stepmom and then there was there was
[16:41] legal issues Saints suing each
[16:44] other and then there was drunkenness at
[16:46] the Lord's table and then uh when they
[16:48] would get drunk they wouldn't let the
[16:49] poor church members eat their food that
[16:51] they would eat outside the
[16:54] church and then they were uh they needed
[16:56] order with spiritual gifts they would
[16:58] just do so many tongues so many
[17:00] interpretations and Paul says two or
[17:03] three at the most Hallelujah that's
[17:06] right let there be an interpreter Let
[17:09] There Be judges to the
[17:11] interpretations and then he said they
[17:12] lack
[17:14] generosity so think about that they had
[17:16] all these gifts but they weren't very
[17:17] giving people my goodness and then also
[17:21] later I read this later I added this uh
[17:23] last week they also allowed false
[17:25] preachers to come in that actually these
[17:28] preachers pitted the church against St
[17:31] Paul who started the
[17:33] church and so that's remember Paul has
[17:35] to go through all of his resume you know
[17:36] here's all the things I've suffered what
[17:37] have they suffered right and of course
[17:39] they had suffered anything because
[17:40] they're false teachers but true men of
[17:42] God go through suffering Hallelujah they
[17:45] get criticized they get uh belittled Now
[17:48] in America there hasn't been much
[17:49] physical uh persecution yet and thank
[17:51] God for that but we don't know when it's
[17:52] going to happen but yeah for sure it's
[17:55] coming Hallelujah but they allowed false
[17:58] preachers to come in and now the false
[18:01] preachers were probably allowing a lot
[18:02] of this stuff right the false preachers
[18:05] probably wanted to be the most popular
[18:07] preacher in the church Hallelujah right
[18:11] they probably allowed sexual morality
[18:12] but now remember recall all the grace
[18:15] Paul extended to this leaven church this
[18:18] was a leaven Church everybody say leav
[18:20] ready this was a leav church this was a
[18:23] church uh that had the sourdough and it
[18:25] was it was uh rising and it should not
[18:28] should not been puffed up but uh sin was
[18:31] taking an impact on the church it wasn't
[18:33] in the right condition it should have
[18:35] been in but look at all the grace Paul
[18:38] gives them you know why because he's
[18:39] going to come bring them a sword not not
[18:41] not soon after this he starts with all
[18:43] this grace and then he's going to bring
[18:46] correction Hallelujah so what does he
[18:48] first call him he said you're Sanctified
[18:50] that means set apart in Christ Jesus
[18:53] you're called to be
[18:56] Saints and then he says Grace and peace
[18:59] unto you from God our Father and the
[19:01] Lord Jesus Christ now Paul says I thank
[19:03] God always on your behalf for the grace
[19:06] of God which is given you by Christ
[19:08] Jesus now were they a perfect Church no
[19:11] but Paul said thank God you're not out
[19:13] in the world anymore Hallelujah he was
[19:16] still able to thank God even though they
[19:18] got sin problems even though they got
[19:20] anger and pride and sexual immorality uh
[19:24] and they got they got uh discrimination
[19:26] you know the rich against the poor even
[19:28] though they've got got all this going on
[19:30] Paul's starting off with I'm thankful
[19:32] that God has started something in your
[19:34] life church let's be thankful if God has
[19:36] started something in your life praise
[19:38] God Let's do let's do something to try
[19:40] to draw closer to God tonight Hallelujah
[19:44] verse five that in everything you're
[19:47] enriched by Him in all utterance and in
[19:50] all knowledge church if you're paying
[19:52] attention tonight if you're pulling on
[19:53] the word of God you should be enriched
[19:55] spiritually when you walk out of this
[19:57] place
[19:59] Hallelujah just one word of somebody
[20:01] says well I want to hear from God well I
[20:03] just read you what God Said So that you
[20:04] just heard from God that should help you
[20:06] out Hallelujah that should help you out
[20:09] it's thus sayith the word of God
[20:10] hallelujah it has to help you if you
[20:13] have a Hungry Heart to know God
[20:16] hallelujah even as the testimony of
[20:19] Christ was confirmed in you so Paul says
[20:21] you've got Grace I'm thankful for you
[20:23] you're enriched by everything and God
[20:26] has confirmed a testimony in your life
[20:28] life you have some type of testimony now
[20:31] did they have a little church did they
[20:33] have a few blemishes on their testimony
[20:35] lately yes but did Paul did Paul just
[20:39] dechristianize them no Paul was gracious
[20:43] to them so see church this is kind of
[20:45] what we looked at last Wednesday night
[20:46] with brother random he was very gracious
[20:48] with the Pentecostals
[20:50] remember uh with his Full Gospel
[20:52] businessmen he called them fine Brethren
[20:55] remember that and he just slowly he just
[20:58] kind of on the side tried to introduce
[21:00] the message to them and talked about
[21:02] Revelation 10:7 Malachi 4:5 and6 and uh
[21:06] Luke 17:30 all these verses God had
[21:08] brother random fulfill he just tried to
[21:11] put it out there he knew if the people
[21:13] really wanted truth they get it
[21:14] Hallelujah church we know we know all
[21:18] God's elect will come to God hallelujah
[21:21] all that the father has given me will
[21:23] come to me Hallelujah that's right
[21:25] church now and look in all this he says
[21:29] you come behind and no gift they didn't
[21:30] lack any gifts sometimes we look around
[21:33] here and maybe other churches and we we
[21:35] feel like well we don't have many gifts
[21:37] but remember when people say that
[21:39] they're mostly talking about tongues
[21:41] right that's what most people want just
[21:42] tongues all the time because that's what
[21:43] Pentecost has that's what brother Ram
[21:46] had to come out of right but these
[21:49] Corinthians had uh no lack of gifts but
[21:52] they had all this sin in there and so
[21:54] remember brother R told us he said if
[21:56] you gave me the choice of the nine gifts
[21:59] with sin but the choice of having
[22:02] another choice of just love without the
[22:03] nine gifts he said I take the love of
[22:05] God every
[22:06] time because if you have the love of God
[22:09] it will produce those gifts in your life
[22:11] hallelujah
[22:13] amen verse eight who shall also confirm
[22:16] you unto the end I like that God's going
[22:18] to confirm you God's going to keep you
[22:20] all the way to the end none of us know
[22:23] when our end is but God promised us
[22:25] he'll be with me all the way to the end
[22:28] amen Hallelujah I'm hoping I got at
[22:30] least 50 50 more years brother Rod
[22:32] hopefully 43 hopefully I got 50 more
[22:35] years maybe
[22:36] 60 I'm trying to be uh positive
[22:39] Hallelujah but I I got to believe if
[22:42] Jesus has watched over me for these 403
[22:45] I trust to watch for over me till the
[22:47] end
[22:50] Hallelujah now look he says confirm you
[22:53] that you might be what blameless in the
[22:56] day of our Lord Jesus Christ how is it
[22:59] possible that Christians like us can go
[23:01] to heaven and be blameless there's only
[23:04] one way that we could be blameless as if
[23:06] someone took all of our guilt someone
[23:08] took all of our shame that man's name is
[23:10] Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's who I
[23:13] praise right AA that's who I praise amen

[23:21] children don't I don't want to just say
[23:23] casa all the children did a great job
[23:24] Malachi did a great job
[23:26] playing think about that and now think
[23:29] about who he's talking
[23:30] about is Paul saying the Corinthian
[23:33] Church could be blameless what do you
[23:34] think Church yes they can be
[23:37] blameless how are they going to be
[23:39] blameless by confessing their sins and
[23:42] trusting in the righteousness of Jesus
[23:45] Christ Hallelujah the imputed
[23:48] righteousness you confess your sins
[23:50] right you lose your sins and you gain
[23:53] Christ's righteousness oh thank God for
[23:54] the blood applied amen oh my who is Fai
[23:58] faithful in this life we try to be
[24:00] faithful but are we really faithful no

[24:37] your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath
[24:40] he reconciled in the body of his flesh
[24:42] through death so God has reconciled you
[24:46] God has brought you back into Fellowship

[25:02] unreprovable because of the death of his
[25:04] son Jesus Christ amen so if you've been

[25:39] act like Christ
[25:41] Hallelujah there's none good no not one

[26:12] eyes we got to stop looking at ourselves

[26:16] ourselves Through The Eyes of Christ
[26:19] that's that's the difference right there

[27:34] somebody's going to try to talk you out
[27:35] of I'll come stand with you let's get
[27:37] out some Bible verses let's get out some
[27:39] some of that those scientific facts

[27:45] is a God Amen his son is Jesus Christ
[27:47] Hallelujah and he's coming back again
[27:50] hallelujah amen glory to God Amen which
[27:54] was preached to every creature which is
[27:55] under heaven where I of Paul and made a
[27:58] minister glory to God so we got to look
[28:00] at we got to look at God's sight what
[28:03] does God see when he looks at me now
[28:05] this was so good to me this morning I
[28:07] can tell I'm not going to get very far
[28:08] on my sermon tonight now this is what
[28:10] stuck out to me now I'm going to zoom in
[28:11] here so this is Scofield's notes I'm G
[28:13] to zoom in a little bit let's read that
[28:16] so to them that are called right there's
[28:19] the footnote there one there verses 2
[28:21] to9 in contrast with verses 10 through1
[28:25] 13 now remember in verses 1013 Paul's
[28:28] rebuking them for their
[28:30] divisions but before that he's
[28:33] complimenting them saying you're in
[28:34] Christ God is faithful uh God's going to
[28:37] be with you to the end you have Grace
[28:40] and
[28:42] peace
[28:43] Hallelujah some that might confuse some
[28:46] people but it doesn't confuse the
[28:49] Christian
[28:50] Hallelujah because we know this God sees
[28:53] us in heaven God sees you Patrick God
[28:57] sees you in heaven as a finished work
[29:00] like like all the sins already taken out
[29:02] God sees you in heaven as a perfect man
[29:05] CL that's how God sees you no matter
[29:07] what trials you go through in high
[29:08] school no matter what Temptations you
[29:11] suffer no doubt there's lots of them
[29:13] right especially in high school these
[29:14] days high school was bad in my day and
[29:16] John's day but man this really bad now
[29:20] right didn't it somebody said they had
[29:22] uh the ambulance come 10 times this year
[29:24] already to what the the school right the
[29:25] middle school that the Middle School
[29:28] Mercy 10
[29:30] times right but remember God he sees us
[29:34] as perfect in heaven because of the
[29:35] blood but on Earth he treats us like
[29:38] children that need
[29:40] correction and church you've all seen it
[29:42] if you don't correct children they
[29:43] become spoiled
[29:45] brats God does not want us to be spoiled
[29:48] brats so God gives us a lot of rebukes
[29:50] on Earth Hallelujah now how many know he
[29:53] gives blessings to he gave you all the
[29:56] oxygen you got tonight right he
[29:58] protected you gave you all the food
[30:00] shelter your job your money right Elijah
[30:03] is making good money now he's working
[30:04] full-time now he knows what it's like to
[30:05] be a grown man you know starting to feel
[30:08] that right you make got your own money
[30:10] pay your own bills you paying rent yet
[30:12] buddy okay well then once you start
[30:15] paying rent there you be a real man then
[30:17] I'm just joking but yeah rent is huge uh
[30:21] but see you know in in in heaven God
[30:23] sees us as perfect but on Earth God sees
[30:26] us as children that we got to overcome
[30:28] all of our uh all of our sinful
[30:31] desires right we're still in the flesh
[30:34] we're still battling sin all the
[30:36] time so Paul shows a contrast between
[30:40] God's love for them in verses 2-9 but
[30:42] then the correction starts coming down
[30:44] in 10 through1
[30:47] 13 so he says there's a difference
[30:49] between the believer's position in
[30:51] Christ in the family of God and his walk
[30:54] and his actual State everybody say
[30:56] position ready position
[30:58] position is what God sees you as in
[31:00] heaven but your walk is on Earth
[31:03] everybody say walk ready walk your walk
[31:05] is down here so it's it's different
[31:08] right God sees you in different
[31:11] states that's hard for us to understand
[31:14] but if we can catch it it'll really help
[31:16] us out in our Christian Journey
[31:18] Hallelujah brother R you got a scope for
[31:20] your Bible brother oh you do have you
[31:22] read it a little bit okay so are you
[31:25] familiar with this okay Glory good man
[31:28] man
[31:29] there oh man you're so blessed brother I
[31:33] started in 2009 that's when I first got
[31:35] my scopio B bless your heart Hallelujah
[31:37] don't wonder you're so
[31:38] blessed so there's a difference between
[31:40] your your position and your walk
[31:44] Christian position is in Grace is the
[31:46] result of the work of Christ and is
[31:49] fully entered at the moment Christ is
[31:51] received by faith and he lists all those
[31:54] verses the weakest most ignorant and
[31:57] fallow believer has precisely the same
[32:00] relationship and Grace as the most
[32:02] illustrious
[32:04] Saint right you have position in in
[32:06] heaven right didn't didn't the Bible say
[32:09] you're all Kings and Priests unto God
[32:12] brother Mercy didn't it say just the
[32:13] preachers are Kings and Priests under
[32:15] God is that what the Bible said no or oh
[32:18] just the brothers right not the sisters
[32:21] no we see uh we we see uh women as uh uh
[32:26] prophesying using the gift of proph
[32:27] Prophecy in the New Testament praise God
[32:30] Philip had four virgin daughters that
[32:32] prophesied
[32:34] Hallelujah and of course we know God
[32:36] used Deborah in a great way in the Old
[32:37] Testament as a judge she wasn't a
[32:38] preacher she wasn't a priestess she was
[32:40] just a judge like in a
[32:43] courtroom so see they have the same uh
[32:47] the same relationship as a child of God
[32:50] that's why I like that song I'm a Child
[32:52] of God yes I am there's a in heaven
[32:56] there's a place for me Church CH there's
[32:58] a place for you in heaven Hallelujah
[33:00] think of that think about that brother
[33:01] Claude you got a place that's got got
[33:03] your name right on that's Brother
[33:04] claude's house right there in heaven
[33:07] right you got a place Jesus said I go to
[33:10] prepare you a place did he not am I
[33:14] adding to the word does anyone think I'm
[33:16] adding to the word of God tonight I'm
[33:18] telling the
[33:19] truth because you in relationship we're
[33:23] the same in relationship
[33:25] hallelujah we're saved by Grace We're
[33:29] the called We're the Sanctified we're
[33:30] the Saints hallelujah amen we're God's
[33:34] people but our walk is where it all
[33:37] starts to change
[33:39] Hallelujah after all the work of God in
[33:42] his behalf the application of the word
[33:43] to walk and
[33:46] conscience okay so your conscience right
[33:49] how many battle your conscience this
[33:51] week am I am I doing enough this week am
[33:54] I does God love me this week has God
[33:56] heard my prayers this week week should I
[33:58] do this should I do that your
[34:01] conscience the Divine chastening anybody
[34:04] got a chastening recently where God
[34:05] rebuked you right that's what the Bible
[34:07] says the Bible says he chastens all his
[34:09] sons all his children the ministry the
[34:13] difficulties and trials of Life anybody
[34:15] have any trials or difficult life Parts
[34:19] lately he says of the path and the final
[34:23] transformation at the appearing of
[34:25] Christ have for their object to make the
[34:29] believer's character conform to the
[34:31] exalted position in Christ I like this
[34:34] he grows in Grace in other words church
[34:37] I'm already in Grace you're already in
[34:39] Grace
[34:41] Hallelujah you grow in the grace you're
[34:44] not growing into Grace I'm already in
[34:47] Grace
[34:49] Hallelujah I already am Hallelujah not
[34:52] one day Caris not one day Caris I'll be
[34:55] in Grace no I'm already standing in
[34:57] God's Grace amen like that song look
[35:00] where I'm standing now look look Church
[35:03] look where you're standing now not
[35:04] physically look
[35:08] spiritually how many believe you're
[35:09] standing in an unblamable condition
[35:11] right
[35:12] now in heaven yes I'll say Amen to that
[35:15] on Earth no you could probably blame me
[35:17] for some mistakes I made and that you
[35:18] I'd say Amen you're right I made
[35:21] mistakes but in heaven I don't have any
[35:24] praise God Amen you don't have any
[35:26] you're unreprovable unblamable in heaven
[35:29] because the blood of Jesus Christ has
[35:31] washed away all your sins they're thrown
[35:33] in the sea of forgetfulness and that's
[35:35] good enough for you and I oh my glory to
[35:38] God what a comment I tell you Mali found
[35:41] another good comment from scoffield
[35:43] scoffield had a lot of Revelation that
[35:44] guy
[35:46] my remember this church God's attitude
[35:49] about job in heaven he told the Devil
[35:51] he's perfect and upright but when God
[35:54] came down he said who is this
[35:56] guy same man not a different man same
[36:01] man so in one way uh we would be God's
[36:04] child God's child in heaven but when
[36:06] God's spirit comes down here to deal
[36:08] with our mistakes he rebukes
[36:11] us I'll say like this church he lets us
[36:15] suffer is that right didn't you let job
[36:18] suffer to Humble
[36:21] him right so God's still got to let us
[36:23] suffer many times church we won't obey
[36:26] unless God makes us suffer
[36:32] right
[36:34] Hallelujah that's right we have to be
[36:38] mindful of these
[36:39] things that we're learning we're going
[36:41] through a process of continual
[36:44] sanctification in heaven we're already
[36:46] called uh we're already uh in exalted
[36:49] position the Bible says he's already
[36:51] made us accepted in the Beloved
[36:53] hallelujah oh my I'm already accepted in
[36:56] heaven Saints you're you already are
[36:58] accepted by Heaven
[37:00] Hallelujah but it's this walk where our
[37:03] consciences get
[37:05] confused and we go through trials and
[37:07] temptations we don't feel like we're
[37:09] saved brother Braham said many times I
[37:11] don't even feel saved remember that
[37:12] beautiful quote he said but I don't base
[37:15] my walk upon feelings I base my walk
[37:17] upon the word of
[37:19] God hallelujah you don't have to raise
[37:22] your hands but how many would agree with
[37:24] brother brandom many times I don't even
[37:25] feel like I'm saved don't have to raise
[37:28] your hand that's what brother Bram said
[37:29] as a man of God right because he still
[37:32] had that human uh sin nature right he
[37:35] had to remember church we got desires of
[37:36] the Soul we got desires of the spirit
[37:38] and we got desires of the Flesh and
[37:40] every day we got to crucify the desires
[37:42] of the mind and the the Flesh and give
[37:45] the soul the word of
[37:47] God
[37:49] hallelujah now let me read this quote
[37:51] here I got a few quotes I think you'll
[37:52] like them brother bam said he's healing
[37:54] every person in here is healed right now
[37:56] now Church let's keep that in mind
[37:58] remember Jesus in in many sermons Jesus
[38:02] would heal the entire
[38:04] multitude how many remember that Paul
[38:07] had that happen too in his
[38:08] ministry now did that happen at every
[38:11] one of Jesus's Services no remember he
[38:14] went to some cities and the Bible said
[38:16] he could not do many mighty works
[38:18] because of what their unbelief so
[38:21] braham's in a spot he's led by the
[38:23] spirit in Indiana not too far from here
[38:26] he said every everybody's healed right
[38:28] now the Bible says you are every sinner
[38:31] inside the door and every sinner in this
[38:33] world is already saved and been saved
[38:35] since jesus' death at Calvary you say
[38:37] brother bam I was saved 10 years ago no
[38:39] you accepted it 10 years ago he took
[38:42] away the sin of the world 1900 years
[38:46] ago but it's your personal faith in a
[38:49] finished work that brings the results if
[38:52] you never accept it you'll die and
[38:54] without Mercy because you judge the Son
[38:56] of God thus us or thus rather if you're
[38:59] sick tonight he was wounded for our
[39:01] transgressions and with his stripes you
[39:02] were healed it's the past tense it isn't
[39:05] that I lay hands on you or any other
[39:07] minister lays hands on you it's your
[39:09] personal faith in a finished work that
[39:11] Christ did certainly how many agree with
[39:13] that amen now this is the one I sent you
[39:16] this morning what a beautiful quote this
[39:18] was how many enjoyed that this morning I
[39:20] was like so happy I'm like M it feels
[39:21] like i' I probably heard this before but
[39:23] I couldn't remember
[39:25] it when that blood said was broke for
[39:28] sin on Calvary every man coming to
[39:30] Christ purged by that blood has no more
[39:33] conscience of sin and is perfectly
[39:36] Anchored In Christ until the day of your
[39:38] Redemption now I'm a witness of that uh
[39:40] John Graham would know when I was a
[39:42] sinner and John and I talked about this
[39:44] many times when I was a sinner I did a
[39:46] lot of awful things I mean a lot of
[39:48] awful
[39:49] things I mean all day awful things right
[39:54] all week for 19 years all all awful all
[39:58] the time the worst music the worst
[40:00] things uh magazines and movies the worst
[40:03] things but church since I've been
[40:06] serving Jesus I don't even think about
[40:09] it I have no more conscience of sin
[40:11] because now my mind's on Jesus all the
[40:14] time I tell my wife all the time it's
[40:16] like I live I'm I'm I'm two different
[40:18] per people I can't even remember the
[40:20] life that I used to live unless somebody
[40:21] shows me a picture or a video or
[40:23] something like man I did that I went
[40:25] there I I don't even feel like that
[40:27] anymore either the Bible's true or not
[40:30] either the blood makes your mind pure or
[40:33] the blood doesn't how many know the
[40:35] blood makes your conscience clean
[40:37] Hallelujah glory to God yeah now the
[40:40] devil will bring back those memories but
[40:42] when you're walking the word loving
[40:44] Jesus you don't think of those things
[40:46] you're just full of the love of God
[40:47] hallelujah amen that is so true church I
[40:51] you know sometimes I hear like I hear a
[40:52] song at the restaurant like that's right
[40:54] yeah I used to listen to that when I was
[40:56] a sinner but I never ever think of it
[40:59] because I have a I have a clean
[41:01] conscience praise God because I spend
[41:04] and like we do we spend our time in the
[41:07] word of
[41:08] God
[41:09] hallelujah if you want to forget about
[41:11] the old things get your get your uh get
[41:13] your nose in the word of God
[41:16] hallelujah
[41:18] hallelujah now I love this Ephesians
[41:21] 4:30 grieve not the holy spirit of God
[41:24] whereby you're sealed until the day of
[41:25] your Redemption amen oh that makes the
[41:28] devil go anybody feel like the devil's
[41:31] been on your shoulder
[41:32] lately I got a scripture to make him
[41:36] go come on somebody Hallelujah brother
[41:39] Raam said this will make him
[41:40] go Satan says oh you're not going to
[41:43] last very long you're not going to make
[41:45] it through your
[41:47] 20s you're not going to serve God when
[41:49] you get older or you'll never be a good
[41:52] Christian I got a Bible verse to make
[41:54] him go the Bible says I'm sealed unto
[41:57] the day of my
[41:59] Redemption oh you're not going to make
[42:01] it to Heaven God's going to reject you
[42:03] sorry devil the Bible said I'm sealed
[42:06] I'm marked I'm God's Property until the
[42:09] day of my Redemption Hallelujah until I
[42:12] get a new body Hallelujah I am sealed
[42:15] that will make the devil flee
[42:17] Hallelujah so nobody should leave her
[42:19] with the devil on your shoulder you
[42:21] should quote that word you should quote
[42:23] the promise of God say I'm God's until
[42:25] the day of my Redemption amen that'll
[42:28] make the devil
[42:29] go
[42:31] Hallelujah when you realize what you
[42:35] are oh there's no good to me brother
[42:37] brandham brother BR says that's
[42:40] right I never was any good and neither
[42:43] was
[42:45] you I'm no good brother Jesse you're
[42:47] right neither was I but Jesus sealed me
[42:51] Hallelujah that will make the devil
[42:53] leave you if you quote the promise of
[42:56] God and believe leave his promise that
[42:58] you're sealed to the day of your
[43:01] Redemption now don't raise your hand but
[43:03] how many did that today how many quoted
[43:05] a word of God and you keep quoting
[43:07] throughout the day to keep the devil off
[43:08] you if you haven't Now's the Time amen
[43:14] hallelujah I never was any good neither
[43:17] was you there's nothing we could do
[43:18] about it that's the good part but when
[43:21] you can just realize that that you're no
[43:23] good then you'll not trust in your own
[43:26] goodness
[43:28] right your own goodness will never
[43:30] measure up you'll never feel good
[43:33] enough right so you can't trust in your
[43:37] goodness you have to trust in the
[43:39] goodness of
[43:40] Christ amen you'll never measure up to
[43:43] the standards like like I said you'll
[43:45] never measure up to reading your Bible
[43:46] enough or praying enough or going to
[43:49] church enough you'll never measure up to
[43:52] that now should you press toward the
[43:53] mark of the High Calling of God
[43:55] yes but but you don't put confidence in
[43:58] your ability you put your confidence in
[44:01] what Christ has done for
[44:03] you
[44:05] Hallelujah and that's how you make the
[44:07] devil go you say devil I'm sealed he
[44:10] called me he chose me he saved me his
[44:13] blood forgave all my sins he sealed me
[44:17] until the day I get a new body
[44:20] Hallelujah and he's not going to forsake
[44:22] me he's going to be faithful to me he's
[44:24] going to confirm me all the way to the
[44:26] end
[44:28] Hallelujah Patrick are you 16
[44:31] Patrick 16 Hallelujah I started serving
[44:34] God at 19 so from 19 to 43 I've seen God
[44:38] he's confirming me all the way to the
[44:40] end he keeps holding me in my trials he
[44:43] keeps giving me more grace as I go
[44:45] through tests
[44:47] Hallelujah he's confirmed me he
[44:49] strengthened me he's been the faithful
[44:51] one not me Christ has been faithful
[44:54] that's what we're going to see here
[44:55] brother B says if there's one thing you
[44:58] do you could do to Merit it you'd have
[44:59] something to brag
[45:02] about brother I'm not going to ask
[45:04] brother brother Rod but there's been
[45:07] people we've
[45:08] known maybe Rod hasn't but I've known
[45:10] people they almost brag about well I've
[45:13] sought I prayed this much I fasted this
[45:15] much I've sought God all the time I see
[45:17] God all the
[45:20] time but you can't say that to him
[45:23] nobody's gonna say well Jesus I deserve
[45:25] to go to heaven because I fasted and I I
[45:27] sought I sought you day and night Lord
[45:29] no you
[45:30] didn't some of you had you know you have
[45:33] to say Amen but some of us had some
[45:34] selfish days and some selfish nights
[45:37] where we didn't seek God like we ought
[45:38] to we did what we wanted to do rather
[45:41] than what God wanted us to do Hallelujah
[45:44] you can't say that you can't say I
[45:46] sought God all the time no man can come
[45:50] to me except my father draws him it's
[45:53] God seeking man not man seeking God
[45:57] oh glory amen that's right so you don't
[46:01] have one thing to say but God it was
[46:04] your grace that did
[46:07] it how did I get how did I get where I'm
[46:10] standing now God's grace did it for
[46:12] me God gave me unmar Grace tonight
[46:16] Hallelujah remember Church we're
[46:18] thinking in the context of a Corinthian
[46:21] Church that was filled with
[46:23] leaven everywhere you look there's sin
[46:26] there there's sin there there there's
[46:27] sin there for sure at the Lord's table
[46:30] there's sin there in the back and there
[46:31] sin right there in the front there
[46:33] there's there sins amongst the preachers
[46:35] talking bad against the prophet of God
[46:37] St Paul there's sin all over the
[46:41] place and Paul's trying to tell them God
[46:44] is faithful he'll confirm you to the end
[46:47] if you'll
[46:48] believe that's right as long as you as
[46:53] long as you're accepted in the Beloved
[46:55] how can God bring you into judgment when
[46:57] he's already judged Christ in your
[47:01] stead how could you have to suffer for
[47:03] your sins when Christ is already done it
[47:06] God would be a two-timer and an awful
[47:08] person when it was thoroughly paid by
[47:11] Jesus Christ and you'd accept it right
[47:14] God's not a two-timer God's not going to
[47:16] change his mind about
[47:18] you like uh some of you high school
[47:21] people see it right the dating they do
[47:23] two timers right you know two timer is
[47:25] one boy likes this girl he says you're
[47:27] the only one for me but then the behind
[47:29] her back he's he's like you're the only
[47:31] one for me that's a
[47:33] two-timer God's not going to do that to
[47:35] you God's not goingon to say I love you
[47:36] and I don't love you God loves you
[47:38] hallelujah amen God's a one-timer hallah
[47:43] God's a one-time he saved you in his
[47:45] mind before the foundational World God's
[47:47] not going to leave you he's not going to
[47:49] forsake you he died for you he loves you
[47:52] Hallelujah now a lot of those men you
[47:54] young sisters listen a lot of those boys
[47:56] out there are two timers even the
[47:59] message now the message people can
[48:01] probably say Amen to that a lot of those
[48:04] boys are liers they are two timers
[48:06] that's because they got a lustful demon
[48:08] Spirit on them that's right so you girls
[48:12] be careful as you get older now I'm
[48:13] shocking you now while you're young so
[48:15] so you're ready when the boys start
[48:17] coming and I'll be right there to back
[48:19] you up so will your
[48:20] dad
[48:23] Hallelujah glory and when did God accept
[48:27] you no
[48:28] look uh he says when it was he God's not
[48:31] a two-timer when it was thoroughly paid
[48:33] by Jesus Christ you accepted it and as
[48:36] long as God accepted Christ he accepted
[48:39] you with Christ that's awesome church
[48:43] was he accepted or not did God accept
[48:45] him that means you're
[48:48] accepted because all those who have
[48:50] faith in Jesus Christ are the Bible said
[48:53] they're the Seed of Abraham Hallelujah
[48:55] they're God's children as long as God
[48:58] accepted your his sacrifice the
[49:00] sacrifice of Jesus then God has to
[49:02] accept you and I CU we're trusting in
[49:04] the sacrifice of Jesus
[49:08] Christ that's the kind of God I'm going
[49:10] to serve right there when did he do it
[49:12] before the foundation of the world
[49:14] according to Ephesians 1: 14 and5 and
[49:16] when he spoke it into existence he spoke
[49:18] you redeemed with
[49:21] him see job was already redeemed in
[49:24] God's sight how could job say or how
[49:27] could God say job's a perfect man
[49:29] there's nobody like him in the whole
[49:31] earth it was because God had already
[49:34] forgiven him God had already accepted
[49:36] him in the Beloved and we have that same
[49:39] promise he's already accepted Us in the
[49:42] Beloved let's read that scripture I
[49:44] don't I don't I don't think I have it on
[49:45] this slide let me look it up get you got
[49:47] your Bible let's read it it'll do you
[49:48] good you can quote it while you're going
[49:50] in bed tonight you can say devil I'm
[49:52] accepting the Beloved then you then
[49:54] you'll stop thinking about the devil
[49:55] then you start praising God as you go to
[49:56] bed
[49:59] yep
[49:59] Ephesians thank you
[50:02] sir been it's been a minute since I
[50:04] preached on that there yeah Ephesians
[50:05] 1:6 thank you sir oh yeah it's right
[50:08] after the foundation of the world verse
[50:09] four is foundation of the world verse 6
[50:11] Ephesians 1:6 to the praise of the glory
[50:13] of his grace wherein he hath made us
[50:16] accepted in the Beloved and church you
[50:18] didn't do it yourself God made you
[50:20] accepted in heaven Jesus God allowed
[50:24] Jesus to die and if you have faith in
[50:27] Jesus God makes you accepted because you
[50:29] trust in his sacrifice you trust in his
[50:33] son now I don't know what you're praying
[50:36] tonight but you can have this confidence
[50:38] whatever you're praying for God hears
[50:39] you because you're accepted in the
[50:42] Beloved you just have to have faith
[50:44] either wait or know it's not God's will
[50:47] or you can have it right
[50:48] now right like remember Lena gave her
[50:51] testimony remember we prayed for her uh
[50:54] her family member who was lost remember
[50:55] that sister n me that was a quite a
[50:57] powerful prayer with brother Austin we
[50:59] were crying and weeping right here we
[51:01] knew God heard our prayer that night and
[51:03] God answered the next day right so God
[51:05] wasn't saying wait God saying I'm going
[51:07] to do it now but because why because
[51:09] we're accepting the Beloved that's why
[51:12] God heard our prayer he's already M
[51:14] we're already accepted we're not trying
[51:17] to be well someday I hope someday I hope
[51:19] I'll be good enough where God will
[51:21] accept me in the Beloved he's already
[51:22] done
[51:24] it I hope I hope someday God will will
[51:27] will will think I'm special and save me
[51:29] he's already saved
[51:31] me
[51:32] Hallelujah I'm already saved I'm already
[51:36] accepted the Beloved not by my works but
[51:38] by the works of
[51:40] Christ I just put my faith in him that
[51:42] makes me happy that's why I laugh it Mak
[51:44] I'm so happy this quote made me so happy

[51:53] as a feather I I feel great today
[51:56] Hallelujah
[51:58] your names are written in the Lamb's
[51:59] Book of Life before the foundation world
[52:01] and then you're scared W now look at
[52:03] that he's kind of rebuking
[52:04] everybody who's scar why why would we be
[52:07] scared our name was on the Lamb's Book
[52:08] of Life before the foundation of the
[52:10] world scared of
[52:12] what oh if I could just keep holding on
[52:15] to the message brother Ram said I quit
[52:17] that thinking a long time
[52:20] ago I never did even try in the first
[52:24] place I just turned loose and let him do
[52:28] the
[52:29] holding something keeps holding me
[52:31] Church how many know that song is a
[52:33] reality I I hope if you don't have a
[52:35] revelation of that song I hope you get
[52:37] it tonight that God's the one holding
[52:39] you tonight that's right Hallelujah
[52:42] you're not holding yourself I'm not
[52:44] holding you your dad's not holding you
[52:46] your mom's not holding you Christ is
[52:48] holding

[52:53] somebody here tonight by God's grace
[52:55] Hallelujah
[52:58] he said I I quit that a long time ago oh
[53:00] if I can just hold on if I can just be a
[53:03] good enough message believer if I can
[53:04] just be good enough if I can just not
[53:07] fall
[53:08] away God's holding me God go God's G to
[53:11] keep me from falling
[53:14] away Hallelujah someone said when I was
[53:17] sick that time I got over it said
[53:18] brother Ram did you keep your religion
[53:19] during that six spell I said no sir it
[53:22] kept me that's the difference and that's
[53:25] what happened
[53:27] something keeps holding me I'm just at
[53:29] about time to quit let me see how much I
[53:32] got here how enjoying the word of God
[53:35] tonight glory to
[53:38] God yeah I think
[53:41] uh yeah I'll close with this here okay
[53:43] let's go to chapter two I'll just read a
[53:45] few verses here we'll just read verses
[53:47] one two and three and then we'll
[53:50] stop I've been trying to go to bed
[53:52] earlier too and not not go so
[53:55] late like the biggest trial of my life
[53:58] verse one and I Brethren when I came to
[54:01] you came not with exen of speech or of
[54:05] wisdom declaring unto you the testimony
[54:07] of God now that's currently what was
[54:09] happening in the church they had the
[54:11] most excellent speakers they never
[54:14] stuttered and spit like I do they never
[54:15] forgot things like I do they never had
[54:17] to ask the congregation for a help with
[54:20] a a scripture the Corinthians had the
[54:23] most eloquent teachers the most eloquent
[54:26] I'm sorry eloquent I can't even say it
[54:28] eloquent it just shows how little I'm
[54:31] nothing the most eloquent
[54:34] preachers Paul didn't come like
[54:36] that church you got to watch when a
[54:39] preacher comes so polished you got to
[54:41] watch that
[54:42] preacher because sometimes he's more
[54:45] focused on his on his presentation than
[54:48] on preaching the word of God the real
[54:50] question is is he getting sin out of
[54:52] your life and making the holy ghost or
[54:54] allowing the Holy Ghost to move through
[54:55] your life more amen that's the real
[54:58] difference
[55:00] amen I've seen since I've been the
[55:02] message of brother Mercy uh since
[55:04] Naomi's raised in the message since I've
[55:06] in the message I see many preachers that
[55:08] could preach the house down every
[55:10] Service never stud they could remember
[55:12] every verse and I've seen them walk away
[55:16] with either sexual sin or Pride or money
[55:19] or something and I was like I thought
[55:22] this guy was an angel I thought this guy
[55:24] was untouchable but Church God's going
[55:27] to allow all of us to go through the
[55:29] fires of
[55:31] tests all gold must go through the fire
[55:33] how many know
[55:35] that the Bible said every man's work
[55:37] think of that sisters your works are
[55:39] going to go through the fire brother Rod
[55:41] your works are going to go through the
[55:43] fire and the Bible said whatever works
[55:46] come out and make it through the fire
[55:48] that's the reward you'll
[55:50] get my Works what I did in my life is
[55:54] going to be tested by fire just Smith's
[55:56] attitude what he did with his finances
[55:59] uh what he preached it's going to go
[56:01] through the fires of God's testing and
[56:03] if anything comes out I get rewarded now
[56:05] the Bible said there's going to be some
[56:07] people he says it in chapter three all
[56:09] their Works going to be burned up yet
[56:11] they're still saved think of
[56:13] that living your whole life as a
[56:16] Believer going to church but it you got
[56:19] no reward out of it right that's like
[56:22] lot lot is the best example because look
[56:24] all of his possessions got burned in the
[56:26] fire in
[56:28] Sodom right but he himself was
[56:31] saved think about that they spent he
[56:34] spent decades in Sodom making money he
[56:36] was a judge in the in the gates he was a
[56:39] judge he was an elder
[56:42] respected he had family and and
[56:44] son-in-laws and daughters uh daughters
[56:47] and some of them died in the fire his
[56:48] wife turned into a pillar of of
[56:51] salt so that means his Works were not
[56:54] really
[56:54] sincere but yet he was
[56:57] saved so church this is the question who
[56:59] are you living for what works are you
[57:02] trying to do that's the question lot's
[57:05] works really weren't about God they were
[57:08] just about his Natural
[57:10] Life why are you working so hard for
[57:14] what right why was Lot working so hard
[57:17] it was just for himself it wasn't for
[57:20] other people does ever understand that
[57:24] so all his think of all think of his 40
[57:26] hour weeks think of his 40 all of his 40
[57:28] hour weeks got no reward in heaven
[57:30] because it wasn't for other people it
[57:32] was only for
[57:33] himself that's why it's important that
[57:35] we give to
[57:37] others hallelujah amen that's why it's
[57:40] important that we separate from the
[57:42] things of the world because he never
[57:43] separated from
[57:45] Sodom fully does every understand what
[57:47] I'm
[57:48] saying Glory when my life goes to the
[57:52] fire I want I want there to be lots of
[57:54] things that come out by the gra God's
[57:56] grace that pass the the the fiery test
[57:59] of God that I lived a clean Life I Lived
[58:02] the right kind of life my motive was to
[58:04] glorify Christ and not to glorify
[58:09] myself glory to
[58:11] God so Paul wasn't coming to impress
[58:14] them with their his
[58:16] speeches
[58:18] Hallelujah for I determined not to know
[58:20] anything among you say Jesus Christ and
[58:22] him Cru why did he have to do that
[58:24] because they were they had all the
[58:26] Revelations they had all the gifts
[58:27] Church they had all the tongues all the
[58:29] prophets they had all these spiritual
[58:31] things I dreamed that I saw that I spoke
[58:34] that all these spiritual things so Paul
[58:36] said I'm just knowing Christ and him
[58:38] crucified because they had all these
[58:40] gifts but had all this sin in the church
[58:43] as
[58:44] well so Paul purposely had to be plain
[58:47] and simple because they were so caught
[58:49] up and Revelations they could receive
[58:52] but then also sin on the side and not
[58:55] kick the sin out of the church thank God
[58:58] When sin gets dealt with thank God for
[59:00] sending uh the preachers here that
[59:02] preach against
[59:04] sin amen hallelujah am remember it don't
[59:07] profit you nothing unless you got the
[59:09] love of God and what do God what does
[59:12] the love of God do it hates iniquity it
[59:13] loves the
[59:15] truth right so Paul said man with all
[59:18] these gifts with all this big church and
[59:20] and and all the tongues and all the
[59:22] interpretation all the prophecy all the
[59:23] Revelation he said I only want to know
[59:25] Christ Christ and him
[59:29] crucified and he said when I was among
[59:31] you I was among you in weakness and in
[59:33] the fear of the Lord right AA fear of
[59:35] the Lord not a
[59:37] partial this is the true fear of the
[59:40] Lord the fear of the Lord is to what
[59:42] hate evil and depart from
[59:45] Evil right don't go there on your phone
[59:48] anymore and the church said or get rid
[59:51] of your phone whatever you have to do to
[59:52] avoid evil depart from evil amen
[59:57] hallelujah have fear of the
[1:00:00] Lord and in much trembling so he was
[1:00:02] constantly trembling about God's
[1:00:04] presence and and the word of God and
[1:00:06] living a holy
[1:00:07] life because these people had gifts they
[1:00:10] had they had experiences but they
[1:00:12] allowed sin to grow up in the
[1:00:15] church okay everybody understand I'm
[1:00:17] trying to close here I didn't I didn't
[1:00:19] know how long I'd get like I told you so
[1:00:22] in an immature church with so many gifts
[1:00:25] operating a miss all this leaven Paul
[1:00:27] had to Humble himself in order to stand
[1:00:29] out to the
[1:00:32] elect so Paul didn't come into the
[1:00:34] church like everybody else oh thus say
[1:00:36] the Lord this and remember he said he's
[1:00:38] spoken tongues more than everybody but
[1:00:40] when he came to church the Chan church
[1:00:42] he didn't speak in tongues so much
[1:00:43] because that's everybody was doing
[1:00:45] that he wanted to correct them so they
[1:00:48] live the right kind of
[1:00:50] Life hallelujah how many want to live
[1:00:52] the right kind of life oh God help us
[1:00:55] amen God help help us especially while
[1:00:57] you're young right that's what David
[1:00:59] said how does a young man keep his way
[1:01:02] pure by taking heed according to Thy
[1:01:05] word or young women or young
[1:01:08] teenagers how does a young lady keep her
[1:01:10] way pure by taking heed obeying the word
[1:01:14] of God honoring and fearing
[1:01:17] God hallelujah I'm trying to close I
[1:01:19] only got a couple more quotes I got two
[1:01:21] more slides here oh you think I know a
[1:01:24] whole lot yeah you get your brain all
[1:01:26] worked up and it can't even work itself
[1:01:27] anybody ever feel that way sometimes you
[1:01:29] get your brain so worked up you can't
[1:01:31] even it it doesn't help you
[1:01:33] out you know all the books all the
[1:01:36] answers all the Greek all the Hebrew
[1:01:38] till it ain't got no place for the dove
[1:01:40] to roost now he's talking about a humble
[1:01:43] Christian Life in this quote just being
[1:01:46] a humble Christian he's going to say it
[1:01:47] later not being arguing with people not
[1:01:50] having a temper not gossiping all he's
[1:01:52] going to say it in a little bit here in
[1:01:55] other words watch ing the words that
[1:01:56] come out of our
[1:01:58] mouths oh but you know it
[1:02:00] all he says then the dove can't lead
[1:02:03] because you know too much think about
[1:02:05] that church God can't lead us if we know
[1:02:08] everything we have to say God I don't
[1:02:11] know everything lead
[1:02:14] me the lamb don't claim to know
[1:02:18] nothing did you have Lambs Elijah do you
[1:02:20] guys have sheep or just goats goats I
[1:02:22] remember I remember out there you had
[1:02:23] goats there but
[1:02:26] he don't claim to know anything it's got
[1:02:29] to have somebody else to lead it Glory
[1:02:32] that's it don't know nothing amen the
[1:02:34] only thing I know is Jesus Christ died
[1:02:36] to save me this is what brother R says
[1:02:39] this is after this is 1956 after the
[1:02:41] pillar of fire picture
[1:02:43] 1950 right he's already gone to Bombay
[1:02:45] India uh and seen uh 500,000 in in a a
[1:02:49] series of meetings there he's uh he's
[1:02:51] seen the the blind eyes open and he said
[1:02:53] I don't know anything except Christ died
[1:02:56] to save me that's a real humble prophet
[1:02:59] of God right
[1:03:01] there he says come back to being a lamb
[1:03:05] come back to be gentle come back to know
[1:03:07] nothing come back to just submit
[1:03:10] yourself to Christ remember the
[1:03:11] Corinthian Church they were they were so
[1:03:13] angry they were going to sue each other
[1:03:16] oh brother Mercy I'm taking you to court
[1:03:20] tomorrow they were so angry oh I'm
[1:03:22] better than you because my preacher is
[1:03:24] this guy
[1:03:26] I'm more spiritual because I this person
[1:03:28] baptized me Paul said I'm glad I
[1:03:29] baptized nobody but christas and
[1:03:32] gas worried about who you're baptized by
[1:03:35] you got to you got to remember who died
[1:03:37] for you so you could be baptized
[1:03:39] Hallelujah remember Christ
[1:03:43] Hallelujah he says come back just submit
[1:03:46] yourself to Christ don't try don't try
[1:03:48] to know nothing just walk meekly quietly
[1:03:50] humbly gently and the dove will lead you
[1:03:53] oh I want to be led by the dove
[1:03:56] but what where whenever you go listening
[1:03:58] to that gossip whenever you go to
[1:04:00] getting that temper up whenever you go
[1:04:02] to thinking you got a right to do this
[1:04:03] or that the dove just takes her flight
[1:04:06] and goes away she flies
[1:04:08] away then you don't have that now it's
[1:04:10] the anointing on the mind now not the
[1:04:12] soul you can't lose the anointing on the
[1:04:15] soul brother's talking about the
[1:04:18] mind if we argue fuss temper gossip the
[1:04:23] anointing leaves us and we won't think
[1:04:25] about God
