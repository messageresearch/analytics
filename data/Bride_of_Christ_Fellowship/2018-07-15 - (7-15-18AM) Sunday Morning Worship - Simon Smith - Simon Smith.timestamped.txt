[37:21] of God praise the Lord God Almighty for
[37:25] that hey man I don't want to be a
[37:27] hindrance or rebuke to anyone mighty
[37:30] John Graham
[37:31] good to see you soldiers amen where
[37:33] we're gonna set up by God's grace I have
[37:37] a little PowerPoint one of the things I
[37:42] shared over in Thailand when I was there
[37:44] um two weeks ago probably the longest
[37:48] trip I've taken is about two and a half
[37:50] weeks and saints of God there's so much
[37:54] work to be done in these fields where
[38:00] the harvester is where the laborers
[38:02] please keep me in prayer I'm praying now
[38:06] and believing maybe a little had me go
[38:09] for a couple months at a time over there
[38:12] will suit the Lord leads what he'll
[38:15] allow financially even though it's 33
[38:19] baht to one dollar but travel places to
[38:24] stay food you got to take care of the
[38:26] interpret it's very expensive not really
[38:31] too bad but it's expensive for about two
[38:36] and a half weeks there I spent about
[38:38] $1,500 just cash just getting train
[38:42] rides of Chiang Mai you know train ride
[38:45] back we had to pay for gas we didn't
[38:48] even rent a car
[38:50] some of the Saints that have that took
[38:53] us into their house or not really into
[38:55] their house but we fellowship with they
[38:57] paid our meals many times so we able to
[39:00] save on that but one thing for certain
[39:03] Saints we ran into a lot of people who
[39:07] are unbelievers but if you just love on
[39:10] them show that you're concerned about
[39:13] them that you're here to help that makes
[39:16] the world a difference I'd won over
[39:18] quite a few that over in Chiangmai three
[39:20] or four that men older men that said
[39:23] please Simon don't leave me because I
[39:25] like being around you if you make me
[39:27] happy
[39:29] you know but it's just the love of
[39:31] Christ it's not me but it is him pushing
[39:34] out of us to love others too to display
[39:37] the care I ran into one man his name is
[39:42] brother lek he's 68 years
[39:44] I'm sorry 78 years old he came back he
[39:47] was in San Francisco for many years and
[39:50] he run big businessman very shrewd he
[39:53] told me some of the stories you know how
[39:54] to make money you know how to undercut
[39:56] the other with the little guy or the it
[39:57] was the big guy he's very sharp in
[40:00] business and he said Simon he goes when
[40:03] I was younger he said I thought money
[40:04] could buy anything happiness and this
[40:07] than that and then 17 years ago his the
[40:10] Lord took his wife and he had small
[40:14] children at the time and he battled it
[40:16] tremendously with that he started
[40:18] realizing the money really didn't mean a
[40:19] whole lot and after two days I'd pretty
[40:26] much want him to at least the love and
[40:29] fellowship and his and he went over to
[40:30] the kitchen and he took a little knife
[40:32] he said Simon he's take this knife he
[40:33] says cut me right here he says and fix
[40:36] my heart right now he said you're right
[40:38] now and he was not playing games he says
[40:41] please fix this I said brother leg I
[40:43] said it's a spiritual thing he said
[40:46] let's pretend he's a Simon he says
[40:47] forget he can he's a bonus he says
[40:49] forget Buddha he failed forget Jesus he
[40:50] says how do I fix this
[40:52] I said it's impossible I said let me
[40:54] give you example brother luck he's okay
[40:57] I said let's pretend were strangers in a
[40:59] foreign land and in the bush in the
[41:01] swamps and the rainforests I said and we
[41:04] stumble upon a tribe of people that have
[41:07] never been discovered before that have
[41:09] never had communication with the outside
[41:11] world or modern man I said and let's say
[41:14] we make friends with due to your smile
[41:16] or whatever charisma or the grace of God
[41:19] upon us they don't eat us alive
[41:20] I said let's say we were able to spend
[41:22] one week with him he said yeah I said I
[41:25] guarantee you brother link they worship
[41:28] something and he changed the subject
[41:32] right away because he was getting to the
[41:35] point they say that within every man and
[41:37] woman's heart there's there is a desire
[41:39] to worship some thing I said brother
[41:44] like where does that come from I said
[41:49] the only one that can fix your heart is
[41:50] Jesus Christ because that's what fixed
[41:52] my heart that is it amen
[41:58] so we had many successes without waiting
[42:02] it to preach as many churches but one on
[42:04] one we did just as much only two or
[42:07] three of the days there
[42:09] did we not so see don't say it like that
[42:11] so by the grace of God we did our best
[42:15] keeping keeping prayer the the last day
[42:24] were there I did get to meet with the I
[42:28] got to meet with one of the heads of the
[42:31] Full Gospel businessmen and from
[42:36] Thailand and he said brother Simon you
[42:38] know brother Randy actually got to come
[42:39] with me this time so was a real blessing
[42:41] people were blown away by his voice they
[42:44] might understand a word he said but man
[42:45] his voice is like angel food to them
[42:48] many invites to come back to have
[42:50] concerts she's had so we're gonna see
[42:52] what's happened there we'll use those
[42:54] concerts strategically by having a
[42:57] little maybe mystery Expo afterwards and
[43:01] use his voice use him as bait to get him
[43:03] to the hook so keep us in prayer brother
[43:07] Randy he wasn't he was a little nervous
[43:12] their first four days and he was ready
[43:14] to go but now he's ready to go back
[43:18] join into the battles so the last day we
[43:23] met with one of the Full Gospel
[43:24] businessmen and he said brother Simon
[43:29] now tell me your mission for Thailand
[43:30] what's the problems here you see I mean
[43:32] why you even here I said first of all I
[43:34] said these and I was just pretty blunt
[43:35] with them I don't care it's my last day
[43:36] the rapture get took place the very next
[43:39] day or on the plane you know I said
[43:41] first of all I said these these uh
[43:42] Thailand Christians are taught just milk
[43:45] if that I said they all say no it was
[43:48] grace and love your brother and just do
[43:50] right that's it he's like what do you
[43:52] mean I said well I started I said I said
[43:53] broke down in Hebrews five and six
[43:55] showing how that anyone that uses milk
[43:57] is unskillful with the word of God he's
[43:59] what it takes the meat of the word he
[44:00] says for the full aged he's like okay
[44:03] and I started working with the the table
[44:05] of shewbread and how there's 12 loaves
[44:07] and I said I said in the New Testament
[44:08] there's 12 there's 12 mysteries and he's
[44:10] like he was blown away and once we
[44:13] started hitting that and then I had his
[44:14] full attention and I said you want me to
[44:16] break down one of those mysteries he's
[44:18] like yes and I started the Lord led me
[44:20] right to Romans
[44:22] I'm sorry revelation 17 18 just by just
[44:26] by just off the top your head you break
[44:28] down these mysteries who the great
[44:30] is and he was just like Simon that's
[44:32] exactly what we need to know he said he
[44:35] says in Thailand in the government in
[44:37] the in the laws Christianity and the
[44:39] Catholic Church are one in the same
[44:41] there is no difference so they're
[44:44] thought of is exactly the same he said
[44:46] now well he goes now what about the ho
[44:47] Jehovah's Witnesses I said they're
[44:48] totally Antichrist he goes no show me
[44:51] show me show me like I taught the last
[44:53] time I was here I said show me salvation
[44:55] in the name is your hope there is no
[44:57] salvation in name of Jehovah none if you
[44:59] look at the set the seven compound
[45:00] redemptive name is Jehovah salvation is
[45:03] not included in Jehovah and that's why
[45:06] there had to be a name upgrade to what
[45:09] Jesus Christ right Jehovah save you
[45:11] because they'll say very salvation is
[45:14] now broken down and he just going he had
[45:16] never heard these things you know things
[45:17] that we take for common in a secondhand
[45:21] or how we want to say it things we take
[45:23] for granted and by the end of that he's
[45:26] a Simon he goes I see your full desire
[45:29] and I understand he goes these are
[45:31] as my people need to hear these
[45:32] mysteries he says I'm connected with the
[45:34] three biggest churches in Thailand
[45:36] he says thousands of people he's and I
[45:38] want aligned you up brother Randy I said
[45:40] brother Randy Singh I made him sing
[45:41] every time I said I'm running the show
[45:45] here your city and my you know about
[45:49] halfway three humbled himself I said I
[45:51] started calling them gifts and I started
[45:53] I said these are not gifts my said
[45:54] brother these are weapons I said use
[45:56] your weapon that harp the david was a
[46:00] weapon it ran them demons off song i
[46:03] said use your weapon and he's saying and
[46:06] that full gospel businessman sat on his
[46:08] chair like this and he belt that he did
[46:10] knelt down like this and by the time
[46:12] brother Randy was done he come up and he
[46:14] was crying and he said he says I'll give
[46:17] you a full support he said just let me
[46:20] know when you come back so we need to
[46:22] come back as soon as possible
[46:24] I did meet up with three of those four
[46:27] from the last trip and it happened to be
[46:30] on the last day as well because the one
[46:32] sister did not come back from or is like

[46:40] grace of God let me come back to see her

[47:18] forerunners to brother Ron he's going
[47:20] next Friday for ten days hopefully we

[47:28] brother Randy preach and sing that night
[47:29] and the pastor is sitting there but
[47:32] Randy doesn't what are we hitting
[47:33] reading baptism we're getting people to
[47:35] the promised Holy Ghost and the pastor
[47:37] he's a Baptist minister he goes and his

[47:58] feeding araignee scriptures I said
[47:59] Romans six and then once he hit Romans
[48:01] six he says it was over he said when how
[48:03] do I get rebaptised I said brother wait
[48:05] just a couple weeks we got a minister
[48:07] coming from Canada to come so there is a
[48:09] pastor in his flock he says he's gonna
[48:11] be baptized everybody in Shanghai so
[48:14] we're doing our best it's just a lot of
[48:16] time you need you first of all you have
[48:19] to have a very very good interpreter and
[48:20] we had the best sister Esther one of the
[48:22] few only Thai believers of the message
[48:26] and I told her I'll try to kidnap her
[48:28] when we get but go back in August her
[48:32] daughter
[48:32] we did get to meet with her daughter do
[48:34] many Bible stays with her and her and
[48:36] her daughter's name is mint and mints
[48:39] father we got to meet him and do Bible
[48:42] stays with him
[48:42] and if we just if you just love people
[48:45] Saints put them first in every action
[48:48] open the doors for him do everything you
[48:50] can form by the grace of God just those
[48:52] natural things win them over he paid for
[48:54] every one of our suppers every one of
[48:55] our lunches by the grace of God yes for
[49:01] last about God you wanted to understand
[49:03] God who is Jesus who's the foul or he
[49:05] wanted to know those things we taught
[49:07] the best we could
[49:07] made him clear as simple as we could so
[49:10] anyhow let's get on to what we have for
[49:13] this morning I did teach this in
[49:15] Thailand many times because a lot of
[49:18] times the BIOS doesn't make in the book
[49:22] of Judah says sometimes you got to make
[49:24] a difference and then sometimes you got
[49:26] saving by fear so I tried to hit him a
[49:29] little bit with fear when we did get to
[49:31] office to services offered I had brother
[49:33] Randy preach first and then he usually
[49:35] had baptism or the Holy Ghost whatever
[49:37] and then I came with this so we're
[49:38] trying to win we're trying to do you're
[49:40] just trying to move the people somehow
[49:41] emotionally do something to strike their
[49:43] souls by the grace of God keep my wife
[49:47] in prayer I sent her on a vacation while
[49:51] I was gone to kind of keep her mind off
[49:53] things and either a little bit than the
[49:56] very last day the devil attacked and she
[49:57] fell in the shower and kind
[49:59] little hurt her neck pretty bad so we've
[50:02] been battling that by the grace of God
[50:03] so keep her in prayer turn to Matthew 24
[50:06] verse 1 this might be some review but at
[50:10] the end I want to hit some prophecies
[50:12] things showing just how very close we
[50:14] are Matthew 24 verse 1 says then Jesus
[50:27] went out and departed from the temple
[50:29] and his disciples came to him for to
[50:30] shew him the buildings of the temple and
[50:33] Jesus said unto them see ye not all
[50:35] these things really saying to you there
[50:37] shall not be left here one stone upon
[50:39] another that shall not be thrown down
[50:41] verse 3 and he said upon the Mount of
[50:44] Olives and the disciples came and him
[50:45] privately saying tell us when shall
[50:48] these things be and what shall be the
[50:51] sign of thy coming and of the end of the
[50:55] world yes and verse 4 and Jesus answers
[50:59] and take heed that no man deceive us a
[51:01] word of Prayer
[51:02] our hands Deerling father Lord Jesus we
[51:06] just love you Lord every time get called
[51:11] to this little pulpit here Lord we feel
[51:13] humble err and tinier and tinier Lord
[51:15] and know just we just want to yield to
[51:17] your folia so just being this little
[51:19] study here that would be a blessing to
[51:21] the people god it may be may we always
[51:25] refocus every day God maybe refocus
[51:27] every time we come to the house of God
[51:29] Lord and our prayer closets and our
[51:31] lives Lord checking up our lean Lord
[51:33] minute lead or God ready for your coming
[51:35] Lord we want to be watching and waiting
[51:37] for please help us so we love you so
[51:39] much Lord bless us so study bless every
[51:41] soul to push their way out Lord in the
[51:43] name of Jesus Christ amen
[51:44] have your seats
[51:53] the way the Shanghai we took the night
[51:56] train and if I had to make a little
[51:58] remark the night train is the right
[52:01] train okay if you ever go to Chiang Mai
[52:04] from Bangkok go on the night train it is
[52:08] a beautiful ride but we're able to let
[52:12] me tell you something Saints the Word of
[52:13] God is still continually opening yes Oh
[52:16] sister Esther had brought in one of her
[52:19] friend's sister pawn and she was really
[52:22] enjoyed the teachings she's even started
[52:24] letting her hair grow now and she's
[52:26] wearing dress holy sister mint has let
[52:28] her hair fully grown and she's wearing
[52:30] dresses full time now he's playing
[52:34] tennis if she's coming but as we did the
[52:39] study their sister pawn wanted a Bible
[52:42] study on the my night train so on night
[52:44] train right before we go to sleep we we
[52:46] did a lot of libel study with her and I
[52:47] did Mount Transfiguration study you may
[52:49] have been through it many times but even
[52:52] that opened up again
[52:54] to us in second Peter 1 it talks about
[52:58] how st. Peter said he says bless you
[53:01] sister st. Peter said he said he says
[53:03] and we were made eyewitnesses of his
[53:05] majesty he says and he revealed what his
[53:08] power and his coming right and we can
[53:12] show you the coming it's 7 Jesus weight
[53:15] in 7 days and about the eighth day right
[53:19] he took them up in the high mountain Amy
[53:21] was transfigured right and the thought
[53:23] was always in the back of my mind I
[53:25] never even said it out loud I just
[53:26] thought here there but what is his power
[53:30] what is his power because Jesus cuz
[53:34] Peter said he's as Jesus revealed his
[53:35] power and his coming what is the power
[53:38] and then it opened up right there on the
[53:40] train sister Esther was going brother
[53:43] and he's like that's very good if you
[53:46] look at Romans 10 at the time of his
[53:51] descending as the seven thunders uttered
[53:54] their voices yes and we're to eat the
[53:58] book once again the very next chapter
[54:01] after the head in revelations 11 it says
[54:04] Jesus said while he says and I will give
[54:06] power
[54:07] or he says to my two witnesses and I'm
[54:12] out Transfiguration Moses and Elijah
[54:14] were both the writers day and he said
[54:18] I'll give them power he says too true to
[54:21] the strike and plagues upon the earth to
[54:23] turn the water into blood all these
[54:25] things right there and now we opened up
[54:27] things continually opening you know
[54:29] opening and opening more revelation this
[54:32] is so solid the stress was going I said
[54:39] this was not for me this was for you
[54:42] this was fresh on the spot on the night
[54:44] train reeling what that power
[54:46] represented the power will be with the
[54:49] two prophets Moses and Elijah oh praise
[54:52] be to God I want to share that nugget
[54:55] with you so you got back up now you can
[54:58] teach that thing prove everything is
[55:00] proven it's just totally perfect there
[55:02] was no doubts anymore no doubts long
[55:05] gone this morning if I could teach on
[55:08] something it would be on God's time
[55:10] peace by His grace if I can get this
[55:13] little thing here we go looking at the
[55:15] timepiece we want to deal with God's
[55:17] timepiece right we know God's timepieces
[55:19] but we're gonna deal with a couple of
[55:21] prophecies we're gonna show you some
[55:22] things by the grace of God most of it
[55:24] maybe review some things but we want to
[55:26] reiterate this continually we want to
[55:28] show the coming of the Lord how close
[55:31] are we Saints we want to be sure on
[55:33] these things now here in Matthew 24
[55:36] verse 36 just down the way from we
[55:38] started what shall be the sign of his
[55:40] coming when shall these things be and
[55:41] the end of the world right we're at the
[55:43] very end Jesus says in verse 36 he says
[55:45] one of the day and the hour knoweth no
[55:47] man he says no not the angels of heaven
[55:50] he says but my father only
[55:52] right when the coming of the Lord is
[55:53] what is the day of the hour we don't
[55:55] know right he says in Matthew 24 verse
[55:58] 42 he says watch therefore he says for
[56:01] you know not what hour your Lord does
[56:03] come this is a warning 2000 years ago
[56:08] how close are we to the coming of the
[56:10] Lord you know in Thailand they're the
[56:14] ones who actually originated almost i
[56:16] from what they are saying the
[56:18] transgender movement
[56:21] over 15 percent of the population now
[56:23] are moving there we went to a restaurant
[56:26] the Mint's Dan took us to a very nice
[56:29] restaurant and I walked in and there was
[56:31] all these girls listen and I said but
[56:33] lon and the girl said hello with a deep
[56:38] voice and I go what sure enough it was a
[56:41] man you look at the hands the hands
[56:42] hands don't lie they call them ladyboys
[56:48] so shall it be in the days of the coming
[56:51] of the Son of Man it shall be like what
[56:53] last day
[56:54] this is beyond that oh my goodness we're
[56:59] seeing stuff they can only imagine about
[57:01] watch therefore for you know not why
[57:03] your hour doesn't come right now here in
[57:09] Matthew 25 after what the parable the
[57:12] wise and foolish virgin he says watch
[57:14] therefore you know not neither did the
[57:16] day nor the hour and the son of man
[57:17] cometh then a Luke 12 verse 46 the land
[57:21] of that servant will come in a day when
[57:23] he looketh not for him in an hour when
[57:26] he's not aware he says and will cut him
[57:27] asunder and will put and they will
[57:29] appoint him his portion with the
[57:32] unbelievers even though this is a
[57:35] believer this is foolish virgin this is
[57:39] the one that gave a couple of waters for
[57:41] the bride oh my he says and he will be
[57:43] with the porter his portion will be with
[57:45] what the unbelievers if we miss this
[57:48] rapture what will these unbelievers will
[57:53] have every demon on them every lust of
[57:56] the flesh every evil desire will be
[57:58] performed through these unbelievers and
[58:00] here's a foolish version we caught right
[58:02] in the mixed killed tortured
[58:05] they'll have to be a martyrs because
[58:07] they rejected the blood of Jesus Christ
[58:09] and ought to shed their own blood yes
[58:12] doesn't look like much hope we don't
[58:14] know when the coming is when is is
[58:15] coming how close are we to the rapture
[58:17] but rest assured st. Paul the first
[58:20] church a messenger says peace is but in
[58:22] times and season brethren you have no
[58:23] need that I write unto you for
[58:25] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[58:27] and the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[58:29] night my goodness he says because we
[58:32] don't know when but
[58:33] he brings us some reassurance he says
[58:36] but ye brethren are not in darkness hey
[58:40] man he says that the day should overtake
[58:42] you as a thief he says ye are the
[58:45] children of light a man praising to God
[58:48] he's in the children of the day he says
[58:50] we are not of the night nor of the
[58:52] darkness therefore let us not sleep as
[58:54] other news but let us be watches and be
[58:57] sober saints of God the coaming of the
[59:01] Lord he says we will know that season
[59:04] absolutely why because we're not in
[59:06] darkness no sir
[59:09] we are in the light not only do the wise
[59:11] virgins have left but they have oil in
[59:13] their vessels as well amen
[59:15] they're packing everything they need and
[59:17] when the food's worse as lamps go out
[59:19] now they'll be in darkness and they'll
[59:24] be kind of thunder with the unbelievers
[59:28] God's timepiece what does God's
[59:32] timepiece we know these things right
[59:34] we're we've been in this word for a long
[59:36] time amen
[59:40] Israel is God's timepiece he says if you
[59:43] don't want to know what time it is on
[59:45] God's prophetic time schedule he says
[59:48] just keep your eyes on Israel and we are
[59:53] one of the few generations that actually
[59:56] hasn't been able to watch them right now
[59:59] we'll run through some things by God's
[1:00:00] grace I don't want to keep you too long
[1:00:01] this morning we have seconds service and
[1:00:04] Deuteronomy 4 verse 37 he says and me
[1:00:08] and because he loved thy father's
[1:00:10] therefore he chose their seed after them
[1:00:14] as choosing Israel's a church nation a
[1:00:16] national church an entire nation that
[1:00:19] what is actually a church I can't even
[1:00:22] imagine what they'd be like where
[1:00:23] everyone's religious everyone loves God
[1:00:26] it's just it's just a big group of as a
[1:00:28] big church house you see my cousin my
[1:00:32] brothers oh they are in the church
[1:00:34] because what we're Israelites we're
[1:00:36] believers amen but notice how he might
[1:00:39] he chose those people he because he
[1:00:41] loved my father's oh my Abraham was a
[1:00:45] gold nugget absolutely the SIL
[1:00:47] dollar right he says Jacob and Isaac
[1:00:49] he's they were golden to God absolutely
[1:00:51] love them with all their hearts he
[1:00:53] promised him everything he promised in
[1:00:57] her father's all all the entire world
[1:01:00] that be inheritance of everything
[1:01:02] absolutely everything he promised them
[1:01:05] Abraham took and he received it he was
[1:01:07] the Bible says he's still not at the
[1:01:09] promise of God a man that's right surely
[1:01:12] now look in Deuteronomy 7 verse 6 he
[1:01:15] says for the hour a holy people and the
[1:01:16] LORD thy God the LORD thy God hath
[1:01:18] chosen to be a special people unto
[1:01:21] himself why because they came out of
[1:01:24] Abraham they came out of Isaac they came
[1:01:26] out of Jacob absolutely he's in the Lord
[1:01:28] did not set upon his love upon no chose
[1:01:31] you because you were more in number than
[1:01:32] any people absolutely he did not choose
[1:01:34] us in this message because we're a great
[1:01:37] number because but because he loved
[1:01:41] Peter James and John and Peter James
[1:01:45] those twelve disciples with Paul
[1:01:47] included why did why did he love us
[1:01:49] because he loved our fathers first he
[1:01:52] promised them everything actually why
[1:01:54] because they when they were chosen to
[1:01:56] salvation by what sanctification of the
[1:01:58] Spirit and belief of the truth a man
[1:02:01] coming here believing the truth this
[1:02:03] morning I absolutely I know I do and I
[1:02:05] know you do absolutely that's why he
[1:02:06] chose you and when he's gonna turn our
[1:02:09] heart slowly back to the Father he's
[1:02:13] gonna do it he said he would he says
[1:02:16] even not chose you because you're a more
[1:02:17] number he says for you were the fewest
[1:02:19] of all the people he says and because
[1:02:22] I'm layin London because he would keep
[1:02:24] the oath that he swore on to your
[1:02:26] father's a and the Bible said in acts
[1:02:30] like an axe treason oh the time of
[1:02:33] restitution amen is where the time of
[1:02:36] restoration he said he would restore

[1:02:46] his word amen praise be to God
[1:02:49] absolutely he's faithful he's wonderful
[1:02:52] only the Lord had to lie to my father's
[1:02:54] to love them and he chose their seed
[1:02:57] after them

[1:03:01] now that was the natural seed saints of
[1:03:03] God and the seed that Jesus Christ is
[1:03:05] looking for now is seen if that
[1:03:07] incorruptible seed which is the baptism
[1:03:10] of the Holy Ghost where he places
[1:03:11] himself inside of you and you and you
[1:03:14] and you and you and he sees that see
[1:03:16] then he knows that's the sea that we

[1:03:28] amen absolutely chose Israel the nation
[1:03:35] but at that time when he chose Israel
[1:03:39] their nation
[1:03:41] he was also forced foreshadowing for
[1:03:45] seeing Jesus and the scripture
[1:03:47] foreseeing that God would justify the
[1:03:49] heathen it's not going to be a one
[1:03:51] Church move saints of God they had many
[1:03:53] many more seat of God out there amen

[1:04:47] praying so that's what we can do
[1:04:50] amen he says I the LORD have called the
[1:04:54] righteous and will hold thine hand and
[1:04:56] will keep thee and give thee for coming
[1:04:57] on to the people for light of the
[1:04:59] Gentiles absolutely where the light
[1:05:02] where would the light strike first what
[1:05:03] in Israel he says and the Gentiles shall
[1:05:08] come to thy light us he
[1:05:14] clubs are our backs killing maiming no
[1:05:18] law total heathen if we're not Jesse my
[1:05:24] brother Jesse could have been an Apache
[1:05:26] warrior catching deer barehanded had God
[1:05:36] not had this the time we'd be natives
[1:05:38] over here for sure I don't know what
[1:05:43] I'll be but didn't have brothers be the
[1:05:44] older little guy that just jest he gave
[1:05:46] me some food today's like cheer brother
[1:05:49] amen
[1:05:50] sure we count on people like that sure
[1:05:52] but notice he says now he says in John
[1:05:54] 1:11 he came unto his own and his own
[1:05:56] received him not
[1:05:57] oh my goodness what Jesus Christ the
[1:06:00] Messiah the the the great prophet he
[1:06:03] came what to jerk Jerusalem he came to
[1:06:06] the Jews first and when they were coming
[1:06:10] when they were there for were come
[1:06:12] together they asked him saying Lord wilt
[1:06:14] thou at this time restore again the
[1:06:16] kingdom to Israel wasn't time yet he
[1:06:23] says not for you to know the times of
[1:06:25] the season which the father has put in
[1:06:26] his own power right
[1:06:29] but first God came to Israel first right
[1:06:33] in Matthew 10 verse 5 in the in the
[1:06:38] twenties twelve Jesus sent forth command
[1:06:41] go not into the way of the Gentiles
[1:06:44] it wasn't our time yet the first coming
[1:06:46] of Jesus Christ was not to us but it was
[1:06:51] he says in engineering city of the
[1:06:54] Samaritans
[1:06:54] arrey not but go rather to the lost
[1:06:56] sheep of the house of Israel a man it
[1:07:01] was to Israel first and Israel own why
[1:07:04] because he loved the father's Amen now
[1:07:08] in Matthew 15 verse 24 everybody
[1:07:11] answered said I am NOT sent but to the
[1:07:13] lost sheep of the house of Israel right
[1:07:16] the first coming the Messiah came to
[1:07:18] save his own and his own received in
[1:07:20] that when the saddest stories
[1:07:25] now look at this a period in a comma now
[1:07:32] notice what they look at what the
[1:07:33] definitions of comma one of the places
[1:07:35] they use a comma for a punctuation mark
[1:07:38] indicating a pause
[1:07:40] indicating a pause between the parts of
[1:07:42] a sentence we've heard this before now
[1:07:46] it is also used to separate items in a
[1:07:49] list and to mark a place of thousands he
[1:07:53] says in large numeral so that period and
[1:07:58] comma packed strong meaning Saints
[1:08:01] remember he was sent to the house of
[1:08:03] Israel first right amen now in Matthew 5
[1:08:07] verse 18 various Saints you that head
[1:08:10] till heaven and earth pass one jot or
[1:08:13] one tittle shall in no wise pass from
[1:08:16] the law till all be fulfilled correct
[1:08:20] now he's God Jesus is dealing now with
[1:08:21] the little things the tiny little things
[1:08:23] and now back to the mayonnaise and Gill
[1:08:25] killing the man age he starts breaking
[1:08:28] down this jot and tittle the man age
[1:08:31] Gill I love him he's one of my favorite
[1:08:33] ones right
[1:08:33] he says the judge in the Greek language
[1:08:36] answers to John in the Hebrew and least
[1:08:39] of all the letters in the alphabet
[1:08:40] someone the least or tiniest right hence
[1:08:43] a little city is called by this name and
[1:08:45] this reason is given for it because the
[1:08:47] jawed is the least among letters so
[1:08:50] jesus said even the tiniest little mark
[1:08:52] in the law the tiniest little mark in
[1:08:54] the scripture has now look what now look
[1:08:57] what he was able to dig up in the
[1:08:58] histories he says he says this shows in
[1:09:01] what language and what language the law
[1:09:03] was written not in the Sumerian language
[1:09:05] Samaritan pieces for the jawed and that
[1:09:08] is a very large letter but in the Hebrew
[1:09:10] it is very small pieces and particularly
[1:09:13] is written very diminutive character by
[1:09:17] one tittle some think is meant one of
[1:09:19] these ducks or dashes or quarter lines
[1:09:22] distinguished one letter from another
[1:09:23] but in the English English language to
[1:09:26] English this is they're so much alike he
[1:09:29] says now these are their little strokes
[1:09:31] on the top of letters which is U is
[1:09:32] called crowns or spikes here meant in
[1:09:35] which they imagined
[1:09:37] mysteries were contained in a jot or
[1:09:42] tittle now we're now we're not Hebrew
[1:09:45] we're not Samaritan but what Scripture
[1:09:49] what what prophecy now remember dealing
[1:09:52] with what Christ's first coming would
[1:09:55] mean is so much better Jesse's picking
[1:09:57] up on it what could mean a little comma
[1:09:59] or little doc huh he says in these
[1:10:05] things they believed or they imagined in
[1:10:07] the imagination God's God said these
[1:10:10] little things everything means something
[1:10:12] he says they imagined great mysteries
[1:10:15] were contained in it I loved you he must
[1:10:22] been a big fish it was on him you mean
[1:10:24] even the name Gill Isaiah 60:1 the spear
[1:10:27] the lord of the plumy because the Lord
[1:10:29] has anointed me to preach good tidings
[1:10:30] unto the meek he has sent me to bind up
[1:10:33] the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to
[1:10:35] the captives and the opening of the
[1:10:36] prison to them that I bow praise be to
[1:10:38] God he says to proclaim Liberty to
[1:10:40] proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
[1:10:42] karma and the day of vengeance of our
[1:10:45] Lord semicolon to the comfort all that
[1:10:48] mourn right we know this scripture
[1:10:51] absolutely now the scripture lay in
[1:10:53] Isaiah for many many many many many
[1:10:55] years hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[1:10:57] of years but now as we go back to
[1:10:59] Christ's first coming god almighty comes
[1:11:02] to the Jews and the Jews first right
[1:11:04] absolutely look here as he starts his
[1:11:07] ministry in Luke 4 in verse 16 and he
[1:11:11] came to Nazareth where he had been
[1:11:13] brought up as his custom was he went
[1:11:15] into the synagogue on the Saturday and
[1:11:17] stood up to read and they has delivered
[1:11:19] him under the book of the prophet Isaiah
[1:11:22] right and when he had opened the book
[1:11:24] notice it takes Jesus Christ to open the
[1:11:26] mysteries to open the Word of God to you
[1:11:28] absolutely he has to do the opening and
[1:11:31] then he picks description and he makes
[1:11:33] it come the past and he says what this
[1:11:35] day the scripture is fulfilled he says
[1:11:37] here open the book and he found in the
[1:11:38] place where it was written he wrote this
[1:11:41] he read the specific thing for a purpose
[1:11:43] correct amen he says now as Jesus picked
[1:11:48] us up he found the place and Isaiah 61
[1:11:50] he says and this
[1:11:51] here the Lord is upon me because the
[1:11:52] ears annoy me to preach the gospel to
[1:11:54] the poor he has sent me to heal the
[1:11:55] brokenhearted to preach deliverance to
[1:11:57] the captives and recovering of sight to
[1:11:59] the blind to send the libertine that are
[1:12:01] bruised to preach acceptable year of the
[1:12:03] Lord and then he switches that comma to
[1:12:06] earth a period and he closed the book
[1:12:10] and he gave it again to the minister and
[1:12:13] sat down and the eyes of all them were
[1:12:15] in the synagogue were passes on him and
[1:12:17] he began the same thing this day the
[1:12:19] scripture is fulfilled a man praise be
[1:12:23] to God right now this was the first
[1:12:25] coming of Christ we know these things
[1:12:28] right now notice the difference
[1:12:30] here's Isaiah 61 and there's your comma
[1:12:34] legit oh the little jot or tittle but
[1:12:37] then when I come down the price he
[1:12:39] fulfilled he stops and he this portion
[1:12:42] right here he says and the day of
[1:12:43] vengeance of our God to comfort all the
[1:12:45] more that was for another age that was
[1:12:47] for his second coming correct so he only
[1:12:50] had to fulfill the first coming he says
[1:12:52] this day the scripture is fulfilled it
[1:12:54] changes that comma to a period great
[1:13:00] mysteries are hidden these things and
[1:13:02] their karma represents thousands in the
[1:13:04] new world yeah absolutely from Abraham
[1:13:10] Daniel was about 2,000 years from Laura
[1:13:13] to Jesus 2,000 years and so far we're on
[1:13:15] our march to 2,000 years from Christ to
[1:13:18] the Gentiles raptured up
[1:13:20] hey man absolutely sure simple graph
[1:13:24] absolutely got that off the internet
[1:13:25] praise be to God right now that was his
[1:13:28] first coming yes sure
[1:13:31] now we know that when Christ came to his
[1:13:36] own and his own received him that it was
[1:13:37] because the Bible says that the Jews
[1:13:40] were blinded for our sakes if the Jews
[1:13:46] would have received him right then we
[1:13:48] would have been lost we would have went
[1:13:50] to hell we every one of us here would
[1:13:53] never wouldn't even have been born
[1:13:54] because it was supposed to stop right
[1:13:55] and then but at that time there was a
[1:13:58] 2000 year conjunction that between that
[1:14:01] period and I comma and he in Jesus
[1:14:04] Christ fit the
[1:14:05] Tyl wife right in there hey man that's
[1:14:09] right sure
[1:14:10] he says what then Israel has been not
[1:14:13] ethnic bla obtained that which he which
[1:14:16] he seeketh for but the election hath
[1:14:18] obtained it he says and the rest were
[1:14:20] blinded see what is divine love divine
[1:14:23] love is election hardest work he we
[1:14:30] loved him because he first loved us so
[1:14:34] what does it take if he loved us first
[1:14:37] what's that love it's agape
[1:14:39] so the only way we could love him back
[1:14:41] is with that agape love absolutely see
[1:14:43] but it takes him first to make a move
[1:14:45] and then we can receive his love which
[1:14:48] is the baptism the Holy Ghost and then
[1:14:50] we can reflect him back to here maybe
[1:14:51] because we can't even love God right
[1:14:54] without the Holy Spirit we can't do a
[1:14:56] thing we're depending on him to love him
[1:14:59] back whatever whatever what a shame
[1:15:05] verse 9 and David said let their table
[1:15:09] be made a snare and a trap and a
[1:15:10] stumbling block and our events aren't
[1:15:12] recompense unto them let their eyes be
[1:15:14] darkened that they may not see him bow
[1:15:16] down their way down their back always
[1:15:19] the Jews rejected Christ and they said
[1:15:22] let his blood be upon us you're blinded
[1:15:26] for six think God Almighty for that but
[1:15:34] now the balls in our hands what I'm
[1:15:37] gonna do with it we gotta go out when
[1:15:40] some Souls live the very life of God I

[1:17:19] their fall salvation has come unto the
[1:17:23] Gentiles praise God for to provoke them
[1:17:28] to jealousy forth the fall be a planet
[1:17:30] be rich of the world and the diminishing
[1:17:31] of the rich of the Gentiles how much
[1:17:33] more their fullness God sent that first
[1:17:37] messenger he was a Jew to bring it to
[1:17:39] the Gentiles

[1:18:04] Elevens it's all it breaks it all down
[1:18:06] the branches the the vines all these
[1:18:08] things he says for if God spared not the
[1:18:11] natural branches that's Israel Saints he
[1:18:13] says take heed lest he not also not
[1:18:16] spared thee every time I get behind here
[1:18:21] specifically behind a pulpit it's it's a
[1:18:24] very nerve-racking if you guys knew the
[1:18:29] mind battles I have everyday I don't
[1:18:31] know if you don't even feel worthy
[1:18:32] to be up here you actually feel like

[1:18:37] hypocrite

[1:18:42] therefore the goodness and severity of
[1:18:43] God on them which fell severity but
[1:18:46] toward thee goodness if thou continue in
[1:18:49] see look if thou continue not if you
[1:18:52] receive and be glorious and turn away he
[1:18:54] says you must continue in the world well
[1:18:58] cut the promise and he says he says the
[1:19:00] boy in the church age book he says what
[1:19:02] he says one of the evidence of the
[1:19:04] Bedouin goat he says you'll be in the
[1:19:05] word all the way that's all the way to
[1:19:09] the end amen
[1:19:10] and then you don't stop there you go up
[1:19:13] all the way you've been sold out your
[1:19:16] lack stocking bare lips your hard done
[1:19:20] purse I here's a thousand dollars to
[1:19:23] change doctrine I've already been bought
[1:19:25] and paid for two thousand years ago it's
[1:19:28] way too late you come along way too late
[1:19:32] man so I know there's s o N out there I
[1:19:36] know his name
[1:19:38] [Laughter]
[1:19:40] this is reliable cut out of the olive
[1:19:42] tree which is wild by nature and we're
[1:19:45] grafted contrary to nature into a good
[1:19:48] olive tree where does it all come from
[1:19:50] the island tree a man he says how much
[1:19:52] more shall these beat which be the
[1:19:55] natural branches be graffed into their
[1:19:57] own olive tree look not only has the
[1:19:59] blind of their eyes for our sakes
[1:20:01] brought us and granted to us in but he's
[1:20:04] going to restore them as well praise be
[1:20:06] to God he thought of everything now the
[1:20:11] one would be lost a man praise be to God
[1:20:17] now let's continue on by the grace of
[1:20:19] God I don't want to be too long we want
[1:20:22] to get give space by the grace of God I
[1:20:25] want to hit some things here coming up
[1:20:36] let's see here the Bible says that the
[1:20:44] rapture is a mystery yes 12 mysteries of
[1:20:47] New Testament but your pastor was one
[1:20:49] the first ones to tell me about that I
[1:20:51] search it out man sure doesn't look
[1:20:52] right absolutely and the statue perfect
[1:20:56] man faith virtue all those things moving
[1:20:59] all right but the base is faith right
[1:21:04] but look what it takes for mystery here
[1:21:08] Ephesians 3 1 for this cause i paul the
[1:21:12] prisoner of jesus christ for you
[1:21:13] gentiles for if you heard this the
[1:21:17] dispensation of grace of god which has
[1:21:19] given me to you or how that what by
[1:21:24] revelation what the prophets say he says
[1:21:27] pray for revelation more than any
[1:21:29] because if there's any other mystery if
[1:21:32] there's any other thing the bride must
[1:21:34] slow for this rapture if there's
[1:21:36] anything else that you must catch from
[1:21:38] the mind of god will it take faith no
[1:21:43] first it must be unveiled what is faith
[1:21:48] seeing something which is not done or
[1:21:49] taking place yet seeing something
[1:21:51] believing for something but you see it
[1:21:53] already and now you could say i'm
[1:21:56] looking past when i see right here but
[1:21:57] i'm seeing the end and now i can have
[1:21:59] faith on it right but before faith comes
[1:22:03] it must be revealed
[1:22:06] it must be open before you can see it
[1:22:08] spiritually yes he says if you have
[1:22:14] heard of this position of grace how that
[1:22:16] by revelation he made known unto me the
[1:22:18] mystery
[1:22:19] so the mysteries will be made by
[1:22:21] revelation you must pray for revelation
[1:22:24] no revealed these things to me what does
[1:22:26] jeremiah 33:3 he says jesus is an hour
[1:22:29] show the great things which thou knowest
[1:22:31] not what but we must ask for them Lord
[1:22:35] reveal these things to me show me the
[1:22:37] very key things to make us rest Lord
[1:22:39] increase my faith and show me how
[1:22:42] because we ain't missing us we must go
[1:22:45] up
[1:22:46] my goodness how the revelation he may
[1:22:51] know known unto me the mystery what has
[1:22:54] this day been nothing but a day of
[1:22:56] Revelation opening of the Word of God
[1:22:59] a restoration all these things saying to
[1:23:02] God what we understand and know now is
[1:23:05] light-years beyond them 99% of the
[1:23:10] people who's ever lived in my entire
[1:23:11] life and yet we can't even seem to make
[1:23:17] it work it seems we came in and we can't
[1:23:20] even walk in half the time because the
[1:23:22] abundance of the mind battles the amount
[1:23:24] of sin in this fresh the temptations the
[1:23:27] worldly easy living hi yes have mercy on
[1:23:32] us right now let's continue on I won't
[1:23:36] hear some I want to hear some things
[1:23:37] here by the grace of God some a couple
[1:23:41] of things here at the end now back to
[1:23:44] this he says tell us Matthew 24 what
[1:23:47] tell us then what shall be these things
[1:23:49] be and shall be the sign of thy coming
[1:23:51] in the end of the world right and we
[1:23:53] know that Israel's God's timepiece
[1:23:55] correct now we're these all this might
[1:23:57] be a little repetition for you in verse
[1:24:01] 21 he says for there shall be great
[1:24:04] tribulation notice tribute the
[1:24:07] tribulation is encased in Matthew 24 he
[1:24:10] says shall neither be since the
[1:24:12] beginning of the world to this time no
[1:24:14] ever shall be and except those days
[1:24:16] should be shortened now we're getting
[1:24:19] the bride time he says there shall be no
[1:24:21] flesh saved but for the elects sake he
[1:24:24] says those days shall be shortened so
[1:24:29] what he's saying is the truth the great
[1:24:30] revelation should strike first first
[1:24:32] before it should have but because God
[1:24:35] actually holds back the full wrath of
[1:24:37] God until that Brides caught up in
[1:24:39] rapture because the very elect a he says
[1:24:42] Shelly says where he says he's going to
[1:24:43] have those days fall short
[1:24:45] so the rapture the Great Tribulation is
[1:24:47] all in this but also the great deception
[1:24:51] for there shall arise false Christ's
[1:24:55] false anointed ones saints of God we
[1:24:59] appreciate a church in Thailand
[1:25:00] they told rejected quite a few things
[1:25:03] but they've had six people healed of
[1:25:05] AIDS when you they had a prayer line I
[1:25:11] mean for the rainy but praying you touch
[1:25:13] them like this brother you just go like
[1:25:15] this for three seconds and they fall
[1:25:17] back because they've been trained that
[1:25:19] way all the power guns and then two
[1:25:22] seconds I'm looking at them and they get
[1:25:23] right back up false anointed ones not
[1:25:31] trying to call anyone anything but you
[1:25:32] got to watch these things that didn't if
[1:25:34] you're slaying the spirit you are slain
[1:25:37] you'll get up on the spirit bade you get
[1:25:39] up when he's done with you you'll get up
[1:25:43] there falling 20 at a time
[1:25:45] Bam Bam I felt like billion benny hinn
[1:25:48] no I mean I'm not joking I'm not even
[1:25:51] joking there that's just what happens
[1:25:52] you're just boom down down down down
[1:25:54] what in the world is going on be worried
[1:25:56] like just keep praying and then I
[1:25:58] stopped I said sister Esther let me know
[1:26:00] what this one next one once and then he
[1:26:02] started doing that way I want my family
[1:26:04] I want them 14 boys stuck in the cave
[1:26:06] okay now we have something to go for we
[1:26:09] started praying like that way I said
[1:26:11] just ran them and they fall down and he
[1:26:14] said there shall arise false Christ's
[1:26:16] and false prophets and shall show great
[1:26:17] signs and wonders in so much that if
[1:26:20] they if it were possible they shall
[1:26:22] deceive the very elect it look what so
[1:26:24] in case to Matthew 24 the great
[1:26:26] tribulation the rapture and the great
[1:26:28] deception right yes but also at the end
[1:26:33] here God gives the great timepiece right
[1:26:36] here he says all these things he says
[1:26:38] look he says I'm gonna show you
[1:26:39] something right here right
[1:26:41] you know we've been through this correct
[1:26:42] verse 32 now learn a parable of the fig
[1:26:45] tree when his branch is yet tender and
[1:26:47] putteth forth leaves you know that
[1:26:48] summer is nice notice what leaves not
[1:26:51] fruit first but leaves what life is now
[1:26:53] entered in what is springtime the time
[1:26:56] of life come back what into the fig tree
[1:26:57] and now she's starting to bloom a man so
[1:27:01] likewise ye when ye shall see these
[1:27:03] things know that is near what the
[1:27:05] tribulation the rapture what the great
[1:27:06] deception he says even at the doors
[1:27:09] releasing you this generation shall not
[1:27:11] pass till all
[1:27:13] things be fulfilled now we're gonna hit
[1:27:15] some stuff here okay everybody know who
[1:27:18] the fig tree is yes the fig tree is
[1:27:21] Israel Christ first ministry he was a
[1:27:24] hungered he went to the fig tree no figs
[1:27:28] on it no fruit only leaves he lookin for
[1:27:32] it he curses it and the leaves wither
[1:27:36] correctly sure how soon is the fig tree
[1:27:39] withered it was prophesying of Israel
[1:27:41] correct absolutely now back to Jeremiah
[1:27:44] chapter 8 if you read this he says why
[1:27:46] is this people of Jerusalem slipping
[1:27:48] back by perpetual backsliding they hold
[1:27:51] fast the seat they refused to return
[1:27:53] reading old chap 3 is dealing with
[1:27:55] Israel right but now in verse 12 he says
[1:28:00] were they ashamed when they committed
[1:28:03] abomination nay they were not ashamed at
[1:28:05] all neither could they blush therefore
[1:28:07] shall they fall among them that fall
[1:28:09] well if they fell it for our sakes they
[1:28:12] were blinded for us correct in the time
[1:28:15] of their visitation they shall be cast
[1:28:18] down say 'then or what is it when God
[1:28:21] manifests himself in the flesh when he
[1:28:24] came to his own his own received him not
[1:28:26] he's talking about the first coming of
[1:28:28] Jesus Christ
[1:28:29] correct he says almost surely consumed
[1:28:32] them he did what 70 AD they were
[1:28:34] banished for 2,000 years there shall be
[1:28:36] no grapes on the vine absolutely because
[1:28:39] what we weren't even savable then he
[1:28:41] says no figs on the fig tree see when he
[1:28:44] come to them and the leaf shall fade and
[1:28:48] I did notice there was no fruit no
[1:28:52] things but he cursed him to die what is
[1:28:55] Israel he says and the things that I
[1:28:57] haven't given them shall pass away from
[1:28:59] now remember what I taught on the
[1:29:02] forfeiting of seven church ages that's
[1:29:05] exactly right that's exactly right they
[1:29:08] forfeited everything we've had how many
[1:29:13] healings take place in Israel every day
[1:29:15] God a mercy a church and
[1:29:18] doesn't leave this message as six people
[1:29:19] healed of AIDS because of the blessings
[1:29:22] of Jesus Christ when we received him by
[1:29:25] the grace of God we received him all of
[1:29:28] him Israel is that fig tree oh sorry
[1:29:36] let's get to this I'm working the left
[1:29:38] handed here Israel the State of Israel
[1:29:43] is born says May 14 1948 he says when
[1:29:51] you see that fig tree blooming leaves
[1:29:55] shooting forth life has come back into
[1:29:59] Israel into the fig tree she's alive
[1:30:02] again where are we the great tribulation
[1:30:09] the rapture the great deceptions that
[1:30:13] Jesus said what that generation shall
[1:30:17] not pass till all things be fulfilled

[1:32:16] harnesses the bride and he comes back
[1:32:18] for the Jews as well back to back to
[1:32:22] quitting spoofs and done it's like an

[1:32:38] you just preach on the song song a while
[1:32:39] back have you did been a few years okay
[1:32:42] now let's get to where we're going I
[1:32:44] want to kind of skip this we've been
[1:32:45] through these when hit some one has some
[1:32:47] prosti Saints here we go from 1679 now
[1:32:53] some of this I too understand but if you
[1:32:55] catch what the Spirit is saying through
[1:32:56] this lady we just found this this was
[1:32:59] just sent to me about a month ago month
[1:33:01] and a half two months maybe prophecy by
[1:33:04] Jane lead of England 1679 okay let's
[1:33:07] read this because this is a there's a
[1:33:10] setting she's showing things right here
[1:33:12] there will be a total in full Redemption
[1:33:15] by Jesus Christ this is a mystery
[1:33:18] revealed by the Holy Spirit
[1:33:20] oh Lynch and those holy seekers who love
[1:33:22] willing search for truth the CEOs in the
[1:33:26] book of Revelation represent the
[1:33:28] completion of this redemption how'd she
[1:33:30] know that or was she not speaking but
[1:33:34] the fulfillment is being held back at
[1:33:36] the present time 1679 right as God's
[1:33:41] Spirit opens seal after sealed
[1:33:44] those truth-loving holy seekers praise
[1:33:46] be to God I hope you can represent
[1:33:47] yourself in there somewhere this
[1:33:49] complete and total Redemption will be
[1:33:51] revealed both individually and
[1:33:53] universally this gradual opening of the
[1:33:57] mysteries of God's redemptive redemption
[1:33:59] constitutes guys unfathomable wisdom and
[1:34:01] will continue reveal new and fresh
[1:34:03] things to the deserving seeker don't you
[1:34:08] see this thing will never get old it's
[1:34:10] going to open open on the night side
[1:34:13] we're gonna see the ball open up he
[1:34:16] continually opens what what is saying in
[1:34:19] Matthew 13 he says the describe he says
[1:34:22] the household he says he filled it new
[1:34:24] and old things new and the old amen he
[1:34:28] says he said it's continually open up
[1:34:31] this gradual opening of the mystery of
[1:34:34] Christ's Redemption constitutes of God's
[1:34:36] own family wisdom and will continue to
[1:34:37] reveal new and fresh things to the to
[1:34:39] the deserving seeker because now we're
[1:34:43] what in the we're in the holiest of
[1:34:46] Holies
[1:34:47] now here's what I don't understand
[1:34:49] forward the reason for the opening of
[1:34:51] testimony and heaven before the end of
[1:34:52] the ages so that the Ark of the living
[1:34:55] testimony contains may be unsealed take
[1:34:58] with a grain of salt
[1:34:58] could be revelations 15 that's kind of
[1:35:01] one thing the presence of divine Ark
[1:35:03] will constitute the life of the Virgin
[1:35:05] Church and whatever this church body is
[1:35:07] the arts art must also be the spreading
[1:35:10] of the everlasting gospel the kingdom
[1:35:11] will begin with the unsealing of the
[1:35:13] living testimony in God's Ark okay the
[1:35:17] proclamations from this testimony will
[1:35:19] be to the sounding of the trumpet of
[1:35:22] alarm to the nations of Christendom
[1:35:24] Christ will give authority to end all
[1:35:27] controversies concerning the true church
[1:35:29] and then this is going to happen he's
[1:35:32] going to finish this by the time this
[1:35:34] rapture takes place there will be no
[1:35:35] doubt who Jesus Christ is because
[1:35:39] remember what does the Book of
[1:35:40] Revelations is the title the Book of
[1:35:43] Revelations
[1:35:44] or is it the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:35:47] maybe there has to be an unfolding of
[1:35:49] who Jesus Christ is he says he says to
[1:35:54] end all controversies concerning the
[1:35:56] true church which is born from new
[1:35:58] mother this decision will be the actual
[1:36:01] sealing of Christ Church body with God's
[1:36:03] name nature and authority commissioned
[1:36:06] her to act in that name now look what
[1:36:09] she says now this new name or nature or
[1:36:14] authority will distinguish her from the
[1:36:16] seven thousand names of Babylon
[1:36:19] sounds like revelations two and three
[1:36:21] there's a new name promised the
[1:36:23] selection and preparations were churches
[1:36:25] to be after a secret or hidden manner
[1:36:27] what does the Holy Ghost what Jesus st.
[1:36:29] John three says he comes like the wind
[1:36:31] you don't know where it's coming where
[1:36:32] it goes amen but he fails who will be
[1:36:35] failed absolutely
[1:36:36] hey man as David was chosen chosen and
[1:36:40] anointed by God is the Lord's prophet
[1:36:42] but was not admitted to public service
[1:36:44] in the kingdom for quite a few years he
[1:36:47] says so awesome the Virgin Church which
[1:36:49] has no human origins and who is also
[1:36:52] from the stem of David will be born it
[1:36:53] will take her some time to come out of
[1:36:55] immaturity it's been 50 years as the
[1:37:02] prophets been on the sea it will take
[1:37:06] some time to come out of immaturity and
[1:37:10] arrive at full of mature age are you
[1:37:15] reading this my goodness we're there now
[1:37:21] let's go on I won't hit this it's a long
[1:37:30] one but here are something hit the
[1:37:33] mighty spirit of Cyrus the mighty spirit
[1:37:39] of science is appointed to lay the
[1:37:40] foundation of this third temple and
[1:37:43] support it during the construction right
[1:37:45] the mighty spirit of Cyrus right who is
[1:37:49] Cyrus Cyrus was the medial Persian King
[1:37:51] I believe that gave the Jews said go
[1:37:54] rebuild that temple right he was a
[1:37:56] Gentile King right there's a scripture
[1:38:00] 2nd chronicles 36 22 touched by Isaiah
[1:38:03] 44 now why did that strike me so much
[1:38:08] because last
[1:38:10] Israel minted a coin Cyrus Trump
[1:38:18] 100-year anniversary there's King Cyrus
[1:38:21] right there his profile and Trump's is
[1:38:24] over him
[1:38:25] the mighty spirit of Cyrus will be upon
[1:38:29] this world for what the rebuilding of
[1:38:32] the third temple and on the back of the
[1:38:38] coin is the third temple that generation
[1:38:46] shall not pass to all things be
[1:38:50] fulfilled I talked to a brother today
[1:38:53] he's on Facebook a little bit he says
[1:38:55] already on Facebook they're saying
[1:38:58] Trump's daughter is talking about her
[1:39:01] for president won't fulfill the six
[1:39:03] vision could be the Catholic Church it
[1:39:06] could be a natural man but man she'd fit
[1:39:10] it there's one prophecy right there okay
[1:39:14] there they coined this that Israel
[1:39:18] okayed that he's a deal maker yeah
[1:39:24] remember this one 1937 Joel Brandt
[1:39:27] stream hit his head right riding a horse
[1:39:29] his head when divisions coma-like stuff
[1:39:35] right before LA falls into the ocean
[1:39:38] San Francisco flips on top of itself
[1:39:41] right he says I wonder what he here was
[1:39:44] it certainly was not 1937
[1:39:47] I saw a newspaper on the corner with a
[1:39:48] preacher of the president it surely
[1:39:50] wasn't mr. Roosevelt he says he was
[1:39:53] bigger heavier big ears if it was in
[1:39:55] 1937 he says I wondered what year it was
[1:39:58] now we're just taking this with a grain
[1:40:00] of salt but we're looking at some
[1:40:03] dimensions here Franklin Delano
[1:40:06] Roosevelt six-foot to 173 pounds 6 foot
[1:40:10] 3 236 uh-huh take with a grain of salt
[1:40:15] we're getting closer
[1:40:17] things are getting closer
[1:40:21] now one more thing I want to show you by
[1:40:25] the grace of God
[1:40:25] one more prophecy right here we're
[1:40:29] getting close Saints we were getting so
[1:40:32] very close this year has been a
[1:40:34] transformation here for me many many
[1:40:38] battles it's been the second hardest
[1:40:40] year since my 33rd year 33rd year was
[1:40:42] off the charts this was right up there
[1:40:44] with it not quite as bad but revelations
[1:40:48] 3 verse 10 because thou has kept the
[1:40:53] word of my patience I will also keep
[1:40:55] thee from the hour of temptation which
[1:40:57] shall come upon all the world to try
[1:40:59] them that dwell upon the earth this is
[1:41:01] to the fees and churches correct sure
[1:41:03] yeah now the exposition of 7 Church ages
[1:41:06] our prophet from 1965 another prophecy
[1:41:09] look what he's dealing with here he says
[1:41:11] now I will keep me from the eye of
[1:41:13] temptation which shall come upon all the
[1:41:15] world to try them that dwell upon the
[1:41:17] earth what leading what there's a
[1:41:21] temptation and then the Great
[1:41:22] Tribulation right this verse is not a
[1:41:26] declaration that the true church will go
[1:41:28] into and through the tribulation if it
[1:41:31] meant that it would have said that but
[1:41:32] it said I will keep thee from the hour
[1:41:34] of temptation right
[1:41:35] amen this temptation is exactly like the
[1:41:39] temptation in Eden it will be a very
[1:41:41] inviting preposition to held up in
[1:41:44] direct opposition to God's command and
[1:41:46] word and yet from the standpoint and
[1:41:48] we're going to see this and from the
[1:41:50] standpoint of human reasoning he says
[1:41:53] seer he says it will be so very right so
[1:41:57] enlightening and life-giving as to fool
[1:41:59] the world right so whatever is coming is
[1:42:03] gonna be so sick
[1:42:04] zoomy sounded so good it's gonna feel
[1:42:07] just so right right there's a forerunner
[1:42:11] to this to this great thing it's already
[1:42:14] happened four years ago okay I'm gonna
[1:42:18] show it to you now look what here now he
[1:42:22] continued on only the very elect will
[1:42:25] not be full right there he goes right
[1:42:27] back to Matthew 24
[1:42:29] twenty-four correct the temptation will
[1:42:36] come as follows he's giving us a preview
[1:42:40] he's giving us hints and clues on how to
[1:42:44] detect this temptation and to reject his
[1:42:48] temptation say sure you look crazy
[1:42:50] because it sounds so nice come on
[1:42:54] brother let's just be one the ANCA
[1:43:00] miracle notice it's a religious move
[1:43:02] we'll move the well that has started on
[1:43:06] what seems such a beautiful and blessed
[1:43:09] principle were they gonna get this
[1:43:11] they're getting it from the Bible
[1:43:12] they're not gonna get it from the Bible
[1:43:14] they're gonna get from the New Testament
[1:43:15] that from just a New Testament but
[1:43:18] they're getting it from the Riddler's
[1:43:20] where they poor notice the Prophet did
[1:43:22] not put the scripture in but by the Word
[1:43:24] of God we obviously know where it comes
[1:43:25] from here in John 17 verse 21 now let's
[1:43:28] read this write pieces that they may all
[1:43:30] be one Christ is now Judas is off the
[1:43:34] scene and now Christ was really himself
[1:43:36] insuring how the church is going to be
[1:43:39] he said that we all be one he's his
[1:43:41] father our than me and I need that they
[1:43:44] may also be worn in us now why why does
[1:43:49] he wanted to come the oneness because
[1:43:51] that the world may believe that thou has
[1:43:54] sent me so the only way that the world
[1:43:56] is going to under the only way the
[1:43:58] world's gonna believe that the Jesus is
[1:44:00] real is if we come to one thinks of god
[1:44:03] we gotta fulfill his prophecy if we
[1:44:06] could just make this prophecy fulfilled
[1:44:07] they're gonna believe the whole will be
[1:44:10] converted and the glory which thou gave
[1:44:16] us me well now when this happens we're
[1:44:18] gonna get glory I have given them that
[1:44:22] they may be one even as we are one
[1:44:25] they're gonna pull from this scripture
[1:44:27] right there fulfilling Christ's prayer
[1:44:30] that we all might be one become so
[1:44:33] politically strong are we there yet
[1:44:35] we're getting there that she bears
[1:44:38] pressure upon the government to cause
[1:44:41] all to join with her
[1:44:43] either directly or through inheritance
[1:44:44] two principles enacted into law so that
[1:44:46] no people will be recognized as a short
[1:44:49] churches see it's a religious move the
[1:44:51] mark of the beast is a religious mode
[1:44:55] unless under the direct or indirect
[1:44:58] domination domination the sitting the
[1:45:01] woman that sits of this council little
[1:45:03] grooves for those charters privileges
[1:45:05] etc until they lose all property
[1:45:07] property and spiritual rights with the
[1:45:12] people has this already started
[1:45:16] I got the video brother Malachi is this
[1:45:19] things plugged in hopefully this'll I
[1:45:20] have a little clip of video I want to
[1:45:22] show you this has already started four
[1:45:25] years ago okay you may have already be
[1:45:29] aware of this but I want to play it for
[1:45:32] you if we can get this to go I don't
[1:45:38] know okay hold on here let me see sorry
[1:45:47] if this is taking a little here we go I
[1:45:51] thinks okay we're there let's try this
[1:46:00] [Music]
[1:46:03] mines up all the way brother Jess unless
[1:46:05] you can find we will serve for the I'm
[1:46:25] not a master computer guy I'm just happy
[1:46:27] to have won praise Lord thank God me
[1:46:39] bless his heart let me let me tell me
[1:46:44] award division destroys our credibility
[1:46:47] it is a sorry and Nikita is decorated
[1:46:52] because fear is false evidence appearing
[1:46:54] real connection
[1:46:56] ok let's restart here by the grief sad
[1:46:58] thing sister Wendy let's play what there
[1:47:01] now look how smooth this sounds thank
[1:47:03] you for the loris the Lord will give you
[1:47:07] a gold star
[1:47:08] definitely be a blip bless you
[1:47:16] that's all Batman he came through Jesus
[1:47:19] the glory was the presence of death
[1:47:21] what does the carries medical yield is
[1:47:23] when we experience the presence of God
[1:47:26] and he said and I give them the glory
[1:47:28] cognatic means them so that they may be
[1:47:33] one it's the glory that glues us
[1:47:36] together not the doctors to see her
[1:47:39] glory if you accept that Christ is
[1:47:41] living in me and the presence of God is
[1:47:43] in me and the presence of God is in you
[1:47:45] that's all we need because God will
[1:47:48] start out all our doctors we get
[1:47:50] upstairs there for Christian unity is
[1:47:54] the basis of our credibility because
[1:47:56] jesus said until they won they will be
[1:47:58] company the world will not believe as
[1:48:01] they should and so we are one division
[1:48:04] destroys our credibility it is fear that
[1:48:08] keeps is decorated because fear is false
[1:48:10] evidence appearing real
[1:48:12] it's an acronym f.e.a.r false evidence
[1:48:15] appearing real because most of your fear
[1:48:18] is based on propaganda now why is it
[1:48:23] historic because in 1999 the Roman
[1:48:28] Catholic Church and the Protestant
[1:48:30] Lutheran Church signed an agreement that
[1:48:34] brought an end to the protests Luther
[1:48:38] believed that we were saved by grace
[1:48:40] through faith alone amen but the
[1:48:48] Catholic Church believed that we were
[1:48:49] saved by works and that was the protest
[1:48:55] 1999 they wrote this together because in
[1:49:00] the Protestant church there are the
[1:49:01] chief salvations people who are getting
[1:49:03] born again but nothing whatsoever and
[1:49:06] because we didn't even look for fruits
[1:49:07] it wasn't issued but there wasn't
[1:49:10] sorry for salvation and no it's not but
[1:49:13] it's a good journey few are saved so
[1:49:16] what these two churches do is they put
[1:49:18] the two definitions together listen to
[1:49:20] I'm reading verbatim from the Catholic
[1:49:22] Mexican website justification means that
[1:49:27] Christ Himself is our righteousness in
[1:49:31] which we share through the Holy Spirit
[1:49:33] in accord with the will of the Father
[1:49:37] together we Catholics and Protestants
[1:49:41] Lutheran's
[1:49:42] believe and confess that by grace alone
[1:49:47] in faith in Christ's saving works and
[1:49:51] not because of any merit on our part we
[1:49:55] are accepted by God and receive the Holy
[1:49:59] Spirit
[1:49:59] the renews our hearts while a putting
[1:50:02] and calling us to this work an end to
[1:50:15] the protests of luth their brothers and
[1:50:19] sisters Luther's protest is over is
[1:50:23] yours in 1999's resigns by the Lutheran
[1:50:31] Church the Federation worldwide later
[1:50:34] but five years later the worldwide
[1:50:36] Methodists signed the same agreement but
[1:50:38] as of today we still have had no
[1:50:39] Protestant evangelical that will stand
[1:50:42] up and sign this agreement to agree with
[1:50:45] our brothers and sisters that we are
[1:50:46] saved by grace through faith to good
[1:50:50] works they're not bound yet there's a
[1:50:56] challenge for you the the protest has
[1:51:00] been over for fifteen years and I could
[1:51:04] get a bit cheeky here because I
[1:51:06] challenge my Protestant foster friends
[1:51:08] if there is no more protest how can they
[1:51:11] be a Protestant church maybe we now
[1:51:17] we're all Catholics again
[1:51:21] but rarely fathers be a Catholic in the
[1:51:24] universal sense we are not protesting
[1:51:27] the doctrine of salvation by the
[1:51:29] Catholic Church anymore
[1:51:31] we now preach the same gospel we now
[1:51:33] preach you're saved by grace through
[1:51:35] faith alone the word alone what the
[1:51:38] argument for five languages the word
[1:51:41] alone is mad you can read it yourself
[1:51:43] the protest is over
[1:51:46] the protest is over so let me pray and
[1:51:51] then we'll start the video I believe we
[1:51:55] will begin to see more and more people
[1:51:57] called out to go into the world and work
[1:52:01] among the churches in the script of
[1:52:02] Elijah to turn the hearts of the
[1:52:04] father's to the children and the hearts
[1:52:06] of the children to the father's to make
[1:52:09] ready a people prepared for the Lord
[1:52:11] ministries of reconciliation we need to
[1:52:15] throw as much resources and energy into
[1:52:17] the Ministry of reconciliation as we do
[1:52:19] to the Ministry of evangelization are we
[1:52:22] building walls without foundation I
[1:52:27] challenge you to find a bridge builder
[1:52:29] and back in and I'd like to pray just
[1:52:35] pray if you agree you can say Amen
[1:52:38] what's this prayer does a dying man's
[1:52:42] prayer when you know you're about to die
[1:52:45] you certainly pray the most important
[1:52:48] prayer he said I do not pray for these
[1:52:51] of them but also for those who will
[1:52:55] believe in me through their work and
[1:52:59] they all may be one as you Father are in
[1:53:03] me dying in you they may also be one
[1:53:07] enough so that the world may believe
[1:53:11] that you sent me and the glory which you
[1:53:18] have given me I have given them that
[1:53:23] they may be one
[1:53:43] saints of God he pulled from John 17
[1:53:48] just exactly like the prop was said in
[1:53:52] 1965 in the church age book this is not
[1:53:56] and then he he plays the message from
[1:54:00] the Pope there but before that he said
[1:54:02] I'm coming in the spirit and power of a
[1:54:04] life of Malachi 4 of Elijah within one
[1:54:08] year he was dead he's already dead
[1:54:13] well you see how this moved then that
[1:54:16] sounds so nice but he forgot that Luther
[1:54:18] Knight nailed 95 they fixed one what
[1:54:26] about the other 94 pretty slick what was
[1:54:32] that that was a group of pastors he
[1:54:34] called the interdenominational pastors
[1:54:36] meeting evangelical meeting to join up
[1:54:40] with the Lutheran's
[1:54:41] and the Methodists and the Catholics
[1:54:42] already signed the document four years
[1:54:46] ago and it's still not with political
[1:54:49] pressure yet when what Jesus say Matthew
[1:54:53] 13 verse 27 so the servants of the
[1:54:57] householder came and said of him served
[1:54:58] in us now not so good seed in thy field
[1:55:00] from when staff that then tears and he
[1:55:03] said to him an enemy has done this the
[1:55:05] servants entered him wilt thou then go
[1:55:06] then we go and gathered him up but he
[1:55:08] said nay less while they gather up the
[1:55:10] tares ye root up also to eat the wheat
[1:55:12] with them let both grow together until
[1:55:15] the harvest and in the time of the
[1:55:17] harvest I'll say to the Reapers he says
[1:55:20] gather ye together first the tares the
[1:55:25] tares must be bound first what are the
[1:55:28] tears the false churches underneath the
[1:55:32] Catholic Church what he's saying Matt in
[1:55:34] Revelations two or three says and I will
[1:55:35] kill her children with death but what is
[1:55:39] first
[1:55:40] I must bound the tares and bind them in
[1:55:42] bundles to burn them but gather the
[1:55:43] wheat into my barn saints of God were
[1:55:47] very close he may stand to read one last
[1:55:51] quote by the grace of God he says now
[1:55:56] this is exactly what John the Baptist
[1:55:58] and Jesus said for John said that the
[1:56:00] wheat would be guarded and the chaff
[1:56:02] burned Jesus said buying the tares and
[1:56:05] then gather the wheat the ekam única
[1:56:07] move will bind the tares churches
[1:56:09] together for the tares must be bound
[1:56:12] first and though their end is burning
[1:56:16] they are not burned at their binding but
[1:56:19] it reserved to a later date he says
[1:56:22] which is at the end of the thousand
[1:56:24] years or the second resurrection but
[1:56:26] once the tares are bound the rapture can
[1:56:31] take place and so and does so at the
[1:56:35] time sometime between the binding and
[1:56:38] the revelation of the Antichrist and
[1:56:43] they're binding each other that that
[1:56:47] thing was made back in 1999 when I got
[1:56:50] out of college fifteen years ago and
[1:56:54] that was four years ago when he said
[1:56:56] this
[1:56:56] how much closer the churches together
[1:56:59] now where should the message churches be
[1:57:03] where should they should the holy ghost
[1:57:05] speak in controlling our churches yes
[1:57:08] should they be controlling every meeting
[1:57:10] should they be controlling every pastor
[1:57:12] every member of the body of Christ
[1:57:14] absolutely yes but like that prophecy
[1:57:18] said he says it'll take a little bit of
[1:57:19] time to get the bride mature the break
[1:57:24] had had a maturity of a young life but
[1:57:28] when she's ready Christ will come and
[1:57:30] sweep away and take her away by God's
