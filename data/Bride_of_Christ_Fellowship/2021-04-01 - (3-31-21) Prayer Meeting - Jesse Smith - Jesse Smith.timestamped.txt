[14:59] [Music]
[15:24] uh
[15:29] [Music]
[15:38] uh
[15:41] [Music]
[15:52] so
[15:57] [Music]
[16:20] i'm
[16:22] [Music]
[16:34] oh
[16:38] [Music]
[17:01] i have to read a couple portions of
[17:02] scripture here while we start with our
[17:04] memory verse we'll start with
[17:05] ecclesiastes 12.
[17:11] ecclesiastes 12 verse 1 and i'll just
[17:13] read a couple scriptures on prayer
[17:26] [Music]
[17:37] ecclesiastes 12 verse 1.
[17:55] let's read this together let's begin on
[17:57] three one
[17:58] two 3 remember now thy creator
[18:02] in the days of thy youth while the evil
[18:05] days
[18:06] come not nor the years draw nigh
[18:09] when thou shalt say i have no pleasure
[18:12] in them amen let's go to first timothy
[18:15] 2.
[18:17] let's read a little portion on prayer
[18:19] here
[18:21] first timothy 2 verse 1.
[18:41] just a beautiful portion of scripture
[18:42] here we preach a couple times
[18:44] over the last few years but just some
[18:46] good scriptures on prayer
[18:58] let's read verses uh one and two
[18:59] together okay now after that i'll read a
[19:01] little bit beyond that
[19:06] first timothy two verses one and two
[19:11] let's begin on three one two three i
[19:14] exhort therefore
[19:15] that first of all supplications
[19:19] prayers intercessions and giving of
[19:22] thanks
[19:23] be made for all men for kings
[19:26] and for all that are in authority
[19:29] that we may lead a quiet and peaceable
[19:32] life
[19:33] in all godliness and honesty and i'll
[19:36] read a little bit myself here
[19:37] for this is good and acceptable in the
[19:39] sight of god our
[19:40] savior notice he said first of all
[19:43] prayers
[19:44] first of all so when a church comes
[19:46] together the first thing paul says is
[19:48] pray
[19:49] make these prayers verse
[19:53] 4 who will have all men to be saved we
[19:55] know all men will not be saved but it's
[19:58] those
[19:58] it's god's desire for all men to be
[20:01] saved so it takes prayer
[20:03] to work together with that and to come
[20:06] unto the knowledge of the truth
[20:08] for there is one god and one mediator
[20:10] between god and men
[20:11] the man christ jesus who gave himself
[20:14] a ransom for all to be testified in due
[20:18] time let's remember that as we pray
[20:20] that those of us that have loved ones or
[20:22] friends that are not saved
[20:24] jesus died as a ransom for them
[20:27] he died to pay for their sins and let's
[20:29] pray that they'll recognize
[20:30] jesus's great sacrifice ephesians 6 here
[20:33] we'll just read one more portion of the
[20:34] scripture here
[20:36] ephesians 6 12 and 13.
[20:40] this is where sometimes we
[20:43] realize how prayer can be very
[20:45] challenging because it's a wrestling
[20:46] match
[20:48] it's a wrestling match verse 12 remember
[20:51] jesus says
[20:52] he tells us not to faint he said shall i
[20:54] find faith on earth
[20:56] shall i find prayers of faith on earth
[20:58] when i return
[21:00] why will so many uh not have faith
[21:03] because they don't have strength to keep
[21:04] praying
[21:05] so we gotta have strength to keep
[21:06] wrestling against spiritual wickedness
[21:09] in high places
[21:10] ephesians 6 12 and 13 for we wrestle not
[21:13] against
[21:14] flesh and blood but against
[21:16] principalities against powers
[21:18] against the rulers of the darkness of
[21:20] this world against spiritual wickedness
[21:22] in high places wherefore take unto you
[21:26] the whole armor of god that ye may be
[21:29] able to withstand in the evil day
[21:32] and having done all to stand amen
[21:39] tonight lord willing i'd like to just uh
[21:41] you know just do prayer a little
[21:42] differently
[21:45] i got a few i basically got seven
[21:49] things to pray about uh we'll just pray
[21:52] for them in groups so we'll start with
[21:55] uh ministers uh both the net the
[21:58] spiritual ministers and then the natural
[22:00] ministers like the government leaders
[22:03] so we'll take a few minutes we'll pray
[22:04] for the ministers that's the first group
[22:06] we'll pray for
[22:08] and then we'll pray for uh the troubles
[22:10] like the sick
[22:12] and the afflicted and the tested and the
[22:15] tried
[22:16] amongst the saints then we'll pray for
[22:18] the way words after that
[22:19] and i kind of got this outline from
[22:21] brother amen and i were talking about
[22:22] prayer one time and we kind of just
[22:25] made a prayer list here pray for the
[22:27] waywards that have been with us and have
[22:29] moved on and fallen into sin
[22:32] and shame and then we'll pray for uh
[22:37] our thirst for growing and knowledge and
[22:40] judgment and kind of like
[22:41] thirst for revelation so we'll pray for
[22:44] that by god's grace because brother adam
[22:46] says pray for that more than anything
[22:48] else he said pray for revelation
[22:50] more than anything else revelation is
[22:52] the will of god
[22:54] right so if we know the will of god
[22:57] that's the shield of faith that's the
[22:58] shield of revelation
[23:00] so when a temptation comes if we've got
[23:02] well we already know god's will for that
[23:04] we know that's wrong we can extinguish
[23:06] that dark instantly by revelation
[23:10] and then we'll pray for uh our
[23:12] fellowship
[23:14] kind of the unity of our local church
[23:16] here by god's grace
[23:18] and we'll pray for supernatural things
[23:21] after that
[23:22] by god's grace and before we get into
[23:25] these does anybody have any special
[23:27] requests tonight any uh important prayer
[23:30] requests
[23:34] nature
[23:37] okay yes wonderful so pray for uh this
[23:40] arrival of the baby
[23:44] so imagine that kind of falls under uh
[23:52] well i wouldn't call it trouble
[23:56] so i guess i'll have to make another
[23:58] section there
[24:00] so maybe uh
[24:05] just basic needs i imagine just basic
[24:08] needs
[24:10] that's a basic uh
[24:14] event of life so we'll just pray for
[24:15] that uh
[24:17] so the student's mother yep we'll pray
[24:19] for that
[24:24] i sure appreciated when everybody prayed
[24:26] for the rival of zion i really
[24:28] appreciated that
[24:29] virtue carmia
[24:33] mikey maggie okay we talked about maggie
[24:38] uh okay maggie's the one battling cancer
[24:40] okay
[24:41] so that would be a trouble right and our
[24:43] god is strong
[24:44] and he's a very present help in time of
[24:47] trouble
[24:48] so let's pray for maggie as well that
[24:51] would be under the troubles there
[24:53] and every couple groups we'll just
[24:54] invite the musicians up to kind of
[24:56] freshen us up a little bit i think i got
[24:57] that from your dad one time
[24:59] but william sent me some videos of how
[25:01] they pray in ghana and people walk
[25:03] around and shout and praise the lord and
[25:05] kind of mixes it up i know sometimes i'm
[25:07] so tired i fall asleep when i'm praying
[25:09] like real quiet
[25:11] i feel pretty good tonight but uh that's
[25:14] a good thing to do
[25:15] build up your most holy faith praying in
[25:18] the holy spirit i think that's a
[25:19] beautiful thing to do
[25:21] and a brother from minnesota showed me
[25:22] that he's a brother from the congo but
[25:24] he lives in minnesota
[25:25] he showed me a little video how their
[25:26] church does it they'll pray and then
[25:29] like individually and then every couple
[25:30] songs every couple of
[25:32] prayer requests will come up and get the
[25:33] musicians back up and
[25:35] kind of freshen everybody's perspective
[25:39] so yeah i like that let's pray for
[25:40] maggie for sure i'll also pray for that
[25:44] co-worker of brother stephen
[25:48] the dad of the co-worker with brain
[25:50] cancer
[25:55] anyone else have a need tonight haven
[25:58] okay so we'll put that under the
[25:59] waywards perhaps
[26:07] lydia okay unspoken okay we'll just put
[26:10] that under this
[26:11] the needs there may be supernatural
[26:22] unspoken
[26:28] okay so we'll start with uh let's pray
[26:30] for ministers first
[26:32] and troubles
[26:36] so we'll let everybody uh if you can
[26:38] just turn on the instrumental for a
[26:39] little bit we'll just maybe pray for 10
[26:40] minutes or so for these needs
[26:47] um so let's remember the fivefold
[26:50] ministry you know think of the saints
[26:51] there in ghana you know
[26:53] the ministers there let's remember we
[26:55] can also include brother simon coming on
[26:57] sunday
[26:58] our service on friday night lord willing
[27:00] i'll be preaching that
[27:02] i think i'm going to preach on god's
[27:04] receipt brother branham said jesus
[27:06] when he raised from the dead that was
[27:08] god's receipt for us
[27:10] so i'm gonna think i'm gonna preach on
[27:11] that i've been sitting on that the last
[27:12] few days here
[27:14] um so i'll preach my easter message to
[27:17] you on good friday
[27:20] i'll probably appreciate in iowa too
[27:22] guys just been enjoying that thought
[27:24] um and then you know just our
[27:28] our loved ones you know we think of
[27:30] brother uh brooks brother
[27:32] dennis mcbride he's going to come in may
[27:34] so he's coming up in may i got to get
[27:36] brother diggs back
[27:37] up here too i told him amen that um
[27:40] so brother keith randolph i get him up
[27:42] here too let's pray that god will guide
[27:45] our ministry here
[27:47] and then government leaders you know we
[27:49] can pray for the president vice
[27:50] president i'm
[27:51] mainly praying for them for repentance
[27:53] but also
[27:54] any way that they can help
[27:57] keep the scriptural commands that we can
[27:59] live a life
[28:01] quiet peaceable life in all godliness
[28:06] i heard they're trying to do like a
[28:08] [Music]
[28:10] mandated vaccine passport
[28:13] so they're trying to get that through so
[28:15] let's pray against that
[28:17] that doesn't help us with a quiet or
[28:20] peaceable life
[28:21] right that doesn't help us but we know
[28:24] somehow the mark of the beast has got to
[28:25] come in so you know god may have raised
[28:27] up this administration for that purpose
[28:30] you know because i never prayed any more
[28:31] than i did for the last election and it
[28:33] didn't go the way i wanted
[28:35] so you know god raises people up god
[28:37] takes people
[28:38] exactly what to pray for
[28:41] but uh i don't like that idea so let's
[28:44] pray
[28:45] that that gets stopped
[28:49] and then the sick and afflicted so we
[28:51] can pray for maggie
[28:52] coworker of brother stephen
[29:01] and hudson's skin condition right can
[29:03] pray for that
[29:18] okay well praise the lord anything else
[29:21] you think of lydia or malcolm
[29:25] okay all right we're going to play the
[29:26] i'm just going to set a timer just kind
[29:28] of as a reminder i don't want to
[29:29] be bound by time but i just kind of want
[29:30] to have a balance and pray for things as
[29:33] we feel lighter the lord
