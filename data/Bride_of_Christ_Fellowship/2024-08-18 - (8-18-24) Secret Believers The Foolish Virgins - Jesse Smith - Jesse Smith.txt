TRANSCRIPT
========================================
preach a maybe a a thought I haven't really preached often or recently but I'd like to preach on the secret Believers by God's grace as I mentioned on Wednesday John chapter 3 verse one it's good to be in the house of the Lord today good to see all the saints Hallelujah by God's grace John chapter 3: 1 as you're turning there uh the Saints from Junction City send their greetings uh we saw them Thursday night my wife and I went together it was nice little date time there to uh be together and uh got home about 12: was 12:30 12:40 boy that was a late night still trying to recover today by God's grace Hallelujah but uh they're doing really well um you know just uh trying to pray for them and ask God to minister to their needs you know they uh they've got their trials they're young believers you know I maybe I'll share a little bit about some things they're going through you know try not to use any names or anything but they're just going through uh different seasons of uh growth as a Christian praise God so they're they're doing well and I'm uh we're happy to uh to be with them praise God I told Brother Irvin as well I told I invited brother Irvin he's the eldest gentleman there and I asked him if he'd come up and preach for us in the morning and then in the evening we could do uh like we used to do the podcast you know he could sit at the table and I talk to him and record his testimony I've had a few people record I'm sorry I've had a few people request could we share their testimony how did they hear about the message how do they come into the message because it's just it's brought a lot of encouragement hope to people uh so I invited him up and he just kind of smiled and I said you just pray about it brother uh again and I told him I said you know I said brother I said I really feel like you're called to Pastor that church and he just kind of smiled you know kind of smiled looked away he's a little hesitant to do it um but we'll just see how God leads by the grace of God John 3 like to look at secret Believers of course this is looking at the foolish virgin and remember we can always draw something from this because the foolish Virgin of course it it contrasts with the wise virgin we want to be the wise Virgin by the grace of God hallelujah but this is a fresh thought I've never had this thought before as far as those two words secret believer uh brother Bram said it 23 times and so I studied all those and uh I feel like I want to preach this here hope it' be a blessing to you uh by the God's grace and church I hope like this I hope by God's grace that we run into a lot of secret Believers and that will see them in Heaven by God's grace that's that's our prayer that's my prayer brother Ram said many people will never come to your church he said they'll never come hear your pastor preach or sermon preach he said but they'll watch the ser sermon that you live that's right Hallelujah they're watching the sermon that you live the life that you live brother Bram said I'd rather have a man live me a sermon than preach me one so we want to live how you want to live a good sermon today praise God that's my prayer Hallelujah I want to live that by God's grace of course we see uh the secret believer part here in verse two I'll read one and then we can read two and three together you know give us a little bit of reading there there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews let's read on three 1 2 3 the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God notice that word see means to understand or to know Jesus said if you're not born again you can't see the kingdom of God you can't see now he was talking about the future the baptism of the Holy Ghost you won't be able to see the spiritual Kingdom the wise virgin you won't be able to see that so we see how this all ties together let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known to god father God we've prayed we've worshiped we've sang your songs Lord God now we're looking to you for the word of God lord just as you did on Wednesday night just as you did last weekend with brother Dennis Lord and the two week or two weekends before that with brother Paul and brother Aaron we need you Lord every hour we need you Lord God we need you to speak to our hearts discern our lives uh uh encourage us help us Lord God hallelujah help us to be the Christians that you want us to be Lord God we know there's a high calling there's a high purpose Lord for our lives it's to live holy it's not just to be scarcely saved but Lord It's to uh make our calling and election Shore so the whole world all our family all of our friends all of our co-workers know that we stand for Jesus Christ Hallelujah and there's no doubt about it Lord not that we go around bragging or beating our chests Lord God but we walk around with the grace of God in our hearts Lord God we walk around uh humming and singing praises unto you speaking into our or speaking to ourselves in Psalms and and hymns and spiritual songs making melody in our hearts unto the Lord so we thank you God for your mercy and Grace God bless us now as we're in your presence in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so as I said I was studying last week and um I was just I forget what I was studying I think I was studying the pastor I made a pastor video last week and and I felt like from the right side I don't know why it's the right side of my head I felt like these words come down to me secret believer and uh I was like that's right I brother Ram said that I've never really studied that I'd like to study that um to get a good understanding here and I do have some U some uh slides here Casa so I want to show these here by the grace of God now how many remember back in 2016 it's okay if you don't uh but I preached a Sunday July 17th I preached in the morning part one and evening part two now the reason I remember it is because the good doctor Scott Walker he met me at the door right there in the old Sanctuary he said brother that was a real blessing to me I never understood that before and then the good doctor his wife and uh children visit us a few weeks ago right drove all the way from Arizona of course they were coming to Kentucky to see their family but they said can we she said can we swing by and see the Smiths The Smiths you know so we got to have three days with them they were real sweet people but that's why for some reason I remember that you know you see Lot's wife there this is of course the angel pulling lot and his three daughters out of Sodom and Gomorrah and I want to just uh start with that verse there just as a refresher uh it's 1 Peter 4:17 and 18 just to kind of bring your uh thoughts here or bring these to your membrance here by God's grace 1 Peter 4:17 and 18 the Bible says for the time has come that judgment must begin at the house of God and if it first begin at us what shall the end end of them that obey not the gospel you know so over the years I've just used this verse when people ask me you know why do you dress up for church and I you know we use this verse like brother Ram taught us it's like going to court you know when you appear before a judge you wouldn't uh be disrespectful you would appear in the most respectful manner you can right I've only had one time I've ever appeared before the judge and I was only 17 and wasn't very respectful I don't think I that's why I got rebuked I think by God's Grace I was a I was a sinner and I didn't know better um I sure got a rebuke in the presence of the judge but we see here that uh the Bible tells us Peter tells us plainly judgment must begin at the house of God now there's two kinds of judgments there's a judgment against the soul that will send someone to hell but there's the Judgment that we all must have it's called the conviction of the Holy Spirit brother Dennis you know he said the Lord he said the Lord just brought to him uh he called it Chast chastisement what we call it chastisement as Believers the Judgment God gives on us is chastening and uh brother Dennis I just I don't know why it just meant a lot to me when he wrote it down he said I feel like the Lord's telling me this if God doesn't chasen us we're bastard children that and that's what the Bible says Hebrews chapter 12 and a bastard child is one that's not born into the family of God right so we want to be we want to make sure we're born into God's family Hallelujah so it's a beautiful lesson here at Peter gives us if anybody knew about God's judgment it was Peter because Jesus always corrected him right he said get behind me Satan but he wasn't talking to Peter he was talking to the spirit behind Peter right right and pet he's falling down and Peter uh he reaches his hand down pulls Peter up out of the water but at least Peter had Faith to get out of the boat praise God right uh Jesus was constantly correcting uh Everyone by God's grace but he did it in love amen that's what we do we do it with love Hallelujah so see that's where it begins begins at the house of God so God is going to correct uh correct his people first at the house of God that's where we get correction that's why it's so important not to miss Services amen right because you might miss God's opportunity to bring some correction to your life or uh it doesn't have to be judgment necessarily it could be blessing Hallelujah it could be uh wisdom discernment it could be any gift of the holy spirit so we never want to miss by God's grace that's why we talk about Hebrews 10 and about Gathering more as you see that day approaching Hallelujah and it first begins with God's people as the Bible says and I love what Peter he asked this uh question what shall the end of them that obey not the gospel what will their end be and then he brings up Verse 18 which is speaking of lot of course and if the righteous scarcely be saved where shall the ungodly and The Sinner appear so now we can see by God's grace can everybody see there's a there's a a spectrum of foolish virgins there's some that are just barely saved like uh like lot and his daughters barely saved right there's a spectrum and as we can see too uh in today there's message people that're probably right on the border of being born again and God will help them get over amen right but we know you know before the Rapture there's going to be people all along the spectrum of justification sanctification they're going to be all along the Spectrum and it's their choice they've got to walk forward amen they got to keep walking toward the Jordan Hallelujah right just like the Bible says in the Book of Joshua they had to walk all the way towards Jordan Hallelujah each one of us have a cadesh bernea right we got to come to the board line and say do I want to cross over do I want to face those giants do I want my my whole life to be wrapped up in this message hallelujah amen right that's what they were saying are we willing to go possess the land how many willing to possess the land hallelujah amen if you're willing God will take you over Hallelujah remember anyone who was willing went over Hallelujah the two that were willing went over Joshua and Caleb and of course the younger generation but the older generation that feared it and wouldn't wouldn't approach it they never went over God wouldn't let them go over but see look look how close they were scarcely lost right that's to hear what the Bible says if some people are scarcely saved then some people are scarcely lost that's just in other words just barely saved just barely like brother said just barely got in before the door closed right but the door is closing we know time is closing on human history right and some will get in right before the door closes I don't want to be that kind of person praise God I want to make sure I'm in and I'm taking a seat in the room Amen brother said when you get the Holy Ghost it's like God invites you into his room and he said he has all these pieces of instruments and each one is a gift of God and God can use you on any one of those gifts praise God I want to be in the room I want to be operating God's gifts I want to be God's servant I want to be a part of Jesus Christ I don't want there to be any questions I want everybody to know he was really saved Hallelujah not scarcely he scarcely was saved but he was really saved by the grace of God hallelujah well we all know church that's why I'm preaching we all have family members and friends right that we wonder are they saved we pray for them right we witness to them at work God please save them we run into him every day we rub shoulders with them every day at work God are they saved or not think about I think about my father you know I think of different ones in my family God are they saved or not I don't know but I know this one thing God knows Hallelujah and if I can be like Abraham amen I preach this many times but if I could be like Abraham and pray for the Lots in my life and pray that God deliver them we know God remembered Abraham's prayer so God remember Abraham seeds prayers Hallelujah that's the confidence I have I trust in God Amen My Savior amen we have to trust in God because of ourselves we can do nothing right God gives the increase amen God all we can do is water and plant encourage pray witness visit that's all we can do but God's got to touch that Soul Hallelujah God has to touch that soul and God will amen I believe it praise God so see we see people scarcely saved and brother man makes that uh comparison he said look at Abraham he was way out there he was clearly saved but lot and the daughters just barely saved as soon as they got out the fire fell so see we don't want to be in that type of a group where scarcely saved we want to be in the group that's the holy group remember there's four groups I'm going to read it again uh it's revelation 22 I believe it's verse 11 but please don't hold me to that it's been a few weeks since I referenced that scripture revelation 22 brother BR uses verse for the time of the Rapture it is 2211 okay he that's unjust let him be unjust still so here we see the four there's four types of people on the Earth brother brand calls them classes everybody will be in one of four classes now Unholy I'm sorry yes he that's unjust let him be unjust still he which is filthy let him be filthy still he that's righteous let him be righteous still and he that's holy let him be holy still all right so we're in one of those places lot was the righteous because he wasn't clearly separated amen Abraham was holy because he was separated Hallelujah everybody see that oh what a beautiful picture don't forget 17 I'm going to bring this out I think brother Aaron brought this out Revelation 2217 it's not my notes for today but it was in my notes a few weeks ago I think I mentioned it after he preached it and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that heareth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely so the point I want to make with this verse that brother Aaron made is the voice where's the voice of God at the end of the Bible it's in the bride amen the spirit and the bride say come Hallelujah that's right that means you are God's voice amen but back up how where did you get that voice you got it in Revelation 10 when the open book came down Hallelujah and the open book was revealed to brother Bram and brother Bram said eat the book right God said eat the book we're eating the book and now we become the book Hallelujah as I preached a few weeks ago eat the book you become the book you have testimonies amen you have Thanksgiving you have praise when you eat the book you give God glory Hallelujah and then you overcome by the word of your testimony and by the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah the blood of the Lamb that's right so see we got we became The Voice through Revelation 10 but remember Revelation 3 the church the nominal Church got kicked out from being the the voice right so at the beginning of this church age uh Jesus spewed out the denominations they're no longer going to be my voice so but Jesus said I'm going to give them a voice I'm going to give the bride a voice I'm going to bring down my my open seals to the the the seven Church age messenger he's going to preach he's going to finish the mystery of God we eat that book and then in revelation 22 now we're the voice of God how many believe that by God's grace i' never seen that before it's a progression that's what I that's what blessed me it's the progression revelation 3 no voice the church lost its voice Jesus has to open the seals bring it down to brother brandom and then we eat the book Hallelujah in Revelation 10 and then at the end time the spirit and the bride say come brother Bram tells us in the church age book The Spirit and the bride and the prophet are all saying the same thing and what they're saying has already been said in the holy word of God that's what I preached on Thursday night I preached the message and uh the absolute boy I laid it in heart I was kind of a Stern preacher on Thursday night but I guess it was the righteous indignation against brandom Tabernacle I don't mean to get that way sometimes but when I read the words that they say something stirs up inside of me like I just cannot hold still I I get spiritual indignation Hallelujah when they say it's all or nothing that's their quote they say it on tape it's either all the words are thus say the lord of the tapes or Nothing what a lie brother man tells us he said always be careful he said there's a human side and there's the Divine side he said but just so you know that it's the Divine side it'll speak it it'll say thus sayith the Lord amen hallelujah amen well that's enough of that all right now I don't want to go too harshly on that now I want to go back up this is a great revelation God showed me back in 2016 and that I needed this so I could write the books so I started off you know the Bible said there you're either saved or lost but then brother Ram tells us there's three kinds of Believers but by the end of his ministry now he says there's four classes and I was blown away as I read that in uh uh 2002 he said because there's two kinds of Believers you have the wise virgin and the foolish virgin okay now this is a review for most of us but this will be a blessing if you haven't read it for a while uh now the loss you got the make believer like Judas and the unbeliever brother Brown said there wasn't three crosses on Calvary there was really four now I know there was three on the hill of Calvary right but off off there in the garden where where the other tree was where Judas hung himself there was another tree that's the point I'm making I know there was only three on gtha I know that but he's he's saying the point there's actually four people that died right and so you have Jesus he was the type of the Holy uh or the the wise virgin right where's the wise oh yeah it's up top there it is and then the save Thief was the type of the righteous and then Judas was the type of the filthy and then the Lost Thief he was a type of the unjust never believed to begin with and then I read this and I remember I remember when God quickened this to me because I was in a ministers meeting Isaiah Brooks and brother Craig were up there doing the ministers meeting and I asked I I said brothers does second Timothy 2:20 let's read that does 2 Timothy 2:20 uh mean the four classes of Believers and they said well I don't know brother Jesse I've never seen that before it looks like it does I just said amen and I knew it was right because it was with the word of God right because it's the word can't contradict itself right so God gave me that fresh Revelation I'm going read verse 19 because it's beautiful for us nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure having this seal the Lord knoweth them that are his Hallelujah and let everyone that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity Hallelujah see the church this proves you're not a worker of iniquity amen if you let God clean up your life month after month year after year that proves you are no work of iniquity you are one of the saved hallelujah amen because you're actively choosing to depart I will not Le live a life addicted to sin I will overcome sin I've given power to overcome sin hallelujah amen hallelujah I've been given Authority Hallelujah we've been given that power by the Holy Spirit praise God and God knows who you are Hallelujah He Knows My Name how many can say He Knows My Name Hallelujah he knows my every thought Hallelujah he sees each tear I cry hallelujah hallelujah beautiful song verse 20 and I remember just as a young preacher but in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also wooden Earth and some to honor and some to dishonor as soon as I read that struck me there's four there's four so here we got holy righteous filthy unjust gold silver wood Earth now we're not going to read this but if for you uh if you haven't read it go read jesus' parable about the four kinds of grounds that the seed falls on there's a good ground thorny ground Stony ground Wayside ground those grounds are there Hallelujah now Church the point I'm trying to make is right here this foolish version this this uh this spectrum is is is so wide there's people that'll be almost born again like they'll come to Kadesh but they won't cross over but there'll be some people that just scarcely just barely got saved right right after the right before the Rapture I'll say like that because brother BR tells us once the Rapture happens the Gentiles are cut off that's Romans 11 so then no whatever state you're in at the time of the Rapture that's the state you remain right right so there'll be people that get saved right before the Rapture and brother said don't worry about your children he said if their names are on the land's Book of Life they'll be filled with the Holy Ghost amen he said don't worry about it he said every name that's on the land's book of life will be born again I'll say like this every name on The Book of Life will be saved Hallelujah no man can come to me except my father Drew draws him Hallelujah and Jesus said I will not lose one Hallelujah he will not lose one name what a comfort that is to us and then church you know as I started studying God opens it up and we see Abraham and lot we see Enoch and Noah uh now that's a question I don't know ra Rachel had those Gods I think she would be a type of the foolish virgin she actually died earlier too because she was cursed and I wouldn't think a I wouldn't think a type of the wise virgin would be cursed it just doesn't seem like it's uh doesn't seem like it fits the the pattern of scripture now look and she was more beautiful too so see how we didn't we preach out on Wednesday how about how Beauty Beauty got Absalon that's a man's Beauty not even a woman's Beauty right we know women's Beauty gets a lot of women U but even a man's Beauty can get him if he doesn't take care of it but there's another one Lucifer of course and then Rachel she kind of got I don't know if the beauty had a part with it but we know for sure the idolatry was there then you see Esau Esau tried he repented and tried to get it back but it was too late right and he did a lot of awful things as well we went through the history on that from the Jewish uh talid and then you Hittites never believed in the first place and I like this one Mah you have josaphat I'm sorry Jehoshaphat Ahab and Jezebel you have all these in church there's I'm sure there's many more by God's grace okay now that's the foundation there uh how many appreciate a little review there by God's grace that's my I'm not even keeping track of time this morning I'm not even going to worry about it Hallelujah I got my thoughts here now let's go um so as I was telling some of you I think I was sharing on Wednesday night you know when that thought came to me about uh the secret Believers I remember yeah brother Ram called jeras a secret believer am I saying that right jerus gyrus there it is gyrus thank you jerus jerus it's like I put a i after that R gyrus okay help me if I if I forget forgive me gyrus now you got your Bibles let's read here uh Mark 5:21 let's just read one of these you can kind of see the context here now I always told you this as some point I like to preach all the way through the four gospels I like to preach Matthew Mark Luke and John that's going to take some time and the Lord would really have to Tar for me to do that if it takes me 20 if it takes me 31 sermons to get through Romans it's going to take me about 300 to get through the gospels by God's grace so just you know all these fresh Revelations you know pop up as you're studying and it blesses the people and it's really God just feeding his children right it's God feeding his children now this A Beautiful chapter in verses 1 through 20 Jesus Jesus heals uh the maniac of G gadera right gadera he's got over 6,000 no I'm sorry he had more than that no allean was 6,000 or more demons he had over 6,000 demons in him and Jesus says one word go and they go so again it doesn't matter how loud you shout doesn't how loud you scream it's the faith that you have in Christ it's faith in Christ that makes the demons tremble it's not emotion I've had to learn that lesson too it's it's not how loud I scream Dre now it is how sincere I am but how sincerely right I am because you can be sincere and sincerely wrong right so you have to have sincerity and truth and uh then you know as The Story Goes verse 21 and when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side much people gathered unto him and he was nigh unto the sea and behold there cometh one of the Elders of the synagogue gyrus by name and when he saw him he fell at his feet now here we get to see he was a ruler of a synagogue now synagogue is a lot like a local church it was like the Jewish synagogue where it was like a a building where they would go and the Jews set it up to kind of have just a place that was close to them so they could go worship together on Saturdays right and they would know it's it's like in Luke 4 Jesus got up he read uh the scroll he sat down of course it would have been laid out on a table but then he sat down so that was their they would do songs no doubt they do prayers like we do no doubt they do their Bible reading uh they would read Moses you know they'd read their Prophet Hallelujah uh and gyrus was one of the rulers so brother R kind of dramatizes maybe he's like the pastor so he's like a pastor of a Jewish church but brother Ram said he's like a secret believer in Jesus right because Jesus was like this Rebel priest you know we heard that song One Sunday's coming he was like a rebel priest he was calling all the the regular priests uh you know vipers serpents Snakes in the Grass he he was saying they're Hypocrites they only like to be greeted in public with their fancy titles and they only like to wear nice new clothing n Jesus uh tore them up now verse 22 we see he's so he's so in need of God that he falls at jesus' feet now notice God doesn't correct him because Jesus was God remember Cornelius fell at Peter's feet what' Peter say get up right remember in revelation 22 uh John falls down at the feet of this this Angel messenger and Angel messenger says getet up Peter I'm sorry no get up John right get up John so this proves Jesus was more than a man Hallelujah he was God and man Hallelujah he was the god man verse 23 and besought him greatly saying my little daughter lith at the point of death I pray theee come and lay thy hands on her that she may be healed and she may and she shall live and Jesus went with him and much people fed him and thronged him this is what I love about Jesus even as he's going about just just just going about his ministry he's even on the way to Healing he's healing right all the time wherever he's going Jesus constantly healing and ministering to people all along the way praise God and he and look he had enough time to do that by God's grace he had enough time he knew he was going to go heal gyrus his daughter but even going along there he could heal this one he could heal that one all along the way he was healing people thank God for that type of Savior amen church we should know that Jesus at any moment can stop down in our little busy life and minister to our needs too praise God he's got enough time amen hallelujah he's got enough time amen we just got to call on him right we just got to go to him draw nigh to him sometimes now sometimes you can't do it some times God will come to you but here as we see in the scripture uh here many times people went to him they drew nigh to God and then God would draw nigh to them verse 25 and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years imagine that 12 years God why is why isn't my prayer been answered it's been 12 years because God has a perfect time and season and notice she didn't give up after 12 years and the church said Church don't give up on God Amen don't give up on God there's another one he was she was bleeding 38 years or I'm sorry the man was paralyzed 38 years God help us may God strengthen us may God encourage us not to give up Hallelujah remember God's writing a story he's the author and finisher of your story Hallelujah this was part of the woman's story you know she's uh like I was talking to that young brother uh I saw Pastor Paul Jackson a couple weeks ago I was talking to his oldest son RJ and he you know last year when we were there he heard his one leg leg well we went back and he hurt his other leg and I said R.J don't fret this is all part of God's story you have to accept this God allowed this you know he was trying to play semi-pro football and had all these dreams I said don't give up your dreams God might be in that too you never know but you have to accept this God allowed this this is part of my story God was this didn't surprise God right God said let you wake up that morning and let you go and before you got heard and all those things God was with you before God's with you now he'll always be with you praise God it's part of your story we got to understand our story remember the queen of basba her whole story was to cross the desert and be ready to pour out her support on the ministry of the hour amen her whole life was building to that amen her whole life was just being able to cross the desert and to go support the man of God I mean that was what her whole story was and God will use her on the day of judgment for that praise God hallelujah that was her major uh goal she had to accomplish in her life church what's your major goal you have to accomplish in life you might have already passed it you might not have the main thing to do is trust God serve God support the message of the hour with all your heart praise God recognize you might have to wait 12 years 25 38 like Abraham 25 right you might have to wait many years remember Anna and uh Anna and Zechariah no it wasn't Ze no it wasn't Zechariah Simeon Anna and Simeon they serve God fasting and praying in the temple for decades 70 60 60 years praying and fasting waiting for what for what all these years the devil could said you did it for nothing you did it for nothing but God had a special testimony at their end of their life they would see the Lord's salvation amen not just by faith they'd see it by sight hallelujah amen they would see the Lord's salvation with their own eyes was it worth it all every prayer was worth it was every fasting worth wor it every Miss meal was worth it why cuz God has a story God's writing a song this is my story this is my song your duty is to praise God all the day long praise God 12 years of bleeding verse 26 and it suffered many things of many Physicians so she could have said I was hurt by that preacher I'll say like that I was hurt by that song leader I was hurt by that Deacon I was hurt by that school teacher I was hurt by that professor she could have said I was hurt I was hurt I was hurt I was hurt she could had all these excuses to sit at home and not go see Jesus ah but Church who brought us here God brought us here to meet Jesus amen she wasn't hurt one time she was hurt many times see Church you have to understand God's writing a story in your life and God will not give you something you can't handle Hallelujah though you st stumble and fall get up again because I Stumble fall we all stumble and fall am many doctors had let her down but she's about to get to the right doctor amen this doctor wasn't going to let her down amen this doctor was going to lift her up Hallelujah in more ways than one Hallelujah that's right spent all that she had she' wasted all of her money she could say they've hurt me they' stolen money from me they've done every evil thing to me but still she said I can't I can't uh look at what commands unto me I've got to trust in God hallelujah I won't let my life just go to a despair of all the pain and the lost the money I've lost the people that discouraged me I won't let that Define my life I'm going to get to Jesus I'm going to let Jesus redefine my life amen hallelujah I didn't know I'd preach on her this morning amen this is all kind of fresh amen hallelujah that's not of my notes and she got nothing better but worse so all she could say for 12 years I've been going and I only get worse after 12 years that's part of the story because God was going to heal her and make this part part of her testimony that now our sister can come up our sister with the blood issue now she can come up and say my my my sick friend let me pray for you that's okay if God didn't hear you just stay with Jesus I waited 12 years and may God give you patience to get through your trial right that that's a test testimony of Faith that's right amen see now that she'd overcome 12 years now she can minister to somebody else amen amen hallelujah that's why you go through trials so you can minister to people that have similar trials that's right and you can also feel uh you can also feel for them brother B said you'll do the most effective prayer when you have a feeling for the person you're praying for that's when you'll be most sincere in your prayers that's why it's one reason we got to suffer sometimes when she'd heard of Jesus came in in the press behind and touched His Garment verse 27 verse 28 for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be whole and straightway the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague amen sometimes God lets you feel it praise God sometimes he'll let you feel it other times you won't like that brother Danny out there in in Iowa he said while he was driving he realized the tingling was gone he said darling what should I do start praising God you can praise God while you're driving I've done it before now sometimes I get a little loose on my driving so I got to correct myself we all do that sometimes right you got to be careful but praise God worship God for what he's done verse 30 and Jesus immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him touched him about in the press and said who touched my clothes see here again Jesus didn't know all things his human body didn't know all things the god inside of him knows all things right because it's God it's ch I'm sorry it's God was in Christ reconciling the world himself but even Jesus's human mind and uh it didn't understand didn't know all things because he wasn't lying Jesus never would lie he wouldn't say who touched me but I know who touched me and his disciples said unto him thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou who touched me and he looked round about to see her that had done this thing but the woman fearing and trembling knowing what was done in her came and fell down before him and told him all the truth now this is what I love I love the Bible said she felt it in herself and then she knew in herself what had been done in her I think that's a beautiful statement if God's ever healed you you know what's happened in your body and you know you're better but let's apply that spiritually amen how many know in your so in your mind and in your soul you feel different than you used to Amen in other words you know what Jesus has done inside of you amen you don't need anybody to tell you about it you don't need to tell anybody about their experience you've got your own experience amen I know how I felt I know I was lost I know I was depressed I know I was discouraged I know I was hurting but Jesus did something in me and now I can tell somebody about it I can feel the difference amen glory amen I can feel the difference praise God let me testify when is it my turn to testify that's what I feel like when I'm around these uh other believers that are non- message people I'm like when's it my turn to testify give me a turn you need somebody to testify I'll go testify when is it my turn to speak Hallelujah I know what's done inside of me I know the change the Bible said I was dead in sins but that means now I'm alive in Holiness Hallelujah Glory if I was dead in sin now I'm alive in righteousness hallelujah oh hallelujah thank you Jesus amen hallelujah virtue went out of him I've had many a service where I left here really really tired and not because I didn't sleep well but because somebody got healed somebody got ministered to I've been many a Monday at work when I have to battle falling asleep because I'm so tired after preaching twice and virtues gone out from me praise God right it sometimes it surprises me I'm like oh am I so tired I got remember that's right somebody's prayer got answered Hallelujah that's right church that's what Jesus said we know Jesus had virtue God of him now he's go goes on to say in verse 34 daughter thy faith hath made thee whole in other words thy Revelation how many appreciate that remember the story she knew if she could just go Touch the Hem of His Garment she'd be made well that's called Revelation that's right God revealed or made known how she was going to be healed so she went with that leading I just know it I don't know how I know it but I know it amen God let me know about it amen and so Jesus says your faith your Revelation has made you whole and that backs up what brother Ram taught and Fa faith is Works expressed you can plead to God you can ask God you can hope all you want you're not going to be made well but as soon as you get that Revelation you're going to be well hallelujah amen because it's got to be in God's time and season praise God so this was her time and season think of that 12 years she had to wait for God's time and season do you think it was worth a wait hallelujah it's always worth a wait always Glory now I'm not gonna like I said I'm not going to read all that verse 35 so while jaras I'm sorry gyrus I keep saying wrong while gyrus is seeing these healings and seeing these amazing things going on while he yet spake there came from the ruler of the synagogue's house certain which said thy daughter is dead why troubles thou the master any further and as soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken he saith un the ruler of synagogue Be not Afraid only believe look how the enemy in the midst of all these Miracles the enemy will try to bring in doubt by love this who speaks up who keeps the who keeps gyrus Faith high it's Jesus Hallelujah who's going to encourage your faith Jesus hallelujah amen who's going to keep you believing for your Miracle Jesus is going to do that Hallelujah there'll be people try to discourage and events of life it seem like it not going to work out but don't trust in man trust in God hallelujah hallelujah believe he said only believe and brother said he was walking down the road singing only believe amen the Bible said believe only but brother man said he was saying only believe only believe all things are possible only believe that brother Danny he knows he only has to believe that sister got healed of her heart condition she knows she only has to believe how many here know you only have to believe pray to God seek God get the Revelation and just believe God's revelation hallelujah amen just believe God's revelation amen that's right it's a revelation and he suffered no man to follow him say Peter and James and John the brother of of James and he come to the house of the ruler of the synagog go and seeth the tumult and them that wept and wailed greatly so you have people you have tumult you have you have weeping and you have wailing and and brother man said look the atmosphere is not in the condition it needs to be in for a miracle if you want a miracle brother R said you got to change the atmosphere that's right hallelujah praise God Amen that's why we usually wait right to the end of service to pray for the sick people because the atmosphere is at the spot where we can believe we come out of out of the world and we're discouraged or we're sad or we're we're angry uh or or we're fearful right we come out of the world with all at least but thank God we got it to church by God's grace amen despite our mind battles and so forth thank God we get here but then it takes singing it takes worship it takes prayer it takes the holy spirit being uh preached through the word of God and it brings us to a spot where we can receive God's word where the atmosphere can change where God can minister to the needs hallelujah we're finally in a spot where we can receive it hallelujah amen like uh you know and sometimes you get it before church like remember Johnny got healed up here of his ankle swelling he said he came to church God told him if brother Jesse curses that you'll get better that's what he told me remember sister uh uh Marie when she got healed of her blood issue I remember her walking in that door and going straight down she was so happy she's like I'm so happy to be in church today I think she was by herself that that day with another friend and and that's the day God healed her when we preached five identifications of the true church she walked into church with the Revelation amen that works but you can also get a revelation right in church amen it doesn't matter like I told all those people none of those people that got healed I said whatever you do go back to your seat and keep praising God don't let doubt come in now what a lesson that is with the while the man's driving away he gets healed on the drive amen it wasn't going to come in here but he had to keep praising God keep believing God keep trusting God Hallelujah the wind's going to blow hallelujah amen we don't know when but the wind is going to blow the holy spirit's going to blow on me Hallelujah the holy spirit's going to blow on you amen God's spirit is going to be poured out because saith God I will pour out my spirit on All Flesh hallelujah it's going to blow Hallelujah the wind is going to blow on me again and the church said the wind is going to blow on you again Hallelujah it's going to come Hallelujah we had such a good wind blowing on Friday on our date time we just sat down at the park we just felt the wind blow for 45 minutes straight I said and I thought my heart this may this be a type of our church experience amen I just we just noticed why it's a it's a great Breeze here the holy spirit's I'm sorry the the wind is really blowing amen let's sit down and enjoy this and church when God's spirit comes into our service let's sit down and enjoy it Hallelujah let's enjoy it praise God let's dance let's sing let's clap let's give God glory let's enjoy the Winds of the Holy Spirit praise God cuz he doesn't blow like that every day that's right there's days we got to go through suffering trials growth but there are days when the supernatural blows to the church hallelujah thank God for that verse 39 and when he was coming he saith un him why make you this a do and Weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth there he's speaking by Revelation right because she was dead she was separated right but Jesus is speaking by Revelation she's going to be made well and they laughed him to scorn and when he had put them all out he taketh the father and the mother of the damsel and them that were with him and entered in where the damsel was lying now this is all getting to a secret believer he I'll say like this he was a secret believer but after this he was no longer a secret believer Hallelujah that's right and he took the damsel by the hand and saith unto her talith Kumai now that's a Syrian word so he wasn't speaking in Hebrew in that case he was speaking Syrian in another language that's why he was speaking the language of the people right so that's why they have to give you the interpretation which is being interpreted damsel I say unto thee arise and straightway the damsel Rose and walked for she was of the age of 12 years and they were astonished with a great astonishment and he charged them straightly that no man should know it and commanded that something should be given her to eat amen now I did a lot of reading there gyrus means whom God enlightens and isn't that the isn't that the uh the example of his life didn't Jesus Enlighten him with his power there was there's death in the house amen there's death there's darkness in the house but God anointed gyrus with faith amen and when he had that Faith he he ran to Jesus he brought Jesus to the house and then life entered back in the house Hallelujah good testimony for us to believe amen hallelujah bring life into your house go get Jesus and bring Jesus's word into your house you'll see a change you'll start seeing a change when you pray over those dogs Hallelujah bring Jesus in your house amen start praying over those devices start praying over your food start praying over everything amen bring Jesus in your house Hallelujah that's right now I'm just going to read a few of these quotes I got a whole bunch of them I got like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 got a lot of quotes I'm not going to read all them just you know I did my studying beforehand I studied myself unto God approved he said I imagine gyrus deep down his heart he believed on the Lord but what he had he joined up with a bunch of unbelievers but that was the message of the hour I mean they he was in the message of the hour for that day they were dying but that's all he could join you know there's a lot of people people like that tonight they believe would like to be right here in this meeting tonight but they got their name on books that doesn't believe this so they're secret Believers he says he didn't want people to know J gyrus didn't want people to know about it there's a lot of people like that Phoenix tonight they'd they'd be right here in this meeting if the pastor wouldn't put them out of church Sunday for coming that's right they believe it but they're afraid gyrus believed too but he was afraid he believed the ministry though he was all bound up with a organization that he couldn't move that's why I told Brother coup that's I told those Brothers I said you'll never move that denomination I said brother R said thus sayi the Lord all those denominations are going to take the mark of the beast I told him go and pray for it go pray for it but it's thus sayith the lord they're never going to break up and come back to the word of God everybody see that how many glad God called you out of denomination amen I'm glad amen I'm glad thank the Lord for he strictly said that any man that hears this fanatic just might as well take your church papers and go on because you're going to be put out of the synagogue considered a a heretic all right now I'm going to skip down here he said wonder where Jesus is he said that's the way a lot of people think tonight for my social Prestige I just can't confess it like that the words the world's full of them looking to men scared of men don't fear men who can kill the body but fear Him who can kill both Body and Soul don't care what the people says church I preached 17 times to these former Amish people and their greatest fear they still battle to this day is fearing man their P the the Amish Pastor is like God if you go one thing against his inch and a half Book of Rules outside the Bible you're lost and going to hell and they lived under that fear all the time I can't wear this color I can't have a horse of that color uh I I can't I have to be sprinkled I can't be buried don't believe in Divine Healing they believed in all these lies so you can imagine the freedom that they now feel now that they they get to they get to take those papers and throw them in the trash can throw a couple matches in there too all that legalism it's burned up but they still to this day there's times they come up and say brother Jesse pray for me that will not come under the spirit of fear and the spirit of man see those demons are territorial yeah the Bible says demons are territorial they didn't want to leave Gad right what's territorial around here uh evil spirits right we get evil spirits around here hallelujah we got to overcome them by the grace of God hallelujah right they're going to keep coming back we got to keep getting stronger all the time amen got to be ready to overcome these evil spirits Hallelujah but see we can't let the fear of man or fear of anybody discourage us from obeying the word of God hallelujah I love what brother ra said I've said it before but if you ever go into a meeting or if you ever got trouble with somebody brother baham said pray before you go like Elijah before Elijah went to Ahab God said Elijah wasn't afraid of Ahab because he'd been in the presence of somebody greater amen hallelujah so friends let's fast and pray let's seek God so that no matter who we have to face face to face the Bible said if we stand in the presence of God we'll Fe fear God more than we fear man Hallelujah see this is what jerus gyrus had to overcome this I'm afraid what are y all what are the Sanhedrin going to say about me what's Caiaphas going to say about me but see God brought him to a place he had to choose God's going to bring you to a place you got to choose too butam said there's many people in town tonight riding around in big Cadillac cars up to dat in what's called in Social ranks of the world would love to be enjoying the experience of some of these poor dear people sitting in here tonight which of these Sinners wouldn't like think about Michael Jackson he died because he overdosed on uh on a drug that would make him sleep he was so possessed with demons he couldn't sleep what he would have given to be like you and and lay down at night and praise God and just fall to sleep without the help of drugs Church you're rich beyond measure amen amen we don't we don't even realize how rich we are these people don't they wish they could have peace like you have they wish they could sing like you can amen they wish they could dance and praise God and have the freedom like you can Hallelujah they wish they had that but they can't have it because they don't accept Jesus Christ see what a curse money is and riches it's a curse many times and the church said no wonder Jesus said scarcely a rich man can enter the Gates of Heaven and the Bible said it's easier for a camel to get through a eye of a needle think of a needle you seers or you uh what do they call it seamstresses think of that hole for a camel to get through that hole that's how hard it is for a rich man to get to heaven because his God is his money is that right church I'm talking about Americans I'm talking about you and me we can't trust in money we got to trust in the Living God we got to be like we got to be ready to say like job if he takes everything away from me then the Lord took it away the lord gave it to me he took it away blessed be the name of the Lord we need Faith Like That Hallelujah now brother R is dramatizing the story I'm just kind of going back in the story he said your child's going to die he said but the time had come for Action not wait till I see Jesus again or wait till a convenient time or some night I'll slip over and listen at him but the time to come for Action if there ever was a Time come for action it's now amen see so God brought gyrus to a spot he had to make an action his daughter's dead what's he going to do I'm sorry no he she hadn't died yet but she was dying see that perhaps somebody had already told him that Jesus was coming did anybody ever tell you that Jesus is coming coming at the same time he was crossing the Red Sea I'm sorry crossing the Sea of Galilee getting to him God always puts his men there just at the right time God sent Paul and Aaron and brother Dennis at just the right time how many believe that I'm G to skip ahead but jerus once he got in contact with Jesus he was a different man right he was able to just stay with Jesus he just saw the Miracles he just stayed with Jesus he became a different man so the secret believer became a public believer all right I gotta I got to move ahead not like this brother said I can see Jesus look around at Gus's house and say now father mother you come with me and Peter James and John you come too faith hope and charity you come along with me so Peter James and John represent faith hope and charity and brother Bram uses that in a spiritual way if there's to if there's tumult if there's doubt if there's fear if there there's evil spirits you got to get rid of that by having faith hope and charity and you got to change the atmosphere with faith hope and charity because all things are possible with faith hope and charity Hallelujah that's right brother brother mam gives that spiritual application there to Peter James and John Hallelujah now just so you know here's one point you'll listen to it brother R says it mainly at the beginning of his ministry but whenever the the Bible say you know Jesus used a different language and then it's interpreted brother Bram thought at the beginning it meant he was speaking in unknown tongues okay so brother Bram didn't understand so when we read that where he said uh talitha Kumi brother Ram thought at the beginning because he he had studied a whole lot he thought that was was Jesus speaking in unknown tongues but that's not exactly what it was it was a mixture of cyak and Chi called syyro syyro ciac okay so other words Jesus wasn't speaking in Hebrew to gyrus and his family he was speaking more in this common language okay I hope that doesn't uh uh confuse anybody but I'm just making the point uh because at one point Jesus or at one point brother Bram said when Jesus was on the cross and he said uh my God my God why has thou why has Thou forsaken me brother Ram said that was Jesus speaking in an unknown tongue on the cross but we know that's not the case because brother grew it he grew in the understanding and it was actually speaking in the common tongue right and that's why the Bible had to interpret it because it uh It Was Written in this uh Greek but it had to take this syro calic and put it into the Greek and then eventually got to English okay just laying that out there by God's grace all right brother said there's so many secret Believers today I think I read this one but I'm going to read again he was a secret believer he loved Jesus you know when a man gets in that shape sometime God brings him to The Showdown it's in distress when we really show our colors what we really are right now I'm talking about this now listen I'm talking about if you're a wise virgin God will bring you to a spot where you will Show Your Colors I'm a real believer amen right or if you're a foolish virgin God but you're see but you're a secret believer God will orchestrate the events of your life well you you'll finally take a public stand just you just won't pray in your own house or your own closet and then be afraid to talk about Jesus at some point you're going to have to make a stand and church the foolish virgin will after the Rapture they'll have to give their lives and not take the mark of the beast another proof look lot had to make a stand he had to say this is wicked this is abomination don't do this God brings the event church I'm saying something here God brings the events of our lives in 2024 God's going to bring the events of our lives and we'll have to decide which side we want to be on let's be on the side of the Holy Ghost filled Believers amen am let's let the trials of our lives and our reaction and our response let it be that we run to Jesus in our times of trouble we run to Jesus we're unashamed of Jesus and we bring Jesus into our life right we bring him back into our life and Jesus does Supernatural things for us like gyrus Hallelujah see God's gonna we're all I'll say like this we're all going to see our true colors Hallelujah brother William if anybody's seen it brother William and sister beatric have seen brother Jose got more experience people you might have thought for decades wow they're really believer turn out not to be I've seen it just you know in a public way and also church people been the message 40 years all of a sudden turn on the message no longer believe it they're either insane and saved or they're lost and they they they they forfeit their salvation but clearly they're not born again clearly when you're born again the Bible said Hallelujah you depart from all iniquity amen God knows them that are his Hallelujah and the Bible said they went out from us that includes foolish virgin and the make believer they went out from us because they were not of us Hallelujah see the Holy Ghost filled Believers will stick together despite trials tests sicknesses amen diseases all these things no no matter what goes on the Holy Ghost filled Saints will stick together because uh we know sheep flock together Hallelujah birds of a feather e of a feather flock together Hallelujah but God is going to make sure our true colors shine so everybody sees which side we're on how many on the Lord's Side today I never got to preach that but brother and preach that in the message of Grace it was that Moses part I missed a couple Wednesday nights ago when we had our sweet visitor page back there I didn't want to go into that cuz that might confuse her a little bit but brother Bram said brother Bram indicted the generation and he said this generation's guilty of crucifying the word they crucify women with long hair they crucify the water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ They Crucified God's one person and brother said I stand like Moses and he said he who's on the Lord's Side let him come and stand with me and this word hallelujah because remember Moses did that when he and Joshua come down from the mountain and everybody was dancing a filthy rock and roll and the church said he said he that's on the Lord's Side let him come stand with me in this word and brother man said if you come stand with me I'll meet you in the morning he said I say in the name of Jesus Christ come stand with me in this word and this Revelation the group that doesn't crucify the word they crucify the lust of the Flesh and the affections thereof this is the Lord's Side I'm glad to be on the Lord's Side amen come stand with me on the Lord's Side Hallelujah because you got two sides in the church got the church that's dancing playing along dirty filthy things but then you got the side that knows what's right and they're standing on the truth oh they're standing with the prophet of God hallelujah brother R says it in another way this might help you too that's why I thought I wouldn't show these if I didn't think if I didn't think it would help you I want to help you by God's grace I've always thought that gyrus was a secret believer he believed in his heart kind of a borderline believer now just so you know brother ram calls Jesus God's Eternal son but remember in the church age book brother Ram corrected that so I'm giving you a good lesson on rightly dividing the word of truth brother said Eternal son the word son already it based upon the definition says you had a beginning you came out of your father so brother man said Jesus can't be the Eternal son because a son has a beginning everybody with me it might be a little deep so then we find out if a man's really sincere in his heart because let me get back to that that's a trinitarian Dogma that's a trinitarian word look it up in your Bible look it up type in uh Eternal son so you just got to go to your app right there's no that say Eternal Son of God none there's a there's scriptures that say God's given us eternal life and this life is in his son but there's no verse that said Jesus is the third or the second person the Eternal Son of God you won't find it in the Bible that's a man-made Creed right that's a contradiction a son has has to have a father has to have a beginning a son came out of somebody a son's not Eternal the church said we find out if a man's really sincere in his heart God will work something around so that he will have to make his color shine God usually does that at times Hallelujah God's not going to let you just be a secret kind of believer God's going to bring uh events and situations to show everybody which side you're on he did it with Co look how many people fell out of church during Co and haven't come back is showed their colors I'm glad I'm still in the house of God am this is where judgement starts now in this in this quote I want you to be careful God doesn't force himself on others but he forces each person to decide which side they're on just don't s what his words here gyrus he was a Seeker believer down in his heart he believed that was the son of God he was thoroughly convinced it was you know isn't that strange God forced him to the issue God knows how to force you to the issue sometimes he gives you sickness and everything else Lord why I'm sick and I got this problem and I got that Pro and that God brings all that just to bring you to a force to show your color to make you decide which side you're going to stand on Amen but I've already decided I'm standing on the side of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah see said gyrus had probably been studying the scriptures he was a secret believer he was the ruler of the synagogue that means he had the keys to the church he could go in there anytime time he wants I'd like to unroll this scroll then when he saw that oh he saw Jesus that's that this is that like Peter said this is that Hallelujah he probably studied the Scrolls and see where Jesus met all those requirements and he was that Prophet That was supposed to be raised up according to Moses that was Deuteronomy 18 but he couldn't make his confession because anybody that made a confession that had been with uh been out with Jesus well right then they was ex communicated now I don't think he was a priest but he was a ruler of the synagogue could have been a priest I don't know but the Bible just calls him a ruler of the synagogue remember synagogue wasn't the Temple of Herod totally different Temple of Herod was massive huge that's where uh the high priest was this is just like a little local church this is like a little local church in akan Ohio the small little humble place a little flock brother that's all it is that it's not some great big place it's a small humble little gathering of Believers and then of course you know brother called Nicodemus a secret believer that's what we read today now we read John 3 now notice he's a secret believer when does he come to Jesus by nighttime and like I said to you some people won't come to church but at night time they'll send me a text and ask about service right they'll send me an email after church how was service today brother Jesse can you pray for me I'm sick and all these things yeah I wish you would have come to church right but secret believers they won't just come out and say I'm standing with brother Austin I'm standing standing with uh brother Patrick and brother Claude I'm standing with sister who I'm standing with brother amen I'm standing with brother they just won't they don't have enough strength to come out they're afraid something that's happened right they believe but they just don't have enough Grace I'll say like this they don't have enough virtue where's virtue they don't have enough virtue to come out because that's the public strength you have see Ruth had that virtue in front of everybody she's not going to file those uh what do they call them snickle Fritz teenage boys brother BR calls it snickle Fritz you got to follow she's going to stay right with what Naomi said Hallelujah I'm stay right I'm do exactly what she said I'm going to honor the lord of the Harvest amen till he marries me Hallelujah now now remember but notice this he was a secret believer and Jesus even rebuked him he said how can I enter into my mother's womb again and be born again and Jesus said you're a master in Israel and you don't even understand these things this proves church if you're a really elect of God there's no rebuke that can turn you away from church Jesus himself rebuked Nicodemus to his face you're a master you're a Believer you're a pastor you're a song leader you're a deacon you're a trustee I'm just any any name now any name you're a mother you're you're this you're a grandfa you're a message believer all these decades and yet you don't understand this see a child of God can be corrected by God Amen because he's his child amen he knows who his dad is amen hallelujah so he can take a correction cuz he's not a bastard child he's a real child of God I'll say like this at least he came at least he sent a text at least he stopped over at our house Hallelujah they might not come to church it might not even look like it but at least they came to hear the word of God at least they come to you to try to get some prayer or something like that now I love this in John 7:50 that's right I got control here of the screen Nicodemus saith unto them he that came to Jesus by Night being one of them doth our law judge any man before it heareth him and know what he doeth they answered and said unto him art thou also of Galilee search and look for out of Galilee Rises no prophet and every man went unto his own house so see Nicodemus was standing up for him he started standing up for him here right he been to Jesus personally he went by night remember he said we know you're a teacher set from God we know the message is right we know you just preached the Bible brother Jesse we know all your doctrines come out of the Bible amen we know you're right we know you got the real Spirit of Christ but see God brought it to a point you're going to have to make a choice God's going to force you to make a decision aren't you glad he does that like we're saying God don't let people hang on the fence God God's going to push you off the fence if you don't make it well you'll jump off the fence either way Hallelujah he won't let you stay there he's going to let the winds blow and you're going to have to make a choice which side of the fence you want to be on praise God am like that one joke says the fence belongs to the devil so if you look at it like that well then you can say on the fence but the fence is the devil's he caused division anyway and then John 19:39 this is a beautiful story after Jesus Cru CR ified who's who's the one that wants his body who wants the word of God it's Nicodemus brother Austin where were his disciples you would think if anybody loved Jesus and wants his body and makes sure he gets buried it would be the disciples they ran away I'm just showing you look God brought it down to a place he had to show his colors Hallelujah now look all those Apostles the Disciples of 11 of them were going to get the Holy Ghost but they didn't have it yet but look Nicodemus had more courage in that moment he had more courage than the disciples that had been with him three and a half years Nicodemus hadn't even been with him at all and yet in that moment God allowed him to have strength God gave him a testimony praise God see when others wouldn't be there Nicodemus was there praise God that secret believer became a real believer Hallelujah sometimes in great classic Society there's secret Believers great multi-millionaires yet they're secret believers they might be Catholics they're just kindy kind of afraid to associate themselves Nicodemus was one of those type remember he was a leader of the Sanhedrin he was one of those 70 70 he was one of the most esteemed or respected men in all Israel but he came by night and said we know God's God is with you you're doing things that no man can do he was a secret believer brother said just humble yourself down always remember the Way Up Is Down With God he that humbles himself God will exalt he that exalts himself shall be brought abased just just humble down come on down get it the same way the rest of them does hallelujah just the humility we have to go to Jesus right we have to Humble ourselves now here's a little bit of history on Nicodemus oh yeah actually I'm not going to read all this yeah I just put there I read it somewhere Nicodemus was wanting the body of Jesus in the moment when the disciples were scattered see church let me just say like this see God has a special moment for you that will distinguish you from other people in other words God has a special Ministry for you that's different from me right the disciples they were going to have a beautiful ministry right they were going to have Apostles and yeah they're going to have to to die too but look here Nicodemus gets a he gets a testimony well when everybody else fell away I wanted the body of Jesus I wanted to respect the word of God he was the word right that's part of his testimony like the queen of the South Hallelujah like the woman with the blood issue that's why brother R said find yourself in the Bible Hallelujah find your testimony in the Bible Hallelujah and let that encourage your faith Hallelujah encourage you to keep pressing on because Nicodemus stood for Jesus when everybody else ran in fear what a testimony Hallelujah now here's this is interesting now I'm not saying this is true history but this is one historian said the Jewish history says that Nicodemus he was wealthy but because he became a Christian his family fell into poverty think about that he was rich but because he Jewish history says because he stood for Jesus he and his family became poor so see Church see how he would have been tempted oh you better not be a believer you better not be a message believer you're going to lose all your money but what did he decide he decided I'd rather be poor and have Jesus then be rich and be a secret believer and the church said the gospel doesn't always make you rich the gospel doesn't promise uh financial prosperity it doesn't he's the proof he was willing to give up all his riches all of his wealth to serve Jesus Christ that's Faith that's a Time tested Memorial as brother random priest amen that's a memorial Hallelujah he's willing to give it all up give up all his money all his social Prestige all his Cadillacs we say he's willing to give all that up so he can know Jesus and know Christ crucified Gia he wasn't in the word for his day but remember he never blasphemed that word he stood for the children of God in a time of trouble acts 5:33 you remember this you got your Bible you want to read it you're welcome too and when they had heard that they were cut to the heart and took counsel to slay them then stood there up one in the council a Pharisee named gilia now look church he had to stand up Church you're going to have to stand stand up sometimes when everybody else is sitting down going with the crowd you're going to have to stand up and say something I'm talking to you school children right talking to our children when you go to school you got to stand up for Jesus I got to do it too you homeschoolers you got to stand up for Jesus everybody else is going to be sitting down they're they're going to let this evil thing happen but you got to stand up you got to tell the truth you got to stand up for Jesus that's what Gia did they were going to go kill Jesus's apostles but he stood up and he he keeps them from doing that he talks them out of Killing Them verse 35 he said to them ye men of Israel take heed to yourselves what you intend to do as touching these men for before these days rose up theudas and then in verse 37 rose up Judas he said and they basically came to not go to verse 38 and now I say to you refrain from these men and let them alone for if this counsel or this work be men it will come to not but if it be of God ye cannot overthrow it lest happily ye be found even to fight against God Amen Hallelujah he knew now look he was he was a Pharisee he was a doctor he knew all the intellectualism he knew there something different about that move and brother Ram said see every move of God has Supernatural healings amen every move of God has Miracles the spirit of God they've got Revival praise God hallelujah I've seen you know as we prayed and worshiped these last few years I've seen Revival here that I never saw that level in Pentecostal churches I certainly never saw it when I was at the chapel and uh other Catholic or Baptist Churches I've been to I've seen Revival in other words the Revival is on the message of the hour praise God brother said the Revival I read it Wednesday night the Revival is on the coming King David David's coming into power Jesus is coming into Power the millennium's coming so the anointing is on Christ the anointing is on the message of Christ that he's coming hallelujah amen that's right church this is the message of the hour praise God I just heard a Lutheran preacher it's a pretty good sermon but it's not the message of the hour there's more to believing than there's more to Salvation than just being saved Hallelujah yes you're saved but God wants you to go on into sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's right now look at this this proves brother William I didn't know this gilia died 18 years before the destruction of Jerusalem so 52 ad he died Titus came in 70 AD this proves God wouldn't let him die with the wicked to me this proves he was truly a foolish virgin God spared him from the Wrath remember Josephus J Josephus wrote about it he said blood was flowing out of the Jewish herod's temple it was so bad what Titus the Roman govern or the Roman Emperor did I'm sorry Roman general in 8070 it was so awful God brought all this destruction on Jerusalem because they rejected Christ thank God that the wrath of God has passed us because we've accepted Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but the same wrath is coming for this world in the Great Tribulation period because they rejected Jesus Christ as I said they crucify the word of this hour Jesus Christ's message for this hour I'm almost done now brother talking about Matthew 25 this is this great portion of scripture that I was even looking at emails V and I were send him back in 2020 he's not in here right now V and I were emailing back and forth I've told you just as honestly as I could be I've tried to be as honest as I can about this topic brother Ram said in Matthew 25 it does not say a Shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but it is as a Shepherd dividing sheep from goats goats these are not sheep in this particular area of time the white Throne judgment the Sheep are in his fold they have heard his word and they followed him they already have eternal life and cannot come into the Judgment so let's go to Matthew 25:31 I'm almost done like I said at Junction City you know out in the world people could watch a three-hour movie and they could just they never fell asleep right I've seen some of those people talk after church for two hours and they never fell asleep right so let's wake up by God's grace if we need that by God's grace that's what I'm saying I'm just saying you know this should this should encourage us this should interest us you know the word of God should right Hallelujah Matthew 25:31 I I go through it too like I told you I got to stand up when I get tired I got to stand up go get some water I had to do that last weekend my brother D was preaching I was kind of tired when the son of man verse 31 shall come in his glory and all the Holy Angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a sheep divided his uh sheep from the goat so notice brother said as a Shepherd as sheep brother Bram said really though they weren't real spiritual sheep because the spiritual sheep followed Jesus during their lifetime publicly right remember my sheep hear my voice there it is right there and a there it is a stranger there will not follow there it is amen I I didn't didn't strike me till right now see the Seeker believers they can go follow another church and hear a different voice cuz they're not sheep right they're going to be saved but they're not sheep sheep Follow The Voice sheep follow the shepherd sheep abide in the vine sheep abide with the shepherd we abide with Jesus Christ the great Shepherd Hallelujah cuz we're the Sheep now Hallelujah am they get eternal life These Foolish virgin but they were not the Sheep of God during their lifetime because they can follow listen they can follow a denominational voice and the church say it's beautiful this is a great Revelation but these do not have eternal life and they are in the Judgment they're allowed to go into eternal life but upon what grounds do they enter into eternal life certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his Brethren they are not his Brethren that would have made them joint HS with Jesus they are not heirs to anything but life they share No Throne Etc with him their names must have been in the Book of Life and not removed now because of their love of the people of God they're recognized and saved no doubt these served and helped the children of God perhaps there's that perhaps remember I preached that many times it's a perhaps people ask me are the are these people going to be saved or these people are going to be saved I don't know I've said perhaps because that's the best that I knew but now based upon this understanding if anybody's going to be saved they had to and they're not in the bride and they're surprised on the day of judgment they had to have been a secret believer does everybody understand because you have to repent in order to be saved and we see the Simplicity of repentance on the the cross when the saved Thief says Remember Me Jesus when you come into your kingdom that is the Simplicity of just being a brand a baby Christian right you're only justif ified Remember Me Jesus see he'd already confessed in his heart you're you're holy I'm Unholy I deserve this you don't deserve this see that so now the Revelation has come anyone who saved at the white Throne judgment they were saved in life but it was a secret believer they didn't tell anybody or they told very few people that's why they're surprised look at verse uh 34 then shall the king say Toto them on the right hand Come Ye blessed my father inherit the Kingdom for prepared for you from the foundation of the world for I was hungered and you gave me meat I was thirsty and you gave me drink I was a stranger you took me in naked and you clothed me I was sick and you visited me and I was in prison and you came unto me Hallelujah then shall the righteous answer him saying Lord when saw we thee hunger and fed thee or thirsty and gave thee drink when saw we thee a stranger and took thee in or naked and clothed thee oh isn't that that's what Nicodemus did there it is he was naked on the cross Hallelujah and Nicodemus clothed him Hallelujah Glory now I believe Nicodemus became a real believer that's what it looks like cuz he got poor the only way we got poor as if he denied his former Jewish faith but look at that that proves he was a real believer or a secret believer he saw the naked body of Jesus and he want to wrap it up clothe it up put the spices on naked and you clothed me and Jesus said when you done the least of these you've done it unto me Hallelujah perhaps like Nicodemus and gameo they stood for the children in a time of trouble now verse 39 or when saw we thee sick or imprison and came unto thee and the King shall answer them and say unto them verily I say to you truly I say unto you in as much as you've done it unto the one of the least of these my brethren you have done it unto me the least of the Saints Paul said he's the least right if if someone's done one good thing to the least of the Saints they've done it unto Jesus and remember brother brandham had to grow in this look up look up brother Sher brother Shar corrected brother Bram and said brother Bram you better start taking gifts from people because they're going to get a blessing brother Ram's like yeah you're right I wouldn't do it before he said brother sherck corrected me on that and this is this is this is the key we have to let now don't get selfish don't let this overflow into je selfishness and jealousy you know and and covetousness that's the word don't let it go into covetousness but if people want to do something nice for you you got to remember that God's going to remember this and God's going to put it on their Heavenly account that's Philippians chapter 4 says Paul said I received your gift because it'll go to your account he said not that I had to have it or even I asked for I didn't even ask for it or want it but God will put it on your account so think about people that have got done good things unto you when they did it to you they did it unto Jesus and this is what Jesus will use as evidence remember this is evidence out of the books that are open here's the evidence this person's a Believer because they went and visited let me pull that up there because they went and visited some brother in prison some sister they fed the the hungry brother a hungry sister they clothed the the the person that didn't have much clothes they took somebody into their house they gave them drink when they're thirsty they visited the sick Jesus said see these are are these are proofs these are proofs of your faith because faith brother Works faith without works is the dword Dead the Bible said if you don't have any Works behind your faith it's dead it's not real Faith these people had Faith because they worked Hallelujah but it was a surprise they they were secret Believers and so they're surprised on the day of judgment how when did I do this to you when did I they didn't even know that Christ was in his bride amen but that's all we've been preaching for 40 50 years brother is that Christ is in the bride amen it's Christ in us the hope of Glory Hallelujah it was Christ in the bride through each of the seven Church ages now it's Christ in the bride here in the time of Lea we've known that the whole time but these are the day of judgment they didn't know that they were foolish virgins they were secret Believers but Jesus saw amen God Jesus saw their secret works and rewarded them openly amen there it is man oh that's right that's right amen brother said these people were separated wasn't Gia Nicodemus they were separated from everybody they stood up they stood against those things trying to abide the word according to what they knew of it and being a help in the work of the Lord will come up at the end time they'll miss the Millennium right we preached on that this summer amen you don't want to miss the mill it's more important and wonderful than you could ever imagine brother Bram said g was a good teacher brother Bram said g used wisdom he said good things about him see I believe these now now I have an understanding all these years I've waited for this it feels like I've never understood this how could they be surprised because they didn't recognize Christ and his bride they weren't mature believers they didn't even know that Christ was in the church and whatever they did to the the church that's how they would treated Christ remember Peter said Peter said you didn't lie to me he said you lied to the Holy Ghost remember that that's proof If you lied to a Believer you lied to God is that right look at that that's why they died because it wasn't Peter it was God behind Peter amen May each one of us recognize God behind the veil of our Badger skins hallelujah it's God behind you it's God behind me it's God behind us that's why we must be careful how we treat each other is that right see that's fresh revelation I never caught this till this last week and even now as I'm preaching three things have dropped down I need to hope this is recorded you if not I'll be praying God restore those three thoughts I know you're faithful you can bring them back to me things I never put together never understood these are believers because remember they got to be judged out of the books the books recorded their works and works come from faith and faith comes from Love Love worketh by faith I'm sorry faith I'm sorry Faith Works by love thank you faith has to work by love so it all goes back to love they love Jesus they just didn't know who jesus' bride was they were secret Believers remember church I said this earlier you're going to be judged too not Eternal separation but you're going to be judged by The Works you did this this says every I preach Romans 14 to you I already preach it you're judged you're going to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ let's read it second Corinthians 5 uh I didn't put the verse it must be 10 and 11 I must forgot to type 10 and 11 there we'll see second Corinthians 510 no no that's not oh no second Corinthians 5 okay I'm in First Corinthians 5 there we go I see now there it is yes amen hallelujah for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad See We call we call it the Judgment seat for rewards right brother William that's what we've called it over the years it's a judgment seat of rewards and that's what the Bible says remember Jesus said if you believe you've already passed from judgment right right we've already passed from Death un life so we won't go uh we won't be sent to hell we understand that but we also have to answer for the Deeds that we do in this body because the works that we did were based upon our faith and Faith was motivated by love second Corinthians 5:11 knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto God and I trust also are made manifest in your Consciousness so see we should manif EST we should manifest the character of Jesus Christ to one another Hallelujah see we're judged for our works for rewards not for separation from God everybody see that think about your works now it's always easy with you mothers and fathers your works are to raise children that's your works like brother Bram told that uh remember Mrs Ford she was a black sister she died and brother was talking after her funeral and brother Bram said wasn't she the best wife she could ever be to her husband he's like yeah you can hear on the tape yes sir and she asked her her sons wasn't she the best mother she could be they're like yes my and look he said sister for did everything that God asked her to do she did what God called her to do in the Simplicity of the word of God let's find what God has called us to do and do what God God's called you to do hallelujah look at these examples we got here jerus Nicodemus do what God's called you God like in all these cases God called them out of their old life into a life of following the word of the hour and then you got to take a stand when everybody else won't stand you got to stand for the truth stand on your job right s be in the pie company you got to stand for Jesus in The Pie Company I got to stand for Jesus in the Elementary bus building praise God wherever you are on the soccer team you got to stand for Jesus on the soccer team is that right Patrick that's right right Claude you got to stand for Jesus sister Anna wherever you go you going back to school this week yep you're gonna stand for Jesus there that's what God called you to do you're doing exactly what God called you to do remember some of you got to remember Jesus went to learn subjection from the time he was 12 all the way to 30 so I'm talking to lyi and Malachi here Malachi is almost an adult so even though you're at my house you might be an adult you still got to learn to submit to me and your mom don't forget don't forget your mom and they do but I'm making the point Jesus spent 12 to 30 obeying his mother and father all the time and then he even obeyed her when he she said turn the water to wine it wasn't even his time he even obeyed her there too right interesting thought there now I know I'm preaching long today but that's okay I I've been waiting to preach a Sunday for a while it's been a while since I preached a good Sunday to you I at least I felt like this is a fresh Revelations I really want to lay this in I'm making a tape this morning everybody but it is a fresh revelation we now face the question as to why should why should they the uh the the those that are good to the Brethren be given eternal life at the Judgment since the Epistles seem to conclusively point out that one must possess the spirit of Christ or perish now Paul's right there it's 1 Corinthians 12 you got your Bible 1 Corinthians 12 says if any man have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his and church I've listen denominational people use this all the time maybe it's not that maybe it's Romans 12 just give me a second here any man have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his does anybody can anybody shout that out anybody okay I didn't know if you're already there If any man have not the spirit of Christ none of his I'm look up none of his I feel like I've used this verse many times I just don't have this one that's probably it h let's see that's it thank you hun Romans 89 but ye are not in the flesh thank you casa but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man not have the spirit of or have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his look at that I've seen so many denominational preachers use this so and and their argument is see if you just repent of your sins now now you're filled with the Holy Ghost but see the Revelation is you've got the spirit of Christ in a measure you've got faith so these denominational people if they really get saved yes the spirit of Christ you have it but you got this much Hallelujah their their life proves it is a Justified person still belonging to Jesus yes but they've only got this much get you some more of that amen if you like that you're going to like the rest of it amen hallelujah and wait till you're filled with it praise God Amen and then no matter what trial you face you know God will bring you out of it Hallelujah God will give you Grace to overcome amen because Christ is sealed inside of you and Satan is sealed out hallelujah amen see this is this is great teaching from Brother here in the church age book through you know the his counsel with brother lale and some other brothers though it seems thus we must not discredit the words of Jesus who most pointedly sets forth that there are some found in the Book of Life who will either receive eternal life before the gener resurrection or after it okay so remember the book of First John says we already have eternal life that life is in his son John wrote I write to you to tell you that you have eternal life you ought to be the happiest person today if you got eternal life Hallelujah already but brother said the foolish version doesn't get eternal life here they get it over there Hallelujah that's right that's right because they go into life we just read it in Matthew 25 they go into eternal life but you've already got it Hallelujah here's a great verse Philippians 3:11 you can just read off here Paul does not evade this truth this is a beautiful Revelation for he most clearly says in Philippians 3:11 by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead so Paul's saying by any way I want to attain to the resurrection of the dead now look what brother brings out here beautiful thought now this statement is most peculiar we all know that we're all going to be at the resurrection whether we want to or not that must mean there's two resurrections and the church said like Revelation 20 says there's a first resurrection and then you just turn two chapters and then I'm sorry it's the same chapter you just read the rest of the chapter Revelation 20 you get to the second Resurrection amen glory so Paul could hardly be saying if by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the Dead the truth of the matter is he's not saying that the literal reading is if by any means I might attain to the out Resurrection from among the dead this is not the attain to the general or second Resurrection but attaining to the first resurrection of which is said blessed and holy is he who hath part in this first Resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years the first resurrection has nothing to do with the second death Hallelujah so Paul's saying if by any means I might be raptured if any means I might meet Christ in the air Hallelujah even if I die if I'm dead let me be the dead in Christ that rises first Hallelujah that's what he's saying and remember the Bible says that in in Hebrews 4 as well my all these scriptures are just roolling together the spirit of Revelation is here today amen Hebrews 4 says that you must uh you must labor to enter into that rest lest A promise is given unto you you don't attain to the promise see youve got to attain to the promise the rest is the baptism of the Holy Ghost right he's talking to Jewish Christian I'm sorry Hebrew Christians yeah je they former Jewish they former Jewish J judaizers now they're uh now they're Christians but they're still Hebrew they're still Jews in the natural and he's saying don't fail to make sure you enter into that rest there's promises that you must enter into keep going further because you want to attain to the outgoing of the resurrection of the Dead hallelujah amen you want to attain to the dead in Christ rising and the dead in Christ will rise first and then we that are which are alive and remain uh shall meet them and then will go to meet the the Lord in the air praise God I didn't quote that exactly right but you know the verse it's 1 Thessalonians 4:16 And1 17 this is at the end of the Thousand Years when all the rest of the Dead live again and in that day there will be those who come forth to eternal life and those others who are caught in the second death we do not need to guess about those who in the second Resurrection are given life we are told it is given to them on the grounds that they have been kind and good to the brethren those who are raised and cast in Lake of Fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the Brethren what about all these governments that are killing Christians like I said Iran Kenya Nigeria uh China what about all these governments killing Christians they're lost if they don't repent right they're going to be cast in Lake of Fire since this is the word of God we simply accept it there is no argument here just a simple statement of fact Hallelujah remember this remember the gibon nightes in Genesis 15 God told Abraham your seed's going to go into Egypt I'm going to bring them out and they're going to drive out all these inhabitants of their land because their cup of their iniquities Not Yet full in other words the gibeonites had a death sentence on them but what they do they deceived Joshua and the group and uh so that uh so that they wouldn't be killed right they never were the Brethren but God God forgave over 400 years of sins God forgave a cup of iniquity brother William a 400 years of iniquity God forgave that in an instant and let them live and then God made them hewers of wood for the house of God and uh carriers of waters I'm sorry jugs of water God made them workers Amen in the house of God but they would never be the bre they'd never be part of the mighty Army of God they never have the the status like Joshua had but they were good to the Brethren so God saved them God was merciful to them God gave them life Hallelujah that's a type of the foolish virgin look look God they were secret Believers right God had to bring them to make a decision you either die or you join Joshua he said I'm joining Joshua and the Bible said they feared the Lord because of that and I closed the service at cams one time and it really brought people up to the altar weeping about this and God thought so much of them that in the next chapter these are just we'd say just foolish virgins but they're still God's people in the next chapter uh I forget which which nation came against them and they called for Joshua come save us that's the moment Joshua went out there and he he was fighting and he spoke to the son and said Son stand still the only time God ever hearkened to the voice of a man like that when did he do it when he was pleading for the foolish virgin's life just like Abraham plead he pleaded for the life of lot he pleaded for the righteous church God loves that kind of prayer when God wants to see people saved when when God urges you to pray for those that may be on the fence or borderline or secret Believers God loves that kind of prayer because it's eternal life Hallelujah God thought so much of that he honored Joshua's own word and let the son stand still like I told you before does that mean the Rays of the sun just stood there and I don't know I don't know how that worked out did he make the Sun and the Earth just stand still whatever condition they were in I don't know how he did it but he did it he did it because Joshua called for Mercy Joshua was in the uh brother Adam said uh he was just in in the he was just in his duty he said when you're walking your your post of Duty he said sometimes you don't got time to pray he says sometimes you just speak the word of God Amen why Christ speak speak the word of God and go forward and God honored Joshua's prayer amen and let me just say this now over the years I've said this to church i' about Matthew 25 I said I don't know if these people were saved or they're given you know the children have asked me are these atheists that are saved well now I'd say no like before I said I don't know could be Meg and I emailed about it in 2020 I still got our email saved I was looking through that's when you remember brother bang when you used to have time to email before all these kids came along remember I'm just joking buddy I'm the same way God's bless you richly buddy but I used to think I used said well maybe maybe well now I know no it's got to be someone who's a secret believer because they have works that follow their faith they have you know you have to have faith to be saved Jesus said no man comes to the father but by me now the only exception is this brother William a Jew that's blinded will Den Jesus on this Earth but according to the fist seal Jesus will save him that's the only exception because God put blindness he cut off them but they're still under Moses Covenant they're still under a covenant promise now could God do that with Gentiles maybe I don't know I don't have a scriptural example for it I'm not trying to be God here I'm just trying to give you some scripture here by God's grace Hallelujah and I'm closing with this brother brandham was a man of Grace you should know that if you've been listening these last six sermons I preached on the spirit of Grace or the message of Grace brother Bram was a man of Grace they asked brother Bram can adulterers go in the Rapture I'm just going to skip ahead you know this I've used this before over the years brother said I don't know can they go in the Rapture he said I don't know he said uh all one thing I know that doter is not inherit the kingdom of God I don't know I can't say he said I must stay with the word of God but he says this God has made restitutions in places for people that did things wrong he talks about David eating the shoe bread uh the priest blasting the Sabbath but a greater than the Sabbath was there so he gives those two examples he said there might be a chance of you to get in So This what I love about brother brandham he never made himself a know-it-all like all these denominations make themselves know it all they can condemn this person to hell they think they know everything they don't know their hearts they don't know secret believers they weren't there see they make themselves judges they make themselves like uh Gods basically but I love this about brother R he was humble he said perhaps there's a scripture I don't know but there is a scriptural precence for God showing Mercy when things were wrong that's what I'm talking about okay that's what I'm I'm mentioning here I'm not saying adulterers are going in the Rapture I don't know but brother mam is saying God did make restitutions for people at times and look what he says just leave it up to God go on ahead just live just live for Christ now see what he saying redeem the time now amen don't fall into despair don't fall into depression live for Jesus with all you got Hallelujah make your calling election sure give all diligence to do that praise God Amen don't let yourself get carried away by The Winds of sin and I'm sorry the Waters of sin stay true to God show everybody which side you're on Hallelujah there might be a chance of you getting in two wrongs never right in one just go and live the way you are if you're happy together he's talking about the people that have been married he he said all wrongs will be made right remember this brother man told us why he chose to preach the message of Grace he it was another topic he was attacked on so they attacked brother Bram about the godhead right oh God's three persons brother bram's wrong and they attacked him on Grace too you're not a good enough calvinist you're not a good enough Armenian he said I'm standing right in the middle of the road I'm standing with the Bible he said I I'll he said I'll go on the branch as far as the Bible will let me go on your branch of of Calvinism amen but as soon as you pass a certain part of the branch there's no more scripture he said that's as far as I'll go right I'll go with you as far as the Bible lets me go but I'm not going to go into your Creeds right your traditions of men brother said then I chose this morning being that that message was so attacked the godhead another thing that I'm so gotten about after is preaching Grace I want to speak on that this morning as I read this chapter uh let's stand to our feet musicians can come I'll say it like this all men of God are men of Grace you believe that brother because we are all saved by grace through faith not of Works lest any man should boast I believe the Holy Ghost has proven it right through these recent sermons God could have killed Moses at least two times times maybe three but God showed Grace God could have killed David but God showed him Grace Hallelujah God could have done so many things God could have poured out judgments God could have done all these awful things to people but God showed Grace God is rich in Mercy Church he's rich in Grace now all this to say what I wanted to show you today was that in the foolish version in that in that group there there is a huge Spectrum in there some people are scarcely saved some people can get so close but let's make our calling and election sure let's let's make all let's let's let's answer all questions let's let every area of our life be cleaned out by the word of God hallelujah so that we can see it's not me living it's Christ in me living and when someone does something good to me they did it for Christ in me not because of me because I'm my in my own self I'm a sinner saved by grace but that's the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ he lied to Peter he lied to god let's not the Bible said lie not one to another praise God but love one another I think we read it the other day about oh brother Dennis read about we talked about last night joking around but it's true we got to be tender hearted what was the verse that you used last night remember we talked about being tenderhearted towards another vows of Mercy there it is remember we talked about that that's what we need here bows of Mercy tenderhearted toward one another having the real Spirit of Christ in our lives how many enjoyed the word although it was a little longer than normal everybody enjoy that that's a good two hour sermon see now I feel like have peace Brother William I it's off my heart I hope they sure got the tape on that because I'm want to what I can do is I can build a Bible study and if anybody has questions my well you got a lot of scripture right here this gives me a solid place to stand you have to be a believer to be saved but there will be lots of brother there's a lot of secret Believers out there a lot of people wish they could come to church but they won't we don't know remember even in your sickness someone coming to visit you that would be an expression of their faith you're low on money someone comes to give you some money they they cut their hair wear pants it's God's grace what a wonderful truth we have in the Bible today God help us to live a life that's worthy of the Gospel how many you want to live a life worthy of the Gospel let's bow our heads here father God we're thankful for today Lord God thank you for uh a patient

scriptures Lord God Lord help us as Believers first to make our calling and election sure as I was talking to my daughter Lord when we sin help us to repent and then take revenge on the enemy let us

moments lord they're sometimes allowed to happen to manifest our true colors but also the colors of the secret Believers Lord God thank you for a man like Nicodemus that can be a secret believer but then comes out to be a public believer gives up all of his money in order to serve Jesus Christ Lord I think again of that woman with the blood issue she overcome many mistreatments she overcame many years of disappointment but you gave her her Miracle help us Lord God to have patience with you Lord as your Prophet said the first thing we need is patience with God when it comes to patience help us
