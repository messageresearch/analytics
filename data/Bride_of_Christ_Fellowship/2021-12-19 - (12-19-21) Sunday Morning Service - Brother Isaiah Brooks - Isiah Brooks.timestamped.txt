[51:54] sweet
[52:11] as we stand
[52:13] thank you musicians thank you
[52:17] hallelujah
[52:21] i
[52:25] i guess you say i'm a junkie for the
[52:27] presence of the lord
[52:32] without him where would i be
[52:37] i can remember the time when i was so
[52:39] afraid to be saved
[52:41] i wanted to be a christian but was
[52:43] afraid to be a christian
[52:45] because i was afraid that i was going to
[52:46] be a failure
[52:49] but then i learned it's not me
[52:51] it's him
[52:54] and when i learned that it really set me
[52:56] free
[52:58] if the world only knew
[53:01] the grace of god
[53:03] i believe the whole world would be in
[53:04] line to be saved
[53:07] but because people don't understand
[53:09] calvary and what he did for us
[53:12] they think they have to do all of these
[53:14] things
[53:15] and really all they have to do is have
[53:17] faith in god
[53:19] and god will do the rest
[53:21] as we stand
[53:23] let us turn to revelations the fourth
[53:25] chapter
[53:26] once again we thank god for
[53:29] our brother jesse and his wife christian
[53:32] and
[53:33] the children and the family and
[53:40] i want to thank god for sister wendy i
[53:42] forgot to mention her yesterday amen
[53:45] but i appreciate her coming
[53:48] i hadn't spoke or seen her in such a
[53:50] while
[53:52] so it's a real blessing to have you and
[53:55] she's like a daughter and a sister at
[53:57] the same time
[53:58] amen i remember when wendy got first got
[54:01] saved
[54:02] she came to church and i was preaching
[54:04] i'm telling you fire and brimstone
[54:07] didn't even know she was in the audience
[54:09] she had come with brother simon
[54:11] and when she stood up i like oh she
[54:13] won't be back
[54:14] [Laughter]
[54:17] but i tell you what she came back and
[54:18] she never stopped
[54:22] i thank god for
[54:24] and she used to ask us so many questions
[54:27] i mean i mean just questions i'm like
[54:29] lord have mercy
[54:32] how she's getting that and where she's
[54:34] getting it
[54:35] but we understand amen that the the
[54:37] scriptures has to come by revelation
[54:40] that was that was our way out
[54:44] amen so we thank god for the people of
[54:46] god i've seen transformation i've seen
[54:48] people changing
[54:50] even at this point we're not where we
[54:52] desire to be
[54:53] but one thing for certain we know we've
[54:55] been traveling
[54:56] we understand that we've come from
[54:58] somewhere we're going somewhere
[55:00] amen and uh as we stand we i keep saying
[55:03] that revelation is the fourth chapter
[55:06] being a pastor of two churches no matter
[55:08] how how often i stand in this pulpit i'm
[55:11] always
[55:12] nervous
[55:13] because i realize god i've got to give
[55:15] an account
[55:16] for the things i say over this pulpit
[55:19] so it just really makes me nervous but
[55:21] it also makes me depend on him
[55:24] revelations the fourth chapter
[55:29] we'll begin reading at the seventh verse
[55:32] i'm sorry the fourth verse
[55:49] i'm sorry i get the wrong scripture
[55:56] revelations the fifth chapter forgive me
[56:02] excuse me
[56:10] i don't know when you cry i understand
[56:12] why your nose has to run but it happens
[56:17] revelation is the fifth chapter
[56:18] beginning at the fourth verse
[56:23] and i wept
[56:25] because no man was found worthy to open
[56:27] and to read the book
[56:29] neither to look thereon
[56:32] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[56:34] not
[56:35] behold the lion of the tribe of judah
[56:38] the root of david
[56:40] hath prevailed to open the book
[56:42] and to loose the seven seals thereof
[56:45] and i beheld and low in the midst of the
[56:47] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[56:49] midst of the elder stood a lamb as had
[56:52] been slain
[56:55] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[56:57] are the seven spirits of god sent forth
[56:59] into all the earth
[57:01] and he came and took the book
[57:04] out of the right hand of him
[57:07] that sat
[57:08] on the throne
[57:11] revelations 10 1.
[57:20] just read the first two verses of that
[57:22] chapter
[57:24] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[57:26] from heaven
[57:27] clothed with the cloud and the rainbow
[57:29] was upon his head and his face was as it
[57:32] were the sun
[57:34] and his feet as pillars of fire
[57:38] and he had in the in his right hand a
[57:40] little book opened
[57:42] and he set his foot
[57:44] upon the right on the sea excuse me his
[57:47] left foot
[57:48] on the earth
[57:50] one more scripture
[57:53] we'll go down to the 10th verse of that
[57:56] same chapter
[58:02] i'm sorry let's read the eighth verse
[58:07] and the voice which i heard from heaven
[58:09] spake unto me again and said go and take
[58:12] the little book which is uh opened
[58:15] in the right in the hand of the angel
[58:18] withstand it upon the sea
[58:20] and upon the earth and then that last
[58:22] first of the tenth verse and i took the
[58:25] little book out of the hand out of the
[58:27] angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[58:31] my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as i
[58:34] had eaten it my belly was bitter
[58:37] and he said unto me thou must
[58:40] prophesy again before people in nations
[58:43] and tongues and kings
[58:46] father we so thank you for your grace
[58:48] and your mercy
[58:50] we thank you for your goodness and all
[58:52] that you have done for us everything
[58:54] that you're doing for us
[58:56] you've been such
[58:58] an amazing amazing god
[59:01] awesome god there are no words in the
[59:04] english language uh which and that can
[59:06] express my gratitude towards your lord
[59:09] the more i think of you the more humble
[59:12] i i become and the more awesome you are
[59:15] lord and i pray lord this morning that
[59:17] you would bless the saints of god today
[59:19] lord god that we will uh be able to see
[59:22] and understand this amazing grace that
[59:25] you've given unto us
[59:27] lord we love you and we thank you we ask
[59:29] that you would forgive us for anything
[59:30] we may have said or done
[59:33] lord we pray that you forgive our eyes
[59:36] and everything else that may have
[59:38] been out of order in some way or another
[59:41] lord forgive us and cleanse us from all
[59:43] our righteousness lord and
[59:45] let nothing said or done hinder this
[59:47] message we ask these things in jesus
[59:49] christ's name we
[59:51] we pray amen
[59:52] you may be seated
[59:59] the subject on this morning is
[1:00:01] the book is open
[1:00:06] i have a lot to say about god's grace so
[1:00:08] i'm just going to move
[1:00:10] uh by god's grace as fast as i possibly
[1:00:12] can but i want it to be in a way that
[1:00:13] you can you can see and understand where
[1:00:16] we're going amen
[1:00:21] as we talk about last night as we preach
[1:00:23] and and i i even called brother jess and
[1:00:25] said i am so sorry i kept the people so
[1:00:28] long
[1:00:30] but sometimes you know it's like
[1:00:32] when you're at a buffet or you had a
[1:00:34] dinner you know you forget time you're
[1:00:36] so enjoying yourself and and when i
[1:00:38] preach i'm not preaching to you i'm
[1:00:40] enjoying it myself
[1:00:43] and sometimes i forget amen that
[1:00:46] uh
[1:00:47] some people you know you know the time
[1:00:49] element may bother them so
[1:00:51] i i want to be mindful of you this
[1:00:53] morning
[1:00:55] but by the grace of god we we understand
[1:00:57] that
[1:00:58] before the fall everything was so
[1:01:00] perfect matter of fact god himself
[1:01:02] called it good
[1:01:04] yes and there's only one good and that's
[1:01:06] god
[1:01:08] and you know when god compliments
[1:01:09] himself
[1:01:11] when he says amen to himself it it has
[1:01:14] to be good
[1:01:17] and so we realized by god's grace
[1:01:19] everything was in harmony
[1:01:21] everything in his own dimension was
[1:01:24] there
[1:01:25] nothing had been interrupted
[1:01:27] so much so that heaven and earth amen
[1:01:29] was able to communicate
[1:01:31] god could come down in the cool of the
[1:01:33] evening and he could talk to adam and it
[1:01:35] was a wonderful situation
[1:01:38] but we know that because of the fall and
[1:01:41] understand it was adam whose sin but eve
[1:01:43] was beguiled
[1:01:46] and the beautiful thing about that is
[1:01:47] because even in the fall of adam in the
[1:01:50] fall of e god knew that
[1:01:52] he understood that this was also a work
[1:01:55] of his own uh plan of salvation amen and
[1:01:59] adam knew that in order for him to save
[1:02:01] his wife eve he had to go out and sin
[1:02:04] against god
[1:02:05] but god understood that
[1:02:07] adam understood it yes because adam said
[1:02:11] to eve when he introduced to himself to
[1:02:13] her he said you're born in my bone in
[1:02:16] flesh of my flesh
[1:02:17] and he also went on to say that when a
[1:02:20] man finds a woman he must cleave to her
[1:02:23] and leave his father and his mother and
[1:02:26] at that time there was no fathers and
[1:02:27] mothers
[1:02:29] so adam knew amen that eve would fall
[1:02:32] and then by her falling she would become
[1:02:35] a mother
[1:02:36] and there would come a father because
[1:02:39] understand when they were to create and
[1:02:41] when they were to speak uh
[1:02:44] into existence amen children those
[1:02:47] children would have been brothers and
[1:02:48] sisters
[1:02:50] and this is why we marry our brothers
[1:02:51] and sisters because over yonder we all
[1:02:54] are brothers and sisters
[1:02:56] so we must understand by god's grace it
[1:02:59] was such a harmony
[1:03:01] but when adam and eve fell it brought a
[1:03:03] breach
[1:03:05] it the breach was so great till actually
[1:03:08] the dimensions that god had set in order
[1:03:11] was disarrayed
[1:03:13] because remember the bible said that
[1:03:16] hell was made for
[1:03:18] satan
[1:03:19] and his angels
[1:03:21] hell was not made for the sons and
[1:03:23] daughters of god
[1:03:25] and remember there was a breach
[1:03:29] and in the story of the rich young ruler
[1:03:32] it was told
[1:03:34] that there was abraham bosom where
[1:03:36] lazarus went and then there was a rich
[1:03:38] man who was in a place of torment and
[1:03:41] yet instilled they could see the bible
[1:03:43] said there was a gulf there was a breach
[1:03:46] between that dimension
[1:03:49] and the righteous was in the bosom of
[1:03:51] abraham and the unrighteous was in a
[1:03:56] area of torment
[1:03:57] and they could see each other
[1:04:00] yes
[1:04:01] here was a rich young ruler
[1:04:04] looking up to abraham and said abraham
[1:04:08] could you have lazarus come and just dip
[1:04:11] his finger in some water and place it on
[1:04:14] my tongue
[1:04:16] it must have been a horrible situation
[1:04:19] and this man actually was called to
[1:04:21] preach
[1:04:23] he was in
[1:04:24] he had a gift of evangelism
[1:04:26] yes because remember jesus invited him a
[1:04:29] man to go come with him you know
[1:04:32] remember that he was young you know he
[1:04:33] comes along and and he's and he's and
[1:04:35] he's you know oh you know i've done
[1:04:37] everything this is why i say you ought
[1:04:39] to be careful how you approach god
[1:04:41] your protocol will determine uh the way
[1:04:44] god will answer you
[1:04:45] if you come by way of grace god will
[1:04:48] give you grace if you come by way of law
[1:04:50] he will give you the law and i think
[1:04:52] it's more rewarding to all of us when we
[1:04:55] approach god with the grace of god
[1:04:58] so the rich young ruler approach god
[1:05:00] says what must i do this is very
[1:05:02] important
[1:05:05] and then god went down the list jesus
[1:05:07] christ went down the list of all the
[1:05:09] things that is required of him to do
[1:05:12] and the rich young ruler says well lord
[1:05:14] i've done them all
[1:05:15] but god understood
[1:05:17] there was something still lodging in
[1:05:18] that man's heart
[1:05:20] that perhaps he didn't understand or
[1:05:22] didn't even know it was there but you
[1:05:24] see the word is sharp
[1:05:26] sharpened in a two-edged sword is able
[1:05:29] to divide right he's able to go into the
[1:05:31] heart and search it out to see the
[1:05:34] darkness there and that's what jesus did
[1:05:36] he said i tell you what go sell all that
[1:05:39] you have and follow me
[1:05:41] now god has never required of the rich
[1:05:44] young ruler to do anything other than
[1:05:46] what he's required us to do
[1:05:48] we must sell out everything and follow
[1:05:51] him
[1:05:52] but the rich young ruler he said you
[1:05:54] know lord i can't do that that's too
[1:05:56] much for me to bear and he walked away
[1:05:59] from god
[1:06:00] and the next scene you see this rich
[1:06:02] ruler amen with his bonds full and he's
[1:06:05] retiring from his great job and he's got
[1:06:07] all the riches that he desire now we
[1:06:09] wouldn't have known it was the same
[1:06:10] person had not have been for a prophet
[1:06:13] but nevertheless amen this rich young
[1:06:15] ruler said take ease my soul and rest
[1:06:19] [Laughter]
[1:06:20] and god looked at him and said oh you
[1:06:22] fool
[1:06:23] yes you understand me
[1:06:26] because this man also had a second
[1:06:28] chance
[1:06:29] god always give you a second chance god
[1:06:32] laid lazarus right before his door
[1:06:36] remember the bible said if you do good
[1:06:38] unto the least of these you've done it
[1:06:40] unto me
[1:06:41] and god gave the rich young ruler a
[1:06:43] second chance
[1:06:46] but what did he do he shoned it he
[1:06:48] despised lazarus right
[1:06:51] yes hallelujah and he wouldn't give to
[1:06:54] lazarus but the same man he despised was
[1:06:58] now in abraham's bosom that's right it
[1:07:00] was able it was lazarus time now
[1:07:03] yes the rich young ruler who was rich
[1:07:05] was paul
[1:07:07] the paul lazarus now was rich
[1:07:10] and isn't it funny that's the way they
[1:07:11] call it calm i think that's the way
[1:07:14] things return it comes back to you
[1:07:17] whatsoever man so he shall also reap
[1:07:19] amen and what was it here it was the
[1:07:22] rich rich young ruler
[1:07:25] lazarus wanted crumbs
[1:07:27] right lazarus was raising the dogs to
[1:07:29] the table yeah and this rich young said
[1:07:33] why didn't he say abraham wouldn't you
[1:07:34] give won't you give me a drink
[1:07:36] why did he say abraham why don't you
[1:07:38] give me some water but you know what he
[1:07:40] did he says no sin lazarus you know why
[1:07:43] he knew lazarus
[1:07:45] that's right and lazarus knew him
[1:07:48] hallelujah and abraham says no he can't
[1:07:51] do it there's a gulf between us now
[1:07:54] watch it he said but then the rich young
[1:07:56] ruler his gift shows up
[1:07:58] let me go let me go and tell my brothers
[1:08:02] about this place so they won't come here
[1:08:04] you see he wanted to do the
[1:08:05] evangelistical work then but it was too
[1:08:08] late
[1:08:09] it was too late
[1:08:11] hallelujah but you and i must understand
[1:08:14] all of these things are written here
[1:08:16] because the book is open
[1:08:18] a lot of times people look at these
[1:08:20] stories but they don't understand god is
[1:08:23] sending a message to his bride
[1:08:25] be careful
[1:08:27] hallelujah because great gain is not
[1:08:30] godliness but godliness with great it is
[1:08:33] a godly is great gain y'all know what
[1:08:35] i'm trying to say so you know what i'm
[1:08:38] saying it's all right to be rich it's
[1:08:39] all right but understand jesus christ
[1:08:42] must be the number one in your life
[1:08:44] yes sir let's move on
[1:08:47] so heaven and earth had brought a breach
[1:08:48] there was a breach
[1:08:51] we didn't understand it
[1:08:53] when jesus died and he went down into
[1:08:55] hell and he preached to the souls that
[1:08:56] was in prison
[1:08:58] he was binding something
[1:09:01] he was setting order remember the first
[1:09:04] adam disarrayed he said things in
[1:09:07] disorder
[1:09:08] the second adam it was the restoration
[1:09:11] and that's why that's why you know you
[1:09:13] you're finding joy i i i shall restore
[1:09:17] because god always liked to restore
[1:09:20] and we find out amen here was jesus
[1:09:22] christ dying he died for you he he was
[1:09:25] buried for you and in everything he he
[1:09:28] went to restore not just what the first
[1:09:30] adam messed up and lost but everything
[1:09:33] that was caused by that effect it was up
[1:09:36] to jesus christ to restore
[1:09:38] you got to understand so you could
[1:09:40] understand what i'm saying
[1:09:42] remember the first adam had the
[1:09:44] commission to multiply and create
[1:09:48] multiply uh and fill the whole earth
[1:09:51] with sons and daughters of god well the
[1:09:52] first adam never did that
[1:09:54] that's right he they never the the sons
[1:09:57] of god never filled the earth and you
[1:10:00] say what do you mean
[1:10:01] because it was the hibernation
[1:10:04] it was those that looked like the sons
[1:10:06] of god yes
[1:10:08] you understand me
[1:10:10] and what happened because of the law was
[1:10:14] misconstrued it was messed up
[1:10:17] because of polygamy and all those things
[1:10:19] those things came after the fall right
[1:10:22] right and because of polygamy you watch
[1:10:25] the devil because he knows what he's
[1:10:26] doing he was able to out multiply the
[1:10:29] sons of god
[1:10:31] and he's doing the same thing again
[1:10:35] but look what god is doing
[1:10:37] he's still
[1:10:38] by his word
[1:10:40] forming
[1:10:42] and bringing forth sons and daughters of
[1:10:45] god
[1:10:46] this is why the bible said they
[1:10:49] without they cannot be completed without
[1:10:52] us
[1:10:53] understand because what we have is what
[1:10:56] they need you understand me because the
[1:10:59] fullness of christ has come back to the
[1:11:02] bride of jesus christ and because of
[1:11:04] that
[1:11:05] the full restoration of the authority of
[1:11:07] god is now back in the
[1:11:10] bride that's right
[1:11:13] so what are you saying
[1:11:15] even now
[1:11:17] i mentioned it yesterday
[1:11:20] the scripture says it like this
[1:11:22] we are now setting in heavenly places in
[1:11:26] christ jesus
[1:11:28] now how can we be sitting in heavenly
[1:11:30] places in christ jesus and yet be on
[1:11:32] earth at the same time
[1:11:36] this is where you your faith must kick
[1:11:38] in
[1:11:39] and i was telling my church you must
[1:11:41] elevate your mind your way of thinking
[1:11:45] because we think so much like men to the
[1:11:48] oftentimes we find ourselves walking
[1:11:51] like me and talking like men and
[1:11:53] carrying on like men but when you're
[1:11:55] born again
[1:11:56] you're not just a man or a woman you
[1:11:59] have become sons and daughters of god
[1:12:01] and the mind of christ must operate your
[1:12:05] life
[1:12:09] hallelujah and what was his mind i have
[1:12:12] come in the volume of the book to do thy
[1:12:16] will oh god
[1:12:17] that's what we're here for
[1:12:19] we're not here for nothing else other
[1:12:22] than fulfilling the word of god for our
[1:12:25] day amen you understand me and you can't
[1:12:29] do that amen with the letter only
[1:12:32] you need power
[1:12:34] but let me go on by god's grace so what
[1:12:37] happened conquered death was conquered
[1:12:39] you know in a lot of times you know
[1:12:41] people think that you know god made a
[1:12:43] skeleton key and you can unlock all the
[1:12:45] doors of heaven there's only one key
[1:12:47] that unlocks the door of heaven and that
[1:12:50] key is jesus christ amen
[1:12:52] hallelujah yes sir i don't care what age
[1:12:56] you would have been born in the only key
[1:12:59] that would have unlocked the door would
[1:13:01] have been jesus
[1:13:02] christ y'all understand me so we know by
[1:13:06] god's grace amen that the resurrection
[1:13:08] has benefits
[1:13:10] and of course psalms 103 talks about it
[1:13:12] forget not your benefits
[1:13:14] don't forget him
[1:13:16] he healeth all your disease
[1:13:18] right he saved you he he he delivers you
[1:13:21] oh you can read it 103 1-5 he tells of
[1:13:24] the benefits and those are just some of
[1:13:26] them right right
[1:13:28] but there are great benefits
[1:13:31] of being in this message and here it is
[1:13:34] oftentimes people think that the message
[1:13:37] is reading books
[1:13:40] or listening to a tape
[1:13:42] sometimes people think and and and they
[1:13:44] forget the letter will kill you
[1:13:47] but the spirit gives you life
[1:13:50] you understand me even the things that
[1:13:52] brother branham has said must have a
[1:13:54] spiritual revelation and understanding
[1:13:56] of that's right you hear what i'm saying
[1:13:58] because many times you say what do you
[1:14:00] mean he like jesus christ when he was
[1:14:03] here many times spoke in parables
[1:14:07] he said things that made it look made
[1:14:09] him look like he didn't know what he was
[1:14:10] talking about but he understood that
[1:14:12] spiritual bride she's going to catch it
[1:14:15] and the reason why she can catch it
[1:14:17] because she has the spirit of jesus
[1:14:20] christ who is the message
[1:14:23] and god never confuses his own word
[1:14:25] hallelujah hallelujah so you got to
[1:14:27] understand by god's grace so when we see
[1:14:30] and and i'm going to back to the opening
[1:14:32] of the word
[1:14:34] so you can understand that when that
[1:14:36] word was open
[1:14:38] when the seals were open
[1:14:40] and and and and there were silos in
[1:14:42] heaven something took place
[1:14:45] and and and the prophet god said i have
[1:14:47] to be careful because even the angels
[1:14:49] had to be careful not to say anything
[1:14:51] because if they would have said
[1:14:52] something it would have given it away
[1:14:55] but understand you can't add nor take
[1:14:57] away from the bible
[1:14:58] everything that was said must come in
[1:15:01] line with the word
[1:15:03] is that right so you got to understand
[1:15:06] that this even the silence in itself has
[1:15:08] an interpretation and i'm not here to
[1:15:10] interpret but i'm going to tell you some
[1:15:12] things today so that you could
[1:15:14] understand
[1:15:16] when things are silent
[1:15:18] doesn't mean god is not working
[1:15:22] the greater things in life
[1:15:25] like the sun none of you hear the sun
[1:15:28] you don't hear the wind of the moon
[1:15:30] right
[1:15:31] it's silent
[1:15:33] but those great things can you imagine
[1:15:36] what it would be like if we could hear
[1:15:37] the noise of every star
[1:15:41] hallelujah but to us it's silent but
[1:15:44] those things are great
[1:15:46] those are the greater things
[1:15:48] and god is always working he's always
[1:15:51] doing something
[1:15:52] amen in that time of silence that people
[1:15:55] just don't see
[1:15:57] hallelujah except those
[1:16:01] who understand the revelation of their
[1:16:03] day hallelujah because i'll give you
[1:16:06] i'll give you an example
[1:16:08] you had simeon and anna in the temple
[1:16:11] praying before the lord
[1:16:14] and israel was silent
[1:16:16] yes
[1:16:17] there had not been a prophet in the land
[1:16:22] i think 400 years or so and nobody heard
[1:16:24] the voice of god hallelujah
[1:16:27] yes
[1:16:27] but in the midst of their silence
[1:16:30] god was preparing
[1:16:32] a prophet and a prophetess
[1:16:35] for the coming of the lord
[1:16:37] somebody help me here
[1:16:39] when nobody else knew god was still god
[1:16:41] and that god was still working
[1:16:44] there were two
[1:16:46] who heard the voice of god and told them
[1:16:49] in their day that they would not die
[1:16:51] until they see the messiah
[1:16:54] but to the church world they had not
[1:16:56] heard from god
[1:16:58] y'all understand when i'm going with
[1:16:59] this
[1:17:00] it's a silence it's a time of silence
[1:17:03] for the church world
[1:17:05] but for the bride
[1:17:07] she has an ear to hear
[1:17:10] things that the world cannot hear
[1:17:12] secrets
[1:17:14] that only gives the bride see that's the
[1:17:16] thing
[1:17:18] everybody think that when this rapture
[1:17:19] takes place you know the whole church is
[1:17:22] going to just go up let me tell you
[1:17:23] something only those who have a
[1:17:26] relationship
[1:17:28] those who can hear god those who can see
[1:17:30] god those who the word of god has been
[1:17:32] open to you know the time and the season
[1:17:35] you're living in that's why the word of
[1:17:37] god says we don't have to talk about the
[1:17:39] times and seasons you ought to know
[1:17:43] the devil won't come to you as a thief
[1:17:45] in the night because you know you can
[1:17:47] see where you're living but you see
[1:17:49] those who are in the message they're
[1:17:50] going on and on and on with all of these
[1:17:53] crazy ideas and things and cannot hear
[1:17:57] and they cannot see and they don't even
[1:17:59] know the time they're living in
[1:18:02] hallelujah it just stands like standing
[1:18:05] amen on the beach and the tidal wave is
[1:18:07] moving backwards
[1:18:09] and you're standing there observing it
[1:18:11] like ah
[1:18:14] not even knowing the very thing that you
[1:18:16] are is amazing
[1:18:18] that's amazing you it will come back
[1:18:21] to kill you
[1:18:23] hallelujah but those who know the
[1:18:26] function they know the way tidal waves
[1:18:28] move
[1:18:29] what do they do when they see that they
[1:18:32] run
[1:18:33] desperation strikes them and they know
[1:18:35] if i don't get out of the way of this
[1:18:38] judgment it's going to catch me and i
[1:18:41] will be consumed with everybody else
[1:18:43] this is what i'm talking about
[1:18:45] we understand that judgment is striking
[1:18:48] america right now not just america but
[1:18:50] the whole world and you're foolish if
[1:18:53] you don't get out of the way
[1:18:56] and the only hiding place is in jesus
[1:18:59] christ him alone
[1:19:02] you can run to the mountain and the
[1:19:03] mountains won't hide you you can run to
[1:19:06] the dens and the deans of the cave
[1:19:07] cannot hide you is that right there's no
[1:19:10] hiding place
[1:19:12] outside of jesus christ
[1:19:15] you know even in israel day 87 when
[1:19:18] titus came israel missed the messiah yes
[1:19:22] and they thought if we run into the
[1:19:24] temple and we run into the city we're
[1:19:26] going to be safe
[1:19:28] but they did not understand they did not
[1:19:30] catch the revelation of jesus christ why
[1:19:32] he was coming
[1:19:34] because not only was he the age of grace
[1:19:36] but he also brought judgment
[1:19:39] and he told them he said you know one of
[1:19:41] these old days you're going to wish to
[1:19:42] see the son of man and you'll see him
[1:19:44] not
[1:19:45] y'all understand me he told them it was
[1:19:47] going to happen he even told his
[1:19:49] disciples when you see the enemy encompa
[1:19:52] when you see the city encompass about
[1:19:54] about enemy he said don't take your
[1:19:56] stuff
[1:19:57] right and that's the problem we got too
[1:19:59] much stuff that means too much to us
[1:20:02] don't take your stuff leave it wherever
[1:20:05] it is people of god the most important
[1:20:08] thing right now is to make sure you've
[1:20:10] got the holy ghost and you're sealed
[1:20:13] hallelujah hallelujah because once you
[1:20:16] seal the seal cannot be broken
[1:20:22] dale the devil this is layer to see he
[1:20:24] wants you to be lazy he wants you to be
[1:20:26] you know uh nonchalant however they want
[1:20:28] to say it you know dollatory you know
[1:20:30] what i mean he wants you to be all of
[1:20:32] that
[1:20:33] but no
[1:20:34] no no the word of god i think according
[1:20:36] to zechariah said when the vision has
[1:20:37] been made plain when it's made being
[1:20:39] clear when it let him that read it right
[1:20:42] hallelujah he said that it ain't going
[1:20:44] to tear it you better run hallelujah it
[1:20:48] didn't say jog or walk it said run
[1:20:52] hallelujah take
[1:20:54] that means to run with haste
[1:20:56] time is shorter than what we think and
[1:20:58] this is what i'm gonna my subject i say
[1:21:00] that the book is over open but i wanted
[1:21:03] to say just a minute away is my thought
[1:21:06] think about it the rapture could be just
[1:21:08] a minute away yes sir
[1:21:12] what could you do in a minute's time
[1:21:15] but anyway so we find out amen that
[1:21:18] nobody was worthy to open the book
[1:21:21] or to loose the seals thereof
[1:21:24] the bible said they searched the a
[1:21:26] heaven and the earth and the under the
[1:21:28] earth and everywhere and there was
[1:21:29] nobody worthy
[1:21:31] then there was a voice said don't weep
[1:21:32] john there's one worthy amen
[1:21:35] i'm trying to tell you something here
[1:21:37] don't weep john one is worthy
[1:21:39] to open the to loose the seals and open
[1:21:41] open up this book
[1:21:43] john turned to see a lion
[1:21:46] right and we all love lions don't we the
[1:21:49] four living creatures
[1:21:51] the lion the ox the man the eagle y'all
[1:21:53] know how it goes
[1:21:54] but something changed
[1:21:58] because remember amen john who was the
[1:22:00] who was the prophet eagle he was an
[1:22:02] eagle but let's put it this way but when
[1:22:05] the eagle turned he saw a lamb
[1:22:08] yes something happened
[1:22:12] in the opening of the seals
[1:22:15] the four living creatures had been used
[1:22:18] during the church ages
[1:22:20] but now this is a new age which is
[1:22:22] called life
[1:22:26] hello
[1:22:28] you can call it the eighth day the
[1:22:29] eighth whatever you want to call it you
[1:22:31] know some people get all tied up with
[1:22:33] terminology but the most important thing
[1:22:36] you need to know is that the church ages
[1:22:38] was ending when this happened
[1:22:42] and god was bringing a bride out of it
[1:22:45] y'all understand me
[1:22:47] a time when he could perfect her
[1:22:51] because he indicted laodicea
[1:22:54] she was found guilty
[1:22:56] hallelujah you understand me and now she
[1:22:59] has a name that she lives but she's dead
[1:23:02] right
[1:23:03] but there's a bride y'all know what i'm
[1:23:05] the book is open
[1:23:07] and so you say what do you mean what do
[1:23:08] you mean
[1:23:10] because if there is a marriage
[1:23:13] and we see that a lamb is getting ready
[1:23:16] to be married
[1:23:18] where a lamb doesn't marry a goat
[1:23:22] it doesn't marry a cow
[1:23:24] a lamb marries a lamb
[1:23:28] y'all understand me so this dispensation
[1:23:32] changes amen from the eagle to the lamb
[1:23:35] and god is requiring us to be
[1:23:38] lambs
[1:23:40] you don't believe me why do you think he
[1:23:42] called it the lamb book of life
[1:23:45] amen
[1:23:47] the nature of jesus christ is a lamb
[1:23:51] hallelujah that lamb was able to go to
[1:23:54] calvary he was led to go to calvary
[1:23:57] y'all better hear what i'm saying and
[1:23:59] everything he had to go through the
[1:24:02] bible said he opened not his mouth why
[1:24:05] because the bible said he wouldn't do it
[1:24:08] y'all understand me
[1:24:10] this this air that this time that we're
[1:24:13] living in causes for your nature to
[1:24:15] change this is why peter said the divine
[1:24:18] nature of god amen is likened to a lamb
[1:24:22] it started off as a lamb it ends up like
[1:24:25] a lamb the lamb was slain before the
[1:24:27] foundation of the world the lamb was
[1:24:30] slain in the garden of eden
[1:24:33] hallelujah and the lamb was slain on
[1:24:35] calvary hallelujah and now the lamb the
[1:24:38] book is open and now and then the lamb
[1:24:42] is being exposed who is this lamb
[1:24:46] jesus christ
[1:24:51] y'all understand me
[1:24:52] that's why you got to say lord give me
[1:24:54] that lamb's
[1:24:56] nature if you want to take me to the
[1:24:59] slaughter
[1:25:00] take me to the slaughter that's right
[1:25:03] lord if you want to shear me
[1:25:06] shear me
[1:25:07] if there be anything in my life that
[1:25:09] needs to be cut off cut it off take it
[1:25:12] off lord bring me to a place of
[1:25:14] nakedness that you might be seeing and
[1:25:17] not me
[1:25:19] hallelujah
[1:25:21] hallelujah it's open
[1:25:23] and it's open for you
[1:25:24] this is the bride's book
[1:25:27] y'all hear what i'm saying
[1:25:28] god has this book for you and me
[1:25:32] when the world think is outdated there
[1:25:34] is no greater book than the bible i
[1:25:36] don't care how great the authors are you
[1:25:38] know it's so amazing like uh the prophet
[1:25:40] god said they'll give honor to the man
[1:25:42] who could create a false leg and a false
[1:25:44] eye right but they don't give no honor
[1:25:46] to the man who created the real eye and
[1:25:48] the real that's right
[1:25:50] the real leg
[1:25:52] you know what i'm saying you know i
[1:25:54] could give some honor to the false eye
[1:25:55] if you can make it see
[1:26:00] hallelujah y'all understand what i'm
[1:26:02] saying but they can't even make it see
[1:26:05] right but they get more honor about this
[1:26:07] false stuff that god does
[1:26:10] let's move on by the grace of god you
[1:26:12] look at this thing you say well brother
[1:26:14] what are you trying to tell me oh my god
[1:26:16] if i could just that's why i weep
[1:26:17] sometimes i get so excited
[1:26:19] you know you're singing about heaven
[1:26:21] you're talking about stuff that i like i
[1:26:22] love that i love that i love that you
[1:26:24] know and so we look at this thing
[1:26:26] because it's such a drama
[1:26:28] everything is in shadows and types and
[1:26:30] and you know we we know that the uh uh
[1:26:34] revelation is a book of symbols and a
[1:26:36] lot of the things that are there is in
[1:26:39] symbol form you know i mean even even
[1:26:41] even uh let's put it this way even the
[1:26:43] book of life you know or the book of the
[1:26:44] lamb book of life a lot of times you
[1:26:46] know in your mind you think it's got a
[1:26:48] big book can you imagine how book bit
[1:26:50] big that book would be
[1:26:53] but see god don't need no no memory
[1:26:55] he remembers everything
[1:26:58] he's got every name
[1:27:00] god is so so powerful he knows the
[1:27:02] number of hairs on your head
[1:27:05] now i've had all of this all my life and
[1:27:07] i've never counted them
[1:27:09] but he knows something i don't know
[1:27:12] you know what i'm saying
[1:27:14] what i'm trying to say is that a lot of
[1:27:16] time and i thought about this i said oh
[1:27:17] i don't know how it's going to look
[1:27:19] because i know when i you know i
[1:27:22] remember when reading in matthew it says
[1:27:23] i go to prepare a place for you that
[1:27:25] where i am there you should be also and
[1:27:27] in my father's house there are many
[1:27:29] mansions well you know i thought there
[1:27:30] was going to be housing everywhere i'm
[1:27:32] not saying there won't be houses
[1:27:34] but i'll tell you what brother branham
[1:27:36] saw when he was there over there in that
[1:27:38] other dimension he saw people
[1:27:42] mansions
[1:27:44] people
[1:27:46] running in the king in the kingdom
[1:27:49] holy running to him a number he even
[1:27:52] could not even number
[1:27:54] you understand me
[1:27:56] so you must must understand god speaks
[1:27:59] in parables and we see how the devil has
[1:28:02] he interprets the word in such a calm
[1:28:04] away and and you know we you can't get
[1:28:07] nothing out of it right
[1:28:09] you know i mean i mean you know how the
[1:28:11] devil does he he he he interpret god
[1:28:14] as an old grandfather
[1:28:17] that ain't him god don't age
[1:28:20] let the devil know that amen he doesn't
[1:28:23] age there is no time with him he's
[1:28:25] eternal
[1:28:29] now let me move on so you say well what
[1:28:31] do you mean when when this thing oh it's
[1:28:32] such a grand thing he kept it from the
[1:28:34] devil all those years
[1:28:37] god did
[1:28:38] now think about it
[1:28:40] let us not be like israel
[1:28:42] because israel had the ark of the
[1:28:44] covenant
[1:28:45] and god would show up on the ark of the
[1:28:47] covenant but you understand the ark of
[1:28:49] the covenant was just a meeting place
[1:28:50] that god had ordained for him to meet it
[1:28:53] wasn't that that was the only place god
[1:28:54] was everywhere
[1:28:56] by foreknowledge amen but israel got
[1:28:59] somewhere in such a system they thought
[1:29:02] that the only place that god could show
[1:29:04] up was where that ark was
[1:29:07] right
[1:29:09] what happened all those years when they
[1:29:12] lost the ark of the covenant
[1:29:15] they lied to the people
[1:29:18] they made the people believe
[1:29:20] that the ark of the covenant was behind
[1:29:22] the veil
[1:29:25] and god exposed them
[1:29:28] when he died and he rose from the again
[1:29:30] the bible said the veil was rent from
[1:29:32] top to the bottom
[1:29:34] and if there were any past buyers they
[1:29:37] could see that the ark was not there
[1:29:41] hallelujah and see when the word when
[1:29:43] the word inspired is not there that's
[1:29:46] what produces pharisees sadducees and
[1:29:49] all of those kind of sex because god is
[1:29:52] not there
[1:29:54] it becomes a man control thing y'all
[1:29:57] understand what i'm saying but when the
[1:29:59] ark is there when god is on the the
[1:30:02] mercy seat y'all understand me and your
[1:30:04] mercy is here
[1:30:07] that's where god is who else can give
[1:30:10] mercy and grace like the bride can yes
[1:30:14] hallelujah y'all understand me yes sir
[1:30:17] so anyhow amen we understood that that
[1:30:19] what happened is when this
[1:30:22] angel when christ himself this lamb came
[1:30:25] to take the book
[1:30:28] out of the right hand of him that uh
[1:30:31] sat on front of the throne he came and
[1:30:33] he took the book but he didn't keep it
[1:30:35] to himself
[1:30:36] because this was a restoration this was
[1:30:39] to bring mankind back to his position
[1:30:42] you understand because remember when he
[1:30:44] rose paradise emptied out that's right
[1:30:49] it changed
[1:30:51] and god placed mankind in his proper
[1:30:54] position which was the sixth dimension
[1:30:57] under the altar is that right
[1:30:59] so you got to understand and then
[1:31:01] because of the fall we had to have a we
[1:31:03] were in a lesser place but now we're in
[1:31:05] a higher place this is why the bible
[1:31:07] said we are now sitting in high in in in
[1:31:10] high places we are in a different
[1:31:11] dimension where in christ jesus this is
[1:31:14] what i'm trying to tell you and
[1:31:16] therefore if we're there
[1:31:19] which we are yes we're in the form of
[1:31:21] theophany however you want to put it but
[1:31:24] we're there
[1:31:25] and it's our duty to connect
[1:31:28] with that one
[1:31:31] y'all understand what i'm saying
[1:31:33] because when you hear from this message
[1:31:36] you have heard from your theophany well
[1:31:38] what do you mean
[1:31:40] if though that dimension
[1:31:42] where lazarus was emptied out and went
[1:31:46] up higher
[1:31:47] it also gave freedom to our theophanies
[1:31:52] oh my god
[1:31:54] because it was you've never heard of it
[1:31:56] before sure until this day that's right
[1:32:01] when the prophet of god could tell you
[1:32:03] that you have a theophany
[1:32:05] you have a word body
[1:32:08] right
[1:32:09] and understand amen that word body
[1:32:11] stands before god day and night
[1:32:14] in representation of you
[1:32:17] hallelujah he's the one oh my god this
[1:32:20] gives you the signals he's the one says
[1:32:23] don't do it
[1:32:24] he's the one saying don't go there
[1:32:27] he's the one that don't look at that
[1:32:30] you understand me that that's our
[1:32:32] communication what's the use of hearing
[1:32:35] for you from your theophany
[1:32:38] and there is no communication
[1:32:41] the word says hearing
[1:32:43] you've heard
[1:32:46] from your theophany
[1:32:48] there's a conversation
[1:32:50] there's something being said
[1:32:53] communication
[1:32:55] that's telling you you're there already
[1:32:58] oh
[1:32:59] you say oh brother i don't know about
[1:33:01] that well let me tell you like i said
[1:33:03] like let me say it like this
[1:33:08] what about elijah
[1:33:12] elijah's not dead
[1:33:15] right
[1:33:17] moses is not dead
[1:33:18] right
[1:33:20] they stood on mount transfiguration
[1:33:24] and that was before
[1:33:27] the crucifixion
[1:33:30] yes after the crucifixion it was no
[1:33:32] longer their theophanies
[1:33:36] who rose from the dead rose and they're
[1:33:38] glorified
[1:33:40] yes
[1:33:41] you say how can it be it is so
[1:33:44] you say oh brother what are you trying
[1:33:46] to say what i'm trying to say is the
[1:33:48] very god that created us was bringing us
[1:33:52] back let me get back to this one point i
[1:33:54] forgot because the first adam did not
[1:33:56] replenish the earth
[1:33:58] but the second adam replenished the
[1:34:01] earth now how did he do it the bible
[1:34:04] said he didn't have a wife
[1:34:07] right he could have got a white brother
[1:34:09] adam said he didn't yes
[1:34:11] why because he understood he was a
[1:34:12] quickening spirit
[1:34:14] and his wife must not be a natural woman
[1:34:16] but she must be a spiritual woman
[1:34:20] and so when god gives you the holy ghost
[1:34:22] he gives you the holy ghost because you
[1:34:24] are his wife
[1:34:30] and listen
[1:34:32] it won't be any more children
[1:34:36] there won't be any kind of reproduction
[1:34:37] like that anymore right
[1:34:40] but how does god replenish the earth
[1:34:44] because he takes all of his children
[1:34:46] and he places them in a reserved place
[1:34:51] until that time he comes back in
[1:34:53] revelation riding on a white horse
[1:34:56] he now comes with the host of heaven
[1:34:59] to replenish the earth
[1:35:03] it's the truth
[1:35:04] that's how god is replenishing
[1:35:07] when you get saved that's why heaven
[1:35:09] rejoice hallelujah because they know
[1:35:12] this is just the beginning of a new
[1:35:14] creation
[1:35:16] yeah hallelujah let me let me move on by
[1:35:18] the grace of god
[1:35:20] you love the lord yeah now brother
[1:35:22] berlin says it like this
[1:35:23] question and answers he said when jesus
[1:35:25] suffered in the b that body he suffered
[1:35:28] because a man and a woman are one person
[1:35:31] eve was taken out of adam in on uh
[1:35:35] under the church
[1:35:37] what happened god opened
[1:35:39] up the side of adam and took out
[1:35:42] there a help meet the bride right and
[1:35:45] god opened up the side of jesus at
[1:35:47] calvary and took out the bride now he's
[1:35:50] saying some things here that i need you
[1:35:52] to understand
[1:35:53] amen not because if you're not if he
[1:35:55] wasn't there you won't be there that's
[1:35:57] right brother right
[1:35:59] you know god has given us such a perfect
[1:36:02] a perfect
[1:36:04] salvation
[1:36:06] and if we just hold that perfect
[1:36:08] faith that was that would bring us to it
[1:36:11] we you know it'll make you carefree
[1:36:13] almost
[1:36:15] you'll be loving everybody yes
[1:36:18] you'll be so excited about who you are
[1:36:20] and what you are you would never think
[1:36:22] about all what's going to happen to me
[1:36:23] tomorrow because you don't care
[1:36:26] you understand me you know where you're
[1:36:28] going you know where you came from you
[1:36:30] don't care yeah
[1:36:32] you ever think about lazarus let me say
[1:36:34] about lazarus and i'm gonna go finish
[1:36:35] this quote but lazarus never worried
[1:36:38] i mean the one that that was you know i
[1:36:40] said lord how i don't understand because
[1:36:42] never never have i seen the righteous
[1:36:44] forsaken or seed begging brave but he
[1:36:46] was lazarus begging from the young uh
[1:36:48] see god can do what he wants to do
[1:36:50] lazarus had a mission
[1:36:52] he was born for that purpose
[1:36:55] y'all understand me sometimes god put
[1:36:57] things and people in your life and then
[1:36:59] you overlook them keep overlooking them
[1:37:00] you better ask god why that person is
[1:37:02] there
[1:37:04] they could be your very tormentor
[1:37:06] but you need to ask god why is that
[1:37:08] person there
[1:37:10] and how much i must i minister to them
[1:37:14] you understand me because that could be
[1:37:16] your very test that same person
[1:37:20] hallelujah if the rich man would have
[1:37:22] known that lazarus was his test
[1:37:26] his final test and he failed it yes sir
[1:37:29] man good
[1:37:30] hallelujah yes let's move on but the the
[1:37:34] point is
[1:37:36] is that
[1:37:37] god had lazarus begging
[1:37:42] now
[1:37:44] you must understand
[1:37:47] a lot of time we see a man or woman on
[1:37:49] the street we think not much of them but
[1:37:51] you don't understand that could be the
[1:37:53] seed of god
[1:37:55] you understand me you don't know
[1:37:57] why they're there how they got there
[1:38:00] but oftentimes
[1:38:02] god put them there
[1:38:04] just for you
[1:38:05] amen to see your response to that person
[1:38:08] yes sir yes when i was naked you didn't
[1:38:11] clothe me yes
[1:38:13] you get it yes these things are not just
[1:38:15] coincidence so when god speaks to you
[1:38:17] stop turn around whatever the case may
[1:38:19] be do it amen
[1:38:24] let me remember go on now because we
[1:38:26] must understand we must understand when
[1:38:28] when god does something he's a purpose
[1:38:31] behind it and everything is your test
[1:38:33] your test
[1:38:34] hallelujah remember the bride was not
[1:38:37] taken from the body until the body was
[1:38:40] dead
[1:38:41] he had already he had already died and
[1:38:45] they were going to break his legs
[1:38:48] you know why they couldn't break the
[1:38:49] legs because not one word could be
[1:38:51] broken amen yes yes right and the and
[1:38:55] your your your body your your skeleton
[1:38:58] is your framework
[1:38:59] you understand and the word of god
[1:39:02] is basically god's framework
[1:39:05] you see what i'm saying
[1:39:06] and and the and the prophet said
[1:39:08] there'll not be one
[1:39:10] bone broken
[1:39:12] so they don't draw they you know so they
[1:39:16] done drawed back getting ready to break
[1:39:18] his leg and the hammer to break a leg
[1:39:20] and a man went up with the spirit and
[1:39:23] pushed it
[1:39:24] through his heart as water and blood
[1:39:27] came forth he was already dead listen
[1:39:31] she was all
[1:39:33] ready
[1:39:35] no god redeem me no she was already
[1:39:40] redeemed in the body
[1:39:44] by the by his death
[1:39:46] y'all understand me
[1:39:48] so his death was your redemption
[1:39:52] now you're here to manifest
[1:39:54] you were in there
[1:39:57] oh my god the devil don't like it i tell
[1:40:00] you what i can just kick him a bit you
[1:40:02] know you got to understand by god's
[1:40:04] grace the devil is a liar oh i'm just
[1:40:08] being saved that's not true the bible
[1:40:11] said you were saved before the
[1:40:13] foundation of the world you're just
[1:40:15] coming into the knowledge of it
[1:40:18] yes
[1:40:19] and god didn't save you back there to
[1:40:21] lose you that's right
[1:40:23] when the devil said you're going to be
[1:40:25] lost you can't be
[1:40:27] right
[1:40:29] oh my god this is really good to me so
[1:40:31] there's no suffering listen
[1:40:34] you were already redeeming the body by
[1:40:36] itself so there's no more suffering
[1:40:39] tribulation period for the bride see she
[1:40:42] goes in but the gentile church that just
[1:40:44] believed on him and takes the
[1:40:47] denomination of creeds and so forth and
[1:40:50] and and still see what they did the
[1:40:52] problem was they still had a love for
[1:40:54] the things of the world
[1:40:57] that's what kept them away
[1:40:59] right all right now listen you say well
[1:41:01] what do you mean brother books let me
[1:41:03] show you in the old testament y'all know
[1:41:04] i love esther so i'm gonna go to esther
[1:41:05] for just a bit
[1:41:07] esther's
[1:41:08] you gotta understand out there esther
[1:41:10] and ruth there's so many truths hidden
[1:41:11] in those books and those books were
[1:41:13] named after these women and so you got
[1:41:15] to understand that when god did that he
[1:41:17] had a great purpose hidden in that
[1:41:21] a great purpose
[1:41:23] and so a lot of times
[1:41:25] when you think about esther and ruth you
[1:41:26] understand that the whole
[1:41:28] redemption plan god's whole redemption
[1:41:30] plan was locked up in those two books
[1:41:33] hallelujah right those books were books
[1:41:36] of grace
[1:41:38] those books were books of mercy
[1:41:40] you understand those books told about
[1:41:42] the bride of jesus christ
[1:41:45] and understand i love esther because she
[1:41:47] comes from nowhere she was nothing
[1:41:50] right she had no mother nor father and
[1:41:53] of course we we know
[1:41:54] malachi mordecai her uncle was the one
[1:41:56] who raised her
[1:41:58] right and that's what happened she
[1:41:59] didn't know her identity there was a
[1:42:01] place in her life she had no real
[1:42:04] identity
[1:42:05] and mordecai gave her some identity
[1:42:08] which he was a type of of the prophet of
[1:42:10] our day and he basically told her how to
[1:42:12] do it and whatever the case may be of
[1:42:14] course when you you're in a state of
[1:42:16] mind like that you you know you need
[1:42:18] some help
[1:42:20] hallelujah and you know in the book of
[1:42:22] esther you know god is not mentioned
[1:42:24] y'all know these things right but this
[1:42:26] is the part i want to speak on
[1:42:30] there came a time
[1:42:32] because what this what i said about the
[1:42:35] the seals being open and john taking the
[1:42:37] book and then he god gives the book to
[1:42:39] john until john eat it eat it all up
[1:42:42] that's you
[1:42:43] that's not just wheaton branham that's
[1:42:45] you yeah and you're supposed to eat this
[1:42:47] whole book
[1:42:48] because thou must prophesy again is that
[1:42:51] right
[1:42:52] we become messengers of the message
[1:42:55] right god brings us into that place
[1:42:58] that's the prophet god said he he
[1:42:59] praises us in the same kind of position
[1:43:02] we are messengers now of the message so
[1:43:05] when when you look and see if that be
[1:43:08] the case if brother branham had
[1:43:09] authority over over demons and all of
[1:43:12] these things god placed in him that that
[1:43:15] son of man that was in him remember the
[1:43:17] bride of jesus christ comes to that same
[1:43:19] position
[1:43:21] hallelujah yes even the prophet said it
[1:43:24] she comes under the son of man anointing
[1:43:27] the same as elijah becomes elisha right
[1:43:30] and her the bride elisha amen has a
[1:43:33] double portion of what elijah had right
[1:43:38] it wasn't a drop in anointings
[1:43:40] it wasn't a drop amen in miracles it
[1:43:43] wasn't a drop amen and none of those
[1:43:45] things matter of fact it was an increase
[1:43:48] and among the bride we must have an
[1:43:51] increase
[1:43:52] if we have an increase it will prove who
[1:43:54] you are
[1:43:56] amen
[1:43:58] hallelujah we see a drop in all these
[1:44:00] things you can't see miracles you can't
[1:44:02] see gifts or anything like that that
[1:44:04] ain't the way it's supposed to be it's
[1:44:06] supposed to be an increase
[1:44:08] though it'd be a small group of people
[1:44:10] it's supposed to be an increase
[1:44:17] you love the lord
[1:44:19] all right so anyway
[1:44:21] the the authority of the word was taken
[1:44:23] from from eve and and listen look at
[1:44:26] look at esther
[1:44:29] and i'm going to show you something here
[1:44:32] the king stopped seeing esther
[1:44:35] and if you know the story you know he
[1:44:37] didn't want to see it for a while
[1:44:41] it had been a while it was silenced
[1:44:47] and during the silence
[1:44:50] i can hear the message people say
[1:44:52] you better say it just like hell shall
[1:44:54] not prevail against it
[1:44:56] you understand me
[1:44:58] you must have it revealed whatever he
[1:45:01] said must become a revelation and that
[1:45:03] that revelation revealed comes out of
[1:45:05] your mouth
[1:45:08] that's what it means
[1:45:10] he doesn't mean letter by letter by
[1:45:12] letter
[1:45:13] like they said oh
[1:45:15] it's in the word you cannot go see the
[1:45:18] king
[1:45:21] without him something you
[1:45:25] but else i have a revelation
[1:45:28] i know what the law says
[1:45:30] but this king loves me
[1:45:34] and if i perish
[1:45:36] let me perish
[1:45:39] hallelujah it's silence
[1:45:44] but something happens
[1:45:46] because the bible said when those seven
[1:45:48] thunders uttered their voice
[1:45:50] there was a half hour of silence
[1:45:54] something took place
[1:45:56] you can't say something didn't take
[1:45:58] place it did
[1:46:00] but there was a forbidden to write it
[1:46:02] that's right
[1:46:04] but what happens is
[1:46:06] something happens
[1:46:08] a desperation comes on esther
[1:46:11] it's a man of life and death yes
[1:46:14] not only to her but to her people yes
[1:46:17] don't you understand they cannot be
[1:46:19] complete without us
[1:46:21] it's a manner of life and death
[1:46:23] it's a manner of resurrection it's a
[1:46:26] matter coming back to our proper place
[1:46:28] without us that cannot be completed
[1:46:31] we've got a burden on our hands and
[1:46:33] therefore we must go see the king
[1:46:37] you understand me we must get something
[1:46:39] from him that we don't have yet
[1:46:42] not that he's not giving his given
[1:46:48] she says if i perish
[1:46:50] can you imagine you're king you've got
[1:46:52] all these officers in there in the court
[1:46:54] you know when king is in his court in
[1:46:56] session they got all the businessmen you
[1:46:57] know whatever's going on in this part of
[1:46:59] the king that part of king that king all
[1:47:01] of a sudden
[1:47:04] the door opens
[1:47:10] and when the door opens
[1:47:13] the whole place becomes
[1:47:15] silent
[1:47:18] they're in awe
[1:47:21] because they know the law
[1:47:24] and they know
[1:47:26] if the king doesn't put forth his
[1:47:27] scepter
[1:47:29] esther is dead that's right
[1:47:33] but watch
[1:47:34] her something
[1:47:37] inspires her
[1:47:40] she fasted three days
[1:47:43] no water no bread
[1:47:46] that was a part of her death
[1:47:48] but she resurrected
[1:47:51] and when she resurrected
[1:47:53] she came up as queen
[1:47:55] she didn't go down with the same clothes
[1:47:57] these old clothes she had to to cry out
[1:48:00] to god with y'all understand what i'm
[1:48:02] saying
[1:48:02] she went and she put on the queen's
[1:48:05] garment
[1:48:07] she came in with the pride the garment
[1:48:10] of praise into his gate was thanksgiving
[1:48:13] into his courts with praise
[1:48:15] she she put on that garment oh my you
[1:48:18] know she was a pretty girl anyhow
[1:48:21] i can imagine esther coming in there
[1:48:25] humble
[1:48:26] humble
[1:48:28] quietly and everybody was like
[1:48:34] they couldn't say nothing
[1:48:36] you could hear a pin drop
[1:48:38] because now they're in expectation and
[1:48:40] anticipation
[1:48:42] what will the king do
[1:48:46] will the king break his own law
[1:48:53] she comes in
[1:48:54] and i i could just see it now this is
[1:48:56] just my imagination on this part
[1:48:58] but i can just see her
[1:49:00] as she lifts her head
[1:49:03] and she catches his eyes
[1:49:07] y'all understand me yes when people are
[1:49:09] in love and they catch each other i not
[1:49:12] one word is spoken
[1:49:15] but every word is understood
[1:49:17] amen yes
[1:49:19] maybe y'all haven't experienced that
[1:49:21] before but it works that way just that
[1:49:23] way it works
[1:49:26] all of a sudden the king amen in his own
[1:49:28] eyes he he showed her how much he loved
[1:49:31] her
[1:49:32] because what happened
[1:49:33] she became face to face
[1:49:36] you understand me
[1:49:38] face to face
[1:49:39] and jesus said one day we will see him
[1:49:41] what face to face
[1:49:46] and what happened
[1:49:48] the scepter was the book of authority
[1:49:50] there was this there was a was that was
[1:49:52] it was the word uh how could i say it
[1:49:54] was the authority of the king
[1:49:56] just like the little book
[1:50:01] and all of a sudden he hands the little
[1:50:03] book to her
[1:50:07] she takes the little book y'all hear me
[1:50:09] now this is the book open now
[1:50:11] the scepter becomes the book because
[1:50:13] that's the authority
[1:50:15] that's the title deed
[1:50:17] that's the very word of the king
[1:50:20] and he sets it out there and she holds
[1:50:23] it and then the king says to her
[1:50:27] you are now become jon heiress with me
[1:50:31] hallelujah ask what you will you could
[1:50:33] have the half of the kingdom amen
[1:50:38] yes
[1:50:41] you can have the half of the king
[1:50:43] kingdom it's yours
[1:50:47] it's yours
[1:50:48] you understand me
[1:50:50] he couldn't kill her
[1:50:52] he had already covered he made a
[1:50:54] covenant
[1:50:55] yes
[1:50:56] you understand me
[1:50:57] and
[1:50:59] then he asked her what would you have me
[1:51:02] what do you want me
[1:51:04] she says all i want to do is have
[1:51:06] a banquet
[1:51:10] see she knew
[1:51:12] she knew where that's died
[1:51:14] and that's how i represented the
[1:51:16] pentecostal realm the church the lay of
[1:51:18] the sea and age you understand me rich
[1:51:20] and increase with good and have need of
[1:51:22] nothing
[1:51:23] she's so proud with all her jewels and
[1:51:25] all her this and her pipe organs and all
[1:51:27] of these kind of stuff and when god
[1:51:29] called when the prophet was on the scene
[1:51:30] calling her to the wedding
[1:51:32] calling her to the some by the summers
[1:51:34] of the king because god the king wanted
[1:51:36] to show her off
[1:51:38] but no she was into her own revival
[1:51:41] running here and running there and this
[1:51:43] bishop going in that bishop going over
[1:51:44] there and then missing the call yes you
[1:51:48] understand me and god said put away
[1:51:52] i won't have nothing to do with her yes
[1:51:55] and at that time
[1:51:56] esther rose up
[1:52:00] you understand me this little bride rose
[1:52:03] up
[1:52:04] yes
[1:52:05] and now they're still having her their
[1:52:07] so-called revival god put her out you
[1:52:09] understand me
[1:52:11] he put her out they put him out he put
[1:52:14] her out right sure yes so you look at it
[1:52:18] you're looking at this thing this little
[1:52:19] group nobody this little esther nobody
[1:52:21] knew and listen didn't even know her
[1:52:23] identity
[1:52:26] look at you
[1:52:27] over in this little church i got one too
[1:52:31] nobody don't know you
[1:52:33] you're not some big thing
[1:52:35] but yet god is working here
[1:52:38] hallelujah god has chosen you and groups
[1:52:42] like this amen who's nothing don't have
[1:52:44] a big name we don't we don't have all
[1:52:46] this you know pomp and all that other we
[1:52:49] don't have it we're just simple ordinary
[1:52:51] people like esther but we've been
[1:52:53] summoned we we we we know we can go to
[1:52:56] the king and right now right now you and
[1:52:59] i must understand that time is coming
[1:53:02] and as we're right at hand
[1:53:05] you're going to have to fast and pray
[1:53:08] amen and your purpose is that you need
[1:53:11] from him that invisible one
[1:53:14] you need from him
[1:53:17] the next move hallelujah you understand
[1:53:20] me
[1:53:21] because you understand brother branham
[1:53:22] didn't give himself authority
[1:53:24] god gave it to him when it came to the
[1:53:26] first pool god gave it to him when it
[1:53:29] came to the second pool god gave it to
[1:53:31] him right even the third pool god gave
[1:53:34] it to him god came to him
[1:53:38] hallelujah so under that inspiration
[1:53:41] under the seven seals this is a seven
[1:53:42] seal preaching
[1:53:44] under that seventh seal under that
[1:53:45] silence something was taking place
[1:53:48] and she moves
[1:53:51] into position to receive her position
[1:53:55] and she said if i perish
[1:53:57] let me perish
[1:53:59] i'm going to see the king
[1:54:02] here's the thing
[1:54:05] who
[1:54:06] broke the silence
[1:54:10] esther
[1:54:13] broke the silence
[1:54:16] of the king
[1:54:18] and when the bride is ready she will
[1:54:20] break it
[1:54:23] she will come to that position
[1:54:25] and she knows i've got to have
[1:54:27] one-on-one
[1:54:28] with him
[1:54:30] you understand what i'm saying
[1:54:32] the authority of
[1:54:34] her that god is giving to her
[1:54:36] will come when she gets to a place where
[1:54:39] she
[1:54:40] focus herself on him
[1:54:44] knowing that he is the only one
[1:54:46] that can stop death
[1:54:49] haman is moving
[1:54:51] and he's moving right now throughout the
[1:54:53] whole world he's moving
[1:54:56] and he's coming after the christian
[1:54:58] yes sir y'all better hear what i'm
[1:54:59] saying
[1:55:01] because i'm gonna tell you like this let
[1:55:02] me move from esther now to samson
[1:55:06] samson had seven locks
[1:55:08] which was a covenant of god
[1:55:10] you understand me he let the world shave
[1:55:12] it off delilah right
[1:55:15] samson who pick up the gates of gaza who
[1:55:18] did all the mighty works
[1:55:19] the pentecostals who did all of this and
[1:55:21] that and the other i'm pentecostal but i
[1:55:23] got the real thing
[1:55:25] but what happened it was silence
[1:55:28] y'all remember
[1:55:30] there were times pentecostals was
[1:55:32] raising the dead
[1:55:33] there were times amen i remember in the
[1:55:36] church i was in the man comes in with a
[1:55:38] gun and he's shooting shooting shooting
[1:55:40] and bullets are just dropping off to
[1:55:41] people not even touching them because
[1:55:43] they're in the spirit of god
[1:55:46] that's that's pentecostal yes god was
[1:55:49] working
[1:55:51] but they chose a system over god
[1:55:54] right
[1:55:54] y'all understand me
[1:55:56] that's what fasti did
[1:55:59] she chose her system
[1:56:01] she allowed all her riches to puff her
[1:56:04] up
[1:56:05] and she didn't need the kingdom on but
[1:56:07] i'm telling you that i need the king
[1:56:10] amen
[1:56:11] and what happens she goes
[1:56:14] she breaks the silent
[1:56:17] sam's in silence
[1:56:19] no more activity no miracles he ain't
[1:56:22] doing nothing
[1:56:24] but moving around in the same circle
[1:56:25] grinding at the mirror slave to the
[1:56:28] devil
[1:56:30] but at this great feast
[1:56:33] things began to strike samson
[1:56:36] so you know what i was raised up to
[1:56:38] destroy the philistines
[1:56:43] and he's like like like he's like esting
[1:56:46] away if i perish let me perish
[1:56:50] but i will not leave out here until my
[1:56:52] purpose is fulfilled yes you understand
[1:56:55] me
[1:56:56] and as a pride of jesus christ i will
[1:56:58] not leave here until my purpose is
[1:57:01] fulfilled
[1:57:03] whatever it may be
[1:57:08] in silence
[1:57:10] nothing happening
[1:57:12] all of a sudden samson who types out the
[1:57:15] bride
[1:57:17] breaks the silence
[1:57:19] with the prayer
[1:57:21] oh lord
[1:57:23] just once more see until we're ready to
[1:57:26] seek god to move in this last
[1:57:29] little
[1:57:30] time that we have it's got to be you
[1:57:34] you got to get sick and tired of being
[1:57:35] sick and tired of this world you can't
[1:57:38] love the things of the world and love
[1:57:40] god at the same time that's right
[1:57:41] brother right now you've got to
[1:57:43] understand and guess what guess what you
[1:57:45] know what god is so awesome he pushed
[1:57:48] samson into that position
[1:57:50] all things work together for the good of
[1:57:52] them that love the lord even when you
[1:57:54] make the wrong decision god will
[1:57:57] intervene and push you back into the
[1:57:59] place where you should be amen
[1:58:02] it's going to be painful it will be hard
[1:58:04] but he's never he said i'll never lose
[1:58:07] you i can't lose you and so therefore
[1:58:10] you're going to do it hallelujah
[1:58:14] he pushed himself so hard he began to
[1:58:16] remember those days he used to have good
[1:58:18] times at church
[1:58:22] and he said oh lord just once more
[1:58:28] see what samson didn't understand
[1:58:31] was that his trials was also growing the
[1:58:33] character of christ in him that's right
[1:58:36] yes sir because all of a sudden he feels
[1:58:38] back here that which was gone has now
[1:58:40] been restored
[1:58:43] you don't see what's growing in you but
[1:58:45] your trials are bringing christ to the
[1:58:48] forefront it is christ in you the hope
[1:58:51] of glory is what god is doing in you
[1:58:54] he's building a new man and you got to
[1:58:57] go through it you got to go through the
[1:58:58] pain you got to go through the suffering
[1:59:00] you got to come through the
[1:59:01] disappointment but god never sleeps
[1:59:06] the devil said god ain't with you no
[1:59:08] even when he's silent
[1:59:10] god is with you
[1:59:12] he said i'll never leave you nor will i
[1:59:14] forsake you hallelujah is that right
[1:59:18] think about it people of god what god
[1:59:20] has done for us
[1:59:22] he's done a mighty mighty mighty mighty
[1:59:24] mighty work
[1:59:26] amen amen let me just finish up in just
[1:59:29] a minute i'm trying to get us to see
[1:59:33] that when god does something he he does
[1:59:35] it in a perfect way
[1:59:40] hallelujah and god amen has brought us
[1:59:43] to a freedom
[1:59:44] now even paul says
[1:59:46] like i was sharing last night i reckon
[1:59:48] the suffering of this world of this
[1:59:50] present time is not worthy to be
[1:59:52] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:59:55] revealed in us
[1:59:57] now watch esther
[1:59:58] because not only does she get half of
[2:00:00] the king and this is what i'm saying
[2:00:01] this is not a time to be moping and
[2:00:03] groping you know this is a time to have
[2:00:05] your banquet
[2:00:08] you know what i'm saying
[2:00:09] and you know when you got a banquet you
[2:00:11] got some real spiritual wine that you're
[2:00:13] working with
[2:00:14] right
[2:00:15] you don't be you know get drunk in the
[2:00:17] spirit
[2:00:19] how many times you've been drunk in the
[2:00:20] spirit
[2:00:22] yes
[2:00:24] not good but let me tell you something
[2:00:27] there are times you can pray
[2:00:30] and you can get so lost in prayer
[2:00:33] that when you get up you can't you
[2:00:34] stagger
[2:00:36] yes
[2:00:38] huh
[2:00:39] you could get so lost and rejoicing you
[2:00:42] know in the spiritual you you you're
[2:00:44] almost out of your mind like where am i
[2:00:47] drunk in the spirit
[2:00:48] right see what people fail to see is
[2:00:50] that when you're drunk in the spirit god
[2:00:53] is doing something
[2:00:54] you don't even know what he's doing but
[2:00:56] he's fixing the whatever problems that's
[2:00:58] in you
[2:01:00] right there's so many ways to praise god
[2:01:02] look even when david saw the ark of the
[2:01:05] covenant knowing what he had done wrong
[2:01:07] knowing that he he he did wrong when he
[2:01:10] put the ark on the card but when he saw
[2:01:12] that ark coming back he began to dance
[2:01:14] he began to praise god and guess what in
[2:01:17] all of that
[2:01:19] what he had done god says oh look at
[2:01:21] that man he's a man after my own heart
[2:01:23] hallelujah
[2:01:24] you see one thing about the blood of
[2:01:26] jesus christ
[2:01:29] it cleanses you and washes you from all
[2:01:31] sins
[2:01:33] now look by the grace of god i talked
[2:01:35] about that don't get this don't forget
[2:01:38] this
[2:01:39] even at times in your life
[2:01:42] when it seems like god is not answering
[2:01:44] or
[2:01:45] you feel like he's not listening don't
[2:01:47] ever go by your feelings when you pray
[2:01:49] it's good to feel
[2:01:51] but because you feel
[2:01:54] oh because you don't feel doesn't mean
[2:01:56] he's not hearing that's right because
[2:01:58] the bible said god knows your thoughts
[2:02:00] are far off
[2:02:01] yes right so anyway i said all of that
[2:02:04] to come down to the end of my message
[2:02:07] if we can get it
[2:02:11] if we can truly see where those messages
[2:02:13] brought and and don't think it as like
[2:02:15] oh or brother branham did you know it
[2:02:18] was a mighty angel it was god
[2:02:20] that came down
[2:02:22] it was god that changed things around
[2:02:24] for us
[2:02:25] yes and you and i must understand that
[2:02:27] this change is yours if you will accept
[2:02:29] it
[2:02:30] right see take the very way you did when
[2:02:34] you wanted to be saved you accepted it
[2:02:37] when you wanted to be baptized in the
[2:02:38] name of the lord jesus christ you
[2:02:39] accepted it and you got baptized yes
[2:02:42] just that simple
[2:02:44] you you you you says lord i accept what
[2:02:46] you've done and you really mean it
[2:02:49] god will make it manifest in your life
[2:02:51] you don't have to work at it
[2:02:53] yes you don't have to say it in a way uh
[2:02:56] you know a theological way you don't
[2:02:58] have to have big words to approach god
[2:03:01] you just got to accept it in your heart
[2:03:03] once you accept it in your heart god
[2:03:05] will make it
[2:03:07] manifest
[2:03:08] that seed has to come to life
[2:03:14] there's one quote i want to bring and i
[2:03:16] i've gotta
[2:03:18] now so you could understand
[2:03:20] in the latest in church age brother man
[2:03:22] says now to show you that he was the
[2:03:24] first also as he was he the beginning of
[2:03:28] the creation of god oh
[2:03:30] do you catch it that used to stumble me
[2:03:32] all the time the creation of god god is
[2:03:34] eternal what he's talking about right he
[2:03:37] says see how god could be created if
[2:03:40] he's a spirit how could he be
[2:03:43] he's eternal he never was created he
[2:03:46] never will be created because he was god
[2:03:50] at the beginning
[2:03:51] but he that is the beginning of the
[2:03:53] creation of god was jesus christ
[2:03:56] amen you talking about the body you talk
[2:03:59] about the body
[2:04:01] but the spirit was eternal yes god is
[2:04:04] eternal but he he created jesus it was
[2:04:07] his own blood it was his own dna it was
[2:04:10] everything god mary and joseph had
[2:04:13] nothing to do with it
[2:04:17] i used to wonder did jesus look more
[2:04:19] like mary or did he look like joseph
[2:04:21] neither
[2:04:24] it was the blood of god
[2:04:27] it was a new creation
[2:04:30] and the creation of god was jesus christ
[2:04:32] when he was made manifest when god lived
[2:04:36] in him that's what made him a son
[2:04:39] the created part made him a son that's
[2:04:42] what makes you sons and daughters the
[2:04:44] created part but that eternal life had
[2:04:48] no beginning nor ending
[2:04:51] yeah it takes faith and faith to bring
[2:04:54] to revelation
[2:04:55] he is god created creation oh my that's
[2:04:59] why jesus said father people say see
[2:05:01] there's two no there wasn't
[2:05:04] that wasn't two and it wasn't three
[2:05:07] if the fullness of god dwelling in a
[2:05:09] body
[2:05:12] hallelujah and all that was in god he
[2:05:14] poured it into christ
[2:05:16] and all that was in christ he poured it
[2:05:18] into his bride
[2:05:19] he is god creation oh my sheep the first
[2:05:23] and the last
[2:05:25] the amen the beginning the creation of
[2:05:27] god when god created and if you can see
[2:05:29] that you can see your creation
[2:05:32] yeah yeah i know i know i understand i
[2:05:35] hear you but when the revelation of this
[2:05:37] message fully come to you you'll
[2:05:39] understand what's being said
[2:05:42] that's what happens
[2:05:43] you know and and you got to understand
[2:05:46] when god brings it in plain language you
[2:05:49] know that you know
[2:05:51] how can i say it
[2:05:54] right now the message i'm preaching now
[2:05:55] if i go preaching in the denomination
[2:05:57] they'll be hopping over the benches
[2:06:02] they would
[2:06:03] because they never heard it before
[2:06:05] but because we've heard it before oh
[2:06:07] yeah
[2:06:09] come on
[2:06:10] mm-hmm
[2:06:12] the joy is left
[2:06:15] but there are certain things
[2:06:17] that i eat
[2:06:19] i get happy every time
[2:06:25] it's true
[2:06:26] i get happy every time
[2:06:28] you know some of my friends and i'm
[2:06:30] closing some of my friends
[2:06:35] what people don't understand is that
[2:06:37] let's say it like this
[2:06:40] i love my friends
[2:06:43] i love my family
[2:06:46] but there is no way
[2:06:49] i would judge god
[2:06:51] being unfair
[2:06:54] because he chose me and not them
[2:06:59] there's nothing i did
[2:07:01] the only thing that made him choose me
[2:07:03] is because i was in him
[2:07:07] and everything that was in him he chose
[2:07:11] and when it comes to that i i'm not
[2:07:13] responsible
[2:07:15] i i really believe that even when the
[2:07:17] disciples found out that judas was the
[2:07:19] devil it hurt their feelings
[2:07:22] but none of them backslid dry brother
[2:07:24] right
[2:07:27] understand that everything we go through
[2:07:28] people said predestination let me tell
[2:07:30] you what predestination is based upon
[2:07:32] also predestination is based upon your
[2:07:34] choosing
[2:07:35] yes sir yes sir because what you did
[2:07:38] before the foundation of girl be well
[2:07:40] you chose him you chose to stand with
[2:07:42] him then and he said because you chose
[2:07:44] to stand with me then i will stand with
[2:07:46] you now
[2:07:47] that's what it is
[2:07:49] you chose
[2:07:52] visual hawaii yeah well god ain't fair
[2:07:54] he sent people to hell no god don't send
[2:07:57] nobody to hell you go to hell because
[2:07:59] you want to go right right you fight
[2:08:01] your way to hell because you refuse and
[2:08:04] and people refuse they meant to believe
[2:08:07] the truth right but if i got up here and
[2:08:09] i told you a lie a lot of times people
[2:08:12] love lies
[2:08:14] it's the truth
[2:08:16] you don't believe it but let me tell you
[2:08:17] something look at our look at our uh
[2:08:20] government
[2:08:23] you ain't never seen so many liars in
[2:08:25] your life
[2:08:27] and everybody loves it
[2:08:30] it has gotten to the place that that
[2:08:31] spirit is falling on everybody that's
[2:08:33] why that's why you better watch your
[2:08:35] bankers
[2:08:36] you better watch your insurance people
[2:08:38] you better watch everybody because
[2:08:40] everybody now is
[2:08:42] they just they've been anointed with
[2:08:44] lies
[2:08:44] they love to do it
[2:08:46] if the president can lie i can lie
[2:08:49] if the president swear i can swear
[2:08:52] y'all understand me
[2:08:53] people imitate folks and think it's okay
[2:08:55] because this person do it in that person
[2:08:57] listen i don't care who oh
[2:09:00] what they do
[2:09:02] i love truth
[2:09:06] i love my country and i love truth
[2:09:10] and i'll say it like this by the grace
[2:09:12] of god
[2:09:13] this message has come in the right time
[2:09:15] in the right season
[2:09:18] and i'll tell you just like there's none
[2:09:20] of us
[2:09:23] none of us
[2:09:27] how could i say it
[2:09:30] deserves it
[2:09:34] this is nothing but the mercy and grace
[2:09:35] of god
[2:09:37] and i'm gonna close because i took i
[2:09:38] took a long time last night and i
[2:09:40] probably took a long time this morning
[2:09:42] but let me say it like this people of
[2:09:44] god
[2:09:49] certain things i can eat
[2:09:51] and if i don't restrain myself i'll get
[2:09:53] sick because i keep taking to eat it
[2:09:54] because i like it so much
[2:09:56] i used to be hung up on chocolate like
[2:09:59] that i used to eat chocolate
[2:10:01] till i think it was coming out of the
[2:10:02] pores of my skin
[2:10:05] and god i said lord you got to deliver
[2:10:07] me from this
[2:10:09] and the lord delivered me from it
[2:10:12] and and now i can eat chocolate but i
[2:10:14] just don't like it like i used to but
[2:10:16] what i'm trying to say is that when you
[2:10:18] eat something and you and it's really
[2:10:19] good you say don't you have more of it
[2:10:23] and i'm like that with watermelon in the
[2:10:25] summertime
[2:10:27] when watermelon if i can find me a good
[2:10:29] one
[2:10:30] i go back to the store looking for the
[2:10:31] same one
[2:10:33] hoping they got the same sweetness you
[2:10:35] know what i'm saying it's it's something
[2:10:37] about the thing that's good you always
[2:10:38] want more of it
[2:10:40] and when this bible like like john said
[2:10:43] i ate it
[2:10:44] and it was sweet as honey
[2:10:47] now i don't know whether you ever had
[2:10:49] that experience but i'm gonna tell you
[2:10:50] sometimes preachers be preaching and you
[2:10:52] can almost taste that word right
[2:10:54] yeah
[2:10:57] i know y'all think i'm crazy but it's
[2:10:58] like oh my god that's nice you can
[2:11:01] almost lick your lips because it's so
[2:11:02] sweet
[2:11:03] it's a spiritual thing i'm speaking of
[2:11:05] now but this is a it's an experience
[2:11:07] i've
[2:11:08] had and and you know the priest says i'm
[2:11:11] gonna stop no say oh no no no don't stop
[2:11:13] now why because it's so sweet to you you
[2:11:16] want more of it
[2:11:18] yes
[2:11:20] but sometimes you know you get to a
[2:11:22] service and you think that they've got
[2:11:24] the better part already
[2:11:28] ah let me stop
[2:11:30] god is good to us amen i hope you've
[2:11:32] been blessed today
[2:11:34] coach i'm gonna tell you something until
[2:11:36] we get desperate and god gonna bring the
[2:11:38] desperation
[2:11:40] you can't you can't turn it on
[2:11:42] god has to bring circumstances because
[2:11:45] we as people we are lazy
[2:11:48] that's our man is sometimes god has to
[2:11:50] put the whip to him push him or
[2:11:52] something to drive him to make him do
[2:11:54] what he needs him to do
[2:11:56] and that's what's happening right now
[2:11:58] god is going to do it
[2:12:00] brother i'm going to call it the squeeze
[2:12:01] when though when the world council of
[2:12:03] churches began to come down on you and
[2:12:06] people of god whether you see it or not
[2:12:08] it's closing in
[2:12:10] it looks innocent right
[2:12:12] because it looked like okay the world is
[2:12:14] against the conservatives but most
[2:12:16] conservative consider themselves as
[2:12:18] christians
[2:12:21] they don't want to hear the bible
[2:12:23] they want nothing to do with the bible
[2:12:25] you may not even be a conservative but
[2:12:27] if you're a christian
[2:12:29] just being a christian
[2:12:31] uh people are now shutting down on you
[2:12:35] they are
[2:12:36] because they they link you to being a
[2:12:38] conservative y'all understand what i'm
[2:12:39] trying to say right but this thing is
[2:12:41] going to swing in a moment and and i
[2:12:43] know everybody says oh it's going to get
[2:12:45] better no it's not going to get better
[2:12:47] the bible said evil seduces and all
[2:12:50] whacks worse and worse
[2:12:51] and so you got to understand if you're
[2:12:53] not ready now the best thing to do is
[2:12:55] get ready now because when it becomes
[2:12:57] worse
[2:12:59] you know what they're doing in australia
[2:13:01] you know what they're doing in israel
[2:13:04] i mean this not the mark of the beast
[2:13:06] but it's coming to be that it's it's
[2:13:08] moving into that channel
[2:13:10] the next thing is is that the churches
[2:13:12] are gonna raise up
[2:13:15] watch it folks i know y'all think i'm
[2:13:17] crazy they're going to raise up and
[2:13:19] they're going to unite and then they're
[2:13:21] going to start forcing things
[2:13:25] and there is no way
[2:13:27] amen this thing will
[2:13:29] even get to the mark of the beast
[2:13:31] without bloodshed
[2:13:34] y'all understand what i'm saying it's
[2:13:35] coming
[2:13:37] and and what you gonna do
[2:13:40] you little lamb
[2:13:46] what you gonna do
[2:13:49] that's the time you pray
[2:13:52] now because your character now will will
[2:13:54] be tested to the max
[2:13:58] will you come out swinging you know like
[2:14:01] peter don't you attack my word
[2:14:06] all right
[2:14:08] what you gonna do
[2:14:11] i'll tell you what you do
[2:14:13] remember this
[2:14:16] he was led to a slaughter
[2:14:20] a sheep led to the slaughter and the
[2:14:22] bible said he opened not his mouth
[2:14:26] gonna come to that
[2:14:28] if the same nature that was in in the in
[2:14:31] in smyrna age and those ages where they
[2:14:33] persecuted where these people ran
[2:14:37] to their deaths
[2:14:40] huh
[2:14:41] they weren't afraid to die who afraid to
[2:14:43] die in here
[2:14:44] if you are you need jesus
[2:14:48] i'm not afraid
[2:14:51] and i know by god's grace i would die
[2:14:53] for any of you in here
[2:14:55] without even thinking about it
[2:14:57] somebody come through the door whatever
[2:14:58] says who going to die in front of it for
[2:15:00] these people i could truly say i would
[2:15:02] be the one
[2:15:03] because i'm not afraid and i realized
[2:15:06] that everything after if i die
[2:15:08] everything will be taken care of
[2:15:13] y'all know what i'm saying
[2:15:15] death is just just a vehicle to get you
[2:15:18] to the place where god is intending for
[2:15:19] you to be
[2:15:20] heaven and so don't be afraid
[2:15:25] you you get you get to a place you get
[2:15:27] hungry and i'm gonna tell you something
[2:15:28] god does some miracles for my life all
[2:15:30] the time
[2:15:31] in in in and i'm closing you may stand
[2:15:33] so i could you could help me out
[2:15:36] you know but god always mirror he just
[2:15:39] do miracles

[2:15:59] and as soon as i and then here come a
[2:16:01] blessing
[2:16:04] uh you know and don't don't think i'm
[2:16:06] pulling for nothing i'm not but i'm
[2:16:08] trying to tell you you don't have to
[2:16:09] worry about nothing that's right
[2:16:12] you oh where i'm gonna pay this and how
[2:16:14] i'm gonna pay my bill don't worry about
[2:16:16] it
[2:16:16] put it in the master's hand
[2:16:19] we still got real christians yeah amen
[2:16:23] i think i told this story i'm a close
[2:16:26] my mama she's always been my a great
[2:16:29] example for me she's gone on to be with
[2:16:30] the lord
[2:16:32] but my mom
[2:16:34] she was such a prayer warrior and i'm
[2:16:36] always praying and asking god to at
[2:16:38] least give me half of what she had i
[2:16:40] think i'll be okay
[2:16:42] but she used to pray she should pray for
[2:16:44] hours hours hours
[2:16:48] one thing my mom would say junior
[2:16:51] god gonna bless us with bob
[2:16:53] this today
[2:16:55] and there were times i would halfway
[2:16:57] here
[2:16:59] and you know when i would halfway here
[2:17:01] god would always make it so that i would
[2:17:03] be there when it happened
[2:17:08] he made me a believer before i became a
[2:17:11] believer
[2:17:13] that's why nobody can take away the
[2:17:15] supernatural i seen supernatural before
[2:17:18] i became a believer you understand what
[2:17:20] i'm saying before i became a christian i
[2:17:22] saw that
[2:17:23] and what i'm trying to say is that you
[2:17:25] and i have the power and the authority
[2:17:27] to put the devil under your feet why
[2:17:28] don't you do it
[2:17:30] because the devil is going to make you a
[2:17:31] slave why not make him one
[2:17:34] you got the authority you got the power
[2:17:36] you need to place your life in god's
[2:17:38] hand to the devil get get confused about
[2:17:41] you well i know he used to do this and i
[2:17:43] know how you could do that on her and
[2:17:45] she would do exactly what i said and now
[2:17:47] he comes again and he knocks him on the
[2:17:49] door ain't nobody home
[2:17:51] the man or the woman that used to live
[2:17:53] here don't live no more
[2:17:55] y'all know what i'm saying
[2:17:57] people of god i don't know maybe i'm
[2:17:58] just envisioning something that's not
[2:18:00] real
[2:18:01] but in my vision i see perfection
[2:18:05] i see god
[2:18:06] and i'm not stopping until it's there
[2:18:09] to the full manifestation of jesus
[2:18:11] christ is living through me in every
[2:18:14] respect i expect in my life of my life
[2:18:18] let's bow the word of prayer
[2:18:19] father god i come before you i i see
[2:18:22] what you're doing i see the time and the
[2:18:24] seasons that we're in and lord jesus i i
[2:18:27] know that without you lord that we can't
[2:18:29] accomplish any of these things
[2:18:31] but lord i know father you promised it
[2:18:34] lord and we're the promised seed you
[2:18:36] promised uh you know
[2:18:39] isaac and rebecca you you told them uh
[2:18:42] you know what would come and you told
[2:18:44] them lord god who the the children that
[2:18:47] they would have and lord you promised oh
[2:18:49] god you know uh uh abraham and sarah and
[2:18:54] that promise he came not ishmael but
[2:18:56] isaac
[2:18:57] it moves on it keeps moving it keeps
[2:18:59] moving it keeps moving
[2:19:01] and and even though jacob was the
[2:19:03] firstborn you you told uh rebecca that
[2:19:06] jacob
[2:19:07] would not be the heir
[2:19:09] lord that it would be uh isaac and oh
[2:19:12] god it moves on it moves on and here we
[2:19:15] are lord there were many christians way
[2:19:17] before us millions of them but the
[2:19:20] promising
[2:19:21] that last they see that seed that would
[2:19:24] come into the very development of you
[2:19:26] coming to the very fullness of you oh
[2:19:28] god we thought christians were just
[2:19:30] people that went to church and sing and
[2:19:32] you know shouted and danced and you know
[2:19:35] all of those things we just thought you
[2:19:37] know being a christian was something on
[2:19:38] that line but we didn't understand the
[2:19:41] born-again part we didn't understand
[2:19:43] that being born again was being born of
[2:19:45] you and to be born of you is to be born
[2:19:47] of a god and to be born of a god is to
[2:19:49] become a god and that god is you lord
[2:19:51] not us
[2:19:53] but christ in us we're growing up to be
[2:19:56] like you
[2:19:57] father i pray lord jesus that you have
[2:20:00] mercy on us forgive us from all our
[2:20:02] unbelief even though we know that
[2:20:04] unbelief can't stop you
[2:20:06] whatever you will to be done will be
[2:20:08] done lord
[2:20:10] hallelujah
[2:20:11] because the devil don't believe doesn't
[2:20:13] mean that he's not going to be thrown
[2:20:15] into the lake of the fire
[2:20:17] lord and because we stumble sometimes
[2:20:20] and come short doesn't mean that we
[2:20:21] won't reach our goal because father not
[2:20:24] one portion of your word
[2:20:26] can come back to your void
[2:20:29] i am so grateful
[2:20:31] i am so grateful
[2:20:33] and father i think about it sometime
[2:20:35] that even so lord
[2:20:37] if you decide to
[2:20:39] not have me go to heaven
[2:20:41] i can't help but to worship you even now
[2:20:44] because lord you've given me a part of
[2:20:46] peace of heaven even on earth
[2:20:49] and lord my life has been changed
[2:20:52] my life has been changed and it's still
[2:20:54] changing from glory to glory not because
[2:20:56] of me but because of you and the words
[2:20:58] that you promised that would be you said
[2:21:01] in all of us lord that he that begun the
[2:21:03] good work in us is faithful to complete
[2:21:05] it i trust you lord
[2:21:07] i trust your word
[2:21:09] i trust your prophecies i trust all of
[2:21:12] your promises fatherly
[2:21:14] and lord god your god
[2:21:18] and even
[2:21:21] as job said
[2:21:24] i'll wait till my change comes
[2:21:28] have thy no way
[2:21:31] lord
[2:21:32] with the young people the people here
[2:21:35] those who are listening
[2:21:37] attentively lord i pray that the word
[2:21:39] found place the things that i did not
[2:21:41] say i pray that somehow you reveal to
[2:21:44] them in their spirit the things that
[2:21:46] was needed to be said
[2:21:48] forgive us lord god if we said anything
[2:21:50] contrary to your word
[2:21:52] i ask that you wipe it out of the minds
[2:21:54] and the spirits of the people
[2:21:57] my odd harsh desire was to
[2:22:00] so
[2:22:01] perfect
