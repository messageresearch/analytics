TRANSCRIPT
========================================
earlier this year we visited the seven seals and the seven thunders i'm sorry the seventh seal rather and the seven thunders and that was a real blessing i've got numerous emails around the world from those couple of sermons there so i'm glad it was a blessing and hopefully this will be a good revisit as well by the grace of the lord revelation chapter six verse one and two we'll just read the first seal here by god's grace this was of course requested by brother amen so last time since we only requested the seven thunder so anyone else has any other requests you know we'd like to be able to minister to those by the grace of god and preach those you know this really is what defines us this is what separates us from other churches the revelation that god has done in this day praise god god always has a message of the hour there's always something there's always prophecy god is fulfilling in every age this is the prophecy that god has fulfilled in our day praise god the mysteries of god must be finished aren't you glad they're finished amen they're revealed all the bible defined mysteries are finished they are revealed praise god revelation chapter 6 verses 1 and 2. let's just read this together if we can hear on three one two three and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see and i saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer may god add his blessing to ring of his word you may be seated god bless you i have uh some scriptures i'd like to show here today so i can switch over when you're ready some of this is a little bit of a review from when i did preach on seven thunders as far as uh and then the seven seals and remember the seven seals have three forms so i'm not gonna have a lot of time to be able to revisit that so the last time i preached this was 2010 so almost 13 years ago so it's been a while since we went through these um so it's good brother amen you know that's before you came buddy my god um so it's been quite a while and as i told you these are some of the most important studies the holy spirit ever led me on was the seven church ages and the seven seals preached over 120 i think sermons on the book of revelation and so it was just it was foundational i needed to understand the book of revelation you know to understand almost everything else which makes sense it is the climax book is the fine the finale of the entire written text of the bible um and then as we saw last week brother simon shared how brother branham said satan hates two books of the bible the most genesis and revelation his origin and then also uh in revelation yes it speaks of his demise but also unmasks all his tricks it unmasked that as well so that's why he hates it not just his demise of course he knows he and all the fallen angels will be burned and annihilated and done away with in the lake of fire but it unmasked him and his work through the false church and the beasts uh the beast out of the sea and all the wicked beasts here of course of the book of revelation but thank god there's some good beasts in there too amen hallelujah hallelujah thank god for his mercy and his grace so i guess we'll just start right here let's revisit the seven seals here and the deeds of nicolaitans well i think we'll enjoy this here by the grace of god i'm a little tired today is everyone a little tired today seems like uh yeah me too nature me too it was a it was a long week you know it was a long work you know we had monday off you know but i feel like the pressure of five days or squeezed into four and then yesterday you know i worked kind of hard outside a little bit at the end of the day and kind of wore myself out so it's kind of my fault i just kind of felt like i got to get this yard work done uh so i'm a little tired today so forgive me i'm going to try to trust the spirit of god will anoint me as we just sang amen anoint you by god's grace brother ram said you know i heard him say it this week he said usually on sunday morning everybody comes in real refreshed and then so you see then you're tired in the evening service you know so um i'm a little tired this morning so i just need god's help and i trust god to speak to us here today so let's revisit this we read our texts here now there are numerous resources if you'd like more on this i'm not going to be able to cover everything it's a tremendous topic but there's at least four resources you know i have free books out there you can take as many of those books as you want there's seven church ages books out there seven seals the revelation of the seven seal books out there and i would encourage you you know i mentioned this on wednesday we must grow in grace and the knowledge and that's what a lot of message people don't do they don't grow in knowledge or understanding of the word of god and uh i was listening to different uh it's called productivity guys they're productivity uh experts and they said and they showed by by research if you want to become an expert in any subject you must apply 10 000 hours of deep study into it now think about think about your job by the email how many hours you had to go to school right for that job but if anything about the hours of training uh and and the hours you know that you put into that brother brother austin now as a supervisor i think if you really want to become an expert at that position you need at least 10 000 hours that's what they find and that's for any topic and the reason i say that is because if you just do two hours a day on a subject it takes you 14 years to become an expert on that death and that's that's really what i get as a pastor i get two to three hours of study every morning i try to study before i come to work before i go to work and then on the weekend i get a little extra hours you know um but think about that if you want to be we're not we're not ever trying to call ourselves experts but we do want to know god so we would never label like oh i'm a message expert or i'm a christian expert that's not what that's that's prideful we're not trying to give ourselves ex labels as an expert that's not the point i'm making but the point i'm making is if you want to grow in knowledge of god you've got to put significant time into it what i mean is coming to church two or three times a week is good but you need more than that because it and and uh you know it's proven by the american education system you can take uh you know the the number of of baptist presbyterian denominational students the number of them of the students that fall away when they go to college is astronomical it's like 80 or 90 of kids raised in church with just a couple hours of services each week when they go to college all those hours at college brainwashes them and all those spirits of evolution and you know lgbt whatever all those letters all that all those hours in there they become experts on lies in other words if people don't devote significant time to growing in the knowledge of god they can fall away from it right we've all seen it people can come to our church for years every sunday not most of them don't come every wednesday some of them can be there every sunday for years uh and they'll skip sunday nights you know or whatever whatever they feel like to do but but then if they don't take the time in between those services to really draw close to god and grow in knowledge they'll feel that time becoming experts on other subjects or other relationships that are not holy and then they'll eventually fall away from the faith we've seen over and over you know over and over so in other words what i'm saying is that if you want to grow in grace you've got to devote significant time outside of church into investing in the things of god and the knowledge of god praise god and so we have uh those free books and then you know uh brother amen asked me to put together a playlist on youtube so i put that together of all my book of revelation videos i haven't got to revelation 17-22 i just kind of felt led to stop and i started dealing with the tape church topics and all these other topics but at some point in the future i hope to finish those but if you want a chapter summary of of the first 16 chapters we have that uh chapter seven in this book uh it's over 80 pages you know uh all on the book of revelation here and then uh brother simon's brother simon put out the video of the deeds of nicholas he did an hour long or maybe two hour long bible study on that one and that's available on the living waters tabernacle web or youtube channel if you want to watch that it's actually their highest rated video the most views of all their other video services you know has been that deeds of the nicolaitans so i think those are some good resources uh i'm sure i'll think of other resources you know but that's a good place to get started if you want to really grow in grace and knowledge of the lord on these topics and uh you know so these are some quotes from long ago when i used to put different colors on there you know so 10 years 12 years ago brother ram said of all the times i've ever been in the pulpit at the tabernacle i've never never in any time in my ministry ever worked into the realms of god in the spiritual realms as it's been this time it's beyond anything i ever did in any time of my ministry in any meeting at anywhere like this mostly it's on healing this is revealing of truth by the same spirit hallelujah so the holy spirit would work with brother branham in visions for divine healing that was a great anointing but he says even greater than divine healing was the spiritual realms when i would see visions in able to give us thus saith the lord on the word of god now that's true that's totally true because think about it you know church i've been reading i just read through ezekiel right now i'm in jeremiah and over and over god tells jeremiah tell them thus saith the lord thus saith the lord thus saith the lord in other words jeremiah is hearing directly from god and giving the people thus saith the lord and and very few people have that ability it's a very small group that can hear directly from god and then pass that on to the people so they have thus saith the lord hallelujah in that last chapter in chapter 13 of this book i have 31 thus saith the lords from brother branham in that last chapter we have been blessed to be able to have the bible revealed to us with thus saith the lord not thus saith of the southern baptist convention not thus saith jesse smith or not thus saith william branham but thus saith the lord god amen hallelujah that's the blessing that we have praise god which which proves to us whenever we come up against an adversary or someone who descends against us we don't have to worry about anything because we can take everything we believe right back to the bible in fact we had that on monday night buddy but it was all in love it was very good it was all in love we had that on monday night so this week we had someone probably questioned me for like at least two hours we were questioning back and forth on everything yeah i remember monday night uh and everything there was an answer for on the major things now the minor things like flat earth i didn't go i don't have enough state the lord on flat earth or spirit that's a funny topic around here it makes me laugh somebody just sent me another email about it from overseas this week i'm like oh here we go again i don't know man but for two hours straight this person asked me the question after a question and i i was so stirred up i had to go draw it on the paper and i wrote all the scriptures three parts of man and he's like oh i've never seen that before never seen that before never but we've seen it praise god amen we've seen it because god showed it to a prophet hallelujah that's why we can say we've got thus saith the lord because god showed it to a prophet give us thus state the lord and thus saith the lord will always point back to thus saith the bible so i just love times like that and after i drew it up it was all chicken scratch i'm like oh i'll throw that away he's like oh no no let me keep that so these revelations are so great that he just wants to you know he went at that moment at that moment he wanted to keep him and save him for later and everything he told me there was his ideas there was no scripture for it but everything i told him there was scripture for church when we when we heard this message we heard thus saith the lord amen amen we heard the thoughts of god directed back to the bible praise god and that's how i know we've got the truth praise god because everything that we've been taught we can take it right back to the scripture and it's not thus saith uh william branham or not thus saith clarence larkin or thus saith ormond neville but it's thus saith the lord god almighty and his name is the lord jesus christ amen so again the the spiritual workings of revelation are greater than the spiritual workings of divine healing he says i've been to myself all together now how how do you get in these spiritual realms there it is right there amen how do you get in these spiritual realms spend time with god alone amen you want if you want these spiritual realms of knowledge and revelation you've got to spend time alone with god in prayer and study spend time with your heavenly father your father can't wait till you can talk to his child amen that's right i've been boarding at a place uh going down eating at a place i've been just alone so it's been a really good time huh you can be alone and have a good time yes because really you're not alone god is with you praise god hallelujah he said okay so he says i just so i must just get to myself a little while the human mind can only stand so much and when you get to a spot where you're at an hour numbed with the presence of god and the pillar of light hanging there before you you can't stay there too long the human being can't stand it and i i have some charts at the end where i'll show brother ram's revelation on the seven seals is totally different from clarence larkin it's totally different from uh charles tays russell and and i've did a podcast about that that's what they're accusing brother branham of and these people they say they're researchers but they're not researchers they're propagandists that's right because i've done the research i've read the books i've spent the time in there now i got one more guy to research that's uriah smith from the seventh day of venice now they have some things right modesty they've got some things right now they got that saturday all mixed up they boy they they sure they sure that's that's their major if you worship on sunday you are catholic well then paul was a catholic because paul worshipped on the first day of the week preached so long people fell asleep he didn't uh he did feet washing and communion on set on sunday praise god uh that you know you pointed those scriptures they said oh that's just that was just one time no that wasn't history says it was all the time so these you know it's fine people got to have their they got to have their their creeds but we don't want man's creeds we want the truth we want true doctrine praise god it produces the true life of christ surely does now i know it's a lot of words there but i'm going to read it god is the evil age brother man says the seven seals help the bride see the deception the antichrist and the serpent seed people right the bride of christ is vowed to christ he is the word not even wink at the other side a woman should not even wink at another man she should make no signs no emotions at all towards him for she's absolutely a bride to one bridegroom we don't want none of you your mixed trees your denominations be true to christ the word he'll vindicate it to be true all right brother austin he'll vindicate it it's true you're telling me that on the phone on thursday night god will back up his word we don't want none of your i'm sorry yeah no sir not even any emotion or anything towards making love to him not join his ranks or anything else or let let you get him in his arms or his care or talk you over this way that way you listen to only one voice my sheep know my voice a stranger he says they'll not follow what is his voice any man's voice is his word and that is it the bible god's voice is the bible praise god hallelujah and i want to be an expert in this book right here i appreciate all the other books i appreciate the silence and i appreciate because god created science you know i appreciate that but one thing i want to be really understanding is god's holy word not one word to be added to it or taken from it just stay right with the voice a stranger that won't follow denomination as she is part of the groom true to him at every point waiting the wedding uniting not at the economical council but in the sky the wedding supper she has been given for this is our own church she's been given and revealed to her the seven seal mysteries of the bible she sees the folly of the deceiver so very close to the truth that almost deceived the elected she sees it she sees the two opposing spirits that work in the evil age can you see it each very religious cain and abel spirits again coming to their heads still same as they started one worshiping by beauty and by knowledge and by education by science and by ethics and the other one by faith of the revelation the word of god both of them is standing right in this building this morning this is what he said in the goddess evil age isn't that something a lot of those guys in that building were brandon worshippers but they were just as religious i'm just going to call his name fred sothman died years ago he was a branham worshiper they got video of him before he died saying brother branham is jesus christ and he said right there he was on the board of trustees he's the one that he's one of the ones that kicked out brother neville from the live preaching they kicked out the pastor and they brought a pastor that would just press play now look he says they're both in the building this morning the antichrist and the true spirit of christ in the same building how are they known those who are true to the word of god amen those that will add to the word those that would uh take away from the word that's the cursed children but the true children of god take only god's word they only hear jesus's voice hallelujah that's right revelation or faith in his word makes no claims of knowledge the real christian have you got a doctor's degree makes no claims i believe his word see doesn't make any claims doesn't claim to be educated doesn't belong to any denomination any party any sect it belongs to christ it's his wife not a church wife she's a prostitute the bible said she's a and the mother of harlots and they all come together to make the same and that kind of woman is a woman that's untrue to her husband and claiming christ as her husband and belonging to denomination such nonsense you belong to christ hallelujah so what's our mission in the church age book remember i'm i'm going to get past these quotes i don't have too many quotes left remember this and let's not forget this church christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it luke warm formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works attempted destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word right down to the time he's cast in the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the true spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern that's what simon preached on discernment by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her oh hallelujah he will be as definitely thwarted today as when christ wishes his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them ah let's all shout amen can we amen hallelujah that's the power of revelation with revelation your life satan can come against you he'll come against you like a flood but he will not overcome you praise god you will rally you will rally where the standard is being waived the standard is the banner the flag when the enemy comes in you'll see where god's people are being united you'll see where christ is rallying us he's rattling us around the revealed word of today praise god and the answer is always get back to the word obey the word confess sins created me a clean heart oh god i said lord give me my first love amen let people see jesus in me hallelujah that's always the answer amen fellowship with god so we must discern the two spirits and withstand the evil spirit that's what the seven seals are all about now remember church brother francis he said don't forget this he said don't forget it remember all the days of your life these beasts are correct it's thus saith the lord that's quite a statement it's quite a statement because i have when i was reading charles tate's russell the founder of the jehovah's witness church he said that when those beasts went forth they were just like different things like love and judgment and just four anointings for like all christians for all time and then he said that those beasts even failed he said those beasts failed yeah i've i've have the quote of that i put that on the podcast he said the beast can fail but you see here we have a totally different a revelation from a prophet amen who sees up into heaven and sees those four beasts and he knows those those four beasts surround the throne of god they protect the throne of god they are god's throne guards amen in other words god always has protection god will always protect his people and who is going to defeat god's beast it's impossible those are god's powers those are god's choices those are god's anointings upon you and i the christian church has always been invincible amen in church we stand that way today as long as we stay with god's word as long as we stay under the anointing we will be invincible praise god i had an interview at school on friday and they said you talk fast so i'm saying i'm trying to talk slower here today about god's grace i was talking about the kids and this child in particular she's like you talk fast mr smith i'm like i better slow down this invisalign makes it harder too i better slow down let's look at the timing here i just get so excited i just want to say it all right now but let's look at the timing here i i preached this earlier this year so out of the seven seals the timing of the first seal was from when the holy ghost fell about 385 a.d that's when the persecution really started church in the state second seal was the time persecution started to the dark ages started and this is these are rough dates uh the dark ages was about 1095 to 1906 uh and then of course the eagle anointing was from uh brother graham's uh zeus's the holy ghost found azusa street the gifts and everything uh to present day that's the timing of the first four seals i just want you to see that the fifth seal of course is after the rapture because there's no beasts anymore you don't see any more beasts and we did that in the bible study i think last sunday night if i'm not mistaken we did the fifth seal bible study i'll send a good question on that one and then the sixth seal is the the last three and a half years of tribulation of daniel's 70 weeks that last half of the 70th week and then the seventh seal the timing of that is unknown it's the day and hour of the rapture praise god okay so let's break this down a little bit more here so with the first seal it lasts from the first church age to the middle of the third church age and this is the white horse anointing which is the antichrist spirit against the lion anointing and we'll look at these individually but i just want you to see the dates and broken down again so you had satan's spirit of deception against a powerful lying anointing of the holy ghost the boldness of a lie in the bible says in the book of proverbs the second seal was around 385 to the beginning of the church ages so from the middle of the third church age uh to finishing the fifth church age i'm sorry fourth church age rather and that was the red horse which is persecution and killing of saints versus the ox anointing okay and then the third seal was the dark ages uh and of course this is the end of the dark ages uh 1095 and of course this is this is during the fourth fifth and sixth church ages so this is the the third seal is the law the longest in time of years as far as in terms of years it's the longest uh time that a beast was combating a writer a horse rider and then the fourth seal was 1906 to the present it's just the seventh church age it's the pale pale horse which is death the antichrist spirit uh against our anointing the flying eagle anointing praise god okay so there's there's a visual of it uh here's a timeline of the church ages now here you have three forms of the seals i'm not going to spend much time on this because i already preached on this a few months ago john got the symbol form of the seven seals around 90 a.d the reality form is what we're talking today so the the first seal the reality form lasted from 30 a.d to about 395 my dates a little off here should be over here so i grew my revelation of the seven seals my understanding of it uh the red horse would be during this time period the black horse was during these three church ages thirty years sardis in philadelphia and then uh the fourth horse rider and the fourth beast is in this last church age okay i have copies of these if you'd like them be happy to share them with you yeah and then the revelation form came in 1963 brother brown gave us the revelation of the seven seals now we know what they are all right now this was on the video sorry it's blurry i couldn't find this so i just had to do a screenshot of it this is another look at it so this is basically the see these colors back here white red black and pale so i just put them down here white red black and pale so you can see it now pale is actually a yellowish that's that's actually not the right color if you look it up in the greek it's a yellowish pale color okay so see the white horse rider rode uh into the third church age uh the red horse was third and fourth into the fourth and then the four the next black horse was next three church ages and then this last horse pale horse flying eagle was only in the seven church age okay so that's just like a a timeline of that praise god have i lost anybody hope i haven't lost anybody if so actually i got all these resources you can i want you to take them home i want you to study them i want you to pray i want you to see god i want you to enjoy them praise god now let's look at the first four seals we'll go in depth here now this is a much better picture of the four uh horse riders there's two applications these four horse riders is the the antichrist spirit riding throughout the last 2000 years but they also it's also satan's trick how to ride into someone's life or how to influence someone's life it's the same tactics you can't get away from that it's the same tactics because satan doesn't just like god don't change his ways satan doesn't change his ways either okay now before i do that though four is always the number of uh we always see four and i i just put it i put a whole section i got a whole page on the fours in the bible okay so you'll see how there's four horse riders there's four beasts that combat those four writers there's always four there's so uh and james one says there's four steps to spiritual corruption lust enticed lust conceived sin and then death praise god delilah deceived samson on the fourth attempt the first three he kind of lied to her the fourth one was the time that he got her i'm sorry that she got him sorry all right israel now it also works for the other way god restores jews by four steps also typing the four beasts uh in ezekiel 37 the dry bones vision the bones got sanu on them flesh skin and then they got the breath of god because because if satan attacks him for god restores him for hallelujah and those four uh beast anointings in heaven are the four anointings of the holy spirit jesus was the fourth man in the fire in daniel chapter three with the three hebrew children always 4 israel was delivered from egypt in the fourth generation hallelujah job was delivered by the fourth friend not the first three elif eliphaz bildad and zofor but elihu allahu on the fourth one that brought the deliverance praise god hallelujah yes and then satan destroys through the four insects palmer worm locus cankerworm caterpillar that's in joel chapter one and two before the four steps everybody see that by god's grace this is a completely biblical concept totally biblical and only a prophet glory could point out all these fours and all these numbers and all these beasts all these symbols only a prophet who stood in the presence of the pillar of fire could tell us all these symbols all these dates and get it right praise god and it lines up exactly with everything in history and the word of god oh hallelujah thank god amen oh it's beautiful so let's look at the symbols we'll go kind of slow here and this is my same powerpoint from 2010 i just tried to make the words a little bigger and remember i like powerpoint sometimes because it gives you a visual i'm a visual learner like i took a test recently on that at school that everybody had to take a test i turned out to be a visual and audio auditorial learner that's what i turned out that's exactly what i am i like to listen to it i like to see it other people they got to like feel it they got to touch it you know they got to build it so the the first uh stage was the lion anointing of the holy ghost versus the satanic white horse rider now the lion beast these anointings were the anointings for the true church brother adam said this anointing was the living word it was word made manifest in the holy spirit he said now white for satan represents deception or innocence or false teaching or a false teaching ministry and of course a horse represents a spiritual power let's go to the book of job here real quick i'll just pull that out there that was such a blessing when i found that years actually preaching this series here i think it's job 20 something i know i find it in this bible because this was the bible i was using when i when the lord showed me that here a horse is a power if anybody finds it before that let me know there it is yep so job 39 sorry it took me a little longer to find that one thanks for your patience job 39 verse 19. hallelujah see all these symbols brother adam gives are absolutely scriptural praise god he now church did he read those yes he read uriah smith he admits it he read larkin he read charles takes russell but then the holy ghost would show him the truth they were just guessing they were just probing but brother adam got thus saith the lord on it praise god and those guys miss with us saith the lord did you know charles hayes russell and uriah smith constantly predicted the coming of the lord and they kept missing the dates and so right before they died they predicted another day he'd come back or another year and they missed that one too they always miss now see that's what i think i think brother man just got caught up in that that's why he said the 1977 thing but it was never thus saith the lord hallelujah church but see he was around he was influenced by that he saw that and then he saw these numbers remember the 50 jubilees he said oh my it works out to 1977. he's so he just said he said i'm not prophesying but it looks like it will be see because he was reading those men not church that's the truth for you and i whatever we read let me say like this whatever we watch that's what influences us and as humans we're all going to make mistakes sometimes we won't make a mistake with us say the lord because we're not prophets we will make those things lord statements but we got to be careful whatever we're reading whatever we're watching we've got to be careful it's going to influence us and we have to make sure we wait on the lord as we heard last sunday consult the lord first pray first ask god first and then speak after you hear from god consult god about it first okay so yeah job 39 19 hast thou given the horse strength hast thou clothed his neck with thunder can't thou make him afraid as a grasshopper of the glory of his nostrils is terrible he path in the valley and rejoices in his strength he goeth on to meet the armed men he mocketh that fear now look how powerful is oh a war horse laughs at fear and it's not a frighten you can't scare a war horse according to according to elahu neither turneth he back from the sword he'll run right into the sword the quiver wrath against him the glittering spear and the shield he swallowed the ground with fierceness and rage neither believeth he that is the sound of the trumpet he saith among the trumpets ha ha a horse laughs at trumpets and he smelled the battle far off and the thunder of the captains and the shouting is a horse of power absolutely now i wrote another one on here in my bible years and years ago let's read that one jeremiah 8 verse 6. that must be important if i wrote it in red in my bible jeremiah 8 verse 6. yeah there it is i hearkened and heard but they spake not a right no man repented him of his wickedness saying what have i done every one turn to his course as the horse rushest into the battle amen let's say amen can we amen so a horse is a power this is a satanic power though now i'm not going to read all this but let me read the colored words but the man says and watch the one that went to meet him the lion the lion of the tribe of judah which is the word when his false teaching went forth the true word went to meet him when the antichrist was writing with the false teaching god sent his teaching out the word the line of the tribe of judah which is the word made manifest in the holy spirit and the holy spirit there to manifest himself which is the word that's the reason the early church had healings and miracles and visions of power is because it is the living word in the form of the line of the tribe of judah riding out to combat that amen brother branham said now here's why here's why a lot of message people they attack the teaching ministry in fact a lot of message preachers they are against any teaching at all because they've been so scarred by false teachers one way i don't blame them but another way they've got to be able to discern those two spirits in the framework of the church but abraham said the first beast of god that went out to meet the antichrist was the antichrist spirit when it said it's just his teaching now remember when the antichrist first wrote he was in a teaching ministry the antichrist rode first in a teaching ministry that's why you know as i showed you a few weeks ago the most popular message preachers today they don't do teaching anymore uh because so there's been so many false teachers out there and doctrine sometimes can seem like a word they don't want to say but jesus said if you if you know god you'll do true doctrine if you know god's true doctrine it will actually show you god is with you that's what jesus says amen so we could name different teachers you know false teachers down through the years you know jeff jenkins uh we could name lee vale joseph coleman there's been a lot of false message teachers that have come out and i'm gonna i might preach a whole series on that i might just say a few there be that find it i might put that in there and show how people can fall away the ones that were closer to brother ram most of them fell away and why is that it's just like the solomon syndrome they stopped seeking the lord and when you stop seeking god and when you get content with your walk with god you are on the way down i'm on the any of us i'm on the way down any of us are on the way down when we stop seeking god we stop seeking this council we've got to constantly seek god amen as i said our father wants to spend time with us we got to talk to the father if we want to walk in the father's past we got to hear his voice amen and that's why these people around brother brown and who is satan attacking hardest the ones around the message of the hour that's why a lot of these guys turn out to be perverts adulterers fornicators homosexual kingdom builders money launderers they turned out to be that because satan is attacking them and if they don't withstand that they're going to be deceived by it by satan and that fits exactly these four horse riders they start with a false teaching right and then it becomes a war and then they start building their kingdom with money and then spiritual death is the last state i don't know i don't let me say this plainly because someone might misunderstand this i don't know their salvation that's up to them in god i know god is merciful and i know god is rich in mercy but many times as even nature shows the way a tree the way a tree leans is the way a tree falls hopefully they had some uh repentance at the end of their life like a thief on the cross hopefully they had some repentance on their deathbed that's all we can say but see that's why people today are against teaching because we've had so many false teachers but that doesn't take away the fact that there's five five teaching gifts and you need all five praise god you need all five if you're going to be uh brought into the full stature of jesus christ hallelujah thank god so the symbols he who is he he's the antichrist spirit he kills by the spirit of spiritual kill with false teaching his what's his bow the bible said he has a bow his bow is his tongue that's used for lies his lies are the arrows that he shot out and the fact it has no arrows uh so brother man says he's a bluffer he has a lot of thunder but no lightning but christ had a sword go out of his mouth amen hallelujah praise god amen thank god there's a great difference in church if you listen to 1960 1961 i think it's the the ten the ten virgins and the hundred forty four thousand and listen to uh revelation uh the revelation series brother random actually calls the revelation six white horse rider the holy spirit he actually thought it was the holy spirit but then three years later the holy spirit came in the room and said it's not me it's the antichrist and he says when he preaches the first seal he said i would have made an awful mistake if it wasn't for about noon today when the holy spirit swept through the room amen and corrected me on the mistake i was fixing to say hallelujah he said i was going to just going to take it from a previous text that i already preached so who rescued brother brandon from a false doctrine the holy spirit who's going to rescue you out of any false any false doctrines or any of your lust of the flesh or lust of the eyes or pride of life who's going to rescue you the holy spirit amen glory but you gotta let him sleep sweep into your room amen you got to spend time with him and he'll sweep into your room hallelujah i believe he'll sweep in the surface as well but what i'm saying is many times when we're in those battles it's when we're not here it's when we're at home we're going through tough battles that's what i'm saying that's what i'm saying we got to constantly seek the face of god like i heard that brother say it the brother from louisiana preached a good sermon i listened to it it was good he said we are secure but we must always be seeking we're secure but seeking that's my testimony i'm secure in my salvation i know jesus save me from the life of sin i know he filled me with the holy ghost praise god i see power in my life i'm a witness of jesus christ but i must keep seeking jesus christ or else i get tired and lazy i get tempted by the things of the world just like any other person because i'm human i got a dual nature disorder praise god right i said it on wednesday i gotta do not do personalities i've got dual natures amen i've got a white dog holy i got a black dog unholy and i gotta make sure i feed that white dog amen hallelujah and then i stay strong and then when the enemy comes in then i rally to the flag i rally with the saints i rally with jesus i rally with the believers but if not i'll be tempted and i'll fall short of god's glory just like you just like all of us see we got to be secure but seeking in other words like jesus said he that hungers and thirsts after righteousness will be filled in his human mind now i'm adding that because that that's the revelation you got to get filled in your in your soul yes but each day we've got to keep hungering and thirsting for righteousness glory so so here's the symbol he had a bow the antichrist had a bow and the bible said they'd bend their tongues like their bow for lies so the tongue the i'm sorry so the bow the antichrist had it was his lying tongue where they call a snake a fork tongue no no they call that that's what he had but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth so the antichrist will not stand up for the full truth the antichrist will inject some false doctrine and they know not me saith the lord they don't know christ and christ is the word but see a sword comes out of christ's mouth amen and out of his mouth go with a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations now look he's given these nations thousands of years to repent thou two thousand years to repent and finally at armageddon he said i've had enough repentance now comes judgment you had time to repent and the sad part was satan deceived all those nations to rally against the king of kings and lord of lords thank god he rescued you out of that thank god jesus rescued out of that and you're not with that army but you're a part of that white robe that white horse heavenly army hallelujah thank god that he rescued us amen from the lies of this world and he's brought us to the truth of the revelation of the holy spirit abraham said the writer has no arrows for his bow did you notice he had a bow but there's nothing said about having any arrows so he must be a bluffer see he doesn't speak the truth he lies satan always lies maybe he's got a lot of thunder no lightning but you find christ had both thunder and lightning for out of his mouth goes a sharp two-edged sword and he smites the nations but this guy god can't smite anything he's playing the part of a hypocrite so he's a false teacher at the beginning that's what we got to be careful you know with teaching i got to be careful teaching but man said teach he said oh i just love teaching he said teaching he says gives the church the foundation and he said teaching positionally places them so they know where they're standing but he said the teacher is on thin ice and he's got to be careful he's i so i've got to be careful when i do teach this morning i'm teaching kind of like reviewing the teaching right i'm not teaching anything new i've got to be careful i'm being nice because if you go so far in teaching you can mistake something and then what you've done remember teaching is instruction then you've instructed the people how to sin are you with me that's why teaching is always thin ice that's why if you have any questions please raise your hand at our sunday night meetings i don't want to i don't want to i don't want to influence anybody wrong i want to influence people to the holy spirit i want to be right praise god how many want to be right so a crowd was given to this writer a crown was given to that white horse rider and brother adam said that's the literal crown that was given to the writer after he became incarnate in the pope or the false prophet right around 3 8 right around the 300s i've read the name of the first pope i think i want to say damascus it's in my book uh i'm not mistaken damascus was the first pope now that the catholic church says peter now we know peter was notebook peter had a wife uh popes don't have wives because they're a false doctrine i believe it was damascus what i'm mistaken now notice this this white horse conquers and that's what exactly what jesus said they he uses nicolaitism to conquer the laity now church this is where you got to do your part i've got to come anointed to church but you've got to come anointed the church satan's whole desire is to make you think oh you have to come to church anointed god don't want to use you today it's okay to be tired every every service i'm tired today but i'm not tired of every service i definitely wasn't tired on wednesday night by god's grace we had a good time in the lord once a day always preaching over again you know get under the anointing that is satan's trick he wants to make you think you have no part in the service but your part is just as important as mine musicians just as important as me each one of you just as important and god cannot accomplish as much as he could if we're not all in the holy spirit that's the first trick of the holy spirit is nicoletism conquer the how can i get the people to stop desiring the anointing of the holy spirit that's why you got to seek it at home that's why you got to become an expert can i say like that you've got to become a spiritual expert in the things of god hallelujah you've got to you're also going to become an expert in something else you don't want to become an expert in the ways of the world i always hope i always hope i'm not an expert in the latest most famous movies and musicians and video games i love when the kids say i have some new kids coming this year you know oh mr smith did you see this i'm like i don't even know that i'm not gonna watch that i don't know what it is i like to praise god amen i'm not an expert in disney praise god i'm not an expert in minecraft what's another one they do fortnite yes oh my goodness i'm not an expert in fortnite have you played a mr president no i haven't and i don't let my children play it either i don't want to be an expert in worldly things i want to be an expert in spiritual things amen and not self-proclaimed but just i want to be mature the bible calls that's the word stature the stature of a perfect man that means the maturity of a perfect man that's what the word means in the greek the maturity of a complete man or woman we want to be mature we want to be mature spiritual people honor your expert on the seals glory so nobody can deceive me amen that's why i told emma in the house last night that's what my dad told me that's the greatest advice i ever had know jesus christ so well no man or no woman can deceive you no church can deceive you no false prophet can deceive you no devil and hell can deceive you because you've met jesus and you know him hallelujah amen hallelujah i'm feeling good i'm not tired anymore sir that satan's first trick is to conquer the people so they only look to the preacher as long as he's anointed then we had a good servant no you got to be anointed too praise god like we're going to get to sister naomi's testimony in different ones and that's when we need everyone's anointing when there's needs in the church and that's a blessing other people are anointed to pray i can't pray down every blessing from heaven i get tired i get i get in the flesh i i'm just one person praise god we've all got to have a leading of the holy spirit we've all got to be feel led well god is leading me to do this god's leading me to say that they that are led by the spirit of god are the sons of god glory now here's the good thing bro simon brought up because i i forgot the three last week's sister emma she's probably heard it a hundred times which is good um last week simon said the decent nickelodeon's had three parts and i was like i forgot that i'm going to go ask him what it was because i forgot in the first church day jesus said this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of nicolaians which i also hate and so the deeds of nicolaitans was first to group the church into different groups so preachers and everybody else well you can't fellowship with us because you know we're preachers i'm kind of glad there's only one preacher in our church at least at least right now nobody could just you don't fellowship with anybody you know the only fellowships with the preachers i want to fellowship with everybody but that look look at the look at the catholic church that's what they did right they got priests and they got everybody else rankings right like brother brooks his sermon from michigan a few weeks ago he said he said the spirit of nicolaims was working around him he said one preacher come up to him and said hey brother brooks did you did you hear you're in the top 10 best preachers in the message so someone out there i don't know who it is but someone is so carnal they're actually ranking the preachers about who's the best preachers i don't know who it is it's probably a small group because i haven't heard it you know it's probably just some frustum way off our group but that's the spirit of satan right to rank oh he's better she's better you know you're not as good she's not as good he's not as good that's the spirit of satan and then the third attribute is authority beyond the local assembly right and you see that all the time with mega churches they call campuses we're a mega church but we've got eight other campuses right and then the personality he's usually a big strong guy or a handsome guy or talks really smooth or something like that usually smooth and real positive you know i probably know what i'm talking about but they have all these they have all these campuses and they have authority over more than one congregation and that's wrong nobody has that only a pastor has authority over a local congregation so that's kingdom building that's what satan does see because what we do in akron may be different than napoleon what we do in akron maybe look different than sheffield or or michigan because god has a different assignment for each one of us now we can learn from other churches but we don't have to copy them word for word or event for event so there's three attributes so group oh well i'm not a preacher i'm not a song leader i'm not a deacon i must have i must have no anointing for the service well you put yourself in the wrong group because we're all in the same group together we all got the holy ghost we all got the anointing but god can use all of our prayers that's right let's not rank one another and of course this one deals with me authority beyond the local now here's where brother adam says it in chapter 10 um nicolet as a doctrine he said the separation the clergy from the lady grew from the biblical truth of the elders shepherds ruling the flock by the words of the deeds of nicoletanes wherein the clergy set themselves in ranks one over the other to the clergy the preachers which unscriptural formula then evolved into a priesthood that placed the clergy between man and god giving the clergy certain rights all the while denying the lady their god-given rights like you see in their in their confessional boxes like simon showed a person a senator someone who sinned doesn't have to go tell a priest you can go right to jesus the roman priest isn't your mediator jesus is your mediator now if you want to come tell me the bible says sometimes you got to confess your sins and you know to others that might make you feel good you can tell me but you don't have to tell me in the line you have to tell simon you have to tell anybody your sin in particular unless you want to but it's mandated there we went to that church buoy and we went to that church those catholic church and they talked about well make sure you get here on saturday for confession it's from three to four that's the last place i'm gonna talk to somebody who's in there about my problems that priest got a lot more problems than what i got he's trusting the bread and blood's got literal life in it no sir no sir he thinks he's got to talk to god holding these beads i don't need beads i don't need bread i don't need wine i need one thing i need a sincere heart praise god i say this i need one else thing i need faith in the son of god amen hallelujah he's my mediator not a man see denying the laity your god-given rights see sisters like i said as preachers before sisters you have their god-given right to all nine gifts in the holy spirit right every god-given right the nine gifts of the holy spirit that includes word of knowledge and word of wisdom a woman a sister who's got the holy ghost can give wisdom to another man and tell him this is what you do and this is when you do it and the church said that's always a hard one for us not our church but that's other message here that's a hard one oh a woman's going to tell me what to do that's a chauvinistic prideful attitude my goodness and that's what satan gets people on you know that's what he gets them in you know pushing down the women you know and uh men ruling with the wrong spirit they're there to rule by the word but not by chauvinism and pride and arrogance that's not how we roll we rule by the word and then we allow the sisters to operate in all nine gifts of the holy spirit thank god thank god this was a serbation in the age it became a doctrine how many do it on time okay then it was established in the church as assured word of god which indeed it was not so see the brotherhood gives the example of today we have priests and laity in the roman catholic church it wasn't always that way it evolved into that now what's it going to evolve to in the message if you know we are well actually we already evolved into the message preachers have all the anointing it's basically the same thing in many messed churches preachers have become the priests and you've got to go through the preacher you've got to confess to the preacher you don't have to confess to me the bible says if you confess your sins and you mean it jesus is faithful and just to forgive you and cleanse you of all unrighteousness you only got to tell me if you want to you have to tell me i don't know i don't have to know sometimes i don't want to know you wouldn't want to know my battles like i love that donnie reagan quote if if god allowed all of our evil thoughts to be placed up on the screen here we'd all we'd all leave in about 30 seconds there'd be no one here for church brother jesse thought that about me brother sister kristen said that or thought that or brother william thought that about so-and-so i thought that was a really wise thing to say see because we're trusting in the blood of jesus christ i've got two and eight two natures i'm battling with one i love and one i hate but then my flesh loves it you know but my flesh is enmity against the holy spirit praise god ah see it works like that even though we don't call me a messenger church as catholic churches if it's not careful the deeds of nickelodeon gets in there and then it sets oh the priests are so much more high so much more holy now there is this idea why the in the old testament the people would run to the prophets that's because they had gifts they could hear from god but not every new testament preacher is a prophet right now let me say like this i think i was telling this to amen last week if certain people we know have gifts in the church it's okay to go to them pray first pray first i need i need some more amens on that pray first ah that's it in other words talk to god first because you don't want to bother that person it might not be the will of god for you to ask that person but you want to pray first and then go to that person say brother or sister could you pray about this i've seen in the past you know god's spoken to you with wisdom or knowledge or god's heard your prayers you've had faith these certain times and i know god has used your gift of faith situation now that's really humble praise god that's recognizing it's just not all through the preachers the holy ghost is in every person every person has a gift of the holy ghost now in my book i gave some real life examples of the deeds of the nicolaitans that happened in the early church and this is where we're going to get into some some differences of opinion maybe with other churches beginning in 41 a.d this is 11 years after the holy ghost fell the first church of rome slowly and consistently added pagan deeds into their worship until they rejected the traditional holy passover observance because remember most of them were jews at that time most christians were jews when the holy ghost first fell fully embracing the pagan easter feast of ishtar when polycarp arrived around 150 a.d the faithful bishop also detested their wicked deeds of idolizing statues and eucharist worship so where did satan work first in the church of rome in their holiday celebrations we got halloween coming up oh it's the worst time of the year for right so we hate going to the stores we hate going driving by all those skeleton signs that they got outside in their yards i don't like this time of year you got christmas easter all these holidays what does satan do look he attacks you on your day off holiday's a day off holy day instead of making it holy he makes it unholy what was his first this is not what rather this is what i could find brother william in the history the history books that i read i read two books why did it happen uh that's that woman rachel has the time and then i read uh edward i forget his last name but he's a good historian edward i can't remember his last name it's in my office here and the first signs of these and nicoletanes was with our holidays okay and so satan perverted their holiday celebrations okay and then now but by 150 a.d they had literal statues of peter polycarp said he walked in and he just sat down on the pew the history says and he saw each person walk in and bow down to the statue of peter before they would go take eucharist in the first church of rome it used to be a holy ghost-filled church but what happened all the holy ghost-filled saints left because they're false doctrines holy ghost-filled people will not stay in a church with false doctrine amen the man said they can't stay in those cold informal lukewarm churches they got to go a place where it's hot hallelujah where they feel the flame of god the fire of god how do you burn away their lustful thoughts and their lustful desires their lustful deeds and their selfishness it burns away all their sinful loss amen hallelujah but that's why christmas is a big debate among some people right or christmas is the main one that i can think of easter is some for some people but see satan likes to get into holidays and as i said before but if god brother may have a christmas tree well it must not have been a sin for him but other people can worship a christmas tree and those are usually the rich people in the church usually right yeah because they got all the money they can decorate the tree they can buy the fancy as gifts so they're the ones who are easily most easily deceived into commercialism now me when i read jeremiah 10 i just can't do a christmas tree at my house i just can't do it if you want to do i'll say like this you want to do a christmas tree let's do it scripturally was jesus tree yes was the tree cut down yes jesus was crucified but when he rose what he looked like did he have gold and silver all over him he was white robed if you want to do it right put white all over your christmas tree okay right don't put reindeer on the christmas tree reindeer have nothing to do with salvation right if you want to put a sash across that christmas tree like revelation chapter one go ahead he was gird gird about with the loins with i'm sorry gird about his paps with a sash you can put a golden sash across it see i just can't do that i just can't do that but see we got to be careful on our our days off or in other words the areas of liberty we got to be careful satan doesn't start there and pervert our our experience with god there's nothing wrong with giving a gift to a person just don't feel pressure i got to give one back that's when it gets wrong right they give it because they want to give it if they're giving you a gift just to get a gift back give them the gift back say no thanks i can't afford it this year you know just give it back i'll say no thanks i'm not celebrating christmas this year but nothing's wrong with me wanting to give my children gifts and reminding them remember god gave us the greatest gift there ever was his holy son and that holy son grew up and died and became the lamb of god who took away your sin amen nothing's wrong with that brother ma'am thank up until the very last sermons brother man was constantly thanking people for all the christmas gifts listen dude i've listened to the last three or four sermons this last few weeks he's constantly thanking people thank you for the christmas gift merry christmas thank you there's a way you can do it without getting into sin so what they changed first holidays and they put statues now that hopefully that would never be us i know that'll never be us but you know in generations people may put statues uh in the churches i was just looking over there because i was thinking about some people some people idolized the pillar of fire picture by the brand you know they you've seen pictures of it they just idolized it's like a statue it's like an idol to them so we have those two holy days let's tell them what i'm sorry statues yeah statues oh yeah eucharist so there's communion and next was the changing of water baptism now thank god we got the right water baptism but there's only one baptism but they change the baptism they remove lord jesus christ and put father son holy ghost and then they added the deed of pouring water or sprinkling instead of full immersion okay so they got to baptism there's four things they change right there so these are examples of deeds or a preacher well i'm gonna be pastor of a couple churches now okay so is that okay if i'm the pastor of a couple of churches now yeah well you know we're preachers we're more holy than you so we're gonna go seek god together and know no brothers and sisters you can't join us because we're more holy nothing or you know i'm i'm top five preacher no i just i reached number five i moved up from number seven this preacher preached something wrong so that moved me up to number five this week ridiculous the devil also conquered the people by the deed of exalting the clergy above the laity clergy men were given more power than allotted by god ignatius who died early in the second century erd by giving to the bishop a prominent prominence and authority not only unknown in the new testament but also what was claimed by clement okay and there's something i left out there children's baptism or baby infant baptism i left that i thought is anyone see infant baptism in there okay i must have missed it spread yesterday that must be it i thought i put infant baptism in there so i have to go check it out it must be somewhere else in the book now notice uh the white horse rider was crowned now i don't know if this is the real crown i found this back in 2010 online i can't find it well i haven't searched for it since then here's the website so i need to go look that up but apparently these this this is a crown of a pope i don't know this could be all made up i don't know but apparently these words mean the infallible vicar of jesus christ the supreme governor of the world of earth the father of nations and kings so apparently this is uh pope pius xi tiara or crowd now of course the crown was given to him earlier you know the earlier pope but this is an example of some crown apparently that belonged to pope pius xi apparently i don't know but it sure looks like a catholic relic doesn't it and and that this is basically what they do they make the pope infallible when he's speaking from peter's basilica that's right there in their in their catechism he's infallible when he sits on peter's seat whatever he reads off the paper there okay so now we're ready for the second scene okay i i don't know how far we'd get today i didn't really want to start another series and have to finish it later hopefully i'll finish the trinitarian or the trinity one on uh wednesday night how the train is wrong okay the second seal is the ox anointing for believers ox is a beast of sacrifice and these saints gave their lives just as freely as they could give them the red represents bloody red the catholic church waded through the blood of everyone that disagreed with him that's absolutely historical of course a horse has a spiritual power power was given in the second seal power is given to the red horse rider to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another so this brother says this is the unity of the church catholic church and the state the roman government and they're given granting power eventually leads to the crusades inquisitions and other wars of conquest in the roman catholic church well and then the bible said a great sword was given to the red horse rider what is that it's the murdering of over 68 million protestants over that uh from the time of saint augustine of hippo until 1586. because the bible said he killed by the sword brother ram said he killed by political power when the church and state united okay very familiar right very familiar the third seal goodness we're getting a little we got past the deeds of nicolet and so is that a good review buddy i need it too buddy so i'm sure it's a good blessing for everybody by god's grace that's the one we got to watch out for the most most of us aren't going to start killing each other right hallelujah i'm sure i'd be the first one killed because i'm the one who speaks all the time uh but satan's going to try to get in through the white horse that deception the false teaching uh separating the preachers from everybody else oh so now they have the man anointing they have anointing of a man but the man says the wisdom of a man which was a power that went forth in the reformers black represents the dark ages so that's so perfect so beautiful so beautiful none but i read uh i read uh larkin and charles says russell neither of them caught that neither of them caught that the black horse rider was the dark ages only brother brandon called that so beautiful so beautiful man dark horse dark ages i mean it's beautiful because bro man said it was a time of midnight to the true believers that was left there was very little spiritual light right because they'd taken the bibles from the people and i'm going to preach on that pretty soon during the dark ages rome controlled almost this whole the whole almost the whole territory of europe and most people didn't have bibles but there were believers on the outskirts of the territory that still had bibles hallelujah amen hallelujah martin and i are irenaeus irenaeus the fourth church age messenger i'm sorry columba columba the fourth church age messenger was credited with keeping the word of god alive amen for all those thousands of years and because of the fourth church age messenger because he started schools and he kept the scrolls glory he kept the bible alive there could there could be a reformation without columbia there could be no reformation there be no martin luther without columbus he church we must find the the prophecy for our day fulfill god's word we must do what god's leading us to do because it will impact the next generation that guy columba impacted all these generations afterwards satan he destroyed it went from like the bible was in 200 languages to the dark age then it was down to one and he destroyed all the bibles kept it all in latin so the people couldn't understand but the holy ghost believers on the outskirts thanks to iranian's work hallelujah they kept marching on amen hiding out in those caves hiding out in those schools of the of the believers that they had actually had schools of the prophets they did they had in the old testament and they had it in the new too in other words god said i'll never leave myself without a witness on this earth lord church you've got to rejoice you're one of those witnesses praise god there aren't many witnesses in akron there's not many witnesses in america but you and i are some of those witnesses that's what jesus said the holy ghost is for to make you a witness unto jerusalem judea and the uttermost parts of the earth even into hackard ohio glory i love this one the white horse so the black horse rider had a pale a pair of balances he was capturing the wealth of the world stripping his subjects of their money he was selling indulgences you could you could slap a priest for a dollar you could rape a virgin for those like two dollars you could murder a man for like five dollars you could pay it either before after you pay it wicked such wickedness but then while he's riding capturing the wealth of the world there's a voice that cried out in the midst of the four beasts amen who is the one who's sitting in the midst of those four anointings is jesus christ the word hallelujah and then a voice cried out a measure wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny that was christ recognizing the writer was charging for the natural staff of life and the indulgences and false spiritual hope that's right that's what satan was doing he was controlling the natural food and the spiritual food but then jesus cried out those beautiful words satan hurt not the oil and the wine satan you cannot touch the baptism of the holy ghost and the stimulation of revelation see church see when christ comes in you he's sealed in you and satan cannot touch your soul praise god your soul can never be lukewarm because jesus said he can't hurt it hallelujah satan can hurt your mind your body but he'll never hurt your soul praise god jesus said hurt that the wine and the oil praise god that's why you need the anointing that's why you gotta listen to sermons you need some stimulation you need something to stir you up because satan can't touch that praise god in other words we're the only ones that can hold back the oil and the wine oh my we do it to ourselves instead of seeking god for oil and why we seek other things but satan cannot touch it he can't hurt it so we can get it back let's get our first love back let's receive the oil and wine amen oh hallelujah thank you jesus i love that revelation satan don't touch that you can't put your hands on my oil and wine i love it whoops wrong button and then we get to rh church and i'm going to read uh my exact words out here because it i felt like it came to me from god i appreciate everybody's support today by god's grace so the ego-like beast is the flying eagle anointing notice he's not an earth-bound creature we're not bound to the things of earth we don't have to be bound satan cannot keep us on the ground we're supposed to be seated in heavenly places seed it means you've got authority right you're resting you're resting in a heavenly position because of this you're resting in a heavenly authority you're sitting in that you're sitting in the victory glory you're reigning you're reigning in the victory that god has given you in heavenly places you're seated with heavenly authority in christ jesus oh the bible's so true hallelujah so beautiful brotherhood calls this the prophetic age or the eagle age of revelation 10 7. ah it's a glorious amen hallelujah every mystery the mystery of god is finished the bible says somebody should write a book on that the pan horse rider but the man said pale is red and white and so mixed together the three in one eternal separation from god the bible said his name that said on him was death brother said god only knows how many he causes spiritually die by his anti-bible teaching think about all the natural death 68 million at least natural deaths how many spiritual deaths of all those popes they couldn't kill and all the all their henchmen and all their all their workers in the vatican that they didn't kill by the sword they just died natural deaths how many of those did satan kill with spiritual death there's the one he put 68 million to the sword and killed him probably billions look billions died spiritually on his false teaching no wonder he could take the name death oh but there's one he takes the name life oh hallelujah he said i am the way the truth and the life i am that living bread that's the one that we're partaking of amen hallelujah thank god the one that sets on the white horse rider the real white horse rider is life jesus christ and notice hell follows him now hell always follows death in the natural when the natural man dies hell follows him that's the grave hades see that's in the natural but in the spiritual it's a lake of fire power was given over to this paris writer this is still future this is still future because brother ham said he's riding now but he's going to take his final ride at armageddon through the antichrist that's in the fourth seal he said the last ride of the incarnate devil in the person the antichrist fulfilling revelation 13 revelation 16 he gathers his subjects to armageddon he will have a power think about that over the fourth part of the earth to kill with hunger and with death and with the beast of the earth a fourth now i just showed you what i just showed you uh there's eight billion people on the earth well after the capture maybe i don't know how many are going to go not many not gonna be many but a fourth of eight is what two two billion he's gonna power over two billion to kill with the sword and with the beast of the earth a fourth of the earth two billion people killed by the sword bob said the beasts of the earth will eat them that's how big this gathering is at armageddon actually there's a pretty good time in here by god's grace usually i start closing at noon usually i start closing on you but let me read this before i get to the differences of the revelation let me read this this is page 480 it's broadband admin broadband was the other historic so there it is right there yes sir about that what is this flying eagle anointing mean if you use the bible a flying eagle anointing is watchfulness that we keep during the church ages because flying eagles are what are they doing up there they're watching for prey and potential adversaries glory because they've got to protect their territory we've seen it when my wife and i go walking we see birds protecting their territory they all do that almost all animals protect their territory wild animals what's a flying eagle do he's looking for food and he's protecting his sky his area of the sky but jesus urges us to sit in heavenly places and watch and pray for a second coming praise god ah there it is amen see we're supposed to rule our authority we're supposed to rule in our position glory god's given me position over this church god's given me position over my family right god's given me a position at my job i've got to rule over it with the anointing of the holy spirit i've got to fly i've got to watch amen i've got to watch i got to be observant i've got to protect the authority that god has given me not give an inch to the devil praise god in other words possess every promise of god if the bible says i can have it if the body if the bible says i can freely have it then i can freely have it for free i can have it for free praise god whether it's love joy peace or patience or long suffering or whatever fruit of the spirit if it's a free gift freely given i can freely have it i've got to protect that though i can't let the devil take any great blessing or any territory that god has given me that's where satan gets people he gets into their job he gets into their relationships he gets into the gifts of the spirit who is that talking to about that saying god and to gift of the holy spirit i forget also talking to somebody about that they gave me a good example i can't remember it now you got to you even have to watch gifts make sure satan doesn't get into the gifts of the holy spirit your family you don't want satan to get in your family start doing damage in the family you got to watch that as eagles we've got to protect our territory watch and pray he says uh yeah i wrote holy ghost-filled saints are rapture-minded meaning their thoughts are on the heavenly meeting in the air from first thessalonians 4 17 our affection should be set on things above like the rapture as colossians 3 1 and 2 declares like a high flying eagle we must press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus see foolish virgins are not called to live as high as we are we're called to live higher because eagles live in the higher heights praise god we have to recognize thank god there's other people safe but if we're an eagle we've got to fly high and we've got to protect our territory and we've got to be watchful praise god that's why that's why god give you that prophetic eyesight praise god you can see the revelations god sent to his prophet remember jesus uses the eagle to represent end-time believers in matthew 24 verses 25-28 for wheresoever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered we must be one of these eagles gathered around the word of god anointed with god's flying eagle power as you know god likens himself unto eagles in revelation 19 verse 4 and also in psalms 103 verse 5 and psalms 40 verse 3 he likens you to an eagle you can renew your strength aren't you glad you can renew your strength praise god church when you get tired don't give up when you get tired don't give in wait upon the lord he'll renew you he'll strengthen you again that power will come again that love will come again hallelujah that enthusiasm that zeal it will come again praise god wait on it praise god wait on the lord don't give up territory while you're waiting though wait on the lord renew your strength and the bible says you'll be renewed like the eagle in other words there must be times the eagle gets tired he gets tired of flying all around he gets tired of you have you seen eagles fight have you seen the videos where they fight in the sky and they're like all their towns are and then they fall down and somebody has to let go whoever let's go first loses and that's how they know who gets the territory well after a while you get kind of tired of fighting all those fights sky fights i'll just call them sky bites and somehow the eagle gets tired all that fighting all that meat for my for my babies in the nest church we get tired too we've got to say god restore my strength renew me make me my old self again oh glory make me that old make me my former zealous self i used to be zealous for these things help me to get my zeal back for the lord amen i think we should all say amen to that amen give me my zeal back make me that eagle i was at first where i love i love to fly and watch over my family i love to watch over the saints and make sure everybody's doing good how's everybody doing are you doing good today how's your week saying to you everybody everybody got what they need you just love to watch over god's people you love to help out you love to be a strength you want to be a blessing you want to be a strength to other people you want your testimony to help out other people hallelujah i love this fourth seal this flying eagle anointing hallelujah so i wrote this jesus strength helps you fly or live above all earth-bound temptations and will eventually lift you in the air to meet jesus at the god now rapture all you scholars out there i'm gonna close with this here i love i love studying the word of god i gotta renew my strength sometimes sometimes it's not so easy to study i need renewed like the ego so there's all these accusations now i was telling this to brother austin just so you know the current side that's left the message they're attacking brother brown they're calling him a racist now they're calling him a polygamist there some of them are even saying he was a homosexual is some of the most awful attacks i'm going to deal with some of them eventually you know when i felt the feel of the holy spirit i remember the other side is worshiping saying him he's god we had somebody tell austin this week that i that the church thinks i'm god remember poor fella he was around me more he'd see more of my mistakes you know but see one side worship i just saw joseph branham's uh blog post from yesterday he said uh there's absolutely nothing wrong on the tapes he said it's all pure it's all fresh water there's nothing wrong on the tapes i mean does this guy even listen to the tapes i don't know i don't know then the other side is by the ram is this he's that he's that he's that he's that one of them is he's a plagiarist and i'm gonna prove to you right now he was no plagiarist remember during the church ages he said i got this from his orange 20 times ten i counted yeah i went back and listened 20 times he said i got this from history but then other times he said i didn't get this from history the holy spirit showed me the church age messengers and that was exactly right brother iran said he got the dates from clarence larkin he did so that that was something he borrowed right or he referenced like any scholar would or any any teacher would and he said that he said the dates weren't given to me by the lord he said but the messengers were and the length of the church ages were given to him by the lord and the seals okay so his revelations differed greatly from clarence larkin who was a baptist and boy he was like i showed you he was a talented talented man he could draw some of those beautiful illustrations that future home and that's gonna be my favorite i think all the time that's a beautiful picture and then he also uh differed from charles hayes russell i've studied these two in depth in depth now i haven't studied because i got an email this week saying uh there's an accusation brother uh plagiarized from uriah smith i started looking into it and nope i did but i got to spend more time i got to just devote some hours to it so brother brown did not plagiarize baptist jobs witnesses or seventh-day adventists and here's the proof so for the seven seals uh larkin said nothing about the seven seals wait this is seven church ages okay yep sorry i did a i did a this is it yeah sorry i was hoping to do the seven seals i just copy and pasted that slide and i hadn't updated yet so sorry so this is the one i did on the podcast so um brother ram said he got the dates from larkin larkin gave no church age messenger so you can't say he plagiarized that now charles says russell the job is witnesses he did do messengers but look who his messenger is paul that's the same saint john was his second messenger the iranians his third messenger was arius he wrote some good things but brother rams was martin russell said peter waldow was the fourth with ramsey columba tay said wickliffe brother man said martin luther tay said luther this the brother man said wesley and russell said he was last but said it was elijah which we know was him there's nobody that can tell me he plagiarized because i went and studied it i've got pictures let me pull this up here i have i did screenshots you know me i took screenshots and i can show the exact quotes from the books i've got the exact quotes they can't so i went through all these seals i can show the exact difference between all of them i just got to update it i haven't put this online yet because i just did the podcast i can show you the exact wording from each man on all these seals how brother ram taught different he did not plagiarize him when he said the holy ghost came in that room church the holy ghost came in that room hallelujah because it's different from everybody else hallelujah when jesus christ came to me through bible's message it was unlike anything i'd ever felt before it was unlike anything i've seen before it was the spirit of holiness i never felt it like that but thank god i never have yet felt anything different and we can't get used to that we've got to enjoy that anointing we know there's something different about this message because this message points us back to the bible praise god the mystery of god should be finished the seven seals unveil satan but it also unveils jesus christ amen let's stand to our feet praise god musicians can come i didn't get to all the quotes but i preached an hour and a half already so i want to stop right there by god's grace is that helpful but amen like i said if you have any other questions you know we can do it next sunday night you know before we do the testimony and so forth that the lord be willing ever enjoy the word today by god's grace church we got to be renewed like the ego praise god we've got to be growing in the understanding of the lord praise god we've got to feast on these things we're going to wait on the lord he will renew our hi there strength power heads here for your word of prayer if you have a need on your heart you can come up here for a special prayer we're happy to join my uh faith

what your prophet preached lord god after 12 years lord it's refreshing to me to see that lord god again your prophet was so honest he said i've read read these i've read those i've read all these but when the spirit came to me he showed me something or we can see it's vindicated in the bible the black horse dark ages the red horse 68 million martyrs the flying eagle the prophetic eyes to finish the mystery of god at the end lord thank you for helping me teach this lord you helped me back there in 2010 12 years ago you're helping me today lord my prayer lord is that we could constantly battle off that white horse rider who's trying to battle against us or maybe we'd even say lord the pale horse rider is trying to get in with deception since that's the current spirit we're battling here at this age lord we know what he wants to do he wants to bring in his false word deeds wants to pervert our lives but lord you promised if we're your bride we would stay faithful to you we'd hear no other voice but the voice of the holy spirit hallelujah and you would wash us in the waters of the world thank you jesus thank you for these revelations lord god shows us the anointing we're living under today shows us that you will keep the bride invincible by the power of the holy spirit as we yield as we trust in you strength will rise as we wait upon the lord amen hallelujah it will rise up

one that brought me out of that denominational system [Music] he brought us out of these denominational systems these horse riders were hurting our churches they're hurting families destroying families but that holy ghost anointing papa eagle came flying by amen and caught us out of the chicken yard hallelujah something different about that message when i heard brother man preach something different about the revelations god gave in this day catches me catches you makes you ready for the coming of the lord praise god aren't you glad to sit in heavenly places i'm so glad i can sit so high up here and i can see the difference between the world and believers i can see the territory god's given me hallelujah i just got to keep fighting praise god i gotta watch and pray for the coming
