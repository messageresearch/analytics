[0:00] hey man what a powerful song that's the
[0:02] first I've heard of that
[0:04] one thing I could say is every time I
[0:06] come here I learned a new song
[0:08] I think today I've learned two
[0:11] so I've got to come here more often just
[0:14] to learn more songs
[0:15] but the scripture says Sing a new song
[0:17] unto the Lord so you know even even us
[0:20] as as Mankind we tend to get tired of
[0:23] the same old song the same old song so
[0:25] it's nice to hear a new song but not to
[0:28] say that the old ones that we put those
[0:29] away and don't sing them anymore they
[0:31] have their place too you know you hear
[0:33] an old hymn and you man I haven't heard
[0:35] this one in a long time and man I will
[0:37] put you in the spirit of worship you
[0:38] amen so the old is just just good with
[0:42] the new so
[0:44] thank you musicians and uh
[0:46] that's what I say thank you very much
[0:49] for the lunch today and the hospitality
[0:51] that's been shown to me and my family
[0:53] no just appreciate you all
[0:56] and I love you all
[0:58] and uh we weren't sure who we were going
[1:00] to do for lunch today
[1:02] so that tells me that brother Jesse
[1:04] didn't have any idea what y'all were
[1:06] planning today
[1:07] so uh
[1:08] it was very nice thank you for letting
[1:11] us be a part of it
[1:13] the
[1:14] it was good uh good being here this
[1:17] morning and looking forward to another
[1:19] evening amen so if you would uh we'll
[1:22] just go right to the word and uh Acts
[1:26] chapter 26.
[1:37] now I must say
[1:39] uh this morning
[1:41] speaking on the Midnight Cry brother
[1:43] amen sorry I guess somebody told me I
[1:45] called you Vang when I called you up by
[1:47] apologies I think I was just looking at
[1:50] brother bang and then when I looked at
[1:51] you his name just came out but uh
[1:55] brother amen told me that brother Jesse
[1:57] had just preached on that subject a
[2:01] little while uh just a couple weeks ago
[2:03] or something
[2:04] which I thought was
[2:06] pretty marvelous I almost asked this
[2:08] morning just the way that uh the Persona
[2:10] was almost asked was this just preached
[2:12] on but anyways uh
[2:16] before I came
[2:17] you know just praying about what I
[2:20] should speak on uh
[2:22] I was you know just praying about I
[2:24] wasn't sure actually a couple months ago
[2:28] uh I really felt led to come and
[2:31] minister to this group and I've told
[2:32] brother Jesse before I will not call you
[2:34] but if the Lord leads you to have me
[2:37] come speak you'll call me and uh so we
[2:40] we've had that relationship uh for years
[2:42] I have never called him and asked to to
[2:44] speak from his pulpit and uh by God's
[2:47] grace I won't ever have to
[2:49] because if the Lord leads he'll put it
[2:51] on his on brother Jesse's heart to to
[2:54] call us and invite us but it was about a
[2:56] couple months ago and and uh that
[2:59] message that I preached this morning
[3:00] that was uh that was really on my heart
[3:02] to to minister but uh I know you're
[3:05] standing so I'll keep it and try to keep
[3:07] it shorter
[3:08] uh I was also thinking on the way here
[3:12] there there was a message that I was
[3:14] thinking about and I I brought five or
[3:16] six messages with me uh today because I
[3:19] wasn't sure uh which way to go for the
[3:21] other message
[3:22] and before I got here I was thinking you
[3:24] know I'll speak on this one and and uh
[3:26] but after morning service I was back
[3:29] here praying Lord what do you want me to
[3:30] speak on on the the afternoon
[3:33] uh
[3:34] brother Jesse and I we got back from
[3:36] getting coffee from Starbucks and I
[3:38] don't drink Starbucks coffee if I don't
[3:40] have to uh
[3:43] but uh I like good old-fashioned Folgers
[3:46] and and uh Black Rifle I like those
[3:50] kinds of coffee but anyhow
[3:53] he was telling me that I think it was
[3:55] Wednesday he said he preached on
[3:57] isolation that that's that just about
[3:59] threw me back I said no way I got that
[4:01] message right in the back here and uh
[4:04] but I uh just praying about it and
[4:08] thinking about it uh I've got to go with
[4:11] what the Lord had led me on this after
[4:13] this morning's service so Lord willing
[4:16] we'll save it for another time brother
[4:17] that uh
[4:20] he also knows and I think I've told you
[4:22] all before that I don't go on
[4:26] uh I don't I don't watch the messages
[4:29] usually I would like to I'd like to
[4:31] watch his videos but I don't if I know
[4:33] I'm coming anytime soon I don't go on
[4:36] the website on purpose because I don't
[4:38] want to see what he preaches because I
[4:40] don't I want to be letter of the Holy
[4:42] Spirit you know I'm I'm addicted to
[4:44] something like that and you ask my
[4:46] family they'll ask well what are you
[4:48] going to speak on there's a brother at
[4:49] the church he just asked me that the
[4:51] other day and uh I keep it a secret I
[4:53] don't tell anybody it's I might have I
[4:56] might have said something six times in
[4:58] the last 20 years of what I'm going to
[5:01] speak on to somebody but I just
[5:04] generally don't like to
[5:06] uh tell people what I'd like to keep it
[5:09] a secret but uh because I want the Lord
[5:11] to work I want to see the the moving of
[5:13] the Lord and uh and I've seen it several
[5:16] times
[5:18] in case in point just this morning and I
[5:21] appreciate that so thank you for the
[5:22] feedback uh so if you would we'll just
[5:25] get into acts Acts chapter yeah Acts
[5:28] chapter 26 and verse 27.
[5:32] we'll just open up with this scripture
[5:34] and go to prayer
[5:41] it says King Agrippa believeth thou the
[5:44] prophets I know that thou believest
[5:48] then Agrippa said unto Paul almost thou
[5:51] persuadeth me to be a Christian
[5:54] and Paul said I would to God that not
[5:57] only thou but also all that hear me this
[6:01] day were both almost and altogether such
[6:04] as I am except these bonds let's look to
[6:07] the Lord of Prayer
[6:09] Heavenly Father
[6:12] Giver of every good gift
[6:14] and
[6:15] the salvation of our souls we just thank
[6:18] you so much Lord I appreciate the song
[6:21] that was that was sung uh being invited
[6:24] out here and just uh just a powerful
[6:26] song it just tells of of how much you
[6:29] thought of us and and how powerful you
[6:31] really are and we just thank you so much
[6:33] uh for including us in that and uh Lord
[6:37] it's nothing that we have done because
[6:39] Lord we fall every day and uh we just
[6:42] depend on you to pick us up we we just
[6:45] bow our heads before you in honor and
[6:47] respect to know what we've when we've
[6:50] done wrong that we come before you with
[6:51] uh with that respect in our hearts to
[6:54] come before you to repent because we
[6:57] feel sorry for the things that we've
[6:58] done Lord we just feel bad for those
[7:01] things that just shows us Lord if that
[7:04] feeling wasn't there that just shows us
[7:05] how right we are in our hearts but Lord
[7:08] when we do something wrong may have
[7:09] prick us so much that that we can't deal
[7:11] with it any longer that we have to come
[7:13] and repent unto you father for there is
[7:15] no other power that we can come to for
[7:17] the remission of sins and and just the
[7:20] Forgiveness that you have for us and
[7:22] Lord help us to have the same heart
[7:23] toward others just as you have taught us
[7:25] to pray that if we want forgiveness that
[7:29] we ought to forgive others so father we
[7:32] just pray that you would be with us one
[7:34] more time this evening as we Minister
[7:35] your word and uh just pray that you
[7:38] would be upon me and just just pray that
[7:41] you would give each and every one of us
[7:42] inspiration this evening and uh just to
[7:45] hear your word and be blessed by it
[7:46] father we ask it all in the name of
[7:48] Jesus Christ amen and amen
[7:51] you may be seated
[7:59] in that same chapter I'd like to go up
[8:01] to the
[8:02] the 19th verse
[8:05] where it says uh whereupon O King
[8:09] Agrippa
[8:10] I was not disobedient unto the heavenly
[8:12] vision
[8:13] is that our heart this evening I I know
[8:16] it's your heart that you want to do
[8:17] right you want to do what the Lord has
[8:19] led to do right
[8:21] but showed first unto them of Damascus
[8:23] and at Jerusalem and throughout all the
[8:27] coasts of Judea
[8:28] and then to the Gentiles
[8:31] that they should repent and turn to God
[8:33] and do Works meet for repentance
[8:37] now see notice what he says there in
[8:39] this next verse he says for these causes
[8:41] the Jews caught me in the temple and
[8:43] went about to kill me it wasn't so much
[8:46] the truth that he was preaching but it
[8:47] was who he was telling the truth to it
[8:51] was to the people that that that the the
[8:53] Jews tended to stay away from they
[8:56] avoided them because uh they just felt
[8:59] uh that they were unworthy and they
[9:02] didn't even want to touch Gentiles they
[9:04] didn't want to they did they didn't want
[9:05] to be associated with them it was a
[9:07] separation that the Jews didn't have uh
[9:10] relationship with anybody else other
[9:12] than Jews right
[9:14] so because Paul went to the Gentiles
[9:17] that's why the the Jews that's why the
[9:20] Jews were upset with him because he had
[9:22] gone to the Gentiles
[9:24] to let them know the same truth that
[9:26] they were supposed to know
[9:29] see verse 22 says having therefore
[9:31] obtained help of God I continue unto
[9:34] this day witnessing both to small and
[9:36] great see he was not a respecter of
[9:39] persons just just going to talk to the
[9:41] governors and the Mayors and and the
[9:43] Senators and congressmans and people
[9:44] like that but he said to the small and
[9:47] to the great so he was preaching to the
[9:49] poor and to the rich and it didn't
[9:51] matter whoever he came in contact with
[9:53] that's who he spoke the truth to amen so
[9:56] we just we're just so grateful for God's
[9:58] ministers to do things just like that if
[10:01] you're poor you want to be spoken to
[10:03] just like a rich person right because
[10:05] you want to be treated as a human being
[10:07] you don't want to be looked down upon
[10:09] just because of the stature that you
[10:11] have just because you barely have 10
[10:14] cents to to rub to two nickels to rub to
[10:16] your uh to your name amen so
[10:19] just being able to hear the truth as
[10:21] Gentiles we are a blessed people amen
[10:24] so witnessing both to small and great
[10:27] saying none other things than those
[10:29] which uh which the prophets of Moses did
[10:32] say should come he didn't say anything
[10:34] outside of the truth but what was
[10:36] already spoken amen
[10:38] that Christ should suffer and that he
[10:40] should be the first that should rise
[10:41] from the dead and should show light unto
[10:43] the people and to the Gentiles and as as
[10:47] he thus spake for himself Festus said
[10:50] with a loud voice Paul Thou Art beside
[10:52] thyself much learning doth make thee man
[10:54] see he thought he was crazy for going to
[10:56] doing these things going and having
[10:58] relationship with the Gentiles and
[11:00] telling them what lies in their
[11:01] scripture amen how dare you show it with
[11:04] an outsider see it was a club to them
[11:06] and if you're in a club you don't invite
[11:09] Outsiders and you don't share the
[11:10] secrets that are within that club to The
[11:13] Outsiders do you have to be a part of it
[11:15] if you wanted to know all the secrets
[11:19] but then in verse 25 it says but he said
[11:21] I am not mad most noble Festus see he
[11:24] even he even spoke with respect to
[11:26] Festus right uh even though that they're
[11:29] they're putting him on trial there he
[11:30] still spoke respectfully to Festus but
[11:33] most noble Festus but speak forth the
[11:35] words of truth and soberness for the
[11:38] king north of these things before whom
[11:40] IO whom also I speak freely for I am
[11:43] persuaded that none of these things are
[11:45] hidden from him for this thing was not
[11:47] done in a corner
[11:50] verse 27 says King Agrippa believeth
[11:53] thou the prophets I know that thou
[11:55] believest
[11:57] then Agrippa said unto Paul almost thou
[12:00] persuadeth me to be a Christian
[12:03] then Paul said I would to God that not
[12:05] only thou but also all that hear me this
[12:08] day were both almost and altogether such
[12:10] as I am except these bonds see he wanted
[12:14] everybody to be free
[12:16] and verse 30 he says and when he had
[12:19] thus spoken the king rose up and the
[12:21] governor and Bernice and they that sat
[12:24] with them
[12:25] and when they were gone aside they they
[12:28] talked between themselves saying this
[12:30] man doeth nothing uh worthy of death or
[12:33] of bonds see they recognize that he
[12:36] didn't do anything wrong the Jews were
[12:37] just upset because he went and spoke to
[12:39] the Gentiles
[12:41] they went outside of the club see then
[12:44] then said Agrippa onto Festus this man
[12:46] might have been said at Liberty if he
[12:48] had not appealed unto Caesar now some
[12:50] people uh reading this they might have
[12:53] the the same kind of thing as a oh man I
[12:57] wish I wouldn't have said anything then
[12:58] I wouldn't have to go to Caesar by them
[13:00] talking right here I could be a free man
[13:02] but sometimes we have to go through an
[13:04] experience that the Lord ordains and we
[13:06] still had to go through those things see
[13:08] it was ordained for Paul to go through
[13:10] that situation amen now see what I'd
[13:13] like to speak on this evening is moved
[13:15] not quickened
[13:17] so we'll we'll get into it moved not
[13:21] quickened or anointed but not alive
[13:30] now some people they get moved and
[13:32] that's it they can't go any further than
[13:33] that
[13:34] but the scripture tells us to go on to
[13:37] Perfection right we can't just say wow
[13:39] that was a good message brother Jesse
[13:42] wow that that just that just touched me
[13:44] right to my heart
[13:46] and then you go and do do what you're
[13:48] not supposed to do as soon as you leave
[13:49] there there wasn't anything real that
[13:51] was there it was just words that sounded
[13:53] good in your ears amen so those words
[13:56] might have been very moving but you've
[13:59] got there there has to be something with
[14:01] that move there has to be something to
[14:03] take place along with that amen it's not
[14:06] it's not good enough just for it to
[14:08] sound good but if it sounded good then
[14:10] you would do what what was told unto you
[14:13] amen
[14:14] but see
[14:16] a a a a painting doesn't get painted
[14:19] just because someone received an
[14:20] inspiration to paint the painting gets
[14:23] painted when somebody gets the
[14:24] inspiration picks up the paintbrush dips
[14:27] it into the paint and begins to paint
[14:30] not just because they received the
[14:32] inspiration but something touched them
[14:34] on the inside and then they brought
[14:35] something alive amen through an image I
[14:38] mean it's not alive that like you and I
[14:39] are alive and and breathing but you
[14:41] under they brought something out as a
[14:44] result of the inspiration
[14:47] but we must must not be hearers only but
[14:49] we must be doers of the word right so
[14:51] when we hear the word
[14:54] yeah that sounds real good
[14:56] yeah I really like that
[14:58] but uh I can't really do that
[15:02] now see when Jesus showed up on the
[15:04] scene things took place right people
[15:06] were moved in their heart
[15:07] something happened when Jesus showed up
[15:09] right see they they knew that something
[15:11] was about they they knew something was
[15:13] about to happen they felt a little bit
[15:15] different you ever notice when the
[15:17] presence comes about you you kind of
[15:19] feel a little bit different you might
[15:20] have felt down a few minutes ago but
[15:22] when you start singing Praise And and
[15:23] giving God the glory and start doing
[15:25] these different things how the feeling
[15:27] of your emotion will change from
[15:30] sorrowful
[15:31] unto happiness and and in a spirit of
[15:34] worship
[15:34] amen
[15:37] but the thing was is when Jesus spoke
[15:39] many people were astonished at what he
[15:42] said they couldn't really understand
[15:43] what he said
[15:45] but it was something different see
[15:47] people want to hear something different
[15:48] they don't want to hear the same thing
[15:50] all the time so that's how it is with a
[15:53] lot of these doctrines out there well we
[15:55] we got to start something different a
[15:57] different Doctrine because I'm I'm tired
[15:58] of all this Holiness stuff we we need to
[16:00] we need to magnify something and that's
[16:04] where man gets involved and that's where
[16:06] these false doctrines come from because
[16:08] somebody wants to look a little bit
[16:10] prettier a little bit more spiritual
[16:11] than the other guy it's not a
[16:13] competition we're preaching the same
[16:15] thing we ought to preach the same thing
[16:17] we're not competing if we're better
[16:18] ministers than the other that doesn't
[16:20] matter I'm going to say hands down I'm
[16:23] the worst preacher that doesn't it
[16:25] doesn't matter how good I am or not
[16:28] I'm preaching to myself now
[16:31] sometimes I get down about it but I I
[16:33] know I'm not the best preacher and it
[16:34] doesn't matter but he's the best God
[16:37] that's who we're preaching about
[16:39] if I can't bring God to you then I need
[16:42] to sit down
[16:45] so there's a difference between being
[16:46] moved amen we'll get into that Matthew
[16:48] 21. and verse 1.
[16:58] it says that when they drew an eye onto
[17:00] Jerusalem
[17:02] and we come to Bethpage
[17:04] unto the Mount of Olives then sent Jesus
[17:07] to disciples saying unto them
[17:09] go into the village over against you and
[17:11] straight away you shall find an ass tied
[17:13] and a cult with her
[17:15] loose them and bring them unto me
[17:18] and if any man say ought unto you you
[17:21] shall say the Lord hath need of them and
[17:23] straightway he will send them
[17:26] all this was done that it might be
[17:27] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[17:29] prophet saying tell ye the daughter of
[17:31] Zion
[17:33] Behold thy King cometh unto thee
[17:37] not just some ordinary man
[17:40] but thy King cometh unto thee Meek and
[17:43] sitting upon an ass and occult the fall
[17:46] of an ass and the disciples went and did
[17:48] as Jesus commanded them and brought the
[17:51] ass and the cult and put on them their
[17:53] clothes and they sat them there on and a
[17:56] very great multitude spread their
[17:58] garments in the way others cut down
[18:00] branches from the trees and strawed them
[18:02] in the way
[18:04] and the multitudes that that went before
[18:06] and that followed cried saying Hosanna
[18:09] to the son of David now Hosanna is a
[18:12] term of adoration so when they're saying
[18:15] Hosanna they are adoring the man that's
[18:17] upon That Ass Up upon that gold right
[18:21] so they're they're giving a term of
[18:23] adoration to this man and it says
[18:26] blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[18:28] the Lord hosanna in the highest and
[18:31] they're giving the highest adoration for
[18:33] this man that looks like looks like just
[18:35] a common man not realizing what the
[18:37] scripture says thy King cometh unto thee
[18:40] amen so he was more than just a common
[18:43] man
[18:44] now see and when they were come and when
[18:47] he was coming to Jerusalem all the city
[18:49] was moved they were moved saying who is
[18:52] this there's a whole group of people
[18:54] here well who is this person
[18:56] and the multitude said this is Jesus the
[18:59] prophet of Nazareth of Galilee now see
[19:02] not realizing that it was their King
[19:05] that was upon that uh
[19:07] that was upon that uh that answer
[19:10] they're just they're just saying that
[19:12] it's a prophet of Nazareth of Galilee
[19:15] some people just leave him as a prophet
[19:17] they can't go on to see him as a messiah
[19:20] they just stop it profit
[19:22] yeah he had a lot of good things to say
[19:25] are you obeying any of it oh
[19:29] right now see moved it means to shake or
[19:33] to agitate to cause the tremble of men
[19:36] to be thrown into a Tremor to Quake for
[19:39] fear metaphorically it means to agitate
[19:42] the mind now see when people saw this
[19:44] when they were when the people were
[19:46] crying hosanna in the highest they were
[19:48] throwing Palms in front of them they
[19:50] threw their clothes down in front of him
[19:51] giving him the highest adoration
[19:55] it agitated them in their mind well who
[19:58] is this type person who is this who is
[20:01] this guy so everybody was flocking
[20:04] around him because they thought it was
[20:05] some a man of great honor there's a
[20:08] governor coming to town is the President
[20:09] coming to town
[20:11] oh it's just the prophet of Nazareth
[20:14] oh it's just a common man
[20:18] but see they were stirred up
[20:21] they didn't understand they couldn't it
[20:23] was a confusing thing for them who is
[20:26] this man why is he drawing this big of a
[20:28] crowd what's going on Mark 15 and 11. it
[20:32] says but the chief priests moved the
[20:34] people that he should rather release
[20:36] Barabbas unto them now see again move
[20:40] means to shake up to stir excite and
[20:42] arouse now see the the when Jesus came
[20:45] into Jerusalem the people were moved so
[20:48] here the chief priests moved the people
[20:51] now see what this this moved it was a
[20:54] little bit different movement see we got
[20:55] all kinds of movements going on what
[20:57] which one is the right movement now see
[20:59] the chief priests they moved the people
[21:01] they influenced them so much to
[21:03] discredit Jesus that they wanted
[21:05] Barabbas instead of Jesus Amen see the
[21:08] different kind of a movement there it
[21:10] was an influence but it was of the wrong
[21:12] influence because it was out of jealousy
[21:16] but if we see the definition of of moved
[21:19] as an agitation or stirring up right see
[21:22] it's something that triggers an emotion
[21:24] but it's the action that happens after
[21:26] the moving that's what matters to show
[21:29] you where you stand amen so when you see
[21:31] something important you hear something
[21:33] in the word of God what's the action
[21:35] that follows that inspiration what's the
[21:37] action that follows your heart that was
[21:39] moved so much
[21:45] but see sometimes this this happens in
[21:48] in the church right you get moved you
[21:50] get into the spirit of worship and and
[21:51] then you're just so moved uh you just
[21:54] want to love everybody until you walk
[21:56] out the door
[21:59] then what happens to the love you you
[22:01] start yelling at somebody or you get
[22:02] agitated in traffic
[22:04] but what just happened in service
[22:07] I thought you removed I thought you felt
[22:10] the blessings of the Holy Spirit
[22:13] oh my this might not be real popular
[22:19] but sometimes people are only stirred up
[22:22] and excited but nothing takes hold
[22:25] people may get all worked up in worship
[22:27] service right some will be blessed and
[22:29] get the victory over something others
[22:30] might end up like a dog return it to his
[22:32] vomit
[22:36] I see it's the action that follows the
[22:39] inspiration
[22:43] to see quickened
[22:45] Romans 8 and 11.
[22:48] this should be a very familiar scripture
[22:50] to every Bible ready reader correct
[22:53] Romans 8 11 it says but if the spirit of
[22:56] him that raised up Jesus from the dead
[22:59] dwell in you he that raised up Christ
[23:02] from the dead shall also Quicken your
[23:04] mortal bodies by his spirit that
[23:07] dwelleth in you and what does Quicken
[23:09] mean
[23:10] I'm glad you asked Quicken means to
[23:12] cause to live it gives life it makes a
[23:15] life uh but it gives life by spiritual
[23:19] power to arouse and to invigorate I
[23:22] thought a pretty uh wow they used
[23:25] invigorate
[23:27] that's such a that's such a big word
[23:31] invigorate
[23:32] [Laughter]
[23:34] okay well what does that mean I didn't
[23:37] get the dictionary definition but but
[23:39] it's a it's like an extreme uh stirring
[23:43] up amen it's a it's an extreme
[23:45] excitement to invigorate to restore to
[23:49] life to give increase of Life thus of a
[23:52] physical life of the spirit quickening
[23:54] as respects the spirit endued with new
[23:58] and greater powers of life and
[24:01] metaphorically it's of of seeds
[24:03] quickened into life germinating
[24:04] springing up growing it means that
[24:07] something has taken place and something
[24:10] is growing something has died on the
[24:12] inside metaphorically about seeds
[24:14] something on the inside has died that's
[24:17] the old man but I've taken on that that
[24:20] movement that's that's something that
[24:22] just came into my heart I can't explain
[24:24] what it is but something's changing from
[24:26] the inside
[24:28] something is happening because I took
[24:30] God at his promise amen
[24:34] it was more than just an inspiration to
[24:36] you it's something now see Christianity
[24:39] isn't isn't just a religion it's a way
[24:41] of life
[24:42] it's a habitual way of life you have to
[24:45] make it become a habit to you
[24:48] it's not just gonna just it's not just
[24:50] gonna happen well those were good words
[24:52] and and uh yeah we want to live by that
[24:54] but if you don't recite them if you
[24:56] don't read them if you don't put them
[24:57] into practice it's not going to do
[24:59] anything for you
[25:02] it just becomes babbling
[25:09] now there's a key difference between
[25:10] movement and action
[25:13] I know I'm getting real uh physics you
[25:16] didn't think you were coming for a
[25:17] school lesson
[25:20] I'm not going to get too deep into the
[25:22] physics but trust me that there's a but
[25:24] if you don't trust me go check up on me
[25:27] uh between movement and action see
[25:30] movement is an effort
[25:32] it makes you feel like you're you're
[25:35] doing something or you're getting
[25:37] somewhere busyness and effort without
[25:39] progress
[25:42] is movement
[25:44] busyness and effort without progress boy
[25:48] you sure look
[25:50] take for instance people people will
[25:52] work harder to get out of work than just
[25:56] actually doing the work
[25:58] that's called laziness
[26:02] trust me I see it you will see people do
[26:04] more work to get out of work I don't get
[26:07] it I don't understand it just do the job
[26:09] you'd have been done in 10 minutes if
[26:10] you'd have just done the job you were
[26:12] supposed to do instead of taking two
[26:13] hours piddling around not doing anything
[26:16] now see that's movement just just moving
[26:18] around making it look like you're doing
[26:20] some work
[26:21] but little progress
[26:24] Luke 10 and 40 it says but Martha was
[26:27] cumbered about much serving and came to
[26:28] him and said Lord does thou not care
[26:31] that my sister hath left me to serve
[26:33] alone bid her therefore that she helped
[26:36] me now she was busy but what was she
[26:39] accomplishing
[26:40] a clean house
[26:42] okay Mary had chosen the better part to
[26:45] sit at Jesus feet and hear truth right
[26:48] you could do the dishes anytime but when
[26:51] Jesus is present give him everything
[26:53] give him your time amen you've got to
[26:55] take time away from those things and
[26:58] give Jesus A Time amen see that's the
[27:00] difference between the Mary and the
[27:02] Martha Martha is just busy and covered
[27:04] about and all worried about uh the the
[27:06] cleanliness and are my shoes shine today
[27:09] well ever something else way better is
[27:12] going on
[27:13] we're not we shouldn't be concerned
[27:15] about the little peddly things we have
[27:17] to be concerned about the important
[27:18] things amen
[27:21] preaching to myself again
[27:24] now action action is effort with a
[27:28] meaningful objective
[27:31] it's accomplishing something action
[27:33] makes something it has you accomplish
[27:37] something something is a finished work
[27:39] when you put action to it
[27:42] or at least it's a begun work anyways
[27:44] but there's something being done when
[27:46] you take action
[27:48] second Peter chapter 1 and verse 21. it
[27:52] says for the prophecy came not in Old
[27:55] Time by the will of man
[27:57] but holy men of God spake as they were
[28:00] moved by the Holy Ghost
[28:03] see but holy men of God spank this is
[28:06] the action
[28:08] why what caused the action that they
[28:10] were moved by the Holy Ghost
[28:13] see in in this moved in this scripture
[28:16] it means to be led or to carry a burden
[28:19] see it's a little bit different
[28:20] definition from the move that we heard a
[28:22] few minutes ago
[28:24] see this is why it behooves us to look
[28:26] at the meanings of words
[28:29] see move means to be letter to carry a
[28:31] burden of the mind to be moved inwardly
[28:34] and prompted it's more than just being
[28:38] inspired
[28:42] being led it's being prompted to do
[28:44] something
[28:50] see we can't force people to to see what
[28:52] we believe right
[28:53] you wish just like just like Paul was
[28:56] telling Festus and Agrippa I wish to God
[28:58] that all of you not not just King
[29:01] equipment not just Festus but everybody
[29:03] in this room that could hear me I wish
[29:05] that they would be in the same condition
[29:06] as me I wish they could see the same
[29:08] truth that I carry
[29:10] this is why I go through the perils that
[29:12] I do
[29:15] this is why he worked so hard and went
[29:18] through what he went through so others
[29:19] would hear the truth
[29:25] this word isn't just for us to Harbor in
[29:27] our hearts it's given to us to share
[29:31] where would we be if somebody didn't
[29:33] share the gospel with us
[29:35] amen
[29:37] now see we can't force people to live as
[29:39] we do
[29:40] people see the sisters and I can't wear
[29:43] skirts all the time I did just address
[29:45] this thing that's just an old-fashioned
[29:47] thing you know
[29:50] but you stand as a witness
[29:52] hey amen you stand as a witness
[29:56] amen
[29:57] it's not for everybody because they
[30:00] can't see it
[30:02] yeah
[30:03] see we're the elect
[30:05] we could only speak the truth the elect
[30:08] can only speak the truth right
[30:10] the bride isn't going to speak anything
[30:12] false not intentionally
[30:14] right right
[30:16] so as we speak the truth we must live
[30:18] the truth that's how people are going to
[30:21] know that it's the truth not just
[30:23] because of what you say it's because of
[30:25] what you do to back it up amen see
[30:28] people think uh it's too modern of an
[30:30] age to live something so old-fashioned
[30:32] but we are a witness against them as
[30:34] long as we stay true to that
[30:38] as long as we stay true to the truth
[30:43] Lord
[30:45] I'm going to read a quote now this is
[30:47] kind of in the middle of it so he this
[30:49] is he's referring to a correction by the
[30:51] word uh that brother Branham was in in
[30:54] this message it's in the anointing ones
[30:56] at the end time so if you want to go
[30:58] back and read it it's before paragraph
[30:59] 124.
[31:01] but he goes on to say this he says oh so
[31:04] many things how could we just go through
[31:06] it our time would be a way but you know
[31:09] enough to know what's right and wrong
[31:14] and how can I make them do it you can't
[31:16] make your child do what's right all the
[31:18] time you teach them to do what's right
[31:20] but it's up to them if they're going to
[31:22] do it right or wrong or not it's up to
[31:24] them if they're going to be obedient or
[31:26] not the same thing with us God can't
[31:27] make us do what's right
[31:30] he's told us what's right it's up to us
[31:32] if we maintain what's right
[31:35] but it's also our responsibility if we
[31:37] don't do what's right
[31:39] it falls upon us
[31:45] I'm going to say this if you've got the
[31:47] true spirit of God
[31:49] if there's correction that comes
[31:53] that's where it stands if you could
[31:55] receive the correction you know you have
[31:57] the spirit of God Amen if you can't take
[32:00] the correction no matter how hard it
[32:03] cuts no matter how embarrassed it makes
[32:05] you if you take that correction
[32:08] oh my that's the difference between the
[32:12] serpent seed and the god seed the god
[32:14] seed can take the correction
[32:19] so how could I do it you say well what
[32:21] you hollering about I'm a witness
[32:23] against you he says
[32:25] someday in the day of judgment you'll
[32:28] have not a corner to go into you won't
[32:31] have a place to hide because I have not
[32:34] shunned to declare the whole gospel amen
[32:36] I have not shown to declare the whole
[32:39] truth before you I am not shown to
[32:42] declare the whole gospel right and I am
[32:45] not ashamed of the Gospel but I will
[32:46] speak boldly of the truth amen
[32:50] and when I speak that truth when whether
[32:53] you accept it or not if you don't accept
[32:55] it he says you won't have a corner on
[32:57] that Judgment Day to hide yourself in
[32:59] because you know that I told you the
[33:01] truth and it was up to you if you were
[33:03] going to obey that truth or not
[33:06] you won't be able to blame me on that
[33:08] day is what he's saying the only person
[33:10] that you have to blame is yourself now
[33:13] see we can't walk blaming others if we
[33:15] did the wrong we've got to fess up to
[33:17] what we did wrong amen you can't blame
[33:19] your wife you can't blame you children
[33:21] you can't blame your boss you can't
[33:23] blame your neighbor you know you did it
[33:25] so just man up or woman up and say that
[33:27] I did it and I was wrong and move on
[33:29] amen that's the whole thing about
[33:31] repentance
[33:34] but he goes on to say how could Micaiah
[33:36] stop that how can Moses screaming trying
[33:39] to stop it and we know Moses this
[33:41] morning we talked about how Moses got so
[33:43] angry
[33:45] when he spoke the truth but we know that
[33:47] it was God that hardened Pharaoh's Heart
[33:49] Right Moses couldn't stop it if he
[33:52] wanted to
[33:54] but how can Moses screaming trying to
[33:57] stop it and Joshua and them running
[33:58] among the people and Levi Levi he pulled
[34:02] a sword and slayed them even they went
[34:04] on just the same amen but it's predicted
[34:08] that they're going to do it and they're
[34:10] going to do it for it's thus saith the
[34:12] Lord they're going to do it you think
[34:13] them nominations he's talking about
[34:15] denominations will ever break up their
[34:17] denominations come back to the word it's
[34:19] not going to happen
[34:21] it's thus saith the Lord they won't
[34:24] will they go into the Antichrist exactly
[34:28] he says it's thus saith the Lord they
[34:30] will so what are you saying about I have
[34:32] to be a witness and so do you and he
[34:35] says all believers amen see the place
[34:39] that you got tonight that you're going
[34:40] to be a witness to stand against those
[34:42] that that defy the word of God Amen
[34:49] now see it's got to be the right kind of
[34:51] vessel
[34:53] in John chapter 15 and verse 1.
[35:00] he says I am the True Vine and my father
[35:03] is the husband
[35:05] in every branch in me that beareth not
[35:08] fruit he taketh away
[35:10] see if you're in him you've got to Bear
[35:12] the same fruit as he is
[35:15] and every branch that bearth fruit he
[35:17] purges it that it may bring forth more
[35:20] fruit
[35:22] now you are clean through the word which
[35:24] I have spoken unto you now I think I was
[35:27] reading that earlier and I didn't catch
[35:28] it I preached this at the home church
[35:30] and uh I was reading through that
[35:31] scripture and now you are clean through
[35:34] the word which I have spoken unto you I
[35:36] think that's going to be another message
[35:37] Brewing praise the Lord
[35:40] but now you are clean through the word
[35:42] which I have spoken unto you oh
[35:47] why didn't me and I and you as the
[35:49] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[35:51] accept it abide in the vine because
[35:54] that's where the life is
[35:57] no more can ye accept ye abide in me
[36:01] I am the vine and you are the branches
[36:03] he that abideth in me and I in him the
[36:06] same bringeth forth much fruit for
[36:09] without me
[36:11] you can do nothing
[36:14] if a man abide not in me he is cast
[36:17] forth as a branch and is withered and
[36:20] Men gather them and cast them into the
[36:22] fire and they are burned
[36:28] now we know that every seed shall bring
[36:30] forth of its own kind right
[36:32] so a maple tree is not going to bring
[36:35] forth a pine tree right
[36:38] now see you could be grafted in into the
[36:41] tree a branch could be grafted a a
[36:44] branch from One Tree let me specify that
[36:47] a branch from One Tree can be grafted
[36:49] into another tree okay
[36:52] you could be grafted and you could be
[36:54] supported by the life of the tree but if
[36:57] you are of a different branch of the
[36:58] tree you will bring forth your own fruit
[37:03] the same works that I do shall you do
[37:05] also right that's what Jesus said in
[37:08] John 14 12 the life is in the tree he
[37:12] said I am the vine and you are the
[37:13] branches without the vine there is no
[37:15] life so without the life you won't exist
[37:19] but you must be of the tree family
[37:23] you can't take a gorilla's arm and graft
[37:25] it into a tree I know that seems silly
[37:28] it seems Elementary but it has to be of
[37:30] the tree family
[37:36] you can't take something else and put it
[37:38] into another tree it's just not going to
[37:40] work
[37:46] see if it could be if
[37:49] if it could be a gorilla's arm it
[37:52] wouldn't be so close that it could
[37:53] deceive the very elect right because it
[37:55] would be so blatantly obvious that's
[37:57] that that's not part of a tree that's
[37:59] part of a gorilla
[38:01] you see what I'm saying it's going to be
[38:03] so close that it would deceive the elect
[38:04] if possible
[38:06] so just because the branches is grafted
[38:09] into a tree doesn't mean that it's going
[38:10] to Bear the same fruit that that tree is
[38:12] and that's how you're going to know
[38:14] we're Fruit inspectors right well what
[38:16] kind of spirit does this this person
[38:18] have well look at the fruit of his life
[38:21] that's going to tell you what kind of
[38:23] branch is grafted into a tree
[38:30] by their fruits that you should be known
[38:32] right
[38:34] so you might come to church and you
[38:35] might experience the moving of the Holy
[38:37] Ghost but if that Holy Ghost isn't
[38:39] anchored in your soul then it meant
[38:41] nothing
[38:43] you could almost get the same effect at
[38:45] a rock and roll concert right I gotta I
[38:47] gotta de-strangle myself here
[38:51] I feel like I'm being choked out
[38:54] amen you can get the same feeling in a
[38:57] rock and roll concert
[38:59] well what do you mean by that well
[39:01] brother Branham said he's seen which
[39:02] doctors and and these different uh
[39:05] people that weren't Christians speak in
[39:07] tongues so the so the spirit can can
[39:10] fall on a false vessel and you can feel
[39:12] the same feeling in a rock and roll
[39:13] concert it's the atmosphere that you're
[39:15] in you go to a tractor pull sometime you
[39:18] might not be into tractors or truck
[39:19] pools but if you just like that that
[39:21] Roar of the engine and just you know
[39:24] it'll stir up a man I don't know about a
[39:26] woman but usually it'll stir up the man
[39:28] whoa yeah oh I'm not even in the
[39:31] tractors yeah
[39:33] but you just get into the moment you get
[39:36] into the atmosphere and you and you do
[39:38] the Harare with everybody else that's
[39:41] screaming and shouting the same thing in
[39:43] in in in a worship service you see one
[39:46] person jumping and shouting what by
[39:49] golly I'm going to jump and Shout
[39:51] because I'm getting excited too
[39:54] you go to a rock and roll concert people
[39:56] are just jumping and thrashing I never
[39:58] got the headbanger thing but you know if
[40:00] I did that I'd get dizzy and pass out
[40:02] I don't know how they do it but they do
[40:04] it
[40:05] but they get they get an inspiration in
[40:08] there you get into that atmosphere
[40:09] you're gonna feel something it might not
[40:11] be something that you want to feel but
[40:12] you're going to feel something in there
[40:15] and it'll cause some people to just do
[40:17] some uh some weird stuff
[40:21] in a mosh pit what are you doing
[40:25] anybody know doesn't know what a mosh
[40:27] pit is they run into the crowd and
[40:29] they're they're expecting the crowd to
[40:30] to catch them and or they're just in the
[40:33] in the pit and they're just bouncing off
[40:34] of one another you know what kind of
[40:36] stuff is that it causes it causes you to
[40:38] do some weird stuff
[40:40] now see they think the same thing about
[40:42] us
[40:43] don't get that wrong they think that
[40:45] we're weird too so
[40:47] so you say you want to get in the
[40:49] presence of the Lord and do righteous
[40:51] things amen
[40:54] amen
[40:56] it said in the scripture that now we
[40:58] know that speaking in tongues is not the
[40:59] evidence of the Holy Ghost right that's
[41:01] just a fringe benefit that with that
[41:03] that's one of the gifts of the Spirit
[41:04] that we would get to do if we got in the
[41:07] presence of the Lord right so but we
[41:09] know that uh Paul said though I speak in
[41:11] tongues though I not don't have charity
[41:13] I could have uh I I could have all
[41:17] Revelation I could understand all these
[41:19] things all these Mysteries I could speak
[41:20] in tongues I could I could prophesy I
[41:22] could do all these spiritual things
[41:25] but if I don't have love
[41:27] it doesn't mean a thing so if God is not
[41:30] in it it's just movement
[41:33] it's just moving there's no action it's
[41:36] just movement you're just Treading Water
[41:38] that's all you're doing you're not
[41:39] swimming to the bank and then then you
[41:41] drown
[41:42] because you can only tread water so long
[41:46] take Peter for instance I didn't know
[41:47] that until this now but take Peter for
[41:49] instance he walked on the water for a
[41:51] moment and then he started drowning that
[41:52] Lord help me
[41:55] he can only do it for so long but
[41:58] without the master did Jesus say without
[42:00] me you could do nothing amen
[42:09] praise the Lord
[42:15] this is a quote from the another quote
[42:17] from the anointed ones at the end time
[42:19] he says
[42:21] why why can't he fly
[42:24] because look what he's been eating on
[42:26] he's been eating on Rotten
[42:28] denominational carry-on that means dead
[42:30] and decaying flesh
[42:33] that won't spiritualize his body
[42:36] it won't put him in spiritual Fitness in
[42:39] other words to to carry him up to the
[42:41] denominational or excuse me carry him up
[42:43] above the denominational differences see
[42:46] he's just fed on Rotten stuff
[42:48] that's not going to bring you a higher
[42:51] that's going to keep you down here it's
[42:54] going to keep your EarthBound
[42:57] excuse me
[42:59] see he's just fed on Rotten stuff his
[43:01] body is made out of that he can't go up
[43:04] there where that fresh meat carries that
[43:06] eagle he just can't do it now see we're
[43:10] talking about that everybody can't see
[43:11] what we see
[43:14] he says that fulfills Matthew 24 24
[43:18] false Christ and the prophets that their
[43:20] signs and wonders would deceit the very
[43:22] elective possible see he's flying
[43:24] jumping up in the air flopping his wings
[43:26] but he just can't get high enough
[43:29] it's movement
[43:31] but it's not attaining anything
[43:36] but he just can't get high enough see
[43:38] that's right see he can't go he can't
[43:40] reach high enough to get that fresh
[43:42] Manna he can't he can eat the old man
[43:45] that's down here on the ground the old
[43:47] Dead Rabbits has been run over a week
[43:49] ago and a month ago and 40 years ago
[43:52] contamination he can eat that and just
[43:55] glowed over it and squawk and holler and
[43:57] carry on jump jump up and fly like
[43:59] another Eagle see he's anointed like
[44:02] another bird
[44:05] another bird
[44:08] amen there's a difference and he is a
[44:11] type of an eagle but he's not an eagle
[44:13] he's a type of an eagle a buzzard is he
[44:17] says we know that he sure is but he
[44:19] can't follow the genuine Eagle see he
[44:22] just can't do it no sir his body isn't
[44:25] built he's been eating on different
[44:27] carry-ons see and it won't be the fresh
[44:29] meat the fresh Manna it'd be something
[44:31] that Luther said something that Wesley
[44:34] said something that Dr so and so said it
[44:36] won't be on what Jesus said for this
[44:39] hour
[44:41] I say it goes back to people once and
[44:44] these people once they want to look so
[44:46] spiritual and so much higher and more
[44:48] revelated than somebody else that they
[44:50] come out with something new it's wrong
[44:52] but it's something new
[44:56] right because they can't carry on with
[44:58] the truth or they willfully ignore the
[45:01] truth
[45:06] amen
[45:07] I see some people just can't see
[45:11] that's where we are to thank God that
[45:13] we're able to see and give God praise
[45:16] that we're able to see what we can see
[45:17] in this hour we were privileged people
[45:20] it's not that we were somebody great
[45:22] that he's oh brother Jesse's such a
[45:24] great guy I'll pick him and brother amen
[45:27] he's another great guy he's Above the
[45:29] Rest I will pick him it wasn't like that
[45:32] he's not a respecter of persons amen
[45:37] but it's whosoever will that will come
[45:40] unto him and whosoever will that will
[45:42] accept his truth it's whosoever will
[45:45] that will go when he calls upon them
[45:47] it's whosoever will that will move
[45:51] when he inspires
[45:53] amen
[45:55] if we don't go who will
[46:00] now see if we go to John chapter 9.
[46:04] and in the 28th verse brother can I get
[46:07] another water please
[46:13] it says then they reviled him and said
[46:16] Thou Art his disciple but we are Moses
[46:19] disciples
[46:21] but you know if you were Moses disciples
[46:23] you would recognize what Moses spoke of
[46:27] amen so verse 29 he says we know that
[46:31] God spake unto Moses as for this fellow
[46:33] we know not
[46:34] from whence he is talking about Jesus we
[46:38] know what Moses talked about but for
[46:39] this guy we don't know where he's from
[46:42] keep in mind they never met Moses either
[46:48] they didn't know who Moses what they
[46:50] knew of Moses
[46:52] so here they come talking about we knew
[46:54] Moses no you didn't but you didn't know
[46:56] Moses
[47:01] you know what Moses said that doesn't
[47:02] mean that you knew Moses
[47:05] for we know that God spake unto Moses if
[47:07] as for this fellow we know not from
[47:09] whence he is the man answered his son
[47:11] under them why herein is a marvelous
[47:14] thing that you know not from whence he
[47:16] is and yet he hath opened my eyes
[47:20] you can't see it but I know he opened my
[47:23] eyes I know where he came from
[47:25] amen
[47:26] the people that should have known who he
[47:29] was couldn't recognize him
[47:32] verse 31 now we know that God heareth
[47:35] not Sinners but if any man be a
[47:38] worshiper of God and doeth His will him
[47:42] he heareth
[47:44] since the world began was it not heard
[47:47] that any man opened the eyes of one that
[47:49] was born blind amen
[47:54] not once in the Old Testament did
[47:56] anybody ever hear of eyes being opened
[47:59] but now this man comes and opened my
[48:01] eyes and you say you don't know who he
[48:02] is or where he's from
[48:04] but only God you know that only God can
[48:06] open eyes so if only God can open eyes
[48:09] who is this vessel being used amen get
[48:12] you not seen who's in front of you amen
[48:16] I don't know where he came from but all
[48:19] I know is I once was blind but now I see
[48:22] try to take that from a blind man try to
[48:25] tell him that he didn't see anything
[48:27] real try to
[48:29] sister if you if you were born crippled
[48:31] your ankle you know you couldn't walk or
[48:33] anything if God healed your ankle
[48:36] instantaneously and you were able to
[48:38] rise up and walk and run do you think
[48:39] you'd be screaming and shouting and
[48:41] telling people that God healed you
[48:44] I would be you might be the bashful type
[48:47] foreign
[48:49] but I know I would be
[48:51] How could somebody ask a question from
[48:53] whence he is he just opened my eyes
[48:58] that's how I know where he came from
[49:01] I might not know the scripture like you
[49:03] know the scripture but I tell you one
[49:05] thing I don't really need to know the
[49:07] scripture for the presence that I was
[49:08] just in amen
[49:12] all I know is once I was blind but now I
[49:16] see hey amen
[49:19] Lord
[49:20] now he said if you was Moses disciples
[49:23] you would know me for Moses wrote of me
[49:25] the Lord your God shall raise up a
[49:27] prophet likened unto me amen they claim
[49:30] to be but they wasn't because
[49:32] that they were so steeped in Tradition
[49:35] see tradition
[49:37] is like handcuffs to a prisoner
[49:40] they can't go any further because
[49:42] they're bound
[49:44] they're Bound by tradition they can't go
[49:47] on any further they can't do anything
[49:49] else because that's all they knew is
[49:52] what somebody else had told them
[49:54] because they didn't have that experience
[49:56] that's why it's so important that you
[49:58] have your own experience with God that
[50:00] way when somebody says where is your god
[50:03] that you're waiting on that you keep
[50:04] telling me about well you just touched
[50:07] me this morning
[50:10] that's where he is you want to know
[50:11] where he is he's right here
[50:13] I came with me every day
[50:16] amen
[50:22] I don't know how and I don't need to
[50:24] know how all I know is they told me that
[50:27] I needed a hip replacement
[50:29] but by a prayer of faith I don't need a
[50:32] hip replacement
[50:34] that's how I know you try to tell me
[50:36] that there isn't a God in this day I
[50:39] know that there is a God that lives in
[50:40] this day
[50:41] amen because I've experienced it amen
[50:46] you can't tell somebody that God doesn't
[50:49] exist when somebody's done experience it
[50:53] just like these priests were trying to
[50:55] trying to swayed this guy
[50:58] he did who is this guy he didn't really
[51:00] he didn't really heal your eyes did he
[51:02] uh yeah because I was born I couldn't
[51:07] see but all of a sudden this morning I
[51:10] can see
[51:12] something had taken place it was more
[51:15] than just an inspiration I felt the
[51:17] inspiration in there but something came
[51:19] alive Within Me amen
[51:22] something was manifest it wasn't
[51:24] something just sitting there idle a good
[51:26] word a little plaque that we oh I like
[51:27] that little motto right there I want to
[51:30] look at that every day it's more than
[51:31] just a motto it's more than just a
[51:33] philosophy it's a way of life amen and
[51:36] it's truth that we live by amen
[51:38] [Applause]
[51:40] see the fall rains on the just in the
[51:42] unjust the spirit can fall on anyone but
[51:45] a true vessel would be sealed with it
[51:46] amen gifts and callings are without
[51:48] repentance and there's the difference
[51:50] some will just be moved where others
[51:52] others will be put into action amen they
[51:55] will go on to Acts 2 38 and they will go
[51:58] on to Perfection they will put on all
[52:00] righteousness meekness kindness and
[52:02] humility there will be a change and
[52:04] there must be a change that takes place
[52:06] then when the time comes they will go on
[52:08] to a body change
[52:10] praise be to God isn't that what we're
[52:13] looking for we're looking for a body
[52:15] change amen
[52:18] and remember what you are here is what
[52:21] you are there see you're just in a
[52:23] little practice time here because you're
[52:25] practicing here to become something of
[52:27] what you're going to be there
[52:31] there's no changing when you get to the
[52:33] other side the change it takes place
[52:35] right here it's different if you've
[52:37] never heard anything about the word
[52:39] but you'll be held accountable for what
[52:41] you do with what you do know with much
[52:44] knowledge comes much responsibility
[52:46] [Music]
[52:47] so when you hear the word and you don't
[52:49] perform it there's no Corner that you
[52:51] can run and hide to because the truth
[52:53] has been declared to you it's up to you
[52:55] if you accept that truth and go on to
[52:57] Perfection or if you stay idle and just
[53:00] sit in a cesspool of death amen
[53:04] you want to be happy sitting in a
[53:05] cesspool I urge you to go to a frog pond
[53:08] where there's just all this algae and
[53:10] all that to see if you want to swim in
[53:12] something like that there's a cesspool
[53:13] for you
[53:15] go to go to a Hog's wallow see if you
[53:17] want to roll on that for a little bit
[53:20] amen I want to move on with life where
[53:23] the where the water is pure as could be
[53:26] amen amen I want the the Living Water
[53:29] amen I don't want some some dead wiggle
[53:32] tails in my water I want pure water amen
[53:36] praise be to God
[53:41] you know when people just kind of
[53:43] talking about about your ankle here
[53:45] you know when people were healed in the
[53:47] in the New Testament when they came in
[53:48] contact with Jesus they couldn't help
[53:50] but say something even when he gave
[53:52] Specific Instructions to say
[53:54] he might have said go show the priest
[53:57] what's happened here today other times
[53:59] he said see that you tell no man about
[54:01] it
[54:03] so do you think that man that was born
[54:05] blind open his eyes open you think he
[54:07] was keeping quiet you think that man at
[54:10] the gate when he rose up when when they
[54:12] said Silver and Gold Have I None but
[54:14] such as I have I give unto thee and he
[54:17] was healed and he rose up and he ran the
[54:19] first time I ever ran you ever see a
[54:21] baby try to walk on their first day
[54:24] it's not going to happen so how does a
[54:25] man that's never walked before how does
[54:27] he instantly walk
[54:29] all right
[54:30] there's a time
[54:32] if anybody's ever had surgery on a on a
[54:36] limb if you've ever broken anything it
[54:38] takes time to heal so when you during
[54:41] that time of healing it just sits there
[54:43] and it does it does nothing except to
[54:45] heal
[54:46] you can't see the healing process but
[54:48] it's a process
[54:50] so all that time that you can't use it
[54:52] because what they tell you is you go
[54:53] home and you rest and don't use it uh
[54:56] just just rest
[54:58] that's all they tell you to do
[55:00] that's all you're supposed to do because
[55:02] if you start doing all kinds of things
[55:04] if you broke a leg if you start walking
[55:05] on it you're going to break it again and
[55:06] then it's not going to heal right so
[55:08] rest is something that that's needed
[55:11] right
[55:12] so what happens after about six to eight
[55:14] weeks 10 12 weeks of not using something
[55:20] yeah I broke my wrist when I was 14. had
[55:23] surgery on I had a pin put in it
[55:26] got out of the cast you think I can move
[55:29] that thing like like this one nope
[55:33] couldn't do it it takes time and it
[55:36] takes exercise it takes Physical Therapy
[55:39] it takes you moving it and getting used
[55:41] to moving it again so how does this guy
[55:43] that never walked before how was he able
[55:45] to walk as soon as he was healed I don't
[55:48] know because I I think we would have to
[55:50] practice walking first right so there's
[55:53] another miracle not just that he was
[55:54] healed but he was able to walk
[55:57] amen just a little side thing there for
[56:00] you so
[56:01] amen
[56:03] but you know when Jesus told some people
[56:05] to be quiet
[56:07] I don't think they could be quiet I
[56:09] couldn't keep quiet that's just because
[56:11] I'm loud anyway but take somebody who's
[56:13] quiet take Emma for instance she's quiet
[56:15] she's bashful she doesn't say much
[56:18] she'd probably be running screaming if
[56:20] you had a broken leg or something and
[56:22] you were healed instantly I'm sure you'd
[56:24] be telling somebody about it wouldn't
[56:25] you I know I would
[56:28] you'd have a hard time keeping me quiet
[56:30] you know they tried to silence uh
[56:33] who was a Poland Silas they were trying
[56:35] to don't you dare speak in the name and
[56:37] don't you speak Jesus name again they
[56:39] put him in prison right do I have the
[56:41] right people Paul and silence
[56:44] don't don't speak in the name of Jesus
[56:45] anymore and we'll let you go free isn't
[56:47] that how some some people are you know
[56:49] I'm in the Civil Air Patrol I'm a uh uh
[56:52] a character development instructor you
[56:54] know what they told me when I first
[56:55] joined on to that there was a a chaplain
[56:59] that was he had to do a phone interview
[57:01] with me before I could do this uh
[57:03] character development stuff it's a
[57:07] what he told me was uh if you if you
[57:10] pray for somebody you can't pray in the
[57:12] name of Jesus well that's the only way I
[57:14] know how to pray and that's the only way
[57:16] I'm going to pray I don't care what you
[57:18] tell me kick me out I'm going to pray in
[57:20] the name of Jesus why because that's a
[57:23] scripture that I believe
[57:25] it's okay to hold other people down or
[57:28] the Christian's down but you can't hold
[57:30] other people down
[57:31] all the other religions could do what
[57:33] they want to do but don't pray in the
[57:36] name of Jesus see they want to restrict
[57:38] Christians
[57:41] oh why because the devil wants to
[57:44] restrict Christians because he knows the
[57:46] power of Prayer
[57:48] amen amen
[57:52] now see putting into action we need to
[57:54] be we need to be put into action not
[57:57] just moved not just hearing the word and
[57:59] thinking oh that just sounds wonderful
[58:00] and then go back to watching Disney
[58:02] movies the Frozen right we don't want to
[58:04] be frozen but we want to be on fire
[58:07] right we want to overcome that Frozen
[58:10] condition amen we don't want to be
[58:12] stiff-necked uncircumcised Christians
[58:14] amen but I want to be full of the fire
[58:16] of the Holy Ghost amen Ava praise be to
[58:20] God Glory now Jesus told this Parable
[58:23] that this is a a certain man with two
[58:25] sons
[58:26] Matthew 21 and verse 28 he says
[58:30] but what thinky a certain man had two
[58:33] sons and he came to the first and said
[58:35] Son go work today in my Vineyard he
[58:38] answered and said I will not
[58:42] but afterward he repented and went
[58:44] and he came to the second and said
[58:46] likewise and he answered and said I go
[58:49] sir
[58:50] and went not
[58:53] whether of them Twain did the will of
[58:56] his father and they say unto him the
[58:58] first Jesus said saith unto them verily
[59:01] I say unto you that the publicans and
[59:04] the harlots go into the kingdom of God
[59:06] before you
[59:09] the ones that are supposed to be the
[59:11] elect but now I have chosen publicans
[59:14] and harlots the lowest of the low to go
[59:18] into the Kingdom of Heaven before you
[59:21] amen
[59:23] excuse me kingdom of God I don't see
[59:25] much separation there
[59:29] for John came unto you in the way of
[59:31] righteousness and you believed him not
[59:33] but the publicans of the harlots
[59:35] believed him
[59:37] see God is not a respecter of persons I
[59:39] know you keep hearing me say that but
[59:41] that's so important through the New
[59:43] Testament
[59:44] he didn't pick just a hierarchy but he
[59:46] picked the lowest of the low
[59:49] why because they gave him honor they
[59:52] believed him they took him at his word
[59:53] amen
[59:55] besides that what else did they have to
[59:57] lose they were already low
[1:00:00] how much lower could they go
[1:00:03] amen
[1:00:06] but the publicans and the harlots
[1:00:08] believed him and ye when ye had seen it
[1:00:10] repented not afterward
[1:00:13] that you might believe him oh my
[1:00:17] God that shows what Spirit they were of
[1:00:18] right
[1:00:20] whoo
[1:00:21] oh my
[1:00:23] that could get a little thick in some
[1:00:24] atmosphere in some congregations
[1:00:27] but there have been several moments take
[1:00:30] place in the last decade excuse me
[1:00:32] movements did I say moments I meant
[1:00:33] movements there have been several
[1:00:35] movements take place in the last decade
[1:00:37] you've got defund the police
[1:00:40] you've got the me too movement you've
[1:00:42] got BLM
[1:00:44] you've got the pro-choice movement you
[1:00:46] got all these movements out here but
[1:00:49] what are they accomplishing
[1:00:55] if you look at it
[1:00:57] you don't you ever hear the saying
[1:00:59] follow the money
[1:01:00] that's a true statement you you look at
[1:01:03] these charitable these charity
[1:01:05] organizations I I can't remember what
[1:01:07] was that uh United Way I think that
[1:01:09] might have been it's I could be wrong so
[1:01:11] don't hold me to that so if I'm wrong
[1:01:13] don't hold anything against United Way
[1:01:15] if I'm wrong I can't remember which one
[1:01:16] but there are a lot of Charities several
[1:01:19] Charities out there that oh give to the
[1:01:21] poor you send us some money we'll we'll
[1:01:23] distribute it to the poor you know how
[1:01:24] much goes to the poor about five percent
[1:01:27] or less
[1:01:29] or less sometimes none at all
[1:01:33] but the CEOs of these charity
[1:01:36] organizations
[1:01:38] makes millions
[1:01:40] a year
[1:01:41] a year
[1:01:44] so where is all that charitable uh money
[1:01:48] going to it's not going to the ones that
[1:01:51] you thought it was going to go to the
[1:01:52] ones that you had a good heart to give
[1:01:54] to oh this organization is going to take
[1:01:56] care of these people
[1:01:58] they're not
[1:02:01] they are corrupt
[1:02:04] they are corrupt I don't understand
[1:02:06] these movements I I I get what they're
[1:02:09] trying to do but I really don't
[1:02:10] understand it's usually a self-serving
[1:02:13] motive
[1:02:15] that's usually what's behind these kind
[1:02:17] of movements it's because somebody got
[1:02:19] got inspired well we're going to go out
[1:02:21] and make a difference
[1:02:23] to what your opinion
[1:02:27] a lot of several of these movements they
[1:02:29] completely disregard facts
[1:02:31] I said well I don't think that's right
[1:02:33] well whether you think it's right or not
[1:02:35] it's it's what is you got to look at the
[1:02:38] facts of the thing you can't just make
[1:02:40] up make stuff up just to tailor to your
[1:02:42] movement
[1:02:44] right it doesn't work that way when you
[1:02:47] see a movement going in that direction
[1:02:49] you know it's a false movement
[1:02:51] pay no attention to that thing
[1:02:54] because usually the money is going to go
[1:02:55] to somewhere else other than what you
[1:02:57] attended intended it for
[1:03:03] all right
[1:03:13] I was going to say something but I can't
[1:03:14] remember oh yeah that's what I was going
[1:03:16] to say
[1:03:18] you get these people that say well I see
[1:03:21] an injustice so I somebody ought to do
[1:03:24] something about it
[1:03:26] why not you
[1:03:28] you see the Injustice you're crying out
[1:03:30] the Injustice usually it's a lot of ones
[1:03:32] that are screaming out against an
[1:03:34] injustice that sit on the bench and do
[1:03:36] nothing
[1:03:37] all they did is just like the the Jews
[1:03:41] that moved the people to choose Barabbas
[1:03:43] over Jesus it Rouses the people to such
[1:03:46] anger to see their that that one
[1:03:48] person's Viewpoint and they
[1:03:51] they do themselves a disservice because
[1:03:53] they don't go back and and research
[1:03:55] something they just take the the one
[1:03:57] Prince yeah that sounds right that
[1:03:59] sounds right that sounds right
[1:04:03] but it's wrong
[1:04:06] and then they go under a false pretense
[1:04:08] okay you get these rich people these
[1:04:10] millionaires that are complaining about
[1:04:11] injustices of of certain groups
[1:04:15] okay if you feel that strongly about the
[1:04:18] Injustice why aren't you broke
[1:04:24] why aren't these rich people broke
[1:04:25] because if they believed in it that much
[1:04:28] they would spend every dime to see that
[1:04:30] their purpose and their cause was
[1:04:32] carried out
[1:04:33] they would be broke they would be
[1:04:35] shoulder to shoulder against the other
[1:04:36] poor people
[1:04:40] it's just
[1:04:41] gain saying
[1:04:44] it's just smooth talking
[1:04:47] stirring up the people for self-serving
[1:04:50] motive
[1:04:53] amen that's the truth
[1:04:55] not just because I said it look at it
[1:04:58] research it
[1:04:59] look at these people like I said it's
[1:05:01] usually the loudest ones that's crying
[1:05:03] out that do nothing
[1:05:05] they expect other people to do the
[1:05:07] sacrifice why because they don't want to
[1:05:09] lose their status in case if they get
[1:05:11] into something a little sticky situation
[1:05:13] even when people they try to do good
[1:05:15] people try to hold them to something
[1:05:17] they try to find dirt they try to
[1:05:19] criticize something they try to find
[1:05:21] something negative about it to tear it
[1:05:23] down
[1:05:24] right
[1:05:25] absolutely the truth
[1:05:31] wow
[1:05:40] but the problem lies where people can
[1:05:42] get so moved and inspired but they just
[1:05:44] can't get over to be quickened just like
[1:05:47] the parable of the thorny and Stony and
[1:05:49] the good ground they can only go so far
[1:05:52] with God why because there's only one
[1:05:54] good ground
[1:05:56] if it's of the Stony ground it can't be
[1:05:58] of the good ground if it's a thorny
[1:06:00] ground it can't be of the good ground
[1:06:05] but we ought not to be so prideful and
[1:06:07] say well I'm of the good ground I'm of
[1:06:11] the good you know it's not something
[1:06:12] like that
[1:06:14] we are privileged people
[1:06:17] amen
[1:06:20] without Christ we can do nothing right
[1:06:24] they could be right there at the
[1:06:26] threshold and then just give up just
[1:06:28] like the Rich Young Ruler see he came
[1:06:31] and he knew the scripture
[1:06:33] when Jesus said what is the greatest
[1:06:35] Commandment that you should love the
[1:06:37] Lord God with all thy heart with all thy
[1:06:39] mind and with all thy soul
[1:06:41] and he says you know you're not far from
[1:06:43] the truth but there is one thing
[1:06:46] one thing if you know that there was one
[1:06:50] thing keeping you from Heaven what would
[1:06:52] you do
[1:06:54] we would take care of that one thing so
[1:06:57] that one thing doesn't matter anymore
[1:06:59] right we would put that one thing behind
[1:07:01] us
[1:07:02] and take a step forward to life that we
[1:07:05] would be quickened amen see some people
[1:07:07] just get to that threshold and then
[1:07:09] think times get a little bit tough they
[1:07:11] could almost make it they could almost
[1:07:15] and they just give up and they're just
[1:07:17] right there at the threshold if they
[1:07:19] would have just taken one step further
[1:07:21] they would have overcome the situation
[1:07:23] one step further
[1:07:26] that's why I say hold on a little bit
[1:07:29] longer hold on don't give up but hold on
[1:07:34] cleave unto that which is good amen we
[1:07:36] talked about this morning about
[1:07:37] Cleveland you know I think it was in the
[1:07:39] Old Testament where the warrior was he
[1:07:41] was fighting so many people and he
[1:07:42] couldn't take that sword out of his hand
[1:07:44] and because why his hand cleaved to that
[1:07:47] sword he couldn't let go he couldn't
[1:07:49] even pry his fingers off of it he was
[1:07:51] holding on so much
[1:07:53] because it was a habitual thing that he
[1:07:56] made it a habitual life right there he
[1:07:59] clung onto it he wasn't letting go
[1:08:01] this is the truth I'm going to hold on
[1:08:03] to this every day of my life amen
[1:08:06] this is what's going to get me through
[1:08:08] amen
[1:08:10] hold on just a little bit longer amen
[1:08:15] and what happens with that it's usually
[1:08:17] frustration despair sorrow somebody
[1:08:20] might say a negative three it might be
[1:08:22] something critical that somebody said
[1:08:23] which if you just let that roll off like
[1:08:25] water off a duck's back see sometimes we
[1:08:28] just take things too personal
[1:08:30] we might take it too personal
[1:08:32] yep I'm guilty of that sometimes you
[1:08:35] know it might not even be meant toward
[1:08:37] me but you know sometimes I I just take
[1:08:39] some things personal you know
[1:08:41] and uh so that I get I get a little
[1:08:43] discouraged here and there because I my
[1:08:46] wife lets me know about it so well you
[1:08:48] don't have to take it personal while
[1:08:49] you're right but I just this isn't right
[1:08:52] you're not even involved
[1:08:58] but it's the principle honey it's the
[1:09:00] principle
[1:09:01] [Laughter]
[1:09:03] see we justify our we justify ourselves
[1:09:05] to stay in something that we don't
[1:09:07] belong in yeah
[1:09:12] excuse me
[1:09:15] but James 1 and 12.
[1:09:17] it says blessed is the man that endureth
[1:09:19] Temptation blessed is the man that holds
[1:09:22] on through the Temptation blessed is the
[1:09:24] man that that overcomes the temptation
[1:09:28] for when he has tried he shall receive
[1:09:30] the Crown of Life which the Lord hath
[1:09:34] promised to them that love him
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:41] we got to stop waiting for somebody to
[1:09:43] make a decision for us amen stop waiting
[1:09:45] for somebody to step in for you
[1:09:48] but take the action and be filled with
[1:09:50] the Holy Spirit
[1:09:52] you don't have to ask your parents for
[1:09:54] permission to get get the Holy Spirit
[1:09:56] you don't have to ask the brother
[1:09:58] Jesse's permission to read the word of
[1:10:00] God you don't have to ask us permission
[1:10:02] can I come to the altar to to get prayed
[1:10:05] for can I come to the altar to to
[1:10:07] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:09] you don't have to ask these things
[1:10:12] you don't have to ask your parents you
[1:10:13] don't have to ask your wife you don't
[1:10:15] have to ask your husband
[1:10:17] you know when I was before I get in my
[1:10:18] heart I think I gave my testimony here a
[1:10:20] little bit yes
[1:10:21] and and I felt the pull of God and I
[1:10:24] said something to my wife do you have to
[1:10:25] be a member of the church to go up and
[1:10:27] and get prayed for it and now you don't
[1:10:30] have to be a member of the church go and
[1:10:31] get prayed for you don't have to ask
[1:10:34] permission it's because I didn't know I
[1:10:36] didn't know the ways the the way that I
[1:10:38] was still new to it I didn't know the
[1:10:40] ways of of how the church uh
[1:10:43] had their order you know I didn't want
[1:10:46] to overstep my bounds because you you
[1:10:48] can only do certain things in a
[1:10:50] denomination if you're not a member
[1:10:52] you're not invited to do certain things
[1:10:54] is that right
[1:10:56] but you have to be a member
[1:11:00] how do we become a member of of this
[1:11:02] church I don't know how you have it
[1:11:03] nearby laws but
[1:11:05] you know I know in our bylaws we don't
[1:11:08] have any membership dues we don't have
[1:11:10] uh any Apostles Creed that you have to
[1:11:13] recite you don't have to you don't have
[1:11:15] to be able to recite the Lord's Prayer
[1:11:17] you don't have to do this you don't have
[1:11:19] to do that you don't have to go in pairs
[1:11:21] knocking on people's door you know uh
[1:11:24] and and talking about a prophet that
[1:11:26] that's a welcome thing if you're talking
[1:11:28] about the truth
[1:11:29] I'm talking Jehovah's Witness
[1:11:32] sorry I shouldn't have said it but but
[1:11:35] you don't have to jump through hoops for
[1:11:36] an organization you don't have to jump
[1:11:39] through hoops here to become a member
[1:11:40] right you can just come and you support
[1:11:42] the church you come and you say I want
[1:11:44] to be a member
[1:11:45] right who who are we to keep somebody
[1:11:47] away from from the work of God if if I
[1:11:50] know my brother uh as well as I think I
[1:11:53] do he'd say come
[1:11:56] come
[1:11:58] I don't care what you had in your life I
[1:12:00] don't care if you just robbed a bank
[1:12:01] just confess it and give the money back
[1:12:04] right
[1:12:07] you see what I'm saying so
[1:12:11] I might have said this here before I
[1:12:13] can't remember but if there was if there
[1:12:15] was a sinner
[1:12:16] that just walked through the door and
[1:12:18] said hey I hear you're having church
[1:12:20] here tonight
[1:12:22] who would be the and everybody else who
[1:12:24] hears as is is baptized and filled with
[1:12:27] the Holy Ghost and and uh you know
[1:12:30] you're just there and you're full of God
[1:12:32] who do you think would be the most
[1:12:34] important person in that room
[1:12:38] I would say the sinner right because we
[1:12:40] already know where we're going
[1:12:42] we have that blessed hope we have that
[1:12:45] assurance that person doesn't have that
[1:12:47] same hope so that's where we should turn
[1:12:49] our attention to right
[1:12:52] is to show love show forth the gospel
[1:12:55] amen
[1:13:03] I'm going to close here
[1:13:07] or start closing
[1:13:14] sometimes closing is a process right
[1:13:16] [Laughter]
[1:13:22] some people he's closing okay
[1:13:25] ready to go is he done yet other people
[1:13:28] what
[1:13:30] I miss brother Jose I remember when
[1:13:33] David preached here the one time he said
[1:13:35] well that's all I have what that's it
[1:13:38] but I'm still hungry
[1:13:41] I will never forget that that was so
[1:13:43] funny but you know that is so true the
[1:13:46] bride the bride of Christ will always
[1:13:48] hunger for the word of God Amen so I
[1:13:52] just love that I just love that amen
[1:13:54] that showed me where where brother
[1:13:56] Jose's desire was
[1:13:58] he wanted more of God
[1:14:02] but you know a a born-again Believer
[1:14:05] will not worship anything other than God
[1:14:07] right
[1:14:09] so in Hebrews 13 and 9.
[1:14:12] so if we won't worship any other God
[1:14:16] we will we will hold true to right
[1:14:19] Doctrine correct
[1:14:21] because going off on different Doctrine
[1:14:23] tends to lead you to adultery
[1:14:25] it'll lead you to something else other
[1:14:28] than God
[1:14:30] it says be not carried about with divers
[1:14:33] and strange doctrines for it is a good
[1:14:35] thing that the heart be established with
[1:14:39] Grace
[1:14:40] not with knowledge not with revelation
[1:14:43] not with I'm the best prayer here
[1:14:46] amongst us
[1:14:47] well you're probably the most prideful
[1:14:49] amongst us too so what kind of award
[1:14:52] would you like uh say it's not a
[1:14:54] competition amongst Believers right
[1:14:57] but the heart be established with Grace
[1:15:00] not with Meats which have not profited
[1:15:02] them that have been occupied therein
[1:15:07] see it it might seem like a good idea it
[1:15:10] might give you the wow factor at that
[1:15:13] moment but if you go back and look at
[1:15:14] the thing just like the movements if you
[1:15:16] go back and look at the thing research
[1:15:18] it a little bit and find out the motive
[1:15:20] and the objective of it
[1:15:22] it'll show what it is
[1:15:30] I see I don't I can't remember if I said
[1:15:33] this here before or not so forgive me if
[1:15:35] I did uh if you like it you like it if
[1:15:37] if not I guess you'll just have to deal
[1:15:39] with it
[1:15:40] uh
[1:15:42] the image that that King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:15:45] uh had set up was not of King
[1:15:46] Nebuchadnezzar now I'm kind of reaching
[1:15:48] out on this one I don't know what
[1:15:50] brother Jesse's taught on this one but
[1:15:52] I'm just this is this is the way I see
[1:15:54] it okay so bear with me for a minute if
[1:15:58] if I'm wrong I'll accept correction
[1:16:01] but just bear with me okay so the image
[1:16:05] that Nebuchadnezzar had set up was not
[1:16:07] of King Nebuchadnezzar as some would
[1:16:09] lead you to believe uh out in the world
[1:16:12] that they want to say that oh that image
[1:16:14] was of King Nebuchadnezzar no it was not
[1:16:16] of King Nebuchadnezzar it was of Daniel
[1:16:21] what do you mean it was of Daniel
[1:16:23] give me a second
[1:16:25] see you in uh in Daniel you have
[1:16:28] belshazzar
[1:16:30] and you have baltus shazar it's a two
[1:16:32] little two-letter difference between the
[1:16:35] two names one belshazzar I I don't know
[1:16:38] the pronunciation so uh forgive me
[1:16:41] belshazzar was the son of King
[1:16:44] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:16:46] and Belta shazar was another name for
[1:16:49] Daniel
[1:16:50] so and Shadrach and meshech Shadrach
[1:16:53] Meshach and Abednego would not worship
[1:16:55] Daniel
[1:16:56] now see
[1:16:58] I'll get into that I don't want to get
[1:17:00] ahead of myself they wouldn't worship
[1:17:02] Daniel why because Daniel was their
[1:17:05] brother right
[1:17:06] the same as we should not worship
[1:17:08] brother Branham for he is our brother
[1:17:11] see if the devil cannot deceive you then
[1:17:14] he will push you overboard with truth
[1:17:16] see Nebuchadnezzar's son was two letters
[1:17:19] off from what he called Daniel he called
[1:17:22] Daniel Belta shazar hang on a second
[1:17:26] let's turn to it
[1:17:27] let's turn to Daniel there's there's a
[1:17:30] couple uh because if I say something
[1:17:32] that
[1:17:33] going out that far I want to have backup
[1:17:35] for it
[1:17:38] uh we'll read Daniel 1 and 7.
[1:17:45] we're not brother Brandon talked about
[1:17:49] this about how the image was Daniel
[1:17:53] I thought to myself
[1:17:55] okay brother Branham is a word Prophet
[1:17:58] if he's going to say something
[1:18:00] outlandish like that
[1:18:02] that is not a blatant statement in the
[1:18:05] Bible
[1:18:06] where did he get it from it has to be in
[1:18:09] there somewhere and I must have read the
[1:18:10] book of Daniel
[1:18:12] four or five times
[1:18:14] over and over talk about getting you to
[1:18:16] read the word
[1:18:18] so and I I got to pray and I said Lord I
[1:18:21] know it's got to be in here somewhere
[1:18:23] if you would just show it to me so
[1:18:26] these are the different areas so bear
[1:18:28] with me and I'll show you Daniel 1 and
[1:18:31] 7. unto whom the prince of the eunuchs
[1:18:33] gave names for he gave unto Daniel the
[1:18:36] name of Belta shazar
[1:18:40] into hananiah
[1:18:42] Shadrach
[1:18:44] and to Michelle
[1:18:45] I don't know how you said Michelle
[1:18:49] it's kind of like Michael
[1:18:51] of Meshach and Azariah of Abednego now
[1:18:56] see these names that were given
[1:18:58] all right now say I'm getting ahead of
[1:18:59] myself I guess I might as well just say
[1:19:01] it so I can spit it out
[1:19:04] these names that were given
[1:19:07] unto
[1:19:08] Daniel and the the other Brethren there
[1:19:12] the names that they were given were the
[1:19:13] names of Babylonian deity
[1:19:17] do you think that they welcomed these
[1:19:19] names
[1:19:20] I don't think so at all
[1:19:22] but that's what they were given and
[1:19:25] that's what they had to live with
[1:19:29] so knowing that let's go to uh Daniel 4
[1:19:34] 8.
[1:19:44] Daniel 4 8 it says but at the last
[1:19:47] Daniel came in before me whose name was
[1:19:50] beltashazar
[1:19:52] according to the name
[1:19:55] of my God
[1:20:00] is right there
[1:20:02] but at the last Daniel came in before me
[1:20:04] whose name was beltashazar according to
[1:20:06] the name of my God and in whom is the
[1:20:10] spirit of the Holy gods and before him I
[1:20:13] told the dream saying oh Bel to shazar
[1:20:15] Master Of The Magicians because I know
[1:20:18] that the spirit of the Holy Gods is in
[1:20:20] thee and no secret trouble at thee tell
[1:20:23] me the visions of my dream that I have
[1:20:25] seen and the interpretation thereof see
[1:20:28] Nebuchadnezzar thought so highly of
[1:20:30] Daniel because of what Daniel could do
[1:20:32] but he didn't recognize the rightful
[1:20:34] place that Daniel had and the rightful
[1:20:36] place that God had so he and and as a uh
[1:20:40] what's the word that I'm looking for as
[1:20:43] a heathen he didn't know any better
[1:20:44] because he was a worshiper of other gods
[1:20:47] so he didn't recognize the one in the
[1:20:49] true God he didn't recognize the highest
[1:20:51] deity
[1:20:55] but he had the utmost respect for Daniel
[1:20:57] and I believe that's why he rose up the
[1:20:59] image of Daniel
[1:21:00] that's why he made the image of Daniel
[1:21:04] but see uh Belta shazar it means the
[1:21:08] lord of the straightens treasure
[1:21:13] and what is Lord
[1:21:15] the one that's in control right
[1:21:19] foreign
[1:21:23] Nebuchadnezzar's son
[1:21:24] it means Bell protect the king
[1:21:28] Belle
[1:21:31] is a chief Babylonian deity
[1:21:36] now see even though Nebuchadnezzar named
[1:21:39] Daniel after uh the the name of a
[1:21:43] Babylonian deity and and his Brethren
[1:21:46] along with him Babylon Babylonian
[1:21:48] deities
[1:21:50] see where they hold their place is that
[1:21:52] Nebuchadnezzar had raised up Daniel he
[1:21:55] lifted him up so much that he wanted
[1:21:56] other people to worship Him
[1:22:01] but Shadrach Meshach and Abednego would
[1:22:05] absolutely not do it
[1:22:07] and neither should we
[1:22:09] amen
[1:22:16] see he worshiped Daniel
[1:22:19] so he would deceive the very elect if
[1:22:21] possible see it's not always in the
[1:22:24] works of what a person could do that we
[1:22:26] worship the person that does the works
[1:22:28] it's not the works it's the it's the the
[1:22:31] person behind that works it's the it's
[1:22:34] the the being that that cut that made
[1:22:37] those Works come to pass amen
[1:22:39] amen
[1:22:43] now see
[1:22:45] you ever notice how people get upset
[1:22:47] when you don't worship what they what
[1:22:49] they want you to to worship see
[1:22:51] Nebuchadnezzar and his people were were
[1:22:52] killing people because they would not
[1:22:54] worship the image that he had raised up
[1:22:57] and he even threatened Shadrach mesack
[1:23:00] in a bed to go he threatened them with
[1:23:02] the furnace uh because they would not
[1:23:04] worship uh the image he said well we're
[1:23:07] going to put you in the furnace we're
[1:23:09] going to make it seven times hotter
[1:23:11] to the point where even the guards lost
[1:23:14] their lives taking these men to the
[1:23:16] furnace Why didn't it take their lives
[1:23:19] because we know that there was a higher
[1:23:22] power amongst them that because they
[1:23:24] honored God he also honored them and
[1:23:26] they were a witness against the people
[1:23:28] in that day
[1:23:30] amen
[1:23:32] now see in the New Testament the
[1:23:34] silversmiths got upset because the
[1:23:36] disciples were drawing people away from
[1:23:38] the idols right the silversmiths were
[1:23:40] mad because people weren't worshiping
[1:23:41] the Goddess Diana anymore
[1:23:44] I'll see I kind of attribute that to the
[1:23:46] the age of pornography that we live in
[1:23:48] right now if if if if the the righteous
[1:23:52] people were to stand up and cry out
[1:23:53] against pornography if they weren't
[1:23:55] involved with it uh if if they stood up
[1:23:57] and cried out against the the
[1:23:59] pornography industry
[1:24:01] they would be upset because you're
[1:24:03] taking money away from them see that's a
[1:24:06] whole thing right there that's a whole
[1:24:07] Drive behind that because it's a
[1:24:09] lucrative business
[1:24:10] it's a very lucrative business
[1:24:13] and if you start trying to take money
[1:24:14] away from it yeah they're going to get
[1:24:16] upset and they're going to want to try
[1:24:17] to take you out
[1:24:18] that's just the way it is people in all
[1:24:21] through history they try to Snuff out
[1:24:23] the truth and the messengers of Truth
[1:24:25] they've done it all through history
[1:24:28] starting with Cain and Abel
[1:24:31] and it's not finished yet
[1:24:37] see they were losing money so they got
[1:24:40] upset
[1:24:43] it probably would have tried to kill
[1:24:44] Paul and his companions and if and you
[1:24:47] had the same thing today they want to
[1:24:48] come against Christians because
[1:24:49] Christians stand against these wicked
[1:24:52] things so they want to they want to
[1:24:54] silence the Christians amen
[1:24:58] I'm gonna go ahead and close if you want
[1:25:00] to stay to your feet brother amen if you
[1:25:02] would come
[1:25:07] brother Fang you can come too
[1:25:08] [Laughter]
[1:25:13] but there is no God like our God right
[1:25:15] there is none like him
[1:25:19] even though people Through the Ages have
[1:25:21] tried to raise up images and to raise
[1:25:24] them or try to proclaim a deity as equal
[1:25:26] with him there is none equal with him
[1:25:30] so and this is one of my favorites I've
[1:25:33] been on this kick for a little bit I
[1:25:35] don't know why but this was uh I really
[1:25:37] like this story
[1:25:39] because it just shows the authority of
[1:25:41] God Amen
[1:25:43] first Samuel chapter 5 and verse 1 it
[1:25:46] says and the Philistines took the the
[1:25:48] Ark of God and brought it from uh
[1:25:50] brought it from Ebenezer onto ashdod
[1:25:53] when the Philistines took the Ark of God
[1:25:55] they brought it into the house of Dagon
[1:25:57] and said it by Dagon and when they have
[1:26:00] asked Dr Rose early on the morrow behold
[1:26:02] Dagon was Fallen upon his face to the
[1:26:05] Earth before the Ark of the Lord and
[1:26:07] they took Dagon and said in his place
[1:26:09] again see light can't have fellowship
[1:26:12] with Darkness
[1:26:14] righteousness can't have fellowship with
[1:26:17] unrighteousness
[1:26:19] and when they arose early on tomorrow
[1:26:20] morning behold Dagon was Fallen upon his
[1:26:22] face to the ground before the Ark of the
[1:26:24] Lord
[1:26:25] and the head of Dagon and both the palms
[1:26:27] of his hands were cut off upon the
[1:26:29] threshold only the stump of Dagon was
[1:26:32] left to him
[1:26:36] so who is the higher power
[1:26:38] many people have tried to challenge God
[1:26:41] and his servants and many people have
[1:26:43] died trying
[1:26:45] amen
[1:26:47] that's our god let's look to the Lord in
[1:26:49] prayer
[1:26:53] most gracious Heavenly Father
[1:26:55] Lord we just want to give you honor we
[1:26:57] want to give you praise because of who
[1:27:00] you are and that there is none like you
[1:27:01] and you are above all you were God above
[1:27:03] all gods You Were King above all Kings

[1:27:10] unto respect of who you are and we want
[1:27:13] to give you honor and we want to give

[1:27:32] the message of this hour Lord though we
[1:27:35] might not understand everything Lord I'm
[1:27:36] still learning being far from me that I
[1:27:39] would even dare to say that I understand
[1:27:40] everything being far from me that I

[1:27:55] relationship built stronger between you
[1:27:58] and I and I ask the same for my brothers
[1:27:59] and sisters that we would just seclude
[1:28:01] ourselves uh from the things of the
[1:28:03] world and just find that prayer closet
[1:28:06] more more often than what we ever have
[1:28:08] that we would open our Bibles more than
[1:28:10] what we ever have oh God so father we
[1:28:13] just pray that you would just uh
[1:28:15] just be with us not that we would just
[1:28:18] be be moved or just have a a a a a a
[1:28:21] moment of inspiration but may we take
[1:28:24] that movement that moving in our hearts
[1:28:26] may we take that inspiration from our
[1:28:28] hearts and may we put it into action to
[1:28:30] share with others and to show others the
[1:28:32] real truth may we take that inspiration
[1:28:34] and that that that that that that that
[1:28:36] movement and just put it in our hearts
[1:28:38] that we would live that truth that we
[1:28:40] would live that inspiration that people
[1:28:42] would say that there is a true God that
[1:28:45] people would say that people would know
[1:28:47] that there is a real God amongst us that
[1:28:50] the Lord put the Silence of those that
[1:28:52] are questioning where is thy God that
[1:28:54] you say that is coming soon where is he

[1:30:00] true to his God lord may we have that
[1:30:03] witness may we have that testimony that
[1:30:05] he lived truth that he the whatever he
[1:30:08] spoke he lived may people see that and
[1:30:10] may they be convicted so much in their
[1:30:12] hearts maybe our lives be so salty that
[1:30:15] we would make others thirst around us oh
[1:30:17] God that we would be that that thirsting
[1:30:20] that Oasis that they could come and
