TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thank you jesus amen let's stand and take our bibles here tonight by god's grace let's go to first john chapter four i received a little bit of inspiration from work this week so i'm gonna take a break from the doctrine of devils series i'm going to preach a little message called just a simple message perfect love casts out fear praise god preach that tonight by god's grace i tell austin i got some interesting uh i got an interesting article i'm going to read later from the education world so uh yeah every now and then god gives me little nuggets you know i sure appreciate those so first john chapter 4 verse 17 first john 4 17. there's nothing like praising the lord is there nothing like that worship in the lord as you worship him he anoints you then in his presence his presence comes upon you in his presence his fullness of joy praise god what a blessing hallelujah and then the joy of the lord is our strength oh what a what what a formula that is praise god amen what a what a progression of revelation that is thank you jesus first john 4 17. so let's read uh verse 17 and 18 together a little bit of not too much but that's a little bit of reading for us 17 and 18. let's begin on three uh we'll start with here and is our love one two three herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world verse 18 let's read that on three one two three there is no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love amen i'm going to read verse 19 also we love him because he first loved us aren't you glad god loves you tonight yes for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son herein is the love of god commended that god sent his son to die for us praise god god proved his love to us by sending jesus christ and now the spirit of jesus christ is here praise god let's have one more word of prayer heavenly father we've read your word we've sang your songs we've been anointed by the holy spirit to worship you tonight god to give you thanks to give you praise to bless your holy name we'll never regret that lord god in fact we'll rejoice in that lord god every moment we have a chance to give you praise and give you honor lord take control of this service now lord god as i preach anoint me anoint your people bless us in your divine presence god so we'll be rejoicing happy with victory ahead lord as we leave this service give us strength and victory tonight vision and instruction in revelation in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as being seated praise god perfect love casts out all fear what a promise i want to just uh meditate on this scripture again just for a minute you can switch over hon uh and i was now i thought of a new scripture i want to uh look to you real quick here just came to my mind okay so here's our text here tonight uh i'm pulling as i was thinking about this little study i got from work i started pulling i'm gonna post from a few sermons i've preached in the past and kind of put them together and combine them with this thought here i think it'd be a help to you i think it'd be a blessing i was kind of blown away uh when i was we had a little uh professional development on monday we didn't have kids so we went to uh went to some meetings with all the teachers and they put this paper in my front of my face and i'm like oh my goodness uh so we'll get to this in a little bit just something simple but just the the hour that we're living in is very complex it's a very challenging hour to live in but we know saints down through the ages have gone through uh major persecution right major trials and each time they overcome by the blood of jesus christ and by the word of their testimony praise god and so i just want to just pull this just simple thought out here about love the bible says love is made perfect so we have boldness in the day of judgment in other words as you as you mature as a christian you should grow in your confidence toward god and that god loves you so that on the day of judgment you're not worried if he's going to be displeased with me or if he's going to send me to hell or something like that you'll have boldness and you'll know that the love of god was perfected in your heart in other words god was able to teach you his love throughout your life praise god and you can look back after even last year or the year before and say my look what god has brought us through praise god tremendous temptations and and fears of 2020 right and fears of 2021 and here we are in 2022 you know fears that we never knew were even possible some of these pestilences and things you know but as we go along now look we're still standing many have fallen many have died because of the flu-like symptoms or the flu-lac symptoms of coven you know with pre-existing conditions many have died but it's about the same number as flu it's just an event it's just another form of the flu it kind of but you know we had to live through these fears and we can see now we're standing here we're stronger on this side we've got more confidence in god god's kept us amen god's never left us praise god he's never forsaken us hallelujah he's never uh never gotten rid of us praise god he's never cast us to the side we're still standing here declaring his name amen we're still blessing his name tonight amen where the devil would like to steal your praises or the devil would like to make you to discouragement or depression or or leave the church or something but here you stand as a child of god in the house of god giving praise to almighty god showing him that that you trust him no matter the situation amen hallelujah and you will trust him through anything that he and his wisdom allows to come to pass hallelujah because it's love love you learn to love more it's made perfect it's made complete so as a christian you grow in love for god and for others and remember that's the proof you are a christian jesus said if you love my disciples or if you love one another then you are my disciples indeed so see can't you see how we love each other you know we're trying to help one another out and be a blessing to one another we're growing in the love of god hallelujah and so that makes us bold that we know if we should die or if we should go to the grave it makes us bold to know that god's love has been perfected in me i've seen god's love grow in my life and i know that when when these eyes close for the final time there'll be angels there to pack me to my savior amen because to be absent from the body is to be present with the lord amen because as he is so are we in this world praise god in other words with the love of god amen as he has the love of god as he has as he is love of god here we are anointed with his spirit praise god and we stand the bible says as his representatives amen we're representatives of his love of his power amen of his grace of his mercy we represent him and we share the love of god with this world and then the bible says there's no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear so i want to just remind you church that that that fear is powerful satan there's the bible says there's a spirit of fear many will go to hell because of fear but we must remember there's one greater than fear that can cast fear out amen there's one that can just imagine there's one that can pick up fear you know if i was a strong man i'd pick this up and i could i could cast this out you know think about that i'm stronger than this or whatever it would be you're stronger the love of god in you is stronger than any fear devil can bring upon you amen it can cast out you can say you're not welcome here amen the love of god will say you're not welcome here you must leave here i'm throwing you out praise god it's got that authority the love of god has that power amen and it drives out it forces out fear it casts out fear because fear torments you and god the word says god does not want us tormented amen torment is is pain and suffering god wants us free from pain and suffering free from worry free from anxiety god wants us free in the name of jesus amen because anyone that lives in fear is not being complete in love right they're they're losing their faith they're losing uh they're trusting god they're losing their confidence in god but those who accept the love of god are made complete in god's love and then they show love to the world amen hallelujah why we love god because he first loved me hallelujah he knew where we'd be and i'll say like this he knew where to find you praise god he knew where to find you to show and prove his love to you praise god amen now i want to go back up here for a moment and look at a few scriptures it's been a few years since i preached this but let's look briefly at the uh the effects of fear remember i preached this in 2017 i thought my i was going through this today i thought i'd like to show this here real quick and then i want to get to this article church the effects of fear are disastrous to anyone fear will literally destroy a person spiritually and physically right now look at a few scriptures fear proves you don't believe okay that's what deuteronomy 1 32 says fear proves you don't believe but now let me balance this out here we'll get to that in just a moment uh second timothy i'm sorry second corinthians 7 5. i'm just gonna you know i'm gonna jump to that so you guys can see it i wanted to get this up there because i want to show the balance here as well by god's grace so let me look this up i want to present this for you second corinthians 7 5. there it is okay now i want you to see this here by god's grace and i'll try to magnify that like we did a few weeks ago appreciate everybody's patience with me there we go now this is written by the apostle paul and he said for when we were coming to macedonia our flesh had no rest but we were troubled on every side without we're fighting so that so paul's like in a war atmosphere right there's fightings outside and yet within there were what fears so here again we have this great illustration of how inside a believer you're battling fear you're battling sin and temptation and pride all these fears you're battling depression or or sickness all these things you're battling inside but yet at the same time you can be conquering amen because it's a battle there's a battle inside of you and so the holy spirit is calling us to fight the battle praise god just because we have fear doesn't mean we don't believe it just means we're in a battle to believe praise god it means that you're going to overcome but you've got to defeat the enemy standing before you praise god paul said there's fightings without i see men fighting and whether it's you know spiritual fightings in churches or or whether wars or people fighting with swords or he saw fightings outside but inside he saw fears cropping up i wonder what this one's going to say i wonder what that one's going to say i wonder what's going to happen next i wonder what's going to i wonder what next week holds i wonder next year holds see it was within but i love this nevertheless what does god do he gives you comfort when you're cast down amen in this case he sent a man named titus in other words that's just the man i needed to see and that man lifted me out of my fears hallelujah church called you the same thing for you tonight praise god maybe if you haven't yet but you're gonna probably shake somebody's hand tonight and it's gonna the love of god on them is gonna stir you up and raise you up out of any unbelief praise god amen hallelujah one man came to paul and paul said i'm comforted i'm not worried about the fear anymore i'm not worried about the fights i'm not worried about the troubles anymore because god sent a man to comfort me amen and if nobody else let me be the man to comfort you that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen he loves you he died for you he knew this hour would come praise god he knew everything about your life from beginning to end and he's here to comfort you he's here to bring you peace and refreshment amen but what does satan want to do he wants to torment us all the questions all the uncertainty all the fears he tries to bring them on us okay so i just want to share that there so you can see that we're all going to have fear but worshiping fear or being given over to fear proves a person doesn't believe remember this one fear keeps people out of their inheritance the ten spies came back and said there's no way we can go into the promised land the giants are way too big there's no way we can do what god said we could do now church that's what we got to tell the devil tonight tell the devil no i can do what god told me i can do if god gave me a promise if god gave me a spiritual blessing that spiritual blessing is mine because god said a-l-l spiritual blessings are mine amen now the time in season is the only thing that's in the question praise god is it the time and season for that but if you don't know seek god to know praise god but i can tell you if you're in a battle god wants you to win that battle god wants you to overcome that battle praise god god wants you to possess all these given to you amen now church fear is selfish let me go let's read that one judges 7 3. i don't quite remember that one i'd like to read that one some of these i remember joshua judges so sixth book of the bible oh that's right yeah i think this was uh gideon yeah now therefore go to proclaiming the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and afraid yeah let them return and depart early from mount gilead and their return to the people 20 and thousand and there remained ten thousand so gideon's army was at twenty two thousand but he said if anybody's afraid let him go home and now they went down they lost twelve thousand went down to ten thousand it was selfish what about israel why not fight for israel our countries uh we we've been slaves to these many nights they were selfish they thought about themselves more than uh the lies and their children and their women they thought about that more than they thought about the victory it was selfish praise god the church let's not let's not be like them let's be believers that stand there in the face of adversity and said i'm not leaving the battle praise god you can't talk me out of it you can't buy me out of it you can't beg me out of it i'm here to fight i'm here i'm a real believer praise god this is the hour victory praise god this is the hour of deliverance i'm on the lord's side amen hallelujah that's what i was born for amen i was born to be a christian i was born to overcome i was born to fight the lord's battles amen hallelujah i will not be selfish but i'll fight for the future of this church hallelujah i'll fight for the future of my family i'll fight for i'm not gonna back up and say it's impossible uh there's no way are the giant the obstacle's too hard no i'm gonna fight i'm gonna press through i'm gonna stay even if they the devil gives me open door i'm not gonna walk through the door to leave i'm gonna press on i'm gonna keep fighting because i'm one of god's amen see of course look satan's always gonna offer you here's the easy way out anybody want to go or just slip it right here tonight just slip away here tomorrow just go do this or that you can get rid of all this you can get rid of all your troubles you get rid of all this fear no sir in fact i'm gonna i'm gonna open the door jesus said i'm the door amen i'm gonna walk through the door that jesus opens praise god not the enemy i'm going to walk in faith into what god is doing in my life i see god raising up an army church do you see it praise god you see god raising up an army in akron ohio amen slowly but surely god is raising up an army amen we're the ones that got to fight we're the ones that got to overcome we're the ones that have to be concerned about others and not so much ourselves but be concerned and fight for others because this is the hour of victory hallelujah amen and then fear makes someone else useless in god's army see when we live by fear it makes us useless in other words fear is a paralyzing thing it makes you do nothing that's what i was trying to encourage our brothers uh last week or last sunday when i was preaching you're going to get criticized either way jesus never hid what he was preaching he preached it publicly he knew he was going to get criticized he knew he was going to be crucified but he knew to stand and declare the truth was the will of god for his life amen so he's willing to put up with the criticism he's willing to put up with all the adversity in order to please the father he said i always do that which pleases the father amen hallelujah how many want to be effective in the army of god you want to know your orders from you're the general jesus christ amen and you want to pack them out praise god but see we see them in that scripture selfish people become useless and leave the battle right and then fear brings on what we fear right we saw that with peter peter feared the waves so it brought on his sinking we saw with job job said i feared all this i fear losing my family i fear losing my money and that's what happened to him praise god now church any any person like you or i we we would have natural fears well what if this happens what if i lose my job what if i lose my house what if i lose my vehicle we have all these natural fears what if i get cancer all these natural things but we can either feed that fear or we can cast out that fear that's what we got to do praise god we got to trust in the lord amen we got to drive that out praise god we got to get our eyes off the situation and the bible says look up to heaven amen the bible says look unto the author and finisher of our faith amen hallelujah what we fear will come upon us but also what we believe will come upon us amen hallelujah if you believe god will give you the victory you'll get the victory praise god amen now fear allows sin to spread in the church that's titus 1 9. let's read that in first corinthians 5 6 titus 1 9. right after the timothy books titus 1 9. verse 9 holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and convince the gangsters huh that doesn't sound exactly right maybe it's two nine maybe i type that in there wrong no not two nine well i apologize for that i must have wrote the wrong scripture in there but i know first corinthians 5 6 for sure let's go to first corinthians 5 6 i don't know why i had that in there pardon me first corinthians 5 6. of course this was about the man who was a really immoral man he was a brother he'd been baptized but he was uh sleeping with his stepmother inside the church and the church was not mourning this they were not sorry about it there was a really wicked sin and a disease spiritual disease that entered the church verse six your glory is not good know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump okay so in other words this shows any sin right that's allowed to be in the church it spreads like fire right it spreads right through amen so any sin will spread through so the opposite is true faith will spread like fire too amen because the holy ghost is fire amen holy fire amen faith spreads too so the holy spirit has to put out the unbelief amen and then that spreads and then we the bible says we'll encourage one another we uh the bible says we uh we go from faith to faith from glory to glory praise god the bible said every joint of the body supplies what the other joint needs amen in other words your the body of believers are going to pro supply what we have need of amen just like uh titus did to paul there titus did to paul now we've been over this one a lot but fear fed that little racism that peter battled there that was in galatians 2 12. let's read that see you'll see and you'll see then again or just revisiting that church problems many times start because of fear pride fear the bible says you can't have contention without pride so in this case peter was uh prideful that oh the jews are better than the gentiles so he wouldn't even eat with them galatians 2 12. but a part of this was fear verse 12 for before that certain came from james he did eat with the gentiles but when they were come he withdrew and separated himself what fearing them which were of the circumcision so fear this is the same man that had the keys to the kingdom but he let fear about what preachers would say about him keep him from honoring all the people in the church fear did that a man that saw jesus christ after now look at this church a man that saw jesus christ after he was resurrected you would think if i saw the living christ how could i ever battle again but it shows we're still living in this old past house amen we're still gonna have to battle you you can see how many visions did he see amen he saw a mountain transfiguration he saw these dead people raised he saw the woman raised the baby so the young girl raised from the jet darius jairus daughter he walked on water how many miracles do you think would be enough to overcome fear none because god wants you to overcome amen he's not going to give you a magic pill to make you overcome he wants you to choose and and fight and stand there and say i'm going to live for god i'm going to overcome this so see we can't live by experience so much we got to live by faith in the word amen even seeing jesus resurrected wasn't enough for him to not fear the preachers see because god's going to let you he's going to teach you he wants you to learn to love him and the church said he wants you to grow in perfect love to the to the lord hallelujah see fear fed that racism in that church and fear ultimately if it's surrendered to if it's worshiped if it's loved will destroy a soul revelation 21 8 and notice it's the first one because fear and unbelief go together because that because israel feared the ten spies fear the giants they didn't believe so fear and unbelief go together verse eight but the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death think and you've heard this before but think of all the people that are now afraid to go to church because of fear of covet or omicron or whatever right they're probably going to release another one whatever i mean who knows right what are we going to do just live in fear no and if they've left the house of god and they they choose to live in fear rather than worshiping it's possible they can lose their faith the fearful and unbelieving will not inherit the kingdom of god amen so it's a good reminder for us all we all need to grow in love and whenever giant or whatever obstacles before us let's take it down let's cast it down let's overcome amen hallelujah now i'm not going to go here so now i'm going to read this article okay so i know you've been waiting this whole time for the article so uh just a a nice little article here i'll get to this just a moment okay so they laid this down in front of me and i'm like oh my goodness i gotta preach this believe it or not it's from 2017. this is five years ago this is called the five brain disorders that were born out of the digital age this was five years ago in other words there's five spiritual disorders that have come upon people just because of all the screens okay now there's just five i'm just going to go through them briefly the first one is called nomophobia and you can look it up in the dictionary we did we looked up in the dictionary on monday at work nomophobia and this means this is this is shortened for no mobile phobia or i don't have my cell phone fear or i don't have internet fear i've never left their cell phone somewhere they're like my whole life is over or you're in remember the power went out last year at our house what am i gonna do without the internet this is the actual fear it's been uh demonstrated in these studies it's a feeling of panic upon being separated from your phone or tablet 70 73 percent of englanders felt panic when they misplaced their phone another 14 spiraled into pure desperation and this was back in 2012 church this is 10 years ago now people in the uk which we know there's not many believers in the uk right so how do you feel when you don't have your phone you let that spirit of fear come over you oh oh my all my information my whole life all my pictures on there my kids all my pictures out there it's a real thing they've studied it now they say at this point it's it's hard to tell whether this is good or bad for our long-term health well i got news for you it's bad for your long-term health i don't have to be a studier i don't have to be a doctor to know that anytime you're afraid that your life's gonna end you go into a panic just because you lost one man-made device you've got problems and your problems are bigger than a missing a phone your problems are spiritual problems you're trusting in a device your hope and your joy all your love and all your love is in all those things just think about this church what if people their house burnt down and they lost all their pictures they lost i mean could you even go on without that of course you can go on without that but some some people play so much on i mean i know there's family memorabilia or whatever they call it i know those things can be important but in all reality you're still alive you still have life yourself a chance to start over and make new memories amen you still got hope that if your loved ones have passed on although you lost their picture if they're so saved you'll hug their neck one more time you'll hug their neck on the other side amen so what big deal is that if you lose your phone or lose your tablet it's a spirit that gets on people a spirit of fear now it's been a while since i lost my phone so i'm not condemning anybody uh brother austin we went through that on my brother austin misplaced his phone on monday and i'm not preaching on him i'm the this is what i got on monday so i was gonna preach to everybody i've lost my phone though before i lose my keys so much i got to put one of those reminders on there to help me find it where's that where's that i got to find that i just misplace it sometimes but it's the fear that comes upon us that we got to overcome these are all new uh disorders or spiritual conditions that come upon people because they don't have faith in the word of god so nomophobia no more phone phobia my whole life i don't have my phone and they panic now we laugh but for some people it's a reality because they worship that phone they worship their tablet they worship that they got to have that in their hands more than their hands prayed up to god in the bible praise god put more confidence in a phone than the living god amen that phone can fail you that phone can break and fall but god's word can never break amen god's word can never fall to the ground heaven earth shall pass away cell phones will pass away cell phone towers will fall but god's word will never pass away amen number two is technofurance techno friends in 2014 over 50 percent of the people studied said that their phones interrupted their leisure time their conversations and their meals with significant others and this led to the name technofurance so in other words interference from technology now all these alerts on our phone are correlated with lower relationship and life satisfaction discontentment all these notifications interrupting our time with our loved ones interrupting church that's why we should turn off our phones during church i got to keep mine on in case i get a text or sometimes i use it to put up here but you don't see me texting like hey take a selfie of me look i'm in the house of god guys just ridiculous ridiculous i mean some people do that but that's ridiculous but it the the cell phone interrupts our family time and it ruins our family time and ruins some of our relationships a disorder and the church said it's a disorder and it was in 2014 so that was eight years ago what is it now it's even worse their relationships suffer because of frequent interruptions that's why when my wife and i go on our day i try to put my phone down face down and i have the notifications off and that's why i'll just make up i'll be proactive i'll send malachi text or lydia how's it going and i just set it down you know because i can sit there and worry the whole two hours like oh is my children okay i could be so worried in other words be enslaved to fear and then if if i constantly look at those i got an email i got an important question i mean you got to shut off at some time church you can't be a slave to that thing you got to shut it off at some time and the church said if you die those those red circles are going to keep coming up praise god they're they're never going to quit they're going to get spam texts and spam emails all these things you cannot live by that you must live by faith you must live by the holy spirit you must trust god and love god amen and don't let a phone or tablet ruin your relationships and get a disorder and be dissatisfied with life because you don't you need quiet time to make connections with people praise god that's the second disorder nomophobia technoference the third one this is kind of funny it's called the phantom ring so when they study people the phantom ring uh two-thirds of people wherever they kept their phone they'll just feel like it's buzzing and they'll go to check it and it didn't have a buzz it's a phantom ring and it causes stress constantly all the time and they live under pressure so that buzzing or ringing or whatever your favorite ringtone is instead of a help it becomes a hurt instead of a blessing it becomes a curse because now and i've done that before too i felt like my phone's going off i felt like my legs vibrating so i'll go and check it i feel kind of ashamed of myself now not lately but this is actually a disorder the study says people will be sitting there and they'll interrupt them and they'll go to check and there's nothing there so all they can figure out is that uh that any little movement of the clothes now sends a message to the skin and and makes you think that any little movement any little rubbing now imitates that and makes you makes you react to it but actually it's a spirit of stress and anxiety oh i'm feeling oh somebody's calling me somebody's calling me in other words like all this pressure's on me all this pressure i got to get back to these people i gotta get back to people now church let me tell you and naomi knows this and my wife if you don't get back to me no problem at all all you need is a cell phone for maybe five minutes and start texting people and you're gonna learn people aren't gonna get back to you when you wanna get back to them or when you want them to get back to you just be happy you got friends praise god there's so much pressure we put on ourselves and it becomes anxiety like like naomi will sometimes apologize if she didn't if she waits a day to text me back i mean sister there's no reason to apologize i know you're you're just so kind and loving you don't have to apologize for that sometimes i don't text people back for weeks i'm like oh yeah i'm sorry brother yes right yeah raising a family you know feeding family and we you know but this is a disorder people have right oh all the time gotta have it see church i'd say like this if we would worship god love god more we'd feel the holy spirit on us amen amen it wouldn't be a phantom ring but we feel the presence of god amen we start crying or shouting or raising our hands or we feel his presence that's what we want to feel the prince of god not the presence of a cell phone the prince of the holy one praise god amen that's what we need to feel hallelujah now here's one that kind of goes with it number number four cyber chondria cyberchondria you've probably heard of hypochondria right hypochondra is people who diagnose their own illnesses i'm sorry uh yeah cyberchondra is people who diagnose their own illnesses online one in three americans back in 2017 say they've used the internet to self-diagnose they say for people who already battle hypochondria this can be detrimental they get neurotic they go down a google wormhole frantically reading about every dreaded disease that matches their symptoms and the church said a certain for example a search for abdominal pain brings up diagnosis that include everything from food poisoning to stomach cancer and soon the googler is convinced they're dying this is a real disease it's a mental spiritual it's a it's anointing of fear see the devil whispers oh see ah it's more than just a stomach ache you got cancer always assume the worst no it's okay that's what the devil does right we laugh at it because we've experienced that i mean we've all had those i've had those questions too i'm not sleeping i've had a headache for two weeks i wonder if i got cancer i got the problem of not sleeping enough that's my problem i need to sleep in that's or go to bed earlier that's the problem and every time i sleep in i feel better now before i think it was actually drinking too much coffee that's what i think it was before yeah my wife says amen but see i could have went down and said oh i must have a brain tumor i have i've had a headache for two weeks oh here i am five years later i'm fine i'm healthy i got all kinds of energy praise god but we could follow the fear of the devil and he could talk us into having something cybercon cyberchondria this is a huge problem because online symptom checkers are wrought with inconsistencies and inaccuracies online not everything's true online does everybody know that more than half the time the top diagnosis is matching the symptoms search will be wrong one study found that's just one study half of the searches are totally wrong to begin with they give you the wrong answers it doesn't match your situation now they say for a number of reasons doctors aren't too happy about self-diagnosis trend they say they say it's a loss of their control but also it undermines their authority they say but the main problem they say is it messes with a diagnostic process because the results can suggest rare or morbid conditions to patients which in turn can prompt the appearance of new symptoms in other words when they start reading this other ones oh i didn't know now i got this too well i had cancer but now i also got tuberculosis and i also got emphysema i mean all these things yes sister um when i was pregnant i was looking at stuff yeah a lot and in the beginning and it made me so worried i started crying and then remember i told you i gave it to god yeah i stopped and i stopped running to the hospital every time i didn't feel removed and so i just kind of put my trust in god because i was looking up so freaking out calling doctor amen let's thank the lord for that praise god gave me the victory amen amen that's what that's what we got see god brings us that point we've all done that sister to some degree or another right we've all gone online or or searched out something i must have this i must have that and must have that but then we get to the spot we have a choice are we either going to accept fear or accept faith and faith accepted faith amen i didn't know you praise god faith accepted faith and we can all come to that point praise god so see then satan likes to give you oh you actually have this too you didn't know this but you also have this too you also have this infection you have this problem you have all these things you know what we ought to tell satan we ought to get out god's book we'll say i'm going to search god's book and i'm going to go to psalm 103 i am the lord thy god that heals all thy diseases you're telling me all these symptoms but my book the real doctor he told me god heals all my diseases amen he told me to cast out anything that exalts itself against the word of god amen cast out all symptoms amen and take care of them if you can take care of them do your part take care of them like that brother from uh iowa i think i told you this brother austin his name was rich and he actually came back to the church he left the church but he came back god gave him a great victory he was drinking so much diet coke i think i told you this he couldn't walk up the stairs to work and he would go up for prayer and nothing would happen well one day a friend of his on the job wasn't even a christian said you're probably drinking too much diet coke well he stopped drinking diet coke within a week he was able to walk the stairs he's fine now he just don't drink diet coke but he could have said oh i've got arthritis oh and then the devil said oh now i got cancer i'm dying i got muscular dystrophy i mean all these things alzheimer's got all of them could have came in there and the whole time it was just lack of tempers amen a lack of self-control to not be addicted to man-made sugars and all these things see instead of worrying we should take it to the lord and ask god god help me lord you show me now there's times we go to the doctor but there's other times we can't get there let's go to the mighty doctor amen the eternal doctor the holy doctor amen dr jesus glory see all these fears and there's one more there's one more i think maybe the one that maybe fight would fight me the most is the no mobile phobia you know like i'm just if i'm not connected i'm going to miss out on something but i'm growing in that i'm growing that i'm grown it's never been a big problem it's never been disordered but that would be the one that i think affects me the most when i'm sick i don't go to the internet i go to my wife honey can you get me some garlic or something like that what do you what do you what can you do for me bless her soul amen best or so when but when the god gives you wife the bible says you get favor from the lord god gave me favor but he gave me my life amen i got great favor amen fifth and final one is the truman show delusion so i actually saw this movie before i was a christian in 1998 do you remember the truman show jim carrey realized he was being watched by all the like but by big brother and he realized his whole life was a tv set he was being watched by the government um now this though it's a false perception that your life is being broadcast to everyone this this is a disorder it's not a new diagnosis but it's a fresh twist on on uh on uh grand it's called a grandiose illusion okay and today it's a product and the digital age is a product of overly connected being overly connected to people right it's through reality tv based obsessions social media driven lifestyles and narcissistic qualities so self-worship right so the more people are tuned into their phones the more social media the more they're connected to people they're actually over see and that's where problems always happen on social media on phones people overstep their boundaries because because they let other people into their lives too much like they complain about their husband complain about their wife complain about their kids they're letting too much people in the bible says hide people's faults amen don't post it online hide that praise god pray for them amen but see because of this people get too connected and people start giving you advice or something like that but i mean that's fine but you shouldn't put it out on public and the real vice should come from the bible praise god amen what is today's fuel now this is interesting too i didn't know this but this is a education document written by a phd in the 1940s the japanese controlled american minds with radio waves i didn't know that in the 1950s soviets accomplished this with satellites they were controlling the people's minds through satellites in the 1970s the cim planted computer chips into people's brains to run tests to control them what's today's delusion fuel take your pick of the kardashian sisters and then compound it with a dose of the latest nsa revelations and all the reality shows the resulting delusions aren't real but they're they certainly aren't random see because it says you live off a uh you live off a snippet of the kardashians live off a snippet of the nightly news a snippet off of this and you get a false sense of reality so you have this false perception that your life everyone's caring about your life everyone's looking at your life everybody's watching you and that takes away your joy that takes away your peace because you know everyone i got to make sure i look good my whole life what are people going to think it doesn't matter what people think it matters what god thinks praise god five disorders i thought it was interesting some of them were related to fear and i thought my if that if this was 2017 if there was five in 2017 where are we at today there's probably 15 or 20 disorders all because of people feeding on the phone more than they're feeding on the word of god amen let me try to bring this down here now i'm going to skip past this here so our earthly work abounds when we have no fear of death in other words you'll be the the best servant of christ when you don't fear dying because paul said o death where's your sting oh grave where's your victory what is death it's just an open door to the prince of god amen like that song says if you get there before i do coming forward to carry me home amen tell them i'm coming home soon amen hallelujah praise god amen this thing of death is sin the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore because because you're not afraid of death anymore brethren be steadfast in other words keep moving put keep putting the same effort into the gospel you've always put into it be unmovable don't let anybody shake or move you off your face and always abound that means increase in the wheat in the work of the lord so for me that's more preaching for me that's more studying that's more song leading although it's awful sometimes forgive me uh for me that's more youtube videos more podcasts it's more time in the word of god amen hallelujah and for you it's you abounding in your ministries god has given you give yourself more don't fear death hallelujah just abound more pour yourself more into the work of god because you know jesus says conquer death amen and brethren said death was the greatest fear that christians had or believers had but jesus took away that fear because he said i have the keys of death amen hallelujah jesus controls death hallelujah in other words jesus knows when you're going to go and you can if you can trust anybody with death you can trust jesus christ hallelujah amen what hosea said i will ransom them i'll buy them back from the power of the grave i will redeem them from death o death i will be your plague amen jesus is going to destroy death amen see we get all afraid of what that's going to do to us don't fear death jesus is going to take care of death amen oh grave jesus will be your destruction amen hallelujah repentance shall be hid from mine eyes now we're not going to read this tonight but remember i want to preach on david church david overcame all this fear of a 10-foot man the closest we have is austin are you 6-3 austin or six three he's the closer we have the ten foot man right that's gotta be what nine or maybe nine and a half okay remember can't preach on david guys remember that everybody remember benjamin set up there on the bench remember that and one of you standing before a 10-foot man of course you be fear you know this guy wants to kill you you know he wants to battle you know he's got a big sword his sword's probably bigger than you but how did david overcome fear he had revelation in other words god showed him he was going to win the battle god showed him what to do in church that's what we got to wait for we got to pray until god shows us what to do like brother also i'm going to tell this testimony real quick austin had a uh migraine all day sunday right i didn't know it but after service i got there and he had his head down at the table he said man i got this my gran i got some migraine well i just kind of stood there i didn't know what to do i'm just like well i want to pray for this you know brother amen coming out where other people were talking i was like i'm not sure how this is going to work i just kind of wait on the lord all of a sudden jose said i'm going to leave and i just remembered how jose was giving testimonies about people being healed i said wait brother jose i said wait can you lay hands on austin can you pray for him brother jose laid his hands on him he said a real prayer didn't he a real prayer he had the headache migraine all tomorrow morning right all the way up till service was over like at one or twelve thirty or one or something we laid hands he said a real prayer he rebuked satan i didn't hear you praise god amen he says he said you're healed the name of jesus he leaves i started massaging his back and i started giving awesome good massage there i get a lot of good practice you know at home i start massaging his head and brother what was it within 10 minutes it was totally gone he had it all day but i had to wait i had to wait for a revelation in other words like how do we do this and in church i just felt like it just come down from heaven have jose pray i say jose let's pray that's how it was i was just standing there i was going i knew what we wanted to pray for every single god i'm not sure how that's going to happen and all of a sudden the inspiration struck get jose hallelujah and he has the rest of the day no more migraines and the church said amen i thank the lord amen a revelation in other words this is how it's going to be done in other words god show david go get the five stones you're going to use your sling and defy him in the name of the lord and you're going to take him down with that sling he knew it he saw it he had to ignore all his family and church critics his brothers tried to stop him the soldiers tried to stop him he had to go overcome fear he had to even go past what his brother said about it and he had to recall god already gave me victory i already defeated a lion i already defeated a bear this is how he overcome fear the church said get a revelation from god right ignore people's criticism ignore the doubt ignore the the clouds of frustration or unbelief ignore that and then remember what god has done hallelujah i pulled up a few documents from my old com my old computer and i found lists of all these testimonies that god had done in my ministry i think the last time i updated was 2012. i've literally got like five to ten pages of testimonies of god healing people uh saving people helping marriages and i forgot about all these testimonies i tell you i read that i thought about 10 feet tall after that what well while i let the devil discourage me this has been a holy ghost ministry from the beginning hallelujah amen but it's a different phase now i'm not getting invitations out there that's fine but god wants me to focus on this ministry more even more so to build faith in your life to build character in your life can i say like this christ-like character amen remember what god has done like when i went through their brother and there was a brother in west virginia i was preaching and he said while i was preaching he prayed the holy ghost he'll heal him of a migraine that was probably 2005. i was like praise god we just had a migraine healed amen and then it was in the winter of 2010 that my wife while i was preaching christ the healer she said she got the revelation i'm a daughter of god i don't have to have migraines and she hasn't had one since she used to have them all the time now she had one that come on but she went to bed and that was it so 12 years look at that 12 years no migraines amen hallelujah amen that don't mean god's going to heal us every time but it shows god is the healer praise god amen and mo i'm sorry and david spoke about god twice as much as he did talk about goliath amen in other words church don't talk about your problems amen stop talking about your problems start talking about how big your god is amen hallelujah tell the devil how great christ is amen how christ blood paid for all of our sins and christ's blood defeats every devil in hell and how demons tremble at the name of jesus christ see talk more about god than your fear leaves and the church said talk about god twice as much for every time you feel a bad thought say two that are good good thoughts and watch your victory come hallelujah that's what we do with bang's dad that's what that picture is all about every time they bring up prayer said speak life speak a lie speak like it took two weeks to bring life but life came and life is here amen and then david ran to the fight he wasn't a procrastinator he dealt with a giant and he said i'm here god sent me here i got the revelation i've got the faith i've got the word of god i'm running to this this is going to end today praise god and yours that's what we can do you can leave here today with with your with your enemy defeated you can leave here today like a david amen you can leave here today in the power revelation and victory of the lord hallelujah i'm closing with this i'm bringing this back from a few uh well from last year i'm bringing this back three steps to being strong church if we're weak with fear or lust or greed or depression or anger or wrath anything whatever it is there's three steps to getting it back the first one is repentance and humility repent for your sins and be humble before the lord there's three steps to being strong say god forgive me of having uh nomophobia hallelujah jesus forgive me i've been destroying my relationships through my technoference technoference the interference of technology i've been letting technology interfere in my walk with the lord jesus forgive me of my cyber chondria i'm creating like brother man i said i'm crossing bridges before i even get there i'm creating symptoms that aren't even there i'm accepting devil's lies without you any proof without even consulting god about it forgive me of my delusion everybody's watching me everybody's going to hate me everyone's everyone's looking at me no everyone's everyone should be looking at christ that's the real thing so the first step to strength is repent and be humble the second as god told joshua remember god's promise and his faithfulness that's out of joshua 1. let's read it joshua 1 verse 5. i kind of feel like joshua tonight don't you feel like an overcomer how many feel strong in the lord and the power of his might joshua 1 joshua 1 verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee church and the bible says in hebrews 13 that god will never leave you or forsake you god will not leave you and god will not forsake you can we say amen to that amen he will not leave you he will not forsake you or push you aside or forget about you it's impossible for god to do that amen because he promised he wouldn't do it verse six be strong and have a good courage for unto this people shalt thou divide for inheritance the lamb which i swear unto their fathers to give them only will only do what if you want to possess all god has only be strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law so when you're strong and courageous you'll keep the commands of god church i'm fully convinced all of us and everybody in the world just need to look at our phones less praise god look at them less look to the word more right i'm able to go on my phone and i can see oh yeah this is how many hours i've spent listening to sermons i can check that out and that encourages me praise god most time i'm driving i'm listening to a sermon almost every time i got a 20 minute drive to work 20 minute home that's 40 minutes of sermons i already studied the hour or saturday in the morning hour two hours in the word of god then i got another hour of hearing the word of god and i got another 40 minutes on the drive home i can listen to the word of god see fill your mind with the word of god to be strong in the lord amen and then keep the commands and the bible said constantly speak them look at verse eight we'll finish with this one this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth see quote the word speak the word speak the word quote god's promises but thou shalt meditate there in day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for them thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shall have good success remember this church and remember this in deuteronomy moses told joshua to be strong and then in numbers god told joshua to be strong and then joshua 1 the officers told joshua to be strong but josh wasn't strong until chapter 10 when he took those five kings out of the cave and he put his foot on their necks and he said let all of israel know that we must be only strong and very courageous amen in other words church we've got to hear the word of god you can hear people say it all day but pretty soon you've got to make that word living your life you've got to obey that word let that word live in your life that word will become a reality to you and then everything you've heard will come out of your mouth amen hallelujah speak the word listen the word read the word until it comes out of your mouth until you believe it and then church you'll be a good success you'll be strong in the lord and the power of his might amen let's stand to our feet musicians can come or maokai remember this one if you want more faith the bible says build up your most holy faith pray in the holy spirit how many want to be stronger tomorrow amen well then pray tonight in the holy spirit praise god pray tomorrow in the holy spirit that's how you build up your strength hallelujah so praying is like lifting weights right praying is like lifting weights you're lifting these prayers to heaven right and each time you lift you get a little stronger you get stronger the more you pray the closer god gets now isn't this beautiful church strength and prayer is closely connected to what the love of god see keep yourself in the love of god not the fear of man you've got to choose i'm going to live in god's love i'm going to live in his strength i'm going to live in his courage i'm not going to run from the battle i'm going to run to the battle and be victorious amen build up your faith praying in the holy ghost keep yourself in the love of god because perfect love casts out all fear how many believe god loves them how many love god well let's take that love that we have tonight and cast out anything that's it's hurting us right it might be depression might be fear might be riches anything that's hindering our walk with god the bible says we can cast it down in fact love for god will cast it down in other words why am i worried about this i need to love god i don't need to think about this i mean i don't need to meditate on this i need to meditate on the word of god hallelujah amen then i'll be a good success let's pray let's bow our heads for a word of prayer here [Music] heavenly father we thank you for the word of god tonight lord i want to bring some of these old thoughts and hopefully bring some new thoughts to your god i

me lord i felt like it just come down jose pray thank you lord hallelujah you're so mindful you're so loving it's the lord we take every thought into captivity tonight by the power of the holy ghost so church just do that now any thought that's contrary to god's word make it a captive and cast it out just whisper that in prayer if you would if you're battling anything tonight you might not be but then pray for somebody else [Music] say lord jesus forgive me the order for joy and strength is to repent [Music] be humble say you're sorry and then pass that thought down cast that spirit down hallelujah and then meditate on the word obey the word and lord will be a good success the joy the lord shall return hallelujah thank you jesus [Music] lord let us not fear death oh death where is your sting o grave where's your victory but thanks be to god who gives us the victory to our lord jesus christ hallelujah thank you jesus that we're the joshua army lord today hallelujah we're building up our faith right now amen praying in the holy ghost hallelujah build up our faith tonight hallelujah thank you jesus may we keep ourselves in your love for love will cast out anything that exalts itself against the word of god thank you lord you promised you never leave us nor forsake us you promised you'd heal all our diseases even mental complexes like these even disorders from phones [Music] even tuberculosis lord as we said are cancer lord god or strokes heart attacks lord god you heal all diseases god because you're merciful because you care because you're loving and we love you back that dear god hallelujah you're our father you're a faithful merciful loving god we give you thanks to our god as we pray in the holy spirit build up our faith today oh god let us walk by faith and not by sight keeping ourselves in the love of god we are more than conquerors in christ jesus we are the children of god we are the sons of god now hallelujah that will be what we are we are kings and priests unto god ruling and reigning now in the spiritual realm hallelujah let's be kingdom minded hallelujah let's be more than conquerors in the kingdom of god in jesus christ's name saint said let's see this song here good and gracious
