TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and everybody else I think I know so uh before I get too far uh I want to greet everybody uh from Brother Jim uh he sends his greetings says hello and I'm just going to say everybody at the church said said hello because they they heard we were coming out here and they said hey tell them we said hi tell them we said hi so in a nutshell everybody says hi amen and uh just wonderful to have a uh body of Believers that we could just Fellowship together and be in agreeance amen and just uh following after the same thing after the right thing and uh pressing the course you know fighting the good fight of Faith amen and this brother you don't know yet uh I've been trying to get him out here to introduce y'all uh to him brother Austin Pew uh he moved up he moved up what last year about a year and a half ago something like that and uh but I've been trying to get him out here and uh he's a young Minister and uh I'm not trying to push his ministry I just want to come and in introduce him uh to the group over here because he hasn't he hasn't met y'all I think he's heard a lot about brother Jesse and uh so I I would like for for him to meet him and uh what I'd like to do today is a little bit uh unorthodox I guess you could say uh I I hope it's not dry uh because what I'd like like to do is go through four of the gospels not the whole thing now just uh go through one event and it's it's rare that uh uh one event goes through all four gospels uh so uh that's kind of what I'd like to uh do today so if I see uh falling asleep some yawning I I'll I'll try to close up I don't want to bore you I think this is a place I'm I'm used to setting a timer uh like at the home Church uh other places but I think this is a place that uh I don't need to set a timer uh I kind of grew up uh come and Minister for brother Jesse and brother Cam and uh both groups you know I I remember preaching at brother Cam's one time I wasn't very long he got up afterward he says well we typically like long services this is a little short but we'll take it so however the Lord leads that's the way that I I want to go and I'll try not to be too lengthy uh to keep you keep you hostage but you know on a day like this what else do you have to do so uh if you would turn with me uh to Matthew chapter 26 and starting in the first verse this is on the uh I usually like to title it later but uh I'd like to speak on the alabaster box the alabaster boxen so Matthew 26 first verse to the 16th still hear some pages turning says and it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these sayings he said unto his disciples ye know that after two days is the Feast of the Passover and the son of man is betrayed to be crucified so notice here this one says two days is the Feast of the Passover then assembled together the chief priests and the scribes and the Elders of the people unto the Palace of the high priest who was called Caiaphas and consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety and kill him they were trying to be secretive and discreet that's what subtlety is there uh and that's how the the serpent was uh he was the most subtle beast in the field so you see the kindred spirit that lies here this is the underlying root right here of the jealousy and the uh misunderstanding of why they are trying to ultimately kill him yes sir so verse five it says but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar among the people see they're trying to keep the people pleased at the same time but yet they're they're trying to take uh the blessing away from the people you know kind of doesn't make sense but that's how the devil operates uh now when Jesus was in be Bethany notice he was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper so there came unto him a woman having an alabaster box a very precious ointment it doesn't say just uh a precious ointment so this is something significant when it says very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at meat but when his disciples saw it they had indignation saying to what purpose is this waste for this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor when Jesus understood it he said unto them why trouble ye the woman for she hath wrought a good work upon me so this is a good work that this woman has done Upon Jesus for ye have the poor always with you but me you have not always so do what you can while he's around amen so for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body and a couple verses ahead before it says that uh it was it was poured on his head so Jesus is saying for in that she hath poured this ointment on my body she did it for my burial that's the whole reason why she did it for his burial preparing for the burial so verily I say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world there shall also this that this woman hath done be told for a memorial of her because she has done a wonderful act to him gave him honor gave him tribute and there will be a memorial morial wherever the gospel is preached of what she has done she didn't ask for it but it was just the effort that she put forth and that's the result of that so verse 14 then one of the 12 called Judas a scariot went unto the chief priests and said unto them what will you give me and I will deliver him unto you and they Covenant with him for for 30 pieces of silver and from that time he sought opportunity to betray him let's bow ahead heavenly father it's with great uh honor that I I stand here before your UH your people today and what a privilege it is Father we just pray that you would be with us help us guide us give us your wisdom uh help us to speak the words of truth and uh guard these lips that they wouldn't speak any G that they wouldn't speak any falseness oh god father we pray that you would be with the hearers that they would have understanding of what would be said today praying that uh it's a blessing to the people uh may they be instructed may they be encouraged may they draw closer unto you father we love you we appreciate you we pray that you would be with brother Josh Martin as he's ministering back at the home Church there and uh just pray that you would be with us through the remainder of the day and always as you had promised that you would never leave us nor forsake us we again we just ask all this in your precious name our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen may be seated so as we read uh through this I kind of wish I had a print out but uh I didn't do that uh so it's going to take me a little bit to kind of go back and forth I just kind of want to uh skim over that pretty quick as I called attention to certain uh details is that they were uh it was two days before the Passover this is in Matthew two days before the Passover they were in Bethany and in the house of Simon the leper uh and the woman came to him with an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head now I'm pointing out these different details because uh not that it's amongst us but I've read different things of of how people will debate and dispute uh this whole story because they're concerned about different details uh but if you if you witness a a car accident or an accident at work or something else a Breakin whatever it might be if you have witnessed to action and I'm a witness to an action and the sister here is a witness to that same action they're going to get three different stories from three different Witnesses because it's three different viewpoints three different perceptions so all three of us are not going to line up exactly in every detail these gospels were written by men that were were moved by the Holy Spirit men that were there that got to see things happen and that's just the nature of being a witness is that you might not have all the same details as somebody else and they the the people want uh this detail exactly the same as another detail where you're not going to have that well they say well if God wrote it well these men wrote it as they were moved by the holy spirit so there's going to be some kind of differences and that just shows you of how a human can be used of the Lord right and come up with the same account because they they were writing it much many many more uh many years later here I go again I was having problems talking on the way here so hopefully you get everything understood uh so when they wrote it years later and trying to recall different things you're going to miss some things right so they were just trying to write the account of what they saw and what happened so is it okay if if if some of those details aren't exactly the same you know so it it doesn't deter me from reading the word and and being closer to the Lord it it doesn't push me away so if if you notice at verse eight it says but when his disciples saw it that they had indignation so it's just general it doesn't specify which disciple it just says when his disciples saw it that they had indignation uh and in verse 12 it says uh well in verse 10 excuse me where is it that she anointed him on on it poured it on his head in verse seven so on his head and then a few verses later it says uh Jesus is saying that sheath poured this ointment on my body so right there it almost looks like a uh a discrepancy to different readers well one part is a head one part is the body well the head is part of the body right so and people just get uh caught up in so many of these uh little details that really doesn't mean a whole lot but yet they they they try to uh they try to nullify because well this isn't matching here and if it's supposed to fit dovetail uh then this isn't matching and the puzzle piece isn't going to fit it doesn't fit according to their the ology and what they don't want it to fit to amen so we have to be careful that we don't read it that way with a bias but we need to read the scripture with an open heart open mind and open prayer right so let's turn to Mark 14 starting in the first verse this is the same story remember this this is the same story and I hate using the word story because it sounds like a a bedtime story or a uh uh a fictional story I don't believe that it's fictional right because we have four witness accounts of the same happening well there's something there there might be one that that that might not be the same story but we we'll get to that one and that's that's where people have an issue uh Mark 14 and verse one it says after two days was the Feast of the Passover and of unleavened bread and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by Craft and put him to death see taking him by subtlety and and to kill him so verse two it says' but they said not on the feast day lest there be an uproar of the people and being where in Bethany and where the house of Simon the leper so these two were saying the same thing as he sat at meat there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of nerd okay we got something different there nerd but it also says very precious so this is something that signifies that is very valuable and she break the box and poured it on on his head so those two are collaborative they're they're together they're in saying the same thing and there verse four it says and there were some that had indignation within themselves now this one says and there were some it doesn't say the disciples it doesn't specify one individual it just says that there are some that had indignation within themselves and said why was this waste of the ointment made for it might have been sold for more than 300 p and have been given to the poor and they murmured against against her verse six it says and Jesus said let her alone why trouble ye her she hath wrought a good work on me see this is an emphasis right here is that she has done a good work to him she didn't even realize what she was doing she didn't realize the magnitude of the The Works that she is doing to him but it made such an impact on Jesus that he he's even saying that she wrought a good work on me now let's kind of give a back background to the story does everybody understand what kind of woman this was okay so she had no business one people thought she had no business being in the presence of the Lord you know I don't know if you ever feel that way that you you you do something bad and then you feel that you can't you you you don't deserve his grace you don't deserve to be in the presence of the Lord but repentance right here right here is an example yes a sinner an ill-fame woman she knew what she did she had to go buy the box and she knew what she did before she bought the Box she knew what she was doing with the box right she had plans for this box knowing what kind of a person she was knowing she was damaged goods but until she gets into the presence she didn't know exactly why she was going to do it all she knew she was going to do it she had planned to do it there was something on the inside there's something on the inside of you when you raise your hands to Worship the Lord when you speak some encouragement to somebody there's something with it you don't know why you're saying something I remember saying something here one time to a brother I don't know why I said it but it came out later of why it was being said we might not know why we're saying something but we feel pushed we feel pressed right there's something that we just need to do with it look we're not armchair uh we're not armchair Christians we need to get out do something you know we can't just say that we're Christians right but there has to be Works following that right am so and this is her works of showing that she she was going to get something even if she didn't get favor she wanted to pay him this tribute she at least did something and made an attempt to do something so he says uh sheath wrough a good work on me for ye have the poor with you always and whensoever you will uh whensoever you will you may do them good but me you have not always she have done what she could right there she wasn't highly intelligent she wasn't a Pharisee she didn't know all the scriptures but she did what she could she can't Minister from a Pulpit she might not be the Glorious singer in the church but she did what she could somebody might try to sit her down oh she has no place Place doing this she has no place and they had that indignation don't you know what kind of woman this is and you're letting her touch you she did what she could maybe that's what we should have titled it this morning but she did what she could she did something about it not being an armchair Christian I don't know that thought was in my mind this morning Hallelujah but she has come a forehand to anoint my body to the burying and if you read the chapter before this the two I think it's two not quite the third but at least the two previous chapters in in Matthew before preceding this the uh uh Matthew 24:25 he's telling the whole story about him having to go and be crucified he's telling of things of what's going to come and here he's here she's coming and anointing him for that purpose Hallelujah and the disciples have indignation for the work she's doing to him yes they didn't recognize who they were with oh we're with Jesus he does all these Miracles he's able to discern people's hearts but they didn't realize who was who the what presence they were in they couldn't see that far and these are the people that walked with him these are the people that served with him yes they learned from him amen so verse n it says verily I say unto you wheresoever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world this also that she hath done shall be spoken of for for a memorial of her see it's the same thing saying the same thing as Matthew right it's going to be a memorial for her and because it made such a mark on him that he really appreciated that and said she did a good thing even when the disciples thought that that uh uh uh she had no business doing it now did the disciples have the same Spirit as the Pharisees that were trying to kill him in subtlety yes see there was oh why let's visit that there for a second yes sir if you go back you know Jesus had his eyes to go somewhere else and the and and the people were kind of upset because it looked like he wasn't paying attention to them it looked like he didn't want to be there so uh uh uh the disciples got upset I can't remember I think it might have been Peter he said Lord shall we call down fire from heaven he said you don't know what Spirit you're of right why because back in the Old Testament when the prophet called down fire it was because they were searching after another God he said is there not a God that's a Healer and you're seeking some other you're seeking some other entity other than me and then they wanted to come to the prophet and slay the prophet see it's been the same age it's that same old devil it's that same old sloof trying to trying to take down the righteousness that's right and it's the same spirit that you see right here the spirits don't die amen he says in verse 10 it says in judas's scariot one of the 12 went unto the chief priest to betray him unto them and when they heard it they were glad and promised to give him money and he sought how we might conveniently betray him and we see that's the same thing Matthew says the same thing that it was Judas that that had indignation and it it wasn't because he wanted to give the money to the poor it's because he was a Treasurer and he was greedy I think got to watch them [Laughter] treasure sorry that was a sideline that that was unnecessary sorry you got watch you got to watch the spirit be behind whoever's amen so so you see in Simon the Lep's house let's visit this here for a second whose house was it Simon the leper now does that seem odd to anybody that there were people in Simon the Lep's house because the law of the leper is you couldn't even have fellowship with people because you had had to be isolated so what happened either he was lepress and was delivered of leprosy or he was not fulfilling the law because in leprosy a person with Leprosy now there's different things in in the in the whole law of it different types if it's if it's white or if it's not if it's a on the whole body there are different levels of whether they could be with people or not and I think it's 10 days that they have to sit outside the camp and the priest had to decide if they were healed or not before that they can come back in Fellowship why because it was contagious yeah that could go a whole another thing the a little leev leth the whole LP right there so so in Luke uh chapter 7 uh so he had to have been healed or something something there right he had to have been delivered of of the leprosy so I don't know why they still call him Simon the leper it could have been because he had leprosy and that's how they were uh uh uh labeling the person of how they could uh uh uh distinguish between uh there aren't twoo a there two names in here anywhere two of the same names so it's so they could distinguish you we distinguish uh brother Brian Crosman from myself you know that's Uncle Brian and I'm brother Brian you know almost everybody calls him Uncle bran at the church so so that would be a distinguishing so that that might be a term used to distinguish this Simon from other Simons because there were a lot of Simons there were a lot of jesuses Amen there were a lot of the same names so in Luke chapter 7 and 22 it says then Jesus answering said unto them go your way and tell John what things you have seen and heard how that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed right the deaf here the dead are raised to the poor the gospel is preached now I wonder if this Simon the leper was one of these that was that was healed one of these ones that was cleansed now if that's the case he should have had a different attitude of what was going on here right now I'm not saying he was or or wasn't I don't know if he was I I don't know we don't see that in there if he was the one cleansed amen so and we can only infer a little bit from from the information that's given to us so Alabaster box what is an alabaster box you might think that it's something that's so great and magnificent but here you go it's a box made of alabaster which uents the contents are preserved the Ancients considered Alabaster to be the best material in which to preserve their ointments breaking the Box probably means breaking the seal of the box so it's just a storage box to keep ointment yes but it's made out of the best material amen so so what she went and she didn't just go get a little Cedar box you know something for the poor she went and got an alabaster box something that was of the best material yes I say oh my brother I'm going to be all over the place let's go back into Malachi yes where the priest were wanting to give over the lame and the Halk and not the not the choice lamps yes they were shirking their duties why because they were cheating it a little bit she wasn't she wasn't cheating any bit right there she was giving her all let's visit that woman with the two mites just maybe a couple pennies but there were people that were given offering and they were given man they might have been given a couple hundred dollar bills and they think they were given a lot but what did we learn from that parable right that that woman that gave the least amount of money gave the most yeah why because it's not out of our abundance it's out of our lack of what we give right that's the value now she didn't have much but she gave her all she did what she could to get the best for the best he's not some some lame junkie that somebody found out of an alley but he's the king of kings and the Lord of lords amen this man is something important and she didn't give him a lame box a broken box a cheap box a piece of cardboard keeping this ointment in but she gave him of the best material and that just speaks volumes against the ones that were so righteous in that day speak volumes of the ones who should have known hallu the ones that knew the scriptures so well yes sir they know it's so good but they didn't understand it that's right they had eyes to see but couldn't see they had ears to hear but they couldn't hear Hallelujah they were as deaf and dumb and blind as somebody that was in the natural yes sir they couldn't navigate in the Supernatural so what is a spike there we everybody doing okay this morning so let's see what nerd is nerd a very expensive luxury a very expensive luxury item used in perfumes and incense when we have that understanding that she gave the best something very expensive she gave her all for it no matter what her past was yes she wasn't looking at that amen she wasn't looking at well I'm a Baptist well I'm a Methodist well I'm a message I'm a Pentecostal brother sister he's not looking at that he's looking at the blood tag he's looking at the effort that you're putting into it amen he's seeing if you're giving your all not just your effort and just the works to to say that I'm better than somebody but he's looking at your Works to say I believe you Lord I have my faith I believe you so much that I'm going to go out and work for you you speaking to me you want me to do something I'm going to go do it amen that's the value when you sacrifice your time and your money and something for him hallelujah what is a purchase it's sacrificing something to gain something else we go right into the pearl of great price but I'm going to try to focus historically historically it's used to anoint individuals of high esteem of high esteem this was for rich people this was for important people these are for potentates these are this is for Kings not for peasants that's why they were getting upset because they must have had the understanding that Jesus Jus was a peasant he was a poor man he didn't even have a place to lay his head so what was their perception that he's a poor peasant no wonder their indignation came up and this was I didn't even think about this one but they didn't even consider of who he was they didn't know whose presence they were in they didn't know him as king yet they didn't know him as as as Lord of lords yet they didn't know that yetu but this is just to tell you of how how precious it says very precious ointment this isn't everyday uh uh I don't know Johnson's Baby Shampoo it's pretty common stuff right but this is something very expensive to anoint important people people of High esteem so whereas it's used to anoint a person's head which we see that's what she did right broke the box and poured it on his head oh but but it gets even a little bit better used to anoint a person's head whereas the anointing of Jesus feet was considered a waste oh my and that goes along with people not holding him in high regard it's used in religious ceremonies oh but here's a good one coming good thing y'all are sitting down but you might be up here in a minute it's used for emotional and mental well-being this happened when two days before the Passover and what happened after the crucifixion what happened before the crucifixion The Garden of Gethsemane where he faced his greatest struggle he faced his greatest battle to where he said Lord if it be possible let this cup pass from me but nevertheless not my will but I want to continue with your willj not what I want because I want to quit I want to give up this is a weak moment for me and it was so stressful that he was sweating blood yes sir which comes from an extreme stressful situation so this is for an emotional and mental well-being that are among the most celebrated uses of Spiker essential oil it's calming scent see its calming scent is known to have a soothing effect on the mind a soothing effect on the mind making it an excellent aid for reducing Stress and Anxiety y so what was the purpose of she breaking the alabaster box and pouring it on his head what did Jesus say It was done for his burial for his death this was in preparation it wasn't just a a coincidental thing that a that an ill-fame woman spent everything she had on an expensive ointment to anoint him there was a purpose behind it Hallelujah she didn't understand it but he understood it Hallelujah no wonder he could say she had WR a good work on me she had no indignation what did she have to lose consider her place consider your place what do you got to lose come and give your all to him Hallelujah the oil's properties are believed to help balance the emotions providing Tranquility calming him down as a human while you're making him man yes I am making him man because he was fully man but the you say he's God yes he's fully god well I don't understand that well a lot of people don't but once your eyes are open you you can see that he's able to be both man fully and God fully yes sir amen not just a little bit part here and a little bit part here but he's all in all he was the fullness of the godhead bodily Hallelujah fulfilling the scriptures amen yes sir Speak Lord oh my this makes it a valuable asset in bringing peace and Tranquility amen this makes it a valuable asset in practices like meditation and yoga but it's far beyond that brother where it aids in creating a Serene environment you ever been in the presence of the Lord where there's chaos happening in your life and then you happen to come to a service and then all of a sudden you're in that service and you're given worship and that atmosphere becomes Serene amen why because a prince of peace has showed up the king of glory has showed up amen where it aids in creating a Serene environment conducive to relaxation and introspection Jesus was more than likely getting more and more stressed as the days were getting closer for his crucifixion so no wonder he had this ointment amen prise praise the Lord amen yes sir now everyone has their own opinion on how to worship God right you have your way of worshiping God but sometimes you get so stuck to your Traditions that you think everybody has to worship the same way that you do yes sir and that's the hindering aspect is the tradition because if you're Traditions you've been held back because of their Traditions they couldn't see God because of their Traditions they couldn't be set free we are bound by Traditions Hallelujah If We Hold to those Traditions if we let go of that tradition we could be set free brother sister Hallelujah all we have to do is just let go in the presence of the Lord one time amen praise the Lord and people try to say oh this is the right way to worship this you got to raise your hand this way you got to raise your left hand you got to raise both hands you got to have them down low you got to be able to jump one time you got to be able turn around two times people come up with some weird stuff man it's weird show me in the scripture where it says that there was nowhere in the scripture where it's going to say hey bring an alabaster box to some strange man that comes into a leopard's house and anoint him with all yes there was something that pressed on her that she felt that she had some Liberty amen praise God if we just let go one time stop being so stuffy yes sir get on fire one time baby we were listening to some songs this morning the the refiner and then touched by I can't remember what it was yeah touched by a fire I said oh my maybe we should change this this is two songs of having fire in a row but we need a little bit of fire amen youo if you believe the message with brother B he says yo it's okay to get a little out of order now and then because we need a little bit of fire right it's better to have a little fire than no fire at all she did what she could amen so we're going to do what we can amen for what for our Glory uh-uh we don't seek our own that's what love is if we love him we're going to come with love amen so could you just imagine this woman coming into a house that she wasn't even invited more than likely or maybe because of her past maybe she was invited for a certain reason but in her mind she wasn't going to do that no more that's right the things that she used to do she wasn't going to do it no more this was a deciding fact factor in her life that I'm going to bring this I'm done with it I'm through with it and it shows because she spent all that money that she earned from doing what she did on a something for much more righteous praise God Amen so could you imagine this woman coming into a house that she was more than likely not invited you ever go into somebody's house even if you were invited you just feel uncomfortable you just feel a little out of place yes sir why because you're the only one from Pennsylvania you feel a little bit out of place because y'all worship a little bit different y'all sing songs a little bit different from what we do but we got the same Spirit brother Hallelujah if we're not on the same beat we'll get there my kids are said that's just you Dad but imagine this woman coming in could you imagine the easy feeling that she's got the feeling of not belonging knowing her past coming in where there's Pharisees the disciples and Jesus just imagine the weight that's on our shoulders of how she doesn't feel or how she feels that she doesn't belong he took that right away now didn't he sir he made her feel the most most welcome there ever yes sir oh my because she didn't come the way that they thought she should have come well you're supposed to knock on the door three times and wait until you're invited you know before I gave my heart to the Lord I asked my wife you know I felt the pool to go to the Altar and it was it was for like three weeks that I didn't go and I felt that pool and I thought I should have gone and I asked my wife you know uh people were up at the altar and I tap I said do you have to be a member to go up in front no okay I got that cleared up then you don't tell anybody I ask that question why did I ask that question I didn't know it's okay to ask questions here's something else here here's another Rabbit Trail here we go the difference between oh no I just lost his name Zechariah Elizabeth's husband and Mary when they both both asked the question when they were given the situation hey this is going to happen how so how's that going to be two different ideas behind the question good two different reasons behind the question yes same question how one was in disbelief as the other one believed and I don't see it but okay let's gol amen see see we don't want to but oh I'm trying to remember the scripture now Lord help me but I think it's back don't sit in the seat of the scornful cuz see when you sit in the seat of the scornful when you're sitting there criticizing everybody of how they're worshiping so wrong because it's not down to and this is stuff I want so sitting there criticizing people how they worship because they don't worship the same way that you do what's happening right brother you're missing out on what the presence of the Lord you're so busy worried about something else when you should be concentrating on breaking that Alabaster Box and anointing him on his head amen hallelujah giving God oh my giving him a little bit of Glory giving him a little bit of worship giving him a little bit of sacrifice of your time quit worrying about everybody else Hallelujah we got to focus on him glory to God hallelujah oh my see the problem is these people had so much pride they couldn't let go yes sir yes sir she had nothing but humility to know where where knowing her where she came from Hallelujah nothing but humility yes Glory she had nothing to lose hallelujah amen wonderful praise the Lord I need a drink I'm not your's age I wish I was though we'd probably be doing something different right now I can't jump as high as cam I I can't jump on this pulit amen but you know why do people make things a competition out of everything right I got the best shoes you probably do brother I got the best shirt you probably do I got the best house I got the best vehicle you probably do right well I can get closer to God you probably can I know the scripture way better than you I know the message way better than you and you probably do right it's not where it is brother brandom said you know the man came and told Brother brand well you don't know your Bible he said that might be so you might know it better than me and you know that man was humble enough to say these these men here sitting in here probably know the Bible better than I do talking about the theologians right that takes a lot for a man to say especially when they come and Blas him about different things oh you're he's so prideful show me because he had so much humility that he could say that somebody knew more than he did right brother yes but what did he say I know the author real well God so where we sitting brother and sister Hallelujah you might memorize so many scriptures and I probably forgot all the scriptures that I memorize then you probably have memorized you young now I'm not gloating somebody could be competitive in that but if we can come together and we can agree we're going to Worship the Lord amen praise the Lord what can I do for you what can I pray for you with Hallelujah we come unified in the spirit amen that's where it is because why we're not looking at one another am you're going to forget what color shirt I'm wearing today by next week what does that matter people are looking at carnality way too much Hallelujah you were off key here you threw me off I couldn't sing the rest of the rest of the service sorry get used to it because that's how I am I might be offbeat but that's how I am because I'm going to make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord you might criticize I don't care because I'm going to sing and I'm going to sing with gusto Hallelujah my kids are musicians and they probably cringe every time I sing or do something they could do that at home just don't criticize me in the church in the middle of worship because then it's on you amen because they should be worshiping where we should be in worship I better get going here amen but you know this woman had the idea she I think she had an idea of where Jesus was because she sought him out I oh brother that's not the way it was in the Garden of Eden that's not what I'm talking about he's coming seeking after you giving that press she answered that press already but now it seek him just like David brother Jesse the Lord told her seek me and he said says thy face Lord will I seek Hallelujah that press was already there she was answering that press by seeking him out amen oh my see people will just stop just short of it you have almost made it who was it that that that and I'm preaching like four or five different messages yes sir that man you know the the Lord asked him well how do you see this and he answers and he says Thou Art not far from the kingdom of heaven yes sir good but the whole thing behind that is you almost made it but you have to go another step further you can't just stop well I got a I got a scoffield King James Bible that's good enough I can stop there I'll read it once in a while just so I could say with a good conscience when somebody asks have you been reading your Bible well yes I've been reading my Bible but I'm not going to tell you that it was three months ago that I read my Bible we can't quit on them now brother and sister but we've got to press press on Amen seeking him out every day Paul said I Die daily and he also said with my mind I serve the Lord hallelujah putting the things in the past behind me because I'm letting go of that weight that's easily besetting me but I'm going to go on and I'm going to press as hard as I can I'm going I'm not just going to throw out a couple quarters and buy some cheap thing like most people do at Christmas time because they wait until the last minute and oh man I got to get something then they're in the checkout line oh this is good enough right is that how your spiritual life is good enough do something until the last minute oh it's time for communion oh I better get my heart right your heart should be right up until amen because every day should be a communion with my Sweet Lord amen Lord speak that's I'm having a good time I don't know about you oh my but this woman she gave her all she gave everything everything that she had she gave him her heart she gave him her despair she gave him her shame she gave him her guilt she gave him her ill Fame condition she gave him her confession she gave him her repentance she gave him [Music] everything when we let go of everything what's going to weigh you down it's the accuser of the Brethren is it okay brother it's the accuser of the brotherr that's trying to hold you down yes sir that blood isn't weak brother and sister but it cleanses everything in the past to where we become a new creature in Christ oh my coming into the perfect law of Liberty oh my nothing is held against you amen I might have said this before but do yall understand that word Justified yes let's kind of put this word in perspective Justified my kids know where I'm going you use contractions like it's going to be a good day they're rejoicing in the Holy Ghost they are right so let's use a contraction just if i' I had just if I'd never done it in the first place Justified simplified amen praise the Lord let's turn to Luke chapter 7 I better get going we'll be here all day Luke 7 verse 36 everybody doing okay [Music] amen somebody praise the Lord praise the Lord amen Luke 7 and starting 36th verse it says and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him see this this Pharisee desired Jesus to come and eat with him right and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet verse 37 it says and behold a woman in the city which was a sinner which we know this already right when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box see she knew that he sat at meat I couldn't remember but I should have remembered because there but he knew that uh Jesus sat at meet in the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping oh my being in the presence of the Lord some people react differently people that love the Lord when they recognize when they're in the presence of the Lord will respond differently than somebody that cannot recognize who he is what he's done and in that they're in the presence yes sir when she got into the presence oh my I had this thought here a little while back you know if you read through I know it's another Trail if you read through when the angel of the Lord when an angel came in the presence of a man what did the man do they bow down and to give obeisance to bow down before them and give honor and tribute and what did the angel say see thou do it not because I'm not the one that you need to worship if a man is compelled to do that in the presence of an Angel oh my how should we as a Believer respond in the presence of the almighty amen if a man is going to do that in the presence of an Angel how much more we should do that in the Lord's presence amen sir so her coming in the presence of the Lord she was weeping and she began to wash his feet with her tears brother sister that wasn't just a little dribble that wasn't a little squeeze out of tear because I know it's not right to give a drye confession this was this was a sincere repentance because remember she gave him her all she's giving him all of her repentance oh here goes another one now repentance we understand repentance I think some people might not fully understand what repentance is see they go so far and they say Lord forgive me but it's just like the Old Testament and they continue on doing what they were doing yes sir but repentance means to stop what you're doing yes not go in the same direction but it means to turn and go the opposite direction the things you used to do do them no more that is repentance not saying well I've been forgiven this time and then after I go to service I'll go right back to what I'm doing that's not repentance Hallelujah that is a motive to continue in sin that is making Grace disgrace oh my there's a difference she had she was giving everything this is a sincere repentance amen that she had flowing tears tears enough to wash his feet and we think that a little shot glass not that I want you to know what a shot glass is but it's just a what uh I don't even think it's a full ounce but it's small enough and we think that that might that's not enough to wash his feet what did it say in the other one she did what she could and she did her best that whether it was a shot glass or whether it was a what I can't even remember what they're called like the one liter the big slams whether it's a big drink or whether it's a small one you give them all the worship that you can you give them all that you have you might have a little bit of Faith don't look at other people with great faith because it's going to ruin your faith amen so whether it was a little or whether it was a lot it doesn't matter it just says that she washed his feet with her tears amen amen but what does matter here is that she wiped them with their hairs of her head she had enough hair I'm so glad I don't have to worry about that but she that and the the the woman's hair is the glory of her right it's her glory she oh my she even surrendered her glory to what washing his feet and the ointment was something so great it was looked down upon for using it on his feet and she gave him her glory that she dried his feet with the lowest part of his body looked as the the dirtiest part of a body and she humbled herself enough to surrender her glory that should give a whole new meaning of this scripture that should give a whole new meaning to you to come with more sincerity to give out more of you to him amen what is the next one and kissed his feet she brought herself so low that she even kissed the lowest part of his body and anointed them with ointment verse 39 now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself saying this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches them for she is a sinner and Jesus answering saying unto him Simon I have somewh to say unto thee and he saith Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 p and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which which of them will love him most Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou Hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon you see this woman see us thou this woman I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she has washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss at all gave me no entertainment at all didn't even acknowledge that I came in having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof quit just having a form have that godliness thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in ha not ceased to kiss my feet my hand with oil thou did not anoint but this woman ha anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven amenallah for she loved much but to whom little was forgiven the same loveth little not to be competitive but I love the Lord a lot why because I've been forgiven a lot I'm not saying go out there and sin as much as you can just to say you love him is so much more than somebody else but you come with what you have you're going to do what you can don't try to have somebody else's testimony you bring your testimony it doesn't have to be something so great because somebody who's bragging on their testimony isn't really isn't really sorry that they did it probably why because they're bragging about it when they should be remorseful about it yeah those are the things that I used to do and sometimes it's funny because like I think I told told yall that I put on a dress one time yes I'll have to tell you brother sometime later there's a long story and that was a long time ago and it wasn't for that reason it was out of a dare so I'll just leave it at that I've been forgiven much you don't have to magnify your testimony just tell the truth yes sir amen just tell What the Lord Has Done For You Hallelujah god well I don't have a testimony the Lord hasn't done much we talk about it a lot back at home you made it to church didn't you you make it to work day in day out you make it to the grocery store day in day out you got food on your table you got CL clothes on your back you got a roof over your head yes sir yes sir it might not be like Donald Trump's and it might not be like the the homeless beggar on the street but you got something am we got to stop looking for the best of material things that's carnality we should be looking for the best things to give to our Lord give him the best of our service give him the best of what we have amen hallelujah and they that sat at meat with with him began to say within themselves who is this that forgive us sins also see and that just goes to show that they had no idea whose presence they were in and he said to the woman thy faith has saved thee go in peace hallu see it didn't say when this was taking place the other two said two days before the Passover right but it was in the city it doesn't say which city it just says in a city but it it's conclusive that there was a sinner and it was a woman she brought some ointment she anointed his body we'll just we'll just keep it as the body regardless of it's head or feet we'll just say body okay because we understand that those are parts of the body so we know that there was an anointing of this ointment on his body there was a washing of feet there was a drying of so and we know that Jesus people were had indignation toward the toward the action that took place right so people were upset of what she was doing so we could say that these these iters items are conclusive he doesn't say anything about the poor in in this particular book here right so it almost looks like it's a different place why because it says of a Pharisee it doesn't say Simon it doesn't say a leper but it appears to be the same thing you it's hard for me to believe that this is a coincidence that two identical situation two identical events are taking place I have a hard time with that you could try to convince me but to me it doesn't really matter okay all I know all I'm seeing is what he taught that's what I got out of this I didn't pick out all these little details of of what's lining up from one book to the other I picked out the lesson that's what spoke to me Hallelujah that's what brings it to light hallelujah amen so John chapter 12 and I'll try to I don't we doing okay yes sir John chapter 12 verse one you can call me crazy you can tell me I don't mind know my Bible you can tell me I don't have the understanding that's fine that's Dandy that's okay I'm okay with that as long as that's you if the Lord told me that I would be like this woman getting in his presence in repenting amen so you see the difference I'm not here to please you you're not here to please your fellow man so John chapter 12 starting in the first verse it says then Jesus when six days before the Passover oh the other one was two days and the other one was unspecified oh we got a discrepancy we don't believe the word anymore I'm not going to go to church I can't read the Bible if it can't be if if it's if there's no continuity in there then I just can't believe a Bible that breaks continuity that's the argument that you he brothers and sisters but you know I'm going to combat that thing and say that that Spirit was there before that Spirit was already in place that Spirit doesn't want to see the truth that's that spirit is already a blind spirit and that's what I got to say about that so then Jesus six days before the Passover came to Bethany same place where Lazarus was which had been dead whom he raised from the dead so people knew about those wonder they knew the possibilities they knew the potential that's why I kind of wonder if this Simon the leper was amongst them of the lepers that were cleansed but hey then it says then took who Mary now it's specifying an individual oh this can't be the same story as the other three right that's the argument I'm not I'm not saying that personally I'm I'm thinking this is the same thing so then took Mary a pound of ointment of nerd very costly and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair same story same things happening right and the house was filled with the odor of ointment then saith one of the disciples oh even this is the same all four somebody was upset all four they had indignation at the event taking place yes Hallelujah all four were critical of a worship to the Lord and the house was filled with the odor of ointment then saith one of his disciples Judas es scariot up there's another one sing L out now we're getting somewhere John has a habit of doing that of being a little bit more specific I love how brother gab Smith did that the Book of John oh man that was some good eating that day that brother brought out so much stuff oh my good that I that was a good message so then saith one of his disciples Judas the scariot Simon's son oo Simon's son which should betray him so we know Judas the scariot is the one who betrayed him the first two we see Simon the leper doesn't say that he was a Pharisee right in Luke we see that it was Simon a Pharisee where we getting here so Simon the leper a Pharisee this is where they're now this is my understanding is this okay brother Jesse I know I came with something different I didn't know how he was going to respond to this I'll find out afterward he he's been so gracious and and extending me liberty to to come and and speak so he has confidence that I'm not going to intentionally lead you down a wrong path right so so we see uh one of the disciples which is Judas a scariot and we know that is going to betray Jesus right so and this is Simon's son why was uh uh uh Judas is asking why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor so now it gets to the the the root of the issue here of Judas was the the the bag holder right he was the treasurer his motive wasn't so much that he wanted to give to the poor and I don't believe that that was his true motive right sometimes you hear oh boy here he goes that form of godliness sometimes you hear people have a confession and they say things because they're sooth saying telling you something that you want to hear but there're a sheep and wolves clothing right so it's a deception so be careful watch that person watch that Spirit yes sir watch that spirit because you'll see it manifest in other places when they're not paying attention when they're not trying to be so so good in front of everybody when they let loose a little bit you'll see the tress don't you worry you don't have to force it it it'll just come all by itself right it it'll show yes sir we just have to have our eyes open to it so verse six he says then he said not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief in case if you thought what I said was wrong he say this is saying itself that he didn't care for the poor so not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief and had the bag and bear what was put therein verse 7 then said Jesus let her alone against the day of my burying has she kept this same thing same situation right for the uh for the poor you always you have with me or with you but me ye have not always much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there and they came not for jesus' sake only but that they might see Lazarus also whom he had raised from the dead but the chief priest consult Ed that they might put Lazarus also to death because why that by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus oh you know what's taking place there taking money out of their pocket so now it's therefore no longer lucrative in this church because true things are happen oh they're prelighting they're pulling people away is taking money out of their pocket see there's no money in my pocket so you can't take it it's already gone now it's just set aside so this this was the whole reason this is the root of it because they were taking the Jews away from them because in their eyes they were going to look to the public they were going to be they were no longer significant see these people had so much pride that they broadened their filteries to look so much more Pious than other people oh my so Simon is uh Judas iscariot's father Simon the leper Simon the Pharisees Simon judas's Father the are they the same person to me and does it mean any does it matter not really I'm just trying to tie the story together a little bit so John 12:4 says then saith one of his disciples Judas the scari at Simon's son which should betray him Simon's son right so in John 13:2 it says and supper being ended the devil having now put into the heart of Judas the scariot Simon's son to betray now John 11 and verse one this is this is kind of strange to me but it's there and everybody's waiting now remember we read in John 12 and now this is John 11 it says now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha well what significance is that so verse two it was that Mary oh my it was that Mary that which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick this is mentioned before the event actually took place in chapter 12 that was a little strange to me but uh but we also have the understanding that they they wrote the scriptures later right yes sir so this isn't this isn't real time okay so so I'm going to try to bring things to a close everybody okay so and you might be asking in your mind I've kind of asked that already is what is the purpose of you bringing out all these differences so because one thing is is there's there are people having dispute and disagreements and arguing over these like I said earlier that uh that the uh the details of each of the story okay so that that's one thing so Luke chap chapter 10 and verse 38 I just want to read this uh real quick it says now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain Village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house just kind of distinguishing the the service of of Mary and Martha because this is going back and this is saying that this is the same uh situation here right because we read the this was this was that Mary that uh anointed his head and washed his feet so uh now it came to pass as they went that he entered into a certain Village and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house and she had a sister called Mary which also sat at jesus' feet and heard his word where was she sitting at jesus' feet what happened in these stories that we read as she anointed his feet so she was at his feet in this same story right here uh verse 40 but Martha was cumbered about much serving and came to him and said Lord Dost thou not care that my sister hath left me uh uh to serve alone bid her therefore that she helped me and Jesus answered and said unto her Martha Martha Thou Art come about uh uh excuse me thou art careful and troubled about many things but one thing is is needful and Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her why because we read in the other ones that that act is a memorial unto her and what she did there being at the feet of Jesus doing a good work unto [Music] him brother sister the parable that Jesus had had had talked about when you gave somebody something to drink you gave something you gave somebody something to eat you clothed somebody and what did he say when you did it to the least of these you did it unto me so when we do something for one another we are doing a great work for him so let us do what we can can while we can amen so but one thing is needful Mary has chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her now see we were talking on the way here uh sh was saying you know it just seems to be that spirit in this day and it is is that everything is just fast busy fast busy have no time for doing things but that's where it comes to get your Alabaster Box you can call it time what's in your Alabaster Box yes hallelujah what are you going to bring what is important to you me personally I'm going to be honest and open and tell you I need to answer that same question myself I have to reflect I have to go back and see what's important to me and choose the priority going to a volleyball game to suffice a friend's invitation isn't more important than the word of God I'm not saying those things are bad but if you're busy busy busy busy and that's like the the lowest of the priority of the list throughout the day and you need to get into the presence of the Lord should probably sh that uh unless you gave your word because you better hold on to your word that's why try not to give your word that way you're not held to something right if you will try to go there if the Lord will we'll go there tomorrow this this day that day right so everything okay praise the Lord so how will the bride make herself ready it's not going to be like Martha it's not going to be comfort about much things and and being busy busy busy busy that uh no time for anything but it's coming like Mary it's coming like Mary because she have chosen the right thing amen so through all this I'm going to say uh through all these details that were given and the the comparison that that's nice as a as a conversation piece you know talking about different things and bouncing off ideas off of one hey what do you think about this story I'm kind of having a hard time you know putting things together uh so what was what was a point of of bringing that it doesn't matter who was where where they were you know who they were doesn't matter who they were where they were what they were doing uh it matters what they were doing that's but do you understand what I mean but the the through this whole situation I don't we don't know how many people were were there we know that Simon the leper was there we know that Judas was there and it says disciples so I can only infer that there are more than one disciple there right so it says more than one disci indicates more than one disciple we know Mary was there we know Martha was there we know Lazarus was there we know that other people gathered because they wanted to see Lazarus which we read in the scripture right so there were several people there but there was one singled out that recognized the presence of the Lord all these details can derail somebody but when we look at it what did you get out of the lesson out of the parable that he was teaching to me I got he who's forgiven much loves muchl to me I got your sins are forgiven to me I got she did a great work and if she did a great work I should pattern myself to do a great work right these are the things that we should be getting out of not concerned so much of all these details that we find out tend to line up it's not so much in disputing and arguing and competing with one another right because the scripture says blessed are your eyes that you could see we can't criticize others relationship if ours is wrecked yes Hallelujah that's scriptural by the way but not not those exact words you know the log and the and the Splinter you know how can you correct somebody when you got something going on in your own eye you're trying to pull out something small out of somebody else's and you got this big old huge thing in you and your eye take that thing out you know so and that's what we're getting at don't get caught up in so much of the details yeah it it's nice to to read through the scripture and see where things fit you know putting it together like a puzzle I understand that but when people are fighting bicker and backbiting one another because they don't see what you see or they think that you're wrong and but what what do we understand that to be I'd rather be right in my spirit and wrong in my Doctrine than vice versa right I don't want to be wrong in the spirit if I could be corrected I I want to let you know hey thank you for showing me that I'll look more into it and I'll pray about it I'm not right de flash I'm not right about everything I'm not always right and I hear Hawkins kids hey man sorry I shouldn't be joking I'm a human being none of us are right all the time so all these details all these arguments it's a distraction pull yourself away from those distractions and it's time to to refocus remember I preached that here I think focus on the right thing people's people's eyes when you're looking at one thing that's the that's what's in Focus but when you're looking at something Beyond this becomes blurry and that comes in focus when you're looking at this here what's in front of you that becomes in focus and everything else is blurry let us focus on the word and everything else is obscured amen hallelujah so when we have that concentration that we focus on him let let's stand to our feet this morning so but the the whole point is missed because of all these details that are distractions in the presence of the Lord is missed see when we're thinking about something else we don't recognize when the presence when the Lord is present with us and then we miss out on on things so so but not recognizing the presence of God when you are able to recognize the presence of God it and when you recognize that it it releases the power to heal and whatever you have need of it will release the power to open your eyes to recognize him oh or blind your eyes so you'll never recognize him what opens the eyes of one closes the eyes of the unbeliever amen just want to read this real quick he says I tell you friends just because that we are members of the church or something like that that doesn't mean too much to us you better buckle up that armor you better take that whole word of God and hold on to it and quit this Hollywood acting out here he's he's talking about saying saying that you're a Christian and not acting like a Christian you know you're putting on a front to people saying that you're one thing but you're a devil on the inside you that's that's pretty much what he's saying stop this Hollywood acting but get real get sincere be genuine amen so he's saying quit this Hollywood acting around here it's got right into the church and it's a shame and this was way back I I can't even remember what year it was but it was back in the 60s so that was a long time ago I wasn't alive then don't don't let the beard deceive you just because it's gray doesn't mean I was alive back then so he says' but Hollywood glares just makes a bright light and the church today is trying to compare with Hollywood the church is competing with Hollywood because why we have these charismatic preachers out there right and and I'm not saying anything against it some people need that some people like that but then it becomes that they don't want to hear somebody else because they're not as entertaining they're looking for the entertain tainment Factor well you've got to scream and shout you've got to run the aisles you've got to do this you've all these different things that uh people think these ministers are are are popular for now I'm not criticizing the ministers understand what I'm saying is that the level that they are people cling to certain personalities you can't cling to just because they they run and Shout what's the message that's coming across that's what we need to look at what what are we looking at for every person right we are looking at the Spirit behind it so don't get caught up into into these into these preachers and and they're good and they're good I'm like I said I'm not coming against the the preachers I'm saying that people hold on to that entertainment value and now it's a competition with Hollywood okay because you've got to meet it or beat it you understand what I mean is how ollywood they'll make a movie they they made action movies if if you go way back to Charlie Chapman I don't know if you know the name but there's no words it's just music and he's just doing silly stuff okay it's like slapick humor it doesn't make sense he just does things and people thought it was funny back then some people think it's funny now they're mainly laughing at black and white but uh but through the years they have uh developed uh what's a word that I'm looking for the graphics they developed these uh there's a word that I'm looking for if somebody knows it help me out you're welcome to blur it out but it's like the graphics uh when they do things like Steven Spielberg with uh Star Wars years ago that that was something with the with the effects yeah what yeah the the effects that they make and special effects that's that's the word I was looking for and they've just grown and learned how to do it better so what they do is all these action movies they've got to meet it the latest uh Hollywood box off his H you got to meet it to that to where people would and it's like all the same line you know I remember Rambo Commando and all those all those dumb movies they had like the same Baseline somebody uh they they get uh something happens they get kicked out somewhere and the whole Army against them and they they grab a gun and they grab a few people and they're the only ones you know they're blasting all these guns and and uh they're the only ones left alive you know they're the hero of the story and there are so many movies out there like that but it's how much gunfire is in it how much different effects are in it so you see what I mean I'm I'm I'm trying to give that comparison of Hollywood they try to meet that last movie and then they have to beat it for people to watch it because it's got to be better than the last last one and people get stuck in that rut of ministers because or the ministering of the word because they they have to have that charismatic they have to have that entertainment value preaching the word is not entertainment preaching the word is life and death so when he's comparing Hollywood this is this is something serious to me when he's making that comparison that's something serious so but what what he's saying is quit acting like them quit trying to be like Hollywood it doesn't matter the great building you have right it doesn't how much it doesn't matter how much money what what vehicle the pastor's driving he's driving out of necessity and because they got another one coming I always call that vehicle an apartment on Wheels this just a big boy there's a lot of room in there so you understand what I mean yes so he's saying it's it's got right to the church and it's a shame but Hollywood glares just makes a bright light and the church today is trying to compare with Hollywood Christ is not Hollywood Christ is in the individual praise the Lord Hollywood glares while the gospel glows with humility God isn't in these great fine fancy places and all this stuff that we see he comes in humility in the form of meekness and gentleness passed right through and if you are acquainted with the word then you'll see it but if you're not acquainted with the word it's just going to go right by you're not going to see it oh my that's about where is just want to ask you might not physically have an alabaster box but I'm just speaking metaphorically you know if you had an alabaster box what would be in it we read through the scriptures of what uh this this siner Mary had in her alabaster box that it was the finest ointment it was the the finest that she sacrificed everything she had so I want to ask you what do you bring I'm I'm not one to tailor messages for for holidays and things but we know Christmas is coming and people are thinking about gifts but I'm not worried about Christmas I'm worried about what gift you're going to bring the Lord what are you going to bring in that Alabaster Box what is it is it worldliness is it sincerity is it truth because he even spoke in his word that if we are coming to worship him that we must worship Him in spirit and in truth if if there's nothing genuine then we're not coming the right way in that I could say that you're worshiping wrong other than that you worship how the Lord lead you to worship how you feel in your heart that you do a good work unto the Lord so I just want to ask you know uh just kind of lay it out there that some people will say I've I I've heard the situation that uh if if if God doesn't I'm leaving it out there I need healing and if God doesn't heal me then I'm not going to serve the Lord anymore our walk with the Lord is not contingent on whether he heals us or not our relationship with him is I love him why because he first loved me praise the Lord Heavenly Father Lord if there's any that has a need if this message has struck somebody today just pray that you would be in their heart and their spirit and their soul that it would just give a press of what you want them to do oh Lord that they would give themselves over more to you if they were just halfway if they're weighing uh on the fence not sure which way to go Lord we just pray that you your spirit would just come and and make it real to them just come and and set that genuine love dove Spirit upon them oh father that they would surrender their life to you oh god father we think of Revival people say Revival is done and over with there are no more revivals but Lord we'd understand Revival to be a a Reviving of something that we already have there might not be a group Revival or or something uh but we've been taught that there's no organization Revival but Lord there is still an individual Revival and if there's somebody that has need of a Revival today an individual Revival with you I just pray that they would let themselves go that they would open that Alabaster Box and
