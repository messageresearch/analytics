[44:43] happy to be a Christian this morning a
[44:45] man serving the Lord despite all your
[44:49] battles everything that looks negative
[44:52] God called you to this message your thee
[44:56] this group of people is the only one in
[45:00] the world that understands what's going
[45:01] on the only one that has the truth of
[45:05] all truths science can't compare
[45:09] psychology can't compare in a lecture or
[45:12] anything cannot compare with this truth
[45:15] anything you need to know that's very
[45:17] truth of it is in the Word of God that's
[45:21] just that's just what it is that's the
[45:24] laughs that's when you stand this
[45:26] morning all the rock of Revelation the
[45:29] very truth the very mind of God you've
[45:32] captured he sent it to you specifically
[45:36] hand-delivered it to you by a prophet of
[45:39] God and he's went off the scene he's as
[45:41] my duty is God I've preached I preached
[45:43] I taught I've taught I feel that I've
[45:45] yielded now it's up to you what will you
[45:49] do with it now we must live it we must
[45:55] live it that's what we're to do so I you
[46:00] may have your seat so Jessica want me to
[46:02] give you a little report here of
[46:03] Thailand we had very very good meetings
[46:07] this time I did actually brought an
[46:11] entire PowerPoint presentation and I
[46:13] showed it to the children last night and
[46:14] let them know what we all did and what
[46:18] God did over there we went over there by
[46:19] faith we had two meetings lined up that
[46:21] was it in two weeks and brother Ron down
[46:23] very very gifted brother as far as
[46:25] Facebook and the Asian computer thing
[46:32] called line instead of what's happens
[46:35] there's line and he communicated on
[46:37] their with Google Translate and he was
[46:40] able to meet we we sewed every day
[46:43] except one day we got online made we
[46:46] made contacts with Bible studies did
[46:48] Google Translate back and forth taught
[46:50] on baptism all these things very good
[46:52] we've got all kinds of invitations come
[46:55] back the trip in December we ran into a
[46:59] interpreter that didn't like us so well
[47:01] well sure enough we ran into him again
[47:03] and I just dropped the old original sin
[47:06] service he'd bomb and he just absolutely
[47:08] loved it he said brother Simon this is
[47:10] the first Bible say something and so we
[47:17] made many context with many translators
[47:19] two or three really solid ones and they
[47:23] really liked our teaching we taught them
[47:25] something new you know and that's what
[47:26] you and I'm just kind of I'm seeing that
[47:29] you just go there and teach things that
[47:30] may be blessing to us it doesn't move
[47:33] them it's almost like and you hate to do
[47:35] that but almost bring like something new
[47:37] to the table something they never heard
[47:39] something fresh that'll actually shock
[47:43] them maybe put them make them think that
[47:45] maybe maybe I don't know at all you know
[47:46] maybe this or that you know and we did
[47:50] very good by the grace of God he below
[47:53] really blessed us and but then I we got
[47:56] wind that there's a lot of different
[48:01] beliefs in the message there's a lot of
[48:02] different factions and sects and
[48:08] divisions in the message and but of
[48:11] course but Ron's watching Facebook very
[48:13] carefully on what's going on over there
[48:15] and we noticed that somehow people are
[48:18] getting a hold of our contacts that we
[48:22] made this last trip invited them to
[48:23] their services and and from what I've
[48:27] heard this the certain brother or
[48:29] brother is there they teach things a
[48:31] little bit different they do not believe
[48:33] the Malachi 4 7 is brother Branham
[48:36] you know I'm sorry your 10 seven
[48:37] revelations revelations 10 7 is not
[48:39] brother branham they don't believe that
[48:41] they don't believe in using a church age
[48:44] book at all there's other many many
[48:47] differences he's kind of made a name for
[48:50] himself by a certain quote and the
[48:53] message which the Prophet never
[48:55] interpreted so learning to battle these
[49:00] things and have just been praying as the
[49:01] Lord you put this in order you put this
[49:04] man in his place and I'm not saying you
[49:07] know hell or anything yet but Lord
[49:08] straighten him up to know as my brother
[49:10] Sam would say when he'd get angry he
[49:12] said Simon I tuned him up the Lord you
[49:16] tune them up you turn us all up you know
[49:18] get us all on the right harmony of the
[49:21] Lord Jesus Christ we've been there now a
[49:25] fire that was our fifth trip there for
[49:27] me was not as taxing as the last last
[49:31] trip just about slew me but we had
[49:35] really good really good and went really
[49:37] good we made tribal people I got to
[49:39] witness to them
[49:41] and then the last trip was in Phuket and
[49:44] a very very beautiful area very gorgeous
[49:47] area tropical area and I went in there
[49:51] and I taught on Mount Transfiguration
[49:54] and the pastor went up and said he said
[49:57] he said Church did not I just preached
[49:59] three weeks ago on Moses and Elijah
[50:00] being the two prophets in revelations 11
[50:04] he said but I didn't know there was
[50:05] another Elijah to come and then that
[50:08] night we were able to share with him
[50:09] William Branham left him everything we
[50:13] could with the messages and I and I left
[50:17] it in his hands after service I called
[50:20] the pastor up I said no church this is
[50:22] your pastor I'm not your pastor I don't
[50:23] the answer for your souls I have to
[50:25] answer to what I'm teaching you but if
[50:26] your souls he has to answer for them and
[50:28] now we've showed you the things hidden
[50:32] in the Bible some things hidden mightily
[50:34] in there and then now he has you better
[50:37] you better pray it over you know make
[50:38] sure so and I did it real reverently let
[50:42] him know I'm not here I told him I'm not
[50:43] here to take your church over I'm not
[50:45] here to do this or that I'm just here
[50:48] because I am just a teacher showing
[50:50] a little bit deeper revelation in the
[50:52] word that's all I'm here to do there is
[50:54] no motive to get into be anything over
[50:56] here so I'm just here to show the Word
[50:59] of God and to bring them what was
[51:02] brought to us so I want really well I
[51:04] would thank you for your prayers and
[51:06] your support and the sister Wendy my
[51:11] offer still stands
[51:13] it's the sister Wendy ever wants to go
[51:15] to Hong Kong and and deal with your
[51:18] people I'd be more than happy to go a
[51:20] few interpret so if you could say it's
[51:24] pray for sister Wendy that God would
[51:26] lead her in the correct way it is in a
[51:28] late hour this late hour and it's an
[51:31] extreme sacrifice you're probably like
[51:33] brother saying why did you say that well
[51:35] we all gotta lay down pray and fast on
[51:42] it brother Jose I'm sure you'd be more
[51:44] than willing to go to wherever you you
[51:45] came from and you speaking Spanish
[51:48] pretty well and if you really if you
[51:51] feel the leading man we got to go it's
[51:54] late our saints of God I buy the last
[51:55] couple months I've been like woo and
[51:57] it's like feel like any moment the
[51:58] rapture could happen I'm like in Lourdes

[52:01] believe I'm right believed your word I
[52:03] believe I received The Bachelor the Holy
[52:04] Ghost I believe this and this but Lord

[52:07] heart I don't know just a real burden
[52:09] lately and it goes I goes and brother
[52:12] Jesse you say you've been preaching on
[52:13] cycles and it comes and goes you know
[52:15] some days I think I might be a couple
[52:16] years of stem and then recently it's

[52:29] be back I don't know how to fight
[52:33] someone incoming rain right behind you

[52:38] different angle and I and I will say
[52:40] this I'm trusting the Lord one thing

[52:48] things I've heard some nuggets I'm going

[54:33] only got so much vacation time and he's
[54:35] only got seven days left so he's brother
[54:36] I don't know if I can go another use
[54:37] this year I'm like well so the Lord
[54:40] leads you know when this woman take off
[54:41] any time Lord allows so we'll go
[54:43] whenever so if we could go to
[54:46] revelations three and 15 I've been I got
[54:56] wounded a long time ago probably bout
[54:58] four or five years ago I got wounded
[54:59] real heavy something was says things
[55:02] were done and then just absolutely it's
[55:07] Lumi it really left a scar I bled and
[55:11] bled in my heart and I would it would
[55:15] scab over then reopen and it was it took
[55:19] a long time and I and I was listening to
[55:22] a couple services that the Lord I
[55:23] believe sent to me and it completely
[55:26] cured me healed me a complete healing of
[55:31] it and but through that circumstance
[55:35] that trial I went through it was it was
[55:38] and one thing I heard on these sermons
[55:40] is there's a difference between killing
[55:42] somebody at war and then killing
[55:45] somebody at peace and what took place
[55:48] was a time at peace for me and it was
[55:51] supposed to be a time of peace and I got
[55:55] wounded in a time of peace and but
[56:00] through that experience the Lord has
[56:03] opened up the deeds of Nicolaitans to me
[56:05] like I've never seen it and and I and
[56:09] I'm on the hunt for the Antichrist
[56:11] spirit the last five years I have the
[56:14] Lord has fully dealt with me on the
[56:15] Antichrist spirit hunting hunting it
[56:19] down looking at every angle I'm on the
[56:22] trail I want to be on that trail I want
[56:25] a hunt I want to as the Prophet was
[56:27] gonna preach the trail of serpent I want
[56:30] to I'm on that trail on the hunt I want
[56:33] to identify the spirit I want to know
[56:35] everything I can about it I went to a
[56:38] discern it really discern it you know
[56:44] and that's uh that's kind of where I'm
[56:46] at and then the a couple months ago only
[56:48] a month ago brother cam want me to
[56:49] preach I had nothing and then the Lord
[56:52] opened this up to me he was on the way
[56:54] to church so I wanted to share this with
[56:57] you I got to service and I tried to put
[56:59] it together and the devil might computer
[57:00] when he hardly worked back there so I
[57:02] know it was a battle Satan did not like
[57:05] this so anyhow revelations 3 and 15
[57:09] notice what God says he says I know thy
[57:14] works and for you young people
[57:18] my precious nephews and nephew and niece
[57:20] is here as you grow up into Christianity
[57:23] and you know I believe you all been
[57:25] baptized I think in serving God with all
[57:28] your hearts
[57:29] you don't know what you guys just do to
[57:31] me when I come and see you and I see you
[57:34] growing up and you're gonna have to go
[57:38] into these battles and you're gonna see
[57:39] hard times you're gonna see tough time
[57:41] you're gonna see life but they're Jose
[57:42] life is tough they earn just Wendy amen
[57:46] life is tough and you're gonna want to
[57:50] everything your dad and mom has lived
[57:53] before you you're gonna want to store
[57:54] all these things in your heart you're
[57:57] gonna have you're gonna want to keep
[57:58] these things dear to you never let your
[58:01] guard down spiritually love with all you
[58:05] got give everything you got give your
[58:09] life away and do your absolute best but
[58:15] here in Revelations 3 it says I know thy
[58:17] works notice Christ is dealing with your
[58:20] works that thou art neither cold nor hot
[58:24] I would thou wert cold or hot let's go
[58:31] now to 1st Corinthians 11 this is a I'd
[58:40] say this is a communion style here
[58:43] opening here I don't think believe this
[58:45] is communion today brother Jess I don't
[58:46] believe so but I want to read this first
[58:50] Corinthian 1120 when you come together
[58:52] therefore into one place this is not to
[58:54] eat the Lord's Supper in eating everyone
[58:58] taketh before another his own supper and
[59:01] one is hungry another is drunken what
[59:03] have we not houses to eat and a drinkin
[59:05] or despise ye the Church of God and and
[59:08] shame that have not what shall I say
[59:10] into you
[59:11] shall I prayer craziness the craziness
[59:13] Eve dat the Lord that which also I
[59:16] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[59:17] the same night in which he was betrayed
[59:19] took bread and when he given thanks he
[59:21] brake it and said take eat this is my
[59:23] body which is broken for you this do and
[59:25] remembrance of me after the same manner
[59:28] also he took the cup he says when he had
[59:30] supped saying this cup is there the New
[59:33] Testament my blood you do that uh this
[59:35] do ye as often he drinking reverence me
[59:38] for his off you eat this bread and drink
[59:39] this cup you sure the Lords of death
[59:41] till he come right
[59:43] in verse 27 wherefore whosoever shall
[59:46] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[59:50] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[59:52] body and blood of Lord and then here in
[59:55] verse 28 says but let a man examine
[59:57] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[1:00:02] and drink of that Cup for he that eateth
[1:00:05] and drinketh unworthily eateth and
[1:00:07] drinketh damnation to himself not
[1:00:09] discerning the Lord's body for this
[1:00:13] cause many are weak and sickly among you
[1:00:15] and many sleep let's say a word of
[1:00:17] Prayer approach the throne of grace and
[1:00:21] mercy dear Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we

[1:01:25] amen
[1:01:26] you may have your seats kind of a broken
[1:01:33] heart of their Jewish I would've got to
[1:01:35] see sister Connie I heard she's back in
[1:01:36] action and she's a precious lawyer and
[1:01:40] we appreciate all this this church here
[1:01:42] and thanks of God don't ever get down by
[1:01:45] quantity quality's everything
[1:01:51] if you can just get a handful of
[1:01:54] warriors that are set aside to the word
[1:01:58] of word of god alone that's all you need
[1:02:00] you put God than the myths just a one
[1:02:03] man and look what God can do
[1:02:05] God said one man a prophet in our age
[1:02:08] one man set one man full of the Holy
[1:02:12] Ghost and fully yielded and where are we
[1:02:16] today hundreds and hundreds of message
[1:02:19] searches around the world are all
[1:02:21] staying pure to it no but there are
[1:02:22] message churches they are doing their
[1:02:24] best according to their revelation and
[1:02:27] cording to their understanding so today
[1:02:32] I'd like to teach on examining yourself
[1:02:39] I'd like to say this this little quote
[1:02:42] here honoring this quote here and the
[1:02:44] prophets pre Keys bringing it in
[1:02:45] discerning the body of the Lord he says
[1:02:47] he said there they are he says these
[1:02:49] women he's bobbing off their hair the
[1:02:51] Bible says a woman that cuts her hair he
[1:02:53] says her husband has a right to divorce
[1:02:55] her he says he's because she's untrue he
[1:02:58] said that she dishonours her head is
[1:03:00] that right he says a no man is the head
[1:03:02] of the woman I know that's rough pieces
[1:03:05] but we need discernment saints of God
[1:03:08] not only just discernment out and what
[1:03:11] you see from their B's about within our
[1:03:13] own selves so we want to be able to
[1:03:16] sermon tis not a natural thing the true
[1:03:21] discernment comes from the Holy Ghost it
[1:03:26] comes from the Holy Ghost teaching you
[1:03:28] his word yeah you must read the Word of
[1:03:31] God you must study this message because
[1:03:33] in this message then this word of God
[1:03:36] that was this interpretation gives you
[1:03:38] all that you need in this day if God
[1:03:43] wouldn't give you if he needed you to
[1:03:45] know anything else he would have sent
[1:03:46] another message you would have sent
[1:03:48] another messenger you would have sent
[1:03:50] something else but notice he sent this
[1:03:53] brother brother Branham and this is the
[1:03:55] revelation he caught these are the
[1:03:58] things that God showed him these are the
[1:04:00] things that God anointed him to see any
[1:04:02] stood forth so what does that tell you
[1:04:05] if it was good enough for the seventh
[1:04:06] angel is good enough for what the bride
[1:04:09] in the seventh day he meant absolutely
[1:04:13] he says we need to discern up biases by
[1:04:16] the word he says the word is right takes
[1:04:20] the Word of God he says God's Word is
[1:04:23] always white right he says he says we
[1:04:25] can't discern by what people think don't
[1:04:29] lean on man's like this interpretation
[1:04:33] or his revelation unless it lines right
[1:04:35] up with the word and you all here are
[1:04:37] trusting in your pastors revelation and
[1:04:40] he catches from God that is right and we
[1:04:41] believe those things that's how that's
[1:04:42] the correct order he says he says we
[1:04:45] can't discern by what people think when
[1:04:47] intellectuals tell us he's what
[1:04:48] psychiatrists tell us we've got to go by
[1:04:51] what God says man shall not live by
[1:04:53] bread alone but by every word that
[1:04:56] proceedeth out of the mouth of God amen
[1:04:58] amen so we're gonna teach on that
[1:05:02] tonight as well dealing with that little
[1:05:05] study we had on last Wednesday he says
[1:05:08] he says now he goes brother the Prophet
[1:05:10] goes he's not discerning Lord's body
[1:05:12] he's as many are weakly and sick many
[1:05:14] are asleep dead spiritually dead in the
[1:05:18] churches they can't raise their hands
[1:05:20] and worship God they can't run through
[1:05:23] the aisles they can't do these things
[1:05:24] and then just say Amen or praise the
[1:05:26] Lord he said they're spiritually dead
[1:05:28] even though intellectually they're right
[1:05:30] in line they know the course they can
[1:05:34] probably quote him and memorize him
[1:05:35] better than you or all these things he
[1:05:37] says he says but they are spiritually
[1:05:39] dead he says he says remember the last
[1:05:41] plague that hit Egypt was death the last
[1:05:44] plague that hits the church the last
[1:05:46] plague that hits the church is spiritual
[1:05:49] death god help us what we need today is
[1:05:54] a spiritual awakening a spiritual
[1:05:58] awakening to discernment saints of God
[1:06:01] if if this is the age the promise said
[1:06:05] what the Bible said in Matthew 24:24 if
[1:06:07] this he says it'll be so close to
[1:06:10] discern the very elected is that
[1:06:13] supposed to take place in this day or is
[1:06:15] that the next thing
[1:06:16] there is no other age this is the last
[1:06:18] age so if there is a discernment we need
[1:06:21] it's in this we're sitting at a certain
[1:06:27] restaurant one day and a brother came
[1:06:28] and brought in evangelist and the man
[1:06:30] just is like he's sitting there he is
[1:06:32] he's a Baconator or whatever is eating a
[1:06:35] double and he said and he's in his area
[1:06:37] czz it's kind of talking with us there
[1:06:39] and he's like he's like guys over and he
[1:06:42] was stressing the the deception of maybe
[1:06:45] jeffersonville you know and saying those
[1:06:47] things and and i looked at him with
[1:06:49] puzzled eyes I said brother is that
[1:06:52] gonna deceive you is that is that gonna
[1:06:57] deceive you bro is that is that is that
[1:06:58] stressing you is that is that
[1:06:59] challenging your faith and he went like
[1:07:03] this I said brother it's gonna be a lot
[1:07:06] closer than that he said oh I see what
[1:07:10] you're saying and I said my goodness
[1:07:13] come on man mercy wake up this is you'll
[1:07:18] see by the end what I'm talking about he
[1:07:20] says he says the last plague is
[1:07:22] spiritual death we need a spiritual
[1:07:24] awakening to discernment he says he says
[1:07:26] these might people have done this he's
[1:07:28] always good intentions remember good
[1:07:33] intentions pave the way to the hell as
[1:07:35] well good intentions must be weighed
[1:07:38] discernment and I since the fire had
[1:07:41] good it looked like they had very good
[1:07:43] intentions amen and the Prophet went on
[1:07:47] to talk about how the doctor gave a
[1:07:49] certain serum to a man and the man died
[1:07:52] he said he said if he though he had good
[1:07:54] intentions they healed a man if he
[1:07:56] woulda had better discernment on his
[1:07:58] medicine that man when it died
[1:08:00] absolutely sure but now notice here I
[1:08:03] want to go to Galatians 1 in 6 and I
[1:08:07] want to bring this forth I don't want to
[1:08:10] keep it too we got two services but I
[1:08:12] want to go now we're at about 23 here 23
[1:08:14] minutes in Galatians 1 is 6
[1:08:16] notice for st. Paul this is in 60 ad
[1:08:20] supposedly in history 60 80 this is
[1:08:22] after what the start this is at the
[1:08:25] church had fallen she'd fallen from
[1:08:27] grace
[1:08:27] all from them pure 20 years from 33 AD
[1:08:30] 253 AD which is the pure a God was fully
[1:08:34] leaning and in the church was alive and
[1:08:36] firing is what we're coming back to
[1:08:39] after she had fallen by one of the
[1:08:41] Antichrist spirits and 53 ad goes into
[1:08:44] now the first church age we see now Paul
[1:08:47] picking up a text here in Galatians and
[1:08:49] in Galatians 1 he says I marvel that ye
[1:08:51] are so soon removed from him that called
[1:08:54] you into the grace of Christ unto
[1:08:56] another gospel he says which is not
[1:08:59] another reason but there be some that
[1:09:01] trouble you and pervert the gospel of
[1:09:03] Christ what is he talking about what is
[1:09:06] he dealing with there must be something
[1:09:08] here he says but though we or an angel
[1:09:10] from heaven preach I know these are very
[1:09:11] common scriptures we use these things to
[1:09:15] teach God and we use the scripture to
[1:09:17] teach our baptism why because it draws
[1:09:19] the line absolutely in other words you
[1:09:21] can't say anything appreciating
[1:09:23] consarned what Paul preached he says
[1:09:25] which is not another but their son that
[1:09:27] trouble you preserve the Gosling's but
[1:09:28] though we or an angel from heaven preach
[1:09:29] any other gospel unto you than that
[1:09:31] which we have preached let him be
[1:09:33] accursed Emsley so we must stay with the
[1:09:35] Word of God amen
[1:09:37] let's write a must line line upon line
[1:09:39] here and there a little bit a precept
[1:09:42] upon precept all those things in
[1:09:44] Vanilla's back to the word keep it pure
[1:09:47] keep it as simple as you can if you can
[1:09:50] teach the deep things simply teach you
[1:09:52] mana but if you if you can teach the
[1:09:54] deep things simply stay away from a
[1:09:56] demon he says as we said before so now I
[1:10:00] say again if any man preach any other
[1:10:02] gospel to you that we should appreciate
[1:10:05] he says so these people and Galatians in
[1:10:07] Galatians from Galatia he says he said
[1:10:10] they were removed from the gospel the
[1:10:13] true gospel already right he says but I
[1:10:19] certify you brethren that the gospel
[1:10:20] which was preached after me Nancy Paul
[1:10:23] says he says he says why did you leave
[1:10:25] it he says the original teaching the
[1:10:27] original services he's the original
[1:10:29] interpretation of the Word of God that
[1:10:31] God gave me this was not after me he
[1:10:35] said it was by revelation
[1:10:37] Amen he says for I received it neither
[1:10:39] of man he never
[1:10:40] what remember his testimony he said this
[1:10:42] did not come from Peter when I received
[1:10:44] the bathrooms of the ghost and was
[1:10:45] baptized called by God on the way to
[1:10:49] Damascus he said I did not confer with
[1:10:51] flesh and blood he says he says but I
[1:10:53] wish I I hadn't gone to Arabia for three
[1:10:56] years and received the direct revelation
[1:10:59] of the word of God being a prophet amen
[1:11:02] and he caught the word and he wrote
[1:11:04] these marvelous interpretations amen
[1:11:07] he said linen verse 16 says to reveal
[1:11:10] his son in me they could see who he was
[1:11:13] so close to Christ that people said he
[1:11:16] said they would a game and they put out
[1:11:17] his own eyes and gave them to him they
[1:11:19] treated him as what even Christ himself
[1:11:21] as the angel of God a man what a
[1:11:25] testimony he says neither went out to
[1:11:29] Jerusalem them he said then he three
[1:11:30] years he was and then after those three
[1:11:32] years he went into with the desert place
[1:11:34] into Arabia and verse 18 he says then I
[1:11:37] went to Jerusalem to CPN as the prophesy
[1:11:40] teases him and Peter came together and
[1:11:43] their doctor lined up perfectly at
[1:11:44] dovetailed right absolutely
[1:11:46] he said they knew the words we must have
[1:11:48] the same mind the same judgment on
[1:11:50] doctrine circumstances situations those
[1:11:53] kinds of things a man we must all have
[1:11:55] the same thing if a certain situation
[1:11:57] came up to the church and the Bible says
[1:11:59] maybe bring somebody up and brother
[1:12:01] Jesse says brother Aaron what do you
[1:12:02] think we ought to do here we're the
[1:12:04] Aaron's discernment for the amens
[1:12:08] determined for the Jose's discernment
[1:12:09] the way you would handle the situation
[1:12:12] we should be the same way brother Jesse
[1:12:14] when you look the way they see that they
[1:12:17] examine a certain maybe an argument
[1:12:20] between two people or in a couple or
[1:12:22] whatever and brother Aaron should say
[1:12:24] well according to scripture this this
[1:12:26] this is this for the Jose he would say
[1:12:28] well according to Scripture this is this
[1:12:30] for the Jesse said that's exactly what I
[1:12:32] was going to seat you see even though
[1:12:34] they may not be si o or yet called went
[1:12:37] to the ministry or not ministers or
[1:12:38] whatever their judgment must be the same
[1:12:41] it should be exactly the way they handle
[1:12:44] things should be exactly the same or
[1:12:46] very close he meant though different
[1:12:48] vessels the same spirit the same
[1:12:50] revelation the same you can actually
[1:12:52] have this
[1:12:53] I talked to a pastor the other day he
[1:12:55] called me and I asked him about that
[1:12:57] situation of Thailand he says I said
[1:12:59] brother how why do they get off he says
[1:13:01] they know the message right here
[1:13:03] but they don't really understand it when
[1:13:09] they teach that Malik four or five and
[1:13:11] six is not revelations ten seven how do
[1:13:15] you get that there is there is I did a
[1:13:18] probably a 15 minute study when I found
[1:13:20] it because I had I got hot when I heard
[1:13:22] this ice house man I was like let's go
[1:13:26] and see what the message says within
[1:13:28] within just the seals he said that three
[1:13:31] times Malachi 4 5 & 6 is revelation said
[1:13:33] 7 he says it specifically then after the
[1:13:37] seals in questions and answers the
[1:13:39] question is brother Branham is Malachi
[1:13:41] four or five and six revelations ten
[1:13:42] seven he said yes a direct quote yes
[1:13:49] what message are they reading what
[1:13:54] message are they studying how can I an
[1:13:58] absolute tiniest of all tiny teachers
[1:14:03] find this out in five minutes either
[1:14:09] they're doing this deliberately or they
[1:14:13] are in total ignorance or they really
[1:14:16] don't understand the prophecy the trishy
[1:14:18] book he says he says it's a shame that
[1:14:19] many ministers do not learn to say just
[1:14:22] what the Prophet says and to stick just
[1:14:24] with what the Word of God says amen
[1:14:29] so here is Paul he's coming his diseases
[1:14:32] I went up he says in Galatians 2 now in
[1:14:34] Galatia still doing with the Galatians
[1:14:36] he glazes 2 he says I went up by
[1:14:37] revelation notice he says these
[1:14:39] Galatians are fallen
[1:14:40] he's a communicating of them that gospel
[1:14:43] I preached unto the Gentiles but
[1:14:44] privately to them that a were a
[1:14:46] reputation lest by any means I should
[1:14:48] run and head or run in vain and then as
[1:14:52] he's there he's dealing with he's he
[1:14:54] says but neither Titus who was with me
[1:14:56] being a greek or is compelled to be
[1:14:58] circumcised and that because of false
[1:15:01] brethren unawares brought in who came in
[1:15:04] privily to spy out our Liberty
[1:15:06] we have in Christ Jesus that they might
[1:15:08] bring us into bondage
[1:15:11] so these Galatians have been watts now
[1:15:14] Paul is dealing with a fallen to bondage
[1:15:17] they've been taken they went off the
[1:15:19] beaten path or into the beaten path and
[1:15:21] they've not stayed true with the word of
[1:15:23] God to whom we gave space by a or placed
[1:15:30] by subjection
[1:15:31] no not for an hour should even deal with
[1:15:34] these people for a night not even now or
[1:15:36] you ain't give a chance even no no this
[1:15:38] is not the Word of God you're not called
[1:15:42] that the truth the gossamer continue
[1:15:44] with you
[1:15:46] now look here in number a chapter
[1:15:49] chapter two verse 11 and notice even
[1:15:53] Paul Peter at this time had now fallen
[1:15:56] even after now the church has fallen now
[1:15:58] the ministers are starting to fall in
[1:16:00] there I say in there a character in
[1:16:06] there in their ways that they are
[1:16:08] conducting themselves in front of the
[1:16:10] church pieces but when Peter was come to
[1:16:13] answer I got Antioch Antioch Jesus Iowa
[1:16:15] stood into the face because he was to
[1:16:17] blame for before that certain came to
[1:16:20] James he did eat with the Gentiles
[1:16:22] notice what he would eat with the
[1:16:24] Gentiles but as soon as the old group
[1:16:26] the old Jews come in what he he said
[1:16:28] well he's well now he's I better stick
[1:16:30] with my old but he says instead of the
[1:16:31] new guys and what he dissimulated from
[1:16:34] them he says but when they were come he
[1:16:36] withdrew and separated himself fearing
[1:16:39] them which were of the circumcision oh
[1:16:40] my know destroy did not draw the Girt in
[1:16:45] a circle bigger he was dealing with he
[1:16:48] started his own groups he says he says
[1:16:51] and James did the same thing and the
[1:16:53] other Jews dissembled likewise with him
[1:16:55] insomuch that Barnabas was also carried
[1:16:57] away in his notice all Holy Ghost filled
[1:17:00] men carried away with this idea carried
[1:17:05] away with this action carried away with
[1:17:07] the Antichrist spirit because that would
[1:17:11] be Nicolay attend ISM that is a indeed
[1:17:14] notice there's no snowfall staggering
[1:17:16] went out just by deed just by movement
[1:17:19] just by action they
[1:17:20] parade themselves pieces bought and sold
[1:17:24] they won't not operate according to the
[1:17:27] truth of the gospel I senator Peter
[1:17:29] before them or if thou being a jew
[1:17:31] delivers at the mention of gentiles and
[1:17:33] do not add the jews why compels style
[1:17:35] the gentiles to live also live as do the
[1:17:38] jews to live as do the jews my so he's
[1:17:41] rebuked him right he says in verse 15 we
[1:17:44] who are jews by nature not sinners of
[1:17:47] the sinners of the gentiles knowing that
[1:17:49] a man is not justified by works of the
[1:17:55] law why would the jews separate
[1:17:58] themselves with Gentiles because the
[1:17:59] Gentiles were not circumcised which was
[1:18:02] what came from the Old Testament that
[1:18:05] was a shadow that was not the real it
[1:18:08] was a shadow and they're living in the
[1:18:10] law the shadow the law right there is
[1:18:12] that we might be justified by the faith
[1:18:14] of Christ and not by the works of the
[1:18:16] law for by the works of the law shall no
[1:18:19] flesh be justified no matter what you do
[1:18:22] you're not justified we are justified by
[1:18:26] faith in Jesus Christ amen
[1:18:28] that is it I do not frustrate the grace
[1:18:33] of God sister Wendy right he would have
[1:18:36] grace of God why is the grace of God
[1:18:38] followed you all these years because
[1:18:40] something you've done
[1:18:42] no you believe it you have faith
[1:18:45] something inside of you call this God
[1:18:48] gave you faith to believe this word why
[1:18:52] do I believe it I know he gave me their
[1:18:54] faith I believe it and I'm trying to
[1:18:56] live it I'm trying to Oh bad I'm doing
[1:18:59] my very best learning this sinful for my
[1:19:02] yes that's exactly the that's what God's
[1:19:05] looking at is their faith in His Word
[1:19:09] Abraham fell and fell and fell but they
[1:19:12] sent by his faith in His Word became the
[1:19:15] righteousness of God because he believed
[1:19:18] God's Word God imputed it for him as
[1:19:20] righteousness amen that was it not his
[1:19:24] works
[1:19:25] I do not frustrate the grace of God for
[1:19:29] righteous came by the law then Christ is
[1:19:31] dead
[1:19:32] in vain and notice what he calls it here
[1:19:37] in Galatians 3 104 she's still dealing
[1:19:40] with that same church the same group of
[1:19:42] foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you
[1:19:46] yes we're dealing with witchcraft is
[1:19:51] witchcraft always the people in the dark
[1:19:53] with the circle or the the chalk circle
[1:19:55] and this the little pentagram in the
[1:19:57] center they're sitting around with
[1:19:58] candles and is that pure witchcraft that
[1:20:00] is not pure witchcraft because in
[1:20:04] witchcraft deals with the spiritual
[1:20:05] realm and were Satan is a religious
[1:20:09] person he's a religious being he knows
[1:20:13] the Word of God the highest form and I
[1:20:17] heard about a priestess a highest form
[1:20:19] of witchcraft is right in the church is
[1:20:21] right in the message of the hour I say
[1:20:23] like that and you'll see by the end of
[1:20:27] this who has bewitched you
[1:20:29] what is this bewitching this witchcraft
[1:20:32] that ye should not obey the truth before
[1:20:36] whose eyes Jesus Christ has been
[1:20:37] evidently set forth crucified among you
[1:20:39] this only would I learn of you receiving
[1:20:42] the spirit by the works of the law or by
[1:20:45] the hearing of faith he's saying just
[1:20:51] simply trusting in any of your own
[1:20:55] merits
[1:20:56] well let's say well I I do get to teach
[1:21:01] it by the Jesse's church by the Kam's
[1:21:03] Church well God surely he's gonna let me
[1:21:07] into heaven no that has nothing to do
[1:21:11] with it
[1:21:11] these are just little sacrifices we can
[1:21:15] make these are just little DS and humble
[1:21:19] so humble of a little tiny
[1:21:21] I mean micro sacrifices compared to what
[1:21:23] Christ did for us these are light
[1:21:26] afflictions spiritual sacrifices we make
[1:21:29] for our King and we love him for it but
[1:21:34] we can never count anything we've done
[1:21:36] nothing I don't care how great a
[1:21:39] ministry may be it doesn't mean anything
[1:21:42] do they still just are they trusting in
[1:21:44] their ministry and my
[1:21:45] trusting in the good works that I try to
[1:21:47] do for others now we're supposed to do
[1:21:50] good works correct Paul said show me a
[1:21:54] UH your works without your faith and
[1:21:56] I'll show you my work by my faith right
[1:21:58] so we supposed to have works but we
[1:22:00] never put our trust in our words we do
[1:22:05] them out of love I love the Lord so much
[1:22:08] I want to serve my brother I wanna serve
[1:22:10] my sister I want to serve my nephews and
[1:22:12] nieces our precious brothers sisters I
[1:22:14] do those because I love Jesus say man
[1:22:16] that's it I want to represent the King
[1:22:19] Jesus did it for us
[1:22:20] let's do it for each other amen and by
[1:22:23] serving each other we serve God a month
[1:22:27] absolutely it's that simple but long as
[1:22:30] he calls this witchcraft are you so
[1:22:34] foolish having begun in the spirit are
[1:22:36] ye now made perfect in the flesh receive
[1:22:40] the works law or by the hearing of faith
[1:22:42] he's you have you suffered so many
[1:22:45] things in vain and if it yet had been in
[1:22:47] vain he therefore the ministrant you
[1:22:48] into the spirit and worketh miracles
[1:22:50] among you do with him by the works of
[1:22:53] the law or by the hearing of faith
[1:22:55] everything is by faith you have faith in
[1:23:00] the word things will operate anything
[1:23:04] you need done that's within the confines
[1:23:07] of the Word of God if you have faith and
[1:23:10] speak it it'll take place amen we're
[1:23:16] teaching on that tonight notice in
[1:23:18] Galatians 4 8 how be it he says when you
[1:23:20] knew not God neither was servicing them
[1:23:22] by which by nature are no gods but now
[1:23:25] after they had known God or rather are
[1:23:26] known of God how turn you again to the
[1:23:29] weak and beggarly elements some of the
[1:23:33] lowest things God would see these as
[1:23:35] even though they're great things in the
[1:23:36] eyes of God as far as righteousness
[1:23:39] as far as justification has nothing to
[1:23:41] do with these works have nothing do with
[1:23:43] the salvation where until you're again
[1:23:46] the you desire again to be into bondage
[1:23:49] under a law I have to do this I had to
[1:23:51] do that and by doing this I'm going up
[1:23:54] and by doing this I'm making the rapture
[1:23:55] by doing this - no no it is by grace and
[1:23:59] faith of God that's it it is not Christ
[1:24:03] in what I can do
[1:24:06] it is not Christ and what I can remember
[1:24:09] it is not Christ and what I can imagine
[1:24:11] and that it's not Christ and it is
[1:24:14] Christ alone it is the blood and spirit
[1:24:17] of Jesus Christ and that and that alone
[1:24:19] is what we trust in daily hey man that's
[1:24:23] right there is nothing it is not Christ
[1:24:26] plus there is no Christ this and plus
[1:24:29] that and extra arrows like when they run
[1:24:31] a bill through the house or senate they
[1:24:33] always had these little things called
[1:24:34] earmarks or whatever then they did they
[1:24:36] have this perfect bill set up and they
[1:24:38] does this but then as it's going through
[1:24:39] this House or Senate they throw these
[1:24:41] little earmarks on it boom boom boom or
[1:24:43] writers they calm or whatever and then
[1:24:44] all these extra things go through and
[1:24:46] then once that bills passed then all
[1:24:49] these other ones are - I start I was
[1:24:52] supposed to go that's called being
[1:24:54] sneaky oh not well with Christ he said
[1:24:59] he wants to see himself he was the only
[1:25:02] righteous soul perfect one there was and
[1:25:05] he wants to see his life and his blood
[1:25:07] in you that's it amen now to continue on
[1:25:15] here now notice is also going in
[1:25:18] Galatians 4 21 tell me ye the desire to
[1:25:20] be under the law do you do ye not hear
[1:25:23] the law now notice only a prophet of God
[1:25:26] could break this down like this for
[1:25:27] Anna's written that Abraham had two sons
[1:25:30] one by a bondmaid the other by a
[1:25:32] freewoman he brings these two women
[1:25:34] these two sons and BRE said there Ashley
[1:25:37] types for he who was of the bondwoman
[1:25:40] was born after the flesh he says but the
[1:25:45] free woman was by promised that entire
[1:25:47] thing man I wish God would never allow
[1:25:49] to Abraham to have a Ishmael as this it
[1:25:52] was for a reason everything was ordained
[1:25:56] of God
[1:25:57] Abraham's false failures and slip-ups he
[1:26:00] listened to his wife he did this this
[1:26:02] does all it was ordained for God so it
[1:26:04] could be a type pieces which things are
[1:26:07] in allegories as he said but these are
[1:26:10] the two covenants the one from
[1:26:12] cyanide generates the Bonners and the
[1:26:14] other which is to Hagar Iman for Hagar
[1:26:17] is Mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth
[1:26:21] to Jerusalem which is and is in bondage
[1:26:23] with her children look he said that man
[1:26:26] that man that wild man Ishmael was a man
[1:26:28] of law he said it'll produce that it'll
[1:26:34] produce that but Jerusalem which is free
[1:26:35] above is the mother of us all correct
[1:26:37] and in verse 29 he says what but as then
[1:26:41] he that is born after the flesh
[1:26:43] persecuted him that was born after the
[1:26:46] spirit even so it is now right who is
[1:26:51] the greatest example of a wild man who
[1:26:54] lived to the tee by the law of st. Paul
[1:26:57] himself what did the law produce it for
[1:27:01] to produced a man so legalistic that
[1:27:06] when even the signs and wonders and
[1:27:08] miracles that they even the Pharisees
[1:27:11] and Sadducees even knew that no man
[1:27:13] could do these things but God and here
[1:27:16] are a hundred and twenty now doing the
[1:27:18] things of God that no one can do except
[1:27:20] God and this man even though he's a seed
[1:27:23] of God he is under the law he's so bound
[1:27:27] to the law he's married to it and when
[1:27:29] he's married to these things he sees
[1:27:31] someone another church another thing
[1:27:33] there and he does not agree with it
[1:27:35] though he knows he cannot dispute it he
[1:27:37] so he has to persecute it produced a
[1:27:42] wild man called saw but thank God he was
[1:27:49] a seed he had the gene seed within him
[1:27:53] and God allowed him to get that so even
[1:27:56] though in the natural eyes oh my
[1:27:58] goodness ain't saw under gamellia what a
[1:28:02] mighty man zio he says out of the stock
[1:28:04] of Benjamin pure as pure a thoroughbred
[1:28:07] in the eyes of man he was all that but
[1:28:10] in the eyes of God he was actually the
[1:28:12] lowest of all loads he was exactly what
[1:28:16] the Old Testament would produce death
[1:28:20] a perfect killing machine a religious
[1:28:29] killing machine which is a perfect
[1:28:33] killing machine because it looks
[1:28:34] righteous it looks like it's doing the
[1:28:36] right thing you did run well who did
[1:28:41] hinder they should not obey the truth
[1:28:42] this persuasion cometh out of him that
[1:28:44] calleth uses a little leaven leavens a
[1:28:48] man now in Matthew 16 as Christ is going
[1:29:00] to reveal the Mount of Transfiguration
[1:29:01] mystery as we know that that's going
[1:29:04] into adoption moving now he's going to
[1:29:07] be placed as the son his word will be
[1:29:10] the exact same as the father's what the
[1:29:14] Christ does what he says what he
[1:29:17] everything we'll count on him now he's
[1:29:19] the father is given full authority to
[1:29:22] the son he says what here he him but
[1:29:25] before that he must now pass a test okay
[1:29:29] he's going he's are been baptized
[1:29:31] already filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:29:33] already Dollard started doing the very
[1:29:35] worst of God and then now here in
[1:29:37] Matthew 16 verse 21 from that time Jesus
[1:29:42] from the time forth began Jesus to shew
[1:29:44] unto his disciples how that he must go
[1:29:47] unto Jerusalem he says and suffer many
[1:29:50] things the elders and chief priests and
[1:29:52] scribes and be killed and raised again
[1:29:54] he starts bringing forth a mystery he
[1:29:57] prophesied he's as boys he says I'm
[1:29:59] gonna have to die I'm going to the cross
[1:30:03] I'm going to suffer like the one he says
[1:30:05] you could not stop as I cannot stop this
[1:30:07] this is the very plan of God and then
[1:30:11] now notice in verse 22 then Peter took
[1:30:15] him and began to rebuke him saying far
[1:30:18] be it far from the lord this shall not
[1:30:21] be unto thee and notice a Christ now has
[1:30:25] is actually here in the test Christ is
[1:30:28] now going back to the Garden of Eden and
[1:30:30] he's in the exact same test that Eve was
[1:30:33] him
[1:30:33] because the serpent said thou shalt not
[1:30:36] surely die and notice how the Peter and
[1:30:40] we know the Satan was in Pier at this
[1:30:42] time just caught the revelation of who
[1:30:45] Christ was just moments earlier
[1:30:48] and notice how an unconverted person can
[1:30:51] be it could catch the very revelation
[1:30:54] the most intense revelation of God in
[1:30:57] one moment in the next moment completely
[1:30:59] be filled with Antichrist spirit he says
[1:31:02] and now Christ finds himself at the same
[1:31:05] test that Eve is in and now he must pass
[1:31:08] the test for his bride he couldn't leave
[1:31:13] Adam couldn't passage for man was born
[1:31:15] he says he said but when that purrs the
[1:31:17] temptation came to Eve Eve had to make a
[1:31:21] choice in the church fall so now Christ
[1:31:24] has a step in line for his bride and
[1:31:27] what now he's a challenge to me Satan in
[1:31:29] Christ calls it out he says I shall
[1:31:32] surely die Emma and the Bible says if
[1:31:34] you try to save your love uses you'll
[1:31:36] die he says but if you lose your life
[1:31:38] for Christ you'll live again amen
[1:31:43] absolutely he says what he said on the
[1:31:46] Peter get thee behind me Satan and from
[1:31:49] this point he identified the Antichrist
[1:31:51] spirit and he went on to be adopted the
[1:31:55] beautiful thing is the prophets in the
[1:31:56] church book he says he says end the
[1:31:58] temptation will come as follows he says
[1:32:00] it'll be just similar just like it
[1:32:03] wasn't evil remember Eve was already in
[1:32:06] the Garden of Eden Eve was already
[1:32:09] restored at that time at the time in
[1:32:13] this temptation saints of God we will be
[1:32:15] ready we don't have to be because
[1:32:18] remember the bride does not go into it
[1:32:21] she has learned she's been trained she's
[1:32:23] been led by the Holy Spirit the entire
[1:32:26] time a man and God now is anointing her
[1:32:28] to discern the Antichrist spirit come on
[1:32:33] in children because this move of the
[1:32:36] religious realm is going to be so nice
[1:32:38] the you were gonna have to fellowship
[1:32:40] we're going to be able to share the
[1:32:41] Prophet with the Catholic broom a will
[1:32:43] share the Prophet with the Methodists
[1:32:45] and Pentecostals the Assembly garden
[1:32:47] all the bestest and and the
[1:32:49] Presbyterians we're gonna share we all
[1:32:51] get to share our face together no we're
[1:32:54] not coming in as life-giving as that may
[1:32:57] sound that we all maybe become one
[1:33:01] we're not moving into it you know what
[1:33:05] the Prophet said about the first second
[1:33:06] miracle council he said they should have
[1:33:08] never went up into that beating they get
[1:33:11] an invitation
[1:33:12] don't even go we serve God and God alone
[1:33:16] amen that's right we're coming amen
[1:33:21] separate self and me be pure amen now
[1:33:25] notice here but notice at this time when
[1:33:29] Eve fell and then Adam Fowler says here
[1:33:32] in Genesis 3:7
[1:33:33] and the eyes then breadth both were open
[1:33:35] the knew they were naked and they sewed
[1:33:37] fig leaves together and made themselves
[1:33:41] aprons right now notice how the
[1:33:44] scripture says that they chose the fig
[1:33:46] leaves the fig leaves come from fig
[1:33:49] trees and we know the fig tree
[1:33:51] represents Israel and we know that what
[1:33:53] the Israel was given the Old Testament
[1:33:56] the law at first which was a bloodless
[1:33:58] religion they met and they shown right
[1:34:01] here that that Jewish law that Jewish
[1:34:03] religion before Christ would not be eat
[1:34:06] enough am i absolutely that's exactly
[1:34:10] what that shows it is a bonus than
[1:34:12] they're trying to do it themselves give
[1:34:14] me something to do look the progress
[1:34:17] that they should have rejected it to
[1:34:18] contain Commandments and ask for
[1:34:20] something better
[1:34:22] amen and then of course we know in
[1:34:25] Genesis 4 3 says in the process of time
[1:34:27] it came to pass that Cain brought of the
[1:34:29] fruit of the ground an offering unto the
[1:34:31] Lord notice another bloodless religion
[1:34:34] there's no holy spirit in this religion
[1:34:38] now moving in the spirit no filling none
[1:34:40] of that is just stay calm look how
[1:34:43] beautiful it is ah now now dealing with
[1:34:49] the examining yourself dealing with the
[1:34:52] Antichrist spirit in acts 8 9 once it
[1:34:58] examine some things here
[1:35:00] when you know how these people they kept
[1:35:02] in the New Testament he starts showing
[1:35:04] some things how people rise up and acts
[1:35:07] eight nine four there was a certain man
[1:35:09] called Simon which before time in the
[1:35:12] same city used sorcery and be wished the
[1:35:14] people of Samaria giving out that
[1:35:18] himself was some great one he
[1:35:22] specifically said he said there's
[1:35:23] something special about me I think I'm
[1:35:26] this and I think I that now watch what
[1:35:28] takes place here God is with me I'm a
[1:35:31] special man anointed that I he lifted
[1:35:33] himself up and he did a perfect sale he
[1:35:38] is a perfect salesman he sold it to the
[1:35:41] people and the people believed it and it
[1:35:45] was so they were so moved on this
[1:35:48] individual to whom they all gave heed
[1:35:51] from the least to the greatest saying
[1:35:53] this man is the great power this is the
[1:35:58] one any problems in this city we've got
[1:36:02] a guy we can go to this guy has great
[1:36:05] power of God and he told the people he
[1:36:09] was that one he lifted himself up and
[1:36:12] set the stage and everyone went in line
[1:36:15] hook and sinker these are things to
[1:36:20] watch for are they lifting up Christ or
[1:36:23] themselves is the meaning about them or
[1:36:27] Jesus Christ is the meaning about Jesus
[1:36:29] Christ and getting you healed and more
[1:36:31] lifted up and encouraging you all and
[1:36:33] this and that wasn't about them X 535
[1:36:39] and he said to me men of Israel take
[1:36:40] heed yourself what you intend to do as
[1:36:43] touching these men he says bow before
[1:36:45] those days rose up Thaddeus boasting
[1:36:48] himself to be somebody well brother yes

[1:37:36] don't and I don't feel some compassion
[1:37:38] about this homeless person God have
[1:37:39] mercy on me whether God tells us to do
[1:37:42] something for him or not maybe we should
[1:37:44] have some kind of a compassion we should
[1:37:46] and we were up late last night we're
[1:37:49] talking about dad and Jessie let's pray
[1:37:50] we had to just felt so much compassion
[1:37:52] we started praying for dad we're still

[1:38:28] glory of God
[1:38:30] also notice what takes place you follow
[1:38:33] somebody you're gonna get slain to
[1:38:34] whomever the Bible says he that leadeth
[1:38:36] into captivity shall go into captivity
[1:38:39] he says that's in Revelations to whom a
[1:38:41] number of men about 400 joined
[1:38:43] themselves who was slain and all and as
[1:38:45] many as obeyed him he made disciples of
[1:38:48] himself
[1:38:48] we're scattered and brought to nought
[1:38:50] after this man rose up Judas of Galilee
[1:38:52] in the days of the taxing notice he was
[1:38:55] Judas which is of the tribe of Judah
[1:38:57] which means praise he was right in that
[1:39:00] line he says and rooms much away most
[1:39:04] people after himself he also perished in
[1:39:06] all even as many obeyed him were
[1:39:07] dispersed wash these things in John's
[1:39:14] 7:16 Jesus an through my doctrine is not
[1:39:17] mine but he that sent me If any man will
[1:39:19] do his will he shall know of the
[1:39:21] doctrine whether it be of God or whether
[1:39:23] I speak of myself he says here the
[1:39:26] speaketh of himself seeketh his own
[1:39:28] glory when someone says that revelations
[1:39:32] 10 7 is not Malachi 4:5 they are
[1:39:35] changing they are taking away from the
[1:39:37] Word of God for their own glory they are
[1:39:39] saying the Prophet didn't have the
[1:39:41] revelation that I got I understand this
[1:39:44] is better than the prophet of God and
[1:39:47] you what they do they save their own
[1:39:49] tapes and listen their own tapes instead
[1:39:51] the prophets they send this pastors this
[1:39:54] pastors tape out and this pastors tape
[1:39:56] out from that certain thing listen that
[1:39:59] when we listen to the Prophet said he
[1:40:05] the speaketh of himself seeking his own
[1:40:07] glory but he that seeketh his his glory
[1:40:09] that sent him the same is true and no
[1:40:11] unrighteous is in him real quickly here
[1:40:16] in 2nd Thessalonians where a 55-minute
[1:40:18] Saints hold on just live longer he said
[1:40:20] let no man deceive you by any means for
[1:40:22] that day shall not come except there
[1:40:23] come a falling away first and that man
[1:40:25] of sin be revealed the son of perdition
[1:40:26] who opposeth and exalteth himself above
[1:40:30] all that is called God amen we know
[1:40:34] that's the Antichrist in 2nd Timothy 3:1
[1:40:38] this know also that in the last days
[1:40:41] things of God was the first church age
[1:40:42] the last day potential was the second
[1:40:48] church age the last day potential they
[1:40:50] said all the way back there was the last
[1:40:51] date but saints of God we are the last
[1:40:54] of the last of the last of the last days
[1:40:56] right now it can't go any further there
[1:40:59] is no other Church changes there is a
[1:41:01] church there's a tribulation coming and
[1:41:03] then there's a great millennium coming
[1:41:04] Saints are done there is not an eighth
[1:41:06] Church age is not an eighth Church aging
[1:41:08] messenger there is none of that he's a
[1:41:11] bit broken last days perilous times
[1:41:15] first thing he identifies the first
[1:41:18] thing of these things to bring forth for
[1:41:22] men shall be lovers of their own cell
[1:41:26] know
[1:41:27] burr one covetous boasters proud
[1:41:33] blasphemers disobedient parents
[1:41:36] unthankful unholy without natural
[1:41:38] function wrote on to all these things
[1:41:40] ever learning never able to come to the
[1:41:43] knowledge of true see they never
[1:41:44] understand it we know in 1st Samuel 15
[1:41:50] for rebellion is as the sin of
[1:41:53] witchcraft witchcraft rebellion
[1:41:58] witchcraft rebellion against what the
[1:42:01] Word of God before against the
[1:42:03] revelation of the hour that's witchcraft
[1:42:06] he says and stubbornness
[1:42:08] god help us all I have examining
[1:42:14] ourselves daily hourly we want to be in
[1:42:17] this and stubbornness as iniquity and
[1:42:19] idolatry now look here
[1:42:23] Matthew 3 and we just got little ways
[1:42:26] here to go maybe 10 15 minutes that ok I
[1:42:27] want to show you something Lord brought
[1:42:29] to me at this when I was going to priest
[1:42:31] really came here in Matthew 3 verse 1
[1:42:36] John the Baptist is now on the scene he
[1:42:39] starts preaching and what was this
[1:42:41] message repent for the kingdom of heaven
[1:42:43] is at hand and he goes on now and 2 into
[1:42:46] uh I believe it some into Jerusalem
[1:42:54] around about Jordan there and were
[1:42:57] baptized of him in Jordan confessing
[1:42:59] their sins the true move of God is on
[1:43:03] the true move of God is started the true
[1:43:08] message is now on the scene but look but
[1:43:11] when he saw many of the Pharisees and
[1:43:13] Sadducees come to his baptism he sent
[1:43:17] him Oh a generation of vipers who hath
[1:43:19] warned you to flee from the wrath to
[1:43:20] come
[1:43:21] notice who showed up did they stay away
[1:43:24] in condemn it no they went to
[1:43:25] investigate they went to see what was
[1:43:28] going on at the very move of God and one
[1:43:31] thing I love here now if you go into if
[1:43:33] you ever if you ever that's the the the
[1:43:35] my sword or the II sword or whatever
[1:43:37] they've got many applications you can go
[1:43:38] and study the gill and bar
[1:43:41] and I went into Gil's on this and he
[1:43:44] says this being the first place in which
[1:43:48] mention is made of the Pharisees and
[1:43:51] Sadducees the first time the scripture
[1:43:53] right here it may not be a mist to give
[1:43:57] some account of them once for all and to
[1:44:00] begin with the Pharisees first with
[1:44:01] their name the word name Pharisee or
[1:44:04] frottage means to divide to make it a
[1:44:06] breach so they they are they divide
[1:44:09] themselves separate themselves from the
[1:44:12] people that is a religious and as Nikhil
[1:44:15] a tune is 'm they were called the visi
[1:44:19] the divided the Pharisees divided
[1:44:22] themselves some people as righteous
[1:44:24] persons notice they divided themselves
[1:44:26] righteously through religious through
[1:44:30] religion by their works you know why I
[1:44:39] love this I like going I like I love
[1:44:42] what the Prophet says I love all his
[1:44:43] quotes but I also like look what the
[1:44:45] Prophet said interchange book the
[1:44:47] preaching of the word now he's dealing
[1:44:48] with the man age he says the preaching
[1:44:49] the word was never greater as satan rose
[1:44:52] up as hordes of free thinkers and
[1:44:53] originators of Kanye's and rose up as
[1:44:55] liberal theologians spread their filthy
[1:44:57] where's God raised up mighty boys of
[1:44:59] faith and the greatest works of
[1:45:02] Christian literature and teaching and
[1:45:04] preaching came from this era not from
[1:45:08] Laodicea never has it's preachers and
[1:45:12] teachers been matched and never will
[1:45:15] they be what are we doing everything hey
[1:45:22] when I when I want to bring forth the
[1:45:23] server or study I just go ahead turn my
[1:45:26] computer on and I started studying what
[1:45:28] was sent to us the met I didn't bring
[1:45:30] this message I'm just now gathering
[1:45:32] information on a thought that God gave
[1:45:34] me or thing or I'm searching for what I
[1:45:36] gone to the message so looking at it I
[1:45:38] pull from the histories I pull from this
[1:45:40] I pull that I didn't do any of it I'm
[1:45:41] just collecting it putting in an order
[1:45:44] and then delivering
[1:45:46] a lot of times he's old he's old from
[1:45:51] the Mannings we're the ones that dig
[1:45:52] through all the histories dug it all out
[1:45:54] and sell it for us and then now I'm
[1:45:57] mourning the message has not in the
[1:45:59] message has actually compiled all these
[1:46:01] things put them on an app a Bible app
[1:46:03] for us a message and so we can pull from
[1:46:06] this and we've all the message the hour
[1:46:09] oh my goodness we have it all just all's
[1:46:10] we gotta do is each it regurgitate sure
[1:46:14] upped immediately met yeah he says the
[1:46:17] Spurgeon's the Parkers the McLaren's the
[1:46:20] Edwards the bunions he says he's the
[1:46:22] molars the brains of the bars the
[1:46:24] bishops and I would include the gills as
[1:46:26] well all came from this ere they
[1:46:29] preached and taught the Word of God they
[1:46:31] glorified his name I love it
[1:46:34] now as gills dealing with these
[1:46:37] Pharisees Pharisees when this sect first
[1:46:41] begun and who was the first author of it
[1:46:43] is not easy to say the owned the
[1:46:45] Pharisees they don't know who started it
[1:46:46] it is certain they were great numbers of
[1:46:48] them in the times of John the Baptist
[1:46:50] and of Christ and for some time after
[1:46:53] that he says history records the
[1:46:54] Pharisees athlet he says the Jews say
[1:46:56] that when the temple was destroyed the
[1:46:58] second time the Pharisees increased in
[1:47:00] Israel so notice the destruction of the
[1:47:02] house of God more religious come in more
[1:47:06] anti word come in but now where does
[1:47:11] Google bring forth in the histories did
[1:47:13] you know it is recorded in history there
[1:47:19] are seven kinds of Pharisees you can't
[1:47:25] make it up
[1:47:26] there's not five there's not six there's
[1:47:29] not a there's seven you wait till you
[1:47:34] see the seventh one the Tomek riders say
[1:47:37] there were seven sorts of them well he
[1:47:42] says and if it would not be too tedious
[1:47:44] to the reader
[1:47:45] it goes like he's he's like asking
[1:47:47] permission to write this so I can he
[1:47:48] said I just want to include this in for
[1:47:49] you guys I want to expand your minds and
[1:47:51] so you can actually identify the
[1:47:53] Antichrist spirit here the girl says I
[1:47:56] feel it he says if it's okay with you
[1:47:58] guys I'm gonna put this in my writings
[1:48:00] and rather because some of them seem to
[1:48:03] tally with the complexion and conduct of
[1:48:05] the Pharisees mentioned to the
[1:48:06] scriptures there were then the secchi
[1:48:11] might Pharisee they called him the such
[1:48:15] a might Pharisee who does as such um did
[1:48:20] is circumsized number such a went and
[1:48:25] got the the the daughter of was Edina Oh
[1:48:27] huh Genesis 34 verse 1 and Dina the
[1:48:33] daughter of Leia which she bear and the
[1:48:36] Jacob went out to see the daughters of
[1:48:38] the land and when such am the son of hey
[1:48:40] core the hivite the prince of the
[1:48:42] country saw her he took her and lay with
[1:48:44] her and defiled her and his sole claim
[1:48:46] under Dinah and the daughter of Jacob
[1:48:48] and he loved the damsel spake kindly
[1:48:50] unto her he fell in love with this
[1:48:53] religion a daughter or a church of the
[1:48:55] religion but a Pharisee is like a such a
[1:49:00] might Pharisee he did he did not get
[1:49:05] circumcised not on God's account did not
[1:49:10] get baptized let's say in the message
[1:49:12] hidden like a baptize because it was the
[1:49:14] will of God he was supposed to do it he
[1:49:17] felt a Pole to do it or for his own
[1:49:24] glory it was even for his glory that he
[1:49:27] got baptized or circumcised to say or
[1:49:31] because circumcision is a commandment of
[1:49:33] his but for his own profit and advantage
[1:49:37] and that he may get honour from men look
[1:49:42] I have come into the Israelite fold I've
[1:49:44] been circumcised just like they have and
[1:49:47] God gave me this wonderful wife come to
[1:49:51] the message looking for a precious
[1:49:53] sister you did it for his own advantage
[1:49:58] it was for him things that he could gain
[1:50:02] maybe I'll be a big minister in the
[1:50:05] messenger maybe I'll become the best
[1:50:07] deacon ever was and maybe I can get a
[1:50:09] position in the church
[1:50:12] such a might Pharisee the next one was
[1:50:19] called the dashing Pharisee who walks
[1:50:22] gently he was so religious the heel of
[1:50:28] one foot touching the great toe of the
[1:50:29] other he walked so gently as not to go
[1:50:34] to the right or to the left he wanted to
[1:50:39] have the perfect walk and he he kept his
[1:50:41] eyes on his walk and his walk alone
[1:50:47] walked so gentle among the people
[1:50:52] scarcely lift up his feet from the earth
[1:50:55] so that he dashes them against the
[1:50:58] stones and would be thereby thought to
[1:51:00] be in deep meditation this brother is
[1:51:05] amazing he just walks out alone and just
[1:51:08] finds things and ask God for things he's
[1:51:12] always seeking God and he's separate
[1:51:14] from the people but remember those
[1:51:16] things are good but a Pharisee is a
[1:51:19] divider and as the Prophet brought it
[1:51:21] forth he is a actor what they called it
[1:51:26] in Hollywood overacting well when I was
[1:51:32] in the world one of my favorite
[1:51:33] comedians was they called an over actor
[1:51:39] that's two number three Pharisee letting
[1:51:44] blood who makes as if his eye as he
[1:51:50] shuts his eyes that he may not look upon
[1:51:53] women and so runs and dashes his head
[1:51:56] against the wall to the blood gushes out
[1:51:59] as though a vein was opened brother I
[1:52:02] can't believe you look at that so trying
[1:52:07] to run away from evil and he does it on
[1:52:10] purpose trying to gain attention to show
[1:52:14] how a religious and how he loves the law
[1:52:16] how he wants to serve God by not
[1:52:19] defiling his eyes or his mind he runs
[1:52:22] into wall dashes his head's blubbering
[1:52:25] the wall bro
[1:52:26] down here brother leave me out of here I
[1:52:27] can't I don't want to look at anything
[1:52:29] just take me by the hand all acting and
[1:52:35] yet very very religious can you imagine
[1:52:44] that what if people in this message did
[1:52:46] that today it'd be obvious we're way
[1:52:49] past that now the depressed Pharisee who
[1:52:55] went Dumbledore bowed bowed down either
[1:52:58] because uh they called him the mortar
[1:53:01] Pharisee either because he wore a
[1:53:02] garment like a mortar with his mouth
[1:53:04] turned downwards or a hat resembling
[1:53:07] such a vest as well he could not look
[1:53:08] upward right this way or that way right
[1:53:11] forward he just always seemed to be just
[1:53:14] so burdened by the sins of the people
[1:53:17] and so Chuck I got almost like sighing
[1:53:21] and crying for the abominations done in
[1:53:22] the city this world is so bad oh god
[1:53:27] help us got it mercy but it was an act
[1:53:32] it was not even caring for the people it
[1:53:36] was for show and the prophets that Jesus
[1:53:40] Christ was not a showman he didn't show
[1:53:44] pradhan be yourself
[1:53:48] in Christ Jesus let Christ be you amen I
[1:53:53] was on my phone and I hit something and
[1:53:56] something popped up from Instagram and
[1:53:58] it was a pervert a thing and I don't
[1:53:59] know how they got on my phone I looked
[1:54:01] at it real quick it often done just move
[1:54:04] on yes it's automatic you don't want
[1:54:07] nothing to do with in you know I ain't
[1:54:08] gonna show tell nobody about another you

[1:55:56] prepared appear that he had done and
[1:55:58] performed all my gosh that brother's
[1:56:02] done it he is to the T he's got his act
[1:56:05] together
[1:56:06] does he understood these things out to
[1:56:09] look for this is the Old Testament this
[1:56:12] is the New Testament shadow the Pharisee
[1:56:18] of fear number 6 who does what he does
[1:56:23] from fear of punishment well I don't
[1:56:27] want to go to hell and I don't want
[1:56:28] pastor Jesse to rebuke me I don't want
[1:56:31] to offend my brother and I don't want to
[1:56:32] offend my sister and listen that and
[1:56:34] just
[1:56:35] always real careful I mean okay what if
[1:56:37] I do this well this could happen well he
[1:56:41] does nothing well this past this
[1:56:46] brothers doing something but what if he
[1:56:47] gets mad at me and I say this or I see
[1:56:50] this sister doing something by me and I
[1:56:51] know it's wrong but I shouldn't what if
[1:56:52] I shouldn't you know why but there's
[1:56:55] actually a Pharisee a religious order
[1:56:56] and there were people within that or
[1:56:59] November this is there's seven kinds and
[1:57:01] each of all those Pharisees fit in one
[1:57:03] or two of these groups in other words
[1:57:05] that sphere that was on one affected the
[1:57:06] other groups and the spirit or Dawn
[1:57:08] affected others to be just like him and
[1:57:11] it's all done of the guise of religion
[1:57:16] what could be Saints God if you could
[1:57:19] guess what would be the seventh
[1:57:20] characteristic of a Pharisee or the
[1:57:22] seventh group which say label is number
[1:57:25] seven lines right up with the church
[1:57:28] ages the church age book the message the
[1:57:31] hour the Pharisee of love so I could
[1:57:40] choose kiss who does what he does from
[1:57:45] love but you know what because I love
[1:57:57] her I'm forced to love her I'm gonna get
[1:57:59] a great reward for this I really can't
[1:58:01] stand her but I must love her because
[1:58:03] the Bible says so is that real love I've
[1:58:10] done some tests on this section which
[1:58:14] the gloss explains thus for the love of
[1:58:16] the reward of the commandment all the
[1:58:20] commandments that Christ gave us to
[1:58:22] fulfill they do them because they want
[1:58:26] the heavenly reward more than actually
[1:58:29] doing it for the right reason and not
[1:58:34] for the love of the commandment of his
[1:58:36] creator
[1:58:37] one time I was at a service and as
[1:58:39] pastor was preaching on how big his
[1:58:41] crown was gonna be and it's gonna be
[1:58:43] this big and this big uns can have this
[1:58:45] and that and I'm like why is he worried
[1:58:46] about the reward
[1:58:48] instead of the people though they say
[1:58:52] all these there is a and Harry here's
[1:58:55] how the saying went though they say of
[1:58:57] all these there is none more none to be
[1:58:59] below but the spare sea of love oh
[1:59:02] there's neva love Pharisees the Pharisee
[1:59:06] of love is the best one you know how I
[1:59:09] test this lately I've actually took in
[1:59:11] fact in before I found this I did little
[1:59:12] tests and I'll encounter a minister or a
[1:59:15] brother of this net and I'd say oh
[1:59:17] brother bla bla and they start talking
[1:59:18] about themselves and giving me their
[1:59:20] testimonies and I listen to them all
[1:59:22] wonderful praise God praise God and then
[1:59:24] when they're done I start telling me
[1:59:26] telling them my testimonies and oh oh oh
[1:59:30] brother Sam right well I gotta go hmm

[2:00:09] you only lead the fivefold ministry no I
[2:00:11] don't say that you will need and gave
[2:00:13] those for the Holy Ghost in spirit and
[2:00:16] in truth they meant anyone the scalp the
[2:00:19] Holy Ghost spirit he will lead and guide
[2:00:21] them and he who performing his works

[2:01:20] word Pharisee means an actor an actor is
[2:01:23] a mimic or impersonator and how well
[2:01:26] that does fit in our modern word of
[2:01:28] hypocrite and actor and in person if
[2:01:29] somebody who's trying to be something as
[2:01:31] Congress Upshaw said he's he said you

[2:02:49] father's to the aged women as mothers
[2:02:51] and brothers and sisters all around
[2:02:57] just be yourself at all time that's the
[2:03:00] best way to be don't you better leave it

[2:03:17] revelations five sub 15 stand if you
[2:03:20] want well staying here we'll go into
[2:03:21] closing everybody God's grace
[2:03:22] revelations 3:15 he says I know thy
[2:03:24] works that thou art neither a hot or
[2:03:27] cold I would add our cold or hot go back
[2:03:30] to revelations right now notice what he
[2:03:34] says here in the sermon the pure the
[2:03:36] Philadelphian church age sermon in
[2:03:38] nineteen sixty twelve ten so it was with
[2:03:43] the early church of that Galatians Paul
[2:03:46] dealing with Galatians B which what that
[2:03:49] your works have something to a salvation
[2:03:51] so it was with the early church notice
[2:03:54] at the end at the end of the Laodicean
[2:03:58] age went back to works again so one of
[2:04:04] the things we're going to see at this
[2:04:06] end time the end of the end is people
[2:04:09] exalting their own works instead of God
[2:04:13] I've done this and I've done that I'm
[2:04:15] not talking about denomination I'm
[2:04:17] talking in the message note if you
[2:04:21] notice here to show that his church is
[2:04:23] between these two he says if you go into
[2:04:25] Laodicean Church age or the thylacine
[2:04:27] church age I know there were right at
[2:04:29] the end of the alien age what was it thy
[2:04:32] works that works and the seat were
[2:04:36] sayings at what was the seat of Satan C
[2:04:38] went right straight back into
[2:04:39] denominations again when you think your
[2:04:42] work she says that's a dude that's a
[2:04:43] denominational spirit right back into
[2:04:46] nomination saying I did this the
[2:04:47] Pentecost say up to this a million more
[2:04:49] in 44 I did this this is this look at we
[2:04:52] have done there all Lord Lord have we
[2:04:54] not done many wonderful mighty works in
[2:04:58] thy name same service the fill a church
[2:05:05] the end of Leila seems they went back to
[2:05:07] works again or Pentecostal denominations
[2:05:09] went back to the denomination what do
[2:05:11] these didn't mess what are these
[2:05:12] preachers in the message when this
[2:05:14] temptation come and they go in they go
[2:05:15] right back because they think it's their
[2:05:17] works
[2:05:17] you don't think there's something's
[2:05:18] going to go back the Prophet said
[2:05:19] there's some many ministers you can go
[2:05:21] back and be tempted to some will stays
[2:05:23] and will go
[2:05:24] or to God now I want to read this last
[2:05:30] quote here if he's in church age church
[2:05:34] age book John knew them knew of them he
[2:05:37] sent John first John many false prophets
[2:05:39] will rise the Antichrist was already
[2:05:41] infiltrating the church and it was doing
[2:05:43] it by going against the word okay going
[2:05:46] against the word the Anti Christ Church
[2:05:49] the Antichrist spirit is now in a church
[2:05:51] what is the Antichrist spirit Satan
[2:05:53] himself
[2:05:54] demons minions the most distorted
[2:05:58] creatures evil full of Filth creatures
[2:06:02] on the face and then the under the earth
[2:06:03] above the earth
[2:06:05] well these things are they're the worst
[2:06:06] things there is that kind of spirit gets
[2:06:09] into the church right now what is the
[2:06:11] spirit going to do what is how does that
[2:06:14] spirit disguise itself why here is where
[2:06:19] it all started right here at the first
[2:06:20] church age already they were denying the
[2:06:22] word notice he's going back to the
[2:06:23] beginning here what we read in the New
[2:06:25] Testament setting their their own
[2:06:26] Creed's and philosophies instead of the
[2:06:27] word that is Antichrist for Jesus is the
[2:06:30] word to be Antichrist is to be anti
[2:06:31] Jesus right he says to be Antichrist
[2:06:34] anti words me Antichrist because the
[2:06:36] spirit and the word are one if you're
[2:06:38] Antichrist you will be Antichrist or
[2:06:40] sorry if you're anti word you'll be
[2:06:42] Antichrist and if it started in the
[2:06:44] first church in and it would have to
[2:06:46] grow so whatever that little spirit was
[2:06:49] that when in the church will have to
[2:06:51] grow so it's gonna be a big spirit a big
[2:06:57] ugly thing yes now are we talking about
[2:07:04] the Catholic Church no it will have to
[2:07:10] go into the end when it takes over and
[2:07:13] that is exactly what you'll see as we
[2:07:15] cover all the ages it started out so
[2:07:17] real small and the fees ensured it grows
[2:07:18] into every age until anti word
[2:07:20] Antichrist em takes over entirely
[2:07:22] infallible availability of the word is
[2:07:24] repudiated by the false apostles and
[2:07:26] false church
[2:07:27] now prophet went on wrong he said man
[2:07:30] this is going to grow and grow and get
[2:07:31] bigger bigger now it could be easy to
[2:07:33] get the wrong impression he says what I
[2:07:36] just said here
[2:07:36] he's about growing and get worse snores
[2:07:38] he says he said this you could get the
[2:07:40] wrong impression on this he says is that
[2:07:42] what we're talking about he's I'm gonna
[2:07:44] make this so strong it could sound to
[2:07:47] you as though this anti word Antichrist
[2:07:50] spirit is a complete reputation
[2:07:53] reputation repeat reputation of the word
[2:07:56] in other words fully going away from the
[2:07:58] Bible
[2:07:59] fully going away from religion it does
[2:08:03] not grow into that a denial the Bible a
[2:08:09] culminating in its rejection rejection
[2:08:11] no no sir it is not that it is the
[2:08:16] changing of even just one word by taking
[2:08:22] away or adding to it that my brothers
[2:08:27] and my sisters are this is the
[2:08:29] Antichrist spirit that is the greatest
[2:08:32] actor there is what if I was an actor
[2:08:37] and I would say this to a Christian
[2:08:42] actor what would be the greatest part
[2:08:43] you could play part of Jesus to walk
[2:08:50] like Christ to talk like Christ to act
[2:08:54] like Christ in Thailand they they always
[2:09:00] say like this house bring it god bless
[2:09:03] you sister
[2:09:04] god bless you better to act exactly like
[2:09:10] Christ Himself knowing the word just
[2:09:13] like in the garden knowing how to bring
[2:09:17] just like Balaam how I bring God down
[2:09:18] perfect for show the entrance to worship
[2:09:22] knowing everything
[2:09:24] but to venture to add or take away one
[2:09:29] word this is a serious time Saints ah
[2:09:32] this is pressing more and more on my
[2:09:35] heart every day I didn't even look for
[2:09:37] this stuff this stuff just shows up to
[2:09:38] me I catch it I'm rereading the church
[2:09:41] age book and getting it through and
[2:09:42] getting through it and it's these things
[2:09:43] these cultures is popping up to me I'm
[2:09:44] thinking these things are absolutely
[2:09:45] marvelous in Ephesus it was just the
[2:09:51] same just a word added a word taken away
[2:09:56] the anti word Antichrist spirit began to
[2:10:00] flourish examine yourselves make sure
[2:10:04] we're not acting I don't believe anyone
[2:10:06] here as an actor but we want to be clean
[2:10:12] every hour every minute just exist
[2:10:16] brother Simon why did I do that
[2:10:18] beside why did you do this why'd he do
[2:10:20] that God forgive me help me there how
[2:10:23] many do this how we do that one time
[2:10:25] just recently I was on a job site and
[2:10:27] the superintendent walked out to me said
[2:10:28] all you work for Chuck and listen as he
[2:10:30] goes he was uh-uh
[2:10:31] are you his son and I said no and I kind
[2:10:33] of made a funny remark you know kinda
[2:10:34] like that'd be a bad thing you know
[2:10:36] instantly I felt checked I want the site
[2:10:39] I'm like I got to make that right so
[2:10:42] next time I was on the job I said hey
[2:10:43] mr. servers oh you know when you said
[2:10:45] that this is a said I was just joking
[2:10:47] I'm sorry about that
[2:10:49] Chuck is what Chuck is the best employer
[2:10:51] I've ever had he is the very best boss
[2:10:54] I've ever had but just to make a little
[2:10:58] negative comment it was just a joke even
[2:11:02] but it was negative that grieved me so
[2:11:04] bad you know with the spirit of
[2:11:07] America's rough that joking and the
[2:11:09] flower frolicking and and just you know
[2:11:12] we just got a bright the good thing is I
[2:11:15] felt a check and I thank God for that
[2:11:16] and the good thing is I had opportunity
[2:11:18] to make it right and I looked up to this
[2:11:20] man he's not a Christian and I said man
[2:11:22] I apologize for that I know this this
[2:11:23] isn't everything so I had a chance an
[2:11:26] opportunity to make that right so saints
[2:11:30] of God were in a serious hour
[2:11:32] and tonight we're going to teach on
[2:11:34] others a different subject but along the
[2:11:36] same lines by God's grace

[2:13:33] absolutely filthy power heads
[2:13:38] dearly father Lord Jesus we just love
[2:13:40] you Lord God Lord we just want to lift
[2:13:43] you up God and Lord we want to expose
[2:13:45] that Antichrist spirit God and Lord not
[2:13:49] to point anyone out God or not to name
[2:13:52] names or figures or anything but Lord
[2:13:54] God we want to watch for these little
[2:13:56] movements and actions but Lord we want
[2:14:00] to love everyone anyhow Lord we don't
[2:14:03] know who's who long who is the saw
[2:14:05] that's gonna turn onto a Polidori saying
[2:14:10] Esau was a Pharisee garden very
[2:14:13] religious Lord Joseph of Arimathea was a
[2:14:16] Pharisee God Lord a secret believer Lord
[2:14:18] but he was still a seed Nicodemus a
[2:14:20] secret believer Lord he showed his
[2:14:22] colors their Lord at her at the death of
[2:14:24] Christ he came and got the very body
[2:14:26] Lord of Christ he he showed who he was
[2:14:29] at that time at the very death he
[2:14:31] exposed that he was a believer Jesus
[2:14:33] Christ and that word was more precious
[2:14:35] to him he embalmed it and laid it right
[2:14:38] to rest Norden was so precious to him
[2:14:40] God although we may see brothers or
[2:14:43] sisters that may we may even think are
[2:14:45] Pharisees Lord or Sadducees Lord though
[2:14:48] we're gonna love him right in the
[2:14:49] kingdom God told me we never ever get an
[2:14:52] antichrist spirit on us Lord but we
[2:14:55] wanted we don't want to ask God but we
[2:14:57] pray Lord that you would live through us
[2:15:00] Lord as we yield our bodies and vessels
[2:15:03] every day Lord live your life through us
[2:15:07] we don't want no acting here down Lord
[2:15:11] Lord give us that discernment Lord the
[2:15:14] Bible said Lord and the Prophet said
[2:15:16] Lord that it would be at that time an
[2:15:18] order your church would raise up in
[2:15:19] discernment and once again God and be
[2:15:21] able to discern the two spirits within a
[2:15:23] framework of the church Lord we all were
[2:15:26] very serious about this so we know the
[2:15:28] time is coming soon God Lord we want to
[2:15:31] be right in line we love you so much
[2:15:33] more we pray Lord it was ahead of I into
[2:15:34] the body of the here of the Assembly in
[2:15:37] order to watch out st. Paul talked about
[2:15:40] false brother Lord and false this in
[2:15:42] that Lord and doors to love them Lord we
[2:15:44] got to be careful or
[2:15:46] this is a war or this is a bath but we
[2:15:51] don't know who's friend and foe Lord the
[2:15:53] Lord we want to trust you from beyond or
[2:15:56] leading guard every soul here god bless
[2:15:58] him keeper in the names you scourge of
[2:16:02] those all right this morning Saints it's
[2:16:05] a little teaching teachings here learn
[2:16:09] from these things I am well I as a
[2:16:11] teacher I must teach myself God must
[2:16:12] teach me and show me these things so I
[2:16:15] can share with others to keep our eyes
[2:16:17] open our ears sharp clear keen
[2:16:21] hold-downs we can so we can know and as
[2:16:26] as you walk in life especially with
[2:16:30] people around trainers to train yourself
[2:16:33] like this this how I trained myself
[2:16:34] lately in the last couple years and
[2:16:36] years years when I'm out and about and
[2:16:39] someone does this or someone says this I
[2:16:43] always say why did they do this what why
[2:16:49] what was that all about and then I go to
[2:16:52] the message they ask the Lord or reveal
[2:16:55] this to me reveal this to me show me
[2:16:58] what why did they say this in that
[2:16:59] certain way in that tone inflection and
[2:17:02] if I can't figure it out tonight and I
[2:17:04] should call the brother or sister and
[2:17:06] say brother why'd you say this might you
[2:17:07] say that I've done that before many
[2:17:08] times but always just can't let they
[2:17:10] learn like let God just let you catch
[2:17:12] these things you just catch these things
[2:17:15] you know we want we don't want to be
[2:17:17] foolish we don't waste time we don't
[2:17:19] waste energy I'm learning so much how
[2:17:21] much energy I've wasted trying to help
[2:17:24] those who don't want to help themselves
[2:17:27] so anyhow past just caught up saints of
[2:17:31] God let's just worship the Lord he's
[2:17:32] been so good to us so kind
[2:17:35] and we want to give them back by the
[2:17:37] grace of God thank you for these little
[2:17:39] revelations
