[0:02] believe it is
[0:03] Psalm 149

[0:17] Lord willing this evening we'll have
[0:18] like a short kids Bible study and then
[0:22] we'll record sister who is a final part
[0:24] of her testimony by God's grace look
[0:27] forward to that after that I think my
[0:28] wife is scheduled to go next you'd like
[0:30] to give her testimony
[0:32] by God's grace
[0:34] and then anybody else after that would
[0:35] like to line up Jose for certain and
[0:38] maybe sister Lina whoever feels LED
[0:40] brother bang you know whoever feels led
[0:42] to give a testimony praise God for the
[0:44] glory of God hallelujah
[0:46] it's all for Jesus's Glory praise God I
[0:48] tell you I'm so encouraged I was
[0:49] listening to sister who is testimony
[0:51] again this week and I was like wow it's
[0:53] just such a great reminder like how much
[0:55] the prince of God has moved in our lives
[0:57] and then that actually stirs up our
[1:00] faith to want to see more of it praise
[1:01] God so there is a power and a testimony
[1:03] so thank you sister for doing it praise

[1:28] the old Covenant but we're under a New
[1:30] Covenant with better promises praise God
[1:32] if you could worship God like this under
[1:34] an old Covenant what about the New
[1:36] Covenant what about the blood of Jesus

[4:11] two or three he said I'm gathering right
[4:13] there in the midst praise God and so
[4:16] we're grateful for that God's promises
[4:18] can never fail praise God hallelujah
[4:22] I believe that's it for the
[4:23] announcements if I'm not mistaken here
[4:27] so we'll just preach here part six uh it
[4:30] was wonderful uh you know Wednesday we
[4:32] looked at part five and brother amen uh
[4:34] do you want to testify real quick just
[4:35] what happened there could you just tell
[4:36] the Saints what happened while we were
[4:37] worshiping there
[4:58] I also felt it one inside my heart
[5:02] my heart and I was I felt to come upon
[5:05] me the Lord come upon me and I was
[5:07] really nervous and very scared so I I
[5:10] didn't act on it the first time and then
[5:12] Pastor Jesse kept on praying
[5:14] and praying and I just kept on agreeing
[5:16] with everything he was saying
[5:18] and I and then they came again and
[5:21] that's when I felt the Holy Spirit fall
[5:23] apart amen amen
[5:26] friends the spirit of God is here
[5:29] Hallelujah
[5:31] there's another example you know how
[5:32] many times have we felt the wind of the
[5:34] Holy Spirit
[5:35] the spirit of God is here praise God and
[5:37] we just got to get into the channel of
[5:39] the Holy Spirit we just got to yield to
[5:41] the Holy Ghost and let the Holy Ghost
[5:43] have his way
[5:45] I was so blessed by that brother thank
[5:46] you for sharing that testimony let's
[5:47] give Brothers amen thank you sir I
[5:50] appreciate you sharing that buddy
[5:52] that's a confirmation of what the word
[5:54] of God that was preached and the songs
[5:57] that we sang you know that you that the
[5:59] Lord LED you to sing so we want to be
[6:01] more aware of God's spirit Among Us amen
[6:04] and I'm going to look at that here today
[6:06] with part six we'll look a little bit
[6:08] further at that but we just want to
[6:10] recognize that there is Supernatural
[6:12] going around moving at all times
[6:15] and we'll see if we're in the channel
[6:16] the Holy Spirit praise God how many want
[6:19] to be in that channel praise God
[6:20] hallelujah so
[6:23] it's just very encouraging to me you
[6:24] know to know that God is moving here and
[6:27] God wants to move
[6:29] uh you know I was looking there verse
[6:31] verse chapter or verse 4 in chapter 149
[6:34] it says for the lord taketh pleasure in
[6:36] his people so right after the Bible says
[6:38] praise him with a dance the Bible said
[6:40] God takes pleasure in his people
[6:43] God loves when you worship him God loves
[6:46] when you sing his Praises God loves when
[6:48] you say a sincere prayer or you raise
[6:50] your hands or you cry or you seek God's
[6:53] face God loves to be worshiped God loves
[6:56] to have that communion with you praise
[6:58] God
[6:58] don't ever let the devil tell you no
[7:00] it's useless it's not useless praise God
[7:02] it's actually the desire of God's heart
[7:05] amen
[7:06] when you're seeking God and praising God
[7:08] it's the desire of both your heart and
[7:10] his heart praise God and then we know
[7:12] God will pour out his blessings to you
[7:14] as you Worship the Lord as you spend
[7:17] time in his presence he pours out
[7:19] blessings Hallelujah and so I just want
[7:21] to encourage everybody to praise His
[7:23] name because God takes pleasure in you
[7:26] this morning praise God
[7:28] so we did our verse here and I want to
[7:30] uh just go back if you would let's take
[7:32] your Bible let's go to back to second
[7:34] Samuel chapter six I've just kind of I
[7:36] want to go back here and reiterate a few
[7:37] things here remember Church David danced
[7:40] twice before the ark and on Wednesday
[7:42] night we saw what the ark represented
[7:44] the ark represented God's strength it
[7:46] represented God's glory it represented
[7:49] God's presence it represented God's name
[7:51] it represents the presence of God
[7:54] hallelujah and uh David was so elated he
[7:58] was so joyful brother man said he was
[8:00] just so happy
[8:01] that the presence of God was coming into
[8:04] the city of God hallelujah God's
[8:07] presence getting in God's City praise
[8:09] God and this would also be called the
[8:11] city of David so David said David was
[8:13] basically saying the prince of God is
[8:15] coming to my life amen hallelujah the
[8:18] prince of God is coming to my house
[8:19] hallelujah how many want him to come to
[8:21] your house praise God
[8:22] just don't come to our church we want
[8:24] God in the church but we want God in our
[8:26] house amen hallelujah
[8:27] and so David was rejoicing that God's
[8:30] presence was coming to his house in
[8:32] other words he was going to live in The
[8:34] Prince of God hallelujah church so often
[8:37] we just get comfortable living in the
[8:38] regular natural presence but we want to
[8:40] live in the Supernatural presence of
[8:42] Jesus Christ
[8:44] Hallelujah we want to live in the
[8:46] Supernatural aspect where we know God is
[8:48] moving and God is changing hearts and
[8:50] God's dealing with people and God is
[8:52] bringing about victories in people's
[8:54] lives amen God is changing situations
[8:56] God is going to get the glory god is
[8:59] going to accomplish his will on this
[9:00] Earth praise God and we want to be a
[9:03] part of it praise God we want to be a
[9:04] part of yielding to God and also letting
[9:07] God use us for his purposes and for his
[9:10] glory and so David finds himself in this
[9:13] position he's he's King now over all of
[9:16] Israel of course for seven years he was
[9:18] King over Hebron only you know Southern
[9:20] Judah
[9:22] but then you know seven years later the
[9:24] rest of the tribes get the anointing
[9:26] right remember the men of uh the men of
[9:28] Manasseh they were men of understanding
[9:30] and they knew what the timing of timing
[9:33] was the Bible said they had
[9:34] understanding of the times and seasons
[9:36] and they said this is the time to make
[9:38] David King over all of Israel praise God
[9:40] they recognize the time in other words
[9:43] we'll say like this this is the time to
[9:44] let God rule all your life praise God
[9:46] there's never going to be a better time
[9:49] than right now to let the spirit of God
[9:51] rule over your entire life praise God
[9:53] let me say like this it ain't going to
[9:55] get any easier to serve God it's going
[9:56] to get harder but so let's let's start
[9:58] right now by giving God everything we
[10:00] have let's give him every heir of our
[10:02] life Hallelujah let's let him rule over
[10:04] every part of our life Hallelujah and
[10:06] can keep it up and continue it and walk
[10:08] in the Supernatural of God hallelujah oh
[10:11] my oh it's beautiful David said I want
[10:14] to live in The Prince of God hallelujah
[10:16] verse one second Samuel 6 verse one
[10:18] again David gathered together all the
[10:20] chosen men of Israel 30 000.
[10:24] you talk about a Revival
[10:26] I'm not gonna we'd actually have a
[10:28] couple churches we're gonna have 30 000
[10:30] people for this revival
[10:31] Hallelujah and David erosion went with
[10:34] all the people that were with him from
[10:36] bael of Judah to bring up from thence
[10:38] the Ark of God whose name is called by
[10:41] the name of the Lord of hosts that dwelt
[10:43] between the cherubims and they set the
[10:45] Ark of God upon a new cart that was the
[10:47] big mistake
[10:49] the Ark of God the prince of God was not
[10:51] to come on beasts
[10:54] the prince of God doesn't anoint beasts
[10:56] like that right it's to be carried by
[10:58] Levites it's to be carried by ministers
[11:01] amen
[11:03] is to be carried by God's servants
[11:05] Hallelujah not a beast not a filthy
[11:07] Beast or even an unclean or even a clean
[11:09] Beast it's not to be carried by a clean
[11:11] Beast it's be carried by God's servants
[11:14] who are devoted to his service that are
[11:16] faithful praise God they met the
[11:18] requirements amen you met the
[11:20] requirements because the blood of Jesus
[11:21] Christ brought you into the body of
[11:23] Christ Hallelujah
[11:25] in other words your call to carry the
[11:27] anointing amen you're called to carry
[11:29] the word of God upon the fleshly tables
[11:32] of your heart praise God
[11:34] Hallelujah
[11:36] that's the big mistake they put on a new
[11:38] car brother I said it's a denomination
[11:40] see or we'd say a Creed or we'll just
[11:43] say it like brother bam said any
[11:44] deviation from the word of God is one
[11:46] step away from the Holy Spirit
[11:49] so this new card could be uh just one
[11:52] sin you allow in your life one addiction
[11:54] or one complex
[11:56] right just one new car just one mistake
[12:00] everything else was great everything
[12:01] else was good in his life except this
[12:03] one thing this new car this new uh say
[12:06] like this this new uh this new sin this
[12:10] new fault uh this this new attraction
[12:12] whatever it was something new came in
[12:15] and it broke the the The Fellowship Of
[12:17] God it broke the communion it broke the
[12:20] obedience praise God but we've got to
[12:22] make sure all of our life is lined up
[12:24] with God's word we got to make sure
[12:25] everything in our life is obey obeying
[12:27] the holy scriptures praise God we can't
[12:29] let nothing new get into our lives that
[12:31] breaks our fellowship with Christ
[12:35] and they brought it out of the house of
[12:37] abinadab that was in gibea and uza and
[12:41] Ohio the sons of abinadab draved the new
[12:44] cart and they brought it out of the
[12:46] house of abinadab which was at gibia
[12:48] accompanying the Ark of God and Ohio
[12:49] went before the ark and David and all
[12:52] the house of Israel played before the
[12:53] Lord on all manner of instruments made
[12:55] of furwood even of harps and on sultries
[12:58] and timbros and on cornets and on
[13:00] symbols imagine the there's a percussion
[13:02] right there's the percussion you got the
[13:04] percussion you got the strings
[13:05] Hallelujah
[13:07] and David and the the people play with
[13:09] all their might
[13:12] verse six and they came to the Nay
[13:14] nachans threshing for uza put forth his
[13:17] hand to the Ark of God and took hold of
[13:19] it for the ox and shook it and the anger
[13:21] Lord was kindled against uza and God
[13:24] smote him there for his Heir and there
[13:26] he died before the ark again we're not
[13:29] to touch the Ark of God right they
[13:31] weren't to touch the Ark of God unless
[13:33] they were the high priest
[13:35] the high priest was the only one who
[13:37] could approach it praise God nobody else
[13:38] could approach it in this in this case
[13:40] it's being brought into Jerusalem it's
[13:42] covered with the badger skins
[13:43] but he reached out and touched it and he
[13:45] wasn't allowed to touch it
[13:47] this is this is what brother Randall
[13:49] said this is what happens when man puts
[13:51] his hand on the move of the spirit
[13:53] like you can't dance in the spirit
[13:56] you can't shout you can't speak in
[13:58] tongues you shouldn't you shouldn't run
[14:00] around the church
[14:01] Hallelujah listen death happens when man
[14:05] puts his hand on the move of the spirit
[14:07] but God wants to have his way praise God
[14:11] we got to let God have his way but when
[14:13] a man tries to touch the move of the
[14:15] spirit it brings death someone gets
[14:18] their feet and someone gets discouraged
[14:19] right someone gets depressed someone
[14:22] falls into sin
[14:23] it's because man put their hand on it
[14:25] but God got angry and said don't touch
[14:28] it you're not to touch it only certain
[14:30] men can touch your praise God there's
[14:32] only certain times you can touch it
[14:33] there's a certain there's a way in the
[14:35] prince of God we have no denominations
[14:38] praise God we don't add to the word of
[14:40] God we don't try to uh regulate when the
[14:44] Holy Spirit can move the Holy Spirit can
[14:45] fall right now during the preaching amen
[14:48] in fact that's what happened when the
[14:49] First Time Peter preached the Gentiles
[14:51] amen he couldn't even finish his servant
[14:53] the Bible said while Peters make these
[14:55] words the Holy Ghost fell on them that
[14:58] heard the word of God
[15:00] could he make it through the sermon amen
[15:02] the spirit of God interrupted because
[15:04] the people believed it they received it
[15:06] they they they had faith in the word of
[15:08] God that Peter was saying God grant us
[15:10] Faith to believe every promised word
[15:12] hallelujah
[15:14] amen
[15:17] God smote him for his Heir and there he
[15:19] died by the Ark of God
[15:24] now if you go down to verse 11 the Ark
[15:26] of Lord continue to the house of Obed
[15:27] Edom to get tight for three months and
[15:29] the Lord bless Obed Edom and Oz
[15:32] household so see wherever there's a
[15:35] sincere heart wherever there's someone
[15:36] who wants to obey the word of God God
[15:38] will bless that house
[15:40] Hallelujah
[15:41] but God will not bless beasts carrying
[15:44] the Ark of God
[15:45] will not bless men touching the move of
[15:48] the spirit who are not ordained to do
[15:51] that
[15:52] Hallelujah God cannot bless that
[15:56] but remember you had all the worship all
[15:58] the dance all the praise all the
[16:00] musicians praise God
[16:03] but three months later
[16:05] uh we know that David got the scripture
[16:09] right uh if you go to First Chronicles
[16:12] 13 one we might as well read it now
[16:14] first Chronicles 13 1.
[16:24] so here was David's main mistake
[16:27] and brother man brings us out of course
[16:29] and trying new God of service that's the
[16:30] first uh sermon I think I ever gave his
[16:33] sister a lady right there when we was in
[16:35] football and I was there at uh I was
[16:37] there at football camp
[16:38] and I was just reading my Bible I had
[16:40] really no friends on the team there's a
[16:41] hundred guys on the team and I had
[16:42] really no friends on the team
[16:44] so we'd have breakfast lunch and supper
[16:46] I'm there sitting by myself I'm just
[16:47] reading you know they're probably
[16:49] studying their well they're they're just
[16:50] listening to all their rap and
[16:51] everything like that I'm there at the
[16:52] table I'm eating I just got my Bible
[16:53] open and brother random sermons there
[16:57] well I looked ridiculous but
[17:00] to the world but to God God was well
[17:01] pleased and a lady and two other guys
[17:03] come up and said
[17:05] what are you reading we're we're
[17:06] Christians what are you reading I'm like
[17:08] oh I'm reading about God trying to do
[17:10] his service I think I was studying on
[17:12] tongues and interpretation and tongues
[17:14] not the evidence of the Holy Ghost and
[17:15] like oh really
[17:16] I said well yeah if you're interested
[17:18] let me know I'd like to share it with
[17:19] you
[17:20] and so sister lady's like yeah I miss
[17:21] her said so I gave her that tape God
[17:23] trying to or David trying to do God of
[17:25] service without it being his will
[17:27] and she loved it and then she started
[17:29] coming to church you know for all those
[17:30] years she come so that was the that was
[17:32] the tape that I think she first heard if
[17:34] I'm not mistaken
[17:36] it's a great a great uh great message
[17:38] there
[17:39] so here's the problem David's problem
[17:41] was he consulted the wrong people
[17:43] and David consulted with the captains of
[17:46] thousands and hundreds and with every
[17:48] leader
[17:49] so he consulted more with the people
[17:51] rather than the word of God he should
[17:54] have consulted the word and the word
[17:56] would have said don't put it on the cart
[17:59] don't put a man don't put it on beasts
[18:02] right we're not going to be able to work
[18:04] up our own human strength to bring this
[18:06] revival amen we've got to consult the
[18:08] word of God hallelujah
[18:10] we've got to see what the what does the
[18:12] word of God say praise God hallelujah
[18:15] so he consulted here's the mistake he
[18:17] consults the people more than he should
[18:20] he should have consolid the word instead
[18:22] praise God and George anytime that we
[18:24] consult the word first the people will
[18:26] follow
[18:27] brother when we preach we have nothing
[18:29] to worry about if we just preach the
[18:30] word if they're the elect of God they'll
[18:32] follow praise God hallelujah because we
[18:34] consult the word first Hallelujah
[18:37] I don't consult the people first of all
[18:39] what do you think I should preach well
[18:40] that might be nice if we were doing a
[18:41] Bible study but if I'm studying to
[18:43] preach and feed your soul I consult God
[18:45] I I spend time in God's presence and see
[18:48] what God puts on my heart and then I
[18:49] come out here and preach it and if
[18:51] you're God's people you'll love God's
[18:53] word amen
[18:54] we consult the word of God first
[18:56] Hallelujah
[18:59] so now we see why David failed he
[19:01] consulted man instead of the word of God
[19:05] now was he off by much no he wasn't off
[19:08] by much he was only off by a new car
[19:10] that was the only thing that he missed
[19:12] of course we know he wrote scripture
[19:14] right he was all about the scripture he
[19:15] was singing the scripture he was writing
[19:17] the scripture he was prophesying he was
[19:20] a mighty man you know he's a leader of
[19:22] the mighty man he was a giant slayer he
[19:24] was all these things praise God but here
[19:26] he missed this one aspect he consulted
[19:29] the people more than he consulted God
[19:31] may God help us to consult the word with
[19:34] every question in our lives
[19:36] because we really got to be careful not
[19:37] to get comfortable in our Christian
[19:39] Walks With God because the moment we get
[19:42] comfortable that's when the enemy will
[19:43] come around and lay a trap for us
[19:46] all right and we'll fail to really
[19:47] consult the word we'll fail to really
[19:49] pray about it
[19:51] right we will fail to really pray before
[19:54] we make some certain decisions but
[19:57] really prayer is the key for victory in
[19:59] those decisions
[20:01] prayer waiting on the Lord Consulting
[20:04] God's word first before we consult
[20:06] anybody else praise God
[20:10] all right so you got that now
[20:12] and now let's go back to uh second
[20:13] Samuel 6.
[20:17] now I'm going down in the middle of
[20:18] verse 12. so David went and brought up
[20:20] the Ark of God from the house of Odom
[20:22] Edom into the city of David with
[20:24] gladness now look now he's glad before
[20:27] he was afraid so look at verse 9 and
[20:30] David was afraid of the Lord that day
[20:31] and said how shall the Ark of the Lord
[20:33] come to me oh what a blessing what a
[20:35] what a principle this is church we're
[20:37] afraid when we don't have the word of
[20:39] God but when we got the word of God
[20:40] we're glad Hallelujah when we can look
[20:43] at the Bible and point at this Bible and
[20:46] say I'm doing what the Bible said that
[20:48] shall make us glad Hallelujah
[20:50] we're not just guessing well I think I'm
[20:52] going to try this with our Bible over
[20:54] here collecting dust but no brother bear
[20:55] said we need our Bibles open Hallelujah
[20:58] we need to be laying in front of our
[20:59] Bibles praying seeking the will of God
[21:01] that's how we'll consult the Lord and
[21:03] that's how we'll be glad when we make
[21:05] decisions
[21:09] that's exactly right
[21:11] so he brings it up with joy
[21:13] oh it's beautiful
[21:16] verse 13 and it was so that when they
[21:19] bear the Arkham Lord had gone six Paces
[21:21] he sacrificed oxen and fatlings and
[21:24] David danced before the Lord with all of
[21:26] his might
[21:28] and Dave was gerding with the linen
[21:30] ephod there he's priests right brother
[21:31] Jose after 32 years that's what God
[21:33] showed you
[21:34] Prophet priests and King amen
[21:37] and so Dave and all the house of Israel
[21:39] brought up the Ark of Lord was shouting
[21:40] and with the sound of a trumpet you tell
[21:43] me that they're gonna shout under uh
[21:46] animal blood and the law and 613 laws
[21:51] and we're not going to shout under the
[21:52] blood of Jesus Christ
[21:54] God's own son
[21:56] you're going to tell me they're going to
[21:57] shout under animals dying and all of us
[21:59] cringe when we think about our animals
[22:00] dying like who wouldn't cringe like oh
[22:02] you're gonna take my precious pet you're
[22:03] gonna take my animal
[22:05] they could shout under dying animals
[22:07] about the glory of God and then we can't
[22:09] shout we ought to be the loudest
[22:11] shouters amen
[22:12] hallelujah praise God because we've got
[22:14] a better sacrifice a once and for all
[22:17] sacrifice praise God we've got better
[22:19] promises amen hallelujah we've got more
[22:22] power Hallelujah we've got more ability
[22:24] and more discernment to discern the word
[22:27] of God hallelujah and to be able to
[22:28] consult the word of God we've got so
[22:30] much more to reference we have so much
[22:32] knowledge that we can harness for our
[22:34] for for our good and ultimately for
[22:37] God's glory God help us to shout and
[22:39] praise the Lord amen
[22:41] hallelujah I hope I do it all the days
[22:43] of my life amen
[22:45] and if it bothers people then you really
[22:47] uh you're really going to be surprised
[22:49] when you switch over to the other side
[22:51] because it's uh this is the quietest
[22:53] place you're ever going to be at
[22:55] like brother man said he said they're
[22:56] screaming and screaming and and and
[22:58] there's torment and hell but then when
[23:01] you get to heaven there's all the Angels
[23:02] shouting holy holy holy this is the
[23:05] quietest place you've ever gonna be so
[23:07] God help us to get this beer once in a
[23:09] while and really shout and see the
[23:11] Praises of God
[23:13] ah thank God Amen
[23:17] thank you Jesus
[23:21] not only did he shout verse 16 and the
[23:24] Ark of the Lord came to the city of
[23:25] David McCall Saul's daughter looked
[23:27] through a window and saw David leaping
[23:30] and dancing before the Lord and she
[23:32] despised him in her heart
[23:35] like we said on Wednesday see she was
[23:37] looking at the flesh instead of looking
[23:39] at the ark
[23:41] she's always looking at flesh always
[23:42] looking at natural things looking at
[23:44] natural things instead of spiritual
[23:46] things let's look at the spiritual
[23:48] things today
[23:49] what is God doing in the Unseen praise
[23:52] God
[23:53] what has God been doing uh we say maybe
[23:55] behind the scenes
[23:57] and yet God wants to move today let's
[24:00] look at what God is doing Hallelujah
[24:02] spiritually
[24:03] let's feel of God like we saw last week
[24:06] with sister Lina let's see if God is
[24:07] leading us to go pray for somebody
[24:08] wasn't that a great testimony sister
[24:10] Nina
[24:11] my wife said she was really glad you
[24:12] prayed for her
[24:14] Hallelujah
[24:16] or like when the wind of the spirit's
[24:18] blowing praise God let's let's go with
[24:20] it let's go with it let's Let It Blow
[24:22] Upon Us praise God hallelujah
[24:26] say church we got to be sensitive to the
[24:28] Holy Spirit praise God
[24:30] and I love that he danced both times
[24:34] because he was the first time he was
[24:36] just off one word
[24:38] the next time though he had everything
[24:39] right and he brought the word of God God
[24:41] with gladness and he rejoiced and then
[24:44] the Bible said he blessed the people
[24:49] and I love what he told his wife
[24:51] he said I was dancing in verse 21 it was
[24:54] before the Lord
[24:56] he said therefore will I play before the
[24:58] Lord
[24:59] when I see the friends of God coming
[25:01] into my city when I see the prince of
[25:03] God coming into my life I'm going to
[25:05] thank God I'm going to Rejoice I'm going
[25:07] to praise God because God's spirit is
[25:09] dwelling with me praise God
[25:11] Hallelujah
[25:13] and then he says yet I'll be more vile
[25:15] than thus in other words you've only
[25:18] you've only you know you only seen part
[25:21] of my strength
[25:22] right the Bible said he danced with all
[25:24] of his might so what what more could he
[25:26] have he must have had more praise God
[25:28] he must have got a second wind amen
[25:31] hallelujah he danced with all of his
[25:33] might but he said if you don't like that
[25:34] he said wait till you see what I do next
[25:36] praise God wait to see the worship I
[25:39] give God because I've been running from
[25:41] your dad all those years my
[25:43] I suffered for many years but now I see
[25:46] a Revival now I see spirit of God moving
[25:49] in my midst so I'm going to enjoy this
[25:50] praise God
[25:52] I didn't enjoy those 15 years of running
[25:54] from your dad I did enjoy hide it out
[25:56] Where's God where's my God does God even
[25:58] care does God even love me am I going to
[26:00] live or die now I'm in a time of Revival
[26:02] now I know I'm going to live now I know
[26:05] God's promises are sure so I'm going to
[26:07] make sure I glorify God hallelujah
[26:10] oh my God Church see we can praise God
[26:13] more once we've gone through the battles
[26:15] praise God
[26:18] they Jesus asked him who loves me more
[26:22] who's going to love me more
[26:23] the one that's forgiven the most
[26:26] not the Pharisees that thought they were
[26:28] all self-righteous and I never do
[26:30] nothing wrong Jesus said it's the woman
[26:31] that was forgiven the one who was just
[26:34] made awful mistakes
[26:36] but here she comes back notice notice
[26:38] how she comes she don't come back stiff
[26:39] and starchy she comes back crying and
[26:42] weeping on Jesus's feet
[26:44] and Jesus told him this is the one
[26:46] that's going to love me the most oh
[26:48] church we should love God for all that
[26:50] he's done for us for changing our lives
[26:52] Hallelujah from delivering us from sin
[26:54] helping us overcome we ought to be the
[26:57] ones that love God the most Hallelujah
[26:59] amen
[27:02] we ought to love God with all of our
[27:03] hearts Souls mind and strength
[27:09] Oh Glory
[27:12] I dance with all my might but I've got
[27:14] more I got a second wind Church
[27:16] that's what David was saying in other
[27:18] words you haven't seen nothing yet
[27:19] brother man liking it under this brother
[27:22] man was talking about this this
[27:23] scripture with David with him to say no
[27:25] if you don't like this he said
[27:28] wait till I do this brother man said you
[27:30] don't like the tapes I put out I'm going
[27:31] to put out more tapes
[27:33] that's how brother man uses scripture
[27:35] Hallelujah you don't like those sermons
[27:37] those those YouTube videos I'm putting
[27:39] out I'm gonna put out more like that
[27:41] or whatever God's leading you to do or
[27:44] you don't like that I got a lot more
[27:45] where that's coming from amen why
[27:47] because I've got a Living Waters behind
[27:50] me it's pushing me it's not me it's the
[27:52] waters behind me pushing me to do it
[27:54] praise God
[27:55] oh I know there's a fountain that's
[27:57] filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's
[27:59] veins amen the Fountain of God the life
[28:02] of God is flowing through me Jesus said
[28:04] if you've got the Holy Ghost he said
[28:05] you've got living water bubbling up
[28:07] inside of you
[28:09] oh my that's what we need some bubbling
[28:12] going on here today praise God
[28:14] amen some popcorn
[28:16] Hallelujah we don't need cucumbers we
[28:19] need popcorn Hallelujah we need fire
[28:21] Brands not icicles we need fire Brands
[28:24] Hallelujah
[28:25] people that have the fire of God burning
[28:28] in their hearts praise God
[28:30] not an icicle
[28:32] before God
[28:34] like I'm ashamed to raise my hands I'm
[28:36] ashamed to stand I'm ashamed to pray I'm
[28:38] ashamed to go down the altar I'm gonna
[28:39] say why are you so shame Jesus took all
[28:41] the shame away praise God
[28:43] that's why it's good news amen it's not
[28:46] bad news it's not shameful news it's
[28:48] good news praise God he died to take all
[28:51] your shame away he died to make you free
[28:53] praise God
[28:56] Hallelujah I'd be ashamed not to worship
[28:58] God
[29:00] hallelujah I'd be ashamed to come here
[29:02] and not give God praise
[29:05] I'd be ashamed to come here and be a
[29:07] stiff and starchy or any church I'd be
[29:09] ashamed to not give God glory for all
[29:11] that he's done for me Hallelujah
[29:14] oh thank you Jesus
[29:16] Hallelujah
[29:19] so there's David that's one that's the
[29:20] best artist conception I've ever seen of
[29:22] this
[29:23] can you can I even do that he's like
[29:26] this
[29:27] he's just dancing he's like dancing like
[29:29] he's just giving God praise all the
[29:32] sisters on the those are some real
[29:33] tambourines right there
[29:37] of course he's just the artist rendition
[29:39] of it so see that's the ark the ark
[29:41] would have been hidden behind the badger
[29:42] skins
[29:43] so David was worse from God the prince
[29:45] of God is here remember I preached on
[29:47] Wednesday Saul didn't want the Ark in
[29:50] this in the city
[29:52] he didn't want the prince of God
[29:54] constantly dwelling in his in his in his
[29:57] home or his habitation he didn't want to
[29:59] live in The Prince of God but we want to
[30:01] live in The Prince of God hallelujah
[30:04] we want to inquire we want to come to
[30:06] church ask questions and watch God
[30:09] answer our questions praise God
[30:12] that's David's that's David's quote from
[30:14] I think it's Psalm 25. he said one thing
[30:17] I've asked the Lord that I may dwell in
[30:19] the house of Lord all the days of my
[30:21] life that I might inquire in his holy
[30:23] Temple praise God
[30:25] see that's that's where you should go
[30:27] for your answers don't go to YouTube for
[30:28] answers
[30:29] Hallelujah don't go to magazines and
[30:32] horoscopes don't go to that come to God
[30:35] for answers amen
[30:37] come to God the Bible said come to God
[30:39] inquire in the house of God inquire the
[30:42] prince of God and Jesus will answer you
[30:44] praise God
[30:46] Hallelujah bring your questions to God
[30:48] because in the presence of God is
[30:50] fullness of joy praise God and the
[30:53] prince of God is strength and the prince
[30:54] of God is rest and the prince of God is
[30:57] the arm of the Lord amen and the arm of
[30:59] the Lord is his strength Hallelujah
[31:03] Hallelujah well I know I'm on the right
[31:05] path I got so many different
[31:06] vindications this is the right thing for
[31:07] me to preach amen I just got another one
[31:10] on Wednesday night Hallelujah
[31:12] like Brother Ray Brother Ray coming here
[31:13] he left he come back in I think
[31:15] everybody's going except Malachi
[31:17] he said the Holy Spirit told me go tell
[31:19] brother Jesse that he's preaching the
[31:21] right thing
[31:22] I said well hallelujah amen thank you
[31:24] Jesus
[31:25] that's what I want I just want to know
[31:26] I'm in the perfect will of God
[31:29] Hallelujah may God help us be like David
[31:31] praise God to be men and women after
[31:33] God's Own Heart
[31:36] now notice
[31:38] despite his failure right of not
[31:42] Consulting God in in the in the way the
[31:43] ark was be was carried he was still a
[31:46] man for God's Own Heart brother Adam
[31:48] said I don't have confidence in a man or
[31:50] woman who won't try because if they
[31:52] never try then they're they're
[31:54] neglecting their gift
[31:56] well everyone said I got more confidence
[31:58] somebody that will try to do something
[32:00] for God and yet make a mistake because
[32:02] we're all going to make mistakes
[32:05] we've never seen any pre think of any
[32:07] preacher you've ever listened to or any
[32:08] church you've ever gone to were they
[32:10] ever perfect no
[32:11] do they make mistakes yes did brother I
[32:14] make mistakes yes not with us saith the
[32:16] Lord but he made it regular human
[32:17] mistakes
[32:18] just like everybody else praise God
[32:21] so we ought to be encouraged let's not
[32:23] let's uh dwell on our fails let's dwell
[32:26] upon how can we get this right
[32:29] Hallelujah if I just disobeyed one thing
[32:31] God help me to get that one thing right
[32:33] and then watch the prince of God come
[32:35] back into my life amen
[32:37] Glory
[32:38] isn't that beautiful
[32:40] you're still a man or woman after God's
[32:43] Own Heart despite your mistakes
[32:48] and of course God was faithful God
[32:50] corrected him just like a faithful
[32:52] father corrects his son
[32:57] then three months later he was obedient
[32:59] to the word of God
[33:00] now just so you know this is of course
[33:01] the sermon brother Branham said there's
[33:03] five months and I think he got this from
[33:04] Larkin I was looking today I didn't have
[33:06] enough chance to really search it up but
[33:08] if you want to find the perfect will of
[33:09] God
[33:10] brother man said it must be his time and
[33:12] season now that's important especially
[33:13] for Divine Healing or if you're waiting
[33:15] on a soul to be saved
[33:16] sometimes you gotta wait a long time to
[33:18] see Soul saved
[33:20] right it's got to be God's time and
[33:22] season just because it doesn't happen in
[33:23] your time doesn't mean it's not God's
[33:25] will
[33:26] but you got to wait on God hallelujah
[33:28] wait for his time and season
[33:32] whatever you desire has to be in his
[33:34] word right the new cart wasn't in God's
[33:37] word
[33:38] it's got to be his person
[33:40] which these last three are kind of very
[33:42] similar uh
[33:44] so I don't really understand this fully
[33:46] but he said also the word must come
[33:48] through a prophet of course every word
[33:49] wrote in here is written by a prophet
[33:52] Hallelujah amen so any promise of God
[33:55] you're claiming it was written by a
[33:57] prophet praise God
[33:58] and then it must come by the Vindicated
[34:00] prophet okay of course that gets into
[34:02] the thought you know where uh Balaam was
[34:04] a prophet but not Vindicated as a true
[34:06] Prophet right
[34:09] and so you have these false the idea
[34:11] with the false prophets or you have the
[34:12] idea of the workers of iniquity who
[34:14] they've signed Miracles or wonders but
[34:16] they're not Vindicated real prophets
[34:17] like faithful prophets I mean true
[34:19] prophets that say true to God's word
[34:22] so just keep that in mind church when we
[34:24] desire
[34:25] to know the will of God we've got to be
[34:27] we've got to be serious about I mean
[34:28] that's a that's a big list
[34:30] like you young people who should you
[34:32] marry well that's a pretty big list
[34:33] there it's Gotta Be In God's Time and
[34:34] season
[34:36] it's got to be according to his word
[34:38] it's gonna be the right person
[34:41] right and they I guess they gotta line
[34:43] up with the prophet of God you know and
[34:45] it's got to be it's got to line up with
[34:47] God's Vindicated prophet
[34:48] It's gotta all line up with that
[34:51] right so no matter what the area of your
[34:52] life is that's that's quite a good list
[34:54] there to start with
[34:56] and you got to be humble you actually
[34:58] got to be humble to go through that and
[35:00] not just skip it David skipped one of
[35:02] those it wasn't according to the word
[35:05] the art the new cart
[35:07] he just skipped one of those churches we
[35:09] can't skip any of God's word
[35:12] right we can't skip any but we got to
[35:13] obey all the word of God
[35:19] but notice when he obeyed in all five he
[35:21] got his dance back
[35:23] he got his gladness back amen hallelujah
[35:26] he got his jewelry back he got his
[35:28] victory back praise God and church the
[35:30] same thing's true for you and I when we
[35:32] get on all obedience to the word of God
[35:34] we obey everything in that word watch
[35:36] the glory of God the joy of God the
[35:38] peace of God will come right back to you
[35:40] praise God
[35:41] Hallelujah
[35:44] now this this thought here's a the
[35:46] thought the Holy Spirit kind of gave me
[35:48] yesterday I believe while I was studying
[35:50] listen so this this this series brings
[35:54] the necessity of how we have to Worship
[35:56] in spirit and also in truth so we have
[35:59] to we have to meet two requirements
[36:01] right
[36:02] along with these along with these five
[36:03] you know these are for individual
[36:05] questions but as a church we got to have
[36:07] both the spirit and the truth
[36:10] right
[36:11] now let's read John 4 24 and you might
[36:13] jump ahead of me if you read below that
[36:14] but that's fine
[36:16] some of you always try to figure out
[36:18] where I'm going that's that's good
[36:19] that's good I like that
[36:21] John 4 24.
[36:25] it's a very important person that said
[36:26] we got to Worship in spirit and Truth a
[36:28] very important person
[36:32] Jesus Christ
[36:37] let's read uh 23. but the hour cometh
[36:40] and now is when true worshipers shall
[36:42] worship the father in spirit and in
[36:44] truth for the father seeketh such to
[36:46] worship Him
[36:48] God is a spirit and they that worship
[36:50] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[36:54] truth
[36:58] okay
[36:59] now let me just jump ahead we have to
[37:01] honestly assess ourselves
[37:04] right
[37:05] which side does Satan attack our church
[37:07] on the most
[37:10] right do we lack the truth or do we lack
[37:12] the moving of the spirit which one do
[37:14] you think
[37:15] you can go and say it out loud I'm not
[37:17] I'm not afraid
[37:19] ah yeah good brother I think I heard I
[37:20] heard one voice
[37:22] everybody's also peaceful respectful and
[37:25] fear in the Lord you know
[37:27] don't want to be wrong I know how that
[37:29] is I've said things wrong before I've
[37:31] said amen and the preacher was like uh
[37:32] that you weren't supposed to say Amen
[37:33] say Amen to that like yeah forgive me
[37:36] I'll go I'll go repent
[37:39] no church let's be honest we're in
[37:40] America right we're not in Ghana we're
[37:42] not in South Africa where they really
[37:44] dance or God know where they really get
[37:45] dancer we're just in a more
[37:50] civilized country right where there's
[37:52] not a lot of freedom
[37:54] so we're going to be battled a lot on
[37:56] the spirit
[37:57] right we got the truth boy I could
[37:59] preach the truth I could teach you this
[38:00] and teach you that that's that's good
[38:03] we have the truth but we also need the
[38:05] spirit as well
[38:08] and so we see ourselves lacking on one
[38:10] of the other
[38:11] we got to pray say God give us a better
[38:13] balance praise God
[38:15] help us to be balanced praise God now
[38:17] William and I were talking years ago I
[38:19] think our the family Williams family
[38:21] they have a lot of freedom there and to
[38:23] dance but they also have some just like
[38:25] us we have church splits here in America
[38:26] too
[38:28] because a preacher will get behind the
[38:29] pulpit and he's in the wrong Spirit he
[38:31] might blast people right
[38:33] yet you can have dancing and shouting
[38:34] and praising God and all those things
[38:36] right we
[38:37] so see there's examples where you can be
[38:40] unbalanced on one of either side but God
[38:43] wants us balanced God wants us to have
[38:44] the Holy Ghost and Truth praise God
[38:47] so I'm glad you felt the spirit of God
[38:48] on Wednesday I felt it too buddy but I
[38:50] didn't feel like that but I just felt
[38:52] empowered I just felt this is God
[38:54] I felt bold amen I kept praying you kept
[38:56] saying you're shouting amen I'm just
[39:00] thankful to know God's spirit can blow
[39:01] right through here praise God
[39:03] and may He keep blowing through here is
[39:06] my Prairie men
[39:08] let's not put up a Windbreak right I do
[39:11] not we don't want to put up a domination
[39:12] Windbreak let's cut down the
[39:14] denominational win rate flow Holy Spirit
[39:16] blow into the spirit blow through our
[39:18] church amen
[39:20] stir us up either you get us in a state
[39:22] where we're on fire amen blow upon the
[39:25] coals of our hearts amen and set our
[39:27] hearts aflame to obey the word of God
[39:29] hallelujah
[39:30] amen
[39:32] I've been honest before you I've told
[39:34] you I teach you I'm a teacher and so
[39:36] I've even this last year 2022 I said
[39:38] I've got to do a better job of preaching
[39:40] and teaching
[39:41] right I mean how many witness to that
[39:44] so that's me and my own life recognizing
[39:46] I see which side I'm more drawn to and I
[39:48] know preachers I know other preachers
[39:50] that they're more drawn to spiritual
[39:51] things oh it's got to be all
[39:52] Supernatural but they don't have good
[39:53] teaching
[39:54] and the church said
[39:56] we might have good teaching that's
[39:58] wonderful but we also got to have the
[39:59] move of the Holy Spirit
[40:02] Hallelujah but remember it's not all my
[40:04] responsibility it's all of our
[40:05] responsibility
[40:07] right brother Madison every person has
[40:10] just an equal Ministry like the pastor
[40:13] and brother bear said you got to be just
[40:15] as interested in your ministry as the
[40:17] pastor is in his ministry
[40:21] that's a good amen that's a hearty amen
[40:24] see I want to be I got to be dedicated
[40:26] to my Ministry I preach here for almost
[40:28] 17 years
[40:29] week in week out service after service
[40:31] I've given my life to this each one of
[40:34] us should find our ministry and give our
[40:35] lives to it praise God
[40:40] so think about that did you give an Hour
[40:42] of Prayer to this week's services
[40:45] or hour of study
[40:47] two hours okay I'll go up that's a
[40:50] better way to go right not down
[40:52] three hours did you give to this the the
[40:54] the the ministry this week did you
[40:56] devote three hours of prayer and study
[40:58] for our ministry to keep getting closer
[40:59] to God
[41:02] Hallelujah
[41:05] well brother Jess we're off balance okay
[41:07] well who's going to change that I can't
[41:08] do it all by myself we all got to change
[41:10] it
[41:11] every church is Satan's job to make us
[41:14] all fast every Satan's battling every
[41:16] Church to change the balance but real
[41:19] worshipers amen real worshipers God do
[41:21] you like Jesus said we got to Worship in
[41:23] the spirit and we've got to have truth
[41:25] hallelujah
[41:26] so that's that's our battle our Battle
[41:28] Is To Worship in the Holy Spirit and
[41:31] worship and Truth
[41:34] Glory
[41:36] now let me see did I uh
[41:39] now here's just just move down here on
[41:41] Wednesday I focus on this quote brother
[41:43] Adam said you know you're on fire when
[41:44] you're doing these three things you have
[41:46] a fervent desire to please God in other
[41:49] words you don't want to sin against God
[41:51] you're doing everything in your power
[41:53] not to sin against God
[41:55] in other words you're not going to
[41:56] remain in the complex
[41:58] you're not going to remain in a bad
[42:00] addiction you're not going to remain
[42:01] with evil feelings towards somebody
[42:05] Hallelujah
[42:07] see that's when you're on fire I want my
[42:09] life cleaned out by the word of God
[42:12] I want to obey God's word and then you
[42:14] have a passion to hear the preaching
[42:17] you have a passion to press play
[42:20] I listened about two hours of brother
[42:21] Ram yesterday his sermon was three
[42:22] almost four hours I didn't get a chance
[42:24] to finish the whole sermon there's a
[42:25] beautiful sermon the restoration the
[42:27] bride tree beautiful message
[42:28] beautiful ah I'm going to preach a whole
[42:32] sermon series on that just that sermon
[42:34] in particular but you got a passion in
[42:36] other words you're more excited to press
[42:37] play on the word than you are to press
[42:39] play on Instagram or whatever you know I
[42:41] don't know Facebook I used to be on
[42:42] Facebook you know
[42:44] you're more excited to go to the the
[42:45] Bible app than the Facebook app I'm not
[42:48] on Facebook anymore so
[42:50] yeah just because that's what they did
[42:51] to Trump there I thought
[42:53] Free Speech Trump's probably not even
[42:55] saved but you understand but see we
[42:57] gotta we got to make sure recognize hey
[43:00] if I'm not if I'm not if I don't have a
[43:01] passion to get in God's word something's
[43:03] wrong with me
[43:05] Hallelujah yes I've got to get my heart
[43:08] and life cleaned out Hallelujah I gotta
[43:10] get my fire back and the church said
[43:13] amen I gotta stir up the fire Hallelujah
[43:17] and then when we were praying on
[43:18] Wednesday that's what we were praying
[43:20] for remember I was praying let's reach
[43:22] out in the spirit let's ask God for
[43:24] miracles
[43:25] let's ask God to save souls and
[43:28] Hallelujah let's ask God to fill each
[43:30] one of us with the Holy Ghost praise God
[43:33] Glory
[43:37] see we got to have this balance we got
[43:39] to have
[43:40] reaching out in the spirit
[43:42] Desiring God Reach Out And Touch the
[43:43] Lord as he passes by you'll find he's
[43:46] not too busy to hear your hearts cry
[43:49] he's passing by this moment your need to
[43:51] supply
[43:52] Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he
[43:53] passes by Pass Me Not O Gentle Savior
[43:56] hear my humble cry while on others Thou
[43:58] Art calling do not pass me by
[44:01] Hallelujah
[44:03] see this is this is what we need in our
[44:05] lives we gotta we constantly have to
[44:07] stay balanced I find it myself you find
[44:09] in your life we all should be able to
[44:11] say Amen to that praise God there's an
[44:13] order for being on fire these three
[44:15] areas of our life and Satan's always
[44:17] going to battle us with this and so see
[44:20] we've got to reach out to to the spirit
[44:21] in prayer
[44:23] and see which side is he attacking us on
[44:27] what is he trying to get us uh to relax
[44:29] on is it having the spirit in our church
[44:32] or having the truth in our church
[44:35] he's often good he's often attacking us
[44:38] with the spiritual things
[44:41] how many kids Amen to that
[44:44] yes
[44:46] and so you see this idea of spirit and
[44:49] Truth Eli and Israel they had the ark
[44:53] and they thought just because we have
[44:54] the ark
[44:56] we're going to go up and defeat the
[44:57] Philistines remember what happened the
[44:59] Philistines whipped them
[45:02] even though they had the friends of God
[45:04] well they have the spirit
[45:06] but they weren't living in the truth
[45:09] they're letting those two priests steal
[45:11] the meat for God uh blaspheming God's
[45:14] sacrifices they were sleeping with other
[45:15] men's wives
[45:17] they weren't living the truth the ark
[45:20] was there the the spirit of God was
[45:21] there the presence of God was in the
[45:23] camp but they were not living the truth
[45:25] God help us to live the truth amen
[45:29] now see we could read through all these
[45:30] this could be a whole another sermon you
[45:31] know this let's focus on that David
[45:34] David had the uh David had the spirit
[45:36] but he didn't have truth
[45:38] praise God
[45:41] and even the Galatians Paul saw them
[45:44] starting going towards legalism
[45:47] and then he said uh I he said I I fear
[45:50] that maybe you're not born again he said
[45:52] do I have to come and travail again to
[45:54] see if you're born of the spirit let's
[45:56] go to Galatians 3 verse one let's read
[45:58] death I kind of feel led to read that
[45:59] Galatians 3 verse 1.
[46:07] now while you're turning there think
[46:09] about uh
[46:10] Vindicated Miracles that you've seen
[46:13] where something supernatural has
[46:15] instantly happened I'm talking an
[46:17] instant miracle
[46:19] instant not Divine Healing but it takes
[46:22] of course over time but an instant
[46:24] healing
[46:27] that's what we need in the church
[46:30] because there's nine gifts that's one of
[46:32] them
[46:33] Miracles are instant right now
[46:36] God's spirit moves God's hand reaches
[46:39] down Miracle time amen Miracle meeting
[46:42] Hallelujah
[46:45] amen I was trying to think about my life
[46:46] you know the woman with the uh
[46:49] kidney stone that was instant
[46:52] instant
[46:54] uh some of those other prayer requests I
[46:55] prayed for brother Clement's wife down
[46:57] there in Columbus instant like she was
[46:59] it's on tape she's jumping and shouting
[47:01] and screaming when I pray for her she
[47:02] got healed of like four things at one
[47:03] time her knee her back I mean all the
[47:05] nerves all these things at one time
[47:08] instant
[47:11] Galatians 3 verse 1. Oh foolish
[47:13] Galatians who hath Bewitched you that
[47:14] you should not obey the truth
[47:17] so what are they lacking here what's
[47:18] what's Satan battling them on truth they
[47:21] wouldn't obey the truth
[47:24] that you uh that I'm sorry before whose
[47:27] eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently
[47:29] set forth crucified among you this only
[47:31] would I learn of you received you the
[47:33] spirit ye the Spirit by The Works of the
[47:36] law or by the hearing of Faith how did
[47:38] you get Born Again by The Law of the law
[47:40] of the law or just hearing and believing
[47:43] the church said
[47:47] see they were starting to bring
[47:48] legalistic well I've got to do this and
[47:50] I've got to do that and Paul said that's
[47:52] not how God's spirit moves God's spirit
[47:54] moves you here you act you obey and God
[47:57] blesses amen
[48:00] hallelujah praise God
[48:02] see what he's saying is all the Old
[48:04] Testament had to go through remember the
[48:05] Waters of Separation they had to go
[48:07] through seven days to get clean but
[48:09] church you can be clean like that
[48:12] thank God thank God Revenge I don't have
[48:15] to wait till next Sunday to be clean
[48:16] right
[48:17] if I'm unclean today you know you
[48:18] somebody would sprinkle me with water it
[48:20] I'd wait seven days when am I finally
[48:22] clean I'm finally clean praise God
[48:25] but we got better promises hallelujah
[48:27] amen think about that church you can
[48:30] walk in here unclean and walk out
[48:31] spotless Hallelujah
[48:34] spotless Before the Throne of God with
[48:37] no condemnation because you're in Christ
[48:39] Hallelujah
[48:41] amen
[48:42] how did you get the Holy Ghost was it by
[48:44] all your laws or was it by hearing and
[48:48] believing
[48:49] it was hearing and believing
[48:52] so simple right verse three are you so
[48:55] foolish having begun the spirit are you
[48:57] now made perfect by the flesh see that
[48:58] gotten away from the spirit and the
[49:00] truth here
[49:02] verse 4 have you suffered so many things
[49:04] in vain if it be yet in vain look at
[49:07] verse 5. he therefore that ministereth
[49:09] to you the spirit and worketh miracles
[49:11] among you do doeth yet by The Works of
[49:14] the law or by the hearing of faith
[49:17] see how Faith works with faith faith is
[49:21] the substance you need to work a miracle
[49:25] faith is a revelation the will of God
[49:27] right
[49:28] faith means trust also so we have faith
[49:32] we have trust in God
[49:34] okay so when someone Works a miracle God
[49:36] has shown them something God has shown
[49:38] them what's going to happen so they
[49:39] trust God and they go work a miracle so
[49:41] one time I prayed for this woman brother
[49:42] there in Guyana and she had a baby she's
[49:45] holding a baby you should have a kidney
[49:46] stone so I prayed for her
[49:48] we were both weeping and crying she went
[49:49] back
[49:50] and she said wash you I saw her while
[49:52] she was there singing she was praising
[49:53] God she started crying and worshiping
[49:55] God she said the Holy Ghost went to
[49:56] wherever her kidney stone was and I'm
[49:58] not sure where the kidneys are
[50:00] need to go back to anatomy class
[50:02] and she said she found a hot anointing
[50:04] there and then it shot down out of her
[50:06] leg and she had no more kidney stone
[50:09] right my mom's had a kidney stone a
[50:10] couple years ago she said it was the
[50:11] most awful pains in her life right
[50:14] so that was a bona fide Miracle it
[50:16] wasn't like well it's going to take a
[50:17] couple weeks to heal
[50:18] it was instant
[50:20] praise God
[50:24] and so these Galatians had people among
[50:27] them that were walking in the spirit and
[50:29] truth and they would do Miracles and
[50:32] they do Miracles by feeling led to the
[50:34] Holy Spirit to do something there it is
[50:36] amen yes sir
[50:52] um
[50:54] all right let's thank the Lord for that
[50:56] brother I was praying I gave that
[50:58] envelope to him I was praying for
[51:00] Supernatural today
[51:01] and I said let us have dreams and
[51:03] visions and all these things
[51:12] hallelujah praise God let's read that
[51:15] brother let's go to Acts chapter two
[51:16] we're done with Galatians 3 there
[51:18] Hallelujah
[51:23] Acts chapter 2. verse 15 Acts 2 15. so
[51:26] brother Chrisman the Holy Ghost fell
[51:28] this is what he promised to he promised
[51:29] to send dreams Visions in other words
[51:32] all the gifts of the Holy Spirit
[51:35] Acts 2 15. for these are not drunken as
[51:38] ye supposed thing is but the third hour
[51:40] of the day
[51:41] but this is that which was spoken by the
[51:43] prophet Joel and it shall come to pass
[51:45] in the last day saith God I will pour
[51:47] out my spirit upon All Flesh let's see
[51:50] all nations
[51:52] and your sons I'm so glad I got sons and
[51:54] daughters
[51:55] I got Sons I got two sons not one son
[51:58] your sons and your daughters shall
[52:02] prophesy and your young men shall see
[52:04] visions and your old men shall dream
[52:05] dreams and on my servants and all my
[52:07] handmaids I will pour out in those days
[52:09] of my spirit and they shall prophesy
[52:13] amen
[52:14] so these are some of the effects of the
[52:17] Holy Ghost God's going to pour out
[52:19] dreams
[52:20] God's going to pour out visions and the
[52:22] church said
[52:24] God is going to pour out all these gifts
[52:26] upon the people so you just gotta we
[52:28] just got to be in a position where he
[52:30] can pour it out on us praise God
[52:32] we've got to make sure we're ready for
[52:34] him to pour it out because the Bible
[52:36] said they could not do many wonderful
[52:38] works because of their unbelief
[52:40] so we got to be in a place of believing
[52:42] I believe it's for me the Holy Ghost is
[52:45] for me dreams are for me Visions are for
[52:48] me Miracles are for me The Supernaturals
[52:51] for me Hallelujah
[52:53] it's for me of a son of God
[52:56] I I'm a son of the Living God hallelujah
[52:59] I'm one of God's children Hallelujah I'm
[53:02] the smallest people on the beach but I'm
[53:04] a pebble Hallelujah
[53:06] I'm one of them praise God I'm so glad I
[53:09] can say I'm one of them praise God
[53:13] so he said he's going to pour out dreams
[53:14] on me visions
[53:16] that's what God Said
[53:18] I didn't say that that's what God Said
[53:20] it's all I have to do is be in a
[53:22] position
[53:24] to prophesy like I pray for sister zern
[53:26] in 2021 I said may this year be the year
[53:29] she comes back and she came back in that
[53:31] year God bless you sir I sure appreciate
[53:34] you you're really answered our prayers
[53:36] amen
[53:37] Hallelujah
[53:39] the Holy Spirit shall prophesy
[53:41] Hallelujah
[53:43] oh it's so true
[53:45] but see we've got to be constantly
[53:47] reaching out
[53:49] to the spirit right we're in America
[53:50] we're going to be the ones where we need
[53:52] more spirit
[53:54] you know Church we're one of the few
[53:55] Nations on this Earth that has the mess
[53:57] all the messages uh translated for us
[54:00] I was talking to people overseas and
[54:02] they're like huh I didn't know brother
[54:03] Ram said that I didn't even know he's
[54:04] had that sermon
[54:05] and here we are we got all these tapes
[54:07] and church are we using them like we
[54:09] should
[54:09] let's do better with that
[54:12] they don't some of them don't even have
[54:14] the church age book which that would be
[54:15] a huge shame if they didn't have that
[54:17] so they were missing key sermons they
[54:20] need to understand the word of God so
[54:21] there's still some of their areas where
[54:23] they don't have all the truth they still
[54:24] got denominational teachings
[54:27] because they don't have translations
[54:28] Jose knows that right they would brother
[54:31] what when you got it when you got a
[54:33] message book what did you do with it
[54:34] when you first come in the message what
[54:36] how did you have to share with everybody
[54:37] and make copies and everything
[54:40] yeah they do
[54:50] they would travel
[54:51] they would travel around just to get one
[54:53] book church and we got an app we can
[54:55] have it in one minute and do we spend
[54:57] time in it like we ought to
[54:59] no we don't so we got to do better on
[55:00] that praise God
[55:02] we have so much truth but what we need
[55:05] over here is the spirit praise God
[55:07] hallelujah that's what we need we got to
[55:10] Worship in spirit and in truth praise
[55:12] God
[55:13] Hallelujah
[55:15] and this is like we said on Wednesday if
[55:16] you didn't hear Wednesday's service go
[55:17] listen to it it's a wonderful message
[55:18] and wonderful worship and everything
[55:20] but brother random said the cycle of
[55:22] death or Revival is undeniable it's
[55:24] something we're all going to experience
[55:26] we're going to wake up and if we're not
[55:28] in Revival we're gonna say well I have
[55:30] to get into Revival today
[55:32] I don't feel revived so I've got to go
[55:34] through this cycle again same thing over
[55:37] and over again you know they had that
[55:38] idea about Groundhog Day where the same
[55:40] thing happens over and over again when I
[55:42] was out in the world well that's kind of
[55:43] how the Christian Life is the same thing
[55:45] again and again I got to go through this
[55:47] again I've got to come up my soul don't
[55:49] you get shy on me I love that song Amen
[55:51] you got to stir yourself up again oh God
[55:53] stir me up help me to get in the spirit
[55:55] let me not be in the flesh let me be in
[55:57] the spirit praise God
[56:00] it's a constant cycle which I have to
[56:02] put myself in a position where God can
[56:04] use me
[56:08] so what are the main requirements go
[56:09] back to Acts chapter 2 since we're the
[56:11] Acts chapter 2 verse ones I just want
[56:12] great brother Chris to see this too and
[56:14] it's a great reminder for all of us you
[56:15] know brother cam has this uh scripture
[56:18] part of the scripture uh I think right
[56:19] when they walk in the sanctuary on the
[56:21] back door or on the back wall rather
[56:22] which of course is the back door of the
[56:24] sanctuary
[56:25] Acts 2 verse 1.
[56:29] and when the day of Pentecost was fully
[56:31] come they were all with one Accord and
[56:33] in one place and then suddenly there
[56:35] came this wind suddenly
[56:37] it suddenly came to us on Wednesday
[56:39] night amen
[56:40] Hallelujah
[56:42] suddenly
[56:44] see it takes Unity we got to be in one
[56:46] place hey we got that bar taken care of
[56:48] now we got to get in one Accord
[56:50] Hallelujah
[56:51] one mind one desire praise God
[56:54] and their desire was Lord send the
[56:57] promise of the father
[56:59] send the promise to the father God bless
[57:00] you send the promise of the father Jesus
[57:03] Promised it he told us to go wait for
[57:05] the Holy Ghost he told us to go wait in
[57:07] Jerusalem here we are waiting we're just
[57:09] waiting for the promise amen
[57:12] Hallelujah
[57:14] so it took Unity
[57:16] it took humility brother random said
[57:20] and then it took prayer for the spirit
[57:22] to fall
[57:24] so we're talking about spirit and truth
[57:26] right
[57:27] if we need more of the spirit what do we
[57:29] got to do what the Bible says we've got
[57:30] to Humble ourselves
[57:33] be unified and then pray
[57:36] one man can't do it all don't expect me
[57:39] to do all you're praying for you
[57:42] I'm trying to do more prayer for me
[57:44] and you but I can't do all the praying
[57:47] for you
[57:48] eat
[57:49] each there's 120 people and everybody
[57:52] did their part amen oh
[57:54] we don't even have half of that
[57:56] so we can do it by God's grace all
[57:58] things are possible to them that believe
[58:00] amen
[58:02] Hallelujah we just each have to do our
[58:05] part brother sister we just got to
[58:07] believe God's promises we've got to pray
[58:09] for the spirit praise God we've got to
[58:10] Humble ourselves and not care of
[58:13] anybody's Watching All We Care is that
[58:15] God is watching amen

[1:01:03] Glory thank you Jesus remember I said
[1:01:06] you know what you Catholic people the
[1:01:09] Blessed Virgin Mary was with them
[1:01:11] now if God wouldn't let Mary come to
[1:01:13] heaven
[1:01:15] without receiving the Holy Ghost how are
[1:01:17] you going to get there

[1:01:28] well we ain't going to get there unless
[1:01:30] we lose all of our pride

[1:01:35] to wait up there until she lost all of
[1:01:38] her dignity
[1:01:39] well I'm so special now I'm not saying
[1:01:40] she about this but I'm Mother Mary
[1:01:44] I'm highly favored all the generations

[1:01:48] forget all about that and say Lord Jesus
[1:01:50] pour out your blessing on me fill my
[1:01:53] soul with the Holy Ghost I don't care
[1:01:55] what anybody thinks all I care is that
[1:01:58] the spirit of your son seals my soul
[1:02:01] oh she started praising God she started
[1:02:04] dancing around like that and brother I
[1:02:06] said how are the Catholics going to get
[1:02:07] there when they won't even dance and
[1:02:09] praise God how are we going to get there
[1:02:10] if we don't dance and praise God
[1:02:12] hallelujah
[1:02:13] oh I'm so glad Hallelujah
[1:02:17] thank God Amen
[1:02:20] says did you notice the pattern here
[1:02:21] David had to lose all his pride Mary had
[1:02:24] to lose house Pride
[1:02:25] Dave was a man for God's Own Heart let
[1:02:27] me say this Mary was a daughter after
[1:02:29] God's own house
[1:02:32] of course she was she had the baptism of
[1:02:33] the Holy Ghost
[1:02:35] absolutely
[1:02:37] to see what it requires it requires each
[1:02:39] of us to forget about our dignity
[1:02:43] what dignity do we have like who are we
[1:02:45] trying to impress
[1:02:47] who are we trying to uh who he's trying
[1:02:49] to live up to their expectation I want
[1:02:51] to live up to God's expectation
[1:02:54] yes brother man said don't bring the
[1:02:55] Holy Ghost down to your level he said
[1:02:58] bring the Holy Ghost to God's level
[1:03:00] Hallelujah
[1:03:04] in other words Lord let me act like they
[1:03:06] did on the day of Pentecost I don't want
[1:03:08] nothing shorted up praise God you set
[1:03:11] the standard high but I know you'll help
[1:03:12] me get there because God lifts me up
[1:03:14] Hallelujah
[1:03:16] Glory
[1:03:17] he'll Lift Me Up amen he'll lift me up
[1:03:21] if I'm down he'll raise me up he'll
[1:03:23] strengthen me why because I'm an eagle
[1:03:25] praise God he'll let the wind get under
[1:03:27] my wings he'll lift me up with my old
[1:03:29] and new testament he'll raise me up in
[1:03:31] faith and I'll meet God's requirement
[1:03:33] he'll raise me up amen
[1:03:37] let's not bring the Holy Ghost down to
[1:03:38] our level
[1:03:40] well I might have got the holy ghost or
[1:03:41] I might have done this I might have that
[1:03:43] just be able to look at Acts chapter 2
[1:03:45] and say have I acted like that do I have
[1:03:47] freedom like that did I have all my
[1:03:49] dignity going like that did I have all
[1:03:52] my pride going like that if so you're

[1:04:05] says today if your heart and not your
[1:04:08] heart

[1:04:12] hearted heart
[1:04:14] you want to have your way you want to
[1:04:16] act how you want to act instead of
[1:04:17] saying God just help me to act whatever
[1:04:19] you want me to do
[1:04:21] I'll act whatever way you let me just
[1:04:23] let me be led by the Holy Spirit
[1:04:25] I don't care how I act just come on me

[1:04:31] the church I don't care if I pass out I

[1:04:35] as long as you're feeling my soul as
[1:04:37] long as God lives in with as long as the
[1:04:39] Ark of God comes into this so that's all
[1:04:42] that matters amen

[1:08:26] glory praise God Amen that God would
[1:08:30] share his fear and live amongst men and
[1:08:33] women that are carnal right we fall
[1:08:35] ashore we're constantly falling short
[1:08:36] but yet the blood of Christ cleanses us
[1:08:39] forgives us and makes us Children of the
[1:08:41] most high God that God is pleased to

[1:08:59] Chris you got a question brother
[1:09:04] oh we don't know it's there's a lot of
[1:09:05] people say they found it but it really
[1:09:07] don't matter because the Bible don't the
[1:09:08] Bible doesn't say anything about it the
[1:09:10] only time the Bible mentions the New
[1:09:11] Testament is the Bible said John had a
[1:09:13] vision and he saw heaven open up and
[1:09:15] then he saw the Ark of God in heaven
[1:09:18] that's the last time now the the two
[1:09:20] prophets might have it the two prophets
[1:09:21] might have it there in the temple of
[1:09:23] Israel
[1:09:24] but remember on Wednesday night I don't
[1:09:25] know if we read that uh Jeremiah the
[1:09:27] Bible said Jeremiah said there's going
[1:09:29] to be a time when there's worship in
[1:09:30] Jerusalem and no one's even going to
[1:09:31] think about the ark why because Jesus is
[1:09:34] there
[1:09:35] he is the ark he is the prince of God
[1:09:38] he's the voice of God Amen
[1:09:41] Hallelujah
[1:09:43] so yeah that's why we don't care let the
[1:09:45] people find the ark let them find the uh
[1:09:47] the ark of Noah let them find the nails
[1:09:48] let them find the the cross of Jesus
[1:09:51] that don't matter that's not what Jesus
[1:09:52] is given out today Jesus is giving out
[1:09:54] the Holy Ghost today praise God
[1:09:57] it's like a rushy Mighty Wind amen

[1:11:29] each time I'll just point him back to
[1:11:31] the Bible

[1:12:20] heaven that died for me praise God
[1:12:24] he lived for me and he died for me
[1:12:27] praise God
[1:12:31] the best part is church is that we can
[1:12:34] get so close to God where we don't even
[1:12:35] hear Satan condemning us anymore
[1:12:38] because all we hear is the voice of God
[1:12:40] I also hear is praise God thank you
[1:12:43] Jesus he loves me he died for me and
[1:12:45] Satan's voice gets so quiet
[1:12:49] because all I hear is the voice of God
[1:12:53] is that angel singing
[1:12:55] Hallelujah
[1:12:57] is that Holy Holy Holy singer
[1:13:00] I set my affections on things above not
[1:13:03] on this Earth
[1:13:07] as they always say
[1:13:09] Satan reminds you of your past remind
[1:13:11] him of his future right
[1:13:13] Satan you are going to be falling in a
[1:13:16] bottomless pit for a thousand years
[1:13:17] while we're on the earth with rods of
[1:13:20] iron in Robes of white We're Kings and
[1:13:22] Priests I get a thousand years with
[1:13:24] Jesus and you get a thousand years of
[1:13:26] Fallen Hallelujah I'll take Jesus every
[1:13:29] time amen
[1:13:30] and Jesus said you're the father of Lies
[1:13:33] so you're probably lying to me anyway
[1:13:34] praise God
[1:13:36] but I know Jesus told me the truth his
[1:13:39] spirit is truth the spirit points me to
[1:13:41] the word of God and the word of God says
[1:13:43] I'm forgiven of all my trespasses
[1:13:46] [Music]
[1:13:48] the word of God said blessed is the man
[1:13:51] whom now is Forgiven all the sins amen
[1:13:56] Hallelujah
[1:13:57] and if God forgave David of murder if
[1:14:00] God gave forgave David of adultery if
[1:14:03] God forgave David of a number in the
[1:14:05] people then God will forgive me of my
[1:14:07] sins amen

[1:14:21] speaking to me but the blood of Jesus
[1:14:23] Christ speaks better things than Abel
[1:14:25] praise God
[1:14:27] it's better than your voice the voice of
[1:14:29] Jesus Christ speaks Mercy ah
[1:14:32] his mercies are new Every Morning Satan
[1:14:35] you're talking but shut up because God's
[1:14:37] telling me there's Mercy for me today

[1:15:06] obeyed the word of God

[1:15:17] life no I'm still finding that devil
[1:15:20] right right

[1:15:38] the church who's going to say that
[1:15:40] what's he Satan I don't listen to you
[1:15:42] saying I listen to the word of God
[1:15:44] Hallelujah I can listen to you see Satan
[1:15:47] I was born again neither the corruptible
[1:15:50] seed the life of God in Me is not dying
[1:15:52] Hallelujah the life of God in Me is just
[1:15:55] as strong as when I was born again amen
[1:15:58] Hallelujah my passion to know his word
[1:16:01] my fervent desire to please him by
[1:16:03] reaching out in the spirit is just as
[1:16:05] strong now as it was in 2003 when I got
[1:16:08] the Holy Ghost praise God
[1:16:10] oh Hallelujah
[1:16:12] so Satan let me remind you of that the
[1:16:15] word of God that I'm born again will
[1:16:17] never die but you're going to die
[1:16:21] my soul is pure Satan I'm born again
[1:16:28] and Satan the Bible says my soul cannot
[1:16:31] sin
[1:16:32] so you can condemn My Flesh all you want
[1:16:35] you can condemn my mind battles all you
[1:16:37] want but you cannot condemn my soul
[1:16:41] because my soul cannot sin
[1:16:44] and the Bible said Jesus was condemned
[1:16:46] in the flesh for our flesh to forgive
[1:16:48] our sins so Jesus died to forgive my
[1:16:50] fleshly sins amen
[1:16:53] and Jesus ever lives as an intercessor
[1:16:56] now because he can be touched by the
[1:16:58] feelings of my mind battles

[1:17:03] flesh thank God I'm not sick but I have
[1:17:05] infirmities in my mind and Jesus ever
[1:17:08] lives to make intercession to forgive me
[1:17:10] of my mind battles praise God
[1:17:15] Jesus makes intercession to the father
[1:17:17] for me
[1:17:18] that's what the Bible says
[1:17:20] imagine that Jesus goes on my behalf
[1:17:26] Jesus goes on my behalf and Jesus said
[1:17:28] father
[1:17:29] I come again you know of course it's not
[1:17:30] two persons but father invisible spirit
[1:17:33] your servant Jesse Smith down there in
[1:17:35] Akron Ohio he needs forgiveness

[1:18:14] requests before the father
[1:18:16] uh sounds like we need to pray more amen
[1:18:20] sounds like we have not because we ask
[1:18:22] not
[1:18:26] thank you Jesus I have a high priest the
[1:18:29] Bible said
[1:18:31] in the Old Testament they had to trust
[1:18:33] that the high priest will go in there
[1:18:34] and he'll contact God for me I keep
[1:18:37] giving you high five buddy Hallelujah I
[1:18:40] gotta get somebody else high five come
[1:18:41] on man Hallelujah in the Old Testament
[1:18:43] they were trusting high priest making
[1:18:44] her session for me please make
[1:18:46] intercession oh and church most of the
[1:18:48] time they come out right but we have a
[1:18:50] greater high priest than that the Bible
[1:18:52] said Jesus Christ is the high priest of
[1:18:55] our profession amen
[1:18:58] so we know there's got not going to be
[1:19:00] any human element there where Jesus is
[1:19:01] going to fail all you have to make sure
[1:19:03] is that we confess our sins and the high
[1:19:06] priest we're going yes sister who I'll
[1:19:08] go in for you I live to make
[1:19:09] intercession for you
[1:19:11] and I'm going in right now for you
[1:19:14] and he's saying holy holy holy it's the
[1:19:16] Lord God
[1:19:18] he's the Holy One amen
[1:19:22] all right Hallelujah
[1:19:24] Satan let me tell you you cannot condemn
[1:19:26] my soul
[1:19:27] because my soul is a part of God
[1:19:31] I've got thus saith the Lord to tell you
[1:19:33] that Satan and what are you going to do
[1:19:35] with that well you're not the seed
[1:19:36] you're not the seed we'll prove it
[1:19:38] I'll prove I am
[1:19:41] I repented I got baptized I got filled
[1:19:44] with the Holy Ghost I'm walking in the
[1:19:46] spirit I'm fighting against you
[1:19:49] I'm not fighting on your side I'm
[1:19:51] fighting against you Satan
[1:19:54] [Applause]
[1:19:57] amen
[1:19:58] you cannot condemn my soul
[1:20:00] and really that's the only real part of
[1:20:02] me anyway
[1:20:04] right that's the real me brother I said
[1:20:06] you've never seen the real me
[1:20:08] he said this is just a coat this is just
[1:20:10] outer outer outer shell you've never
[1:20:12] even seen the real Jesse Smith
[1:20:14] Hallelujah
[1:20:16] thank God condemn me all you want Satan
[1:20:19] but you can't condemn my soul
[1:20:21] all right
[1:20:23] because Satan
[1:20:24] whatever you say about condemnation it
[1:20:27] doesn't apply to me because God's word
[1:20:30] says I have no condemnation to me
[1:20:33] you cannot condemn me
[1:20:36] because God's Bible God's Prophet Paul
[1:20:39] said if I walk in the spirit which is
[1:20:42] obeying the truth a life of Holiness
[1:20:44] fervent desire to please him passion
[1:20:46] know his word if I'm walking the spirit
[1:20:48] I have no condemnation
[1:20:51] think about that church I don't even
[1:20:53] have a few sentences of condemnation
[1:20:54] against me in heaven
[1:20:56] think about that you have nothing that
[1:20:59] condemns you in heaven
[1:21:00] oh isn't that beautiful
[1:21:02] think about that you know you got Elvis
[1:21:03] Presley he's got all these years of
[1:21:04] condemnation
[1:21:06] uh you've got uh Stalin and Hitler
[1:21:09] I think you think of their long
[1:21:10] listeners but the Bible say you go over
[1:21:12] here
[1:21:13] brother amen
[1:21:15] as far as accusations there's no
[1:21:16] accusation it just says pardoned
[1:21:21] it's red and red
[1:21:25] whoa
[1:21:26] [Applause]
[1:21:30] there's nothing condemning you put your
[1:21:34] name there brother so-and-so sister
[1:21:36] so-and-so if I'm walking the spirit
[1:21:38] Satan there's no condemnation that's the
[1:21:41] saith the Lord
[1:21:43] and notice he can't say it's not true
[1:21:47] because it's Gonna Save the Lord
[1:21:50] and God cannot lie
[1:21:54] I can lie you can lie but the Lord can't
[1:21:58] lie
[1:22:00] [Applause]
[1:22:01] haha
[1:22:04] Satan the Holy Spirit has made me free
[1:22:08] from the love sin and death I'm free
[1:22:13] I have no condemnation I'm a free person
[1:22:16] praise God
[1:22:20] how are you going to condemn me
[1:22:22] I have no condemnation
[1:22:24] Hallelujah
[1:22:26] my soul cannot sin well
[1:22:30] right right all my other sins of My
[1:22:33] Flesh and spirit were cast in the sea of
[1:22:35] forgiveness Satan goes over there it's
[1:22:37] just a clear beautiful water come
[1:22:40] on he looks in there so I know Jesse
[1:22:42] said that yesterday I know he got upset
[1:22:43] I know he he spoke that word he should
[1:22:45] have said where is that and see he won't
[1:22:47] even wait into the waters because
[1:22:48] they're Waters of life
[1:22:51] and he's the spirit of death Hallelujah
[1:22:55] he's that pale horse rider he's death
[1:22:58] and Jesus is Larry praise God
[1:23:00] and if that's a c that's a water it's
[1:23:02] got to be the Holy Spirit
[1:23:04] so God tosses all my mistakes in the
[1:23:07] waters of life and Satan will go up
[1:23:08] there and say
[1:23:10] Oh Where can I
[1:23:11] uh I can't see anything
[1:23:15] I can't condemn him anymore
[1:23:18] let me go set a trap for him and the
[1:23:20] whole time I'm like Jesus keep me from
[1:23:22] the traps Jesus keep me from the traps
[1:23:23] and he's like I'm gonna okay Jesse I'm
[1:23:25] gonna make an intercession for you
[1:23:26] father keep Jesse from the next trap
[1:23:30] it's already set up I'm gonna win
[1:23:33] I'm going to overcome I'm going to go in
[1:23:36] the Rapture I'm going to heaven praise
[1:23:38] God
[1:23:39] hallelujah it's all set up for us to win
[1:23:42] praise God
[1:23:43] ah
[1:23:52] Satan says oh you're just a pretender
[1:23:55] you're guilty of lying
[1:23:57] you're guilty of deceiving you're guilty
[1:24:00] of lusting
[1:24:01] you're guilty of anger
[1:24:04] uh sorry Satan you can't lay any charge
[1:24:06] to me
[1:24:08] because God's elect cannot be charged
[1:24:11] with anything
[1:24:14] so he went to the courtroom the pre the
[1:24:16] uh the judge would say Okay read the
[1:24:19] charges against brother amen
[1:24:22] and Satan would have to look down he's
[1:24:24] scrambling for his papers
[1:24:26] I don't have any papers
[1:24:29] your honor there's there's no charges I
[1:24:31] wish there were charges
[1:24:33] I thought I had something on brother
[1:24:34] amen
[1:24:36] and then amen is standing over there
[1:24:38] next to his Advocate his lawyer he even
[1:24:41] said Thank you Lord Jesus for giving all
[1:24:43] my sins
[1:24:44] he took away all my charges Jesus
[1:24:46] dropped the charges
[1:24:48] praise God
[1:24:50] hallelujah thank God Amen
[1:24:54] Hallelujah
[1:24:55] who shall lay a charge to God's elect
[1:24:59] because God already Justified me
[1:25:02] amen Justified means to declare
[1:25:05] righteous who will Who will say I'm
[1:25:08] unrighteous if God said I'm righteous
[1:25:11] the devil can't say well no no God
[1:25:13] you're wrong God wrong
[1:25:16] the judge will say shut up it's my court
[1:25:22] sorry your honor sorry sorry sir
[1:25:26] he has to cower in the prince of God
[1:25:28] hallelujah yes he cannot speak against
[1:25:31] God he cannot speak against the word
[1:25:33] Jesus so perfectly takes all of our sins
[1:25:36] away there's no charges there's nothing
[1:25:38] against us so we go free in Jesus name
[1:25:42] who is that devil that condemns
[1:25:46] what matters is that Christ died
[1:25:48] and rose again
[1:25:50] who's at the right hand of God making
[1:25:52] their session for us
[1:25:56] church we sometimes we worry so much
[1:25:57] about that day there's really nothing to
[1:25:59] worry about
[1:26:01] because there's no condemnation
[1:26:04] to them that are in Christ Jesus
[1:26:07] yes we want to be humble all right we
[1:26:08] don't want to get into addictions of
[1:26:10] sins but
[1:26:11] if we daily confess if we do what the
[1:26:13] Bible says walk in the light as he's in
[1:26:15] the light then the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:26:17] will cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[1:26:22] I have nothing to fear in my future
[1:26:26] think about that
[1:26:28] you have nothing to fear about your
[1:26:29] future
[1:26:31] because you will not come into
[1:26:32] condemnation
[1:26:35] your future is clear
[1:26:37] all your debts have been paid
[1:26:41] there are no charges against you
[1:26:45] yeah there's little temporary ones but
[1:26:47] you confess those and God knows you're
[1:26:48] gonna do it already right so God he's
[1:26:50] already forgiven you in heaven looks
[1:26:51] like job how could job be perfect didn't
[1:26:53] have job is perfect in heaven
[1:26:55] but he was imperfect on Earth same thing
[1:26:57] for us
[1:26:58] we just have to deal with the we have to
[1:27:00] deal with the conviction down here
[1:27:01] overcome get the victory but haven't
[1:27:03] already recognized us we're perfect
[1:27:05] [Applause]
[1:27:07] God's the one that said Satan do you
[1:27:09] want to try my servant job
[1:27:12] the father had such confidence in his
[1:27:15] child so may God have confidence in us
[1:27:17] as well
[1:27:20] I shall not come into condemnation Jesus
[1:27:23] already took my punishment so brother
[1:27:25] Chris you can tell the devil this you
[1:27:27] said I heard Jesus word Jesus said if
[1:27:29] you hear on my word and Believe on him
[1:27:31] that sent me you have already
[1:27:33] everlasting life you have a portion of
[1:27:35] eternal life because you're saved
[1:27:37] that's right yes
[1:27:42] and you shall not come into condemnation
[1:27:45] because you're not trusting in what
[1:27:46] you've done you're trusting in your
[1:27:48] sacrifice
[1:27:50] you're trusting in the Savior thank God
[1:27:52] you know on Earth we want everybody to
[1:27:54] be a savior right oh Superman's a savior
[1:27:56] Batman's a savior this athlete he saved
[1:27:58] the team and say this there's really no
[1:28:00] saviors except Christ
[1:28:03] he's the only savior we need amen
[1:28:06] hallelujah we are not saved without him
[1:28:09] we are saved only through the blood of
[1:28:11] Jesus Christ
[1:28:14] he already took my condemnation
[1:28:18] Jesus cannot punish you because he
[1:28:19] already took punishment for you
[1:28:22] and the only reason they'll punish
[1:28:24] Sinners is because they fail to thank
[1:28:25] him for the punishment Jesus already
[1:28:27] took for them
[1:28:29] and they loved wickedness more than they
[1:28:31] loved holiness
[1:28:34] that's the only way right but it's
[1:28:35] already paid for they just have to
[1:28:37] confess their sins and say thank you for
[1:28:39] the sacrifice they just have to accept a
[1:28:41] gift
[1:28:43] all they got to do except a gift
[1:28:46] you know how hard it is it is so hard to
[1:28:48] turn down a gift
[1:28:51] you know somebody walks right up to you
[1:28:52] and gives you like a card or something
[1:28:54] comes right up to your door and gives
[1:28:56] you a gift
[1:28:57] so let me come right up to your door and
[1:29:00] like who's going to say well no I don't
[1:29:01] want that no
[1:29:03] no we all go oh thank you that's a
[1:29:05] phrase or thank God I appreciate that
[1:29:09] none of my children turned on any of the
[1:29:11] gifts I got them for Christmas this year
[1:29:14] and I wasn't hoping like oh yeah I hope
[1:29:16] they get in there I can get my money
[1:29:17] back I don't care about the money
[1:29:19] I care about giving them gifts I want
[1:29:20] them to be happy
[1:29:22] Hallelujah
[1:29:24] right but he's giving me the gift all
[1:29:26] you have to do is accept the gift and
[1:29:28] you accepted it brother
[1:29:32] Jesus was wounded for your
[1:29:34] transgressions
[1:29:36] Jesus was bruised for my iniquities
[1:29:39] I have nothing to fear he's already
[1:29:41] coming taking my punishment
[1:29:44] he already he already bore all my
[1:29:45] condemnation
[1:29:47] when I look at the cross I see that's
[1:29:48] what I should have been
[1:29:50] I should have been I should have been
[1:29:52] crucified
[1:29:53] I deserve to die but he died for me
[1:29:56] so that's why I tell Satan oh I'm not
[1:29:58] going to go to hell Jesus already went
[1:29:59] to hell for me
[1:30:01] how's he going to send me to Hell how's
[1:30:03] God going to send me to hell when I
[1:30:04] accepted that his son already paid for
[1:30:07] me paid for my sins and went to hell for
[1:30:09] me
[1:30:11] how is he going to send me to hell when
[1:30:13] I'm already living in Heavenly places
[1:30:16] how am I going to go to hell when I'm
[1:30:19] living in Christ amen
[1:30:22] how it doesn't make any sense all these
[1:30:25] years I've been living in Christ in
[1:30:27] Heavenly places and God's going to send
[1:30:28] me to hell it don't make any sense the
[1:30:30] fact that I can live in Heavenly places
[1:30:32] proves that he already went to hell for
[1:30:34] me praise God
[1:30:40] for Christ hath also once suffered for
[1:30:43] Sins Not for his for mine
[1:30:46] for yours
[1:30:49] the just for the unjust
[1:30:51] Jesus was made
[1:30:53] to be sin for us
[1:30:56] who knew no sin
[1:30:58] that we might be made the righteous of
[1:30:59] God so God did it God did a trade
[1:31:01] God said I'm going to trade all of your
[1:31:04] sins for all of Jesus righteousness not
[1:31:06] some of it all of it praise God
[1:31:11] I'm trading all of your sins all your
[1:31:13] shame all your guilt all your fears
[1:31:15] about the future I'm trading all that
[1:31:17] for peace that passes all understanding
[1:31:22] just got to receive it
[1:31:26] oh
[1:31:28] I'm trying to get somewhere
[1:31:30] remember I read this last Sunday
[1:31:32] he hasn't forgiven some of your
[1:31:34] trespasses he's forgiven all your
[1:31:36] trespasses
[1:31:38] speak that to the devil oh no no Satan
[1:31:41] said oh what about last week what about
[1:31:42] yeah last year oh
[1:31:45] come on now the Bible says all
[1:31:49] right the Bible didn't say something
[1:31:50] the Bible said all of my sins Jesus has
[1:31:54] already blotted out praise God
[1:31:57] he erased it he done away with it praise
[1:32:00] God he washed it clean amen
[1:32:03] can't even see it anymore it's all
[1:32:05] washed out
[1:32:09] where'd he do that on the cross he did
[1:32:11] that the Bible said God nailed all of
[1:32:14] our sins to the cross
[1:32:16] and they were paid for right there
[1:32:19] Hallelujah so I have nothing to fear in
[1:32:22] my future
[1:32:25] you know church I was so encouraged I
[1:32:26] was watching a video of a Christian
[1:32:27] Broadcasting Network and they had a
[1:32:29] pastor from Hong Kong stand up
[1:32:32] and they were saying how
[1:32:34] um China was supposed to give Hong Kong
[1:32:35] 50 years of Independence but they they
[1:32:37] didn't even give them like they only
[1:32:38] gave him a few and now China has
[1:32:40] basically Taken full control over Hong
[1:32:42] Kong like Wendy used to tell us remember
[1:32:43] that actually that was happening while
[1:32:44] Wendy was coming
[1:32:48] and these these announcers are on there
[1:32:49] you know they're they're all nice dress
[1:32:51] and they're all TV announcers and
[1:32:52] they're saying
[1:32:53] well we just wonder you know as the
[1:32:55] Church of is the Church of Christ going
[1:32:57] to make it through this time in Hong
[1:32:58] Kong and they got a American preacher up
[1:33:01] there preaching to a bunch of Hong Kong
[1:33:02] people and they asked the Hong Kong
[1:33:04] preacher what about all these arrests
[1:33:06] what about all these persecutions and he
[1:33:08] looked right in the camera
[1:33:09] he said all these persecutions mean
[1:33:11] nothing
[1:33:13] he said we're not afraid of them if they
[1:33:16] arrest us if they kill us that's not
[1:33:18] going to stop the Church of God I
[1:33:19] thought my goodness of a denominational
[1:33:21] man knew the Church of God cannot be
[1:33:23] stopped no matter through persecution or
[1:33:25] anything what about us we ought to know
[1:33:27] God's Church keeps marching on Amen
[1:33:32] and they showed all these priests you
[1:33:34] know all these preachers in in Hong Kong
[1:33:36] being carted off to jail and this guy's
[1:33:38] like let him do it the church will keep
[1:33:40] marching on God's truth cannot be
[1:33:42] stopped God's plan cannot be altered
[1:33:45] just like Satan cannot see your sins God
[1:33:48] has done away with your sins God will
[1:33:49] make sure this bride gets raptured amen
[1:33:54] Hallelujah
[1:33:57] who his own self bear our sins brother
[1:34:00] Jesus died for your sins he already bore
[1:34:04] them he already wore them on himself
[1:34:07] he already paid the price for all your
[1:34:09] sins so you don't have to live with the
[1:34:11] guilt of your sins
[1:34:13] he already bore them that means he
[1:34:15] carried them on his shoulders
[1:34:18] on the tree Jesus had the weight he was
[1:34:21] hanging there between heaven and earth
[1:34:22] right he had the weight he's going up
[1:34:25] and down
[1:34:26] and he had the weight of all Emma's sins
[1:34:28] on him
[1:34:30] but not just Emma
[1:34:32] not just maokai brother Chris
[1:34:35] and not just brother Chris brother
[1:34:38] he had to wait and each time he took a
[1:34:39] breath it got heavier in heaven so
[1:34:41] finally said it is finished
[1:34:44] and he released the spirit he dismissed
[1:34:47] his Spirit I'm so glad he said it
[1:34:49] I'm so glad he said it's all I'm so glad
[1:34:52] he didn't say it's almost finished he
[1:34:54] said it's finished
[1:34:56] Hallelujah Satan's condemnation against
[1:34:59] you is finished Hallelujah
[1:35:02] it's finished
[1:35:04] the forgiveness is finished the victory
[1:35:06] spinners
[1:35:07] the Salvation is finished the Holy Ghost
[1:35:10] is finished amen
[1:35:12] it's a finished work Hallelujah
[1:35:16] I was a sheep going astray but I've
[1:35:18] returned to my shepherd
[1:35:20] all these years I was going astray
[1:35:22] trying to get into sports trying to get
[1:35:24] into different things all these things I
[1:35:26] was trying I was running away but pretty
[1:35:27] soon the Sheep finally came running back
[1:35:29] to Jesus oh Lord I love you I'm going to
[1:35:31] serve you I'm going to follow you Guide
[1:35:34] Me Guide Me and now I'm feeding on sheep
[1:35:37] food three times a week really seven
[1:35:39] days a week praise God we're sheep and
[1:35:41] the shepherd Is Watching Over Us amen
[1:35:44] running back to Jesus uh thank you Lord
[1:35:47] for giving me my sins
[1:35:49] that's all I am just a little helpless
[1:35:51] sheep
[1:35:52] but that's interesting he gives us the
[1:35:54] sword of the spirit so how does this how
[1:35:57] does a sheep get a sword I don't know
[1:36:01] oh thank you Jesus I don't know where to
[1:36:04] close it's been such a great service
[1:36:05] here
[1:36:07] let me see how much how much I got here
[1:36:10] okay I repeated that one okay
[1:36:14] I'm gonna go a little bit further I'm
[1:36:15] only really preaching once a day so bear
[1:36:17] with me
[1:36:18] I go to Romans 14.
[1:36:33] Church you have no condemnation
[1:36:36] because you're in Christ
[1:36:40] no condemnation
[1:36:41] there's going to be no judgment against
[1:36:43] you well Zur is guilty of this
[1:36:46] Jesse's guilty of this Vang is guilty of
[1:36:49] this there's no condemnation to them
[1:36:52] that are in Christ Jesus
[1:36:55] how do I know I'm in Christ Jesus
[1:36:56] because I kept his word
[1:36:59] he called me he invited me I'll say like
[1:37:02] this he's keeping me Hallelujah he's
[1:37:04] keeping me in this message amen
[1:37:07] he's keeping me in the faith praise God
[1:37:09] he's watching over his little sheep that
[1:37:11] the Sheep don't go straight
[1:37:13] that's what I that's what I want him to
[1:37:15] do I want to watch over me so I don't
[1:37:17] run astray
[1:37:19] Romans 14.
[1:37:25] we'll just read verse
[1:37:26] 17. for the kingdom of God is not in
[1:37:29] meat and drink but righteousness peace
[1:37:32] and joy in the Holy Ghost
[1:37:36] church we have to remember these three
[1:37:37] these three attributes of a Christian
[1:37:40] prove we're in the kingdom of God
[1:37:44] when you when you're Anointed with
[1:37:45] righteousness you're in the kingdom of
[1:37:47] God righteous means doing what's right
[1:37:48] integrity
[1:37:51] peace is being
[1:37:53] uh not with war with God right you're
[1:37:55] not at war with God you're not fighting
[1:37:57] against God you're fighting for God
[1:37:59] Hallelujah
[1:38:01] and then Joy is being glad
[1:38:04] and rejoicing
[1:38:08] now that's what we could use a little
[1:38:09] more in the United States praise God
[1:38:13] rejoicing enough to dance
[1:38:16] rejoicing enough to shout
[1:38:18] rejoicing enough to praise to raise your
[1:38:20] hands and praise the Lord amen
[1:38:22] that's what we could use as a little
[1:38:24] more by God's grace
[1:38:26] that is the kingdom of God remember seek
[1:38:29] ye first the kingdom of God and his
[1:38:30] righteousness and all these things will
[1:38:32] be added unto you
[1:38:35] I found that to be thus saith the Lord
[1:38:37] Of My Life
[1:38:38] I got saved at 21 or 19 years old I
[1:38:41] heard the message at 21. so for these
[1:38:43] last 22 years and the message all I've
[1:38:46] seen is that if I put God first he gives
[1:38:48] me everything I need
[1:38:50] not everything I want everything I need
[1:38:53] he actually gives me some things
[1:38:57] that sometimes I make mistakes
[1:38:59] I buy things I want instead of things I
[1:39:01] need
[1:39:03] but the main thing is to give more of
[1:39:05] what you have like that with a woman she
[1:39:07] gave more of her what she had God's
[1:39:09] looking to give God's looking for us to
[1:39:10] give a greater portion of what we have
[1:39:13] it's not how much we give it's what
[1:39:15] portion what percentage of what we have
[1:39:17] are we giving
[1:39:18] what are we giving to God
[1:39:21] okay so there are so many Joy scriptures
[1:39:24] often look at this maybe Wednesday night
[1:39:25] but notice Church the kingdom of God is
[1:39:27] Not depression
[1:39:30] the kingdom of God is not fear
[1:39:32] did I read that right
[1:39:36] so you if you're in the kingdom of God
[1:39:38] you have no claim to say well it's okay
[1:39:40] for me to have anxiety it's okay for me
[1:39:43] to have stress it's okay for me to be
[1:39:45] Dreadful about the future it's okay for
[1:39:47] me to be gloomy it's okay for me to be
[1:39:50] discouraged you're living for the wrong
[1:39:52] Kingdom
[1:39:53] God's kingdom gives us righteousness
[1:39:56] peace and joy in the Holy Ghost praise
[1:39:58] God
[1:40:00] that's what God's kingdom produces God's
[1:40:03] kingdom is a Reign god reigns over your
[1:40:06] life if God is your king he rules over
[1:40:08] your life and he doesn't establish
[1:40:10] altars of uh depression
[1:40:13] and well I'm so depressed I'll go get my
[1:40:15] cigarette and then I'll just bow at the
[1:40:16] altar of cigarette smoking and
[1:40:18] depression that's what I used to do
[1:40:19] Under the kingdom of darkness
[1:40:21] or say up worrying all night he said
[1:40:23] worry all night who am I going to marry
[1:40:25] what's going to happen oh God how's it
[1:40:27] going to happen
[1:40:27] that's not the kingdom of God
[1:40:30] no that's not the kingdom of God the
[1:40:32] kingdom of God is I can sleep at night
[1:40:33] because I've got peace like a river
[1:40:36] Hallelujah I've got joy like a fountain
[1:40:39] hi there that's the kingdom of God
[1:40:41] hallelujah
[1:40:45] go to Luke 6 23.
[1:40:50] I just got a little bit of inkling here
[1:40:54] we should be pretty happy today by God's
[1:40:56] grace
[1:40:57] Luke 6 23.
[1:41:04] foreign
[1:41:06] so Jesus going through the Beatitudes
[1:41:09] rejoice
[1:41:10] I'm sorry let's read 22. blessed are ye
[1:41:13] when men shall hate you anyone ever
[1:41:15] hated you so much that they wanted like
[1:41:30] Hallelujah you keep that confession
[1:41:32] Jesus died so I don't have to be a slave
[1:41:34] to cigarettes that's why he died to
[1:41:36] break the chains of cigarettes
[1:41:37] addictions
[1:41:40] blessed are you when men shall hate you
[1:41:42] so you're more blessed if men hate you
[1:41:43] for Christ's sake
[1:41:46] and when they shall separate you from
[1:41:48] their company and shall reproach you see
[1:41:50] they don't want to be around you anymore
[1:41:51] because you love Christ
[1:41:55] he didn't say
[1:41:57] uh you're cursed he said you're blessed
[1:42:02] and cast out your name as evil for the
[1:42:04] son of man's sake so last couple years
[1:42:07] I've been I've been called a satanic
[1:42:08] preacher right
[1:42:09] last few years have been called a
[1:42:10] satanic preacher
[1:42:12] and that discouraged me at first but
[1:42:13] when I read this it actually encourages
[1:42:14] me Hallelujah
[1:42:19] because I know how I live
[1:42:22] I can tell Satan Satan try to say look
[1:42:24] they call you satanic preacher what do
[1:42:25] they know
[1:42:26] they don't watch How I Live
[1:42:28] they don't see my prayers they don't see
[1:42:30] my fasting they don't see my Bible
[1:42:32] reading they don't see my love for God
[1:42:34] they don't see me dance for Jesus
[1:42:37] and they ought to see that I'm more good
[1:42:39] to them than they are to me
[1:42:41] those people ought to see that I gave
[1:42:43] them way more gifts than they gave to me
[1:42:47] when they might have had a baby I gave
[1:42:48] them a gift when I had eight babies they
[1:42:50] didn't give me any gifts
[1:42:52] so what about that Satan
[1:42:54] who's more blessed I'm more blessed amen
[1:42:58] you're more blessed praise God because
[1:43:00] you know you're a child of God
[1:43:01] hallelujah
[1:43:03] will hate you that's a good sign you are
[1:43:05] a child of God
[1:43:07] Hallelujah
[1:43:09] verse 24-3 rejoice in that day and cower
[1:43:14] down in depression and hide in your
[1:43:16] under your bed
[1:43:18] the Bible said leave for joy in that day
[1:43:23] Hallelujah buddy one of these days
[1:43:25] you're going to leave money for God Amen
[1:43:27] right people hate us they come against
[1:43:29] us they want to move away from us they
[1:43:31] want to speak against us but Jesus said
[1:43:33] if you're obeying God that's a sign to
[1:43:35] leave for Joy praise God
[1:43:40] so shame on any devil that will tell me
[1:43:42] not to leave for Jesus because Jesus
[1:43:45] Christ gave me permission to leave for
[1:43:47] Joy praise God
[1:43:49] let them say what they want I got
[1:43:52] permission to do it praise God like
[1:43:55] David I got permission to do it
[1:43:57] Hallelujah
[1:43:59] that's what he told me to do and I'm
[1:44:01] more blessed to obey Christ than to
[1:44:04] accept Satan's lies praise God
[1:44:08] will not accept Satan lies I'll accept
[1:44:10] the truth of Jesus
[1:44:13] and why can't we leap if David left for
[1:44:16] Joy when he saw the word fulfilled why
[1:44:18] can't we
[1:44:20] we see a soul saved we ought to say
[1:44:22] praise God
[1:44:24] trying to tip my head on the ceiling you
[1:44:26] know
[1:44:27] cause all the ceiling tiles will fall
[1:44:29] down and everything like that
[1:44:31] I don't want to clean up between
[1:44:32] services
[1:44:34] but the Bible says if the word of God is
[1:44:37] being fulfilled if God's presence is
[1:44:39] coming into your life amen if God's
[1:44:42] presence is coming into the church we
[1:44:44] ought to shout and thank God say the
[1:44:46] presence of God is here oh Jesus dwell
[1:44:49] amongst us you're fulfilling your word
[1:44:51] amen
[1:44:52] oh thank you Jesus amen
[1:44:56] Glory
[1:44:59] you mean he can jump for Bulls being
[1:45:02] killed every six Paces he can jump over
[1:45:05] Bulls but we can't we can't jump over
[1:45:07] the precious blood of Jesus Christ
[1:45:09] [Music]
[1:45:10] that didn't take away some of my sins it
[1:45:12] took away all my sins
[1:45:15] it didn't forgive half of the charges
[1:45:18] against me it said there's no charges
[1:45:20] against me Hallelujah
[1:45:24] once a year they could get all the
[1:45:25] charges cleared on that day of atonement
[1:45:28] but Church our day of atonement's every
[1:45:30] day amen
[1:45:33] thank God Amen every day we're forgiven
[1:45:37] we're loved we're cherished there's no
[1:45:39] charges against us praise God
[1:45:45] go to John 4 14.
[1:45:48] church I got two scriptures that prove
[1:45:49] you're allowed to leap
[1:45:52] I know amen and whoa can definitely leap
[1:45:54] they've been they've gone through some
[1:45:56] persecution
[1:45:57] people have not liked them
[1:46:00] people have hated me call me a satanic
[1:46:02] preacher
[1:46:03] let them say whatever they want
[1:46:06] I don't care what they say
[1:46:07] I care What God Says
[1:46:10] and God backs up his word amen and God
[1:46:12] Don't Lie amen no
[1:46:14] and God never said he hated me God said
[1:46:16] he loves me amen how are they going to
[1:46:18] say God hates me when God said he loves
[1:46:20] me praise God
[1:46:21] it don't make any sense it shows they
[1:46:23] got the wrong spirit
[1:46:27] and then I know I got the right spirit
[1:46:28] because I can be kind to them
[1:46:31] and it's like pouring coals upon their
[1:46:34] heads
[1:46:36] I'm going to be kind to them it's going
[1:46:37] to burn them up they might be trying to
[1:46:39] smile on the inside some of them can't
[1:46:40] even say some of them won't even tell me
[1:46:42] God bless you and I'll be like God bless
[1:46:43] you
[1:46:45] God bless you and I'm like I'm like
[1:46:47] dying on the inside like this person
[1:46:49] hates me God bless you
[1:46:51] but really I'm pouring coals of fire oh
[1:46:53] that's going to burn them up hopefully
[1:46:55] it'll convict him to want to love Jesus
[1:46:57] Hallelujah to see that I hold nothing
[1:46:59] against him and God hold nothing's
[1:47:01] against me praise God
[1:47:03] God doesn't hold anything against me
[1:47:05] because all the charges have been
[1:47:06] dropped
[1:47:08] Jesus Paid all the charges against me
[1:47:13] John 4 14.
[1:47:16] Glory
[1:47:27] thank you Jesus yeah
[1:47:29] but whoso drinketh of the water that I
[1:47:31] shall give him
[1:47:32] shall never thirst
[1:47:35] I'm not thirsting after football games
[1:47:37] anymore no oh I can't wait to get to the
[1:47:40] game
[1:47:41] I'm not thirsting after cigarettes and
[1:47:42] chewing tobacco anymore I can't I can't
[1:47:45] wait to get those dirty magazines I'm
[1:47:46] not thirsting for that I'm thirsting
[1:47:48] after the things of God
[1:47:50] Jesus said I never thirst so Satan
[1:47:53] Travis is coming to make you Thursday
[1:47:54] well I don't thirst anymore Jesus said
[1:47:55] I'm not thirsty anymore
[1:47:58] you're just appealing to My Flesh and my
[1:48:00] mind but in my soul my soul can never
[1:48:03] there's my soul never did thirst amen
[1:48:05] but so is only thirster for the Living
[1:48:08] God Amen like David said
[1:48:12] I can't even finish that scripture
[1:48:13] without preaching on it he says
[1:48:15] but the water that I should give him
[1:48:17] shall be in him a well of water
[1:48:20] springing up into everlasting life
[1:48:26] that springing up means leaping
[1:48:29] the water or can I say like this the
[1:48:31] testimonies will leap up inside of you
[1:48:33] for our sister for tonight they just
[1:48:35] leap up they just come right up
[1:48:38] right that's a leaping now look if if
[1:48:41] they could leap when they're persecuted
[1:48:43] and the man that gave a beautiful could
[1:48:45] leap over Divine Healing if we've got
[1:48:48] forgiveness in the soul why can't we
[1:48:50] leave over forgiveness praise God why
[1:48:53] can't we leap over eternal life amen
[1:48:56] you see it doesn't make any sense to me
[1:48:58] to uh to let all the worship remain
[1:49:01] somewhere else the worship should be
[1:49:03] here under God's high priest God's holy
[1:49:06] son God's son whoever lives to make
[1:49:09] intercession for us amen
[1:49:12] The Joy should be in the house of the
[1:49:13] Lord
[1:49:18] that man in Acts 3 he was leaping over
[1:49:21] Divine Healing what about us we have a
[1:49:24] greater Miracle than that man
[1:49:29] I was hoping to hear a few more amens on
[1:49:31] that
[1:49:33] your spiritual healing is greater than
[1:49:35] your natural healing because your body's
[1:49:38] going to get sick again if you live on
[1:49:40] your body's going to die they're going
[1:49:42] to embalm it or burn it or bury it or
[1:49:44] something
[1:49:45] well then where's the victory there
[1:49:46] there's no there's no continuing Victory
[1:49:48] but there is victory in a soul that can
[1:49:51] never sin again amen hallelujah or the
[1:49:54] soul that never send amen
[1:49:57] that's victory
[1:49:59] that's eternal life he gives you his
[1:50:01] eternal life and that soul that seed
[1:50:03] cannot sin there's no condemnation
[1:50:05] there's no charges there's no
[1:50:08] condemnation because I'm in Christ
[1:50:14] I just put up there I wonder church
[1:50:16] should we pray for these believers who
[1:50:18] don't dance and don't leap and don't
[1:50:19] shout maybe I should pray for them to
[1:50:22] get some persecution
[1:50:24] and then when they come up for prayer
[1:50:25] when they're being persecuted I can take
[1:50:26] this verse I can say well look
[1:50:28] instead of being discouraged
[1:50:30] it's time for you to leave here today
[1:50:33] well I don't feel like it well Jesus
[1:50:35] never said until you feel like it he
[1:50:37] said blessed are you you shall leap for
[1:50:39] joy
[1:50:40] huh
[1:50:42] right
[1:50:43] see church we see see sometimes we just
[1:50:45] look at the natural we got like these uh
[1:50:47] what do they call them blinders we got
[1:50:49] blinders on all we can see is here but
[1:50:51] around us there's angels all around us
[1:50:54] Glory Hallelujah the Holy Ghost is
[1:50:57] around us like a wind brother the Holy
[1:50:59] Ghost is blowing all over here praise
[1:51:00] God but all we can see is the natural
[1:51:02] but the Bible tells us we should have
[1:51:04] emotion we should leap when we're
[1:51:06] persecuted it's actually a sign of
[1:51:08] Victory praise God
[1:51:10] that were on the right path Hallelujah
[1:51:14] when your family hates you and wants to
[1:51:15] move away from you
[1:51:17] when people call you a satanic person or
[1:51:19] whatever they mock you whatever that
[1:51:20] just proof that God has blessed you
[1:51:22] praise God
[1:51:24] and Jesus said go ahead and leap for
[1:51:25] that one
[1:51:27] well I will then praise God hallelujah I
[1:51:29] actually have about five times here
[1:51:30] today
[1:51:30] I guess I will praise God
[1:51:33] Hallelujah
[1:51:35] when people say all manner of evil
[1:51:37] against you he said that's the time to
[1:51:39] leap for joy
[1:51:43] oh thank you Lord how many love the Lord
[1:51:45] today
[1:51:46] so what Jesus ordained leaping
[1:51:50] he didn't say you might want to LEAP he
[1:51:52] said blessed are you and he said in that
[1:51:54] day leap for joy
[1:51:55] he didn't say think about it he said
[1:51:57] leap for joy
[1:51:59] probably that
[1:52:02] well I thought we said I thought we said
[1:52:03] we're Bible Believers I thought we said
[1:52:05] we believe every word of God
[1:52:07] I thought I thought we're in the word
[1:52:09] all the way
[1:52:12] see I'm bringing all the channels to the
[1:52:13] church
[1:52:14] if we say we're in the word all the way
[1:52:16] we got to do what all the word says
[1:52:19] yeah if I get persecuted it's time for
[1:52:21] me to rejoice
[1:52:23] Hallelujah if the Bible says I have no
[1:52:25] condemnation it's time for me to act
[1:52:27] like I'm forgiven praise God
[1:52:30] Hallelujah
[1:52:33] remember even the we kind of went
[1:52:35] through that
[1:52:36] even Jesus compared his ministry uh
[1:52:39] John's Ministry was like morning morning
[1:52:41] morning repenting but Jesus compared his
[1:52:43] ministry to men piping and the children
[1:52:45] dancing
[1:52:47] so the New Testament spiritually makes
[1:52:50] us dance and praise the Lord but
[1:52:52] sometimes it'll make us physically dance
[1:52:54] like Jesus said leap for Joy this water
[1:52:58] is going to be leaping and if it's
[1:52:59] leaping inside of you how can you not
[1:53:01] leave on the outside hey come on George
[1:53:03] if you feel something leaping inside you
[1:53:05] how can you not leap physically praise
[1:53:07] God
[1:53:08] it's time to believe God's word
[1:53:10] because Jesus said if you believe on me
[1:53:12] it will spring up Glory
[1:53:14] you got to Pump It Up come on come on
[1:53:16] where's that where's that where's that
[1:53:17] Spirit where's that no the Bible said if
[1:53:19] you believe it will spring up praise God
[1:53:22] Hallelujah
[1:53:24] like I put up with brother brother amen
[1:53:25] I put him up there on their brother
[1:53:27] I should leap for Joy but amen has been
[1:53:29] forsaken by his family he ought to leap
[1:53:32] for Joy praise God maybe he has uh he
[1:53:34] probably has
[1:53:35] Hallelujah that's what the Bible says
[1:53:38] who's the greatest miracle
[1:53:41] how do you take a sinner like me and you
[1:53:44] and make a Christian out of us
[1:53:46] I can't understand it I can't either
[1:53:50] how God could take me in the position I
[1:53:52] was in how could he take me and make a
[1:53:54] Christian out of me
[1:53:56] that's the greatest miracle
[1:53:58] that God ever performed is when he took
[1:54:01] a a sinner and made a Christian out of
[1:54:04] us
[1:54:05] and if you can't now looky here I love
[1:54:07] this is a beautiful thought I'm going to
[1:54:08] close to this it's already 12 30.
[1:54:10] preaching two hours right
[1:54:14] that means it's a pretty good anointing
[1:54:15] if I'm reaching two out
[1:54:17] pretty good anointing in here
[1:54:21] this is a beautiful dog listen to this
[1:54:23] thought from other brand such a powerful
[1:54:24] thought you believe that God can save
[1:54:26] anybody from sin how many believe that
[1:54:27] God can save anybody as long as they're
[1:54:29] ordained a sin right
[1:54:30] I'm sorry ordained to life you've been
[1:54:33] taught that well that's a far more of a
[1:54:35] miracle that you can believe God can
[1:54:37] save your dad or your mom or
[1:54:39] whoever your co-worker
[1:54:42] that's a far more miracle
[1:54:45] that man was dead listen that man was
[1:54:47] dead and sins and trespass his soul is
[1:54:49] dead
[1:54:51] and he had to believe or remain dead
[1:54:54] and then after you're born again you
[1:54:56] become a Son of God how much more ought
[1:54:59] you to believe for a lesser miracle
[1:55:03] for Divine Healing
[1:55:06] if a man lived I'm sorry if if a live
[1:55:09] man ought to believe more than a dead
[1:55:12] man
[1:55:13] see what I mean you've got to believe it
[1:55:16] can't believe it believe it that's all
[1:55:19] you have to do is believe it
[1:55:22] you can't explain it but you know if God
[1:55:25] can save Souls if we've seen God's give
[1:55:28] Souls eternal life we've seen these
[1:55:30] Souls receive eternal life we've seen
[1:55:32] this Soul receive eternal life the
[1:55:33] promise of eternal life
[1:55:35] if we can believe that if we can believe
[1:55:37] the greatest Miracle how much more can
[1:55:39] we believe for Divine Healing
[1:55:42] how much more for prophecies
[1:55:44] how much more for words of wisdom and
[1:55:47] words of knowledge
[1:55:49] and discernment a spirit how much more
[1:55:51] have we've seen the greatest Miracles
[1:55:52] how much more should we believe for
[1:55:54] lesser miracles
[1:55:57] do you understand his thinking there
[1:55:59] in other words if you've seen us if
[1:56:01] you've seen a sinner say that you've
[1:56:02] been praying for your faith should be
[1:56:04] this this high
[1:56:05] because you've already seen the greatest
[1:56:07] miracle
[1:56:09] if I have already seen amen and who I
[1:56:11] saved if I've already seen sir safe why
[1:56:13] Shirley can believe for somebody to be
[1:56:14] healed
[1:56:15] that's not even half as great
[1:56:18] they're going to get sick again they're
[1:56:19] going to go up and down we're going to
[1:56:20] pray for Jose time after timer braver
[1:56:22] Brothers just time after time but their
[1:56:24] Soul's already been healed amen we've
[1:56:27] already seen the greatest thing ever
[1:56:28] happened to brother vague amen
[1:56:31] I thought I'd use him at the end here
[1:56:33] we've already seen the greatest thing
[1:56:34] happen to him so why can't we believe
[1:56:37] for a lesser miracle
[1:56:39] let's say to our feet
[1:56:42] there's some other ones
[1:56:44] musicians can come
[1:56:46] brother random quotes John 5 24 verily

[1:56:54] shall not come into condemnation he's
[1:56:56] path passed from Death unto life

[1:56:59] infallible word of God that can't fail
[1:57:03] he that heareth my words and believeth
[1:57:04] on him that set me hath everlasting life
[1:57:06] and shall not come into condemnation but

[1:58:32] just God's vessel to give you the word
[1:58:34] of life

[1:59:46] God's already Justified you
[1:59:50] blood of Jesus Christ speaks greater
[1:59:53] things for you than Satan's Lives

[2:07:25] when God grows a church so much I got to
[2:07:27] put it back in but
[2:07:29] praise God
[2:07:32] did not make me a Christian to be
[2:07:33] miserable
[2:07:35] you know what brother said
[2:07:39] I just don't want religion in my heart
[2:07:40] but as I get religion all over your body
[2:07:43] praise God Amen Hallelujah
[2:07:46] let's pray here
[2:07:48] thank you
[2:07:49] [Music]
