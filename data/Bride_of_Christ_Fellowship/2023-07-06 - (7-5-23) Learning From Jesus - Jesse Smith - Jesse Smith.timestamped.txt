[0:47] [Applause]
[0:49] [Music]
[0:57] God bless you let's take our Bibles as
[0:59] we stand here I'd like to go to Matthew
[1:00] chapter 11 tonight I just want to
[1:03] start maybe just a very short series I
[1:05] kind of mentioned this thought
[1:07] on Sunday
[1:09] I just want to call this short little
[1:11] series learning from Jesus
[1:13] you know sometimes learning can be a
[1:16] a negative word maybe around the message
[1:18] but if you actually look in the Bible
[1:21] learning is a good thing in the Bible
[1:23] praise God
[1:24] so we want to look at that here tonight
[1:25] and Trust to be a blessing to you
[1:30] Matthew chapter 11 verse 25.
[1:34] Matthew 11 25 by God's grace
[2:00] Matthew 11 25 praise God
[2:08] Hallelujah
[2:10] of course in context here this is the
[2:11] chapter where
[2:13] John the Baptist is in prison and he
[2:15] gets word or he sent he sends for word
[2:18] about Jesus is Jesus the Messiah so of
[2:20] course this is at the beginning of Jesus
[2:22] ministry
[2:23] when he first starts laboring Healing
[2:25] The Sick and of course after the the
[2:26] miracle of the wine and so forth so
[2:28] Matthew 11 25
[2:32] I'll read 25 down to 27 then we can all
[2:34] read 28 and 29 and 30. we'll give you a
[2:37] little extra reading there tonight on
[2:38] this Wednesday night
[2:39] God's grace
[2:41] let me set a timer here so we can kind
[2:42] of manage the time
[2:44] Scott allows so I'll read 25 through 27.
[2:48] at that time Jesus answered and said I
[2:50] thank the O Father Lord of Heaven and
[2:52] Earth because thou has hid these things
[2:54] from the wise and prudent and has
[2:56] revealed them unto babes
[2:59] even so father
[3:01] for so it seemed good in thy sight all
[3:06] things are delivered unto me of my
[3:07] father and no man knoweth the son but
[3:10] the father neither knoweth any man the
[3:12] father save the son
[3:14] and he to whomsoever the son will reveal
[3:17] him
[3:18] let's read 28 29 and 30 together ready
[3:21] one two three come unto me all ye that
[3:25] labor and are heavy laden and I will
[3:28] give you rest take my yoke upon you and
[3:33] learn of me for I am meek and lowly in
[3:37] heart and ye shall find rest unto your
[3:41] souls for my yoke is easy and my burden
[3:45] is light praise God let's bow our heads
[3:48] here for word of prayer if you have a
[3:49] need on your heart let's make anointing
[3:50] to God I love these words Jesus says
[3:52] come unto me Jesus is always inviting us
[3:54] to have Fellowship
[3:56] Heavenly Father we thank you for tonight
[3:58] Lord God thank you for this reading of
[4:00] your word thank you for the songs all
[4:02] the Akron Saints here and our visitors
[4:04] from Napoleon thank you God for this
[4:06] opportunity to be in your house Lord
[4:07] Jesus it's a joy to sing to you Lord
[4:09] we're saying in our hearts look what
[4:10] you've done Lord God you saved us right
[4:12] on time you've done so much for us so
[4:14] many reasons to praise you Lord God
[4:16] Hallelujah there are so many reasons to
[4:18] Rejoice Lord God in what you've done
[4:20] father take this thought here tonight
[4:22] Lord I just pray you to anoint me God
[4:23] for your purpose Lord God as I try to
[4:26] study on three other subjects or two
[4:27] other subjects here in order this is the
[4:29] one that seemed to have the inspiration
[4:30] so Lord I just pray Lord do my best to
[4:33] follow you you Lord I'm reporting for
[4:35] service Lord God reporting for Duty use
[4:37] me as a king and priest Lord reigning
[4:40] over sin and Lord interceding for the
[4:43] Saints Lord God each person here do the
[4:45] same Lord God may you give us what we
[4:47] have need of for this hour of our our
[4:49] journey our walk with you Lord God
[4:51] so father help us Lord God to come to
[4:53] you Jesus tonight Lord God we've come
[4:55] here physically now let us come to you
[4:56] spiritually Lord God help us to learn of
[4:59] you give you thanks and praise in Jesus
[5:01] Christ's name and the saint said
[5:03] amen God bless you as you're being
[5:04] seated praise God
[5:11] so I'd like to look at the start like I
[5:13] said I might preach maybe two or three
[5:14] services on this we'll kind of see how
[5:16] it goes just as the inspiration allows
[5:18] to have a few slides here and uh
[5:22] you know the thought came to me we were
[5:24] looking at the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[5:25] and Jesus called it rest unto your soul
[5:28] your soul a soul is your the nature the
[5:31] deepest nature of your entire being
[5:34] and so that means before a person's born
[5:36] again uh your soul is not at rest I mean
[5:39] it's it's at Labor
[5:40] right in other words it's working to
[5:42] earn salvation but when the Holy Ghost
[5:45] comes in now the person can rest
[5:47] Hallelujah and then Hebrews remember
[5:49] Hebrews 4 shows us what that means
[5:51] before you're born again you're doing a
[5:53] lot of your own works but then the Bible
[5:55] says when you get the Holy Ghost and the
[5:57] Soul now you do the works of Christ
[5:59] right you do the works of God and that
[6:01] aligns up exactly with Ephesians 2 8-10
[6:04] we're saved by grace through faith uh
[6:06] it's not of ourselves it's the gift of
[6:08] God right but then the Bible said in
[6:10] verse 10 we're created unto good works
[6:12] God created us to do something for him
[6:14] praise God
[6:15] a lot of times it deals closely with our
[6:18] family right raising our children and
[6:20] loving our husband or loving our wife
[6:21] whatever side we're on
[6:23] and raising our children to the honor
[6:26] and glory of the Lord Jesus Christ
[6:28] and that's exactly what God wants and of
[6:31] course we know there's more to it than
[6:32] that but just a brief summary and God
[6:34] wants us to have the Holy Ghost in our
[6:36] souls so our souls so the very so when
[6:39] we close our our eyes at night church
[6:42] you know and there's all these pressure
[6:44] and all these we got a to-do list of our
[6:46] to-do lists
[6:48] we have all these things but we got a
[6:51] list of all these things that we got to
[6:52] try to do tomorrow when we close our
[6:55] eyes at night we can say thank God he
[6:57] saved me he filled me with the Holy
[6:58] Ghost I know it's going to be all right
[6:59] praise God
[7:00] no matter what happens tomorrow my soul
[7:02] rests in Christ Jesus praise God
[7:05] I know what I'm saying I know I'm right
[7:06] with God hallelujah because he's the he
[7:08] started this work he's the author of my
[7:10] life
[7:11] he's the continuer he's the finisher
[7:13] praise God
[7:15] it's just that rest and brothers I just
[7:17] read a quote today brother Adam said he
[7:19] woke up uh from this thought at 11 PM he
[7:22] said the whole Christian journey is
[7:24] about rest and he said I had nobody to
[7:26] preach it to he said so I woke up my
[7:28] wife and preached to her
[7:30] he said he preached till 1am that's a
[7:32] pretty long sermon right there 11 to 12
[7:35] one so two hour sermon I bet sister Mita
[7:38] was really pulling on that one don't you
[7:40] think she got three kids you know three
[7:42] little ones to take care of
[7:46] all these scriptures about resting and
[7:49] and how uh you know we cease from our
[7:52] own Works he actually quotes Hebrews for
[7:53] you know in Matthew 11. he just ties
[7:55] these scriptures together
[7:57] and he says that that's the whole of the
[7:59] Christian life is to rest in God right
[8:02] to trust God and then let God work
[8:05] through you like remember brother
[8:07] Brandon said
[8:08] he said what is the anointing he said
[8:10] the anointing is supreme power but under
[8:12] control
[8:14] so it doesn't have to be loud shouting
[8:16] you don't have to be dancing like I like
[8:18] to do don't it can just be supreme power
[8:22] in control
[8:23] gives the example when Jesus in Luke
[8:26] chapter 4 he goes he's in the synagogue
[8:28] he never missed Church right he was in
[8:30] the church on Saturday and he walked up
[8:32] he picked up the scroll he read Isaiah
[8:35] 61 and he sat down and everybody turned
[8:37] to look at Jesus what are you going to
[8:38] say now
[8:39] everybody turn their necks like the the
[8:41] creek in the neck and looking back like
[8:43] a bunch of cranes or something
[8:45] and he said this day this scripture is
[8:47] fulfilled
[8:48] and brother Ram said that was the
[8:49] greatest anointing on him now of course
[8:51] we know that anointing never left him to
[8:52] the Cross right because God couldn't
[8:54] curse his own spirit
[8:56] right but that that Holy power that
[8:59] unlimited anointing was on him that
[9:01] whole time sometimes he would be happy
[9:04] or sometimes he would be happy like in
[9:05] this case I thank thee God you've hid it
[9:07] from the wise and prudent
[9:09] that's sometimes sometimes we have a
[9:11] hard time with that don't we because we
[9:12] want to see the law saved
[9:14] but there's times when you realize you
[9:16] know you understand God's sovereignty
[9:18] God's going to save all those that are
[9:19] predestinated to be saved and in those
[9:21] moments you know when you're uh when
[9:24] you're thinking about God's point of
[9:25] view you can rejoice and say thank God
[9:27] I'm one of them praise God I was one
[9:30] that God chose to reveal it to praise
[9:32] God
[9:32] and it's hidden from the wise the
[9:34] wealthy and uh the famous and the
[9:36] popular and uh the sinful it's hidden
[9:39] from them because they don't want to see
[9:41] it
[9:42] and Jesus Rejoice now other times he got
[9:44] mad he took the rope and he beat out the
[9:46] money changers
[9:48] and he threw over their tables and said
[9:49] get out you don't make my house or my
[9:51] father's house a house of merchandise
[9:53] this is the House of Prayer
[9:55] amen
[9:57] and so he had this great anointing on
[9:59] him
[10:00] but what we see is that you know the
[10:01] anointing is following God's leadership
[10:03] in each moment of Our Lives
[10:05] Hallelujah so that way sisters when
[10:07] you're at home and hubby's at work
[10:09] whatever you can still have the
[10:10] anointing right on you there to clean
[10:11] the house
[10:13] right or wash dishes or whatever you can
[10:16] have that same anointing praise God
[10:18] say the same anointing that might have
[10:20] caused you to shout or scream or praise
[10:21] the Lord or lay your hands on somebody
[10:23] that got healed you know the previous
[10:24] day but then the same anointing is right
[10:26] on you just praising God
[10:28] thanking God right for the family you
[10:30] got the health you got
[10:32] and brother same for me as a teacher I
[10:34] can get up here I can I can preach and
[10:36] pray for the sick and God heals them at
[10:37] times and I can go to work at school I
[10:40] can sit amongst you know 19
[10:41] six-year-olds and I can just sit there
[10:43] and be a sweet Christian to them praise
[10:45] God and the same anointing praise God
[10:47] right same Holy Spirit
[10:51] and so he was and like brother Branham
[10:53] said brother man said faith is the
[10:55] master of every circumstance
[10:57] you and I are not the Masters
[10:59] faith in this in other words God's
[11:01] spirit is the is the answer to every
[11:03] problem
[11:04] No Matter What circus or circumstance
[11:06] we're in the the master of that
[11:08] circumstance is God's anointing that
[11:10] anointing we're talking about praise God
[11:11] Amen it's that anointing we're talking
[11:14] about and yes then God uses us God uses
[11:17] you know his anointing on us to be the
[11:19] master of it but we're really not the
[11:21] master of it because we've all tried to
[11:23] figure out situations and circumstances
[11:25] and we failed
[11:26] and then went totally opposite about
[11:28] what we thought it was going to go
[11:31] so we're not the master of every
[11:32] circumstance it's Christ in US is the
[11:35] master just like the Bible said greater
[11:36] is he that's in you than he that's in
[11:38] the world praise God
[11:40] Hallelujah son I always want to make
[11:42] sure we give all the credit where it's
[11:43] due it's due to Christ
[11:45] Hallelujah
[11:47] now uh that's just a little brief intro
[11:50] there I didn't have that in my notes
[11:51] really but um let's look at here a few
[11:54] uh quotes before I want to uh you know I
[11:57] had we had other visitors that I thought
[11:59] were going to come and they didn't come
[12:00] that's okay but I just wanted uh there
[12:02] was a pastor that was going to come
[12:04] tonight but I just wanted if he was here
[12:07] I wanted him to read this I'm just going
[12:08] to read it Anyway by God's grace every
[12:10] Doctrine and everything else of the
[12:12] Bible that we have in the church must be
[12:15] based upon the word of God must come
[12:17] from the word
[12:18] not just one place but from Genesis of
[12:20] Revelation it must say the same thing
[12:22] because we cannot base our thoughts upon
[12:24] one little scripture
[12:25] for the Bible said in the mouth of two
[12:27] or three Witnesses let every word be
[12:28] established
[12:30] right brother random gives that famous
[12:31] example where the Bible said Judas went
[12:33] and hung himself and he said a preacher
[12:35] can't take that one person say now you
[12:36] go do the same
[12:38] right the Bible the Bible never says we
[12:40] should commit suicide we should serve
[12:42] God all the days of our life praise God
[12:44] we should fill up the full measure of
[12:46] the days God has ordained for us the
[12:48] Bible said they're all written in God's
[12:50] book praise God
[12:52] so with everything in the Bible we need
[12:54] two or three witnesses to establish a
[12:56] Doctrine an instruction Hallelujah
[12:59] here's another one just familiar with
[13:00] you this is the one I like because it
[13:02] shows brother Adam says if I'm wrong the
[13:04] Bible's always right
[13:06] now we must prove All Things by the
[13:08] tapes no tapes are good tapes are going
[13:11] to point us to the Bible but we must
[13:13] prove All Things by the scripture if
[13:15] it's contrary to my faith and yet the
[13:17] scripture says so the scripture is right
[13:19] and I'm wrong
[13:20] and I know people have a hard time
[13:22] saying brother Ram's wrong and you know
[13:23] I do too it's just we all do as out of
[13:25] our respect for a man of God like who's
[13:27] going to stand up and say uh you know
[13:29] Paul was wrong or or John Wesley was
[13:31] wrong ending the church age Messengers
[13:32] like that would be hard for us to to say
[13:34] but there's times we got to say it
[13:36] because they're all men right they're
[13:38] all fallible they can all make mistakes
[13:40] except Christ cannot make a mistake amen
[13:43] so we say these things with humility
[13:45] because that's what brother Brandon said
[13:47] well Grant said we have to read a Bible
[13:49] verse every every service because my
[13:52] words will fail but God's words can
[13:54] never fail amen
[13:56] he said see the scripture is always
[13:58] right and the only way you can do
[14:00] anything is come back to the scripture
[14:01] now is that true now I'd like to hear
[14:04] you say Amen when you believe it you see
[14:05] amen means so be it now we cannot all
[14:08] right now in this context in Jesus's
[14:11] life brother Adam said I've often
[14:13] thought I'd like to have heard him when
[14:15] he raised up those precious hands and
[14:16] said come unto me so he raised up his
[14:18] hand said come to me now brother I'm
[14:19] just dramatizing right we don't know if
[14:21] he was like this or hands we don't know
[14:23] where the hands were these are
[14:24] dramatizing
[14:25] see that tired weary look on him now
[14:27] this is his first year of ministry
[14:29] but he's already been Healing The Sick
[14:30] and having healing campaigns right he
[14:32] had three pulls to his ministry we
[14:34] talked about that Hallelujah he said
[14:36] come unto me
[14:38] see that tired weary look on him when he
[14:40] was tired and weary from his journey say
[14:43] come unto me all ye that are labor and
[14:46] heavy laden I'll give you rest
[14:49] take my yoke upon you and learn of me
[14:52] he said for I meek and lowly
[14:55] I'd like to have heard him say that I
[14:59] wasn't there in that day I wasn't
[15:00] standing with Peter James and John but I
[15:02] hope I'm standing by them in the day
[15:04] when I can hear him say it was well done
[15:07] good and faithful servant now enter into
[15:09] the joys of the Lord that's beautiful
[15:12] Hallelujah so brother man you know it
[15:15] makes Jesus look like he's tired and
[15:16] weary like we all see black sometimes we
[15:18] get black circles under eyes right so we
[15:20] imagine Jesus he's tired but he said
[15:22] come unto me if you're tired now he's a
[15:24] tired one saying come to me if you're
[15:26] tired
[15:27] right because he was laboring for God
[15:29] but I like this he said all you that
[15:31] labor heavy laden and I'll give you rest
[15:33] now this is this is before the Holy
[15:35] Ghost could be given so at this time
[15:37] he's saying anyone he said everyone
[15:38] who's not born again should come to me
[15:41] and I'll give you rest
[15:43] he said take my yoke upon you now let me
[15:46] stop right there that means everybody
[15:47] else before you're born again you're
[15:49] yoked is something that you don't need
[15:50] to be yoked to
[15:51] like first for me it was my denomination
[15:54] or the mega church I was yoked to before
[15:56] I came to Christ you know or maybe it
[15:58] was my mom my mom's leadership because
[16:01] that's all the only leadership I had
[16:03] or maybe it was your grandma or dad or
[16:05] whoever you are yoked to something but
[16:07] he says you you know to be born again
[16:09] you've got to leave your previous
[16:10] Associates and you got to come to me and
[16:14] you got to yoke yourself with me you got
[16:16] to labor with me see we're going to
[16:17] labor for something we're going to labor
[16:18] for money or popularity or or pleasures
[16:21] of this world but Jesus wants us to
[16:23] labor with him praise God
[16:25] we got to be yoked to something praise
[16:27] God and when you're yoked to Christ you
[16:29] work with him like you walk stepping
[16:31] step and step with them right step with
[16:33] you just take the same steps he does you
[16:35] only like Brotherhood says the bride
[16:37] only does was thus saith the Lord praise
[16:39] God oh my God
[16:42] he said take my yoke upon you and learn
[16:44] of me
[16:46] so we see before you can learn in the
[16:48] natural with animals being yoked
[16:49] together I've only seen it a few times
[16:51] down in Amish Country I've only seen
[16:52] animals yoke together a couple times not
[16:54] too often usually I just see one Amish
[16:56] guy and he's got he's behind one horse
[16:58] or something like that or one ox or
[16:59] something like that I've only seen a
[17:01] couple times where they've been yoked he
[17:03] says so but we see another be in order
[17:05] to be yoked I'm sorry in order to learn
[17:06] you've got to be yoked to him first that
[17:09] means you got to get in close
[17:10] Association right you got to get in real
[17:12] close association with Jesus like like
[17:14] kneeling on your knees or or reading
[17:17] your Bible or looking into the Open
[17:18] Bible is that right amen you got to be
[17:22] yoked to him you got to be laboring for
[17:23] him you have to be near Christ praise
[17:25] God and that's how you learn from Christ
[17:28] you got to come to him and you got to be
[17:30] yoked to him you have to serve him
[17:33] serve his purpose in your life
[17:36] he said for I'm meek and lowly now that
[17:38] means everybody else isn't right that
[17:41] means the world Satan is not very meek
[17:43] he's boastful he's a liar
[17:46] right he's arrogant
[17:48] and he's not lowly
[17:50] so Jesus is the opposite of all these
[17:52] others aren't you glad he's the opposite
[17:55] Hallelujah it's so wonderful that we can
[17:58] always feel his presence because we know
[17:59] it's sacred praise God it's holy it's
[18:02] not the same Spirit you know they'd have
[18:04] at the at the bar tonight
[18:06] totally different like brother Matthew
[18:08] says our spirit is fresh our spirit is
[18:11] clean he said our spirit is sober he
[18:14] said but it's also full the joy of the
[18:15] Lord praise God
[18:18] thank God Amen he said that's he said
[18:21] that's what John said we said when he
[18:22] said I was in this fear on the Lord's
[18:24] Day Hallelujah
[18:26] what a great sweet spirit that we feel
[18:28] when we're gathered in Christ's name
[18:31] oh it's a beautiful beautiful thing
[18:33] so this is again the beginning of Jesus
[18:35] ministry John was wondering are you the
[18:37] Messiah or look for another
[18:40] now I want to if you got your Bibles
[18:42] there handy I'll probably call my
[18:43] children to read the Mosa
[18:45] they were read a few verses here by the
[18:47] grace of God we'll kind of see how it
[18:48] goes
[18:49] now I want to start with this first
[18:50] verse you know Matthew 11 29 I want to
[18:52] look at verses that use the word learn
[18:54] and there's many I think there was over
[18:56] 15 if I'm not mistaken like I said this
[18:59] is part one
[19:01] but I want to start there in Matthew
[19:05] 11 29.
[19:07] so there are 60 verses in the entire
[19:08] Bible I just looked up there that used
[19:10] the word learn
[19:13] and uh you know of course in Parts two
[19:15] and three I can go over all these
[19:17] and just kind of show the importance of
[19:19] learning it's been misunderstood and uh
[19:22] and it's understandable you know brother
[19:24] random many times brother random was he
[19:27] was pointing out how colleges and high
[19:28] schools were already so liberal in his
[19:31] day now what are they today you know
[19:33] but brother man was making the point you
[19:35] know education many times overall is of
[19:38] the devil right as far as when they they
[19:40] indoctrinate you with awful things
[19:43] but we have to we have to know how to
[19:45] read the Bible
[19:46] so we do need education
[19:48] we have to learn to read for our bosses
[19:49] right that's a maybe type for our bosses
[19:52] we have to learn the you know I'm a
[19:53] teacher so I like education when it's a
[19:55] right a good education
[19:57] but but Ram's making the point the
[19:59] majority of schools are Heathen schools
[20:02] right you know they're teaching us
[20:03] they're teaching wicked things
[20:07] but see we uh you know and then you know
[20:09] brother ramble brother Rand Will Blast
[20:11] preachers that have Doctorate Degrees
[20:16] and yet uh
[20:17] and yet you know there's nothing wrong
[20:19] with learning about the history of the
[20:20] Bible
[20:22] but it's only wrong when you when you
[20:24] crucify the effects of the Holy Ghost
[20:25] right
[20:27] that that's what it's really awful when
[20:29] you say the whole well Jesus isn't the
[20:31] same today Jesus doesn't heal today and
[20:34] Jesus uh that that part of the Bible
[20:36] that doesn't apply today like we've all
[20:39] heard those those serpents you're right
[20:40] they the serpents spit out those lies
[20:42] right we've all heard that
[20:45] there's nothing wrong with you know
[20:46] learning about history and then nothing
[20:49] wrong with that at all
[20:51] but
[20:52] when we get into human philosophies and
[20:55] and human ideas like everybody has to
[20:57] speak in tongues right or just human
[20:59] philosophies like that or we should pray
[21:00] to marry and pray to the Saints those
[21:02] are human philosophies and that's those
[21:04] are doctrines of devils
[21:07] because they make you they anoint you
[21:09] with the wrong Spirit to seek the gifts
[21:11] instead of The Giver
[21:13] or teach you spiritualism instead of
[21:15] Holy Spirit Worship praise God
[21:17] praying to Jesus Christ the high priest
[21:19] amen we don't need any other
[21:21] intercessors we've already got the
[21:23] perfect one praise God we've got Jesus
[21:25] Christ and his ears always open to our
[21:27] prayers Hallelujah
[21:30] so it's understandable you know why some
[21:31] people would say well learning is not
[21:33] even a word I would use if I come to
[21:35] church
[21:36] well then you haven't read your Bible
[21:37] lately
[21:38] it's time to read your Bible too yes you
[21:41] listen to tapes but yes read your Bible
[21:43] too praise God have a balance of the
[21:45] word of God
[21:46] right
[21:48] but this word learned in the Greek means
[21:50] to understand so 24 times it's learn and
[21:53] then one time it's understand and it
[21:56] means to increase your knowledge
[21:58] now the word knowledge courses having
[22:00] understanding I've gone over that
[22:01] numerous times but I like this one as
[22:03] well when you learn you actually use
[22:05] what you've been taught
[22:07] now we all know we went to math class we
[22:10] learned a lot of stuff but then we never
[22:11] used it once we got out of math class
[22:13] right so did we really learn it no no
[22:17] you only really learn it when you use it
[22:19] praise God
[22:20] right
[22:22] like I've watched all these YouTube
[22:23] videos about how to you know fix the
[22:26] plumbing when it's leaking and sometimes
[22:27] I get it sometimes I don't so I really
[22:29] haven't learned it yet you know I really
[22:31] haven't learned I'm just watching and
[22:32] trying to imitate it how to unclog that
[22:34] sink
[22:36] now Simon and cam could Dustin they
[22:38] could come to in a moment's time right
[22:39] they really learned it they can use it
[22:42] they can practice it
[22:44] but it also means to be the habit of I
[22:46] like that because uh Peter says we must
[22:48] be diligent in all things
[22:50] we must have good habits
[22:53] if we don't have the good habit yet we
[22:54] haven't learned it yet and church
[22:56] there's nothing wrong with saying that
[22:58] right like a couple years ago in in our
[23:00] school
[23:01] are are uh I'm just talking a natural
[23:03] type here in our elementary middle
[23:06] school and high school they had this big
[23:08] movement called The Power of yet
[23:11] now it sounds funny to us but but it was
[23:13] true
[23:15] the kids would sometimes say well I
[23:18] haven't learned that or I don't know
[23:19] that and the teachers were trained tell
[23:21] them to add the word yet on the end
[23:24] because yet gives you hope you're going
[23:26] to learn it eventually
[23:28] and it was a big move you know the kids
[23:30] say well I can't read I would say you
[23:32] can't read yet
[23:33] but you're getting close you're closer
[23:36] than you were last week right
[23:38] it's the power of yet so I want to
[23:40] encourage you if you don't have the
[23:41] habits that you want yet that's okay you
[23:45] can still get them praise God there's
[23:47] hope for us amen I don't have all the
[23:48] habits I want praise God but I want to
[23:50] develop Christian habits praise God
[23:52] I just don't have them yet
[23:55] but I can look back from last year since
[23:56] I've got some ones I didn't have last
[23:58] year right I understand some things now
[24:01] I can use some things now that I
[24:03] couldn't use last year like dancing amen
[24:06] praise God
[24:08] so things you're accustomed to you're
[24:09] learning them
[24:11] you're practicing them you've got good
[24:12] habits
[24:13] you've learned it and Jesus says
[24:17] we need to do this
[24:20] people say well I just can't learn to do
[24:22] that I can't I can't do that when it
[24:24] comes to Jesus well then you just got to
[24:25] come to him more
[24:27] because he's right there ready to teach
[24:28] you
[24:29] and did you did you see what he said
[24:32] he's a Meek teacher
[24:34] now we all know the teachers that scream
[24:36] at us
[24:37] most of us don't like those kind of
[24:38] teachers and I'm not one of those kind
[24:40] of teachers
[24:42] but we don't like those
[24:44] uh we don't like those brazen
[24:46] right um red face and they get so mad
[24:49] they want to blow up at you and so you
[24:51] you you're a failure you can never learn
[24:53] this and I don't like you in my class
[24:55] get out of my class we don't like those
[24:56] kind of teachers doing
[24:57] Jesus is not that way he's humble
[25:01] he's meek
[25:03] so we have to discern is this who's
[25:05] beating me up here is it the devil or
[25:06] Jesus well Jesus says I'm meek and lowly
[25:09] of heart
[25:10] I'm a patient teacher
[25:13] now are there times we get spanked by
[25:15] Jesus yes yes many prophets got spanked
[25:18] Jonah got spanked pretty bad by getting
[25:20] tossed out of a ship right
[25:21] get swallowed up by a large fish a whale
[25:25] I mean there's going to be times he's
[25:26] trying to get our attention but that's
[25:28] just because we're stubborn sometimes
[25:29] and the church said like we're all we're
[25:31] all stubborn at times
[25:34] just like even even our Swedish teachers
[25:36] sometimes they get a little Stern
[25:39] they do get a little certain sometimes
[25:41] if I just want to just point this out
[25:42] Jesus is first of all meek and lowly
[25:46] he's humble didn't Jesus say the
[25:49] greatest among you will be what the
[25:51] servants
[25:52] so Jesus leads by example he says Watch
[25:55] How I serve and then you do what I do
[25:58] real humble
[26:00] right find a way to serve other people
[26:02] that's where you'll find Jesus
[26:04] Hallelujah
[26:07] so is the is the word learn a good word
[26:09] yes it's a good word as long as you're
[26:12] using it the right way
[26:13] let's look at another one now I put up
[26:15] here just in Red so you would catch it
[26:18] learn is the same as increasing
[26:20] knowledge right or understanding
[26:21] but Revelation is also the appearing or
[26:24] the coming of knowledge
[26:26] so learn in Revelation are very similar
[26:29] like the word reveal means to unveil
[26:33] right if I said
[26:35] if I said what's under this you know I
[26:37] put this over here
[26:38] it's veiled right but as soon as I
[26:40] unveil it oh now now I I understand
[26:43] what's under there now I've learned
[26:44] what's under there
[26:46] very similar definitions
[26:48] okay very simple and it's even in the
[26:50] scripture that the god of our Lord Jesus
[26:52] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[26:54] you the spirit now it's the spirit
[26:56] praise God that's what we need the Holy
[26:58] Spirit to learn praise God
[27:00] in other words you got to say Lord
[27:01] anoint me with the learner Spirit anoint
[27:03] me with the spirit I want to learn from
[27:04] you praise God
[27:06] because everything inside of us our sin
[27:08] nature is all fighting against I don't
[27:09] want to learn I don't want to grow as a
[27:11] Christian that's what your sin nature is
[27:13] saying your body's saying I don't want
[27:14] to pray I don't want to read my Bible I
[27:15] don't want to go to church I don't want
[27:17] to testify but the holy spirit inside of
[27:19] you says you need to praise God
[27:21] you need to learn how to do that more
[27:22] praise God I need to learn how to do
[27:24] that more praise God
[27:27] so it's a spirit of wisdom and
[27:29] Revelation in the knowledge
[27:31] so the unveiling or the appearing in the
[27:35] understanding
[27:37] okay so me just to make it simple I
[27:40] would use learn and reveal
[27:41] interchangeably
[27:43] well now you get into Faith as a
[27:44] revelation I get into that too right if
[27:46] you if you have if you have a revelation
[27:48] of something you have faith that's going
[27:50] to happen right you have you have trust
[27:51] it's going to happen
[27:52] well that means you've all you've also
[27:54] learned it's going to happen
[27:56] right you've learned oh I've learned to
[27:58] trust God I've learned from this from
[28:01] God this is going to happen I've got
[28:02] faith
[28:03] so see these are very close together and
[28:05] I don't mean to you know nitpick at
[28:07] words but I'm just giving you an
[28:08] understanding of what these words mean
[28:10] so then it doesn't feel bad to to say
[28:13] well I came here to learn tonight
[28:15] now most people you know most churches
[28:17] if you walk into them imagine the
[28:18] message if you walked in and said well
[28:20] I'm here to learn tonight they'd say you
[28:21] Heathen you know or they say something
[28:24] like that you backslider you're lukewarm
[28:26] but Jesus said come and learn of me
[28:30] come and learn
[28:32] I want you to learn from me I'm really
[28:34] Meek I'm really lonely
[28:36] yoke yourself to me
[28:38] work with me praise God and I'll show
[28:40] you how to have rest for your soul
[28:43] praise God
[28:46] so I'm just going to use those
[28:47] interchangeably learn is to increase
[28:48] your understanding
[28:50] and Revelation is the coming of your
[28:52] understanding
[28:54] so it comes right and then you learn it
[28:56] you you see the Revelation and you learn
[28:58] it then you have a habit of it
[29:00] Hallelujah
[29:01] it's a good thought I think it's a good
[29:03] good set of scriptures to place together
[29:05] now there's 24 verses that use that same
[29:07] Greek word of learn and here's one of
[29:10] them
[29:11] people that say they don't want to learn
[29:13] well
[29:14] you don't know what you're saying
[29:16] so you don't know what you're saying
[29:19] because the Bible says though he were a
[29:21] son yet he learned obedience by the
[29:24] things which he suffered
[29:27] and I don't have to ask anybody to raise
[29:28] their hand here I'm sure we all need to
[29:30] learn how to suffer
[29:32] learn how to
[29:34] take suffering as an opportunity to
[29:36] learn something about obeying God
[29:41] right
[29:42] and see what does that do and that makes
[29:43] you perfect or makes you complete it
[29:46] makes you the best believer that you can
[29:48] be
[29:49] it makes you the best representative of
[29:51] Christ that you possibly can when you
[29:53] learn to look at your sufferings as this
[29:55] is my opportunity
[29:57] to learn
[30:00] church and Austin I've been talking
[30:02] about it you know any any sickness is
[30:04] opportunity to learn Financial trials
[30:06] opportunity to learn
[30:07] learn to trust God learn to obey God
[30:10] right family family disagreements that's
[30:13] a great opportunity to learn right there
[30:17] I'll just admit you know I wasn't a very
[30:19] good husband when we first got married
[30:20] but by God's grace I hope I've learned
[30:21] to be a better one honey
[30:24] yeah she said yes okay everybody hear
[30:26] that now
[30:27] I grew I learned
[30:28] I hope myself to Christ
[30:31] but no really that that's that's how it
[30:33] all has to be
[30:35] you know and I had to make many mistakes
[30:36] to learn how to be a better husband or a
[30:38] better father or a better pastor
[30:41] same thing for you a better a per a
[30:44] better a holy ghost anointed member the
[30:46] laity
[30:48] we got to learn how to do that it's
[30:50] possible
[30:53] so we'll suffer many times so God can
[30:55] teach us to obey him
[30:58] the next time
[31:01] Hallelujah
[31:04] so and he became perfect through this
[31:07] suffering and so you and I can't be
[31:09] completed unless we learn through our
[31:11] sufferings
[31:12] right our trials now the beautiful part
[31:15] is many times in our sufferings will
[31:16] suffer but then God will bring some
[31:18] amazing answer to prayer Even in our
[31:20] suffering even when we don't deserve it
[31:23] can anybody say Amen to that
[31:25] like we weren't faithful the whole time
[31:27] and we weren't overcoming we weren't
[31:28] speaking the word the whole time yet God
[31:30] will come around and do something great
[31:31] for us
[31:33] but he's teaching us be next time be
[31:36] patient longer
[31:38] next time testify a little longer hold
[31:41] on a little longer next time right
[31:44] that's stretching our muscles our
[31:46] spiritual muscles right stretching our
[31:47] face making us stronger in Christ
[31:51] hopefully somebody will come around and
[31:52] say well remember last time like when we
[31:54] were suffering hopefully one of our
[31:55] Saints and one of our friends will come
[31:56] along and say well remember last time I
[31:58] was struggling this God help me through
[31:59] it God will help you through it be
[32:00] encouraged
[32:06] and think about that church
[32:07] nobody could come and take Jesus
[32:09] suffering for him Peter was like I'll
[32:11] die with you
[32:13] did he
[32:14] not not there
[32:17] you see sometimes Church even I we have
[32:19] to learn to sometimes we gotta let our
[32:21] Saints suffer a little bit
[32:22] right especially parents you know at
[32:24] some point you gotta let your kids
[32:25] suffer a little bit
[32:28] you have to they got to learn lessons
[32:31] and I don't mean throw them out to the
[32:32] devil that's not what I mean
[32:36] but I mean you got to let them make
[32:37] mistakes they gotta let them make their
[32:39] own choices and then learn from their
[32:40] choices
[32:42] nobody could take Jesus sufferings like
[32:44] remember he prayed he Brother Brad said
[32:45] he prayed to dodge the cross but he
[32:47] ultimately said let your will be done
[32:49] not my will be done
[32:52] he had to learn
[32:53] he had to learn this for the joy that
[32:55] was set before he had to learn as we
[32:57] looked at it on Sunday the joy that's
[32:58] how he got through no weapon amen no
[33:00] weapon that was formed against Jesus
[33:02] could Prosper praise God
[33:04] he learned
[33:05] every weapon that came Adam of Satan
[33:08] that attacked him he overcame and he
[33:10] learned to obey God in all of it
[33:12] there's 30 minutes already
[33:15] what a great what a great group of
[33:17] scriptures the Lord give us on the word
[33:18] learning
[33:20] now did you remember this one
[33:23] Jesus said this is red letters it is
[33:25] written in the prophets and they shall
[33:27] be all taught of God
[33:29] every man therefore that hath heard and
[33:31] hath learned of the father cometh to me
[33:34] now Look at that interesting I just
[33:35] caught that Jesus said come to me and
[33:38] I'll give you rest well first he said
[33:40] you got to learn to the father and then
[33:42] come to Jesus
[33:44] so you gotta you gotta learn in other
[33:46] words the father's the Holy Ghost right
[33:48] so the first time God works on your
[33:49] heart right it's through the Holy Ghost
[33:52] right and then it brings us to now for
[33:54] us it brings us to the words of Jesus
[33:56] but in his day it brought him to the it
[33:58] brought them to the literal body of
[34:00] Jesus God's son does everybody
[34:01] understand
[34:03] and today you know the holy spirit will
[34:05] bring us to make intercession to the
[34:07] high priest the body of Jesus in heaven
[34:09] the glorified body in heaven
[34:12] see that isn't that awesome you got to
[34:14] learn from the Holy Spirit and then you
[34:15] can learn from the son
[34:17] oh my Hallelujah this deep and Rich
[34:20] already by God's grace
[34:22] Hallelujah
[34:23] and did you know brother RAM used this
[34:25] verse to explain the baptism of the Holy
[34:27] Ghost
[34:28] so what are we getting at only the
[34:30] people with the Holy Ghost will learn to
[34:32] be better Christians
[34:33] remember the foolish version they won't
[34:35] go on and get more oil they won't they
[34:37] won't learn how to get oil at the right
[34:39] time look at that
[34:40] say what they knew better they could
[34:43] have they could have learned that
[34:45] they could learn oh before night falls
[34:46] you better go get some they should have
[34:48] known that they can learn that
[34:50] he did it
[34:52] God's true church will learn to get the
[34:54] oil now amen God's true bride will learn
[34:58] to get the Holy Ghost now well there's
[34:59] time Hallelujah oh thank God there's
[35:02] time Hallelujah
[35:04] amen
[35:07] and like I talked about you know a few
[35:08] weeks ago
[35:10] like brother Ram said we you don't want
[35:12] to be a moss-back Christian right
[35:14] how does moss form right it's just
[35:16] something that sits still and it gets
[35:17] moisture on it and Moss builds up
[35:19] everyone said you don't want to be that
[35:21] kind of a Christian you want to sit you
[35:22] don't want to sit around and do nothing
[35:23] for God do you want to do something for
[35:25] God right because say like this you want
[35:27] to get cleaned off for Jesus you want to
[35:28] get cleaned off and be working for Jesus
[35:29] amen
[35:31] you don't want to sit still and do
[35:32] nothing we got to find what does God
[35:34] called me to do in other words get yoke
[35:36] to Jesus and start working for Jesus
[35:37] amen
[35:39] see
[35:40] oh it's beautiful
[35:42] thought
[35:44] there's a quote it's from page 140. to
[35:47] further bring out what we've just said
[35:48] and to also use a scripture that should
[35:50] be born in the mind as we talk about who
[35:52] it is that's baptized with the Holy
[35:54] Ghost see what Jesus says in John 6 45.
[35:57] it is written in the prophets and they
[35:58] shall all be taught of God
[36:01] but turn to Isaiah 54 13 whence this is
[36:04] taken and it reads and all thy children
[36:07] shall be taught of the Lord
[36:09] the all of God are the children of God
[36:12] in church we said on Sunday when are you
[36:14] the Sons and Daughters of God
[36:16] who remembers
[36:17] now let's say it together now you're not
[36:20] the Son of God later or a daughter of
[36:22] God you're a son or daughter of God
[36:24] right now praise God
[36:26] amen you are right now it's now
[36:28] you can go to your father now because
[36:30] you got a relationship with Daddy
[36:32] Hallelujah
[36:33] amen you've got a relationship with the
[36:35] father hallelujah amen thank God
[36:37] Hallelujah
[36:38] thus it is that the evidence of being a
[36:41] true child of God he whom the spirit has
[36:43] come upon and indwells is again set
[36:46] forth as one taught the word by the Holy
[36:49] Ghost
[36:50] isn't that wonderful
[36:51] oh it's so beautiful
[36:54] so who's got the Holy Ghost those that
[36:56] can learn of Christ
[36:58] those can those that can keep hearing
[37:00] the word of God and develop the right
[37:02] habits
[37:03] right and become a better understanding
[37:07] of Jesus and live a life that pleases
[37:10] Christ
[37:13] at the end at the end of the sermon I'm
[37:15] going to ask you what do you need to
[37:16] learn
[37:17] and the fact that you're still alive
[37:18] means you need to learn something praise
[37:19] God so don't say you got to all figure
[37:21] it out
[37:23] fool anybody and act like well I'm the
[37:25] perfect person or I'm the perfect
[37:27] Christian let's not act like that we all
[37:29] can learn something
[37:30] praise God
[37:32] we can all grow in understanding we can
[37:34] all grow in Revelation
[37:36] I'll be the first one to say I need to
[37:38] grow in that praise God
[37:41] that's why I keep coming to church
[37:43] that's why I keep worshiping that's why
[37:44] I keep reading my Bible that's why I
[37:45] keep praying that's why I keep preaching
[37:47] praise God because I got things I can
[37:49] learn
[37:50] now John 7 14. now about the midst of
[37:53] the feast Jesus went up in the temple
[37:55] and taught and the Jewish Marvel was
[37:56] saying how know if this man letters
[37:58] having never learned now they're talking
[38:00] about the fair School of Pharisees
[38:04] Jesus answered and said my Doctrine is
[38:07] not mine so my learning is not mine but
[38:09] his that set me
[38:11] Hallelujah
[38:13] see in church Jesus knew the Bible
[38:16] better than anybody because he was the
[38:18] word amen
[38:19] he was the word made flesh you know we
[38:22] always hear the quote you know the
[38:22] Pharisees had the the Scrolls memorized
[38:25] they could put a pin and they'd know
[38:26] exactly where it was and and and and
[38:28] Satan's got the Bible memorized well so
[38:30] did Jesus because he was the word
[38:33] let's not make the Pharisees and Satan
[38:34] like smarter than Jesus Jesus is the
[38:37] word of God hallelujah can't fool Jesus
[38:40] he knows every prophecy every word and
[38:43] not one John Orton will fail Hallelujah
[38:45] [Music]
[38:46] let's make sure we exalt Jesus where he
[38:48] needs to be amen higher amen High way
[38:51] higher than the devil let's stop Satan
[38:53] Lord and let's put Jesus Higher praise
[38:55] God
[38:57] he was and is the word
[38:59] but Satan has it memorized but not the
[39:01] Revelation remember he didn't have the
[39:03] Revelation that if I kill the Messiah
[39:05] he'll raised on the third day the Bible
[39:07] said the prince of this world would not
[39:09] have done that they would not have
[39:10] killed Jesus if they knew what it was
[39:12] going to accomplish
[39:14] they might the devil might have had it
[39:15] memorized but he didn't understand he
[39:17] didn't have the revelation of it
[39:19] but look now he's got a Jesus up here
[39:21] he's got Jesus in there
[39:23] I'm Satan Satan's got a battle with the
[39:25] Jesus right there
[39:27] amen is that right
[39:29] he's gonna and then the Bible said
[39:31] Greater Works than this shall you do
[39:33] because I go to my father amen there's
[39:35] more miracle workers there's more power
[39:37] of the holy spirit in a many-membered
[39:39] bride not just one man but it's in the
[39:41] bride of Christ Hallelujah it's better
[39:44] that way praise God
[39:45] amen hallelujah
[39:50] Jesus has both the memory and the
[39:52] Revelation the word of God that's what
[39:54] we need by God's grace of course we
[39:56] don't have to memorize the Bible but we
[39:57] have to have the revelation of the word
[39:58] of God and yes at the right you know as
[40:01] much as we can let's write the
[40:03] memorization of the word of God in our
[40:04] hearts
[40:05] Hallelujah
[40:08] Luke 14 25 and there went great
[40:10] multitudes with him and he turned and
[40:12] said unto them if any man come unto me
[40:14] and hate not his father his mother and
[40:15] his wife and children and Brethren and
[40:17] sisters yay and his own life also he
[40:19] cannot be my disciple
[40:21] so he's basically saying you have to
[40:23] love Jesus Christ more than any person
[40:25] in your family
[40:26] and whosoever doth not bear his cross
[40:28] and come after me cannot be my disciple
[40:33] all right
[40:35] so you have to love Jesus so much you're
[40:37] willing to lose any physical
[40:39] relationship like Doris did praise God
[40:41] Amen
[40:42] you're a real disciple there sister
[40:44] traveled across the country
[40:47] to be a disciple of Christ
[40:48] hallelujah amen that's beautiful praise
[40:51] God
[40:54] but Jesus said if you cannot bear the
[40:55] cross and you cannot come after him now
[40:57] there it is come again right he said
[40:58] come unto me and I says You must come
[41:00] after me praise God
[41:02] that means he's going somewhere right
[41:04] if you've got a cross and you're
[41:05] supposed to come after him well he's
[41:07] going somewhere where is he leading to
[41:08] he's leading you to heaven praise God
[41:11] Hallelujah
[41:13] but you can't be a disciple unless you
[41:15] take up your cross and follow the lord
[41:16] sounds like a good yoke doesn't it the
[41:18] cross sounds like a good yoke
[41:20] I'm yoked to Christ Hallelujah I've got
[41:23] to die to myself to follow Christ
[41:26] what's the word disciple mean the word
[41:28] disciple means a learner there is
[41:30] learner
[41:31] learner
[41:34] whosoever does not bear his cross and
[41:36] come after me cannot be my learner now
[41:38] look it's going to be a learner because
[41:40] you're Jesus learner I like the Mind
[41:42] front of that learner
[41:43] I'm Jesus's learner
[41:46] right I'm not I'm not the universities
[41:48] learner I'm Jesus's learner
[41:50] I belong to him praise God I'm his
[41:53] little child I'm as I'm a son Hallelujah
[41:55] and he's teaching me as I follow after
[41:57] him
[42:00] so we learn from Jesus we cannot be his
[42:02] disciples if we do not crucify our
[42:05] sinful desires every single day
[42:07] it's impossible
[42:10] and you don't have to raise your hand
[42:11] but I'm sure most of you if not all of
[42:13] you crucified some sinful desires today
[42:16] so God bless you you group of your
[42:17] wonderful group of disciples here
[42:19] tonight
[42:20] right you're learning
[42:22] you're learning you're understanding how
[42:24] to follow Christ
[42:27] Glory
[42:31] so we must take the cross and then we
[42:32] become learners
[42:34] and look at that now I cannot I mean
[42:36] it's a it's a it's a direct command like
[42:38] this is impossible it's impossible to be
[42:41] a learner if you don't go through the
[42:43] self-crucifixion of your sinful desires
[42:45] it's impossible
[42:47] right it's impossible
[42:51] then Jesus said to those Jews which
[42:52] believed on him if you continue in my
[42:54] word then you are my Learners indeed
[42:57] I'll just put that word in there because
[42:58] it means the same thing
[43:01] so you're not a true learner unless you
[43:03] keep staying in the word of God week
[43:05] after week month after month year after
[43:07] year for some of us decade after decade
[43:09] I just passed two decades a few years
[43:10] ago Hallelujah we just keep going we and
[43:14] and as we go then we become the Learners
[43:16] uh God wants us to be and when I just
[43:19] started teaching you know back in 2004
[43:21] uh three you know 2004
[43:24] another slogan in the schools was a
[43:26] lifelong learner I remember that was
[43:28] brand new everybody was saying it
[43:29] lifelong learner lifelong learner you're
[43:32] not there yet you're not there yet I
[43:34] mean all these sayings that just go
[43:35] through the school systems right you
[43:36] they teach you something new you do it
[43:38] for a few years and you learn something
[43:39] else right
[43:40] they're slogans well that was the
[43:42] beginning I'm a lifelong learner and
[43:44] then I just dawned to me you know not
[43:45] long after that that's what I am as a
[43:47] Christian
[43:48] I don't want to be satisfied with what I
[43:49] know about Jesus I want to know more
[43:51] about Jesus praise God there's more of
[43:54] Jesus to know praise God I tell you I
[43:56] tell you I need to know him better as a
[43:57] father
[43:58] and pretty soon if God terrorists I'm
[44:00] gonna have to know him as a grandfather
[44:03] I got a lot to know
[44:04] I got a lot to learn praise God
[44:06] right
[44:08] I've got a lot to learn as a pastor I
[44:11] still got a lot to learn
[44:12] Hallelujah I mean think about different
[44:14] stages of life that you have to learn
[44:16] there's more learning to do each stage
[44:19] but like I preached an important The
[44:21] Best Is Yet To Come the best is when you
[44:22] see your children walking in the truth
[44:25] there's no Greater Joy than that praise
[44:28] God Amen
[44:29] to see your children walk in the truth
[44:31] of God's word hallelujah No Greater Joy
[44:33] praise God
[44:36] it's greater than the joy of Divine
[44:37] Healing
[44:39] right it's greater than the joy of a
[44:41] revelation or dream or prophecy it's
[44:43] greater than that is to see your
[44:45] children walk in the truth
[44:47] and if you're Paul you didn't have
[44:48] natural children so he rejoiced when he
[44:50] saw the Corinthians walking the truth
[44:52] amen hallelujah so I guess as a pastor I
[44:55] can see two kinds of children walking
[44:56] the truth my own children and then the
[44:59] sheep that I feed by God's grace
[45:02] I could have two Joys amen double Joy
[45:05] double portion Hallelujah
[45:08] so we got to continue we got to stay
[45:10] with the word the Revelation the message
[45:12] of the hour and then we're Jesus is
[45:14] Learners
[45:15] and then you should know the truth and
[45:17] the truth should make you free well now
[45:18] we get the idea you can't be free unless
[45:20] you learn how to be free praise God
[45:22] you know people they struggle in there
[45:24] you know and I didn't do
[45:26] it totally Christian I struggle with
[45:27] addiction the struggle with these I've
[45:29] always felt like I was bound up or I was
[45:30] forced to do it but you can learn how to
[45:33] not do it praise God
[45:34] you can learn to be free praise God you
[45:37] can learn to to help Christ Christ and
[45:40] break those chains Hallelujah you can
[45:42] learn how to get out of the present
[45:43] house amen hallelujah and be a free
[45:46] God's free man God's free woman you can
[45:48] learn how to do it praise God Amen Mary
[45:50] Magdalene learned how to be free from
[45:52] Seven demons praise God
[45:54] what you do she come to Jesus she yoked
[45:56] Upon Jesus and Jesus delivered her from
[45:58] Seven demons praise God if she could do
[46:01] it we can do it praise God
[46:03] we can all learn
[46:05] how to be free
[46:08] right we can all understand
[46:10] how to be free and program tells us you
[46:13] got to expose Satan
[46:16] and many times that means sometimes you
[46:18] got to confess your sins to somebody
[46:19] else now not always
[46:23] you have to tell everybody all your deep
[46:24] dark troubles
[46:26] but you got to confess it to God In
[46:28] Prayer
[46:29] you got to say Jesus I'm like the
[46:31] prodigal I'm the guilty one I'm sitting
[46:33] against you I've sinned against my
[46:35] fellow man I've sinned against my father
[46:36] I sinned against heaven and you got to
[46:38] expose Satan and then die out to it
[46:41] praise God die out to your sin and
[46:43] that's Jesus Take that away and make my
[46:45] house clean sweep out my house and then
[46:47] fill my house with your love praise God
[46:50] oh God fill my house with the spirit of
[46:52] wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge
[46:55] of Christ amen there it is amen
[46:57] there it is hallelujah thank you Jesus
[47:01] I love the word of God
[47:04] thank you Lord I see that's what Christ
[47:06] did in my life praise God
[47:09] Hallelujah Jesus
[47:12] how many want to continue in the word of
[47:13] God
[47:15] so I want to be a real learner
[47:17] I don't want to be one of those Learners
[47:18] we're going to get to at the end of the
[47:19] sermon
[47:20] maybe I'm at the end now we'll see how
[47:22] many slides I got forgot me to have it
[47:24] now I'm not going to read through all
[47:25] this but
[47:27] the Bible says only the disciples bear
[47:30] much fruit
[47:32] now remember I'm going to drop this in
[47:34] here too there's three kinds of fruit
[47:36] there's fruit when you just get saved
[47:37] because because John the Baptist said
[47:39] bring forth fruits of repentance
[47:42] there's fruit fruits you have when you
[47:44] just got saved right you can see a new
[47:45] Christian they're on fire they're joyful
[47:48] they they feel forgiven that's a fruit
[47:50] of the spirit
[47:52] and then there's fruits of
[47:53] sanctification
[47:54] right you start getting your life
[47:55] cleaned up starting to get the good
[47:57] habits there's fruits of that wow I can
[47:59] tell this person's really changed look
[48:01] he don't cuss anymore she don't cuss
[48:03] anymore uh they they took out all their
[48:05] jewelry you know they're whatever nose
[48:07] rings and everything
[48:11] for me it was I cut my long hair off you
[48:13] know
[48:14] I had long hair I'd cut my hair that's a
[48:16] fruit of repentance amen
[48:18] but then there's also fruits of the Holy
[48:20] Spirit praise God like love joy and
[48:22] Temperance and long-suffering and
[48:23] godliness amen all these fruits
[48:29] and this makes me ask the question well
[48:31] then who are the true Disciples of
[48:32] brother Brown's message
[48:34] it's the ones who learn the word of God
[48:37] that brother Adam taught
[48:39] right not just memorize the stories I
[48:41] thank God for the stories but those
[48:43] stories got to point us back to the word
[48:44] of God hallelujah
[48:46] that story might not apply to you
[48:50] like let's go back to the Hattie right
[48:52] one like how many of us are ever going
[48:53] to have I mean we might but how many of
[48:55] us are ever going to tell somebody Haven
[48:56] say whatever you want and I'm it's going
[48:58] to be right here right now I mean how
[48:59] many how many of us are actually gonna
[49:01] be able to say
[49:02] it very few
[49:04] but yet we can learn from that right we
[49:06] can learn that idea of the truth of
[49:08] speak to the mountain and it'll move
[49:11] right or speak to the Rock it'll bring
[49:12] forth water
[49:14] but we get the uh ought to raise our
[49:16] faith right to say what the spirit wants
[49:19] us to say in the right time so we love
[49:21] all the stories we love the taste we
[49:22] love everything but it's got to point us
[49:24] back to the word of God hallelujah
[49:28] and even with Divine Healing or someone
[49:30] if we learn from Brother man's healing
[49:32] well that doesn't apply to all of us
[49:33] because we all don't have the gift of
[49:35] healing the Bible says
[49:38] right so we gotta learn to apply these
[49:41] the right way
[49:42] Lord raise my faith to use the gifts the
[49:45] particular gifts that are in my life
[49:47] praise God
[49:48] and church the more gifts you got the
[49:50] more accountable you are
[49:52] right the more you're gonna have to
[49:54] answer
[49:56] Hallelujah and preachers get the hardest
[49:59] judgment right that's what the Bible
[50:00] says
[50:02] he said be not many Masters be not many
[50:04] preachers because they're going to be
[50:05] judged the harshest
[50:07] I better be praying up more by God's
[50:09] grace right we all got to pray up praise
[50:11] God
[50:12] we want to live as close as we can
[50:14] praise God the true disciples are the
[50:17] ones who abide in Christ they're yoked
[50:19] to Christ
[50:21] I'm gonna go down to verse eight because
[50:23] we're familiar with this
[50:24] now my life verse is in verse 5 right
[50:26] without me you can do nothing but verse
[50:28] 8 here it is my father glorified that
[50:30] you bear much fruit so shall you be my
[50:33] disciples
[50:35] can't be Learners unless we are yoked
[50:38] with Christ and then we learn from
[50:40] Christ we learn and understand how to
[50:42] serve him
[50:44] at the same time we're taking up the
[50:45] cross we're dying to our lusts of our
[50:47] flesh and our pride in life and lust of
[50:49] our eyes at the same time we're dying
[50:51] out to those things and that's when we
[50:53] can bear fruit for Christ
[50:55] oh it's beautiful
[50:56] I love placing all these scriptures
[50:58] together side by side because you can
[50:59] see them okay now this this has to go
[51:01] like this my life I got to come to
[51:03] Christ
[51:04] I gotta be yoke to Christ amen I gotta
[51:07] take up a cross and then I can learn
[51:09] Hallelujah that I can be a true disciple
[51:11] then I can have fruits in my life praise
[51:13] God
[51:15] Hallelujah
[51:18] now this is the one I saw cam use a few
[51:20] weeks ago I don't know you guys saw that
[51:22] the four kinds of grounds there are four
[51:24] reactions to the gospel right this is
[51:26] the wise version It's the only one that
[51:27] brings forth good fruit the only one
[51:29] that has fruit Holy Ghost filled fruit
[51:30] is the wise virgin
[51:32] the foolish version doesn't have Holy
[51:34] Ghost fruit fruit but they can have you
[51:35] know the fruits of repentance
[51:37] right because that's what John the
[51:39] Baptist said they could have fruits of
[51:40] sanctification but they won't have the
[51:42] baptism of the Holy Ghost fruits
[51:44] those are special fruits those are the
[51:46] most mature that's much fruit amen
[51:48] that's the much fruit Jesus spoke about
[51:51] much fruit
[51:53] so see we want that we want a life that
[51:55] is very fruitful
[51:57] we learn
[51:59] we come to Christ we learn and then
[52:01] people can see the fruits in our lives
[52:04] right the easy one to see is with long
[52:05] patience long I'm sorry long-suffering
[52:09] right we
[52:11] if we are long-suffering then we can
[52:13] suffer with somebody a long time when
[52:16] they're wrong
[52:18] yeah we I I left you
[52:22] in other words someone's wrong and they
[52:24] mistreated you but you can still love
[52:26] them a long time you can suffer with
[52:29] their ignorance or their Disobedience a
[52:31] long time
[52:33] without trying to write them out of the
[52:34] Kingdom
[52:35] especially your brothers and sisters in
[52:37] Christ
[52:38] that's the real love right because your
[52:40] natural family you might you know you
[52:41] might see your might not see your family
[52:44] you might have a disagreement you might
[52:46] not see them maybe once a month but
[52:47] you're going to see your church family
[52:49] three times a week
[52:51] right church is that right
[52:54] we really need to be long-suffering with
[52:57] one another
[52:58] that's why the last anointing you get
[53:01] before the Holy Ghost is broadly
[53:02] kindness God wants you to be kind to
[53:04] your family before you come into that
[53:06] before your baptized into the family he
[53:09] wants you to learn to love your brothers
[53:11] and sisters in Christ
[53:13] all right
[53:14] getting a little tired here so that's
[53:15] understandable so let me try to finish
[53:17] this up here now here's what I would try
[53:20] to say to you know message people that
[53:21] would say well learning is a bad word
[53:23] well that's there's two kinds of
[53:24] learning
[53:25] right here's the kind we don't want
[53:28] having a form of godliness but denying
[53:30] the power thereof from such certain way
[53:31] for of this sore are they which creep
[53:33] into houses and Lead captive silly women
[53:35] on Laden with sins LED away with diverse
[53:38] locks ever learning and never able to
[53:40] come to the knowledge of the truth
[53:43] this is the this is the learning that
[53:44] brother Branham is blasting
[53:46] they're church members but they're
[53:48] learning how to sin
[53:52] they're learning to sin and this applies
[53:54] even to message churches that allow
[53:56] polygamy
[53:57] or allow movies into their church right
[54:00] yeah
[54:01] or any any sin any sin they allow
[54:04] they're ever learning but they're
[54:06] learning the wrong things see the sins
[54:08] get into their homes I'm just speaking
[54:10] in general and it teaches people to sin
[54:12] rather than take up the cross praise God
[54:15] Hallelujah
[54:17] they're never never able to come to the
[54:19] knowledge the revelation of the truth
[54:21] the learning of the truth they don't
[54:23] learn
[54:24] to obey the truth
[54:27] that's why people want to call me a
[54:28] strict Pastor I'll say Amen every time
[54:30] because I am not I'm here to teach you
[54:33] to learn Jesus Christ
[54:35] not not learning to sin
[54:39] let's learn Jesus Christ
[54:41] Hallelujah so I like that reputation
[54:43] I'll keep that one
[54:46] finally my brethren whatsoever things
[54:48] are true whatsoever things are honest
[54:49] whatever things are just whatever things
[54:51] are pure whatever things are lovely
[54:53] whatever things are good report if there
[54:55] be any virtue any praise think on these
[54:57] things eight things
[54:59] hates eternity
[55:01] those things which you have both learned
[55:03] and received and heard and seen in me do
[55:06] and the God of Peace shall be with you
[55:09] living on this is very similar to the
[55:11] scripture Brothers said about resting
[55:13] how many want a peaceful life
[55:15] well what's a peaceful life you're
[55:17] resting in Christ I mean it's very it's
[55:18] basically the same thing the anointing
[55:20] of the Holy Spirit giving you peace with
[55:22] God
[55:24] how do you get that bro Jess
[55:26] how do we how do I do that think on the
[55:28] right things
[55:30] that's what the Bible says think on all
[55:32] these eight it gives us eight options
[55:34] that's a lot of options
[55:35] a lot of options but Salvation you only
[55:38] got two life or death yeah but with with
[55:40] your thought life here's here's a option
[55:42] here's eight Avenues think on one of
[55:44] these things
[55:48] see so Paul says
[55:50] the things that you've learned received
[55:53] and heard and seen in my life do
[55:56] God will be with you
[55:58] so this is the kind of learning we want
[56:00] that's why we want to listen to brother
[56:01] random stories right we can learn from
[56:03] those stories
[56:05] right that's the kind of learning they
[56:07] want to do they looked at Paul and they
[56:09] learned from Paul I imagine brother
[56:10] Derek he'd be out there making tents I
[56:11] wonder what they can learn from his tent
[56:13] making
[56:13] wow he's such he pays attention in
[56:15] detail just like God pays attention to
[56:17] every detail in my life
[56:20] wow Paul makes a pretty good tent there
[56:22] Paul really cares about that tent oh
[56:25] yeah that's right Paul cares about the
[56:26] tense of the Believers we're the
[56:28] Tabernacles of God we're the tents of
[56:30] God
[56:32] Paul works a lot of long hours boy it
[56:35] takes a lot of I got to spend a lot of
[56:36] time with the Lord in order to be built
[56:38] up as a real Tabernacle of God
[56:41] I mean there's things we can learn right
[56:42] we can learn from the natural
[56:45] just from watching just from watching a
[56:47] man of God you can learn and then the
[56:50] peace of God is with you
[56:52] Hallelujah
[56:54] here's another one very similar all that
[56:56] live Godly in Christ Jesus will suffer
[56:58] persecution because you got to learn
[56:59] right you suck Jesus had to learn things
[57:02] that he suffered
[57:03] right but evil men and seducers who acts
[57:06] worse and worse deceiving and being
[57:07] deceived
[57:09] so look at the deception today
[57:11] the deception is greater today than it
[57:13] was back then
[57:15] because Paul said it's thus saith the
[57:17] Lord the deception is greater today
[57:21] that's right
[57:23] but continue thou in the things which
[57:25] thou Hast learned
[57:27] and been assured of
[57:30] what things are we assured of today I'm
[57:32] sure they're going to find them right in
[57:33] here I'm assured we're going to find
[57:35] them right in here what things are we
[57:36] assured of I'm sure we're gonna find
[57:38] them right in here
[57:40] the things we know are the truth
[57:44] knowing of whom thou Hast learned them
[57:48] oh so God sent us a God sent man
[57:51] and then we learn from him and we're
[57:53] assured of them because they are thus
[57:54] saith the Lord
[57:56] Hallelujah
[57:58] that from a child that's known the holy
[58:00] scriptures which are able to make thee
[58:02] wise unto salvation through faith which
[58:04] is in Christ Jesus
[58:06] so here this is spiritual or Godly
[58:08] learning this isn't the vain learning
[58:10] like ever learning and never able to
[58:12] come to the knowledge of the truth we're
[58:14] not vain Learners we're spiritual
[58:15] learners
[58:17] Hallelujah
[58:18] and then we can learn from other holy
[58:20] ghost-filled Saints
[58:22] praise God
[58:26] II Peter 3 17 ye therefore beloved
[58:29] seeing you know these things before
[58:31] beware lest ye also being led away with
[58:34] the heir of the wicked fall from your
[58:36] own steadfastness
[58:38] that's why the first thing we look at
[58:40] when we were concerned about people they
[58:42] stopped coming to church they're step
[58:43] where's their steadfastness
[58:46] or they start uh gossiping or they start
[58:48] saying evil things about one another
[58:50] they're falling from their steadfastness
[58:53] right we're supposed to like like
[58:54] brothers said about brother Neville he
[58:55] said one thing I love about brother
[58:56] Neville he's the same brother Neville
[58:58] every day of the week
[59:00] right he's just the same we just sang
[59:03] that song right
[59:04] uh uh about being the same it's always
[59:07] the same right praising God I want to
[59:09] praise God every day and every day be
[59:11] the same let me be a real solid
[59:13] Christian praise God
[59:15] you have a test you have a consistent
[59:16] testimony
[59:18] Hallelujah
[59:20] but grow Saints grow in Grace and in the
[59:24] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[59:26] Christ
[59:27] to be glory both now and forever see
[59:29] it's a Bible command that we must be
[59:30] learners
[59:31] it's a Bible command that we must grow
[59:34] in our understanding in our learning
[59:42] now there's the you know the take Church
[59:44] movement says we don't have to they say
[59:45] we don't have to discern anything on
[59:47] tape they just sit back and say Amen to
[59:48] every word that's being a lazy learner
[59:52] all right that's that's less learning to
[59:55] not discern
[59:56] that's learning to uh neglect your gift
[59:59] of judging the word of God
[1:00:01] right it also disobeys the Bible command
[1:00:04] to prove all things
[1:00:06] try every Spirit search the scriptures
[1:00:08] to prove what is taught is scriptural
[1:00:13] see so saying Amen to everywhere on tape
[1:00:15] that's not spiritual learning that's not
[1:00:17] understanding
[1:00:19] right because I can show you where
[1:00:20] brother Adam said uh Rebecca one day is
[1:00:23] going to take my place well what does
[1:00:25] that mean
[1:00:27] he passed away
[1:00:28] who's placing anything
[1:00:30] right praying for the sick or seeing
[1:00:31] visions
[1:00:32] brother Jose reached out and asked the
[1:00:33] family about that and they said no she
[1:00:35] never took brother's place in any way
[1:00:38] right
[1:00:39] so many examples
[1:00:40] I have a I have a document with almost
[1:00:42] 90. I have over eight examples
[1:00:44] of just human things brother Ram said
[1:00:47] see God wants us to learn God wants us
[1:00:49] to ask questions how we can say Amen to
[1:00:51] that
[1:00:52] God wants us to grow the only way we
[1:00:54] grow as many times is ask questions
[1:00:59] I'm not going to go through those
[1:01:01] examples tonight because I'm already I
[1:01:02] want to stop around eight o'clock I'm
[1:01:03] already 805 here but remember they're
[1:01:06] just like there's two kinds of learning
[1:01:07] there's two kinds of faith
[1:01:10] brother Ram said Paul down there in the
[1:01:12] natural realm with his PhD
[1:01:14] he had an intellectual Faith but he
[1:01:16] didn't have a Divine Faith there's quite
[1:01:17] a difference in me having an
[1:01:18] intellectual faith and divine faith
[1:01:22] okay and a good example this is James 2
[1:01:24] 19. the Bible said the devil believes in
[1:01:27] God but trembles
[1:01:29] well that's just the intellectual faith
[1:01:32] that's an intellectual belief but the
[1:01:34] devil won't obey the word of God
[1:01:36] the devil won't repent
[1:01:38] so that's intellectual faith right now
[1:01:41] the same thing we can't get stuck in
[1:01:42] that we've got to repent when we're
[1:01:44] wrong praise God
[1:01:46] we're going to repent of bad bad
[1:01:47] attitudes
[1:01:48] right we got to repent of being ill to
[1:01:51] somebody
[1:01:52] we've got to repent of saying the wrong
[1:01:54] words
[1:01:55] harboring evil spirits right we got to
[1:01:58] repent on those things right that's what
[1:02:00] the Bible's we gotta have real Faith
[1:02:01] praise God
[1:02:03] not intellectual faith
[1:02:07] I'm not going to read
[1:02:08] all that there there's at least 18 times
[1:02:10] brother Adam says this there's two kinds
[1:02:12] of Faith there's human faith and there's
[1:02:14] Divine Faith same thing with learning
[1:02:15] there's human learning but then there's
[1:02:17] Divine learning
[1:02:23] so believing brother Branham he says was
[1:02:26] learning from Jesus
[1:02:28] that's what brother Adam says no no John
[1:02:30] Ryan was the man who received his sight
[1:02:31] he was blind received his sight still
[1:02:33] preaching Divine Healing tonight so the
[1:02:35] the man was blind he got his sight and
[1:02:37] then he started preaching
[1:02:39] and in that meeting down there he'd been
[1:02:40] healed and how God was pouring out his
[1:02:42] blessings I remember my wife come down
[1:02:44] to see me and there was about four city
[1:02:46] blocks of people ready for the Revival
[1:02:48] they were standing and my wife said you
[1:02:50] don't mean all those people come to hear
[1:02:51] you preach I said no they come to learn
[1:02:53] of Jesus
[1:02:56] brother brother Brown was going to be
[1:02:58] preaching
[1:02:59] but he said it's not me teaching the
[1:03:02] people it's Jesus teaching the people
[1:03:07] Hallelujah
[1:03:09] so see there's a good one for the tapes
[1:03:11] when I listen to brother Brown I'm not
[1:03:12] listening brother Bram I'm listening to
[1:03:14] Jesus the word of God hallelujah
[1:03:16] amen
[1:03:19] brother Ram says we must learn two doc
[1:03:21] true Doctrine from God's spirit we must
[1:03:23] learn it from the Holy Spirit now watch
[1:03:26] he says but you'll never win the opinion
[1:03:28] of the organization one person no sir
[1:03:30] when they got their rule set we believe
[1:03:33] this period if you'd write up their
[1:03:35] Doctrine we we believe this comma it'd
[1:03:37] be different
[1:03:38] so here's the idea we must learn more
[1:03:40] about God
[1:03:42] right we can't say we understand
[1:03:43] everything and know everything about the
[1:03:45] word of God
[1:03:46] he says if you write that up your
[1:03:48] Doctrine we believe this comma it'd be
[1:03:50] different appear it means we believe
[1:03:51] that and you've got to come to this and
[1:03:53] sign this paper or that's all of it but
[1:03:56] if you say we believe this comma plus as
[1:03:59] much as we can learn from God we're open
[1:04:01] to the Holy Spirit now you're going on
[1:04:04] brother he said that's going to be
[1:04:06] different now Hallelujah and church
[1:04:08] that's all the awesome thing is you can
[1:04:09] say that tonight praise God
[1:04:11] if you've grown away from seeking God
[1:04:13] this week you can start tonight and you
[1:04:15] can start tomorrow morning learning more
[1:04:17] about God hallelujah you can change it
[1:04:19] you have the choice you have the power
[1:04:21] to change it praise God I have the
[1:04:23] choice we all have that choice to be
[1:04:25] Learners of Christ
[1:04:28] oh it's beautiful
[1:04:31] see we should always have a comma well
[1:04:32] yeah I know about not eternal hell I
[1:04:34] know about Serpentine I know about water
[1:04:35] baptism brother Jesse I know about the
[1:04:37] book of Romans but put a comma say but
[1:04:39] God can show me more
[1:04:41] haha
[1:04:42] Glory Hallelujah
[1:04:44] glad to be with a bunch of disciples
[1:04:46] here tonight by God's grace
[1:04:48] you want to learn more about Jesus
[1:04:51] and brother random even prayed to learn
[1:04:53] from God
[1:04:54] see learning is not a bad word learning
[1:04:56] is a good word
[1:04:57] when it's the Divine learning
[1:05:00] brother man takes his text on be certain
[1:05:02] of God he said and now Lord bless Thy
[1:05:04] word as it goes forth and may the Holy
[1:05:06] Spirit capture our minds that's what I
[1:05:07] hope happened tonight I hope somehow the
[1:05:09] Holy Spirit was able to get our minds
[1:05:10] away from everything going on out there
[1:05:13] was he able to do it tonight
[1:05:17] and prepare us for his visitation
[1:05:20] as we have asked him to come
[1:05:22] for we do not come to the house Lord to
[1:05:24] be seen or to see but to learn of Thee
[1:05:29] and to know of thy nature where's nature
[1:05:32] and thy way and thy causes that we might
[1:05:35] be able to face the problems of life
[1:05:38] with a real Assurance being surgeon of
[1:05:40] God Amen
[1:05:43] God help me to learn tonight that I can
[1:05:46] trust you in every problem praise God
[1:05:49] in every problem in every circumstance
[1:05:51] of my life teach me that I can be
[1:05:52] certain that you're with me praise God
[1:05:54] teach me that tonight I'm going to learn
[1:05:56] that tonight
[1:06:00] that's a beautiful prayer
[1:06:02] now I know you like this one program
[1:06:04] learned about cat I've learned about God
[1:06:06] just by looking at cattle
[1:06:10] right
[1:06:11] he says I'm a Hunter as you all know my
[1:06:13] mother's half Indian I'm and my
[1:06:14] conversion never taken that out of me I
[1:06:17] still go up to Colorado where I'm a
[1:06:18] licensed guy to every phone go away hype
[1:06:20] in the mountains where I used to herd
[1:06:22] cattle for years and sat there many
[1:06:23] times learned so much about God not even
[1:06:26] in the church
[1:06:27] not even in the church
[1:06:31] and so he tells the story of the blood
[1:06:33] tag right you remember that story but
[1:06:35] you know that Ranger never noticed the
[1:06:36] brands now sometimes you use brands for
[1:06:38] a good thing like it's a brand is like a
[1:06:40] seal the Holy Ghost well in this case he
[1:06:41] doesn't use the brand he used the ear
[1:06:43] tag
[1:06:44] he watched for the blood tag in your ear
[1:06:47] you couldn't put a here a Hereford on
[1:06:50] that forest or cow on that Forest
[1:06:52] without being a thoroughbred Hereford
[1:06:54] it had to be a registered Hereford and I
[1:06:57] think of the day of judgment God will
[1:06:59] not notice whether I belong to the
[1:07:01] assemblies or the Church of God or what
[1:07:02] church I belong to the brand that I wear
[1:07:05] he'll look for the blood tag the blood
[1:07:07] of his own son that's what he'll look
[1:07:09] for praise God Amen he can learn church
[1:07:13] we can learn out there in nature can't
[1:07:15] we
[1:07:16] we can learn right out there you can
[1:07:18] learn so much
[1:07:20] like we learned with our chickens right
[1:07:22] we learn from other people you better
[1:07:23] put a fence around them or else the
[1:07:25] enemies are going to get them
[1:07:27] then you better dig under the ground and
[1:07:29] put that chicken wire under the ground
[1:07:30] because they can dig under the fence
[1:07:33] what does that teach us the word of God
[1:07:34] fortifies us well the man said God
[1:07:37] fortified you with the best thing he
[1:07:39] could give you that's the word of God
[1:07:41] hallelujah he put a hedge he put a fence
[1:07:44] all the way around you so you're safe
[1:07:46] and secure praise God you might hear all
[1:07:49] those wolves you might hear the coyote
[1:07:50] and the raccoons but you're safe in
[1:07:52] there you can be happy inside your
[1:07:54] chicken run well your Eagle Run can I
[1:07:56] say like that Hallelujah your lamb run
[1:07:59] let me call like that you can be safe
[1:08:01] inside your land run God's protecting
[1:08:03] you he gave you the best defense plus he
[1:08:05] gave you a sword of Despair praise God
[1:08:09] oh man you can learn so much search just
[1:08:11] out in nature you can learn of God
[1:08:16] now I'm going to skip past this for
[1:08:17] time's sake here
[1:08:18] yeah I'm close right here so church what
[1:08:20] do you and I need to learn of Jesus
[1:08:22] tonight
[1:08:24] I preach this whole sermon on learning
[1:08:26] was it inspired of God I felt I was
[1:08:28] inspired to preach it
[1:08:30] was my study in vain or was it going to
[1:08:32] be help to somebody tonight
[1:08:34] it's yet to be seen but I hope it's
[1:08:36] going to be a healthy people in other
[1:08:38] words what are we going to take from
[1:08:39] this what are we going to learn from
[1:08:40] this what habit are we going to apply to
[1:08:42] our lives from this
[1:08:46] hopefully the best one would be to come
[1:08:48] to Christ
[1:08:49] take up your yoke right get yoked with
[1:08:51] Christ get partnered with Christ and if
[1:08:53] you do that you'll take up your cross
[1:08:55] and you'll follow where the Lord is
[1:08:57] leading you and your
[1:09:00] in your life what do you need to learn
[1:09:01] I'm going to skip past that for time's
[1:09:03] sake because I've already preached over
[1:09:04] an hour
[1:09:05] what can we learn tonight well we can
[1:09:07] learn to forgive if we can't if we're
[1:09:08] having trouble forgiving somebody right
[1:09:10] I'm not going to put a list of 100
[1:09:11] things up here
[1:09:13] we could learn to repent
[1:09:15] right if we still haven't repented of
[1:09:17] something
[1:09:18] we can learn to overcome
[1:09:20] well Ram said it doesn't even matter in
[1:09:22] the church age book it doesn't matter
[1:09:23] what you have to overcome as long as you
[1:09:25] know how to overcome
[1:09:26] and we already went through that you can
[1:09:28] expose the devil you confess and say God
[1:09:30] empty me out of that sin and fill me
[1:09:32] with your spirit
[1:09:34] renew my mind transform my mind praise
[1:09:36] God
[1:09:38] we can learn to wait and have patience
[1:09:43] we can learn to be diligent we can learn
[1:09:45] to put these this knowledge that we have
[1:09:47] into practice
[1:09:50] we can learn to care for others and look
[1:09:52] to the needs of other people
[1:09:56] we can learn to operate the gifts God
[1:09:58] has placed in our lives those are all
[1:10:00] things we want to learn
[1:10:02] so the question is who will come to
[1:10:04] Jesus tonight
[1:10:06] and who will yoke themselves to him
[1:10:08] to learn of him let's stand to our feet
[1:10:10] and musicians can come
[1:10:18] play that song O Come To The Altar and
[1:10:21] I'm not opening up this I mean hardly
[1:10:22] anybody comes this altar anyway you know
[1:10:24] a small church it's a small altar you
[1:10:26] know it's not even a big altar it's not
[1:10:29] even all the way across the front
[1:10:31] but like brother Ram says let's go to
[1:10:33] the altar of our hearts
[1:10:35] praise God
[1:10:37] what we learn of Christ
[1:10:40] were any of those areas important for
[1:10:42] you
