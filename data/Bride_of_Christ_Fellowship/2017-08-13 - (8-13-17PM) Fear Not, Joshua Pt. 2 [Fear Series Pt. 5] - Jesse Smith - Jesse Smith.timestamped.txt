[17:21] arching daddy loves you raised alone
[17:23] let's take our Bibles tonight by God's
[17:25] grace he meant so thankful for God's
[17:28] love life - book of Joshua I think I'll
[17:40] just continue on this very good I've
[17:42] never seen that I want to get out
[17:44] gracious Lord
[17:45] let's go to if we can joshua 8:1 that's
[17:51] going to reach Josh but we'll reach a
[18:06] little more on the background of this
[18:07] but if you remember I Chapter seven
[18:11] Joshua had just dealt with the sin of
[18:13] akin basically put him out of the church
[18:18] like the Bible says and God had judge
[18:21] akin as you remember and so now they're
[18:25] going to they'd already lost to a I
[18:26] write because they can sit and now God
[18:30] is encouraging Joshua Joshua got a
[18:32] little scared after that first defeat
[18:34] got a little scared like we're talking
[18:37] about the spirit of fear but in Joshua
[18:39] he won the Lord encourages him again
[18:42] this is the second time God tells him
[18:44] don't fear Joshua need one let's read
[18:47] that together one two three
[18:49] and the Lord said unto joshua fear not
[18:52] neither eat out the same take all the
[18:55] people for with thee and arise and go up
[18:58] to a i see i got given into the
[19:01] and the king of AI and his beautiful had
[19:04] a city that's fair never need on your
[19:09] hearts make an alert to God here only
[19:12] father you see the hands Lord you see
[19:13] the needs of the people thank you for
[19:15] this opportunity to again be in your
[19:17] house the Lord I see as my personal
[19:20] revelation Lord that Lord you said
[19:23] gather mowers you see that day
[19:25] approaches Lord God that's where I see
[19:27] Sunday night services Lord it's an
[19:29] opportunity for us to gather more lord I
[19:32] just pray you to take this time bless it
[19:34] Lord for that Kingdom Lord we see that
[19:38] Day approaching on where we see it
[19:40] approaching steadily we see the US and
[19:43] Israel and everything that's going on
[19:45] distress of nations men's hearts failing
[19:48] them for fear but yet we see the Word of
[19:50] God and Lord we're looking at the
[19:52] promise today we're not looking at the
[19:54] inhabitants of the land we're looking at
[19:57] the promise of God
[19:58] so Lord strengthen us here tonight North
[20:00] I know you will father our faith is in
[20:03] you our trust is in you encourage us in
[20:05] thy word Lord and help us to be just
[20:08] like Joshua you said if you're not
[20:09] Joshua don't be dismayed take courage
[20:12] where we take courage tonight speak just
[20:15] through thy word help me to heal myself
[20:16] to you in Jesus Christ's name all reset
[20:18] a mess you didn't seem crazy we'll try
[20:26] to be just about our okay so we got our
[20:33] scripture there so I'm just gonna call
[20:35] this fear not Joshua party to the Lord I
[20:44] want to just give a quick overview of
[20:46] the book of Joshua so we can kind of
[20:49] understand the setting a little bit and
[20:52] then we'll look at those three times
[20:55] Scott go Joshua to not be afraid and
[20:58] look at the context of each one so we
[21:01] opened the Joshua here by the grace of
[21:04] the Lord and Joshua chapter 1 we read a
[21:10] little bit about that but Joshua was
[21:11] commissioned in Chapter 1 we know Josh
[21:15] she was a new Moses right he said as I
[21:18] was with Moses so I'll be with you so
[21:20] God was raising up another Moses a man
[21:23] like in the very ministry of Moses he
[21:25] said as I was with Moses I'm gonna be
[21:27] with you the same anointing was with
[21:30] Moses I'm gonna be with you as well amen
[21:32] and no man said this about Joshua and as
[21:38] Moses he said now Joshua and all his
[21:41] knowing that the command was great his
[21:45] command was great remember to take all
[21:46] these seven nations who spread his rough
[21:49] but having the assurance he could be
[21:52] fearless so when God told him I'm with
[21:54] you be strong very courageous the
[21:58] Prophet said Joshua could be fearless
[22:00] Amen so we can be fearless tonight too
[22:02] he could be and this is program saying
[22:05] and we call it reckless as long as he
[22:08] was pointed the right way he might break
[22:11] up against the hill that would not get
[22:13] backwards when he was headed the right
[22:15] way
[22:16] look at that reckless in other words he
[22:18] could be fully persuaded he was going in
[22:21] the right direction do you feel that way
[22:22] that's the kind of Liberty we want in
[22:24] our lives well I know I'm going the
[22:25] right direction I know God called me to
[22:27] be a pastor I don't God taught me to be
[22:28] a father all these things I just want to
[22:31] feel reckless like I've got the Word of
[22:32] God I'm doing exactly what God called me
[22:35] to do he was reckless because God had
[22:37] told him I'm with you and told exactly
[22:40] what to do he says it again he said now
[22:45] so in the church let me god be reckless
[22:48] and fearless aren't you glad you could
[22:50] be fearless Church in faith if we're
[22:53] pointed the right way for he said as I
[22:55] was with Moses I'll be with you I'll not
[22:57] fail you nor forsake you he never
[22:59] forsaken Moses he never failed Moses he
[23:03] will not fail Joshua he will not fail us
[23:05] you'll be with us amen and as we find
[23:09] Joshua mission knowing the
[23:12] responsibilities was leading them
[23:14] through lands now and that he'd have to
[23:17] go over into the other land
[23:19] he'd have to set up the kingdom he'd
[23:21] have to divide inheritance among them
[23:23] now here's the point I mentioned on
[23:24] Wednesday look
[23:25] tremendous quote he know the Commission
[23:28] was tremendous far more than what Moses
[23:32] had done did you ever know that
[23:34] Joshua's commission was greater than
[23:36] even Moses's Commission momenta Joshua
[23:40] had more to do that Moses had to do my
[23:44] stress that is a striking God Moses did
[23:48] the plagues right
[23:49] Moses did the Passover he brought them
[23:52] out of Egypt brought them through the
[23:55] Red Sea which remember brother Graham
[23:56] said the Red Sea was the red blood of
[23:58] Jesus Christ for us that's why it's
[24:00] called the Red Sea I'm gonna BAM said
[24:02] all of our sins and taxmasters
[24:04] we're drowning the blood of Jesus Christ
[24:06] amen so there's Calvary in this picture
[24:09] we know the promised land we were
[24:10] looking at the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost
[24:12] the Holy Ghost
[24:13] but there's Calvary that read see that
[24:15] blood Red Sea hey man ha there you go
[24:17] thank God for that but he was he was
[24:22] taking them out of Egypt to the promised
[24:24] land but bromantic said Joshua's
[24:26] Commission was greater he said that he
[24:28] had more to do yet to take them in drive
[24:31] out the inhabitants and then place them
[24:33] positionally amen so that's quite a
[24:36] statement there I want to make sure I
[24:38] read that here by the grace of God does
[24:40] that deals with chapter 1 he could be
[24:42] fearless and you and I could be fearless
[24:44] you can be fearless on a Sunday night
[24:45] praise the Lord you can be fearless here
[24:47] tonight there's nothing to fear there's
[24:49] nothing to be afraid of God is with us
[24:51] we're pointing the right direction we're
[24:53] pointing right where the word tells us
[24:54] to good day then we got to have that
[24:56] same fate praise God
[24:58] now chapter 2 as the chapter of Rahab
[25:00] and the spies were very familiar with
[25:02] that of course a habit you know her
[25:04] history she married a a general of the
[25:08] Israelite army and then brought forth
[25:11] Obed and bo hats right and Boaz
[25:15] brought forth I think it was him through
[25:18] Oh bad I got a mixed up but out of all
[25:21] as soon as she came Jesse Jesse come
[25:23] David praise God a David come Solomon
[25:26] and you take it all the way down and
[25:27] here comes the Lord Jesus Christ out of
[25:30] the genealogy of Rahab the harlot and
[25:32] Romansh dramatized and he said this
[25:35] might not be scriptural but he said
[25:37] let's say that
[25:38] as parents were paralyzed or sick and
[25:40] she had to sell her body in order to
[25:43] provide for her family knew was wrong
[25:44] the whole time to sell out her morals
[25:46] and God looked at that condition and had
[25:49] mercy upon her but even in the midst of
[25:52] that God knew Rahab was a real believer
[25:54] so God sent the spies to Rahab praise
[25:57] the Lord God numbered the footsteps of
[26:00] the righteous are ordered to the Lord
[26:01] God knew which house they had to be at
[26:04] peace amen
[26:04] I knew which house those two spies had
[26:07] to go and praise the Lord and members
[26:10] she would live which was striking to she
[26:12] lied he said I don't know where they are
[26:13] they went northward and they were up
[26:15] their honor on your road right hiding
[26:17] under the flax of the plants I forgot
[26:19] what it was exactly hiding under there
[26:21] she even lied and somehow Oh God must
[26:23] have forgave that but that's chapter 2
[26:26] and member the Scarlet thread and and
[26:30] brother Ralph said that's what we must
[26:32] do as well all those who can be saved we
[26:35] must get them in the house everyone who
[26:37] is in Rahab's house would be saved in
[26:39] the prophecy we must do the same thing
[26:41] we must get them under the token amen
[26:43] I'm gonna leave you oh you're still
[26:45] praying for your loved ones I'm gonna
[26:46] leave and support to pray for them God
[26:48] bring them into the house God bring them
[26:49] in the house bring them under the red
[26:51] token the red Corps so that they might
[26:53] be saved I don't want to see my family
[26:55] destroyed with the the heathens of this
[26:57] world that's right
[26:59] chapter three they pass over into Jordan
[27:02] and brother Branham said to see they put
[27:04] the word first God told Joshua sanctify
[27:07] yourselves people to sanctify themselves
[27:08] let the art go out first the people I
[27:12] love the ark let the word go first he
[27:14] said don't get ahead of the Ark but
[27:16] follow the ark how many follow the art
[27:19] today we can't get ahead of the word we
[27:22] can't try to interpret the word
[27:23] ourselves we got to stay behind the word
[27:25] and stay in our position amen no not the
[27:28] word interpret stuff let the word go out
[27:29] before you believe the word but let the
[27:31] word go don't try to get ahead of the
[27:33] word and break things the pass he said
[27:35] that's how you cross over into the
[27:37] promised land and chapter four they give
[27:41] the two memorials I forgot one I think I
[27:44] forgot what I want to go over just a
[27:49] moment here
[27:50] I missed the I missed the capture the
[28:01] Lord host what chapter is a didn't I
[28:02] miss dead I'm sorry
[28:03] anybody see that that's one thing I
[28:07] forgot to look up I got a good quote on
[28:09] that oh they're just yeah chapter five
[28:13] all right yeah so there it is brings a
[28:15] little sorry about that reading chapter
[28:17] four they dug two memorials they've done
[28:19] a stack of stones outside of the waters
[28:22] and then they build a stack of stones
[28:24] right in the middle of the waters and
[28:25] you remember what that was for that was
[28:28] for the children of Israel when they
[28:30] would grow up and they say daddy why are
[28:32] all those 12 huge stones in the midst of
[28:34] Jordan and God told them to answer this
[28:38] is because the Lord brought us through
[28:40] the river Jordan it was set up as from
[28:42] memorial that the children would know
[28:44] the power of God amen
[28:46] they and we must keep the memorials
[28:49] going that's what I like to hear the
[28:50] testimonies like brother Jose's last
[28:51] week you need we keep needing to testify
[28:53] to though we'll tell what God has done
[28:56] never forget what God has done God
[28:58] literally command them set up the
[29:00] memorials don't forget what I've done
[29:02] tell everybody about what I've done that
[29:04] should be not discouraged as you
[29:06] remember that I'm the same yesterday
[29:07] today and forever amen
[29:09] chapter 5 is the new generation gets
[29:12] circumcised so as soon as they cross
[29:14] over the Jordan River soon as they die
[29:16] to themselves and get the baptism all
[29:18] the ghosts they get circumcised and we
[29:20] know that's cutting off the excess flesh
[29:22] cutting off all the desires of the flesh
[29:24] crucify the flesh we'd say right the new
[29:27] generation and the Bible said that was
[29:29] the reproach of Egypt right living a
[29:33] fleshly life living in the world living
[29:34] in the things of the world being
[29:36] circumcised was getting the reproach of
[29:38] your past life cut off from you grace
[29:41] not in men so glad he does that evening
[29:43] and then at the end of chapter 5
[29:47] Joshua meets the captive the host and I
[29:50] think it's wonderful in verse 13 Joshua
[29:53] says are now with us or for our
[29:55] adversaries did you notice his response
[29:58] do you notice what the angel the Lord
[30:00] said things old the Lord doesn't say
[30:03] yeah I'm with you
[30:04] he says nay he says nay but as Captain
[30:10] to the host of Lord am I now coming
[30:12] what does that show us Church it shows
[30:15] that that God's not doing this for our
[30:17] glory God's doing this for his glory
[30:20] praise the Lord he tells Joshua no I'm
[30:23] not for you or them
[30:24] I forgot hey then and you gotta follow
[30:27] me crazy moment and you gotta follow the
[30:30] true captain of this army which we know
[30:33] is the angel the Lord praise God amen I
[30:35] think that's so striking there see there
[30:37] that's not like God loves us so much but
[30:39] Adam we're not so much better than
[30:41] anybody else that he'll he's for us
[30:43] because we're better he's for his word
[30:45] amen and he doesn't risk use now the
[30:47] respecter of persons he doesn't love our
[30:49] church more than any other Church he's
[30:51] for his own will in his way and we've
[30:54] got to follow his villain way we're not
[30:57] better than anybody else he said no
[30:58] Joshua I'm not on your side I'm on God's
[31:01] side I forgot I'm God's Cathy you must
[31:04] follow me I think that's important notes
[31:06] you church
[31:07] I think that's important but as for the
[31:09] same thing he said Joshua draw a sword
[31:11] and sell you with us or for them he said
[31:12] in faith 1953 he said nay but I'm the
[31:16] captain of the hosts of the Lord he said
[31:18] yes sir hey out of them again he wasn't
[31:21] free he was a picking size he wasn't
[31:23] doing favours he was for the plan of God
[31:25] amen
[31:26] we're thankful for that praise the Lord
[31:28] so that was chapter 5 I want to make
[31:31] sure I get to that in chapter 5 chapter
[31:33] 6 these are the battles with the
[31:35] Canaanites the first battle chapter 6
[31:37] was the conquest of Jericho
[31:39] you remember that of course they walked
[31:42] around seven times each day
[31:45] I'm sorry six times and on the seventh
[31:47] day they walked around seven times right
[31:49] and they had to hold in the silence that
[31:50] very it's a very passive victory we'd
[31:53] say not didn't give them that much to do
[31:56] there wasn't much fighting
[31:58] all's that had to do is silently keep
[31:59] walking with the Word of God this was
[32:01] going to be a victory where they didn't
[32:02] have much to do I noticed God gives
[32:04] different types of victories that he
[32:06] kept did you catch that in Josh but some
[32:08] victories you just sit and praise God
[32:10] and you're just quiet all the time and
[32:11] other victories you're out there
[32:13] fighting with the sword
[32:14] grace you're out there on the frontlines
[32:17] fighting with the sword
[32:18] witness to that there's times God has
[32:20] done the whole thing and all you've done
[32:22] is sat back and watch them do it
[32:23] praise God you just step back and praise
[32:26] to them give Him glory another different
[32:27] situation with the church and other
[32:29] things where I felt like I didn't have
[32:31] to do anything I just sat back and gave
[32:32] it time and God did all of it amen
[32:35] like problems and situations and God
[32:38] worked it all up but there's other times
[32:40] I had to get right there on the front
[32:41] lines of Matt a little bit deal with
[32:44] people individually Greek scriptures and
[32:46] try to bring correction and things like
[32:47] that
[32:48] Omar talk to be going up you say don't
[32:51] come to church or you know things like
[32:52] that you're not welcome until you
[32:53] repented this or that there's time you
[32:55] had to get it right there and fight at
[32:57] the very front of the battle and other
[32:58] times the victory so passive so what do
[33:01] we need the leadership of the Holy
[33:02] Spirit man they did and Josh was
[33:05] learning this he's learning not to fear
[33:07] trust God every battle might be
[33:10] different so he must follow the will of
[33:12] God for each battle and that's what this
[33:14] teaches us in chapter 6 the conquest of
[33:17] Jericho is a very silent victory if Mary
[33:19] wasn't there wasn't a lot going on it
[33:21] was just walking in praise right just
[33:23] walking with the glory of God ain't it
[33:25] now chapter seven is a sin of Aitkin 36
[33:30] men die in verse 5 36 minute and Joshua
[33:36] about loses the church what did you you
[33:39] just told the walls fall down with your
[33:40] first battle the next battle 36 men died
[33:43] and you're running away but you know God
[33:46] told you no man will stand before you
[33:47] all the days of your life and so what do
[33:50] they do they would repent into sackcloth
[33:51] and ashes and look what look what look
[33:56] what Joshua said in verse 7 look at
[33:58] verse 7
[33:59] Joshua has the same kind of can I say it
[34:03] like this doubt he has the same type of
[34:05] complaint that they had in the
[34:07] wilderness watch for seven look versa
[34:09] see when fear gets upon us we start
[34:11] complaining like like they did the
[34:13] winners like when we were in
[34:14] centrifugation right sometimes serves
[34:17] things come out of our mouths that were
[34:18] so kind of surprised to hear our own
[34:20] self say right we revert back to what we
[34:22] used to say
[34:23] look at verse 7 this is powerful and
[34:25] Joshua said alas o Lord God
[34:27] wherefore hast thou at all brought those
[34:29] people over
[34:30] order to deliver us in the hand the
[34:31] amorite and destroy us look what he's
[34:32] saying this is the same thing they said
[34:34] and you brought us in the water so we
[34:36] die of thirst
[34:37] look Joshua is shouting the same way
[34:40] that in the looters but what it was just
[34:43] a moment of weakness and you say amen to
[34:45] that
[34:45] those other people that died the voters
[34:48] that was their whole character but
[34:50] Joshua was just he had a moment of
[34:51] weakness he's a born-again believer he's
[34:53] in the promised land and one defeat one
[34:57] defeat really discourages him he gets a
[34:59] little discouraged brother bed and he
[35:01] starts talking like they used to talk
[35:02] out denomination say like that you
[35:04] understand I just used to talk like they
[35:07] they were they were more worldly out in
[35:09] the world out in the desert you know
[35:10] talk like those other church members he
[35:12] wasn't talking like a real son of God
[35:14] Amen now look what happens look what he
[35:16] says I think this is striking would to
[35:20] god we been contented well the other
[35:21] side of Jordan by now he's nobody's like
[35:24] reverting back to what he used to say
[35:26] before he was born again
[35:28] alright never why do we even press
[35:30] through to the Holy Ghost why didn't
[35:31] even pray and fast why did he even do
[35:33] this if we're just going to get
[35:34] destroyed
[35:35] he lost his he's like he fell a little
[35:37] bit on his face nobody see that he got
[35:39] discouraged he got weak the Bible says
[35:42] that's right but look what the Lord says
[35:46] birthday oh lord what shall I say when
[35:48] Israel turned their backs before their
[35:49] enemies he says verse 9 for the
[35:53] Canaanites and all that happens the land
[35:54] shall hear of it and shout and Biron us
[35:57] around and cut off our name from the
[35:58] earth and what wilt thou do into the
[36:00] great name look at the Lord says look at
[36:02] the Lord look how look how straight God
[36:04] is with Joshua the same way he was with
[36:07] Moses verse 10 and the Lord said to
[36:09] Joshua get the ax
[36:10] wherefore liest thou upon that face that
[36:13] remind gift when Moses said and he cried
[36:16] out to God remember the Lord your
[36:18] lettuce died why have you brought us
[36:19] here to the Red Sea and he said why he
[36:21] cried unto me speak to the turn of
[36:23] Israel and go forward
[36:24] amen and he just lost his vision for a
[36:27] moment
[36:28] he just got weak for a moment and God
[36:31] has gotta correct him said get off your
[36:32] face there's any time to get on your
[36:34] face
[36:34] this is time to search the church and
[36:36] get him cleaned out and move forward
[36:38] amen see God doesn't want us to wallow
[36:40] around right wall around your mistake
[36:43] look this mistake was a lot around
[36:45] Burton love God got him up off his face
[36:48] got it cleaned up and started moving
[36:50] forward again hey Ben don't you like
[36:52] that bad but you like that army this is
[36:54] the army of the Living God amen Oh
[36:56] hallelujah praise the Lord I hope you
[36:59] like that amen
[37:00] God encourages them he just says a verse
[37:02] 11 that Israel sin they transgress my
[37:05] covenant and he says I got search and go
[37:09] through the land cannot be a curse stick
[37:11] amen
[37:12] alright now verse enough sorry man let's
[37:15] get the rest of chapter 7 you know that
[37:17] all his girl stones with stones the
[37:19] Bible said they burned them with fired
[37:20] their families it's quite an awful
[37:23] picture but that shows what we should do
[37:25] is sit in our lives right yeah the Holy
[37:27] Spirit the Bible said God is a consuming
[37:29] fire
[37:30] let God let his fire consume all your
[37:33] lusts or your desires I don't mind up
[37:35] with the Word of God let him burn up
[37:37] that lust exactly right it was lust to
[37:40] be like Babylon in the garments you know
[37:42] all these gold wedges and all these
[37:43] things all these gold fancy things like
[37:45] we're talking like we're preaching about
[37:46] amen
[37:47] go get concerned with those now verse 1
[37:52] of chapter 8 that was our text so
[37:55] immediately after this
[37:57] they've got the sin taking care of the
[37:59] sin is confessed and now God said the
[38:02] second time he said be not afraid that
[38:04] was our text tonight
[38:05] be not afraid if you're not so Joshua
[38:07] got to the spot where he's a little
[38:09] fearful he's crying out so the Lord wish
[38:12] maybe we shouldn't even cover though the
[38:14] promised land maybe we should have not
[38:16] pressing the backs of the Holy Ghost if
[38:17] we're going to just be defeated they
[38:20] take care of the city but that God has
[38:22] to courage him and say don't fear
[38:24] there's nothing to be afraid of I'm with
[38:27] you and notice he says verse 2 and now
[38:32] shopping to a I to her King as now gets
[38:34] under Jericho and hurricane only the
[38:36] squirrel thereof in the calendar
[38:38] shall I take for a prey unto yourself
[38:40] lady an ambush for the city behind it
[38:43] okay now in chapter 8 he finishes off AI
[38:50] which AI was a great land about it was a
[38:52] great mighty land and they get the
[38:54] victory at AI that's the second
[38:56] you call them fear no chapter knife you
[38:59] have your Bible chapter 9 is the lead
[39:01] with the Gibeonites
[39:05] now this is where the Gibeonites
[39:07] memorably where they hid ice if I'm not
[39:08] mistaken my mistake
[39:12] just a minute right does anybody
[39:17] remember I can't remember
[39:45] sorry it's the third one I would start
[39:48] at the fourth one I went down forgive me
[39:50] hey bite with the lead the hip is
[39:52] raptured the Gibeonites so here we see a
[39:55] picture in Chapter 9 forgive me I had
[39:57] them better memorize this morning
[39:59] chapter 9 is that unites the member
[40:02] Gideon's was a huge city even greater
[40:04] than AI in chapter 10 verse 2 tells us
[40:07] that but look at chapter 9 let's just
[40:09] look at a few scriptures in chapter 9
[40:14] now look at verse 15 and the men took of
[40:17] their victuals and ash not counsel at
[40:19] the mouth of the Lord look at this
[40:22] Joshua listens to their plea they say oh
[40:24] no we're not we're not from his land
[40:26] iversity let's make make a league with
[40:29] us then he don't kill us and they didn't
[40:31] even ask the Lord didn't ask the Lord oh
[40:35] we should pray every day then we should
[40:37] pray and ask God what's your will for
[40:38] them the next step what is your will
[40:41] so once this is the one mark I think I
[40:43] can fight against Josh with anybody
[40:44] think about the others I can't think of
[40:45] any other marks against Joshua I have
[40:49] secant but if you can't let me know I
[40:50] like to know because he's such a
[40:52] beautiful type of the Holy Spirit such a
[40:54] beautiful type of Christ and brother
[40:56] branham which love em said right so look
[41:00] at he says here they didn't ask counsel
[41:02] the Lord that sounds just like David
[41:04] David was on a he was an invincible man
[41:06] admits Volare by the Holy Spirit
[41:08] till he stopped and didn't ask God about
[41:11] Bathsheba remember God said had you
[41:12] asked me from actually but I might have
[41:14] done something right
[41:15] I might have answered your requests or
[41:16] something like that but he didn't ask
[41:19] the Lord oh my god help us to ask the
[41:21] Lord for everything Amen verse 15 and
[41:23] Joshua made peace with them and made a
[41:25] leave with them let them live in the
[41:27] prints of the congregation the Bible
[41:30] said swear unto dead remember they were
[41:33] not supposed to make any leave with
[41:35] anybody that's Deuteronomy 7 - and
[41:37] you're Josh no forgot to pray about it
[41:40] remember you just got discouraged Mike
[41:42] start talking like a sanctified person
[41:44] let's go back you know let's go back to
[41:46] God we came to the promised land you
[41:48] know and then God says fear not they get
[41:51] a great victory but the next step you
[41:53] just made one mistake he didn't pray
[41:55] about the Gibeonites and so the Hittites
[41:58] make a league with him now I want to
[42:00] show you the scripture where they find
[42:01] out because it's three days later yeah
[42:05] verse 16 and it came to pass at the end
[42:07] of the three days after they made a
[42:08] leave with them
[42:09] that they heard that they were their
[42:10] neighbors and that they dwelt among them
[42:11] and then they get upset with themselves
[42:17] now Church did you did you notice this I
[42:21] don't know but you read through this
[42:22] lately but Israel cannot change their
[42:25] work Joshua cannot go back and undo this
[42:27] lead he can't break the Covenant because
[42:29] he said I give this covenant in the name
[42:32] of the Lord in church of we give
[42:34] somebody a promise in the name of the
[42:35] Lord or we promise something you never
[42:37] take it back did you make a vow the
[42:39] Bible said make sure you pay it defer
[42:42] not to pay your vow and all of Israel
[42:44] says well we can't change it now we've
[42:46] got to live with this we're just going
[42:47] to make them our servants so the Bible
[42:49] said lift out of verse 27 and Joshua
[42:51] made them that day hewers of wood that
[42:53] became cutters of wood and drawers of
[42:56] water for the entire congregation and
[42:58] for the altar the Lord even unto this
[43:00] day in the place where he should choose
[43:02] so Joshua says fine I can't take back my
[43:04] word but you're gonna cut all the trees
[43:06] for us you're gonna bring all the
[43:07] Potters to us these are the Hittites
[43:09] right the Hittites and remember him I've
[43:12] typed out
[43:13] friendship with the world see they made
[43:15] friends they should not have made
[43:17] friends and the Bible also calls that
[43:19] you know it all for your spiritual
[43:20] adultery spiritual fornication
[43:22] they have this friendship that they
[43:24] should not have had right
[43:26] oh my church we see that a lot with
[43:28] relationships you know you'll see people
[43:30] coming to message them though they'll
[43:32] get involved with somebody's not a
[43:33] believer right and then they'll pretty
[43:35] soon that relationship will pull them
[43:36] away or we've seen this a lot lately two
[43:39] people are married and they say there
[43:41] are believers but then one of them will
[43:43] start out the message and then they'll
[43:45] start pulling the other one away you
[43:48] know that and they have that French if
[43:50] they have that association where they
[43:52] choose friendship with the world more
[43:54] than friendship with the Word of God and
[43:56] that's the him I that must be driven out
[43:58] but this is the one where Joshua failed
[44:00] he made a mistake he wasn't supposed to
[44:04] do that now chapter 10 let's go to
[44:05] chapter 10 I'm almost to the spot I want
[44:08] to go to chapter 11 church and then I
[44:10] want to go back over those seven of
[44:13] seven nations briefly and I want to read
[44:15] the scriptures how that explaining the
[44:17] types that overcome it and I feel pretty
[44:20] good about this and I feel like I've
[44:21] caught up pretty good about the grace
[44:23] Lord okay
[44:26] yeah so Josh looked at not okay so
[44:32] here's the third and final time God has
[44:34] to tell Joshua don't don't fear so go to
[44:36] verse 8 chapter 10 verse 8 now let me
[44:39] bring you up to speed on verses 1 to 7
[44:42] all these nations I'm sorry there's
[44:45] there's five kings of the am rights
[44:47] start hearing how a I was defeated and
[44:50] so they say we're working that their
[44:52] hearts are melting the Bible said they
[44:54] say we got to get in one league and we
[44:55] gotta fight against Joshua so we'll come
[44:58] to Gideon and we'll have a five-fold
[45:01] kind of battle a union against Joshua
[45:05] and we'll destroy them ahead to November
[45:09] the Gibeonites were greater than Israel
[45:11] every nation was already greater than
[45:13] Israel so now they got five nations
[45:15] greater greater than that coming against
[45:19] them they got five nations already
[45:25] greater than them coming against them I
[45:28] can't imagine that you and I we can
[45:30] imagine that
[45:32] and they're all gathered up at verse 8
[45:34] let's read it together
[45:36] 1 2 3 and the Lord said unto joshua beer
[45:40] mem not for i have delivered them into
[45:42] thy hand there shall not a man of them
[45:45] stand before the hay then so get the
[45:49] picture there around the gibbet which
[45:50] member was right in Jerusalem and Joshua
[45:53] gets word that 8 kings and all my kings
[45:56] have gathered around so they're
[45:58] surrounded there I'm sorry I'm not sure
[46:01] that they're surrounded let me take that
[46:02] back there's something somewhere around
[46:04] there there's some wherever on the
[46:05] Gibeonites
[46:06] but look at verse look at verse 9 God is
[46:09] Joshua a secret way to to attack them
[46:13] verse 9
[46:14] Joshua never came up unto them suddenly
[46:16] and went up from yoga all night so he
[46:20] does a night attack right a surprise
[46:23] attack when the enemy's not expecting it
[46:26] God brings Joshua with the power of the
[46:28] Holy Spirit amen but they're at least
[46:30] expecting it when the other B comes in
[46:32] like a flood the Spirit of God raises
[46:34] Haman and are then you might have a
[46:36] great battle in front of you but watch
[46:38] God you'll bleed you took the right time
[46:40] and season to get victory over that
[46:42] great head man 5 ever-ripe Kings oh let
[46:47] me see what the hammer is Burgundy's I
[46:48] keep forgetting these I had them good
[46:50] this morning okay that was the fleshy
[46:52] lusts that war against the soul these
[46:53] fleshly habits and addictions right
[46:56] there was five kings that type out these
[46:58] fleshy addictions so there was a great
[47:00] fleshly lusts you know habits there and
[47:03] God sent Josh with the power of the
[47:05] Spirit and suddenly took them over amen
[47:07] glory and he slew east lose them with a
[47:12] great slaughter and the Bible said even
[47:14] cast greatest in verse 11 cast down
[47:17] great stones from heaven upon them so
[47:20] there were more that died with
[47:21] hailstones
[47:22] than they whom the turn of Israel slew
[47:24] with the sword so really it was a very
[47:27] very easy battle they had to kill a few
[47:30] people had a little bit of fighting
[47:31] themselves what God did most of it
[47:33] by great stones by great revelations
[47:36] I don't think so it is a revelation
[47:38] ain't that upon this rock I'll build my
[47:41] church amen
[47:43] Church and that honestly is my testimony
[47:45] think of all think of yours think of all
[47:48] your fleshly dishes I could go I could
[47:50] name some really awful things I was
[47:51] addicted to but when the revelation of
[47:53] this word came it came so probably just
[47:56] the revelation of these stones that they
[47:58] just started pulling off one after
[48:00] another
[48:00] no one ever begged me know that the
[48:02] preach I've either quit smoking and all
[48:03] these things like that and chewing and
[48:05] then the evil movies all these things by
[48:08] the grace of God with these great stones
[48:10] came it was a mighty victory amen
[48:12] I didn't have too much of a fight it was
[48:14] God's doing it for me I didn't say amen
[48:16] to that
[48:17] these are flesh you love these are
[48:19] amirite Kings 5 of them 5 great fleshly
[48:23] habits that God knocks out so I said
[48:26] suddenly a mad sudden victory praise God
[48:30] can you relate to that have you had a
[48:33] time where God gave you great sudden
[48:34] victory over numerous enemies numerous
[48:37] addictions praise God I hope you can and
[48:39] if not the praise the Lord God give you
[48:40] victory some other way amen
[48:42] because you're sitting here tonight in
[48:43] the house of God hallelujah thank you
[48:46] Jesus
[48:47] so thankful yes I'd love to see myself
[48:49] in the Word of God
[48:50] I notice you mama just you had something
[48:53] like that happen to you crazy done you
[48:54] can see yourself as Joshua praise God
[48:56] because you got the victory hey so
[48:59] that's where five of the hemorrhoids
[49:02] Kings were destroyed that's chapter 10
[49:06] and that's the last time got us to tell
[49:08] Joshua don't fear that's the last time
[49:11] truth he's already told three times and
[49:14] that's the last time he's gonna do it
[49:15] now if you know the story those five
[49:18] kings were caught in a cave remember
[49:19] that so they went and killed everybody
[49:21] you know all those soldiers they come
[49:23] back to the cave and here they roll back
[49:27] the stone from the cave look there's got
[49:28] to be a type in there of the
[49:30] Resurrection cell now I don't know I
[49:32] haven't caught that one yet but hang on
[49:34] maybe they will get it but they roll the
[49:37] stone away and out set these five kings
[49:39] and Joshua says this in verse 24 and it
[49:43] came to pass when they brought out those
[49:44] teens of the Joshua that Joshua called
[49:46] for all the men in Israel and said the
[49:48] captains of the
[49:49] war which went with him come near put
[49:51] your feet up on the necks of these kings
[49:52] and they came here and put their feet on
[49:54] next these pigs and Joshua send them
[49:56] fear not nor be dismayed be strong and
[50:00] of good courage for thus shall the Lord
[50:02] do to all your enemies against whom
[50:05] youth fight and they got slew right
[50:07] after that so did you catch that at this
[50:11] moment now Joshua's not the one who's
[50:15] being told to stop fearing now Joshua is
[50:18] the one saying to the people don't fear
[50:20] amen
[50:21] he's matured so much spiritual that now
[50:24] God does have a stomachache
[50:25] no fear Tasha but we discouraged he's
[50:28] now so seem so much victory in his life
[50:30] that now he's the ones other people
[50:32] don't fear look at these enemies fall
[50:34] before you we're gonna keep going we're
[50:36] more than conquerors in Christ Jesus
[50:37] amen
[50:38] if these five himself what about the
[50:41] rest so that's all about this now Josh
[50:46] was the one said what the father said
[50:48] praise the Lord that's what we have to
[50:50] God was God wants us as sons and
[50:52] daughters to saying what he already said
[50:54] he Laurie thank you Jesus he's saying
[51:00] what God said they meant he's confessing
[51:02] the Word of God I love that so he gonna
[51:04] find that that's in the scripture there
[51:06] he's repeating what God told him be
[51:08] strong and of good courage will overcome
[51:11] the rest of the enemies praise God amen
[51:13] now chapter 10 also you remember was the
[51:15] time where Josh would need a little more
[51:17] time to fight and he spoke to the Sun
[51:19] and the Sun Stood Still
[51:21] praise God right in there so he used the
[51:23] spoken word and did a paradox for the
[51:25] grander center he spoke the Word of God
[51:27] the Sun Stood Still not explained that
[51:30] scientifically how the Sun stands I
[51:32] don't know I can't explain that but we
[51:34] don't have to praise the Lord right the
[51:36] Bible says that and he speaks the word
[51:38] and eat a little more time for the
[51:39] Emiratis and God gave them that and God
[51:42] will give us a little more time as well
[51:44] amen
[51:44] now chapter 11 this is where I'm gonna
[51:46] start moving to get ready to go back to
[51:50] the 7 here this is the last thing I'm
[51:51] gonna really say chapter 11 is this is
[51:54] chapters called the final conquest of
[51:56] Canaan and remember this is after many
[52:00] years so let's go to Joshua 11
[52:02] so you can see this that some of these
[52:05] battles are spread out over many years
[52:07] this is all that happened in one year
[52:09] like the Bible said God didn't give
[52:11] Joshua you know a victory right away
[52:13] over everybody he had to fight year
[52:15] after year after year
[52:17] look at verse ad Joshua made war a long
[52:20] time with all of those kings
[52:24] you see we're getting a picture here
[52:26] where these battles are told but these
[52:29] are just the highlights of the many
[52:30] battles that he fought right because
[52:33] number chapter 12 he lists 31 Kings that
[52:35] he and Moses off slew 31 you can you can
[52:39] count about chapter 12 is like the Train
[52:42] on the Lord's robe you know remember the
[52:45] train filled the temple and the longer
[52:46] your train was was the more victory she
[52:48] had on your on your road there under
[52:50] training and that's what chapter 12 is
[52:52] like it's the roll call of all God's
[52:55] victories it's all the testimonies of
[52:57] all the the names of enemies that's been
[52:59] defeated by God's living army amen and
[53:02] that's what chapter 12 is now in chapter
[53:04] 11
[53:04] glory I want to show you too that God
[53:10] everything Joshua was commanded to do he
[53:12] did I want to show you that flaming the
[53:14] scripture let's go to verse 15 11:15 and
[53:18] then as the LORD commanded Moses the
[53:21] servant so did Moses command Joshua and
[53:23] so did Joshua he left nothing undone of
[53:26] all that the LORD commanded Moses amen
[53:29] no where's he finished the ministry that
[53:32] was before him and church that's what
[53:34] we're supposed to do we're supposed to
[53:35] finish the Great Commission
[53:36] I mean know that we're supposed to
[53:38] prophesy again the word the open book
[53:40] all the prophecies were supposed to take
[53:42] that eat it and prophesized every nation
[53:45] amen this is exactly right now verse 23
[53:49] as well so Joshua took the whole and
[53:52] according to all that the Lord said unto
[53:53] Moses and Joshua gave it for an
[53:57] inheritance unto Israel according to
[53:59] their divisions by their tribes and the
[54:01] lambs rested from war praise the Lord
[54:04] so they had a little time of rest after
[54:06] all the victories amen
[54:08] now one more thing about chapter 11
[54:12] chapter 11 lists a lot of the
[54:18] enemies that weren't defeated okay let's
[54:21] go to verse verse one okay Berta chapter
[54:33] 11 is another great huge conquest
[54:36] it's another united battle against
[54:38] Israel and Israel wins again despite all
[54:40] the demon spirits uniting against them
[54:42] what a testimony praise God all the
[54:45] demons can unite all the demons can
[54:46] fight this church but if we've got the
[54:48] Holy Spirit
[54:49] we'll beat every one of them amen no
[54:51] matter who well let's say try to do it
[54:53] up put poison in this person or or put
[54:56] give a sickness on this person would it
[54:58] mean everyone if we stay true to God you
[54:59] and they can rally around and do
[55:02] whatever they want if we got the Holy
[55:03] Spirit were more than common that's what
[55:06] they try to to try to bully up like good
[55:09] Goliath you know try to bully because
[55:11] he's bigger you know have an
[55:12] intimidation but they'll never win over
[55:14] God's Word amen
[55:16] now verse 11 verses 1 to 1 - 2 numbers 3
[55:19] & 2 the Canaanite on the east of the
[55:21] west and to the amorite and the hittite
[55:23] and the perizzite and the jebusite and
[55:25] the bow said they him i under Herman in
[55:27] the land of miss us obviously there are
[55:28] some Hittites that were not in a given
[55:31] but also south and look at all these
[55:34] nations these are most of the nations
[55:36] that we just we've been preaching on
[55:37] they all gather at some point in verse 4
[55:39] and they went out they and all the hosts
[55:41] with that much people even as it's and
[55:43] that is upon the seashore and mom food
[55:45] with horses and chariots very many and
[55:47] when all the kings were met together
[55:49] they came and pitched together at the
[55:50] waters of Marah to fight against Israel
[55:53] and the lord said unto joshua be not
[55:56] afraid because of them I'm sorry I
[55:57] missed that that's one more time he said
[55:59] be not afraid forgiving I think that's
[56:00] the third and final time I missed that
[56:02] one two three oh there's four okay
[56:09] forgive me that was four times Joshua
[56:11] was home for you're not in one time
[56:13] Joshua told them fear not so forgive me
[56:15] I got my number to myself I've missed
[56:16] this there's actually four times God
[56:19] tells us Joshua don't fear this is a
[56:20] fourth and final time which that would
[56:24] type out good because there's four
[56:25] annoying things that we overcome by
[56:26] through the seventh seal remember that
[56:27] the first four seals that's a good
[56:30] now verse 6 and the Lord said to Joshua
[56:33] be not afraid because of that for
[56:35] tomorrow about this time will I deliver
[56:37] them up all slain before Israel thou
[56:40] shalt off their horses and burn their
[56:42] chairs of fire and so Joshua came and
[56:44] all the people war with them against
[56:46] them by the waters of Maryland suddenly
[56:48] and they fell upon that and the Lord
[56:51] delivered them into the head of Israel
[56:52] who smote them and chased them unto
[56:53] great Sidon and unto this Ripoff wreck
[56:57] made and unto the valley of Mizpah
[57:00] eastward and they smote him until they
[57:01] left them none remaining and Joshua did
[57:05] unto them as the Lord made and he caught
[57:06] their horses of Burger charts with fire
[57:10] amen praise the Lord so you can see this
[57:16] the Bible is in chapter 10 and 11 all
[57:19] those seven nations in him against
[57:21] Joshua and knotted at the same old times
[57:24] he gave them a sudden victory praise God
[57:26] seven victories over all seven of these
[57:29] and churches many know about deliverance
[57:31] many times God does deliver people
[57:33] suddenly right there just be a certain
[57:36] moment there's a certain service there's
[57:37] a certain moment but man bought it from
[57:39] that time line there's a certain time
[57:41] where somebody gets to victory and
[57:42] that's how we say it's a red-letter day
[57:44] bromance and that's a red-letter day
[57:46] when the victory comes and God brings
[57:48] the victory suddenly now these victories
[57:50] might be spread out over years right
[57:52] little by little they're spread out over
[57:54] years but see that's why we always hang
[57:56] on because we never know like I told
[57:57] brother amen when he first came into
[57:59] vestige I said brother I've seen so many
[58:00] miracles and he said well we want to go
[58:03] he was kind of led to see once I said
[58:05] just come to every service just be in
[58:07] the house of God as much as you can
[58:08] because you never know when God's gonna
[58:10] leave early in that and it's got to be
[58:13] there be faithful watch God and gotta
[58:15] bring deliverance amen not very victory
[58:17] we just got to trust in the Lord in
[58:19] glory see sudden victories over each one
[58:23] of these nations each one God getting
[58:25] from the victory and each one they were
[58:27] outnumbered each one that should have
[58:29] lost by looking at the physical the
[58:30] natural but Josh boys looked at the
[58:32] spiritual a day man he looked at this
[58:34] captain of the Lord's host praise God
[58:36] amen and he obeyed the Word of God he
[58:38] had good courage we could be a
[58:40] and every battle we fight no matter how
[58:43] we do you no matter how great the child
[58:45] is we could be encouraged grace God let
[58:48] me just go through briefly chapters 12
[58:50] is a list of the feet of canes through
[58:52] Moses and Joshua because Moses even
[58:55] defeated some amirite Kings as well lead
[58:57] to a muraki's before they even got to
[58:58] the promised land
[59:00] chapters 13 2 through 22 gosh would
[59:04] divides up the land and I heard of a
[59:06] minister one time say he wasn't a
[59:08] message minister he said this is kind of
[59:09] the boring part because it talks about
[59:10] all the quarters now might be boring for
[59:13] us to were Gentiles but that meant a lot
[59:15] to those Jews in other words they could
[59:17] say this is from the border the coast of
[59:19] this to the north to the to the
[59:21] southeast that meant off then because
[59:23] that land was theirs praise God this was
[59:25] there
[59:26] this was their book of inheritance we'd
[59:28] say what's the word I'm looking for this
[59:30] was their title deed that's it that's
[59:32] the word I'm looking for this is their
[59:34] title deed to us it might not mean much
[59:35] but to them it gave of all the details
[59:39] the call of God upon their life they met
[59:42] I can live I can drain it from here to
[59:45] here and this is the boundaries that I
[59:47] would be a king and priest in this land
[59:49] they better
[59:50] that's chapters 13 to 22 in chapters 23
[59:53] to 24 Joshua's final words now let's go
[59:58] to chapter 24 I wonder what make sure I
[59:59] read that to Joshua 24 I just want to
[1:00:06] read those last few scriptures so you
[1:00:07] can see that once again Josh was going
[1:00:10] off the scene and he tells him you've
[1:00:11] got you we've given you the victory
[1:00:13] we've got the victory but you gotta
[1:00:15] serve the Lord and you gotta keep these
[1:00:17] coming back in is if you left that back
[1:00:19] in that you have two goats back in God's
[1:00:21] gonna kick you out of the land which is
[1:00:23] exactly what happened is fortunate all
[1:00:27] right that talks about Bailey Balaam and
[1:00:30] Balak and Chet and verse not high verse
[1:00:33] 10 verse let's read verse 11 and you
[1:00:35] went over Jordan and came unto Jericho
[1:00:37] and the men Jericho fought against you
[1:00:39] the hammer eggs the parasites the
[1:00:40] Canaanites the Hittites and the
[1:00:42] girgashites and the Hivites and the
[1:00:43] Jebusites
[1:00:44] and I deliver them into your hand you
[1:00:46] picture this Josh was dying and he's
[1:00:49] saying we've defeated everyone that God
[1:00:51] said we would in other words this
[1:00:54] day this scripture of Moses is fulfilled
[1:00:56] amen we are standing in the victory we
[1:00:59] are the fulfillment of all God's
[1:01:00] promises to Abraham haha 900 years of
[1:01:04] fast and now we're walking into life
[1:01:06] we're marking where the Apostles have
[1:01:08] trod amen
[1:01:09] can you understand we're walking into
[1:01:11] the blessing we've been used by God to
[1:01:14] fulfill his promise word we are the
[1:01:16] conquerors they met mother knew again
[1:01:19] verse 12 and I said the Hornet before
[1:01:21] you which traded them out from before
[1:01:23] you even the two kings and the
[1:01:25] hammerheads I was with Moses but not
[1:01:27] with thy sword nor with my boat and I've
[1:01:30] given you a land for which he did not
[1:01:32] labor and cities that you built thought
[1:01:33] and dwell in them of the vineyards and
[1:01:36] olive the arts which you planted not do
[1:01:39] you eat now therefore fear the Lord
[1:01:43] serve Him in sincerity and truth and put
[1:01:46] away the gods which your father's served
[1:01:47] on the other side of the flood and in
[1:01:49] Egypt and serve the Lord and here's our
[1:01:52] famous scripture the one that's all over
[1:01:54] posters it's all over cars and all over
[1:01:56] churches and haven't seen Eve unto you
[1:01:58] to serve the Lord choose you this day
[1:02:00] whom you will serve whether the gods
[1:02:02] which your father's served that we're on
[1:02:05] the other side of the flood of the
[1:02:06] gods-damned writes in whose land as well
[1:02:08] but as for me and my house we will serve
[1:02:11] the Lord even not beautiful they've
[1:02:13] defeated all these seven nations we'd
[1:02:15] say these seven demon powers and Joshua
[1:02:18] still telling them choose who you're
[1:02:20] gonna serve
[1:02:21] you've got victory but you've got to
[1:02:23] keep the victory that's why we keep
[1:02:25] coming back to church that's why you
[1:02:26] keep reading your Bible afraid to listen
[1:02:28] at the brother Han stage if you've got
[1:02:29] victory praise God but you've got to
[1:02:31] keep the video game in because you don't
[1:02:33] know what the future holds but you know
[1:02:35] the enemy's gonna come in like a flood
[1:02:36] amen all right now let's go back to the
[1:02:40] side show me okay let's go back and I
[1:02:42] just want to read over these positive
[1:02:43] New Testament Scriptures again and I
[1:02:46] want to rehearse those that I have maybe
[1:02:50] a quote or two to finish how much time I
[1:02:52] got
[1:02:52] okay seventeen minutes he barely made us
[1:02:54] take a deep breath been praising the
[1:02:57] Lord amen let's go back and let's go
[1:02:59] over those one more time I want to hit
[1:03:00] the highlights
[1:03:03] yeah let's go back there real quick by
[1:03:09] the grace of God I hope I didn't go too
[1:03:12] fast for those this morning but if I did
[1:03:14] forgive me but like I said he could
[1:03:15] preach a whole series on the root of
[1:03:16] evil you know being the love of money
[1:03:18] you could preach the whole series on
[1:03:19] that okay so let's go to first john 2:15
[1:03:23] let's just read that by God's grace
[1:03:25] first John 2:15 through 17
[1:03:30] these are the modern-day Canaanites it's
[1:03:41] a real battle America isn't it Church
[1:03:43] isn't it it's a real battle American
[1:03:45] this even types over to our Laodicean
[1:03:47] Church age rich and increased with Goods
[1:03:49] this is clearly a demon we've got the
[1:03:52] battle on this day the spirit of the
[1:03:55] Canaanites we say which is natural but
[1:03:57] the spirit of it which types riches
[1:04:00] treasures merchants right possessions
[1:04:03] we've got a battle that but we're more
[1:04:06] than conquerors they've been looked out
[1:04:09] the world these are the things that are
[1:04:11] in the world if any man love the world
[1:04:13] the love of the father is not in him for
[1:04:15] all that is in the world the lust of the
[1:04:16] flesh and the lust of the eyes the pride
[1:04:18] of life is not of the Father but is of
[1:04:20] the world and the world passes away and
[1:04:23] the lust through but either do it the
[1:04:25] will of God abideth forever amen
[1:04:28] now there's another scripture I want to
[1:04:30] go to let's go to 2nd Timothy was
[1:04:32] chapter 4 it just kind of came to me
[1:04:35] about the snares again I know I got
[1:04:37] snares on there later but I want to go
[1:04:41] to this one here remember where he
[1:04:44] charges the rich of this world maybe I
[1:04:46] got the wrong book or chapter I'm sorry
[1:04:54] 1st Timothy 6 forgetting not second
[1:04:57] Timothy its first Timothy 6 forgiving
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:04] okay verse 5 verse Timothy 65 perverse
[1:05:08] the students of men of corrupt minds and
[1:05:10] destitute of the truth supposing that
[1:05:12] gain is godliness from such withdraw
[1:05:14] thyself that's a great lesson we can
[1:05:16] learn just because someone is prospering
[1:05:19] physically with more money or something
[1:05:20] that doesn't mean God's with that that's
[1:05:23] what the scripture is playing on that
[1:05:24] they suppose well to seem like it is
[1:05:27] godliness most like they must be serving
[1:05:28] God right
[1:05:29] if activity says well withdraw yourself
[1:05:32] from those who think that gain is
[1:05:33] godliness that's why we're against the
[1:05:35] prosperity gospel right that's why we
[1:05:38] don't preach that's why we don't follow
[1:05:39] that's why it's not the name and claim
[1:05:41] on a million-dollar search cuff you know
[1:05:43] we just don't do that because the Bible
[1:05:45] says would draw yourself from anyone
[1:05:46] like that get away from that because
[1:05:49] that's getting into this Canaanite
[1:05:50] spirit but godliness with contentment is
[1:05:53] great gain and I think that's what we
[1:05:56] have to battle right can we be content
[1:05:57] with our wages right can we be content
[1:06:01] with our homes and our cars and can we
[1:06:03] be content with that and I think you can
[1:06:05] see that we need God's grace with that
[1:06:07] right in America there's so much all the
[1:06:08] American Dream the American Dream the
[1:06:10] American Dream there's so much pressure
[1:06:12] with riches and that's the pressure for
[1:06:15] our age but the Bible says you we must
[1:06:17] have contentment and that will give us a
[1:06:20] great spiritual game I know this is
[1:06:22] familiar but it's good to read it over
[1:06:24] verse 7 for we brought nothing into this
[1:06:27] row and is certain we can carry nothing
[1:06:29] out and having food and raiment let us
[1:06:32] be therewith content but they which be
[1:06:36] rich fall into temptation and a snare
[1:06:38] and too many foolish and hurtful lusts
[1:06:40] which drown men in destruction and
[1:06:42] perdition now that sound like akin right
[1:06:45] drowned and destruction right is like
[1:06:47] God drowning in stones he was drowned
[1:06:50] because of his loss of money
[1:06:52] most of the gold weighs must about
[1:06:53] loaning garments for the love of money
[1:06:56] is the root of all evil which while some
[1:06:58] coveted after they have erred from the
[1:07:01] faith and pierced themselves through
[1:07:03] with many sorrows but Thou O man of God
[1:07:06] flee these things and follow after
[1:07:08] righteousness godliness faith love
[1:07:10] patience meekness and fight the good
[1:07:13] they lay a hold on eternal life amen
[1:07:16] aren't you glad you could fight the
[1:07:17] Canaanite today amen
[1:07:19] you can fight that spirit that gain is
[1:07:21] godliness right amen so that was good
[1:07:26] hope that's a blessing member hittite
[1:07:28] I'm gonna skip ahead to this was fear
[1:07:32] fear let's go to first John 4:17 very
[1:07:36] familiar but I want to read it as well
[1:07:38] by God's grace there's been numerous
[1:07:43] times I've got text and even posts on
[1:07:46] YouTube about how things I've preached
[1:07:48] less different people around the world
[1:07:50] most recent was El Salvador some from
[1:07:53] the Pennsylvania Saints you know
[1:07:55] different things so we must never
[1:07:57] underestimate just the power of the word
[1:07:59] of God say nay 1st John 4:17
[1:08:04] here it is our love made perfect that we
[1:08:07] may have boldness in the Day of Judgment
[1:08:08] because as he is so are we in this world
[1:08:12] there's no fear in love but perfect love
[1:08:15] casts out fear because fear hath torment
[1:08:18] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[1:08:21] love we loved him because He first loved
[1:08:25] us and Benny man say I love God and
[1:08:27] hates his brother he's a liar he that
[1:08:30] loveth not his brother whom he has seen
[1:08:31] how can he love God whom he hath not see
[1:08:34] and this commandment have we from him
[1:08:36] that he who loveth God mother's brother
[1:08:39] also how many believe you got to fight
[1:08:42] this in the message right st. he'll try
[1:08:44] to get us upset with other people in the
[1:08:45] message how many understand that he'll
[1:08:47] try to divide the body of Christ but
[1:08:50] we've got to have love that overcomes
[1:08:51] fear
[1:08:52] I know numerous people that won't even
[1:08:55] go talk or shake somebody's hand in the
[1:08:57] message because of just a disagreement
[1:08:59] this person freaks is it this way when
[1:09:02] he preaches it that way and they don't
[1:09:03] want no fellowship to do with it we need
[1:09:06] to have the love of God church to
[1:09:08] overcome our arrogance seeing our pride
[1:09:09] we can out of that pride we have to have
[1:09:12] love the Bible said if we have love we
[1:09:14] will love those who even disagreed with
[1:09:17] right if you say you love God but can't
[1:09:19] love your brother you're lying and
[1:09:21] remember love is more than a word love
[1:09:23] is the action praise God
[1:09:25] love is the action
[1:09:27] and let me just say this before I get to
[1:09:29] the complex barber when I had
[1:09:31] accomplished I had against five
[1:09:32] preachers and I didn't even realize it
[1:09:34] so I started studying complexes I called
[1:09:36] all five of the preachers to apologize
[1:09:38] for my complex and they didn't realize
[1:09:41] that had a complex against them but I
[1:09:44] didn't want to do I had a complex
[1:09:45] because whenever I knew their name I
[1:09:47] give though jealous I get a little upset
[1:09:49] alright say I wouldn't say you know I
[1:09:52] wouldn't say nice things you see that
[1:09:53] and so what did that love did that love
[1:09:57] show me we must love everyone the
[1:09:59] fathers made right the Bible says that
[1:10:01] you can't love God and then this life
[1:10:03] that people God made amen I want to make
[1:10:07] sure I bring that out that was back in I
[1:10:08] think 2012 or 2014 I'm not mistaken one
[1:10:11] of those years so perfect love casts out
[1:10:14] fear so if you're afraid to talk to
[1:10:16] somebody or afraid to fellowship with
[1:10:17] somebody you're afraid to address a
[1:10:19] certain situation that's fear that we
[1:10:22] must have cast out fear
[1:10:23] crazy God please go now here Mike's just
[1:10:26] someone I've messed up on her with a
[1:10:27] give a nice this was a friendship with
[1:10:29] the world forgive me let's go to change
[1:10:31] far for forgive me I couldn't think of
[1:10:34] this it lights it Mike's really give me
[1:10:40] nice James 4:4 so sweet
[1:10:44] see the Bible Tyson adulteress and
[1:10:46] fornicators with friendship connects
[1:10:50] those two together verse 4 you get
[1:10:54] doctors and the doctor says know ye not
[1:10:56] that friendship of the world is hatred
[1:10:58] with God remember brother am like in
[1:11:02] Samson of the flirting with the world
[1:11:03] he's flirting with Delilah in a
[1:11:05] adulterous he was already married a
[1:11:07] golfer's type the situation there right
[1:11:09] program likens it unto us you know this
[1:11:11] in the rock-and-roll or loving the
[1:11:13] things of the world we used to love
[1:11:14] flirting with the devil flirting with
[1:11:16] sin right after the Bible accidental
[1:11:19] verse for whosoever therefore will be a
[1:11:21] friend of the world is an enemy of God
[1:11:24] now look at verse 5 or 6 I'm sorry five
[1:11:27] do you think that the scripture saith in
[1:11:29] vain the spirit of the dwells in us to
[1:11:31] lust is to nd how many know the Bible
[1:11:34] said our God is a jealous God I had a
[1:11:37] sister this week in the Apostolic
[1:11:38] denomination called me on my way home
[1:11:41] Tuesday when I dropped off brother
[1:11:42] Sampson and Lima she called me up and
[1:11:45] she said thank you for your message on
[1:11:46] long dresses in the Bible and makeup in
[1:11:49] the Bible and modest clothing she said
[1:11:52] the Holy Ghost has been in my ear
[1:11:55] telling me that I'm jealous of you cover
[1:11:59] up your thighs because I guess she was
[1:12:01] wearing even in that massage church
[1:12:02] where he skirts up went up and shown her
[1:12:04] thighs and old high heels to that's the
[1:12:06] one she was on she said you need to make
[1:12:08] a video on high heels I said I might do
[1:12:11] that if I didn't have the time to do
[1:12:12] that but she said the Holy Spirit kept
[1:12:15] time you had to jealous over you don't
[1:12:17] push yourself up in those high heels no
[1:12:18] don't show off your your body
[1:12:20] I'm jealous over you and she said I
[1:12:23] couldn't get away from it and then God
[1:12:24] led me to your videos and then God led
[1:12:26] me to call you about high heels on my
[1:12:28] shoulder
[1:12:29] isaiah 3:16 number that they were
[1:12:31] mincing which means short steps and was
[1:12:35] the other one
[1:12:35] tinkling and tinkling is an actual noise
[1:12:38] of tinkling so they had some shoes that
[1:12:40] were similar to high heels they may not
[1:12:42] been exactly like high heels but then
[1:12:44] some and they do short steps and they
[1:12:46] make noises as they walk and she said oh
[1:12:47] praise the Lord I never seen that
[1:12:49] scripture she said God's answers are all
[1:12:51] the Bible amen
[1:12:52] I said sister there's nothing new Under
[1:12:54] the Sun all these things that they're
[1:12:57] doing now there's it was already been
[1:12:59] done the Bible says right it's the same
[1:13:01] spirit behind it might be a little
[1:13:02] different but the same spirit behind it
[1:13:04] praise God and she said that she said
[1:13:07] the Holy Spirit I've decided I'm jealous
[1:13:08] over you now God will tell an apostolic
[1:13:11] woman that he's jealous over her
[1:13:14] behavior how about how about us those of
[1:13:17] us who sit around more of the state oh
[1:13:19] they have some good that's it the Lord
[1:13:20] they have water baptism and they had to
[1:13:22] Godhead they have some good things but
[1:13:24] how much more UPS
[1:13:25] I don't say Lord and let the Holy Spirit
[1:13:28] be with me more I'm gonna say that
[1:13:29] praise God yes I want to say Holy Spirit
[1:13:33] be in my ear let me hear your voice
[1:13:35] if an apostolic woman can hear that
[1:13:38] about iost what can we hear get rid of
[1:13:41] the SAP get rid of the don't word of
[1:13:43] this website anymore right don't
[1:13:46] fellowship with that don't know don't
[1:13:48] know don't know friendship with that and
[1:13:50] if that's how we started what about true
[1:13:52] the true apostolic glory
[1:13:55] all right parasites thought that
[1:13:57] encourage you I just been really
[1:13:59] encouraged my god has been sending
[1:14:00] people to call me I got from South
[1:14:01] Carolina called about these bits of
[1:14:03] God's really been using these videos
[1:14:04] I've heard encourage parasites are
[1:14:07] worldly mindedness or spear and Eva your
[1:14:10] so really minded you forget who you are
[1:14:12] let's go to first Corinthians three
[1:14:15] three that now this is what we gotta be
[1:14:23] careful Church because we've all seen it
[1:14:25] some people have their favorite
[1:14:25] preachers right they'll only come
[1:14:28] expected when a certain preacher comes
[1:14:30] right yeah that's right that's right
[1:14:35] and that's a carnal mind and that means
[1:14:40] people are not really eating on the word
[1:14:41] they're feeding on an individual they're
[1:14:43] caught up in that person's personality
[1:14:46] I've had it to where people get excited
[1:14:49] when I fell them and there's moves of
[1:14:50] God and I leave and I the
[1:14:52] pastor's later they're kind of like oh
[1:14:53] you know I've talked to them about I
[1:14:56] know and they're talking about because
[1:14:58] it's a honeymoon with me when I come in
[1:15:00] it's like a honeymoon oh he don't do
[1:15:01] nothing wrong he just no he's he's the
[1:15:03] wonderful be someone different than our
[1:15:04] pastor and the pastor's get caught
[1:15:06] that'll be discouraged I'm better than
[1:15:10] Toby that church I know what I'm talking
[1:15:11] about they see why they so why can't God
[1:15:14] who like that when I preach yeah yeah I
[1:15:16] said I said the Rosales one time I said
[1:15:18] brother I've said because of all your
[1:15:20] planting we had an increase when I was
[1:15:22] there I not the reason there is an
[1:15:25] increase the reason there's an angry
[1:15:26] says it was because God's time to give
[1:15:28] an increase we didn't see what I'm
[1:15:30] saying I said brother you had just as
[1:15:32] much part in this because he got a
[1:15:34] little sparrow hawk on my ministry I'm
[1:15:36] the pastor how come I said brother god
[1:15:38] bless you I said has nothing to do with
[1:15:40] me it's all God's time that taught me a
[1:15:42] great lesson I can't meet a scourge if
[1:15:45] four people come up for prayer with
[1:15:46] stems and Shetty preaches and nobody
[1:15:47] come up this morning I can't be
[1:15:49] discouraged because all's I got to do is
[1:15:52] plant the Word of God and God sees it
[1:15:54] don't bring forth all the victories in
[1:15:56] our lives believe that I've gotta be
[1:15:58] like I'm not let that fear you know and
[1:16:02] you got not let that spirit get on you
[1:16:04] or you you pull for other people and not
[1:16:06] for the pastor
[1:16:07] you got it we just got a poll I got all
[1:16:09] of that four minutes of that all right
[1:16:14] and I'd rather could not speak unto you
[1:16:17] as in the spiritual but as in the carnal
[1:16:18] even as babes in Christ I fed you with
[1:16:22] milk and have not with meat for hitherto
[1:16:24] you were not able to bear it neither yet
[1:16:27] now are you a table for gr yet what
[1:16:29] carnal seat Rolly money for whereas
[1:16:32] there is among you envying and strife
[1:16:34] and divisions are all not carnal and

[1:17:00] down at the bar he's right here battling
[1:17:02] us because we're the ones think we got
[1:17:04] the Holy Ghost we got the word of the
[1:17:06] hour
[1:17:06] God is with us these signs follow us so
[1:17:09] Satan's going to battle us right so
[1:17:12] we're the ones who really got to battle
[1:17:14] this division is carnality strife

[1:19:06] chop this up peepers to this is the
[1:19:09] sphere of the perizzites we're trying to
[1:19:10] overcome this worldly minded spiritual
[1:19:14] amnesia Hebrews 2 verse 1 therefore we
[1:19:20] ought to give the more earnest heed to
[1:19:21] the things which we have heard lest at
[1:19:23] any time we should let them slip for up
[1:19:25] the words spoken by Angels will
[1:19:26] steadfast and every transgression and
[1:19:28] this will be intercede a just recompense
[1:19:30] of reward how shall we escape if we
[1:19:32] neglect so great salvation would you
[1:19:34] first began to be spoken by the Lord and
[1:19:36] was confirmed unto us by then that heard
[1:19:38] him God also bearing them witness both
[1:19:41] with signs and wonders and with diverse
[1:19:43] miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:44] according to his own will there it is
[1:19:46] neglect we've heard the deep things of
[1:19:50] God so we must be more careful with them
[1:19:52] we must not let this opportunity slip
[1:19:54] through our fingers you see that don't
[1:19:55] let it slip through our fingers you must
[1:19:57] hang on to this and we must be careful
[1:20:00] that we have always have a Holy Ghost
[1:20:02] salvation message amen salvation and to
[1:20:05] the baptism of the Holy Ghost we cannot
[1:20:07] stop a safe occasion we've got to press
[1:20:09] all the way in a bet and if you get it
[1:20:11] you sure got a battle ahead of you I
[1:20:13] knew you Thank You Laurie now can
[1:20:17] everybody see that the parasite worldly
[1:20:18] buying spiritual enemies you don't
[1:20:19] forget don't neglect this great
[1:20:21] salvation don't get all caught up in
[1:20:23] carnal and thinking I love a brother
[1:20:25] song so I'm of this church of that
[1:20:27] church be a solid Christian praise God
[1:20:30] no no respecter of persons
[1:20:34] there's my Hauer okay I'm not gonna set
[1:20:36] the timer I'll just try to finish it
[1:20:37] Girish site was the clay okay so these
[1:20:40] are unstable this is a double-minded man
[1:20:42] that's what I need to put on there need
[1:20:43] to change that and put a double-minded
[1:20:46] man that would be good or the lukewarm
[1:20:48] spirit okay let's read Psalms for you
[1:20:53] because I think you'd like that that was
[1:20:54] a real blessing to need to hear David
[1:20:56] say well it's almost 40 versus two out
[1:20:58] and equal bus I think you'd be blessed
[1:21:01] yeah psalm of david praise the Lord so
[1:21:05] remember clay represented instability
[1:21:09] right it's the opposite of a rock it's
[1:21:12] not stability its instability 40 verse 1
[1:21:16] I waited patiently for the Lord and he
[1:21:18] played unto me and heard my cry he
[1:21:20] brought me up also out of an horrible
[1:21:22] pit out of the miry clay and set my feet
[1:21:25] upon the rock and he established my
[1:21:28] goings so see what you're the rock
[1:21:30] you're established you're not going
[1:21:31] anywhere I'm here to say Amen hallelujah
[1:21:34] and he put a new song in my mouth that
[1:21:37] even praised unto our God many shall see
[1:21:39] it in fear and shall trust in God hey
[1:21:43] now the rest of you guys go to Matthew 7
[1:21:45] 9 we're not going to read all that but I
[1:21:47] just want you to see this is a
[1:21:48] double-minded man this is the
[1:21:50] instability of disappearing but not
[1:21:52] doing
[1:21:54] let's read over that parable again verse
[1:21:57] 24 Matthew 7:24 we would have to read
[1:21:59] all that all that verse 24 therefore who
[1:22:08] suffer here at these things if I to do

[1:25:52] for myself which one of my fight right
[1:25:54] now I'm about to just meditate on that
[1:25:56] for a moment
[1:25:57] first Peter 2:11 dearly beloved I
[1:26:01] beseech you as strangers of the pilgrims
[1:26:03] and staying from fleshly lusts which war
[1:26:07] against the soul sometimes you have such
[1:26:11] bad habits Church right so that we learn
[1:26:14] our habits go the fleshly habits that
[1:26:16] sometimes with you know if we're not
[1:26:17] careful will battle a my Savior I really
[1:26:19] have the Holy Ghost a little battle
[1:26:22] against your soul because you're in the
[1:26:24] flesh so much to set up walking in the
[1:26:26] spirit that's right that's right
[1:26:29] ok 2nd Timothy 2:22 then we're almost
[1:26:32] dead now Christine you've been so
[1:26:38] faithful today god bless you your hearts
[1:26:40] but I hope you're really enjoying this I
[1:26:41] I was so excited to preach this
[1:26:43] spiritually I was excited I just
[1:26:45] couldn't wait to get to church today you
[1:26:47] know preaches to everybody hope it's
[1:26:49] with less these are gold nuggets to me
[1:26:51] Church that all lines up scriptural to
[1:26:54] everything lines up for these write and
[1:26:55] order lines all up 2nd Timothy 2:22
[1:26:59] flee also youthful lusts but follow
[1:27:03] after righteousness faith charity peace
[1:27:05] with them that call on the lord out of
[1:27:08] the pure heart
[1:27:09] amen we must run human runs will never
[1:27:14] let God fight
[1:27:15] plus she loves with war against it so I
[1:27:18] would say the biggest one I've had
[1:27:19] lately Church honestly was when I told
[1:27:20] you about remember I was watching sports
[1:27:22] videos about the Cleveland Cavaliers men
[1:27:24] when I told that I just got caught up in
[1:27:27] watching that and I prayed Lord let the
[1:27:28] Cavs win this is about a year ago if you
[1:27:30] let the Cavs win I won't watch them
[1:27:32] right away in the morning and by God's
[1:27:33] grace a habit that was those that really
[1:27:35] bad on me like I would have actual night
[1:27:38] battles without guilt now some of you
[1:27:40] watched videos right some of y'all
[1:27:41] watched videos on our phones we got to
[1:27:43] be careful we watch praise the Lord
[1:27:45] that's the most recent one I can think
[1:27:47] of where I had a really fleshly lust
[1:27:49] that wore that kind of war with my mind
[1:27:52] you're not a faithful pastor let me do
[1:27:54] you know you're watching these
[1:27:55] highlights and all these things up you
[1:27:57] can't even start your day in prayer I
[1:27:58] had a real battle with that and the
[1:28:00] warrant against me but I'm thankful to
[1:28:02] say he gave me the victory in church out
[1:28:04] of the crowd like they even set out to
[1:28:06] cry oh wait patiently on the Lord he
[1:28:08] delivers last Jamie sites let's save our
[1:28:16] feet so I I'll close soon and remember
[1:28:21] this was a tough one this was a little
[1:28:23] bit tough because Jay G Buster gave us
[1:28:25] Jesus you have to look it up in Easton's
[1:28:28] and then it says fastness she must means
[1:28:31] fastest or and actually if you look at
[1:28:36] then you look up fastness and the
[1:28:37] dictionary calm it means stronghold
[1:28:39] that's where you'll find that there
[1:28:41] these were those that this was a type of
[1:28:44] strongholds and it wasn't a lot on the
[1:28:48] Jeffie sites I remember right yaks I
[1:28:50] don't have a whole lot on them so
[1:28:54] strongholds
[1:28:55] we have to drive out the complexes the
[1:28:58] strongholds like I said with my
[1:29:00] complexes I had to call those
[1:29:01] individuals and now I feel so grateful
[1:29:03] towards those people I love having them
[1:29:06] come in I love fellowship with them
[1:29:07] I'm happy for their ministry I want to
[1:29:09] see God use that more with wazzle
[1:29:10] jealous
[1:29:13] remember bloody women pride you know
[1:29:15] what one thing I mad was pride and
[1:29:17] popularity that was a lot of bad the
[1:29:18] most and so we got to go to extra Lakes
[1:29:20] so what I try to do with those of you
[1:29:22] that come and try and getting an extra
[1:29:23] blessing monetarily
[1:29:25] if they come in or if I have anything
[1:29:27] against them I'm trying to be extra
[1:29:28] black
[1:29:29] to make sure that Jeb you site doesn't
[1:29:31] run doesn't rise up
[1:29:32] that's right brother banner said again
[1:29:34] to remember his battles money had to
[1:29:36] make special efforts so he didn't take
[1:29:37] any money for himself to make sure that
[1:29:41] came to night in the rise up in him help
[1:29:45] me that was good
[1:29:47] he had to keep that Canaanite under his
[1:29:49] feet all the time so I'm not taking any
[1:29:50] money for myself any extra money my
[1:29:52] income I've given it to missionaries
[1:29:53] that's what he had to do to make sure so
[1:29:55] what I do try to bless those brothers or
[1:29:57] say such great things about them -
[1:29:59] brother - the souls over me his
[1:30:00] preaching is fantastic because I don't
[1:30:02] want that jealousy to come back up in my
[1:30:04] life I want to say evil about this
[1:30:06] preacher because he's got a bigger
[1:30:07] Church
[1:30:08] they have more Americans I don't I don't
[1:30:10] any jealousy to get in there I just want
[1:30:12] to be Jesse Smith who God made me I'll
[1:30:14] be happy for all God's children I'll be
[1:30:18] honest oh thank you I don't run with
[1:30:19] money or wind up very thankful for that
[1:30:21] does that be a heart that might be a
[1:30:22] harder battle I'm thankful for the
[1:30:25] battles that I do face because I know
[1:30:26] he's a call Korea okay last one
[1:30:29] complexes and it's very interesting like
[1:30:32] I said this is the seventh one and it's
[1:30:34] the last thing perhaps the last great
[1:30:36] battle brother Graham I'm struggling
[1:30:37] with interesting interesting okay let's
[1:30:41] go read second Corinthians 10 will read
[1:30:43] these and we'll stop by guys I just want
[1:30:45] to read ten and then we'll stop I'm not
[1:30:46] going to read Hebrews 12 that's the root
[1:30:48] of bitterness it's the same thing
[1:30:49] second Corinthians 10:3 - six again
[1:30:57] thank you for let me go over a little
[1:30:58] bit you've been such a great audience
[1:30:59] being such good attention here I
[1:31:01] appreciate that
[1:31:02] God god bless you richly amen I love to
[1:31:06] preach it I just want to see you happy
[1:31:07] with it I just want to see God was in it
[1:31:10] you know god bless somebody had this
[1:31:11] want to see God and I work - the sheep
[1:31:13] feed on the word of God you know I see a
[1:31:15] solid growth that's all I see there's
[1:31:17] just people love of God it's like are
[1:31:19] these ten three okay for though we walk
[1:31:24] in the flesh we do not war after the
[1:31:26] flesh so in other words we don't have to
[1:31:28] fight our own bodies right you don't
[1:31:29] beat up the Autobots for the weapons of
[1:31:31] our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[1:31:33] through God to the pulling down of
[1:31:36] strongholds that's an actual Bible
[1:31:40] so the word complex can the Bible word
[1:31:43] for that is stronghold or root of
[1:31:45] bitterness from what I can see my
[1:31:47] scripture because it's something that
[1:31:49] takes a great deep hold of some people
[1:31:51] remember of fusion sport 30 looks like
[1:31:55] 429 said neither give place to the devil
[1:31:57] so when someone gets a complex they give
[1:32:00] the devil place in their mind against I
[1:32:01] got this against brother Jesse I got
[1:32:03] this against brother Hannah I got this
[1:32:05] against brother brother vanie they've
[1:32:07] got they've given a place of their mind
[1:32:09] to the devil and it's it where's it at
[1:32:11] in the realm of imagination amen their
[1:32:14] imaginations been clogged up and so they
[1:32:17] imagine a well this person got something
[1:32:19] against me every time i preacher they
[1:32:21] look at me with this mean face you're
[1:32:22] not okay they got this imagination they
[1:32:27] let their imagination get clogged up by
[1:32:29] the devil look at verse 5 passing down
[1:32:31] what imagination so these complexes are
[1:32:33] in your realm of imagination brother
[1:32:35] Randall imagine that nobody was getting
[1:32:37] anything out of this preaching but yet
[1:32:38] the bride was but there are some little
[1:32:41] person in there believing it that
[1:32:43] eventually pass it down this you and I
[1:32:46] what's he say was boundless imagination
[1:32:48] all they're not good here yeah it's not
[1:32:50] even worth going there every Sunday it's
[1:32:52] not your the word preacher Wednesday on
[1:32:54] but safe was trying to discourage them
[1:32:56] there's discourage him
[1:32:58] but there was somebody if God sent you
[1:33:00] there be somebody to hear you and I'm a
[1:33:02] testimony of that God sent me here to be
[1:33:04] a pastor
[1:33:05] there's always been somebody for me to
[1:33:06] feed praise God along with myself
[1:33:08] because I need these services as well
[1:33:10] storm's my wife so does each one of us
[1:33:13] casting down imaginations every high
[1:33:16] thing that exalts itself against the
[1:33:17] knowledge of God and bringing the
[1:33:19] captivity every thought to the obedience
[1:33:22] of Christ so any thought that comes
[1:33:25] that's contrary to the word you got to
[1:33:27] make that a slave bind it up and then
[1:33:30] cast it down come true saying that
[1:33:32] anything so oh this person has something
[1:33:35] against me pass it down or if you really
[1:33:38] feel like that's true then go talk to
[1:33:39] the person if not you're letting the
[1:33:41] juggies nice defeat you and we don't
[1:33:44] we're not to be defeated no Devils to
[1:33:46] stand before us all the days of our life
[1:33:48] right no complex the love of money
[1:33:52] should stand before the
[1:33:53] Christ all the days of her life that's
[1:33:57] what nothing should stop us we should be
[1:33:58] an invincible army back you're right and
[1:34:00] this is how we good we cast out all
[1:34:03] these all these Reed's things and bring
[1:34:05] it to the Word of God and look at this
[1:34:10] verse 60 when you really cast something
[1:34:12] down you're ready the next time to do
[1:34:13] the right thing you're not ready you're
[1:34:16] not gonna fall to that thing again
[1:34:17] you're gonna do the right thing in other
[1:34:19] words you can't wait to fight that
[1:34:20] battle
[1:34:20] you're gonna cast that demon down praise
[1:34:23] God hallelujah first that's what verse 6
[1:34:26] says and having in a readiness to
[1:34:28] revenge all disobedience when your
[1:34:31] obedience is fulfilled
[1:34:32] praise God I bet when I first got saved
[1:34:36] by the atom he would come up and offer
[1:34:37] me chewing tobacco
[1:34:38] you know we used to go like this we spit
[1:34:40] like this to make this noise when I
[1:34:43] first got saved I was I was gonna wait
[1:34:46] for people to come up and do that to me
[1:34:47] hey you still chew it and I'd say no I
[1:34:49] got rid of that God delivered me for
[1:34:50] that I couldn't wait to have revenge
[1:34:53] against that spirit Jesse used to want
[1:34:56] to do this skin you look oh no sir God
[1:34:59] gave me victory over that how could I
[1:35:00] turn back to those demons I'm a victor
[1:35:02] praise God so see if we really have
[1:35:05] something doubt we got to be ready the
[1:35:08] next time to be defeated right that's a
[1:35:12] real repentance the next time I come
[1:35:13] across that TV show turn it down right
[1:35:16] for me the next time I come across that
[1:35:18] sports video don't watch it I'm ready to
[1:35:21] say oh this man this man that I used to
[1:35:23] be a good athlete he spilled the devil
[1:35:24] you know I don't have time to live said
[1:35:26] I'm gonna bring that in obedience to the
[1:35:28] Word of God right so in the morning
[1:35:30] what's up pops up about sports
[1:35:32] turn it down that's for me cast out that
[1:35:34] bless you love say men and love the Lord
[1:35:37] with all your hearts man down history
[1:35:39] okay that's closed by the grace of the
[1:35:40] Lord today now let the church I had a
[1:35:43] whole lot of quotes
[1:35:44] I had a whole lot of quotes there's a
[1:35:49] big long quote about taking the promised
[1:35:51] land I won the read that you get into
[1:35:54] the legal rights are so much more
[1:35:56] romances confessing your healing before
[1:35:59] it happens is actually pushing up it
[1:36:01] because it pushing up the hittites
[1:36:03] the Gibeonites
[1:36:06] that's part of the battle and we'll be
[1:36:08] able get in the warfare Wednesday night
[1:36:10] Lord willing by God's grace but he shows
[1:36:12] you how to get the victory and many
[1:36:14] times it's by speaking the word which
[1:36:15] we've been dealing with that a lot
[1:36:16] lately you know with overcoming fear
[1:36:18] speaking the word God's been showing me
[1:36:21] more on that and just you know bring it
[1:36:22] the past in my life you know so more
[1:36:26] more of those things giving examples
[1:36:29] about how we possess the land and how we
[1:36:32] have legal rights you know like the
[1:36:34] United States Army how we're supposed to
[1:36:35] be trained to fight like the US Army
[1:36:38] faith will act on the Word of God every
[1:36:40] time faith isn't passive you know if a
[1:36:42] the acts on the word of what I'm sorry
[1:36:44] what did I do forgive me
[1:36:46] this is yeah I wanted that remains that
[1:36:49] faith will act every time so another
[1:36:51] state that's ready to take that sword
[1:36:52] and kill that parasite right away it's
[1:36:55] ready to act it's ready to take it down
[1:36:56] when we're really filled with faith as
[1:36:59] you can see I got a whole lot more
[1:37:01] I can probably scroll oh I got a whole
[1:37:03] lotta I could appreciate it but I hope
[1:37:06] that was it helped to you know the lord
[1:37:08] bless you let's close the word prayer
[1:37:12] here I think we'll just close with that
[1:37:14] how many would say lord help me this
[1:37:16] week to cast out all my enemies
[1:37:17] how many would say that Heavenly Father
[1:37:21] we love you today Lord I preached myself
[1:37:26] tired and I feel good about that
[1:37:27] I've given up myself I poured out my
[1:37:30] soul as the Bible said David poured out
[1:37:33] his soul and Jesus poured out his soul
[1:37:35] unto death Lord I haven't done that but
[1:37:37] I poured out my heart Lord God to your
[1:37:40] people the people I love the people that
[1:37:43] you sent me to the people bored of this
[1:37:45] area lore that are to be overcomers in
[1:37:48] this land this natural man but Lord
[1:37:51] seeing that we have a spiritual land to
[1:37:53] take over father
[1:37:54] I poured out these these burdens all my
[1:37:58] heart these true the Lord and I pray you
[1:38:01] to give us a victory over these when the
[1:38:02] days ahead in the years ahead if you
