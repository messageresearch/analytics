[0:00] Psalm 118 verse 24. I'm just going to
[0:02] preach a general kind of like a uh kind
[0:04] of like a maybe like a what I call it
[0:08] just like a evangelical sermon. I guess
[0:10] I'll call that u like to just preach on
[0:12] this little thought. I had it this week.
[0:13] The value of a day. I just want to
[0:15] preach on this thought. The value of a
[0:17] day.
[0:19] As I've been reading through the book of
[0:20] Psalms, you know, of course, I'm getting
[0:21] through a lot of David's thoughts and um
[0:24] just really blessed by what I read and
[0:26] it just inspires me and uh strengthens
[0:28] me and uh I think you'd be blessed here
[0:30] today uh by God's grace. The value of a
[0:33] day. Psalm 118 verse 24.
[0:38] How many grateful to be in the house of
[0:40] the Lord today? Praise God. Hallelujah.
[0:42] Amen. So thankful to be in the house of
[0:44] the Lord.
[0:49] We'll just read that one verse uh by
[0:51] God's grace. Verse 24 if we can. Let's
[0:54] read that on three. One, two, three.
[0:56] This is the day which the Lord hath
[0:59] made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.
[1:02] May God add his blessing to the ring of
[1:04] his word. You may be seated.
[1:07] If you would just keep your Bibles
[1:08] handy. We're going to do a kind of like
[1:10] a just a maybe like a Bible study. We'll
[1:11] kind of see how uh the preaching goes.
[1:14] you know, last last week about preaching
[1:16] my voice out to, you know, there was
[1:18] such a poll uh for that subject there of
[1:22] overcoming iniquity by God's grace. Uh
[1:24] but today, I just like to look at this
[1:25] general thought of the value of a day.
[1:28] So, if you have your Bibles, we'll be
[1:30] turning uh lots of scripture here
[1:33] and just to give us maybe a fresh look
[1:34] at each and every day that God has given
[1:36] us. Uh we're starting with Genesis 1:3.
[1:41] Genesis 1:3.
[1:44] And God said, "Let there be light." And
[1:47] there was light. So this is a different
[1:49] kind of light. This was before the sun
[1:51] because the sun and moon were made on
[1:53] the fourth day. So this is a different
[1:55] kind of a light. We would say this was
[1:56] the eternal light. Praise God. The
[1:58] spirit of God becoming visible. We call
[2:00] it the logos.
[2:02] Uh the Bible said Jesus Christ was the
[2:04] beginning of the creation of God.
[2:06] Hallelujah. So uh this was the son of
[2:08] God in a visible form. Hallelujah. God
[2:11] becoming visible. And verse four, and
[2:14] God saw the light that it was good, and
[2:16] God divided the light from the darkness.
[2:20] So now God uh has light and darkness.
[2:24] And God called the light day, and the
[2:27] darkness he called night, and the
[2:29] evening and the morning were the first
[2:31] day. Hallelujah. So on the first day,
[2:34] God creates a day. Hallelujah. I just
[2:36] like this thought. God's the creator of
[2:38] the day and he's the creator of today as
[2:42] well. Hallelujah. Like we read Psalm
[2:44] 118:24, this is the day which the Lord
[2:46] hath made. So the Bible gives the same
[2:49] language. God has created this day as
[2:51] well. Hallelujah. And we will rejoice
[2:55] and be glad in it. Hallelujah.
[2:58] If you want to go to Ephesians uh
[2:59] chapter 1:3,
[3:02] you know, we read about the first day
[3:04] where God uh created the day and the
[3:07] light. I'm sorry, day and the night
[3:08] rather. But we know what God was doing
[3:11] before this. Praise God. Ephesians 1:3,
[3:13] "Blessed be the God and Father of our
[3:15] Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us
[3:17] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[3:20] places in Christ Jesus." No matter what
[3:23] spiritual blessing we need, church,
[3:25] we've already been blessed with it.
[3:26] Hallelujah. As we were talking this
[3:28] week, like God told Moses and Joshua,
[3:30] just every step you take, you'll take
[3:32] more land. Just step into every
[3:35] blessing. And that's what we do
[3:36] spiritually. We just step into every
[3:38] blessing. Hallelujah. because the it's
[3:40] already there available for us. We just
[3:42] have to step into it. We have to obey
[3:44] the word of God and God will bless us
[3:46] with all spiritual blessings.
[3:48] Hallelujah.
[3:50] All spiritual. So, we're not lacking
[3:52] anything today, right? Everything we
[3:54] have need of is here for us today.
[3:55] Praise God. Verse four, here's what one
[3:58] I want to look at. But according as he
[4:00] hath chosen us in him before the
[4:04] foundation of the world. Hallelujah.
[4:06] that we should be holy and without blame
[4:09] before him in love. Hallelujah. So we
[4:13] read about the first day where he made
[4:14] the day and the night and some somewhere
[4:17] in there sometime around that time
[4:19] before he made the the the earth even
[4:22] some sometime it was recognized that he
[4:24] chose us because we were chosen in the
[4:26] mind of God before the world was even
[4:29] founded. Now think about that. The world
[4:31] has an invisible foundation.
[4:34] You know, we put this uh they put this
[4:36] uh uh building on a foundation, right?
[4:38] They they got some solid ground and
[4:39] maybe they had to lay down some stones.
[4:41] Uh your house, they had to find the
[4:43] foundation first. They had to lay the
[4:44] foundation first. But God put up
[4:46] invisible foundations and he said, "I'm
[4:48] going to put the earth right there on
[4:50] these invisible foundations."
[4:52] Hallelujah. God's foundations are so
[4:54] powerful, you can't even see them.
[4:55] Praise God. They're not even visible to
[4:57] the human eye. But God has foundations
[5:00] and he placed the world on the
[5:02] foundations where we live. But before
[5:04] that, he already chose us. He already
[5:06] knew us before the foundation of the
[5:09] world. Hallelujah. Oh, it's such a
[5:11] blessing that we should be what? Holy.
[5:13] Holy means separated unto God. We should
[5:16] live a separated life unto God and
[5:17] without blame before him in love. So, we
[5:21] should serve God with love in our
[5:23] hearts. Hallelujah. And no blame. And
[5:25] the only way we could be blameless is to
[5:26] confess all of our sins. Amen.
[5:28] Hallelujah. Because we all know we sin
[5:30] every day or we fall short of God's
[5:32] glory. So we should live holy. We should
[5:34] live separate to God daily. Confess our
[5:37] sins living a life of God's love. Like
[5:41] Jesus said uh he pray he gave us the
[5:43] prayer pray that God forgive me of my
[5:45] sins and help me to forgive of all the
[5:47] people who s have sinned debts against
[5:49] me. Praise God. Amen. Verse five. having
[5:53] predestinated us unto the adoption of
[5:55] children by Jesus Christ to himself
[5:59] according to the good pleasure of his
[6:02] will. Hallelujah. So we were chosen in
[6:04] him and then predestined predetermined
[6:07] to be Christians. Hallelujah. Amen.
[6:10] Verse six. To the praise of the glory of
[6:13] his grace wherein he hath made us
[6:16] accepted in the beloved. So, we're
[6:18] created for his glory. And he's and he's
[6:21] already accepted us in heaven. We've
[6:23] already got an acceptable place in
[6:25] heaven. Hallelujah. Hell is not our
[6:28] home. Heaven is our home. Hallelujah.
[6:31] And that's just for a short time because
[6:32] then heaven comes down to earth.
[6:34] Hallelujah. And then we spend all
[6:36] eternity on the earth with the Lord.
[6:38] Hallelujah. Glory. Verse seven. In whom
[6:42] we have redemption through his blood. So
[6:44] he provided a way that he could buy us
[6:46] back and bring us back to the family of
[6:48] God. He sent his son to shed his blood.
[6:51] And now that blood has bought us back
[6:54] into the family of God. Our sins
[6:56] separated us from the family of God. But
[6:58] the blood of Jesus Christ brought us
[7:00] back into the family of God. And he's
[7:03] given us glory. The forgiveness of sins
[7:06] in verse seven, according to the riches
[7:08] of his grace. God is rich in mercy.
[7:11] Hallelujah. He's plenteous in uh loving
[7:14] kindness. The Bible said the multitude
[7:16] of his tender mercies. Hallelujah.
[7:19] He's rich in love.
[7:21] Verse eight, wherein he hath abounded
[7:23] toward us in all wisdom and providence.
[7:25] Abounded means he's uh been been
[7:27] fruitful. God has abounded toward us.
[7:30] God has basically given us so many
[7:32] blessings. They're just coming to us.
[7:34] Praise God. They're abounding to us.
[7:36] Hallelujah. It's God who gave you life.
[7:39] It's God who saved you. God gave you
[7:41] that job. God gave you that spouse as we
[7:43] saw today. God gives those children.
[7:45] He's abounding to us. Hallelujah. It's
[7:48] his love expressed to us. Amen.
[7:51] It's abounding to us. Praise God. Glory.
[7:55] And then we see it uh in verse 9. Having
[7:57] made known unto us the mystery of his
[7:59] will. We know God's will. It's for us to
[8:02] be holy. Praise God. It's for us to be a
[8:05] separated people to live to his glory.
[8:08] Hallelujah. Amen. And of course, we can
[8:10] even tie in the mysteries of the Bible.
[8:12] Uh as Revelation 10:7, in the days of
[8:15] the seventh angel, when his when he he
[8:17] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[8:20] will be finished. Praise God. As he hath
[8:22] declared unto his servants the prophets,
[8:24] God has made known to us the mystery of
[8:26] the rapture, the mystery of marriage and
[8:29] divorce, the mystery of the Godhead.
[8:32] Hallelujah. The mystery of the Jew and
[8:34] Gentile church as one bride. Hallelujah.
[8:37] God has made known all these mysteries.
[8:39] We know his will for our lives. And so
[8:41] God, help us to walk in it. Praise God.
[8:44] Amen.
[8:46] He did all this. All this is abounding
[8:49] to us out of the heart of God, the love
[8:51] of God. Verse nine, according to his
[8:53] good pleasure, which he has purpose in
[8:56] himself. God had a pleasure that's in
[8:59] himself that's abounding to us that in
[9:02] the dispensation of the fullness of time
[9:04] he might gather together all I'm sorry
[9:07] in one all things in Christ both which
[9:10] are in heaven and which are in earth
[9:12] even in him. This speaks of the
[9:14] millennium how all the nations are going
[9:16] to be gathered. All nations have to go
[9:18] up to Jerusalem to worship Jesus. It
[9:21] also speaks of the future home where
[9:22] there's no more unbelievers. There's no
[9:24] more devil. Hallelujah. There's one
[9:27] eternal city and the bride lives in the
[9:29] city. Hallelujah. The new Jerusalem. And
[9:31] then all the kings of the earth come
[9:32] into the city and they bring their glory
[9:34] and honor into that holy city.
[9:36] Hallelujah. Amen. He's gathering
[9:39] everything in Christ. Hallelujah. So God
[9:42] help us. Let our lives be gathered into
[9:44] the word. Hallelujah. Christ the word.
[9:47] Hallelujah. Amen. My it's after the
[9:50] council of his own will. Uh we saw in
[9:53] verse I want I want I don't want to skip
[9:55] verse 11. Sorry. In whom also we have
[9:57] obtained an inheritance. You know that
[9:59] church, your parents might not be able
[10:01] to give you inheritance here, but you've
[10:02] got one over there.
[10:05] Some more than others might get I know
[10:07] I'm getting nothing here, which that
[10:09] that's okay. I love my parents, but
[10:12] that's okay. It's just one less thing I
[10:14] got to worry about.
[10:16] I don't got to fret about that. Don't
[10:17] have to think about that. But I do have
[10:19] an eternal inheritance from my heavenly
[10:22] father. Hallelujah. I've got eternal
[10:24] life. Hallelujah. Amen. And all the
[10:27] things that God has mysteriously waiting
[10:29] for us in eternity. Praise God. Amen.
[10:33] Thank God we got an inheritance.
[10:35] Hallelujah.
[10:36] Because we're predestinated. Verse 11.
[10:39] According to the purpose of him who
[10:41] works all things, let's say all things.
[10:42] Ready? All things after the counsel of
[10:45] his own will. Everything in your life
[10:47] was after God's counsel.
[10:50] Even your mistakes, God knew about that.
[10:53] That's right. And then all your
[10:54] obedience, God knew about that, too.
[10:57] God's God's written the story of your
[11:00] life. So, we ought to accept it. Praise
[11:02] God. We ought to forget the past and
[11:04] think about what about today? What's the
[11:06] value of this day? Hallelujah. Amen.
[11:10] Because it's all after the council of
[11:12] his will. He knew you'd be here today
[11:15] hearing the sermon, worshiping God,
[11:17] giving God glory and praise. So let's
[11:19] let's let's recognize what he has for us
[11:22] today. Hallelujah. Verse 12. That we
[11:25] should be to the praise of his glory.
[11:28] Who first trusted in Christ in whom ye
[11:30] also trusted. After that you heard the
[11:33] word of truth, the gospel of your
[11:35] salvation, the good news of your
[11:37] salvation. In whom also after that ye
[11:40] believed, ye were sealed with that holy
[11:42] spirit of promise. Hallelujah. So see
[11:45] all this inheritance, all this
[11:47] predestination, we came to the knowledge
[11:49] of it because we believe the word and
[11:52] after we believed then we were filled
[11:54] with the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[11:56] Hallelujah. Verse 14, which is the
[11:58] earnest or the down payment. This Holy
[12:01] Ghost is just the beginning. There's so
[12:04] much more waiting for us. Amen. It's the
[12:07] earnest of our inheritance until the
[12:10] redemption of the purchased possession
[12:12] unto the praise of his glory. If it
[12:15] feels this good to be forgiven, what is
[12:17] it going to feel like to never sin
[12:19] again? Hallelujah.
[12:21] It feel if it feels this good to be used
[12:23] by God and speak the word of God and see
[12:26] the power of God move in your life. If
[12:28] it feels this good, what's it going to
[12:29] feel like when there's no barriers,
[12:31] there's no sin, there's no devil,
[12:33] there's no temptation. This is just the
[12:35] earnest. This is just the beginning.
[12:38] Hallelujah.
[12:40] What's it going to feel like when we
[12:41] have all that God wants to give us?
[12:43] Right now, we just have an earnest. We
[12:46] have a little down payment. Oh, but
[12:48] there's so much more waiting for us.
[12:52] Oh my.
[12:54] Praise God.
[12:57] I want to look at our the duty of each
[13:00] day. So, here's where I kind of got my
[13:01] thought for this sermon.
[13:05] There's so much that we should uh
[13:07] recognize each day.
[13:09] Hallelujah.
[13:11] Let's start with uh uh Matthew 6:33.
[13:16] I forgot to write one verse down, so let
[13:18] me look this one up. I believe it's
[13:21] okay. Yeah, there is. Okay. Forgot to
[13:24] write one verse down. Matthew 6:33. But
[13:28] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[13:30] righteousness, and all these things
[13:33] shall be added unto you. God gives us a
[13:36] promise. If we just seek the will of God
[13:38] that we read about, he's made known the
[13:40] mystery of his will. If we just seek
[13:42] that will, he promised, I'll give you
[13:44] everything you need. Hallelujah. Now,
[13:47] the one I had to look up was Luke 9 uh
[13:49] 23. This is the one I forgot to write
[13:51] down the verse.
[13:55] And I want you to notice these words
[13:57] here, the day or the daily or all the
[14:00] days. I want you to notice the wording
[14:02] behind these. So, we're supposed to seek
[14:04] God first.
[14:06] And Luke uh 9:24 says, "And he said to
[14:08] them, if any man will come after me, let
[14:10] him deny himself, take up his cross
[14:13] daily and follow me."
[14:16] So, every day, so God made this day
[14:18] where to rejoice and be glad in it. But
[14:20] the only way we're going to be glad and
[14:21] rejoice is if we die to our sinful
[14:24] desires.
[14:26] It's a daily choice. I'm going to take
[14:28] up this cross uh which is a a a death.
[14:31] It's a slow death. I'm going to go
[14:33] through this day with a slow death. I'm
[14:34] going to take up the burden. Hallelujah.
[14:37] Amen. Of crucifying my own desires.
[14:39] Hallelujah. I'm going to seek God first
[14:41] and then he's going to give me
[14:42] everything I need for this day. Praise
[14:44] God. Hallelujah.
[14:47] What a blessing.
[14:49] Uh let's look at uh Matthew 6:11. uh the
[14:52] prayer the the motto prayer of the Lord
[14:55] Jesus.
[14:57] He says, "Give us this day our daily
[15:00] bread." So, we're to pray for natural
[15:03] food. And I was praying the other
[15:04] morning, I'm like, "God, I don't even
[15:05] have to pray for this. We're so blessed.
[15:08] If the grocery store is closed tomorrow,
[15:10] I can make it for a couple of weeks, I
[15:12] think, with all the food I got in my
[15:13] house. We don't even really have to pray
[15:15] for daily bread." So, I said, "God, how
[15:17] great you are. How kind you are." Amen.
[15:20] So God, help me to use this spiritually.
[15:22] Help me to pray for daily spiritual
[15:24] bread. Amen. Hallelujah. But we're told
[15:28] to pray every day for bread. And look
[15:31] how look how good God has been to us.
[15:33] Hallelujah. Amen. Let's go to uh
[15:37] Lamentations 3:22. Very familiar uh
[15:41] scripture here. And Lamentations 3:22
[15:44] and 23.
[15:48] It is of the Lord's mercies that we are
[15:50] not consumed because his compassions
[15:53] fail not. So God has such a compassion
[15:57] on us. It'll never fail. He'll never run
[15:59] out of compassion on us. And that's the
[16:02] Jews. What about us? We're we're
[16:03] beloved. The Bible says that Romans
[16:05] 9:25. We're beloved. God has made us the
[16:08] beloved bride.
[16:11] They are new every morning. Great is thy
[16:14] faithfulness. So the compassions of God
[16:17] are going to feel new every day. You
[16:20] should feel happy when the sun comes up
[16:21] every day, right? It's just it's a
[16:23] visible physical sign of wow, it's it's
[16:26] going to be a wonderful day. I feel
[16:27] strength in that sun. That's just a
[16:29] physical expression of what God does
[16:32] spiritually for us.
[16:35] Like right, I went to bed last night
[16:36] kind of worried about the bombings, but
[16:37] I woke up. I didn't even think about it.
[16:39] I thought about the love of God. Oh, God
[16:41] gave me a new day. Now, we should pray
[16:44] for that. We should pray for the people
[16:45] impacted by these things. But but the
[16:48] fact is I woke up today and I was like,
[16:50] "Wow, God gave me another day." Praise
[16:52] God. I have new mercy. I have new
[16:55] compassion. God's faithfulness is new
[16:58] today. Hallelujah. Amen. It doesn't wear
[17:01] out, church. Hallelujah. Amen.
[17:04] And then we remember uh 2 Corinthians
[17:07] 4:16. So we have a responsibility with
[17:09] our minds uh to let this sunlight,
[17:13] right? the natural sunlight that shines
[17:14] in this room. Let that be a reminder.
[17:17] I've also got to have fresh anointing on
[17:19] my mind. I need a renewed mind. Just
[17:22] like the earth gets renewed sunshine.
[17:25] 2 Corinthians 4:16. For which cause we
[17:28] faint not. But though our outward man
[17:30] perish, yet the inward man is renewed
[17:33] day by day. So you got to take up a
[17:36] cross every day. You got to renew your
[17:39] mind every day and and pray for God's
[17:42] provision every single day. Praise God.
[17:44] That's the value. Now, we'll get the
[17:46] value out of each day if we do what God
[17:49] says. Hallelujah. Amen. But we have to
[17:51] obey what God says for every day.
[17:54] Hallelujah.
[17:56] I like uh let's go to Psalm 73
[18:00] 23.
[18:02] Psalm 73:23.
[18:10] This was one of the chapters I read this
[18:12] week that was uh really wonderful and I
[18:14] I think I preached it a few weeks ago on
[18:16] some of these scriptures here.
[18:22] You know, we can see how Fanny Crosby
[18:24] got some of the lyrics to her song here,
[18:25] Pass Me Not. Uh let's go to verse 23.
[18:28] Nevertheless, I'm continually with thee.
[18:30] Thou holding me by my right hand. Now, I
[18:35] like that
[18:36] uh the the the writer here, it's not
[18:38] David, it's Asaf. Asaf says, "Throughout
[18:41] the day, I'm continually with God all
[18:43] day." All day. Hallelujah.
[18:47] And then he says, "You're holding me up
[18:49] by your right hand." Right? Your
[18:51] strength. And I like verse 24. Thou
[18:54] shalt guide me with thy counsel and
[18:56] afterward receive me to glory. I love
[19:00] this. God's going to guide me while I'm
[19:02] here. He's going to guide me each step
[19:04] of the way and then he's going to
[19:05] receive me up into heaven. It's kind of
[19:08] like he's guiding me. Uh he's guiding me
[19:10] to himself and then he just pulls me
[19:12] right up. It's like he's walking along
[19:14] with me all throughout the day. You
[19:15] know, Jesse, you need to pray about
[19:16] this. Jesse, you need to go do that.
[19:18] It's like he's guiding me. Come, don't
[19:20] go that way. Go this way. I'm guiding
[19:23] you this way. And then it's like he just
[19:25] takes he said come up higher. One of
[19:26] these days he's going to call me up and
[19:28] receive me up to glory. Hallelujah.
[19:31] Oh, what more can we ask for?
[19:32] Hallelujah. Constant provision, new
[19:34] mercies, compassions that fail not,
[19:37] continual guidance. Hallelujah. And then
[19:40] he promises he'll receive us.
[19:42] Hallelujah.
[19:44] These these promises are so wonderful.
[19:47] Verse 25,
[19:49] whom have I in heaven but thee?
[19:53] And there is none upon the earth that I
[19:55] desire beside the Lord. Amen.
[19:59] My flesh and my heart faileth, but God
[20:01] is the strength of my heart and my
[20:03] portion forever.
[20:06] Hallelujah. See, that's where Fanny
[20:07] Crosby got that. Whom have I in heaven
[20:09] but uh but thee? I think she said, "Who
[20:13] have I on earth beside thee? Whom in
[20:15] heaven but thee? Savior, Savior, hear my
[20:18] humble cry. While in others thou art
[20:20] calling, do not pass me by." See where
[20:23] she gets the inspiration? Hallelujah.
[20:27] Now, stay there in Psalm 23. I'm sorry,
[20:30] Psalm 73. My bad. Psalm 73.
[20:35] Because I want you to see that we're
[20:36] supposed to start our day with God and
[20:39] then continually stay with him and take
[20:40] up our cross and confess our sins, renew
[20:43] our minds. But some days are going to be
[20:45] harder than others.
[20:47] Let's stay in Psalm 73. Let's see what
[20:50] kind of day Asaf was having here. Now
[20:52] notice, God anointed him to write the
[20:55] Bible, part of the Bible.
[20:57] He was anoint, think about that. He was
[20:59] anointed by God Almighty to write a song
[21:01] that God wanted the rest of the Let's
[21:03] see, it's been u it's been 3,000 years
[21:05] since he wrote that. For the next 3,000
[21:07] years, we would listen to this song and
[21:10] we would get something from the song.
[21:11] Let's see what kind of day this Holy
[21:12] Ghost, we say Holy Ghost believer was
[21:14] having.
[21:16] Verse one, truly God is good to Israel,
[21:18] even to such as are of a clean heart.
[21:21] But as for me, my feet were almost gone.
[21:23] My steps had well nice slipped. He's
[21:26] like, I'm almost gone. I thought about
[21:28] preaching a sermon titled almost gone.
[21:31] You ever felt like that? Some days
[21:33] you're so close to God, but some days I
[21:34] feel like I'm almost gone. That's how
[21:37] Asaf was feeling when he wrote this
[21:39] song. Praise God.
[21:41] Ever felt that way? I'm just one step
[21:43] away from falling off falling off the
[21:45] earth or my one step away from falling
[21:48] away. He'd almost slipped.
[21:52] Now, why why was he almost uh he almost
[21:56] gone from the faith? Because he got his
[21:59] eyes on sinners.
[22:02] Look at verse three. For I was envious
[22:04] at the foolish when I saw the prosperity
[22:07] of the wicked. So here we see like the
[22:11] Bible says, godliness with contentment
[22:13] is great gain.
[22:16] So the days he almost fell away, I'm
[22:18] almost gone. I don't even know if I can
[22:20] make it to church. I don't even know if
[22:21] I can serve God. Those days often happen
[22:23] because we get our eyes off the word and
[22:25] we start looking at the things of the
[22:27] world.
[22:29] But man, they got it really good and
[22:30] they don't even serve God. They don't
[22:32] got it good.
[22:34] They got hell waiting for them if they
[22:36] don't repent. Hallelujah.
[22:40] But this is how his day started out. I'm
[22:42] almost gone.
[22:45] Now, you don't have to say amen. You
[22:46] don't have to raise your hand, but
[22:47] sometimes we've been there.
[22:52] Now, look, he goes through these
[22:53] sinners. He looks at all that they have.
[22:57] Go down to verse 12. Behold, these are
[22:59] ungodly who prosper in the world. They
[23:01] increase in riches. I'm not getting more
[23:03] money, but they're getting more money.
[23:06] I'm serving God and I'm getting poor.
[23:09] They're serving the devil. They're
[23:10] getting richer. ASAP's like, "I can't
[23:13] figure this out. I got to write a song
[23:14] about this.
[23:17] Hallelujah.
[23:21] And look, he even starts kind of
[23:23] regretting. Wow, I'm regretting serving
[23:25] Jehovah. Look at verse 13. Verily, I've
[23:27] cleansed my heart in vain and washed my
[23:30] hands in innocent. Now, what's the
[23:31] equivalent of that? It's like saying,
[23:32] well, I maybe I shouldn't even got
[23:35] baptized,
[23:36] right? I've washed maybe why did I why
[23:39] did I even stop that? Why why did I even
[23:41] get victory? Why? Why do I even enjoy
[23:42] that deliverance from that addiction?
[23:45] He's like in it's like in vain I've
[23:46] washed my hands. He got so envious of
[23:50] the sinners.
[23:52] He's like, I almost fell off the the
[23:53] boat. I almost fell off the Christian
[23:55] boat, the gospel ship.
[23:58] I almost fell off and lost my testimony
[24:00] because I spend too much time looking at
[24:02] the sinners.
[24:04] You got to spend your time looking at
[24:05] the Hall of Fame of faith, church.
[24:07] Hallelujah. The saints that are in
[24:09] heaven. Praise God.
[24:12] Now look at this verse 14
[24:15] here. Here's where I want to get to. For
[24:16] all the day long have I been plagued.
[24:18] He's serving God, but he's going through
[24:20] plagues.
[24:23] Then because of his trial, sound a lot
[24:25] like Job, doesn't it? Because of all of
[24:27] his plagues and all of his trials he
[24:29] going through. He gets his eyes off the
[24:30] word. He starts looking at everybody
[24:32] else and so blessed. Man, I'm just
[24:33] plagued all day. And was it in vain I
[24:36] got baptized? Was it in vain? I'm
[24:37] serving the Lord. I'm about fall off.
[24:40] I'm almost gone.
[24:44] And this is a song in God's holy word.
[24:46] You know why? Because God knew you'd
[24:47] relate to it.
[24:51] So the value of a day in this day. He's
[24:54] all envious, right? He's envious. He's
[24:57] been plagued all day. All day.
[25:00] Not for the first 10 minutes of the day,
[25:03] but all day.
[25:06] And he's chasing every morning. So, he's
[25:09] gotten to this season of life where
[25:12] every morning he gets chasened. He gets
[25:15] corrected. He gets rebuked. Every
[25:17] morning he's plagued all day.
[25:20] Seems like there's no good days in the
[25:23] church. He can't remember when was the
[25:26] last time I had a good day.
[25:29] And the the days get so long and hard,
[25:32] he starts envying the sinners. Right.
[25:38] My
[25:39] Verse 15, if I say I will speak thus,
[25:42] behold, I should offend against the
[25:43] generation of thy children. When I
[25:45] thought to know this, it was too painful
[25:47] for me.
[25:49] So he started looking at the generation
[25:51] of the wicked and and all that they all
[25:53] the benefits. And then he thinks about
[25:54] his generation. If boy, if I'm like pe
[25:57] plague like this, what's going to be the
[25:58] next generation like? And he's like,
[26:00] it's almost too painful me for me to go
[26:01] on.
[26:03] Now, you know that because we preached
[26:05] on this recently, you know the next
[26:06] verse. Finally, in verse 17, there's a
[26:08] change of heart.
[26:11] Until, so I was about ready to leave. I
[26:13] was about gone. Until I went into the
[26:15] sanctuary of God, then I understood
[26:19] their end.
[26:22] So, see, he got away. He got his eyes
[26:24] off the word and he got away from
[26:26] church.
[26:28] He got his eyes on his problems and all
[26:31] the situations and all the plagues he
[26:33] was going through, all the
[26:34] discouragement. He got his eyes off of
[26:36] that. But everything changed when he
[26:38] went to the house of God.
[26:40] Oh, thank God for the house of God.
[26:42] Hallelujah.
[26:44] Surely thou did set them in slippery
[26:46] places. Thou cast them down into
[26:48] destruction.
[26:50] How are they brought into desolation as
[26:52] in a moment they're utterly consumed
[26:54] with tears. So God showed him that there
[26:56] was people throughout in the Bible in
[26:59] the past that they were looking good,
[27:01] but all of a sudden everything changed.
[27:04] I think the easiest example is Pharaoh.
[27:07] Pharaoh's like, "Who are you to call on
[27:09] God?" Right? Moses comes in there and
[27:10] said, "The I am says this." He said,
[27:11] "Who am who is the I am? Look at me. I'm
[27:14] the I am." Right? He boasts himself
[27:18] against God. And looks like he would he
[27:20] would benefit. You know, Pharaoh would
[27:22] get greater and greater and greater
[27:23] until Moses started speaking the word.
[27:27] Amen. Sorry to clap so loud. Sorry. Uh
[27:30] Moses started speaking the word and then
[27:33] everything started changing suddenly for
[27:35] Pharaoh.
[27:38] Then there was one plague after another
[27:40] sudden destruction until he lost his
[27:43] first born.
[27:45] See, Ahab had to remember, well, wow,
[27:48] they're only benefiting for a little
[27:50] time. But look at their end and look at
[27:52] his end. It's likely that he was leading
[27:55] his army into the Red Sea. And it's
[27:58] likely that his end was sudden
[28:00] destruction, drowning alive, become fish
[28:03] food. All right, that's a little help.
[28:06] It's helpful for the children to
[28:07] understand. This man who defied God
[28:10] became fish food suddenly. So there's no
[28:12] reason to envy him.
[28:15] Hallelujah. We shouldn't envy sinners.
[28:18] We should remember their end. What are
[28:20] they going to turn out to be? And what
[28:22] are we going to turn out to be? We're
[28:23] going to turn out to be adopted children
[28:25] of the most high God with the eternal
[28:28] inheritance. Hallelujah. That's what
[28:30] we're going to be. Praise God.
[28:34] And then in verse 22, Asaf says, "So
[28:36] foolish was I and ignorant I was as a
[28:38] beast before God." See, it's so foolish
[28:41] to regret being a Christian. It's so
[28:44] foolish to regret when you were baptized
[28:47] or when you went to church or took a
[28:48] stand or you sacrificed for that that
[28:51] for God. It's a good thing you sacrifice
[28:53] for God. It's foolish to regret anything
[28:56] you've done for God. Hallelujah.
[28:59] He said, "I was so foolish to think I'd
[29:00] almost fallen away and I should envy
[29:02] sinners. I was so foolish to look at
[29:04] natural things. I need to look at
[29:06] spiritual things." Praise God. The value
[29:09] of one day.
[29:12] So by the end of this day, we already
[29:13] read it. He said, "I know God's
[29:15] continually with me
[29:18] and he'll guide me. He will guide me
[29:21] with his counsel and he'll receive me to
[29:23] heaven. Pharaoh won't get that
[29:25] reception. He said, "But I'll get that
[29:27] reception."
[29:28] Hallelujah.
[29:31] So, what a turnaround, church. What a
[29:32] turnaround it can be to go to the house
[29:34] of God, hear the word of God, and have
[29:37] your mind. There it is. His mind was
[29:38] renewed in the house of God. Hallelujah.
[29:41] Glory.
[29:43] Oh, we can see it plainly. He'd almost
[29:46] slipped, almost gone. But who held him
[29:48] up? God held him up. How did God save
[29:51] him? Through the preaching at church.
[29:54] Amen. We've all had it, right? Where
[29:56] some we needed a sermon at just the
[29:58] right time and God sent it to us.
[30:00] Hallelujah.
[30:02] Helped us to get through the trial we
[30:04] were going through.
[30:06] Yeah. Some days you're killed all the
[30:07] day long. Romans 8:36. You want to pull
[30:10] it up there? And this is the same
[30:12] chapter, church. This is the same
[30:14] chapter that starts off, you have no
[30:16] condemnation because you're in Christ
[30:17] Jesus.
[30:18] And nothing can separate you from the
[30:20] love of God. In the same chapter, if God
[30:22] be before you, who be against you? In
[30:24] the same chapter, sometimes it seems
[30:26] we're killed all the day long. Praise
[30:28] God.
[30:30] Just like Asa. In other words, you're
[30:32] tested. You're tested all day long.
[30:36] So you can have real Christlike
[30:38] character
[30:41] because character is not formed through
[30:43] blessing, blessing, blessing. Character
[30:45] is formed through suffering. Amen.
[30:49] As it is written, for thy sake, we are
[30:51] killed all the day long, we are counted
[30:54] as sheep for slaughter. But then, how
[30:56] does the book end? How does the chapter
[30:57] end? There's nothing that will separate
[31:00] us from the love of God, which in Christ
[31:02] Jesus. Hallelujah.
[31:05] Amen. Look at Psalm 86:3, honey. Pull
[31:08] that up there. If you want to read in
[31:08] your Bible, you can.
[31:12] Psalm 86:3.
[31:15] Be merciful unto me, oh God, for I cry
[31:18] unto thee daily. Now, God didn't stop
[31:21] his crying every day. God didn't say,
[31:23] "Well, one day is enough crying, then I
[31:25] I'll stop your crying." No, God let him
[31:27] cry day after day after day after day.
[31:32] You still crying today, Brother Jesse.
[31:33] Yes. This is so hard. You know, think
[31:35] about you. Put yourself in there. You're
[31:36] still crying, Malachi. You're still
[31:37] crying, Sister Beatatric. God let it do
[31:40] it day after day after day to teach us
[31:43] to call on God to trust in God to think
[31:46] about the end of life. Hallelujah. Amen.
[31:49] Don't just think about the present.
[31:51] Think about what's my end going to be.
[31:53] Praise God.
[31:55] My end's going to be is that he's
[31:57] guiding me through this. And then my end
[31:59] is going to be he's going to receive me
[32:01] up into glory. Amen. He's with me in my
[32:04] tears. He's with me in my plagues. He's
[32:06] with me in my tests. and he's going to
[32:08] guide me through them and then receive
[32:10] me up into heaven. Praise God.
[32:13] So some days are battles all day long,
[32:17] crying all day long, discouraged all day
[32:20] long, chasened all day long, plagued all
[32:24] day long. But there's value in that day.
[32:28] There's great value in that because you
[32:31] see it's God guiding you through that
[32:33] season or that test of your life. He
[32:36] said, "I'm" He said, "I am continually
[32:38] with you every day."
[32:42] I want you to see what Brother said
[32:43] about Moses. Now, Moses was 40 years
[32:46] old, church. Remember this. He's 40
[32:48] years old when he tries to save Israel.
[32:51] And all he gets is the all he gets is
[32:53] the government after him trying to
[32:55] arrest him. He becomes a murderer. When
[32:57] you try to do something on your own
[32:58] power, you're always a failure. You have
[33:01] to wait for the plan of God. You got to
[33:03] wait for the power of God. Amen.
[33:05] Hallelujah. Amen. So Moses tries to do
[33:08] it on his own. Alls he gets is a dead
[33:10] stinking Egyptian buried in the sand.
[33:11] That's all he gets.
[33:14] Right? And then we know what happens for
[33:16] the next 40 years. He goes out. He gets
[33:18] a wonderful wife. Right. Zapora. They're
[33:21] perfect for each other, hightempered,
[33:23] and they're both highteered. And that
[33:25] through that makes him the meakest man
[33:26] on earth.
[33:28] Right? She said, "You are a bloody
[33:30] husband to me, Moses."
[33:32] Right? I'm sure he was like that too,
[33:33] right? cuz he killed a man. I mean, he's
[33:36] a murderer.
[33:38] How would you like that, sisters? Marry
[33:39] a murderer. How'd you like that? That's
[33:41] what Zapora got.
[33:44] My goodness. But 40 years he's out there
[33:48] in the wilderness just taking care of
[33:50] sheep.
[33:53] 40 years he's like, "I'm a murderer.
[33:55] How's God going to use me? My mom and
[33:57] dad and these people told me there's a
[33:59] there's a call on my life. I was a
[34:01] special child for some reason. And a
[34:03] special child's a murderer. Ah, church,
[34:06] don't look at the present. Look at the
[34:07] future. Praise God. God's not done with
[34:10] you. Don't Don't let the devil bring up
[34:12] your past. Look to the future.
[34:13] Hallelujah.
[34:15] Amen. He couldn't focus. But for 40
[34:18] years, he went through all this
[34:20] suffering.
[34:22] You know what brother said? He was a
[34:25] coward dying a thousand deaths. That's
[34:28] what that's an exact quote.
[34:31] So he read it for 40 years. Brother
[34:33] Mercy, he's got to walk around be like,
[34:35] "I'm a coward. I ran away from the
[34:36] people of God. I've left the church for
[34:39] 40 years
[34:42] and he's dying a thousand deaths, which
[34:44] means he just wish it could be over
[34:45] every day. I just wish it was over. Why
[34:48] I got to go?" He had he's got two boys.
[34:49] He's got a nice family, you know. He's
[34:50] got married. He's got a nice uh flock.
[34:53] He's like, "For 40 years my I'm dying a
[34:56] thousand deaths. I'm a I'm a coward. Oh,
[34:59] I just wish my w life would have been
[35:01] different. And church, it was about to
[35:02] get different. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[35:05] But for 40 years, God let him sweat it
[35:08] out. God let him go through the
[35:10] discouragement. Uh it's like a 40-year
[35:13] coward complex he went through. But God
[35:17] was never done with him. God never took
[35:19] his hand on him. In fact, God was
[35:21] guiding him all the way along. And one
[35:24] day, God guided him out to a burning
[35:26] bush. Hallelujah. And the pres brother
[35:29] said in five minutes in the presence of
[35:32] the burning bush he knew more about God
[35:35] than the past 80 years of his life.
[35:37] Hallelujah.
[35:39] Amen. One day took away 80 years of
[35:42] disappointment. The value of one day.
[35:45] And then brother said he was invincible.
[35:47] He didn't fear any army. He didn't fear
[35:49] Pharaoh. He didn't fear any man. Because
[35:51] he spent five minutes this one day. He
[35:54] got five minutes in the presence of God
[35:56] and he was changed and now he's more
[35:58] than a conqueror in Christ Jesus. Amen.
[36:02] The power of one day. So church, you
[36:05] wait till that day you get your power.
[36:06] Praise God. That's the baptism of the
[36:08] Holy Ghost. Wait till you get that
[36:11] power. Then you're set into service.
[36:13] Praise God.
[36:15] Amen.
[36:17] Brother Ram said he was a coward dying a
[36:20] thousand deaths. And after meeting God,
[36:22] he wished he had a thousand lives to die
[36:25] for Christ.
[36:27] That's why he didn't mind going down
[36:29] there to Egypt. He didn't care if he
[36:30] died. He met somebody greater than
[36:32] Pharaoh.
[36:34] You and I, we met somebody better than
[36:35] our boss or better than the preacher. We
[36:37] met somebody greater than them. His name
[36:39] is Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[36:42] So, we're not afraid to die. We're not
[36:44] afraid of the future because we've
[36:45] already met him. We know who he is. We
[36:47] know he's guiding us continually. and we
[36:49] know he'll receive us.
[36:52] Glory.
[36:55] Brother Ram said he was ready to go.
[36:58] There was nothing could stop him. Though
[37:00] he had no army, though his education was
[37:03] no good to him, he couldn't fight. He
[37:05] had no swords. He didn't have any
[37:07] warriors, any chairs to back him up as
[37:10] for the world knew. But he'd come face
[37:12] to face with God with an experience who
[37:15] had the armored angels of all eternities
[37:18] to stand by him. Did you see that?
[37:21] Brother Ram said he didn't have any
[37:22] chariots you could see. But he had
[37:25] chariots of angels all around him. He's
[37:28] walking into Egypt with his family and
[37:30] he's got chariots of fire. Angels
[37:32] backing him up. That's what I call an
[37:34] invasion. Hallelujah.
[37:36] Angels invading Egypt behind one man.
[37:40] Praise God. Who had an experience with
[37:42] God.
[37:45] Talk about battling all the day long. He
[37:46] battled all day long for 40 years.
[37:49] Coward
[37:51] dying a thousand deaths. I wish I could
[37:53] do it all over. My life's been a waste.
[37:55] I wish I could just end this. And all of
[37:57] a sudden, God changed it. I said, "I
[37:59] can't wait for the next 40 years of my
[38:00] life." Amen. I get to serve God.
[38:03] Hallelujah.
[38:05] I die a thousand deaths for Jesus
[38:07] Christ.
[38:09] Oh my
[38:12] church, it's suffering that produces the
[38:15] Moses kind of a character. Those 40
[38:18] years of sufferings change him into the
[38:20] meakest man on earth. He's got to be
[38:23] meek because he knows I'm a murderer.
[38:25] I'm a failure. I abandoned the people
[38:26] for 40 years. Who am I? But now God can
[38:30] use me because I've surrendered.
[38:33] I've moved past my past. Did you catch
[38:36] that? You have to move past your past.
[38:40] Forget about it. Move on with God. Walk
[38:43] continually with God. Let God guide your
[38:46] future. Don't let your past determine
[38:48] your future.
[38:53] Romans 5:3. And not only so, but we
[38:56] glory in tribulation also. So Moses
[38:59] learned to glory that he was 40 years in
[39:01] the wilderness.
[39:02] I needed that time.
[39:05] Hallelujah. I needed to suffer during
[39:06] that time to realize that I'm nothing.
[39:09] Brother man said uh uh Pharaoh uh and
[39:12] Egypt pumped 40 years of education into
[39:14] him, right? So God needed 40 years to
[39:16] beat it out of him.
[39:19] Oh, I love that. Amen.
[39:21] 40 years of human education. Takes 40
[39:24] years to beat it out spiritually.
[39:27] We glory in tribulation also knowing
[39:30] that tribulation works patience.
[39:34] So all this 40 years of trouble for
[39:35] Moses produ made him a patient man and
[39:39] patience produced experience which is
[39:41] character in the Greek. So once you're
[39:45] patient then you can have good character
[39:48] and then experience produces hope.
[39:51] Hallelujah. And hope maketh not ashamed
[39:55] because the love of God is shed abroad
[39:57] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[40:00] given to us. So, at the end of our
[40:02] lives, at the end of our days, we should
[40:05] have hope that he's going to receive us.
[40:09] Look at verse uh I'm sorry, let's go to
[40:10] 1 Corinthians 13:4. I'm kind of almost
[40:13] at that chapter in my Corinthians
[40:14] series. I've been taking a little break
[40:15] because I had all these other thoughts.
[40:17] You know, in the summertime, I got more
[40:18] time to think about God. I'm not
[40:19] working, you know. I got a lot more
[40:21] thoughts here. Uh 1 Corinthians 13:4,
[40:24] "Charity suffereth long and is kind.
[40:27] Charity envieth not. Charity vaunteth
[40:30] not itself. is not puffed up.
[40:34] So, see, it's the love of God. You know,
[40:36] you look at some people's lives and how
[40:37] could you suffer through all that? It's
[40:39] the love of God.
[40:42] Hallelujah. I don't, brother, I don't
[40:44] know how you can make it through those
[40:45] difficult times. How did you even do it?
[40:46] It was God's love that was in my heart.
[40:49] Right? Because charity can suffer a long
[40:52] time.
[40:54] You can suffer a long time because you
[40:56] have love for God. Because you know God
[40:58] loves you. And then the Bible said the
[41:01] love is in your heart. Praise God. God
[41:03] put his love in your heart. So you can
[41:05] suffer a long time.
[41:09] Hebrews 5:8. Though he were a son,
[41:11] Jesus, yet learned he obedience by the
[41:14] things which he suffered. So our days of
[41:18] suffering are teach us to obey God. Oh,
[41:21] I'm finally going to obey God. I'm
[41:23] finally going to do that. Why? Because
[41:25] you suffered, right? Verse nine. and
[41:29] being made perfect, he became the author
[41:32] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[41:34] obey him.
[41:36] Hallelujah. How many want to obey today?
[41:39] Let's make this a day of obedience.
[41:40] Praise God.
[41:45] So, see church, one day is so powerful.
[41:48] Hallelujah.
[41:52] I thought of uh I thought, you know,
[41:54] let's let's I want to show that
[41:55] slideshow. You know, we never did the
[41:57] anniversary. I just want to show you
[41:59] this again. It meant a lot to me. So,
[42:01] yeah, just switch over here. You
[42:02] probably saw me switching it earlier.
[42:05] You know, the last two years I haven't
[42:06] done the slideshow. I just I guess I
[42:07] just forgotten when it come to our
[42:09] anniversary time of our church. We just
[42:11] passed 19 years.
[42:13] And I just thought this day was so
[42:15] important. Thursday, November 22nd in
[42:17] the year 2000 was so important because
[42:20] that's the day Simon shared the message
[42:21] of Brother Brandham with me. Brother
[42:23] Bram's Bible message.
[42:25] And had I not had that day,
[42:29] our my life and your life, we wouldn't
[42:31] be inter interconnected right now. If it
[42:34] wasn't for that day, I just thought
[42:36] about that day was like the dominoes of
[42:38] all these dominoes that have fallen. And
[42:40] now all all of our lives are like
[42:42] dominoes. We're all coming together.
[42:44] That was one domino that brought me into
[42:47] me and my family into your families,
[42:51] right? So, look, my me and Simon are
[42:53] doing these tough guy faces. Like, we're
[42:55] just What do they This is what do they
[42:56] call that? Duck face. I don't know what
[42:58] they call like. We're just doing like
[42:59] tough guy. Look, I'm a tough guy. Look,
[43:01] I've got long hair. Not as long as Well,
[43:03] yeah. Long as I got here. I thought I
[43:05] was so cool. I wasn't.
[43:08] But this was the day later that night,
[43:11] Simon, I drive back to this was in
[43:12] Wadssworth. I drive back to Akran and
[43:15] Simon would play serpent seed for me.
[43:17] And as the sermon went on, my eyes got
[43:19] wider and wider
[43:21] until I was like, Simon, this is the
[43:22] truth. God said there's two seeds.
[43:27] There's two seeds. And whatever seed
[43:29] they're produced of, uh, whatever seed
[43:32] they had, uh, it produced a child,
[43:35] right? Whatever whatever fruit they ate
[43:36] of, produce a seed, offspring, because
[43:39] that's what God said. I'll put emnity
[43:42] between thee and the woman, between thy
[43:44] s seed and her seed. So, the serpent had
[43:47] a seed in Genesis 3:15,
[43:50] and that means offspring. How did he
[43:52] have an offspring if they ate an apple?
[43:54] It wasn't an apple. It was adultery.
[43:58] And so, my eyes were open that night. I
[44:00] thought, "That day changed everything."
[44:03] And I was willing to listen. It was a
[44:05] two-hour sermon. I think we got home
[44:06] around 10. I remember we were up past
[44:08] midnight. And I just I wasn't getting
[44:10] tired. I'm like, "What? Oh my goodness.
[44:12] I think I have my Bible." And Simon's
[44:13] like, "Yes." Now, turn here, Genesis.
[44:15] And here turned to Proverbs. I'm like,
[44:17] "Oh my goodness, we're That was in the
[44:19] days of cassette tape." Children, you
[44:20] have no idea what I'm talking about, but
[44:21] we had to press play and then these
[44:24] little plastic pieces of of cassette
[44:26] tape would spin and sometimes they get
[44:29] stuck. You had to pull them out and
[44:30] twist them back in. You don't know
[44:32] nothing about that.
[44:34] But all for two hours straight, I'm
[44:37] getting more revelation
[44:39] and the things everything starts making
[44:41] sense. The Bible starts making sense.
[44:45] I'm just going to go through this
[44:46] quickly again. No, that's the one day.
[44:48] And then look, just look at all then we
[44:50] started having Bible services. There's
[44:51] my beautiful bride. Hallelujah. Sister
[44:54] Kristen. The first home services in
[44:56] Akran. Tim Meyer started those services.
[44:58] He's he's he's pretending to be me. He's
[45:01] making fun of me there. And we're
[45:02] dancing, praising the Lord. I'm not
[45:04] going to show that video. Devon, that's
[45:07] Carrie got baptized there. Devon.
[45:10] John and brother Brooks. Here's brother
[45:12] Simon before he was preaching. But see,
[45:14] he was always preaching. Look, he's got
[45:15] his Bible there. He was always preaching
[45:16] church. He was preaching to me. 2006,
[45:19] our first service. So, we just had our
[45:21] 19th anniversary as a church. We had it
[45:23] in a home. That's a little Rebecca,
[45:26] right? I think that's Rebecca.
[45:29] That's how we used to have church right
[45:31] there. There's Van giving himself bunny
[45:32] bunny ears. Vang. Brother Vang.
[45:38] All those years ago, Brother Vang
[45:41] Elijah.
[45:43] Now, he's the guy that got married
[45:44] yesterday. He got married yesterday.
[45:46] Shay, that tells you how old we are now,
[45:49] right? That's in our house there. Baby
[45:52] Lydia, baby Malachi.
[45:55] So, I just go through these. Sister, who
[45:57] is baptism? Just remember all these. So,
[45:59] this set that one night set all these
[46:01] things in motion. The baptisms. I'm not
[46:04] going to go that. We baptized that
[46:06] 90-year-old sister right before she
[46:07] died. A few uh months before she died,
[46:09] we baptized her in the name of the Lord
[46:10] Jesus Christ.
[46:12] Brother Cam, there's Brother Nia. Yeah,
[46:14] there's Brother Nia. I wish he was here.
[46:15] That's brother Nia. All those years ago,
[46:18] see how we change over time. We get
[46:20] better with age, don't we, saints?
[46:21] Right, sister Beatric. We get better
[46:23] with age. Now, that's the man who helped
[46:26] me start this church. I have the utmost
[46:28] respect for that man, Brother James
[46:30] Brownie. One of the finest Christian men
[46:31] I ever met there. True man of God.
[46:33] Hallelujah. That's our first rental that
[46:36] we had. small little church there.
[46:40] Bang. Testifying sister singing
[46:42] specials. That was back in 2007 when Cam
[46:45] I was I was Cam and Simon's pastor. Can
[46:47] you believe that? At one time.
[46:50] Hallelujah. Oh yeah. There's Zir. Little
[46:53] Zur
[46:57] Wendy.
[46:59] Look at all these dominoes. Church. All
[47:01] the days God knew all these days. Look
[47:03] at that. That's what we used to worship
[47:04] in. Look at this dirty old room we used
[47:05] to worship in. And I I give credit to my
[47:07] family. They would come and have come to
[47:09] our services with a dirty little room
[47:10] like that. You know, Kristen's family,
[47:13] you know, her mother and siblings would
[47:14] come to our services. We had hardly had
[47:16] any money just to drive. We just needed
[47:18] more space, you know. That's why I say
[47:20] I'm so happy. Look, that's that was our
[47:21] floor. We're Look, we got carpet now.
[47:23] We're blessed. Amen. I mean, hallelujah.
[47:28] Look at that. I mean, that used to be
[47:29] our church. So, we're we're doing better
[47:31] by God's grace. Our third place was over
[47:33] on Waterlue. That's where the the sar
[47:36] pongs first started coming, right?
[47:38] Sunday school.
[47:42] Uh that's baby, right? Baby.
[47:46] Some of these will get in there. We got
[47:47] virtue in nature coming up here real
[47:49] quick by God's grace.
[47:51] Little guy. Okay.
[47:54] Jose. I first met Jose in 2013. Brother,
[47:59] look at that handsome guy there. Loris.
[48:02] Yes, sir. Brother Adam,
[48:05] Sister Bo. Praise God. Brother Amen's
[48:07] baptism. There must be something real.
[48:09] Praise God. I still believe that.
[48:10] Hallelujah. Amen. When CIA came. Yeah.
[48:14] Sorry. Everybody likes that one. Little
[48:16] Princess Cia. There we go. But set all
[48:19] these dominoes in order. Who would have
[48:21] married if it wasn't for the message
[48:23] dominoes all these days?
[48:29] Yes, sir. Sister Sia at the altar
[48:31] praying, you know, she separated from
[48:33] her family. I remember she would always
[48:34] pray at the altar, cry out to God, you
[48:37] know, for children, for family.
[48:40] Remember remember she would hold our
[48:41] babies when she didn't have any
[48:42] children. And she would walk away,
[48:43] pretend like she's getting in Vang's
[48:45] car, taking our babies home.
[48:48] And now we're at our fourth and final
[48:50] place. Well, I should say final. It's
[48:51] our fourth place by God's grace. But
[48:52] look how dirty this This is the
[48:53] sanctuary. The These two are the
[48:55] sanctuary. Carpet. I mean, there's all
[48:57] stuff all over the walls.
[48:59] Look how dirty the carpet was.
[49:02] You got some good workers back in those
[49:04] days, right? Look at Caris there. Caris
[49:08] got the mullet going on there.
[49:11] Caseia working. Help paint these walls.
[49:15] Roll up the old dirty stinky carpets.
[49:17] That's That's what the walls look like
[49:18] when we come in. That was the walls.
[49:22] All these all these events of our lives
[49:26] there. That's what I'm talking about.
[49:28] There's little nature. There's little
[49:30] virtue.
[49:33] Yeah. There's little baby virtue. There
[49:34] you are.
[49:36] Sunday school.
[49:39] My pastor, the first pastor and the man
[49:41] who taught me the Bible studies. I go to
[49:43] his I drive across the state from
[49:44] Brother Craig. I texted him the other
[49:46] day. The two most influential men in my
[49:48] life.
[49:51] Quaca on the tambourine. Huh? Remember
[49:53] that one?
[49:54] As Austin's first baptism.
[49:59] We're hugging. My cousin would come.
[50:01] He'd drive three hours to come see us.
[50:03] God delivered him from all those demons.
[50:04] He was fully possessed with demons.
[50:06] Fully. And God delivered him through
[50:08] Cam's ministry, then another ministry
[50:09] when he fell back away. And he would
[50:11] drive just to tell us how much he loved
[50:13] us for standing on the word of God.
[50:17] Oh, my wife on I don't know why I put
[50:19] that one in there. Lydia's baptism.
[50:22] Quisha's baptism. Oh, that's the
[50:24] dedication. Yeah, that's dedication of
[50:26] virtue. So, I thought, you know what? I
[50:28] should probably show that today because
[50:30] we had another dedication for Sar Palm
[50:32] family today by God's grace.
[50:35] A little virtue being dedicated there by
[50:36] the grace of God.
[50:39] Look, all these events God has brought
[50:40] together in our lives. How many
[50:41] appreciate that? By God's grace. And I
[50:43] can show that that video later if you
[50:45] want to see it. But brother Jose went to
[50:46] brother Ram's grave. Remember that?
[50:49] All those we got red hots. Then Haven
[50:52] was baptized. Esther was baptized. Jose

[53:48] Brother William,
[53:50] it said Austin Selena came back. Praise
[53:51] God. How many grateful for that? Look,
[53:53] look all these dominoes that played a
[53:55] part of this
[53:57] Jose
[54:01] Thanksgiving fellowship testifying for
[54:04] Austin.
[54:06] Yep. And then I just put that that was
[54:07] what 20 2022. So three years ago we had
[54:10] the shoe makes with us.
[54:13] Lily and James. Now there
[54:16] I think this is this is the last one. I
[54:18] haven't updated it for two years. So I
[54:20] think the Sarongs were in the Ghana
[54:22] during this one. They made that Ghana
[54:23] trip a couple years ago. So we had Emma.
[54:27] Yep. So that was it. I think. Yeah. So
[54:28] last year was our 18th and this is our
[54:30] 19th.
[54:32] So I just thought I'd show that again to
[54:33] see how the impact of one day. One day
[54:38] Simon kept asking me, you need to hear
[54:39] this sermon on serpent seed. You need to
[54:41] hear this. Without that, brother, we
[54:43] would never have met. Brother Mercy,
[54:45] right? We would not know Sister Lena.
[54:48] It's the the each day is so important to
[54:50] put God first every single day. I'm
[54:53] almost at an hour, so I don't want to go
[54:55] too long here today, but um
[55:00] let me see here. Let's go through a few
[55:02] more verses and I'll bring it down to
[55:03] close. Maybe give me 15 more minutes. By
[55:04] God's grace, we'll see. All right. Now,
[55:08] let's go to Isaiah 38:20. Isaiah 38:20.
[55:20] You know, there's certain days where we
[55:21] should just spend all the day praising
[55:23] God, right? I showed you we're going to
[55:25] have some days we battle all day,
[55:27] plagued all day, envying all day, right?
[55:30] We're we're struggling. But we ought to
[55:32] have some days where we sing all the day
[55:35] because the Bible said, "The Lord was
[55:36] ready to save me. Therefore, we will
[55:38] sing my songs to the stringed
[55:41] instruments all the days of our life in
[55:43] the house of the Lord. Hallelujah. So,
[55:46] think about all those pictures we saw.
[55:48] All the great blessings, all the time
[55:49] God saved us or healed us or give us
[55:51] children, all these great blessings that
[55:53] we have. It ought to make us want to
[55:55] come to the house of God and give God
[55:57] praise.
[55:59] It ought to make you happy with your
[56:01] spouse. Ecclesiastes 9:9. I like this
[56:04] one.
[56:06] Look at Ecclesiastes 9:9. Live joyfully
[56:09] with the wife whom thou lovest. So
[56:12] married men. Let's be joyful. Let's be
[56:14] happy with our wives. And all the
[56:16] brothers said, "Amen."
[56:19] See, be joyful with your wife. Live
[56:21] joyfully with the wife of whom thou
[56:23] lovest all the days of thy life, of thy
[56:25] vanity, which he hath given thee under
[56:27] the son, all the days of thy vanity. for
[56:29] that is thy portion in this life and in
[56:32] the labor which thou takest under the
[56:35] sun.
[56:37] So let's try to remember to sing all day
[56:40] to be joyful with our family all day.
[56:42] And that just doesn't apply to our
[56:43] wives. Let's do that to our children as
[56:45] well.
[56:47] God has saved me. God has redeemed me.
[56:48] He's forgiven me. I'm going to be
[56:50] joyful. I'm going to sing in my home.
[56:52] I'm going to spend all day giving God
[56:54] glory.
[56:56] That's right.
[56:57] and let's work for God's glory. So when
[56:59] you go to your job, don't try to fret it
[57:01] so much. Ecclesiastes 5:18. I know we
[57:04] joke about that. I got to go tomorrow's
[57:06] Monday. I got to go back to work. But
[57:08] let's try to look at it a little
[57:09] differently that God, it's God's
[57:11] blessing on you. Ecclesiastes 5:1 18.
[57:16] Behold that which I have seen. It is
[57:17] good and calmly for one to eat and drink
[57:19] and to enjoy the good of all of his
[57:22] labor. See, you wouldn't be able to eat
[57:23] and drink without your hard work,
[57:25] without the job God gave you. Right?
[57:29] That he taketh under the sun all the
[57:31] days of his life, which God giveth him,
[57:34] for it is his portion.
[57:37] Remember that today. Remember, next time
[57:38] you go to work, thank God I get to go to
[57:40] work because I got food on my table.
[57:42] That's God's gift to us. Hallelujah.
[57:47] Now, back to our Let's We did our
[57:48] brothers. Now, let's go to our sisters.
[57:50] Proverbs 31:12.
[57:52] Proverbs 31:12
[57:54] uh husbands be joyful with your wives.
[57:56] Now wives she will do him good and not
[57:59] evil all the days of our life. And our
[58:01] married sisters said
[58:03] God bless. I know our sisters do a
[58:05] wonderful job of that. So husbands be
[58:08] joyful with your wives. Wives do him
[58:12] good all the days of his life.
[58:16] Psalm 89:16.
[58:20] Psalm 89:16.
[58:22] Let's make this day a day where we're
[58:23] just joyful, rejoicing, and glad in what
[58:26] God has done for us. Let's do it the
[58:27] rest of the day. Hallelujah. What What
[58:31] do we have to be decad about? We're so
[58:32] blessed. Hallelujah. God has given us
[58:35] these wonderful children here by God's
[58:37] grace. We have so much to be thankful
[58:39] for.
[58:40] Psalm 86, I'm sorry, 89:16, I'm sorry,
[58:43] 89:16. In thy name shall they rejoice
[58:46] all the day and in thy righteousness
[58:49] shall they be exalted. So see rejoicing
[58:52] all day in the name of Jesus.
[58:55] Psalm 44:8.
[58:58] Now here you got permission. Brag on
[59:00] Jesus all day. You got permission to
[59:02] brag on Jesus all day. In God we boast
[59:06] all the day long and praise thy name
[59:09] forever. Cila,
[59:11] I was a longhaired
[59:14] uh denominational Christian addicted to
[59:18] drugs and all these things, but I can
[59:19] boast that God sent me the serpent seed
[59:22] message and then all the other
[59:23] revelation and I boast on God. God
[59:25] brought me out of that. Hallelujah.
[59:28] I can brag I can brag on God all day.
[59:30] God did this for me. Praise God. I
[59:32] didn't save myself. I didn't go looking
[59:34] for truth. God came looking for me.
[59:36] Praise God. Amen. I can boast on God all
[59:40] day. Thank you, Jesus. You're the
[59:41] healer. You're the savior. You're the
[59:43] deliverer. You're the one who gives
[59:45] revelation. And the gates of hell shall
[59:47] not prevail against it.
[59:51] Hallelujah.
[59:58] Psalm 1197.
[1:00:01] Psalm 119:97 says, "Men, oh how I how
[1:00:07] love I thy law. It is my meditation all
[1:00:11] the day." Those are the best days, too.
[1:00:14] Just think about God's word all day,
[1:00:16] right? Think about, oh, the I heard the
[1:00:18] masterpiece yesterday. I did listen to
[1:00:19] that yesterday. I got to think about
[1:00:20] that all throughout the day. And then I
[1:00:22] got to think about this message just
[1:00:23] back. Yeah. Every time I get done
[1:00:25] working, you we do a little work this
[1:00:26] not then start meditating on God. Praise
[1:00:28] God. You have to revisit those thoughts,
[1:00:30] right? Just keep coming. Keep keep
[1:00:32] bringing all the thoughts back to the
[1:00:33] Lord Jesus. Those are the best days.
[1:00:39] Proverbs 23:17, remember the fear of the
[1:00:42] Lord is to hate evil and depart from
[1:00:44] evil. The Bible says in Proverbs 23:17
[1:00:48] says, "Be let not thine heart envy
[1:00:50] sinners." This goes good with Psalm 73,
[1:00:53] "But be thou in the fear of the Lord all
[1:00:56] the day long.
[1:00:58] Try to hate evil all day.
[1:01:01] Try to walk away from evil all day.
[1:01:04] Don't get trapped in Satan's snare. Walk
[1:01:06] away from the snare.
[1:01:09] Live in the fear of God all day long.
[1:01:11] Don't click on that. Don't look at that.
[1:01:13] Don't say that. When you're tempted to
[1:01:14] do that, don't do it. Walk away from it.
[1:01:16] Praise God. There's my hour.
[1:01:22] And church, I want to lay this thought
[1:01:24] in there. How would you live if tomorrow
[1:01:26] was your last day?
[1:01:28] I got two examples of people who knew
[1:01:30] there it was their last day. King Saul,
[1:01:34] we read that on Wednesday, 1st Samuel
[1:01:35] 28, he went to the witch of Endor. He
[1:01:38] said, "Pull up Samuel." She said, "I see
[1:01:40] gods coming up." He she saw Theophanes,
[1:01:43] but one of them was Samuel.
[1:01:45] He said, "Why do you call me up for my
[1:01:47] rest?" Remember the story? He said,
[1:01:49] "Well, the Lord won't speak to me." He
[1:01:52] says, uh, he said, 'Tomorrow, King Saul,
[1:01:55] you'll be with me. You and your sons
[1:01:57] will be with me. So, he falls on the
[1:01:59] ground all night, lays on the ground. He
[1:02:02] knows he's going to die the next day.
[1:02:03] Well, what did he do the next day? He
[1:02:05] went out to fight with his sons.
[1:02:08] He spent his final day fighting for the
[1:02:11] God of Israel. Even though he denied
[1:02:13] him, you know, he he he done all these
[1:02:16] evil things, all these abominable
[1:02:17] things, right? He went to a witch,
[1:02:18] right? He did all he murdered 85
[1:02:20] priests. I mean, he did all these evil
[1:02:22] things, but yet when he knew it was his
[1:02:24] final day, he laid on his face, he was
[1:02:26] able to get the value out of that day.
[1:02:28] Amen. That's what I'm trying to say.
[1:02:29] Praise God. If he only had one day left,
[1:02:31] get all the value out of it. Give it all
[1:02:33] to God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:02:36] He died not uh not against his sons, but
[1:02:40] now he's united with Jonathan because
[1:02:41] Jonathan was on David's side. Of course,
[1:02:43] they had that friendship that was such a
[1:02:45] strong friendship. But he's able to
[1:02:47] forget about David, David and Jonathan
[1:02:49] for that final day because he knows it's
[1:02:51] his last day. And it was a very valuable
[1:02:53] day. So much so that even though he
[1:02:55] died, David sang about his strength and
[1:02:57] his courage that he had in this final
[1:02:59] day.
[1:03:01] He was united with his family in his
[1:03:03] death. He took advantage of that last
[1:03:06] day. Hallelujah.
[1:03:10] So how would you live if tomorrow was
[1:03:11] your last day?
[1:03:13] Now we know what what a real believer
[1:03:15] does. They would get serious with God.
[1:03:17] They get real sober and say, "I'm going
[1:03:18] to live this. I'm going to unite with
[1:03:20] people. I'm unite with the word of God.
[1:03:22] I'm going to get all my life lined up so
[1:03:24] I'm ready to go meet God."
[1:03:26] And now we know the other one we know is
[1:03:28] Jesus. Jesus knew his crucifixion would
[1:03:30] be his last day. He knew that Moses and
[1:03:34] Elijah came to him and the Bible they
[1:03:36] spoke of his deceas.
[1:03:38] In other words, you're going to suffer
[1:03:39] this at the hands of Pontius Pilate.
[1:03:41] You're going to suffer all these things
[1:03:43] which will rise again the third day.
[1:03:44] Hallelujah. So, what did he do? Luke
[1:03:47] 22:14. Okay, that's right. That's fine.
[1:03:49] Uh, Luke 22:14.
[1:03:52] What do you want to do on his last day
[1:03:54] before he was given over?
[1:03:58] And when the hour was come, Luke 24, I'm
[1:04:00] sorry, 22:14.
[1:04:02] He sat down and 12 apostles with him. He
[1:04:05] wanted to sit down with his closest
[1:04:07] friends on his last day.
[1:04:10] And he said to them, "With desire, I
[1:04:12] have desired to eat this Passover with
[1:04:14] you before I suffer." He wanted to eat a
[1:04:16] meal with his closest friends.
[1:04:18] Hallelujah.
[1:04:20] He just wanted to spend time with him
[1:04:22] and show them when I'm in you, you're in
[1:04:25] me. When you when you take the
[1:04:27] communion, it shows spiritually my
[1:04:29] spirit's in you. And then you're in me
[1:04:31] as well. I chose you before the
[1:04:34] foundation of the world. and when you
[1:04:36] partake of my word, my word comes in you
[1:04:38] because you were in me before the
[1:04:39] foundation of the world.
[1:04:42] So he chose to have communion. He chose
[1:04:44] to wash his disciples feet.
[1:04:48] And I love those words with desire. I've
[1:04:51] really desired on my last day. I've
[1:04:52] desired to be with the believers.
[1:04:55] Oh God, if I get my choice, I want to be
[1:04:57] with the saints on my last day.
[1:05:00] Hallelujah. Where else would you want to
[1:05:01] be, church, than with the people of God?
[1:05:05] fighting for the cause of Jesus Christ.
[1:05:09] Hallelujah.
[1:05:12] All right, let me do this in closing
[1:05:14] here. I got a few more things.
[1:05:17] Psalm 139:16. Thank you, hun, for some
[1:05:20] even with the baby. Look at you. One arm
[1:05:22] wonder back there. Thank you, hun.
[1:05:26] Psalm 139:16.
[1:05:29] This is a beautiful chapter, of course,
[1:05:31] written by David. Psalm 139:16.
[1:05:38] Okay, thank you. Thine eyes did see my
[1:05:41] substance, yet being unperfect, and in
[1:05:43] thy book all my members were written,
[1:05:45] which in continuence were fashioned,
[1:05:48] when as yet there was none of them. You
[1:05:50] know, we think of a Vander. You know,
[1:05:52] the Bible said God's eyes were on him
[1:05:55] the whole time he was being formed.
[1:05:58] Little Tulsi. God's eyes were watching
[1:06:00] him. And then God knew all of the days
[1:06:03] before there was even one of them.
[1:06:06] God made the day at the beginning. He's
[1:06:09] he chose us in his mind before the
[1:06:10] foundation of the world. And he's
[1:06:12] determined all the days that we're to
[1:06:14] serve him. And he walks he guides us
[1:06:16] along each day. And then when all the
[1:06:18] days are over, he'll receive us up into
[1:06:20] glory. Amen.
[1:06:23] He was with us before we even had our
[1:06:24] first day. Praise God. Watching over us.
[1:06:28] How much more is he with us, church,
[1:06:29] than we realize? Do we really realize
[1:06:31] how much God is with us?
[1:06:37] Psalm 68:19
[1:06:53] read this I think last week. Blessed be
[1:06:55] the Lord who daily loadeth us with
[1:06:57] benefits. Even the God of our salvation
[1:07:00] sila.
[1:07:02] So every day we got to realize today God
[1:07:04] has loaded you up with good things. I
[1:07:07] should have brought a backpack and
[1:07:08] loaded it up and then I should have hid
[1:07:10] it under here. Maybe it's too late now.
[1:07:12] I let the cat out of the bag. I should
[1:07:14] have I should have done that and then
[1:07:16] say my and it looked really heavy,
[1:07:18] right? But that's what the Bible says.
[1:07:19] God has done that. He's loaded us with
[1:07:21] all these blessings, with forgiveness,
[1:07:23] with joy, with victory, with peace, with
[1:07:27] supernatural gifts of the spirit. And
[1:07:29] the church said,
[1:07:31] and that's just spiritual, right? We've
[1:07:33] got all the natural blessings, too. All
[1:07:35] the food and shelter and clothing and
[1:07:37] and and family and and work and all
[1:07:39] these things. He loads us each day. We
[1:07:41] get a brand new load of God's love and
[1:07:44] mercy. Hallelujah. each day.
[1:07:49] My goodness, every day he loads us with
[1:07:51] all of his benefits. The value of one
[1:07:54] day. I'm going to read you something
[1:07:55] here. I had some ideas and I plugged
[1:07:57] into chat GTP and here's what it spit
[1:07:59] out. So, I'm going to read it to you.
[1:08:01] The astonishing value of a single day. A
[1:08:04] single day is just 24 hours. It may seem
[1:08:07] ordinary, but yet it has immeasurable
[1:08:09] potential, unseen miracles, and eternal
[1:08:12] weight. Each day is a gift. intricate
[1:08:15] intricately woven with divine intention
[1:08:18] and staggering detail.
[1:08:21] There are 1,440
[1:08:23] minutes in every day. And church, could
[1:08:25] we spend a few of those praying? Could
[1:08:27] we spend a few of those worshiping God?
[1:08:31] 1440.
[1:08:34] That's 86,400
[1:08:36] seconds. Each one passing irreversibly,
[1:08:40] silently marking the story of your life.
[1:08:45] We're almost at the end of the sermon.
[1:08:47] We just passed through the beginning of
[1:08:48] the sermon. It's just it's passing right
[1:08:51] now as we're as we're going through it.
[1:08:53] Time is passing. Every second is a
[1:08:55] heartbeat of opportunity, a breath of
[1:08:57] grace. You cannot store up your time.
[1:09:01] You cannot stretch it or retrieve it.
[1:09:03] Once it passes, it's gone forever. Time
[1:09:06] is the most valuable thing we possess.
[1:09:09] It's the only thing we cannot get back.
[1:09:12] The heartbeat. Let's look at the
[1:09:13] heartbeat. It's the silent rhythm of
[1:09:15] life. Your heartbeat beats a 100,000
[1:09:19] times per day. Isn't that something? You
[1:09:20] got 100,000 hairs and you get 100,000
[1:09:22] heartbeats.
[1:09:25] That's over 100,000 reminders that
[1:09:27] you're alive. That God is sustaining you
[1:09:29] moment by moment. When was the last time
[1:09:32] you told your heart to beat? You didn't.
[1:09:35] It just beats.
[1:09:37] God just provides you life. He just
[1:09:39] gives you life.
[1:09:41] We rarely notice it yet, but this
[1:09:43] involuntary rhythm declares you're still
[1:09:46] here. Your purpose is still not finished
[1:09:48] yet.
[1:09:50] I've got a purpose. It's for his
[1:09:51] glorious grace.
[1:09:54] Let's look at a day of infinite
[1:09:55] possibility. In one day, a life can
[1:09:57] begin, a life can end. A hardened heart
[1:10:00] can soften. A lost soul can find hope.
[1:10:05] A word spoken in kindness can alter
[1:10:07] someone's direction forever like it
[1:10:08] altered mine. Come listen to this sermon
[1:10:12] about the serpent seed. Changed my life
[1:10:14] forever.
[1:10:16] A prayer can reach heaven and return
[1:10:19] with an answer. Each day you're given a
[1:10:22] fresh page in the book in God's book of
[1:10:24] your life, the book of eternity, eternal
[1:10:27] life. And it's inked with the decisions
[1:10:29] that echo beyond time.
[1:10:34] Jesus often emphasized the importance of
[1:10:36] today. Take no thought therefore for the
[1:10:38] tomorrow. For the tomorrow should take
[1:10:40] thought for the things of itself.
[1:10:43] In other words, focus on today. What can
[1:10:46] you do today to honor God?
[1:10:50] The past is a memory. The future's a
[1:10:52] mystery. But today is a gift, which is
[1:10:55] why it's called the present.
[1:10:57] Today is the only guaranteed time you
[1:11:00] can act, forgive, pray, love, obey, and
[1:11:04] to seek the Lord.
[1:11:06] It's the only day you can do that. Can't
[1:11:09] do it any other day. You got to do it
[1:11:10] today. If there's anything you need to
[1:11:12] get done, do it today. And if it doesn't
[1:11:15] get done, do it tomorrow. That's how you
[1:11:18] write a book.
[1:11:21] The final truth is that today is all we
[1:11:24] have.
[1:11:25] Time doesn't wait. It doesn't ask if
[1:11:27] we're ready for something. It flows with
[1:11:30] or without our consent. No one has ever
[1:11:33] touched tomorrow. No one can relive
[1:11:35] yesterday. We only ever live in the
[1:11:37] sacred sliver of time called now. So
[1:11:41] make today count. Guard it. Use it
[1:11:44] wisely. Fill it with what matters
[1:11:46] because the past is gone. We cannot
[1:11:48] change it. The future's uncertain. We
[1:11:51] cannot control it. But today is here and
[1:11:53] it is enough. Because Psalm 90:12 says,
[1:11:57] "So teach us to number our days that we
[1:12:00] may apply our hearts to wisdom."
[1:12:04] the value of today.
[1:12:09] You know, I've been told by numerous
[1:12:10] friends, I've also seen it on uh you
[1:12:12] know, numerous videos about time
[1:12:14] management and uh being proficient and
[1:12:16] efficient. They always say we've got to
[1:12:18] learn to enjoy the journey, right? We're
[1:12:21] always looking to head forward. Oh, once
[1:12:22] this happens in my life, then I'll be
[1:12:24] happy or then I'll rejoice in God. We
[1:12:26] should rejoice in God today because
[1:12:28] you're not guaranteed tomorrow.
[1:12:31] Enjoy the present time. And my wife
[1:12:33] reminded me last night, sometimes if we
[1:12:34] worry, people can get ulcers.
[1:12:37] Why worry about tomorrow? Why worry
[1:12:39] about the past? Alls we got is today.
[1:12:43] Amen. Do what needs to be done today.
[1:12:47] Hallelujah. Don't worry about anything.
[1:12:49] Bible said, "Be anxious for nothing."
[1:12:52] You know, my mom's I was just thinking
[1:12:53] about this. my mom's 75th Ann uh
[1:12:55] birthday's coming up and when she turns
[1:12:58] 70 we gave a whole day to her and we're
[1:13:01] going to do that again in October. We're
[1:13:03] going to give her a whole day of just
[1:13:05] thanking God for her influence in our
[1:13:08] lives. I always cry every time I think
[1:13:10] about it because I wouldn't be here
[1:13:11] without my mom.
[1:13:13] And I there's this famous saying it goes
[1:13:15] like this. They say it takes a minute to
[1:13:18] find a special person. Just takes one
[1:13:21] minute. If you're at Target, you just
[1:13:22] got to take one minute. Walk around.
[1:13:23] find somebody who's special.
[1:13:26] It takes an hour to appreciate them.
[1:13:30] It takes a day to love them,
[1:13:34] but it takes an entire lifetime to
[1:13:36] forget them. Hallelujah. I like that.
[1:13:42] You know, we've got another friend, a
[1:13:43] family friend who's 80 years old and
[1:13:44] he's fighting cancer for the second
[1:13:46] time. He's learned to number his days.
[1:13:49] He he realizes this might be the last
[1:13:52] time. And when he was 75, he had cancer
[1:13:55] first. He prayed and said, "God, if you
[1:13:57] just give me five more years, I'll be
[1:13:58] happy." And God God, that's when we
[1:14:00] prayed for him. And he's like, "God
[1:14:02] heard your prayer, Jesse." He told me
[1:14:03] that. He said, "God heard your prayer."
[1:14:05] Now, God used chemo to heal him. But he
[1:14:07] said, "God heard your prayer. God's
[1:14:09] given me five more years to serve to
[1:14:12] serve him." But now he's like, he's
[1:14:14] like, "Lord," he said, "I want to get
[1:14:15] five more. if I could have five more.
[1:14:20] And church, now that he's fighting it a
[1:14:22] second time, he's speaking about what do
[1:14:24] I do with my possessions and where's
[1:14:25] this going to go? He's thinking about
[1:14:27] all that. Now, church, some people get
[1:14:28] the chance to do that, some people
[1:14:29] don't.
[1:14:32] So, it's whatever story God writes for
[1:14:34] your life,
[1:14:36] you want to use it for the praise and
[1:14:39] honor of the Lord Jesus Christ. I think
[1:14:42] of Aander and Tulsi. They seem to have
[1:14:44] so many days of memories ahead.
[1:14:48] We're gonna take pictures of their first
[1:14:49] crawl,
[1:14:51] their first rolling over. We're gonna
[1:14:53] get it on camera, right?
[1:14:56] Their first words, da da. I think it's
[1:14:58] gonna be dad. Right, brother Wesley? I
[1:15:00] think it's going to be da da. Ain't
[1:15:01] going to be mama. It's dad.
[1:15:05] We're going to get their first steps and
[1:15:07] we'll remember their first prayer.
[1:15:10] We remember their water baptism.
[1:15:13] will take a picture of their first day
[1:15:14] of school
[1:15:17] and there's so many more me. There's so
[1:15:19] many more days. It seems like there's so
[1:15:20] many more days left. Some people they
[1:15:23] only have a few days left.
[1:15:28] If we can realize the value of each day
[1:15:31] and invest it for the kingdom of God, I
[1:15:33] love this. You'll be rewarded with
[1:15:36] endless days.
[1:15:38] If you can just live like every day is
[1:15:40] your last day. Every day is a day. I'm
[1:15:42] going to get victory today. I'm going to
[1:15:43] take up the cross daily. I'm going to
[1:15:45] follow Jesus Christ today. I'm going to
[1:15:47] give God praise all day. If we leave
[1:15:49] live every day like that, he gives us
[1:15:51] endless days.
[1:15:54] What's the value of one day? God tries
[1:15:57] to help us understand in Psalm 84:8.
[1:16:03] Oh Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer.
[1:16:04] Give ear, oh God of Jacob, sila.
[1:16:09] Behold, oh God, our shield. How many
[1:16:11] believe God's your shield today? He's
[1:16:13] been the shield over my whole life,
[1:16:16] and look upon the face of thine anointed
[1:16:20] God. You've let your spirit come on me.
[1:16:21] I'm anointed by your Holy Spirit. You're
[1:16:23] my shield, God.
[1:16:25] Verse 10. For a day in your courts is
[1:16:29] better than a thousand.
[1:16:33] One day going to church is better than a
[1:16:37] thousand. Now thousand days is about two
[1:16:39] and 3/4 of a year.
[1:16:43] So one day in church is better than
[1:16:45] almost three years out of church.
[1:16:48] That one day will give you more benefit.
[1:16:51] Amen. Give you more benefit, more value
[1:16:55] than three years doing anything else.
[1:16:57] I'm talking about uh building a
[1:16:59] skyscraper, building whatever, building
[1:17:01] a business. We've been talking about
[1:17:02] business, making videos, writing books.
[1:17:04] One day in church is better than three
[1:17:06] years of anything else you could do
[1:17:08] outside of the house of God. God tries
[1:17:10] to give us the value of one day.
[1:17:14] I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house
[1:17:17] of my God than to dwell in the tents of
[1:17:21] wickedness.
[1:17:23] For the Lord is a son and shield. Twice
[1:17:26] he says a shield. For the Lord will give
[1:17:28] you grace and glory. No good thing, what
[1:17:30] a promise, church, will he withhold from
[1:17:32] them that walk uprightly. I have every
[1:17:36] good thing I need because I'm walking
[1:17:37] uprightly in the word. If I don't got it
[1:17:40] yet, well, either it's on the way or it
[1:17:42] wouldn't be good for me.
[1:17:44] I might make it an idol. It might become
[1:17:47] a stumbling block to me. But I know the
[1:17:49] Bible's true. If I spend time in the
[1:17:51] house of God, it's better than all the
[1:17:53] other days. And then God will give me
[1:17:55] every good thing that I need for my
[1:17:57] testimony.
[1:18:00] Oh Lord of hosts, blessed is the man
[1:18:04] that trusteth in thee. The final
[1:18:07] scripture for this sermon, Psalm 52
[1:18:09] verse1.
[1:18:12] Psalm 52 verse1.
[1:18:16] Why boast thou thyself in mischief, oh
[1:18:18] mighty man? The goodness of God endureth
[1:18:22] continually.
[1:18:25] The goodness of God endures all my days.
[1:18:28] Hallelujah. The mischief and the sinners
[1:18:31] are going to do all kinds of awful
[1:18:32] decisions, but God's love, his steadfast
[1:18:36] love endure us all day continually.
[1:18:39] Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can
[1:18:41] come.
[1:18:56] Hallelujah. Let's uh play that song. In
[1:18:58] God's time, he makes all things
[1:18:59] beautiful in his time.
[1:19:02] So, as I said, this sermon has been on
[1:19:04] my heart all week. You know, I
[1:19:06] been reading the book of Psalms. How
[1:19:07] many enjoyed the word of God today?
[1:19:08] Praise the Lord. The value of one day.
[1:19:17] Hallelujah.
[1:19:18] Let's bow our hearts here.
[1:19:21] Father God, we thank you for this day
[1:19:23] today, Lord. It's a beautiful day, Lord,
[1:19:25] to see Sarpong family and a Vander Elio
[1:19:29] Sarpong dedicated to the Lord. He's
[1:19:32] yours, Lord God. Use the child for your
[1:19:35] glory, Lord God.
[1:19:37] Reminds us when Jose's grandson, Levi,
[1:19:40] was dedicated a few weeks ago, Lord God.
[1:19:42] Use Levi for the glory of God.
[1:19:46] These are special days, Lord. hopefully
[1:19:48] many many more days to come for little
[1:19:52] Evander.
[1:19:56] Lord, as I reflect on my life, Lord, I
[1:19:58] see that one day in the year 2000 has
[1:20:02] changed everything.
[1:20:05] The value of that day. I can hardly
[1:20:07] describe it. Look at the friends I have,
[1:20:09] Lord. Look at the church that we have,
[1:20:10] Lord. The sweet people.
[1:20:14] And Lord Raml last week said, "I've
[1:20:16] never walked into a church," she said,
[1:20:18] "that had such love." That's what she
[1:20:20] told us last week. She told me that
[1:20:22] everybody's smiling. She said, "I've
[1:20:24] walked into mega churches and people
[1:20:26] look at me strange. Don't treat me good,
[1:20:28] but I walk in this little church
[1:20:31] and I've never felt love like this.
[1:20:32] Lord, may the love of God fully rest on
[1:20:35] our lives. God,
[1:20:39] that was a special day for her. She was
[1:20:41] a part of us. Lord God got to experience
[1:20:44] love.
[1:20:46] She said, "I turned around. I just saw
[1:20:47] all the children smiling. Everybody
[1:20:49] smiled at me."
[1:20:52] Lord, the value of each day is hard to
[1:20:55] hard to put into perspective. Lord God,
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:21:02] Lord, today is a gift. We don't have
[1:21:05] tomorrow. We'll never get it back.
[1:21:12] We don't have yesterday, Lord God. So,
[1:21:14] Father, help us today, Lord God. If
[1:21:15] there's anything we need to get right
[1:21:17] with you, Lord, there's anything, Lord,
[1:21:20] we need to go tell somebody or
[1:21:23] make sure we follow up on, let's do it
[1:21:25] today. And then, Lord, let us rejoice
[1:21:28] all the day long.
[1:21:30] [Music]
[1:21:32] I believe it was Zechariah that says,
[1:21:33] "We want to serve the Lord in
[1:21:36] righteousness and holiness all the days
[1:21:38] of our life." life. God, we just want
[1:21:39] our life to say, "Holy, holy, holy is
[1:21:42] the Lord God Almighty." As the angels
[1:21:44] sing that unceasingly in heaven, we want
[1:21:47] our life to continually pronounce that
[1:21:49] to the world, to our families. Help us
[1:21:51] husbands to joyfully love our wives.
[1:21:55] Help our wives, Lord, to do good to
[1:21:57] their husbands all the days of their
[1:21:58] life. Let us be joyful to our children,
[1:22:01] Lord God. Hallelujah. Let's be thankful
[1:22:04] for our jobs.
[1:22:06] Let's be thankful for the food and the
[1:22:08] daily bread that you provide. Lord God,
[1:22:11] you have been so kind. You have withheld
[1:22:14] nothing good from us, Lord God. You've
[1:22:16] given us so many good things, Lord God.
[1:22:20] I think I said it a few weeks ago. Lord,
[1:22:22] you've even opened up the windows of
[1:22:24] heaven so much. I hardly got room to
[1:22:25] receive all the food that was donated
[1:22:27] when Tulsi was born. Lord, almost ran
[1:22:30] out of room again.
[1:22:32] Lord, you're rich in mercy, God. You're
[1:22:35] so kind,
[1:22:36] so gracious, Lord God.
[1:22:42] May we boast in Jesus all the day long,
[1:22:44] Lord God, because of your love.
[1:22:47] And as the scripture said in Psalm 73,
[1:22:50] walk with us continually. Guide us
[1:22:53] continually through all of our life
[1:22:55] situations. And then, Lord, receive us
[1:22:58] into endless days.
[1:23:00] We ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
