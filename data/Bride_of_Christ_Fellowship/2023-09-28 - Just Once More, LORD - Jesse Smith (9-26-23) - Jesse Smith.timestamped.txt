[0:27] blessing to you
[0:29] by the grace of the Lord I do want to
[0:32] watch the length here I told brother
[0:33] amen we were just talking I wrote down
[0:35] this list of things
[0:36] I like to preach a little less if we
[0:38] could pray a little more at the end of
[0:40] services by God agree so I don't want to
[0:42] feel pressured like I have to finish my
[0:44] thought I'd like to have a little more
[0:45] prayer time at the end of services I
[0:47] really enjoyed that Sunday the extra
[0:48] prayer on the second service
[0:51] um
[0:53] brother amen and I were just praying
[0:55] that God would do miracles for each and
[0:56] every person praise God
[0:59] one topic that just came up Sister
[1:00] reserves that we just realized
[1:02] what a miracle your life is that you're
[1:05] back in the house of God we were
[1:06] rejoicing over your testimony
[1:08] we thought wow you know excuse me we
[1:10] were saying you know we want God to do
[1:12] Miracles but then we realize wow what a
[1:14] wonderful Miracle sitting right here
[1:15] standing right here with us our sisters
[1:17] there so we love you sisters there and I
[1:19] just really encourage me I don't want to
[1:21] forget the miracle looking right at me
[1:23] and each one of you your life is a
[1:25] miracle for the glory of God a miracle
[1:27] all the way from Arizona two Miracles
[1:28] all the way from Arizona raspberries
[1:29] Hallelujah so we're thankful for the
[1:32] grace of the Lord
[1:35] judges 16 28 just one verse and I have a
[1:38] little word of prayer again
[1:40] have you be seated here
[1:42] let's read that on three one two three
[1:44] and Samson called unto the Lord and said
[1:48] O Lord God remember me I pray thee and
[1:53] strengthen me I pray thee only this once
[1:57] o God that I may be at once avenge of
[2:01] the Philistines for my two eyes
[2:04] uh just a wonderful amazing prayer here
[2:07] he was asking for Revenge he was asking
[2:09] for revenge in his prayer and did you
[2:12] know there's two verses in the New
[2:13] Testament where you can ask for Revenge
[2:15] so we'll look at those at the end of the
[2:17] service here tonight
[2:18] Hallelujah
[2:20] and of course I'll just kind of let let
[2:21] you remind you the Revenge that we want
[2:24] is Revenge from our past mistakes
[2:28] right so we don't want revenge against
[2:29] other people we want revenge from our
[2:32] own mistakes in other words we want
[2:34] revenge over our sinful nature and the
[2:36] church said amen
[2:38] so don't think about well this person
[2:39] did me wrong I want revenge over them no
[2:41] I want revenge over Jesse Smith
[2:44] my sin nature and so that's what that's
[2:47] what we can pull from Samson
[2:49] I might have failed Jesse Smith might
[2:51] have failed last week but I want revenge
[2:53] I want a victory here tonight by God's
[2:55] grace does everybody understand that's
[2:57] our word of prayer father God we thank
[2:58] you for tonight Lord
[3:00] I've listened to this sermon I've Loved
[3:02] this sermon this sermon has meant so
[3:03] much to me over the years Lord God
[3:05] and so I pray Lord you just anoint me to
[3:07] preach your word bless each and every
[3:09] person that came out here and those that
[3:10] would listen on the live stream or the
[3:12] archive Lord God receive all the glory
[3:15] the lord we pray like Samson just once
[3:18] more Lord just visit us just once more
[3:20] dear God are we how we love when you
[3:22] visit Lord God we love the daily
[3:24] Christian Life and we love the the
[3:26] constant fellowship with you but Lord we
[3:28] also love special visitations Lord God
[3:30] when we we all know that God visited us
[3:34] because we know you'll never leave us
[3:36] nor forsake us
[3:37] Hallelujah but there are special
[3:39] visitations that we rejoice in
[3:41] Lord God we might call getting our first
[3:43] love back we might call it Revival
[3:46] Lord we just enjoy those times so much
[3:48] Lord God so we thank you and we give you
[3:50] the glory in Jesus Christ's name and the
[3:52] Saints said amen God bless you being
[3:55] seated praise God good to see you
[3:56] brother Marlon God bless you sir
[3:58] Hallelujah
[4:01] somebody set a timer here we'll kind of
[4:02] see how it goes it's eight or seven
[4:04] o'clock okay not eight o'clock
[4:13] okay so if you haven't listened to
[4:15] sermon lately I would encourage you to
[4:17] do it I think I'm going to preaching it
[4:18] around four or five times sometimes he
[4:20] calls it just once more Lord or oh Lord
[4:22] just just once more and I listened to
[4:25] the one from uh November 17th
[4:27] 1963. so I'm just gonna just revisit
[4:30] some of my brother man's thoughts and
[4:32] then you know add my own scriptures here
[4:35] uh by the grace of God
[4:38] um
[4:38] so uh by God's grace like I said I will
[4:41] see how long it goes I don't know maybe
[4:42] it'd be a 25 minute I mean we might
[4:44] laugh but maybe I'll preach 25 minutes
[4:46] tonight I don't know kind of see how it
[4:47] goes but I'd like to spend a little more
[4:49] time praying at the End by God's grace
[4:51] so brother Brown starts this particular
[4:53] message uh kind of giving a background
[4:56] he said it was probably a hot day at
[4:58] this Philistine Temple and he said there
[5:01] was 3 000 Philistines celebrating a
[5:03] victory over Jehovah's servant
[5:07] and he said their fish God Dagen was was
[5:10] standing up there uh
[5:12] and everybody was uh rejoicing over the
[5:16] victory that the fish had had over
[5:18] Jehovah's servant the fish God
[5:21] and brother Randolph said Samson was
[5:23] being led in of course and he was led in
[5:26] as a disgrace but Ram said uh the man
[5:29] had failed
[5:31] he said God didn't fail but the man
[5:34] failed
[5:35] and that's what we know in our lives God
[5:37] never fails
[5:38] Hallelujah even if even if there's
[5:40] tragedies in our lives God never failed
[5:43] God didn't promise a flowery bed of ease
[5:45] there's not one scripture that says it
[5:46] he promised us rest in our souls is what
[5:49] he promised us hallelujah
[5:52] he also said thinking not strange when
[5:54] fiery Trials come on you
[5:56] he said we must all go through the fiery
[5:58] Trials of faith that our faith may be
[6:01] purified we don't want to go to heaven
[6:03] with a selfish heart we don't want to
[6:05] try to go to heaven uh as as babies
[6:08] right we want to go as mature solid
[6:11] Christians praise God Christians that
[6:13] put on the full armor of God Amen
[6:15] Hallelujah but Samson here is let in
[6:18] he's a disgrace he's failed brother Rand
[6:20] said he was spiritually stripped of his
[6:23] spiritual power and he was morally
[6:25] broken he he broken all the moral stands
[6:30] or Sinners that he'd held for his life
[6:32] the spirit of God was stripped from him
[6:34] think of that the spirit of God was
[6:35] taken from him because of his choices
[6:38] the church the same thing can happen to
[6:39] us we can grieve the Holy Spirit and the
[6:42] anointing can leave us
[6:44] right is that true
[6:46] the Bible says Ephesians 4 30. you know
[6:48] grieve not the holy spirit of God
[6:50] whereby you're sealed to the day of your
[6:52] Redemption praise God so you can be
[6:54] sealed in your soul but the spirit
[6:56] grieved from your your mind like we
[6:59] showed the illustration there at the
[7:01] Baptist Church you can have God's spirit
[7:03] totally grieved in your mind and your
[7:05] body but your soul can be seated your
[7:08] soul can be at rest my goodness
[7:10] it's just it's an amazing thought
[7:12] it's a I would call it a mystery
[7:14] godliness restored to man it's one of
[7:17] the mysteries of God
[7:19] kind of dramatizes it and says this was
[7:22] the main event of uh the Philistine
[7:25] event
[7:26] the main event was to make fun of Samson
[7:29] and make fun of Jehovah
[7:31] and uh the brother man said they had all
[7:34] their preliminaries he said maybe they
[7:36] brought out monkeys and the monkeys
[7:37] perform maybe they brought out all these
[7:39] other uh maybe half-dressed women and so
[7:42] forth that all these preliminaries but
[7:45] it came to the main event and Samson was
[7:47] to be mocked and he said all the all the
[7:49] rich men Sat by their uh their queens
[7:52] and they all they were all drunken they
[7:54] drunk the whole time they got drunk and
[7:57] and were waiting for this moment the the
[7:59] climax of the service was to mock
[8:02] Jehovah
[8:03] and mock Jehovah's servant and rejoiced
[8:06] that they had gotten Victory brother
[8:07] said it this makes me sad even thinking
[8:09] about it doesn't it make you sad yes
[8:11] think of that that that uh God was going
[8:14] to be mocked and it was going to make
[8:15] and it's going to be made to look that
[8:17] God had failed but remember God cannot
[8:20] fail praise God hallelujah I love this
[8:22] because God always gets the last word
[8:23] amen no matter how long that event was
[8:26] God was going to get the last word
[8:27] church God's gonna get the last word in
[8:30] your life
[8:31] Hallelujah he's going to get the last
[8:33] word in this church amen hallelujah he's
[8:35] going to get the last word in the Bride
[8:37] of Jesus Christ amen and the last word
[8:40] will be the last Trump Hallelujah when
[8:42] he changes her body in a moment and the
[8:44] twinkling of an eye praise God
[8:46] Hallelujah that's what I'm living for
[8:48] I've been living for that praise God and
[8:50] God will get the last word he'll get the
[8:52] last say he'll get the last to laugh you
[8:54] know they put out all these uh podcasts
[8:56] and videos making fun of brother Adam
[8:57] but God will get the last say
[9:00] Hallelujah listen to the end of this
[9:02] sermon brother Graham glorifies God it's
[9:05] so beautiful he starts getting
[9:06] discernment he starts reading in the
[9:09] vision he starts reading how to uh spell
[9:11] people's last names you can't fake that
[9:14] you can't fake it I mean goes through
[9:16] three or four or five six or seven
[9:17] discernments he said I can't pronounce
[9:19] your name but here's how to spell it
[9:21] friends God visited this generation
[9:23] praise God
[9:25] Hallelujah and he pointed us to Jesus
[9:28] Christ he pointed us to the Holy Spirit
[9:29] praise God he pointed us to this
[9:31] wonderful black backed Bible brother man
[9:33] calls it amen hallelujah thank God
[9:38] he said uh Jehovah had not failed but
[9:41] Jehovah's servant had failed God failed
[9:44] Jehovah
[9:46] brother man said it used to be the
[9:48] entire Philistine country would tremble
[9:50] at the name of Samson he said just like
[9:53] people used to tremble at the name of
[9:55] Jesus
[9:57] right there used to be so much respect
[9:58] in America for the name of Jesus not
[10:00] anymore
[10:02] unless you're amongst the Believers
[10:03] praise God Amen Hallelujah then you
[10:05] respect the name of Jesus Amen and
[10:07] you're careful what you say about Jesus
[10:10] Hallelujah
[10:13] well Ram said Samson is a perfect
[10:15] parallel to the modern church today the
[10:17] church as a whole has lost its respect
[10:19] because the church has failed now
[10:23] I'm going to make a important point when
[10:25] brother is talking about the failed
[10:26] church it's not talking about us it's
[10:29] not talking about the Bride of Jesus
[10:30] Christ it's talking about the
[10:32] denominations
[10:33] who as we saw even a little bit on
[10:35] Sunday with all due respect we saw how
[10:37] there's a lack of reverence in some
[10:38] Services right everybody understand
[10:41] there's no praying before church it's
[10:42] just talking and laughing that should
[10:44] not be in the Church of the Living God
[10:47] you don't come to God you don't come to
[10:49] a courtroom laughing and joking with the
[10:50] judge you come to the courtroom in
[10:52] reverence and respect for the judge and
[10:54] the Bible said judgment begins at the
[10:56] house of God hallelujah
[10:58] amen now none of us are perfect and you
[11:00] know we just try to as you know too we
[11:02] just try to uh fit in and not be a
[11:05] rebuke on people but just try to Worship
[11:08] the Lord and try to be a real example
[11:10] praise God
[11:11] Hallelujah and so those cases you got to
[11:13] kind of wait till the spirit of God can
[11:14] fall amen wait to get the right Psalms
[11:17] up there wait till you get the right
[11:18] preaching then finally the spirit of God
[11:20] will follow praise God like I said I
[11:22] pray for two men Weeping at the altar
[11:23] there on Sunday morning two grown men
[11:25] I'm sorry one's almost grown he's 17.
[11:28] but almost a grown man
[11:30] Hallelujah
[11:33] he said God has not failed the church
[11:35] the church I'm sorry speaking of
[11:37] denominations have failed God Samson had
[11:40] failed God God never failed Samson
[11:42] brother in other places said Samson
[11:44] failed because he gave God only his his
[11:47] body he didn't give God his heart
[11:50] right he yielded his body to God when
[11:53] God would want to do great Miracles but
[11:54] he didn't give his heart to God he gave
[11:56] his heart to women
[11:58] and eventually Delilah see God but once
[12:01] both your body and your heart I'll say I
[12:04] guess he wants all through your soul
[12:05] body Spirit praise God we got to give
[12:08] God all of it praise God Hallelujah
[12:13] must not be like Samson just give you
[12:15] know one part of us
[12:17] or maybe two parts of us
[12:21] and of course you know we want to
[12:22] balance this out because remember he was
[12:24] put in the Hall of Fame of faith
[12:27] in Hebrews 11 so he served god well for
[12:30] many years but remember during that 20
[12:31] years after he lost that wife that he
[12:34] wanted that Gentile wife
[12:36] then he started visiting harlots and so
[12:38] forth after that
[12:39] and then he kind of got off and then
[12:41] look God brings him right back at the
[12:43] end God brings them back into Fellowship
[12:44] praise God
[12:46] and God puts him in the Hall of Fame of
[12:51] but not it's not about your mistakes
[12:53] it's about getting right with God
[12:56] God will put you and I in the Hall of
[12:57] Fame of Faith as well Hallelujah as the
[13:00] Bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[13:02] we can live the word of God just live
[13:04] the word that he's given to us how many
[13:06] can say Amen to that praise God live
[13:08] this word
[13:10] enjoy this word rejoice in this word
[13:13] that God has given to us
[13:15] brother Rand makes a whole point he says
[13:17] of the whole church he says he said
[13:19] today the church doesn't have ananias
[13:21] and Sapphira right
[13:22] it's very rare even in brother Adams
[13:24] meetings it's very rare for an ananias
[13:26] and Sapphire type of anointing where
[13:28] people will die if they if they lie to
[13:30] the Holy Spirit think about that most
[13:32] nurses are filled with people who lie to
[13:34] the Holy Spirit
[13:35] oh they act like everything's okay
[13:37] everything's okay but not at the early
[13:39] church
[13:40] right if they lied to Peter they packed
[13:42] him out dead is that right
[13:45] right brother said that was one proof
[13:47] that the church today has lost its
[13:49] sincerity
[13:50] remember Church the whole point of
[13:52] Brothers Ministry was to restore the
[13:54] book of Acts
[13:56] amen hallelujah
[13:57] so we believe we're being restored by
[14:00] the time of the Rapture if we're here or
[14:02] whoever's here it will be so sincere I
[14:04] believe it'll be like that praise God
[14:05] because it's got to go out the same way
[14:08] it came in
[14:09] that's the principle Alpha and Omega
[14:11] first and last Hallelujah I will restore
[14:15] all the years that the Paul worm came to
[14:17] learn locusts and caterpillar has eaten
[14:19] God's going to restore all that praise
[14:21] God
[14:24] think about that church walking into
[14:26] service and thinking I don't want to die
[14:28] I'm going to confess my sins
[14:30] will we live to see it I hope so by
[14:32] God's grace I hope so where everybody's
[14:35] so sincere they don't walk in that door
[14:37] until they've confessed all their sins
[14:39] right because we're all going to have
[14:40] one every day aren't we we're gonna have
[14:42] one sin at least one sin every day we're
[14:43] gonna make a mistake
[14:45] but that's what he says that's the
[14:47] comparison he's making like Samson
[14:48] versus the church Samson had great
[14:52] the church had this but then they've
[14:54] lost it but God is the god of
[14:56] restoration brother Brown said we have
[14:58] the keys to the kingdom
[15:01] plus we have the gifts of the Spirit he
[15:03] said but if we compromise we become
[15:04] nothing but alive and I don't believe
[15:07] that's us I believe that speaking of
[15:08] denominations
[15:12] he said Samson lost his power the church
[15:14] loses its influence of its testimony
[15:17] Hallelujah
[15:19] brother Adam said the the church in the
[15:21] days of Jesus had lost its power in
[15:23] Matthew 15. Jesus said uh you make the
[15:25] word of God of none effect by your
[15:27] Traditions Hallelujah so Creeds and
[15:30] traditions of men and dogmas right that
[15:33] make the word of God of none effect
[15:34] that's why we've always got to preach
[15:36] against sin if we allow sin it'll take
[15:39] all the power out but if we preach
[15:41] against the sin it'll keep the Holiness
[15:43] in the church praise God
[15:45] the program makes a statement like the
[15:46] churches they stop preaching about hair
[15:48] length and modest clothes and and Men
[15:50] drinking alcohol and all these things
[15:52] and and men being married three four
[15:54] times the Soviet deacons in the church
[15:55] and the church we've lived above that
[15:57] praise God by God's grace that's why I
[15:59] believe this is not referring to us
[16:01] praise God
[16:02] but but we still want more power the
[16:05] point is we want more of God we want God
[16:07] to restore the church like it was in the
[16:09] book of Acts praise God
[16:11] Hallelujah
[16:13] brother said you have to put mechanics
[16:16] with their Dynamics together
[16:18] he said Dynamics is faith in the word so
[16:20] just having if Jesus said it I believe
[16:22] it praise God
[16:24] right just having that that strong faith
[16:26] now mechanics he says those knowing your
[16:29] position and that's the part we preach
[16:30] on Sunday you have to find the will of
[16:32] God first amen amen so think about that
[16:34] church we have to say God can do it
[16:36] that's the Dynamics Hallelujah God is
[16:38] powerful God's Supernatural but then the
[16:40] mechanics is now let's find God's will
[16:42] for this
[16:44] right that's the balance I know my
[16:46] position I'm a son or daughter of God a
[16:49] sister can have a gift to cast out
[16:51] devils
[16:52] just like a brother that's the position
[16:54] I gotta know my position I gotta know
[16:56] what God's called me to do sisters can
[16:58] have gifts of Miracles
[17:00] Hallelujah
[17:01] I was just reading there in Josiah
[17:03] remember who was it that prophesied in
[17:05] Josiah it was a woman Prophet I forget
[17:07] her name does anybody remember her name
[17:10] uh it starts with a D
[17:13] uh Dinah or something like that it's a
[17:15] woman Prophet that came and prophesied
[17:17] Josiah because you kept the word of God
[17:19] God will not let you see evil in your
[17:21] day amen
[17:22] because we keep the word of God made God
[17:24] granted that we that we do evil in our
[17:25] day Hallelujah
[17:27] a woman prophetess Hallelujah so see I'm
[17:31] trying to raise the Faith of Our sisters
[17:32] now how about our brothers amen
[17:34] Brothers Let's be strong and courageous
[17:36] hallelujah amen amen let's lead the way
[17:38] with faith we gotta have faith and we
[17:40] got to have mechanics we gotta have
[17:42] Dynamics and mechanics we have to know
[17:43] God can do it believe God is here
[17:45] believe God is with us live a holy life
[17:48] but we got to have the mechanics and
[17:49] finally let's find the will of God who
[17:51] has the anointing on him to do this
[17:52] praise God
[17:53] amen
[17:56] Hallelujah
[17:58] and they told member brother and told
[17:59] the story of the man uh he was uh I
[18:01] believe a Luther he said I went to a
[18:02] Pentecostal meeting and all they're
[18:03] doing is kicking over chairs and
[18:05] screaming shouting speaking in tongues
[18:07] and and the man said now brother how
[18:08] could that be God brother man said these
[18:10] wise words he said if he said I don't
[18:12] know I'm not judging God in other words
[18:14] I'm not going to blaspheme the Holy
[18:15] Spirit right but then he says well why
[18:17] did they do it he said well they don't
[18:19] know their position so they're just
[18:20] trying to let the steam off
[18:23] Hallelujah but imagine if they could
[18:25] just get together with the the people
[18:27] that know the the position in Christ he
[18:30] said the Church of God would start
[18:31] moving on Amen
[18:32] [Music]
[18:40] so God can move right to the church
[18:41] praise God
[18:43] remember Church Peter preached a
[18:45] five-minute sermon and the Holy Ghost
[18:46] fell in cornelius's house I don't have
[18:48] to preach an hour and I'm going to try
[18:49] to push that through my head these next
[18:51] few weeks brother Austin I'm trying to
[18:52] cram that down my head I don't care how
[18:54] long I preach anymore now what I was
[18:56] trying to get through the thoughts but
[18:57] what I want to see is faith in the word
[18:59] of God we need to have faith in the word
[19:01] of God and get behind the word of God
[19:03] and let God move praise God
[19:05] if there's needs here let's call on God
[19:06] just like Samson amen he didn't sit back
[19:09] and just you know whisper he called on
[19:11] God hallelujah
[19:12] that's what we can do how many how many
[19:13] can do that tonight by God's grace
[19:15] you can call on God
[19:18] remember I said why should the church
[19:20] take a defeat why should Samson take a
[19:22] defeat you didn't have to but he had but
[19:24] he took a defeat because of his own sin
[19:27] but Robert said if we have Mark 16 how
[19:30] can how can we take a defeat these signs
[19:32] shall follow them that believe
[19:33] Hallelujah
[19:35] but Raph said we should at least be like
[19:37] the heat three Hebrew children that said
[19:39] uh King I don't know if God will do it
[19:41] but all he knows we will not bow our
[19:43] knee to this Idol
[19:45] that should be our our very least of our
[19:48] faith
[19:49] right if we get challenged or Satan
[19:50] challenges with sickness or something we
[19:52] should be able to say I don't know if
[19:53] God's gonna do it but I'm going to pray
[19:55] and ask God because I know he's willing
[19:57] and able praise God Amen yeah amen
[20:01] we cannot be ashamed of the Gospel in
[20:03] other words brother Adam says Satan I'm
[20:05] sorry uh yeah brother says Satan caused
[20:07] uh Samson's eyes to be plucked out he
[20:11] said that's what the enemy does he shuts
[20:13] off your eyes from the light of the
[20:15] gospel and you cannot see the gospel
[20:17] truth anymore you can't now seeing
[20:19] represents Enlightenment which
[20:21] represents understanding
[20:23] so when Samson's eyes are out he doesn't
[20:25] understand the gospel he doesn't he
[20:27] doesn't understand the move of God
[20:29] anymore he's in slavery
[20:31] and so that represents we don't
[20:33] understand something uh we don't
[20:35] understand what sin is doing to us and
[20:37] we're a slave and in some type of
[20:38] addiction and the church said
[20:41] amen the eyes are plucked out the
[20:43] understanding's gone
[20:44] and now just like Samson going around
[20:46] and around every week is the same every
[20:48] week is the same I'm still addicted to
[20:50] this I'm still battling this it's just
[20:51] it's a cycle the same cycle same cycle
[20:54] when we should break out of the cycle
[20:55] praise God
[20:57] Hallelujah
[21:01] said getting your sight back is Hebrews
[21:04] 13 8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[21:06] today and forever Hallelujah that's
[21:09] getting your sight back huh do you
[21:11] pronounce that Samson was captive by the
[21:14] nation that he was raised up to destroy
[21:16] he said it's a type of the Pentecostal
[21:18] Church 50 years ago
[21:20] so 50 years from that would have been
[21:22] 1913.
[21:24] right that was seven years after Azusa
[21:26] Street like we preached them
[21:28] he said but now Pentecost is divided up
[21:30] into many denominations he said
[21:32] denominations are cursed because they
[21:34] hand the move of I'm sorry they put
[21:36] their hand on the move of the spirit
[21:38] they stop Revival and the spirit is
[21:41] completely grieved away like again like
[21:43] we saw Sunday
[21:44] right denominations they don't they
[21:46] don't know about Revival they don't make
[21:48] a room for it they don't create an
[21:49] atmosphere for it but see we're trying
[21:51] to bring it in there Hallelujah that's
[21:53] right that's what the pastor was praying
[21:55] for brother Austin that we'd bring in
[21:56] the Holy Spirit praise God
[21:58] that's what he's been praying for like I
[22:00] told you
[22:01] people saying telling them oh it's got
[22:02] to be tongues he knows better not
[22:05] everybody speaks with tongues
[22:07] but the spirit of God will bring us to
[22:08] the word of God it'll make us thankful
[22:11] we'll give thanks Hallelujah it'll make
[22:13] us sing songs all the day Hallelujah
[22:16] it'll make us believe in Supernatural
[22:18] Hallelujah it'll make us get one Accord
[22:20] it'll make us love each other praise God
[22:23] hey man
[22:27] said let's think about what the
[22:29] Philistines were thinking of he said the
[22:30] Philistines he said although drunk he
[22:32] said alcohol was going down their beards
[22:34] they remembered that man Samson killing
[22:37] a thousand men with one Jawbone of a
[22:39] mule
[22:40] he said some of them remember Gaza when
[22:43] Samson carried the gates away
[22:46] he said maybe six tons
[22:50] he said they remembered Samson when the
[22:51] spirit of the Lord was on him
[22:53] but remember said some of them might
[22:55] have seen and heard that when that line
[22:57] came against Samson and Samson ripped
[22:59] the line in half remember there was
[23:01] honey right there was Honey in the eater
[23:03] not that great riddle Hallelujah
[23:07] and brothers at the church used to cast
[23:09] out Devils raise the dead and he said
[23:11] sin could not dwell among them
[23:14] he said the Holy Spirit would reveal sin
[23:16] as soon as it came into the church
[23:18] saints were blessed when a preacher
[23:20] comes or I preach or whoever we're
[23:22] blessed if our sins get called out we're
[23:24] blessed that's proof that the word of
[23:27] God is with us hallelujah amen amen
[23:29] right because none of us are perfect we
[23:31] all need God's grace but if we confess
[23:32] our sins God is faithful and just to
[23:35] cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[23:36] praise God Amen
[23:40] would it be something it's been so long
[23:42] since I've cast The Devil out now not
[23:44] that I wanted to show my power but Lord
[23:47] are there any more that you want me to
[23:49] do yeah is there a furthering of my work
[23:53] I've only done it one time on this soil
[23:54] as far as I know we're actually seeing
[23:56] the manifestations of the devil
[23:59] the other ones the other Sixers five
[24:00] times was over down there in South
[24:02] America
[24:04] but that's what I think about lord it's
[24:06] been so many years you've all heard my
[24:07] testimony so many times you just say
[24:09] okay I know what he's going to say I
[24:10] remember that testimony that's bad over
[24:11] in Guyana that's 2011. you you know you
[24:14] know
[24:15] right but God has done other things
[24:17] praise God
[24:19] and we're grateful for what he's done
[24:21] but let's not forget the church in the
[24:23] Bible That's the church we're trying to
[24:25] make our standard praise God Amen
[24:27] Hallelujah
[24:30] brother said God is Duty bound to
[24:32] manifest everything in this Bible
[24:35] and now get your Bible go to Psalm 71
[24:37] 18. somehow I came across this and I
[24:41] showed it to brother amen on Sunday
[24:43] Psalms 71 18. so Malachi read that when
[24:46] you got it sorry to put you on the spot
[24:49] but you were turning pretty fast so I
[24:51] thought I'd ask you
[24:52] Psalm 71 18 and this ought to remind you
[24:55] of something I read to you last month I
[24:57] think it was
[25:02] now also when I am old and gray
[25:04] and great oh God forsake me not life
[25:06] sure that strength into this generation
[25:08] and empowered everyone that is to come
[25:10] amen thank you Malachi does that remind
[25:12] you of something remember I read this to
[25:14] you a month ago what was brother Adam's
[25:15] prayer he wrote in his Bible
[25:18] I do believe every word in this Bible To
[25:20] Be Thy word help me to live and prove it
[25:22] so to my generation I didn't even
[25:24] realize he was quoting scripture
[25:27] that's already that was already a
[25:29] prophet's desire
[25:30] let this generation know that God is
[25:33] powerful amen amen so I said don't
[25:36] forget to keep telling that testimony
[25:37] about that sister that God healed keep
[25:38] out there in Arizona keep telling that
[25:40] testimony
[25:41] oh did you hallelujah amen I gotta keep
[25:45] telling about my mom's funeral I gotta
[25:46] keep talking about Jose's healing
[25:49] this generation needs to know that God
[25:51] is the god of power praise God
[25:53] amen
[25:55] help me to prove it he said he said Lord
[25:58] he said uh forsake me not until in other
[26:01] words don't let me die until everyone
[26:03] around me knows God's power Hallelujah
[26:05] man
[26:07] oh it's a great scripture in it
[26:09] Hallelujah remember God is Judy bound to
[26:11] his word if we can just get in the
[26:12] channel pray for Revelation and see
[26:14] which verses God wants to fulfill
[26:17] Hallelujah
[26:19] now brother says now let's go through
[26:21] what was going through Solomon's mind so
[26:23] now we know it's going through the
[26:24] Philistines the drunken Philistines he
[26:26] said let's look at Solomon's mind now
[26:29] he said he was thinking about all the
[26:30] victories he had and how the Lord had
[26:32] blessed him as long as he kept the
[26:34] promises of God he remembered his
[26:36] Nazarite vow which he for which he
[26:39] forsook he broke the vow of Separation
[26:42] now that ought to open our hearts right
[26:43] God help me to live separated to Christ
[26:48] let me not let sin into my life let me
[26:50] live separated like I promised I would
[26:53] Hallelujah
[26:55] he said brother man Samson realize I
[26:58] failed God's people
[27:00] remember the man said uh there was other
[27:02] compromisers like lot and Abraham lot
[27:04] was a compromiser but Abraham wasn't
[27:06] Abraham stayed true to the word of God
[27:08] he said lot didn't have enough courage
[27:10] and here Samson didn't have enough
[27:11] courage to overcome Delight of
[27:13] Temptation he said many women today or
[27:15] many preachers today are afraid to
[27:16] preach against women cutting their hair
[27:18] wearing a moral clothes committing
[27:20] spiritual adultery men having social
[27:22] drinks on Christmas and telling dirty
[27:24] jokes yet can remain deacons in the
[27:26] church
[27:28] amen he said Samson was reminded
[27:30] reminded of how he failed God and his
[27:33] people
[27:34] and brother Adam said I want brother man
[27:35] said I have no selfish motives I only
[27:38] have Zeal for the Lord he said this the
[27:41] very thing the Pentecostal people were
[27:43] called out to destroy they're now
[27:45] enslaved by
[27:46] see Pentecost was called out of
[27:49] denominations but then they just went
[27:50] and created denominations
[27:52] right and how do we know because more
[27:55] sin came into their churches that's what
[27:57] we've got to watch out hallelujah our
[27:59] church came our church started fresh our
[28:01] chart our church is a is a uh uh a brand
[28:04] new church nobody started this this
[28:06] church isn't a a church split this was
[28:09] started organically by the Holy Spirit
[28:11] praise God
[28:12] Hallelujah
[28:13] God started this church back in uh it
[28:16] would have been 2003 when brother Tim
[28:18] started those uh
[28:19] well I started the Bible studies I
[28:21] imagine I started the Bible studies when
[28:22] Tim started the Saturday night services
[28:23] back there while I was playing football
[28:24] I couldn't go to the Saturday night
[28:26] services here so we have both had some
[28:28] part in it
[28:29] Hallelujah
[28:31] but see we wanna we were called out to
[28:34] to come against the denominational
[28:35] system and we can't let sin make us a
[28:39] denomination
[28:40] brother answer the Pentecostal move was
[28:42] like a doll going back to its vomit
[28:45] let's not be like a dog going back to
[28:47] his vomit Let's Be Like an Eagle getting
[28:49] his strength back praise God I wait upon
[28:52] the Lord and God will renew our strength
[28:54] hallelujah amen let's not go back to
[28:56] Obama let's go back to flying in the
[28:58] heavenlies praise God
[29:00] amen
[29:02] listen to the sermon if you have in
[29:03] church
[29:05] whether answer the church ought to have
[29:07] a holy power in the church that will
[29:09] make demons flee
[29:12] he said what caused this Samson he said
[29:15] let a woman lure him away from his
[29:17] nazirite vow his separation from God
[29:19] he said she shaved off his oddness
[29:23] he said the church is supposed to be odd
[29:25] we're supposed to be a peculiar people
[29:27] but he says now the church tries to
[29:29] outshine other denominations
[29:32] Hallelujah we can't let the enemy shave
[29:34] off our vow to God
[29:36] we've got to keep our vows we got to be
[29:39] separate from the things of the world we
[29:41] got to live differently I gotta live
[29:42] holy you and I got to magnify Christ and
[29:45] live a separated life praise God Amen
[29:47] that's how you get the Revival back amen
[29:49] hallelujah
[29:50] that's how you do it
[29:52] we can't be lured away into Temptations
[29:55] we got to stay true to God's word
[29:57] that brother Ram goes into the the
[29:59] system the Roman Catholicism he said
[30:02] they're the mother of harlots and all
[30:04] the Protestants are daughters by Creeds
[30:06] and organizations
[30:08] brother man said Delilah kept wooing
[30:10] Samson remember day after day tell me
[30:13] your secret tell me your secret tell me
[30:15] your secret
[30:16] he said Delilah kept wooing him and made
[30:18] love to him until he gave in she took
[30:21] his secret from him and the same thing
[30:23] happened to the church he said at the
[30:25] Nicene Council 325 where idolatry came
[30:28] back in the church remember Constantine
[30:30] gave him all those he gave him all these
[30:32] uh buildings all these temples but yet
[30:34] there's Idols in those temples
[30:37] and the church let idolatry get right
[30:39] back into their into their lives yeah
[30:42] remember the history on that the real
[30:43] Believers weren't a part of that Council
[30:45] amen they were protesting that Council
[30:48] Hallelujah
[30:50] amen
[30:52] now look what brother says now some of
[30:54] you may be surprised at this I made a
[30:55] video about this a couple years ago
[30:57] got some slack for it but that's okay I
[30:59] don't mind people slack I don't mind
[31:00] people's
[31:02] but brother Adam said the mother heart
[31:04] of the Roman Catholic church wooed the
[31:06] church and shaved all the rights away
[31:08] from the church yes
[31:10] he said and he said this was prophesied
[31:12] and he said the prophecy was that
[31:15] brother Ram gave was in 1933 where uh
[31:19] the woman would have what would rule the
[31:21] nation and in this servant brother said
[31:23] it's not a literal woman it's the Roman
[31:25] Catholic Church
[31:27] Hallelujah right so many people think it
[31:30] was Kamala Harris or whatever
[31:32] but brother Adam said in this sermon he
[31:33] said it's not a woman it's the church
[31:36] he said that was a pair
[31:38] to Delilah wooing Samson
[31:41] the Roman Catholic Church wooed all the
[31:43] Christians to unite with the Catholics
[31:44] they're still doing it
[31:45] anybody that says that Pope is a
[31:47] Spirit-filled man they've got a wrong
[31:49] Spirit on them that's right
[31:50] that man's got an evil spirit on him
[31:53] that's right
[31:54] saying it's okay for homosexuality and
[31:56] okay for all these War all this all this
[31:58] uh sin it's not right Hallelujah and we
[32:01] can't we'll never buddy up with those
[32:03] people right we'll pray for them we'll
[32:05] be kind to them but we'll tell them the
[32:07] truth and we'll draw a line in the sand
[32:09] this is as far as I go Hallelujah
[32:12] if you invite me in I'll preach to you
[32:14] but I'm not inviting you to preach in
[32:15] our church
[32:16] Hallelujah I'll go on your ground right
[32:19] to declare the gospel but I'm not
[32:21] letting you give us a message
[32:22] the church said amen
[32:24] amen hallelujah know where we stand
[32:26] brother said the Roman Catholic Church
[32:28] is Delilah ruling the wooing the
[32:30] Pentecostals back into Fellowship he
[32:32] said how could a born-again church
[32:33] submit to the Roman Catholic Church they
[32:35] couldn't
[32:37] but the man said these uh these
[32:39] preachers seek a lld or doctorate degree
[32:42] he said but that's not how you become a
[32:44] preacher you've got to wait until power
[32:46] comes from on high just like Acts
[32:49] chapter 2 praise God
[32:51] he said what's the qualification of a
[32:53] Preacher
[32:54] he said it's not a fellowship card he
[32:56] said a fellowship card can't produce the
[32:58] Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[33:00] amen
[33:02] Glory
[33:05] remember the ram said Samson realized
[33:07] where he was standing he said and we
[33:10] must think what we must be by the Bible
[33:12] and program says these words he said a
[33:15] humble reverent Spirit-filled people
[33:17] look at that
[33:18] humble reverent Spirit-filled people
[33:21] that's why I said I believe that's what
[33:23] we are
[33:24] amen we're not the denomination brother
[33:26] man's rebuking we're not the church
[33:27] that's sold out we're not married to
[33:29] Roman Catholicism when was the last time
[33:31] I tried to offer you a uh prayer beads
[33:33] and say well sister who won't you pray
[33:35] to Mary why don't you try this Hail Mary
[33:37] I said pray to Jesus said I said you
[33:39] tell me pray to Jesus brother Jesse
[33:41] right we haven't yoked up with these
[33:44] people we're separate from them but
[33:46] we're a small Church we're a small
[33:48] church that just desires Revival
[33:49] Hallelujah
[33:51] we're a small church that wants more
[33:52] mechanics and more Dynamics Hallelujah
[33:56] because we go through battles we go
[33:57] through trials we just want restoration
[33:59] we want Revival hallelujah we're not
[34:01] joined with the Roman Catholic Church
[34:03] we're not a part of a curse of
[34:04] nomination but we can relate this answer
[34:06] because there's times we should be
[34:08] strong but we're weak instead and God is
[34:10] gracious just like he was to Samson
[34:12] Hallelujah
[34:13] hey man
[34:15] but man said Samson's hair started to
[34:17] grow out again
[34:19] and he cried out to God
[34:22] he cried to the Lord that's what we need
[34:24] today crying out to God Amen that's
[34:27] exactly right
[34:30] brother said Samson's hair grew out
[34:32] again and he said Revenge my eyes
[34:36] and then he said Samson thought perhaps
[34:39] there's a possibility
[34:41] Jehovah is full of love
[34:44] forgiving the iniquity of generations
[34:47] perhaps he would send the power and
[34:49] forgive me just once more
[34:52] amen I love it praise God our sins got
[34:56] us in trouble but it's God's love that
[34:58] leads us to repentance Hallelujah
[35:00] [Applause]
[35:03] he's the god of Grace Hallelujah
[35:07] said people today are satisfied to go
[35:10] along with the same Trend in other words
[35:12] they don't want to pray the prayer that
[35:14] Samson prayed
[35:15] they're just let's go along with it
[35:17] we'll get ready to die let's retire get
[35:19] ready to die instead of crying after God
[35:21] and say God what's more
[35:23] give me dreams for healing praise God
[35:25] help me to cast out Devils Hallelujah
[35:27] whatever you call me to do revive it
[35:30] again do it again all things are
[35:32] possible I want to die to all my sins
[35:34] Hallelujah
[35:35] because that's what it is for us it's
[35:38] not dying physical dying we don't want
[35:40] to die until it's God's time what we
[35:42] want to do is die out as Paul said I Die
[35:45] daily praise God
[35:47] that's what we need I've been encouraged
[35:48] the last two weeks some people have come
[35:49] up and said I want to be more dedicated
[35:51] and I want God to use me more how many
[35:53] want God to use them more and right and
[35:56] we have to remember our covenant we've
[35:57] got to remember brother said seven
[35:58] locksmen means seven Church ages right
[36:01] Covenant with God
[36:03] Hallelujah the blood of Jesus Christ the
[36:04] seven Church ages the Covenant of the
[36:06] blood of Jesus Christ he said I make a
[36:08] new testament a new testament in my
[36:10] blood Hallelujah
[36:13] amen
[36:15] but Ben said God doesn't have
[36:17] grandchildren he said just because you
[36:18] were raised in Pentecostal church he
[36:19] said people got used to that now look he
[36:21] makes a statement he said you have to
[36:22] pay the same price that the others paid
[36:25] now that that's what's so amazing about
[36:27] the Holy Ghost it's called a gift but
[36:29] then the Bible said God only gives it to
[36:31] the people that obey him right yes amen
[36:34] right yeah so so the easiest thing to do
[36:37] is take it back to Joshua that promised
[36:39] land was a gift but they had to believe
[36:41] the promises
[36:43] right they had to obey what Moses said
[36:46] they had to obey what Joshua said they
[36:48] had to pay the same price Hallelujah
[36:51] see the Holy Ghost is a gift as long as
[36:54] you and it will it always is and you
[36:56] just have to obey what God Said
[36:59] he gives the Holy Ghost to them that
[37:00] obey him oh it's a beautiful balance
[37:03] whether I have to ask these questions
[37:05] where is God proving Hebrews 13 8 I want
[37:08] God to do it right here
[37:11] Hallelujah
[37:13] I want you know your I want William to
[37:15] email me and say how's it going I want
[37:17] to say brother William Jesus Christ is
[37:18] the same yesterday today and forever he
[37:20] moved today in service praise God Amen
[37:22] or your your dad or your mom or your
[37:25] somebody you know your your uncle and
[37:26] somebody that you can say Jesus Christ
[37:28] is the same praise God
[37:31] you know they'll say our church is going
[37:32] through politics and we're trying to let
[37:34] homosexuals in but we'll say God is
[37:36] moving God's forgiveness of our sins
[37:37] he's saving Souls he's Healing The Sick
[37:39] he's speaking in tongues he's prophesied
[37:42] he's doing Miracles he's doing Divine
[37:44] Healing he's the surgery the thoughts
[37:46] and tests of our hearts amen
[37:47] he's given us dreams and prophecies he's
[37:50] foretelling US future events amen
[37:53] oh man
[37:55] Randy God where is God proving Hebrews
[37:58] 13 8.
[38:00] I told this brother amen
[38:02] God was doing so many wonderful Miracles
[38:05] right around
[38:06] 2010 11 and 12 because that's when cam
[38:09] preached this sermon at our church was
[38:10] 2010.
[38:12] and once you preached out I wet my my
[38:14] web I wept at the altar I said I'm going
[38:16] to preach more on the supernatural then
[38:18] we started seeing that's when my wife
[38:19] got healed of the migraines Miracle
[38:21] after Miracle after Miracle after
[38:22] miracle
[38:25] Hallelujah
[38:27] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[38:29] and forever where is God doing that so I
[38:33] know there's times and seasons for
[38:34] everything and I want to preach faith
[38:36] well Ram said Samson had the same ideas
[38:38] Gideon Gideon said if God's with us
[38:40] where's all the Miracles
[38:42] Hallelujah that was one of the sermons
[38:44] God blessed me the most anywhere I
[38:45] preached in this whole entire world this
[38:47] few places I've gone that's the sermon
[38:49] God has anointed more than any other
[38:51] sermon I've ever preached if God is with
[38:53] us where's all the Miracles Hallelujah
[38:56] that's a scriptural question to ask
[39:00] where's his miracles everybody said
[39:03] that's what a Christian asks
[39:05] it's not a bad thing to ask that it's a
[39:07] good thing to ask that
[39:09] because it makes you hungry for
[39:11] Supernatural moves of God amen amen
[39:14] Hallelujah
[39:16] program said Samson prayed right
[39:21] Lord let me die with the Enemy and
[39:24] there's a possibility that a prayer
[39:26] meeting might spark Revival
[39:30] brother Brown said
[39:32] Samson had to die to his enemy
[39:35] in order
[39:37] to get the power back everybody said we
[39:40] have to die to our enemy that's got us
[39:42] bound
[39:44] I'm talking about if we're battled if
[39:46] we're struggling if we like Reverend
[39:47] said in the sermon if you let the cares
[39:49] of the world in too much you get bound
[39:50] up by them yeah yeah and then you're
[39:52] worried about all these natural things
[39:54] which we got to take care of them but we
[39:55] shouldn't worry about them right
[39:57] right we gotta overcome we gotta trust
[40:00] God and we got we got to overcome the
[40:02] cares of the world and we got to have
[40:03] faith in God we got to have mechanics
[40:06] and we got to have Dynamics praise God
[40:10] said Samson prayed the right prayer and
[40:12] he said a prayer meeting Samson thought
[40:14] that might might spark my Revival
[40:16] Hallelujah
[40:19] oh it's a beautiful dog
[40:20] but Amanda said Samson knew what would
[40:23] happen if God answered his prayer he
[40:26] knew it would mean death
[40:28] Hallelujah
[40:30] so church we don't need a whole Revival
[40:31] of like nobody's born again or nobody's
[40:33] saved or word denomination we don't need
[40:35] that we need a Revival of our minds
[40:37] that's what we need today how many can
[40:39] say Amen
[40:40] that's what we need
[40:42] we need a Revival like Abraham and Sarah
[40:44] needed a Revival
[40:46] yeah after 24 years they shouldn't
[40:49] believed so God had to come inside
[40:50] himself and discern the thoughts and
[40:52] tense of their heart said I will visit
[40:54] you again
[40:55] I will give you a body change Hallelujah
[40:59] and the Holy Spirit I believe is here
[41:01] today to tell us that we can have our
[41:03] first love back
[41:05] we can be on fire for God we can have
[41:07] the Dynamics we can't have the dynamic
[41:09] mechanics we can have both of them and
[41:11] this car can run for God Amen
[41:14] I've always used the illustration of a
[41:15] car you got to have a spark and you
[41:16] gotta have the gasoline and all the
[41:17] mechanics you got to have all that
[41:19] together praise God and then God's Great
[41:20] vehicle can drive down the highway
[41:22] Holiness praise God
[41:26] now why does the sermon so much to me
[41:29] and I shared this with sir last year on
[41:31] August 11 2007 2007.
[41:35] brother Brooks dedicated our first tiny
[41:38] little building which you all sat in
[41:41] you did too yeah
[41:42] some of you didn't because you weren't
[41:43] born yet
[41:45] there's preach the dedicated
[41:47] dedication he preached from this quote
[41:48] and he used this quote but the man said
[41:53] he said if we could only stop like
[41:55] Samson did and think for just a moment
[41:58] of what we're supposed to be by God's
[41:59] Bible not keeping up with the Joneses
[42:03] he said not the shiniest biggest church
[42:05] and brothers read this he said we would
[42:07] be better off if we stood down at the
[42:09] alley in a storeroom and have the spirit
[42:12] of God back on us again the program said
[42:15] brother Jesse that's your church amen
[42:17] you're not some big fancy building we
[42:19] were behind the alley we were back
[42:21] behind the alley and that's exactly what
[42:23] it was and brother uh brookson said to
[42:25] top it off he said that was preached on
[42:27] your birthday brother Jesse that's what
[42:30] this is November 17 1963 right on my
[42:33] birthday my brand said you'd be better
[42:35] off if you're down with the alley and
[42:37] have the spirit of God on us that's all
[42:39] we've got Hallelujah we've got the
[42:41] spirit of God I've proved it we prove it
[42:43] on Sunday morning the spirit of God
[42:44] moved upon those men and women and
[42:46] brought them up to the altar
[42:48] weeping and crying saying we want the
[42:50] spirit of God here we want the spirit of
[42:51] God now we've got it but we got to ask
[42:53] for more of it praise God
[42:55] hey man there's more for our church to
[42:58] be restored to
[42:59] him we don't have as much power as we
[43:01] like to see
[43:03] right we want to we want to live more
[43:04] separated to God
[43:07] we'd like to have more testimonies to go
[43:09] share to others that Hebrews 13 8 is
[43:11] right in our church amen not because of
[43:14] what we've done but because of God's
[43:15] grace because we believed the Nazarite
[43:18] vow
[43:20] we've kept the Nazareth out brother the
[43:24] live by every word that proceeds on the
[43:27] mouth of God
[43:28] we're living according to the message of
[43:30] the hour
[43:31] that's why this sermon means so much to
[43:32] me and that was the same night that
[43:35] brother Brooks and I were walking after
[43:37] the service and sister Karen Sanders was
[43:39] there and she said I gotta talk to you
[43:41] brothers and she she started screaming
[43:43] and shouting thus saith the Lord and
[43:44] gave a word from Brother Brooks gave a
[43:46] word to brother Brooks and earlier that
[43:48] morning she wasn't here she was Earth
[43:50] that morning she was still in Lima she
[43:52] hadn't driven across the state and early
[43:53] that morning brother Brooks and I went
[43:55] to The Gorge and we were talking brother
[43:56] Brook said I feel a burden to this I
[43:58] feel a burden to that I need to do this
[44:00] and that's exactly all those things he
[44:02] said was exactly what the Holy Spirit
[44:03] told Brother Brooks
[44:05] and I was a witness so in the mouth of
[44:07] two or three Witnesses let every word be
[44:09] established amen
[44:11] so that was a supernatural day
[44:14] that was a supernatural moment
[44:16] and that's why this uh sermon means so
[44:18] much to me I looked in my notes I
[44:19] couldn't find where I'd ever preached
[44:20] just once more Lord

[46:27] there's two times the word revenge is
[46:29] used

[46:52] the pulling down of strongholds
[46:54] casting down imagination and every High
[46:57] thing that exalts itself against the
[46:59] knowledge of God and bringing in
[47:00] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[47:02] of Christ
[47:04] and having in a Readiness to Revenge
[47:06] what all of our disobedience
[47:09] when your obedience is fulfilled amen
[47:12] Amen in other words I'm going to get
[47:13] revenge against the sin nature that's
[47:15] inside of me
[47:17] I'm not going to say that again I'm not
[47:18] going to do that again I'm not going to
[47:19] think that again I'm going to overcome
[47:22] but it's got to be in your prayer like
[47:24] Samson said avenge my eyes they took my
[47:26] eyes
[47:28] right because of his own fault it was
[47:30] his own fault he couldn't blame anybody
[47:32] else he could say oh it's a pastor's
[47:33] father Deacon's song leader it was his
[47:36] fault praise God yeah yeah so he said
[47:38] avenge me of my eyes and the Bible says
[47:40] hallelujah the Bible said Jesus gives us
[47:43] I Salve so he can see so our eyes are
[47:45] open we can understand the truth we can
[47:48] see the situation the right way and then
[47:49] we can get revenge Upon Our disobedience
[47:53] and we can live different we can live
[47:54] higher the next time we can have both
[47:56] mechanics and Dynamics praise God
[48:00] and you remember in judges 16 30 Samson
[48:03] said let me die with the Philistines and
[48:05] he bowed himself with all of his mind
[48:06] and the house fell upon the Lords and
[48:08] upon all the people that were there and
[48:09] so the dead which he slew at his death
[48:11] were more than they which he slew in his
[48:13] life all things work together for them
[48:16] that love the Lord praise God
[48:18] it looks like his life would end in
[48:20] Failure but he stayed true to God he
[48:23] called out to God he said just once more
[48:25] Lord do something great may this work
[48:28] out so I can still be in the Hall of
[48:29] Fame of Faith amen
[48:31] Lord I serve you into pure heart but I
[48:33] got cold I got vaccine Revenge those
[48:36] mistakes and may I glorify you may I
[48:40] fulfill your purpose for my life

[48:49] he fulfilled the calling of God through
[48:51] death and that's why we Must Die daily
[48:55] a musician can come
[48:58] I'm going to read romance
[49:00] prayer as he closes the service this was
[49:02] in New York

[49:06] The Shepherd of the sheep come forth
[49:09] Lord these people are hungry gotta be
[49:11] hungry and thirsty for the power of God
[49:13] so you can't sit there and just you know
[49:15] I can't sit here and just be quiet like
[49:16] Lord maybe send your power tonight
[49:18] you've got we got to call it out to God
[49:19] for it I can't be the only one praying
[49:22] right it's got to be everybody
[49:24] Samson had to cry to God for it
[49:28] he said they're thirsting Lord years
[49:31] I've waited to see this happen maybe it
[49:32] will just once in our Lord one more
[49:34] great move of the spirit One More Time
[49:36] Lord and the church might receive the
[49:37] rapturing faith to go in now he's hoping
[49:39] the Rapture would take place
[49:42] granted Lord make known that you are
[49:44] with us and we will praise him for it in
[49:46] Jesus name we ask you he says
[49:49] then he says amen then he says I know
[49:51] it's not many words
[49:52] I know it ain't a long prayer but he
[49:55] knows my objective I mean it which means
[49:57] I meant it
[49:59] can Jesus live among us tonight now
[50:01] that's a good question can Jesus live
[50:03] here tonight
[50:04] of course absolutely because he's also
[50:06] living right here too but we like to see
[50:09] when he comes out and he lives amongst
[50:10] all of us and he answers prayer and he
[50:13] heals the sick and he discerns our
[50:14] hearts and he helps us in significant
[50:16] ways where where brother Jesse want to
[50:19] write down here's another testimony amen
[50:21] I wrote that testimony down from Sunday
[50:23] where the Pastor said
[50:25] like I told you somebody been
[50:26] encouraging you got to get them to speak
[50:28] in tongues and the people don't want to
[50:29] speak in tongues and he said Lord we
[50:30] just need to we just need the the true
[50:32] teaching on the spirit of God being born
[50:33] again and there it come he said it just
[50:35] flowed out of there
[50:37] amen that's what Jesus said he said open
[50:40] up your mouth and the word of God will
[50:42] come out like Living Waters praise God
[50:44] Amen
[50:49] he says can Jesus live among us tonight
[50:51] can Jesus once more come to us and show
[50:53] that he's the same yesterday today and
[50:55] forever as we've been taught
[50:57] aren't you glad you've been taught the
[50:58] truth I'm so glad I'm so glad I've been
[51:00] taught the truth Jesus Christ is the
[51:02] same yesterday yes he said is there sick
[51:04] or Afflicted or downcast and here look
[51:06] at that downcast anybody come to church
[51:07] a little downcast

[51:12] cards out he said but believe God would
[51:14] raise your hand say I'm in need brother
[51:15] random I pray God that he will speak to
[51:17] me
[51:20] he said a man can say anything unless
[51:22] God vindicates that then it's wrong he
[51:24] said now you believe and he goes into
[51:26] his prayer line he has no prayer cards
[51:28] he just starts Discerning he calls
[51:30] people out like I said he starts he
[51:31] starts seeing people's names spelling
[51:33] them

[52:23] comes around and heals our brother
[52:25] Hallelujah
[52:27] such a blessing let's bow our heads here

[53:33] Lord
[53:37] friends we are not this denominational
[53:39] Church we're not the ones not even close
[53:42] everybody here lives a Godly holy life
[53:44] when you make a sin what do you do you
[53:46] confess it
[53:47] but you go through battles
[53:50] and we need encouragement the best
[53:52] encouragement I've ever found is in
[53:54] God's holy word right here and if God
[53:56] had mercy on Samson God has mercy on you
[53:58] and I we've got better promises better
[54:01] Covenant
[54:02] [Music]
[54:05] Church none of us have done like Samson
[54:06] and all these people murdered all the
[54:09] all the times with Delilah immorality
[54:11] broke his vows all these things
[54:15] what I encourage you is trying to say
[54:17] you and I have Grace tonight
[54:20] we've got to hunger and thirst
[54:26] foreign
[54:30] this is what brother cam preach he said
[54:32] that quote he said there's a possibility
[54:34] that a prayer meeting might spark the
[54:37] Revival again
[54:39] I love that it's always meant so much to
[54:42] me
[54:42] possibility
[54:44] it's possible we're still here we don't
[54:47] want to be a denomination we don't want
[54:48] to live in sin we want to live holy
[54:50] there must be a possibility for God to
[54:53] move again
[54:55] I'm going to say let my let my desires
[54:58] die
[54:59] and let Christ live in me that's why I
[55:01] love that song so much as we
[55:02] Bring Me Back To Life
[55:05] let it be not Jesse Smith Living but let
[55:07] it be Christ in me living

[55:39] gift of pastoring Lord and we are
[55:42] grateful for the mechanics Lord God

[55:46] your Bible even says if you don't have
[55:49] the right Doctrine you don't even have
[55:50] the father and the son so we thank you
[55:52] for the uh the mechanics of the word of
[55:55] God
[55:56] but Lord we have a desire for the
[55:59] Dynamics of the Holy Spirit as I was
[56:01] telling brother amen how I'd like to see
[56:02] a paralyzed person walk
[56:04] how he would desire to see the dead
[56:06] raised
[56:08] a prophecy go forth
[56:11] foretelling something and it come to
[56:13] pass exactly as it would be
[56:15] Lord we desire the Dynamics of the Holy
[56:18] Ghost Lord
[56:19] God for Lord we've got to be in position
[56:21] we got to find your will Lord God we've
[56:23] got to seek for Revelation more than
[56:25] anything else dear God hallelujah
[56:29] Lord if we find ourselves like Samson
[56:31] going around and around as a slave to
[56:33] sin may we confess it may we ask for
[56:35] Mercy now Lord God oh Lord have mercy
[56:39] Lord God hallelujah Samson was willing
[56:43] to die to get the power of God back in
[56:45] his life Lord may we be willing to to
[56:48] die out
[56:50] to sins and cares of the world that the
[56:52] power of God might rest upon us Lord God
[56:55] granted Lord Jesus
[56:58] foreign
