come on up let's get in round Falls amen come on up here brother and then everybody can take a seat here by God's grace I just want to say that you know the Lord is good this whole week I was at work it was a good week you know it was always help helping you you know that meant a lot you know because it was a prayer Lord you know I need your help and the whole week just the whole week and God he gave me the help that I needed more than what I expected I just want to say he's good you know and if you know when we pray just believe all the time you know he's he loves us more than what we think and that we can imagine you know he's I was sharing with with several like my father-in-law which is a minister and another Minister and others that God's love never changes you know when he speaks it it's still the same acts the ask a bird they never change singing they sing you know all nature does the same thing you know his love is the same you know when we fall we make mistakes does his love lessons you know his love is eternal you know why because he sees the end he sees the end so his love doesn't change you know he always loves us no matter what and that's this whole week I've been dwelling on that his love hasn't changed in the valley love is the same up in the mountain you know the bursts continue singing every day they sing they haven't changed their tune you know the howling of a wolf hasn't changed neither has God's love God bless you all let's go to Acts chapter 2. verse 4. this is definitely a verse we want to memorize praise God Acts 2 verse 4. I'm going to get there as well how many were just so blessed by the weekend Services praise God we're so blessed listen to uh the morning service a couple times there again really really was blessed by that Acts chapter 2 verse 4 praise God let's read that on three ready one two three and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now let's go to chapter five here by God's grace this verses kind of came to my mind here verse 32 acts 5 32. so here we see again the conditions of how God pours out his spirit after we obey praise God verse 32 let's read that ready one two three and we are his Witnesses of these things and so is also the Holy Ghost whom God hath given to them that obey him so simple praise God let's buy our heads for one more word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you God for the word of God we read tonight we're coming off some wonderful Services God and I just pray God you Quicken your word further to us Lord God it's another opportunity to feed on your word Lord I remember what was preached on Sunday I thank you Lord God Lord and if we don't that's okay Lord because your grace is sufficient for this hour you see your people have made an opportunity they've made the effort to come out to the house of God they've obeyed your word by coming out here to the house of God lord surely you'll pour out a portion of your spirit upon each and every heart that wants to worship you and love you today Lord God so we thank you for this opportunity just use me Lord as your vessel and Bless the people Lord use them as well Lord if there's testimonies if there's intercessory prayer if there's a word of knowledge if there's a discernment Lord I pray God by the Holy Spirit you'll Minister now in Jesus Christ's name and Saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God a few uh a few quotes to show here by God's grace so yeah we're so thankful for Sunday and appreciate brother Cam and his family being here I was just so blessed um you know I was fellowshipping there with brother Chris and brother Cam and brother Chris was saying you know there was so there was numerous things brother cam was saying that brother Chris was thinking and before and right after brother Chris thought it brother cam would say what he was thinking and I looked at for the camera and I said as he looked at Chris I said brother that's the spirit of discernment discernment is judging the thoughts and intents of your heart right now how many elves felt like something you were meditating on God spoke to you on Sunday well look at that so I told Brother cam I said look brother cam I said there's one of the nine gifts operating right there in our minutes right and even while he went up for prayer brother Chris went up for prayer and he said I have this unspoken need and cam prayed the exact thing that he was battling Cam said the Lord just brought it to me my church says that happened to us before of course but it's just a great reminder that Jesus is here praise God that's what I was trying to just encourage all the saints you know the gifts of God operate often very often we just got to be able to Humble humble ourselves really and recognize them praise God like that one time when Lena prayed for my wife and that was just what she needed you know but brother amen needed someone to pray for him and sister Hua and prayed for him and that was a direct answer to brother amen's request you know so many examples we could give right of different ones when God speaks to us when God's ministering to us it's such a wonderful thing it's such a blessing it's a confirmation of his love to us Hallelujah and so I believe many of those nine gifts operate amongst us quite often and we just got to look at each and every testimony when we look at every testimony we could we can by God's grace said if you're not sure he said think on it for a while he said make think on these things real deep and he said you'll see which one it is by God's grace I believe that so I'm just very thankful for that and there's numerous things you know in did you see how brother Cameron was preaching on Peter and how he you know he would be anointed and then Fall Away anointed Fall Away even after he got the Holy Ghost and how many times have I mentioned that the last few weeks you know with discriminating against the Gentiles think about that discriminating Holy Ghost for men discriminating against the entire race of people yet he was filled with the Holy Ghost and then brother cam comes in here he's like I don't know why I'm preaching on this well I knew I was preaching on it right it's to confirm what God has been telling us praise God and then to take us higher right each sermon takes us one step higher if we'll receive it Hallelujah so I'm very thankful you know uh and as he said in the sermon he was led to preach by inspiration none of those things were really in his notes just a few things were in his notes so that tells me it seems the Holy Spirit wanted us to overcome any guilt any shame any doubts that we're saved right any doubts were born again if we really have a real genuine experience right and then as I'm preaching through this I'm sure the holy spirit will bring some of the subjects like I said I was so blessed I told Brother cam afterwards I'm like I probably got 10 sermons off of your your sermon if I can just take the time to go back and listen to him so by God's grace like one of them was you know Adam went and hid where I thought well I could preach a whole sermon on that all the different people that hid from God think about that Believers I'm talking about believers and now what about you and I when we hide from God is it is it because we're so good we go back to God it's the same thing as Adam God is that right church that's just one I could call Isolation part five hiding from God right Adam and Eve isolated themselves from the presence of God so you see how I mean the word of God is just it's unending praise God but I just want to I want to keep on this just for a few moments and since brother Ray's here you know I just want to just briefly review this uh this age started with the second greatest Holy Ghost outpouring of all time the day of Pentecost was the greatest brother Adam said Azusa Street he said was the second greatest now think about that it was greater than Nineveh when two when a quarter of a million people repented their sins right think about that 3 000 souls in the day of Pentecost that was greater than a quarter million because there was greater power with the New Testament Hallelujah it was more than just repenting of sins it was actually repentance sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God Hallelujah and then God anoints a one-eyed black man I had two eyes but he couldn't see out of one of them right couldn't see how the left I got anointed a one-eyed man a poor beggar man and through his love for God brings forth the second greatest Revival this world's ever seen Hallelujah now how many would say you're a part of that by God's grace amen absolutely what has what has brought you from death to life what brought you from the death of not really caring what the god or the message or the truth what brought you out of death and now you care so much you'll come on a Wednesday night after working hard all day praise God and some of you feeling sick and having flu symptoms you'll still come to the house of God whether you're rich or poor whether you're you're healthy or not healthy you'll come to God's house and give him praise amen what did that the love of God hallelujah the Revival that God started in your heart praise God and so it's a great thing we went through all the many of the details there but just you know just I just want to briefly say you know this was God doing a work and and God wanted to draw an eye to them so God Drew Seymour God Drew all those people unto him there's no man that seeks God right none of us seek after God God comes seeking after us praise God and so all these people did in Ebony Revival all they did was draw an eye to God because God was drawing them all they did was say Okay God you're drawing me I'll draw an eye to you too I feel I feel this pull I feel you wanted me to do this so I'll do this they just yielded to God's drawing Hallelujah and church that's what God's doing today God drew two people from Arizona right Hallelujah God drew our sister back after 12 years amen you God God Drew her back God drew me to him after running for 19 years amen I shouldn't say all 19 but you know because I wasn't even aware the first few years there was God you know 17 or 16 or whatever years you know we all the Bible said we're all born in sin shaping an iniquity come to the world speaking lies praise God but then God has a time and season where he Woos us he draws Us in love and we respond to his invitation and we start drawing close to him praise God Hallelujah because there will be no one that God will share his glory with God will not share his glory with any person praise God there'll be no boasts in her bragging in heaven praise God now I'm going to end with this there will be rewards but there won't be any bragging on that either praise God because it was all just responding to God's drawing and then once God drew them God gave them the power the ability God gave them the gifts they're God's talents those were God's abilities that was God's strength those are God's spirit moving that's all God hallelujah and the person just yielded to God okay now remember Church there are six kinds of Revival and this is important that we'll see in just a few moments I'm going to try to go through these uh briefly but there's National revivals we'll look at America's had at least two national revivals at least two maybe three um the church age Revival is those seven spirits that brother cam was talking about right he talked about the four guards but there's actually seven Spears Before the Throne of God and each spear represents the Holy Ghost going down to the world for each Church age and then that Spirit anoints a messenger preaches the message delivers a message and then he teaches Faithful Men and then other Faithful Men take that message around the world and that's the church age Revival Hallelujah and so if you're born again you are a part of that church age Revival praise God because the church age Revival never ends praise God in fact when this one ends it'll be the Rapture praise God because he that's holy is Holy still praise God he that's righteous is righteous still so we are and this is the Revival brother Adam said our Revival has been going on for 15 20 years and it's never stopped it was more than Divine Healing it was Soul healing praise God Hallelujah so that's the church age Revival is the baptism of the Holy Ghost from the spirit of God the spirit of God for each and every Church Hallelujah that's right now the latter rain I believe is still to come some people believe it's falling now I don't believe that I believe the latter rain is rapturing Faith it's the faith we receive right before the Rapture that's what I believe doesn't matter if I'm wrong or not because some rain's falling on us right now and it's the Holy Spirit rain praise God so whether I'm wrong in a slight of rain or whether I'm right in this form of rain it doesn't really matter as long as the rain has fallen on the right seed it's going to produce the right fruit praise God Amen praise God Hallelujah so it's not a it's not a point of major contention to me the fact is Lord Let It Rain On Me don't let me dry out praise God don't let me a starve for water keep me moist keep me producing fruit praise God don't let my leaves wither so people can't come and have Fellowship under my my leaves I don't want people to find stickers there and get poked by my by my flesh and by a bad attitude I want them to find leaves that are fresh I want them to find shade I want them to find Comfort I want the Divine words of love amen I want them to find words of encouragement like I really appreciate you sister keep going strong God's going to bless you God's with you praise God hallelujah God's blessing is right around the corner praise God you know just want to encourage people keep them uh satisfied in the things of God hallelujah now the sole Revival of course is the personal one-time Revival the soul is quick and the Bible said it's quick and in Ephesians chapter two we were dead in sins but then we're quickened with Christ okay that kind of ties you with a church age Revival but but it's on the individual level the personal level now this is what's happening in Asbury as far as understanding all the other churches they're having a human Spirit Revival right because brother Adam says a soul that is quick and says Amen to every word of God right and so if you told one of those people you know women you shouldn't wear pants especially sexy pants like you got on tight pants a real believer would say Amen right so we know we know they don't have the Soul Revival they don't have any of these it's not National this is the best they could have and it's even few out of those people right that are having Revival because Jesus said if you there be that find it right but Church you and I also need this daily Revival in other words when you leave here you should have a fresh love for God you should feel more determined to be faithful to God tomorrow praise God you should be more determined not to let up on God this week praise God Hallelujah you should be more excited about listening to the sermon again or don't listen to Sundays again or you should have a greater hunger for the things of God if not you start dying out we got to be revived God make it fresh again make it new again feed my soul lord I want to meditate on the things of God make it new praise God revive me and of course the last one is uh resurrecting from the dead the physical Revival and that's according to Romans 14. now again a little bit more on the Asbury Revival I put that video out on Saturday I've got some good feedback and some negative feedback we'll skip past uh yeah I'll get to this in a moment I actually did a podcast about it as well just a really short one if you're interested in that but now what's the sad part though is some message Believers are making themselves God or the judge over all these revivals and they say they they're saying nobody can get saved in them what a bunch of nonsense now Church they're close to blaspheming the Holy Ghost if God Saves one person out of there and they say there's no revivals of the devil they just blasting the Holy Ghost see and they're they're exalting themselves like they know the thoughts and intents how can they know the thoughts and intents of every heart there they can't they're not God right and they fail to acknowledge and this is what I did on the video I showed five or six Brothers quotes where brother Adam says he said if a Catholic is trusting in Jesus he's saved right he says if a Lutheran a Methodist that's good is trusting in Jesus he said they're saved because we're saved by grace Hallelujah now a few of them are because a lot of them are trusting in the pope my brother Adam said God's got children in all of out there in all those systems what do you do with those quotes well now now you see what they've done is they made themselves God they made themselves the savior they made themselves the next prophet and they're not Prophets hey man they're not right and so see they they think there's something when they're not okay and then they don't recognize all these different kinds of revivals that the Bible plainly teaches there's Bible examples for every single one of those Josiah had a national Revival Hezekiah had a national Revival Solomon had a national Revival for a while until he fell away with his thousand wives right yeah they they had National revivals okay but see you know I have friends that know friends that are at the Revival and friends that had similar friends and some of these people are genuine Christians now they're not fully Sanctified but they're beyond Justified and they have cleaned out some of their lives because I met them and so and if you do that then you do away with the foolish virgins if you say nobody's getting saved in there you've done away with the foolish virgins you're breaking the word then yeah but a real Holy Ghost to a person doesn't break the word he believes the word amen that's right see the foolishness of people to make statements like like they like they know everything God's in control even if one Soul gets saved out of there that one had an individual Revival of the human spirit right he said I'll give you a new heart a new spirit my spirit well they probably won't get to my spirit right unless they received a message and get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and sanctify their lives and cut off the TV cut off the evil videos on their phone I mean they probably won't get it praise God but at least they could get Justified and Sanctified amen or a little bit of sanctification now I just want to read this here brother this is the quote brother says America will never have a national Revival smoking cigarettes hybrid is Right hybrid they don't even know whether they're a man or woman now he said this in 1960. and now we got people today don't even know if they're a man or woman and they have surgeries to change uh their identities and brother bran was basing that just on the length of the hair as he says you can hardly tell what sex they belong to by looking at them and listening to them that's true friend I'm not saying that about you as a Christian woman my voice is going around many nations it's but it's a hybrid this America has become condemned and what did she do according to the vision she elected the wrong person JFK I don't know how long it'll take to run out but it will be someday thus saith the Lord it will she's on her downward move right now she'll never come back again she's gone that's right she's been gone since 1956 when she condemned and turned away God from the great Revival hours now 1956 was 50 years from 1906. what's 50 years Jubilee right so brother Adam says there was a spiritual Jubilee available in 1956 if you study history that's your Elvis Presley rose up to fame that was the year and that's the Year rock and roll took over shortly after that the Beatles Rolling Stones and it's just been total satanic chaos ever since but that's a year America is going to turn back but they chose it Judas Iscariot they chose a Barabbas rather than Christ right and that's that's about the Year brother man I started going down less invitations but really in the spiritual he was going up amen hallelujah because he still had to open the seals he said to preach marriage and divorce anoint the ones of the end times praise God what's the attraction on the mountain he started to preach all these wonderful messages these Revelations he had to finish the mystery of God but even though America's on the way down the bride's on the way up praise God now the U.S has had at least two national revivals now the first one was before we were actually officially a nation Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield and I don't have much on them but I took out all the details I just kind of cut their names out but what was shown was that the majority of people in the U.S were churchgoers after the Revival happened before the Revival there was a a smaller percentage but after the Revival most people got back into church through the preaching of the word of God in fact history says Jonathan Edwards was the first he was the first celebrity in America because he preached such powerful messages the people would flock there and of course that would be a good thing if he's preaching salvation praise God and the second one came in 1800 to 1840 James McCready and you probably know Charles Finn he's called the father of Revival just prayer dedication to God's devotion now I don't know if 1906 was a national Revival or not I don't know if it went around the nation from coast to coast was very likely very likely it was the second greatest outpouring but I haven't read that so I don't know for sure but brother Adam said anyway whether it was or not brother man said 50 years later they had a chance to get it back and they turned it down America turn it down okay and I think I showed you the stats by 2030 um uh it'll finally be the spot where uh the majority of people will not be Believers in God in America on the pace that it's at now less and less people are believing in God it's finally going down until finally Believers in God will for the first time ever be a minority in this nation because of the Godless Society because people are not coming to God anymore they're not hearing the preaching they're not uh they're not feeding on the things of God they're lovers of their own selves more than lovers of God Hallelujah now I want to look into this revival a little bit so just bear with me here the Welsh Revival from 1904 to 1906. now this I say question mark was a national Revival some people say it was others say it wasn't so I just wrote a question mark I personally believe it looks like it was a national Revival so there's there's the man uh who's most associated for the Revival Evan Roberts now remember this was the Revival that friends of William Seymour went and and sailed across the ocean to learn how to have Revival and church remember what that key was praying in your home house prayer meetings yeah Hallelujah that's the key in other words praying to God in love having more as brother Camp said more communion with God Amen Hallelujah and he's got he's got a really wonderful history he's raised by Godly Parents he was so devoted to God he never got married because he knew God had called him just to be an uh revivalist he knew it he never just who does that remind you Saint Paul St Paul he never got married because he knew God had called me and he tried working in Coal Mines he tried working in different places and all the economy went down and so he had prayed all these years he had visions of Jesus and then when all the economy went down he was forced just to go uh to the Christian college and become a minister but then that's where he really started seeking God so see how God works everything out in your life God may have the economy go down to put you at the right position or God may have the economy go up to put you in the right position right in other words God has ordered your footsteps God's going to do something with your life and if you just yield to it then God will be well pleased praise God is a plan for every life praise God and the thing to do is just surrender to his will praise God how do you know it's his will because it aligns with the word of God hallelujah very simple it's usually more simple than we think really God's will is usually way more simple than what we think it would be right oh so what was Paul let's look at Paul what was his will what was God's will for him to be a light to the Gentiles Church what if your desire what if you're calling is be a light to your family what if that's your call would you be happy with that Hallelujah or would you get mad at God for that no Paul Paul just said okay Lord I'm Yours help me to Die daily praise God help me to Die daily so I can be a light praise God but he had a calling from God seems like from the womb to bring this revival now these this is what their services were like they had powerful preaching intense prayer and sometimes uh that should be uninhibited I'm sorry I forgot to it's not inhibited it's uninhibited sorry forgive me I forgot the U.N there yeah it's uninhibited Worship in other words you don't care what anybody thinks you're just going to worship God Amen you're going to let the praise flow you're gonna let the Holy Spirit flow out of you praise God Amen now it actually started uh in another location at a different Church the pastor was named Jenkins in the spring of 1904. now Evan Roberts didn't get into it until later in September but here's how it started they're having Youth meetings and one humble little teenager stood up and said crying I love the Lord Jesus with all my heart and the whole church wept that started Revival that's why I like brother Ray's testimony God's love will never fail you just Simplicity God loves you a teenager stood up God was going to take his gospel to this entire nation and who to use a humble little town like Mary praise God humble little teenager all she did was surrender to the Holy Spirit and say Lord Jesus just tell everybody I love the Lord Jesus with all my heart and then the next week more youth came to the meeting next week more and more and more pretty soon these youth meetings started growing that's how it started nothing big nothing big but that's big right you understand nothing big to the world standards but to God that's great praise God because what did Jesus say the greatest commandment is love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength don't hold anything back love God with everything you've got Hallelujah producer Revival in other words all the people in the church recognized I want to love the Lord with all my heart in fact in other words all the people realize I'm coming to church but I'm not really loving God with all my heart I don't think that's the case here because some of you have stood the test of time you've been saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost God's used you in gifts but I love the humility of just coming back to your first love for us it would be that it would be us just coming back to our first love I'm never going to take anything away from your Christian experience because if you're still here after all this preaching all this singing if you're still here you've got a real experience praise God hallelujah amen the Gates of Hell could not Prevail against your Revelation amen who gave it to you your father in Heaven amen I didn't give it to you nobody gave it to you God gave it to you praise God so in these meetings it was really started by a lot of teenage girls you see you little sisters now look at they're little girls right now look at this one two they're just four five right there in a row now here let's fast forward 10 years we're gonna have this row and they're all gonna be teenagers or maybe Beyond adults having already 11 right I always forget one of these days I'll I'll get your your ages but a whole nation was impacted because teenage girls started singing praying and testifying about Jesus's love and it attracted people Hallelujah this is the kind of service they'd have they would just break out in Praise like I love in our church when somebody would just shout in the spirit and it wasn't planned except by God right I love that or someone will just come up for prayer and I didn't even call for a prayer line you know you can do that Hallelujah you know this altar is open church I'm gonna have to buy an open sign right I'm gonna buy open sign I'll plug it in and before service I'll pull on that click open open open how about that God loves spontaneous things when you're following the leadership of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah God loves spontaneity spontaneity there it is sorry someone would come for prayer without even being asked and this is what the pastor said the eyes of all are filled with tears when the girls pray girls so Azusa was one man William Seymour with a few family with a few couples but Wales was young girls teenagers it looks like we got a pretty good opportunity to have a Revival here we have a lot of teenage girls here in about five or six years Hallelujah it would either it would be their generation Revival it'd be their Church age Revival because remember you can have a Revival of just 12. sure Hallelujah the Ephesian Church started with just 12 got the Holy Ghost have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe we didn't even know there was a holy ghost all we knew was Jesus was died for us he's resurrected he's alive that's all we know he said what were you baptized unto John's he said be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid their hands on them they spoke in tongues and prophesied amen oh one of these days the Holy Ghost is going to fall on our little ones praise God hopefully on our old ones too amen our young ones are middle-aged all of us is what I'm saying Glory the girls would read psalms and then they would ask for certain songs to Be Sung history says drunkards came into the services left they came in mocking they left out praising God and I love this what they said it was always easy to pray and preach it like tonight it's really easy to preach I don't feel anything withhold of me because we had such good services on Sunday so y'all must got the Revival these last few days huh Hallelujah Glory it's easy to pray now that's the thing easy to pray now let's be honest about that I'm now just think about the battles we have how many times is it easy to pray sometimes right sometimes we'll say sometimes but this is that this is the atmosphere Revival where you're drawn into prayer right you're drawn into it you're drawn into worship drawn into the sermons you're just drawn into God you're quickly drawn into that I mean you'll have battles every day but right but you're more quickly drawn into that oh God drove us into that praise God draw us into that Hallelujah and then the one one the pastor Jenkins said 20 year old girls were prophesied so you had teenage girls and they were the 20 year olds were prophesied for a few months here this was uh what month was that well it's spring okay I think it was April actually April May June July August so about six months the little Revival went on just they would just go to service come back sometimes their service will last till 10 pm I was reading there sometimes midnight sometimes you know less but they just wanted to stay in the prince of God at church how many times have we been on a Wednesday night and brother Jess just won't close because he's got to sing another song or I preach no longer or we have a longer prayer line now think about that what are we experiencing we're experiencing Revival but it's a church age Revival thank God thank God we got that one praise God Hallelujah and that's great the main thing is that a Revival produces love for Jesus Christ and the love of God is expressed it's received from God and it is expressed to man Hallelujah amen no I'm going to make this larger I don't expect anybody to read that that's beyond your eyesight potential so the spirit though begin to fall on average Evan Roberts meetings in September of the same year now by October he learned these steps to obeying the Holy Spirit now these are just simple things we already know him but I just want you to see this is what God taught a man who went from service to service to service to Revival sir he was not married so he could just spend all his time praying and studying the Bible Hallelujah well I'll tell you what I'm glad to be married I love being married I love having kids but you know some men are called me eunuchs the Bible says born from their mother's womb amen and church I'm actually as a great reward in heaven if he was obedient I'm sure he wasn't he was obedient to God's call for his life but so can you have a great reward in heaven praise God and there's no greater reward Than Just to See Jesus like we've said that many times I don't care what it crowns I don't care anything imagine don't talk to me about that talk to me about Jesus just let me like I said let me lay at his feet for 10 000 years Hallelujah now he was talking about one Service uh he was explaining how to get the spear the spirit was clearly helping me I prayed three times during the service 16 stood up to confess Christ praising the other was a little girl the spirits working with power we come out of the meeting at 10 pm and no one was tired one very young woman remarked I thought it was only 9 pm very good the testimony of others was we have never had such meetings before this is the beginning of the Revival there in Wales the spirit's influence is already powerful over these people now think about that church how many times have we left here it's 9 30 or 10 and yet we're not tired we could have took the service a little longer anybody can say Amen to that doesn't happen all the time but that's that that's that's that's that's the joy of Revival that's the love of Revival that's the refreshing of the spirit praise God see now now here is this the planet this is from his journal this is the plan I've taken under the guidance of the Holy Spirit these four things are to be right so this is what he says if you do these things you'll have Revival there's if there's some sins or sins in the past not confess we cannot have the spirit therefore we must search and ask God to search us up brother Adam calls that thorough repentance right so if we want more of God it's just very simple just confess all your sins we know we're going to have them Paul said I Die daily that means he would sin every day he didn't say I die every once in a while he said there's two laws battling in my mind right there the law of the spirit then there's a law of the flesh he says the things I want to do I don't do the things that I hate that's what I do so I've got to die every day there's nothing to be ashamed about in that the thing to do is die amen the thing to do is die and get right with God hallelujah verse number not verse number two the Second Step if there's something doubtful in your life it must be removed that is something of which we are unsure as to it being right or wrong this thing must be removed so there's a question in someone's life they've got to answer that right the Bible said anything not done in faith is what sin the Bible says that if you're not sure it's got to be taken out of your life because it's probably sin okay now before we can move on think about the times you felt closer to God were you doing these could you look up there and say yes yes all I cared about was God all I was obedient to God how many could say Amen to that you weren't thinking about you know simple things or you weren't compromising you were just what all in you were just fully surrendered praise God right three total surrender to the spirit we must do and say all he asked us to do and then for a public confession of Christ all right uh uh I had two students I saw former students of mine I saw my Aldi last night and their dad comes up he said hey Mr Smith how you doing I said I'm breaking but this is what this was a public confession of Christ he said were you smoking out in the hall out in the parking lot no I had five of my kids with me I'm like no and uh he's like well my girl said you were smoking I'm like no I don't smoke I said I'm a Christian and he goes then he goes like this right in front right Audi he's like huh but someday you'll smoke right someday you'll smoke when you retire I said no sir I'm never gonna smoke I'm a Christian I got a public testimony for Christ right I walked into Chick-fil-A on Monday I had the day off this President's Day thank God for the presidents because I get a day off my Jesus hat on this woman walks by she's probably in 50 she's like oh I like that hat I just love her those moments right I said Jesus healed my mama cancer and she took a few steps and she said Jesus healed my husband to cancer and she walked out I said hallelujah praise God I got a public testimony for Jesus amen see and he says these four things lead us to the Grand blessing now this is what he learned you know this is before this is before laodicea church age right there's the end of the Philadelphia Church I just want to show you how simple this is in other words confess all your sin draw an eye to God and God will draw night to you praise God very simple very simple and this is what transformed a nation transformation so now church this is what I told you earlier he he was married he was not married so he gave himself fully to this revival and you should see his journal he has service almost every single day sometimes multiple times a day so in 1906 he could barely stand he had exhausted himself so much so much prayer fasting preaching praying can you imagine not being able to stand for a year you have no physical power to stand up because you've given all your strength for Christ now that's literally uh wearing out right not rusting out but wearing out but imagine I'd rather wear out than rust out that's exactly what Evan Roberts did he wore himself out until he couldn't almost stand for a whole year sir God's not asking Church God's not asking all of us to do this God's just asking us to do what he called us to do he was born for this and church this was a love for him before he started this revival he said Jesus would appear to him for four hours it was from like 12 midnight to like 4 a.m and then he got a job after that and he said he wept and cried because the job made him he had to sleep and then then he only had 30 minutes of prayer with Jesus and he said he would weep and cry that he he missed out on the other three and a half hours a church that's a deep love for Jesus four hours of prayer or just reading your Bible think about that four hours just reading the Bible to God getting up and down on your knees and reading the Bible up and he would weep that he only had 30 minutes to do it I'm just showing you these are these are heroes of the thing yeah Heroes I think it's beautiful now why I preached out so that it'll it'll encourage us to long just long for 30 minutes with God or if you're a mother maybe long for five minutes with God before the kids wake up and come tackle you or whatever they do or ask you to put their shoes on like Zion likes to get his shoes on right away in the morning I don't know if he does that anymore he did in the summer but he so warms self out he couldn't stand for once now look at that he worked so hard for two years he had to take a year off of ministry so he missed out no no doubt the devil said see look at you you disobeyed God now you can't preach for a whole year but I I I don't think he let the devil defeat him on that he probably said This is My Season of rest this is my juniper tree time amen I'm labor for God and now I'm getting my juniper tree praise God and then a couple years later he devoted his time to prayer publishing magazines books and then about 11 years later he went for his final Revival meetings for a couple years and then church he spent probably the next 25 years just doing the following poetry writing poetry praying Publications see Revival is like like group revivals don't last forever that's why you don't feel bad about anything here tonight we don't have to feel bad about anything when and brother Brown's going to say it later brother says when God wants to sovereignly move nothing is going to stop stop God nobody here can stop God when God wants to move an amazing way with five hours of prayer or seven hours of prayer or four hours of study or two years of laboring until you can't even stand when God wants to do so that sovereignly God's going to do it he's going to find the vessel to do it and God's name will be glorified praise God it's God's Sovereign move well Graham says he says a preacher doesn't bring a Revival in his briefcase now today it's a preacher don't bring a Revival on his iPad or his laptop whatever one she's got right Revival don't come from a man Revival comes from God hallelujah it's a sovereign Act of God he died at 72. now earlier I thought he died younger but no he died at 72. this just goes to show God had a specific time and season to to fully exhaust all his energies all his strength but then he had a season of rest afterwards just like Seymour he had all in a few intense years of Revival but then he had Seasons where there wasn't three services a day there's Seasons to this God has a time how many know God has a time and season for everything how many are glad God has a time and season for everything I'm really glad especially when it comes to trials I'm glad the trials eventually end hallelujah praise God I'm glad the seasons of mourning eventually end then we get the season of Dancing again amen praise God little man now he's talking about the Welsh revivalists this was Evan Roberts Revival he talks about uh he talks about Billy Graham having a Revival she's 30 30 000 will come in in two weeks and give their hearts to Christ and go back and you ain't got one now that's not a Revival see that's an emotional plea brother Rand calls it an intellectual faith see they hear Billy Graham preach they say Okay I want to give my life to Christ I make a decision for Christ but it was never real repentance but look at you where are you guys at you're here still repenting worshiping God loving God you had a real Revival praise God you're still here and three months later or two weeks later you're still here praise God that's right see that's Billy Graham's got the mechanics he's got the preaching to bring a Revival but let God in a Sovereign Grace just speak to some little nitwit as to say a little nobody let his Spirit fall into a city and man can't go to work women can't wash dishes the maid can't make a bed of screaming and crying with their hands up in the air that's Revival that's in the will of God now notice there's never a Time brother Branham had this because that's speaking of a national Revival right we have nothing on tape where mother says well I didn't go to work because we had a national Revival there's nothing on tape Hallelujah so brother is making the point God has a sovereign time for Revival in your family God has a sovereign time for your personal Revival amen Hallelujah God has a sovereign time for everything praise God and God's going to accomplish his will our desire though is just yield to the Holy Spirit praise God Lord whatever you want in this season of my life help me to yield to it praise God see Evan Roberts for years church for years he would he said I could stay up till all the hours of the night just talking to my friends about Holy Ghost revivals for years so see church I don't mind if we're if we're on the waiting game we're gonna wait for a couple years so we really see more of God that's fine that's what I want my mind on I want to set my affections on things above praise God not things that are on the earth things that are above praise God and remember it can be as simple as a few teenage girls shout in Praise And Weep and glorifying God sing and testifying prophesying speaking in tongues filled with the Holy Ghost whatever it may be that could be the Revival that we're longing for and praying for Hallelujah we got to let God interpret his word amen gotta let God have his way and you know the story brother man I said uh the Americans went over to Wales and wanted to see the Welsh Revival they got off their ship with their tall hats on round collars a little policeman was swinging his Club around like that and said my good man can you tell me where the Welsh Revival is yes my brethren you're standing in the middle of it in other words when you're standing in my presence you finally got to Revival amen church we should all be able to say that praise God when you when when people come into our presence you've now come to akron's Revival praise God hang around me for a while you'll be revived amen right see he had to go to work but he was had a song in his heart singing at work right sister who sing it over hallelujah what do I do I dance at work at bible Club Hallelujah I dance around my classroom for Jesus you just you just love God on the job you understand the Welsh Revival because the Welsh Revival is in me praise God that's Sovereign that's what God does and he alone has a right to send Revival not get the mechanics together it's pray to God to send the Dynamics Hallelujah so that's what we're looking for we're looking just for more of God and whatever God wants to bring in our church we got to let him bring it to the church praise God we've got to invite Jesus every service keep say faithful to Jesus love Jesus confess our sins thoroughly repent of everything and then let the spirit move praise God like I was telling my barber today today I walked I got a haircut right before church and it would just let a God I walked in there there's nobody in there and he said I got a lot of questions for you about God I said well this is the right time because nobody's in here it was just brother Jesse and the barber yeah so I appreciate him for the next 30 minutes it was awesome he mainly wouldn't know what about people that don't hear about Jesus and the age of accountability that was the main I got to preach about the baptism Holy Ghost he's like what are the three steps of Grace what what are you talking about I didn't know that's in the Bible he said he said honestly I don't even go like going to church it's so boring I said you got to find a place where the spirit of God is moving I said some Services going to be Divine Healing some service is going to be repentance at the altar Hallelujah some service is going to be the mysteries of God are going to be revealed well I never knew that before God just opened my eyes a truth would just unveiled to me praise God some server is going to be teaching you this is how you pray do this this this this is how you get close to God this is how you have a Revival you understand some services are going to be on love and forgiveness and never one of them is boring because God's here amen God just help us to get out of the flesh for a few minutes and we all need help at times I'm not condemning to anybody I'm in there we all need it praise God but we can all feel when it starts to change to the Holy Spirit you're right the beginning middle end like brother cam was saying we can all start to feel when God starts dealing with people's lives praise God alone has the right to send Revival so I just love God and I'm just going to be waiting here for when God sends the next Revival attack Hallelujah thank you Jesus now here's one these are these are from a book by Reverend he was talking about how this revival affected the nation a story was told of how the horses and the mines were confused because once they were driven by men with use of obscenity and kicks but now there were any this revival is so powerful the animals were affected the animals are like why aren't you kicking why aren't you cussing at me because the movers the the Riders of those animals now had love in their hearts right come on Cherokee come on take us down there real gentle we said get moving horsey you know whatever I never rode a horse I don't know I don't know what I'm talking about but see it was instead of anger and cussing and swear now it's sweetness and humility I'm so thankful for this job I'm so thankful for this opportunity I'm not going to cuss and swear and complain my way through life I'm going to give God praise amen I'm going to be thankful I'm going to spend my time showing the sweetness of the Holy Spirit praise God how many people have I come had come up to me this year with the class that I have this year how many people have I come up to me and they told me brother this is not in the brothers this Mr Smith you're a special kind of a person you're a different kind of a person they would say you have the patience of a saint I'm like well I am a saint I am separated to Christ that's what I should have but I always say it's all by the grace of God because God's not going to give glory to me we're supposed to let our light shine as a light that's a city on a hill that cannot be hidden let your light shine before men and then people will glorify the Father which is in heaven when they see the love of God in your life so animals got confused after this revival Hallelujah the Revival sees the nation that the mill published Revival editions so the newspaper started instead of talking about trash they started talking about the Revival how often does a religious news take front page in a national and secular newspaper in these editions Revival news superseded current affairs and testimonies replaced tabloid telling them how the route Welsh were more interested in God in his kingdom than the Affairs of the world this tells you the uh the reporters got converted right because they could have attacked the Revival but the reporters the newspaper reporters got converted and instead of tests writing about trash they wrote about God's treasure amen Glory it's kind of like Chris Chris was posting evil things on Facebook until he got saved when Austin invited him to church same thing the author the heart of the author changed hallelujah amen the newspaper article writers their hearts change so their posts change when you get Jesus Christ in your life your posts are going to change your interests are going to change it's all Jesus from then on praise God this is this is the effects of national Revival they even put on the back of the newspaper hymns and they put a running tick a running number of all the conversions does that remind you of covid they had a running number of all the deaths one thousand ten thousand five thousand five hundred thousand two two million four billion see when people really get saved they keep track of the good things not the bad things Hallelujah and when God revives our hearts we keep track of the good things not the bad things don't let the devil keep track of your bad things tell them it's I've already confessed it it's in the sea of forgetfulness Jesus has already forgiven me I'm only keeping track of the testimonies amen I'm not keeping track of my fails I'm keeping track of God's testimonies in my life Hallelujah Glory see it impacted the entire nation that's what it looks like now I just want to close with this here got a few minutes and I don't have slides for all these Summoner to show a few slides and I'm gonna I want to read this again I I personally believe this is Brother randoms uh how do you say it his best sermon on Divine Healing he ever preached this is my personal opinion works as Faith expressed one month before he passes he even says he says he says after all these years on the field he said I ought to have learned something about Divine Healing he says the more the more you swim he said The more smoother the stroke right whether you're supposed to whichever way you're swimming I don't swim either so I don't even know which stroke that is but he said if you're not learning things he said then you're getting further away from God and this sermon to me is the Pinnacle of his teaching on Divine Healing now he says and God promised you the same thing if you could just believe that it would happen if you can't believe it it just won't happen now I can't make you believe neither can you make yourself believe now someone ought to should someone ought to should have said amen after that you can't make yourself believe him said God has to give it to you as a gift if you want God to heal you it's got to be a gift if you want God to save a loved one it's got to be a gift you can never work it up in other words you can't twist God's arm and say God you got to do this God's going to do it when he wants to do it if he wants to do it praise God and this is growth this is growth in brother Adams Ministry right he said God has to give it to you it's a gift of God to believe not your faith it's God's faithful it's a good thing because my flesh don't have much faith that's what I needed Jesus is Faith amen that's what Paul said I don't live by my faith I live by the faith of the son of God your intellectual Faith might believe it fine but unless the faith of God's Not In Your Heart see your intellectual faith can accept it do that do that but just keep believing it with your heart until God does reveal it to you see just keep believing it until God does reveal it but then Brothers goes on to say I don't have all the quotes but I said you probably remember me preaching this a few years ago he says until God reveals that he said you can pour 50 gallons of oil think of what 50 gallons looks like you can pour 50 gallons of oil on someone for Divine Healing and they'll never get well until it's revealed to them brother I said you can baptize somebody 50 times in the name of the Lord Jesus but until they receive salvation until it's a revelation nothing will ever change so that I'll encourage you thank God a revelation struck your heart praise God thank God God dropped a revelation on your heart to love the word of God to believe the word of God God dropped it and when God dropped it you just received it praise God it was a gift thank God for these precious gifts we have about marriage and divorce these gifts we have about Holiness these gifts we have about salvation these gifts we have about the baptism of the Holy Ghost these gifts we have about Divine Healing and miracles and the gifts of the Spirit they're all gifts thank God for his gifts Hallelujah we didn't earn a one of them they were all given by Grace Hallelujah you never worked yourself up into that it was God leading you to that praise God he did it sovereignly it was his time his plan it wasn't your plan it was God's plan amen this is the climax I believe we cannot work ourselves into anything it's God drawing us to it God is drawing us all we have to do is just submit to his drawing it's God saying come have fellowship with me and all we do is say Okay Lord yeah okay I'll meet you there yeah Hallelujah I hear you drawing me to some fellowship yeah I'll meet you there now think how easy you do you do all these times for church right so if we can do it all these times we can do it outside of church too it's a great victory that we have it for church praise God a lot of people don't go to church anymore covert wiped out a lot of church attendance but didn't wipe out ours praise God Hallelujah thank God but if we can surrender thank God we can surrender in the coming to physical church but now let's also listen for the surrender of time outside of church see beautiful that's where I'm gonna stop because I don't have these notes to organize them my thoughts are all over the place okay so give me a few minutes here to finish up I didn't have time to get through all my thoughts I had so many thoughts coming with your Bible here let's get your Bible here go to revelation 3. just some of these familiar scriptures well the Cam's message was such a blessing I just want to end with some of these I want to repeat some of these familiar thoughts here Revelation chapter 3. verse 19. actually let's go to verse 18. I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire in other words Jesus saying let me give you some advice come to me and buy these spiritual blessings right in other words what is he doing he's inviting you to him I'm counseling you come and buy gold trying the fire white raim it and I salve come by these blessings from me see he's drawing you to him now think about that Jesus is here in the Holy Spirit and he's got gold waiting for you and he's got a white white garment waiting for you and I sell for you if I had a stack of gold here all of you would rush up to get the gold if I said I want to share my goal with you guys I want you to have wealth I want you to be stable Jesus is here offering something so much better and the church said what is gold he said it's it's time-tested faith the fiery Trials of your faith are more precious than what gold so Jesus is saying let me take you through some trials and I will I will mature your faith it'll be more valuable than gold what's white Raymond white Raymond is the righteousness or the Integrity of Christ let me give you a garment of his Integrity Glory tomorrow yes where Mount is closed the church or to work tomorrow but also put on that Garment of righteousness too Jesus died in other words Jesus died for me and I'm going to live like it I'm going to live like somebody died for me can the church say amen amen I know I'm kind of pull for amen tonight you know it's Wednesday night God help me to live like somebody died for me and now I'm living for them and Lord give me some ice out so I can rub it on my eyes and I can really see I can get all that matter out of my eyes I can really see what's going on out there what is going on in this world help me to see with your eyes help me to see my my co-workers with your eyes help me see my family with your eyes how many want these blessings from Jesus 19. as many as I love what I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent see we saw how brother cam showed Peter got rebuked by Paul after he was born again and the Bible says if you rebuke a wise man he'll love you so when Jesus comes and he brings us a word and it rebukes us and it corrects us we should love him afterwards praise God and he's going to offer us more gold he's going to offer us the white raiment he's going to offer us the eye salve and he says come to me and buy some of these in other words make a transaction amen I'm Trading My Sorrows amen I'm Trading My Sorrows I'm Trading My Pain amen I'm laying it down for the joy of the Lord amen Hallelujah I'm trading my my ashes for some beauty praise God I'm trading it I'm making a trade I'm trading in my complaining and getting some real strong faith praise God I know God's in control of my life I know God will bring me through this it's hard but God will get me through it praise God you just traded your ashes for for beauty praise God all right Hallelujah Hallelujah you about to come to church well I'm going to get back at that person but you can leave with the righteousness you can leave with a white robot I'm gonna go love that person praise God you can leave you can leave changed I can we all can leave change how many believe that by God's grace the church that's why I believe our Revival is greater than Asbury because our Revival is a Revival of quality not quantity it's not the number of hours it's not the number of straight days it's the quality what life is produced they're a Wesleyan Revival right we could say the same thing about any denominational Revival any denomination Revival it only takes them so far but this word takes us fully into the mind of Christ remember Church remember what Deuteronomy says the Bible says the secret things belong to the Lord and to his children we have secret things the world and domination doesn't know anything about it Hallelujah ain't amen they don't know about the 12 Mysteries they don't know about and they don't know about anything we have God's secret things that shows we're God's people you you would think you would think in 14 days a Revival Services sister Naomi you would think at some point they'd catch the mystery that God's one person his gracious all that praying brother Ray all that singing you would think in one of those songs the mystery would strike oh he's not threes one I just had a woman call me up from I forget what state she was she's like you know what she said my whole life I just I didn't talk to her but I left her a voicemail my whole life I wondered who do I pray to the father Holy Ghost she said your video seems to be right it's just one person that makes so much more sense and it would really relieve me if that's the truth I said that is the truth amen you're not praying to three people you're praying to one person amen it's the quality brother Austin it's a quality amount of guy of Revival it's not the quantity it's the quality praise God she said do I wear a veil uh a cap over my hair that's that my covering I said sister just go look at the Bible the covering is your long hair she said that makes so much sense thank you doesn't the Bible make so much sense but they can pray for all those hours in that 14 straight days and not even kept see the focus isn't on the forward of God it's on a part of the word but our focus is on all the word of God amen hallelujah Jesus said Elijah shall restore all things Hallelujah Jesus Christ said that Elijah the spirit of Elijah on William Branham would restore all things and here we are Brother Ray it's all restored amen glory to God hallelujah amen Glory says brother Cam said the word is energized by faith that when God drops that Revelation down now church for Divine Healing you need Revelation but I'ma say something right here not everything you need a revelation for let me explain if you come in here with an angry spirit you don't need a revelation that God wants you to deliver from that huh if you come in here with a lying Spirit on you you don't need a revelation oh God wants to be delivered from lying no God the Bible says it plain God always wants you free from lying and the church said amen amen you've got a lustful spirit if you got the greedy spirit if you got a bitter spirit some kind of a complex we don't have to have a revelation does God want to set me free from depression today does God want to set me free from lust does God want to uh Set Me Free uh from any sin of course he does amen I don't need a revelation for that the Bible said Die daily praise God Amen it's already in the scripture praise God so there's times church when we need you just recognize the word of God like brother Camp said the truth shall make us free praise God we gotta look at our situation what's the truth of that situation and when we look at it we got to judge it and we know the truth will set us free in that situation praise God Hallelujah that's my humble opinion there's some things we don't need to Revival on I'm sorry we don't need Revelation on because it's already been revealed to us now Church get this though we sin every day and Church Brothers said Satan has a punch one punch on us all the time so there's going to be times we feel like we're on the Mountaintop but that Mountaintop don't last so long so pretty soon he's punching at you with that envy that jealousy all right that Pride look how great I am my goodness I'm the greatest person that ever walked on the face of the Earth people think that they think that see he's always got one punch on you one punch so see we can have Revival but yet at some point when we come down from our great spiritual euphoria on that same day Satan's going to be punching us so we got to be ready to fight praise God and what do we fight with what can brother Cameron reminded said what do we fight with faith in the word of God let's all say it together ready faith in the word of God I'm not trying to trick anybody praise God Hallelujah and like brother Cam said we must remember who we are in God's sight when were you chosen sister who in the mind of God do you remember when you were chosen yes from the foundation world give her two claps Ephesians 1 verse 5. amen you are chosen in Christ before the foundational world does anybody know in Ephesians or Galatians chapter 4 why could God give you the Holy Ghost because you were always what what you always were a son the Bible said because you are Sons God gave you the Holy Ghost you already were in other words he predestinated he knew you were a Son of God son or daughter of God that's why you got it praise God that's why God's drawing you here you already were you were chosen in his mind praise God and then you always were so that's why he gave it to you praise God he foreknew you that's what the barber that's what the barber had trouble with foreknowledge I said a lot of us have troubles for knowledge right how can God have foreign knowledge and then uh allow free more agency as well because he knows the beginning from the end that's the only answer but it's hard to understand how could God give Judas a scared free moral uh agency but yet he set him up to be the Son of Perdition because God knew he would want the money instead we can understand it but someone who doesn't go to The Message Church they can't understand that mystery thank God we can understand the Mysteries hallelujah thank God and so see that barber and other people they'll wrestle with is do we have three more agency or not does it now look look what Hussein gets him oh do we have three more agency or not does even matter if I serve God or go to church or not see because they don't understand the mystery thank God our eyes are open blessed are your eyes sister for they say blessed are your ear sister for they here praise God he's looked up to heaven and rejoice and thank these things are hidden from the eyes of the wise and prudent but they're revealed unto babes such as we're learned and see Rejoice because your name's written in heaven praise God ah Hallelujah amen bye remember proverbs 31 I preached this years ago when William first came there are seasons of life for that Proverbs 31 Woman when the children were there she was busy making sure they were dressed in crimson whatever that means and her lamp never went out by night she wasn't making business deals when the kids were throwing up she wasn't working with her hands sewing all those blankets and things together while the kids were throwing up or had chickenpox or whatever they had their seasons of life praise God because all these seasons are in God's Sovereign timing Hallelujah almost done I want to close to this because this was I thought was the most important thing well I got two more things it's hard to close what I what really touched me was just when brother cam was preaching about God's grace and if we make a mistake just come back to God and God if we don't do it right away then God and his love will come find us we said with Adam and Eve right he'll come find us the main thing is God really loves us amen sings that song that song is true I don't know I don't know if all the lyrics are right on that but that course is right God really loves us praise God Adam and Eve have everything right they had no reason to fall but they fell anyway God didn't say I'm done with you bunch of rebels he said bring some bring some Lambs over here let's slam let me clothe my naked children Ah that's just what they needed was their shame to be gone so God took away their shame just like he does for you and I takes away our guilt and shame praise God because words children praise God takes it away because of his love for us what was another thought in football we had a saying I don't know if Brother Ray played football or not but we had a saying it was called Turn the Page in other words if you had a bad play man I messed it up on that one Turn the Page because there's another play coming in other words you don't have time to worry about what happened the last play if you focus on that you're going to be a failure of the rest of the game and that's true I've experienced that I've had coaches cuss me out and make I made all kinds of mistakes on the football field and I had to learn to turn the page you got to forget about that you got to forget about the heirs and you got to move on and focus on right now and that's what I felt like brother Cam's message was saying Church we're all going to battle Satan's got a punch on us every day we got to come to the house of God confess our sins and know that God loves me just as much now as he always did and if God's true then he took my sins and he threw him in the sea of forgetfulness as soon as I prayed for them dinner brother Ramsay confess your sins before you come in this prayer line because if not it's going to be called out but if you confess them I can't even see them he said amen God God hides them from me because God hides it from the devil too praise God he hides them from himself in other words he he chooses to forget them he cast them to see a forgetfulness and he doesn't hold us against him in other words we have to have a short-term memory move on sincerely confess sincerely move on Turn the Page and let's move on where God wants to work right now I had to learn that football and now I'm saying wow a lot of these lessons kind of carry over to my life my spiritual life forget about the mistakes I made yesterday I gotta fight right now I can't change yesterday but I can change right now and I can change tomorrow too I can plant good seas and I can Harvest them tomorrow like we're seeing with our young ones people say well bro just how do your children get like that because we plant a lot of seeds my wife plant a lot of seeds at the house they've sat through a lot of sermons bless this guy right here he sat through a lot of the sermons he went up there and played piano and he didn't want to but bless this guy right here he humbled himself and obeyed his daddy Hallelujah buddy playing a lot of seeds in this guy's life right here maybe for us for a while but now he's doing it all by himself he made the choice to follow Christ plant the seeds you can change now and you can change your future Church your future is bright didn't God tell Israel I know the thoughts they're good thoughts I have an expected end for you I've got good thoughts for you just seek me with all your heart amen just love me with all your heart praise God and you'll have a expected end you have a bright future because Christ is in your future now close to this Hebrews 11 6. take your Bible one last time it's already 8 30 mine this would be so hard to preach to close preaching uh Hebrews 11 6. this is what I want to bring out I just want to end with this foreign six very familiar scripture now getting back to all this revival bringing it first full circle back to Evan Roberts William Seymour these sisters that these young young ladies that started the Revival all they were doing was following God's leading God was drawing them for a sovereign move of God in church what does the Bible say without faith it's impossible to please him so all these individuals we talk about these Heroes of the faith all they did was just have faith in what God was calling them to do we can only do what God is calling us to do God's not asking you to do something he's not asking you to do he's only asking you to do one thing praise God and just have faith in what God has called you to do for most of us it's parenting or spouses right find what God has called you to do and be faithful with it for he that cometh to God must believe that his honey believe God is God how many believe God sent you to Earth at this time how do you believe God guided you for this very moment right here absolutely who how many believe God put the clothes on your back the food on your table the gas in your tank the shoes on your feet God did it all honey believe God sent his son to die for your sins on the cross Hallelujah I believe that well you're on the you got the first step praise God you must believe that he is God and next he's rewarder of them that diligently seek him praise God that's what these Saints did they went to diligent seeking and church that's what we do when we come to church we're diligently seeking God and God will reward all of our efforts we just have to surrender to what God is leading us to do God LED Seymour God LED Evan Roberts God LED those young teenage girls into their prayer and singing and worshiping God LED them that and they had faith and they knew if I just seek God will be rewarded for this at some point what did Brother Adam say he said meet up he said if anybody gets Credit in this family give it to who sister Mita because I couldn't be out here on the field except she was there taking care of my kids is that right Church and what did Brother Adam say about the sisters he he said when you were ironing your clothes for your husband he says it's as if you're ironing the clothes for Jesus as you serve your husband you're serving Christ praise God the Bible says the husband and wife are joint Heirs of the the rewards of Life the Bible says praise God so in other words it's diligently doing what God has called you to do and in that diligent obedience just following God every day starting over fresh lord it's a new day it's a fresh start I'm going to put tomorrow behind me I'm not going to live in the past praise God somebody just told me a story I'm trying to remember but I told you sorry my dad I talked to my dad a few years ago and the very first thing he said was in 1950 my dad said something also offered me at Christmas he was still living in 1950. that was almost 70 years ago right we don't want to live in the past we want to press on towards the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ we want to forget yeah we want to forgive that we want to forgive before we move on we're going to forgive and then we're going to press on towards the mark of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus and know that God sees all of our efforts to diligently seek him there's going to be scenes of Our Lives where we can seek God more diligently but in all we do to glorify God it's all service unto God there's no days wasted Church God sees every day Hallelujah does he not he sees every single day he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him the main thing is let's keep seeking God listen to our feet musicians can come here Hallelujah I will pour out my spirit praise God church we believe God is and God is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him let's buy our heads for a few moments I hope something was said tonight by the holy
