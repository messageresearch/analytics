[0:00] start the live stream
[0:04] now i have uh numerous slides here in
[0:07] maokai
[0:09] but then i'll get to a spot where i
[0:10] didn't have time to get all the slides
[0:13] the reason wasn't that i came across a
[0:15] new thought this morning i usually take
[0:16] sunday morning and put all the thoughts
[0:18] on
[0:18] uh
[0:20] slide somebody could see him but
[0:22] i came across a different thought
[0:24] so i had to kind of
[0:25] deal with that one
[0:27] but god is good and everybody loved the
[0:29] lord this morning amen amen amen just
[0:31] good to see everybody and good to be in
[0:32] the house the lord today by god's grace
[0:34] god is surely
[0:35] merciful to us
[0:37] and nature thanks for all those letters
[0:38] yesterday that was really good i just
[0:39] stacked them all up i said look at all
[0:40] these letters
[0:42] do you want everybody like a thank you
[0:43] letter it was really
[0:44] really kind so thank you that really
[0:46] made me feel good
[0:47] everybody felt real good so thank you
[0:50] um
[0:51] yeah so you know uh over the years i've
[0:53] you know i've had to
[0:54] deal with different topics and we ought
[0:56] to because we're we're the children of
[0:58] god
[0:59] and if anybody's going to get something
[1:00] right it's going to be the believers
[1:02] that's right because they're born again
[1:04] they've got the holy spirit
[1:07] the only way they would is that they had
[1:08] a complex like peter had a complex
[1:10] against the gentiles
[1:12] but then of course god straightens him
[1:14] out that's right and so for father's day
[1:16] i just you know just studying on this
[1:17] all week and i could see the father's
[1:19] hand in this you know because the father
[1:21] ordained the marriage between zipporah
[1:23] and moses
[1:25] brother brown said it was god's choice
[1:27] for moses
[1:28] that you know it was god ordained this
[1:31] marriage praise god
[1:32] and so i just want to start you know
[1:34] with these thoughts that we ended with
[1:35] on wednesday night you know god has a
[1:37] great number of thoughts about you
[1:40] because how many believe you're
[1:41] fearfully and wonderfully made amen amen
[1:44] hallelujah all of us are
[1:46] the bible says your body is a marvelous
[1:48] work of god
[1:50] now again we're not to get ourselves
[1:51] prideful like look how marvelous look
[1:53] how great i am
[1:55] no it's but it's to recognize that god
[1:57] has given you a special
[1:59] uh body he's given you a special
[2:01] existence you're higher above a bug
[2:04] you're higher above an animal praise god
[2:08] in the bible it says you are in the
[2:10] image of god amen the animals are not
[2:13] but you are in the resemblance amen
[2:15] that's what that word image means you
[2:17] are the resemblance of almighty god
[2:19] hallelujah amen and so god makes you
[2:21] this image and then after that he puts
[2:23] his spirit on you praise god to be more
[2:26] like him praise god that's right because
[2:28] we know there's
[2:29] billions of people that do not have the
[2:31] spirit of god on them but we are some of
[2:33] those uh blessed ones amen we're some of
[2:35] those children of god that have god's
[2:38] image physically but also his spiritual
[2:40] likeness hallelujah amen amen a very
[2:42] blessed chosen group if i say you're
[2:44] chosen
[2:45] elect hallelujah
[2:47] to have both god's image naturally and
[2:50] his spirit
[2:51] in you so you can resemble the very
[2:53] character and heart of god hallelujah
[2:55] amen
[2:57] now notice
[3:00] in your books everyone has a book about
[3:02] your life i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry
[3:05] in god's book my fault in god's book all
[3:08] your members
[3:10] so all all the details of your life were
[3:12] written
[3:13] before there was any of them
[3:16] so let's take that to moses and zephora
[3:19] god had already written that they were
[3:21] going to be married
[3:22] praise god
[3:24] god had ordained that now look at you
[3:26] god had ordained your life as well
[3:28] praise god
[3:29] hallelujah
[3:31] and then the bible said these thoughts
[3:32] of god are precious
[3:35] god's plan for our lives amen
[3:38] the things god is ordained for our lives
[3:40] these should be precious to us
[3:42] amen and it's a great amount of them
[3:44] it's a great sub in other words god has
[3:46] taken great consideration into each one
[3:48] of our lives he's considered this and
[3:50] he's considered that trial that we'd
[3:52] face and but yet he'd make a way that we
[3:53] could be overcomer same day
[3:56] he would work everything out for his
[3:58] glory he would make all the trials and
[4:00] all the obstacles and all the the the
[4:02] complexes and you know uh the the
[4:05] difficult portions of our life he'd make
[4:07] it all work out for his glory that we
[4:10] would love him more praise god amen amen
[4:12] because he cannot love us more amen
[4:14] hallelujah god cannot love you more amen
[4:17] god's got eternal love for you praise
[4:18] god but god wants us to love him for
[4:20] amen amen amen amen
[4:23] i told myself i was going to watch my
[4:24] voice because i about preached my voice
[4:26] out on wednesday night
[4:27] shouting all over the place
[4:29] screaming
[4:30] um
[4:32] david said if i would count them there's
[4:34] more than the numbers of sand
[4:36] the thoughts that god has about you and
[4:39] i
[4:42] skipping down here the bible says
[4:44] thy thoughts which are to us words so
[4:46] god has thoughts about us they can't be
[4:48] reckoned up in order unto thee if i
[4:51] would declare and speak of them they're
[4:53] more than can be numbered now we have a
[4:58] uh
[4:58] it's hard for us to imagine certain
[5:00] numbers like imagine a million what is a
[5:02] million how can you easily picture a
[5:04] million it's very hard to picture right
[5:07] i forget how many hairs are on our heads
[5:08] i forget you remember the number
[5:10] it was in the thousands i think it might
[5:11] have been twenty thousand or some
[5:13] hundred thousand something like that but
[5:15] that gives you an idea of all those
[5:16] hairs on our heads you know
[5:18] uh that gives us an idea now millions
[5:21] you know it's just hard for us to fathom
[5:22] a million billion trillion
[5:25] septillion like we saw the number of
[5:27] stars on wednesday night
[5:29] and just beyond our comprehension but
[5:31] whatever the number is of god's thoughts
[5:33] about us it's higher than we can imagine
[5:37] so we must understand god has every day
[5:39] planned out for our lives amen
[5:41] god has something he's doing with our
[5:43] lives and
[5:44] our relationships and god is going to
[5:47] work everything out for his glory you
[5:49] know we're going to get to some
[5:50] scriptures in a moment and we gotta
[5:51] always have to remember the balance you
[5:53] know god didn't promise us a flowery bed
[5:55] of ease amen
[5:57] he did promise us peace though praise
[5:59] god amen amen as we saw on wednesday
[6:01] night he did promise us all strength
[6:03] amen that's right amen unto
[6:07] so he did promise us that if we're able
[6:09] to accept it
[6:10] because that's the choice we have today
[6:12] and god has thoughts that are towards us
[6:15] thoughts of peace
[6:17] to give us an expected end so we know
[6:19] where we're going glory we know wherever
[6:21] ahead he amen and all god wants us to do
[6:23] in this process is to seek him amen
[6:26] and recognize that he has good thoughts
[6:28] toward us a good plan he's taking us
[6:30] somewhere he's taking us to be more like
[6:32] christ in the stature and the character
[6:34] of jesus christ and trust him and when
[6:36] we make time to seek him and
[6:39] and to to know him he will be found of
[6:41] us amen amen
[6:44] now remember church as we get into this
[6:46] thought about all the nations of the
[6:47] world
[6:48] god's eyes go through the whole earth
[6:50] everybody say whole earth
[6:53] and he's looking for those whose hearts
[6:56] are perfect toward him
[6:58] so he's not just singling out well i'm
[7:00] just going to go through america or i'm
[7:02] just going to go through uh south
[7:04] america or asia or australia he searches
[7:08] the whole earth amen
[7:10] god is looking for people
[7:12] around the whole world
[7:14] and he wants to show himself strong
[7:16] amen amen god wants strong believers in
[7:19] every nation hallelujah
[7:22] and peter said god does not respect
[7:24] persons
[7:26] god made all persons
[7:28] but he does not respect one more than
[7:29] the other
[7:32] he has great love to all of them and the
[7:34] bible says in every nation hallelujah he
[7:36] that fears god and works righteousness
[7:39] god accepts
[7:41] so it's man that draws national boundary
[7:44] lines not god
[7:46] god doesn't say well i can't pass here i
[7:48] won't pass there i'm a little nervous to
[7:50] go there a little scared to go there god
[7:52] doesn't look at any of those god is
[7:54] looking at the heart amen
[7:56] because he does not respect
[7:58] any persons
[8:00] that's the kind of god i serve amen i'm
[8:02] thankful to serve this kind of a holy
[8:04] god
[8:05] now father god loves all the creation of
[8:07] mankind he proved it because i love this
[8:10] because he shed his blood he was slain
[8:13] he was slaughtered
[8:15] he was beaten bloodied and bruised not
[8:18] just for one nation but for all nations
[8:22] and he said i know someone in every
[8:23] nation is going to believe me someone in
[8:26] every nation is going to serve me so i'm
[8:27] going to redeem some out of every nation
[8:30] and i'm making them kings and priests
[8:32] amen
[8:34] [Applause]
[8:36] every nation which means every color
[8:38] every shape
[8:40] every size amen
[8:43] because someone don't like our shape or
[8:44] size if someone don't like our noses you
[8:46] know
[8:48] some of us don't like
[8:49] different attributes about it but god
[8:52] god puts very little emphasis on that
[8:54] when he made jesus he had no beauty that
[8:56] we would desire
[8:57] lord when he made a son in his own image
[9:01] in his own character amen to express the
[9:04] heart of god
[9:05] he made him of no beauty
[9:07] and he made himself of no reputation
[9:10] amen
[9:11] such a humble servant a humble son
[9:15] so god's love and extends to every
[9:17] nation every kindred
[9:20] and then he finds those the bible says
[9:22] they're more noble there it is right
[9:23] there lord god finds that noble blood
[9:27] spiritual blood
[9:29] god finds that noble character amen
[9:31] those who like to seek god those who
[9:33] search the scriptures daily whether
[9:35] these things are so god finds that noble
[9:37] blood in every nation every tongue and
[9:40] he raises them up and makes them
[9:41] spiritual leaders amen
[9:44] not looking at the outside
[9:47] but looking at the inside
[9:50] looking at the motive and the objective
[9:53] of each individual praise god
[9:56] praise god hallelujah amen
[9:58] and remember this is a picture of who
[10:00] the bride of christ
[10:02] so jesus bride is going to be all
[10:04] different skin colors
[10:06] is that right
[10:07] is that right amen program calls it the
[10:09] bribe okay right the bride bouquet
[10:13] all kinds
[10:14] all colors
[10:16] right you know there's white people that
[10:18] have white albino hair did you know that
[10:21] so god's got like all white and then all
[10:23] black and everything on in between
[10:26] i've seen a picture of one today i'm
[10:27] looking online all the different
[10:28] pictures of all the skin colors in the
[10:30] world wow
[10:32] all right all black all the way and
[10:34] everything in between praise god
[10:37] god loves it he's a god of variety
[10:39] praise god
[10:40] remember esau was born a red hairy man
[10:44] how'd
[10:48] [Applause]
[10:51] so there's all
[10:52] shapes and
[10:54] and shades and and
[10:55] colors and god died for them all
[10:57] hallelujah amen and he might redeem some
[10:59] of all
[11:01] that's why he died amen amen
[11:02] remember god's love is so great jesus
[11:05] loved his own which were in the world
[11:07] and loved them until the end so we know
[11:09] god will love us to the end amen
[11:11] and there's nothing that can separate
[11:13] you and i from the love of christ
[11:16] there's no trial or tribulation peril
[11:18] sword persecution famine nakedness
[11:22] uh but here's the bells yes god loves
[11:24] you so much so that's wonderful but
[11:27] don't forget he's got to let you be
[11:28] tested too that's right
[11:30] because he counts you like sheep
[11:33] and so that means in your distress
[11:35] that's when you must become sheep-like
[11:38] glory
[11:39] in the famine in the nakedness and the
[11:41] tribulation the sore
[11:43] in these trials that god allows that's
[11:45] where we got to manifest a sheep nature
[11:48] that's right that's right so other words
[11:50] if i don't have enough food i've got to
[11:51] be humble about it
[11:54] if god lets peril or dangers or sword
[11:57] and someone dies in our family i've got
[11:59] to be like a sheep about it
[12:02] is that right
[12:03] murder if it's a murder
[12:05] like mike mccloskey is one of the
[12:07] greatest examples he was shot by a cop
[12:09] but lived and yet he showed the mercy of
[12:12] god that police officer
[12:15] purposely shot him
[12:16] made him paralyzed in the back but yet
[12:18] when he saw the bible about true friends
[12:20] he said that police officer deserves
[12:22] forgiveness
[12:25] in the church amen amen
[12:27] amazing
[12:29] so see god love we always want to know
[12:32] god loves us but at the same time god is
[12:34] trying to create a character in us
[12:35] that's like
[12:36] christ amen so in all these things in
[12:39] sword and peril and persecution
[12:42] we must be like sheep and when we're
[12:44] like you then we're more than conquerors
[12:46] unto him that loved us amen
[12:52] death life angels principalities powers
[12:54] things present nor things that come nor
[12:56] height death any other creature shall be
[12:58] able to separate the numbers there's no
[13:00] devil there's no
[13:01] there's no fallen angel that can
[13:03] separate us from the love of christ amen
[13:05] no creature amen amen
[13:09] but you're going to have to be like a
[13:10] sheep and you have to suffer
[13:12] at times
[13:13] because god is writing a testimony
[13:16] for this flock can i say like that this
[13:19] god's making a testimony for his sheep
[13:23] hallelujah and
[13:24] how how long are we killed church how
[13:26] long are we going through testing all
[13:28] the day long
[13:29] all the day long
[13:32] now notice god i'm getting in this
[13:34] thought here god wants all men to be
[13:36] saved
[13:39] but he knows not all will be saved
[13:43] and i just love this you know
[13:45] aha was a man who probably was lost
[13:47] everything points to the fact that he
[13:48] was lost and went to hell
[13:50] but even when he humbled himself god
[13:53] took elijah aside as a prophet said
[13:55] can't you see that even the sinner can
[13:57] humble himself and because of this
[13:59] single act of humility i will not let
[14:01] the evil come upon him but i'll save it
[14:04] for the next generation
[14:06] for one simple act of church think about
[14:08] that how often should we humble
[14:10] ourselves
[14:11] this guy did it one time and god said
[14:13] i'll push it off to the next generation
[14:15] bye
[14:16] think about the mercy of god on you and
[14:18] i when we rep of our minor sins he had
[14:21] major sins yet god held off mercy for
[14:24] him in other words how much mercy is god
[14:26] giving to us amen
[14:28] hallelujah that was the logo that was a
[14:31] serve god amen
[14:33] and this man allowed heathen temples to
[14:35] be built
[14:37] right he let his wife murder the
[14:38] prophets
[14:40] murder nabal
[14:41] holy righteous man and yet god said
[14:45] because of that act of humility
[14:48] i will be merciful and i'll push the
[14:51] judgment off to the next generation
[14:55] we serve a gracious god
[14:58] i love when the lord descended moses saw
[15:00] he said lord put me in the cleft of the
[15:02] rock and he covered him with his hand
[15:03] right and the lord passed by he said he
[15:06] said
[15:06] he expressed he proclaimed the name of
[15:09] the lord the character and the character
[15:11] of god was merciful gracious
[15:14] long-suffering abundant in goodness and
[15:16] truth keeping mercy for thousands
[15:19] forgiving iniquity and transgression and
[15:21] sin and that will by no means clear the
[15:24] guilty
[15:25] in other words i'm going to deal justly
[15:27] with every person whoever wants mercy
[15:29] will have mercy
[15:31] whoever wants uh god whoever wants a
[15:34] rebellion god will give them rebellion
[15:36] but if people want to serve god if
[15:38] people want to be right with god god
[15:40] will make them right god will clear
[15:41] their slaves god will purge them of
[15:43] their sins and god will make them white
[15:45] as snow
[15:47] because he's merciful
[15:49] long suffering gracious
[15:53] now i brought this back last year by the
[15:54] way i don't know if you're here but were
[15:56] you here when i preached on uh the names
[15:57] of god
[15:59] i just did a short series i think i
[16:00] preached two sermons or three sermons
[16:03] i think that was wrong
[16:05] okay
[16:06] hallelujah
[16:08] but uh the bible said it was lord the
[16:10] lord god so when god descended
[16:13] down to moses he said i am jehovah
[16:15] elohim in other words i'm a
[16:17] self-existent strong one that's right
[16:19] glory
[16:21] so who is who is long-suffering who is
[16:24] merciful the self-existent strong god
[16:26] amen
[16:28] hallelujah amen because the lord the
[16:30] word lord of the capital
[16:32] or l-o-r-d is jehovah which means
[16:34] self-existent one who reveals himself
[16:36] that's what scofield summed it up as
[16:38] right
[16:38] okay
[16:40] so i love how god says that the lord god
[16:43] the self-existent strong one
[16:46] the jehovah elohim jehovah elohim
[16:50] merciful gracious the strong one
[16:52] self-existent i will be merciful to you
[16:55] praise god that's right
[16:57] hallelujah
[16:58] and he will forgive
[17:00] iniquity he'll clear the guilty praise
[17:03] god amen
[17:04] he forgives our sins hallelujah
[17:07] remember he visits the iniquity but he
[17:09] also visits the blessings amen of saints
[17:12] on to the next generation as well praise
[17:14] god
[17:15] hallelujah
[17:17] i must get past that
[17:19] now this is why i couldn't get all the
[17:21] thoughts because this thought came to me
[17:22] this morning i better
[17:24] understand esau now
[17:27] because the bible says
[17:30] the children jacob and esau not being
[17:32] born neither having done any good or
[17:34] evil that the purpose of god according
[17:36] to election might stand not of works but
[17:38] of in the call
[17:39] jacob have i love
[17:41] esau have i hated
[17:43] i've always thought just god always you
[17:45] know and this is where i'm growing as a
[17:47] i'm growing as a christian too i used to
[17:49] think god would just hate esau just
[17:51] hated him like i don't like you
[17:53] but as i read all these scriptures i
[17:55] thought well how does that work with all
[17:57] the other verses that god wants
[17:58] everybody to be saved
[18:00] that has to include esau
[18:03] so as i research and look at different
[18:05] uh ministers and different writers
[18:08] they say like albert barnes for this
[18:10] just one example out of many he said
[18:12] this word hatred is not positive hatred
[18:15] but it's merely a less love
[18:17] or the withholding of the expression of
[18:19] affection
[18:21] and if you look up in the bible or if
[18:23] you look up in uh scholars they talk
[18:26] about the word hyperbole and the word
[18:28] hyperbole means a word it's a deliberate
[18:31] exaggeration to emphasize a point
[18:36] it's delivered so god on purpose is
[18:38] saying i've known jacob and esau before
[18:40] the foundational world jacob have i
[18:42] loved esau by hayden he's not saying he
[18:45] hates esau but he's saying because of
[18:47] esau's decisions i can't bless him like
[18:50] i'll bless jacob
[18:52] let me prove it to you god's using
[18:54] hyperbole here to show that god knows
[18:56] the the purpose from the beginning to
[18:58] the end
[19:00] god can't force esau to be saved god
[19:03] can't force jacob to be saved god has to
[19:05] allow them their own free more agency
[19:07] praise god
[19:08] so this is hyperbole
[19:10] because remember i've preached this
[19:11] numerous times over the last few years
[19:13] remember does god god it's thus saith
[19:15] the lord do i have any pleasure that the
[19:17] wicked should die
[19:19] god doesn't delight in wicked people
[19:20] dying
[19:21] that's why we should cry we when people
[19:23] die that are wicked we shouldn't be
[19:25] happy about that we should be sad
[19:29] doesn't god want ahab to turn from his
[19:32] ways
[19:33] didn't god want esau to change from his
[19:35] ways didn't god want judas is scared to
[19:37] turn from his waist pharaoh
[19:41] so see god is greed by sinners
[19:43] he's merciful but he has to deal with
[19:46] them according their choices
[19:49] they must reap whatever they sow
[19:53] and so god is emphasizing jacob about
[19:56] love in other words because of jacob's
[19:58] freemore agency i was able to pour out
[20:00] more blessings on him
[20:03] but i had to be against esau because
[20:06] esau was against me
[20:08] never understand
[20:09] amen
[20:12] stride means to bleed the lord said my
[20:14] spirit will not always strive with man
[20:16] he gave them 2 000 years
[20:19] before noah's flood to repent two
[20:21] thousand years
[20:23] old
[20:25] remember
[20:26] remember the gibby knights they had over
[20:28] 400 years to repent
[20:31] right
[20:32] jericho had over 400 years to repent
[20:34] god gave them space to repent like
[20:36] jezebel but they repented not amen now
[20:39] the giddy night give me nice divorce
[20:40] right
[20:41] but the other nations did not
[20:44] god gave huge windows of grace amen
[20:49] and god was pleading with them
[20:52] that's what he did for israel he said
[20:53] i'm prophet after prophet after prophet
[20:55] yet they stoned them they slew them they
[20:58] killed them and jesus says why can you
[21:00] why do you stone the very prophets i
[21:01] sent you thank god that we received a
[21:04] prophet amen
[21:05] hallelujah
[21:07] we don't stone brother random or try to
[21:08] silence him we listen to him praise god
[21:10] we listen to him point to the bible as
[21:12] we say praise the lord amen amen
[21:20] to determine the human side versus the
[21:22] prophetic side
[21:25] he said be very careful when you're
[21:26] listening that's right he cares that you
[21:28] care 63 of course we probably got that
[21:30] one memorized i love this one here's why
[21:33] god said i hate esau
[21:37] god has to recompense or pay back
[21:40] everyone according to their
[21:41] righteousness
[21:42] so david said i got paid back because i
[21:45] made righteous decisions
[21:47] that's called reaping and sowing
[21:50] now i love this verse 26 i love this
[21:51] with the merciful god will show himself
[21:54] merciful
[21:56] with the upright man will show i'm sorry
[21:59] they're right man that will show thyself
[22:00] upright
[22:02] see sometimes you wonder why did people
[22:03] have it so good or well part of it is
[22:06] because they treated god so good because
[22:08] they like that they they've respected
[22:10] the word of god so well they've honored
[22:12] the word of god amen
[22:15] so so now naturally because of god's
[22:17] spiritual laws they're going to reap
[22:19] good things because they plan on good
[22:21] things amen
[22:23] naturally
[22:28] i like 27 this is just a beautiful
[22:29] portion david by the holy spirit is
[22:31] writing this
[22:32] with the pure i will show myself pure
[22:36] but with the frower now here's esau that
[22:38] will show thyself unsavory
[22:41] throw word is one that was against god
[22:44] so because esau was a member he was
[22:46] because esau was against his parents he
[22:47] was against god
[22:49] esau said just despite my mom and dad
[22:51] i'm gonna go marry a woman outside of
[22:52] the faith
[22:54] and that made his mom say oh i just want
[22:56] to die
[22:57] oh god that jacob would marry a believer
[23:00] right
[23:02] the afflicted people thou will say but
[23:03] thy eyes are upon the haughty that thou
[23:06] mayest bring them down
[23:09] okay now
[23:13] okay so we have this now here's here's
[23:15] another example of hyperbole did you
[23:16] ever read this and wonder about this
[23:18] jesus said if a man come to me and hate
[23:20] not his father now does god want you to
[23:22] hate your dad if he's not a christian
[23:24] does god really want you to hate your
[23:26] mother your wife your children brethren
[23:28] and sisters if they're not christians
[23:30] and then hate your own life also because
[23:32] god wants you to hate your life i mean
[23:34] god wants you to pray that you'll die
[23:36] no this is hyperbole the church said
[23:39] amen so now it's kind of coming together
[23:41] for me okay brother bang after all these
[23:42] years after 16 years of preaching
[23:44] another thing i'm finally good i'm
[23:44] starting to get this thought here
[23:46] i'm going in grace you know
[23:48] jacob i love esau i hate it but it
[23:51] wasn't the hatred we're talking about
[23:53] like that we would think
[23:55] it's just a lesser love that's right
[23:58] god had to be against him because he was
[24:00] against god
[24:02] but he still was he was he still blessed
[24:04] esau
[24:05] if you look at his lineage god still
[24:07] blessed him
[24:08] families and territories and lambs
[24:13] jesus his own words must be understood
[24:16] he's not telling us to hate our families
[24:18] but he's using hyperbole so we'll have a
[24:21] greater he's emphasizing a point you
[24:23] must love me more than family amen amen
[24:27] amen spiritual family is more important
[24:30] than natural family
[24:33] if your natural family is against the
[24:34] word and you're for the word then we
[24:36] should love those that are with the word
[24:38] more than our natural families amen amen
[24:42] he's not saying hate your dad because
[24:43] he's not a believer
[24:45] hate your mom hate your wife hate your
[24:47] husband because they're not a believer
[24:48] no he's not saying that
[24:50] he's emphasizing
[24:51] the love you need for me is so much
[24:54] greater than everything else in your
[24:56] life
[25:00] because in the very
[25:02] in the very same lifetime he said love
[25:04] your enemies
[25:06] well there he said hate them
[25:08] and then he says love them
[25:11] well can i hate and love at the same
[25:13] time no
[25:15] jesus said if you are upset with a
[25:17] person unjustly he says uh murder he
[25:20] says you're close to the hellfire she
[25:22] says i'm just kind of quoting that i'm
[25:23] misquoting that but not exact quote
[25:26] right
[25:27] in other words if you think evil against
[25:28] someone without a cause you're in danger
[25:30] of hellfire there it is he said your
[25:32] nature hellfire
[25:34] okay so now does jacob and esau make a
[25:36] little more sense god was merciful god
[25:39] was just emphasizing jacob is going to
[25:40] love me more i've already seen his works
[25:42] i've already seen that he's gonna want
[25:44] the birth right more than food amen
[25:47] he's gonna want the spiritual connection
[25:48] the messiah more than natural food and
[25:51] health and prosperity he'll want
[25:53] spiritual blessings more than natural
[25:54] blessings amen
[25:58] write a father's day message
[26:01] look even jesus was kind to judas and he
[26:03] called him friend the satan filled son
[26:06] of perdition he called his friend he's
[26:08] kind
[26:09] and long suffering
[26:14] now i want to begin now looking at this
[26:16] subject here
[26:19] because god chooses interracial
[26:21] marriages
[26:25] now i'm not going to spend a lot of time
[26:27] now here's where i'm going to knock out
[26:28] here uh switch off of my computer and go
[26:30] to the regular scriptures this is where
[26:32] i didn't have enough time to put all
[26:33] these thoughts on
[26:35] uh the slide show so forgive me uh
[26:39] like i said this that thought about esau
[26:41] came to me this morning so i had to
[26:42] study that out and hope that was a
[26:44] blessing by god's grace
[26:45] now you and i understand that we have to
[26:47] take
[26:48] brother graham's words and take them
[26:50] back to the bible but not everybody does
[26:52] right now i have 52 statements that
[26:55] cannot be thus saith the lord and jose's
[26:57] helped me find some of them right
[26:59] brother branham said elisha was on mount
[27:01] transfiguration but it wasn't elisha it
[27:03] was elijah
[27:06] the 80 your body's made of 80 water and
[27:08] petroleum if you drink any petroleum
[27:11] you'll probably die
[27:13] that's how toxic it is so it's a slip of
[27:15] the tongue or slip of understanding like
[27:18] you know you we we know we know better
[27:20] but there are there's what i call i call
[27:22] them either they're either got awful
[27:23] complexes or they're tape worshipers
[27:27] people that make the tapes infallible
[27:28] they're either not saved and they
[27:30] reprobate mine because they love the
[27:31] spirit of idolatry or two they're saved
[27:34] but not born again because they won't be
[27:36] led into more truth or they are born
[27:38] again but they're an awful simple men
[27:40] i'm sorry awful sinful mental complex
[27:44] like brother and said i'm haunted i'm
[27:46] haunted by my conflicts about
[27:48] criticizing people
[27:51] sins don't make you feel good sins make
[27:53] you feel awful
[27:57] if we're really sincere our sins or
[27:59] complexes should make us feel bad
[28:04] it's a it's an awful spiritual state to
[28:06] be in
[28:08] and yet would god still use your gifts
[28:09] yes god
[28:11] as a preacher i know that
[28:13] romans said i come to the pulpit with a
[28:15] uh a bad spirit
[28:17] i'm haunted by my critical spirit so
[28:19] have i come to the pulpit where i don't
[28:20] necessarily feel good i'm battling
[28:22] things in my mind or i'm battling things
[28:23] in my body and you know i'll still
[28:25] preach i'll still yield and god will
[28:26] answer people's prayers
[28:28] and people say i really enjoyed that
[28:29] service i'm like well i was just trying
[28:31] to make it through the service
[28:33] right i mean we all experienced that at
[28:36] times
[28:37] god uses us despite our shortcomings
[28:42] i'm glad
[28:51] and see when people don't do this
[28:53] they're not doing what brother said
[28:54] prove all things by the bible
[28:56] where brother adam get that from the
[28:58] bible so ultimately they're against the
[28:59] bible but i don't need to spend a lot of
[29:01] time on that
[29:02] um
[29:04] because our church is taught in the word
[29:06] of god so i thank the lord for that
[29:08] um now with this idea on mixed uh mixed
[29:11] marriages and interracial marriages i
[29:13] found two observations brother graham
[29:15] never said thus say to the lord
[29:16] regarding this
[29:17] right and he rarely if ever i still
[29:20] haven't i've been searching this these
[29:21] last three four days i still haven't
[29:23] found a bible verse that he gave about
[29:25] it
[29:27] but of course we know he was against us
[29:28] so we'll try to show the balance on that
[29:30] as well
[29:31] and i believe the reason he was against
[29:32] it was because of the cultural
[29:34] violence that was going on in america
[29:37] i don't know how deeply some of us have
[29:39] studied the civil rights movement
[29:41] i'm going to show you some slides a
[29:43] little bit
[29:43] america was i mean still is but america
[29:46] was a very uh
[29:48] uh
[29:49] hateful place to live in many places not
[29:51] every place but in the big cities
[29:53] kind of like it is today right
[29:55] cities are usually the most awful place
[29:57] for sid
[29:58] right because that's what satan did
[30:00] that's what cain did right he went built
[30:01] or he's a vagabond but his descendants
[30:03] built cities and that's where he had the
[30:05] murders and that's where we have uh the
[30:07] center of culture wicked music look at
[30:09] every you know everything you know
[30:10] everything wicked in those cities
[30:12] and where'd you find god out there on
[30:13] those shepherders out there with the
[30:15] sheep baby
[30:16] he's got a prophet out there i need
[30:17] moses with the sheep amen just hang out
[30:20] there over the sheet maybe he's got
[30:21] david out there with the sheep singing
[30:23] songs glorifying god because all
[30:25] creation glorifies the name of the lord
[30:27] amen amen you can be closer to god with
[30:30] sheep dirty smelling sheep than you can
[30:32] with a big city bunch of sinners
[30:35] oh glory amen
[30:37] thank god
[30:39] if you feel more holy with sheep
[30:42] that's right now here's the reason so
[30:43] the reason i think brother man was
[30:44] against it was the main reason was it
[30:46] was illegal united states to have
[30:48] interracial marriages
[30:51] it was illegal can you imagine that
[30:53] it was illegal until 1967
[30:56] two years after he died
[30:58] and i have a quote where brother adam
[31:00] says it so i'm gonna read that here for
[31:01] you
[31:03] brother ram said the boss the government
[31:05] said let it be what it is permit them to
[31:08] marry and so forth i said that's up to
[31:10] them as an american he said i abide by
[31:12] the laws to me you ought to leave it the
[31:14] way god made it he made white men black
[31:17] men brown men he's a god of variety let
[31:19] them stay the way god made them
[31:22] they talked about if i was a black man
[31:23] i'd want to stay in my class of people
[31:26] if i was chinese yellow i'm going to
[31:27] stay that way
[31:29] he said being that i'm anglo-saxon white
[31:31] let me marry amongst the white teach my
[31:33] children the same and just stay the kind
[31:36] of flower and the color that god made us
[31:38] at the beginning
[31:39] after all he's the one that made it
[31:41] okay
[31:42] so this was in 1962
[31:45] so five years before the law was changed
[31:48] all right
[31:52] okay so that's just i want to just start
[31:54] with that one that's my honest
[31:56] uh thought now some people say well you
[31:58] should take brother branham's opinion
[31:59] above your own well i would say only if
[32:02] it's in the bible
[32:03] because the bible never told me to take
[32:05] every human opinion of a prophet above
[32:07] anybody else's
[32:09] to see how they put pressure on you like
[32:11] what do you mean your opinion is better
[32:12] than prophet well the bible never said
[32:14] to take every opinion above a prophet
[32:16] if i do that then like brother you told
[32:18] me on wednesday night then i'm gonna
[32:19] take nathan's opinion that's okay for
[32:22] david to build the house of god how
[32:23] about i take that opinion
[32:25] you see how you see how insane they are
[32:27] when you really think about it compared
[32:28] to scripture
[32:29] they are insane they're worshiping
[32:31] brother branham and that's of the devil
[32:34] but we're taking brother back to the
[32:35] word just like everybody should do
[32:37] because we love jesus christ he's the
[32:39] absolute praise god amen
[32:49] or how about elijah he's the only one
[32:51] he's the only prophet left i'll just
[32:53] take his opinion above god's
[32:55] no god said there's seven thousand i'm
[32:57] gonna take god's opinion
[32:59] praise god
[33:01] you see so
[33:02] you could take all those i'll take moses
[33:04] opinion yeah the israel they are a bunch
[33:06] of rebels
[33:08] god said no god said i see them they're
[33:10] like a unicorn
[33:11] they're like this powerful horse you
[33:13] know they're my people because they're
[33:14] bought by the blood
[33:16] well no you got to take a prophet's word
[33:18] above your own opinion
[33:20] i won't do that because the bible
[33:22] doesn't say to do that
[33:24] and i don't care what anybody says about
[33:25] me let them worship brother i only
[33:27] worship jesus christ amen
[33:29] but i still love them and i also pray
[33:31] for them
[33:32] amen but see they can't they won't love
[33:34] me back
[33:35] right that proves who has the love of
[33:36] god amen but listen if you really got
[33:40] the love of god people will draw you out
[33:42] of their circle but you draw them back
[33:43] in amen
[33:45] that's why i say that's why i say this
[33:47] thing i believe some of them can be born
[33:48] again and yet they got the wrong idea on
[33:50] interracial marriage but they've got an
[33:52] awful sinful complex
[33:54] see what i'm saying
[33:55] because peter had an awful one when he
[33:57] wouldn't even eat with gentiles
[34:00] now we don't know how far that went
[34:01] church we don't know how far that went
[34:04] but he was able to be corrected so a
[34:06] real child of god will be able to be
[34:08] corrected on their complexes
[34:10] right
[34:11] that's right
[34:12] and i've still got to write now just so
[34:13] you know i said this and uh the point i
[34:16] still got to write letters to these
[34:17] preachers that are saying these things i
[34:18] still haven't done that this summer
[34:20] we've had just you know my wife was sick
[34:21] that first week then we're on vacation
[34:23] and now we had this you know lost in our
[34:24] life so it's just been already a busy
[34:26] busy summer
[34:29] okay so uh we have those thoughts
[34:32] and it's actually caught like behavior
[34:35] to never question the leader of the
[34:37] group
[34:38] that's a call when you cannot question
[34:40] or ask the leader any questions and you
[34:42] have to just believe them uh blind faith
[34:45] that's a cult that's right that's right
[34:48] jesus christ is the only one who we
[34:50] should believe without any questions
[34:52] amen that's right
[34:53] even then we wonder if things so we pray
[34:55] he reveals it to us or we gotta wait to
[34:56] get the revelation that's right
[34:58] that's why there are cults around the
[35:00] message because they worship brother
[35:02] branham and they're
[35:03] they're evil people they're simple
[35:05] people they need help they need
[35:06] deliverance they need honesty they need
[35:09] the spirit of truth amen that's right
[35:12] they've loved the lie they worshipped
[35:13] the lord
[35:16] we're not of that type
[35:17] because we've got the holy spirit here
[35:19] by god's grace
[35:20] and he is the spirit of truth
[35:22] hallelujah amen
[35:24] now let's get your bibles ready let's
[35:26] get some real good doctrine deuteronomy
[35:28] 7 verse 1 deuteronomy 7 verse 1.
[35:32] church if you're turning there
[35:34] let me get there and then
[35:37] well
[35:39] deuteronomy 7 verse 1.
[35:42] okay let's pretend
[35:44] well i could even use austin
[35:46] or lena or anybody or even myself
[35:49] before we came to the message when we
[35:50] thought about interracial marriage did
[35:52] we think good or bad we thought okay
[35:53] right austin
[35:55] before i was in the message i didn't
[35:57] receive the message that i was 21.
[35:59] now was i uncomfortable with it yes
[36:01] because i was raised in a white area
[36:04] i didn't know one black person until i
[36:05] got to college
[36:07] right
[36:08] i was so isolated because we were poor
[36:10] that's why because we could we didn't
[36:11] have any money to travel we were dirt
[36:13] poor
[36:14] well maybe not dirt floor but pretty
[36:16] close to poor
[36:19] it was when i went to akron and had all
[36:21] these black and asian it was all new to
[36:23] me because all i knew was white farm
[36:25] people i thought
[36:26] i laughed at it now but that i was
[36:28] sheltered
[36:30] i was the one that was being made fun of
[36:32] for being multiracial
[36:34] i was the minority
[36:37] being name called me
[36:41] and then when i went around real
[36:43] minorities i was just i didn't know how
[36:44] to handle myself it was just try to be
[36:46] humble try to learn
[36:48] because they're just uh whenever you're
[36:50] in a new situation don't get nervous how
[36:51] about lena when you moved to ohio was it
[36:53] different than arizona
[36:55] yeah
[36:57] better in some ways not as good in other
[36:58] ways you know it's just a new new
[37:00] environment
[37:02] right
[37:04] but the point i'm making is that had we
[37:06] not when we didn't know program's stance
[37:08] on it we thought it was okay it was just
[37:10] different we you know
[37:13] i'm just uncomfortable because i never
[37:14] knew anybody from any other different uh
[37:17] background than just white
[37:20] and really the only one i knew was
[37:21] actually spanish because my side so when
[37:23] i would go to family gatherings they
[37:24] would talk spanish and
[37:26] sometimes then sometimes english i would
[37:28] just try to
[37:29] you know mainly my grandparents all
[37:31] spoke spanish most of the time
[37:34] that was on my mom's side and so i was
[37:36] just i was just always a little
[37:37] uncomfortable there i didn't know if my
[37:38] grandfather was happy or sad
[37:40] sometimes you can't tell them the words
[37:42] they're saying you know
[37:43] but i know i know they love me you know
[37:45] i know they express love to me
[37:48] but even growing up i was the minority
[37:50] in fact i'll just say like this this is
[37:52] the one where people don't get mad if
[37:54] you say but my brothers and i because we
[37:55] were darker and and mexican they called
[37:58] a
[37:59] that's a really awful name that's a slur
[38:01] name are those have you ever heard that
[38:02] before yeah we were called that growing
[38:05] up
[38:06] i was even called the n-word because i
[38:07] was so dark
[38:09] i get really dark in the summertime i
[38:10] look at maokai maokai's been out well
[38:12] you have to see his arms later i just
[38:14] spent all summer out of the sun so i
[38:16] mean i look i look real dumb i was
[38:17] called the n word and i would go home
[38:19] crying
[38:20] so i was the minority
[38:23] as a mexican i was the minority in a
[38:25] white community i was made not by
[38:26] everybody just there were just these one
[38:27] a couple of evil kids that would do it
[38:31] and so i would go home and cry my
[38:32] parents would see me cry why are you
[38:34] crying well they called me the n word
[38:36] it was because during basketball for the
[38:38] austin i was blocking their shots and i
[38:39] was rebounding i was scoring
[38:42] i was better than some of these guys at
[38:44] basketball so they called me the n-word
[38:46] and so my dad didn't know how to handle
[38:48] it my dad made a joke out of all the
[38:50] problems so my dad said well you're my
[38:51] only black son jesse that's what he
[38:53] would tell me
[38:54] and he was we were laughing about it
[38:56] he just said well you're alone my only
[38:58] black son so i said okay dad
[39:00] i just kind of learned to live with it
[39:02] well it stopped after a few years you
[39:03] know i didn't get it
[39:05] too bad after that
[39:07] but i'm just trying to let you
[39:08] understand like i was raised in an
[39:09] environment where i was the minority
[39:12] and with not knowing the message of
[39:14] brother branham i thought it would
[39:15] marriage interracial marriage was okay
[39:19] because i didn't know anything wrong
[39:20] with it if you just read the bible you
[39:23] don't see anything wrong with it
[39:25] i'm going to say it again
[39:26] in case the people online missed it if
[39:28] you just read the bible you never see
[39:31] anything wrong with it right
[39:33] because the word race is only in the
[39:35] bible four times and it's not talking
[39:36] about ethnic groups it's talking about
[39:38] running a physical
[39:40] race race is a newer modern type of word
[39:44] for
[39:44] ethnicity
[39:47] the real bible words aren't nation
[39:49] that's the real bible word
[39:50] nation
[39:52] because god separated them after tower
[39:54] of babel he suffered them into nations
[39:57] okay
[39:58] now verse 1
[40:00] when the lord thy god shall bring in the
[40:01] land which thou goest to possess it and
[40:03] has cast away many nations before thee
[40:06] and look the hittites the gergeshites
[40:08] the amorites and the canaanites
[40:10] and notice what are they called nations
[40:14] and the parasites and the divines and
[40:15] the jebusites seven nations greater
[40:17] mighty than that but on the verse three
[40:18] neither shalt thou make any marriages
[40:20] with them thy daughter thou shalt not
[40:22] give to his son nor his daughter
[40:24] shalt thou take to thy son
[40:26] why why because they were different no
[40:29] actually they were the their neighbors
[40:31] were the exact same skin color as them
[40:33] they're all middle easterners
[40:38] right so they have the same they they
[40:39] all look the same
[40:41] they got darker skin usually black hair
[40:43] right middle easterners
[40:45] think about that iraq
[40:47] syrians you know
[40:49] israelites
[40:50] egyptians they all have the darker skin
[40:53] color right the
[40:54] it's kind of like middle dark
[40:57] black hair brother says that brother
[40:59] says all all the easterners have the
[41:01] dark skin he calls it
[41:03] dark
[41:04] eyes
[41:06] why can't you marry verse 4 for they
[41:08] will turn away thy son from following me
[41:11] amen
[41:13] so god forbid nations that looked alike
[41:17] he forbid them for marion why because of
[41:20] the spiritual influence your spouse will
[41:22] have on you that's why god said the main
[41:25] thing to worry about when getting
[41:26] married is the spiritual influence
[41:30] it's not so much physical it's spiritual
[41:33] that has nothing new physical really
[41:36] nothing physical
[41:37] it's all spiritual
[41:39] okay
[41:41] i'm going to go to joshua 23 12.
[41:48] 23 12 and 13.
[41:52] we'll just read 12 though for time's
[41:54] sake so these are the first times god is
[41:56] saying don't marry don't marry and he's
[41:58] saying it's not because of physical it's
[42:00] because of spiritual
[42:03] if you've just read the bible this is
[42:05] the conclusion you come to
[42:08] but we've got a lot of people around the
[42:09] message that don't want to read the
[42:10] bible
[42:11] shame shame on them
[42:14] brother man's whole message was to
[42:15] restore the apostolic doctrine
[42:18] the faith of the fathers and yes the
[42:19] power amen the same power same doctrine
[42:22] same authority same life same spirit
[42:24] same truth it's all restored by the
[42:26] spirit of elijah amen
[42:28] that's what it's done to our church amen
[42:31] glory
[42:32] joshua 23 12. else if you do in any wise
[42:35] go back and cleave unto the remnant of
[42:37] these what nation not racist because
[42:38] that's a modern word it's nations
[42:42] even these that remain among you and you
[42:43] shall make marriages with them and going
[42:45] unto them and they to you no for a
[42:47] certainty the lord thy god will no more
[42:50] drive out any of these nations from
[42:51] before you
[42:52] see because these nations and their
[42:54] idols and their sin that was a snare had
[42:58] nothing to do with the physical it was
[43:00] all about the spiritual influence
[43:01] what is this husband is this husband
[43:03] gonna point you more to christ or point
[43:05] you to the world
[43:06] is this wife gonna point you to jesus
[43:07] christ or try to persuade you to leave
[43:10] that's what god was interested in
[43:12] not physical but spiritual
[43:15] the church said
[43:16] amen
[43:18] so i can find there's three requirements
[43:19] for marriage
[43:21] the first one is you have to marry a
[43:23] believer
[43:24] and brother said that no believer should
[43:26] ever marry an unbeliever under no
[43:28] circumstance should always marry
[43:30] believers that's right okay that was
[43:32] 1960 i'm sorry 1959 be certain of god
[43:36] this is true for old testament new
[43:37] testament i just showed you old
[43:39] testament
[43:40] now the new testament malachi people
[43:42] first corinthians 7 39 this is familiar
[43:45] to us but just so you can see it
[43:48] so
[43:49] a believer can marry any believer as
[43:52] long as they're led of the holy spirit
[43:54] uh and it doesn't matter the nation it
[43:56] matters the faith
[43:57] okay so this is the spiritual nation
[43:59] there it is
[44:02] doesn't matter what physical nation you
[44:04] come from it's the spiritual nation the
[44:06] spiritual priesthood hallelujah amen
[44:09] that's right
[44:10] glory
[44:12] bible calls is a holy nation
[44:14] glory
[44:16] okay so there it is uh the wife here's a
[44:19] wife her husband's died
[44:21] uh if her husband's dead she's a liberty
[44:23] to mary to whom she will only in the
[44:25] lord now if paul ever wanted to say
[44:27] don't marry
[44:28] don't marry a different nation this
[44:29] would have been the time to do it
[44:32] but he says
[44:33] only in the lord
[44:35] only marry a believer praise god
[44:38] okay hallelujah now the second one is
[44:41] uh in the new testament the believer
[44:43] could know could not have a living
[44:45] spouse or else it's adultery matthew 5
[44:47] 32
[44:48] the type you guys going to be busy for a
[44:50] few moments here
[44:52] matthew 5 32
[44:53] jesus says whosoever puts away his wife
[44:55] safe for the cause of fornication that's
[44:57] like joseph and mary right joseph
[44:59] thought she'd already had fornication
[45:00] was going to put her away of course she
[45:01] didn't
[45:03] because causes her to commit adultery
[45:05] and whosoever shall marry her that's
[45:06] divorced cometh adultery
[45:09] now in the old testament though you
[45:10] could divorce and remarry with the
[45:12] living spouse
[45:13] but
[45:14] but jesus said that was because of the
[45:16] hardness of their hearts
[45:17] just so you know that was the old
[45:18] testament you probably know that yeah
[45:20] i'm just showing you so a christian has
[45:21] to marry a believer and it can have no
[45:23] living spouse
[45:26] and the third one you must have an
[45:28] honest bow this is important in both the
[45:30] old testament new testament we're not
[45:31] going to read it but numbers 30 verses 1
[45:33] to 16 talks about all the vows
[45:36] the couple before they're married they
[45:37] have to go through the dads right that's
[45:38] it make sure the vows are honest and
[45:40] everything
[45:41] and then go to uh matthew 19 9 matthew
[45:43] 19 9. this is the great scripture on
[45:45] marriage and divorce
[45:47] along with matthew 5 32 of matthew 19 9
[45:50] whosoever should put away his wife
[45:52] except be for fornication and shall
[45:53] marry another committeth adultery and
[45:55] whosoever married her which is put awake
[45:57] nothing adultery so the new testament if
[45:59] a couple got married and the man found
[46:01] out the wife was dishonest with the vow
[46:04] after they were married he could put her
[46:06] away and marry another but church i
[46:07] would just plead with that man don't you
[46:09] love that woman enough to just stay
[46:10] married to her
[46:13] god hates divorce
[46:16] you'd be surprised i have people email
[46:17] me all the time well this happened at
[46:19] our church uh the woman didn't confess
[46:20] her fortification i said but don't the
[46:21] man love her
[46:23] hasn't she been good to him
[46:25] she's probably he's probably washed his
[46:26] clothes fed him she's probably bored
[46:28] children
[46:31] it's for many people it's an excuse just
[46:33] a lust after another woman
[46:35] absolutely
[46:37] but jesus gives the only way to do it
[46:39] right because we've all heard about it
[46:41] oh they just look for an opportunity
[46:44] because they're lustful
[46:46] and they forget about the fact that they
[46:49] forget about the fact that in the
[46:50] spiritual marriage they're unfaithful to
[46:52] their husband every day
[46:54] because
[47:02] that's why i advise everybody don't put
[47:04] her away even if she didn't confess it
[47:07] that'd be my
[47:08] advice if you want somebody to marry us
[47:11] and go somewhere else
[47:12] i can do it
[47:15] you took a vow
[47:17] you said death to your part i know the
[47:18] vow wasn't honest
[47:20] but pray about it
[47:22] god hates divorce
[47:24] one time in college i met a friend and
[47:26] uh
[47:27] i just come in the message and i learned
[47:28] about you know virginity and uh
[47:31] the importance of you know certain
[47:33] things
[47:34] and this this this friend of mine was
[47:35] gonna
[47:36] marry this girl you know i heard brother
[47:38] talk about you know a wife woman keeping
[47:39] her pure and wanting to marry you know
[47:41] things like that i just thought it was
[47:43] so i just thought thinking i was so
[47:44] beautiful i was a little more immature
[47:47] at that time and i said i said you know
[47:49] you're my friend but you know uh this
[47:51] this woman has like a past history
[47:54] wouldn't you want to have a woman that
[47:55] had no past history and he said i love
[47:57] her so much
[47:58] that i know god's forgiven her and i've
[48:00] forgiven her
[48:02] and i thought
[48:03] here's there i thought that's real love
[48:04] right there but see in my in my immature
[48:07] state i'm like well i'm listening to
[48:08] brother brown all the time but it's good
[48:10] but i just i never really thought
[48:12] outside of just
[48:13] just outside of these sermons
[48:16] i thought wow what a beautiful
[48:17] expression of love and really that man
[48:19] probably had sexual sin he committed
[48:21] right right brothers
[48:24] and so
[48:25] if we're not careful we become
[48:26] self-righteous but god doesn't like
[48:28] self-righteousness amen amen
[48:30] god loves humanity praise god and we've
[48:33] all fallen short of the glory of god
[48:35] amen amen jesus said if you lust in your
[48:37] heart you've already committed adultery
[48:38] well every guy is guilty of that every
[48:40] guy's an adulterer or a fornicator right
[48:42] that's right
[48:43] before marriage or you know whatever
[48:46] so you can make a case
[48:49] you know uh that we could if we want we
[48:52] can be self-righteous and condemn
[48:53] anybody
[48:55] but god the righteous one doesn't do
[48:57] that god expresses mercy amen hallelujah
[49:00] praise god god expresses grace
[49:03] he offers redemption hallelujah amen
[49:06] i wasn't actually planning on preaching
[49:07] on that but
[49:09] so there's only three requirements for
[49:10] marriage both believers
[49:13] no living spouse
[49:15] and then an honest vow but again if you
[49:17] love that person
[49:19] and even if they felt so pressured they
[49:21] lied
[49:22] wouldn't you want to forgive them
[49:25] god hates divorce
[49:27] i know god hates lying too but who
[49:28] hasn't lied
[49:31] who hasn't lied
[49:35] now
[49:37] marriage within nations or can i say
[49:39] races
[49:42] was possible with israel
[49:44] through proselyting or through
[49:46] spiritual conversions
[49:49] okay this is the beautiful part
[49:52] hallelujah glory
[49:54] even in the abrahamic covenant uh keep
[49:56] paul genesis 17 12 malachi
[50:02] god told abraham you i'm going to give
[50:04] you the covenant of circumcision and
[50:06] this is for all the men whether they're
[50:08] jew or gentile
[50:10] because you may get some slaves right
[50:12] you may get some uh
[50:13] uh 17-7 i'm sorry 17-12 sorry 17-12.
[50:17] he said you may get a sojourner
[50:20] and you got to circumcise those men
[50:22] anyway even the gentiles
[50:24] verse 12. you got it
[50:26] is it not working
[50:28] i can just read it okay it's not working
[50:29] okay uh genesis 17 12. oh there you go
[50:34] every man in your generations he that's
[50:35] born your house are bought with money of
[50:37] a stranger which is not of thy seed so
[50:40] any gentile you buy that comes in you've
[50:42] got to circumcise them well now gentiles
[50:44] are going to be in the abrahamic
[50:45] covenant
[50:48] so as long as they convert and as long
[50:50] as they're
[50:51] brought into your your house they gotta
[50:53] follow the covenant that's right okay go
[50:56] to numbers 19 10. this is about this i
[50:58] just want to preach on the waters of
[51:00] separation a few years ago that's a
[51:02] glorious revelation
[51:03] uh he that gathereth the ashes of the
[51:05] heifer shall wash his clothes and be
[51:07] unclean until the even and it shall be
[51:09] unto the children of israel and
[51:11] unto the stranger that so journalist
[51:13] among them for a statue forever
[51:16] remember if they contacted a dead person
[51:18] they could not come to the outer court
[51:21] they touch a dead person or was unclean
[51:23] in any other way everybody
[51:27] in order to get back into fellowship you
[51:29] had to be sprinkled with the waters of
[51:31] separation amen
[51:34] you had to be sprinkled and then wait
[51:35] seven days or three and a half days uh
[51:37] you gotta recognize your guilty wait uh
[51:40] you're unclean get sprinkle wait three
[51:42] and a half days
[51:43] uh then come back three and a half days
[51:44] later then you can come into the
[51:46] congregation praise god
[51:48] hallelujah
[51:50] and so
[51:52] any any any gentile in order to be
[51:55] brought into the faith could be brought
[51:57] in by the same way by the waters of
[51:59] separation that's right no verse by the
[52:01] blood of the lamb amen
[52:05] now from the time of abraham until
[52:07] solomon they had amassed over 153
[52:11] 600 gentiles
[52:13] i put that in my book that's in verse 2
[52:16] chronicles 2 17 we don't have to read it
[52:18] now imagine that they start out all all
[52:20] jews
[52:23] but give it 500 years now they have a
[52:24] huge portion of their group
[52:28] 153 000 are now gentiles
[52:32] god
[52:33] and brother rabbit says in the church
[52:34] age book
[52:37] he says jezebel was not a daughter of
[52:39] abraham
[52:41] he said
[52:43] as her nor is her induction into the
[52:45] tribes of israel one of spiritual
[52:47] admission as that of ruth the moabitess
[52:52] okay so now we're going to start getting
[52:53] some examples here which i'm sure some
[52:54] of you are familiar with
[52:56] so jezebel did not come into the israel
[52:58] she only come in my marriage she didn't
[53:00] come in by the spiritual process
[53:02] amen
[53:04] she didn't know where she didn't get
[53:05] sprinkled with the waters of separation
[53:06] thank god you've been sprinkled with the
[53:09] waters of separation the blood of jesus
[53:11] christ amen
[53:13] you are brought into the covenant you
[53:15] have a part of the covenant you're heir
[53:17] to the promises of god amen amen in
[53:20] other words you inherit eternal life and
[53:22] a portion of eternal life amen
[53:25] because you've been sprinkled by the
[53:27] blood of jesus christ amen
[53:30] that's right
[53:32] that's how ruth was
[53:34] we'll get to ruth in a minute now i've
[53:36] got uh five examples of godly marriages
[53:39] between different nations or races
[53:42] and i want to remind you jesus christ is
[53:45] the same yesterday
[53:47] today
[53:48] and forever amen
[53:50] i'm the lord thy god and i changed that
[53:53] the first one is joseph and
[53:55] asanav
[53:58] genesis 41 45
[54:00] god
[54:01] and look at this god arranged an
[54:04] egyptian they were the most evil of all
[54:06] right they were the world power of the
[54:08] time
[54:09] the greatest heathens
[54:11] the enemy
[54:13] and god brings joseph to save the whole
[54:16] world
[54:17] and gives him a gentile life
[54:20] egyptian wife
[54:23] okay
[54:25] brother branham says
[54:28] notice he said
[54:29] joseph given a gentile wife
[54:32] and he bore gentile children half
[54:34] gentile half
[54:36] jew
[54:38] so ephraim and manassas were half breeds
[54:41] and the church said
[54:42] that's kind of a joke yeah
[54:45] that's a joke
[54:46] because i'm a half breed
[54:48] i'm one i'm a half a breed of uh english
[54:52] half a breed of mexican
[54:54] now i've got the dna to prove it i can
[54:56] prove it
[54:57] it's amazing brother they took my dna
[54:59] and they can go down to the very town
[55:00] where my grandparents were born wow
[55:03] and my grandparents don't even have a
[55:05] dna on their system
[55:06] but just because they match so many dnas
[55:08] of different people they can find my dna
[55:10] right to the very town that's the time
[55:12] my grandparents were born in
[55:14] without having any dna from my
[55:15] grandparents
[55:16] i'll tell you dna is powerful
[55:18] but there's more i got a lot more than
[55:20] that by god's rights later on
[55:23] half breed brotherhood said they're half
[55:25] jew half gentile
[55:28] now i just got to ask these questions
[55:30] because i'm going to get to some quotes
[55:31] from brother branham
[55:34] was it wrong for joseph's children to be
[55:36] half greed
[55:38] what do you think
[55:40] no
[55:40] because god ordained their marriage
[55:43] god
[55:45] joseph told his brothers
[55:47] god sent me to egypt amen
[55:50] you didn't send me here god sent me here
[55:53] amen
[55:54] in other words god sent him there and
[55:56] had a gentile wife preparing for her
[55:58] there
[56:00] oh
[56:03] god sent me here to save life
[56:07] so as an f would have been converted to
[56:09] become a jew
[56:12] right
[56:13] because god said never marry amongst an
[56:15] unbeliever
[56:17] praise god
[56:19] that's on the that's on the show too
[56:21] right uh i think nature said did you
[56:22] watch joseph thank you
[56:24] monsters okay yeah so yeah remember
[56:26] remember that on there do you remember
[56:27] when asked you become a believer you
[56:29] remember that yeah i haven't watched it
[56:31] too much that's why i'm asking you
[56:32] i just seen bits and pieces
[56:35] but at first she's like oh there's many
[56:37] gods and joseph's like there's one guy
[56:40] and then later she's like i love you
[56:42] joseph and there's one true god will you
[56:44] marry me
[56:46] no god god ordained it
[56:48] and then at church
[56:49] god took these two boys ibrahimovic half
[56:52] breeds
[56:54] and he gives them a place among the 12
[56:56] tribes of israel and then god thought so
[56:59] much of these half reads brother william
[57:01] that
[57:02] two of those 24 seats up in heaven are
[57:04] reserved and he's half for eighteen men
[57:06] that's right i didn't even have praise
[57:08] god i'm using having freedom expression
[57:10] because that's what brother adam calls
[57:12] because that's because that's the
[57:14] culture that they were in
[57:16] there's a lot of pressure i'm gonna get
[57:17] that there's a lot of pressure on
[57:18] brother there's a lot of pressure on
[57:19] everybody at that time
[57:21] you know your race and your nationality
[57:23] was a huge thing in those days
[57:29] so see god bless joseph's marriage
[57:31] god ordained that's why the title is god
[57:34] ordains interracial marriages
[57:37] god ordains him at times
[57:41] and he blesses the sons they get they
[57:43] get huge portions of land
[57:46] half tribe of manasseh half of them are
[57:48] on the other side of jordan another half
[57:50] on the other side
[57:52] and it gives them two of the 24 seats
[57:54] around the throne
[57:56] second example moses and zephora we read
[57:57] this one earlier
[57:59] now what's interesting about zappora she
[58:01] was a ethiopian which means a cushite
[58:05] and cushite was the land that was
[58:08] the southernmost part in africa
[58:12] according to the lexicon it means from
[58:14] the most southern parts of the nile
[58:16] river which leads to ethiopia
[58:20] so zipporah is from
[58:23] is it central africa brother where's
[58:24] ethiopia look up ethiopia
[58:27] east
[58:28] east east africa
[58:30] northeast okay
[58:31] so northeast africa
[58:33] so god god finds a woman
[58:36] that he knows will be perfect for his
[58:38] prophet
[58:40] amen a prophet amen
[58:43] god said i need a woman for my prophet
[58:46] it wasn't going to be a hebrew woman
[58:48] it was going to be a cushion
[58:51] ethiopian woman
[58:53] see because it's not our choice church
[58:55] it's god's choice amen
[58:57] god's choosing amen and we either accept
[59:00] god's choice or we get rid of god's
[59:02] choice i'm going to accept god's choice
[59:03] for my life don't you
[59:05] we want to take god's choice god's ways
[59:07] are higher than our ways praise god
[59:10] god's thoughts are greater than our
[59:11] thoughts
[59:13] so zebora is interesting she was a
[59:15] ethiopian but living in the midianite
[59:18] region
[59:19] because her father was a midianite
[59:21] so midian was an area closer to israel
[59:25] so she must have been an immigrant right
[59:27] or she must have moved from ethiopia and
[59:29] now she's living in the midianite land
[59:31] which had a map that's one thing i
[59:32] forgot to get was a map that might help
[59:34] you
[59:35] but either way you don't understand the
[59:37] story
[59:38] moses was hebrew
[59:41] zipporah was ethiopian
[59:43] different nations
[59:46] no doubt different skin colors
[59:49] and god placed them together
[59:51] god stood up for this marriage amen
[59:55] god stood up for his prophet and his
[59:56] prophet's wife amen
[59:58] hallelujah don't you speak against them
[1:00:04] so see you know years ago when i was in
[1:00:05] the message when i first come i was i
[1:00:07] was going to the church in lima
[1:00:09] this
[1:00:10] interracial marriage issue became a big
[1:00:12] deal because
[1:00:13] one of my pastors children who was black
[1:00:16] married a white person
[1:00:18] and it created quite a stir
[1:00:20] because because of this people
[1:00:22] message people aren't always that
[1:00:23] spiritual
[1:00:25] and not all message people are born
[1:00:26] again
[1:00:29] it was a huge deal
[1:00:31] and i just studied out pray it out
[1:00:35] and i came to that conclusion god
[1:00:37] ordained this marriage moses is
[1:00:40] important
[1:00:41] god ordained it and i just told the
[1:00:43] people i said well i said i feel sorry
[1:00:45] for these people that are speaking
[1:00:46] against our church
[1:00:48] and you'd be surprised not not not even
[1:00:50] the whole church attended the wedding
[1:00:51] which really showed which side people
[1:00:53] are wrong
[1:00:54] it was really sad i mean it's happened
[1:00:55] one way i was happy for the couple
[1:00:57] another way i was sad
[1:00:58] but i came to that conclusion i just
[1:01:00] said god be merciful for them if they
[1:01:02] speak against it
[1:01:04] because then you're speaking against god
[1:01:06] right
[1:01:07] and that was that story i told you where
[1:01:09] a brother said i've got to go against uh
[1:01:12] a pastor and four of his uh
[1:01:15] or four other pastors and he called him
[1:01:17] giants
[1:01:18] so there was a minister in the message
[1:01:20] he's still alive but i emailed him about
[1:01:21] this last summer
[1:01:24] and he wasn't talking about me actually
[1:01:26] he was talking about my pastor and the
[1:01:28] other pastors in the area that supported
[1:01:30] interracial marriage and this this
[1:01:32] preacher he lives in texas the texas
[1:01:35] preacher was against these ohio
[1:01:36] creatures because they supported
[1:01:38] interracial marriage and he called
[1:01:39] himself david and he called the other
[1:01:40] preachers goliath and giants
[1:01:44] and this guy's got so much false
[1:01:45] documents
[1:01:47] he even said that jesus never carried
[1:01:48] his cross and he's right there in the
[1:01:49] bible i mean these people are just so
[1:01:51] they're just insane
[1:01:53] the problem is they're not born again
[1:01:54] the problem is they got hatred in their
[1:01:56] hearts or they got some bitterness or
[1:01:57] some pride or something like that they
[1:01:58] got to get they ought to clean out they
[1:02:00] ought to root out all the rich and
[1:02:01] fairness out of their life
[1:02:05] but that's what god revealed to me woe
[1:02:07] into them if they speak against it
[1:02:08] because god's going to fight against
[1:02:09] them
[1:02:12] that's right
[1:02:13] because what god do to disappoint i'm
[1:02:15] sorry what did god do to marry him
[1:02:17] god gave her leprosy
[1:02:20] right
[1:02:25] okay now
[1:02:29] i preached on support i think for
[1:02:30] mother's day didn't i last year
[1:02:32] i didn't look that up either i should
[1:02:33] look that up
[1:02:35] so god chose two different people moses
[1:02:37] and zipporah from different
[1:02:39] nationalities or races and brought them
[1:02:42] together
[1:02:45] okay
[1:02:46] while i'm here let me read the good
[1:02:48] quotes i mean they're all good quotes
[1:02:49] about moses and sephora
[1:02:54] they asked brother iran does the
[1:02:55] scripture mean that god aimed to kill
[1:02:57] moses
[1:02:58] for not circumcising his son and yet
[1:03:00] your brother said yes god was after
[1:03:02] moses and zipporah was the only one that
[1:03:04] saved him there
[1:03:07] so god said i know my prophet at some
[1:03:09] point is going to be disobedient i need
[1:03:11] a woman
[1:03:12] that will take some initiative and go
[1:03:15] out and obey the bible when her husband
[1:03:17] does it
[1:03:18] the church said right now
[1:03:20] i'm gonna say that again
[1:03:23] for our brothers
[1:03:25] god said i need to find a woman
[1:03:27] who even though her prophet husband
[1:03:29] isn't obeying the abrahamic covenant she
[1:03:31] will take initiative and she will go
[1:03:33] save his life and follow the covenant
[1:03:36] even when he won't i need a woman with
[1:03:38] some initiative to obey the word of god
[1:03:40] amen
[1:03:42] and the eyes of the lord brother
[1:03:44] the eyes of the lord went all through
[1:03:45] hebrew couldn't find anybody in hebrew
[1:03:47] went through all these lands and the
[1:03:49] eyes lord come down there to ethiopia
[1:03:51] there's a woman here's what here's the
[1:03:53] move that respects god amen
[1:03:59] she said thou art a bloody house
[1:04:00] underneath moses
[1:04:02] and she saved his life church
[1:04:04] hallelujah
[1:04:06] the eyes of the lord run to and fro
[1:04:08] about the earth so that god may show
[1:04:10] himself strong in every nation
[1:04:17] how come these guys don't preach that
[1:04:18] quote
[1:04:20] because they're not real believers
[1:04:22] but they got really they're they're in
[1:04:24] deep in sin but random said again he
[1:04:27] said was it moses made fun of by his
[1:04:29] sister and his brother the one time he
[1:04:31] married a colored girl ethiopian now
[1:04:33] colored is not the right expression
[1:04:35] anymore that's not politically correct
[1:04:36] so i'm sorry if that offends people i'm
[1:04:38] sorry for the defense people but that's
[1:04:40] how they talked about in america in the
[1:04:41] 1960s and 50s so i'm sorry
[1:04:45] every color is beautiful and really
[1:04:46] everybody wants to be darker right i
[1:04:47] mean
[1:04:49] darker well i shouldn't say that but
[1:04:51] yeah most people want to be darker
[1:04:54] right you know who doesn't like who
[1:04:55] doesn't like a nice tan
[1:04:57] it just looks
[1:04:58] beautiful
[1:05:01] but
[1:05:05] he said and did they make fun and god
[1:05:07] happened to be present and heard it was
[1:05:08] that right he was just present and heard
[1:05:10] it and he said god said bring them here
[1:05:12] don't you fear god
[1:05:14] knowing that i've seen what i've done
[1:05:15] for that man and showed him the favors
[1:05:20] see so his brother and sister needed
[1:05:21] something against moses so they said
[1:05:23] well he didn't marry a hebrew so let's
[1:05:25] use that so we can exalt ourselves we
[1:05:28] have gifts we've seen visions we've
[1:05:29] we've had dreams and god said don't you
[1:05:31] know
[1:05:32] that he's a prophet i'm speaking lift it
[1:05:34] here i said you just see dreams and
[1:05:36] visions but i speak lifting here to him
[1:05:38] that's right
[1:05:39] weren't you afraid to speak against the
[1:05:41] man of god for the marriage that i i set
[1:05:44] up praise god i set that up amen
[1:05:50] another quote
[1:05:51] said miriam showed her trespassing too
[1:05:53] when she laughed moses or laughed at
[1:05:56] because moses married this negro girl so
[1:05:58] negro negros again a word we don't use
[1:06:00] anymore i'm sorry that offends anybody
[1:06:02] but i'm just reading the quote okay
[1:06:05] and brother man said and they basically
[1:06:07] said wasn't there any other girls to be
[1:06:08] married and so forth
[1:06:11] god wasn't pleased with that and smote
[1:06:13] her with leprosy
[1:06:15] so see miriam was critical of moses and
[1:06:18] she wanted some of that power and
[1:06:18] authority so she found the only thing i
[1:06:20] can criticize moses for is her his
[1:06:22] marriage to someone who doesn't look
[1:06:24] like us
[1:06:25] and god said that's awful god gave her a
[1:06:27] leprosy
[1:06:29] but god healed her because of aaron's
[1:06:31] intercession moses intercession so that
[1:06:33] shows like miriam must have been the
[1:06:35] instigator behind it
[1:06:37] right because mo aaron didn't get the
[1:06:38] leprosy miranda pursuit
[1:06:41] she must have won she must been the one
[1:06:42] like the instigator really trying to
[1:06:44] find fault with god's prophet
[1:06:47] right
[1:06:49] here's what i like this is one of like
[1:06:51] respects 1961.
[1:06:53] one day miriam
[1:06:55] a prophetess and aaron the high priest
[1:06:56] made fun of moses white because she was
[1:06:58] ethiopian
[1:06:59] and they thought well wasn't there
[1:07:00] enough women of our own group to marry
[1:07:03] instead of going down there and marrying
[1:07:05] that woman that's what they thought
[1:07:08] wasn't there a better person to marry
[1:07:10] why'd you have to marry out of our
[1:07:11] nation
[1:07:13] but said that wasn't moses's choice
[1:07:16] that was god's choice for moses
[1:07:18] amen who chose this interracial marriage
[1:07:21] god had amen
[1:07:23] who chose joseph's interracial marriage
[1:07:25] god did god sent
[1:07:27] [Applause]
[1:07:28] amen amen
[1:07:30] amen see how church we got the bible to
[1:07:31] stand by
[1:07:33] all the other side they just have
[1:07:34] arguments
[1:07:36] they just have quote wars
[1:07:38] but we don't have quote wars we're not
[1:07:40] interested in argument we're interested
[1:07:41] in love and the truth of god amen
[1:07:44] that points us back to the bible praise
[1:07:46] god
[1:07:48] never was popular and ever will be i'm
[1:07:50] not interested in popularity i'm
[1:07:51] interested in god's favor amen amen
[1:07:54] to have the right spirit
[1:07:56] to have the real love of jesus christ
[1:07:58] that's what i'm interested in
[1:08:00] are you two
[1:08:01] i know
[1:08:03] i gotta ask you
[1:08:05] they made fun of it what is choice for
[1:08:07] marriage and angered god in such a way
[1:08:09] till he struck miriam the prophetess
[1:08:10] with full of leprosy moses own sister
[1:08:14] what was she doing she was making fun
[1:08:16] and irreverence to god's messenger the
[1:08:18] messenger of the covenant to that day
[1:08:21] the very mouthpiece the mouthpiece of
[1:08:23] god that's right
[1:08:26] now church if you listen to unveiling of
[1:08:28] god in 1964 brother branham says
[1:08:31] in the millennium
[1:08:32] elohim will sit on the throne the
[1:08:34] self-existent one
[1:08:36] with all the subjects that he
[1:08:38] predestinated from the foundation of the
[1:08:40] world
[1:08:43] like a man building chimes like a chime
[1:08:45] is like a bell
[1:08:47] each bell's got a different ring from
[1:08:49] another the same materials but so much
[1:08:51] iron so much steel so much brass to give
[1:08:54] it the right team
[1:08:56] that's exactly what god did he bred this
[1:08:59] one to that one to that one to this one
[1:09:01] to that one until he got exactly what he
[1:09:04] wanted that's how he come down god
[1:09:06] veiled himself in a pillar of fire
[1:09:08] through down to the prophets then into
[1:09:10] the son of god which he was god see he's
[1:09:12] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:09:14] bringing
[1:09:15] out exactly from perfection of
[1:09:17] perfection from glory to glory that's
[1:09:19] the way the church goes amen
[1:09:22] glory amen
[1:09:24] in other words god needed uh god needed
[1:09:26] you and so god had your grandparents
[1:09:29] that grandparent that grandparent that
[1:09:31] grandparent this grandparent that
[1:09:32] grandparent he had to breed it all
[1:09:34] together to your parents coming together
[1:09:36] and then he got exactly what he wanted
[1:09:38] he got a person with the right nature
[1:09:39] right character that he can use and he
[1:09:41] can strike you and you'll bring forth
[1:09:43] the right sound amen you'll bring
[1:09:45] forward the right testimony
[1:09:51] like for me god had to make me an
[1:09:52] athlete right so god had my uncles were
[1:09:54] i guess amazing athletes i don't know
[1:09:56] most of them were short but i had one
[1:09:57] tall uncle roger
[1:09:59] and it looked like i got his height i'm
[1:10:00] way taller than all my other brothers
[1:10:02] why am i i don't know but god had to
[1:10:03] give me this certain bill
[1:10:06] they say uh they say my grandparents
[1:10:08] also have some indian blood in them well
[1:10:09] i don't know about that yet
[1:10:11] but they say i'd have a certain bill to
[1:10:13] look a certain way and that's why my dad
[1:10:14] would call me his only black son you
[1:10:16] know that's fine but i had to have this
[1:10:17] sport i had to jump jump high run fast
[1:10:20] god had to give me this athletic ability
[1:10:22] in order to bring me to akron in order
[1:10:24] to humble me get me saved and become a
[1:10:26] pastor praise god
[1:10:28] that was in god's book amen that was how
[1:10:30] precious are god's thoughts up to me
[1:10:32] praise god
[1:10:34] i'd be called names because i was darker
[1:10:36] and i had to be god all kinds of things
[1:10:38] i'd be mocked and made fun of mistreated
[1:10:41] but i got through it
[1:10:43] and now the grace of god is here and i
[1:10:44] will never repeat that instead of
[1:10:46] spreading hatred or division or
[1:10:48] competition i'll spread love amen amen
[1:10:51] we'll rejoice in every skin color
[1:10:54] yes
[1:10:55] we do
[1:10:56] hallelujah
[1:10:58] every skin color i told the girls out
[1:11:00] last year when i preached and i said
[1:11:01] every skin color is beautiful
[1:11:03] because god ordained it
[1:11:05] hallelujah everyone's beautiful
[1:11:08] i just i was just saying like there's a
[1:11:10] move today in fashion where people want
[1:11:11] to be darker you know then that's that's
[1:11:14] like a women's you know women want to be
[1:11:16] darker for some reason
[1:11:18] i like being darker too so i i can
[1:11:19] relate to that
[1:11:21] i don't like looking all pale like i'm
[1:11:23] tired i'm like looking darker
[1:11:25] just my opinion
[1:11:28] so those are all those are the positive
[1:11:30] quotes about moses and the poor all
[1:11:32] positive
[1:11:34] i can't find i can't find one negative
[1:11:35] point about moses and support
[1:11:38] now it's already 12 let's see i started
[1:11:40] preaching
[1:11:40] is it
[1:11:42] okay
[1:11:44] how long have i been preaching
[1:11:46] what's it say
[1:11:52] over an hour okay well let me just close
[1:11:54] with these thoughts and then in another
[1:11:55] service i'll get to uh
[1:11:58] more more of these thoughts
[1:12:02] rahab rahab was a canaanite
[1:12:04] and she married salmon who was a hebrew
[1:12:09] now the bible specifically forbid
[1:12:12] israel marin canaanites
[1:12:14] they could not marry them i already read
[1:12:16] one to you deuteronomy 7 verse 6
[1:12:19] 1-6 god said do not marry canaanites and
[1:12:22] then salmon said can i marry you say
[1:12:24] will you marry me
[1:12:26] right heaven
[1:12:29] it's because rahab was no longer a
[1:12:32] canaanite spiritually ahead
[1:12:34] she become a jew spiritually hallelujah
[1:12:37] she said i believe i receive those two
[1:12:39] spies i receive the messengers i believe
[1:12:42] i want the token i want the red scarlet
[1:12:44] card put that in my house let the blood
[1:12:46] be upon my house amen
[1:12:52] yes that's right
[1:12:54] so now she became
[1:12:56] a jew spiritual
[1:12:57] hallelujah
[1:13:00] and what god do out of that former
[1:13:02] harlot what did god do out of her god
[1:13:04] brought boaz out that's right which
[1:13:06] married ruth a moabite
[1:13:09] out of them came over out of orbit came
[1:13:12] jesse i like the ninjas and then out of
[1:13:14] jesse came david
[1:13:16] on the day becomes solomon eventually on
[1:13:18] to jesus christ
[1:13:21] jesse means wealthy so i thought well
[1:13:23] maybe not i mean kind of in this world
[1:13:24] compared to other countries you know but
[1:13:26] i want to be spiritual wealthy
[1:13:28] the love of god i can be more valuable
[1:13:31] what how can we be more rich than to
[1:13:32] have the love of jesus christ hallelujah
[1:13:34] amen that's more for me so amen
[1:13:37] uh so rahab cain and i god said do not
[1:13:40] marry canaanites
[1:13:41] except they get married i'm sorry except
[1:13:43] they become into the
[1:13:44] faith boaz and boaz married ruth a
[1:13:48] moabite the bible specifically said well
[1:13:50] deuteronomy 23 verse 3. look at this
[1:13:52] church look at this
[1:13:54] oh my goodness
[1:13:56] deuteronomy 23
[1:13:58] verse 3
[1:13:59] and ammonite or moabite shall what not
[1:14:04] enter into the congregation lord even to
[1:14:06] their tenth generation shall they not
[1:14:08] enter into the congregation of the lord
[1:14:10] forever
[1:14:12] that church the bible doesn't tell us
[1:14:14] but do you think god
[1:14:16] would keep ruth out of the house of god
[1:14:21] naomi gave her the choice actually naomi
[1:14:24] told her don't come
[1:14:25] go back to your family
[1:14:27] and brother said she made that great
[1:14:29] decision there yep that's right said she
[1:14:31] burnt all the bridges behind her amen
[1:14:34] i think she said i've seen your life
[1:14:36] naomi i've seen your life and your god
[1:14:39] will be my god wherever you go i'll go
[1:14:42] wherever you die i'll die amen
[1:14:44] i'll confess the name of jehovah the
[1:14:46] self-existent one hallelujah the strong
[1:14:49] one hallelujah
[1:14:50] praise god and then you think god kept
[1:14:52] her out of the congregation
[1:14:54] no way
[1:14:55] no way nothing in history is recorded on
[1:14:57] that
[1:14:58] god let a moabite in when he said they
[1:15:00] can't come in
[1:15:01] god let her in because she became a
[1:15:02] spiritual kind of convert
[1:15:05] now of course you would not let a
[1:15:06] moabite come in if they were a believer
[1:15:09] you would keep them out
[1:15:12] but god had to accept roots because what
[1:15:13] comes out of ruth again obed
[1:15:16] jesse
[1:15:17] david solomon down to jesus christ
[1:15:21] and she's even mentioned in the
[1:15:22] genealogy of jesus that's right that's
[1:15:25] right that's right have amen
[1:15:27] god bless these canaanites moabites
[1:15:30] in his very lynch as a reminder that
[1:15:32] he's the god who loves all nations that
[1:15:34] he redeemed by the blood every nation
[1:15:36] get your time and tongue hallelujah
[1:15:39] amen and i'll make them kings and
[1:15:41] priests unto god
[1:15:42] [Applause]
[1:15:50] amen yeah
[1:15:53] the fifth one
[1:15:56] uriah the hittite
[1:15:59] you're right they hit that
[1:16:01] other man said one day in heaven he said
[1:16:03] i want to go up and
[1:16:04] talk to your eye and say your testimony
[1:16:05] meant something to me
[1:16:08] he was the hittite and the bible
[1:16:11] specifically said kill all the hittites
[1:16:18] they're supposed to cast them out
[1:16:19] deuteronomy 7 verse 1.
[1:16:21] deuteronomy 7 verse 1.
[1:16:24] remember this one
[1:16:30] okay there's the hittites
[1:16:33] i go down to verse uh three maokai
[1:16:38] neither shalt thou make any marriages
[1:16:40] with them thy daughter thou shalt not
[1:16:42] give to his
[1:16:44] that's exactly what happened to
[1:16:45] bathsheba and uriah
[1:16:49] bathsheba's dead gave bathsheba to uriah
[1:16:52] a hentai
[1:16:54] so this is not speaking of
[1:16:56] this is speaking of sinners
[1:16:59] never give your believing child to a
[1:17:01] sinner to marry
[1:17:04] but we know the story of uriah and i
[1:17:06] don't you know a lot of veterans went to
[1:17:07] that david show
[1:17:09] uriah was he was up there in the area
[1:17:11] where david was david was in the cave
[1:17:13] right
[1:17:15] and there was all these these the 300
[1:17:17] men they had debts they had all these
[1:17:18] problems they come to david and the
[1:17:20] bible said david made them mighty men
[1:17:23] in other words uriah come out of the
[1:17:25] world as a hittite and he recognized
[1:17:27] there's something different about david
[1:17:28] this guy's through the judge i'm gonna
[1:17:30] go sit under his ministry praise god
[1:17:32] in other words and he taught him out he
[1:17:34] became a believer he became a mighty man
[1:17:37] and uriah became one of the top three
[1:17:39] mighty men
[1:17:42] killing all kinds of uh evil bad guys
[1:17:44] and driving out the enemy
[1:17:46] he became a fearless warrior hallelujah
[1:17:51] and so once he became a believer yes
[1:17:52] then i can recognize he's a convert now
[1:17:56] he's a mighty man now he's mighty in the
[1:17:58] lower church how many are mighty in the
[1:18:00] strength of the lord this morning amen
[1:18:03] well not fear but we'll believe
[1:18:04] hallelujah amen believe the word of god
[1:18:07] that makes you mighty amen
[1:18:09] can you believe god's word
[1:18:15] so god's word forbid marriage to
[1:18:16] hittites but yet then bathsheba is
[1:18:18] allowed to marry uriah because he proved
[1:18:20] to be a mighty man
[1:18:22] and had great zeal for israel's god and
[1:18:24] their army
[1:18:27] they can only be possible through
[1:18:28] conversion
[1:18:32] let's see let let's hit one more and
[1:18:33] then we'll close here but i'm just
[1:18:34] buying we're having a good time in here
[1:18:36] you know i know man that's every service
[1:18:39] i just laugh about it because
[1:18:41] it's true i don't know how to happen
[1:18:44] uh go to philippians 2 verse 19.
[1:18:48] let's go to this last one
[1:18:51] i like this one because this one's kind
[1:18:52] of like me
[1:18:53] i feel like
[1:18:54] you know you try to find yourself you
[1:18:56] and i we try to find ourselves bible
[1:18:57] examples you know who most resembles our
[1:19:00] life in the bible
[1:19:02] i sure like timothy i like you
[1:19:04] so we've seen old testament examples
[1:19:06] right well here's a new testament
[1:19:07] example
[1:19:09] of a mixed
[1:19:11] marriage product
[1:19:13] or the child of a mixed marriage
[1:19:17] timothy
[1:19:18] was a product of a greek father
[1:19:21] and a jewish mother
[1:19:25] now the bible doesn't say anything about
[1:19:26] timothy's dad as far as his faith but
[1:19:28] the bible does say here we go for our
[1:19:30] mothers again our mothers and
[1:19:31] grandmothers
[1:19:32] the paul does say i see in timothy the
[1:19:36] same faith i've seen in his mother and
[1:19:38] grandmother
[1:19:39] see mothers and grandma see what faith
[1:19:41] you can put in those children
[1:19:43] i want to say nothing about his dad and
[1:19:45] here we are on father's day thank god
[1:19:46] for the mother's day thank god for the
[1:19:48] fathers but we don't see anything about
[1:19:49] timothy's dad in there where's his dad i
[1:19:51] don't know all he knows he's greek
[1:19:55] which is 916 miles away from israel by
[1:19:58] way of the bird i just looked it up on
[1:19:59] google before we got in here
[1:20:02] that's a long ways away almost a
[1:20:04] thousand miles away they were not the
[1:20:06] same nation
[1:20:07] not the same beliefs
[1:20:09] but somehow timothy's dad found favor
[1:20:11] you know with timothy's mom
[1:20:16] interracial marriage and look what the
[1:20:18] bible says
[1:20:19] uh philippians 2 19 but i trust in the
[1:20:22] lord jesus to send timotheus on you
[1:20:24] shortly that i also may be of good
[1:20:26] comfort when i know your state look at
[1:20:28] verse 20. i love this
[1:20:29] for i know no man like-minded
[1:20:33] who will naturally
[1:20:35] care
[1:20:36] for your state
[1:20:38] for all seek their own not the things
[1:20:40] that are jesus christ
[1:20:43] the prophet of god hallelujah the church
[1:20:46] age messenger brother
[1:20:48] he has all these uh three missionary
[1:20:50] trips
[1:20:52] he tells the philippians i can't find
[1:20:54] anyone who's more like-minded than me
[1:20:56] than this half-breed over here oh no i'm
[1:20:58] just using that
[1:21:02] i can't find a jew i can't find a jew
[1:21:04] with faith like as like-minded as me
[1:21:08] the closest i can find is timothy
[1:21:11] timothy has a like mind in other words
[1:21:14] his mind is just like the prophet's mind
[1:21:16] amen
[1:21:18] he thinks just like the messenger of the
[1:21:19] hour and the messenger always tell you
[1:21:22] go back to the word of god hallelujah
[1:21:25] amen
[1:21:26] amen was timothy a hybrid well it
[1:21:28] depends how you define it
[1:21:31] we would say a hybrid of dna right
[1:21:34] but really it's not a hybrid because all
[1:21:36] dna is good dna yeah
[1:21:38] right
[1:21:39] did you know that i was going to break i
[1:21:40] didn't preach this on wednesday but when
[1:21:42] that uh
[1:21:43] germ and the egg come together they take
[1:21:45] 23 chromosomes 23 chromosomes
[1:21:48] and those 46 they write a brand new
[1:21:50] genetic code that's never been written
[1:21:52] before
[1:21:54] think about that eight billion people on
[1:21:56] the earth but austin and nobody's got a
[1:21:58] genetic code like you buddy
[1:21:59] nobody's got a fingerprint like yours
[1:22:01] they said but amen nobody's got your
[1:22:03] your
[1:22:04] unique creation
[1:22:05] god made the mold and they threw the
[1:22:07] ball away praise god amen
[1:22:10] each and every person is a beautifully
[1:22:13] fearfully wonderfully made beautifully
[1:22:15] designed creature that god's making god
[1:22:18] put his stamp on that said that's mine
[1:22:20] that's another masterpiece that's
[1:22:21] another finished pride
[1:22:27] how many billions of people have been
[1:22:28] down through the age and every single
[1:22:30] one has a different fingerprint
[1:22:33] nobody has dna just like yours it's
[1:22:35] different from everybody
[1:22:36] else's all right different your special
[1:22:39] your special kind of breed
[1:22:44] i don't know each one of you now i could
[1:22:45] name each one of you right casey you're
[1:22:47] a special brain
[1:22:50] hallelujah
[1:22:51] you're a believer
[1:22:54] but your physical
[1:22:56] makeup is also a special unique blend
[1:23:02] look at verse
[1:23:03] 21 for all preachers in other words seek
[1:23:05] their own desires
[1:23:07] not the things which are jesus christ
[1:23:09] but you know the proof of timothy that
[1:23:11] as a son with the father
[1:23:14] he has served me
[1:23:16] in the gospel
[1:23:18] hallelujah
[1:23:20] did paul say well he's a half breed
[1:23:24] his dad was agreed because mom's a jew
[1:23:27] i can't really use this guy no the
[1:23:29] physical had nothing to do with it amen
[1:23:32] the
[1:23:33] it was all about the spiritual it was
[1:23:35] all about prophet will you teach me your
[1:23:37] word i want to care about
[1:23:39] uh i don't care about the word like you
[1:23:41] care about the word
[1:23:42] i will sit under you i will learn from
[1:23:44] you i will i will take everything you
[1:23:46] can teach me just teach me so i can have
[1:23:48] a heart like yours
[1:23:50] amen so i can have a spiritual character
[1:23:53] like your spiritual character
[1:23:56] that's what make timothy such a
[1:23:58] wonderful man
[1:23:59] now church was there problems because of
[1:24:00] the interracial marriage yes
[1:24:03] in acts
[1:24:04] 16 1-3
[1:24:08] the the jews wouldn't receive timothy
[1:24:10] because he was half-jew half-gentile so
[1:24:12] he got he went got circumcised in order
[1:24:15] for them to receive him
[1:24:18] so are there going to be consequences to
[1:24:20] having interracial marriage yes when you
[1:24:21] come against racist people
[1:24:24] but what's our job our job is to show
[1:24:25] them the love of god
[1:24:27] hallelujah
[1:24:29] that's our job
[1:24:30] timothy said well the way i can show
[1:24:32] these these haters towards the gentile
[1:24:34] these haters of the greek the way i can
[1:24:35] show them love is i can be circumcised
[1:24:40] and so when we receive hatred or we
[1:24:41] receive racism or we receive something
[1:24:44] we can show grace back
[1:24:46] and like think like timothy well what
[1:24:48] can i do to win their souls that's what
[1:24:50] paul said amen i become all things to
[1:24:52] all men that i white that i might win
[1:24:54] some to the faith
[1:24:56] you won't win them all you hardly win
[1:24:58] any right but these days but we can win
[1:25:00] some to the faith
[1:25:04] the bible said for they knew that his
[1:25:05] father was agreed so for some people
[1:25:07] this racial thing is a big issue but the
[1:25:10] if we're real christians with our hearts
[1:25:12] we know the truth in the inside
[1:25:15] their their ignorance or their hatred
[1:25:17] that doesn't scare us because we've got
[1:25:19] the love of jesus christ amen amen and
[1:25:21] we know perfect love casts out all fear
[1:25:23] amen
[1:25:25] and church also perfect love will hide a
[1:25:28] multitude of sins
[1:25:33] perfect love will hide
[1:25:35] a multitude of sin
[1:25:37] let's stand our feet i better stop
[1:25:38] practicing there's a lot more i got
[1:25:41] maybe
[1:25:42] a third done
