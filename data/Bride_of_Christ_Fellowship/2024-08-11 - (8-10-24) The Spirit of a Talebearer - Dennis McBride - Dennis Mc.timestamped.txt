[2:17] more Victorious walk with you father and
[2:20] you're able to give us that Lord so we
[2:22] ask in all these things by your grace in
[2:24] the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:27] Christ Let the church say amen amen amen
[2:30] let's give the Lord another hand
[2:32] [Applause]
[2:42] clap amen
[2:44] um I'm grateful for what God did for us
[2:48] on last
[2:49] night and
[2:52] uh I pray that he come again and just
[2:56] Minister
[2:58] uh and and only the way in which he can
[3:02] uh to give us something uh that will be
[3:05] of a benefit to our practical everyday
[3:10] lives right that's what's important
[3:12] things that we can actually
[3:15] apply amen so let's with that being said
[3:19] let's go to Proverbs Chapter
[3:22] 6 and verse 16 we'll start there
[3:30] thank God for the visitors God bless you
[3:33] anden I'm a I'm a visiting Minister from
[3:36] Columbia South
[3:37] Carolina amen so uh thank God for
[3:41] allowing you to be among us
[3:46] tonight okay so Proverbs Chapter 6 I
[3:49] want to start at verse
[3:51] 16 it says these six things doth the
[3:54] Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination
[3:58] unto him
[4:00] and so if God hates something that
[4:03] should be an important focal point for
[4:05] you and I
[4:07] right because God has given us
[4:09] information that'll help us to better
[4:12] navigate right it'll help us to avoid
[4:14] certain things because we don't want to
[4:17] we don't want to displease him right we
[4:20] want to be pleasing to him so when he
[4:22] gives us this information this itting to
[4:24] make us feel bad or to kind of bring an
[4:26] atmosphere of Gloom right but is
[4:30] actually to give us something that'll
[4:31] help us to defeat the
[4:33] enemy because there one is God has one
[4:36] enemy right and that's the devil and his
[4:39] that realm of demons right and their
[4:42] number one goal is to make God's
[4:45] creation hurt
[4:49] him so evil spirits they they know the
[4:53] word right and they use the
[4:58] word against God amongst his people
[5:01] that's what happened in the Garden of
[5:03] Eden God said don't eat of this tree
[5:06] right and Satan came and persuaded them
[5:10] to do the very thing that God said don't
[5:12] do because he knew that would hurt
[5:15] God so even though we're human right and
[5:19] all of us like the Bible says we all
[5:21] come short of the glory of God yes sir
[5:24] right but because God loves us so much
[5:28] it's like regardless of what we've done
[5:30] or what present fault we have in our
[5:32] lives he come to make us better he come
[5:34] to heal us hallelujah whenever God deals
[5:39] with things in our lives he's actually
[5:41] bringing about a healing and he said
[5:44] himself right he said himself he said I
[5:48] didn't come for people that that feel
[5:50] like they're already all
[5:52] right he said but I came for those that
[5:55] know they have a need for a physician
[6:03] right anybody that go to the hospital
[6:05] they don't go to the hospital because
[6:07] they are they they feel like they
[6:10] healthy you know they go to the hospital
[6:13] because it's something that's that's not
[6:15] quite right I got a pain in my ear loob
[6:18] I got a a tingling in my finger that
[6:22] ain't supposed to be there so let me go
[6:25] to the doctor and make sure that
[6:26] everything is okay or to see what's
[6:28] going on
[6:30] and that's when we that when we come to
[6:32] Christ like that Christ said that's what
[6:33] I
[6:34] welcome sir cuz he knows that we are
[6:37] imperfect people listen we're in our
[6:40] transition back to
[6:42] Perfection he's redeeming us
[6:45] Saints right and that means that we were
[6:47] already with him but through Adam and
[6:50] Eve the fall took place but now he came
[6:52] to bring his children
[6:55] back so as I go over this lesson tonight
[6:58] keep that in mind
[7:00] that God is bringing us back to our
[7:03] rightful positions as Sons and Daughters
[7:05] of God Amen all right six things he says
[7:08] these six things does God does the Lord
[7:11] hate he says yay seven are an
[7:13] Abomination unto
[7:15] him and he lifts them out he says a
[7:17] proud
[7:18] look it's number one a lying
[7:22] tongue and hands that shed innocent
[7:26] blood Verse 18 and heart that devid rth
[7:30] Wicked
[7:31] imaginations it says feet that be Swift
[7:35] in running to
[7:36] Mischief it says a false witness which
[7:39] speaketh
[7:41] lies and it says and he that sth Discord
[7:44] among
[7:47] Brethren may the Lord bless his word
[7:49] tonight Saints you may be
[7:57] seated I'm really apprecia of the lesson
[8:00] that we had on last night because as
[8:03] brother Jesse knows even though you're a
[8:06] minister many times the messages that
[8:09] are
[8:09] delivered are coming from a heart that's
[8:12] been dealt with by God in that same area
[8:15] sir so God comes to me and he helps me
[8:18] and he deals with me and it becomes so
[8:21] real until I got to tell
[8:24] somebody you know I'm like Lord I see it
[8:27] so when what we're going to talk about
[8:30] tonight regretfully I say that I've I've
[8:33] fallen victim to this at times in my
[8:37] life and the Lord had to come to me and
[8:39] deal with my heart and help me to be
[8:41] able to see no you're my son that's not
[8:44] how you're supposed to walk that's not
[8:46] how you're supposed to conduct yourself
[8:48] amen amen so this is instruction tonight
[8:52] if you haven't dealt with this yet this
[8:54] will help you to Shield yourself from
[8:57] any future attacks by evil spirits to
[9:01] try to bring you subject to it and if
[9:04] you have dealt with this already then
[9:07] this won't be anything new to you
[9:09] because I'm sure as a daughter or a son
[9:10] of God God has already dealt with you in
[9:13] the ways that we're going to talk about
[9:15] right so this is to help us to be uh
[9:19] brought breast to help us to be more
[9:22] aware okay so as an overall title now I
[9:25] want to go to another scripture here I
[9:26] just didn't want to keep you standing
[9:33] uh let's go to Proverbs Chapter
[9:38] 11 as I was reading this scripture this
[9:41] morning I really appreciated
[9:44] it appreciate all the word but it's just
[9:47] kind of was in a channel and according
[9:50] to the inspiration God was placing on my
[9:52] heart Proverbs chap 11 starting at verse
[9:55] 12 it says he that is void of wisdom
[9:59] despiseth his
[10:02] neighbor that says a lot because to be
[10:05] void of wisdom means to be void of the
[10:08] understanding of the word of God you're
[10:11] not instructed you understand what I'm
[10:14] saying you don't understand the
[10:15] importance of certain things and the
[10:17] Bible clearly says that we should love
[10:19] our neighbors as
[10:22] ourself right so God continuously
[10:25] promotes love amongst all mankind right
[10:30] but mainly amongst his family because he
[10:32] knows that those that are not ordained
[10:34] to be with him they're going to be tools
[10:37] of the enemy until the day they pass
[10:41] right but there are people in the earth
[10:43] that are actual children of God right
[10:46] and amongst his family God promotes love
[10:49] I'm a father of five and that's one
[10:51] thing that I thoroughly promote in my
[10:53] household and atmosphere of love right
[10:56] uh not not just imitating love
[10:59] right uh I I try to pay careful
[11:02] attention to my children right because
[11:04] you know sometimes they can try to act
[11:06] like everything is okay but with the
[11:09] Lord's help if you pay close attention
[11:11] sometimes you can pick up on things
[11:13] that's lying beneath the
[11:15] surface right in the Holy Spirit I have
[11:18] a parent to go in and begin to deal with
[11:21] those deeper
[11:22] issues isn't that right because we want
[11:25] a healthy family we want a healthy
[11:27] family both naturally and
[11:30] spiritually right so how much more God
[11:33] as he looks over his
[11:35] family right he wants to promote love he
[11:38] wants a family that's
[11:39] unified he wants a family that has a
[11:42] real care one for another isn't that
[11:45] right so so in our everyday lives
[11:48] understand that's God's number one goal
[11:51] and in order for that to really
[11:52] transpire or take place you must be born
[11:56] again
[12:00] that's that's that's the piece the vital
[12:03] piece that when that's present it
[12:06] enables all of this to be able to come
[12:09] to pass and be made flesh in our own
[12:12] lives so God will give us instru the the
[12:15] the a major part of it is the teaching
[12:17] of the word but you have to go beyond
[12:20] the teaching of the word right to
[12:22] entering into a real relationship with
[12:24] Jesus Christ and then once you have that
[12:27] real relationship with Jesus Christ
[12:29] he ushers you into amen the fulfilling
[12:32] of the further part of his word you'll
[12:34] be baptized in his name isn't that right
[12:38] and once you're baptized in it well for
[12:40] one he'll lead you to
[12:43] repent amen those men at Pentecost you
[12:46] know as as Peter was anointed by the
[12:48] Holy Ghost and he's ministering to
[12:50] thousands amen and he's not he's not
[12:52] counting numbers of how many people out
[12:54] there God just had a message he wanted
[12:56] to speak through his servant that had
[12:58] received his spirit and as he was
[13:01] delivering that message the Holy Ghost
[13:03] because the people were open and
[13:06] receptive Amen to whatever was being
[13:09] said God had the atmosphere set and as
[13:12] he ministered those words amen the Bible
[13:15] says it wasn't as though he was rebuking
[13:17] the people all together but the Bible
[13:19] says they were pricked in their
[13:22] hearts and when that pricking of God
[13:25] took place meaning it was God
[13:27] encouraging them to come to a a better
[13:30] life right and when that pricking was
[13:32] taking place the the the the people that
[13:35] were being pricked they said what must
[13:36] we do to be
[13:39] saved and then God gave them the answer
[13:42] because previous to that he told Peter
[13:45] I'm going to give you the keys to the
[13:49] kingdom so now it was time for those
[13:51] keys to be put into
[13:53] use what was those key Saints Peter
[13:56] responded when they cried out in despair
[13:59] he says repent every one of
[14:01] you that means to turn away from your
[14:04] wrong ways and be baptized in the name
[14:08] of the Lord Jesus Christ for the
[14:11] remission of your sins and he said ye
[14:13] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[14:18] now what is the Holy Ghost Jesus told
[14:20] the disciples he said ye shall receive
[14:23] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[14:26] you so it's actual power to begin to
[14:30] live like
[14:33] God because Jesus Christ himself he said
[14:36] I will be with you even in you so now
[14:40] when Christ comes in us and we yield to
[14:43] that Spirit now that takes a bold on the
[14:46] inside of us he's able to live his own
[14:49] life his own word through us
[14:52] now that's
[14:56] Christianity and then you just grow
[14:58] strong stronger more mature and he
[15:01] reveals more of himself to you from that
[15:05] point well I know everybody is saying
[15:08] brother McBride what's your
[15:12] title it's a strange title I've never
[15:15] dealt with it before so I need your
[15:18] prayers my title is the spirit of a tail
[15:24] Bearer The Spirit of a tail
[15:27] Bearer so uh for our visitors on last
[15:31] night uh the subject that the Lord had
[15:34] us to deal with it just dealt with how
[15:37] we allow ourselves to
[15:39] speak right because what we say with our
[15:41] mouths Jesus said it's not what goes
[15:44] inside of a man that defiles him he said
[15:47] but it's the thing that comes out of a
[15:49] man whatever you
[15:51] say right because whatever you say those
[15:53] are words and your words come from
[15:56] thoughts but where do those thoughts
[15:58] come from
[16:00] you can tell by the nature of what you
[16:02] getting ready to say or what you
[16:04] thinking about saying or what you
[16:05] already said you can pretty much tell
[16:08] where it comes from in respect to good
[16:11] or evil in source as a source because
[16:14] whenever Satan anoints
[16:17] us the things that we say aren't too
[16:20] kind they lack kindness they lack
[16:23] compassion they lack love they lack
[16:27] consideration why that's what the the
[16:29] enemy likes to swow amongst mankind he
[16:32] want he wants mankind to be full of all
[16:35] those things amen he wants us to be full
[16:37] of hurts and wounds and he wants us to
[16:40] be you know uh uh uh the one that
[16:43] actually causes hurts and
[16:46] wounds so the the the the tongue itself
[16:49] the Bible says death and life is in the
[16:51] power of the tongue every day we speak
[16:55] words who did now
[16:59] for a little baby that can't
[17:00] talk they'll be
[17:03] exempt but for the most part everybody
[17:05] in here have said words today yes and
[17:09] according to the Bible Jesus said
[17:12] himself every man and woman in the day
[17:14] of judgment you're going to have to give
[17:16] an account for Every Idle Word you
[17:20] speak so every single word that come you
[17:23] know how many words we speak in a
[17:26] day we can't even count
[17:29] right but Christ said every word that's
[17:32] spoken you're going to be held
[17:34] accountable for those
[17:37] words and the devil knows that so what
[17:41] does he want to do he wants to anoint us
[17:43] to be able to speak speak very
[17:47] Loosely in ways that we shouldn't speak
[17:51] and I I want to bring I'm trying to be
[17:53] very balanced yes in my approach to this
[17:57] because we're human
[17:59] and because we human we got real
[18:04] feelings you can be minding your
[18:07] business trying you you I'm I'mma do
[18:10] right you know you can say I'mma do
[18:12] right you know I'mma Be Kind because you
[18:14] can see a need well Lord I am a little
[18:16] rough I get too
[18:19] edgy I'm too irritable Lord and you know
[18:23] because see God is Not
[18:24] irritable God is Not edgy God is Not
[18:28] frustra
[18:29] and because he's supposed to be our
[18:31] father he don't want our he don't want
[18:33] his children to be characterized by that
[18:36] also right but the devil he don't want
[18:40] you to live in a peaceful manner so he's
[18:43] always devising he studies
[18:46] us evil spirits study us and they'll
[18:49] cause somebody to come from
[18:52] somewhere to provoke you to try to pull
[18:56] you out of the right frame of mind into
[18:59] a wrong frame of mind so that overall
[19:03] you can hurt
[19:06] God but I want to say this and I know we
[19:08] all appreciate it aren't you
[19:10] appreciative of the love of
[19:12] God
[19:14] Amen the Bible says when we were yet
[19:18] sinners didn't even consider God wasn't
[19:21] thinking about God living living a life
[19:24] that totally was against him allog
[19:26] together the Bible says he commended his
[19:28] love toward us while we were in that
[19:31] state in sending Jesus
[19:33] Christ to die for the
[19:37] ungodly cuz even though that was our
[19:39] then State he knew that we would come
[19:41] out of that into a better
[19:43] state so he was placing he he was
[19:46] initiating his Plan of Redemption which
[19:49] started with a cleansing
[19:51] blood I want you to understand if you
[19:54] don't already understand you're forgiven
[19:57] of every sin you you ever
[20:04] [Applause]
[20:06] committed when Jesus Christ died on
[20:08] Calvary I want you to listen it's sins
[20:10] you ain't even committed yet we in 2024
[20:14] we ain't hit 2025 yet it's things that
[20:17] God know that you going to do in 2025
[20:20] and he already took care of it at
[20:23] [Applause]
[20:26] Calvary it was an alls sufficient
[20:30] sacrifice can we say praise the Lord to
[20:32] that Saints amen that's that's Weaponry
[20:36] that that that's an M16 against the
[20:38] enemy that's a
[20:40] nuclear that's a nuclear bomb against
[20:42] the the forces of Darkness they don't
[20:44] want that to be understood cuz that
[20:47] bring listen that'll bring about a power
[20:49] and a
[20:54] change that's something man
[20:59] okay let's let's kind of get I'm not
[21:00] going to be long tonight the Lord was
[21:03] dealing with my heart all day on this I
[21:06] did much
[21:07] studying but I ain't gonna try to lay
[21:10] all this on you guys tonight I know we
[21:14] got service tomorrow morning and it's a
[21:16] lot of things got to be done tonight
[21:17] once you get home so we'll just hit some
[21:19] of the highlights let's go here if we
[21:21] will to Numbers chapter 16
[21:30] amen so again keep in mind this is the
[21:33] help to protect us from falling subject
[21:37] so God has given us the information we
[21:39] need and by his Spirit he'll bring it to
[21:42] our I'll say our rembrance right and as
[21:46] and as we see this Spirit approaching I
[21:49] pray God help you to identify it and
[21:51] withstand
[21:53] it number 16 starting at verse one it
[21:56] says now Kora the son of ishar the son
[22:00] of coath the son of Levi and Dayan and
[22:04] Abram the sons of eliab and an uh the
[22:07] son of pth Sons of Ruben took
[22:12] men and they rose up before Moses with
[22:15] certain of the children of Israel
[22:18] 250 princes of the of the assembly
[22:21] famous in the congregation men of
[22:24] renowned and they gathered themselves
[22:26] together against Moses and against Aaron
[22:30] so there's detail that obvious obviously
[22:34] is there but it's not written right so
[22:39] Kora was a leader in
[22:42] this movement I would call
[22:46] it so just think about this Saints cor
[22:50] was born a
[22:52] baby right born and sin all that stuff
[22:56] right but he grew up he he came Through
[22:58] the Ages and whatever phases of his life
[23:00] or whatever so now he's at the age that
[23:02] he is now and God by his grace he helped
[23:06] these people to be
[23:08] delivered
[23:09] from Egypt am right so Coral was there
[23:14] in
[23:15] Egypt right he he he he saw the
[23:18] lifestyle they became subject to he saw
[23:21] the change and God allowing a pharaoh to
[23:24] rise up that didn't know
[23:26] Joseph isn't that right he he he saw
[23:29] that whole shift amen when they when now
[23:32] now now they begin to be despised and
[23:33] look down upon and all the only reason
[23:36] why that happened is that God was
[23:38] getting them ready to be
[23:40] delivered you know God will allow things
[23:43] to happen in your life to cause you to
[23:45] be very
[23:48] unsettled many times when people really
[23:51] come to Christ to become more serious or
[23:53] to give their lives to Christ it's
[23:55] because trouble done drove them in that
[23:57] direction
[23:59] in whatever way form of fashion that
[24:01] might actually come in that's what
[24:04] happens right in most cases
[24:07] so God was getting them ready to be
[24:09] delivered so that they can get
[24:11] uncomfortable in Egypt so they can cry
[24:13] out for a deliverer so God can send
[24:15] Moses so now cor was there and Dayan was
[24:18] there through this whole situation they
[24:21] saw God send Moses in they saw God use
[24:24] Moses right they saw things that was
[24:27] just
[24:29] Beyond human ability they they saw God
[24:32] use Moses Amen to bring about such
[24:34] miracles to take down a
[24:37] whole mighty nation you understand they
[24:42] they they they witness a god parting a
[24:44] red sea and and saw the Egyptians being
[24:47] driven into the Red Sea and saw God
[24:50] swallow them up in the Red Sea to they
[24:53] wasn't no
[24:54] more they came out on the other side
[24:57] rejoicing because God wrought such a
[24:59] great deliverance from the
[25:03] Egyptians amen but now they're coming on
[25:05] out and they're on their
[25:08] way and
[25:11] unfortunately they had a part to
[25:14] fulfill that wasn't a good
[25:17] part god already knew this wasn't a
[25:19] surprise to
[25:21] God people that are not going to follow
[25:24] God God already knows
[25:27] that but his concern are those that he
[25:30] knows are going to follow him everybody
[25:32] has a role to to play but his focus is
[25:35] on his family so Kora now now they're
[25:39] pass the Egyptian situation and whatever
[25:41] and they're moving on with life but now
[25:43] all of a sudden somehow
[25:46] someway a spirit of
[25:50] jealousy begins to get a hold of cor's
[25:54] mind it's just a whisper
[26:02] any sin that you and I have ever
[26:05] committed it started off as a
[26:10] whisper Spirits just come and suggesting
[26:14] things and where we make our mistakes is
[26:17] where Eve made her mistake the devil
[26:20] began to whisper through the serpent and
[26:23] what did Eve do she stopped for a moment
[26:26] to pay attention
[26:29] that's why the Bible says that when
[26:31] thoughts come to us that try that that
[26:33] are against Christ in the way that we
[26:35] know Christ wants us to live the Bible
[26:37] says we're to cast those thoughts
[26:41] away you might say well brother I can't
[26:43] do that well if you love to live and a
[26:47] thought comes to you drive your car to
[26:50] that bridge and then get out your car
[26:53] and jump off the
[26:56] bridge if you love to live
[26:59] now you you going to be like hold on
[27:01] what you'll go home and say honey you
[27:03] know what something crazy happened to me
[27:06] something tried to tell me to jump off
[27:08] of a bridge is't that
[27:10] crazy right but there are
[27:14] things there are ways that the enemy can
[27:17] approach us because he studies us he'll
[27:20] try to approach us in a way that's
[27:24] irresistible something you can easily
[27:27] cuz he don't watch you and he sees what
[27:30] you have a tendency to gravitate
[27:34] toward you know he knew our previous
[27:37] life he knew our strongholds he's a
[27:41] spirit he ain't got a memory like a
[27:43] human he he was there all the way back
[27:47] in the Garden of Eden you know so he
[27:49] studied mankind he's a great
[27:52] psychologist he understands the human
[27:55] makeup he understands the human mind you
[27:58] know he knows how to
[28:00] manipulate you see it all through the
[28:02] Bible right so now he's coming to Kora
[28:06] and he's planting this seed of a thought
[28:10] to make him feel as though you know he
[28:11] wanted to be somebody
[28:14] obviously you know even though he came
[28:16] and worded it the way that he worded it
[28:18] obviously he wanted to have more of a
[28:20] recognition amongst the people so the
[28:23] devil begins to talk to him in this
[28:24] particular way and when he does it's
[28:27] able now now a spirit of jealousy is
[28:29] able to come upon Kora and that became
[28:33] his his inspiration that became what
[28:36] motivated
[28:38] him and now he went on and he went to go
[28:40] and try to find other people that he can
[28:43] kind of begin to share these things with
[28:46] that that that that'll that that'll be
[28:48] able to join in in that
[28:52] likeminded and he might have gone to
[28:54] Dayan and said you know I I just got I
[28:56] got something that's on my heart
[28:59] you know it's kind of been bothering me
[29:00] a little bit you know I want to share it
[29:02] with you you know I don't know I could
[29:03] be
[29:04] wrong he didn't feel like he was wrong
[29:07] but that's the approach see a a devil
[29:09] has to come in a very deceptive way as
[29:13] though he's not meaning no harm but he's
[29:15] meaning full
[29:18] harm I don't mean no harm you know I
[29:21] might be wrong you know
[29:23] but doesn't it seem like
[29:25] Moses kind of like I don't know like he
[29:30] think he's somebody like he he's trying
[29:33] to make himself a prince over us or he's
[29:35] trying to be a leader to us like what
[29:37] what do you think he's trying to do
[29:39] because I just been watching him lately
[29:41] and something just ain't sitting right
[29:42] in my spirit about
[29:44] Moses trying to sound
[29:49] spiritual but it was a devil sir listen
[29:54] that cor himself he didn't even know
[29:56] that he was being dealt with by
[29:59] devil isn't that how it
[30:02] is if we could see the
[30:05] spirits because every Spirit has a
[30:08] form but sometimes God has Grace on you
[30:11] and I he don't let us be able to see
[30:13] those Spirits because it'll it might
[30:15] probably make you have a make you have a
[30:17] heart attack or something but Spirits
[30:20] are real like persons like it's it's a
[30:24] real being they're in this room right
[30:27] now but angels are in here too the
[30:31] spirit of God is here you understand
[30:32] what I'm saying so that presents a
[30:34] battle to the human mind cuz even as I'm
[30:37] ministering there'll be spirits that
[30:39] will come and try to attract your
[30:41] attention off somewhere because it wants
[30:43] to render the word
[30:46] ineffective it don't want you to catch
[30:48] on to the lesson that you might be able
[30:50] to use what's being taught to come
[30:53] against that enemy and gain the victory
[30:59] praise the
[31:01] Lord so now he's got
[31:03] Dayan and daythan is like you know what
[31:05] I can see that I ain't never saw it like
[31:09] see now when you open up yourself to
[31:11] gossip the spirit that's bringing it now
[31:14] it transfers to
[31:17] you we understand that but they say
[31:21] birds of a FEA do
[31:26] what h
[31:29] so then that just began to build now
[31:31] it's two so then now because they have a
[31:33] good standing amongst the people now the
[31:36] see the enemy he Cho the enemy uses
[31:39] people that are in influential
[31:44] positions cuz he knows that people that
[31:46] look up to
[31:48] them man major all of them may not
[31:52] follow their leading but majority of the
[31:54] people they'll just blindly follow along
[31:57] and not question nothing but because
[31:59] they look up to this person they just
[32:01] value their opinions and their views yes
[32:04] sir glory to God we in the presidential
[32:08] races right
[32:11] now let let
[32:16] me bear with me for a moment yes
[32:21] sir I didn't even finish reading that
[32:24] particular scripture did I I didn't
[32:26] partially read two
[32:29] scriptures oh man um there's this
[32:33] particular scripture here it is just
[32:34] bear with me for a moment we want to
[32:36] come back and touch on all these areas
[32:39] by the grace of God to try to bring it
[32:41] together you know for
[32:43] you Proverbs 16 verse 27 because I just
[32:46] mentioned the presidential elections and
[32:49] it's just how many understand it's an
[32:51] ungodly
[32:54] Spirit you can tell by the
[32:56] characteristics of it look at what they
[32:58] do in order to be successful over a
[33:01] candidate you got to go back and you're
[33:03] going to and and they're they're
[33:04] fulfilling Proverbs 16 verse 27 it says
[33:08] an ungodly man do what dith up
[33:13] evil that's their whole objective oh
[33:16] I'mma have a debate again so and so he
[33:18] get their team okay now you go out and
[33:21] you search everything you pull me up all
[33:24] they don't say pull me up all the
[33:25] achievements
[33:28] all the achievements they had you make
[33:30] sure you get all them to me because I
[33:31] want to bring all their achievements out
[33:33] in the debate no they want to search and
[33:36] scan and comb over the candidates that
[33:39] they're going against lives to do what
[33:41] pull up all the bad things so that they
[33:45] can bring them before the public and
[33:47] their and their number one objective is
[33:49] to make that person look way worse than
[33:52] what they are you understand what I'm
[33:54] saying that's a spirit of a tail Bearer
[33:58] and God say I hate
[34:00] that glory to God so God listen God is
[34:05] nowhere in any form of fashion he's not
[34:08] he's not in politics at
[34:11] all now God controls who gets in into
[34:15] position because there are certain
[34:17] things that has to has to be fulfilled
[34:19] and that person was made to be the one
[34:21] to step forward to fulfill that but God
[34:24] is not within the inner workings of
[34:26] politics God ain't a Democrat a liberal
[34:29] or a Republican or whatever else they
[34:31] got out there he's God you understand
[34:35] praise
[34:37] God okay so it says an ungodly man dith
[34:40] up evil and in his lips there is listen
[34:44] as a burning fire we went over that last
[34:46] night right it says that tongue is set
[34:49] on fire of Hell meaning the spirit
[34:52] that's behind the thoughts that's
[34:53] bringing the words by the nature of it
[34:57] it's bringing a slander it's trying to
[34:59] hurt somebody it's trying to make
[35:01] somebody look bad that's the spirit of a
[35:03] tail Bearer and God say I hate
[35:06] that so right now all of these elections
[35:09] and them going about doing things in
[35:11] that manner God is displeased with the
[35:13] whole thing that's
[35:17] right and they're ignorant of
[35:20] it they still profess Christian faith
[35:23] and I won't take that away from nobody
[35:26] but they're ignorant to the enemy's
[35:32] devices so now cor begins to go out with
[35:35] Dayan and they begin to move about the
[35:37] crowd move about Israel and they begin
[35:41] to capture any and everybody that they
[35:43] can persuade to fall subject or to enter
[35:48] into this Same
[35:51] Spirit and they gained a lot of success
[35:53] right
[35:54] Saints and notice who they went for
[35:57] notice how how it says this um in
[36:01] verse two it says uh and they rose up
[36:06] before Moses it says with certain of the
[36:08] children with it says
[36:10] certain it was strategic with certain of
[36:14] the children of Israel it says
[36:16] 250 princes of the how many who were
[36:20] princes they were rulers in the
[36:22] assembly it says
[36:25] famous in the congregation because of we
[36:27] have these people stepping forth with us
[36:30] it gives us more weight it gives us more
[36:32] it gives us a power it increases our
[36:35] power of
[36:37] persuasion amongst the people so now
[36:40] that one spirit that started off with
[36:42] cor and it begin to move and multiply
[36:44] you know it begin to take up that whole
[36:46] group that whole group was under that
[36:48] same
[36:49] anointing amen and now they're coming
[36:51] against God's chosen Prophet they would
[36:55] deceive Saints you know the was getting
[36:58] them in
[36:59] trouble the devil was setting them up
[37:02] for a destruction and they didn't even
[37:04] realize it that's what this this Spirit
[37:07] of tail bearing amen it's evident right
[37:10] here and this is what it does it's
[37:12] trying to lead people to a destruction
[37:14] CU for one it knows that God hates it
[37:17] and it wants God it wants God to be hurt
[37:21] by his children being made to be
[37:24] trophies of evil spirits that had a
[37:27] riddle in their
[37:29] lives with improper
[37:37] Behavior but I thank God for his
[37:41] grace CU even though like I said I know
[37:44] I've been a victim of it cuz the way
[37:46] that Spirits play they play and and this
[37:49] is this situation but Spirits are ride
[37:51] in on you when when they see you are the
[37:54] most vulnerable when you've been hurt
[37:58] when you've been done
[37:59] wrong and now it seems
[38:02] merited where they did me wrong so they
[38:06] deserve to be talked
[38:08] about uh in whatever way I'm feeling
[38:11] they deserve to be talked about we'll
[38:14] get into some things here I'm running
[38:16] out of time okay so now they go and they
[38:18] present themselves to Moses and they say
[38:20] look you take too much upon yourself
[38:23] Moses say you make us feel like you
[38:26] think you're the only one that God deal
[38:28] with God talked to all of us Moses never
[38:32] said that what they were accusing him of
[38:35] it was that evil spirit that had come
[38:37] upon them to bring about listen that was
[38:39] just an
[38:40] imagination that wasn't even reality
[38:44] Moses wasn't fulfilling none of that it
[38:46] wasn't even a real case but Spirits
[38:49] build cases in people's
[38:53] minds you know how many Lord have mer
[38:56] you know how many people are in prison
[38:58] wrongfully right
[39:01] now when I'm at my job there's certain
[39:04] things that happen and I don't know how
[39:06] they do it but somehow they link my name
[39:09] into certain things and I did certain
[39:11] things and I said you know what I hope
[39:13] you never become a
[39:16] juror because you just as wrong as two
[39:20] left shoes and I hope nobody has to
[39:23] depend on your decision in their court
[39:26] case
[39:27] but isn't that how it is we're all
[39:29] subject how many times have we looked at
[39:31] things and seem like we can pin it down
[39:34] thoroughly amen and and and and and just
[39:37] to come to find that it you absolutely
[39:40] are
[39:42] wrong you mean I'm looking right at it
[39:45] you were doing this and you said this
[39:46] and you mean to tell me that wasn't the
[39:48] case at
[39:49] all that happened to me that happened to
[39:52] me with my wife years ago a spirit was
[39:57] coming to her to try to make her accept
[40:00] a particular line of thought concerning
[40:02] me and that same I didn't even know that
[40:05] and that same Spirit was working with me
[40:07] in the same way in the same line of
[40:09] thought concerning her it was trying to
[40:12] pit us against one
[40:14] another she was she came out the better
[40:17] person cuz I came home and I thought
[40:19] about that thing while I was at where I
[40:21] said man this got to be the case you
[40:23] know and she was just as good as guilty
[40:26] in my mind I said you know I'm I'm going
[40:27] to go home we going to have a talk about
[40:30] this and I got home and I got my case
[40:33] all built up in my mind and I was like
[40:35] yeah man we going to deal with this cuz
[40:37] you got to see what you were wrong at
[40:39] and I told her what was on my mind and
[40:41] she looked at me she said McBride CU I
[40:45] was I was in the Marine court she called
[40:46] me by my last she said
[40:48] McBride you're not going to believe that
[40:51] she said but that same thought came to
[40:53] me concerning you today and the Lord
[40:55] showed it to me he helped me to
[40:57] understand
[40:59] it I said
[41:04] what I said you telling me I was just
[41:07] used by a
[41:09] devil and that bother that bothered me
[41:13] you mean to tell me this whole thing was
[41:16] wrong and that from that point it it it
[41:19] it it it it it provoke me to be more
[41:24] careful last night we went over that
[41:26] scripture it says slow to speak slow to
[41:29] ride quick to listen don't be so quick
[41:32] on the
[41:33] trigger consider your own thoughts go
[41:36] and take time to pray about it to see if
[41:38] the Lord will give you Clarity before
[41:40] you go and rush into a situation and
[41:43] bring a false accusation Dayan and they
[41:46] should have
[41:47] prayed they should have prayed because
[41:49] because they didn't pray and they
[41:51] allowed the devil to get a hold of them
[41:53] to come against God servant like that
[41:56] you know what God did God God allowed
[41:58] the whole earth to be opened
[42:01] up and Dayan and K and their
[42:05] families innocent people they
[42:10] died because of these men being moved by
[42:13] an evil spirit to come against God in a
[42:17] false accusation because that was God's
[42:19] servant and he placed him
[42:25] there that SP Spirit of tail bearing is
[42:28] very
[42:29] dangerous sir and we want to be able to
[42:32] be free from it at all cost that means
[42:35] you're going to have to fight because
[42:36] like I said we're human we get hurt and
[42:38] we go through things or whatever and it
[42:40] gets so strong in your heart you just
[42:42] want to tell somebody
[42:44] about but if you ain't in the right
[42:47] Spirit when you tell it you're going to
[42:49] tell it in a victim
[42:52] standpoint
[42:55] H is that
[42:57] right when you feel when you feeling a
[43:00] certain way you just you feel like you
[43:01] the V I'm the victim and you know those
[43:05] feelings and listen know that that devil
[43:06] knows it sees you it it wants to
[43:09] capitalize on your
[43:12] situation it want to int it wants to
[43:14] intensify your hurt it wants to
[43:16] intensify your pain it wants you it want
[43:19] to get your feeling so worked
[43:21] up until now you let now you can easily
[43:25] open yourself up
[43:28] you say you know what I got to talk to
[43:32] somebody that's the first
[43:35] mistake if you if you feel you can't
[43:37] talk to the person the next person that
[43:40] should be on your list to talk to is
[43:48] God because when you talk to God about
[43:51] it he's able to give you Clarity he's
[43:54] able to ease you in your spirit so
[43:56] you're not going into a person to create
[43:58] a bigger
[44:03] issue I'mma read to you this I found
[44:05] this I'm going have to close his Saints
[44:08] I ain't nowhere near nowhere near but
[44:11] there's a few points I want to make here
[44:14] I found this and I just the way that it
[44:16] was worded I just was like man that's
[44:18] good it's just randomly off of the
[44:20] internet right it's talking about
[44:22] backbiting gossiping and tail
[44:25] bearing and just so you know just to
[44:28] kind of help you to follow me a little
[44:29] more closely the word tail Bearer it
[44:32] means a person who maliciously gossips
[44:34] or reveal
[44:37] Secrets the word maliciously maliciously
[44:40] mean in a manner characterized by malice
[44:43] or ill will with the intent to do
[44:47] harm if you're
[44:49] hurt and somebody hurt
[44:52] you it shouldn't be that way but because
[44:55] we're human if the Lord don't help you
[44:57] kind of want them to feel a little
[44:59] something
[45:00] too know like no you need to feel
[45:05] something because you did you hurt me or
[45:07] whatever you know and that's how that
[45:09] Spirit slips in it takes advantage of
[45:12] people in those situations so all right
[45:15] so that's that's what maliciously stands
[45:18] for a means and then malice you know
[45:20] that's the root word is the intention or
[45:23] desire to do evil but the person
[45:25] themselves aren't really design to do
[45:28] evil they just don't know that they're
[45:30] being used and it's the enemy that's
[45:32] putting their minds in that in that
[45:34] cycle of
[45:35] thought so this particular person was
[45:38] kind of dealing with backbiting
[45:40] gossiping and tail bearing and notice
[45:41] how they word this it says back Bing go
[45:44] backbiting gossiping and tail bearing
[45:46] are very deadly and very dangerous
[45:49] besetting sins it just caus multiple
[45:52] people to die as we read in the
[45:54] scripture so it's very dangerous right
[45:57] it says um these are sins that we use
[46:01] our tongue to commit it says these
[46:04] besetting sins recruit others to fulfill
[46:06] its Endeavor uh while destroying a
[46:09] person a community Nations and even
[46:12] countries didn't we just witnessed that
[46:13] in the Scripture it says listen now it
[46:17] destroys
[46:23] families because nobody in here knows my
[46:25] natural family like like my aunts and
[46:28] uncles and
[46:30] whatever I have a particular aunt and I
[46:32] love
[46:33] her but all my life my memory of her
[46:36] ever since I was a child is that she was
[46:39] the one
[46:40] that took advantage or
[46:43] that she was the one that gossiped about
[46:47] all the weaknesses of those that had
[46:50] problems she would gossip to me about my
[46:53] own
[46:55] mother you know
[46:57] I love her and in my own way since the
[47:00] Lord start dealing with my heart I try
[47:02] to encourage her in the word you know in
[47:06] a way to where she don't realize I'm
[47:08] dealing with that but to try to help her
[47:09] to see herself and become more aware of
[47:12] what God's word says in that
[47:15] area we don't want to be that
[47:19] individual that's used to tear other
[47:21] people down in the minds of someone
[47:24] else cuz God hates that it says destroys
[47:27] families it destroys churches
[47:29] friendships businesses careers
[47:33] Etc it says these besetting these
[47:36] besetting sins begin like the waterfall
[47:39] above and pour and pour until it spreads
[47:43] all around far and wide soaking and
[47:46] affecting everything as the waterfall
[47:48] does below below where it's falling from
[47:52] all right I'm going end with this right
[47:54] here because it's just past 8:00 and I
[47:56] know we got service tomorrow and I want
[47:58] to just be respectful in that way and I
[48:01] I wouldn't be saying that if I wasn't
[48:03] mindful of it so I'm not so much so
[48:05] catering but just in my heart I'm
[48:07] feeling when I'm feeling to draw it to a
[48:09] close and I'mma end on this I got so
[48:12] much more I won't be able to get to it
[48:14] but uh you can just do a Bible search in
[48:17] the Bible on tail Bearer yes tail Bearer
[48:22] uh I I was going to deal with backbiting
[48:24] but I'm not going to be able to get into
[48:26] that
[48:27] um so much so but uh you know they kind
[48:31] of go hand in hand right very similar um
[48:35] but I want to leave you with this right
[48:36] here this is the Song of Solomon uh
[48:40] chapter 2 starting at verse
[48:43] 15 it says um take us the
[48:49] foxes the little foxes yes and it says
[48:54] that spoil the vines
[48:57] for our Vines have tender
[49:01] grapes and I found this and I wanted to
[49:04] share this with you because I
[49:05] appreciated how it was worded it says
[49:08] this phrase little foxes spoil the vine
[49:11] is a metaphor from the Bible Song of
[49:13] Solomon it calls out the chapter and
[49:15] verse that describes how small seemingly
[49:19] harmless things can cause significant
[49:23] problems in the verse the speaker says
[49:26] catch for us the foxes the little foxes
[49:29] that ruin The Vineyards are Vineyards
[49:32] that are in bloom the foxes symbolize
[49:35] potential issues that could harm a
[49:38] relationship such as gossip selfish
[49:42] thoughts or Li the speaker instructs
[49:45] people to take preventative measures yes
[49:48] amen and that's the purpose for us
[49:50] bringing this message tonight Saints so
[49:52] that we can begin to take preventative
[49:54] measures right to protect their
[49:58] love amen from anything that could harm
[50:01] it the fox is a little because it's
[50:04] often the small things that are
[50:06] overlooked that cause the most
[50:12] damage can we say praise the lord lord
[50:16] so may the Lord help us to keep the
[50:20] little foxes of tail
[50:22] bearing away from our Vineyards of love
[50:27] because they seek to destroy it to ruin
[50:29] it it don't want to have the it don't
[50:31] want the fruits to come
[50:34] forth amen the fruits of the
[50:39] spirit when when when these things are
[50:42] present within lives within churches or
[50:44] what have you
[50:46] right in this case I'mma I'm I'mma
[50:48] emphasize
[50:54] churches all right I'm I'mma leave you
[50:57] with this like this will be the real
[50:58] thing I leave you with all right this is
[51:02] when the message of Christ is the
[51:03] mystery of God reveal he says love one
[51:05] another above
[51:06] everything love one another no matter
[51:09] what the devil tries to say he says now
[51:11] you're all one great big sweet group now
[51:14] but remember my warning Satan won't let
[51:17] that stay that way no sir he'll shoot
[51:19] everything if he has to bring somebody
[51:22] in and make them a Target he'll bring
[51:24] some critic or unbeliever in and sit
[51:27] them down and cause him to fellowship
[51:29] with you under the quietness and things
[51:31] and then he'll shoot that guy with some
[51:33] kind of a poison stuff and he'll start
[51:35] through the church with it with it he
[51:37] says don't you take sides with it don't
[51:39] you have nothing to do with it anything
[51:42] he says you stay right loving and sweet
[51:44] and kind to one
[51:46] another that's the father dealing with
[51:49] his family right God is saying okay you
[51:51] got a difference or whatever hey just
[51:53] pray for one another forgive one another
[51:56] that's why he said in the Bible when you
[51:57] stand praying how many of us pray in
[52:01] here how many pray now the Bible says
[52:04] when you stand praying in order for your
[52:07] prayers to even be heard by God he said
[52:11] when you stand praying he said
[52:15] forgive so that you can be forgiven
[52:20] also we're not even though somebody do
[52:23] us wrong and hurt us we're not justified
[52:26] in in and and holding that against that
[52:28] person because how many times do we
[52:30] transgress against God in a
[52:33] day glory and what's the comfort that we
[52:36] have that we can go to a god that so
[52:39] love us that even though we made a
[52:41] mistake and we've heard him oh man we've
[52:44] heard him his love is so great and so
[52:46] rich until he'll forgive me for what
[52:50] I've done wrong and allow me to go as
[52:53] though I never did it in the first place
[52:55] you understand that
[52:57] it's a sea of
[52:59] forgetfulness God will never bring that
[53:01] back up to you again so if he does that
[53:04] for us when you stand praying he said
[53:08] forgive so that you'll be forgiven
[53:11] also
[53:13] amen amen he goes on and he says the
[53:16] enemy will come and he and when he does
[53:19] just cling that much closer together and
[53:21] the one that the devil is using for an
[53:23] enemy will either get out or come in and
[53:26] be one of you if somebody comes against
[53:28] you with an accusation or is a tail
[53:30] Bearer against you God wants you to pray
[53:33] for that
[53:35] person now that takes a power cuz if
[53:38] that person is slandering you and and
[53:40] spreading about false rumors or whatever
[53:43] you want to set them straight I want you
[53:45] to understand you ain't gonna do me like
[53:47] that right and God comes and say put
[53:51] your finger down put your arm down calm
[53:54] your tongue down
[53:56] huh this my
[53:59] house you my daughter my son and I ain't

[54:34] natural father now I can pray for my
[54:36] children and the Lord by his grace

[54:50] whole you talking about a
[54:52] satisfaction you ain't experienc
[54:55] satisfaction until you've entered into

[55:01] many people are going about trying to
[55:02] satisfy things in their heart that
[55:04] they're longing for they feel like they

[55:08] woman at the well and I'm stopping here
