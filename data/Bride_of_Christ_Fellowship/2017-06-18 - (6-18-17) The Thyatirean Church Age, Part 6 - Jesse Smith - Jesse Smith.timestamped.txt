[37:13] Oh gracious the Lord Jesus is mystical
[37:48] Bibles go to listen to verse 22 I think
[37:53] I have two more services on by human
[37:55] church age today will be parks it or
[37:57] really Wednesday March 7 or may people
[37:59] feel that to do another thought but
[38:02] forget part 6 here the school in
[38:04] relation to 22 I do want to wish all the
[38:07] fathers happy Father's Day
[38:09] praise the Lord he kind of forgot about
[38:11] that but happy Father's Day 12 apotres
[38:16] increases our relation to 22 last week I
[38:23] got to preach about mothers and fathers
[38:24] so that was kind of our My Father's Day
[38:26] message I just use that that Sunday with
[38:32] that strong mail last week strong father
[38:36] strong leader of the home and also a
[38:38] submissive wife what did that last
[38:40] weekend of course the false churches
[38:41] have the dominating female spirit you
[38:44] don't have that here we have the Holy
[38:45] Spirit and that's what's dominating us
[38:48] is a nice fear he strings us out he
[38:51] empowers us he delivers us he heals us
[38:54] he gives us grace to stand revelation
[38:58] 2:20 - we'll probably get down to verse
[39:03] 26 but we'll just going to read verse 22
[39:06] start there I think it will just be best
[39:08] to save time we have the fellowship
[39:10] today I just want to conserve time
[39:13] revelation 2:20 - let's read just that
[39:15] verse together ready one two three
[39:17] behold I will cast her into a bed and
[39:21] that neck commit adultery with her
[39:23] to Great Tribulation except they repent
[39:26] of their deeds such as Howard prayer if
[39:28] you eat on your hearts they can go to
[39:30] God that's just right Heavenly Father we
[39:33] love how great you are Lord oh we look
[39:36] in to your holiness and we worship you
[39:38] dear God you are the master of the wind
[39:40] Lord all these songs here on our hearts
[39:42] and minds we know the master of the wind
[39:45] we're grateful to know you Lord the fact
[39:49] that you humbled yourself so that we
[39:51] could know you you're how great you are
[39:53] Lord that's what makes you so great is
[39:56] your humility lord help us to be humble
[39:58] this morning Lord God help us to try to
[40:01] let your greatness live through us by
[40:03] being humble nor in looking to the Word
[40:06] of God or Direction father we just give
[40:09] you honor and praise and need every need
[40:10] we again ask you touch the Walker
[40:12] children thank you for the faithful
[40:14] prayers Lord Jesus and any other need
[40:16] were not aware of Laura for you minutes
[40:17] for those needs of us to be set if the
[40:20] Holy Spirit this morning that's the
[40:21] father is Lord they can occur though the
[40:23] hours they've invested in the lives of
[40:25] their children Lord and then their wives
[40:27] their families Lord how they labor less
[40:30] them or let them be more sensitive to
[40:32] the Holy Spirit that need Lord at each
[40:34] of the leaders of the holman mark as the
[40:37] leader of the church let me be sensitive
[40:39] more sensitive to the leadership of the
[40:40] Holy Spirit let me hear your still small
[40:43] voice Lord God we love you Lord minister
[40:46] now to us by thy spirit as only you can
[40:48] do in Jesus Christ's name and I bet
[40:52] you'd be in
[41:09] more willing we'll look at part six here
[41:12] today that's grace maokai whenever
[41:18] you're anybody we can switch you over
[41:19] here got some quotes you know to go
[41:25] through hope you're enjoying it if you
[41:29] are enjoying it it means you would have
[41:31] enjoyed it in nineteen sixty when it was
[41:33] preached praise God and I'm not enjoying
[41:35] it you probably not enjoyed it at night
[41:36] to the 60 minute was preached so we
[41:39] really enjoy brother branham said I
[41:41] could have preached fifty sermons on
[41:42] each church age and he just hit the
[41:45] highlights one night so that means
[41:48] there's probably forty nine left and I
[41:49] preached seven or eight of those so you
[41:51] know without more than that but God
[41:52] bless you let's look at this church age
[41:55] which is still looking at the tire tear
[41:57] in church age by the grace of Lord
[41:59] mesengeros Columba and this is a number
[42:03] though this is the the time that comma
[42:05] live a member if you get your horse
[42:07] riders from the seven seals in here the
[42:09] anointings of the the Antichrist yet the
[42:12] white horse rider black horse rider
[42:15] wrote about right here I'm sorry red
[42:18] horse rider wrote about right here to
[42:20] right here and then from here on to a
[42:23] little bit right there is where we're at
[42:25] right now but the Dark Horse or the
[42:27] black horse rider because it started off
[42:29] with white deception of false teaching
[42:31] and then from ready to killing his
[42:33] church and state are united and then it
[42:35] went to black which is a Dark Age the
[42:38] darkest age of persecution and capturing
[42:41] the wealth from the world as he had his
[42:43] pair of balances in his hands and we saw
[42:45] Wednesday those those beasts and those
[42:47] horse riders aren't just interpretations
[42:49] they're thus saith the Lord
[42:51] so we're very thankful to have those by
[42:53] the grace of God now remember the
[42:55] importance of this series on the church
[42:57] age please don't forget this the book of
[43:00] Revelation shows how the Antichrist fear
[43:02] would come into the church and defile it
[43:04] making a lukewarm formal powerless so
[43:08] Satan is not trying to get you to be
[43:10] cold
[43:10] singing just trying to get you to be
[43:12] lukewarm right you say amen to that
[43:14] that's always trying to do is just try
[43:16] to make the church the church church
[43:17] lukewarm right with your salt Wednesday
[43:20] every denomination milligrams that
[43:23] we'll take the mark of the beast the
[43:25] save the Lord so on Wednesday night I
[43:27] reached out to somebody denomination
[43:28] never heard back from them that's okay
[43:30] it's on my heart to do it and I reached
[43:32] out and felt led of the Holy Spirit to
[43:33] do that give them a warning but they
[43:36] never got back to me that's five because
[43:38] it's off my heart phrase when I would I
[43:39] gave as a person i ministered to many
[43:41] many times I just got a burden to get
[43:44] expressed that I said are you going to
[43:46] come out of your denomination now are
[43:48] there any signs of revival and so forth
[43:51] yeah thus saith the Lord but no reply
[43:55] that's all right perhaps they're busy I
[43:56] don't know but I know what I could do
[43:58] I've reached out and that's what I'm
[44:00] called to do so we got to keep from
[44:03] becoming lukewarm the book of Revelation
[44:07] exposes Satan unveiling his works his
[44:09] attempted destruction of God's people
[44:11] and the discrediting of God's Word right
[44:14] down to the time he's tested like a fire
[44:16] he fights that he cannot stand that he
[44:20] knows that the people get the true
[44:22] revelation of the true church and what
[44:24] she is and what she stands for and that
[44:26] she can do the greater works
[44:28] she'll be invincible army if they got a
[44:31] true revelation of the two spirits
[44:32] within the framework of the Christian
[44:34] Church and by God's Spirit discern and
[44:37] withstand the Antichrist spirit Satan
[44:41] will be powerless before her that's the
[44:44] purpose of all the sermons on the book
[44:46] of Revelation
[44:47] that's what Ron Graham said is so you
[44:48] and I can have a revelation in other
[44:51] words an unveiling unban okay this is
[44:54] the true spirit and this is the false
[44:56] fear and then discern that and then
[44:59] withstand it cuz sometimes Church we
[45:00] know what sin is but we still fall into
[45:02] it right so if you morally just unveil
[45:06] it all that scent but we've got to
[45:08] overcome that by God's grace amen
[45:10] we've got to catch that down we've got
[45:13] to overcome that by the grace of the
[45:15] Lord that's the whole purpose of these
[45:18] so don't ever try to let yourself get
[45:20] maybe tired of the church ages are tired
[45:22] of the seals it meant so much God had to
[45:25] sent a prophet to give it to us
[45:26] and that we can withstand and understand
[45:29] I'll get this to the church spirit this
[45:31] is a false spirit and I hope that's what
[45:33] you've been able to see through Ephesus
[45:35] Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira up to this
[45:37] point I hope that's what you've been
[45:39] able to see the true spirit of the
[45:41] church at the pulse spirit and I believe
[45:44] every family and every individual if you
[45:46] look through your lives this will help
[45:47] you
[45:48] these sermons will help you to see are
[45:50] you at your first love it's taking
[45:53] cooling you off are you doing already
[45:55] doing all the works are increasing your
[45:56] works for God where are you at in this
[45:58] you see how you can apply every word of
[46:00] God to your life well Graham says the
[46:02] church Facebook we are such a blessed
[46:04] people that at any moment in our lives
[46:05] we can see where we stand with God we
[46:08] know where we stand through the three
[46:09] works of grace through you know the
[46:11] stature perfect man here now the church
[46:14] ages gives us another view of that we
[46:16] can see where we said where are we are
[46:18] we going through an accurate time of
[46:20] great persecution where we act and we
[46:23] want to find ourselves in the love of
[46:24] God now wherever we are we have power to
[46:28] overcome midnight if we're in a little
[46:30] water state in faretta or wherever we
[46:32] are we've got power to come out of it
[46:34] and that so if we get that if we can
[46:38] understand the true spirit at the false
[46:41] spirit will definitely for Satan today
[46:44] as when Christ was stood as every effort
[46:46] to gain power over him in the desert
[46:49] Satan hates revelation but we love it
[46:52] with true revelation our lives the gates
[46:54] of Hell cannot prevail against us but we
[46:56] will prevail over them you say then to
[46:59] that see the Christian life is
[47:01] prevailing and then keeping that
[47:04] prevailing over sin you've got the once
[47:07] overcome it and then you've got to keep
[47:09] prevailing over that's what the word
[47:11] coat means we look at that at the end of
[47:13] the service the word coat Co be the
[47:15] Radisson we must have we have to coat
[47:17] with all our trials and that means to
[47:19] keep the battle going
[47:21] that's what Kofi st. ahem if I'm coping
[47:24] with this hardship I'm keeping the
[47:26] battle going that that hasn't defeated
[47:28] me but I'm able to cope with it I'm
[47:30] going able to have success over I'm able
[47:32] to get the victory over amen that's what
[47:35] the word coat means and we only do that
[47:36] by the Holy Spirit that's why if we go
[47:39] to
[47:39] anything else to code to find coping a
[47:42] comfort will be disappointed will keep
[47:46] falling back into the city we've got to
[47:48] go to Christ for he is our hope hope has
[47:51] a name peace has a name love has a name
[47:54] and that Dave is Jesus Christ amen
[47:56] it has a day it's Jesus Christ and he is
[47:59] the word of God glory now let's go
[48:04] through this and working my way towards
[48:06] like I said verse 20 26 I'm working my
[48:10] way there
[48:11] we're skating the highlights like I said
[48:12] because some of these things I've
[48:13] already preached on like Wednesday we
[48:15] preach living on Jezebel and that was a
[48:16] great message for me because that's what
[48:17] I lied to decide to get baptized amen
[48:20] got baptized right after that law that's
[48:21] a great time in my life for that quite
[48:24] vividly now we finish Wednesday night by
[48:28] showing how Jezebel had daughters that's
[48:31] what we close with and we showed how
[48:35] this was even a great point brother
[48:37] branham brought up even said we even
[48:39] yelled whoa when he breached in 1960
[48:41] said did you catch that
[48:42] the mother Roman got the church has
[48:44] daughters in other words denominations
[48:46] that came we know that we end with that
[48:50] and we showed how Jezebel's literal
[48:52] daughter married into Judah Judah had
[48:55] been going good for a long time then
[48:57] many numerous godly kings but once that
[48:59] marriage took place once the daughters
[49:02] married into Judah
[49:03] it was all downhill after that Jew
[49:05] didn't last much longer after that and
[49:07] that's a beautiful type of warning I
[49:11] should say beautiful type of warning to
[49:13] us not to marry to any organization and
[49:16] the organizational spirit member just
[49:18] comes in real innocent right oh do you
[49:21] have to keep doing that Trump to keep
[49:22] doing that oh it's okay if we do a
[49:24] little bit this the worldliness and it
[49:25] pretty much comes in and then when
[49:27] people fail to move on with the holy
[49:29] spirit and they've already denominated
[49:30] you have to write anymore bylaws we can
[49:33] keep our bylaws and everybody had a
[49:34] chance to read through a couple years
[49:35] ago everybody had a chance to read those
[49:37] bylaws those bylaws don't contradict
[49:39] God's Word that's fine but listen if we
[49:42] don't keep the Spirit of God here which
[49:44] means humility and repentance and
[49:47] obedience then the Holy Spirit will
[49:49] leave us and we don't have to write
[49:51] bylaws because we've already denominated
[49:54] because that's the works ain't trying to
[49:56] make us cold formal powerless we've got
[49:59] to have power over sin right we don't
[50:01] have to write over the bylaws that's
[50:02] just that's a later
[50:04] that's a later fruit of what's already
[50:06] having in people's lives when they don't
[50:08] want anymore of god so god help us have
[50:11] the spiritual law in our hearts a man
[50:13] that will keep us hungry two thirsting
[50:15] after God a bad Lord that's right so
[50:19] brother now goes into the punishment of
[50:21] these daughters and the mother so the
[50:24] Roman Catholic Church and all dumb
[50:25] denominations even if they're not
[50:26] officially denominations anyone who
[50:28] limits the Holy Spirit what will be the
[50:31] punishment the heart and her children
[50:32] well it's going to be twofold mercy said
[50:35] on caster Nevada Court in the last part
[50:36] of verse 22 it's a better tribulation of
[50:39] Great Tribulation that's exactly what
[50:41] Jesus said in Matthew 25 we know the
[50:43] parable of the ten virgins
[50:45] remember they were locked out of foolish
[50:48] virgins weren't locked out of the
[50:49] wedding
[50:50] they couldn't go in now that scripture
[50:53] doesn't say weeping and gnashing of
[50:54] teeth but the other parable Matthew that
[50:57] Matthew does let's go to that let's go
[50:58] back through 20 to 25 just says they're
[51:02] sad you know that they're not in the
[51:04] they're not the wedding you know they're
[51:05] trying to get in but both a pair will
[51:10] speak of a wedding and people missing
[51:12] out on a wedding so in Matthew 22 the
[51:17] chapter begins with this story it's 2:20
[51:21] to 1 to 14 remember the foolish virgins
[51:24] story just today say Lord Lord open to
[51:26] us he said I know you not so the door
[51:29] going to be open to the marriage supper
[51:31] right and you said just watch therefore
[51:34] you don't have to dare it out but in
[51:36] Matthew 22 verses 1 is 14 you have a
[51:40] parable of the great the King making a
[51:42] supper for a son his wedding and number
[51:45] they send out three messengers and so
[51:46] for like that but at the end somebody
[51:49] got into there without a garment on and
[51:52] they treated respectfully they call it a
[51:54] friend the King comes in the king now
[51:56] look at this I love this type member
[51:58] this type of adverse 2011 I purchased up
[52:00] two years ago I did the King
[52:03] comes in one last time before they start
[52:05] the wedding I like that because the king
[52:07] is going to come into his bride one more
[52:09] time before the wedding
[52:11] hallelujah and he's going to pull out
[52:13] anything that doesn't please God anyone
[52:15] who doesn't have a wedding garment
[52:16] anyone who's not baptized with the Holy
[52:18] Ghost the King what am I talking about a
[52:20] refilling of the Holy Ghost amen the
[52:23] Holy Ghost was going to visit the fight
[52:24] one more time hallelujah
[52:26] Loran accosted the latter rain he's
[52:28] going to visit one more time than all
[52:30] those who are born again we'll have to
[52:32] leave the gathering of the bride it's a
[52:34] worldwide Universal Katherine it's a
[52:36] gathering in heavenly places amen it's
[52:39] exactly right and verse 11 the King
[52:42] comes in one more time there's I believe
[52:44] that's the latter rain I think that's
[52:46] the part of the third pole for the bride
[52:47] verse 12 he says friend how K misses her
[52:50] image that are not having a wedding
[52:51] garment he said he was speechless he
[52:53] said nothing he was speechless now verse
[52:56] 13 then the king said the servant I have
[52:59] handed foot and taken away has some in
[53:01] outer darkness nursery weeping and
[53:02] gnashing of teeth for many are called
[53:04] but few are chosen see that some of the
[53:06] foolish version are going to hang around
[53:08] the bride for a while but when the King
[53:10] comes into the last time when that
[53:12] really filling of the Holy Ghost comes
[53:13] the foolish virgins still put it on they
[53:16] still put they'll see the move of God
[53:18] and they'll be content just to be church
[53:20] members rather than have Christ that
[53:22] being Christ members amen glory we say
[53:24] like that we want to be Christ's members
[53:26] more than just church members you should
[53:28] be a church member but you need to be a
[53:30] christ members and that's how the rebel
[53:34] said that's how Satan the highest he
[53:36] said there's tactic was to reject the
[53:38] holy spirit that is this daughter and
[53:40] her her mother their tactic is to deny
[53:42] the Holy Spirit yet remain church
[53:44] members and we'll get to that a bit of
[53:47] the message they got the court of the
[53:48] earth message that's been attracted and
[53:50] the only weapon they have is argument
[53:53] they just want to argue about this that
[53:55] rather need humble brothers if you watch
[53:57] the Holy Spirit when the person's really
[53:59] got the Holy Ghost when the word comes
[54:01] to them they submit to it obey it they
[54:03] don't want to argue about it they submit
[54:05] to it and obey God bless this church for
[54:07] obey the Holy Spirit man it's a real
[54:09] privilege to be a pastor of a church
[54:10] like this that will be sweet and humble
[54:12] and all my interactions with every
[54:15] even never that's remained and stay true
[54:17] to God's Word they've been so submissive
[54:19] to the Holy Spirit thank God for that
[54:21] even last Sunday was a nice little
[54:22] example there in our office just to see
[54:24] someone so submissive to the Holy Spirit
[54:26] we appreciated that but Ransa the five
[54:29] that remained outside were left to the
[54:32] Great Tribulation that's what will
[54:33] happen to all who did not go up in the
[54:35] rapture that is what will come upon the
[54:37] harlot and her children in dollars
[54:40] that's the first fold the first fold of
[54:43] being an organization is a tribulation
[54:45] the second he said it will kill them
[54:47] with death as the literal translation
[54:50] says let them he put the death with them
[54:52] he said that's a strange saying death
[54:55] itself is the cause of their death -
[54:59] taken so here was Jezebel with her pegan
[55:02] ISM which Minos Romek on the church over
[55:04] there's Judah properly worshiping God
[55:06] and living under the word so Jezebel
[55:08] marries her daughter to jail Ram the
[55:10] minute that happens jom causes the
[55:12] people to become idolaters the minute
[55:15] that marriage took place Judah was dead
[55:16] spiritual death came in the minute that
[55:18] first her to Rome organized and was dead
[55:22] see the minute Whitchurch will organize
[55:25] and say no more leadership with a Holy
[55:26] Spirit
[55:27] no more leadership boy sure can't take
[55:30] us any further we're content we don't
[55:32] want to go any further with God the man
[55:34] that happens that's that's it that means
[55:38] no revival right know more about it
[55:40] that's all that's the spirit of
[55:42] organization I'm not going any further
[55:43] with the Lord brother Jesse you're
[55:45] preaching cannot move any further well
[55:47] I'll let you go my preaching can't move
[55:49] anybody
[55:49] but if the Holy Ghost you get a hold on
[55:51] that we'll move somebody amen right but
[55:53] if you've crucified some people that's
[55:55] what the Bible says they crucified the
[55:57] effects of the Holy Spirit they will
[55:59] obey God any further that can't be
[56:01] taught anything new they can't learn
[56:03] anything about God they can't grow the
[56:05] grace of knowledge of God we must be
[56:06] humble disciples of Christ amen
[56:09] and I'm not talking denomination I'm
[56:11] talking about a humble learner because
[56:13] that's what a disciple is someone who
[56:15] can learn the Word of God I just so I
[56:17] just so you know Church of S is for
[56:19] years but I'm still practice I'm praying
[56:21] to God to help us to learn to come to
[56:22] church early and pray before services
[56:24] appreciate that I know it's not
[56:26] something you can turn on like a light
[56:27] bulb I know that
[56:28] you have to plan ahead you have to learn
[56:30] discipline the church said and that you
[56:33] have to learn that that's one of my
[56:34] prayers now Church if we can't learn
[56:36] that what are we learning praise the
[56:39] Lord
[56:39] or if you just can't do it then I need
[56:42] to make the decision is OK than once
[56:43] we'll start a prayer service at 11:00
[56:45] right and I will pray for 20 minutes
[56:48] half hour wherever we feel that to do
[56:49] but see that's the reason program says
[56:51] that the Holy Spirit don't move people
[56:53] will sacrifice time for God it's not by
[56:56] money that the Holy Ghost moves it's my
[56:58] time like Daniel they said oh we're
[57:01] going to kill Dan we Ricola magicians
[57:03] magicians because Nebuchadnezzar in a
[57:05] dream yeah I said just give me one with
[57:06] it give me time don't give me money
[57:08] don't get me necklaces don't get me gold
[57:10] silver just give me time and God will
[57:12] give the revelation that's what every
[57:14] child of God needs just more time with
[57:16] God and I upgrade your hand I know
[57:18] that's what you need to we all need that
[57:20] I need that we all need more time with
[57:22] God I didn't that's why we appreciate
[57:25] the time that we have together the
[57:27] minute the Lutheran's organized that
[57:28] came in they died the Pentecostals came
[57:30] along last and they organized the spirit
[57:33] left go they don't believe it look at
[57:35] that they still don't believe the skirt
[57:36] them
[57:37] but he did that marriage brought death
[57:39] and see that's what I wanted to stop
[57:42] there I can say that the spirit hasn't
[57:46] left us but I could be deceived any
[57:49] church could do that you can say oh I
[57:51] still got the spirit on my desk but you
[57:53] could be to see because all the churches
[57:55] today say they have the Holy Spirit
[57:57] moving among them and this in church
[57:59] they might in justification but most of
[58:02] them have no sanctification there may be
[58:06] if you have the solids out there that
[58:07] got a little bit of segregation but most
[58:10] the Pentecost but I've been do it I
[58:11] visit last year in my home church that
[58:13] was racing but they have no
[58:15] sanctification it's dog-eat-dog is you
[58:18] never you won't just come to church and
[58:19] scream and shout and get in the spirit
[58:20] and somebody's seeking tons or somebody
[58:23] doing a word or prophecy or so if I got
[58:24] that I just seen it last year I was out
[58:26] Virginia that's all it's all they desire
[58:29] they won't pee up their lives it won't
[58:30] obey the Word of God but we are
[58:32] interested in obeying the Word of God
[58:33] and what you obey proves the Spirit is
[58:37] with you
[58:38] if you obey all the word the spirits
[58:40] with you if you're holding back then
[58:42] you've back sit on the Holy Spirit and
[58:44] you might just be saying this goods with
[58:46] you don't give your own God if you're
[58:48] child of God God will continue to stay
[58:50] with you I'm talking about this
[58:52] organization is denominated people to
[58:55] nominate their lives they sent offenses
[58:57] and we said we can go no further in
[58:59] Christ we're not going to give any more
[59:00] effort we're not going to give any more
[59:02] service to God where I can make any more
[59:04] sacrifices this is as far as I go
[59:06] brother Jesse this is all I want out of
[59:08] my church experience and this is what we
[59:11] should say this is this is what we want
[59:13] to have our church experience all the
[59:14] Word of God and whoever God leads us
[59:17] hallelujah he's leading us into heart
[59:21] dedication right here I'll be getting
[59:24] ahead of myself and all the reservist
[59:26] for the message now here's what he does
[59:27] he says I want to he puts he puts
[59:31] revelation 13 the whole chapter he
[59:33] injects into the church age book it
[59:35] takes up about two pages
[59:37] he puts the whole chapter in there
[59:39] because he said I want to show you
[59:41] organization what's going to happen
[59:43] through it I'm just going to go this
[59:44] briefly his last fought preached a whole
[59:46] sermon on the whole book of Revelation
[59:48] 13 I preached a whole sermon showed all
[59:50] the symbols and I'll put it on YouTube
[59:52] pretty soon by God's grace
[59:54] well my man said this chapter shows the
[59:56] power of the Roman Catholic Church and
[59:58] what she will do through organization
[1:00:00] remember this is the false life let it
[1:00:02] name the name of Lord does so only in a
[1:00:04] lot its headship is not the Lord but of
[1:00:06] Satan and finally ends up completely
[1:00:08] identified with the Beast the horatii of
[1:00:11] the starlit beast distinctly shows her
[1:00:12] power is the god of for Satan and not
[1:00:16] our God the Lord Jesus Christ now in
[1:00:21] 1317 so this is a beast chapter this is
[1:00:23] this is the America chapter this is a
[1:00:26] verse about America because America
[1:00:27] begins in 1311 and goes to the end in
[1:00:32] verse 17 it emphatically shows that she
[1:00:34] will gain absolute control over the
[1:00:36] Commerce of the earth her no man can by
[1:00:38] herself part from her this is born out
[1:00:40] of Revelation 18 9 through 17 which
[1:00:42] shows her involvement with kiddies the
[1:00:44] other rolling down the churches of all
[1:00:45] the kings
[1:00:46] these merchants all who have to do with
[1:00:49] Rome and commerce in revelation 13:14 we
[1:00:54] learned the Beast spreads his influence
[1:00:55] through the image which was no print
[1:00:57] that image that is made as a worldwide
[1:00:59] Academical Council where to all the
[1:01:01] organized churches will get together
[1:01:02] with the Roman Catholics they're doing
[1:01:04] it up
[1:01:04] it is white us for this union will come
[1:01:07] in order to stop the power of communism
[1:01:09] oh brother lays with autumn here this
[1:01:11] temptation is going to be very lucrative
[1:01:13] if you don't join with the Catholics
[1:01:16] that you're really not fighting against
[1:01:17] Isis or you're not fighting against Iran
[1:01:20] or North Korea if you don't join with us
[1:01:22] and you're really not fighting against
[1:01:23] two or three and other nuclear missiles
[1:01:26] you see how you're not really fighting
[1:01:28] against this you're not really a
[1:01:29] Christian you drop fighting Isis or
[1:01:31] whatever this in whatever the enemy is
[1:01:33] at the ends but I said it might be I
[1:01:35] mean ISM it might be you see how what a
[1:01:38] temptation is or you should take a
[1:01:40] bigger stand on Facebook or you should
[1:01:42] write more about this or you should you
[1:01:44] should do more your church brother Jesse
[1:01:45] take up a cassette the only one I'm
[1:01:47] standing with is Jesus Christ a hat I
[1:01:50] will not stand with false churches and
[1:01:52] denominations and the daughters of
[1:01:54] Jezebel I will love individuals in those
[1:01:57] churches but those churches are
[1:01:58] daughters of the is that right and
[1:02:01] those churches will never repent they'll
[1:02:03] never change their bylaws I'm not
[1:02:05] standing with them understand with
[1:02:07] Christ I'm saying come over my people
[1:02:09] that you be not partakers of her sins in
[1:02:11] her plague say then that's what I'm
[1:02:13] doing
[1:02:14] that's what you and I should do as well
[1:02:16] that's right and anybody that don't
[1:02:18] understand that is not reading the
[1:02:20] message deep enough or not reading the
[1:02:22] Bible deep enough my brother couldn't
[1:02:24] when I when I have a condemned the
[1:02:25] Catholic Church under the condemn that
[1:02:27] I'm not talking about individuals it's
[1:02:29] the sphere behind that and any spirit
[1:02:31] that would get mad at that is not the
[1:02:33] Spirit of God that's exactly right
[1:02:35] because look how the Bible condemns that
[1:02:37] over and over and over and over
[1:02:40] that's the trailer surfer right it
[1:02:43] started a servant and then it changed
[1:02:44] form and now it's the spirit of Jezebel
[1:02:46] now it's a Mystery Babylon now Babylon
[1:02:48] as a woman is that right who's the
[1:02:51] dominating female she dominates over all
[1:02:53] their lives but the word is what
[1:02:54] dominates us amen it's exactly right see
[1:02:58] how it's going to be such a temptation
[1:03:00] they're going to control your money
[1:03:01] they're going to freeze my bank account
[1:03:02] they're going to freeze this if you
[1:03:04] don't join in with that well the rabbit
[1:03:06] says we might see a little bit that
[1:03:07] temptation he says but before that
[1:03:09] Christ will come and raptures brought
[1:03:11] out the earth exactly right then brother
[1:03:14] man I'm not going to go through this
[1:03:15] program with legs Oh a few paragraphs
[1:03:17] about this I preached on that very
[1:03:19] thoroughly especially on Sunday nights I
[1:03:21] preached through daddy I'll preach that
[1:03:22] thoroughly
[1:03:23] I learned Daniel 11 like for next week
[1:03:25] Lord willing I'm going to skip down to
[1:03:27] here we bender that it's the same beast
[1:03:29] that came out of the sea it's the same
[1:03:31] dragon that tries to devour that woman
[1:03:35] with the Sun overhead that was Israel
[1:03:37] right you got the 12 stars 12 tribes of
[1:03:39] Israel now verse 8 this is 13 a
[1:03:43] revelation 13:8 speaking of this is the
[1:03:46] Holy Roman Empire unholy war thrown in
[1:03:49] fire and all the 12 long years all whose
[1:03:52] names are not written a book of life of
[1:03:53] the lamb slain from the foundation world
[1:03:55] shall worship Him thank God I just
[1:03:59] thought I put this in here so we can
[1:04:00] thank God a little bit during service
[1:04:01] okay
[1:04:01] thank God the sheet cannot worship but I
[1:04:05] pursued everyone but the very life would
[1:04:08] be to see but they will not be to see
[1:04:12] for they hear the Shepherd's voice and
[1:04:14] they follow we just have to look at all
[1:04:19] those names or another book of life will
[1:04:22] worship the Pope and her daughters yeah
[1:04:24] the mother in regards they'll be
[1:04:26] deceived by that the shirt you gave us a
[1:04:28] leash you're a Buddhist virgin but
[1:04:30] actually let's press up into the wise
[1:04:32] version a name cause it basically is I
[1:04:34] just kind of pray off and get the oil a
[1:04:36] day that's right right you're guaranteed
[1:04:40] that because if you will not worship
[1:04:42] that system you're already guaranteed to
[1:04:44] be able sergeant let's just go a little
[1:04:46] higher Christ a man and I just want to
[1:04:48] go higher
[1:04:48] I want to go higher Oh more Friday and I
[1:04:51] pray this numerous tiny last few months
[1:04:53] God if I don't have the baptism of the
[1:04:54] Holy Ghost you've given to me but I'm
[1:04:56] keeping this because this is coming this
[1:04:58] far and this is better than anything
[1:05:00] I've ever experienced before
[1:05:02] I'm keeping this until something else
[1:05:04] comes in here now my daily walk what I
[1:05:08] tell us say hi so say I'm born again I'm
[1:05:10] baptized with the Holy Ghost I'm filled
[1:05:12] with all he goes P side and follow me
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:14] that's what I said but before God I say
[1:05:17] God if I don't have what I professed
[1:05:19] that then I know you'll bring it because
[1:05:20] I'm asking parting and hallelujah it's
[1:05:24] exactly right like I told you whatever I
[1:05:28] can heal myself the Holy Spirit get
[1:05:29] somebody to believe me now moves on the
[1:05:31] scene it's like with any true gift of
[1:05:33] God now I'm going to see this that when
[1:05:36] we've been trying to show you this seed
[1:05:38] of death to start in the first stage the
[1:05:40] seed of organization has finally grown
[1:05:42] into the tree in which every foul bird
[1:05:46] is lodged I want to skip that remember
[1:05:51] this I preached this last year programs
[1:05:56] and services at the end time preach to
[1:05:58] 12 Bible mysteries remember that 1200
[1:06:01] mysteries the first mysteries the
[1:06:02] kingdom of heaven creases parallel
[1:06:04] mysteries so brother Branham said that
[1:06:07] the Satan's Spirit is white horse rider
[1:06:10] that was like a seat and it grew up is
[1:06:13] like a mustard seed and it grew up to
[1:06:15] the end of the church age we're at right
[1:06:16] now right
[1:06:18] and now Satan seed is grown up now and
[1:06:21] now we're seeing the fruits of
[1:06:22] denomination praise God
[1:06:24] now we've seen the fruits of the mother
[1:06:26] harlot and her daughter's we're seeing
[1:06:29] the fruits but its total compromise it's
[1:06:31] going to church but not obeying the Word
[1:06:33] of God that's what it is they've added
[1:06:36] their fruits of unbelief fruits of
[1:06:39] disobedience remember the Bible said uh
[1:06:41] that Hosea said he told Israel he said
[1:06:45] you've eaten the fruit of lies remember
[1:06:48] that just like the fruit of the garden
[1:06:50] eating something teaching on sufferance
[1:06:51] eat I got I got this on my mind here I'm
[1:06:53] gonna make a video and does it be done
[1:06:54] now I'm just going to end it but the
[1:06:57] fruit they partook of was the fruit of
[1:06:59] adultery it started off as a seed in
[1:07:02] ease mind Oh surely you won't die and
[1:07:06] that seed rapidly grew until they
[1:07:09] partook of the fruit of adultery that's
[1:07:12] what it is
[1:07:13] every saint tries to attack every person
[1:07:15] to play
[1:07:15] see I believe a seed of doubt a seed of
[1:07:19] some type of CID and if they obey that
[1:07:21] we saw that that luck versus lust then
[1:07:24] gloves conceives and thats it now has
[1:07:26] life in their life and then it brings
[1:07:29] for sin or unbelief and then it brings
[1:07:31] forth death
[1:07:32] hallelujah see that's what's happening
[1:07:34] that's rappin to people's lives that's
[1:07:36] one of the mysteries this foolish can't
[1:07:39] see that right uh the daughters of
[1:07:42] Jezebel can't see that but the bride
[1:07:44] sees it a man the children of God see
[1:07:46] you hallelujah
[1:07:47] they understand the mysteries of God
[1:07:50] exactly right Church hmm Kingdom of
[1:07:54] Heaven the second one is the New
[1:07:56] Testament body of Jews and Gentiles
[1:07:59] third is the church as the Bride of
[1:08:01] Christ in Ephesians 5 this was a
[1:08:04] features 2 and 3 and Romans 11 I have
[1:08:07] all the scriptures like I said I've got
[1:08:08] priest I actually saved a sermon on
[1:08:09] YouTube so it's on YouTube that's going
[1:08:11] to watch it I would watch TV Scott I was
[1:08:13] blessed by verse 4 now the fourth
[1:08:17] mystery isn't catching up or rapture of
[1:08:19] the church the fifth one is the will of
[1:08:21] God the six mystery is the mystery of
[1:08:23] godliness which I believe to be the
[1:08:24] stature Birdman morongo net the set of
[1:08:27] the mysteries of seven stars and golden
[1:08:29] candlesticks in the hand of Christ I've
[1:08:32] got the candlestick Sunday number eight
[1:08:34] the mystery of the Godhead got the
[1:08:35] father in Christ in flash in chapter 2
[1:08:37] pursuit many of the mystery of iniquity
[1:08:39] in 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 then you
[1:08:42] got Mystery Babylon the revelation 17
[1:08:44] then you have the finest of Israel
[1:08:46] romans 11 and the mystery of christ in
[1:08:48] you which is Colossians chapter 1 a bit
[1:08:50] of the Lord over the Bible said the
[1:08:52] mystery of God would be finished at the
[1:08:55] end time and all 12 Bible mysteries have
[1:08:57] been revealed to us by God's prophet 8 I
[1:09:00] know you were living in the days of the
[1:09:03] prophecy of the prophets amen the
[1:09:05] fulfillment of all the properties we're
[1:09:07] living in that day
[1:09:08] that's the one right there state lights
[1:09:11] to get if you can just get a little
[1:09:12] different yellow see that's what the
[1:09:14] book of Revelation does it helps you
[1:09:17] discern by obeying the holy spirit for
[1:09:20] the spirit of iniquity if you're real
[1:09:22] born again think of God you're able to
[1:09:24] discern and withstand the spirits and
[1:09:26] walking obedience to the word amen I
[1:09:29] didn't idiot I ain't had it thank you
[1:09:31] Jesus
[1:09:32] now the seven parable mystery the one we
[1:09:35] just read brother Graham brings out was
[1:09:36] number three the grain of mustard seed
[1:09:38] now I believe there's a dual
[1:09:40] interpretation of that I believe faith
[1:09:41] is like a mustard seed I believe that
[1:09:43] but when brother Branham preaches it
[1:09:45] here and he preaches it also in the 1960
[1:09:47] sermon Thyatira he uses this as an
[1:09:50] example of sin if you plant a little sin
[1:09:53] seed as small as a mustard seed it will
[1:09:55] grow up and then you have every bird and
[1:09:58] birds represent demon powers and demon
[1:10:00] spirits and habits right evil spirit
[1:10:03] habits if you let a little iniquity grow
[1:10:05] and grow and grow pretty soon the person
[1:10:08] still with sinful acts it's exactly
[1:10:10] right amen but of course faith is the
[1:10:13] same weight you plant faith in your
[1:10:14] heart and don't dig it up what are you
[1:10:16] going to save my family or not or God am
[1:10:19] I going to go on the rapture that or God
[1:10:20] gonna do this or that matter see don't
[1:10:22] give it up believe God's Word let it
[1:10:24] grow and it will grow into a great
[1:10:26] blessing amen so the 7 parables of the
[1:10:29] four grounds four kinds of states my
[1:10:31] best revelation 20:2 he that's holy holy
[1:10:34] still he that's righteous righteous
[1:10:36] still he that's filthy filthy still he's
[1:10:38] got unholy son holy still we're gonna
[1:10:41] come to our still spot at some point
[1:10:43] we're going to still be holy we're going
[1:10:46] to seal the righteous I would be holy
[1:10:47] church hey man that's the only times
[1:10:49] will come to a standstill said the
[1:10:51] rapture you know that that's the only
[1:10:53] time you'll come to up a stand those out
[1:10:55] of the rapture because he that's holy
[1:10:57] will be holy still
[1:10:58] amen now that reminds me of this church
[1:11:02] go to Ezekiel 46 9 this was not in my
[1:11:05] power point but it was in my reading
[1:11:09] this week when I was reading here at the
[1:11:11] church z-bo 46 not I've been preaching
[1:11:13] this over and over
[1:11:14] rather church age through quotes or
[1:11:16] other grab I never realized how
[1:11:17] scripture was and I think this is a
[1:11:19] little nugget
[1:11:20] forests on the Holy Spirit I notice it
[1:11:23] up you from the host group
[1:11:25] DQ o 46:9 you know the officer sometimes
[1:11:32] you're a zq oh I'm having a hard time
[1:11:33] reading through there some of the
[1:11:36] chapters 237 I get roadside about the
[1:11:37] dry bones and in chapter 9 goes at side
[1:11:40] private abomination if you're real
[1:11:41] excited about some of those some of them
[1:11:43] a little bit tough to understand exactly
[1:11:44] zq only exactly as he saying but as I
[1:11:48] was reading chapter 46 this week the
[1:11:51] first time now this is the worship of
[1:11:53] the prince and the people of course I
[1:11:55] think in this case Christ is the prince
[1:11:57] I'm not mistaken the look at verse 9
[1:12:00] church what have I been saying what I've
[1:12:02] even read from quotes about brother
[1:12:03] Branham about church attendance right
[1:12:06] maybe a faithful the house of God have
[1:12:08] been say and we've been reading those
[1:12:09] quotes where the Bible or romance that
[1:12:12] you can't you can't leave the same way
[1:12:14] you came in and that's what we're
[1:12:16] talking about organization people can
[1:12:17] nominate and still come to church and
[1:12:19] they're not getting closer to God well
[1:12:22] how is that scriptural right here's
[1:12:24] where the type is I want to go under
[1:12:27] we're so tired of this how can we not
[1:12:29] leave the same way now if you know this
[1:12:34] chapter it's about a feast day God is
[1:12:36] giving the zekiel thus saith the LORD on
[1:12:38] how to organize the feasts with all
[1:12:40] these tubes coming in and having their
[1:12:43] feast and sacrifice and coming into the
[1:12:45] outer core and holy or not one is just
[1:12:47] outer core now look at verse 9 I was Lee
[1:12:49] this is view but one of the people the
[1:12:53] land shall come before the Lord and the
[1:12:55] solemn feast I know st. Paul said that
[1:12:57] word a feast right now I mean know that
[1:13:00] that's the first finish chapter 6 we're
[1:13:02] keeping the feasts right now and
[1:13:03] holiness and something since they are t
[1:13:05] let me know that remove enough read that
[1:13:07] nothing to it you might read a let's
[1:13:10] read verse 9 no first I don't know you
[1:13:11] know we're in a feast right now every
[1:13:13] that's why every service is so important
[1:13:14] I'm keeping the feasts that Christ
[1:13:17] commanded me to keep a because I know
[1:13:19] it's important because all feasts are
[1:13:21] important it's a time you shut out
[1:13:24] yourself from the world and focus on the
[1:13:26] Lord Jesus nice when you char come
[1:13:28] before Lord of Southeast he the entereth
[1:13:30] by the way of the north gate to worse
[1:13:33] shall go out the way of the south gate
[1:13:35] but he that entered by the way the south
[1:13:38] gate should go born by the way in the
[1:13:39] north gate he should not return by the
[1:13:41] way of the gate whereby he came in but
[1:13:44] shall go forth over against it and the
[1:13:46] church said there is two waves
[1:13:49] hallelujah amen there's two ways to come
[1:13:53] into the outer for either the north case
[1:13:56] or the South's game but God commanded he
[1:13:59] said he'll tell Israel
[1:14:01] Ezekiel go save the Lord whatever way
[1:14:04] you come in you're not going out that
[1:14:06] same way
[1:14:07] oh yeah amen you can't come in and out
[1:14:11] the same way the church says Amen don't
[1:14:15] let the word we don't Calvin to his
[1:14:16] church just a little nugget brothers
[1:14:17] telling them I'm shining up and showing
[1:14:19] the people you cannot come in hey boss
[1:14:22] the same way we're going to coming
[1:14:24] better or worse my desire is if I'm
[1:14:26] telling the south let me go north they
[1:14:28] let me go hired Christ does he go out
[1:14:30] the north wind up going northward
[1:14:33] brother ever saying man it is really
[1:14:35] crossed over land had to go northward
[1:14:37] amen so we seen we must we cannot come
[1:14:40] in and go out the same way you can't say
[1:14:43] well I left Church just the same
[1:14:45] condition I was when I came to know you
[1:14:46] did it
[1:14:47] you either started back siding more you
[1:14:48] grew closer to Christ is that right
[1:14:51] but we have some when you go to church
[1:14:53] it's your chance to express yourself you
[1:14:55] down or show God how much you love him
[1:14:57] that's why you come to church and my man
[1:15:00] said also to stay under the anointing
[1:15:02] and the pouring out before the ghost
[1:15:03] that's why you come you like that little
[1:15:06] you know the Nugget there what a
[1:15:08] beautiful time you get on down it's a
[1:15:10] feast day now let me show you the feast
[1:15:12] maybe you know that first for the n6
[1:15:14] let's go there we're keeping a feast you
[1:15:16] say well we're not having special
[1:15:18] services well just every service is a
[1:15:20] specialist tray that's a revelation of
[1:15:23] our church gets to amen that's what we
[1:15:25] want to grow into every service is a
[1:15:27] special service it's another chance for
[1:15:29] the Holy Spirit to clean us out and draw
[1:15:32] closer to you now remember I'm sorry
[1:15:35] chapter five Saints forgive me I'm sorry
[1:15:37] it's chapter five verses 1 to 6 and 7
[1:15:43] deal with this a brother of the church
[1:15:46] ease of brothers who use that
[1:15:47] times but never said he was only go
[1:15:48] spill but he was having fornication with
[1:15:50] his stepmother so of course then she
[1:15:53] would been commit adultery but he was
[1:15:54] committing fornication
[1:15:55] so both committing whoredoms which is
[1:15:57] any unlawful sex rectum
[1:15:59] now verse says purge out therefore the
[1:16:01] old leaven that ye may be a new lump as
[1:16:03] ye are unleavened
[1:16:04] for even Christ our Passover is
[1:16:06] sacrificed for us therefore let us keep
[1:16:10] the feast not with old leaven neither
[1:16:12] with the leaven of malice and wickedness
[1:16:15] but with unleavened bread of sincerity
[1:16:18] and truth amen
[1:16:24] where did I feel like I'm missing the
[1:16:27] scripture that I read over so fast I
[1:16:29] missed it no there is I'm sorry yeah
[1:16:31] we're selling yeah for even Christ our
[1:16:32] Passover sacrifice for us so we're at a
[1:16:35] feast praise the God we're serving the
[1:16:37] Lord and our peace must be kept with
[1:16:40] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[1:16:43] hallelujah so you say well protest that
[1:16:48] Ezekiel asks about Old Testament feast
[1:16:50] but the Bible said we're in a feast and
[1:16:52] you cannot leave the same way you came
[1:16:55] you got to get closer to God yeah how do
[1:16:58] that agree with the Word of God if you
[1:17:00] can't understand this though this isn't
[1:17:02] the case but if this is so deep you
[1:17:04] counters in it just say Amen to what you
[1:17:06] know I really don't think I'm at D but
[1:17:09] make up too fast Dave that's not maybe
[1:17:11] that's not air in life you know forgive
[1:17:13] me Lord for that
[1:17:14] but then just say lord help me to agree
[1:17:17] with everything I can help me to feast
[1:17:19] on everything I can here I know that you
[1:17:22] know this because ripping apart little
[1:17:23] steak feast and giving a Victoria just
[1:17:25] real slog the rest of my children I'm
[1:17:28] sorry this roast it wasn't steak more
[1:17:30] aggressive I'm sure they can just take a
[1:17:31] big huge hunk and I can take a big huge
[1:17:33] hunk about what I can hand a lot of
[1:17:35] heavy meat but the baby it just makes

[1:18:01] hit the three measures realize that
[1:18:02] Roman Catholic woman cooking up those

[1:18:16] gave different interpretation some time
[1:18:17] consent Christ
[1:18:18] sometimes you said the church was the
[1:18:19] probate process do such you know there's
[1:18:21] there's a few different quotes on that
[1:18:22] in other words Christ wanted to get his
[1:18:25] bride out of the whole world but it's
[1:18:27] also a type of one Christ a net program
[1:18:29] said one day I would see the Pearl great

[1:18:40] think I'm doing good okay okay so let's
[1:18:42] go to the final warning this is a
[1:18:44] section of the church age book going
[1:18:45] against Authority and again if you
[1:18:46] aren't reading the book luckily I plead
[1:18:48] with you read the book read the book
[1:18:50] you'll go closer to God right away
[1:18:51] that's the next book we're going to read
[1:18:52] in our family after we finish the Bible
[1:18:56] we did the we the what's it called the
[1:18:59] family altar with Tim Tim Dodd you did
[1:19:01] both those books for a while then we
[1:19:03] just ran into different devotional books
[1:19:05] and now we're almost through the whole
[1:19:07] Bible we read all the New Testament
[1:19:08] chapter in Psalms right now okay and
[1:19:11] then once we finish the Old Testament
[1:19:12] will be done after that more willing
[1:19:14] we're going to read the church age books
[1:19:15] our family's devotional every night so I
[1:19:17] want my children know that that's how
[1:19:19] Jim fruit was raised
[1:19:20] Jim Crow is race is my rather than
[1:19:22] church age book every morning
[1:19:24] he's a real man of God so I know that
[1:19:26] this thing that's real powerful trying
[1:19:28] to they then it'll take effective public
[1:19:31] believer that's right now verse 23 and
[1:19:34] I'll cure of German death you preach off
[1:19:35] that all the churches should know that I
[1:19:37] am he which searches the reins and
[1:19:40] hearts and I will give unto every one of
[1:19:42] you according to your works but ever
[1:19:45] said God looketh on the heart that has
[1:19:49] never changed
[1:19:50] neither will never change here as though
[1:19:53] all the ages there are two groups both
[1:19:55] proclaiming their revelation from God
[1:19:57] and the relationships you go so program
[1:20:03] code 2nd Timothy 2:19 nevertheless the
[1:20:06] foundation of God standeth show
[1:20:08] or having this seal the Lord knoweth
[1:20:11] them that are his the Lord searches the
[1:20:14] reigns the word search means to track
[1:20:17] and follow up you like how the Holy
[1:20:20] Spirit does that the Holy Spirit will
[1:20:21] track your life what was this right and
[1:20:23] then don't maybe you follow let me go
[1:20:26] let me follow but see if that was the
[1:20:27] right decision I made back there that's
[1:20:30] what the word search means to track it
[1:20:32] to write it down and go back and follow
[1:20:33] up was that the right decision
[1:20:38] God tracks down our thoughts which are
[1:20:42] called the reins and the scripture range
[1:20:43] means thoughts God track sounds our
[1:20:46] thoughts was I thinking the right thing
[1:20:48] he knows what is in our hearts he sees
[1:20:51] our works which are a definite
[1:20:54] manifestation of what lies within us I
[1:20:58] remember last two Wednesdays about for
[1:21:00] each of them I know that works and in
[1:21:02] the bow member that lives over here I
[1:21:03] know that works your works the very
[1:21:09] things you do or don't do for God is the
[1:21:12] manifestation what's inside of me works
[1:21:15] if I save you but you do it in a grant
[1:21:18] and an act of gratitude toward God amen
[1:21:20] you want to do something for God
[1:21:21] it's exactly right like you know I was
[1:21:25] raised in denominations like I tell you
[1:21:27] this you know all the time of raising
[1:21:28] the dalmatian church yeah they had a lot
[1:21:30] of ungodly standards but I am still
[1:21:33] thankful for all the prayers they paid
[1:21:35] for my poor family we had look at sit we
[1:21:37] probably a 10 or 15 bucket 5 gallon
[1:21:39] buckets at our house growing up that
[1:21:41] would catch the rainwater and maybe
[1:21:42] they'd be orange by the Lord they're
[1:21:44] just full of rain you're melting snow we
[1:21:47] were really poor but this church this
[1:21:49] denominational Church this I say like
[1:21:51] this this daughter of a harlot this
[1:21:55] church had such tightness they would pay
[1:21:57] to fix art or to turn our heat and water
[1:22:01] backbone you see because it's not the
[1:22:04] people it's the organization that's the
[1:22:06] harlot there's good people in there
[1:22:09] right right but if the system and
[1:22:11] they're under the influence of that
[1:22:14] system I'm very thankful for that
[1:22:16] but it's left me such gratitude the last
[1:22:19] time I visit there
[1:22:21] some others day prime ops eight years
[1:22:24] ago by now five years ago and I miss it
[1:22:26] there one time I get all the Sunday
[1:22:28] night after preaching the camp I drove
[1:22:29] up an hour and a half and went to the
[1:22:30] sin the night service that there might
[1:22:31] be over there I was so thankful for
[1:22:33] these people and how they prayed for me
[1:22:36] and even though the woman said she said
[1:22:38] thus saith the Lord serpent seed of the
[1:22:39] devil though she said that I still have
[1:22:41] grace in my heart for because uh I just
[1:22:45] said like just there God forgive them
[1:22:48] they don't know what they're doing I
[1:22:49] just say that God have mercy
[1:22:51] all blasting and God knew he was
[1:22:52] ignorant God in mercy on so my prayers
[1:22:54] God have mercy on that bless that's just
[1:22:57] way I approach that but I was so
[1:22:58] thankful I just I was overflowing with
[1:23:01] love not these are people that prayed
[1:23:03] for me these are people that treated me
[1:23:04] right and never abused me they never
[1:23:06] hurt me that and all these years of
[1:23:08] teaching me in Sunday school you know
[1:23:09] coming to my games and and paying for
[1:23:11] Wendy's meals after church on Sunday you
[1:23:13] know they would just treat us so good I
[1:23:15] just had all my I went to Walmart
[1:23:17] and I bought a fifty dollar gift card
[1:23:18] for Outback I think and a bunch of
[1:23:20] flowers I took them over the pastor's
[1:23:22] house and I said thank you now and they
[1:23:25] are their owners when I walk in every
[1:23:26] girl I know pop I believe the message
[1:23:27] now you know I know
[1:23:29] Oh Jesse's had just a goatee and then
[1:23:32] really they're really kind of shaded
[1:23:33] give me a hundred of my head my eyes go
[1:23:35] give the pastor up god bless you Pastor
[1:23:36] he's I just want to give you this take
[1:23:38] you write it out - nice to meet I just
[1:23:40] want to thank you for praying for me all
[1:23:42] those years
[1:23:42] thank you for preaching to me I still
[1:23:45] remember when he got anointed he jumped
[1:23:46] so high his feet were like this high of
[1:23:48] the air like he did one of these where
[1:23:50] he jumps up at his feet come up and he
[1:23:52] was so annoying for the Holy Spirit God
[1:23:54] would move and it was a great atmosphere
[1:23:55] enjoy the atmosphere there many times
[1:23:57] many times I want to repent give my
[1:23:58] heart to God who doesn't love the Spirit
[1:24:00] of God who doesn't love to see the
[1:24:02] Spirit of God moving Church be loving to
[1:24:04] see the Spirit of God boo and then I
[1:24:06] went to give the flowers to his wife and
[1:24:09] she could hurt my heart already look me
[1:24:11] in the eye but there was something to
[1:24:14] get you I'm just going to brush it off a
[1:24:15] little bit and thank you note but there
[1:24:17] was something inside of me and this is
[1:24:19] what we're saying the works you do or
[1:24:21] don't do show what's in your heart
[1:24:23] praise the Lord whatever you do or don't
[1:24:27] do you can show gratitude if you can't
[1:24:30] show Thanksgiving if you can't show
[1:24:31] these things that something's wrong with
[1:24:33] your heart
[1:24:34] the works show it's in your heart a net
[1:24:37] and I could do that to someone who
[1:24:39] blasting the message why because I love
[1:24:41] them I'm not looking at their sin I'm
[1:24:43] looking at my love for them which I
[1:24:45] believe is the manifestation of Christ's
[1:24:47] love in me you see that by God's grace I
[1:24:50] don't what let me to say that but I just
[1:24:51] want to say that your works are definite
[1:24:54] add a station of what lies within us so
[1:24:59] if you don't if you don't pray for the
[1:25:00] poor you might not know anybody for that
[1:25:03] need you you might want to give alms I'm
[1:25:05] not going to ask you raise your hands
[1:25:05] now I'm sure some of you want to give
[1:25:07] alms I'm sure some of you want to do
[1:25:10] other works
[1:25:11] but you need to pray it's a God show me
[1:25:13] someone that I can do almost for because
[1:25:16] those will be a memorial in heaven how
[1:25:20] many want to store riches in heaven you
[1:25:21] don't raise your hand but how many want
[1:25:22] to store which is have well the Bible
[1:25:23] said Cornelius did that by giving alms
[1:25:26] and prayers praise God and if you don't
[1:25:30] do that something's wrong with your
[1:25:31] heart if you don't pray that God show me
[1:25:33] somebody for I prayed that last
[1:25:36] Wednesday and I preached on that I know
[1:25:37] that works and additive order I said and
[1:25:40] I prayed actually God showed me somebody
[1:25:42] for I can give alms to and I turn on
[1:25:44] Facebook at home later and and somebody
[1:25:46] went my friend said I really need a
[1:25:49] money right now I could use some work so
[1:25:53] I said the text he didn't respond to me
[1:25:55] one day two days I kept Exxon's I want
[1:25:58] to do so I wouldn't I would help out the
[1:25:59] par and the reason I've done this
[1:26:02] because nothing came out of it I finally
[1:26:04] got a hobby so thanks for the message I
[1:26:05] said can we bring you over groceries can
[1:26:07] we do some steel help you out he said no
[1:26:11] I just got our check from the government
[1:26:12] we're okay and I said as far as work and
[1:26:15] you do you want to become your
[1:26:17] landscaping at my house I'll pay you to
[1:26:19] work and he said I'll give that John
[1:26:20] that and you never got back to the three
[1:26:21] on that church so what I'm letting you
[1:26:25] know is that we want to do good works
[1:26:27] I'm afraid I'm pleading with God show me
[1:26:29] somebody that's hurting
[1:26:30] show me somebody that I leave me to help
[1:26:33] somebody than the people I find don't
[1:26:35] want to help so what can I do
[1:26:37] keep waiting upon the Lord so you and I
[1:26:42] we're not doing these works if we're not
[1:26:43] praying like we ought to if we're not
[1:26:45] getting all those I could
[1:26:46] giving the poor people like we ought to
[1:26:48] something wrong with our hearts we just
[1:26:50] searched a gospel for that
[1:26:52] how many can say men today I'm just
[1:26:55] giving examples because there's no
[1:26:56] rewards I didn't do anything but God
[1:26:57] knows I prayed for it
[1:26:58] I'm literally praying on my knees your
[1:27:00] Lord show me some I want to do something
[1:27:02] for that kingdom of my eyes to be open
[1:27:05] so sometimes our eyes all we see as are
[1:27:06] our needs all we see is our lives
[1:27:09] instead of seeing having eyes and
[1:27:10] compassion seeing the needs of others
[1:27:12] riding it God's eyes it is out of the
[1:27:16] heart that proceeds either righteousness
[1:27:18] or wickedness our motives so why did we
[1:27:22] do that
[1:27:22] why do we do our what we do our purpose
[1:27:25] what's the purpose behind this all that
[1:27:27] are known unto him as he watches every
[1:27:29] action as a pastor I very thankful for
[1:27:31] that that God knows the motives I don't
[1:27:33] know people smartest we try to help you
[1:27:34] try the preaching right all these things
[1:27:36] I don't know that I don't know the
[1:27:38] motives but God does and God knows my
[1:27:40] vote if Amen God knows our motive is
[1:27:43] just to do the will of God and he
[1:27:48] watches every action we do aren't you
[1:27:50] glad at every action everywhere shall be
[1:27:54] brought to judgment when the accounting
[1:27:55] part lives is given there was no fear of
[1:27:58] God before the false fine and dearly
[1:28:00] shall they paid look at that there's no
[1:28:04] fear of God they didn't fear God they
[1:28:06] just did things and someone's upset that
[1:28:08] it's okay
[1:28:09] I love God I go to church the false find
[1:28:13] doesn't fear God we should have the fear
[1:28:15] of God in our lives now let all who name
[1:28:19] is named so let us become a Saints we
[1:28:21] might not we might fool the people but
[1:28:24] we will never fool the Lord so see if
[1:28:27] you want to fool people and don't let
[1:28:29] the truth be known that sounds like a
[1:28:30] foolish virgin to me or works right we
[1:28:34] don't we want to fool anybody because a
[1:28:35] real Christian is so close to God they
[1:28:37] feel the conviction when it happens
[1:28:38] that's right and I want to inject this
[1:28:42] in here this is from a different part of
[1:28:43] the church age but I already preached
[1:28:45] this chapter knowing true believer is
[1:28:47] any stronger and spiritual healthy and
[1:28:51] alive I don't want to be alive I would
[1:28:53] be healthy
[1:28:54] I don't be strong in Christ here's how
[1:28:56] you do it then your knowledge of and
[1:28:59] here's to the pure Word of God in other
[1:29:03] words you have to be learning how's he
[1:29:04] learning more about the word reminder
[1:29:06] the word and then you have to obey the
[1:29:08] Word of God you'll never be a strong you
[1:29:11] never be as healthy you never be more
[1:29:13] alive than your adherence to obey the
[1:29:16] word and learning more about the Word of
[1:29:18] God as seen by multiple examples that
[1:29:21] Old Testament gives the examples of
[1:29:22] Kings like Solomon David all those kings
[1:29:25] Abraham Jacob Isaac you both Rob so he
[1:29:29] must know the word if I go to church and
[1:29:31] you must obey the Word of God when
[1:29:32] you're not in church but obey it when
[1:29:34] you're in church - grace guy I know that
[1:29:37] works if a man fears that he might not
[1:29:40] believe he's got anybody ever battle
[1:29:41] that I doubt that often I'm just a real
[1:29:42] nervous person I'm my own worst critic
[1:29:46] sometimes I think I'm doing an awful job
[1:29:48] as a passion and Kevin's wife emailed me
[1:29:50] on Monday saying brother Jesse we just
[1:29:51] love you as a pastor we love what you're
[1:29:53] doing I said well thank the Lord I
[1:29:54] really urge because I really battle
[1:29:56] sometimes I did anything good I know I
[1:29:59] am again we go through battles praise
[1:30:01] the Lord and God knows that if you fear
[1:30:04] you're not pleasing God then let him
[1:30:06] fulfill the Word of God let him obey if
[1:30:10] a man wonders and I get to hear those
[1:30:11] words well done good and faithful
[1:30:13] servant then let him fulfill the word of
[1:30:15] God his life and assuredly he will hear
[1:30:18] those words of praise remember the
[1:30:20] parable if God gives you one talent
[1:30:22] invest that talent God gives you three
[1:30:24] invest that tell you find five invest
[1:30:26] that town find what God blesses your
[1:30:29] life and give everything you have in
[1:30:30] hand hey man hallelujah I'm just giving
[1:30:37] ahead now this is back to our church eh
[1:30:39] and then I'm almost done yeah almost
[1:30:42] done
[1:30:42] he's overcometh and keepeth got us back
[1:30:44] to verse now this is the verse 26 I mean
[1:30:46] Fisher I'm there
[1:30:47] that's you yeah I skipped a little bit I
[1:30:53] skipped 24 that's what that's okay I'm
[1:30:56] going to skip to 25 because this thought
[1:30:57] of works came up this thought of works
[1:31:00] and this is something we can all relate
[1:31:01] to women then grandpa or grandma
[1:31:04] children all of us can relate to this
[1:31:06] because we all do works every day praise
[1:31:09] God like with my children my children
[1:31:12] related
[1:31:13] because their works are abated mommy and
[1:31:15] daddy praise God that's all they have to
[1:31:18] do they just have to obey
[1:31:20] let the children what honor their mother
[1:31:21] and father that's the main object of
[1:31:24] their life is to honor me and my wife
[1:31:28] adults we got more works that we can do
[1:31:31] praise the Lord Jesus says he's
[1:31:35] overcometh and keepeth my works unto the
[1:31:38] end so his words so we have to find
[1:31:40] God's will and do God's works in our
[1:31:42] lives it is very evident from the
[1:31:44] remarks of the Spirit on works that the
[1:31:47] Lord is trying to get his own people to
[1:31:50] see his opinion of righteous works four
[1:31:53] times he mentioned words that you catch
[1:31:55] that in this church age four times he
[1:31:59] mentioned your works what you do for God
[1:32:00] right what are we doing for God verse 19
[1:32:04] I know that works instead I works we see
[1:32:09] that my the other ones real quick yeah
[1:32:10] verse 23 I'll give everyone a
[1:32:11] coordinator works and then in verse 26
[1:32:14] he don't come in the keepeth my works to
[1:32:16] the end he keeps mentioning works
[1:32:18] because we got to add works work should
[1:32:20] flow out of a life that loves Christ man
[1:32:22] they should just flow out praise God
[1:32:24] amen I love my wife is my pleasure to
[1:32:26] help her out I love to help out my wife
[1:32:29] I love to call the pizza shop when I
[1:32:31] don't know my wife can't cook I love to
[1:32:33] do that or what's more realistic is I
[1:32:37] love to do spaghetti when my wife don't
[1:32:39] want to come that's more of what I can
[1:32:42] do a little bit easier or make eggs or
[1:32:44] something like that I love you - that's
[1:32:46] not a burger that because I love my wife
[1:32:49] and if you love Christ let the Jews work
[1:32:52] four times Christ mentions works and now
[1:32:56] he says that he who keeps doing his
[1:32:58] works faithfully into the end will be
[1:33:00] given power over nations and will be a
[1:33:03] strong capable unbending ruler ëletís
[1:33:06] this is what you'll be Church if you can
[1:33:08] do keep working for God everyone work
[1:33:09] for God if you keep working for Christ
[1:33:12] on there but not Christ works not your
[1:33:14] works
[1:33:14] Christ's words if you keep doing that
[1:33:17] Christ will give you power over the
[1:33:19] nation's and be a strong capable
[1:33:22] unbending ruler who can cope so
[1:33:25] powerfully with
[1:33:27] any situation isn't that beautiful that
[1:33:30] even the most desperate editing will be
[1:33:32] broken if need be goodness
[1:33:36] numbers God wants you to so obey the
[1:33:39] Holy Spirit that he doesn't have to give
[1:33:41] you an e bus for disobeying anything
[1:33:43] right look I've got a Phoebus for
[1:33:45] disobeying the Holy Spirit right over
[1:33:46] now in South Africa he should have said
[1:33:49] hey Todd I believe it was not mistaken
[1:33:50] er but I just listened to it on the we
[1:33:53] listened to that our band uh God had to
[1:33:56] give amoebas because he kind of bent he
[1:33:58] bent a little bit let the ministers have
[1:33:59] their schedule but he should have took
[1:34:02] the schedule the Holy Spirit amen
[1:34:03] how many of you taking the schedule the
[1:34:05] Holy Spirit it's more motion are you
[1:34:06] coming to church you don't have the
[1:34:08] schedule now the other half is receiving
[1:34:10] the word amen now just company that's
[1:34:12] half the battle they got to that but the
[1:34:15] next part is leaving out a different way
[1:34:16] that you came in a fear of God doing the
[1:34:21] works of God that's a real Christian
[1:34:24] amen
[1:34:25] so we have to learn to that now be so
[1:34:27] unbending in other words nothing is good
[1:34:29] movie brother Kevin off my convictions
[1:34:31] of the Holy Spirit but I had nothing to
[1:34:33] get a movie off this word that I know to
[1:34:36] be true to keep my family in the faith
[1:34:38] and keep myself in the bait nothing's
[1:34:40] going to move me I'll be so unbending
[1:34:42] the devil has no power over me amen
[1:34:45] and if we have that this lecture CH
[1:34:47] surely will have the next life but make
[1:34:50] us rulers over nations now let me show
[1:34:57] you the word cope can I just show you
[1:34:58] the word cope just a minute I thought I
[1:34:59] had on here well there's our page by the
[1:35:03] way see this is my this is my missionary
[1:35:05] work right now I got we have thirteen
[1:35:07] hundred eighty subscribers almost a
[1:35:11] 150,000 views that's my missionary work
[1:35:15] right now the brothers asked me to go
[1:35:16] overseas I said I can't go right now I
[1:35:17] said I got to stay home with my wife for
[1:35:19] a few more years that I'll be back on
[1:35:20] the mission field by the grace of God
[1:35:22] the word code where was it yeah here's
[1:35:28] the word coat the bird we're trying to
[1:35:30] be able to cope with the situation to
[1:35:32] cope means to maintain and contest or
[1:35:35] combat usually on even terms or with
[1:35:38] success that's what we want to be
[1:35:40] don't want to even fight with the devil
[1:35:41] I want to beat the devil hey sister
[1:35:44] I want to beat the devil out and I would
[1:35:46] have put him under my feet because the
[1:35:47] Bible says that Romans 16 we can put
[1:35:50] Satan under our feet
[1:35:51] amen and that means you obey the Word of
[1:35:53] God exactly right
[1:35:56] Satan's under my feet I'm really over
[1:35:59] him he's not tempting me to do what I
[1:36:01] don't want to do I'm telling him what to
[1:36:02] do exactly right get behind me Satan so
[1:36:07] seem to eat coke Christ is only going to
[1:36:09] let people rule who can cope right now
[1:36:10] if you can't cope with problems right
[1:36:12] now I get a coke as a ruler in the New
[1:36:14] Jerusalem in the Millennium I can be a
[1:36:17] ruler there I get a ruler relations if
[1:36:19] you can't rule right now that's right
[1:36:22] and then deal with and attempt to
[1:36:25] overcome for other difficulties learning
[1:36:28] to cope with the demands of the schedule
[1:36:29] right learning to cope with the demands
[1:36:31] of labor seeing how many are Co fait
[1:36:34] with success how many but how many want
[1:36:35] to cope with success by God's grace amen
[1:36:37] absolutely that's what see that's what
[1:36:40] Christ wants and your works will help
[1:36:42] you do that
[1:36:43] we can't cope unless we're doing the
[1:36:45] right works of God obeying everything to
[1:36:48] the letter and that's not legal is
[1:36:50] remember that's love because Jesus
[1:36:52] obeyed every word that wasn't legalism
[1:36:54] that was love when we cope with the
[1:36:57] situation we have we have power in every
[1:36:59] situation his demonstration of rule by
[1:37:03] power will be like under the very
[1:37:04] Sutton's Christ this is very amazing it
[1:37:07] might not have animations here now but
[1:37:09] hope it is or mad I hope it is now by
[1:37:11] God's grace this is amazing brother
[1:37:13] Branham says what's so amazing about it
[1:37:16] we have people who are more concerned
[1:37:20] with God's works than their own works
[1:37:22] and they do not bend to any temptation
[1:37:25] to get for Satan to get them off the
[1:37:27] Word of God
[1:37:28] brother Mannis said that's very amazing
[1:37:30] when you can find somebody who won't
[1:37:31] Bend upon the word and that how many of
[1:37:34] you want to comment how many want to be
[1:37:35] one of those people
[1:37:35] amen how to be one of those people a
[1:37:37] state of our feet I got one more quote
[1:37:39] here I just heard this week on our last
[1:37:41] week on this in two respects 1961 our
[1:37:43] brother Graham quote this preach it a
[1:37:44] few years ago why didn't I look
[1:37:46] conversation about it
[1:37:47] well Graham in the message respects he
[1:37:49] said over to Cleese II ask you the 12th
[1:37:50] chapter let us hear the conclusion
[1:37:53] this is part of his text I don't
[1:37:54] remember that fear God and keep his
[1:37:57] commands but this is the whole duty of
[1:37:59] man so program takes us Old Testament
[1:38:03] Scriptures said that's still to do you
[1:38:04] man the conclusion of the whole matter
[1:38:07] is to fear God and when you cannot have
[1:38:10] respect until you have fear you've got
[1:38:14] to have the fear of God Solomon said in
[1:38:16] the Proverbs that the fear of God is
[1:38:17] beginning wisdom now that don't mean
[1:38:19] you're afraid of it but that means that
[1:38:21] you're giving him respects and the
[1:38:23] reference and when you respect God you
[1:38:28] fear God hey man you fear that you might
[1:38:31] displease him in some way and so you
[1:38:35] love to see what motivates that love
[1:38:36] love you love God so much and you fear
[1:38:39] his Lord I don't want to I don't want to
[1:38:41] hurt you you fear that you might
[1:38:46] displease him in some way you fear lest
[1:38:48] you would do something wrong you
[1:38:50] wouldn't want to now look at this church
[1:38:54] let me say like this I fear God but I
[1:38:55] also fear all of you remember manse is
[1:38:59] the same thing you should fear everyone
[1:39:01] else
[1:39:02] perhaps that I fear my mother I fear my
[1:39:07] wife I fear my church so I fear I come
[1:39:10] when I see I see you guys we saw him to
[1:39:13] BOA Thursday night at Summit mall you
[1:39:16] didn't see us we saw you
[1:39:17] what is that what does that do when you
[1:39:19] see Christians out it brings a little
[1:39:20] bit of fear hope or deliver I want to be
[1:39:21] pure I want to love God I want them to
[1:39:23] see it out of the example right my right
[1:39:26] church
[1:39:26] that's my gathering is so powerful we
[1:39:29] learn to love and fear one another see
[1:39:31] because you're just a walking image of
[1:39:33] Christ
[1:39:34] so are you so is everyone you're a
[1:39:36] walking vessel you're a temple of Christ
[1:39:38] so when when you see another temple of
[1:39:40] price Oh it brings a real reverence and
[1:39:43] I love that 11 I come into some of these
[1:39:44] when we need some of some of the
[1:39:46] brothers I love when I come to the
[1:39:47] friends I can tell them and pray it I
[1:39:49] can tell them and set in their Bible
[1:39:50] because there's just the presence there
[1:39:52] I thought it's a reverence I fear all of
[1:39:59] God's servants
[1:40:01] unless I should put a stumbling-block
[1:40:03] some somehow somewhere in their way I
[1:40:06] hear the people I fear the people the
[1:40:08] city unless I should do something wrong
[1:40:09] that would cause them to think that I
[1:40:11] wasn't a Christian see you've got before
[1:40:15] you before you can have respects you've
[1:40:17] got to have fear but after this is the
[1:40:19] whole duty of men and God demands it he
[1:40:23] demands respects God does he demands it
[1:40:25] and fear brings it and we know that fear
[1:40:28] brings respects
[1:40:30] let me appreciate that by God's grace
[1:40:31] and see if we're not working for God
[1:40:35] it's because we don't fear God we missed
[1:40:36] the whole a whole conclusion of the
[1:40:39] matter is to fear God and seek keep the
[1:40:41] commands obedience praise God the star
[1:40:46] heads how many say brother Jesse Crain
[1:40:47] for me help you don't bay the word more
[1:40:50] help my works to glorify Christ God
[1:40:53] bless my hands up to Heavenly Father
[1:40:56] what a wonderful word we've heard this
[1:40:58] morning pure God I love you chances I
[1:41:02] think about Lord though as we started
[1:41:05] with the mother and her children Lord I
[1:41:06] think about that I was in those I was in
[1:41:08] those daughter churches for so many
[1:41:10] years I was raised in him Lord then when
[1:41:13] I got saved in nineteen I remained in
[1:41:15] him for two more years
[1:41:16] all's I knew was daughters of Jezebel in
[1:41:20] there there was a few that I felt so
[1:41:22] inspired by lord thank you for their
[1:41:25] lives and their testimonies and Lord my
[1:41:29] works didn't match the Word of God when
[1:41:32] I come to this message though I've been
[1:41:33] able to see the Holy Spirit show me the
[1:41:37] two spirits in the framework of the
[1:41:39] church lord help us to withstand that
[1:41:44] evil spirit dear God and help us Lord to
[1:41:48] cope with the trials of life by adhering
[1:41:53] to the Word of God not by disobeying or
[1:41:56] thinking lightly of the word but by
[1:41:58] obeying the word and fearing you and
[1:42:01] keeping your command that's the whole
[1:42:02] duty that's the whole conclusion of our
[1:42:06] lives dear God brother Jesse our Lord O
[1:42:11] Lord some people might say brother Jesse
[1:42:13] what's the will of God for my life you
[1:42:15] can
[1:42:15] start off by Lord we can start off by
[1:42:18] doing I can tell them this fear God keep
[1:42:21] every command you know and Lord as we
[1:42:25] keep every command Lord God surely will
[1:42:28] begin walking into the perfect god the
[1:42:32] permissive will Lord we know is outside
[1:42:34] the word it's a clear disobedience to
[1:42:37] the word but the perfect will is full of
[1:42:39] beatings
[1:42:44] Lord I'm a man that wants to hear well
[1:42:46] done good and faithful servant so Lord
[1:42:50] as I leave out of here I'm going to
[1:42:51] leave a different way I'm going to leave
[1:42:53] closer to Christ I'm going to leave more
[1:42:56] enthused about Christ I'm not going to
[1:42:58] go out the same way I came in my works
[1:43:02] are going to continue to glorify you I'm
[1:43:05] going to give signing cried for the
[1:43:06] nominations I'm going to keep praying
[1:43:08] God show me poor people in this rich
[1:43:10] country dear God Lord lead me to more
[1:43:15] prayer time in the cause of Jesus my
[1:43:18] works

[1:43:27] each one of our works manifest your
[1:43:29] chest you know our works he that keepeth
[1:43:35] your works to the end shall be saved

[1:43:41] hands busters that are hungry and
[1:43:42] thirsty for more righteousness I know
[1:43:44] you will Lord I'm very thankful for
[1:43:46] their lives Lord very thankful their
[1:43:48] testimonies help us to learn as a church
[1:43:51] as we said to walk further help us to be
[1:43:54] able to learn something Lord from you
