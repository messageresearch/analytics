[Music] i just like to preach a little thought on the names of god and i just had a little sub topic i am i'm sorry i am what the i am says that i am so i heard that in a song one time i thought that's really interesting i am what i am because the i am tells me who i am i was like wow i really like that um so i just want to just preach on that like that's my sub topic i am what the i am says i am i want to look at the names of god here so let's read exodus 3 13 14 and i actually want to read 15 2 because god tells moses this about his name verse 13 and moses said unto god behold when i come unto the children of israel and shall say unto them the god of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them verse 14 and god said unto moses i am that i am now these words i am they're just common words they're just common hebrew words like if you you said to become or to exist just means you exist there's no special meaning behind these words he's just pointing out that i i've always been here i've always been and i always will be these are just common words i've always existed i've always been here i'd always be here and he said thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am hath sent me unto you the i am the existing one verse 15 now and god says a little more here and god said moreover unto moses thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel the lord god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob hath sent me unto you this is my name forever now notice he didn't say eternally because jesus gets a new name that's right but forever can be a long time right he didn't say forever he said i'm sorry he didn't say eternally he said forever but this was going to be his name this was 1491 bc right so that's uh 20 it's almost 2500 years i'm sorry 3500 years ago he still is the i am today he still is the lord god jehovah today amen as we'll see this has been his name forever thousands of years he said and this is my memorial unto all generations his name church his name is a memorial we're talking about doing a memorial for your father-in-law you know for the bang i'd like to draw a picture of your time when you came up for prayer but god said my name is a memorial my name is a constant remembrance of my character let's have let's read brother amen's memory verse since we didn't do it last week my fault isaiah 40 ver i'm sorry isaiah 41 verse 10 isaiah 41 verse 10. and uh before we get into the word of god we'll say a word of prayer let's remember jose's family they're really still battling he was you know crying back here after service just kind of telling me they you know they're still upset with the loss of armando last year so that was jose's stepson um who was killed in a landscaping accident he was i think in his 30s and just a very tragic loss but the family is still see how if we we gotta just take care of you know feelings right we gotta we gotta we gotta uh we have to ask god for peace right but that we have asked ask god for healing and grace to make it through difficult times uh and so they really need our prayers let's remember them here isaiah 41 verse 10 let's read this one together already let's read it on three one two three fear thou not for i am with thee be not dismayed for i am thy god i will strengthen thee yea i will help thee yea i will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness so let's bow our heads for word of prayer let's remember brother jose if there's any other needs on your heart let's make it known to god brother amen had a kind of unspoken request i'll pray for him heavenly father lord we're just gathered in your mighty name lord your name is a memorial your name is a place we can speak and we can go back and remember all that you are just saying the name of jesus christ hallelujah the lord god it just it's a place we can go it's a tower it's a protection it's a memorial it's a shelter lord god in the midst of the storm so we thank you hallowed be your name lord god today as we come into your presence lord may your word be exalted above all your name the exalted lord high and lifted up lord god and we ask the lord by your grace lord you to help us with these requests help jose's family to heal lord and deal with this loss and and cast all their cares upon you for you care for them lord god may he see lord such a change may the family get a victory lord may you draw them lord into your presence that whatever is uh is is creating any friction lord will be forgiven lord god and they'll be able to move past lord of course there'll always be pain but lord to be able to overcome lord whatever atmosphere is is hindering the home lord i just pray you move by the holy spirit and answer our requests for our brother and lord be with brother amen's unspoken need on the work lord on the job there lord just have your way i pray you'd have mercy i pray lord you direct everything lord god going on in the job situation that our brother can be victorious lord god overcoming by the grace of god and lord you just anoint him there lord in that uh work location jesus hallelujah uh to be an example lord of christ to them granite lord jesus and for any other needs lord tonight we just lift him up to you lord we cast our characters upon you for you care for us lord we ask these things we're making our requests known lord let the peace of the holy spirit right now lord just pass over each one of us lord may we have confidence we've made our requests known may we have confidence and keep this confidence in christ and lord we will be happy when we leave here and bless all your saints in jesus christ's name and saint said amen god bless you being seated praise god as i said i do have slides for this one this is the one that i kind of prepared for as far as put all my time into the studying here and making slides so i want to look at the names of god here and but like i said i have the subtopic this is a tremendous subject you know and i guess i'd i'd remembered it was a great subject but i was reminded of what a larger subject it was than what i thought it was i think you'll be blessed tonight and uh i trust the lord will uh speak to your heart and help you i'm just looking at my notes to make sure i don't forget anything okay yeah there was one thing i wanted to look at here just a minute i just want to have it ready to go in case i need it for the ending here all right so i hope after this everybody comes out and they have a greater appreciation for the name of god i know i have just in the last few days of studying this okay here we go all right so i am declares who i am the great i am right we know god is the great i am as we just read there in the scripture he's the one who declares what i am because we know the scripture israel did not profit from the word because they didn't mix that word with faith in other words we can hear all day long about god and what god has done but at some point we've got to accept god's word and the bible says the word of god is nigh thee even in your mouth and the bible said there's life and death in the power of the tongue right so uh we can hear the word all day all day all day which we do sometimes and it's a blessing but unless we quote that unless we take that word and put it into action it will do no good for us and so that's what this idea is all about if the i am has told us what we are then we need to speak that and believe that especially in battle we heard about this morning there's two kinds of battles right there's a passive battle and then there's a more active battle right with the sword and you're swinging the sword and you're attacking the enemy uh and so that's what i'm talking about so when we get into more active battle we've got to be speaking the word all the time how many are witnessed that if you speak the word the devil will ultimately leave it may take a little while right he'll hang around for a season but if you resist the devil he will flee and we resist him through like jesus said speaking the word it is written it is written and many times we forget you know the blessings that are pronounced over us in the word of god that we must accept and we must believe and we must stand upon so that's kind of my sub topic the i am declares who i am now i kind of got this idea this is a screenshot of my scofield bible and this is from the book of malachi so malachi there's a note uh there's the little reference note the number one uh and i just ever since i got a scofield bible back in i must have been 2008 or 2009 this picture has just always stayed in my mind every time i think about that's the power of pictures right some pictures just stay in your minds every time somebody asked me about god and the names of god i said go look in the scofield because it's it's really laid out well there now i've never preached on it because i've always known it's a it's a tremendous subject okay uh now what's helpful about this is it gives the scriptures where it's first used and we'll we'll read through actually most of these we're not gonna i'm not ready for this one this cot these compound names with l i didn't really have time to study on that one i just had time to study on these up here the primary and the compound with jehovah uh and it's something you know that we've heard many times but but it's it's important to know what they mean because it just gives us a greater appreciation of who god is and that's what these names represent remember name represents power your name represents authority so when god is revealing all these names he's showing us i have authority over this area hallelujah i have power over this area through my name right like jehovah jireh abraham said the god who provides amen in other words abraham was saying our god provides he has the authority to provide amen that makes him jehovah jireh praise god amen and so now that actually came after the fact you know so many of these early saints they had to go through great trials to learn the name but now that he's gone through it we can access that name and call on that name before we go through it praise god or as we're going through it praise god we can have that assurance that if god answered that way in the past he's still that god he still has that character he'll still act the same way he did back then amen because that's his name that's his authority that's his character praise god and so uh just keep this in mind uh uh it's a great topic and i'm just i'm just like i told amen now i'm just scratching the surface i'm really literally just scratching the surface because there's so there's so many names of god like for example if you just type in jehovah and look in the hebrew lexicon there's hundreds hundreds because some some places were called jehovah so and so right now we know there are seven redemptive names that's that's scriptural that deal with our redemption but there's also like names like uh you know like uh elijah was jehovah jehovah's are jehovah is my god or something like that i mean there's so many names that have like parts of jehovah in them right like joshua jehovah's salvation that's what it means like so jehovah is part of so many words and so many names right it's just a tremendous subject amazing subject and so i just want to start getting down into it so i kind of typed it out a little bit just to show you uh with you know to make it a little wider a little brighter so with each class there's three classes of names you have primary names which are like really proper names you have con and then two kinds of compound names so we have an english form of the hebrew equivalent that it comes from okay and so our english word god with lowercase og comes from el allah or elohim and each one has like a special definition or term okay and then lord capital l-o-r-d has a special meaning a different meaning okay so when he said when we say when we get down to lord god it means jehovah elohim okay and if you just say lord in the hebrew that just means add on or adonai just hang on just bear with me it's gonna it it's just uh it's such a deep subject i kind of i kind of feel intimidated with it but i'm just trying to make it i'm trying to keep it as simple as i can uh some subjects i really gravitate to this is one that's been kind of harder to kind of get into because i don't know hebrew right anybody here know hebrew anybody teach me a lesson on hebrew anybody teach me a lesson on greek and i don't really want to go learn greek or hebrew i'd rather say in the revelation of this message you know i'd rather stay in that but i see how it can be helpful at times but god has revealed enough to us where we don't have to be scholars right we don't have to be the scribes we don't have to be uh scribes pharisees uh lawyers we have to be that we can just be souls of like precious faith amen we just want to be believers in the name of god praise god and his character so i just put an arrow in here i could have put an arrow in each one because they all show the equivalent right uh lord god and then lord god and then lord of hosts okay and i actually didn't get the lord of hosts i kind of ran out of time there so we'll just see how far we can get by the grace of god here let me set a timer just to kind of watch my time okay so let's go through the primary names first okay we have these pride and primary names and let's look at the the word uh god yeah so we have three primary names we have god lord with capital and then we have lowercase lord or l-o-r-d like that okay all right so i've always wondered why does lord have all caps in the king james version but other versions it doesn't it's because it has a different meaning okay so let's start with the first one god now god in hebrew means el ella or elohim because each one has a different meaning now the first occurrence is genesis 1 1. in the beginning elohim created the heaven and the earth now remember moses wrote that so moses had a revelation well this was 1500 years after god had done it moses gets the vision he looks back he said in the beginning elohim created the heaven and earth now elohim means strong one in hebrew isn't that interesting they just called him strong one he's so brothers let's not think we're so strong okay because we can't compare anything to this guy this great god almighty he's much more stronger than we are right so it means strong one in the hebrew now scofield i want to try to cite i'm using mainly scofield for these it means strength or strong one l does l means strength or strong one and then allah which the muslims gonna take that right means to swear or bind oneself by an oath uh so that implies faithfulness so the strong faithful one so there are different ways you could just kind of like summarize it but the hebrew lexicon just says strong one but you can really dig deep down deep into the hebrew meanings okay so there's just a lot of different hebrew meanings and a lot of different like like a lexicon i remember i showed you the picture lexicon for one word you can have like nine different meanings for one word right and so the the scholars try to find the best meanings of the words okay so this is normally the strong one and this word god is used 2 500 times so it's a common word like either talking about god or it can be used to talk about angels this one greek word but every time it every time the translators would read it they would always put the capital g there because they knew oh strong one this speaking of our god right this is speaking of elohim this ain't speaking of some angel although they're strong but not as strong as god so see translators had quite a job didn't they i'm glad i'm not a translator you would really need the anointing of the holy ghost for translation thank god they had it too praise god uh so when you said in the beginning god in the beginning elohim the strong one created heaven and earth now the second primary name is lord with capital l-o-r-d that means jehovah in the hebrew and that means the self-existent one okay and the first occurrence is genesis 2 verse 4. these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day when look how moses now changes his name a little bit in the day when the lord god made the earth and the heavens before he was just elohim but now he's getting more specific jehovah elohim right because now he's talking about this god creating man right and man needs god to exist so in each time when this is why it's such a tremendous study you can look at every different time a name is used of god and that that will apply directly to what they needed in that time okay i'll show you some examples it's amazing so in other words whatever they needed god would provide amen and god would show another facet of his character he'd show another attribute like abraham i'm provider praise god hallelujah to each one i'm the healer right joshua i'm the savior amen i'm the captain of the lord's host with you praise god each one he would manifest different attributes right and so that's where we can see the beauty of god's names okay let me turn back here in my bible i want to get back to genesis real quick just i have a reference here okay all right so now here's a little background now lord means jehovah the self-existent one but notice jehovah is actually like a nickname a respectful nickname for yahweh yahweh is actually the most proper name of god in the old testament okay yahweh yahweh was the most sacred name so it was so sacred they they didn't want to say yahweh because they might disrespect the lord's name right just like sometimes isn't it sometimes maybe we we might not use the name jesus with as much respect as we should right and god forgive us you know especially if we use it in a joke or something may god have mercy on us and help us to always honor that hallowed name right we've got to be careful how we say the name of the lord jesus right hallowed be thy name and so they wanted to take a step well we can take a step to try to protect that holy name we'll just call him jehovah so that's what they did they just they just call him jehovah now there's a lot to this like with jehovah they first didn't have any vowels in it and it was just it was just some other word but then they added some vials to make it sound better it's so deep i mean it is so deep i can't even scratch the surface of it i'm just trying to go over this the top so you have a general understanding what's going on here okay like there it's it's so in-depth uh i've had you know remember remember brother ray brother ray he studies this he studies like the hebrew uh origins of names and he's saying things i'm like i can't it's just going right over the top i i don't know about that i'm not sure i wish i knew i don't know you know because i can't study that plus the word and preach you know or else i'd be fully into the the hebrew origins of language uh so i'm just trying to summarize it so yahweh was the most holy hebrew name so they said let's protect that let's call him jehovah that's what they did it was substituted in reverence but now scofield says the complete meaning of jehovah is the self-existent one who reveals himself okay so here let me read now it's not up here but here's what scofield says he says hava from which jehovah or is formed so that va that hova in hebrew he says that means to self-revelation i'm sorry to become or to become known thus pointing to a continuous and increasing self-revelation so god is becoming to you god is continually revealing more of himself to you hallelujah right right we love what we know about god but we know there's more right and so that's part of his name i am the self-existing one and i'm continually revealing more of myself to you now that's where denominations and even message denominations fall short they think they know all about it and they stop asking god for more revelation of himself we must not do that we must say lord i know there's more revelation there's more to you reveal more of yourself to me praise god you see the devil puts up a scarecrow and say oh well brother ram didn't use that scripture you can't use it that's a scarecrow if you've got the holy spirit it'll line up with what brother branham said amen he don't have to say every he didn't say every word in the bible he didn't preach on every sermon or i'm sorry every scripture in the bible but that's okay the holy spirit will help it line up with everything he did say that it did line up in the bible so i get criticized been criticized many times for that because i'll preach a scripture i don't have a quote for that's okay i got a quote right here for it's right from the bible praise god i might not have a brother branham quote but i got a god quote and i'll tell you that's a little more powerful than brother branham's quotes a lot more powerful amen although we need a prophet we needed a prophet the bible said we had to send a prophet a seventh church messenger right god had to send a forerunner but the the quote i end my next coming book with is a quote where brother brahma says he said if we would just put a comma instead of a period he said we'd have revelation after revelation he said revival after revival so that's the very last quote i end with the book in the book uh right now it's in the final stage i have the final copy and i'm reading through it one more time i've already found like 30 mistakes so that means before i submitted it i missed all those mistakes like bb or i forgot a quotation mark or something so i'm four chapters through i got what i got ten more chapters to go through this week but hopefully after this week i'll have it all done uh and then hopefully it'll be released end of june or early july i'm excited because i'm almost there i can see the light brother bang at the end of the tunnel how many months has it been it's almost been mercy it's been too long anyways my point is that god wants to reveal more of himself to us praise god that's his name that's who he is i'm a self-existing one and i'm going to give more revelation of myself to all those who want it not to the wise and prudent but to the babes that want to learn amen that's what he reveals himself to jesus thank the lord for that i thank you that you reveal yourself to people that want more of your revelation amen remember king uzziah got leprosy because he stopped seeking the lord as long as he sought god god bless him but as soon as he got lifted up in pride he stopped going to look in the bible for more revelation he got leprosy got lifted up in pride let us not be a usia praise god let us be a paul amen who pressed on towards the mark praise god who knew there was a crowd of righteousness awaiting him who fought the good fight and won the prize amen amen hallelujah thank the lord so this has used almost 519 times in the old testament lord so if you just type in lord god you'll find a lot of them it's a common uh reference to god it's just this lord jehovah the self-existent one so when you say lord when your prayer lord i love you you're saying self-existent one i love you see like this is the things we don't think about often right we forget that's why hebrew language is so rich right in meaning these words mean more to them because they're taught that from a young age and so that's why it's good for us to go back and learn some of that because we can remember when i pray i'm talking to the god who exists before before me after me who created time he i i'm in his hands praise god all my days are in his hands he's numbered my hairs on my head even when they fall out he numbers them he numbers them he's numbered my days he numbers my steps the footsteps of the righteous or or the lord i'm in the heart i'm in the palm of god i'm in the hand of god amen he's the self-existent one he has control over my whole life i love this okay so that's what scofield says now as i said i read a little bit of extra he said combining these meanings of hava or hova we arrive at the meaning of the name jehovah he's the self-existent one who reveals himself the name is in itself an advance upon the name of god so jehovah is an advanced form of god in other words god revealed more of himself first he was elohim the strong one but now he's the self-existent one who wants to reveal himself so god is continually revealing more of himself to his people amen hallelujah i love this beautiful see so his first attribute he revealed was i'm strong then he reveals i'm i'm self-existent and i want to reveal more myself to you that's in genesis chapter 2 church right after adam and eve were created then he reveals himself i'm the lord god oh it's glorious beautiful all right now here i got this a long time ago from brother donnie reagan i just love a few few preachers have helped me in my christian walk more than donnie reagan now there's a few things he said recently that i kind of disagree with a couple things uh but as a man of god i i couldn't be more grateful for his ministry this helped me tremendously i still listened to some of his sermons when he preached about brahm tabernacle back in 2002 i got them all on my phone brother i got five here i stand sermons i listen from time to time and man i'm like there's so much revelation on those sermons it just it really encourages me but i just want you to notice 11 times in genesis 2 moses calls god the lord god first he was only god in chapter 1 elohim but then in chapter 2 he's called lord god 11 times but when that lion devil anointed that serpent he come up to eve and said yay hath god said he took him back just to being elohim he become lord god jehovah elohim right but satan took a part of his character away he took a part of the self-existent one that wants to reveal his true nature to you in other words he started he went he deleted some of god's revelation he just called him elohim the strong one hath the strong one really said this instead of has jehovah elohim said this have the self-existent strong one who reveals more of himself he took that out and is that what satan always does he either adds to the word or takes away from it isn't that what his job is his job is in your brother tells us his job is to make you discredit the word and that can either be adding to the word taken away from the word doubting the word but look at the devil change in the name of god he did the same thing when he sprinkled with father son holy ghost right that's blasphemy amen brother preaches that in the seals he he blasphemed god's name his tabernacle and his saints in heaven amen he blasphemed the name of god by changing it from lord jesus christ to the titles father son holy ghost he is all those titles but that's not his name amen his name is the lord jesus christ amen amen and he's blasting the catholic church is blasting god's name by doing that just like satan did right there in the beginning he only calls him god elohim he leaves out his nature as jehovah oh my now the third now remember these are primary names god lord with all caps and now lord adonai i love this now the first occurrence is genesis 15 2 and abraham said lord god what will now give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eleazar of damascus notice he never been called adonai before right you can look it up in the hebrew look it up yeah you can look it up this is the first time he's ever called adonai and it came to the father of the faith so the father of the faith abraham gets the revelation that not only is he jehovah elohim he's also adonai right and adonai means master so he's saying lord master jehovah that church what does master represent well he's my ruler i'm a servant praise god i'm a slave how many love slaves we have to jesus out there how many prisoners paul said i'm a prisoner i'm a slave of christ amen in other words he's saying god jesus is my adonai praise god he's my master i'm a slave i'm a servant but it's by love i'm a bond servant of love i'm a prisoner of love amen slave to the master lies that song jackie bennett always saying now schofield says yeah adonai means master in the hebrew first time everyone anyone ever called god master as least recordings in holy writ was abraham he said adonai master elohim master elohim now this is used to express the relationship between god as master and the believer as a servant and this is another good example moses prayed this is near our text here right when he was being commissioned to take over egypt he said oh my adonai i am not eloquent see god's trying to commission him to do something and and moses says it right lord you're my adonai you're my master but i can't do it you think your master would ever ask you to do something you couldn't do not this master not the holy master not the strong master he would ask you to do something unless they'll equip you to do it praise god so moses had the right response adonai master how can i do this i want to serve you i've been waiting 80 years to serve you hallelujah i had to get 40 years beat all that knowledge of egypt out of me i've been waiting to be a real servant here now i can serve you master how can i do it i'm not able and god said who made your mouth servant and if you still got trouble i'll make aaron your prophet and you be god right the master was going to do this the master was going to set up his servant for success amen church god is setting us up to succeed amen just keep the word of god you'll be a great success hallelujah just like god told joshua you'll be a great success just keep the word of god and this is used of course many many times lord is used over and over again without the capitals okay so that's adonai you have jehovah you have adonai elohim all right now i just highlighted the ones kind of involved that we went over those are the only ones i had time as i finished up studying this morning those are the ones and now like i said the beautiful thing about a scofield bible is that he has all the references you can just go right there and you can find the notes about it and he did a lot of that groundwork okay so he did a lot of the hebrew studying the hebrew and he kind of put it into this uh wonderful bible so i just ordered a new scofield bible did didn't we get you one brother william and you got it right there came back all right went across the ocean come back praise the lord i just brought a new one but i didn't buy it from voice of god because voice of god puts that one in there i know we both have one right but this is why this is wrong i appreciate what they do but look they said may your understanding of the words written this holy book agree line for line word for word and dot for dot with the message of the hour that's heresy may your understanding of this book line up with every word brother branham said that's heresy right that's why i thought this time i'm not getting one from voice of god i'm just getting a plain one now i'm gonna miss some of these pictures in here i'm gonna miss brother brown's letter to the lord you know i'm gonna miss that i may rip that out and just put it in my new scope for the bible it's a beautiful he says dear god help me to be thy true servant i promise to teach this thy holy word and to live it as though as thou will help me to do i do believe every word in this bible to be thy word help me to live and prove it so to my generation look at these words in jesus christ's name i pray a man reverend william branham tucson arizona his unworthy humble servant my goodness isn't that beautiful now that's a real servant of god right there he didn't say lord make my tapes equal to your bible he didn't say that he said may i make this bible live and that's what he did he accomplished god answered his prayer i'll say it like that praise god but just you know just a little point there about the scofield bible now you can still get one if you want you can get one from voice of god i could just cross it off with a permanent marker right i could just do that but i thought since i'm getting a new one i'm not going to get that one this time uh just to kind of separate myself a little bit although you know i do appreciate the brothers okay so like i said i'll have to go through this uh since we have time i'm only 30 i'm only 20 minutes into this okay uh since we have time to get your bibles let's go through the seven compound names of jehovah just briefly let's just read them out of here uh you know because schofield has him right here on his notes so if you have a scofield bible he lists them right here with references that's a real help see i didn't have time to put him up there so we're just going to read them right out of here okay so the first one is jehovah jireh the lord will provide how about i get some of those readers out there some young people all right elizabeth first one hand up nature all right elizabeth can you read genesis 13 22 14 and then nature how about exodus 15 26 so genesis 22 13 and 14 elizabeth and then nature exodus 15 26 these are the first two jehovah jireh and jehovah rapha i love this as see the more time you spend with god the more you learn about his character abraham came to know him as he's my provider when it seems like there's no way he'll provide when i don't have what i need he'll provide it that's his name that's who he is that's what he does amen and if you don't product provide then i didn't need it right all right if god don't provide it then it wasn't meant for me to have it and i can live with that because i can trust the almighty god i can trust trust the self-existing one i can trust i can trust jehovah hallelujah okay so elizabeth genesis 22 13 and 14 when you're ready is amen wonderful elizabeth so see abraham caught it so here's like kind of like another memorial like we talked about this morning that's all god's army was about overcome and then remember it that's what i'm saying this morning i heard a preacher say i thought that was a good idea joshua could just be called overcome and remember that's what the whole book can be called that overcome all the enemies and don't forget about it remember how god is with you he's brought you this far he'll continue to be with you he'll never forsake you you will succeed you will overcome your invincible army glory praise god and so abraham gets this ramp he says this place is jehovah jireh right in the mount of the lord there it is jehovah in the mount of jehovah it shall be seen hallelujah that was mount moriah too that's where christ would later be crucified right there on that mountain right there god would provide himself another sacrifice amen a lamb behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world jehovah providing it providing you and i a sacrifice he did a divine exchange children praise god he exchanged our sin for his righteousness amen jehovah jireh hallelujah so in context god's providing us owns his own sacrifice okay nature uh exodus 15 26. whenever you're ready [Music] is [Music] hey man amen hallelujah so remember this is right after they come out this right after exodus right the people murmured against moses what shall you drink remember he cast a tree in the waters the bitter witness became sweet so you cat you cast the cross into any bitter situation it's going to turn out sweet right just with the cross in there mercy forgiveness sacrifice divine exchange amen just cast christ cross in any situation makes it sweet and then god said uh keep all my commandments you'll have no diseases that will stay on you for i am the lord that healeth thee for i am the jehovah that healeth thee amen jehovah rapha hallelujah so here he is he reveals himself to moses i'm jehovah rapha i like what it said earlier in the verse if you hearken to the voice of jehovah thy elohim you hearken to the voice of the self-existent one uh right the self-existent one uh thy elohim what was elohim again strong one light your strong one right hearken to the self-existent one your strong one but don't forget i'm jehovah rafa too praise god i'm the self-existent healer of all men amen no doctor can heal dr god heals amen i'm jehovah i'm the healer praise god amen and you have this revelation that i'm your healer praise god now third the third name would be exodus 17 8 through 15. to pick this up a little bit i may read some of these exodus 17 8 to 15. okay this is right after yeah right after joshua has chosen to go fight yeah this is his first battle right we preached on this a while back yeah remember they hold up uh aaron and her hold up moses's hands right and then we see down uh there in 14 and the lord said to moses write this for a memorial in a book see it's always about remembrance don't forget this don't forget what god's done and rehearse in the ears of joshua for i will utterly put out the remembrance of amloc from under heaven we just stopped there for a moment these people were constantly supposed to whisper to joshua you're strong be strong be very courageous remember when you defeated the amalekites i remember when aaron and her held up moses hands remember that don't forget that that god is with you in other words god will always do something supernatural so you can get the victory right just look up to where the man just look up to the man praise god just look up to the cross amen just look up to jesus as long as those hands are up there as long as your your faith is in god and your hands are not falling down and weary as long as you're strong you'll get the victory praise god he said write this and tell him about it over and over again that's why i like when preachers tell testimonies anybody like that when preachers i love it when preachers i love when they can put the word together but i like more when they can tell me a good testimony because i want to know that god has backed up that god's moving in their life praise god i love it i just i just pull on it till i hear one right i just say amen amen preach it until the until i get one because i want to hear what god has done for them lately praise god see because god we must remember all that he's done and that raises our faith for the current battle amen and that gives us overcoming grace now moses built an altar there in verse 15 and called it jehovah nisi which is the lord our banner so moses's hands up there was like a flag or a banner just make sure your banner's flying don't let the flag down keep your flag up keep it flying we're more than able we're conquerors amen don't let your standards down i'm talking about two kinds of standards right don't let your spiritual standards down keep it flying high keep holiness in the church amen keep the standard high keep it flying for holiness and praying for the sick and godliness keep that standard flying high i'll be your jehovah nisi jehovah your banner praise god amen thank god this is what he revealed he revealed this to joshua and moses make sure you tell joshua i'm jehovah nesi i'm your banner i'm your flag he's going to need it he's going to defeat 31 kings in the in the promised land he's going to need to remember that god is the standard praise god god is our banner god is our flag god is what we stand for he's fighting for us we're on his team praise god hallelujah beautiful jehovah nessie the self-existent one who is our banner hallelujah thank the lord now fourth this is judges 6 i'll get there real quick hopefully genesis 6 24. i think this is gideon if i'm not mistaken god be with us wherever all the miracles he said yeah yeah this is right after he meets the angel right when he's getting commissioned he hasn't defeated the midianites yet right after his commission verse 24 then gideon built an altar unto the lord and called it jehovah shalom unto this day it is yet an orpha of the aborigines i'm sorry abba herzeits sorry abba irzites now scofield said this is the lord our peace or the lord send peace okay so how did god send peace to gideon he just said if god is with us where's all the miracles right the angel comes up and said get in you're a mighty man of valor hiding behind here the threshing floor right yeah you're a pretty strong valiant man hiding behind here now i'm just kind of making it a little silly but god wasn't playing around god said you're a man of valor see many times god is telling us what we are but he's he's saying that so we'll grow into it ah church we're a we are a uh a rapture destined people we may not feel like it yet but that's what god is telling us amen we are a people by god's grace if he tarries we may escape death we're a people that will be the most privileged people that could ever be on the face of the earth amen to skip funerals and to not have to die not have to taste death but he's telling us in advance we may not be our faith may not be where it wants to be but god always does that he always calls you amen he calls you then equips you and then he strengthens you along the journey and you get the victory praise god he said you're a mighty man of valor hiding back here oh church we're mighty men and women of valor hiding in our little church out here you understand now we're not hiding away we just don't really have a lot of time to go witness but i want to praise god he's waiting for the right time and season like i said this morning just got to pray before i do it i've been kind of waiting on this book brother vang before i go i really want to have this book in hand so if they really want to know they can have it so i've been kind of waiting on this book to come out but that's what he says he says i am jehovah shalom jehovah the lord send peace the self-existent one is sending you peace how'd he send him peace he said i'm an angel hallelujah now remember then he still got scared and so he you know he did the uh he did the wolves right what are those called again the fleece there we go please i always forget that word he put the fleece before the lord he kept asking god for more signs then the last one was that dream of the bread the midnight's had the dream of the bread coming down destroying the camp see and god was just encouraging god had called and do something our church when god has called us to do something he's going to make sure we accomplish it amen but this is where god revealed himself i'm jehovah shalom i'm the self-existent one revealing himself as i will always send you peace how many had peace from god amen you mean you might not have you might not have a you weren't supposed to have peace but for some reason i just had peace right i just had peace because god sent it amen i should not have been in a peaceful state but i was in peace because god is my peace and he revealed himself as the god of peace to me praise god that's we have to remember when people get sick or people go through hard times we've got to keep the peace right we got to keep peace in our hearts and give thanks and give praise and not get scared right not get not speak uh uh anxious things right not not not not not speak doubtful things but speak faith with peace in our hearts that's jehovah shalom praise god now that's number four right yeah four five is psalm 23 psalm 23 i just list the whole chapter so yeah yeah right that's right that's david yeah one of the most famous psalms of all time the lord is my shepherd there it is okay says jehovah rayah the lord is my shepherd okay scofield says jehovah is shepherding his own who are in this world but not of the world i like that hallelujah the lord is my shepherd i shall not lack right we already saw those scriptures how there's no i'm sorry there's all spiritual blessings are given to us we don't have any reason to lack anything spiritually because we're blessed with all spiritual blessings in christ jesus are you enjoying all of god's blessings we should we should be constantly thanking god thank you god for peace thank you for this patience that i that you've given to me amen thank you for this temperance thank you for this faith that i have thank you because god is the author of this the self-existent one is my shepherd in other words he's right there watching over me all the time he's going to make sure i go to green pastures still waters me a lot to eat a lot to drink i'm going to get all the good i'm going to get everything good every good and perfect gift is sent from above right he's willing the great shepherd is willing to lead anyone to these blessings if they'll follow him and they'll just hear his voice he said if you hear my voice harden not your heart young people don't harden your heart as our brother william said today we that hard in our hearts he said this morning during a little word of the church i enjoyed that beautiful let's not harden our hearts but let us let the shepherd lead us to still waters and green pastures jehovah raya lord you're my shepherd i don't know where i'm going lord you're my shepherd you're going to leave me the right place amen see how you can put now shepherd even provides too you can put jehovah jair in there too you're going to provide for me you're my shepherd your jehovah gyra jehovah raya you're all that i need sixth now we're getting through there going pretty good here uh jeremiah 23 6 jehovah tiscanu jeremiah 23 6. not real polished up on jeremiah meaning i haven't read it recently looks like this chapter he's yeah he's rebuking the pastors at the beginning they scatter the flock and drive them away he said i'm still going to gather the remnant out of there i'll set up shepherds to feed them they'll feel no more fear no more the people won't be dismayed lacking verse 5. behold the days come say the lord that i will raise unto david a righteous branch and a king shall reign and prosper and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth in his days judah shall be saved and israel shall dwell safely and this is his name whereby he shall be called the lord our righteousness praise god jehovah tiscanu our righteousness this is concerning the future restoration and conversion of israel praise god in other words jesus came to be our righteousness jehovah the self-existent one takes our place and his righteousness is imputed to us he we give him our sins and our sorrows and all of our shortcomings we give him our sins and sorrows on the cross right and he gives us his righteousness amen fulfilled in christ amen jehovah this canoe he's my righteousness amen church after all these six what more could you want right there's heart i mean what what more could you need but there's one more seventh is ezekiel 48 35 ezekiel 48 35 last okay last verse of the chapter now if i'm not mistaken this is speaking of the millennial temple if i'm not mistaken i could be wrong on that one it's been a while since i brushed up on that one i use that language because that's what brother brown used in the seals he said i need to brush up on that russia or polish up because i need to polish it up on that one so here it is the last one jehovah shama which means the lord the self-existent one is present so verse 35 says round about 18 000 measures and the name of the city from that day shall be the lord is there oh what a millennium church like brother said don't miss the millennium whatever you do don't miss the millennium in other words whatever you do get the holy ghost amen for the rest of the dead live not to the thousand years or over but there's going to be a people that live the bible said they're going to rule and reign and they were the ones that overcame the beast they overcame the catholic church jezebel and their daughters praise god that's where i want to be i want to be where the lord is amen hallelujah where i am there the self-existent one is there amen oh my oh the millennium ah he said don't miss that that's where jehovah is jehovah shaman now remember church now we use this that's actually speaking the millennium but we use this for today because he said i'll never leave you or forsake you so that scripture is used for the physical body of jesus the millennium but we can use it as a spiritual sense because he promised he would never leave us nor forsake us right he's standing he's standing in the midst of the candlesticks you have seven candlesticks he's right in the middle of those candlesticks he said i'm with you to the end of the age in matthew 28 verse 20. so there's seven now what's interesting is jesus the eighth one fulfills all of them joshua jehovah's our salvation right which is interesting that would be eight right eight and there's eight steps to touch perfect man i just think that's really beautiful so see when people say the seven there's always eight job is our salvation right because what do the angels say what do we call them do we call jesus jehovah this canoe do we call him jehovah jireh what do we call we call him jehovah is our salvation call him joshua amen hallelujah call him yeshua call him jesus he'll save us from our sins amen in other words all those needs are rolled up in this if he saves us from his sin he'll do everything else amen he'll provide he'll be there he'll be our banner he'll be everything as long as he saves us from our sins amen hallelujah thank god there you go i've never preached a sermon on the seven compound names of jehovah till today i did it really fast now see you could take each one of those you could devote one service to each one you can show all the times jehovah provided and then start with that first one with abraham you say you see he's jehovah gyra and you see how you can do that you can just teach it right down through but i just thought i'd go through here kind of quickly okay so you can kind of see it so remember these are all the compound names with uh well i didn't get i'm sorry they're down here yeah jova sub see i never got that see there may be more than seven compound names see there could be that too okay uh so you have jehovah since we have that let's look that up real quick here uh let me turn there back to malachi i still haven't been an hour yeah i'm gonna try to do about an hour here lord willing sorry let's look up that reference thank you for your patience anybody's got a scofield bible can beat me there let me know okay it's first samuel 1 3 first samuel 1 3. don't ever feel bad about you know we're searching through the bible i've heard so many tapes of brother branham where he's searching through the bible women read scriptures he has wife read scriptures he had little kids read scriptures you know when you're just teaching going through it slowly sometimes the holy spirit will bring a thought to you gotta look it up so don't ever feel bad about that all right oh yes this is the lord of hosts all right this is jehovah's sabbath first samuel 1 3 and this man went up out of the city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the lord of hosts in shiloh that's jehovah shabbat the lord of armies amen hallelujah the jehovah of armies the self-existent one who leads armies like the captain of the lord's host and the two sons of eli hofney and phineas the priest of the lord were there the priests of jehovah were there now those are the ones we mentioned this morning they took of god's right just like ache and took of god's spoils these two took of god sacrificed the the fat of the sacrifices and the all three died these two and achan died because they took something that belonged to god all right so there you go there's at least nine right there there's at least nine jehovah's okay there could be more and i think you know honestly as i think about this i think that's maybe one reason i never preached on the seven compound names of jehovah because i looked in the scripture and i saw more now i'm i'm talking from like 10 years ago here so i'm trying to remember from 10 years ago but that's probably why i never preach it because as i started studying i found more and more jehovah names now this is kind of coming back to me right now so just uh just bear with me on that one okay let me try to bring this down to close here yeah okay so we went through that the seven compound names of the lord god jehovah elohim okay now let's go back to uh zeke i'm sorry exodus now is exodus 3. let's go back here now you actually don't have to turn there let's just so the word i am just means hey yah which means to exist or to become this is used almost 4 000 times in the bible because it just means to become to exist like if there was a scripture that said uh this man became the wife of that man or whatever you know or that woman rather whatever they became this it became that that's the word hayah so it's a very common word this is i am so god tells moses tell them i am that i am sent you right the one that is existing the existing one that's existing that's been existing right i am that i am sent me the existing one the becoming one right the one who's revealing himself now here's the actual scriptures again now i just want to bring this out just we already read it but this is my name forever right i just want to bring that out this is my name forever now look what he says but god said unto moses so this is elohim right elohim the strong one said to moses thou shalt thou say the church of israel the lord god so jehovah elohim tell them the self-existent strong one of your fathers the strong one of abraham the strong one of isaac and the strong one of jacob isn't that awesome because abraham isaac jacob we all can look at their lives and see how weak they were we could all see how many mistakes they made but god said tell them the strong one of abraham in other words the one who led abraham and gave him seed when he had no one the one that changed his body praise god i'm the god of i'm the elohim of abraham i'm the elohim of isaac isaac planted seeds in the wilderness and the bible said they should not have brought forth but they brought forth a hundredfold in the wilderness see wherever god is he just does supernatural things amen amen see now look he chose not to go down to egypt he said i'm going to plant here anyway in the famine i'm going to plant here and god gave him a hundredfold return god would have did that first daddy if you'd have stayed in the promised land praise god in other words keep god's word at all costs amen let them tease you let them make fun of you let them speak evil things you just obey god's word god is going to show up in a supernatural way isaac could have said well my dad went down i guess he's the father of faith i'll leave the promised land too i'll go down to egypt but no he had faith he had confidence if god bless abra if god blessed my dad i'm going to take a stand on god's word i'm going to stay right here i'm not going to repeat those mistakes and god blessed him that's what we got to do we got to not we have to learn from the mistakes from our past and then watch god do great things in our life praise god amen he said tell them i'm the elohim of isaac i'm the elohim of jacob has set me unto you tell the strong one this is my name forever lord god right the self-existent strong this will always be my name i'm the ex-existing one i exist by myself with my own power and i'm strong remind them tell them i am that i am that i am that strong one i am that jehovah the strong one the self-existent one see he says i am has sent me to you because god had previously said i am that i am that's got a little bit of repeat there this is a repeat i think as well tell him the jehovah elohim has sent you the self-existing strong one but look church he could prove it right god gives us all signs to prove that he's with us he could pull his hand up in bring out leprosy pull it out and made whole again see god if god sends you he's gonna give you signs he could throw down the stick and turn the serpent pick it up come back to his staff right so not only did he have the word but he had signs miracles and wonders amen that's why i love brother ryan no matter what they said about him he could stand there and tell them their address tell them what's wrong with them and say that's thus saith the lord amen he had those gifts like moses right yet he said that angel said as moses was given two gifts you'll be given two gifts he said if you can just get the people to believe the word amen the word my what a what a parallel it is right moses and brother branham hallelujah the gifts and getting the people to believe praise god now i got a few minutes here i have nine minutes until my hour so i'll try to finish up here now of course i couldn't get to everything in the old testament like i said there's there's sermons and sermons and sermons on the names of god but we just know the greatest name today is the lord jesus christ amen right we know that that's the name uh we breathe out because the bible said let all the house of israel know so all these jehovah worshipers all these yahweh this that's a real sacred name now all these sacred yahweh worshipers let them know god elohim has made this jesus god has made this joshua whom you crucified both lord and christ because jesus joshua's just a common name how many joshua's do you know i'm a schoolteacher there's a joshua in almost every class it's a common name because it's a great name right that's the english name of yeshua right so joshua's of jesus is a very common name so peter had the keys he said you got to recognize this is more than just a man he was crucified but god raised him from the dead he is both lord and christ he is joshua he is jehovah's our salvation but he's more than that there you go glory so scofield remember now scofield says the word jesus is the greek form of the hebrew name jeshua yeshua okay so we're actually saying the greek word joshua when we say jesus that's actually a greek word we're actually saying the greek word like the word trinity in the greek i think it's trinitas if i'm not mistaken or is that latin help me out latin people is it trinitas or you guys remember okay yeah i appreciate that yeah i just read the chapter this week that's why i was fresh on my mind so instead of we're saying the word trinity if we were just saying the the word we just say trinitas the holy trinitized that's what we'd say but that's kind of what we're doing for greek of course we know it's unholy trinity right you know i'm not trying to support the trinity it's of the devil thus saith the lord so i'm not trying to don't ever think i'd say that uh but jesus is like saying the greek is actually the actual greek word jesus okay now here's what i want to get to the word lord he said jesus this joshua is both lord and christ lord is curios which the is the greek word for lord or master and some scholars say that's the same word they use for adonai in the greek so they said let israel know this jesus is actually adonai hallelujah amen the same one that they recognize abraham said adonai he's the master amen he's the lord jesus is the master amen he's your master from the old testament that's what the holy spirit told brother adam jesus in the new testament is jehovah of the old amen hallelujah i'm having a good old time today raise that he said let him know he's both curios adonai and he's christ now christ means christos in the greek which means the anointed let them know this is the anointed adonai this is the anointed joshua i don't know i guess i'm trying to put them all together it's the uh adonai who's anointed he's our joshua and this is equal in the hebrew to messiah because messiah means the anointed one so christ and messiah mean the same thing okay so he's not just joshua he's the anointed one to come who's adonai as well oh how many can say amen to that see that no he's more than joshua he's more than just jesus right he is adonai he's master of the universe amen he's the master of heaven and earth praise god come down the word was made flesh among us and he's the anointed messiah that was to come and the bible said he's far above all principality power might and dominion every name that is named not only in this world but also in that which is to come church anytime you're in you're in need call upon the name of the lord jesus christ call upon that holy name this name is far above all other names right because you got jehovah in there jesus means jehovah you got jehovah adonai right you got the anointed messiah the anointing he's got the anointing praise god he's got the power he's got the holy spirit praise god amen call on this name for it's far above any other name we could say 9-1-1 call me up please come please please club but it's better to call on jesus right i mean we thank god for the 9-1-1 but what i'm saying is this is the name that's far above all of them this is the first name we should breathe this is the first power this is the first authority we should go to is the name of the lord jesus christ wherefore god has also highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name the anointed adonai master jehovah's our salvation self-existent one who's constantly revealing self for salvation that's the lord jesus christ that at the name of jesus joshua every knee shall bow jehovah is our salvation of things in heaven things on earth and things under the earth now here's what i want to close i just want to close with this a few thoughts here this is why it's so important a few weeks ago i was kind of praying and uh and i was just confessing what god said about me about you in the bible right i was just in prayer and it really encouraged me for a number of days i've been encouraged since then so i haven't had to do that you know but just praying for other people and things but i just started i heard this sermon about that i was like wow the ims what am i i know what god is now what am i praise god but jesus said verily everlasting to you before abraham was i am this is why they picked up stones to stone them because he's saying this man is saying he's jehovah this man is saying he's the lord god that met abra or that met moses he's making himself equal with god and jesus never apologized it and church he never even explained it he said if you can't believe me believe the works amen hallelujah he didn't explain he didn't have a lesson on well here let me teach you hebrew he didn't go through that he said look at the works he said no they said no man can do this except god except elohim the strong one be with him amen he said before abraham was i am now here i like this too see so constantly brother branson it was kind of like a dual personality he said sometimes jesus flesh would speak other times god would speak right philip said to him lord show us the father and it's the fight that says in other words show us elohim right show us god show us adonai show us jehovah and jesus said have i been so long time with you and yet thou has not known me philip look at that he said show us the father he said i've been here this whole time see because the father was made flesh right adonai was made flesh jehovah was made flesh elohim was made flesh he says i've been here you haven't even seen me he that has seen me has seen the father and how sayest thou then show us the father i love how jesus when he's asked questions he'll often ask them a question right he'll bring it back what do you say what are your thoughts let me ask you this he's constantly trying to get them to think and understand what are they really trying to say he said believe us thou not that i am in the father the father and me the words that i speak unto you i speak not of myself but the father that dwelt in me he do with the works now lord willing i'm going to preach on the god head pretty soon but remember this is what they they're so trinitarians are so dogmatic this is what they believe they believe two separate persons live in one person because jesus said the father dwelt in me but the bible said the spirit abode in him they believe two gods live in one god if jesus is fully god why does he need another god to come live in him and the church said why if he's fully god why is he the father he shouldn't he should be god right but they there's my hour so i'll try to close here in a moment but see they get so confused and they can't explain it they just say well that's what we believe that's what the giants of the faith taught the giants of the faith wrote the bible praise god and the giants of the faith never caught in three gods or three verses he said jesus christ is the invisible image of the person of god amen he is adonai made flesh amen he's the image of jehovah he's the image of elohim made flesh he said have i been this time i've been here three and a half years and you haven't seen the father i love how he humbles everybody humble me lord humble me the father the dwelleth in me he do with the works church if god if god comes in our generation this is going to be fighting words they're going to want to kill us when we say trinitarians of the devil do you understand they're not killing they're not really upset yet but if we if god comes in our day they're going to get upset and they're going to kill us but jesus said because you kept the word of my patience i'm going to keep you from the hour of temptation that cometh upon the whole world these are going to become fighting words pretty soon oh you're a trinitarian you're a charlatan you're i'm sure you're not a trinitarian you're a charleston you're a heathen you're a you're a heretic let them call them whatever they want just like i read this morning paul's right paul said i i'm not they can't prove what they're accusing me he said but this one thing the way that they call heresy so i worship the god of our fathers believing everything that is written in the prophets amen i believe this whole book from cover to cover and it never says he's three persons he's one person amen yeah that's right i do worship by the way they call heresy but really it's orthodoxy praise god we're really the real orthodox christians because we just keep all the word of god but if this happens in our day if this move of hating jews keeps going like it's going and this move to worship uh this move to worship homosexuality and and all these things if this keep moving they're gonna hate us pretty soon if it happens in our day what do we got to do we got to pray for those who persecute us right bless those who persecute us pray for those who despitefully use us we have to be trained for that right now i'll tell you youtube has trained me for that because every week i get criticized and so you need to stop preaching and you need to sit down who are you to correct william branham i'm like i'm not corrected with you brandon it's the holy spirit corrected william branham william branham's he's a prophet of god but he was a man and when he makes mistakes if the holy spirit's here he's going to correct the mistake it ain't me it's the holy spirit praise god but if you want to worship the tapes go ahead you can worship the teeth you shouldn't you shouldn't worship the tapes you should listen to tapes not worship them my mercy i was just trying to think of some of the things they called me this week the lowest human on the earth and you're going to be preaching i mean all kinds of things sit down and shut up they told me all kinds of things that just makes you want to preach harder they're just stirring me up to preach harder against it to blast all that oh yeah and if you don't know i got a video i shared with william and i shared with jose i got a video of of the actual auto recordings of billy paul and joseph sharing their false doctrine it's not public but it's it's available with the link so if you want to hear some of the things they say i took me three hours to i did two saturdays ago it took me three hours to get that thing done to go research it put it all in there line up all the audio that was hopefully that was three hours well worth it if that just posed one person out of idolatry that three hours was a huge blessing because i've already had people tell me oh this is a blessing thank you but it's not public right it won't be on there on your scroll list on youtube right won't come up there but you have to reach it by us a special link okay now let's just go through this let's give me five minutes here let me set that should it take me five minutes my wife's laughing there okay give me ten now look i am church i am what the i am says i am because jesus christ is the i am made flesh if he says something i am that's what i am but the first and most important thing is i am nothing without the i am that's the most important thing if we catch nothing else tonight catch that we are nothing unless the i am has mercy on us i think that's my last slide yeah that is my last slide so i'll keep that up there um so i didn't have time like i said i didn't have as much time as i wanted to go through this but that's okay i i hope you guys try to give you the bulk of the message like the main thought so here's what i was praying lately i am nothing without jesus christ working through me as is written in john 15 verse 5. so that means i am only doing good things if christ is working through me i am a blessing only if i yield to the i am everything else no matter how much money how much property how many buildings i could build or whatever how many awards i could earn that's nothing unless christ is with me now let me go through a few of these here i got three minutes left i am blessed with all spiritual blessings as is written in ephesians 1 verse 4. i am you are because the i am said so and if he says it it's going to come to pass i am our i am a partaker of his divine nature i am a partaker of faith virtue knowledge temperance patience goddess brother kindness charity i am a partaker of all those i am because the i am said i am i am beloved because in romans 9 god said i'm going to take up people gentiles that were not beloved and i shall call them beloved hallelujah that makes me want to cry amen hallelujah i am beloved well amen somebody loves me i know you do buddy but somebody greater than you loves me i know everybody loves me here i love you too but what i'm saying is that i'm loved by the i am i'm greatly loved by the i am ephesians 2 says i am love with great love the bible says with his great love he has loved us amen i am greatly loved sister amen brother i am greatly loved i am quickened by the holy ghost amen because the bible says i am i am loved by christ because he gave his life for me on the cross i am inseparable from the love of god according to romans chapter 8. 10 things cannot separate me from the love of god amen see all that beloved thing i was telling you about see there's 10 things that can't no none of those 10 things can separate me because i'm so beloved and church i ain't bragging i'm just being rejoicing here tonight you ought to be rejoicing too right you are god's beloved amen and nothing can separate you from his love i am favored by god because my enemies don't triumph over me as is written in psalm 41 i am more than a conqueror in christ according to romans chapter 8 i am a secret prayer warrior who secretly fast gives alms and secretly prays because that's what jesus said in matthew 5 and six right isn't that what you are i'm an alms giver i'm i fast i am one who fasts if i'm trying to use grammar i am one who prays in secret that's who i am because i am said i am i am a war i'm aware of the full armor of god i got the whole thing i got all the armor of god i'm not lacking anything i'm a possessor of all god's weapons and defenses for no weapon formed against me brother william shall prosper because i'm fully equipped i am equipped with it because the i am said i am i am saved by grace not by works see you can make it you can make this go on forever i must i am a seeker of god first and i am a seeker of his righteousness i am a hot believer i'm not cold or lukewarm and i am anointed with i sound so i can see the word of god i am there's my ten minutes there's my five minutes i am a king and priest unto god let's stand because i better stop right here i'll keep i'll finish this thought i am a powerful witness because jesus said when the holy ghost comes on you you'll be a witness unto me church that's what i said when i bought that jesus hat remember i've been telling you for weeks i said i just want to buy this so someone will talk to me about jesus and that's why mj's come the last two weeks i said i can't wait for somebody to ask me and i was ready for it right there he said i love your hat he said that made my day i said how could i not wear this hat when jesus christ healed my mama cancer and he looked right across and there's people all there in the chipotle line he said jesus just delivered me from homosexuality and the people are looking over laughing like this i'm like glory praise god hallelujah so i went come back to the church i got in my book and gave it to him he said he said the holy spirit just told me not to wear tight clothes and your book says don't wear tight clothes he said did god tell you tell you to give me this book i said not with the audible voice just in my heart see i want to be a witness under akron green and wherever so ever the lord o god will call me the lord our god will call me i'm a witness i am crucified with christ and i no longer live praise god amen i am not living for myself in other words i am supplied with all my needs for my god shall supply all my needs according to his riches in christ jesus couple more i am talented with at least one talent of the holy spirit jesus said you at least got some got five some got two some got one you at least have one talent church we should say that sometimes i'm talented now god help me to use it you everybody has something here some talent god i am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous that's why i don't need makeup right i'm fearfully and wonderfully made i don't need anything else added that's why i don't need tattoos because i'm already fearfully wonderful man i'm the temple the holy ghost i'm god's dwelling place i am forgiven of every sin hallelujah i'm forgiven of every wrong that i've ever done i am because the i am said i was forgiven of all my sins he said i've forgiven all your trespasses i am surrounded by god's presence because he said he never leave me and he'd never fail me i am strong and very courageous i am growing from faith to faith from glory to glory i'm going up levels in the anointing of god i am excited about the future because god told me if i seek his face with all my heart i'll find him musicians can come see how you could just go on and on every promise this could be like an unending list of six thousand or eight thousand promises i am all these things how many feel encouraged that god has revealed more to you about himself tonight let's pray here let's ask the lord god adonai to just bless us here as there's any other needs on our hearts as we bow our heads is
