[Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Sunday nights and then I look at the open door just through the scripture so I will look at through the quotations three verse seven it's good to see Helen tonight let's give her a round ball graze God guy that's your head yeah how are you doing praise the Lord amen well god bless you well I could talk to you afterwards Oh Paul's well by the grace of God revelation 3 verse 7 we look at the open door tonight by God's grace but as we said we looked in all the New Testament Scriptures on the open door on Sunday night and let's show what the Prophet talked about it as well but let's see where the Lord Jesus mentions it here in chapter 3 verse 7 and 8 for there say Amen I'll read verse 7 that we can all read verse 8 and to the angel the church in Philadelphia write these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth let's begin on three one two three I know thy works behold I have set before for thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name every thankful for the strength of God how many have kept the Word of God praise the Lord let's have a word of Prayer one more Heavenly Father we love you thank you for your word we've kept the word Lord by your grace we have strength o God today and we have more than a little strength we have Holy Ghost strength dear God hallelujah the joy of the Lord is our strength tonight thank you Lord Jesus father to speak to us through thy word Lord and courage those that are discouraged heal those that are sick Oh God Lord bring more joy to those who are joyful Lord Jesus we meet every need here tonight Lord only you can do it we're trusting and you all of our faith is in the Lord Jesus so we give you praise honor tonight and minister to us by your spirit in Jesus Christ's name when the saints said Amen god bless here's a CD dear praise God Malakai you can switch over when you're ready let's look at part six tonight by God's grace we've been looking at the Philadelphia Church age John Wesley the messenger and it's from 1703 and 1791 this is part six of the Philadelphia and church age is part 46 in the series so it just makes me happy that God has given us that many sermons and he's given us a great understanding because member the Prophet said we have to understand this before we can understand the seven seals before he can understand the seven trumpets and the seven vials and the three woes and all these things which we'll get to by God's grace you know last year I was led to the Holy Spirit I believe to ride out a whole entire script on the whole entire book of Revelation so I wrote about 35 pages single-spaced on the book of Revelation and I brought out all the symbols brother Ram taught and the timeline for the whole chapter so I'm making videos right now on our YouTube page I'm stalled out on chapter 6 I got chapters 1 to 5 done I stalled out on 6 because I've been so busy lately but I have all the scripts and all the scriptures ready for chapter 6 all the way to 22 and I'll probably preach that after I get done here with the church ages we'll see what the Lord allows but I hope you've been blessed by the church ages it's so crucial it's not optional it's necessary it's been essential that we preach this amen and every believer knows that praise God so our text there the last Sunday we looked at the open door through the scripture I'm gonna show the same slide I finished with on Sunday night so according to the New Testament there's the following open doors in the New Testament I found a three four or five I found six open doors in the New Testament the first one is the opened order in the Philadelphia Church H for the missionary efforts that were given and that's what we read tonight we'll look at part of that tonight the second one we looked at on Sunday night was the open door for the Gentile dispensation in other words after the Jews close the door on Christ God opened the door of faith to the Gentiles if they're gonna reject me I'll open the door for the Gentile the Gentiles can come unto me and by the way I'm called it or the Pentecost experience hallelujah there's also open doors for local ministries like Troas remember Paul said God opened the door and trow as the City there that's where Eutychus was healed after he fell out of the second story building and died God raised him up right there intro as amen hallelujah amen then there's the open door to heaven by vision which Saint John the Prophet experienced so that's the open door to heaven and remember that was a type of the rapture so church I believe one of these days the door of heaven is gonna open for the bride of Jesus Christ and she's gonna take a rapture to the sky that was a vision to the rapture a vision open door to heaven what about the actual open door to heaven which is the voice right the shout voice I'm sorry which is the Trump the trumpet of God amen hallelujah fifth the open door Jesus says you must have an open you must open their hearts door so you must have an open door heart response that's requested by Christ this is the open or we must have we must open our lives and say Jesus take take control of every one of my rooms every part of my life take control my mornings take control my lunch breaks take control of my church attendance they control my money they control my attitude take control my sincerity take control of my family you got a Lord take control for all my entire life I give you the doors I give you the keys and lastly we saw this was striking the open door that's gonna be requested by the those that are left in the tribulation period we would say we'll call them make believers the make believers are gonna try and knock and get through the open door but Jesus is gonna say sorry the rapture is already gone I never knew you so we must make sure that our soul is sealed if our soul is sealed then we'll hear his voice when he calls us we must listen for the voice if so many people are listening for other voices instead of listening for the voice of the rapture praise God there listen to so many other things listen is jesus gonna call my name it could the rapture come tonight they're trying they're excited to listen to every other thing other than that sweet voice of the rapture amen but that's be listening for the rapture praise God now the problem there's a new quote I've never read to you before so you can't say you you've heard me preach it before sometimes I review I'm not reviewing tonight real that was my well I'm sorry that was my review from Sunday but the truce now I'm gonna read a quote from the Sunday morning of that week of December 1960 when the prophets spent every day preaching on the seven churches I'm gonna read a quote from the Sunday morning if you know Saturday night the Prophet preached on the Philadelphia Church age so he preached on the Philadelphia Church a Saturday night Sunday morning he makes this statement about the great revelations that were marvelously preached and revealed to our hearts made real to us through the Philadelphia Church age here's what he says now tonight we're gonna have the you talk about Sunday tonight we're gonna have the great final age of this layer of seein so Saturday night the Prophet preached Philadelphia Church H Sunday morning you preached the ten virgins 144 thousand and then Sunday night that week he preached the latest in church age so he said tonight we're gonna have great final age greater this later see him last night we took the Philadelphia Church age and come into the beginning of the later seen age and the lap over and then them great mysteries that God began to reveal to us between those ages the open door so did you know tonight I'm preaching a great mystery to you how many are hungry to hear by God's grace how many want to hear a great mystery I'm preaching to you tonight a great mystery not my words your prophets words so you got to come here with an open heart you got to be gotta have a positive attitude you got it because the Word of God is always positive he said so this is a great mystery the open doors a mystery a little strength is a mystery the thought on kept my word is a mystery and you have my name as a mystery he said all those little things in there how God did so Marva Slee make them real to us to which we are very very thankful oh I hope somebody leaves her tonight very very thankful hallelujah because that's what the Prophet said when God revealed to him he he and the people were very very thankful I hope you're thankful to come to church praise God so let's get ready so I'm telling you get ready for the great mystery of the open door to reveal to your heart Marvis lee tonight let here yeah that's what the Holy Spirit do reveal God's Word to us now remember the prophets spent most of his time on the truth of the open door from the sermon 1962 Philadelphia Church H we're gonna go through quotes about or sorry from the 1960 sermon about the power of Jesus Christ and the open door now here's the first thought the Prophet gives on the open door and now the age of the church age of the brotherly love the great missionary age and the open door age and the reward was a be made a pillar and the revelation was three names the name of God the City of God and God's new name is the revelation that was given to this church in this age now the great missionary age really loved the age of missions let me just name to you some of the great men I wrote their names down John Wesley George Whitefield Charles G Finney Dwight Moody William Carey the great missionary that went to India in 1773 David Livingstone to South Africa see although some of these great men I got names of plenty of them here great men that lived in that brotherly love the black man the white man the brown man the yellow man all walls was broke down and these men went out into the mission fields he said brotherly love stretching out a hand to all nations everywhere and it was opened up to them that they could go another door age I'm sorry another open door age because they couldn't before that they couldn't have done it the papal and the papacy of Rome and so forth had it also closed up till they couldn't go but in that age the doors was open because he said it was an open door age so we're talking about this age right here from 17 was in 1703 the 1906 this age before this the papacy had closed the doors to certain countries you couldn't get in they had control by the politics and by the religion but in this age the Philadelphia Church age right here these 156 years from this church age God supernaturally opened the door for the missionaries to get into every country amen so remember Martin Luther was born here that was his life span John Wesley was born there and that was the age of the Philadelphia Church age the open door of course we have our prophet lived this age brother Branham now the our temptation remember was previously we'll get to that later now they opened up many doors during that age the door to the gospel the door to the mission fields the door back to Christ and everything was opened up during that age and you can see what they did the brethren done a great job out of it and from John Wesley the star after the Sardis age after he come over waking them up from the Sardis age from the past 150 years great missionaries like of no other time or age has covered the entire earth think of that now listen to what he says here every nation under the heavens has heard the word it completed many many years ago see but not the gospel just the word the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so the Prophet said during the Philadelphia church age during this church age right here the missionaries went around the world and every God every nation hurt or got to read the Word of God today look at today almost every nation has some form of Christianity whether it's latter-day saints in it right or whether it's the Roman Catholic Church every nation under heaven has got that least hear the Word of God or have the Word of God but according to the prophet of God not every church has had not every country has had the power of God sorry try to get past that I'm gonna go back to this every nation under heaven has heard the word it completed many many years ago but not the gospel just the word now next time we're gonna look at this in that sermon the prophets spent about half an hour telling us the testimonies of power of the word of God the word is just the word in the Bible form but the power but the gospel is when this word starts living in your life praise the Lord how many ever seen a genuine miracle before the genuine miracle was the power of God that was not the word that was the gospel I do yeah that's what the prophets teaching us there's a difference between the word and the gospel the word is used to you and I pass in tracks how many believe in passing tracts I believe that that's just the word that's just the word but the gospel is when that word lives and there's supernatural miracles by the preaching of the word every nation has had the word but not every nation has had the power or the gospel praise God exactly right and Jesus said every nation must hear the gospel before he comes back to the earth that's why we need missionaries to go over and take the gospel not the word only but the gospel praise God the power of the gospel in church I believe we don't see enough power we don't have enough power in our lives because we're not sincere enough because the Prophet says sincerity brings power if you're sincere tonight then power can go to operating in your life a men but it takes sincerity and you know I've got to be careful all preachers everybody's got to be careful we always we can criticize others for lack of power in their lives but what about our life we can see in other people's lives it's easy to see well there's no power in that person's life but what about our life we're the ones that got a checkup what about the RAM say the log that rots the fastest is the one sitting in the water are you with me then the prophets say that which log if you ever log up on the grass or log in the water which one's going to rot the fastest the one in the water so which which people are going to get spiritually lukewarm first the people and the message of the hour or the people out there on some dead ground it's the people near the message of the hour Leuven if we don't keep on fire with God we're the ones that will write the fastest how many ever seen that in any church before message Church anybody seen a message Church the ones that get tired on God the fastest the ones that get discouraged with God the ones that give up with God the fastest are the ones in the message churches because the power of God is there but they're lacking sincerity amen hallelujah they'll come to church maybe for a while maybe for a long time they'll come to church when they go home they forget all about the preaching of the word but that's not hearing the word if you heard the word you take that word home with you didn't James say if you stare at a mirror and forget what you are then your gospel is in vain your religions in vain in other words if you come to church here what you are and then forget what your are what you are what you're supposed to do then you didn't hear a single word the preacher said that night or that morning and the church said Amen if we don't apply what we've heard we didn't hear anything we just sat and listened and tried to stay awake hallelujah that's exactly right if we don't apply what we've heard to our lives we didn't hear nothing it's exactly right and if we don't confess our sins we'll never have faith because we must confess our sins first then we can have faith and perfect love casts out all fear even though we know the love of many shall wax cold we should expect that people are gonna get colder and colder and colder but let them get cold you and I got to stay on fire you have to stay on fire I have to stay on fire you've got to keep your fire strong for Jesus that means you got to feed on Jesus when you're at home when you're driving the grocery store you got to feed on the word you got to fill your heart and mine when you're cooking supper like well I don't cook supper all the time but when I do I do this and to Jesus at work you got a feast on the Word of God amen you got a every break you'll have you you got to make sure as much you can stay on the Word of God this is why there's a lack of power that's why the word just becomes the word instead of the gospel the power to change your life amen it's got that power we got to pray down the blessings of God people's prayer life takes a stumble well no wonder there's no power you got to pray you got to be in contact because memory read the court on Sunday you got to pray first then the revelation comes you got to get in the spirit first then the Word of God starts acting I talked to numerous people they said well Jess you know when I first got saved I saw so much supernatural and now I don't see nothing and you look at their lives and they don't pray anymore they don't come to church like they do there no listen to the Prophet they don't read their Bibles well what it makes perfect sense because one plus one is always going to be two amen two plus two is always going to be four if you put the sincerity in if you confess your sins if you pray down God's blessings if you ask God for revelation then God's gonna pour it out for you amen but it's about our choice to see do we want the word or do we want the gospel we've got to have both amen but we got to have power hallelujah emember Holy Ghost evidence the Prophet said is we're in the word all the way and people say they're in the word but don't want to hear more preaching something's wrong with that experience that's right because when you got the Holy Ghost you love the Word of God and you want to live all of it amen and you don't get upset with preachers you love preachers amen just like the preachers love the people of God amen it's exactly right people don't have the Holy Ghost if they're not in every sermon they're not in every word they don't want to read their Bibles they don't want to feast on God's Word how can they have the Holy Ghost they can't because the Holy Ghost feeds on the word amen glory the Lord willing I'll preach the next message on that the word vs. the gospel and I'll break down some of these quotes and bring out more closer brother Branham what he said now the next the profit breaks into this thought now this is the thought that I never saw before so this is brand new to me I've never preached this to you so you can't say you already preached out before brother yes this is brand new and sometimes it's good to review because we have new people here and they need to hear it by God's grace and we have young people that don't understand it yet you know so we it's good to go over these things and I just try to do it as I'm led by the Holy Spirit as I'm led right by the Holy Spirit by God's grace and I did not plan as I studied and prepare today I did not plan to bring out this thought this thought just came out as I listened to the message and read it over again by God's grace now I said now watch the time coming now after the great missionary move I swept across the nations umbrella love to make what they had I'm sorry to take what they had nothing against of literature and whatever more into the different parts of the world now the church denomination had gone back to education and works again see gone back after the great denomination been set up Jesus set an open door after the Wesleyan age had come in and the Methodist Church had been established in the earth taking roots growing making a great big church which it is today when the greatest of them among the Protestant churches at that time the thing that took place then was Jesus and an open door for the church before they entered the Laodicean Church H so I want you to see that Jesus opened the door before they entered the legacy in church age the reason I'm saying this this way so you can see what I mean by the lap over see it's from the missioner age of the open door but you see he had told them he had the key of David now remember what's the key of David the key on the shoulder represents the responsibility that Christ has over his bride the key of David the key of David was on his shoulder the key the government will be upon his shoulder and he said the key of the David part represents Jesus as son of David so Jesus tells them I've got the key of Dave and I got responsibility for my bride and I'm taking her into the millennium amen but here he said he had set before the church now after that age of the missionary Whitefield and all those finis Sankey moody and down come down to now he said an open door before the church oh here's what you have to watch now it's just in between the Philadelphia and the latest seen aged the lap over now catch this he makes a statement here I want to bring out now I set before this church between the Philadelphia age and later CH an open door oh do you get it now and got your thinking caps on real good listen now this is good I tell you it's honey in the rock just getting the Nuggets out and shine them up I and the door to the sheepfold so brother Ram ties two scriptures together he ties I'm going to open the door for you in Revelation 3:8 he ties it in with john 10:7 where jesus says i am the door and brother Ram said this is honey in the rock amen glory this is a golden nugget I'm shining up the golden nugget to scriptures Jesus opens the door and Jesus says I am the door he puts them together and said now you've got honey in the rock does that taste sweet to you Church that sweet is that sweet like honey to you to know that Jesus is opening the door and he is the door and the word is the door and Christ is the word and you've received the word I hope somebody's got some sweetness in their mouth tonight and I'm talking spiritual honey to eat that's all that's all Holy Ghost Hill Christian needs he needs one part of the Bible to interpret the other part amen you don't need anything outside of the Bible the Bible interprets itself because the Holy Ghost wrote the Bible amen and it does not contradict itself that's what the prophet called hunting the rock you can listen to it if you want he said on the door to the sheepfold what is that door that was set now let's go back in our minds from that great missionary age in the Methodist that swept through the country with the message of sanctification Luther through justification Wesley come along with message of sanctification at the end of the Methodist age the end when it took roots and begin to come to great organization and when any church listen that's strong but I want someone to show me anywhere through the gleanings of history any church that God ever raised up come up the Pentecost away without any organization and as soon as it organized it died and never raised again Helen could be a good witness of this and so could us that no history any Church had ever had a revival and started a new church never came back to a revival they've all died I with me they've all died look at the ones we've seen in our day there's been different revivals that have happened around the United States what's that one down in Florida there's that Brown Street movement you remember that in the 1990s I was a teenager when it happened some people there and some city in Florida I think it was Browns some Brownsville City or something they had a speaking in tongues revival where's that revival today it's died out all's it was was just more speaking in tongues it wasn't a real genuine revival right because it never produced holiness it was just producing gifts but we're not interested so much in gifts as we are they giver because if we got the giver we'll get gifts amen when you deaf when you definitely have the giver you'll have definite gifts if you have people that are sincere with the giver amen but you got we got to be sincere we got to want the gospel and the word we got the word and the gospel we got our power when it takes sincerity it takes two sincere dedicated walk to Christ see more people are more want to be more dedicated to Amazon or Netflix than they want to be to Christ Jesus they're more faithful to Facebook or Instagram and checking their phone and checking all their computer things and websites than they are to the Word of God it's exactly right and that's why there's no power there's just word but there's no power amen see its lacking its lacking he says he says this any Church God ever raised up never have a revival he says oh the membership went on but they never had a revival show me a revival in the Lutheran Church today show me a revival in the pet and the Pentecostal church or the Methodist Church show me a revival where people are hungry for God and they'll spend more time at church than the Ohio State football game this Saturday show me where they're so hungry for God well they'll feast on the Word of God and they can't hardly get enough of the Word of God show me a people like that and then you'll see a revival see how you were struggling to have revival do you see that we have to be a church that has revival and keeps the revival going how do you get revival the Prophet says start praising him he said we lavish with your praise praise the Lord Jesus Christ worship Him be a true worshiper you see there it's not a rocket science science or something like that it's a simple basic gospel truth that we need to lay to heart praise God they organized which God said in other Church ages hates the thing the doctrine of the Nicolaitans I just drove by a Methodist Church yes a Methodist Church right there in Norton and they have a sign that says God is still speaking come into our church but it's a rainbow sign which means homosexual and it's got the homosexual flag on it God is still speaking Church that shows the nomination are not have a revival God's not speaking there if they've denied the Word of God Jesus the Spirit is not preaching from that pulpit it's now the Antichrist spirit are you with me Church they can't have revival because they've denied the Word of God now let's look at our lives are we denied any word of God if we are that's a reason there's no revival if we're obeying the word our lives are in revival amen see God hates the nomination he hates it he hates when the the people are conquered he wants the people to be on fire he wants his people to be free he wants his people to have the holy spirit move upon them he wants them to be excited about the Word of God we should be all of us should be not just me not just you all of us should be excited about the Word of God amen everybody should have a revival he said now remember we're not talking against anybody the good people are scattered God's got sheep and all them places out there where did you where did God find you which denomination to God finds you in God has sheep in every Church hallelujah see we're preaching against the system right and I'll say like this we're preaching against the Serpent's seed although we don't know which ones they are but we are preaching against them if you understand what I'm saying we don't know which ones we don't know individuals but we're preaching against their Antichrist spirit and their Anti Christ doctrine and their false teachings and all these things like that but God's got sheep in every one of them amen that's true that's right methods Baptist whatever there are they're God's people if they're born again of the Spirit of God they're God's people but the organization has cramped them down and packed letter for Methodists the Baptist to camel light and so forth - they wore the letters out just packing from place to place they wore their membership papers out all right how the Lord said now in the end of the age I am the door to the sheepfold now stay with me here stay with me this is all building to where I've never preached these thoughts here now what door was opened about Jesus just between those two ages he's talking about Philadelphia and Laodicea 1906 about when the Methodists age and Dwight Moody in them faced or faded from the scene there come forth the breaking forth the people receiving the Holy Ghost speaking with tongues and things he says come back into the church that's about right in 1906 along and there all right what took place then after that begin to come along the first thing you know they organized in the old General Council which went in now called the Assemblies of God see out of that church that was left over and what taken place then he said an open door an open door alright now let's read this here I want to just try to stop right there let me read that again by God's grace I want to make sure I go over that you're gonna see it he gives a few different ideas about the open door in the Philadelphia Church age and the Laodicean Church age so I'm gonna be dead again so there was a revival in 1906 I remember the Sousa Street revival in California I remember that it was a revival but the first thing they did the first now these were the ones that were not right with God the believers there that were not right with God organized and made a denomination right but the Prophet said out of that was taken the open door so in other words as soon as they denominated that move of God Jesus made an open door for the true believer and that's what the Prophet brings out here now he quotes the scripture I know that works behold I've set before thee an open door and no man can shut it open door what was it it was the revelation of the supreme deity of Jesus Christ not being a second person of the Trinity but being God Himself made flesh and dwelt among us now if you notice just a minute let's just read that again shut it as little strength as not denied my name so look at this here I show this again let me show it one more time to show you what the Prophet says about it we have Luther he said there was an open door and did I do the right now okay so there's an open door he said right here the name of Jesus and the supreme deity of Jesus was an open door after they denominated there then Jesus opened the door for his name and for the supreme deity to understand Jesus that he is God amen he said that's the first time the names been spoke of now since back in this age back there when he lost his name I remember the Thyatira church age the fourth church age the Prophet said he lost his name because it was the darkest age they stopped using the name Jesus Christ and they adopted that wrong speed father son Holy Ghost right I saw somebody do it yesterday at our school they were praying for their food like this I thought oh lord have mercy and then they said we're not Catholic and I thought oh my well they've adopted Catholic ways right and Luther came out with a name that he was alive but he was dead remember the Sardis Church age they still didn't have the name in the 5th church age so the 4th church age which was remembered not over 900 years long they didn't have the name of Jesus and the sixth age Martin Luther didn't have the revelation name of Jesus but here I'm sorry the fifth age but in the sixth age at the end of it Jesus says that I'm going to open the door and I'm gonna give you the revelation of my name and also the revelation of Who I am amen hallelujah remember this quote now this is review - I preached this a few weeks ago remember the Prophet brought out the use of the name of Jesus during the seven church ages I'll skip the quote because you've already seen it remember in the emphasis church age Jesus said they had the name of Jesus he says you have patience for my name's sake the second church age there's no mention meaning they still had his name the third church age now hold us fast to my name now the Prophet said in the fire dear church age there's no mention of the name that's where they lost the revelation of the name of Jesus the Sardis church age jesus said you have a name you live but you're dead so they still don't have the name forties - ages now in the Philadelphia Age Jesus says you've not denied my name and now the name of Jesus is being restored back to the people amen now later see there's no mention but the Prophet said because of the open door and because of the overlap right because the overlap he said I'm going to keep you from the hour temptation in the sixth church age because of that overlap there's an overlap from the sixth agender seventh because of that we know the name of Jesus is still a revelation the name of Jesus still open door today to all those that believe in the name of Jesus amen so I'll give you a visual Jesus name was lost in this church age according to Jesus but it's restored here at the end of the Philadelphia the the Laodicea can anybody understand that by God's grace that's the lap over he keeps talking about these ages kind of lap over so the law the losing of the name lapped over the influence of that age laughed over but now the influence of the restoration is in our lives amen it's laughed over into my life hallelujah Amen now here's a quote here the prophet's gonna bring out another idea about the open door okay so let me just read this this following quote refers to the end of Leo see in church eight so the Prophet said right now we're living in another open door age okay so he's saying we have another open door so we'll get to this at the end I'm gonna actually gonna close with that that's the new thought I never heard before now we find out that this great revelation that God gave here to the church in this last days that God sent and reveals himself the open door between the two or two ages it wasn't in the lair of seein age neither was in this other age but it was between the lap over so it lapped over into both ages this open door lapped over into both ages it wasn't just one it was both he said I'll prove it a little further down now the revelation of himself is where he's built his church haami knows that to be true he built his church upon the revelation of himself amen now let's get back to these open North scriptures here what is the open door he said the revelation of the supreme deity of Jesus Christ what did he say to his first church back here back in this age he said I am he that was which is and which shall come I'm the first and the last I'm the Almighty he said it three different times made his self deity to the first Church back here before he went into the last church age he said I set before you an open door if you want to see the revelation here it is where he would build his church and the only way that he could take his church is back to the revelation of what he is truly oh yeah glory now see I updated this slide so here's the six reasons here's a six open door so I updated it with this in yellow the open no response requested by Christ Atlassian church age this included the revelation of Christ's name and his deity that's the open door for us praise God Christ is saying open your hearts door and then they said I'll give you the revelation of my name and of my deity praise God you know that's one thing that all these false churches have you know the one thing they have in common it's not communion you know that most Protestants will say oh that that bread is not the body that wine is not the blood but you know the one thing they'll agree on Church is that Trinity doctrine that's one thing for them they can all grab their arms say we all believe God's three persons we all believe God is three see in other words they're all saying we're all idol worshipers praise God in fact they're all saying we're all denying the name of Jesus Christ and I'll tell you how just a little testimony the guys I work with at the Bible Club he taught last week and he said now brother Jesse's been teaching me a lot of things lately he taught me that the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost is what he said what is it I said the Lord Jesus Christ and he said what is that like a different name I said it's the literal name of God and he said amen and he thought it right there to the kids he said father son Holy Ghost he said Lord Jesus Christ so see he can learn something that's pretty good sign if you can't learn something like that if you turn down that what are you doing you're closing the door you're not letting Jesus bring you to the open door glory I say there's hope for that fella Alleluia there's hope he can be taught the Word of God he can say he said father is Lord because Lord means ruler he said son is Jesus right God in flesh Holy Ghost is Christ Christ means The Anointed of what the Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ thank God for the open door amen what am i I'm trying to tell you that God's trying to open the door to people praise God but memory saw on Sunday night you've got to pray for the open door I've got to pray for open doors that's what Paul said Paul said pray for me and open door and I speak the word boldly as I ought to speak hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord open doors that's we're praying here at the altar before church Lord open heart save souls were sighing and crying for abominations if there's fifty in the city say 50 at 40 30 20 10 if there's only eight if there's only three say what you can save souls we don't want to see people lost we want to see you open the door amen glory so they can see baptism they can see that Jesus is God amen so they can see Isaiah 44 where he says he said I am the only God if there's another God beside me I don't know him he look over and say well there's the son you know well actually there's another guy there's the Holy Ghost dove over here he said if there's any other God I don't know him why didn't he say there's them well if I there's no other God well I know them though I know my daddy and I know that the dove it's there's only one God and people don't understand that God was a father he became a son and now he sends his spirit as the Holy Ghost the one same person amen and if you can't see that he said you're blind he said your danger of hellfire because jesus builds his church upon the revelation of who Jesus is amen that's exactly right and program said that's the greatest revelation there is is the supreme deity of Jesus Christ he said that's the first revelation and that's the revelation we need for salvation do you think God's gonna let my daughter into heaven only if they're good to the bride that's the only way the only way because how can they in this age of information also got it going on to do his type in Google and say is God a Trinity is God three persons and you hit the images button and you'll pull up the one this wheel where all the Scriptures will point to Jesus Christ how many ever seen that one this we are never seen that okay do you want to see it tonight never seen the oneness meal okay bear with me here that's my youtube channel a lot of comments make up this week by God's grace so we're thankful for that the oneness wheel hauls people got to do today I'm sorry just go on YouTube airs right there that's the oneness wheel every scripture points got the Good Shepherd it goes Old Testament New Testament Jesus God the Redeemer Old Testament who doesn't God the Creator Jesus coming Jesus the rock Jesus first and last Jesus the I am and I am he Jesus the King Jesus the Shepherd Jesus the Redeemer and Savior Jesus the creator god is coming God the rock God the first in the last God said I am he God is the king God is the Shepherd all these things God in the Old Testament is Jesus Christ of the new praise God if they can't see that they're blind if they don't want to see it they're idolaters and the only way to get to heaven then is to be good to the bride because they've turned down the truth for what a lie and see what they're gonna do Church they're gonna unite around this Trinity or some other thing but that's gonna be part of it has to because the Prophet said that's part of the mark of the beast right the mark in the head he said is the doctrine of the false church Trinity doctrine just like the Trinity Broadcasting Network right Trinity they love this false lights a false teaching it's not there God never said I'm three persons he said I'm the only one there's nobody else beside me but see that's what they're gonna unite around and it's gonna look so pretty brother Adam the bank is gonna look so nice oh we all believe God praise God the Father Son and Holy Ghost but behind that is some lustful desires they still got because the Bible said they turn the truth of God into unrighteousness so see we all believe this we're all united in rouen but we all like to cuss or we all like to lust and we all like to have our big money in our big buildings rather than doing the right thing did you know there's a famous woman preacher and she spent $20,000 on one toilet in her house and it's not me you can look it up it's online because the government investigated them a few years ago $20,000 on a commode it's right there you can I'll take it to you if you want to see it this is how and see they can all unite around what women can cut their hair women can preach but we all believe in Jesus we're all going to heaven that's nonsense to deny the Word of God is to deny Christ Jesus said when you got the Holy Ghost he leads you into all the truth of the Bible is that right and by their fruits you shall know them so does that help by God's grace if you want to copy that I can print one off right after church I just got a printer right here I'll send it to Wi-Fi on print on the Wi-Fi okay if this doesn't prove God's one then people are just blind so where they gonna unite under this lie the Trinity oh that's okay I'll right by God's grace I don't know what I was into my notes gotta go look that up on the Internet so that must have been to help somebody here tonight that's when I first saw Simon getting out when I first came in the message I'm like oh yeah God's one I can see that now God never said I'm three persons he's three manifestations but he's one person because the word manifestation is in the Bible the Bible said God was manifest in the flesh and the Bible said the manifestation of the Spirit is given a prophet every man with all so the Holy Spirit manifestation of God the son is the manifestation of God and the father is God the invisible spirit right okay I know I said a lot there so try to slow down okay now now putting different colors on here because this is important and I've been saying this but I want to go over this now we find out what he said I said before you know open door I don't care how many manmade organizations comes up or denominations even the gates of hell can't shut it only way to beat it is to join it he's talking about this Jesus name in Jesus baptism and one God some about the oneness of God in other words that's all you can't join it so you have to be born into it right so there's nobody could ever stop that message of the supreme deity and the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ the gates of Hell will never prevail against it now you say how do you know that's right brother branham how do you know that's a revelation I love this simple answer he says it's exactly with the word how do you know you're right how do you know you got the message in our I know it's the mystery of God because it's written plainly here in the Bible that's how I know how do brother ran no he didn't say a vision he didn't say a dream he didn't say because I'm so perfect or I'm so holy he said because it's the Word of God amen it's the word it's not a man's idea it's God's idea no one else can say nothing about it exactly it's the word there's no place where anybody was baptized in the titles father only goes because 10 days after Jesus said that Peter baptized in the name of Jesus Christ so if you have not been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you need to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ yeah I was I was baptized father son Holy Ghost but as soon as I saw that I got rebaptised in the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah this great Saint Paul the angel of emphasis commissioned every person that had not been baptized in Acts chapter 19 no matter how you been baptized if you never been baptized the name of Jesus Christ he commissioned you to come and be baptized over again in the name of Jesus Christ he said if an angel from heaven comes teaching anything else let him be accursed so you can see what the angel that comes in this last days hallelujah what kind of message he's gonna have when he comes we may be leading up to him but I'm telling you when he comes he'll preached the baptism in the name of Jesus Christ if you don't believe it you come around tomorrow night he said let me show you through the scripture he certainly will and the circumcision of the heart the divine miracles the workings of the powers just like they had on the day of Pentecost the very original apostolic blessing will come right back to that little remnant to take it up yonder in the rapture amen this is God's plan he's got to bring people back from where they were at the beginning he's got to restore that same teaching right back at the end time in order to take his wife off the earth that contract will be just exactly like it was when it was tore off in the first way Oh how I love him no look oh I'm so glad so glad I can't express it hardly I'm so glad that like I can say I'm one of them I just wish all my brethren was like that I just wish that I could have my brothers and sisters out here my precious friends out in the world to see this great thing don't you church I'd give anything for that my heart bleeds for that when I start praying my heart bleeds God can you help somebody see this why can't people see this I'd give anything to get people to see that they need to be baptized in Jesus Christ's name and then you know that Jesus is God in the flesh not a second person but God in the flesh he's the image of the invisible person makes him the person it makes him the person of God about cease Express image of his person in Hebrews 1:3 he said I'd be willing tonight God knows I got a little boy Joseph to raise a little girl Sarah Rebecca lovely wife I'd hate to leave but if I know that my brother and the people that I know in this world could accept that believe that and be filled the Holy Ghost I'd be ready to go right now he says I'd be ready to die if that would make more people come to know this truth I'd sacrifice myself how many would say amen to that I would sacrifice myself in order that other people might see this truth hallelujah that's real that's real belief right there that's real love same thing Paul said Paul said I wish I was cursed that my brethren could see the Word of God Oh hallelujah are you so glad you're one of them Church are you glad are you glad tonight I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them Laurie hallelujah that's exactly right we ought to be glad or some of those Holy Ghost field Saints praise God we're not ashamed this kind of preaching we love this kind of preaching amen the world needs more of this kind of preaching that preaching I'm talking about not me that preaching the Word of God I'm just thankful I get the preacher by God's grace and I give my life to nothing else than to preach the Word of God he said all he said if you could if I could just and you can't look at he says he's tried he said if you talk to them gentle they think you're trying to push something over on them I've had it where I talk to people and I say well God sent a prophet they say you mean are you a Mormon you see and that's how it is Loran says if I talk to people real gentle they think you're trying to trick him into something so he says and there's only one thing you can do stay with the word and nail it down and that's exactly right just stay with it don't try to be real gentle and because the Mormons do that the Latter day Saints do that just stand with the Word of God now you have to like that I'm just saying like we don't have to put anything on we just have to say what the word says if they're a child of God they'll come to God amen nobody can pluck him out of my father's hand all the father given me has come to me praise God we just got to stay encouraged because we're in an hour when very few are gonna come we just gotta encourage ourselves say thank God brother that was here thank God Jose's here house let's be encouraged maybe God will send another amen some five years or ten years down the road but I'm willing to wait until God sends them because I'm just gonna stand on the Word of God like by Toll Brothers vague I said I thought we gonna have a lot more soul saying than this in the last 11 years but we do have the souls that God wants saved amen because God can't lose one exactly oh I said if I could okay I'm sorry I forgot to delete this sorry I wanted to eat that off because I want to make more room and a revelation himself has supreme needed what did he do it I just can't leave it somehow he revealed it in the church at Ephesus and I remember our message is the restoration of the original apostolic message so Jesus revealed his name to Paul right and now and then I got took away by the fourth church age but here in the sixth and seventh Jesus gives a lap over and he's gonna reveal his name to both ages especially at the end before he comes to raptures bride is that right and that was when the light first broke through to shine the Christian light the Holy Ghost Age started right here and Ephesus amen I'm getting that where I'm almost running close and this is almost this is almost a new thought it's right here here's the noose up yeah I think this is the next news no I'm sorry it's almost here almost now he says I've set the open door I have the keys he's talking like Jesus I'm the only one can open it I'm the only one can reveal it Jesus has the keys is that right there no man can come to me except my father draws them and all the father's give me will come to me no man can be saved only through Jesus Christ not through any Church any organization any bishop or Pope just through Jesus Christ he has the key he's the only one that can the keys of what David the future coming millennium where he'll set on the throne of David amen I have the keys of David I open this door nobody can shut it nobody can open it but me and nobody can shut it to me so here here's another visual now look I slid off I'm sorry I assumed out and now we see thyatira sardis Lucia here's the rapture here's the tribulation here's the money um everybody see that the Jesus they lost Jesus name here in Thyatira Jesus restores the name the baptism the deity of Christ he restores that here at the end of the Philadelphia Church age and he tells them I had the keys to millennium because look we're knocking on the door of the Millennium Church are you with me it's the last two ages it's the last few ages last few years right before the Millennium so Jesus reminds them I've got the key folks bride I've got the key I'm packing your responsibility on my shoulder and I got the open door to the Millennium and I'm gonna take you if you're faithful and keep my word glory he tells them right before the rapture right before the Millennium I'm gonna take you in the money I'm honey I'm bringing to you I got the keys to your millennium honeymoon uh what I can I say home I got the keys to your honeymoon home I got the keys to it just trust in me put your faith in me and have full confidence in my word keep hold fast my word till I come and you'll be given a crown of life amen glory is it's right at the door or okay now here's the thought where he brings in now the open door that's revealed here now not only is it the name of Jesus in Baptism not only is it the supreme deity but now all that leads you to up the baptism of the holy ghost here's the next go this is the I never knew this before this was all fresh to me today so to me it's fresh revelation and I'm so very thankful for like brother Branham said so he reads a scripture he reason this is a scripture this is a revelation 3:9 there's a good night full right there so he said you could preach a whole night on that scripture you could watch what are they now then that he talked to that he had found his name after all this time here down there come in the open door Jesus Christ he said they got the Word of Life and been filled with the Holy Ghost and now he said those are there are those among you who are in the synagogue of Satan so let me go back there so all this time they didn't have a name and Jesus was bearing with him bearing with him Mary with him but finally he gives you the name and now that you got the name now you can be baptized in the name now you can believe there's one name to God and now there's a way to get back to the Holy Ghost amen but had been hitting all those ages but now at the end time he opens the door and said come on in to the baptism of the Holy Ghost you got to come through my name you got to come through the revelation of who I am oh thank you Jesus see I never saw the open door as the Holy Ghost until I read this message again I listened to it two or three times and I never saw this was the Holy Ghost connection until I read through it today so I was very thankful for that and I'm still not done here right here I'd had none here's a thought on the sleep inversion church so pay attention right because here tonight by God's grace we're a how many versions of the word how many are pure to the word all she do is live the word that makes you a virgin to the Word of God when you're separating away from the things of the world now you're a virgin you're yeah you have no you have no intercourse with the world all you do is have intercourse with Christ all you do is have a contact and fellowship with Christ he said let me break in the mornings message that's the sleeping version right there can you see it when was it at the end time oh when they went out see they are justified by faith sanctified justified through Luther's message sanctified through here but they miss the what open door no that's the baptism of Holy Ghost he just mentioned in the previous paragraph so people in this day they can go through justification sanctification but they've got to go through the open door amen which is filling your soul with the Holy Ghost amen and if you got the Holy Ghost she'll be full of life you'll be full of power you'll be full of joy you'll be full of faith you'll be full of long-suffering you'll be full of the fruits of the Holy Spirit hallelujah that's exactly right you see justified by faith through Luther sanctified through Wesley's message now here's the new thing this is all new to me this right here brother Bram said now there's another open door at the end of the day overseen church age I never knew this I knew there was open door in the Philadelphia Church age but I never knew there was an open door in art in other words I never knew that open door extended and made a kept open longer for the rapture so this is new to me now this is the quote paragraph 256 and now this great temptation the hour of temptation that should come upon to try the whole world goes into the tribulation just in a few minutes we'll see it it goes on in the tribulation and the tribulation did not come in the days of Wesley so we agree so what age are we in what's this door said before it's where the church is headed right now and already in to the lair to see a church age so see this this promise lapped over this promise carried over from Philadelphia into the lair scene Church age but this little place right in here now here it is within the last 35 or 40 years has been an open door setting right before the people to come in and God will take the remnant and seal it off why did brother Branham say the last 35 or 40 years because the Assemblies of God organized around 1920 and this was 1960 so brother bands pointing out God started a revival but when they organized God said fine I'm done with you I'm opening a door of faith to the Gentiles sure I'm opening a door because they've closed the door denomination so Jesus says I'm gonna open the door to the last day Gentile bride and see I didn't know that I didn't know he said it like that and they'll go on into a lukewarm and it them out of his mouth the work will be cut short up goes the church and here comes the Antichrist moving in for destruction just perfect fits with the whole Bible right on around okay so here's a different picture this is just from 1900 to the year 2000 and now here we are we're over here like in 2017 so this was the time the prophet of God lived he lived from 1906 to 1965 now the open door of the last program said 35 or 40 years would have been from 1920 40 years to 1960 so this open door must still be open today since the rapture hasn't occurred yet it's there but I understand what I'm saying after the Pentecost was denominated after Azusa Street they set the Assembly of God God said fine I'm gonna leave that Pentecostal group and I'm going to get myself a bride for the rapture with the open door of who Jesus is his name in baptism and the baptism of the Holy Ghost are they do you praise God that's exactly right now this last one look here's the last here's the last 40 or 60 years here okay it's this last one I'm sorry it's kind of hard to see well program preached this around 1960 so he would have preached it right here he said the last 30 or 45 years it's been an open door and that open door has to keep going because the rapture hasn't taken place yet does that help by God's grace I just wanted you to see that I never knew that since they denominated makes sense they closed the door on Christ they said Christ can no longer get in and yet they were the ones who have the revival so Jesus just said that's fine I'm gonna go ahead and open a door for my Gentile bride she's got my name she's got my baptism she knows who I am I'm the one person of God and she's got the door to the baptism of the Holy Ghost they send our feet by God's grace I never knew that before so today there's been an open door and that's the open door since the Zeus's tree turned him down now we have so closing I hope you feel the same way but I can say this I'm more thankful for the open door the Holy Ghost baptism than anything on this Thanksgiving Eve I would say thank you Lord for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'm more thankful for that than anything I know up because remember I'm going back to this Court I used earlier oh then great mysteries that God would read begin the real the open door was a great mystery I think that was a great mystery to me I never knew that I never knew God had to carry over that open door because they denominated you they carry that open door well his baptism Horus person and for his Holy Ghost because then close the door on I never knew that as all those
