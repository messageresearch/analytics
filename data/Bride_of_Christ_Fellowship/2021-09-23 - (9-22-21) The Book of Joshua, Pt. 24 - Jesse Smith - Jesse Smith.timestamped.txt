[0:00] about the 12 tribes
[0:10] i remember on sunday kind of ended with
[0:11] that thought how
[0:13] brother brandt was saying the mothers
[0:14] prophesied well personally i couldn't
[0:16] find that in the scripture i still can't
[0:17] find the scripture
[0:18] so it seems like jacob and moses
[0:21] prophesied of it that's what it seems
[0:23] like
[0:24] as far as
[0:27] i can find the scripture and i'm always
[0:29] open to any correction i put that in all
[0:31] my videos i put that on all my sermons
[0:33] i'm always open for any correction it
[0:35] just seems like brother branham was just
[0:36] trying his best and maybe he didn't have
[0:38] like he said it would take hours and
[0:40] hours to to to devote to these things to
[0:42] really nail him down in the scripture
[0:44] and it seems like he just didn't perhaps
[0:45] have all that time because he was
[0:47] constantly in visions praying for the
[0:48] sick
[0:49] off hunting relaxing trying to build up
[0:51] his physical strength because it would
[0:52] just go get torn down the next group of
[0:54] campaigns right through the discernments
[0:56] and so forth so uh but the beautiful
[0:59] thoughts that he shared were were so
[1:01] scriptural and then the details of
[1:03] course you know that's i think that's
[1:04] our job to go through and find the
[1:06] details right i believe that by god's
[1:07] grace deuteronomy 33 verse 1.
[1:12] let's read that together verse one ready
[1:14] one two three and this is the blessing
[1:17] wherewith moses the man of god bless the
[1:20] children of israel before his death now
[1:23] if you go to verse 24 and 25.
[1:26] now let me read these they're you know
[1:27] they're about asher but i want you to
[1:29] notice here if you remember
[1:30] and of asher he said
[1:32] let asher be blessed with children let
[1:34] him be acceptable to his brethren and
[1:36] let him dip his foot
[1:39] in oil that sound familiar
[1:41] on sunday i kind of mentioned that right
[1:43] at the end
[1:44] brother ram talked about how one of the
[1:45] tribes would have his feet and oil but
[1:47] brother braham said ephraim
[1:49] ephraim right
[1:51] but yet the bible says it's asher
[1:55] all right in verse 25 thy shoes shall be
[1:57] iron and brass and as thy day so shall
[2:00] thy strength be
[2:01] i'm not trying to confuse anybody but
[2:03] i'm just saying brother brahm he was
[2:04] just trying his best to get to the right
[2:06] one it wasn't ephraim who had the foot
[2:08] and oil it was asher had the feet and
[2:10] oil okay because we got to take
[2:12] everything back in the word all right
[2:14] now um there's our text now if you go to
[2:17] the mary verse philippians 2 verse 2 and
[2:18] 3.
[2:22] and i did church this week i did it in
[2:24] the bible i looked up in oil all the
[2:26] places of feet and oil there's only one
[2:28] that's ash there's only one
[2:33] so philippians 2 verse 2 and 3.
[2:53] we can read this one together lord
[2:54] willing so let's begin on three one two
[2:57] three
[2:57] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded
[3:01] having the same love being of one accord
[3:04] of one mind let nothing be done through
[3:08] strife or vain glory but in lowliness of
[3:11] mind let each esteem other better than
[3:14] themselves let's have a word of prayer
[3:16] one more time let's bow our heads and
[3:17] ask god to minister to us here tonight
[3:19] heavenly father we're happy to be in
[3:20] your house again lord we just ask the
[3:22] lord by the
[3:23] the love of god in our hearts lord god
[3:25] that you administer to our needs lord
[3:27] give us wisdom and understanding and
[3:29] lord build our faith lord god edify our
[3:31] faith lord as we see prophecies fulfill
[3:34] we can't help lord but have our faith be
[3:37] built and confirmed lord and being made
[3:39] more strong knowing that if these old
[3:41] testament prophecies were fulfilled no
[3:43] doubt all the new testament prophecies
[3:45] about the bride and the rapture and
[3:48] laodicean age lord and and the hot
[3:50] believers that exist in this age no
[3:52] doubt those shall be fulfilled as well
[3:54] lord we see ourselves in those positive
[3:57] prophecies lord god and we just ask god
[3:59] you give us strength and encourage us
[4:00] lord god make us strong in the lord as
[4:03] we saw on sunday again lord god we
[4:05] repent of our sins lord god we remember
[4:07] you're with us tonight lord you'll never
[4:09] leave us nor forsake us and lord we
[4:11] meditate on your word here tonight and
[4:13] ask that you minister to us in jesus
[4:15] christ's name and saint said
[4:17] amen god bless you praise god you may be
[4:19] seated by the grace of the lord
[4:26] okay so lord ling we'll start here and i
[4:28] have some slides here uh we'd like to
[4:30] show
[4:34] and again you know we're just uh doing
[4:36] what brother adam's taught us you know i
[4:37] have numerous scriptures where brother
[4:38] brahm said prove all things brother
[4:39] brahma said prove me by the word
[4:42] repeatedly brother ram said
[4:44] test me by the word
[4:46] uh you know and he said if any man has
[4:48] anything i notice i'm wrong he said your
[4:50] duty bound to come tell me about it
[4:52] brother ram wasn't afraid of correction
[4:54] brother branham wanted correction praise
[4:56] god and even said in his home life his
[4:58] wife was his correction
[5:00] that's not with preaching but that's
[5:01] with home life just with his usual
[5:04] living
[5:05] uh brother brahm wanted to be correct
[5:07] right and he and god he recognized how
[5:08] god would often use his wife to do so
[5:12] so and then we read of course hebrews 12
[5:14] we ended with that how the bible said
[5:15] every son must be chastened every son
[5:18] must be corrected praise god and so each
[5:21] person needs correction outside of the
[5:23] lord jesus christ amen so we thank god
[5:26] that jesus christ is the same yesterday
[5:28] today and forever he's here tonight
[5:29] praise god amen now let's look at
[5:32] fulfilled prophecies of the tribal
[5:34] positions
[5:36] okay we'll spend maybe 45 minutes here
[5:38] uh just a shorter sermon hopefully we'll
[5:40] see by the grace of the lord it always
[5:41] changes you know
[5:43] um
[5:44] so we read our text here again it's
[5:46] moses prophesying
[5:48] about asher
[5:50] right and i just i just chose asher
[5:52] because that related to the text
[5:54] that i i'm sorry to the quote that i
[5:56] read on sunday at the end
[5:59] of the morning or the first service by
[6:01] god's grace
[6:03] now
[6:04] here let's just if we can let's just
[6:05] look up here if you can i just wanted to
[6:07] summarize the end of the book of joshua
[6:10] just so you have an idea where this goes
[6:12] okay it'll kind of prepare me as well to
[6:14] look for spiritual meanings all right so
[6:16] chapter 18 is where we're at now
[6:19] uh we saw how they're setting up the
[6:20] tabernacle in shiloh joshua's commission
[6:23] to view and write the description of the
[6:25] rest of land for the seven side or seven
[6:27] tribes rather to possess and then
[6:29] benjamin receives the first lot
[6:32] okay
[6:33] chapter 19 goes over the lots given to
[6:36] the remaining six tribes and joshua's
[6:38] given a special gift of inheritance
[6:40] don't you like that god has special
[6:43] gifts to his servants amen
[6:45] amen praise god brother man had a larger
[6:48] portion of heaven amen
[6:50] because he forsook everything he chose
[6:52] the harder way aren't you glad you chose
[6:53] the harder way of your life it'd been a
[6:55] lot easier to go with the with the flow
[6:57] right but instead we're going against
[6:59] the grain praise god we're going against
[7:01] the flow
[7:02] we're like the rainbow trout right
[7:04] rainbow trout goes has to swim into the
[7:06] current
[7:07] amen we're not swimming with the current
[7:09] things are easy for us things are more
[7:12] hard for us they're they're more
[7:13] difficult for us but we're going against
[7:16] the current and the bible says that
[7:18] gives us a special reward remember we
[7:20] went through the 16 rewards from the
[7:22] church ages or was it 14 14 rewards from
[7:24] the church ages not long ago so we get a
[7:27] special reward we get the overcomers
[7:29] inheritance amen just like joshua got a
[7:32] special reward because he was faithful
[7:34] with everything according to the word
[7:36] that's chapter 19. on chat 19 is a huge
[7:38] long chapter and just then has a very
[7:40] small section about joshua's special
[7:43] inheritance praise god
[7:45] uh here's the remaining four chapter or
[7:47] the reigning uh five chapters after that
[7:49] chapter 20 let's list the cities of
[7:51] refuge
[7:53] so if you accidentally killed somebody
[7:54] or something god had a special place of
[7:56] mercy for you right because if you
[7:58] killed somebody the law was eye for eye
[8:01] tooth for tooth life for life death for
[8:03] death right that was the law life or
[8:04] death and so god in his mercy gave them
[8:08] a place where they could go if they
[8:09] accidentally made a mistake god had
[8:11] mercy there now they had to stand before
[8:13] the judges right
[8:14] but what if they stood before the judges
[8:16] and the the story was true then they
[8:18] could have mercy praise god until the
[8:20] death of the high priest and then they
[8:21] would have then they could return to
[8:23] their inheritance by god's grace now
[8:25] church if that doesn't show mercy i
[8:26] don't know what does amen they're under
[8:28] law but god still showed much mercy
[8:30] praise god and allowed them to get their
[8:32] land back even if they lost it
[8:35] of course then you have the jubilee on
[8:36] top of that as well so there was many
[8:38] there's numerous different ways that
[8:40] people could be free from uh their
[8:42] losses and have restoration amen praise
[8:45] god now chapter 21 is the cities of
[8:47] levites among their tribes
[8:50] and this also shows god's faithfulness
[8:52] to israel in keeping all of his promises
[8:56] praise god
[8:57] chapter 22 is joshua's words to the two
[8:59] and a half tribes on the east of jordan
[9:02] and then there's confusion
[9:04] at the end of the chapter followed by
[9:05] peace regarding the altar set up by
[9:08] these two and a half tribes we'll look
[9:09] at that a little more here tonight with
[9:11] reuben
[9:13] also chapter 23 there's a summons by
[9:16] joshua reminding them of blessings and
[9:18] cursings in the land
[9:20] and then the book ends with a final
[9:22] summons
[9:23] uh joshua urging everybody to gather
[9:25] together and he urges them make your
[9:28] choice and then joshua passes off the
[9:31] scene so this is how the book ends
[9:33] praise god have you enjoyed it so far
[9:35] amen and i don't know how much you know
[9:36] i don't know how much inspiration i'll
[9:37] get out of here i felt really inspired
[9:39] so up to this date
[9:41] uh and we'll just see you trust the holy
[9:42] spirit will give us some more
[9:43] inspiration here by the grace of god but
[9:45] this kind of tells you we're getting
[9:46] closer to the end here
[9:49] now let's look tonight lord willing
[9:51] let's look at the order of the tribes
[9:54] possessing their land inheritance okay
[9:58] now here's just a brief review of of how
[10:01] the sons all came about said abraham and
[10:03] sarah they had isaac isaac mary rebecca
[10:06] jacob now jacob mary was given leah by
[10:08] the by the deception right he wanted
[10:11] rachel but he was given leah because the
[10:13] father deceived him he was getting paid
[10:15] back for the deception he did
[10:17] right just like abraham when he lied
[10:19] then he would you know he had to suffer
[10:21] for that isaac lied and they suffered
[10:23] for that
[10:24] whatever a man sells that's what he
[10:25] reaps right so
[10:27] through leah he had reuben and simeon
[10:30] levi judah through leah
[10:33] and then he also had a daughter dinah
[10:36] and then he had two more sons issachar
[10:39] and zebulun
[10:41] okay now through leah's servant zilpah
[10:44] he received gad and asher
[10:46] through billa rachel's sermon remember
[10:48] because she got kind of jealous and she
[10:50] couldn't have kids she said well jacob
[10:52] take my servant billa
[10:54] and they had uh then he had dan and
[10:56] naphtali or naftali i never say that one
[10:59] right
[11:00] finally by god's grace at the very end
[11:02] once all 10. imagine that after all 10
[11:05] god had mercy on rachel
[11:07] opened up her womb and she had joseph
[11:10] right who became the greatest of all of
[11:12] them
[11:13] right
[11:14] and then the last was benjamin and
[11:16] that's where she died remember because
[11:17] she took the gods
[11:19] and jacob spoke the curse if you take
[11:21] the gods whoever takes the gods dies
[11:24] so she died on the curse of the lord for
[11:27] taking those uh but brought forth
[11:30] benjamin
[11:31] okay so then that's her that's how we
[11:32] get the 12 sons
[11:34] praise god and this was god remember the
[11:36] bible i didn't i mentioned this on
[11:38] sunday but remember the bible gives
[11:40] great honor to leah and rachel because
[11:42] the bible said they built the house of
[11:44] israel
[11:46] think about that
[11:48] the men played a great part but the
[11:49] women played a major part as well
[11:52] because they carried the children and
[11:53] trained them god ruth actually gives
[11:56] them credit ruth picks it up and gives
[11:57] them credit that they built the house of
[12:00] god
[12:01] amen praise god they build in other
[12:03] words they built a dwelling place for
[12:05] god
[12:06] amen
[12:07] because these men would of course have
[12:09] offspring and become
[12:11] a kingdom of priests unto god and now
[12:14] god can be worshiped in the way that he
[12:16] wants to be worshipped amen and now he
[12:18] can have people that are wholly
[12:20] dedicated and separated unto him and who
[12:22] got the credit for that well the men did
[12:24] abraham isaac jacob but also the women
[12:27] god recognized their part so sisters
[12:29] again remember you've got the rights
[12:31] amen
[12:32] you got the rights like we saw a few
[12:33] weeks ago you have the rights you have
[12:35] the privileges and you have the calling
[12:37] of god to fulfill all the calling of god
[12:40] for your lives amen i'm excited to see
[12:42] what our what god brings up in our
[12:43] little sisters praise god if the lord
[12:45] tarries you like we said maybe
[12:46] prophecies uh like the daughters of
[12:49] philip uh maybe it's the word of wisdom
[12:52] like uh aquila praise god uh maybe it's
[12:55] even a spirit of discernment like
[12:56] deborah because she was a judge
[12:59] amen just to judge the right is this the
[13:01] right spirit of the wrong spirit and the
[13:02] holy ghost can anoint these sisters and
[13:04] they can recognize it right away amen
[13:07] so we'll see what god or miracles right
[13:09] praying for the sick
[13:10] uh divine healing
[13:13] it'll be wonderful to see what god has
[13:14] for these sisters and then that's just
[13:16] spiritual what about the natural raising
[13:18] children as well into the church of god
[13:21] into the church of the lord jesus christ
[13:23] amen because the bible says we're the
[13:25] spiritual habitation we're the spiritual
[13:27] temple of the holy ghost amen
[13:30] right so mothers you played a great part
[13:32] in that only one we have here tonight is
[13:33] naomi god bless her but all the mothers
[13:35] in our church have played the part of
[13:37] building helping finish the spiritual
[13:39] body of jesus christ amen hallelujah
[13:42] sisters you're putting those last few
[13:44] bricks amen in that laodicean uh in that
[13:47] laodicean layer praise god of the house
[13:50] of god because remember when that last
[13:52] brick is laid when the last person is
[13:53] born again then that capstone comes down
[13:56] and it's going to fit perfectly on the
[13:58] bride of jesus christ amen which the
[14:00] sisters played their part to build that
[14:03] house amen
[14:04] remember paul said i've seen the faith
[14:06] of timothy he said but i saw in your
[14:08] mother and your grandmother first amen
[14:11] praise god so the faith that we see in
[14:12] you no doubt we're going to see it in
[14:14] your children as well praise god
[14:16] and i'm hoping for a bigger portion of
[14:18] mine amen because i'm a little bit
[14:19] ashamed of my faith sometimes but i'm
[14:21] trusting by god's grace i'll see greater
[14:23] faith in their lives amen and it's okay
[14:26] to say that brother branson i was
[14:27] ashamed of my faith you know he thought
[14:29] he should have done better and it's okay
[14:30] church we all fall short of god's glory
[14:32] but there's no condemnation to them that
[14:34] are in christ jesus
[14:36] amen thank god that's the power of the
[14:38] blood amen we recognize our mistakes but
[14:40] then god forgives them and then god
[14:42] gives us more grace to try again and he
[14:45] he finishes the work that he started in
[14:48] us amen that's a great blessing now i
[14:50] preached us years and years ago probably
[14:52] four years now but let's just review
[14:54] this because we're getting into uh
[14:57] this teaching
[14:59] and it's a beautiful teaching it's
[15:01] mainly taught in the seventh seal you'll
[15:02] remember and then the church age book
[15:04] with the book of life section so in
[15:06] genesis 35 uh before
[15:09] uh yeah that's right that's before they
[15:12] leave uh this is the order of the sons
[15:14] before they leave into egypt right
[15:17] so uh reuben born first born now i made
[15:20] levi and joseph a different color
[15:22] because that changed they leave the next
[15:24] time they're counted in numbers
[15:27] okay so after they come out
[15:29] they're counted again and notice levi
[15:31] and joseph are no longer in here because
[15:34] ephraim and manasseh took joseph's spot
[15:38] right
[15:38] and then levi wasn't given any
[15:41] uh inheritance he was just dedicated
[15:44] totally unto god
[15:45] all right
[15:46] but god likes that number 12. i like
[15:48] that number 12 too
[15:50] 12 new testament mysteries amen
[15:53] the twelve stones elijah put on the
[15:55] altar the twelve pieces of shoe bread
[15:57] praise god it all speaks of kingdom and
[15:59] government amen
[16:01] uh
[16:02] and now now notice here okay these
[16:04] gentlemen were added in the two sons of
[16:06] joseph but i put a asterisk by ephraim
[16:09] and dan why did i do that because not
[16:11] long after this they got involved in
[16:13] idolatry and god brought their name out
[16:16] under heaven
[16:18] so their names are still in heaven but
[16:19] under heaven god was gonna make them be
[16:21] punished under heaven
[16:24] yep dan and ephraim
[16:26] uh remember the bible said ephraim is
[16:28] joined to hide her his idols leave him
[16:30] alone remember that
[16:32] i was in the scripture i don't remember
[16:33] which i think it was hosea if i'm not
[16:34] mistaken uh and dan set up a huge or uh
[16:38] i think worship i have to look that one
[16:40] up the exact scripture but he set up
[16:41] idols as well and so god kicked them out
[16:43] of the the order at least until later on
[16:46] amen at least until later on yeah until
[16:48] they're back here in the millennium
[16:50] now in revelation 7
[16:54] after the rapture
[16:56] and here's what we got going on tonight
[16:58] right now church can you imagine this
[17:00] right now tonight there's 12 000 of
[17:02] every one of these getting close now
[17:04] there's almost 12 000 in israel tonight
[17:06] praise god they're slowly coming back
[17:08] and
[17:09] after all these 3 000 years amen
[17:13] they're slowly coming back one by one
[17:16] two by two the three by three four by
[17:19] four they're slowly coming back and
[17:21] they're filling up these numbers but man
[17:23] said they may not know their tribal
[17:24] names but he said god knows their tribes
[17:27] amen hallelujah because god's got to
[17:29] register in heaven hallelujah
[17:32] and he knows the tribes that they're uh
[17:35] they come from
[17:37] but after the rapture church god seals
[17:40] 144 000 with the holy ghost
[17:43] and here the differences are dan and
[17:44] ephraim are removed
[17:46] and then uh
[17:47] levi and joseph are put back in isn't
[17:50] that something he's there at the
[17:51] beginning they're there at the beginning
[17:52] they're put back in for the baptism of
[17:54] the holy ghost i think that's really
[17:56] special amen now they joseph's tribe
[17:59] gets the baptism of the holy ghost look
[18:01] at that dan and the ephraim miss out on
[18:03] the baptism of the holy ghost because
[18:05] they put idols in their life what about
[18:07] these people that make brother branham
[18:09] and idol and make him infallible church
[18:11] i believe they're going to miss out on
[18:12] some things don't you not just the
[18:14] millennium i think they're going to miss
[18:15] out on more than that
[18:17] but see this is what god thinks of
[18:18] people that put idols in their life they
[18:21] get forgotten
[18:22] god can't deal with them because they're
[18:24] giving over you know what that's the
[18:25] spirit of whoredoms the bible said amen
[18:29] idolatry is whoredoms praise god
[18:31] it's spiritual whoredoms being
[18:33] unfaithful making love to devils instead
[18:36] of making love to god
[18:38] right kiss the son lest he be angry he
[18:40] said that on sunday right in the book of
[18:42] uh psalms
[18:44] see but god blots them out they don't
[18:46] get the baptism of the holy ghost and
[18:48] church god that's what god's saying god
[18:50] wants to be number one if god is number
[18:52] one in your life you're gonna be born
[18:54] again amen that's a great truth there
[18:57] especially for our young people that
[18:58] some of them have been baptized if
[19:00] they're gonna be born again god has to
[19:01] be number one he's got to be before
[19:03] school he's got to be before friends
[19:06] he's got to be before hobbies he's got
[19:08] to be before everything god has to be
[19:10] the most important thing in your life
[19:12] pleasing god worshiping god growing
[19:14] closer to god uh knowing god has to be
[19:17] the number one thing in your life
[19:19] amen
[19:21] god cuts off
[19:22] two of the sons uh or sorry two of the
[19:24] tribes because of idolatry
[19:28] what a story
[19:30] and then in the millennium
[19:33] when all things are settled apparently
[19:36] god settles all things with israel right
[19:38] they're not blinded anymore in the
[19:40] millennium he puts dan and e from back
[19:43] in
[19:45] moves out and they're back to their
[19:46] original they're back to the original
[19:47] right back to the original they're back
[19:49] in and then e for manasseh i'm sorry not
[19:52] quite back to the original because levi
[19:54] and joseph are out right but uh ephraim
[19:56] manasseh are back in there for joseph
[19:59] okay
[20:00] so it ends with joseph and levi not
[20:03] having
[20:04] uh a tribe of their own
[20:07] okay
[20:08] that's what it ends with there uh set up
[20:10] in the millennial uh in the millennial
[20:12] kingdom that's right and that's in uh we
[20:14] read that briefly over a few weeks ago
[20:16] remember a sunday night bible study two
[20:18] some days ago ezekiel 48 1-8 and then 22
[20:22] through 29 speaks of that what a what
[20:25] what a what a study
[20:27] isn't that striking in church how god
[20:29] how serious he takes the name of god
[20:32] right
[20:33] look how serious oh no no no i'm nothing
[20:35] about rachel again right
[20:37] look how serious god takes
[20:39] idolatry idols
[20:42] cursed and she dies young she dies at a
[20:44] young age after right after having a
[20:45] baby because of idols these
[20:48] tribes removed because of idols and what
[20:51] did paul say he said dearly beloved he
[20:53] said don't give yourselves to idols
[20:56] my dearly beloved children give
[20:58] yourselves out to idols
[21:00] so we must make sure our greatest love
[21:02] is the lord jesus christ so how do you
[21:04] do that you come to church and you sing
[21:05] god praises you you jump around you hop
[21:08] around you you give god number one and
[21:10] then you do it at home too praise god
[21:13] just give god your best praise god
[21:16] you've got to worship him with all your
[21:18] heart soul mind and strength think about
[21:21] that heart is your emotions are we
[21:22] giving god all of our emotions
[21:25] soul is your nature
[21:27] your mind is your thoughts and then your
[21:29] strength is your body
[21:31] jesus said give me all of those give me
[21:33] all your emotions give me all your
[21:35] thoughts
[21:37] act upon my nature only in your soul and
[21:40] then give me your physical strength as
[21:42] well
[21:42] amen so we don't feel like a church or
[21:45] we're tired we still come to church amen
[21:48] praise god
[21:49] don't feel like thinking about the
[21:50] things of god we read the bible anyway
[21:53] praise god all right amen you've got to
[21:55] do that praise god we've got to pray
[21:57] until we feel emotion for god amen
[22:01] we've got to pray until the emotions
[22:02] that we have from the you know just our
[22:04] flesh we can overcome those and be happy
[22:07] about the lord be joyful in the lord
[22:08] praise god we can weep at all the
[22:11] blessings of calvary amen we can
[22:13] remember all the things that he's done
[22:15] amen
[22:17] it's a great study it's a beautiful
[22:19] teaching here
[22:21] now here's a new one i've never showed
[22:22] this ever to the church so this is brand
[22:24] new so i hope everybody enjoys this one
[22:26] i don't know how useful to be but i hope
[22:27] you enjoy it
[22:29] now here's the order of the tribes
[22:30] receiving that inheritance
[22:33] okay so the first two and a half tribes
[22:35] reuben gad and half of manasseh
[22:38] they got their uh
[22:40] we're told about their
[22:41] land in joshua 14 right that's when they
[22:44] go possess it all the wars are over the
[22:46] kings are uh defeated right and joshua
[22:48] says okay now you can go back and you
[22:50] can go to your your land on the east of
[22:51] jordan remember levites got no land
[22:54] because god was their portion
[22:56] now chapter 15 guess who gets their land
[22:59] first you're going to see it again
[23:00] tonight
[23:01] caleb's caleb's tribe praise god
[23:04] judah gets it right because out of judah
[23:07] comes christ
[23:09] he's the lion of the tribe of judah
[23:12] there's something very special about the
[23:14] tribe of judah look at caleb caleb
[23:16] serves god with all of his heart
[23:18] he holy follows god
[23:20] no idols there praise god amen he holy
[23:23] father the lord and that's what he was
[23:25] known as a man he constantly followed
[23:28] the word of the lord that's my desire
[23:29] amen to be like that i know it's yours
[23:31] too to love the lord with all your heart
[23:33] soul mind and strength and the holy
[23:35] father the lord in everything i do i
[23:37] first found it in the word
[23:42] people want to see visions of other
[23:43] women people want us dream dreams which
[23:44] is okay
[23:45] but if those things don't match with the
[23:47] word of god it's no good
[23:49] it's got to line up with the word of god
[23:52] that's the real like we said that's the
[23:54] real yerman thummim praise god the word
[23:56] of god no matter what leading you get
[23:58] whatever voice you hear that's wonderful
[23:59] but you got to take it back to the word
[24:01] make sure it was the right voice amen
[24:04] because satan can transform transform
[24:06] himself into an angel of light
[24:08] right
[24:09] he can transform looks so holy looks so
[24:11] powerful he can transform himself into a
[24:13] messenger of life but he's not a
[24:15] messenger of light he's a messenger of
[24:17] death and the only way to receive the
[24:19] messenger of light is to look back to
[24:21] the word of god the one who wrote the
[24:23] word of god
[24:24] for jesus is the light of the world
[24:27] hallelujah
[24:28] we hear a lot we hear a lot of that
[24:29] today people having visions and i
[24:31] dreamed this to brother branham and i
[24:32] heard that and i saw that that's fine
[24:34] but take it back to the light then take
[24:36] it back to the real word of god and see
[24:38] if it shines on that urem of the word of
[24:40] god
[24:41] amen
[24:43] so chapter 16 now we're past that right
[24:46] because we're on 18 right now
[24:47] chapter 15 you saw judah got their
[24:49] inheritance 16 ephraim and the other
[24:52] half of manasseh got it now look there's
[24:54] those uh there's those brothers there
[24:57] right by relation so joshua's second
[25:00] judah was first with caleb joshua second
[25:04] got the land as far as the order of the
[25:05] tribes
[25:08] manasseh the other half oh yeah it's
[25:10] explained again there let's explain
[25:12] again so now you've had now after after
[25:14] joshua 17 now five of the tribes have
[25:17] already been taken how many are left
[25:18] seven
[25:19] and we saw that on sunday right there's
[25:21] seven more left
[25:22] so joshua 18 shows how seven tribes did
[25:25] still not receive the land but then
[25:27] benjamin gets his lot so now we have
[25:30] five plus one is six
[25:32] so now six of the tribes half the tribes
[25:34] have their land and then when we read
[25:37] nineteen we'll maybe preach on that
[25:38] maybe sunday we'll actually not suddenly
[25:40] probably be next wednesday maybe we'll
[25:41] see lord willing
[25:43] chapter 19 gives the lots for simeon
[25:46] zebulun issachar asher naphtali and dan
[25:50] and then at the end of chapter 19 as you
[25:52] go to chapter 20 all the tribes have
[25:54] their land and the church said
[25:56] that took me about 30 minutes to do that
[25:59] just that one visual right so think
[26:01] about how much time it took that person
[26:02] to do that one and that took me 30
[26:04] minutes how much did that take that guy
[26:07] all right now i just did another way
[26:08] this is the same information just a
[26:10] little differently i put the birth order
[26:12] of the children right here and then the
[26:14] order that they got their land so reuben
[26:16] really got it first right because they
[26:17] chose the east side of jordan
[26:20] uh so did
[26:21] the half of manasseh and gab they got
[26:23] their land first because they chose to
[26:25] be foolish virgin
[26:26] and the church said
[26:28] they chose well i don't want to live in
[26:29] the land the giants are too much i'd
[26:31] rather i like to live outside they chose
[26:32] to be foolish virgin
[26:34] now second after that tie breaker was
[26:36] judah got the land second
[26:38] because they got theirs first
[26:40] third was ephraim fourth was
[26:44] i missed fourth oh yeah because i got
[26:46] drive two two fifths what happened
[26:51] oh there it is yeah thank you hey good
[26:53] eyes brothers good eyes good
[26:55] fourth was manasseh the other half fifth
[26:58] was benjamin six simeon seven zebulun
[27:01] eighth isakar
[27:03] uh ninth where'd nine i must left nine
[27:06] out okay left nine up ten asher eleventh
[27:09] naphtali
[27:10] and then last was dan okay remember levi
[27:14] the lord was his portion i like that
[27:15] praise god
[27:17] i don't have to i like that lord i don't
[27:19] have to have lands and riches and all
[27:20] that fancy things just give me jesus
[27:23] ah that's my portion maybe amy's gonna
[27:25] sing that on sunday he's my portion you
[27:27] are my portion
[27:29] levi no i'm sorry joseph his two sons
[27:31] even from nasa were given his portion
[27:34] right
[27:35] okay
[27:39] oh where's that
[27:44] lord
[27:45] so we might fix
[27:49] where's number nine
[27:51] oh it's not there
[27:54] that could be okay yeah they thank you
[27:55] yeah where's my nine
[27:57] that's so strange
[28:01] oh you know i put the ones together too
[28:03] so yeah i probably should have separated
[28:04] those because if three of them are are
[28:07] all one then
[28:08] there won't be twelve so yeah often
[28:11] checked into that thank you good good
[28:12] eyes there
[28:14] that one took me less time that one was
[28:16] pretty easy that didn't take a whole lot
[28:17] of time all right now so remember from
[28:19] genesis to numbers levi was separated
[28:21] the priesthood joseph's two sons were
[28:23] placed in from numbers to revelation
[28:25] ephraim and dan removed due to idolatry
[28:28] and then from a revelation to ezekiel
[28:31] they're back in the numbers 10 order so
[28:33] the order of coming out of egypt
[28:36] okay they're placed back in just a
[28:38] reminder there all right now let's go
[28:40] back to my text here and
[28:42] uh give me uh
[28:45] about 30 more minutes we'll try to
[28:46] finish up here tonight by god's grace uh
[28:49] example now i'm going to use this
[28:50] example from the text again moses here's
[28:54] moses prophecy
[28:55] and he places asher's foot in oil
[28:59] okay
[29:01] now i want to start with this to show
[29:02] you how brother branham found these
[29:04] beautiful thoughts
[29:06] but not all the details were exact
[29:08] because he wasn't a scholar
[29:10] right he wasn't a doctor of divinity
[29:12] okay and he didn't have the time to do
[29:14] it now remember there were seasons of
[29:16] brother man's life when he was a teacher
[29:18] like the church ages the seven seals
[29:20] right i would even say marriage and
[29:22] divorce he did a lot of great teaching
[29:23] in that sermon
[29:25] right which there's a big uh confusion
[29:27] about that now people that are leaving
[29:28] the message say brother i'm talk
[29:30] uh
[29:30] uh
[29:31] polygamy in there that's not true
[29:34] there's no that's not true
[29:35] they they're just not born again and so
[29:37] they want to find excuses to marry more
[29:39] wives
[29:40] that's the sin of those people
[29:43] but brother adam didn't teach all the
[29:45] time but when he did teach and he got
[29:47] time down to preach like the future home
[29:48] there's another one just taught it
[29:50] beautifully
[29:51] and yes he borrowed from clarence larkin
[29:53] but what he did is he took the great
[29:55] revelation god gave him of the three
[29:56] works of grace which larkin didn't teach
[29:59] and he showed how the earth had to go
[30:00] through three phases just like you and i
[30:03] go through three phases amen
[30:05] now in 1960 brother ram said ephraim's
[30:08] mother
[30:09] prophesied his foot would be an oil
[30:12] but it was actually moses who prophesied
[30:15] asher's foot would be an oil
[30:17] and that was our text
[30:19] this doesn't stumble you and i but that
[30:22] would offend other people because they'd
[30:24] say who are you to protect or who are
[30:26] you to correct god's prophet well it
[30:28] ain't me it's the holy ghost because i
[30:30] wouldn't know it unless the holy ghost
[30:31] showed me
[30:32] right because who am i i'm a dummy i
[30:34] don't know nothing
[30:35] the only way a correction can be made is
[30:37] by the holy ghost
[30:38] because either listen in terms of either
[30:40] i'm wrong or i'm right
[30:42] right either i'm wrong i'm right so if
[30:44] i'm right and brother man just said the
[30:46] wrong name then it was the holy ghost
[30:49] bringing correction to help you and i
[30:51] look back to the word of god and make
[30:53] the bible or absolutely just like
[30:54] brother branham said if i died now right
[30:56] now he said my absolute is the word of
[30:58] god amen
[31:01] he said if i die in my tracks right now
[31:03] jesus christ is my absolute amen and
[31:05] there's only one absolute there can be
[31:07] no other but jesus christ in his word
[31:12] so if that offends them then they need
[31:13] to get born again that's the problem
[31:15] they're not born again and they worship
[31:16] a man more than they worship christ
[31:18] that's my thoughts i can be wrong but
[31:20] that's what i believe
[31:23] any honest person would know that man
[31:25] made just simple human mistakes
[31:28] now here's the
[31:29] here's the slide from sunday ephraim now
[31:32] here's what ram says
[31:34] watch when they each one of those
[31:35] mothers when she called out ephraim when
[31:37] she was in labor positionally placed him
[31:39] where his feet was setting in oil now
[31:40] notice ephraim ephraim
[31:43] now i showed you on sunday that's not
[31:45] true but
[31:46] we'll get through it again here
[31:48] just exactly every one of them where
[31:50] they were at
[31:51] i think i might have changed some words
[31:53] up here yeah yeah genesis 41 52 is the
[31:56] only recording of his birth from a nasa
[31:58] she does not mention oil nor any
[32:00] prophecy the bible records joseph not as
[32:03] an aph names ephraim
[32:06] so we have no scripture for azanath
[32:09] prophesying or naming
[32:11] ephraim
[32:12] no scripture right also the lexicon has
[32:15] no meaning of ephraim but it has to
[32:17] relate to the fruitfulness despite your
[32:19] affliction because that's how all the
[32:21] mothers named their children whatever
[32:23] they were feeling at that moment like
[32:25] judah praise the lord that's why i named
[32:27] the boy i'm praising god for another son
[32:30] amen
[32:32] that's what they named the child
[32:35] right and manasseh's name relates to god
[32:37] helping her
[32:38] forget her toil that's what manasseh
[32:40] means god help me forget my toil
[32:44] okay now let's get to a few and we'll
[32:46] try to get through four tonight by god's
[32:47] grace okay we'll try to get through the
[32:49] first four of the sons that were born
[32:52] we'll see how it goes get your bibles
[32:53] ready uh i need some ready readers some
[32:55] maokai looks like you and i maybe nature
[32:57] get your bible carrots you want to read
[32:59] you don't have to but no okay that's
[33:01] fine
[33:02] i'd be great to get through some of
[33:04] these here and uh
[33:05] again church we gotta taste test
[33:07] everything by the word of god all right
[33:10] now first i hope that you can see this i
[33:11] hope this just i just want to make this
[33:12] simple humble statement i hope you can
[33:14] see if god foreknew their places in
[33:16] scripture i'm sorry if god for knew
[33:18] their places in the natural land how
[33:20] much more does god know your spiritual
[33:22] place
[33:23] and also your natural place
[33:25] amen
[33:27] right like when i went back for my
[33:28] 20-year football reunion i showed naomi
[33:31] and wesley's picture up there
[33:33] i think i still have it on my computer
[33:35] i said this is the reason god let us win
[33:37] a state championship and let me go to
[33:39] akron for college so i could be pastor
[33:42] because they needed a home church
[33:45] and they're like yeah interesting
[33:48] but they heard it i told it to them
[33:50] that's the reason god let me win those
[33:51] state championships i won six state
[33:52] championships
[33:54] and then two i won six individual and
[33:56] two team
[33:58] the reason god allowed that wasn't to
[33:59] glorify me because i get old all the
[34:01] records get broken it's to bring me to
[34:03] akron so i could preach the word of god
[34:05] to their kids amen and my kids
[34:07] so we could have a church in akron
[34:09] praise god that's the whole point of it
[34:10] and maybe i'll pull that up here if i
[34:12] can remember at the end of the sermon
[34:13] here
[34:14] i think i have it on my ipad i don't
[34:16] know
[34:17] but see if god knew about their natural
[34:20] place how much more does he know about
[34:21] your natural and your spiritual things
[34:24] that god wants you to possess amen
[34:27] god wants us to possess the gifts of the
[34:29] spirit god wants us to possess love and
[34:32] joy and all the fruits of the spirit
[34:34] most people don't possess that but we
[34:36] should amen
[34:37] and god wants us to do that and we are
[34:40] i'm saying like this we are enjoying

[35:19] real word man you're a real you got a
[35:21] real good leadership i i i don't know if

[35:25] bold with those hindus we met on sunday
[35:27] he's like you need to join our family
[35:29] our family in christ
[35:31] that was a beautiful witnessing
[35:32] opportunity
[35:33] that was i gave my card and i haven't

[35:36] gonna brother on the day of judgment
[35:38] they're we're gonna stand right there
[35:39] we're gonna watch that again
[35:40] we're gonna forget what happened you
[35:42] know in a few days or a few weeks we'll
[35:43] forget but god didn't forget that they
[35:45] had a chance right there to turn down
[35:47] their hindu gods and receive the true
[35:48] jesus christ
[35:50] because they were trying to say all the
[35:51] gods are the same william's like no
[35:52] there's only one god with one name
[35:55] and i even told him at the end i said
[35:56] well you got we got to compare our holy
[35:58] books because if you change one word
[36:00] you're cursed
[36:01] right you need to contact me let me see
[36:03] your holy book because our holy book is
[36:06] perfect praise god
[36:08] and to change one word of it you're
[36:09] cursed you've got the got a different
[36:11] gospel i didn't say all that but i said
[36:13] some of that there
[36:15] okay so malachi birth scriptures of
[36:17] reuben go and read this now let's see if
[36:19] there's any prophecy about land in here
[36:20] go ahead maokai
[36:23] and when the
[36:24] lord when he was hated he opened her
[36:26] womb but rachel was barren
[36:28] and leah conceived in their son and she
[36:30] called his name reuben where she said
[36:33] surely the lord has looked upon my
[36:35] affliction now therefore my husband will
[36:37] love me
[36:38] all right what's the verse after that
[36:39] who does it what does it say then
[36:43] samia okay so there's this birth
[36:45] scriptures does it say anything about
[36:46] the land
[36:48] no
[36:49] and we're not trying to be smart alex
[36:50] i'm sure the live streamers understand
[36:52] that we're not we're just trying to look
[36:53] at the what does the bible say
[36:56] now if you look in the uh
[36:58] the hebrew lexicon
[37:00] reuben means behold a son
[37:03] now brother abraham said his name meant
[37:05] sheep herder
[37:06] now you just saw in the scripture does
[37:08] his name mean sheep herder at least not
[37:10] in hebrew not good in some other
[37:11] language right
[37:13] but it doesn't mean sheep herder in the
[37:14] hebrew okay nature you want to read that
[37:17] genesis 49 verses 3 and 4.
[37:34] excellency i'm sorry yeah excellency
[37:45] excellency
[38:10] the finalists
[38:20] all right great reading of maokai nature
[38:22] great job
[38:23] okay so so far we read the birth and
[38:25] there's jacob's prophecy look about his
[38:27] own son do you say anything good about
[38:29] his son not really he said you he did
[38:31] say you're my excellency of power but he
[38:32] said you're not going to prosper
[38:35] right how'd you like your dad to say
[38:37] that
[38:38] once you want a blessing from your dad
[38:41] but see god foreknew the choices he was
[38:43] going to make
[38:45] right you see anything about any land
[38:46] there no
[38:48] okay uh let's go to uh by the way i'm
[38:50] key ready deuteronomy 33 6.
[38:53] let reuben leave
[39:00] very good
[39:02] that was aw that's all moses said about
[39:03] reuben
[39:11] yeah because this is this is before the
[39:15] um so here do we see anything about land
[39:19] so we'll see the results of some of
[39:21] these prophecies next but nothing
[39:23] prophesied of his land
[39:25] so see every statement by brother brown
[39:26] we got we we can enjoy it you know but
[39:28] we gotta make sure we take it back to
[39:30] the word of god
[39:32] okay victoria honey victoria sit down
[39:34] man
[39:35] thank you sweetie
[39:38] thank you
[39:43] thank you look up here and just watch
[39:44] daddy okay
[39:46] all right
[39:50] okay now here's the quote i read yeah
[39:53] here's the quote i read sunday reuben
[39:54] does not seem to mean sheepherder
[39:56] although he's later connected to sheep
[39:57] and i'm going to show you the scripture
[39:58] on that one his name means behold his
[40:00] son now brother said when each of these
[40:02] hebrew mothers and their travailing in
[40:03] the childbirth called out like reuben
[40:05] that placed him positionally in the
[40:07] palestine exactly the way that that
[40:09] mother said and called his name
[40:11] now that's
[40:13] it's not exactly right right because it
[40:14] wasn't the mothers it was
[40:16] you're gonna see it i've studied this a
[40:18] little bit further there's only a couple
[40:20] that actually had prophecy about the
[40:21] land there's only a couple out of the
[40:22] 12. not all of them i mean there's very
[40:25] few actually i can't remember the exact
[40:27] ones i haven't got there all the way
[40:29] but he said i don't have it all wrote
[40:30] down here but say or in other words
[40:32] let's just pretend let's say reuben met
[40:34] sheepherder gad means cattle raiser and
[40:36] e ferment corn raiser
[40:39] now by spirit now this starts right here
[40:41] by spiritual discernment josh was the
[40:43] new leader by discernment place each one
[40:46] where he belonged and divided land just
[40:48] exactly
[40:49] amen
[40:50] so joshua had the holy ghost right and
[40:52] he had contact with god plus he had the
[40:54] priest with the urem
[40:56] and he said lord where do you want them
[40:58] to live
[40:59] and the bible said he cast lots so he
[41:00] would like roll dice or something like
[41:02] that and then he said is this where
[41:04] reuben's supposed to be and then it
[41:05] would flash on the urim and thumb
[41:08] they'd have a supernatural experience
[41:09] that's where they are praise god see
[41:11] that's how god is god doesn't church god
[41:13] don't have to have things written down
[41:15] god can speak to you through the spoken
[41:16] word of god amen right god can do that
[41:19] but everything that god says will line
[41:21] up with what was written amen
[41:24] that's the joy that we have with the
[41:25] bible and any leading that we have well
[41:27] i feel led to do this or i feel i should
[41:29] say this or i should feel i should go
[41:31] there make sure it lines up with the
[41:32] word first praise god god said he god
[41:36] said he will raise your strength if you
[41:38] wait on him amen
[41:40] we think we get weaker when we wait we
[41:42] don't we get stronger amen
[41:44] we get stronger when we wait on the lord
[41:48] remember the bible said it's the fool
[41:50] that speaks things quickly well i'm
[41:52] going to go do this or i'm going to do
[41:53] that lord said this lord
[41:55] he might have or he might not have
[41:57] the fool speaks quickly right but the
[42:00] wise man holds his words right
[42:02] he waits until he's make sure he's got
[42:04] thus saith the lord
[42:07] they'll still say that in the face of
[42:09] this right they'll still say that
[42:12] that's because they got they got a demon
[42:14] on him and you can't argue with a demon
[42:16] i'm sorry i'll say it like this you
[42:17] can't argue with the demon i'm sorry you
[42:18] can't convince a demon
[42:20] right you can cast them out if the
[42:22] person wants to be delivered but you
[42:24] can't convince them because they they
[42:25] have this so many of them are demons of
[42:27] lies that's their whole anointing is to
[42:29] lie
[42:30] their life is uh to lie
[42:34] and you'll never convince them that
[42:35] they're wrong
[42:40] and leah conceived embarrassing said
[42:42] she called his name reuben for she said
[42:44] surely the lord looked upon my
[42:46] affliction now therefore my husband will
[42:47] love me
[42:49] behold the son god's given me a son my
[42:51] husband's gonna love me doesn't say
[42:52] anything about the land
[42:54] now there's a lot of reading but uh the
[42:56] complaint against now here's this is
[42:58] reason so this is history on reuben were
[43:01] those words that william read and nature
[43:03] read were they fulfilled or not here's
[43:05] what he says the complaint against him
[43:07] in the song of deborah is the summary of
[43:10] his whole history
[43:12] by the streams of reuben by or by the
[43:14] fresh streams which descend from the
[43:15] eastern hills into the jordan and dead
[43:17] sea on whose banks the beto and chiefs
[43:20] met then as now to debate in the streams
[43:22] of reuben great were the desires or the
[43:25] resolutions which were never carried out
[43:27] the people highly resting them on their
[43:29] flocks as if it were a time of peace so
[43:33] in other words when deborah got the
[43:34] victory reuben and his tribes were just
[43:37] sitting up there like everything was
[43:38] peaceful in other words reuben didn't
[43:40] come down to fight with the saints
[43:43] he just kept his life really easy and
[43:45] laid back
[43:46] that's that's exactly i got the
[43:48] scripture i'm gonna show it to you in
[43:49] judges
[43:50] reuben heard oh there's a war going on
[43:52] come down and help barrack and help
[43:54] eric and deborah they're going to go up
[43:56] and defeat the midnight sir
[43:57] and they just sat back and said oh we're
[43:59] just going to hang out we're just going
[44:00] to take life easy
[44:02] now look at the character this person
[44:03] when god calls on him are they ready to
[44:05] fight or not
[44:06] he wasn't ready so church we got to be
[44:09] ready to pray right
[44:10] whether we feel like it or not we've got
[44:12] to fight in prayer don't we
[44:13] right whether you feel like it or not
[44:15] that's why when i get to email someone
[44:16] i'll just buy my head and pray lord
[44:18] minister that need in jesus name we had
[44:20] a couple good prayer requests come out
[44:21] like that you might not have all the
[44:22] time to fight you might not have time to
[44:24] take it to your prayer closet but don't
[44:26] don't avoid it let's not be lazy let's
[44:28] be willing to fight with god's people
[44:33] stan lee's sinai and palestine
[44:36] oh yeah that's a historical reference
[44:38] okay that's from a book now all three
[44:40] tribes on the east of jordan at length
[44:42] fell into complete apostasy at the time
[44:45] as the time of retribution or
[44:46] retribution came god served the spirit
[44:49] of pole king of assyria and the spirit
[44:51] of uh tilgath pil pills
[44:54] pelessier sorry king of assyria to carry
[44:57] them away the first of the tribes in the
[45:00] captive look at that church who was the
[45:02] first one the devil carried away out of
[45:04] their land who's the first one that lost
[45:07] their possession the ones that didn't
[45:09] cross over jordan amen
[45:11] the ones who didn't want to get the
[45:12] baptism of the holy ghost the ones who
[45:14] didn't want to drive out the giants
[45:16] they're the ones got taken away by the
[45:18] devil first
[45:20] in other words the people that don't get
[45:21] born again they're the ones that get
[45:23] deceived first amen because remember the
[45:25] bible said they get taken captive by
[45:27] satan out of his own will
[45:29] because they gave into the will of satan
[45:31] satan takes them over how he ever
[45:33] however he wants to
[45:35] that's what paul said in timothy in
[45:36] timothy
[45:38] he said they're taken captive as a snare
[45:40] he said per venture if god can bring
[45:42] them to repentance
[45:45] see that so when you see people get
[45:46] carried away in the message right and
[45:48] they get carried away into deceitfulness
[45:50] and sin and captivity i mean sin
[45:53] addictions that proves they were never
[45:55] born again
[45:56] because that's what the type is
[45:58] the first ones that get carried away
[46:00] into captivity and slavery and
[46:02] synodiction
[46:03] right like marijuana or
[46:05] adultery or whatever addiction it is
[46:07] right
[46:08] cocaine
[46:09] whatever it is gambling we got a lot of
[46:11] gamblers in the message
[46:13] they hang around the message they're not
[46:14] really in it we're in it because the
[46:16] christ is the message
[46:17] right
[46:18] but they're the ones who get torn off
[46:20] taking off first because they never got
[46:22] born again they never got into the land
[46:24] they never got into christ
[46:26] that's right that's the type that's why
[46:29] this is so beautiful praise god
[46:31] amen
[46:33] the first ones that lose out are the
[46:35] ones that never really lived in there
[46:36] praise god
[46:38] hallelujah
[46:39] didn't have the courage to live in the
[46:41] land they wouldn't live outside the land
[46:43] yet god told them live in the land
[46:45] see be born again have power have the
[46:48] power of the holy ghost live in the land
[46:50] but they didn't want to
[46:52] this is reuben the oldest
[46:54] now see church another thing i'm gonna
[46:56] we see here that that will bless me
[46:58] is that
[46:59] jacob said the sin you committed with my
[47:02] handmaid is gonna follow you that's
[47:04] gonna impact the rest of your life look
[47:06] at that church
[47:08] now of course everybody has free more
[47:10] agency right so reuben could have
[47:12] overcame that but he never did
[47:15] and i was reading it i was i'm sorry i
[47:16] was listening to preachers and they said
[47:18] that was the the act of a heathen king
[47:21] when a heathen king would take over for
[47:23] his dad he had to go sleep with his
[47:25] dad's wives that was a heathen act
[47:28] so that's what reuben tried to do he did
[47:30] a heathen act he tried to go sleep with
[47:32] his dad's concubine or sorry slave
[47:35] right
[47:36] bilda and because he did that he was
[47:39] cursed
[47:41] and he was himself and the tribe was
[47:43] never able to overcome that disobedience
[47:46] it kind of just hung over them their
[47:47] whole life
[47:48] right just like david his adultery
[47:50] didn't hang over him the rest of his
[47:51] life
[47:52] the blood remained over the land
[47:54] remember that the blood remained over
[47:55] his family and the land the rest of his
[47:57] life
[47:58] because some sins are so awful and
[48:00] that's what that's what absalom did what
[48:01] did amazon do when he got the kingdom he
[48:03] went and laid with his wife david's
[48:04] wives up there on in front of everybody
[48:07] that's heathen that's paganism but
[48:10] that's the spirit they were under not
[48:11] the holy spirit they were under the
[48:13] paganism spirit
[48:17] see so we can learn a lot church and
[48:20] i'll say like this there was a one
[48:21] brother who used to come to our church
[48:22] fine brother
[48:23] but he went and saw a prostitute he told
[48:25] me that and he never recovered and now
[48:27] he's out of church and he only he says
[48:29] well if i'm predestinated god will force
[48:31] me back to church
[48:32] that's a lie god gives you your free
[48:34] more agency and see that sin is going to
[48:36] hang over him the rest of his life
[48:38] unless he repents
[48:39] because now it's separate his family
[48:41] they used to dress holy they used to
[48:42] come here over there in the other room
[48:44] you know
[48:45] and now they're all wearing pants and
[48:47] women wearing pants and the tight ones
[48:49] i'm talking about and they put it on
[48:50] facebook and they show up their bodies
[48:52] on facebook and they used to come here
[48:54] and say amen to what i was preaching
[48:57] and one time
[48:58] they come over and said everything we
[49:00] talked about in the van is what you
[49:01] preached
[49:02] so the holy spirit had me give them
[49:04] exactly all the answers to their
[49:05] questions
[49:07] and then a year later they leave and
[49:08] then they start wearing pants
[49:10] that's not god that's somebody who's
[49:12] never crossed over in the promised land
[49:14] that's someone who god loves and tried
[49:16] to show them his love but then they must
[49:18] have fell in love with the world or some
[49:19] uh spirit of addiction or something like
[49:21] that and what happened they were taken
[49:23] into captivity and they lost the victory
[49:26] because they never got in the land we
[49:27] thought they were the land but they
[49:29] weren't in the land amen
[49:31] right we we try to give people the
[49:32] benefit of the doubt
[49:34] we thought a lot of people were in the
[49:35] land and we're finding out they weren't
[49:37] because their life gets taken over by
[49:40] demons of addiction amen
[49:42] that's right praise god i don't plan on
[49:44] saying that but it's just kind of coming
[49:45] to me right now
[49:47] see there's some sins that are so awful
[49:49] and egregious that they hang over
[49:51] people's lives for the rest of their
[49:53] life
[49:58] notice this is so amazing church uh
[50:02] no priest prophet or king ever came out
[50:05] of reuben and yet he was the oldest
[50:08] he was supposed to have all the power of
[50:10] his father jacob think about that
[50:12] abraham isaac jacob reuben that was the
[50:14] order
[50:15] can you ever think about that that's the
[50:17] order he could say i'm in the first born
[50:20] i'm the firstborn
[50:22] i'm the
[50:23] uh great-grandson of abraham but because
[50:26] he did this sexual sin he was cut off
[50:29] from being from even being the firstborn
[50:31] we're going to see that later
[50:32] god takes all the firstborn blessings
[50:34] away from reuben because of his pagan
[50:36] act
[50:37] of adultery well they might even call it
[50:39] incest
[50:41] some people call it incest i i don't
[50:42] actually know the
[50:43] the family ties there with bill i don't
[50:45] know whose family she come from
[50:47] right but the fact is she he slept with
[50:49] his his dad's
[50:52] wife
[50:52] right who is a slave right or concubine
[50:55] everyone is saying
[50:59] see
[51:00] now
[51:00] i want you to remember this to church
[51:03] that when jacob prophesied
[51:05] god wasn't forcing reuben to a bad life
[51:08] but god was foretelling that reuben was
[51:10] never really he and the in them were
[51:12] never really going to overcome this
[51:15] right because god can't force anybody
[51:17] but god was foretelling their freemore
[51:19] agency that they would all just drift
[51:21] away and they wouldn't love god they
[51:23] wouldn't serve god wholeheartedly
[51:25] right
[51:26] so god's not forcing anybody to fall
[51:29] away god's not forcing these people into
[51:30] addictions they're choosing it and god
[51:32] has to let them because he's so
[51:34] loving does that make sense
[51:37] it's 8 o'clock already my goodness
[51:39] that busy body on the wall over there
[51:44] yet now look at this now this is
[51:45] interesting too yet reuben himself and
[51:47] the faithful ones in his tribe seem to
[51:49] have been saved and redeemed so reuben
[51:51] must have at some point he must have
[51:53] lived part of his life there and
[51:54] disobedience and that the maybe at the
[51:56] very end or something he repents and
[51:59] gets redeemed because he is seen here
[52:02] he's one of the 12 tribes of israel
[52:04] right
[52:05] he's back there wasn't he back there
[52:08] did i put that up there was he back
[52:09] there in the baptism of the holy ghost
[52:11] or not
[52:13] maybe i got that wrong did i get that
[52:14] wrong
[52:16] no he's there
[52:17] he's there
[52:18] his tribe's there and that's something
[52:21] his tribe's there so the people himself
[52:24] and the and some of the people must have
[52:26] repented and gotten right right at the
[52:28] end because jesus told the disciples
[52:29] you're going to reign you're going to
[52:31] judge the 12 tribes of israel
[52:33] right that's that one and then there's
[52:34] the 24 seats for the 12 so reuben has
[52:37] one of those seats
[52:39] and then you have uh
[52:41] you have revelation 7 as well where they
[52:43] get the bat to reuben gets the baptism
[52:45] holy ghost his his tribe now the the
[52:47] ones alive that are i believe are alive
[52:49] now
[52:50] and then they're back reuben's back
[52:52] right of course they're in that
[52:55] well i guess they yeah
[52:56] no no no that's right that's right yeah
[52:58] reuben never left the the reuben never
[53:00] left the the tribal groups right it was
[53:02] just dan and ephraim yes i'm kind of i'm
[53:05] kind of getting ephram and uh uh reuben
[53:07] mixed up here
[53:09] so see
[53:10] the life is over overshadowed in
[53:13] disgrace
[53:14] but look how god even gives redemption
[53:16] at the end of our lives
[53:19] if anyone wants it god just like the
[53:21] thief on the cross my goodness god
[53:23] offers them redemption at the very end
[53:25] if they can just look and say jesus is
[53:27] holy he's holy i deserve this jesus
[53:30] doesn't deserve this jesus is the king
[53:32] of kings remember me jesus if you just
[53:34] say that he'll save you amen
[53:37] he said remember me when you come into
[53:39] your kingdom and he said today you'll be
[53:41] with me in paradise amen
[53:43] just by judging the word right
[53:46] a murderer a thief
[53:49] just by judging the word right and
[53:50] recognizing he's a sinner and
[53:52] recognizing christ as the lamb christ
[53:54] saved him
[53:56] so we don't know how close reuben got to
[53:58] going to hell but he got delivered right
[53:59] he got saved
[54:01] because we find him
[54:03] back in the order we find him with a
[54:05] seat at the throne of god my goodness
[54:11] now here's the scripture
[54:13] deborah singing she just got the victory
[54:15] church that's what you do when you get a
[54:16] victory you start singing and praising
[54:18] the lord
[54:19] and the princes of issachar were with
[54:21] deborah even issachar look at this it's
[54:23] a car so we're gonna get the iss car
[54:24] right
[54:25] issachar they come up and helped him
[54:27] they helped barrack they helped uh uh
[54:30] deborah and also barrick and he was sent
[54:32] on foot into the valley for the
[54:34] divisions of reuben there were great
[54:36] thoughts of heart now look they were
[54:38] hoping oh reuben's so big reuben can
[54:40] help us out we have great thoughts in
[54:42] our heart reuben's going to help us
[54:44] but why a bonus thou among the
[54:46] sheepfolds to hear the bleeding of the
[54:48] flocks
[54:50] they would rather spend time just with
[54:52] the animals and just uh everyday lazy
[54:55] kind of work than coming and fighting
[54:57] for their brother and sister who were in
[54:59] the basement basically the life and
[55:00] death
[55:02] they'd rather work than help out their
[55:04] brother and sisters with life and death
[55:08] see we had great thoughts and that's how
[55:09] it is right so we have great thoughts
[55:11] about there it is right there but when
[55:13] we have great thoughts about people that
[55:14] come to our church we think they're born
[55:15] again but when it comes to fighting they
[55:17] don't want to fight
[55:19] they don't want to fight in prayer they
[55:20] want they don't want to drive out all
[55:22] the inhabitants in their lives amen they
[55:24] don't want to possess their land amen
[55:27] hallelujah
[55:29] why would you abide there and lazy
[55:32] living like that why would you come
[55:33] fight for the saints once you come down
[55:35] the altar and get delivered from the
[55:37] prostitution or the doubt or your
[55:39] unbelief or or your sports addiction
[55:42] like some of them some of them had or
[55:43] your tvs like some of the people had
[55:45] that have left us why don't you come
[55:46] down and they don't come why because
[55:48] they don't want it they love the world
[55:50] more they love god and that proves the
[55:51] love of the father was never in them
[55:54] amen
[56:00] for the divisions of reuben there were
[56:02] great searchings of heart
[56:05] oh boy they're so great they're such
[56:06] mess he's the firstborn
[56:08] they're they can really help us out get
[56:10] this victory
[56:11] but no
[56:12] they want to spend time with the sheep
[56:14] instead
[56:15] instead of fighting
[56:17] for the glory of god's name you would
[56:19] think wouldn't your older brother are
[56:20] you the oldest family brother
[56:24] okay so you're not the oldest
[56:26] you have an older brother
[56:28] so do i simon's my older brother how'd i
[56:31] feel like if simon wouldn't come help me
[56:32] out he's my older he's my oldest brother
[56:35] he always has though he's always come
[56:36] help me out every time that's why we
[56:38] thank god for an older sibling praise
[56:39] god
[56:40] right now naomi's oldest right
[56:42] oh you're not the oldest
[56:45] the oldest girl okay my fault sorry i
[56:47] thought you were the honest
[56:51] but your older sibling you want them to
[56:53] reach out and help you when you're down
[56:56] and that's what deborah and barrack were
[56:57] thinking
[56:58] oh we have oh they're they're such a
[57:00] great people
[57:01] uh oh there's their god
[57:03] moses blessed them right moses blessed
[57:05] them
[57:07] great in number
[57:08] but they sit back and they don't help
[57:10] you out when they're supposed to help
[57:11] you out
[57:12] can i say it like this it's a letdown
[57:16] they let down their family when their
[57:17] family needs the most church you don't
[57:19] want to do that you want to be there you
[57:20] want to drop everything to help out your
[57:22] family if you can
[57:24] praise god
[57:27] i better stop right there uh i'm gonna
[57:29] close with this so i had uh quite a few
[57:31] more slides
[57:33] you had about 20 or 30 more slides but
[57:35] let's close it let's stand our feet
[57:37] don't come up yet malcolm let me read
[57:38] this and then we'll then you could come
[57:39] up
[57:43] yeah i never really know how many slides
[57:45] i'm going to get through you know i
[57:45] really don't know
[57:48] i like this quote i just want to share
[57:50] this quote as we close brother braham
[57:51] says we will recognize our position as
[57:54] the government kind of uh clamps down on
[57:57] us in the united states
[57:58] which we're seeing that all the time
[58:01] like israel back in her promised land
[58:03] she don't know why she got back there
[58:05] she was just automatically put back
[58:06] there why national force
[58:09] put her
[58:10] in her place
[58:13] now i'm going to say something he says
[58:15] now can we line this up with the bible
[58:17] yes revelation 13
[58:20] and also esther and type
[58:23] she was a jewish
[58:25] uh by nature right but then thought to
[58:27] be gentile
[58:29] inward jew
[58:30] outward gentile
[58:32] national force but israel homeland
[58:33] national force will put the church in
[58:35] the world council churches now that
[58:37] assign us that's the church not the
[58:38] bride that's right but the power of god
[58:41] will put the people
[58:42] in the bride praise god
[58:45] see that's why some people don't stay
[58:46] with us because they never let the power
[58:48] of god put them in here amen hallelujah
[58:52] the world forces this way and the world
[58:54] forces that way but god forces upward
[58:58] the spirit of god which is the word of
[59:00] god my word of spirit and life will put
[59:02] the bride in her place
[59:04] so see church see we got to be careful
[59:06] we got to read quotes but we also have
[59:08] to look in the bible too
[59:10] because it's not as i showed you tonight
[59:12] not every quote is from the word of god
[59:15] right
[59:16] most are but not everyone
[59:20] because she'll recognize her position in
[59:22] the word
[59:25] then she's in christ will put her in her
[59:27] place
[59:29] no national force will do it but the
[59:31] national force did drive israel to the
[59:32] homeland the natural forces of the
[59:34] council of churches will drive every
[59:36] organization into it but the power of
[59:38] god will raise the right into glory out
[59:41] of it
[59:43] oh people recognize your day as jesus
[59:45] warned you the sign of sodom and the
[59:47] church's conditions of this day you can
[59:49] stop the livestream maokai come on up
[59:50] let me see if i got that
[59:52] football uh picture when i had the
[59:54] wesleyan naomi on there let's see what
[59:56] was that called
