[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the Lord where they have just feel led to preach on your not so I think during the service continuing this series on here knows best thing I've talked to different ones a very thankful it's been a blessing has been for me as well Joshua chapter 1 there's three times God has to tell Joshua beer now there's one time he has to tell his army here that let's read the first time look Joshua chapter one very similar to that of Gideon you know we preach on getting a few years ago we make reach on that again but I like to look at Joshua helping the Lord your Joshua chapter 1 I like to read at first to Joshua 1 verse 2 some of this is very familiar but Curt I can there's real strength and render their scriptures and seeing yourself in Joshua there's real strength if you're down or defeated or struggling there's real strength in the scripture some of these we're just gonna read out loud because there's power of saying it out loud that's quoting the Word of God word should be nigh us even in our mouths Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people unto the land which I give to them even in the children of Israel let's read verse 3 just first three together ready one two three every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon that I've given unto you I'm going to skip down verse 5 there so not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee what I promise no one's gonna be able to stand before you all the days of your life I would leave that's for you as well man absolutely let's read verse 6 together one two three be strong and of a good courage for unto this people shout out to vie for him one two three only be thou strong and very courageous that that made us observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper with their severed Alcoa so I'm gonna go down the first nine have none I command thee be strong and of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest this is that word prayer he took on our heads don't need on your heart just know you're going to God say Lord take the fear out of my life okay be strong help me to have that success as a Christian help me to be bold let's pray Heavenly Father you see the needs on the heart but I pray you minister to us we need you right now Lord we've sung your songs we've got your promise we love you Lord Jesus now speak to us through thy word help me to get out of your way let the spirit flow Lord this morning more to meet the needs of your people and will rejoice and will be happy and will be strong in the lower to the conclusion of this better Christians that would be came in that door we're grateful for that Lord the victories that we have little by little we're so grateful for them maybe we get a little victory this morning Lord or a major one we give you glory in Jesus Christ in the terrset may God bless you to be in severe appraisal okay it's me Joe over sir I'd like to just briefly use questions and answers I'm gonna set a timer so make sure I don't go to Mel on these I should appreciate pushes answers let's try to do ten minutes by the grace of Lord I got five questions first one is will the beast be a literal visible form at the last battle in Revelation and this person said my understanding is yes my answer is I do not know how so that's what I'm saying I don't know I don't know if the beast is visible to humans during this battle or not I can't say the Beast will be visible to Jesus deceives to Jesus will take that beast and the false prophet and throw them in the lake of fire and just technically the Beast is not at the last battle young and may god it's actually a Armageddon these are the second to last battle just so you know but that's a wonderful question you appreciate that the Beast gets cast like a fire revelation 19 19 to 20 no doubt though the false prophet will be visible to other humans - that's he's the man or hope that holds the office of the Antichrist he was all himself above all that is called God we do know they st. John saw the beasts a ptarmigan by vision great question I don't know visibly remember the beasts no man said is always wrong remember the four beasts of the powers you know so I don't know if that spear of Rome will be visible or not I'm not sure but one thing for sure it'll be visible to Jesus and he'll take care amen I don't know the first question I don't know the answer the first question the second one is boy this is a tough one right good question can a woman divorce her husband if he has had fornication and didn't tell her because we know if a woman doesn't confess she can be put away and he can marry again only the man though it my understanding is no so I agree with this person's question I agree I don't believe she could because it seems Jesus only gave the man a right to divorce remarry her unconfessed fornication program emphasizes that in marriage and divorce if you listen to that he said notice him not her causes him not her and that's because of Eve was the cause of all the Sid she fell she was deceived in the beginning so I agree I don't I do not believe a woman could remarry if that was the case and my man puts this jesus said by saying to us what's whosoever shall put away his wife saying to the common support occasion causes her brother have says not him to commit adultery so it's only him and he said that's because of Christ and the type of the Old Testament one man with many wives now in our day in the New Testament one man cannot have many wives you maybe have one or maybe two if there's none confess said if he's a widower then he could have another wife but it's not like the days of David and Solomon when they had thousands or a thousand or 100 lives and occupies it's not like that and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery here's the exact quote the better but to get this marriage of the most rate up so that you would know which was right which is wrong now he played these shows here in the types there's one Christ and many members that wife notice he can put us away for spiritual fornication with Bob doctrine anytime he wants to my man brother I'm sure at the time the man can put away the woman anytime he wants to he said but how dare you try to put him away what church can put Christ away or divorce Christ none right that's what he's saying that's the type how can we put away Christ and make it the man to put away his wife and marry another one but not the woman to put away her husband and marry another one okay so that's what the problem God teaches us and I know that that's hard I know I don't can't explain everything but that's just God's pattern that's one way to do it see all the shadows and types they're perfectly balanced up not a little bit the man each time that's why I never said anything against the man doing it it's always the woman that's exactly now I want to put this to sisters though to have the option of leaving an ungodly husband the Bible says that thinking but they can never remarry another man while their first husband is alive to understand that like we would like we wouldn't expect a woman who's being abused to stay in that and continue to be abused I don't believe that could be the Spirit of God these heard be abused and bruised that so form like that we couldn't believe that be the Spirit of God if he believed would be wise for her to leave and stay unmarried to anyone because the Bible says this for the woman which had the husband is bound by the law her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed the law of her husband so then if while her husband later she married another man she should be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she's no adulteress though she be married to another man and so here's where the Bible said a woman can lean looking come and eat but a man woman can't marry under every circumstance just fornication and unto the married I command yet not i but the Lord so the Lord is commanding this let not the wife depart from her husband but and if she depart so Paul says she may depart let her remain unmarried so she cannot remarry again if she needs your husband or be reconciled to her husband she has two choices and let not the husband put away his wife as God leads to divorce right now just so you know I firstly though a minister who had a situation like the one this question described he prayed and God felt or felt God gave him permission to allow the woman to remarry and he remarried the woman but I personally do not agree with that decision that wasn't in my situation but I've never been in that situation before so I'm not judging the brother I'm not judging from the obligee that that's my conviction I agree with that question I do not believe a sister [Music] okay every ok with that by God's grace and these may cause more questions so get more questions email me or write on the paper they're happy together third question women cannot preach but can't they have another office in the church women may have the nine Offices of the spiritual gifts they may have any of those nine offices but not church government and preaching offices like the fivefold ministry deacon and trustee they can have the nine offices of spiritual fit that's their office because the Bible said in first Timothy I'm gonna skip down here speaking of a pastor or Bishop for command no ha not know how to rule his own house how she take care of the Church of God so a man is called to take care of the house of God and the Bible said when they call deacons the Bible said they chose seven ministries women I know a lot of churches have deaconesses today but you won't find that the scripture 5/7 a don't want the Holy Ghost 8-minute they were called to be divas and we're looking for some as well feels that a man that who's not even here yet music qualification our bylaws you can yourself I think is do a lot of work like it's beating the floor or traveling to get guest ministers or anything like that any help of any individual the Deacons can use here's where the women can have spiritual gifts you know Philip was an evangelist you had four daughters which to prophesize it so we have four daughters had to get into prophecy under like to be part of that church I would have that be wonderful here the prophecy going to church might that be a special tape praise the Lord and here's our momentum states at plainly the Patmos vision 1961 wanted to know if it was wrong for women to testify over single Jim messages and tongues interpret the messages support a prophecy in the church no it isn't wrong it's as long as it comes is placed in order why don't you see it which are just an order and only way the real true way to do it is for those who speak with tongues I talk about women giving tongues interpretations as we know he said but women are gifted with prophesy and gifted with tongues interpretations and everything but being preachers everything but being preachers they're not to be preachers they're forbidden fruits in the churches that's right to take the place or being a teacher anything in the church but as for gifts a woman has all those how many like that it has all those nine gifts I like that and can occupy one or any of those 19 spiritual gifts according to first Corinthians 12 and it's under no bondage that her message should not come forth in its place praise God Lori you see each message waits portside I talks about how the tongues interpretation have to wait one at a time at most three during a service right then when he's finished at best just begin another then just before it's always ordered but a woman does have the right how many can say mininet a school fourth question do we make eyes on our gross or net income good question I looked up gross and net and I couldn't find any colds are there so here's how I live my life I'm just letting you know this is hardly remember the pastor's the examples of the flock so you can choose the column example or not it's up to you but the Bible said their pastors are given for it and sample under the I paid eyes on my gross income and then I pay offering from each paycheck because we're not to rob god of ties or offerings the church said so gross is your mouth before taxes there's a certain amount that's a it's a thousand dollars before tax let's say you take over 700 your net is your 700 you take home the gross should be the thousand and I believe a ties on gross is most scriptural because Jacob said of all that you give me I'll surely give a tenth unto deep so in my situation if I only paid taxes on my net income or my take-home pay I would be neglecting to honor God for the increase or money that was taken out for my retirement money take it out for my retirement and I have money take it out for our 403 - forum 401k for the Viacom so I think it'd be wrong for me there's 10 minutes let me do - I think it'd be wrong for me not to give God and not to hire God for all that money that's going to retirement if I understand that I feel like that be wrong how can I not honor God on them finding money that I made for retired or the money that I'm storing up in my 403b account how could I not honor God with that so that's my personal conviction you know I would encourage you to do limits on your growth I'm sorry gross income so since I pay tithe on the gross I do not make ties on my income tax return because I already paid ties on that income but if I pay guys only on the net which some people might do then you should be cheerful to make eyes on your income tax return as well because if I always say that God loves a cheerful Giver doesn't like a stubborn giver right either that's not pleased with that he loves a cheerful Giver I'm open to any questions on that if anybody has any questions the last questions I got that's pretty good time why is it okay to wear neck a necklace but not earrings very good question I thought this was a fantastic question I've got this question you know on YouTube and I've had to go back in Scripture I got emails on this question great question biblically necklaces or jewelry are fine as long as they're not very costly the Bible said we're only not to wear costly if you look that up in first Timothy women invented out to be ordained with the costly things right in a parable Jesus told how the prodigal is given a ream so Jesus went one us you know to avoid wearing rings if he gave a story in which a man was given a ring and there was a big scar he was the problem he was one for giving you one coming home so we know it's not a sin to wear jewelry some people major on a minor some people go all out and say oh you wear a wedding ring you know you're condemned yeah all these things to be wearing necklace you know your unholy you know but that's wrong there's no scripture for that they asked brother Brandon program should a Christian woman wear simple Jewry as necklaces or pearls well sister I know this means a lot to you I know it means a lot for me that's right for me for you to place your confidence I tell you the truth now remember the Bible said when you adore you're not adorned with costly jewels and pearls and all kinds of wearing the jewelry let that be the dawning of a peace and quiet and a meek spirit which I just sorted which is a great price lord I don't mean by that system that if you got a pin now this is me not the Lord if you got a pin that you underwear or a little necklace your husband get your maybe or something like that it's you are not to me I don't think that's best now that just mean I remember I make myself clear that's my opinion but I think it's the approach to it it's the way you do it see the motive behind it and when you see it's getting a hold of you then leave the thing alone so he says later how does get a hold of you through pride so wearing jewelry or necklaces becomes an issue of pride he said let it alone here's where he says it if women want to dress and make themselves a decent clean lady like Mike I think there's not a thing to that to me but when you get you're going to put that thing into making it a little pride then you're wrong it's your attitude about it so if somebody comes in here with you know a big old necklace on or man comes in with a big old Reynaud they thinking something well that's wrong that's prideful right it's not the outward adorning that God's interested in it's the in order to know Ramsey says excuse me for the next quote but he kind of makes a little joke but I just want to read it so you understand I think as far as a necklace now if you go loading yourself up like he went for the 10 step store down there with the magnet on that's kind of a little silly expression so yeah so much yo so much jewelry on everywhere you know he said I don't think that'd be right because he then says you wanna and then he says it's like a woman in a 10-cent store he said a woman that puts too much jewelry on is like she's trying to be young and be something that she's not and he said you can't go through life looking through a rear-view mirror trying to be young when you're when you're older okay now bands did see Christians don't do that a Christian don't try to be what he used to do and then he talks about not forgetting those things so he basically is with women how many women are meant while want to look like they're younger younger so they put on all the jewelry to feel younger so I don't think that only you know matters to our church you might say I don't see that myself but I think that answers the question part of it now here's the last part now concerning earrings and this if I taught Sunday school laughter I think John was ever I taught it in the sunday school biblically concerning earrings there are some earrings that godly women wore that seemed to not displease God so if you type in earrings in your concordance you're gonna find times where godly women actually more earrings and so one was Rebecca Elise or gave Rebecca earrings and rings and all kinds of things bracelets and all kinds of things that's why there's a balance to wearing jewelry and God's on Israel you know what I will drown in the blood member that I found in the blood and I pulled you out and I watched you he said I put earrings upon you so that's quite a scripture and that shocked me whenever I just always thought over against all earrings you know we're just all against that but see these earrings that they wore these earrings right that Rebecca and God would have spiritually placed on Israel could not have been ones that shed blood or put a mark on the human body like the all if you look up all its annexes 21 6 and Deuteronomy 15 17 if a slave wouldn't go free and said well I don't want to be free I'll take my possessions back I just want to be a slave my whole life they take the person down to the altar and they put up all through his ear they bore a hole so that's a sign of but man that's a sign of not being able to hear the gospel anymore you can't vote freedom or your slave you're totally trapped you can never go free you understand that so God would that you know God was not a that or maybe bless that and then allow them allow you know hold the air to be a sign of someone you know who's a godly person it's a sign of someone who's rejected the truth of the gospel you know someone who is afraid to take their inheritance that's what it's a sign up and recall God prohibited markings on the flesh God remember that Leviticus 19:28 that's why we don't have tattoos so the earrings that Rebecca war or the earrings that you know God spiritually with a place on Israel would not have caused a mark and would not have shed blood because that's what slaves had that's kind of hearings slaves had a modern era earring would leave a mark even a hold the person's ear just like the description of the hall brother Graham told us that the modern day hearing symbolized worldliness and men a person would not hear the truth of the gospel preachers so there's a quote on that you so remember when the Jubilee come and the priest rode his trumpet sounding that every say to go free but if they refuse to accept their freedom and had to be taken to the temple to a post and at all borac him through the ear and then he served as master always it was put on his ears a type of hearing faith cometh by hearing he heard that trumpet but he didn't want to listen to it thanks a lot so then he if anybody have any questions you know feel free to get back to me by God's grace and so this is I say this you know if somebody comes in here and wears it to the pond hearing I can't do them that you know that's kind of the mail that would be my personal basket so we come in here become a new believer so I believe the best brother Jesse I wear clip-on earrings I'd say well premise of our what can I say against that Rebecca wore earrings I don't know if they hung on her ear I don't know if they win side were your know down I don't know what they look like but we can't condemn all earrings because Rebecca wore some in the Old Testament but they would not have been blood shedding earrings and would not have been earrings that left a mark everybody see the balance by God's grace by Madison where does every scripture where's that answer to every rm2 program said in the Bible so Bible you said is the end of all arguments I don't believe that the Bible is the end of all arguments so we're trying to rightly divide the word so I fifty twenty minutes on that forgive me I'm gonna try to shorten my sermon here by God's grace let's look at you're not Joshua so I'm gonna try to get back in the free team load if I can from teaching to preaching but a lot of questions and programs had a pastor loves to know it's on the hearts of the people he loves to know their questions alright so I like to look at this I found this little sunday-school picture here I have a bigger picture later but let's look at a fear not Joshua I remember we preached three sermons on fear so far as this is our horse sermon on beer but I'm just giving them individual titles you know so maybe I might help you remember a little more help me remember other than just part one part two or three the greatest hindrance to the American Christian by the man have said was fear I'll remember that from Wednesday you hopefully caught that if you weren't here will be caught it by listening to it during the sermon or after some time the rest of the week that's the greatest hindrance that brother branham said it's that doubt of thinking well should I try quoting the word or not should I take God at His Word or not my man I've traveled the world and when I see the biggest trouble with American Christians is fear they're scared that God won't keep his word not what I thought but member mannan also says Jesus always said fear not so when we go to God in prayer when we read the Bible when we're serving the Lord Jesus or were coming across a situation where we have to make a decision are we gonna pray are we gonna speak the word how are you approach the situation we must remember that Jesus will always say fear not and we must remember that we are in a very advanced intellectual society and this society will deny the power thereof they'll have a form of godliness but denying the power there I mean how many can see that by God's grace there's this nation has a form of godliness they go to church your circus religious acts when they deny the power where's the power leg power the power of the gospel lies in your faith praise God because Saint John says that your victory is your faith they met I literally and perfect case casts out all fear hallelujah so we know it's the greatest hindrance you and I must overcome fear praise God no I just want to show a few maps this is the first map I have another map now today I'm just going to preach a little bit on this Joshua a a story and I'll have to finish it maybe tonight or taking tonight of Oscar people that are here preach on the Book of Revelations live the notes on that ready to preach on that but Joshua come to the land and there were so many Canaanites now King Valley is a name that was used for individual people but it was also a general name given to anyone who'd lived in Palestine at that time so you have to kind of find that and balance that in the scripture but there was many different peoples many different acts we'd say in Palestine and this is just one map now today I'm going to preach on the seven nations that God said Joshua conquer okay and it's not eat of mites I'll tell you what visit is not and it's not the Philistines it's not to Moabites but all the other seven I believe are the ones I'm gonna preach on today by the grace of the Lord amen here's another picture you can see the hits I bikes the tights dirty strikes eight nights parasites nearby excu tonight - Jim cites border tykes em rights and other fifties they weren't listed they were not listed in the portion of Scripture I'm gonna read okay but no doubt they fought against the folks who turned out they're very formidable foe [Applause] amen so I'd like to now look at a few things here I want to just review a few thoughts here last year I mean I preached on if you remember I preached on the Asian parallels Joshua I'm not sure who remember that but I didn't preach at Lent by the grace of the Lord so the book of Joshua it parallels the book of Ephesians because Joshua we know was the first generation to take the promised land they're the first generation to cross over Jordan and possess all the promises and all the inheritance that God had for them I'm glad to be in the Joshua army today are you man said there's a Joshua outfit today are you part of that outfit amen I don't know I'm very thankful to be a part of that outfit today then Joshua outfit and Joshua place them physically in a physical end but the book of Ephesians places Christians spiritually in a spiritual condition such as you're seated in heavenly places in Christ Jesus Amen you have a spiritual seat you have a spiritual throne you have a spiritual Kingdom you rule as a king and priest am I to understand that you rule as a king you rule over your the sin of your members you rule or you're supposed to rule over spiritually over your situation that you're home and and all things like that you're supposed to rule over the evil spirits and so we see that to a pure type there and taking the land is the type both the individual going into the baptism of Holy Ghost and also the entire church so a type state Church going in the promised land and I thought it was interesting a few months ago today the Lord had me preach on Kadish party and separately member that when we preach that done the judgment seat is the house of God how she died as the judges remember that and run down to the mansion Radek a discard yes I thought I was but we know every Church must come to a Kadish Barnea are they gonna cross over into the baptism of the holy ghost and possess every puff promise and find their spiritual position in Christ I'm not going to ask anybody to raise their head but jerk we should have a button on our heart to know the position God has for us Amen man the adopted spiritual mature position God has for us we should have a burden though that in fact the Bible calls it a mystery in Ephesians 1 it's the mystery of us will for your life everybody should be confessing and and praying for that Lord showed me the perfect will of my life that I could be at the center of your will amen Gloria and I want to remind you the program says the Holy Ghost is a type of the promised land and so I'm going to be emphasizing this over this type here is for those who have already gone through sanctification they've already gone through the statute would permit head once they've done that now they cross Jordan that crossing Jordan it's tight in tight as the baptism of the Holy Ghost or charity amen you've crossed in the Jordan and so now we're gonna bring out these seven nations and the I'm gonna call these golden nuggets amen I gots great so we're going back to scripture reminds us go to duckets and shine them up praise God and see the scriptural truth course amen hallelujah so I think where you're at is brother Graham tells us this he can say aren't you glad you serve the kind of God we serve you can know exactly where you are with him at any time and all the time how the who you even believe that if you're on the stache burger man and you're in sanctification still just a justification you can know exactly where you stand with God or if you're into the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the land you can know exactly where you stand you can know your position because God wants us to know we're called to do yes should I listen to as I was with Moses so I'll be with you 1860 I believe September 10 1960 and brother man tells us his position he said I got out of position he says I'm just paraphrasing I got out of position because I was majoring on the signpost remember that he said he would let people pull gifts and put his sermons out of him over until he almost lost his energy and I he said you think God would do that he said you think God would let a man brother man drive in a car away from a meeting almost crazy him and lost his mind and not even know where is that he said that was not God doing that to a man he said that was me being disobedient to my commission and the church said mother would let he love people so much he would let them go to sermons ah there's so much they had to pull him off the booklet you know that he's seen that that the Pappas showed her and he if he wasn't careful he keep let it going all the time all the time all the time and he wouldn't even know he said he said one time the brothers would have to walk him out in the street at three or four in the morning and he'd say oh I'm going home then I'm no got a meeting tomorrow brother Graham he said no I'm going home I got a kid oh my god you know my wife hurt doing these things he didn't even know her is that he said God would not do that to a person so I mean Oh God won't wear you out I mean understand that remember that preacher his name was it Nelson the man who said I'm kind of a word of Lord for pastor Nelson he's gonna have a heart attack if you don't slow down God doesn't want us to overwork ourselves now we say that all the time I'd rather wear out or wear out and rust out right but at the same time of Jesus when he was tired what'd he do he went up into the mountain to rest and pray amen so there's a balance to that there's a very good balance I probably have said I got out of my position if you read listen that's real close all the way through even in the prayer line he starts talking about he keeps going back and forth back to his Commission and he said I got my eyes off the Commission and I was just staring at the signpost the discernment discernment the sermon and he sent from henceforth I'll go out and I won't let everybody just pull these out he said I just got to get my eyes back on the Commission the Commission was pray for this stick amen be sincere get the people to believe you and not even cancer most ever before your prayer amen he said I find you know getting that back of my position and never there was prophecy on that his brother Graham said there's a prophecy the tabernacle week before it said within eight days you'll be standing like Moses and Joshua in this tabernacle and what did he say he said and he says now I'm like Joshua he said I'm not gonna I'm not going to look back at the second pole anymore wandering the wilderness I'm going into the third pole sorry I know I said a lot right there but maybe I need to reach a whole sermon on that but what I'm saying I've got the going he said like Joshua I got to go to the third Pole I spent too much time at the signpost discernment let people you misused my gift I misuse my gift I've got to go into the third pole and look George he's 50 years old and he's still finding his right position in God and he says and you can let this up he said I'm finally at the center of God's will how many appreciates the humility of God's prophets he was so humble at 50 years old to say listen I've been out of God's will slightly for a little while because I've been letting people pull too much on my discernment yet now if a prophet search them like we say if a prophet slightly God position and for years and years was worn down and hurt and hurt himself by his own decisions and eat us right now from the Holy Spirit how about the rest of us from our prophets amen see why this is important it's very important for years and years and years it was out of position and hurting himself and not in the perfect position but God straightens him out if you listen to that as I wasn't with Moses Church you and I can know exactly where we stand with God at any time Lord abide the promised land am I still fighting off nations until I get in the promised land or I'm sorry am I in the pride of my day The Bachelor dose but not quite in my position yet because I'm still battling or have I like halo have I reached my mom and I'm living off the mountain and I'm victorious we can know exactly where we stand with God some of us might have to go back in the same vacation which is fine well I don't have really emerged I don't the virtue strength to really live the life in front of my co-workers and my family compromise on this favor to knowledge they understand you know cut their hair I understand these things you know we God is so merciful he wants us to know exactly where we sit and Church you and I and know where we stand with God at any time the Prophet said I believe that because the Bible said he made known to us the mystery of his will so brothers ask me I think we're at ministers meeting or I'm not sure when some brothers asked me a few years ago they said where are you at the staff room and I said well I believe I'm in charity and I obviously be not being adopted and I was saying that humbly I honestly felt that because when you're adopted your word is just as good as his word you're an adopted son and you only say what the father would say and the example I gave as a pastor and at that time I was seeing a lot of great feedback from the preaching you know your your accurate you know and I still do many times I'm thankful for that I still do but I told the brothers I said you know what I preach when I come out of that office I preach I see God talking to the people and people come up for prayer and things that I don't know and that proves to me that I'm speaking God's Word and not mine I'm not leading people to sit now I might back up now and say well maybe I'm just fighting off maybe I'm not correctly positioned placed or maybe I would close to my land but I'm still maybe I'm in my lamp but not fully there yet even I might say that you know as I think more about it but the point is we need to know our office like remember the women have the nine gifts and also a woman is a fifth gospel they have that position to do there's all kinds of positions the thing is we can understand where God's called us and we can be at the very center of as well forget the very center very sad not slightly off to the left slightly off to the right but that the very Center of his will doing exactly what your call to dude and you are seated in heavenly places you're ruling over sin the devil lusts in the world how many one live there I would live there like I told those brothers I personally feel there and I've got to keep driving out the rest of it I know Satan might come and fight me but you know what I gotta have a possession I gotta fight somebody you know I got we always have to fight somebody have some battles and if I didn't see the work of God in my life I wouldn't believe that when I see the work of God now right now that's a whole lot there and none of that was in my note so forgive me brother Hansen justification segregation that facility goes justification was leaving Egypt sanctification was the desert and The Bachelor ghost was crossing Jordan Amen now I'm just got the skip on a lot here because this is a review I want to get to the golden nuggets and I believe they're going nuggets I hope they're a blessing to you now one of the reason program preach this the adoption message about Ephesians parallel Nostrum he said now this is my purpose of preaching this the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner but don't you do that you can never raise horn in Ephraim's corner if you're monastic you got to take your place in Christ positionally place it he talks about out if somebody's a preacher somebody wants to be like a preacher or somebody is a singer someone will be like a singer they want to be like somebody else rather than being what God called you to be about that said I know your position in Christ you can do what you say you have whatever gift you have you can do it that's how you know Amen that's how you know so the purpose behind him preaching about you know taking the Holy Ghost or taking the promised land was so everybody can find their position and happily serve God Amen that's what we want Church we want everybody Rider Christ fellowship to happily serve God in and hanging on every word get God's instruction service after service and overcome Satan little by little and get all the victories God has undermined a minute you shouldn't be defeated we should be more than conquerors in Christ hallelujah to know our position that's why everybody has to have a pastor God doesn't want us wandering around to services all the time I've watched people wander from church to church to church and even to this church and they're so unstable and their home is always on a border arguments between husband and wife and children rebellious and no suggestions the Word of God and then certain sins like gossip or pride or lust or certain things they're just rampant because they're not in their position and God told Joshua everybody needs their position everybody needs their place amen I know one brother particular tried to preach for a while that group tried to sit the leak Psalms that fell through and then of course he doesn't go to this church and tried to all these things all these things that never confide his position because he's understanding was just floating from here to there the Bible calls that a wandering star we're not to be wandering star boat ramps and we need to find our position in God's economy and God's astronomy and stay there and shine the light of Christ amen Oh hallelujah now I got a whole lot and I'm not to be able to get into a whole lot so let me just keep going quickly then we'll get to these seven nations Joshua program said times two things Joshua types the Holy Ghost but man said that's an adoption part one he said Joshua Jesus our Savior Josh represents the Holy Spirit representing it in the spiritual as it was the natural he's our great warrior today he's our leader how do the Holy Spirit's our leader today he's our Joshua but then remember and pick up your pen and write the Holy Spirit play said pick up your pen writes and that the endtime leader to the seven churches would be the Joshua represented Joshua that took the people in and all those that followed Joshua were type of Caleb a man or the anti-type of Caleb on this video so the Holy Spirit says pick up your pen write the entire messengers Joshua all those that follow Josh for brother grant are caleb amen I like that so you and I remember we could have got this power he said is it my turn yet is it my turn I'm ready where's my Mountain Moses promised me a mountain give me my brother Joshua said then you go fight for it he was ready for a fight he was ready to take on the devil he wasn't scared of temptation he wasn't scared of sin he was ready to fight he was ready to be a victory man that's what we need in our church so every church needs people that are ready to fight people that are ready to quote the Word of God and live on the Word of God amen remember he had a different spirit Caleb had a different spirit and all the other ones Nathan yeah the Holy Spirit praise God he was a Gentile right he was Oh get strong praise God no matter how long this Lord tarries no matter how old we get we can be strong and thanks amen exactly right now I don't have time to go through this I'm having to hit the highlights why did God drive out the Canaanites there's many reasons but one of the reasons it is that this cup of their iniquity had come to being full that's in Genesis 15 verse 16 God told Abraham your people are going to go to Egypt I'm gonna call them out but I'm not going to call them out yet outside for 400 years and then when the cup of iniquity am righteous fall then I'm gonna drive them out God was so gracious and I believe that was over 800 years when I was eight hundred nine hundred years you're Abraham all the way to Joshua I feel look grow quick anybody want me to look no okay our coupon so this is like 800 900 years Abraham god code and number God is so merciful isn't he number Wednesday night for the camera sure that massages your cams revelation with me Jesus told the church age about your church age I'm giving you space to repent jessabelle and he repented not it was almost 900 years of mercy God extended mercy to the Jezebel system here's 900 years our God is so tremendous no that's Americana the tremendous his strength never faileth this mercy endureth forever he is Jezebel and the potpourri of these wicked folks he gives him 900 years to repair their Crusades and the Inquisition he's still offering the hand of her penance our God is so wonderful amen I don't know how to say no words to express any men but he's so wonderful and so God gave the em rights this say bop bop same amount of time that was one reason I program said don't you worry the goddess evil age God is waiting to the iniquity of these modern amirite s-- is fulfilled don't worry he'll have his Moses ready for the third Exodus a man which is Christ a then Moses times Christ that's from the God is evil ladies so what are we waiting for oh is it the church's fault well I don't know I can't put any condemnation of the church because there's no kind of nation under great Jesus it's not the church's fall it's God king merciful it's God giving salvation still account that the long-suffering Lord is salvation glory I feel like a preacher this morning amen that's exactly right he's waiting on these modern memorized to get their cup of iniquity filled up and then he's just in destroying this birth and burning it over he's not just yet there has to be more have to reject him or reject him more but while they're rejecting the more brother Hammond I'm accepted in Laura Nariman my life is being more centered around the Word of God I believe me more of the word I'm possessed see Martha promised land and if I would Joshua I can a man hide Amelia exactly right look in the scripture I want you to notice this I don't have time but I have to preach a whole other message I guess hate you now like I study so hard and I study for so many hours and my notes are like this long on a computer I just want to preach it all in one show not doing that because I feel like I'm leaving something out but you need you know I love you I want you to be strong to overcome exodus 20:3 that you said my angel go before me 23:23 and bring thee into the land of the hammerites the hittite as parasites Canaanites Hittites Jebusites and I will cut them off thou shall not bow down to their gods nor serve them nor do after their works so what is God gardens enough because of their idolatry their evil works now look at verse 29 X is 23 29 I will not drive them out before thee in 1 year I just want to remind us of then when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you're really in the Holy Ghost your problems are not gonna vanish you one year because that's the tight God wants you and I to learn how to fight off pesky demons pesky habits that will go away and the church said Amen I want you and I to learn how to drive them out little by little is the first 30 cents by little and little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be increased and inherit the land thou shall make no covenant with them nor with their gods now shall not dwell in my land unless that makes it they make these sit against me now in Deuteronomy 18 verse 19 God tells us why he's going to drive them out again he said because of their abominations now should I not learn to do after the abominations of those nations throughout 1810 there shall not be found among you anyone that making this son or daughter to pass through the fire or the use of divination or an observer of times or an enchanter or witch or a charmer Orcas consulted with premier spirits or a wizard or necromancer for all these two things are an abomination of the Lord and because of those abominations the LORD thy God won't drive an opera before CA then why does God try these nations out because they're living in sin they're killing their own babies they're worshipping idols they're having sexual immorality and gods that I'm going to try them out because of their disregard for my word I've given them 900 years repent and they failed to repent and now their cups full and I'm driving them out before you so this wasn't legal Assad wasn't mean legalistic with these people I could talked about right God mrs. Gossett when we preach our standards God's even asking us to be Legolas he's telling us to do things because it'll protect us and help us to love him and honor him praise God you watch your life church just let go in one area like just let go with cigarettes start smoking again or whatever drinking again you watch what happens to your life just let one thing just start lying a little bit and keep lying to watch your life watch how low you fall are with me Church watch although God doesn't give us these standard are you just excited you just get your daughter's ear pierced with blood and you just watch your family's life watch it you sister just cuts your hair a little bit I can show you churches that they let that happen for 30 years and tell you the awful testimonies that come out of that right you just compromise a little you swear a little bit of makeup and watch that little turn into a big pretty soon it'll just flooding and you won't have any control because you give the devil an inch he'll take a mile if I will said neither give place to the devil it's the little foxes that swung by why can't I get my turn everybody can I show the fruit little foxes are spoiling your virus and when the Word of God boy he's trying to protect us he's not trying to harm us with these things about you know make up in here incident and in shorts and pants oh he's not trying to harm us he's trying to protect us we won't go in the promised land with those types of things look at Deuteronomy 20 verse 18 he probably twenty eighteen but man warns them about these seven nations that they teach you not to do with all their abominations which they have done in their gods so should ye sit against the Lord so whenever you let a little Synod it's going to teach you to compromise again I talked to numerous drug addicts lately as soon as they let one in of cocaine or crack or meth as soon as they let wanted it opens the floodgates for all the others one and then they learn to open themselves up there's so much more and I don't very you know sweet people that are addicted to drugs and don't think they can overcome when you're fasting hard this week people are not mistaken that don't get victory over these addictions they're so powerful and Jesus said if you get one demon off you but don't get it filled with the Holy Ghost seven more will come back now you gotta Center now you've got complete oppression I say like that because seven is a number of completion just one being on a person is awful well if they don't get victory over that and then let that come back in don't be completely possessed in some way in their lives with me we can't compromise on one thing and we don't want you we want to be thankful for the land that we have we were to keep God's Word and we want to be faithful with God's harness with you we want to hear it all God's promises but we got to try them out we've got something to do McGriff said god I could have took a broom and he after that up Egypt he could have took that groom and he said he could have swept out all the inhabitants and said here you go here's all your food here's all your houses he could have took out the broom and swept at all but my dad said God doesn't want to do that because he wants you and I to learn how to fight the goodbye Hey he wants us to learn how to be like him praise the Lord he was supposed to be adopted children to know it what the Father's Word said and know how the father would have it he wants us to be real sugar that act just like the father glory to you thank you Jesus Exodus 34 10 through 17 says the same thing he was he talks about how break down their altars at verse 13 break down their images cut down their groves do not let the nuts and now and do not take of their daughters under thy sons and daughters go whoring after their gods don't leader marry with them penis because you'll learn to live like them praise God how many thank over the power of the Holy Spirit now God I'm gonna finally gonna try to close the Nexus let me set a time of 15 minutes it's really something mercy I got so much yeah I just you know I just want to preach it all to you you've been blessed so far but in Georgia where God told Joshua three times did not fear these seven nations now I'm not going to go through those all but I want to read a few scriptures let's all go to turn around 7 1 let's all go there dude around you step 1 you got your Bibles and then we'll get to these types and I'll finish there that's gold by God's grace I love the word church the more I get to the Word of God the more I love the more you and I get into it the more will open up the more you eat the Word of God the more will come from from milk into meat it depends how much you eat on it right because if you're just a beginner I just got a little time to work it just like milk to you but if you have more more of it receive it becomes meteor meteor now that you can handle more yes Deuteronomy 7 1 when the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither thou goest to possess it and has cast out many nations before thee now listen you're 7 the Hittites the girgashites and the Amorite the canaanites at the Perizzites the Hivites and the Jebusites and notice God said seven nations greater and mightier than now so these were not pushover nations these are not third world country armies these are greater aren't worth and medication we're like the spirits we're like we're like the third world country right Israel's like the throne country we're going to get seven nations greater and mightier than you now this is after you get the Holy Ghost the church dead this is the type you go into the promised land and now if you've got to drive up seven nations and it will all happen at once but year by year you've got to serve God faithfully keep the word meditate it in your mind speak the words write out the inhabitants and if you do you'll try about seven nations or demons greater and mightier than you are amen because Satan we are nomads forsaken but we got one inside of us who's greater than safety razors he lives in us the Holy Ghost in our flesh that's in the world event I'm Olivia we're known as for Saint we're known as for these set of demons but with the Holy Ghost we've got the word and powering that exactly right now let me just get to this here Joshua 3:10 I'm gonna read out of my Bible if you got it you can read it too I'm just going to get this because I this is a thought I had I just water free so hope you like me just by God's grace I haven't typed me I'm gonna do how to tighten in the next few minutes as we close I got 12 minutes mature I think I'll be done in a minute Joshua 3:10 and Joshua said hereby he shall know that the Living God is among you and that he will without fail dried out from before he the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Hittites and the parasites and the girgashites and the amorite and the gender sex now this is right after they cross Jordan and God tell Jeremiah or sir Joshua tells the army Joshua tells the army God's gonna drive them up God had already sent this in Exodus and Deuteronomy he already listed these seven nations he's insane years now and finally they get the spot for the atom where now it's time to fight these demons now most is talking about it for years the proper governor talked about it for years but now you and I are gonna drive them out amen in other words just know it's not time to talk about anymore it's time to do it it's not time to just have same to have faith now it's time for you to show me your faith by your works out of India we don't want to talk about maybe something that maybe something now is the day to fight and so you can fight the first one that God leads you to fight now I don't have the order yet we've spent studying on the seven names of these seven nations so let's look at this now remember recall it at seven means completion so God is going to give them a complete victory in the days of Joshua now you'll find out later of course that not all that were driven out Hey but all those that God wanted to be driven out were driven out and Josh was listed as a faithful minister at the end of all this use a faithful prophet so he drove out killed or subdued all that God called him to do could he have gone more yes he could have but God was saving that time after David and Solomon sin and then also typeset no matter how victorious we are no matter how many decades I served in the message and serve Jesus Christ and all they say no matter how to live it goes I'll still have somebody to fight how do they get in other words that sin nature is always going to be inside of us and we'll always have to keep sin nature under control by the Holy Spirit and the church said so see it means completion there's seven days duration seven seals seven angels that maturity seven trumpets planes my house seven means completion so God in tight ladies it when the first believer goes in the promised land you've got you got to get a complete victory can I say like that you got to get complete victory how many want complete victory by the grace of God you're going to fight but we can do it okay here's the seven nations again I'm going into order that Joshua listed them in verse 10 I'm chapter 3 I'm going in this morning I'm sorry Katie likes Hittites invites parasites dirty shags a mind now each one I can preach a sermon on or a series on and you'll see one of them one of them are right now on preaching one series right now on one of these it's the king I'm sorry sorry fifth guru Sikes Emirati Chosun let's start with Canaanites now I'm taking their names or their occupations and I'm typing them spiritually my grandma calls that a golden nugget when you take somebody from the Old Testament shine it up and look at the types and applying with Christ today he said that's a golden number and he loved to shine those up lowered the word Canaanite means a trader or merchant they live by the sea by the coast of Jordan Canaanites were the sons of ham and he was the curse son of Noah the word Canaanite sometimes refers to any non-israeli person in Palestine they dwell in the richest most important parts of Palestine their cities were the centres of great commercial activities so Canaanites light riches worldly possessions the love of money these were the richest of all the inhabitants and they must be driven out how many would say as it ends as a witness of this sermon that even though you think you got that you believe you got the Holy Ghost you still have to drive out the love for money anybody say that well then you're pretty then you're pretty special that virtually the Canaanites were the richest device of the riches they were the richest they're the traitors the merchants they handled the future possessions and gotta go Joshua drive those Canaanites out you're gonna have to fight and you're gonna fight little by little your love for money or your worries about money your tears about money they might not go away in one here but he's driving they're not and pretty soon you'll get that victory over the hay you won't be able to pay your tithes and offerings the right way you'll be able to do all this where to give to the poor you have all these things really a child Joshua if you're really okay up you'll try about those Canaanites amen good now we know time to read this like I said I can do a whole sermon on this the riches love of money but I just hit the highlights love out the world in things in the world we could go through that right all deals with pride of life so canonize represent traders merchants worldly possessions riches worldly things how many other Lord this is 5 so set up our lens that would have reached on Wednesday because that would everybody to hear it because it gave me new insight into my walk with the Lord wonder sister Wendy why I gotta struggle with money er well I got it look at these next ones why I got struck with fear and the Bible later right their fear was lame the promised land they had to drive it out hey not before the promise that in the promised land not in sanctification but in the baptism of the Holy Ghost Hittites and I can share this with you just by a quickie now if you wanted afterwards Hebrew this actually means descendants of half-half was a son of cainan remember the curse on ham right I'm sorry the curse of ham ham was the curse will now look at this church isn't this powerful this is why I'm so excited half means terror or fear in Hebrew they had to drive out the terror or the Hittites in their promised land and I've been preaching on the spirit of fear and God has not given us the spirit of fear for the power sounds like jumping in my heart like hi this is powerful these are golden nuggets we could preach a whole series on the Canaanites a whole series we are preaching office agree on the Hittite holiday we got they must be driven out how many believe that they live in the vicinity I look where they live in the vicinity of Heffron which is in the south of Jerusalem by 20 miles Efron was where Abe reverse went after separated from lot and that's where he had association or communion with God so fear was taking the place of communion with God coming on that when you're all fearful to scare you don't have the communion with God that we need may God drive out the fear before we have communion next Sunday amen that's where they live and so Joshua the army oh that's right I all the fear out of heaven I'm not in their communion with God in other words we have bonus of the Damned judgment amen we are with the right we are with Christ we are saved and we can beat both of the day of judgment because we know where we come from and we know where we're going amen so his eyesight fear that hinders our fellowship with God let me know as a baptized Holy Ghost filled Saint you still gotta battle fear and have communion with God I don't know that this is still effective actually this stuff like me absolutely fear what if I preaches who body the church I got battle fear what if I do this to my children what's gonna happen one what if I say this is what if I try to teach this what's gonna happen what if I tell somebody at work about the message if I get get fired on this fear but fear must be driven out Amen or else we'll never possess the land like we ought to and of course we you know through all these scripture if your hands Foreman perfect love casts out fear now I got a lot more on that I got a lot more preached on fear so you might be ministering on nevela more by God's grace okay so so far we got riches and we got fear how many believe those are real enemies to the Holy Ghost baptized Saint and church I'm not making all this up I can show you the quote in fact I'll share this with Rohit Shetty's that brother you know that to me I want to preach that he said I'm not a teacher but that's really good teach us it was the Holy Spirit it's the Holy Spirit giving us the Word of God that we need here buddies now this is one Hittites the actual Hebrew word means villager it means at the sending of came the son of ham they dwelt five miles from Jerusalem's leader even closer than the the hit Titus now look here max we're actually the Gibeonites of Joshua 10 did you know that I never knew that guy stood up the Hittites were actually the Gibeonites they lived in the area or thought of Gideon which is right there around and remember the city and places of giving was greater than ai ai was this huge place where they failed because they had consent but then overcame akin overcome estate the best of sin right this was giving was bigger than hey I was huge it was a massive place of villagers now the Gibeonites when they do Church so I'm looking at what they did to tighten this one because their name doesn't type it out mr. chairman the Gibby nice to see Joshua and Israel into a false League of peace or friendship in order to save their lives and God in our D commandeth don't make any lead with anybody the Promised Land to see the first mistake was aided seekers City somebody the church didn't confess their sin the second one was the leadership made a mistake Joshua why why she says Joshua made the oath the leadership made a little mistake right that must mean to kill Joshua and just repent move on right you're right we got so I believe this him I spent I'd friendship or adultery with the world also types compromising I'm never battled a compromising spirit forever battle friendship with the world the Bible said the friendship with the world is a Haitian with God this is for the believer who's already in the promised land remember Bellucci reward number saw us all three water yet he was saved right lost to Oscar or David could have stopped was so much more and he not polit adultery he reached the pinnacle that he felt he never reached it again of the sword never left from his house the rest of his days he never got back to where he was because he had friendship with the world this case friendship with adultery for if this parasite so how many time I got I got one minute I'm not gonna finish my minute give me five more I know you love me because you bear with me they could eat every take each measurement let's reset your mind that's cool all the time every set our minds know focus it gives you a refreshing in your mind your spirit parasites in Hebrew means belonging to a village they inhabited southern Canaan parasites were farmers and peasants though I put a little question mark up this one I'm high so what I mean is it wasn't exactly clear it was a little bit of a stretch but bear with me some of you have to service my government tell me some good scriptures parasites work the earth and there's very little Scripture record and that's all that said about David there were workers of the earth but remember so I put a question mark I'm not like the other ones are clearly can see the clear about their so clear this seems to represent her as I seen the represent the green fleshly or carnal because Cain worked the earth he brought an offering from the earth the serpent would lick the dust of the earth earthly things carnal things the one talent man went in in his god-given gift where in the earth and forgot about it so the earth represents bearing son represents worthiness and bearing what God has given to you and forgetting about it represents forgetting about the plan of God because you're you're so worldly minded what about the first thing that bought a piece of ground that's the excuse me was suffer because it was ground ground the earth these were just farmers so parasites had carnal worldly minded people that have spiritual amnesia like that first man with the town went buried his down there if he forgot he was a a possessor of the Kings money he forgot I'm a possessor on the promise of God I forgot I'm a possessor of a gift of God I've got a gift of God and I've got it invest in it if I don't invest in it the earth was swallowed it up god help us to know that our gifts be swallowed up in the earth and that's all through the scripture oh that could preach a whole sermon on that and all and this is a portion where he talks about being carnal you got stripes and envies and divisions among you and some of you say you're a pawn some of apollos see that pride there to that Berrien things of the earth when they bury therapies into they'd love to give the godly arm and they went back to being Cardinal they just had thoughts that were earthly thoughts instead of heavenly thoughts they care more about their preacher than about Christ its carnal that's earthly that's a parasite and the Bible said Hebrews 2 if we neglect this Holy Ghost ministry then we the bomb said we're done we're gonna be a bad situation I forget exactly what the word is about that we should kind of neglect the signs and wonders and miracles of this Holy Ghost gospel that spiritual amnesia we in other words you must pray for God to move we must see God we must worship God and love God we must draw nigh to God and Hills all night into us we cannot neglect the channel to minister to God in the promised land now that you've got the Holy Ghost you cannot quit seeking God you must stay seeking God you must be heavenly minded and not worldly minded you cannot neglect this again the spiritual amnesia number 5 the girgashites this had the least amount of scripture on a gurney shots that means swelling in the clay soil but I found a good type in here glory it actually means dwelling on the clay soil their exact habitation is not known the murder sites were sons of Canaan the cursed man of the cursed son of ham burger sites lived on the clay burns ever recorded now I put a question mark but it's becoming more clear to me clay represents spiritual instability being tossed to and fro uncertain because the Bible said I was in the miry clay you brought me out of my reclaim and now my feet are on the rocking boy so girgashite represents somebody was so unstable they don't know which way to go they're not they're not sure about anything in the promised land baptized with the Holy Ghost I wonder brother have said you can have the bachelor the Holy Ghost and be insane because if they backside in one spot all these demons can come in if they're not careful on the church set absolutely it's all so tight as one who hears the word was not obey because the contrast the opposite of clay is luck rock and Jesus said a person that's on the rock hears the word and obeys it so someone on the clay hears the word it walks away it doesn't do it unstable is the unstable organs in stable unstable these unstable in state unstable unstable person talks to and fro constantly wavering back and forth what is it it's a double minded man that's Holy Ghost sakes knows all the ghosts got a bounce how many got a battle that sometimes all the time I go this direction is a pastor in that direction I don't meet the church I leave my family and if I'm not careful I can become double minded but God gives me great Saint just got to find that devil off got a keyframe he's believed it fight off that Gurkha shining net now plate also represents you remember it's the state the Lord brother man said the iron and clay represent the Catholic and the Protestant so the clay also represents the Protestant denomination intermarrying the lukewarm church member hey because the irony play mingled their seat together but what not mix so what does the girgashite it's an unstable of lukewarm disobedient church member who's tossed to and fro like a man tossed on the ocean unstable believer and the Holy Spirit said drive that out drive that out of your life be firm these look cool arms I don't be this Barbie hot thing that try that lukewarm out of your life amen good stay we'll find something to stand on don't be a pushover be solid by the will of God and stay right there stand on the rock don't be living in the clay don't be living like a church church member denies the Word of God stand on the rock of rice today boy we need some rock standard bar you try though those bird shots run most up another Lord today thank you for let me go it alone it's almost two hours but God be praised amen this is more than life to me church and if you're hungry than say God take away my natural hunger give me a more spiritual I can say go take a bite come back in Matthew 7:21 thousands of this we got to stay on the rock someone who's on the rock hears the word does it who's got the Holy Ghost and the lukewarm scripture right here lukewarm their works they deny it in their works you know sometimes it works or Goods done so unstable play okay so ends in stable unstable that's not sure which way to go and rights are you join us I thought I said I'm interested to see how the church responds with this I hope they like it because I like it so much amber writes Emmerich's out the nitro they had no definition of the Hebrew at least on folio views on the message software so I had to go to the east of our dictionary its Hill Landers or Hillman they lived in the mountains of southern and central Palestine they were the sons and hands are all cursed and all these demons are curses all these demons you fight they're cursed a mirage for some of the last of the Giants that's going to do gravity 3:11 you can look that up there's some of the last of the Giants from the land Eastern Bible Dictionary said they were warlike Mountaineers so there's very these these strong soldiers giant soldiers in the land so am rights must type out these powerful fleshly luster snares that war against the soul we become bad habits bad fleshly habits that more against the soul how many got me understand that they war against your very salt church that's what first Peter 2:11 says abstain from fleshly lusts that war against or so how do they make you or against your soul you start because of your addiction because your bad habits are because your problem you start doubting that you're even saved and yet you claim to be in the promised land because of a fleshly powerful us that you just hang it over it's a giant lust in your life how many know Christ gives the things off Christ will give you victory over lust it must be starving then you must starve that black dog you must drive out that black dog you must speak to that black dog you must have a booty man you must tell the devil the Word of God we stopped a fleeting then speak the word of that child in your life and watch it go speak to that mountain and watch a movie man how this happened again last night you guys can call me crazy but I had a headache it was getting worse and worse throughout the day I went down the study about 6 p.m. and I'm reading these quotes I just got upset with this headache I just closed my eyes and I said in the name of Jesus Christ I'm coming again just like that sickness that vomiting that come upon me last week I said again in the name of Jesus Christ this headache is going to leave Satan I saw this that you parents either arrested you're getting behind in the name of Jesus Christ within 10 minutes the headache was gone I had all day and it changed my diet I did do that everyone said we need faith to even cast out headaches in humanity we start getting there not speaking the word then we're getting close to rapturing faith day oh yeah right but these powerful lastly habits that look like Chinese in our lives we got to drive them out because they will war against your soul I thought I was saving because you're such a slave to your flesh and then wars against you the Bible said we're your Wars come from the lusts of your members Jamie said that where the words come from is joy Holden goes to church your lust start a war with brother banish sorrow brother Ivan or start a war they got more money than you or they're more handsome than me they got it you know that the people get jealous number jealousy starts most wars understand and then Paul says flee youthful lusts just run from them they are so gigantic like I said open up a bottle and you open up open up a can of worms right it's like still milk you've given one time to a live startline watched your life you give into cocaine one time watch them you it's gonna kill them flee father run from it don't try to fight that giant let Jesus defeat that giant don't let that giant in let Christ Drive them out that's not least I know you're having to be done here I'm not really happy but happy to get to these seven now Church you can see I'm not making these up this is just straight from the Hebrew and it's straight from the Bible dictionaries just looking at what they were and look into the type for our lives we can clearly see this I mean every words inspired the Bob Schneider words problem for doctrine right instruction training righteous that the man of God woman of God may be perfect yes send us the final thing we must drive out at least according to this Joshua this Joshua age Jeffy's eyes Hebrew means son of Jews G boozy muscle they work a nice to occupy Jerusalem they were actually in a very central center worship Jerusalem God's brought a place of worship and this to me is really interesting it's not man on this report Easton's Bible dictionary said Jay bus had been fastness or drunkle so what is it Jeffy's I type roots of bitterness I preach on that recently complexes or mental strongholds this is not addiction still us this is just a mental stronghold that someone has built up against so-and-so going up against this the jetty site is a stronghold a stronghold and complexes must be driven out yes according to these remember Esau of us had a route of interest as the Bible said he failed the grace of God he was bitter against remember he's been against Jacob he's bitter against his parents we went in married to Hittite women or the Hittites again he went married to Hittite women on purpose to spite his mother and father he had such a complex such a brutal be restored his parents and then second Corinthians talks about how we must cast out every imagination we must cast on the Bible literally says strongholds Holy Ghost those things if they're not careful Satan will get a their minds and have a strong blow in their mind against something else or somebody else and that was the seventh one listed by God in Joshua 3 tip let's say an or feet I'm gonna stop right there but as you're standing how many listen to the supernatural lately I found this so striking we listen do we just finished it last month I think my own Jordan

plans and you'll be just like that man all alone in dirty clothes living on the mountain no one that no one with no wife no nothing like that remember that a complex would drive him away from the people that he loved the people God has sent to you understand if he didn't get victory over this complex he never could have delivered the message to the people he preached the 1964 night in the fall this is later complex is a mayor battle to overcome I said somebody attacks you're a great example you know for your family I said your thanks really touched my heart I've had a conference against you
