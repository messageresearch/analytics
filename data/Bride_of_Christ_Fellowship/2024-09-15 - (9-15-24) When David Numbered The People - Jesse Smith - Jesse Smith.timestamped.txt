[1:36] Bibles here
[1:37] today by God's grace let's go to 2
[1:40] Samuel 24 verse one I just I'm going to
[1:43] take a little break from the series I
[1:45] normally do I sometimes I just look for
[1:47] inspiration you know and I can normally
[1:50] recognize it when you know I get a new
[1:52] thought that I have never had before I
[1:53] like to preach that so I like to preach
[1:56] on when David numbered the people I like
[1:58] to preach on that today uh I was telling
[2:01] brother William and I were talking about
[2:02] a little bit yesterday having some
[2:03] fellowship around the word of God so uh
[2:06] I was studying it and listening to it
[2:08] praying about it and I just trust this
[2:09] will be a blessing uh today a little
[2:12] later Ona I'll have some slides but not
[2:14] right now I just I don't I got some
[2:15] visuals later when it kind of pertains
[2:17] to the that part of the story when David
[2:21] numbered the people 2 Samuel 24 ver1
[2:34] Hallelujah uh Haven would you do me a
[2:37] favor real quick could you go get my
[2:38] water real quick my throat's a little
[2:39] dry I'd appreciate that normally don't
[2:41] drink water but with school the school
[2:44] year I've been talking so much and
[2:45] teaching so much voice a little little
[2:48] little little dry here let's read this
[2:50] here uh we'll just read verse one and
[2:52] then we'll have you be seated here by
[2:53] God's grace let's read this Psalm 3 1 2
[2:56] 3 and again the anger of the Lord was
[2:59] kindled against Israel and he moved
[3:02] David against them to say go number
[3:05] Israel and Judah may God add his
[3:08] Blessing to the reading of his word
[3:09] today you may be seated praise
[3:11] God thank God it's very kind yeah that
[3:13] was it yes thank you sorry thank you
[3:15] appreciate
[3:20] that thank
[3:22] you you know for years I never had to
[3:24] drink any water I think just as time
[3:26] goes on maybe get a little older and
[3:28] drink a little water so God bless
[3:30] everybody it's good to be in the house
[3:31] of the Lord today I trust the Lord will
[3:32] speak here uh there's a saint from
[3:34] overseas who said she'd be live
[3:36] streaming today so if uh uh the sister
[3:39] uh Sharon Rose I think is her name so
[3:41] she's streaming God bless her uh she'll
[3:44] be coming to the US in a couple weeks
[3:45] here and she hopes to come to this
[3:47] church she's a a wonderful sister um uh
[3:50] she's a little older you know and uh um
[3:53] she wants to come to the US and visit us
[3:55] so I told her uh brother Levi actually
[3:57] down there in Navar Ohio where they
[3:59] built the church uh brother Levi's
[4:01] Church down there um now he's not a
[4:03] pastor but he built the church you know
[4:04] with his brother uh he invited her but
[4:07] you know we kind of met years ago online
[4:09] and she liked you know she follows
[4:11] brother R's Ministry and so hopefully
[4:13] she'll be a guest here in a couple weeks
[4:14] by God's grace uh she wants to talk to
[4:16] my wife and I about some personal
[4:18] questions and kind of like you know
[4:20] maybe end of the life kind of things you
[4:21] know you know uh you know uh you know
[4:24] she's retired and everything like that
[4:26] and I think she's single you know so uh
[4:28] you know just wanting some Direction in
[4:30] life so uh got she requested a
[4:33] conference with my wife and I so I trust
[4:34] God will use my gifts you know and then
[4:37] God will use my wife's gifts there to
[4:39] help our dear sister so God bless our
[4:40] sister uh if she's live
[4:43] streaming so we want to look at when
[4:45] David number the people again this may
[4:47] seem like a little odd of season but I
[4:48] believe God's word is always in season
[4:50] praise God and I like to sometimes I
[4:52] like to take a break off the uh series
[4:54] and uh preach you know maybe a fresh
[4:56] thought uh I read this this week and I
[4:58] was just blown away again I was uh I was
[5:01] just reminded of many things in the
[5:03] scripture that I hadn't thought about
[5:04] for a while and you know God's mercy on
[5:06] David and of course we've been preaching
[5:08] a little bit on David with the message
[5:09] of Grace how many enjoyed those I
[5:11] enjoyed those too uh such a blessing and
[5:13] um reminder to our hearts of how
[5:16] merciful and gracious God is now I don't
[5:18] know how much you'll do this but you
[5:19] know I put two markers in my Bible uh
[5:22] because this this story has a parallel
[5:24] passage so I put a marker in 2 Samuel 24
[5:28] and I put one in 1 Chronicles I think
[5:30] it's
[5:31] 21 yes 21 so I don't know if you if you
[5:34] have uh some bookmarks in your Bible and
[5:36] you want to uh move back and forth you
[5:38] know I invite you to do that now if
[5:40] you'd like to I'll be flipping back and
[5:42] forth you know we we get the same story
[5:44] but we get more details you know one
[5:45] from the writer of Samuel 2 Samuel and
[5:48] one from the writer of Chronicles and uh
[5:51] you know this this story of course is
[5:53] you know amazed me over the years uh but
[5:55] you know I think it kind of comes in
[5:56] season here uh by God's grace as we were
[5:58] looking at David a few weeks ago go uh
[6:00] kind of comes in the the season here as
[6:02] we're looking at uh these things here in
[6:04] the scripture so uh 2 Samuel 24 verse1
[6:09] we'll start here kind of build our
[6:11] thought here I trust the Lord will speak
[6:13] to us here today how many want the Lord
[6:15] to speak to them amen hallelujah verse
[6:18] one and again the anger of the Lord was
[6:20] kindled against Israel and he moved
[6:23] David against them to say go number
[6:26] Israel and Judah now the first thing I
[6:29] noticed here as I was studying was again
[6:32] the anger of the Lord was moved against
[6:34] Israel this wasn't a one-time thing
[6:36] where God got angry at Israel right uh
[6:40] we know 10 times they spoke against God
[6:43] and Moses in the wilderness and because
[6:45] of that God kept the majority of them
[6:47] out of the promised land right 10 times
[6:50] and so God is merciful god is gracious
[6:53] um but here another time you know and
[6:55] church I guess you know after we watched
[6:56] that David movie a couple years ago such
[6:58] a great movie the best movie I've ever
[6:59] seen I think um after we watch that you
[7:02] know it it would seem like you know
[7:04] Israel was just uh per almost perfect
[7:06] you know like the anointing of God was
[7:08] on each and every person that's what it
[7:10] seems like sometimes right but if you
[7:12] read the scripture it's not that way
[7:15] Hallelujah now brother B says you know
[7:18] Solomon's days when he built the temple
[7:19] that was uh that was the golden years of
[7:22] Israel no doubt but what happened at the
[7:25] end of that he turned his his wives
[7:27] turned his heart
[7:28] away so even in that Golden Years even
[7:31] in that golden uh prefigure of the
[7:33] Millennium at the end of that the people
[7:36] turned away church we have a great
[7:37] responsibility to stay in tune with the
[7:39] Holy Spirit and not to turn away no
[7:42] wonder God would anoint Paul Griffin to
[7:43] come in here and say the Lord told me we
[7:45] must keep our first love and we'd
[7:48] receive it praise God so if you received
[7:50] it you ought to be rejoicing this
[7:51] morning amen because you got your first
[7:53] love amen it's something that when when
[7:55] you lose it you know you got to get it
[7:56] back but you don't know how sometimes
[7:58] you don't know how it's going to work
[7:59] out but God is rich in Mercy Hallelujah
[8:02] and God the Bible said his anger will
[8:04] only last for a moment hallelujah amen
[8:07] oh God's love is so great and merciful
[8:09] amen and so we see that you know you
[8:11] know I guess I've had pictures in my
[8:13] mind after watching David oh my the
[8:15] Israel just they conquered everything
[8:16] right they expanded their territories
[8:18] and it was just a it was just a
[8:20] picnic well of course we know that
[8:22] wasn't the case after basba and the
[8:24] Uriah sin of David and then remember uh
[8:27] four four uh four sons of David died
[8:30] because of that decision because he
[8:32] spoke it he spoke whoever did this will
[8:34] restore him fourfold and so David's own
[8:37] judgment was used against him and Jesus
[8:40] said as you judge others that's how God
[8:42] will judge you so how many want to be
[8:45] gracious Hallelujah we got to stay with
[8:46] the word but we got to be gracious
[8:48] Hallelujah that's right however we judge
[8:51] others that's how God will judge us
[8:54] amen and so uh we get to this spot here
[8:57] where we're at the towards the end of of
[8:59] David's life and we looked at his life
[9:01] you know U he probably fell with bash
[9:04] Sheba andah situation I think around the
[9:07] time he was if not mistaken it was
[9:09] around 47 or 55 somewhere in there I
[9:11] can't remember the exact number but then
[9:13] this one would have been about four
[9:14] years later he was either in his mid-50s
[9:16] or the his older 50s and so David of
[9:20] course has had great victories he's been
[9:23] a great leader uh he's been a man after
[9:25] God's Own Heart hallelujah how many want
[9:27] to be a man after God's Own Heart a
[9:28] woman after God's Own Heart
[9:30] but see even even even in that we see
[9:32] you know God from Heaven God calls him a
[9:34] man after his own heart but he wasn't
[9:36] always perfect right just like with job
[9:38] God calls job perfect in heaven but then
[9:41] he comes down to earth and said who is
[9:42] this Hallelujah I just caught that fresh
[9:45] Revelation this week you know in job 37
[9:47] you know God come down and told job
[9:49] where were you when all the sons of God
[9:52] were shouting for Joy now so many people
[9:54] think job was one of those sons of God
[9:57] shouting for Joy but he could not have
[9:58] been or else why would God say where
[10:00] were you God would be saying where were
[10:02] you don't you remember you were there
[10:03] shouting no God's saying you don't
[10:05] remember because you were in my mind
[10:07] there's no pre-existence so it just
[10:09] again shows the uh the the the the the
[10:12] wisdom that we need on the scripture God
[10:14] wouldn't say where were you and job said
[10:16] well I know where I was God wouldn't let
[10:18] himself get rebuked like that it was the
[10:20] angels of God the angels of God were
[10:22] shouting and glorifying God look at this
[10:24] creation our God is mighty our God is
[10:26] Creator hallelujah amen they were sh
[10:29] shouting and giving God glory brother
[10:30] man said that's where shouting religion
[10:32] started before the foundation of the
[10:34] world Hallelujah and we just get a part
[10:36] of it amen of course we know Jesus even
[10:38] danced before the foundation of the
[10:39] world he was rejoicing before the father
[10:41] Hallelujah according to Proverbs chapter
[10:43] 8
[10:44] Hallelujah but now we see you know the
[10:46] anger of the Lord is again so it reminds
[10:49] us you know uh we can be so pure I say
[10:51] like this we can be pure for so many
[10:53] years they been read it this week ASA
[10:54] was so faithful to God King ASA God gave
[10:56] him I think it was eight or 10 years of
[10:58] peace
[10:59] right because he was so faithful but
[11:02] after his unfaithfulness then they went
[11:03] back to war Hallelujah so we got to
[11:06] rejoice in seasons of uh peace and we
[11:09] got a battle in seasons of War
[11:10] Hallelujah and we fight on our knees as
[11:12] we sang it on Wednesday Hallelujah The
[11:14] Battle Belongs that was a requested song
[11:16] for Wednesday Hallelujah we fight on our
[11:18] knees and then we let God fight our
[11:20] battles hallelujah amen that's right
[11:23] Hallelujah now I looked it up I you know
[11:26] I was curious this morning I thought how
[11:27] many times do the Bible said the Ang of
[11:29] the Lord was kindled like a fire 15
[11:32] times the Bible said his anger was
[11:34] kindled like a fire so I want you to
[11:36] listen to these as I read through these
[11:38] and and you'll know this is when you
[11:40] know when God's anger might be kindled
[11:42] against you Hallelujah now we know the
[11:45] Bible said we grieve the Holy Spirit
[11:47] right because the Bible said neither
[11:48] give place to the devil so when we
[11:50] grieve the Holy Spirit we give the devil
[11:51] a place in our minds it's not demon
[11:53] possession it's demon oppression right
[11:56] oppression right get oppressed or
[11:57] discouraged or defeated or in David's
[12:00] case we'll see
[12:01] prideful he was oppressed with
[12:04] pride Hallelujah all right got some good
[12:07] Bible readers out there everybody you
[12:08] studying the scriptures lately hopefully
[12:10] these will be real familiar with you by
[12:12] God's grace so David's generation they
[12:14] were they were faithful at the beginning
[12:16] just like David but after a number of
[12:18] years they begin to backslide we've been
[12:20] talking about I'll heal your
[12:22] backslidings and they backl in such a
[12:25] way where God got angry with the
[12:27] nation Hallelujah
[12:29] so think about that they capture all
[12:31] this land you know they expand their
[12:33] territories but that's what the Bible
[12:35] says uh the Bible you know the Bible
[12:37] warned Israel through Moses when you get
[12:40] prosperous he said don't forget the Lord
[12:43] who gave you the prosperity that's what
[12:45] we find in our lives when things are
[12:46] easy there's no trials that's when we'll
[12:48] do a little compromise or we'll get a
[12:50] little cold on God because there's no
[12:52] battle going on God help us to be
[12:54] faithful and true Hallelujah in Good
[12:56] Seasons and in Bad seasons God help us
[12:58] to be in season in season I'm sorry in
[13:01] in season and out of season Hallelujah
[13:04] so in other words if you're in a
[13:05] peaceful season stay dedicated to God
[13:07] keep yourself on the altar of God's
[13:09] altar
[13:10] Hallelujah altar the Bible said you and
[13:13] I are a Living
[13:14] Sacrifice who's the sacrifice you are
[13:16] praise God Amen present yourself present
[13:20] your body a Living Sacrifice to Jesus
[13:22] amen take up your cross daily and follow
[13:25] him
[13:26] Hallelujah now let's go through these
[13:28] there there's there's 15 times the anger
[13:30] of the lord I want you to uh remember
[13:33] I'm I want you to think of these I'm
[13:35] sure you'll be reminded of some of them
[13:36] by God's
[13:38] grace see how my stuttering Austin see I
[13:40] told you that's why I never do live
[13:41] videos brother I just stutter back and
[13:43] forth I can't I'm not much of a public
[13:47] speaker Hallelujah 15 times the first
[13:50] time the anger Lord is kindled is Exodus
[13:52] 4 verse4 when Moses says I'm not
[13:55] eloquent he make there it is amen
[13:58] hallelujah he keeps saying I'm not
[13:59] eloquent I can't do it he makes all
[14:01] these excuses and the Bible said the
[14:03] anger of the Lord was against Moses he
[14:05] said don't you know I can send Aaron
[14:08] too God got angry in church it I think
[14:10] it was later that chapter the next
[14:11] chapter God was going to kill him
[14:13] because he didn't circumcise his sons
[14:15] God doesn't play around with sin and the
[14:18] church said church God don't play around
[14:20] with our sin Hallelujah God's he's going
[14:23] to chasen us if we won't repent he's
[14:25] going to chasen us and as the story says
[14:27] you know you might not get it right away
[14:29] but you're going to get chastening
[14:30] eventually the Bible said our sins find
[14:32] us out and glory and he chastens every
[14:36] son or daughter that he loves Hallelujah
[14:38] that's proof God loves you that he won't
[14:40] let you get away with something
[14:41] Hallelujah but it'll chasen you the
[14:44] second time was numbers 11:10 Israel was
[14:47] complaining all we got as Mana that's
[14:49] all we got we wish should go back to
[14:50] Egypt and have all this food and
[14:52] everything and the Bible said it kindled
[14:54] the anger of the Lord as they were
[14:56] mourning in their tents and so God sent
[14:58] quail meet to them that was numbers
[15:00] 11:10 so complaining when you got
[15:03] everything complaining for something
[15:05] greater God gets angry with that that's
[15:08] why the Bible said godliness with
[15:09] contentment is a great
[15:11] gain well I'm not like that person I'm
[15:13] not like that person I don't have as
[15:15] much money or land or Prosperity or
[15:17] gifts or anything like that you know no
[15:19] be content with what God gave you fear
[15:21] God and keep his commands
[15:23] Hallelujah see God got angry I've given
[15:26] you enough I didn't promise you all
[15:29] these things but they wanted to be like
[15:30] Egypt they wanted to go back and be like
[15:32] the world Amen God got angry because
[15:35] they're complaining so that that's a
[15:36] that's a common one for all of us we all
[15:38] got to be careful not to complain me you
[15:41] all of us we've all got to be careful
[15:42] don't complain be grateful Hallelujah
[15:45] that's right Church third is uh numbers
[15:48] 129 and I preached this years ago uh God
[15:50] got angry with Miriam and Aaron because
[15:53] they spoke against the interracial
[15:54] marriage of Moses and Zapora and I
[15:57] preached that there in Lima I wasn't the
[15:59] pastor yet never the pastor in Lima but
[16:01] I preach it I I use this scripture I
[16:03] said those who spoke against it it
[16:04] kindled the wrath of God right when
[16:07] brother Brooks let his daughter uh marry
[16:09] black and white I preach it and I said
[16:11] that and I stand behind that praise God
[16:13] because that's the Bible amen amen
[16:15] hallelujah that's
[16:17] right see but God that kindled God's
[16:20] anger you're you're uh speaking against
[16:23] someone's marriage that I
[16:24] ordained I ordained this Hallelujah God
[16:28] had had enough of it remember what
[16:29] happened it was more awful on Miriam I
[16:31] don't know so maybe she was the ring
[16:32] leader but it was more awful on her
[16:34] numbers 25:3 God's anger was kindled at
[16:38] bpor and that was all because of balum
[16:40] right balum took some money some wages
[16:43] and he tempted the sons of Israel to
[16:45] have fornication with the daughters of
[16:47] Baal and the Bible said that angered the
[16:50] that stir up the anger of the Lord so
[16:52] see sexual sin right Brothers battle in
[16:55] pornography whatever or any sexual sin
[16:57] it angers God
[16:59] and God said you need to repent of that
[17:01] Hallelujah get away from that amen the
[17:04] fear of the Lord will cause you not even
[17:06] to look at it anybody remember the fear
[17:07] of the Lord this week I did amen I need
[17:10] it I need it every week praise God we
[17:12] need it every week
[17:13] Hallelujah so these are ways that people
[17:15] stirred up God's anger in the
[17:18] Bible now there's lots of these
[17:20] Deuteronomy 6 I'm not going to read the
[17:22] verses Deuteronomy 7 Deuteronomy 29 and
[17:24] Joshua 23 all warn against going after
[17:28] other gods and that will Kinder Kindle
[17:30] the anger of God right now we think oh
[17:34] well I'm not worshiping brother brandham
[17:36] but church if we're depending in our
[17:37] money or our spouse or our job if we're
[17:41] depending in that and being more
[17:43] faithful and we care more about that
[17:44] than the house of God something's wrong
[17:46] we got an idol on our lives
[17:48] Hallelujah remember brother am said that
[17:50] man who was critical that fell at his
[17:52] feet remember in Windsor he said that
[17:54] man worshiped that spirit that was his
[17:55] Idol his Idol was anger against
[17:57] preachers that was his Idol right that's
[18:00] what brother R says so it can be so in
[18:03] other words depression any sin that
[18:05] people are caught in it becomes their
[18:07] Idol they want that feeling more than
[18:10] they want the freedom of God thank God
[18:12] that he sets all of our chains free amen
[18:14] he breaks every train he's the way maker
[18:16] amen he's the promis keeper he's the
[18:18] light in the darkness
[18:19] Hallelujah see that so
[18:22] any any sin that we don't take care of
[18:25] right away it becomes an idol and God
[18:27] says it'll Kindle his anger against us
[18:30] church we don't want to live under the
[18:31] anger of
[18:33] God so that and now church this just so
[18:36] you know this is what I believe was the
[18:37] issue with David's time because the
[18:40] Bible doesn't tell us why God got angry
[18:42] doesn't tell us now if you find it you
[18:43] let me know I just searched it the last
[18:46] few days I've been reading it this week
[18:47] you find why God got M we don't know but
[18:50] it just says again Israel angered God
[18:54] now look at their pattern right look at
[18:56] their pattern David's time the got angry
[18:59] salon's time they got angry now the
[19:00] Bible said God got angry at Salon why
[19:02] because the
[19:04] idols Hallelujah so it just seems to be
[19:06] it's probably the most likely case but
[19:08] it doesn't matter because we've got to
[19:09] look at our lives are there any Idols in
[19:11] our
[19:12] lives anything we love more than we love
[19:15] the Lord hallelujah Joshua 71 the next
[19:20] time anger was kindled aen took the
[19:22] accursed thing God says specifically
[19:23] don't take these things don't touch
[19:26] these things he took them and the anger
[19:28] of the Lord Lord was
[19:30] kindled usza studied the ark and the
[19:33] Bible said he died because of his Heir
[19:36] he was touching something he should not
[19:38] have touched right David should have
[19:40] told him that that was David's
[19:41] responsibility right uh David put it on
[19:44] a new cart they all put it on a new cart
[19:46] it doesn't go on a new cart it goes on
[19:48] the shoulders of the Levites Hallelujah
[19:50] but God got angry they should have known
[19:52] better they're in the promised land amen
[19:53] they're not in Egypt they're in God's
[19:55] promised land they got copies of the
[19:56] word amen there's there's a good
[19:59] indication right there why God might
[20:00] have why they might have fallen away
[20:01] they might have forsaken the Lord
[20:03] because they didn't even know the they
[20:04] had the word right remember God told
[20:07] Moses tell the Kings which would have
[20:08] been Saul every year they had to write a
[20:10] brand new Bible can you imagine that
[20:11] every year they had to write write a
[20:12] brand new Bible the king had to sit
[20:13] there and listen to it that's right
[20:15] that's right amen amen hallelujah praise
[20:17] God every year a brand new copy of the
[20:19] Bible amen I like getting a new Bible
[20:21] every year I would like that but I don't
[20:23] do that but I just love a new Bible
[20:25] praise God but every year and so it's
[20:28] seems like Israel had somehow forsaken
[20:31] the law of the Lord in the time of
[20:33] David because they didn't even know and
[20:36] then yeah then David said why why did
[20:38] the Lord do this he didn't even know why
[20:39] he why God did it and later he found out
[20:41] uh I was off the word see church
[20:44] sometimes we can be so busy doing things
[20:46] we forget to check everything by the
[20:47] word of God that's right that's why
[20:49] coming to church is so powerful
[20:51] Hallelujah you the Holy Spirit if you
[20:54] have a need I'll say like this and we're
[20:55] open to receiving uh from God God will
[20:57] direct all that we have need of to
[20:59] everybody God can take me off my notes
[21:01] as you said God can take any preacher
[21:03] off any note and give you you and I
[21:04] exactly what we need if we're willing to
[21:06] receive it praise God that's right
[21:08] that's why Church attendance is so
[21:11] important Hallelujah and that's what
[21:13] that's what we read there uh on Sunday
[21:15] night with the fear of the Lord remember
[21:16] children in Deuteronomy 4 God told Moses
[21:19] tell them to gather and to hear the
[21:21] preaching because that that way they'll
[21:23] learn the fear of the Lord see if we're
[21:26] not learning the fear of the Lord either
[21:27] the preacher's wrong or our hearts are
[21:29] wrong God help us to be all right
[21:31] Hallelujah the preacher I'm checking my
[21:33] heart that's why I'm here praying you
[21:34] know that's why I'm seeking God I want
[21:36] my heart to be right each and every
[21:38] person's heart should be made right as
[21:39] we come to the house of God
[21:41] hallelujah
[21:43] amen now I may not preach an hour and a
[21:45] half today we'll see we see Hallelujah I
[21:48] was kind of my wife said I was kind of
[21:50] real real Stern on Wednesday night and I
[21:52] was I wasn't it just came I don't know
[21:54] what it Hallelujah I'm just thankful for
[21:56] God's grace sometimes God's grace is
[21:57] Stern
[21:59] Hallelujah then the next time we got
[22:01] three more uh 2 Kings 13:3 God's anger
[22:03] was kindled against joash again for
[22:07] idolatry 2 Chronicles 25:14 and 15 again
[22:11] anger kindled against King amziah for
[22:14] bringing Gods he defeated Assyria I
[22:16] think it was and he brought their gods
[22:17] back oh mercy you win a victory over the
[22:20] enemies then you bring the enemy sin
[22:22] right into your life no sir no
[22:25] sir yeah the Bible said we should not uh
[22:27] the Bible says uh we should not envy
[22:30] Sinners don't no matter how much money
[22:33] Elon mus has Jeff bezos's married to
[22:36] second time he's an adulterer the Bible
[22:38] said don't envy men like that you don't
[22:40] know what they're going through in their
[22:41] private life nobody knew it Michael
[22:44] Jackson died nobody knew the King of Pop
[22:45] nobody knew that he had to take drugs
[22:47] just to go to sleep and then he died
[22:49] because of that because he had so many
[22:50] demons demons tormenting him yet he own
[22:53] had a billion dollars and what good does
[22:55] that do if you can't get a good night's
[22:56] rest oh the blessings of God you should
[22:59] be so thankful if you've got peace in
[23:01] your heart
[23:02] hallelujah hallelujah if you got a clear
[23:04] conscience you're one of the richest
[23:06] people alive today amen hallelujah you
[23:09] got a clean conscience before God you
[23:11] confessed all your sins serving God with
[23:12] all your heart soul mind and strength
[23:14] trying to be content you're the richest
[23:16] person on Earth
[23:17] hallelujah amen glory
[23:20] amen that's been a while since I did I
[23:22] felt pretty good amen hallelujah amen
[23:25] Isaiah 5 is the last one that I could
[23:26] find now I could find I was looking for
[23:28] that
[23:29] phrase Israel had Cast Away the law of
[23:33] God and despised the law therefore the
[23:36] anger of the Lord was kindled against it
[23:38] so Cast Away again brings that mind to
[23:40] If You cast it away it's like the
[23:41] backsliding right you turn from it you
[23:43] turn from it you cast it away and you
[23:45] walk in your own ways that's the
[23:46] official definition of backsliding
[23:48] Turning Away Hallelujah so I'm not
[23:51] making good progress in this chapter I
[23:52] was hoping to preach the whole
[23:54] chapter but see now the anger of the
[23:57] Lord was
[23:59] kindled now if you read in 1st
[24:01] Chronicles
[24:02] 211 the Bible said Satan stood up
[24:05] against Israel and provoke David to
[24:09] number Israel so some people have
[24:11] stumbled over this because it says um
[24:14] God moved David against Israel another
[24:17] one it says Satan moved David against
[24:19] Israel which one's true
[24:22] both you got to understand the wording
[24:24] of God hallelujah you have to understand
[24:26] the ways of God just like with Ahab
[24:28] right they had a Heavenly counsil and
[24:30] God said who will go for me I need a
[24:32] lying Spirit right Hallelujah so see God
[24:36] and this is one of these this is one of
[24:38] these amazing cases I preached it years
[24:39] ago but God work God knows when we're
[24:42] going to sin God knows when we're going
[24:43] to give into the devil he has perfect
[24:45] for knowledge Church look think he knows
[24:48] when you're going to get Victory praise
[24:49] God but he also knows when you might
[24:51] stumble and fall and so God can even
[24:53] work out your stumbling for his
[24:56] glory and in this case God worked out
[24:58] David's stumbling and all this idolatry
[25:01] that Israel been doing for years God
[25:02] worked it all out I'm going to chasen
[25:04] them at the same time amen because God's
[25:08] not surprised God's not I didn't know
[25:09] they were going to do that I didn't know
[25:10] God knows all things you can't you can't
[25:12] hide anything from God hallelujah d uh
[25:15] Adam tried to hide from God but God came
[25:17] looking for God came looking for you and
[25:19] I hallelujah amen even though we're the
[25:22] Sons and Daughters of God even though we
[25:24] fall short and our sins make us guilty
[25:26] make us want to hide from God God will
[25:27] still come look looking for you and I
[25:29] praise God that's love amen that's
[25:31] amazing love
[25:33] hallelujah
[25:35] amen remember God gives us the desires
[25:38] of our hearts whether it's good or bad
[25:40] God gave balam his heart's desire to go
[25:43] make money God gave hezekiah's heart's
[25:45] desire should have died the first time
[25:47] but he wanted 15 more years right here
[25:51] God lets David have his heart's desire
[25:54] his heart's desire is to know how many
[25:56] warriors he has in his country
[26:00] right everybody see that so Satan stood
[26:04] up and provoked David that means to lure
[26:07] he lured him in he set a trap and said
[26:09] come on come on over here David come on
[26:11] over here I'm Gonna Catch You like we do
[26:13] with our our mice at home right we lay
[26:15] out that Trap please come please now I'm
[26:17] not waiting up at night for them but
[26:18] they get caught anyway but he's luring D
[26:21] David you ever think how great you are
[26:23] do you want to know uh how many mighty
[26:25] men you have wouldn't you like to know
[26:27] how much God has blessed you oh that
[26:29] Lyon
[26:30] devil that Lon devil wouldn't you like
[26:33] to know the extent of your greatness
[26:35] you're so great David you're a man after
[26:37] God's Own Heart wouldn't it be awesome
[26:38] to see the fruit of your
[26:40] ministry I didn't preach plan to preach
[26:42] that but that's what he's saying the
[26:45] devil's Whispering wouldn't you like to
[26:46] see how how many Valiant men you have
[26:49] produced that have come out of your
[26:52] ministry David's like yes I like to see
[26:55] that and he chases over he chases that
[26:58] and he gets caught in the devil's trap
[27:00] now God allowed that God said okay devil
[27:02] you can do that because that's his sin
[27:04] he's going to go after either way but
[27:06] I'm going to use this to chasen David
[27:08] and the people because they've been
[27:10] probably sacrificing
[27:11] Idols transgressing against my
[27:15] word so Satan provoked David God allowed
[27:19] it and church remember uh in second
[27:22] Samuel 24:10 David repents and said
[27:25] David's heart smoted him after he
[27:26] numbered the people and David son the
[27:28] Lord I've sinned greatly oh I like this
[27:30] here here's David turning back he's no
[27:32] longer a backslider he's returned to God
[27:34] hallelujah oh that ought to help us that
[27:36] don't encourage us amen we make an awful
[27:38] mistake but the there's the conviction
[27:40] of the Holy Spirit and the the God Is So
[27:42] merciful he brings conviction so that we
[27:44] can say I'm the guilty one it's my fault
[27:46] it was my sin forgive me bring me back
[27:49] into Fellowship Hallelujah that's the
[27:51] mercy of God
[27:53] hallelujah and David said the Lord I've
[27:55] sinned greatly in the in that I've done
[27:57] and now I've been beseech thee Oh Lord
[27:58] take away the iniquity of thy servant
[28:01] for I've done very foolishly that's what
[28:03] I love about David even in the midst of
[28:04] his mistakes he could say it was my
[28:06] fault I'm the one that's done wrong I
[28:08] was like a fool I did it wrong I was
[28:11] outside the word I despised the word of
[28:13] God that's what the Bible said he
[28:14] despised God and he despised God's word
[28:17] he went he went against the word of God
[28:19] on purpose but he was able to say like a
[28:21] real man right a real woman he said God
[28:23] forgive me it was my fault wash me in
[28:24] your blood forgive me created me a clean
[28:26] heart don't take your holy Spirit Away
[28:28] From Me let the spirit of God rest on my
[28:30] life Hallelujah Don't Take Your
[28:32] Blessings away Hallelujah don't let
[28:34] don't let your wrath be kindled against
[28:36] me forever in your mercy have Grace upon
[28:38] me
[28:39] hallelujah
[28:44] hallelujah that's right God allowed
[28:46] Satan to tempt David just like God
[28:48] allowed job to be tempted by
[28:50] Satan and Israel needed chastening so
[28:54] God uses for knowledge and David's
[28:57] weakness with
[29:00] pride
[29:02] Hallelujah to bring chastening on David
[29:05] and
[29:06] Israel that's
[29:08] right and remember Satan provokes David
[29:11] here remember Moses was provoked by the
[29:14] people right see Church you know so
[29:18] sometimes the Satan will just come to
[29:19] your mind battles and that'll provoke
[29:21] you into a trap of the devil or other
[29:22] times Satan will anoint people around
[29:24] you that will move you into a
[29:26] mistake right but it's Satan trying to
[29:29] provoke people trap them in right but
[29:32] how many know that we can be delivered
[29:34] how many know in every Temptation
[29:35] there's a way out oh my there's always a
[29:38] way of Escape 1 Corinthians 10:13 we
[29:40] don't have to read it but uh I just got
[29:42] it memorized I've been looking at that
[29:43] recently in every way in every trial in
[29:46] every Temptation God makes a way of
[29:48] Escape Hallelujah there's a way out
[29:49] there's an exit sign every time
[29:51] Hallelujah there's always a way
[29:54] out Hallelujah and this reminds us of
[29:57] member God allowed a buffing demon to
[30:01] torment Paul's flesh to keep him
[30:04] humble God allowed David to be tempted
[30:07] by Satan
[30:08] himself and then a buffeting demon uh
[30:11] tormented Paul to keep him humble God
[30:13] allowed it the Bible said God sent the
[30:15] lying spear to Ahab it just shows God
[30:18] orders all of our steps nothing is
[30:21] outside of God's plan for our
[30:24] lives Even in our weaknesses Even in our
[30:26] failures God is allowing everything to
[30:29] bring us to a a spot where we can say
[30:32] God you have been good to me praise God
[30:34] because it's the goodness of God that
[30:36] leads us to repentance hallelujah it's
[30:38] not our goodness because we don't have a
[30:40] lot of it amen right yeah we are
[30:43] baptized with the Holy Ghost but that's
[30:44] only one part of us we got two-thirds
[30:45] that are not very good I'd say not good
[30:48] at all
[30:50] Hallelujah and then the Bible said an
[30:53] evil spirit from the Lord was given to
[30:55] Saul in 1st Samuel 18:9
[30:58] because remember God anointed David the
[31:00] anointing came on him and so the
[31:02] anointing left Saul and an evil spirit
[31:04] came on Saul from the Lord because
[31:07] that's what Saul
[31:08] wanted right God will give us whatever
[31:10] we want hallelujah how many want the
[31:12] Holy Spirit praise God that's what we
[31:14] should have today every day we should
[31:15] always want God's spirit because God's
[31:17] spirit is spirit and it's life
[31:19] Hallelujah gives us
[31:22] life and then this is one I haven't read
[31:24] this one for a while so case you put
[31:25] this one up here Ezekiel 14:9 and10
[31:27] Ezekiel 149 and
[31:31] 10 and the doctor told me years ago
[31:33] don't drink coffee if you're going to
[31:34] preach and well that's my biggest
[31:35] stumbling block right there he said it's
[31:37] not good you remember when we sat down
[31:39] at the the bed and breakfast there in
[31:40] Grand Rapids and the doctor said that
[31:42] one of the doctors that's what that's
[31:44] when he told me he's like or no his that
[31:46] he was a preacher and he said his doctor
[31:47] told him that I'm
[31:50] like that's gonna be a tough
[31:53] one uh yeah Ezekiel 14:9 and if that
[31:58] Prophet be deceived when he has spoken a
[32:00] thing I the Lord have deceived that
[32:01] Prophet remember Wednesday I was giving
[32:02] you examples of real life false prophets
[32:04] that have prophesied Chris Reed uh
[32:07] Kenneth copelan man there's a million of
[32:09] them they've all used the name of the
[32:11] Lord and they've lied in the name of the
[32:12] Lord you know God allowed them to do
[32:15] that I don't doubt God allowed them to
[32:17] have some of those visions and dreams
[32:18] but that wasn't from God God allowed it
[32:20] it was from the
[32:23] devil right Chris Reed knew about
[32:25] brother Brandon he texted me I have
[32:27] personal texts from him saved he knew
[32:28] about brother brandom but he lied in the
[32:30] name of the
[32:32] Lord and what got him it was sexual sin
[32:34] got him too just like that brother from
[32:36] across the state I told you about
[32:37] earlier this year back in
[32:40] April look at that verse uh he said I
[32:44] the Lord have deceived that Prophet who
[32:46] did God
[32:47] did see because God's got to give you
[32:50] what you want thank God God give us the
[32:52] truth today Hallelujah like brother said
[32:55] whether it burns your hide you ever burn
[32:57] an animal hide I haven't I've just seen
[32:59] them in the movies brother said whether
[33:00] it burns your hide or whether it chokes
[33:02] you out whatever it does God just give
[33:04] me the truth hallelujah hallelujah don't
[33:06] give me what my flesh wants give me what
[33:08] my soul wants
[33:10] Hallelujah Deliver Me From Myself
[33:14] Hallelujah because that's our greatest
[33:16] enemy is our
[33:19] self I the Lord deceive that Prophet I
[33:21] will stretch out my hand upon him and
[33:23] I'll destroy him from the midst of My
[33:24] People Israel amazing thing is these
[33:26] guys still live into their 80s today
[33:27] they false prophets what the only
[33:29] explanation is God is extra gracious
[33:31] gracious under this Covenant that's the
[33:33] only explanation I can think of right
[33:36] God took haniah out the very year he
[33:38] prophesied against Jeremiah remember
[33:40] Jeremiah said 70 years hananiah said
[33:42] thus say the Lord two years Jeremiah
[33:44] said that man will die this year and he
[33:46] died in the ninth
[33:48] month well how can these people lie in
[33:50] the name of the Lord today it must be
[33:52] the grace of God well some of them
[33:54] actually died this year too there were
[33:55] some of those false prophets that died
[33:57] this year
[33:58] one of them died a few years ago with co
[34:00] uh he he preached he preached oh co will
[34:03] never come to the real Believers he
[34:04] preached that in the name of the Lord
[34:05] one of these false internet prophets
[34:07] these prosperity prophets he died the
[34:09] same year with
[34:12] Co God have mercy verse 10 and they
[34:15] shall bear the punishment of their
[34:16] iniquity see these false prophets they
[34:18] know what they're
[34:20] doing the punishment of the Prophet
[34:22] shall be even as the punishment of him
[34:24] that seeketh unto him so see anyone who
[34:25] follows a false prophet the prophet's
[34:28] guilty and that congregation's guilty
[34:30] because they're they're heaping to
[34:31] themselves teachers having itching ears
[34:35] they're both under the same lying
[34:37] Spirits right Hallelujah the false
[34:40] prophet and the people following them
[34:42] the the Bible says in the Old Testament
[34:43] my people are deceived and he said they
[34:45] love to have it so they love to be
[34:49] deceived they love to be lied to think
[34:50] about that church that ought to really
[34:52] make us understand that God loves us
[34:54] that he'd only let us accept the truth
[34:56] of his word he would let us swi or or
[34:59] drift into such nonsense as that but we
[35:01] get anchored we get founded on the solid
[35:03] rock of God's word hallelujah amen we
[35:05] ought to be thankful praise God
[35:07] hallelujah I'm in touch with a brother
[35:09] from I'm not going to say the state but
[35:11] he followed those Prosperity guys for 20
[35:13] some years and he was given hundreds of
[35:16] I don't know how many thousands I
[35:17] shouldn't say hundreds he was giving
[35:18] thousands of dollars to these prosperity
[35:20] guys and he was just going along with it
[35:22] and he said he did see some genuine
[35:23] Miracles it seemed like but then one day
[35:25] God showed him the ministry of William
[35:27] brandham and he dropped all that and
[35:29] came right to the truth he said wow and
[35:31] those guys even preached about brother
[35:33] BR while he was sitting there but see it
[35:34] just proves God has an ordained time and
[35:36] season for every single person God will
[35:39] bring you to the truth at the right
[35:41] timej even if you're no matter where you
[35:44] are even if you're in the midst of a
[35:45] deceived false prophet church and if
[35:47] you're a seat of God God's going to come
[35:49] looking for you God's going to find you
[35:51] prodal Hallelujah he's going to bring
[35:53] you back to the fold because nobody can
[35:55] stop God there's no man that can pluck
[35:57] you and I out of the father's hand
[35:59] hallelujah amen glory to
[36:03] God and that brother you know he and I
[36:05] met there at Panera with my children a
[36:06] few years ago he's been a tremendous
[36:08] support to this ministry I've just been
[36:10] Amazed by that you know uh you know
[36:13] we're a small church right so God uh so
[36:15] God sends people outside of our church
[36:17] to support our
[36:18] church it's just the mercy of God God
[36:22] loves his people so much
[36:29] now verse two 2 Samuel 24:2 for the king
[36:33] said to joab the captain of the host
[36:34] which is with him go now through all the
[36:35] tribes of Israel from Dan even to be
[36:38] Sheba so start in the north Dan was in
[36:40] the north go all the way south to
[36:42] beerseba Beba is one of the most
[36:44] southern cities of Israel I don't know
[36:46] what tribe but I didn't have time to
[36:47] look that up I knew I preach it at one
[36:48] time but I don't know right now and
[36:50] number ye the people that I may know the
[36:52] number of the people now this was a trap
[36:54] so the devil said you need to know the
[36:55] number that'll really make you feel good
[36:57] see the fruit of your ministry right
[36:59] that'll really make you see what a
[37:00] mighty man you are and how many Valiant
[37:02] men you've affected see that's why all
[37:04] these false churches but you know they
[37:06] try to number oh we've saved 177,000
[37:08] souls online and all this stuff have you
[37:10] really have you
[37:13] really oh we donated all these millions
[37:15] to what to Bible schools that teach you
[37:16] to prophesy falsely and they all these
[37:18] numbers oh we sent 17 million there 18
[37:20] million there 20,000 people been through
[37:22] our schools to do what to blaspheme the
[37:26] word of God in many cases not every case
[37:29] but many cases see how the enemy likes
[37:32] to draw you in with
[37:34] numbers is that
[37:37] right you need to find out the exact
[37:40] number verse three and joab said to the
[37:43] king now the Lord thy God add to the
[37:45] people how many soever they be
[37:47] hundredfold God bless you hundredfold so
[37:49] that the Eyes of My Lord the king may
[37:51] see it but why doth my Lord the king
[37:52] Delight in this thing see when when
[37:54] someone's got pride no matter how you
[37:56] try to talk him they won't give in no
[37:59] matter how much you try to reason with
[38:01] them and show them the truth they won't
[38:03] give in and he was doing something wrong
[38:06] here now remember Moses numbered the
[38:08] people
[38:09] twice
[38:10] right but see God told him to number
[38:13] that God never told David to number the
[38:15] people this was just his own heart's
[38:17] desire right and even when D when Moses
[38:21] numbered him he said I'm numbering you
[38:23] so we have a record of it because he was
[38:24] about records amen and they said now
[38:27] everybody's got to pay a shekele to the
[38:29] house of God now you got to pay a tax or
[38:31] I should say extra offering shouldn't
[38:32] say tax we don't like the word tax he
[38:35] said now you got to pay a special
[38:37] offering you got to pay because God
[38:39] purchased you amen God brought you out
[38:41] of Egypt he brought you out by a mighty
[38:44] hand Hallelujah he brought you out so
[38:46] give a offering give a blessing to God
[38:48] because God purchased you and saved you
[38:50] out of Egypt Hallelujah in this case
[38:53] David has no word from God and he
[38:55] doesn't ask them to do a shekele of
[38:56] offering either
[38:58] so so nobody's so the so the temple the
[39:01] ministry is not benefited here the only
[39:04] one that's benefited is David and his
[39:05] own complex right his own his own Pride
[39:09] well I've got this many numbers this
[39:11] many that's all he
[39:13] wanted and this reminds me of when
[39:15] brother B said this I
[39:18] uh did you know remember this I preached
[39:20] the series on Pride this was I don't
[39:22] even have the date here but brother said
[39:23] my subject would be Pride oh Pride such
[39:25] a curs of thing so of so evil is pride
[39:29] but yet I found that's what message
[39:31] Believers struggle with the most that
[39:33] are the most sincere I'm going to say
[39:35] that
[39:36] again the sin I've seen message
[39:39] believers who are the most sincere the
[39:41] most dedicated the sin they struggle
[39:43] with the most is
[39:45] pride because if the devil can't get you
[39:47] with lust of the eyes lust of the flesh
[39:48] the only thing he can get you with is
[39:50] pride and we have to fall short right we
[39:52] have to Die daily so we'll probably have
[39:54] some sin eventually right
[39:57] but pride is the area brother it's such
[39:59] an awful thing it's a cursed
[40:02] thing remember it is a cursed thing
[40:04] because remember First Corinthians 11 uh
[40:06] the Bible said many are died and sickly
[40:08] among you because they don't discern the
[40:10] body of the Lord right Hallelujah so we
[40:13] have to make sure we love one another in
[40:15] the body of Christ amen but if not God
[40:18] may allow a curse on our health right
[40:21] get sick some people die that happened
[40:24] to my mom's church I told you that after
[40:27] after that pastor's wife said thus
[40:29] sayith the Lord serpent seeds of the
[40:30] devil they went through a season of
[40:31] death I forget how many 20 30 uh uh
[40:34] funerals they had in a couple years we
[40:36] were keeping track for a little
[40:38] bit we don't play around with God
[40:40] hallelujah you don't speak when God
[40:42] doesn't tell you to
[40:44] speak brother baham said again he said
[40:46] oh God have mercy on this sinful world
[40:48] what a horrible curse pride is he says
[40:51] oh you're too good sure we go to church
[40:53] and we know better than that we don't
[40:54] believe in Divine Healing oh we have
[40:55] nothing to do with that now that for us
[40:58] that wouldn't be us but if if we ever
[41:00] think we're better than somebody else
[41:02] pride has entered
[41:04] in right just because I go to akan or
[41:07] just because I go to uh bluon or just
[41:09] because I go to uh Happy Valley or
[41:11] whatever just because I go there I am a
[41:14] better person that's a lie that's Pride
[41:17] you are what you are because of the
[41:18] grace of God that's what Paul said Paul
[41:20] said I labor more not I that labor but
[41:23] but but Grace that labors in me
[41:25] hallelujah it's the grace of God call me
[41:27] to labor it's the grace of God that's
[41:29] kept me here as a pastor 18 years amen
[41:32] that's God's grace hallelujah it's God's
[41:34] grace that kept me uh saved since the
[41:36] year 2000 that's just God's grace it's
[41:38] God's mercy
[41:40] Hallelujah I got that quote from Brother
[41:41] BR he says the sinner that just got
[41:43] saved five minutes ago is no more
[41:46] special than me as a
[41:48] preacher and he's been preaching for 20
[41:50] 30
[41:51] years see in the sight of God we're all
[41:54] valuable we're all children of God
[41:56] hallelujah now we all got
[41:57] responsibilities right and we'll all uh
[41:59] we'll all reap what we sow but as far as
[42:02] value we don't say we're better or act
[42:05] like we're better we must not let Pride
[42:07] this horrible curse of Pride we must not
[42:09] let it overtake us he said oh pride is
[42:11] such an evil thing he
[42:13] says such an evil
[42:16] thing no remember what pride is pride is
[42:18] exalting your thoughts above the
[42:21] word right that's why that's why brother
[42:23] R says it he says the spirit of God will
[42:25] never direct you outside of the the word
[42:27] of God I love that one I'm GNA do that
[42:29] one again yeah I like that one the
[42:32] spirit of God it because it wrote the
[42:34] word amen yeah it wrote the word it
[42:37] can't take you out of the word it can
[42:39] only take you deeper into the word
[42:40] hallelujah because he wrote the
[42:43] word I love
[42:50] it now goes on to say so it's Pride
[42:54] Church no matter the warnings joab gives
[42:56] him Jo was a man he was a mighty man he
[43:00] was the one that uh went through the
[43:02] gutter the water gutter the Gyan spring
[43:04] and he's the one that defeated the
[43:06] jebusites when they were
[43:09] undefeatable Hallelujah so David made
[43:12] him captain of the host because he did
[43:14] something no other man was able to do
[43:16] for hundreds of
[43:17] years talk about a man now of course he
[43:20] had his mistakes later on you know I
[43:21] think murder was involved you know all
[43:23] kinds of but that's kind of how they
[43:25] were without the baptism of Holy Ghost
[43:26] Church what can you say you without the
[43:27] baptis the Holy Ghost they were just
[43:28] trying their best in their human spirits
[43:30] but we have something greater Hallelujah
[43:32] we have much greater Hallelujah now we
[43:35] read down to verse uh three why do you
[43:38] Delight in this joab said
[43:39] notwithstanding though King's word
[43:41] prevailed against joab see especially
[43:43] leaders got to be careful what we decide
[43:45] because the pastor's word or the
[43:46] preacher's word now getting down even
[43:48] the husband's word will prevail every
[43:51] time unless you got a woman running the
[43:54] house right let's hope it's not that way
[43:57] if it is it's time for some marriage
[43:59] counseling Hallelujah and some
[44:01] repentance but see the man the leader
[44:04] leader of the home leader the church his
[44:06] words always going to Prevail so see
[44:09] pride prevailed although the warning
[44:11] came but look it's God's grace God
[44:13] always sends Grace right God always
[44:14] sends a warning before Judgment of
[44:17] course this is a minor judgment not an
[44:18] eternal judgment it's a minor
[44:20] judgment man my goodness that busy body
[44:22] up there right verse four that prevailed
[44:25] now now I'm just going to skip through
[44:27] verse 5 six they send out joab and and
[44:29] they go to number the people now go down
[44:31] to verse N9 and joab gave the sum of the
[44:33] number of the people un the king and
[44:34] there were in Israel
[44:36] 800,000 Valiant men think of that that
[44:39] Drew The
[44:41] Sword and that's just what the devil
[44:43] wanted him to know I got 800 now for us
[44:45] it might be I got 800,000 in my bank
[44:47] account
[44:49] right but him he's like oh 800,000
[44:52] warriors with swords you know that was
[44:54] the pride look at my God took my one
[44:57] seed and multiplied me 800,000
[45:01] times that was the Trap Of The Devil
[45:04] provoking him to see how great are
[45:06] you how great you're you're you're
[45:08] amazing you're a man after God's Own
[45:10] Heart you need to know that number don't
[45:13] have to you know why because then David
[45:16] would learn to trust in his soldiers
[45:18] rather than trust in
[45:20] God sir everybody
[45:22] listening that's why the Bible said
[45:24] don't trust in uncertain riches the
[45:26] Bible says that can't trust in your bank
[45:28] account
[45:29] Church don't trust in that you got to
[45:32] trust in the Living God the Bible says
[45:35] always I know it's a struggle especially
[45:36] in America but we always got to overcome
[45:37] that by God's grace never trust in
[45:40] uncertain riches because they can be
[45:41] taken
[45:42] away at any
[45:44] time so here's what happens and then
[45:48] there's the men of Judah were 500,000
[45:51] men now 8 + 5 is 13 right so 1,300,000
[45:59] soldiers what a man I am look at my
[46:03] Ministry we get a million views on our
[46:07] videos see how they're s they can be sin
[46:09] in that right it becomes it becomes this
[46:14] prideful thing look look what I've done
[46:17] but God didn't tell him to do it we have
[46:18] to be very careful what is God calling
[46:20] us to do did God ask me to do that did
[46:24] God lead me to do that we must be very
[46:26] careful
[46:28] Hallelujah that's
[46:30] right so he counts the people 1.3
[46:33] million now remember this was an
[46:34] Abomination the sight of joab that's
[46:35] we're don't have to read it but it's 1st
[46:37] Chronicles 21:6 so joab knew this whole
[46:39] time isn't it interesting joab was more
[46:41] spiritual than David at that point just
[46:44] in that moment right because he was
[46:45] being led out he was being lured and
[46:47] enticed by the numbers and the pride but
[46:50] joab was more humble during that
[46:53] time that's
[46:55] right now you know what verse 10 we read
[46:57] that David's heart smoked and thank God
[46:59] for the conviction of the holy
[47:01] spirit that that's what I see church
[47:03] that's what I see in message churches
[47:04] especially and that's why this year this
[47:06] summer I was grateful I could travel to
[47:08] those churches and I was thankful to see
[47:09] Men actually smot in their heart about
[47:12] their sins it was refreshing to me
[47:16] because sure sometimes we just get in
[47:17] the routine right go to church go to
[47:19] work go to church go to work and we just
[47:22] get we get lazy on
[47:24] God and the conviction of the Holy
[47:26] Spirit doesn't come like you really feel
[47:29] it right because we become callous
[47:31] sometimes in our hearts and minds and
[47:32] the church said amen every I mean
[47:34] everybody everybody goes through that
[47:36] don't
[47:37] you right the fear of the Lord though is
[47:40] the your answer against that Hallelujah
[47:43] fear of the Lord the loving obedience
[47:44] right in the in profound honor right
[47:47] where's Eden remember I showed Eden
[47:48] profound honor last Sunday night
[47:50] remember remember that profound honor
[47:52] that's what we got to have we got to
[47:53] have that profound honor towards God I
[47:55] don't want to sin against you I want to
[47:56] do what's
[47:58] right we got to be like joab this sin
[48:01] would be an Abomination Pride would be
[48:02] an Abomination oh God don't let a a
[48:04] disgusting thing come upon my
[48:09] testimony and David admits I've done
[48:11] very foolishly remember Jesus called the
[48:14] disciples foolish for not believing the
[48:16] women that resurrected right sometimes
[48:19] we all can be foolish right we make
[48:21] mistakes we should not have done that we
[48:22] were warned not to do that we know we're
[48:24] not to do that the Bible tells us not to
[48:25] do that yet we still do it so a honest
[48:29] person an honest Christian will say Lord
[48:31] forgive me I did a foolish
[48:33] thing now verse 11 for when David was up
[48:35] in the morning the word of the Lord came
[48:37] unto the prophet Gad David sear saying
[48:39] now Haven asked me about time management
[48:41] on Sunday night now when does the word
[48:43] of God come to Gad in the
[48:46] morning David said every morning early
[48:49] in the morning will I sing praises to
[48:50] your name early morning will I seek your
[48:52] face see how church is really important
[48:53] to do that by God's grace now the word
[48:55] can come anytime but in this case when
[48:56] did it come in the
[48:58] morning Jesus went out to pray in Mark
[49:00] 135 in the morning a great while before
[49:03] day before the cares of the world could
[49:05] steal his time how many feel like that
[49:07] sometimes your your time just gets like
[49:09] stolen from you but you got to be like
[49:11] Jesus you got to make time for Jesus you
[49:14] got to make time for your prayer life
[49:15] make time for God when does the word
[49:18] come the morning came in the morning
[49:21] when did the sermon come to me this
[49:22] morning when or I'm sorry this week in
[49:24] the morning when I was studying
[49:27] Hallelujah that's
[49:30] right verse 12 go and say unto David
[49:32] thus sayith the Lord I offer thee three
[49:35] things choose thee one of them that I
[49:37] might do it unto
[49:42] thee now I was talking to my brother
[49:44] William and I said this I don't I
[49:45] couldn't think of another time in the
[49:47] Bible where God said you choose your
[49:50] punishment and so the only thing we
[49:52] could think of is that God loved David
[49:54] so much that he allowed him to have his
[49:56] choice
[49:57] because of his love for David Church you
[50:00] and I don't often get to choose which
[50:01] way it's going to go but God lets David
[50:04] choose because God knows he's a man
[50:06] after his own heart Hallelujah it kind
[50:10] of reminds me of Joshua God never
[50:11] honored a man's word like when Joshua
[50:13] said Son stand thou still because Joshua
[50:15] is such a dedicated
[50:17] believer right and then the only other
[50:19] thing I can see like this is when God
[50:21] told Solomon ask anything buddy my son
[50:25] beloved jedadiah ask anything whatever
[50:27] you ask it's
[50:29] yours so when God really loves somebody
[50:32] when God really sees someone's dedicated
[50:35] sacrifice God will give you a choice
[50:36] what do you want haty ride amen
[50:39] hallelujah God gave her the choice amen
[50:41] she said that's nothing but the truth
[50:43] brother brandom God can speak things
[50:45] into existence Hallelujah ask whatever
[50:47] you want God really loved that poor
[50:50] woman
[50:51] Hallelujah said she had a farm on a hill
[50:54] and she was uh she was just she have to
[50:56] to sit on the hill and plant now you you
[50:58] guys were we saw the orchard yesterday
[50:59] right there's a little bit of a hill
[51:00] there that's like Hattie right she's on
[51:02] a hill planting things out there just to
[51:04] have food and then the $20 she made off
[51:07] the farm she gave it uh she wanted to
[51:09] give it to brother BR or she gave it to
[51:10] Sister Ma and brother BR said give me
[51:12] that money I'm gonna go give it back to
[51:13] Sister Haddie and brother BR had it in
[51:15] his pocket and the Lord said don't you
[51:17] do that because the widow woman Jesus
[51:20] saw the widow woman's offering as
[51:22] well in other words God's going to bless
[51:24] her what what did God bless her with
[51:26] this salvation of her two boys

[51:30] ever was hallelujah amen glory that
[51:33] wasn't in my notes either Hallelujah so
[51:35] just interesting it's not always God but
[51:38] interesting he says you have your choice
[51:42] what do you want you want seven years of
[51:44] famine do you want to run from your
[51:46] enemies for three months or do you want
[51:49] three days of pestilence now which one
[51:51] do you think he chose what would you
[51:53] choose seven years three three months or
[51:58] three
[52:00] days I'd rather take three days wouldn't
[52:04] you God's gonna chase me I don't want to
[52:07] I don't want to waste seven years of my
[52:08] life suffer I don't want to suffer for
[52:10] seven years I don't want to suffer for
[52:12] three
[52:13] months I'll take it in three days
[52:16] hallelujah is there any shame in this no
[52:19] this is just David being a man this is
[52:21] David in The Human
[52:23] Experience Hallelujah trying to overcome
[52:28] so David needed some time he Saidi in a
[52:29] great straight verse 14 and David said
[52:31] un Gad I in a great straight let us now
[52:33] fall into the hand of the Lord for his
[52:35] mercies are great and let me not fall in
[52:38] the hand of a man how many know God is
[52:40] more merciful than
[52:41] Sinners amen how many know God is more
[52:44] gracious than your enemies praise God
[52:47] David knew this praise God David had
[52:49] family that wanted to kill him and the
[52:51] church said and would actually try to
[52:54] hunt him down and kill him and speak
[52:56] evil against him and call him evil and
[52:58] make his name remember take away his
[53:00] name and give him titles remember that
[53:01] the son of Jesse that's a good
[53:03] Revelation Simon taught us there by
[53:05] God's grace he knew what it's like to be
[53:07] under the the Judgment of man he said
[53:10] I'd rather be under the hand of God the
[53:12] Judgment of God than the Judgment of
[53:16] man this is a remember this was a God
[53:19] I'm sorry this was a god who'd forgiven
[53:21] David of adultery and murder already so
[53:24] no wonder he chose this
[53:27] if God spared my life after I murdered
[53:29] and committed adultery well then surely
[53:32] he'll have mercy on me
[53:34] again how many believe his mercies are
[53:36] renewed every
[53:38] morning this is a man who' been forgiven
[53:41] this is a man who' done foolish things
[53:43] and what does he do another foolish
[53:45] thing Church don't let the devil beat
[53:47] you up if you do another foolish thing
[53:48] just get some Godly revenge in your
[53:50] heart and say I'm done with this sin I'm
[53:54] not going to do this sin I'm done with
[53:55] it Hallelujah
[53:57] God forgive me I was foolish here I was
[53:59] foolish there I won't do it again I want
[54:01] to honor God I want the fear of the Lord
[54:03] in my life
[54:05] hallelujah
[54:07] hallelujah that's what the Bible said
[54:09] the fear of the Lord remember you have
[54:10] to first hate the sin then you've got to
[54:12] depart from it and not linger and
[54:14] meditate on it and love
[54:17] it right and then the Bible said s
[54:20] Proverbs 2 then you seek God and then
[54:22] when you seek God you cry out to God God
[54:24] restore my strength God help me then the
[54:26] Bible and then God will give you the
[54:27] fear of the Lord and you'll understand
[54:28] the fear of the Lord then now I
[54:31] understand it oh praise God hallelujah
[54:33] now this is what I should do this is how
[54:35] I overcome Now by this I'll overcome
[54:38] nothing but the blood of Jesus Now by
[54:42] this I'll reach my home nothing but the
[54:44] blood of Jesus oh precious is the flow
[54:50] that makes me white as snow no other
[54:55] Fountain I know with me nothing but the

[55:04] is all my righteousness only the blood
[55:06] of Jesus Christ I I have none I have
[55:07] none of my own I'm trusting in the
[55:09] righteousness of Jesus Christ
[55:11] Hallelujah we must do it by God's grace
[55:14] now I never read these quotes I wanted
[55:16] to read these they're good
[55:17] reminders now we see pride like I said I
[55:19] see pride and I believe these brothers
[55:21] in the message can have the Holy Ghost
[55:22] but let me just read it again brother
[55:24] bam said now notice sometimes great gu
[55:26] get together you hear them say great so
[55:28] and so great so and so don't never do
[55:31] that somebody this week uh sent me a a a
[55:35] a comment on YouTube and said you're a
[55:36] great man of God how could you teach
[55:37] that I said first I'm not a great man of
[55:39] God I corrected that right
[55:41] away right because if if I start taking
[55:44] compliments like that what do it leads
[55:46] to
[55:47] Pride remember the Rich Young Ruler said
[55:50] oh good Master he said who's good but
[55:52] God my wife got a good Revelation on
[55:54] that one he was testing him to see if he
[55:56] believed he was God right do you know
[55:59] Jesus is God he should have known but he
[56:02] didn't he just thought he was a regular
[56:03] teacher you see that Jesus see Jesus was
[56:06] testing him don't you know I'm God don't
[56:07] you know I'm God manifesting the flesh
[56:09] amen and he didn't catch it and so what
[56:12] does he he takes his word I can leave
[56:14] that although he left sorrow he said I
[56:16] can leave that I I I I really appreciate
[56:18] my money I appreciate what God's blessed
[56:20] me with
[56:26] said there's no great ones Among Us
[56:28] everybody say no great ones ready no
[56:30] great ones there's only one great one
[56:32] and that's God we are brothers sisters I
[56:35] don't care if you're pastoring a church
[56:36] that's got five people in it one two
[56:38] okay that's I'm pretty close that most
[56:40] likely me that don't make you little
[56:44] really all the churches think
[56:47] so that makes you a brother Amen brother
[56:50] Jesse Hallelujah see if you're true to
[56:53] God's word don't care what or how how
[56:55] you don't get little God don't have
[56:57] little and big children he just has
[56:59] children they're all the same Hallelujah
[57:02] and what's his proof of this he said God
[57:04] himself come from the ivory palaces of
[57:07] Glory to become one of us now who's the
[57:09] big
[57:11] one church we didn't come from we didn't
[57:14] leave anywhere good we came from the
[57:15] mind of God but it's not like we were
[57:16] ruling Heaven the ruler of Heaven come
[57:19] down in a body like an under the sinful
[57:21] flesh right it could die it could suffer
[57:23] he suffered all the pain so he could
[57:25] deliver us
[57:27] who's the great one Among Us Jesus
[57:28] Christ is the great one Among
[57:30] Us now I know we talked about wanting to
[57:32] give flowers and roses remember brother
[57:34] Ben Rod did
[57:35] that brother McBride they want to give
[57:37] flower roses I just got to smile you
[57:39] know but I gotta always be careful this
[57:42] don't let people call you
[57:44] great because as soon as you think about
[57:46] it soon as you get that it's time for a
[57:47] spanking it's time for a
[57:49] chastening because it's God that did it
[57:52] it wasn't you or I that did
[57:55] anything brother Bram says this I love
[57:57] this quote influence 1963 oh
[58:01] boy brother Braham said I've heard he
[58:04] said every man is subject to
[58:06] mistakes if he's human he's subject to
[58:08] violations of God laws and he is subject
[58:11] to many things because Satan tempson and
[58:13] he's just a human being and if God ever
[58:16] lifted his hands off you or me he would
[58:19] fall he would fall that's all so see
[58:24] Church what is it we brother gives us
[58:25] the picture like job God has a hedge
[58:27] around us that's the reason we're doing
[58:29] good the reason we're doing good is
[58:31] because God have a hedge around us as
[58:33] soon as he takes that hedge away You're
[58:35] G to
[58:36] fall
[58:38] Hallelujah that's what brother man says
[58:41] God is protecting him God's protecting
[58:45] us he says
[58:47] this yes you just let God lift his hand
[58:50] off you one time and Watch What
[58:54] Happens remember that's what God did
[58:55] with Hezekiah at that moment God pulled
[58:58] himself God the Bible said God left
[58:59] Hezekiah to test him now you're going to
[59:02] see what you're like without my
[59:04] anointing now you're going to see what's
[59:06] like now you're going to see what's in
[59:07] your heart when you're not singing
[59:08] praising God or clapping or shouting or
[59:10] worshiping or preaching or something
[59:11] like that not going to see yourself for
[59:14] your who your flesh really is notice I
[59:17] said flesh because the real person I am
[59:19] is my
[59:20] soul
[59:22] right and he said I've heard people say
[59:24] oh Satan can't do that to to me he said
[59:27] yes you just let God lift his hand one
[59:29] time Watch What Happens he said I
[59:31] constantly plead God don't send him have
[59:34] mercy on me keep him away from me I need
[59:36] God's mercy we all need that
[59:39] Hallelujah brother was say Where's that
[59:41] devil let me go cast let me go do that
[59:43] Devil he's like oh God keep me protected
[59:45] amen now there's times when we cast out
[59:47] Devils yes we'll have no fear I've done
[59:48] that seven or eight times to whatever
[59:51] you know I don't know what that's like
[59:52] but I'm just saying the attitude we take
[59:54] isn't like I'm some great person I I
[59:55] could can do it all where's the devil at
[59:57] that's how some of these people act but
[1:00:00] see that's Pride but we got to be humble
[1:00:03] and say God constantly constantly plead
[1:00:05] Lord let your mercy rest upon my
[1:00:09] life
[1:00:11] hallelujah
[1:00:15] hallelujah I don't know how I'm going to
[1:00:16] finish this
[1:00:20] today so they have three days of
[1:00:23] pestilence
[1:00:24] verse 15
[1:00:26] so the Lord set a pestilence upon Israel
[1:00:28] from the morning even to the time
[1:00:30] appointed and there died the people from
[1:00:32] Dan even to beerseba
[1:00:35] 70,000
[1:00:39] men that was verse
[1:00:41] 15 I want to show the picture here of
[1:00:43] beers
[1:00:45] Sheba Dan to beers
[1:00:51] Sheba that looks a little strange on M
[1:00:55] okay now it looks better
[1:00:59] so when God told the destroying Angel Go
[1:01:01] destroy the
[1:01:03] city the angel started destroying here
[1:01:06] with a pestilence something like a CO or
[1:01:07] a Spanish Flu something that instantly
[1:01:09] would kill you he started here he swoops
[1:01:12] all the way down to beerseba from Dan
[1:01:15] down to beerseba all the coast and he's
[1:01:17] making his way back up to
[1:01:20] Jerusalem he goes all the way down and
[1:01:24] he makes this big long trip he's coming
[1:01:28] up God sent that
[1:01:31] 70,000 people
[1:01:33] died in three
[1:01:36] days Church what does the three days
[1:01:38] remind you of three days of death and
[1:01:40] destruction what does it remind you of
[1:01:41] three days Jesus was in the
[1:01:44] grave Jonah was in the belly of the
[1:01:46] whale three days and three
[1:01:49] nights three awful days right weren't
[1:01:51] the now to to the human it to the
[1:01:53] Believers it was awful our Lord was
[1:01:55] crucified Lord was was crucified there
[1:01:56] was all this confusion uh the the the
[1:01:59] the disciples were scattered like sheep
[1:02:01] it was three awful days hallelujah but
[1:02:03] thank God at the morning of the third
[1:02:05] hallelujah thank God the morning of the
[1:02:06] third everything changed Hallelujah
[1:02:09] glory to God so here we see death death
[1:02:12] Death on for three days and then finally
[1:02:15] God brings a change
[1:02:17] Hallelujah verse 16 and when the angel
[1:02:20] stretch out his hand to destroy
[1:02:21] Jerusalem so he's been destroying he's
[1:02:22] been the Bible said he had a sword he'd
[1:02:24] go down and he'd do a sword and then the
[1:02:26] pestilence would be released he'd go to
[1:02:27] this place but when he comes to
[1:02:29] Jerusalem he lifts his sword and the
[1:02:31] Lord said stop it is
[1:02:35] enough
[1:02:37] hallelujah it's enough all the sin of
[1:02:40] their Idols all the sin of David's Pride
[1:02:43] that's
[1:02:44] enough Hallelujah they've learned their
[1:02:46] lesson they've been spanked they've been
[1:02:49] chastened they know to fear me again
[1:02:52] hallelujah praise God church God knows
[1:02:54] when it's enough for us
[1:02:56] amen sometimes you think oh God how
[1:02:58] could it get any worse how could it be
[1:03:00] because God knows what's
[1:03:02] enough and you got to trust God and the
[1:03:05] church
[1:03:07] said God will not give you too much amen
[1:03:10] God knows exactly that mount where it's
[1:03:12] just enough
[1:03:14] suffering to get you back on track and
[1:03:16] I'll say like this to wake us up amen
[1:03:19] hallelujah to break off the matter of
[1:03:21] our eyes so we can see things plain
[1:03:23] again and the church said
[1:03:26] glory to God Amen and the Lord repented
[1:03:29] that means he was moved to compassion it
[1:03:31] doesn't mean oh I'm sorry no it means he
[1:03:33] was moved to compassion see the Judgment
[1:03:37] went for three days and then he moved
[1:03:39] with the
[1:03:41] compassion of the evil and said to the
[1:03:43] angel that destroyed it it's enough stay
[1:03:45] now thine hand the angel Lord was by the
[1:03:48] threshing place of Arona the
[1:03:51] jebusite and David spake on the Lord
[1:03:53] when he saw the angel that smote the
[1:03:55] people and said Lo I've sinned and I've
[1:03:57] done wickedly but these sheep what have
[1:03:59] they done let thine hand I pray thee be
[1:04:01] against me and against my father's house
[1:04:03] here you have David acting like Christ
[1:04:06] David interceding David feeling for the
[1:04:08] people praise God just like Moses amen
[1:04:12] Moses and Aaron stood in the gap for the
[1:04:13] people praise God that's what we should
[1:04:15] do we should stand the gap for others
[1:04:18] praise God hallelujah now notice look
[1:04:21] David even says he said he said what
[1:04:23] have they done David didn't even know
[1:04:25] all their idolatry he was so busy in the
[1:04:27] work of the Lord see Church you don't
[1:04:28] know all the people's sins in the church
[1:04:31] David didn't even know David didn't
[1:04:32] think they did anything wrong but God's
[1:04:34] like I'm angry with them they've got
[1:04:36] Idols in their life but see you see
[1:04:38] David's pure Compassionate Heart he's
[1:04:41] like oh God don't put it on them it's me
[1:04:43] he didn't even know about the sins of
[1:04:44] the people but he was still praying for
[1:04:47] people so if God put someone in Your
[1:04:49] Heart Church let's pray for them because
[1:04:51] you don't know what they've gone through
[1:04:52] right you don't know what they're
[1:04:53] battling you don't know what they're
[1:04:54] struggling but God knows what it is
[1:04:56] hallelujah and God will put that person
[1:04:58] on your heart so you'll pray for them
[1:05:01] you don't know nothing about their
[1:05:02] problems you know nothing about the
[1:05:04] idolatry or any any shortcomings but God
[1:05:06] knows it all Hallelujah God wants some
[1:05:09] hearts like David to pray for those
[1:05:10] people that's right amen
[1:05:14] glory what have they done he
[1:05:16] says Verse
[1:05:19] 18 and Gad came to that day to David and
[1:05:22] said to him go up rear up the altar of
[1:05:24] the Lord in the thr in for of Aruna the
[1:05:27] jebusite so David Gets thus sayeth the
[1:05:30] Lord here's how you stop the
[1:05:33] pestilence right this is the way he's
[1:05:36] going to stop the
[1:05:38] pestilence right God said that's enough
[1:05:41] and now this is enough and now this is
[1:05:43] what you do when it's
[1:05:45] enough now you go make a
[1:05:49] sacrifice now you go make an offering
[1:05:52] unto God now Church how many remember
[1:05:54] our offering is is the thanks of our
[1:05:56] lips the Bible says the Praises from our
[1:05:59] lips yes it can be ties and offerings or
[1:06:01] whatever gifts to widows whatever you
[1:06:02] want whatever you feel led to do that's
[1:06:05] a sacrifice but the the major sacrifice
[1:06:08] we need is a confession we need the
[1:06:10] calves of our lips and say Lord I'm I'm
[1:06:12] returning forgive me of my
[1:06:14] sin Hallelujah like David just we just
[1:06:16] saw with David he said I I'm the one
[1:06:18] that sinned I've done
[1:06:20] foolishly
[1:06:22] Hallelujah and and the prophet comes and
[1:06:25] says in the name thus say the Lord David
[1:06:27] go up now and rear up an altar the Lord
[1:06:29] in the threshing for of a rune of the
[1:06:31] jebusite now you know what a threshing
[1:06:32] for right threshing floor is like a high
[1:06:34] place where they bring all the wheat or
[1:06:36] The Barley right and they got this big
[1:06:38] winnowing fork remember that fork they
[1:06:40] got you know you've probably seen them
[1:06:41] on the pictures there with the farmers
[1:06:43] from America in the old days they had to
[1:06:46] separate the seed from from the stem and
[1:06:49] so they you know they go up on a high
[1:06:51] place where the wind was blowing they
[1:06:52] put this all on a pile and theyd throw
[1:06:54] it up they just keep throwing it up
[1:06:56] again and again right and the wind would
[1:06:59] come by it'll blow away all the chaff
[1:07:02] they kept doing it again and again the
[1:07:03] wind would blow away all the chaff and
[1:07:05] all you'd have left is seed that's what
[1:07:07] God does to us amen amen God throws up
[1:07:10] our lives and let the wind of the Holy
[1:07:12] Spirit drive away the chaff amen all
[1:07:14] that's left is seed word amen all that's
[1:07:17] left is the word of God in our lives
[1:07:19] amen The Winds of Change right The Winds
[1:07:22] of the Spirit come in and blow out all
[1:07:24] of our fleshly things all the extra
[1:07:26] things that aren't valuable amen
[1:07:28] hallelujah right the Cha's not valuable
[1:07:31] part of the the harvest the seeds the
[1:07:33] valuable part the seed is the word of
[1:07:35] God
[1:07:36] hallelujah that's right so this was a
[1:07:39] threshing floor of araa the jebusite now
[1:07:43] remember we'll get to it here in just a
[1:07:45] little bit and David according to the
[1:07:47] saying of GAD went up as the Lord
[1:07:49] command so see it was thus sayith the
[1:07:50] Lord I'm stopping the plague now it's
[1:07:53] time for sacrifice
[1:07:56] Hallelujah see church sometimes it's
[1:07:57] coming to church is a big sacrifice
[1:07:59] sometimes isn't it sometimes sometimes
[1:08:03] singing is a big sacrifice you don't
[1:08:05] feel like
[1:08:06] singing sometimes witnessing is a big
[1:08:08] sacrifice sometimes tithes and offerings
[1:08:10] are a big sacrifice right God still says
[1:08:14] bring me a
[1:08:16] sacrifice Hallelujah recognize your sin
[1:08:19] and come present a sacrifice before me
[1:08:22] I'm stopping the pestilence I Want You
[1:08:23] To Worship amen

[1:10:50] buttering up here he's saying David look
[1:10:53] I mean you you need to sacrifice I got
[1:10:55] everything you need to sacrifice the
[1:10:57] Lord's a provided this another prideful

[1:11:10] wife he'd already he'd already taken
[1:11:13] somebody else's sacrifice and the church
[1:11:14] said he'd already taken somebody else's
[1:11:17] lamb so see the see the enemy again
[1:11:20] trying to get in there oh just just just
[1:11:22] give a sacrifice it won't cost you
[1:11:24] nothing
[1:11:27] see church it's so easy when someone
[1:11:28] gives you some extra money and then all
[1:11:30] y'all can tithe an offering off that but
[1:11:31] what about
[1:11:33] yours
[1:11:34] right
[1:11:36] Hallelujah Arun is trying to like say
[1:11:38] hey you don't have to do a big sacrifice
[1:11:41] you don't have to sacrifice anything
[1:11:42] else let me give this sacrifice for
[1:11:46] you what does David say does David take
[1:11:49] his
[1:11:50] offer no David learned the same thing
[1:11:53] Abraham learned
[1:11:56] Hallelujah God's not going to receive a
[1:11:58] sacrifice unless it cost me
[1:12:00] something
[1:12:02] Hallelujah God's not going to receive it
[1:12:04] if I don't give it and it actually
[1:12:06] causes me to lose something
[1:12:10] Hallelujah verse 24 and the King said
[1:12:12] unto Aruna nay but I will surely buy of
[1:12:15] thee at a price neither will I offer
[1:12:17] burnt offerings unto the Lord my God of
[1:12:19] that which doth cost me nothing see
[1:12:22] that's when that's when God will accept
[1:12:24] your offering when it cost you something
[1:12:27] brother R said sometimes it'll cost you
[1:12:28] people will mock and make fun of you he
[1:12:30] said if you speak in tongues or if you
[1:12:32] dance in the Holy Spirit or you make a
[1:12:34] fool of yourself or you act act like
[1:12:36] you're praising God that there's a cost
[1:12:38] to that
[1:12:40] Hallelujah and God wants you to give a
[1:12:42] sacrifice that cost you something
[1:12:45] Hallelujah I've cared I stopped caring a
[1:12:47] long time ago what people think about me
[1:12:48] praise God right because what what are
[1:12:51] they going they're going to come into my
[1:12:52] life out of my life and it doesn't
[1:12:53] matter but who stays in my life Jesus
[1:12:55] Jus stays in my life amen he's the one
[1:12:57] I'm trying to please
[1:13:00] amen be careful people that flatter you
[1:13:02] the Bible said flattering words worketh
[1:13:05] ruin
[1:13:07] right
[1:13:09] Hallelujah don't never think you're
[1:13:11] great don't ever think that brother
[1:13:13] Braham says pride is such a cursed thing
[1:13:16] but see a sacrifice has to cost you
[1:13:20] something so David brought bought the
[1:13:23] threshing floor of the oxen for 50
[1:13:25] shekels of
[1:13:28] silver and David built there an altar
[1:13:30] unto the Lord and offered burnt
[1:13:31] offerings and peace offerings so the
[1:13:33] Lord was intreated for the land and the
[1:13:35] plague was stayed for Israel remember
[1:13:37] Church the burnt offering was the most
[1:13:39] sacred
[1:13:41] offering right with all the other
[1:13:42] offerings you out you sacrifice if you
[1:13:45] if you're rich enough to have an animal
[1:13:46] you would actually get to eat some of
[1:13:48] that with a peace offering right all the
[1:13:50] fat would be go to go to God right but
[1:13:52] then some of the meat would go to the
[1:13:53] priest and you would have some of it too
[1:13:56] but with the burnt offerings it was a
[1:13:57] total sacrifice nobody got any of this
[1:14:00] except God got it amen hallelujah in
[1:14:03] other words God gets all this
[1:14:07] Hallelujah and that's what God gave or
[1:14:09] that's what David gave to God now Church
[1:14:12] what does this tell
[1:14:17] us cam preached this years ago to us and
[1:14:20] then I preach a series on it if you go
[1:14:22] to 2 Chronicles 3:1 and 2 Solon began to
[1:14:24] build the house of the Lord at Jerusalem
[1:14:26] on Mount Mariah where the Lord had
[1:14:29] appeared to his father David at the
[1:14:30] place that David had prepared on the
[1:14:32] threshing floor of ornan the jebusite
[1:14:36] and he began to build on the second day
[1:14:37] of the second month in the fourth year
[1:14:39] of his Reign Hallelujah so David bought
[1:14:43] this mountain Mariah the Lord said go
[1:14:47] take that mountain oh and you've got to
[1:14:49] purchase it David Hallelujah you're a
[1:14:52] prophet you're a priest brother Jose
[1:14:53] you're a king Hallelujah
[1:14:55] David the prophet priest king and God
[1:14:58] said you go buy that that man will want
[1:15:00] to sell it to you that's how you know
[1:15:01] God's in it amen he'll say yes I want
[1:15:04] I'll sell it to you amen hallelujah he
[1:15:06] said you go buy that David you purchase
[1:15:08] it and then you worship there you get
[1:15:11] burnt sacrifice and offerings there
[1:15:13] hallelujah amen David paid the full
[1:15:16] price just like Abraham paid the full
[1:15:19] price Hallelujah David would not take
[1:15:22] this land Hallelujah except he paid the
[1:15:26] full price he learned his lesson from
[1:15:28] UAH and basba I'm not going to take
[1:15:31] something that doesn't belong to
[1:15:33] me is that right so what is the location
[1:15:37] the location of this threshing floor is
[1:15:40] Mariah
[1:15:41] Allelujah and so this plague was only
[1:15:44] stayed when a burnt sacrifice was placed
[1:15:48] upon this hill Hallelujah everybody know
[1:15:51] what I'm saying here by God's grace this
[1:15:54] the whole city of jerus M would be
[1:15:56] destroyed unless there was a total burnt
[1:16:00] sacrifice anybody see where I'm going
[1:16:02] the whole world would be destroyed by
[1:16:04] the pestilence all of God's people would
[1:16:06] have been destroyed by all the
[1:16:07] pestilences except David purchased this
[1:16:11] hill with his own sacrifice with blood
[1:16:14] paying the full price it's a perfect
[1:16:16] type of Jesus Christ
[1:16:18] amen the pestilence of sin all of our
[1:16:21] sins would have destroyed us except
[1:16:23] David Jesus Christ paid the full price
[1:16:26] poured out his blood as a burnt
[1:16:28] sacrifice he didn't he didn't let the
[1:16:30] devil give it to him early right he said
[1:16:32] he said I rebuke you get behind me devil
[1:16:34] but he went to the cross and he gave his
[1:16:36] life as a burnt offering he purchased
[1:16:38] the hill and the plague of our sins has
[1:16:41] been stayed
[1:16:43] hallelujah hallelujah praise God amen
[1:16:46] glory to God Amen

[1:16:52] needed a sacrifice or else this whole

[1:17:01] Judgment against the people of
[1:17:04] God
[1:17:07] hallelujah church this was just one in a
[1:17:10] long line of types of the cross the

[1:24:02] BC 41 years later Abraham come back he

[1:24:10] knew God had met him there before amen
[1:24:12] hallelujah God met me here before and
[1:24:14] remember he said he had a revelation he
[1:24:16] said I and the land are going to go back

[1:24:20] had a a revelation of Resurrection

[1:24:25] the same place where Jesus would be
[1:24:26] crucified amen Joshua fast forward some

[1:24:34] Mariah because of the
[1:24:36] jebusites Hallelujah 400 years later
[1:24:39] nearly David's men finally conquer
[1:24:41] Mariah and that's when David danced

[1:25:15] God 30 years later is when what we read
[1:25:18] today 30 years later is when he finally
[1:25:20] buys that Temple Mount and he makes a
[1:25:22] sacrifice a burnt offering I'm buying
[1:25:25] this to honor the
[1:25:28] Lord then some 15 years later Pon says

[1:25:32] worship on
[1:25:34] here I'm turning this threshing floor
[1:25:37] into a house of worship and every time
[1:25:40] David or even Solomon came back to this
[1:25:43] place they could have said this this is
[1:25:46] the place where God had mercy on me and
[1:25:49] God spared wrath on the church amen
[1:25:53] think about that every time
[1:25:55] remember he went from Dan down to
[1:25:56] beerseba he's coming up to kill
[1:25:58] everybody but God said David if you go
[1:25:59] sacrifice I'll stop right there every
[1:26:03] time every time we should come to church
[1:26:05] we should be thankful Lord Lord this is
[1:26:07] the place where I come if it wasn't for
[1:26:09] the sacrifice of Jesus Christ you would
[1:26:11] have we would have all judgment on me
[1:26:13] this this because the sacrifice of Jesus
[1:26:15] Christ my life has been spared
[1:26:18] Hallelujah and every time they would go
[1:26:21] there they would know this is the place
[1:26:23] where God chose to have Mercy on us and
