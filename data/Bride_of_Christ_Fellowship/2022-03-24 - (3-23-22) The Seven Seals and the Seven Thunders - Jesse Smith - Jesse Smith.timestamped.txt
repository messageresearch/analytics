[17:44] praise god amen let's take our bibles
[17:46] tonight by god's grace let's go to
[17:47] revelation chapter eight
[17:49] i'd like to preach on uh the seven seals
[17:51] and the seven thunders you know i felt
[17:53] like i didn't give a good answer on
[17:54] sunday nights i'd like to go over that
[17:56] and
[17:57] i thought boy it's been a long time
[17:58] since i studied that and preached that
[17:59] so
[18:00] we'll try to preach it tonight and then
[18:02] maybe next wednesday we'll finish it
[18:04] we'll kind of see how that goes by god's
[18:05] grace
[18:09] revelation chapter 8 verse 1.
[18:19] i'm looking forward to having brother
[18:20] brian again
[18:23] by god's grace
[18:24] i do want to get to the gideon of course
[18:26] we'll get back to the gideon that was a
[18:27] wonderful time in the lord last week and
[18:30] i just felt like
[18:34] i just felt really uh anxious or not
[18:36] anxious but i just felt burdened i
[18:37] really wanted to go study that and
[18:39] look at the seven thunders again tonight
[18:41] i thought it'd be good also for austin
[18:42] and lena i don't think they've ever
[18:43] heard of seven thunder sermon
[18:45] so let's be the first one praise god and
[18:47] it's been a lot of years since i
[18:48] preached it's been
[18:49] six years since i preached it so i went
[18:52] and checked so
[18:53] it's very simple you know remember
[18:55] brother man makes a statement it's so
[18:56] true god is always revealed in
[18:58] simplicity
[19:00] so
[19:02] people have taken this
[19:04] subject and made it so strange or
[19:06] mysterious
[19:08] and it's sad but you know that's of
[19:10] course that's the enemy getting in there
[19:11] you know deceiving people or
[19:13] uh
[19:14] people not praying enough seeking god
[19:16] enough but it's very simple
[19:18] um now i know it's kind of deep with the
[19:20] the three different forms for each seal
[19:22] we'll go over that tonight i'll try to
[19:23] show as plainly as possible
[19:25] i was working on that last few days
[19:27] trying to make it just really plain
[19:30] i hope it's so plain that even a newly
[19:32] baptized person could receive it so
[19:34] who's the latest one baptized was it
[19:36] victoria who was it
[19:39] nature virtue so hopefully it can be so
[19:41] plain well whoever was the even the
[19:42] littlest one could understand it right
[19:44] i'm going to try to make it so plain
[19:45] here tonight
[19:46] revelation 8 verse 1.
[19:50] let's all read that together on three
[19:52] one two three and when he had opened the
[19:55] seventh seal there was silence in heaven
[19:59] about the space of half an hour
[20:02] now go to chapter 10 revelation 10
[20:06] verse 1 revelation 10 verse 1
[20:10] and also i'll say this this topic does
[20:13] not pertain to salvation as brother ram
[20:15] preached throughout his whole ministry
[20:17] there are subjects that deal with
[20:18] salvation those are the most important
[20:20] subjects
[20:21] in other words those are the ones we
[20:22] really got fight we have to fight
[20:24] battles over that if people are being
[20:25] lost we have to really rebuke people
[20:27] help people to get people saved but
[20:29] there are subjects that do not pertain
[20:30] to salvation brother brahm said like he
[20:32] said for example some minister might
[20:33] believe jesus will come on a white horse
[20:35] when he returns some believe he might
[20:37] come on a white cloud he said but the
[20:38] main thing is we believe he's coming
[20:40] and he said we shouldn't disfellowship
[20:42] because we don't agree on how he's
[20:43] coming because that doesn't pertain to
[20:45] salvation that pertains to how he's
[20:46] coming
[20:48] so it is here with the seventh seal and
[20:50] the seven thunders it doesn't this
[20:51] doesn't have nothing to do with your
[20:52] salvation
[20:53] this has to deal with the future praise
[20:55] god or we say like this the past and the
[20:57] future
[20:58] it has to deal with brother branham's
[21:00] ministry praise god that's what it has
[21:01] to deal with
[21:03] and so i hope that's made clear here
[21:04] tonight i hope that will be understood
[21:08] and i think as we start i think you'll
[21:10] see that by god's grace the main thing
[21:12] that for salvation that we need is the
[21:13] blood of jesus christ that's what we
[21:15] sang about that's what we should always
[21:16] sing about church praise god hallelujah
[21:19] because that's what purchased our
[21:20] salvation the faith our faith must be in
[21:23] the blood of jesus christ now of course
[21:25] these are deeper subjects as i said as
[21:27] brother craig said i love that statement
[21:29] the seven thunders is as deep as we go
[21:30] so i know it's kind of deep but
[21:32] hopefully it can be so simple tonight
[21:34] that you you won't miss it
[21:36] and uh and then i'll i'll catch it you
[21:38] know of course and have a better
[21:39] understanding of anything that i haven't
[21:40] understood yet
[21:42] revelation 10 verse 1.
[21:46] now i'm gonna read one and two and then
[21:48] we'll all read verse three
[21:50] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[21:52] from heaven clothed with a cloud and a
[21:54] rainbow was on his head and his face as
[21:56] it were the sun and his feet as pillars
[21:58] of fire those last two details are the
[22:00] same of jesus christ in revelation
[22:02] chapter one so this is jesus christ
[22:05] coming down as a messenger
[22:08] and notice angels here or angel rather
[22:11] come down the form of an angel verse two
[22:13] and he had in his hand a little book
[22:15] open and he set his right foot upon the
[22:17] earth and his left foot up i'm sorry
[22:19] left i'm sorry right foot upon the sea
[22:21] pardon me my and his left foot on the
[22:23] earth that's all read verse three ready
[22:25] one two three and cried with a loud
[22:28] voice as when a lion roareth and when he
[22:32] had cried seven thunders uttered their
[22:35] voices now john is seeing this church in
[22:37] a.d 95 or 96 or 800 doesn't matter
[22:41] so around around 100 a.d
[22:44] he sees this he sees the mighty angel
[22:45] come down
[22:46] and he his voice cries and seven
[22:49] thunders
[22:50] utter their voices
[22:52] okay so john sees us and then in verse 4
[22:55] and when the seven thunders had other
[22:56] voices i was about to write so john
[22:58] heard what it was
[23:00] and i heard a voice from heaven saying
[23:02] unto me seal up those things which were
[23:04] which the seven thunders uttered and
[23:06] write them not and the angel which i saw
[23:08] stand upon the sea and upon the earth
[23:09] lifted up his hand to heaven so that's
[23:12] we say the holy spirit
[23:14] and swear by him that liveth forever and
[23:15] ever who created heaven and the things
[23:17] that therein are and the earth and the
[23:19] things that therein are and the sea and
[23:21] the things that which are therein that
[23:23] there should be
[23:24] time no longer
[23:27] okay now that word means delay that
[23:29] there should be no more delay verse
[23:31] seven let's read that together one two
[23:33] three but in the days of the voice of
[23:35] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[23:38] sound the mystery of god should be
[23:40] finished as he hath declared to his
[23:43] servants the prophets
[23:45] now let's have a word of prayer let's
[23:46] bow our heads one more time ask the lord
[23:47] to help us
[23:48] heavenly father we sing because your
[23:50] goodness lord god we sing we will always
[23:52] sing because of what you've done lord
[23:54] and all of our soul gets the same
[23:55] because the holy spirit is in our soul
[23:57] lord god and we're worshiping you we're
[23:59] loving you lord your holy spirit's
[24:01] filling our minds right now god so we
[24:03] give you all of our songs we give you
[24:04] all of our worship and we give you
[24:06] thanks and praise thank you for the
[24:07] blood of jesus christ thank you for
[24:09] salvation lord god the greatest miracle
[24:11] the greatest gift that a mortal man
[24:13] could be given thank you jesus for
[24:15] salvation through your blood and father
[24:17] help us to see the connection here
[24:18] tonight lord god and we just pray lord
[24:21] in jesus name you'll give me grace and
[24:22] strength god and help the people to
[24:23] receive it and father i just pray it's a
[24:25] blessing to them father we know lord you
[24:27] always make all things simple lord
[24:29] you're revealed in simplicity
[24:31] and lord you said also the deep things
[24:33] lord belong to you belong to your
[24:35] children lord and to their children that
[24:37] they might do all the words of the
[24:39] scripture so lord we believe that these
[24:41] belong to us father not by what we've
[24:43] done but by what you've revealed lord
[24:45] god and we're coming by grace asking you
[24:47] lord to reveal them to us afresh lord if
[24:49] we've forgotten or never understood them
[24:51] and lord reveal more lord if we do
[24:53] understand them to some degree we just
[24:55] need your holy spirit to give us wisdom
[24:57] tonight we pray in jesus christ's name
[25:00] and the saint said
[25:01] amen god bless you as you're being
[25:02] seated and if we go to revelation
[25:04] chapter 5 you can switch over i just
[25:05] have a few
[25:07] i got plenty of slides but
[25:12] revelation chapter 5.
[25:17] now uh to background this
[25:20] uh in revelation chapter 5 there's a
[25:23] seven sealed book john is transported up
[25:25] to heaven
[25:27] and no one is worthy they announce who
[25:29] can open the book the book has seven
[25:31] seals on it
[25:33] and no one is able to loose that book
[25:36] until jesus christ comes forth no man in
[25:38] heaven no man on earth does that means
[25:40] mary the virgin wasn't worthy
[25:43] that means uh peter was already dead at
[25:44] this time peter wasn't worthy
[25:46] john john was there he wasn't worthy
[25:49] no one was worthy
[25:50] so the only one worthy to open it was
[25:52] the lamb of god jesus christ
[25:55] praise god
[25:57] in church he come and takes the book and
[25:59] that's when john rejoices praise god
[26:02] uh and i want to just uh
[26:06] show you in verse 9 again i read this a
[26:07] few weeks ago but let's look at
[26:08] revelation 5 verse 9. and they sung a
[26:11] new song so now they're worshiping jesus
[26:12] because he's come and taken this book
[26:14] this seven seal book
[26:17] barmy
[26:18] saying thou art worthy to take the book
[26:19] and open the steels thereof for thou
[26:22] slain it has redeemed us to god by thy
[26:24] blood out of every kindred and tongue
[26:26] and people and nation and it's made us
[26:29] unto our god kings and priests and we
[26:31] shall reign on the earth now check just
[26:33] check this for a moment church
[26:36] when jesus takes the book the 24 elders
[26:40] worship him and say you you redeemed us
[26:42] you purchased us back from the enemy
[26:44] praise god you purchased us you bought
[26:47] us on the through the blood of the cross
[26:49] you purchased us and you own us and now
[26:52] you saved us
[26:53] pardon me got a little ugh
[26:56] go off there in my throat pardon me amen
[26:58] and notice they are kings and priests
[27:00] unto god how many know that you're a
[27:01] king and priest under god as well praise
[27:03] god
[27:04] you you're a king you rule over
[27:05] spiritual wickedness and you're a priest
[27:07] you intercede for the needs of the
[27:09] people
[27:10] you're a king and priest unto god
[27:12] okay now if you go to chapter six verse
[27:15] one
[27:16] jesus starts opening the seals he starts
[27:18] loosing the seals off the book in verse
[27:21] 1 he said and i saw when the lamb opened
[27:23] one of the seals and i heard as we're
[27:24] the noise of a thunder one of the four
[27:26] beasts saying come and see now
[27:28] chapter six has six seals opened
[27:31] right so six out of the seven are open
[27:34] and all of them have symbols
[27:37] okay now you go to chapter eight where
[27:39] we were
[27:40] when the eighth seal i'm sorry when the
[27:42] seventh seal opens in revelation 8
[27:44] there's no symbol all there is is
[27:46] silence in heaven so the angels stopped
[27:49] worshiping jesus for some reason well we
[27:51] know that's because jesus left jesus
[27:53] came down for the rapture praise god
[27:56] hallelujah
[27:57] now i'm going to show the quotes as well
[27:59] to kind of back this up but that's the
[28:01] background so the background of this
[28:04] oh yeah and then go to chapter 10. then
[28:05] chapter 10 this mighty angel comes down
[28:08] with that book that's now open the same
[28:10] one that was sealed up with seven seals
[28:12] is now open and that book is brought to
[28:14] earth
[28:15] and when it's brought to earth it's
[28:16] given to an earthly man and he and then
[28:19] he finishes the mystery of god because
[28:20] the book's open now
[28:22] all the mysteries that were in the book
[28:24] are now preached and revealed and that's
[28:26] when god sent brother branham praise god
[28:28] hallelujah and that's what my latest
[28:30] book is about the mysteries revealed
[28:32] because the bible said the mystery of
[28:33] god is finished so anything that's
[28:35] called a mystery in the book is now
[28:37] finished but then don't forget in
[28:39] chapter 10 verses 8 through 11 john has
[28:42] to eat the book and then it must be
[28:44] prophesied again to every nation kindred
[28:46] people tongue and tribe and the church
[28:48] said
[28:49] so in other words this has to hap this
[28:51] has happened in our day
[28:53] so jesus christ came down in that
[28:55] picture out there that cloud picture in
[28:58] other words his holy spirit now not his
[29:00] body physically but his holy spirit came
[29:02] down and that cloud is actually seven
[29:04] angels
[29:05] but the man said that was seven angels
[29:06] formed that cloud and i got a good
[29:08] sermon on that there's six hours of
[29:09] sermon about that cloud that no man made
[29:12] that cloud out there that picture that
[29:13] cloud it was totally from god it's
[29:15] impossible for man to put that in there
[29:17] and the scientists he's in the message
[29:19] he proves it with six hours of science
[29:21] now it's kind of
[29:22] it's way over my head right it's way
[29:24] over my head but i did uh write down a
[29:27] few notes like these these are powerful
[29:28] statements these this is powerful
[29:30] science some of the things i could
[29:31] understand but not everything but if you
[29:34] want the link to that it's on it's on
[29:35] youtube it's got many thousands of views
[29:37] that was a supernatural cloud it was a
[29:39] vindicated and god vindicated that god
[29:41] sent that cloud down there to fulfill
[29:43] revelation 10 1-6
[29:46] in other words god was sending his
[29:47] angels down to tell brother brahm to go
[29:50] back to jeffersonville preach on the
[29:52] seven seals and the holy spirit would
[29:53] reveal to him the seven seals the
[29:56] revelation of the seven seals
[29:59] praise god
[30:00] all right and then verse seven says the
[30:02] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[30:03] all the myths the mystery of god is
[30:05] finished so there's one mystery that
[30:06] just means all the bible-defined
[30:08] mysteries are now revealed and they're
[30:10] finished praise god
[30:12] and that's when god took brother branham
[30:14] and now our job is to take all these uh
[30:16] wonderful sermons these revelations
[30:18] around the world and i'm glad to take it
[30:19] to akron praise god i never would have
[30:21] thought you know growing up you know we
[30:22] had the bible i never would have thought
[30:24] that i would have been in revelation
[30:25] chapter 10 verses 8 through 11 praise
[30:27] god but that's where i am i'm doing my
[30:29] part i'm taking it to akron praise god
[30:31] we're inviting them to come in akron
[30:32] praise god
[30:33] all over the world wherever they may see
[30:35] this they go through the internet we're
[30:36] inviting them i say contact me i'll help
[30:38] you find a message church we've done
[30:39] that numerous times
[30:41] people have contacted me numerous times
[30:42] and i've given them a contact for
[30:44] pastors now they've got a home church
[30:46] and now they've been baptized in jesus
[30:48] christ's name amen
[30:49] that's our that's our job we have to
[30:51] prophesy these things again tell the
[30:52] word of god again and god will back up
[30:55] our preaching amen
[30:56] hallelujah now
[30:58] here's just a summary before we get too
[30:59] far i believe the revelation form of the
[31:03] seventh seal
[31:04] has been revealed
[31:06] which is the revelation of the seven
[31:07] seal is that it is the day and hour of
[31:09] the rapture
[31:10] because there's silence in heaven when
[31:12] that seal is opened when the reality
[31:14] form is opened
[31:16] the reality form though of the rapture
[31:18] or the seventh seal has not happened yet
[31:20] because each seal has three forms and
[31:22] i'm going to show it to you hopefully
[31:23] it's so plain that we can't miss it
[31:26] now what do i believe about the thunders
[31:27] i believe the seven thunders have
[31:29] already uttered their voices
[31:31] when brother adam preached the seven
[31:32] seals in march of 1963
[31:36] the revelation of each seal was a
[31:38] thunder
[31:39] or it was god's voice giving us thus
[31:42] saith the lord on what the seals mean
[31:45] that's that's my humble opinion now i've
[31:47] talked to other brothers and brothers i
[31:48] love and brothers you love and people
[31:50] you know
[31:51] i talk to brothers we love
[31:54] and we've just come to this agreement we
[31:55] might disagree on it
[31:58] i don't believe the thunders are going
[31:59] to come in the future now what i have
[32:01] said though maybe a greater revelation
[32:03] of what's already in the seals will come
[32:05] to us
[32:07] but the reality is is that the
[32:09] revelation form has already been given
[32:11] to us
[32:12] okay so i'm not and church will show it
[32:14] to you plainly the thunders are not
[32:16] anything outside the bible they're
[32:18] everything that's in the bible praise
[32:19] god
[32:20] hallelujah because it was the book it
[32:22] was the book it was the bible that
[32:24] needed the revelation
[32:26] given to the people of god and that's
[32:28] exactly what brother branham gave us
[32:30] praise god brother bran was always
[32:31] pointing us back to the bible back to
[32:33] the scripture praise god and so that's
[32:35] that's that's the the kind of the
[32:37] short-term summary of that now let's
[32:39] prove it here by the by the grace of god
[32:40] we had our texts here
[32:43] now here's why this is so important
[32:44] church now think about this
[32:46] in revelation 10 that seven seal book is
[32:49] now those seals are loose comes down to
[32:51] earth
[32:52] brother branham preaches these
[32:54] seven seals and then he ends this sermon
[32:57] this is the last sermon of that series
[32:59] he said now the vision of the seven
[33:01] angels in the cloud plus the word about
[33:03] the seven seals plus the history
[33:06] plus the church ages all blend together
[33:08] so i could truly say
[33:10] that to the best of my understanding and
[33:12] according to the word of god and the
[33:14] vision and the revelation the
[33:15] interpretation thereof is thus saith the
[33:18] lord
[33:19] now church that's a statement
[33:21] did you catch
[33:22] that
[33:24] he's basically saying that revelation 10
[33:26] 7 is fulfilled thus saith the lord
[33:29] because the seal the the seals are loose
[33:31] and now the book's been brought down to
[33:33] earth and we have the revelation of it
[33:35] praise god
[33:36] that's such a powerful statement praise
[33:38] god it's not like this is my opinion
[33:40] it's thus saith the lord
[33:44] so if we have thus saith the lord then
[33:46] revelation 10 7 has to be already in the
[33:48] past it's already happened the book's
[33:50] already been uh the seals have already
[33:52] been taken off the book the book's been
[33:53] brought down the revelation's been
[33:55] preached to us and we've just got to eat
[33:57] the book how many eating the book
[33:58] tonight praise god amen i'm eating the
[34:00] book tonight amen you're reading the
[34:02] book tonight if you're hearing the word
[34:03] of god and receiving it praise god and
[34:06] it's thus saith the lord now some people
[34:08] stumble with this brother austin and
[34:09] they don't realize brother brahma it
[34:11] just means the revelations were thus
[34:13] saith the lord not every word on the
[34:15] tapes of the seven seals was thus saith
[34:17] the lord i'll give you two simple
[34:19] examples
[34:20] the first one is that brother braham
[34:21] says
[34:22] in the days of elijah only 700 didn't
[34:25] bow the knee
[34:27] but if you read your bible it's not 700
[34:29] how many is it
[34:31] 7 000.
[34:32] so not every word was thus saith the
[34:34] lord
[34:35] right now i know he corrected it later
[34:36] uh on the second to last sermon
[34:38] questions and answers on the seals
[34:40] but still those other words then on the
[34:42] on those tapes on the sermons were not
[34:44] thus saith the lord but notice what he
[34:46] says here church he says the revelation
[34:49] he says according to the vision the word
[34:51] of god and the revelation see the
[34:53] interpretation of the word of god that
[34:55] is thus saith the lord amen
[34:57] hallelujah now here let me give you
[34:58] another one i found this in a good book
[34:59] i've been reading lately here's another
[35:01] one i'm sorry that's so small yeah sorry
[35:03] it's so small why didn't i make that
[35:04] bigger
[35:07] okay this isn't here he makes another
[35:09] mistake now he says now you know it just
[35:11] goes to show that people without the
[35:13] baptism of the lord jesus christ and are
[35:15] not called to the office of a minister
[35:17] has no business to be in the pulpit
[35:19] that's right now look what now brother
[35:21] mark says something prideful here now
[35:22] watch
[35:23] i could take that person the preacher
[35:25] who doesn't believe in water baptism and
[35:27] now by the help of god i would tie them
[35:29] in such a knot to make their head swim
[35:33] now look what brother ram says
[35:35] he says look i don't care now i don't
[35:37] mean now now that don't sound right
[35:39] forgive me i didn't mean that lord i
[35:40] didn't now i felt him check me on that
[35:42] see i didn't mean to say that way i'm
[35:44] sorry i believe the holy spirit could
[35:46] reveal that to the person some secret
[35:48] that sounds better
[35:50] now look think and think about that
[35:52] that's a prideful statement right
[35:54] oh if i just had a chance to talk to
[35:56] that person i'd make their head swim my
[35:58] brother said oh the holy spirit just
[35:59] checked me on that that wasn't right
[36:00] thing to say
[36:02] he says he said just like you're tuning
[36:04] an instrument when you do something
[36:06] wrong and the church said
[36:09] you can tell it as a christian
[36:13] you said something wrong he didn't like
[36:16] that okay so now there's something on
[36:17] brother ram sermons in the seven seals
[36:20] that god doesn't like
[36:21] and the church said
[36:23] see and we're not going against brother
[36:25] ram we're just showing the reality that
[36:27] you have to rightly divide the brother
[36:29] ram sermons you have to
[36:35] and it's just it's it's wrong people are
[36:37] they're so afraid of people questioning
[36:39] whether they believe the message or not
[36:40] that they they'll say just statements
[36:42] that that are just obviously wrong like
[36:44] you can't correct brother branham and
[36:45] brother brahm has no mistakes and we
[36:47] believe everything on the tape it's so
[36:49] wrong
[36:50] it's so see it's fear motivated and not
[36:53] love motivated amen but perfect love
[36:55] casts out all fear amen let people say
[36:58] what they want they can say whatever
[36:59] they want i know what god says and i
[37:01] believe god's word and god is in our
[37:02] lives and god's cleansing our lives and
[37:04] god's preparing us for the catching away
[37:06] praise god
[37:07] let people say whatever they want but
[37:09] see when but the fact is they'll nev
[37:11] though rarely or never even take a hard
[37:14] question like that
[37:16] they won't even give their time for it
[37:17] they'll avoid it now church what does
[37:19] that remind you of an ostrich and
[37:21] ostrich puts his head in the sand right
[37:23] is that right
[37:24] is that right kids
[37:26] see they just they're scared of
[37:27] something or they're scared so they put
[37:29] their head in the sand they won't even
[37:30] look at it that's fear that's not love
[37:33] jesus didn't do that
[37:35] jesus didn't hide away from questions
[37:37] jesus didn't hide away from that why
[37:38] because he had the spirit of truth and
[37:40] if we have the spirit of truth then we
[37:42] will earnestly fight or contend for the
[37:44] truth
[37:48] now look brother man said see i was
[37:49] putting myself in there like i would tie
[37:51] him in a knot and spin his head around
[37:54] see i in the picture at all now church
[37:56] that will help us when we're witnessing
[37:57] right so that's why i was telling you
[37:59] when we were talking about witnessing
[38:01] you got to be led to witness
[38:03] because if either you can be in it or
[38:05] god's in it
[38:06] or you can both be in it praise god but
[38:08] you want to be in witnessing when you
[38:10] and god are in it praise god
[38:14] he said i don't even want to be myself
[38:16] or nothing it's him let him do the work
[38:19] he does the sound and the trump it's a
[38:20] mute the voice behind it one that gives
[38:22] it a sound
[38:24] all right
[38:25] does everybody see that now there's two
[38:26] examples not every word in the seven
[38:29] sermons or seven seals series was thus
[38:31] saith the lord
[38:32] but the revelations were
[38:35] now here's another example brotherhood
[38:36] said god don't have to apologize to
[38:38] nobody or nothing
[38:39] well brother adam just apologized
[38:42] so not every word of brother branham was
[38:43] thus saith the lord because god never
[38:45] has to apologize brother branham had to
[38:46] apologize
[38:47] i mean it's just it's just common sense
[38:49] i mean and a a two-year-old child can
[38:52] understand that
[38:53] god never makes mistakes all men make
[38:55] mistakes a baby you know not a baby but
[38:58] a toddler can understand that
[39:01] see but because of their fear or they
[39:03] don't want to lose their status or their
[39:04] popularity or their money or their
[39:06] income for preachers because they don't
[39:08] want to lose that then they can't
[39:09] address questions
[39:11] right they're scared to address
[39:12] questions but the real bride of christ
[39:15] is not afraid of questions amen she's
[39:17] been washed in the blood she know who
[39:19] saved her she know who sanctified her
[39:21] she knows who filler with the holy ghost
[39:22] she has the spirit of truth not the
[39:24] spirit of fear the spirit of truth and
[39:26] love and power and a sound mind amen
[39:28] that's what she's got
[39:30] now
[39:32] now revelation 5 showed how christ
[39:34] obtained redemption for us through the
[39:36] cross and resurrection we just looked at
[39:38] that now because of his victory we can
[39:40] become kings and priests unto god we'll
[39:42] reign with him on the earth and we reign
[39:44] over death
[39:46] which is the antichrist horse rider
[39:48] right now we're reigning over death
[39:49] right now
[39:50] i believe church that the pale horse
[39:52] rider is writing now
[39:55] so satan is writing through message
[39:57] churches now trying to bring spiritual
[39:59] death to them
[40:01] now he starts off with deception right
[40:04] but then he leads to wars and then he
[40:06] leads to money-making kingdoms and then
[40:08] he leads to spiritual death
[40:10] and all you have to do is look around
[40:11] and listen to people around the message
[40:13] it happens all the time because they'll
[40:14] go into uh they'll go into awful awful
[40:17] places they'll just go into the awful
[40:19] sins you think how could that happen
[40:20] it's because they don't discern the
[40:22] antichrist spirit
[40:24] they don't fall more in love with jesus
[40:26] like they should
[40:27] like we know they can sell out the
[40:30] anointing that they do have they can try
[40:32] to underfoot
[40:33] the son of god afresh the bible says
[40:36] that's right they can reject their
[40:37] salvation they can lose salvation
[40:40] they can't lose the holy ghost if
[40:41] they're born again but the fact that
[40:42] they do the sins they do shows they were
[40:44] never born
[40:45] born again to begin with
[40:47] now here's where we're going to get to
[40:48] some good uh hopefully some simple
[40:50] things here
[40:54] so christ took the book of redemption
[40:56] and loosed the seals
[40:58] in symbol form to john
[41:00] in 90 a.d
[41:02] so john saw the loosing on the isle of
[41:04] patmos he saw it by vision in 90 a.d
[41:07] there was great rejoicing and worship
[41:09] when the book was taken and loose
[41:11] because it held the mystery of
[41:12] redemption now let's look at the three
[41:14] forms of each seal i tried to say this
[41:16] on sunday now hopefully this is so
[41:18] simple uh
[41:21] now here's the quote there's actually
[41:22] two quotes right two two paragraphs in a
[41:24] row no okay just
[41:26] okay the end of this paragraph and then
[41:28] the start of a new paragraph
[41:29] okay now notice the first seal opened
[41:32] and it went opened in the symbol form it
[41:34] thundered now what about it when it's
[41:36] open in reality form
[41:38] so when oh now just let me get to this
[41:40] when brother adam preached the first
[41:41] seal when he said that was thus saith
[41:43] the lord that was the thunder
[41:45] in other words you didn't hear a thunder
[41:47] but it was god's voice amen
[41:49] it was god's voice giving brother brown
[41:51] the revelation the first seal and when
[41:52] brother brown preached the first seal it
[41:54] thundered in other words god spoke amen
[41:56] hallelujah god's revelation was preached
[41:58] in the first seal that was the
[42:00] thunder but you didn't hear a thunder
[42:02] now i thought it was really fitting that
[42:04] we had thunder on the way to church
[42:05] today did you ever hear that
[42:07] i said only god could plan this
[42:09] i've had that numerous times i preached
[42:10] on thunder and no thunder right out
[42:12] there
[42:13] it's just all god it's god just that's
[42:15] just a simple sign you know nothing
[42:17] nothing too spiritual
[42:18] he said now what about when it's open in
[42:20] the reality form
[42:22] it thundered as soon as the lamb struck
[42:24] back the seal in other words jesus took
[42:26] the first seal off what it revealed not
[42:28] all of itself first it's with god see
[42:30] first the revelations with god then it's
[42:32] in a symbol form john writes it down and
[42:35] then it's revealed three things it's
[42:37] coming forth from the throne first it
[42:39] can't be seen heard or nothing it's
[42:40] sealed up the lamb's blood played paid
[42:42] the price it thundered when he spoke out
[42:45] and when he did a white horse rider
[42:46] started out and it was still a symbol
[42:51] now here's the scripture he's saying now
[42:52] here's what we read this earlier
[42:54] when jesus broke the first seal he said
[42:58] when i when and i saw that when the lamb
[43:00] opened one of the seals i heard as it
[43:02] were the noise of thunder one of the
[43:04] four beasts saying come and see
[43:06] so can everybody see that when the first
[43:07] seal was broken there's a thunder can
[43:08] everybody say amen to that okay when the
[43:11] first seal is revealed thunder in other
[43:13] words god's talking
[43:14] god's voice is talking
[43:17] now here's what i want to show you
[43:19] uh this is one of the simple i've showed
[43:20] this six years ago so it's been a while
[43:22] i don't expect you to remember but i
[43:23] remember because i made it
[43:25] now the first seal was the same the
[43:27] first thunder the symbol form was in 80
[43:30] 90 when john saw it on the isle of
[43:31] patmos
[43:33] but the first seal in reality form
[43:34] started off at the early church
[43:37] it actually started before
[43:39] john if sorry when they got the holy
[43:41] ghost right because right after the holy
[43:43] ghost anointing went out and the line
[43:44] anointing then satan wrote as a white
[43:46] horse rider
[43:48] and it rode all the way to about 385 a.d
[43:51] went until the next anointing came now
[43:54] the revelation of the first seal came on
[43:56] march 18th
[43:58] 1963 praise god
[44:00] that's when we knew the revelation what
[44:02] did that white horse writer brother
[44:04] brown thought it was the holy spirit for
[44:05] so many years amen but when the
[44:07] revelation come it was the antichrist
[44:09] amen
[44:12] so the symbol form of the first seal was
[44:14] 80 90. the reality form was when he
[44:16] that's that writer that the antichrist
[44:18] spirit actually was battling the
[44:19] believers who had the line anointing on
[44:21] them like paul and peter and james and
[44:23] polycarp iranians all those mighty
[44:25] wonderful men of god women of god
[44:29] when was the revelation of the first
[44:31] seal given on march 18 1963
[44:36] all right
[44:38] the second seal same the symbol was the
[44:40] the year the symbol was given the same
[44:42] year same time
[44:44] but the reality form was the symbol was
[44:46] it was the ox anointing right
[44:49] these are the christians that gave their
[44:50] life more freely there was more of them
[44:52] that died during this time
[44:54] so almost from 400 a.d to almost 600
[44:57] years
[44:59] they had that ox anointing that was the
[45:00] reality form of the second seal and they
[45:03] battled that red horse rider because
[45:05] that's when the church and state united
[45:07] in rome
[45:09] that was the reality form of the second
[45:10] seal
[45:12] now the the revelation of the second
[45:14] seal though came on march 19th 1963.
[45:18] and that's when it thundered
[45:20] so this was a thunder this was the first
[45:22] thunder second thunder everybody seen
[45:24] the pattern so what's this going to be
[45:25] what's this going to be
[45:27] third thunder good what's this one going
[45:28] to be
[45:29] four thunder
[45:31] very simple
[45:32] it's the voice of god it's god's
[45:34] revelation it's god's speaking his
[45:36] revelation through a prophet amen
[45:38] hallelujah just like he said it's going
[45:40] to be like when a lion roars that's what
[45:42] he said in revelation 10. the line
[45:44] roaring represents a prophet god
[45:46] speaking through a prophet amen the
[45:47] seventh age messenger praise god the
[45:49] seventh angel the seventh church age
[45:51] messenger
[45:52] so the third seal was the third sunder
[45:55] third
[45:56] thunder sorry
[45:57] it's been a long day forgive me
[46:00] third seal was also the third thunder
[46:03] and it thundered on march 20th now the
[46:05] john got the symbol in 80 90
[46:08] the reality form took place around 1095
[46:11] to 1906. now we're getting close to our
[46:13] day
[46:15] so that black horse rider the dark ages
[46:18] so the dark ages lasted about you know
[46:20] so most of that time in there
[46:22] okay there's the thunder again so see
[46:23] the church like i told you because god
[46:25] knows what he's doing praise god it's
[46:26] just it's a vindication it's a natural
[46:28] vindication brother brother that's
[46:30] happened like five times now maybe i'm
[46:32] exaggerating at least four
[46:34] maybe three three at the at the least
[46:37] it just happens i don't know what god
[46:39] god
[46:40] he's just so faithful he's just so
[46:41] faithful now the fourth seal was the
[46:43] fourth thunder brother man preached the
[46:44] fourth seal on march 21st 1963. john saw
[46:48] though the fourth seal 86 or 90 a.d
[46:51] and the the the pale horse riders i said
[46:54] is writing now
[46:56] i have a quote brother ram said thus
[46:57] saith the lord he said the pentecostal
[46:59] church is spiritually dead thus saith
[47:00] the lord that means the pale horse rider
[47:03] has written into the ranks of the
[47:05] denominations that's true
[47:07] jesus said they had a name but they live
[47:09] but they're dead the denominations are
[47:11] dead and the church said
[47:13] when you were in denominations and some
[47:14] of you weren't thank god naomi wasn't
[47:16] but most of us were in denominations we
[47:17] were dead
[47:19] our souls were not quickened but when we
[47:21] came this message our souls came alive
[47:23] amen hallelujah praise god this word
[47:25] became alive it became living and it
[47:27] gave me a life and it changed my life
[47:29] amen it transformed my life amen
[47:33] hallelujah
[47:35] and it's transforming lives right now
[47:36] praise god austin alina praise god
[47:41] now let's go on the fifth seal was the
[47:44] the fifth thunder brother man preached
[47:45] on march 22nd
[47:47] john got the symbol same time now the
[47:49] reality form of the fist seal doesn't
[47:51] happen until after the rapture
[47:53] because remember in the fifth seal
[47:55] there's no horses anymore that means the
[47:57] antichrist spirit is done battling the
[47:59] spirit of christ in the in the in the
[48:01] gentile church
[48:02] so this is right after the rapture
[48:05] the the jews are going to say how long
[48:07] lord holy and true dost thou not avenge
[48:09] our blood upon them that are on the
[48:11] earth and the voice the lord is going to
[48:13] say back he's going to say just wait for
[48:15] a season
[48:16] a certain number of your martyrs have to
[48:18] be fulfilled
[48:19] and that's because church the jews put
[48:21] themselves under a blood curse did you
[48:23] know that
[48:25] when jesus was crucified
[48:27] the jews said let his blood be upon us
[48:29] because remember pilate washed his hands
[48:31] of the blood he said this man's blood is
[48:33] not on my hands and the jew said let his
[48:35] blood be upon us that's called the blood
[48:37] curse the jews got the blood curse
[48:40] that's why the jews have been slain over
[48:41] the years
[48:42] that's why they've been hated because
[48:44] they took the curse upon them
[48:46] now god's still going to save them
[48:48] the ones that are obedient to the word
[48:50] of god
[48:52] and there are some of them that have to
[48:53] be filled with the holy ghost to make
[48:54] the bride a bride from every nation
[48:57] because she has to be a full gentile
[48:59] bride with every nation represented like
[49:01] paul had the holy ghost peter had the
[49:02] holy ghost
[49:04] cornelius said holy ghost
[49:06] uh
[49:08] so
[49:09] next the sixth seal it was when brother
[49:11] and preached it was the sixth thunder on
[49:13] march 20 23 1963 the symbol form was 80
[49:17] 90 and the reality form
[49:19] is the future this hasn't happened yet
[49:22] because it's the last three and a half
[49:24] years of the tribulation period
[49:26] that's the sixth seal
[49:28] because remember that's the awful one
[49:30] that's the one when the the moon turns
[49:31] the blood brother austin that's the one
[49:33] when they hide in the dens in the caves
[49:34] and say rocks fall on us and kill us but
[49:37] they won't be able to find death
[49:38] that's the last three and a half years
[49:40] of the tribulation that's when the
[49:41] trumpets blow and that's when the vows
[49:43] are poured out upon all the wrath of god
[49:45] is poured out upon the earth
[49:47] that's the sixth seal the judgment seal
[49:49] now the seventh seal when brother
[49:51] brandon preached the revelation of it
[49:52] that was the seventh thunder
[49:55] and this is the future also the unknown
[49:57] day and hour the rapture and john saw
[50:00] there's no symbol but john
[50:01] heard about it in 80 90.
[50:04] okay now just so you know church i have
[50:06] all this on keynote or a powerpoint i
[50:08] can email it to anybody i've said many
[50:10] things that brother jose so if you're
[50:12] going to study it just let me know i can
[50:13] email to you tonight
[50:15] now here's a real deep well i'd say
[50:18] hope it's not a confusing visual
[50:20] this just shows over the last 2000 years
[50:22] so this is this is right after jesus was
[50:25] crucified resurrected
[50:26] these are all the seven church ages for
[50:28] the last 2000 years and this shows the
[50:30] three forms of the seals
[50:32] okay so stay with me try to look here
[50:34] can everybody say symbol form ready can
[50:35] you say it symbol symbol form was in 80
[50:38] 90. so that's when john saw these four
[50:40] horse riders right here
[50:41] now everybody say reality form ready
[50:44] the reality form was these years when
[50:46] the antichrist spirit battled the true
[50:48] spirit of christ it battled for this
[50:49] many years then it battled this for this
[50:51] many years then it battled the man
[50:52] anointing for this many years and now
[50:53] it's battling that eagle anointing amen
[50:56] that's our anointing amen the flying
[50:57] eagle praise god
[51:00] now everybody say revelation form ready
[51:02] revelation the revelation though didn't
[51:04] come until 1963 they didn't they didn't
[51:06] know what these meant they didn't even
[51:07] know it
[51:08] they just lived by the holy spirit that
[51:10] they lived under but we didn't get the
[51:11] revelation until revelation 10 7 said
[51:14] when it had to come it had to come at
[51:17] the end time praise god
[51:19] that's what daniel 12 says let's go to
[51:21] daniel 12 4.
[51:24] daniel 12 4.
[51:26] yeah i think i read this on sunday
[51:27] didn't i sunday night do you remember
[51:28] that one that's one where knowledge will
[51:30] be increased and he said seal those
[51:32] things up until the end time
[51:34] hallelujah praise god
[51:36] thank you lord
[51:39] only god could orchestrate that
[51:42] only god could do that
[51:43] daniel 12.
[51:46] that's why i just you know that's
[51:48] and i forget to tell some of my friends
[51:49] i forget to tell them that when i preach
[51:50] this god thunders you know i'm not
[51:52] joking it has happened numerous times at
[51:55] least three times at least
[51:56] daniel 12
[51:58] thank you jesus
[52:06] daniel 12 4 but thou o daniel shut up
[52:09] the words
[52:10] and seal the book
[52:12] even to the time of the end many shall
[52:14] run to and fro and knowledge shall be
[52:16] increased so see look the bible even
[52:18] says even daniel's prophecy which was
[52:20] about the gentiles and the jews it's
[52:22] sealed up to the end time they won't
[52:24] understand it to the end time but here
[52:26] we have a book of revelation the bible
[52:28] says that it would be it would be
[52:29] revealed in the end time praise god
[52:32] and then it's got to be taken it's got
[52:33] to be preached to every gentile nation
[52:35] praise god
[52:37] hallelujah
[52:39] amen
[52:40] now if you want a picture of that i'll
[52:41] be happy to email you that
[52:46] have i gone over anybody's head yet
[52:48] okay
[52:50] look i haven't gotten to the quotes yet
[52:53] now just you know there are quotes on
[52:54] both sides brother i'm grew in his
[52:55] understanding of some of these things
[52:57] but there's clearly quotes on our side
[52:59] that are to me they they make the
[53:01] they're the only ones that make sense
[53:03] according to the thus saith the lord
[53:04] that we have about the seven seals
[53:06] it's the only one that makes sense
[53:09] now here's just a closer picture so see
[53:11] the symbol form was when john saw a
[53:13] vision i just tried to blow up that
[53:14] picture
[53:15] okay
[53:16] every seal all seven seals have a symbol
[53:18] form except the seventh all we know is
[53:20] that they're silenced in heaven so
[53:21] that's really the only symbol they're
[53:22] silenced in heaven the angel stops
[53:24] singing
[53:26] okay
[53:27] that's the fir every seal has three
[53:29] forms
[53:30] symbol
[53:32] here's the reality form i put them in i
[53:34] put them in numbers for you
[53:37] see the first seal in reality took place
[53:40] during these years the first seal the
[53:42] white horse rider the reality of the
[53:43] second seal took place here
[53:47] there it is again
[53:50] has to be god
[53:52] third seal the reality of that
[53:55] dark horse rider took place during these
[53:57] years that's the reality form
[54:00] the fourth seal was 1906 to the present
[54:02] day that that payless rider is writing
[54:05] today spiritual death
[54:07] and brother ram said he's going to make
[54:09] his final ride and he's going to take
[54:11] all those people to the battle of
[54:12] armageddon that's his final ride
[54:16] that antichrist spirit because remember
[54:18] after armageddon doesn't does the jesus
[54:19] throw that antichrist spirit in the lake
[54:21] of fire
[54:22] now he don't get rid of satan after the
[54:23] next thousand years but he gets rid of
[54:25] that and that beast there it is right
[54:26] there you have that beast amen he takes
[54:28] his final ride in the pope antichrist
[54:33] and at the end at armageddon he takes
[54:35] the pope antichrist and he throws him in
[54:36] the fire
[54:38] that's his final ride
[54:40] okay
[54:42] now the fifth seal is after the rapture
[54:43] the six seals the last three and a half
[54:44] years the tribulation the seven seals
[54:46] the day and now the rapture so the this
[54:47] one this one's out of order right here
[54:49] but it doesn't matter because seven
[54:50] always represents completion seven has
[54:52] to be completion
[54:54] and if you look at the scripture what
[54:55] else would make heaven silent
[54:58] and the bible says in first
[54:59] thessalonians 4 that jesus will come
[55:01] down and meet us in the air amen praise
[55:03] god he's got to leave heaven that body
[55:05] has to leave heaven it's got to come
[55:06] down and meet his bride in the air
[55:08] praise god
[55:09] like isaac met rebecca out in the field
[55:11] not in the house but in the field praise
[55:13] god
[55:14] amen
[55:17] and the revelation form of the seven
[55:19] seals came in 1963.
[55:24] now there were so many things brother
[55:25] there's things i'm forgetting now
[55:26] brother jose bought me a book about 1963
[55:29] there were so many important things
[55:30] about 1963 i forgot i forgot him now but
[55:33] there's numerous
[55:34] just things started going crazy after
[55:36] 1963.
[55:37] the enemy was fighting against the truth
[55:39] and the revelation there were so many
[55:41] uh awful sinful things that happened in
[55:42] america and around the world after 63.
[55:45] now some of them are like abortion you
[55:46] know no prayer in school no no no bible
[55:49] reading in school some of those
[55:51] but after 63 it's like everything went
[55:53] down
[55:54] you could it's proven by educational
[55:56] studies and everything we've seen them
[55:58] even kent hovind who's not even a
[55:59] message believer he's like a creationist
[56:01] guy even he had charts and it started in
[56:04] the 63 it started going down all the
[56:06] test scores all the stds went up all the
[56:09] all the murders everything something
[56:11] happened in 63.
[56:13] praise
[56:14] god
[56:16] so now it seems like uh this is
[56:19] a little deeper here i just thought i'd
[56:21] share this i don't know why hopefully
[56:22] this doesn't throw anybody off here
[56:24] it seems john saw this seven seal vision
[56:27] in 90 a.d
[56:29] but it was a vision of what would take
[56:31] place in reality
[56:33] in 1963.
[56:35] so here's what i mean
[56:37] in 1963 i believe in heaven now they're
[56:40] they're not they're not bound by our
[56:42] years but
[56:43] i believe in heaven that was when jesus
[56:45] actually loosed the seals in heaven
[56:47] on that book that's my humble opinion
[56:51] right because in march of 63 the book
[56:53] had to come down to earth as thus saith
[56:55] the lord we got the revelation of that
[56:56] book thus saith the lord
[56:58] either that's wrong or it's right well
[57:00] to me it's right because everything in
[57:02] the bible lines up with those
[57:03] revelations amen it has to be
[57:06] and no man has ever had a gift like
[57:07] brother branham praise god no it's not
[57:09] even close praise god
[57:11] not even close
[57:12] no one's had a scriptural ministry like
[57:14] william branham
[57:15] like like i said in my book i got 30
[57:17] thus the 8th of the lord's in that book
[57:18] 30.
[57:20] who what other preacher has that
[57:22] none of them have it praise god amen
[57:24] we've been visited by god hallelujah
[57:26] amen
[57:27] the mighty angels come down the holy
[57:29] spirit praise god and given us thus
[57:31] saith the lord praise god
[57:33] amen that's exciting amen that's a
[57:35] blessing praise god
[57:38] now that may be over your head if so
[57:40] just
[57:40] push it off to the side that took me
[57:42] years to get to so it might take you
[57:43] years to get to too
[57:45] it took me years to try to understand
[57:46] that now this is my personal opinion
[57:48] because brother rams does state the
[57:49] lord's statements from the seal sermons
[57:52] and also it's his quote about the seven
[57:54] the revelation 10 7 is history
[57:58] uh seem to point to this fact okay
[58:04] now i'm going to uh skip
[58:06] skip past this for time's sake yeah it's
[58:08] almost 8 o'clock austin needs to get to
[58:10] bed too he told me so
[58:12] unless some powerful anointing comes on
[58:13] him but i'm gonna
[58:14] there's a time and season for everything
[58:15] brother there's a time to sleep there's
[58:16] a time to stay awake
[58:18] i mean that sincerely i i understand
[58:21] i've been there before
[58:23] uh i'm gonna skip past this
[58:25] these are just the four horses what they
[58:26] mean i'm skipping past that most of you
[58:29] know that
[58:31] um i just want to stay on the thunders
[58:32] and the seals here tonight
[58:34] now brother branham if you listen to
[58:36] these sermons about the seven seals i
[58:38] would encourage you about austin and
[58:39] lena to listen to those sermons those
[58:40] are some of the most powerful sermons
[58:42] i've ever listened to
[58:44] they're absolutely
[58:46] anointed now like i said there's a few
[58:48] human errors in there but but
[58:49] everybody's human
[58:51] but nothing's wrong with the word as far
[58:53] as i can see
[58:54] as far as i can see the revelations of
[58:56] the seals i'm talking about
[58:59] but in on each sermon brother austin
[59:01] alina you can hear brother branham will
[59:03] tell about that earlier that morning
[59:04] before it came to the preach early that
[59:06] morning when the holy spirit visited him
[59:08] and he said i for
[59:10] many of them sound like this there's a
[59:12] light there's a ball of light hanging in
[59:14] the room and i see a vision of the seal
[59:16] and i spend the rest of it after it
[59:17] leaves i spend the rest of the day
[59:18] writing it down and making sure the bot
[59:20] man searching the scripture making sure
[59:22] this lines up with the whole bible
[59:25] and that's why after the second seal he
[59:26] can get up and he say that's thus saith
[59:28] the lord
[59:30] who does that nobody only a prophet
[59:33] i don't do that no preacher does it only
[59:35] a prophet does that amen hallelujah
[59:40] he said he would be numb for hours
[59:41] afterwards and he would just spend the
[59:43] rest of the day after he kind of coming
[59:45] out of that numbness writing down
[59:46] checking it and he said he said i got to
[59:48] check it by the world word because paul
[59:51] said though an angel
[59:54] teach anything other than what i
[59:56] preached let him be cursed amen
[59:59] so brother and brother ben had to spend
[1:00:00] the rest of the day making sure what
[1:00:02] this light showed him what this angel
[1:00:03] showed him he had to make sure it was
[1:00:05] the word that's why we love we have a
[1:00:07] word-based prophet praise god
[1:00:09] he didn't point us away from the bible
[1:00:11] he pointed us to the bible praise god
[1:00:14] now i'm not going to preach on that
[1:00:15] because i've already read through them i
[1:00:16] preached them well that's probably been
[1:00:18] 12 years ago i preached on that that's
[1:00:20] been a long time
[1:00:22] now the seven thunders are connected to
[1:00:24] the seven seals because christ takes
[1:00:26] that book that had the seals on it
[1:00:29] and then it's open then the open book
[1:00:31] after the seven seals are loose it's
[1:00:32] brought to earth and then the seven
[1:00:34] thunders are the seven voices of god or
[1:00:36] the seven revelations uttered on earth
[1:00:40] okay now i'm gonna skip past uh okay
[1:00:42] brother branham said revelation 10 1-7
[1:00:44] was history meaning the open book has
[1:00:47] already been brought to earth and the
[1:00:49] seven thunders already uttered their
[1:00:51] voices it's already done
[1:00:56] now here's the quote where he says it
[1:00:58] it's uh brother austin it's let's see
[1:00:59] it's uh
[1:01:00] five months before he died
[1:01:03] he said what happened on mount sunset
[1:01:05] he's talking about when the angels met
[1:01:07] him that cloud out there the angels met
[1:01:09] him and i think he met them by vision
[1:01:12] because i don't think he was there
[1:01:14] when that picture was taken i think he
[1:01:15] meant it by vision
[1:01:17] i don't know for sure i'm not god i
[1:01:19] don't know
[1:01:20] what happened on mount sunset god was
[1:01:22] confirming his word that's what all this
[1:01:24] noise is about notice it's god's
[1:01:26] fulfilling his promised word again of
[1:01:28] revelation 10 1-7
[1:01:31] and the days of the sounding of the
[1:01:32] seventh angel's message the mystery of
[1:01:34] god should be finished the hidden
[1:01:36] mystery of revelation 10 1-7 the last
[1:01:38] message to the last church age fulfills
[1:01:41] exactly in this age saint luke 17 30
[1:01:44] even thou shalt be when the son of man
[1:01:45] is real i could have the girl stand up
[1:01:46] and say that but i'm not going to
[1:01:48] i could have you all recite that you'd
[1:01:50] probably get like 90 right you know
[1:01:52] because you forget a little bit every
[1:01:53] week if you don't practice it again
[1:01:54] the day when the son of man is revealed
[1:01:56] now he skips a few paragraphs and he
[1:01:58] says and the god of heaven promised the
[1:02:01] evening time would have evening lights
[1:02:02] three years ago this mystery the mystery
[1:02:04] of what revelation 10 7
[1:02:06] it was a prophecy amen what time is it
[1:02:09] sir but now it's history it's past the
[1:02:12] promise is fulfilled praise god
[1:02:14] so brother says revelation 10 1 to 7 is
[1:02:17] history now he doesn't say thus saith
[1:02:18] the lord that's why i leave some wiggle
[1:02:20] room there if i'm wrong
[1:02:22] but i know thus saith the lord the seven
[1:02:23] seals have been revealed
[1:02:25] well that means all the mystery of god
[1:02:27] is fulfilled well that means revelation
[1:02:28] 10 7 has to be fulfilled
[1:02:31] that's why this supports
[1:02:33] i believe are understanding the best
[1:02:36] and this is nothing i would argue about
[1:02:38] this is nothing i would fight about fuss
[1:02:39] about
[1:02:41] it's just my humble opinion
[1:02:43] based upon the scripture and then i get
[1:02:45] natural vindication as well or you might
[1:02:47] call it supernatural or vindication
[1:02:49] whatever you want to call it praise god
[1:02:53] god is so merciful what time is it sir
[1:02:56] and what's this attraction god
[1:02:57] fulfilling his word he's the same
[1:02:59] yesterday today and forever
[1:03:02] now there's two brother random quotes
[1:03:03] after the seals that explain that the
[1:03:06] voices of the seven thunders were were
[1:03:08] the revelations contained in the seven
[1:03:10] seal sermons
[1:03:12] someone read this again
[1:03:14] i'm to read these two quotes
[1:03:16] brother branham says the seven thunders
[1:03:19] were what the seals were all about
[1:03:21] in other words the revelation of the
[1:03:23] seven thunders was the seven seals
[1:03:26] so the white horse rider that being the
[1:03:28] antichrist that was the first thunder
[1:03:31] okay
[1:03:32] the lion the lion
[1:03:34] being the uh bold anointing of the holy
[1:03:36] ghost on the saints the beginning that
[1:03:37] was the thunder praise god that's the
[1:03:38] first thunder
[1:03:40] and it repeats for the rest of the six
[1:03:41] thunders
[1:03:44] church they ask him this point blank
[1:03:47] and look this is a year and five months
[1:03:49] after he preached the seals
[1:03:52] have the seven thunders which equal
[1:03:54] seven mysteries already been revealed
[1:03:56] were they revealed in the seven seals
[1:03:58] but are not yet known to us at
[1:04:00] as the thunders yet
[1:04:02] no
[1:04:03] they were revealed in the seven seals
[1:04:06] that's what the thunders was about
[1:04:11] they was to reveal the seven thunders
[1:04:13] had to utter their voices and no one
[1:04:14] could make out what it was john knew
[1:04:15] what it was but he was forbidden to
[1:04:17] write it he said but the seventh angel
[1:04:19] the days of his sounding the seven
[1:04:20] mysteries of the seventh hundreds would
[1:04:21] be revealed and the seventh angel is a
[1:04:23] messenger of the seventh church age see
[1:04:26] and that's all he says
[1:04:28] but he says they were they were they
[1:04:30] were revealed in the seven seals that's
[1:04:32] what the thunders was about
[1:04:34] so the thunders uttered what the
[1:04:36] revelations were of the seven seals
[1:04:40] in the church age book which brother ram
[1:04:42] read over he said at least a couple of
[1:04:43] times he read over this book
[1:04:48] now the messenger of malachi 4 brother
[1:04:50] branham and revelation 10 7 brother
[1:04:51] branham is going to do two things one
[1:04:54] according to malachi 4 he'll turn the
[1:04:56] hearts of the children of the fathers
[1:04:57] how many god have turned heart to the
[1:04:58] fathers
[1:04:59] how many have a heart that loves the
[1:05:00] bible praise god
[1:05:02] and you you want to see paul's gospel
[1:05:04] manifested in your life
[1:05:05] that's what the heart of the fathers
[1:05:07] means you want to live just like the
[1:05:08] apostles lived
[1:05:10] amen
[1:05:12] the second thing brother brahma was
[1:05:13] going to do he'll reveal the mysteries
[1:05:15] of the seven thunders
[1:05:17] in revelation 10 which are the
[1:05:18] revelations contained in the seven seals
[1:05:21] amen
[1:05:22] it will be these divinely revealed
[1:05:24] mystery truths that literally turn the
[1:05:26] hearts of the children to the
[1:05:27] pentecostal fathers exactly so
[1:05:32] praise god
[1:05:34] so the way i understand that is that
[1:05:38] the rev especially for us the revelation
[1:05:40] of the fourth seal showed us that we
[1:05:42] need the holy ghost anointing the
[1:05:44] baptism of the holy ghost in our lives
[1:05:47] would produce an eagle-like character
[1:05:49] amen
[1:05:50] saints that could watch and pray saints
[1:05:52] that could live in heavenly places
[1:05:54] church you're living in heavenly places
[1:05:55] praise god amen if you haven't yet talk
[1:05:58] to a denominational person they're not
[1:05:59] living in heavenly places like you
[1:06:01] praise god
[1:06:04] we battle for a little bit like the
[1:06:05] eagle will land for a little bit but
[1:06:06] then we rise up above that praise god
[1:06:08] we're living above that in heavenly
[1:06:10] places praise god amen we're not worried
[1:06:12] about things we're trusting in the
[1:06:13] living god hallelujah
[1:06:16] we're not worried about earthly things
[1:06:18] we're we're flying we're we're soaring
[1:06:21] we're watching for us coming we're
[1:06:22] praying we're trusting in the living god
[1:06:24] that's our anointing the holy ghost
[1:06:26] anointing praise god
[1:06:28] and that means our hearts are turned
[1:06:30] our hearts are turned back to the
[1:06:31] apostolic fathers
[1:06:35] so
[1:06:36] they were revealed
[1:06:38] and he will reveal them well brother
[1:06:40] adam's gone so he's not going to come
[1:06:41] back and reveal him that means they're
[1:06:43] revealed
[1:06:46] now here if you uh you don't have to get
[1:06:47] your bible because i'm trying to it's
[1:06:48] already 8 o'clock mercy
[1:06:51] that busy body
[1:06:53] there's many there's numerous scriptures
[1:06:55] there's probably
[1:06:57] probably 10 scriptures that say the
[1:06:58] thunder a thunder is the voice of god
[1:07:01] so here's the first one let's read this
[1:07:03] together one two three ready the lord
[1:07:05] thundered from heaven and the most high
[1:07:08] uttered his voice okay so when god
[1:07:10] thunders it's the voice of god
[1:07:14] hallelujah job said after it a voice
[1:07:17] roarth he thunders with the voice of his
[1:07:19] excellency and he will not stay them
[1:07:21] with his when his voice is heard god
[1:07:24] thundereth marvelously with his let's
[1:07:26] all say together with his voice
[1:07:28] a thunder is a voice it's a speaking
[1:07:31] it's a word of god
[1:07:34] the lord also thundered in the heavens
[1:07:36] and and his highest gave his what gave
[1:07:39] his
[1:07:40] voice hailstones and goals of fire
[1:07:43] the voice of the lord is upon the waters
[1:07:45] read this word the glory of god what
[1:07:48] thundereth
[1:07:49] the lord is upon many waters the voice
[1:07:51] of the lord
[1:07:54] jesus says this as well
[1:07:57] the bible said therefore uh the people
[1:07:59] therefore that stood by heard it and
[1:08:01] said it thunder so
[1:08:03] people were standing around jesus and
[1:08:05] god literally spoke from heaven and they
[1:08:07] said if they we heard a voice and it
[1:08:09] thundered
[1:08:11] and they said an angel spoke but jesus
[1:08:13] answer said this voice came not because
[1:08:15] of me but for your sakes so even jesus
[1:08:18] christ said a voice of god thunders
[1:08:20] praise god
[1:08:22] amen and look even if you were in heaven
[1:08:25] if you were in heaven right now in the
[1:08:26] seventh dimension what you'd be seeing
[1:08:28] is thunderings voices and lightnings and
[1:08:32] hallelujah praise god amen in other
[1:08:34] words heaven is a loud place praise god
[1:08:37] we just heard a little bit of thunder
[1:08:38] here tonight
[1:08:39] there's thunderings lightnings and
[1:08:41] voices and all kinds of things coming
[1:08:43] out of the throne of god right now
[1:08:44] praise god in heaven
[1:08:47] and there's seven lamps of fire
[1:08:50] burning before the throne which are the
[1:08:51] seven spirits of god
[1:08:53] praise god
[1:08:55] those are not seven different holy
[1:08:56] spirits it's the same holy spirit that
[1:08:58] was sent to every age
[1:09:01] and god just represents his ages that
[1:09:02] way remember he has seven stars
[1:09:04] seven church age messengers he has seven
[1:09:06] candlesticks in heaven he has seven
[1:09:08] fires before his throne as well god
[1:09:10] loves seven
[1:09:11] amen
[1:09:13] here's some more quotes here i'm trying
[1:09:14] to finish here
[1:09:16] now let me see how many quotes i got
[1:09:17] just so i can check
[1:09:19] one
[1:09:20] okay that's two three four
[1:09:22] five
[1:09:26] okay yeah let's just finish this and
[1:09:28] then we'll pick up more on the seven
[1:09:30] seal maybe lord willing next week okay
[1:09:33] okay so i know quotes uh everybody take
[1:09:35] a deep breath ready
[1:09:36] take a deep breath okay here first seal
[1:09:38] quote now let us find the symbols we
[1:09:40] found out that or what a thunder means
[1:09:43] that's perfectly we know the thunder was
[1:09:45] the voice of god when the seal was
[1:09:46] opened
[1:09:48] okay
[1:09:49] and then let's remember revelation 6 1
[1:09:52] when that first seal was opened a
[1:09:54] thunder went off
[1:09:55] the noise of a what noise of a
[1:09:58] thunder
[1:09:59] so that's why when brother adam preached
[1:10:01] the revelation the first seal it was a
[1:10:03] thunder because it was god's voice
[1:10:06] it was god saying this is the antichrist
[1:10:08] spirit through deception and he was and
[1:10:11] he was to go combat against the lion
[1:10:13] anointing in the saints that's thus
[1:10:15] saith the lord
[1:10:16] amen
[1:10:21] okay so this at the bottom i put this is
[1:10:23] why i believe
[1:10:24] each revelation of each of the seven
[1:10:26] seals was a thunder making seven
[1:10:29] thunders in march of 1963
[1:10:32] john heard thunders at the symbol form
[1:10:33] of revelation chapter 6 and revelation
[1:10:36] chapter 10.
[1:10:38] so john just saw the symbols of
[1:10:39] revelation 6 in revelation 10 and it
[1:10:41] thundered then too
[1:10:43] oh my praise god amen
[1:10:47] okay now i'm going to skip to this one
[1:10:48] okay this is the most important quote so
[1:10:50] everybody just hang on just for a minute
[1:10:51] please
[1:10:54] when i saw this i just i just smiled i i
[1:10:57] don't know if i cried but
[1:10:58] nature i just smiled i thought oh how
[1:11:00] come i never i don't remember this i got
[1:11:02] so happy
[1:11:03] actually a brother brother jason demars
[1:11:05] helped me with this one
[1:11:07] now look look what he says everyone has
[1:11:09] come to me and said brother branham
[1:11:11] them seven thunders
[1:11:13] that the voice uttered and he said write
[1:11:15] it not see but close it up said that'll
[1:11:17] be seven thunders that will be revealed
[1:11:19] in the last days see seven thunders
[1:11:20] that'll tell us
[1:11:22] now doesn't that sound real good
[1:11:25] see but watch what you're talking about
[1:11:27] when you say that so people would come
[1:11:29] up to brother branham and pressure him
[1:11:30] like i'll use austin hey brother brother
[1:11:32] brother branham
[1:11:34] don't you think those seven thunders
[1:11:35] that weren't written don't you think
[1:11:36] it's going to come to somebody in the
[1:11:37] end time
[1:11:40] right
[1:11:42] and brother bram said but watch what
[1:11:43] you're talking about
[1:11:45] he said see that you write it not
[1:11:47] these seven thunders out of their voices
[1:11:49] see don't write that but it's to be
[1:11:50] sealed up in the book to the last days
[1:11:53] i'm going to go back to brother austin
[1:11:54] here
[1:11:56] now some
[1:11:57] he said some of some someone has been
[1:11:59] many has been saying to me and
[1:12:01] theologians said brother branham if the
[1:12:03] lord with your experience has given you
[1:12:06] these things for his people
[1:12:09] wouldn't you be eligible to write a
[1:12:10] bible yourself and
[1:12:12] the word if god has manifested you
[1:12:16] so see in other words brother and i'm
[1:12:17] saying people have pressured me to write
[1:12:19] a book and reveal the seven thunders
[1:12:21] because they're not in the bible but
[1:12:22] brahm says no that's wrong the seven
[1:12:24] thunders are in the bible
[1:12:27] look what he says
[1:12:30] i said that might be true see but he was
[1:12:31] trying to catch me so see brother man
[1:12:33] caught his spirit he's trying to get him
[1:12:35] to add to the bible
[1:12:37] i said but you see i couldn't do that he
[1:12:39] said he said why couldn't you you have
[1:12:41] all the qualifications you see visions
[1:12:43] you say thus saith the lord you have
[1:12:45] healings miracles you have a pillar of
[1:12:46] fire picture you have all these
[1:12:48] qualifications to write your own bible
[1:12:50] about the seven thunders
[1:12:52] i said but look
[1:12:54] one word cannot be added or taken away
[1:12:57] hallelujah amen that's a real prophet
[1:13:00] right there the devil comes up and gives
[1:13:02] them a proposition hey i got a book idea
[1:13:03] for you
[1:13:04] i'll add something outside of the bible
[1:13:08] and brother brahm says no you
[1:13:10] i see what you're trying to say but
[1:13:12] you're wrong
[1:13:13] you cannot add one thing or take one
[1:13:15] thing away from this holy book right
[1:13:16] here
[1:13:20] he said well well that well then what
[1:13:21] about them seven thunders you see
[1:13:23] wouldn't them seven thunders blasting
[1:13:25] out won't that be a revelation be give
[1:13:28] to some man
[1:13:30] i said no sir
[1:13:32] it would be adding something to it or
[1:13:35] taking away something from it
[1:13:38] he said it's all revealed in there
[1:13:41] and the seven seals opened up the
[1:13:44] revelation of what that was
[1:13:48] hallelujah amen so the seven thunder or
[1:13:50] the seven seals
[1:13:52] opened up the revelation of the seven
[1:13:53] thunders now we know what the thunders
[1:13:55] are they're the voices of god telling us
[1:13:57] what the seven seals said okay i hope
[1:14:01] everybody catches it here tonight by
[1:14:02] god's grace
[1:14:03] that's what it was see it's still in the
[1:14:05] word you see you can't get out of that
[1:14:07] word it won't leave the word amen
[1:14:10] and god's spirit will never leave that
[1:14:12] word
[1:14:13] it'll stay right with the word blinding
[1:14:15] some
[1:14:16] and open the eyes of others it'll always
[1:14:18] do that
[1:14:19] and the church said
[1:14:22] so see we have nothing to worry about
[1:14:24] the revelation the seven thunders even
[1:14:25] if we don't got it right it's not
[1:14:27] outside the bible it's in the bible
[1:14:29] and so what do we keep doing we keep
[1:14:31] preaching the bible praise god amen we
[1:14:33] keep learning more about the bible
[1:14:34] growing more in the bible studying the
[1:14:36] bible loving the bible
[1:14:38] and so we have nothing to worry about if
[1:14:39] we're born again the holy spirit will
[1:14:41] only point us to the word of god praise
[1:14:43] god
[1:14:44] now i believe i just
[1:14:46] by god's grace i've studied and prayed
[1:14:47] about this i fast whenever i study and
[1:14:49] usually
[1:14:51] i just people got the right
[1:14:52] interpretation
[1:14:54] and i haven't seen anything now i've
[1:14:55] been helped by numerous preachers over
[1:14:57] the years i've been helped it just
[1:14:57] didn't all come down like through prayer
[1:14:59] i've been helped by numerous preachers
[1:15:01] over the years
[1:15:02] but to me this is the best way to make
[1:15:03] this out
[1:15:05] it's the it's the only way it makes
[1:15:06] sense to me
[1:15:08] the seven thunders can't be anything
[1:15:09] outside the word they have to be about
[1:15:11] the seven seals
[1:15:14] now i'm not going to go on this tonight
[1:15:15] because uh they
[1:15:17] you know
[1:15:18] uh jeffersonville is saying there are
[1:15:19] things they want to say
[1:15:21] i disagree
[1:15:26] uh it's already 8 10. so
[1:15:30] i better stop here
[1:15:31] let's stand our feet here god bless the
[1:15:33] livestreamers love you all
