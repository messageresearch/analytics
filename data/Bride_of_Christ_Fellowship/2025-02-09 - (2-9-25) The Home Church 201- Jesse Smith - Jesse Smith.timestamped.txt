[0:00] chapter six we'll start there by God's
[0:05] gra so I want to take one more service
[0:08] here and look at the home church as we
[0:09] looked at on Wednesday night dealing
[0:11] with uh the home church and things that
[0:13] are going on so hopefully after today we
[0:17] can move on to the other series or just
[0:19] as the Lord would lead by the grace of
[0:21] God uh the first part will be live I'm
[0:23] going to put this on a live stream
[0:25] because some people follow our services
[0:26] they don't have a home church and uh
[0:28] they pay ties so I want them to hear the
[0:30] word of God um as far as what pertains
[0:34] that can be said publicly and then I'll
[0:36] share a few things privately as as I
[0:38] often do by God's grace I try to give um
[0:41] Grace you know
[0:44] U and I trust to be a helped to you by
[0:46] the grace of the Lord so I'm just going
[0:48] to call this the home Church 2011
[0:50] Wednesday was home Church 101 so that's
[0:52] like the introduction and uh 2011 would
[0:55] be like the Second Step by God's grace
[0:57] so um but again I'm going to focus kind
[0:59] of on the situation here um Proverbs
[1:04] 6:16 this was the scripture brother
[1:06] Dennis McBride used on his Saturday
[1:09] night service the spirit of a tail
[1:10] Bearer this was one of the scriptures so
[1:13] if you haven't gone listen back the uh
[1:17] you're probably missing out and you want
[1:18] to go back and listen if you haven't
[1:21] listened to brother Den McBride's
[1:22] sermons Spirit of a terar barrow and the
[1:24] spirit of resentment if you haven't done
[1:26] it uh you're you're probably uh going to
[1:29] miss some things things uh things that
[1:31] are going on because it was given to us
[1:34] uh a man praying and fasting and feeling
[1:36] LED of the Holy Ghost so uh it was given
[1:38] to us important sermon there to help us
[1:41] understand uh where we are by God's
[1:44] grace so Proverbs Chapter
[1:52] 6 16 616
[2:03] so we'll read 16 down to 20 and then I
[2:05] want to go back to Matthew 18 let's just
[2:06] read that for a little review there uh
[2:08] by the grace of God because that's even
[2:09] being played out today um Proverbs 6:16
[2:13] I'll read this only these six things
[2:15] doth the Lord hate so these are hateful
[2:18] things to God and if God hates it we
[2:21] want to hate it if God loves it we want
[2:23] to love
[2:24] it 19 is where brother Dennis was
[2:27] emphasizing but let's read uh or let me
[2:29] read yay seven are an Abomination unto
[2:31] him a proud
[2:33] look a lying tongue and that can mean
[2:36] also not telling the full
[2:38] truth it can mean misr misrepresenting
[2:42] the truth telling a Hal truth it just
[2:44] doesn't mean well you lied and said this
[2:46] was green and but it was orange it can
[2:48] be just slightly just not telling all
[2:50] the all the
[2:54] story and hands that shed innocent blood
[2:58] think of the abor pors in America and
[3:01] heart that devises Wicked
[3:04] imaginations so a heart that will devise
[3:06] Something Wicked uh against someone else
[3:09] feet that are Swift in running to
[3:12] Mischief a false witness that speaketh
[3:15] lies so look a lying tongue and a false
[3:17] witness that's so anyone that would join
[3:19] that lying that's another thing God
[3:22] hates to join a
[3:24] lie verse 19 and he that sth Discord
[3:28] among the Brethren and that's the
[3:29] scripture brother Dennis was empathizing
[3:31] with the Spear of a tail Bearer so
[3:34] gossiping uh pitting people dividing
[3:37] putting people against each other how
[3:39] many remember that by God's grace
[3:40] anybody remember that praise God okay
[3:42] Matthew
[3:54] 18:15 recently I had to talk with an
[3:56] individual about Matthew 18 and uh that
[3:59] individual was just amazed that I had to
[4:01] carry this out and he said he said I
[4:03] just want to thank you for obeying the
[4:05] word of
[4:07] God so we've tried to obey the word of
[4:09] God when other people see you obeying
[4:11] the word of God if they're a real
[4:12] believer if they're really right with
[4:14] God they'll appreciate someone who can
[4:16] fulfill the word of
[4:18] God Matthew
[4:20] 18:15 uh I'll read
[4:23] um
[4:26] 15 16 and then um we'll read 17 together
[4:31] moreover If thy brother shall trespass
[4:33] against thee go and tell him his fault
[4:35] between thee and him alone if he shall
[4:37] hear thee thou Hast gained thy brother
[4:39] but if he will not hear thee then take
[4:41] with thee one or two more that in the
[4:43] mouth of two or three Witnesses every
[4:45] word may be established let's read verse
[4:47] 17 on three 1 2 3 and if he shall
[4:51] neglect to hear them tell it unto the
[4:54] church but if he neglect to hear the
[4:56] church let him be unto thee as Heathen
[5:00] man and a Publican may God add his
[5:02] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[5:04] may be seated I'm going to read Verse 18
[5:06] verily I say you look how much God backs
[5:09] this up if it's done the right way truly
[5:12] I say unto you whatsoever you bind on
[5:14] Earth shall be bound in
[5:17] heaven so whatever we decide in relation
[5:19] to people transgressing against us if
[5:22] we're in the right heaven will honor
[5:24] what we say of course it have to because
[5:26] we're led by the spirit of the Holy
[5:28] Ghost we're led by God
[5:30] spirit and whatsoever you loose on Earth
[5:34] shall be loosed in heaven Hallelujah
[5:36] verse 19 again I say unto you that if
[5:39] two of you shall agree on Earth as
[5:41] touching anything that they shall ask it
[5:43] shall be done for them of My Father
[5:46] which is in heaven
[5:48] Hallelujah just bear with me here uh
[5:50] while you're waiting let's go back to uh
[5:53] um Proverbs 6:16 let's go back there
[5:56] while I'm getting a drink here
[6:04] so this was our brother's text
[6:07] here um and I keep bringing that up that
[6:09] would have been August
[6:11] 10th because it was incredibly
[6:13] Supernatural and again if you haven't
[6:15] listened to that I would encourage you
[6:16] please do it if not you're probably
[6:18] going to miss what's going on by God's
[6:20] grace and that's everyone's individual
[6:23] Choice everyone has that choice whether
[6:25] to do that or not Proverbs 6:16 uh these
[6:29] things the Lord hate so a lying tongue
[6:32] so uh now let's look at that scripture
[6:35] in relation to Matthew 18 if someone
[6:37] goes to someone and they fail to repent
[6:40] then that person is keeping a lie
[6:42] they're accepting a lie right they're
[6:44] accepting the the lie that well I'm
[6:46] innocent I didn't do anything right and
[6:49] the Lord hates lies Hallelujah now let's
[6:52] just not leave it on other people if we
[6:53] lie let's remember God hates our lies
[6:55] too I'm not trying to just put it on all
[6:57] on one or two people or three people
[6:59] whatever may be four five six whatever
[7:01] I'm talking about this is just us
[7:04] recognizing uh with situations where
[7:06] there's transgressions against others
[7:08] someone's telling the truth and
[7:10] someone's lying or both people are lying
[7:13] but God has given us the spirit of Truth
[7:15] to discern what is truth remember the
[7:18] remember Jesus said the world does not
[7:20] receive the spirit of Truth so we can't
[7:23] expect people if they don't have the
[7:24] Holy Ghost we can't expect them to
[7:26] accept the truth right now we know
[7:29] people can you get complexes you can be
[7:30] bornn again you can get complexes like
[7:32] Peter different ones we know in the
[7:34] scripture could have complexes uh and
[7:36] maybe miss a certain truth but if I
[7:38] believe if each person individually will
[7:40] pray and seek God they'll find the
[7:42] spirit of Truth in every situation and
[7:45] especially in local church matters
[7:47] because we all live together we all
[7:49] worship together hallelujah we're all
[7:51] around each other we should be able to
[7:52] detect the spirit of Truth versus the
[7:54] spirit of
[7:56] err okay and then the the last verse
[8:00] verse 19 he that s a Discord among the
[8:04] Brethren okay so Discord is any course
[8:06] any
[8:07] division so if someone would would uh
[8:10] would go to someone and speak evil
[8:12] against someone else unjustly right and
[8:15] with a a gossiping Spirit that's sowing
[8:18] Discord and God hates that so let's
[8:20] remember that by God's grace here's
[8:22] another verse brother Dennis used uh
[8:24] let's since we're here Pro let's go to
[8:26] Proverbs 13:10 now this I'm sorry this
[8:28] one wasn't he used this was just from
[8:29] our own studies um brother Nathaniel SAS
[8:32] preached this really good sermon at my
[8:34] house a couple years ago when the pipes
[8:36] froze here really good verse verse 10
[8:40] only by Pride cometh contention so in
[8:43] other words if there's contention is
[8:45] caused by pride and uh contention is
[8:49] also Discord which means it all comes
[8:51] from the spirit of Pride that means God
[8:53] hates Pride brother mam said pride is an
[8:56] awful Spirit to have so let's be remain
[8:59] humbled by the grace of God that means
[9:01] we can be corrected we can recognize the
[9:03] truth we can speak the truth to people
[9:05] even though it may be hard we can tell
[9:06] them the
[9:07] truth okay so the only way there'll be
[9:10] trouble in a church and that's why I I'm
[9:13] thankful these young men are here you
[9:14] know they're going to grow up and
[9:15] they're the Next Generation our young
[9:17] sisters here you're the Next Generation
[9:19] uh that's why I told my family as we
[9:20] talked about this situation at home I
[9:22] said this is for your learning this is
[9:24] my fifth time going through this as far
[9:26] as being accused and people leaving the
[9:28] church that's totally fine people are
[9:29] entitled to their own opinion but
[9:31] somebody's right and somebody's wrong
[9:33] somebody's got the Holy Ghost and
[9:34] somebody's got an evil spirit as well by
[9:37] God's grace it's just the facts and how
[9:39] do you know like we saw last week you
[9:40] take everything back to the word
[9:43] everything has to go back to the that's
[9:45] brother man said that's the only way to
[9:46] know right and we can do that by God's
[9:48] grace and Jesus said you do it one at
[9:50] one oneon-one and then a group against
[9:51] one and then the whole church against
[9:53] one right that's how Jesus said to do it
[9:56] so we follow what Jesus said Hallelujah
[9:58] now here's the one brother Dennis did
[9:59] use Proverbs
[10:05] 26:20 Proverbs
[10:07] 26:20 where no wood is the fire goeth
[10:12] out so there is no ter Bearer The Strife
[10:16] seeus seeus sorry got the hard
[10:21] pronunciation at the end so gossiping or
[10:23] ta tail bearing or sowing Discord among
[10:26] Brethren is liken un wood and The Strife
[10:28] is the fire that comes from it right so
[10:33] uh I was looking back at my notes so
[10:34] from 20 about 2019 to 2024 we had no
[10:37] Strife in the church I'm thankful that
[10:39] was a good fiveyear run there by God's
[10:41] grace I'll take one year of Peace by
[10:43] God's grace but let alone five that's
[10:45] God's mercy on us hallelujah I believe
[10:47] that think all the dancing we had the
[10:49] joy the worship the the healings the the
[10:52] testimonies by God's grace what a season
[10:54] of Victory praise God but then we got to
[10:57] come around brother said Satan won't let
[10:58] you stay that in other words Satan will
[11:00] keep going up and accusing us and God
[11:02] will finally say okay you can do what
[11:03] you want just don't touch their
[11:05] lives Hallelujah he said oh Aran or
[11:09] bride of Christ they're just serving you
[11:10] because you give them five years a peace
[11:12] well we found out now we're serving
[11:13] because we love Jesus whether Good Times
[11:16] Hard Times Discord whatever may be we're
[11:19] serving Jesus because we love the word
[11:21] hallelujah that's
[11:23] right so uh we can see it here it's a
[11:27] spirit it's a spirit of PR
[11:30] and it tail bearss uh it
[11:33] uh it attacks right it it criticizes it
[11:36] tears down someone's reputation brother
[11:39] Ram said uh he said you don't have to
[11:41] shoot somebody to kill them you can just
[11:42] ruin their
[11:43] reputation by speaking bad about
[11:46] them right that's the reality of of what
[11:49] Jesus Jesus said in uh Matthew Chapter 5
[11:52] remember Jesus said you know uh uh he he
[11:54] said uh Thou shalt not murder but then
[11:56] he says be careful he said because you
[11:58] can Mur in other words he said be
[11:59] careful you can murder with your
[12:01] words right if you call somebody a fool
[12:03] without reason he said you might be in
[12:05] danger of
[12:07] Hellfire
[12:10] right so we're thankful for God's word
[12:13] hallelujah now I thought Also let's go
[12:15] to numberers 16 because this is this was
[12:17] brother Dennis's uh main teaching from
[12:21] the Bible on the Sunday service the
[12:23] spirit of resentment this is of course
[12:25] Kora Dayan and the group so brother uh
[12:28] Dennis is sermon said the situation he
[12:31] said it's
[12:33] preventable so in August when it was
[12:35] preached to us it was preventable which
[12:37] means we didn't have to go through these
[12:39] last six months the way we've gone they
[12:40] could have been prevented by the word of
[12:43] God and this was the story brother
[12:46] Dennis used to show it was cor and Dayan
[12:49] rising up saying we want more power we
[12:52] want more
[12:53] Authority but we saw on Wednesday the
[12:55] Elder the bishop uh the overseer the
[12:58] pastor he has full
[13:01] Authority right and then whatever he'
[13:03] give out that's he gives out but it's
[13:04] based upon the bylaws the full Authority
[13:06] is in the bishop we saw that on
[13:09] Wednesday night that's brother R said
[13:10] look in the Bible and see if that isn't
[13:13] right I'm glad we looked in the Bible
[13:15] Hallelujah to see it right my wife also
[13:17] found a good verse uh keep your spot
[13:19] there but I think it was Titus
[13:20] 2 uh said uh said that let me
[13:26] uh says rebuke with all authority so let
[13:29] me pull that up here Cas you yeah Titus
[13:31] 21:15 thank
[13:36] you okay Paul's talking to Titus Titus
[13:39] was also uh from history remember he was
[13:41] a missionary he was a pastor Mission
[13:44] another word for missionaries Apostle
[13:46] and Paul told Titus you now ordain
[13:48] Elders in every city so he was a
[13:50] preacher he was an apostle and also a
[13:52] pastor what does he say these things
[13:54] speak and exhort and rebuke rebuke
[13:56] people with all the authority if they're
[13:58] sin
[14:00] Hallelujah he didn't say some Authority
[14:03] the pastor has all the
[14:05] authority let no man despise thee so if
[14:08] you're going to despise me uh if
[14:09] someone's going to despise a pastor me
[14:11] anyone they need to leave the church
[14:13] right don't let don't let someone
[14:15] despise you in the house of
[14:17] God and if you remember this it's just
[14:19] coming to my mind now brother Dennis
[14:21] showed how the spirit of resentment will
[14:23] act in a service he used the the story
[14:25] of brother
[14:27] wey right and brother wey was leaning
[14:29] over and and to his wife Whispering I
[14:31] resent what he said and brother Bram
[14:33] said God struck him dead right there in
[14:35] the service now I'm not brother brandham
[14:37] but I have had people these last six
[14:39] months I have had people whisper to
[14:41] themselves uh obviously not agreeing
[14:43] with me and I I explained it on Sunday
[14:46] by God's grace all the Motions of
[14:48] disrespect so the Bible says we're to
[14:50] rebuke with all authority and let no man
[14:53] despise a true servant of God whether
[14:56] it's brother Jim Shoemake brother Brooks
[14:58] brother Craig Bo whoever brother brother
[15:00] cam brother Simon you do not let people
[15:02] despise a true servant of
[15:04] God you give them double
[15:07] honor right that's the word of God so uh
[15:10] just say just so everybody can see it
[15:12] there the only full Authority is the
[15:15] local Elder the pastor he's also called
[15:17] the bishop Hallelujah in the scripture
[15:21] Hallelujah all right now back to number
[15:25] 16 I just want to pull a few things out
[15:27] of here I read this last Sunday night
[15:29] after everything uh that we had to say
[15:31] on a Sunday night and highlighted some
[15:35] highlights okay now these men are named
[15:39] in verse one in verse two they raised up
[15:41] before Moses and they were famous in the
[15:44] congregations these were not little
[15:45] known congregation members these were
[15:47] well-known congregation members people
[15:49] would
[15:51] know men of renown and what they do in
[15:54] verse three they gather themselves
[15:56] together against Moses and against Aaron
[15:58] and S to you take too much upon you so
[16:01] they were upset saying you have too much
[16:04] Authority we just read the pastor has
[16:06] all the
[16:07] authority but people started complaining
[16:10] in the church we don't have enough
[16:14] Authority and it was just so it wasn't
[16:17] one it wasn't one person they went
[16:19] around telling others about that sowing
[16:22] Discord against Moses and
[16:26] Aaron and this was preached to us the
[16:29] spirit of resentment as a warning to us
[16:32] and it was acknowledged by everyone
[16:34] involved that this was true that this
[16:37] was actually happening in people's lives
[16:40] it was acknowledged and they said fully
[16:42] it was their sin and they were fully
[16:45] responsible that's right so it was
[16:48] recognized by all he said you take too
[16:50] much upon you seeing the congregation
[16:51] Are Holy every one of them and the Lord
[16:53] is among them wherefore then lift ye up
[16:55] yourselves above the congregation of the
[16:57] Lord so so the the the uh they're
[16:59] accusing Moses of Aaron oh you're
[17:00] lifting yourself up and so what does
[17:02] Moses do what's the first thing he do
[17:04] verse four and when Moses heard it he
[17:06] fell on his
[17:09] face last Sunday after service who fell
[17:11] on their face interceding ask Austin if
[17:14] you don't know ask Austin who is weeping
[17:18] and crying and interceding for Mercy
[17:20] praying and interceding to God
[17:22] hallelujah God knows God fights our
[17:26] battles Hallelujah
[17:29] verse 5 and he spake unto Kora and unto
[17:31] the company saying even tomorrow the
[17:33] Lord will show now I'm going to skip
[17:34] down to verse 9 Moses says to verse N9
[17:37] he says the core and his group Seth it
[17:39] but a small thing unto you that the god
[17:41] of Israel has separated you from the
[17:42] congregation of Israel to bring you near
[17:44] to himself to do the service of the
[17:46] Tabernacle of Lord and to stand before
[17:47] the congregation to minister to them in
[17:50] other words do you feel like the the
[17:52] role you've had was too small shouldn't
[17:55] you be blessed that you had the role and
[17:57] Authority that you were given by God
[17:59] rather than complain that you need
[18:03] more don't in other words don't you know
[18:05] that God says if you have a gift it'll
[18:07] make room for itself Hallelujah you
[18:09] don't got to ask for more Authority the
[18:12] Holy Ghost will open up more authority
[18:14] to you Hallelujah that's what Jesus said
[18:16] if you're faithful with a little I'll
[18:17] make you ruler over
[18:21] much let's uh I'm going to read that
[18:23] verse here the gift makes room for I've
[18:26] mentioned it so many times I think I
[18:28] might have just as
[18:29] well um read
[18:32] it yeah Proverbs 18:16 a man's gift
[18:35] maketh room for him and bringeth him
[18:37] before great men so I don't make room
[18:40] for my gift I don't have to push my gift
[18:41] into anybody's church God if God wants
[18:43] me to be there God will open it up there
[18:46] since God wanted me here he sent me
[18:47] across the state to be away from my
[18:49] family just to be a part of your family
[18:51] all my other family lives there they all
[18:52] get to see each other on Christmas
[18:54] Easter everything I don't get to see
[18:56] them but I get to see you you're my
[18:58] family
[18:59] you're my new family
[19:02] Hallelujah that's
[19:04] right how many times do I try to open up
[19:06] my home to you why because you're my
[19:08] family I got a small home so can't fit
[19:11] everybody maybe at the same
[19:13] time but by God's grace you're welcome
[19:16] when we can do it by the grace of
[19:19] God so look at that a gift will make
[19:21] room you don't have to make room for
[19:24] yourself you like cor and Dayan no one
[19:26] has to kind of uh argue or complain or
[19:29] or so Discord to get more Authority God
[19:31] will give it to
[19:33] you just be faithful with the what what
[19:35] you have right because didn't Jesus say
[19:38] we all either got five talents two
[19:39] talents or one Talent whatever your
[19:41] talent is uh it'll start multiplying and
[19:43] then people will see it and then doors
[19:45] will
[19:48] open in other words God will open doors
[19:51] for you amen like I told everybody that
[19:53] wanted to preach everyone that want to
[19:54] be a song leader I just told a brother
[19:57] who asked me about being a preacher
[19:58] recently
[19:59] I I must been one of those Brothers at
[20:01] the youth meeting but I sent him a
[20:03] message and I said the main thing to do
[20:04] is wait upon your ministry just
[20:07] wait and let God open up the door for
[20:11] you you'll never have to push your way
[20:13] into
[20:14] anything and yeah yeah that's right it's
[20:16] a brother from South Africa right now
[20:18] I'm remembering now and I said brother I
[20:20] said if you're really
[20:21] called you know and you approach the
[20:23] pastor and say you got a gift if he
[20:25] won't let you preach no problem if
[20:26] you're called to preach you'll go preach
[20:28] on the corner
[20:29] if or you'll make a YouTube Ministry or
[20:31] something or you you'll do something if
[20:33] you're called to preach you'll do it
[20:35] Hallelujah right because a real child of
[20:37] God will not bury their gift in the
[20:39] ground and say well I'm not doing
[20:40] nothing amen that's not a real child of
[20:42] God that's a child of God who get
[20:45] spanked right like like the the parable
[20:47] tells us Jesus says you Wicked and lazy
[20:50] servant why'd you bury your gift in the
[20:51] earth you should have least done
[20:53] something with it Hallelujah
[20:59] a gift makes room for itself
[21:04] Hallelujah now back to
[21:07] numbers is it a small thing that they
[21:09] had this uh they had this ministry if
[21:12] I'm not mistaken the sons of Kor they
[21:14] would just carry the instruments they
[21:16] would just pack it up and carry it they
[21:17] were just the Moving Team I'll say this
[21:20] they were the U-Haul
[21:22] team but they're like oh no I want to be
[21:24] a priest I want to take the censor I
[21:26] want to go in with the sensor to the
[21:27] presence of God
[21:29] God said no that's not your
[21:32] calling was it wasn't it good enough
[21:34] just to be around the house of God
[21:36] Church the Bible said to be a better to
[21:38] be in the house of God and just be a
[21:40] doorkeeper that'd be better to be a
[21:42] doorkeeper than be out with the tents of
[21:43] the
[21:45] wicked some some some people listen some
[21:48] people in the message or some people in
[21:49] Christianity their whole calling is just
[21:51] to open and close doors and they should
[21:53] be happy with it am you know why cuz I
[21:55] was happy with it when I was a deacon in
[21:57] line my Vang knows I have always help
[21:59] open the door my wife knows I love to
[22:00] open the door some of you I open the
[22:01] door for you this morning praise God
[22:03] because as a deacon I had to guard the
[22:04] door this morning because of
[22:06] circumstances that's my job I signed up
[22:09] for it I want to do it by God's grace am
[22:13] Hallelujah so we do what we do but the
[22:16] main thing is to wait on God find
[22:18] something to do that you know God has
[22:21] called me to do this and brother they
[22:22] asked brother how do I know I got the
[22:24] gift because you can do it amen
[22:27] hallelujah amen we were talking about
[22:29] you know our sister having a gift of
[22:31] discernment how do we know because we
[22:32] see it operating hallelujah how do you
[22:34] know brother Jesse can preach or teach
[22:36] or because you see it operating praise
[22:43] God so the main thing we want to do is
[22:45] use the talents that God has given to us
[22:48] and then it'll make room for us we'll
[22:51] have a place oh that's the brother that
[22:53] plays piano they're in
[22:56] akan right that's the sister that that
[22:59] that prays and fasts they in
[23:02] akine that's a sister who brings her her
[23:04] children Faithfully to church in
[23:08] akan that's that's the brother who
[23:10] brings his all of his younger siblings
[23:11] to
[23:12] church Hallelujah by the grace every
[23:15] Sunday Hallelujah and each one of you I
[23:17] can preach on you in a good
[23:19] way
[23:21] right you just you you find your gift
[23:23] you find your calling give yourself to
[23:25] it fully and then God will open the
[23:27] doors where he wants to take you
[23:30] I've heard Donnie Reagan and different
[23:31] one Tim pu and and they just started off
[23:33] as small churches and God just kept
[23:35] multiplying them till they had to build
[23:37] and praise God God bless them that that
[23:39] proves that's their calling in life they
[23:42] had such growth and explosion meet
[23:44] people moving in from around the world
[23:47] to be a part of that church and so and
[23:49] they didn't ask for it they never asked
[23:50] anybody to do it well if that's true
[23:53] well then then then God's a god of
[23:55] variety well there's going to be some
[23:56] churches that don't get that explosion
[23:58] they just slowly grow or stay about the
[24:00] same well listen church we started with
[24:01] seven people right brother van three of
[24:03] them are here today and look look how
[24:05] many adults we got now by God's grace
[24:07] it's a great it's a great explosion to
[24:10] me because I know I have enough
[24:12] understanding by God's grace he let us
[24:14] know if he wants us to be big we'll be
[24:16] big if he wants us to be small or medium
[24:18] we'll be small or medium it's God's Gift
[24:20] God is the one in charge of the gifts
[24:22] God will give the increase
[24:24] Hallelujah all we must do is water the
[24:27] seed plant the seed
[24:28] God gives the increase
[24:32] Hallelujah verse 10 number
[24:35] 161 and he hath brought thee near to him
[24:38] and all thy Brethren the sons of Levi
[24:40] seek ye the priesthood also so he's
[24:42] trying to reason with him why would you
[24:44] demand more Authority God's already
[24:47] brought you close you have a much closer
[24:49] Ministry than other
[24:51] people why you trying to invade into uh
[24:55] getting more Authority or have your own
[24:57] way when God has
[24:58] allow or God didn't ordain you to have
[25:00] your own way like that in other words
[25:02] wasn't it good enough with what God had
[25:04] given
[25:06] you that's the
[25:10] word now what's interesting in verse 12
[25:13] Moses called them to come up and they
[25:14] would they refuse to meet up they refus
[25:17] to come up and this was preached To Us
[25:20] by brother Dennis
[25:25] right now and look they accus accus
[25:28] Moses in verse 13 oh you just brought us
[25:30] in the wilderness to kill us they're
[25:32] accusing him that's not what he did but
[25:34] see in their minds their Discord they
[25:36] they worked it out well he's got bad
[25:37] motives and objectives for
[25:39] me right they they'd all like Brother D
[25:43] they just created this
[25:45] complex and Moses didn't do
[25:48] that and oh then they say oh well you're
[25:50] making yourself to be a prince Over Us
[25:52] in verse 13 you're exalting yourself
[25:54] when Moses said I didn't I didn't ask to
[25:56] come down to Egypt God sent me down to
[25:57] Egypt
[26:01] Hallelujah so that made uh look verse 14
[26:04] moreover thou has not brought us into
[26:06] land in other words we haven't received
[26:07] all the promises you're preaching well
[26:09] that's because your Disobedience and
[26:10] your Discord and also because you got to
[26:12] wait on God to receive some
[26:14] promises some of them you got to wait a
[26:17] while right Moses didn't say well thus
[26:20] sayith the Lord in this many days this
[26:21] many months you'll be in the promis land
[26:23] no it was just a promise to get there
[26:25] someday but see because of the
[26:27] circumstances and were not there yet
[26:29] they just found anything to nitpick on
[26:31] the servant of the
[26:33] Lord right Moses very angry verse
[26:37] 15 and again you know God I'm going to
[26:40] skip down God tells him to separate
[26:41] himself verse 20 the Lord spake unto
[26:43] Moses and Aaron saying separate
[26:44] yourselves from among this congregation
[26:46] that I may consume them in a moment and
[26:47] they fell on their faces notice twice
[26:49] twice the Servants of God fall on their
[26:51] faces to pray for the guilty
[26:54] ones okay and said oh God the god of the
[26:57] spirits of All Flesh shall one man sin
[26:59] and thou and wilt thou be wroth with all
[27:01] the
[27:03] congregation okay now verse 22 again uh
[27:05] I'm sorry verse 26 now I want you to see
[27:08] this here now for our situation I'm not
[27:10] calling anyone who used to come to our
[27:11] church Wicked that's between them and
[27:13] God but I'm showing a spirit that would
[27:16] divide a spirit of Discord is hateful in
[27:18] the sight of
[27:19] God that should be clear we just read it
[27:22] in Proverbs 6 and Proverbs
[27:24] 26 and he spake unto the congregation
[27:26] saying depart I pray you from the tents
[27:28] of these wicked men that were giving the
[27:30] false accusations against Moses wanting
[27:32] more Authority and God hadn't ordained
[27:35] it and touch nothing of theirs lest you
[27:38] be consumed in all their
[27:40] sins so I'm just letting you see a
[27:43] spirit that won't repent uh Jesus said
[27:46] if they won't repent you got to make
[27:47] them like a heathen of Republic I'm
[27:49] sorry not a republican well it could be
[27:51] a republican we got a lot of naughty
[27:53] Republicans a lot of naughty Democrats
[27:55] too brother Bram said there's six of one
[27:57] half a dozen of
[28:00] another that's right did you see this
[28:02] week president Trump put Paula white as
[28:05] his leader of uh a new department for
[28:09] religious liberty that was an awful
[28:11] shame that was a huge mistake so again
[28:14] like brother William and I were emailing
[28:16] last week this Beast out of the land has
[28:18] got two horns civil well now who's in
[28:21] charge of the Civil Republican
[28:25] ecclesiastical the Civil put Paula White
[28:27] a woman preacher who's been married
[28:29] three or four
[28:31] times the the the Civil put this woman
[28:34] preacher in uh in charge of uh freedom
[28:38] of religion and trying to spread
[28:40] religion and she's got a lot more awful
[28:42] things than that but if you ever
[28:44] listened to her you would know
[28:46] Prosperity preacher deceiver false
[28:51] prophet so just so you know uh we got to
[28:55] rightly divide the truth on everything
[28:57] by God's grace politics ICS everything
[28:59] local church everything we must rightly
[29:01] divide the word of
[29:04] God now verse 28 and Moses said hereby
[29:07] you shall know that the Lord has sent me
[29:08] to do these works for I've not done them
[29:10] according to my own mind and just again
[29:12] the point here Moses didn't call himself
[29:14] to go down to Egypt God called him down
[29:17] there any real preacher Pastor anybody
[29:20] they're not doing these things because
[29:21] they want to do them they're doing what
[29:23] they're doing because God's word says
[29:25] so right not of our own mind we're
[29:27] trying to keep the word of God now after
[29:29] the judgment is poured out on Cor and
[29:31] Dayan look at verse 41 but on the
[29:33] tomorrow all the congregation of
[29:34] children
[29:35] murmured so look it was not only was it
[29:38] on these famous men but then it was also
[29:41] on the entire congregation the Judgment
[29:42] didn't even cause them to repent so
[29:45] again Moses has left just with a
[29:47] critical church now thank God we don't
[29:49] have that by God's
[29:51] grace but look Moses Church no wonder
[29:54] sometimes he was
[29:55] provoked no wonder he had all these
[29:58] problems he's like how do I deal with
[29:59] this and then his father-in-law is like
[30:01] well get 70 elders let God will put your
[30:03] spirit on them that helped out then he's
[30:04] got still all these complaining problems
[30:06] people accusing him of of trying to
[30:08] force himself upon everybody and force
[30:11] all the authority and his but he's like
[30:12] I didn't do this to myself God called me
[30:15] here
[30:18] hallelujah okay
[30:20] now okay and then God sent a plague
[30:23] because of all the murmuring now verse
[30:24] 49 now they that died in the plague were
[30:26] 14,7
[30:28] 100 died because of all the complaining
[30:30] against Moses and Aaron okay so that's
[30:34] uh clear so the question is who's going
[30:36] to fall on their faces which side in our
[30:38] church or any other Church which side
[30:40] falls on their faces in intercession for
[30:42] those who won't repent that's the
[30:45] question that you need to answer and I
[30:47] need to answer praise
[30:49] God that's
[30:51] right now I want to say this too uh 1
[30:54] Timothy 5:24 and 25 hun
[30:58] you know this is a harsh story course uh
[31:00] cor and Dayan and uh we would never wish
[31:04] any harm on anyone nor do we want any
[31:07] harm on anyone
[31:10] um and I I brought this thought out I
[31:12] even shared it with my daughter uh let's
[31:15] see it was something unrelated to what's
[31:17] going on in the church if I'm not
[31:18] mistaken no it was related okay yes
[31:20] that's right it was related
[31:22] okay um so if in the case of Matthew 18
[31:26] uh if we have to keep someone out of the
[31:28] church or they have chosen uh to allow
[31:32] themselves to be terminated from the
[31:34] assembly that's what our bylaws say you
[31:36] terminate yourself from the assembly if
[31:39] you won't repent after the church goes
[31:40] to
[31:41] you
[31:43] right now after that there God May pour
[31:46] out a judgment or God may not because of
[31:48] this and brother BR gives us an example
[31:50] we'll go through that too in just a
[31:51] moment some men's sins are open
[31:53] beforehand going before to judgment so
[31:56] we see all their sins
[31:58] right beforehand going to judgment and
[32:00] some men they follow
[32:02] after okay so it's not until after
[32:04] they're judged we see their sin likewise
[32:07] also the good works of some are manifest
[32:09] beforehand sometimes we see people's
[32:11] good works while they're alive other
[32:12] people we don't some people won't see
[32:15] their good works until we get to the
[32:16] other
[32:17] side right now the example is
[32:23] um the Rich Young
[32:25] Ruler so let's um
[32:28] let's read that Luke
[32:30] 12 yes Luke
[32:32] 12 Luke
[32:34] 12:18 brother abam uses this I think
[32:36] it's in is your life worthy the gospel
[32:38] 63 I could be wrong on that but I think
[32:40] that's what it was and this shows
[32:44] here
[32:46] um well this is the uh this is the end
[32:48] of the man yeah this is the end of
[32:51] man okay I'm going to go up to verse 16
[32:53] Luke 12:16 and he spake a parable unto
[32:55] them saying the ground of a certain rich
[32:57] man brought forth plentifully and he
[32:59] thought within himself saying what shall
[33:00] I do because I have no room to bestow my
[33:02] fruits and he said this will I do I will
[33:04] pull down my Barns and build greater and
[33:06] there will I bestow all my fruits and my
[33:08] goods now say to my soul soul thou Hast
[33:10] much Goods laid up for many years take
[33:12] thine ease eat drink and be Mary but God
[33:15] said said unto him thou fool this night
[33:17] thou thy Soul shall be required of thee
[33:19] then whose shall those things be which
[33:23] thou Hast provided so is he that layeth
[33:25] up treasure for himself and is not rich
[33:28] toward God so brother R says this is the
[33:31] Rich Young Ruler that left
[33:34] Jesus okay so let's go look up that one
[33:37] uh he looked upon him and loved
[33:48] him I didn't have these ready to go
[33:58] just a moment here I'm just looking for
[34:00] the the verse here thank you for your
[34:12] patience yeah Mark 10 thank you Mark
[34:19] 10:21 so uh we know the Rich Young Ruler
[34:22] comes he comes running to him in verse
[34:23] 17 kneels down what may I do that I may
[34:25] inherit eternal life Jesus says
[34:29] says uh he quotes the Commandments and
[34:31] then he and then in Mark 10:20 says I've
[34:34] observed all these from my youth talk
[34:36] about A good rule follower now notice he
[34:38] had a had a good heart to follow the
[34:40] rules but he still had sin in his heart
[34:42] it was the Love of Money verse 10 then
[34:45] Jesus beholding him loved him and said
[34:48] to him one thing thou lackest go thy way
[34:50] sell whatsoever thou Hast and give to
[34:53] the poor and thou shalt have treasure in
[34:55] heaven and come and take up thy cross
[34:57] and follow me now there's a good thought
[35:00] in here Jesus loves him but yet Jesus's
[35:03] own love for him isn't enough to help
[35:06] him repent and follow Jesus in other
[35:09] words God so loved the world God has
[35:11] love on all these Sinners thank God God
[35:13] has love on us but each one must
[35:14] surrender to the love of God
[35:17] hallelujah it's not just enough that
[35:19] Jesus loves me yes Jesus loves me yes I
[35:20] know for the Bible tells me so but the
[35:22] question is do you love Jesus
[35:25] Hallelujah that's the question we know
[35:28] God loves
[35:30] us look at what's verse 22 say and he
[35:33] went I'm sorry and he was sad at the
[35:35] saying and went away grieved for he had
[35:37] his great possessions so brother R gives
[35:39] us three steps this is the first step he
[35:41] walks away Jesus said follow me he turns
[35:43] his head and said I really like my money
[35:46] I really want to have my way even though
[35:48] Jesus Loves Me I want to have my way he
[35:49] walks away from the five-fold ministry
[35:51] right just making it for our day he
[35:54] walks away from the calling of God and
[35:56] then we see at the end of his life he
[35:58] gets so blessed and brother B said Satan
[36:00] will bless you even if even if you turn
[36:02] away from God Satan knows how to bless
[36:03] you brother B said he had barns he had
[36:06] his his plans to build all these barns
[36:08] he was so fruitful he was so uh so
[36:11] blessed that he had so much food and
[36:12] materials he had to he was planning to
[36:14] build all these barns brother said that
[36:16] was the same man who left Jesus behind
[36:20] so we can't say just because somebody
[36:21] disobeys and walks away from Christ or
[36:23] walks away from the word that doesn't
[36:25] mean they're going to be punished
[36:26] necessarily because some men's sins go
[36:28] before them some men's sins fou behind
[36:31] them and you know Luke 16 Luke 16 is
[36:34] where we get the end of this
[36:38] story Luke 16 but manam says this is the
[36:41] rich man in hell he lifted up his eyes
[36:44] and I'm not calling I'm not judging the
[36:47] destination of any person I'm just
[36:50] showing you that the Bible says someone
[36:52] can disobey the Lord Jesus Christ the
[36:54] truth of God's word walk away and
[36:56] they'll still be blessed afterward we
[36:57] don't know what God's going to do that's
[37:00] why we should fall in our faces amen and
[37:01] pray Hallelujah Glory we don't know what
[37:05] God and we should plead for
[37:09] Mercy Luke
[37:12] 16 Verse 22 and it came to pass that the
[37:15] beggar died and was carried by the
[37:16] Angels in Abraham's bosom the rich man
[37:18] also died I didn't set a timer when did
[37:19] I start about I'll do 30 more
[37:24] minutes it was uh carried by the Angels
[37:27] into Abraham's bosom the rich man also
[37:30] died and was buried and in hell he
[37:33] lifted up his eyes being in torments and
[37:34] seeing Abraham a far off and Lazarus in
[37:37] his
[37:38] bosom and he cried and said Father
[37:40] Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazar
[37:42] that he may dip the tip of his finger
[37:44] and water and cool my tongue for I'm
[37:46] tormented in this flame so uh hell is a
[37:48] place of Torment it's a prison
[37:51] house and but Abraham said Son remember
[37:53] that thou in thy lifetime receivest thyy
[37:55] good things and likewise Lazareth evil
[37:57] things but now he's comforted and thou
[38:00] art
[38:01] tormented and beside all this between us
[38:04] and you there's a great golf fixed so
[38:06] that they which would pass from then to
[38:08] you cannot neither can they pass to us
[38:10] that would come from then then he said I
[38:12] pray thee therefore father that thou
[38:14] wouldest send him to my father's house
[38:16] for I have five Brethren so now he's
[38:18] interested in
[38:20] evangelizing that's the wrong time to be
[38:22] interested in evangelizing while you're
[38:24] alive that's the time to try to get your
[38:26] family saved
[38:28] amen right I'm going to tell this for
[38:30] Chris Chris a couple years ago um when
[38:32] Victoria was
[38:34] born we were still in that we were still
[38:36] having service in that big room down
[38:38] there I just felt this burden I've got
[38:41] to tell my family about brother Brandon
[38:44] right some of you might remember I
[38:45] printed out this letter I gave an update
[38:47] on everybody in the family Malachi likes
[38:49] dinosaurs and Lydia likes Lon witch in
[38:51] the wardrobe whatever likes
[38:53] reading talked about and in each and and
[38:57] so I only sent it to my mother's side
[38:59] because I'm only close with them I sent
[39:00] it to all my aunts and uncles on my
[39:01] mother's side inside they had and inside
[39:04] the book I put I'm sorry inside the
[39:05] letter I put the letter I put a church
[39:08] age book and a book by brother brandham
[39:11] and links to my website uh my my YouTube
[39:14] Ministry we had a snow day or something
[39:16] like that I just took a whole day a
[39:18] Friday and I just packed all those up
[39:20] sealed them up listen to brother Brandon
[39:21] while I'm you know okay mailed them all
[39:24] out I didn't hear back from one of them
[39:27] but I know they opened them right
[39:30] because I had tracking on them and the
[39:32] ones that didn't they came back to me
[39:34] there's a couple that came back to me
[39:36] and I've even oh yeah I know uh yes
[39:38] that's right my aunt one of my aunts who
[39:40] now lives in Florida she was very
[39:41] thankful she said thank you and thank
[39:43] you for the book and I don't think she
[39:44] read it but she she expressed gratitude
[39:46] and God will remember
[39:49] that see Now's the Time to do family
[39:52] evangelism why you got and so now I have
[39:54] a now the burd's been off my heart
[39:56] brother the burd's off my heart I gave
[39:57] them a chance they could go to my
[39:59] YouTube they go to our home Church
[40:01] website if they have any questions
[40:03] there's my cell phone number there's a
[40:05] book I mean it's it's the word of God
[40:07] it's the message of the hour delivered
[40:09] to your front door hallelujah amen
[40:12] that's a great use of money in my
[40:15] opinion because you know what I may
[40:17] never ever see them
[40:19] again and I know this they'll probably
[40:21] never step a foot inside that door but
[40:23] now there's no
[40:25] excuses and I think yes I think I did
[40:28] that right after preaching on Luke 16 in
[40:29] Hell CU I remember I was so fired up at
[40:31] the next day uh brother Patrick I was
[40:33] like at the gas station and the guy
[40:35] cross me I'm like uhh do you know Jesus
[40:37] I don't want you to go to hell he's like
[40:38] I know Jesus I'm like okay praise God I
[40:40] was all fired up because I didn't want I
[40:43] didn't want to see people lost now I
[40:44] want to get that back by God's grace as
[40:46] the Lord
[40:48] leads so now now see see the three steps
[40:52] turning away from Jesus not doing his
[40:54] will yet you're still blessed in the
[40:56] Second Step but then third step lost and
[40:58] go to
[41:00] hell see that so people that disobey the
[41:03] word or uh reject the calling of God
[41:06] we'd say the five-fold ministry that
[41:08] doesn't always mean they're going to be
[41:09] punished they might be
[41:11] blessed all you's going to do is wait
[41:13] all you can do is pray for mercy on
[41:15] people pray for God's grace on people
[41:17] brother raham said if you want anyone to
[41:19] go to hell he said you're probably not
[41:20] saved he said you need to come down to
[41:22] this Altar and make it right with
[41:24] God right Moses didn't want to see that
[41:26] happen to Cor Dayan so what'd he do he
[41:28] fell on his face twice God was going to
[41:30] destroy all of them all two million of
[41:32] them first he just want to destroy the
[41:34] the the small families there but then
[41:36] he's like I'm going to destroy all of
[41:37] them Moses said have mercy I'm throwing
[41:40] myself in the Gap like Jesus threw
[41:42] himself in the
[41:43] Gap that's right that's what you and I
[41:46] are called to
[41:49] do
[41:51] Hallelujah everybody can see that so you
[41:53] want you want to be real careful we want
[41:54] to be I want to watch my words you want
[41:56] to watch your words uh just because
[41:57] someone's disobedient doesn't mean
[41:58] they're going to get punished right away
[42:00] we we don't
[42:01] know bless
[42:03] you we just don't know we got to be
[42:07] cautious by the grace of
[42:12] God okay let me
[42:18] look I'm kind of uh trying to decide
[42:21] where to go here yeah let's go to
[42:23] Ephesians
[42:25] 4:26 again here uh dealing with
[42:28] the uh we'd say anger or
[42:31] resentment Ephesians
[42:33] 4:26 because that's what ultimately
[42:35] resentment creates right creates anger
[42:38] division let's see how that's supposed
[42:40] to be
[42:47] handled verse 26 be angry and sin not
[42:52] let not the sun go down upon your wrath
[42:54] so if anybody's angry with anybody
[42:56] before the day ends they're supposed to
[42:58] go to that person face to face and try
[42:59] to work it
[43:01] out right now I didn't see it but let's
[43:03] go to ver I didn't see it till now verse
[43:05] 25 let's go back up I I want to read
[43:07] that wherefore put away lying so put
[43:09] away the tail bearing
[43:11] Spirit
[43:13] right put away lying speak every man
[43:16] truth with his neighbor for we are
[43:17] members one of another like we said last
[43:20] week or Wednesday why would you neglect
[43:23] the infection on one arm if you're the
[43:25] other arm you wouldn't you would take
[43:26] care of of that arm you take care of the
[43:28] people in the church right you love them
[43:30] you speak good of
[43:36] them well I guess you know we might as
[43:38] well back go back up to 22 put off the O
[43:40] off concerning the former conversation
[43:42] the old man which is corrupt according
[43:44] to deceitful lust so see what was cor
[43:46] and Dayan they were lusting after more
[43:48] position more Authority everybody see
[43:50] that that that's plain we see the same
[43:52] thing in the New Testament deceitful
[43:53] love they were deceived in thinking well
[43:55] we get we should we should do the
[43:57] uh we should do the priest Ministry too
[44:00] they're deceived into wanting more more
[44:04] Authority right and be renewed so here's
[44:06] how you overcome that you need a new a
[44:08] brand new
[44:09] mind that's the only way to overcome
[44:12] this you got to repent remember that's
[44:13] that's three parts to repentance
[44:14] remember that young people there's three
[44:16] parts to repentance you got to change
[44:18] your mind right you got to hate your sin
[44:21] and you got to make amends for your sin
[44:23] look it up in the Greek sometimes look
[44:25] it up so see if somebody really wants a
[44:28] true a new mind that's what they'll do
[44:30] they won't think they won't allow a
[44:32] harboring of any evil thoughts against
[44:34] that brother or sister anymore they'll
[44:36] think different I think different I'm
[44:37] not going to think that I'm not going to
[44:39] meditate on
[44:40] lies I'm not going to meditate on my
[44:42] complex or what I want I'm going to
[44:44] meditate on what's true what's right
[44:46] what's holy what's good what's just
[44:48] what's lovely
[44:51] Hallelujah I hope you're enjoying this
[44:53] review by God's grace it's 2011 so 101
[44:57] one was the Freshman course this is the
[44:59] sophomore course here by God's grace
[45:01] going up the levels
[45:03] here and then you put on the new man
[45:05] verse 24 which after God is created in
[45:08] righteousness and true so true Holiness
[45:11] is having a pure
[45:12] mind right a pure mind A Renewed mind no
[45:16] not going after deceitful
[45:19] lust and then then now verse 26 be angry
[45:22] and sin not you're allowed to be angry
[45:24] but you need to go talk to that person
[45:26] before the day over over so you don't go
[45:27] to bed angry right probably not going to
[45:29] get a good night of sleep probably not
[45:31] if you don't repent then after that or
[45:33] get it right probably not going to have
[45:34] a good week of sleep
[45:36] right and of course that spirit is not
[45:38] going to stay the same it's going to
[45:39] grow if you don't cut it down that's
[45:42] that corrupt seed is going to be watered
[45:44] by your thoughts by things that happen
[45:46] and pretty soon it's going to grow you
[45:47] better cut it down the day you got
[45:51] it be angry sin not let not the sun go
[45:55] down upon your wrath 2 s now here it is
[45:57] neither give place to the devil so in
[46:00] other words don't give the devil place
[46:02] in your mind like for a complex remember
[46:04] a complex is a stronghold Paul calls it
[46:06] a stronghold it's a castle it's a
[46:08] fortress that Satan has set up in a
[46:10] Christian's mind to attack other
[46:13] Christians Satan has actually taken some
[46:15] of the ground on a believer's
[46:18] life right invaded and taken ground and
[46:21] that Christian is now attacking other
[46:23] Christians part of the body of Christ
[46:25] and you've got to tear it down
[46:27] we got to tear it down by the grace of
[46:29] God right and the Bible said it's it's
[46:31] not hard to do because we have weapons
[46:32] that are Mighty to God through the
[46:34] pulling down of strongholds hallelujah
[46:37] it's not hard for God to pull down all
[46:38] those bricks that the people have build
[46:40] up week after week month after month
[46:42] right it's not hard the power of God can
[46:44] pull it right down
[46:45] Hallelujah that's
[46:52] right
[46:53] okay yeah neither give place to the
[46:55] devil
[46:57] and that also applies to Matthew 18 I
[46:59] just thought that now you can't let the
[47:00] de we can't let the devil have a place
[47:02] in our church if a person won't
[47:04] repent right Paul said it's like leav
[47:07] you got to get the leaven out so you can
[47:08] become a new church a new lump you can
[47:11] get the joy back Hallelujah right the
[47:14] joy of our
[47:15] Salvation that's
[47:17] right verse 28 let him that stole steal
[47:21] no more but rather let him labor working
[47:23] with his hands a thing which is good
[47:25] that he may have to give to him that
[47:27] needeth so the whole point of you
[47:28] working is not necessarily for you it's
[47:30] to help other people too verse 29 let no
[47:33] corrupt communication here we go tail
[47:35] bearing resentment gossip let no corrupt
[47:38] communication proceed out of your mouth
[47:40] but that which is good to the use of
[47:42] edifying so build each other up make
[47:45] each other stronger with your words not
[47:47] tear people
[47:51] down that it may Minister Grace give
[47:54] people Grace with your words
[47:58] Hallelujah and this is to everyone in
[48:00] the church right me included all of us
[48:02] and the church said everyone in the
[48:04] church and grieve not the holy spirit of
[48:07] God whereby you're sealed unto the day
[48:10] of
[48:11] redemption let all bitterness wrath
[48:14] anger clamor there it is evil speaking
[48:18] be put away from you with all mouth and
[48:21] see if people won't put it away out of
[48:22] their lives we have to remove those
[48:24] people out if they won't put it out of
[48:26] their lives
[48:27] because it's only going to impact us in
[48:29] a negative
[48:30] way look at verse 32 and be ye kind to
[48:34] one another
[48:36] tenderhearted not hard-hearted
[48:41] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[48:44] as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven
[48:47] you Hallelujah God is so quick to
[48:50] forgive Hallelujah and so we want to be
[48:52] tender-hearted forgiving one another but
[48:54] in the cases where people trespass in
[48:56] the church we want to forgive them but
[48:58] they've got to seek forgiveness
[49:02] too right Jesus said they got to admit
[49:04] they're wrong they got to admit their
[49:05] trespasses they've got to ask for
[49:07] forgiveness too and if they won't then
[49:10] the Bible said put it out put them out
[49:13] right put them out all
[49:15] right got that that that
[49:24] okay let's go to 1 Timothy 5 5 1 Timothy
[49:27] 5 I'm going to end the live stream with
[49:30] this and then I'm going to go into some
[49:31] private things I just want to say here 1
[49:33] Timothy
[49:35] 5 and church I hope this is the last
[49:37] time by God's grace we've had you know
[49:40] we have to deal with subject subjects
[49:42] like this you know like I said last time
[49:44] was 2019 I think if my calendar and my
[49:47] notes are right 1 Timothy 5:19
[50:00] okay
[50:01] now verse
[50:04] 19 now this applies to all of our
[50:07] church
[50:09] right because there's one person in here
[50:11] that's being accused that's me I've said
[50:13] that plainly I've said it publicly
[50:15] and brother said if you want trouble or
[50:18] he said you want you want guns to pourn
[50:19] at you just say you got the Holy Ghost
[50:20] you're going to have
[50:22] trouble Satan points every gun at you as
[50:24] soon as you say you got the Holy Ghost
[50:25] so or you you you take any service on of
[50:28] God here comes the
[50:30] accusers you try to do anything right
[50:32] for God that's why brother man say
[50:34] sometimes don't say what you're going to
[50:34] do for God out loud Satan will hear it
[50:36] and start working against you in other
[50:39] words when the Bible said when you get
[50:40] the Holy Ghost you put on the armor of
[50:42] God you get into the
[50:44] battle so as soon as you start doing
[50:46] something for God it's battle time so I
[50:49] knew I knew becoming a pastor it'd be a
[50:51] battle I knew I saw brother Brook's
[50:52] battle I'm just glad my battles haven't
[50:54] been that hard by the grace of God or
[50:57] like I told you of the chur a church an
[50:58] hour and a half away where they got to
[51:00] call the cops and they got to get
[51:01] restraining orders in the message I'm
[51:03] not saying that to down I'm just saying
[51:05] that's how bad sometimes evil spirits
[51:06] manifest and we haven't had that thank
[51:10] God thank
[51:14] God now 1 Timothy 5:19 against an elder
[51:19] receive not an accusation but before two
[51:21] or three Witnesses so I just want to say
[51:23] anyone that thinks I might be guilty you
[51:25] really got to consider this verse
[51:28] you can't receive an accusation against
[51:30] an elder unless there's two public
[51:32] Witnesses or perhaps three and brother R
[51:35] said in that court I read on Wednesday
[51:37] they've got to swear to it swear to God
[51:39] and they got to have full proof of it
[51:42] right because just at the court if
[51:43] somebody took you to court you'd want
[51:45] them to actually have evidence before
[51:46] they accuse you right you don't want to
[51:48] be taken to court with no
[51:51] evidence so if someone if if anyone here
[51:54] has accepted an accusation against
[51:57] me you you've done it without the proper
[52:00] order the proper order is there's got to
[52:02] be two or three Witnesses for it
[52:04] publicly and prove
[52:06] it what am I what I'm saying is that if
[52:08] people have accepted against me they've
[52:10] broken the word because they're hasn't
[52:13] been two or three Witnesses against
[52:15] me and I was open to every meeting I put
[52:18] in the letter for the last three weeks
[52:19] I've been open to every meeting no one's
[52:21] reach out to me for a meeting I'm open
[52:23] right here I I'll take any witness I
[52:25] I'll take see see and what happens it
[52:27] just it doesn't come why because God
[52:29] knows there's a truth there Spirit of
[52:31] Truth and there's a spirit of error God
[52:33] backs up the
[52:35] truth hallelujah and this is all said
[52:37] with the love of God in my
[52:40] heart see because we got to follow the
[52:43] word of God we got to follow the rules
[52:45] that the Holy Ghost has given to us in
[52:46] the word of
[52:47] God all right now uh God bless the Liv
[52:50] streamers we love our people that
[52:52] support us thank you for your support by
[52:54] the grace of God I trust this message
[52:55] was a good help
