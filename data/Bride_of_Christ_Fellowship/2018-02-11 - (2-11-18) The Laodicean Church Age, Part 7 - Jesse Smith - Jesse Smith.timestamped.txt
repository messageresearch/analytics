[38:39] the Saints this morning praise the Lord
[38:48] so I yeah okay well ready to go thank
[38:51] you sir thank you so look at this
[38:55] message here today this part seven I was
[38:58] just going to update everybody on my
[38:59] book I finished the rough draft of the
[39:02] book so I have eight chapters and then
[39:05] 43,000 words
[39:07] twenty-seven references all lined up and
[39:10] really really excited about it so I sent
[39:12] I sent an email out to ministers last
[39:14] night and I was hoping that they could
[39:15] read
[39:16] each read one chapter for me and just
[39:18] give me their honest thoughts and
[39:19] feedback that's before I take it to a
[39:21] professional editor
[39:22] I imagine the professional editors not
[39:24] gonna like my book very much but I just
[39:27] want the grammar fixed I'm not gonna
[39:30] delete any of my content because it's
[39:32] the message of the hour but anyways I'm
[39:35] looking I told the minister brothers if
[39:37] you just read it one chapter this week
[39:39] and get back to me and maybe I can edit
[39:41] it for one more week and I'm gonna have
[39:43] my wife edit it she's really good at
[39:45] editing and things like that with
[39:48] grammar and she's you know really
[39:49] educated you know smart like that and
[39:51] then I'm gonna send it to a professional
[39:52] headed her so I imagine this will
[39:54] process will be over in about a month or
[39:57] two and then we can have that book on
[39:59] print and I'm just gonna use them as
[40:00] witnessing tools just to give out if the
[40:03] Lord willing but I'm really grateful for
[40:05] God's strength and to get that done by
[40:09] the grace of the Lord so I just want to
[40:12] update you on that if anybody wants to
[40:13] read the PDF I can email you the PDF
[40:15] really simply it so it's like six
[40:17] hundred some kilobytes it's a really
[40:19] small file if anybody wants to read it
[40:21] it's a lot of words like I said it's 80
[40:23] pages single-spaced so it's it's a lot
[40:25] of reading but if anybody wants to do
[40:27] any reading let me know by God's grace
[40:31] as we begin let's look at Laodicea again
[40:34] by the grace of the Lord I forgot to
[40:37] change the text here so I got the wrong
[40:39] I got the text from last Sunday so
[40:41] forgive me by updating everything else
[40:42] there so we're at part 54 in the series
[40:46] I did five on emphasis 8 on simona five
[40:50] on Pergamos 7 on Thyatira 9 on Sardis 13
[40:53] on Philadelphia this is the seventh on
[40:55] Laodicea and just romant reminding you
[40:59] that we are in the age of the open door
[41:01] right now the door of the name of Jesus
[41:05] the door of water baptism in the name of
[41:08] the Lord Jesus Christ and the Godhead as
[41:11] one person this door has just opened up
[41:14] recently from the Philadelphia Church
[41:17] age and so we are the we are the
[41:19] recipients of the open door aren't you
[41:22] glad the door has opened to heaven amen
[41:26] and there there is a door that's
[41:29] open and it's the Baptist of the Holy
[41:31] Ghost it's the eternal life that door of
[41:34] eternal life is open here through the
[41:37] name of God's Son Jesus Christ for that
[41:40] is God's name because the son comes in
[41:42] his father's name this door is opened up
[41:45] despite organizations and synagogues of
[41:47] Satan to raise up the doors opened up
[41:50] and we have to go through the open door
[41:52] for Jesus is the door Amen so glad that
[41:55] Christ is the door and we're here at the
[42:00] Laodicean Church age you know it's been
[42:01] 112 years we're inching closer to I
[42:04] wonder if our age will go longer than
[42:06] Ephesus I wonder
[42:08] but Ephesus was 117 years were at 112
[42:13] now since we crossed over to 2018 and
[42:15] we're still battling lukewarmness aren't
[42:18] we we're still overcoming lukewarm
[42:20] spirits praise God
[42:22] we're overcoming it with the Eagle
[42:24] anointing hallelujah
[42:26] flying above the church world systems
[42:28] and we're flying up into the heavenly
[42:30] atmospheres of the Word of God and so
[42:33] we're grateful for that now our text
[42:36] today is Jesus's loving correction and
[42:38] the Prophet addresses it in the church
[42:41] age book like this he said and now he
[42:43] says to his own as many as I love I
[42:45] rebuke and chasten now brother man said
[42:50] to reboot rebuke is to reprove to
[42:54] reprove is to expose with a view to
[42:56] correction Jason does not mean to punish
[43:00] it means the discipline because the
[43:03] subjects amendment is in mind so
[43:06] whenever Jesus corrects us his thought
[43:09] is for us to expose or to us to see to
[43:12] expose our weakness Jesus wants to see
[43:16] how weak we are but also give us the
[43:18] vision to where we need to go so he just
[43:22] doesn't you know I some bad parents they
[43:25] just like to punish their children but
[43:27] that's not the Lord the Lord does of
[43:29] course chasing us spanks us you know
[43:33] spiritually we'd say but he always does
[43:35] it and then he gives us the direction on
[43:37] where we need to go so if let's say
[43:40] temper is over you know we're overcome
[43:42] with temper
[43:43] and the Lord has to correct us on her
[43:44] temper he's going to correct us in our
[43:46] temper but then show us how to overcome
[43:49] our temper but man said your temper you
[43:52] you temper your temper he said through
[43:54] prayer you temper your anger through
[43:57] prayer amen
[43:58] and uh you know I got a text from
[44:04] overseas than this this brother keeps
[44:06] texting me like how can I overcome and I
[44:08] want the baptism of the Holy Ghost and
[44:09] every time I get in the setting he's a
[44:11] young man every time I get in the
[44:12] setting I just keep falling and I I said
[44:14] you've got to die you've got to you got
[44:18] to die out because the Bible said when
[44:20] we're baptized with Christ were baptized
[44:22] into his death and sin shall not have
[44:26] dominion over us anymore and so I said
[44:30] you haven't prayed hard enough and he
[44:31] text me back this morning like you're
[44:33] right praise the Lord you know I've got
[44:35] to get closer to God and I said that
[44:36] scripture you know we do not overcome be
[44:39] not overcome with evil he said every
[44:41] time he'd walk into his is gathering
[44:43] with his friends at the study place he
[44:45] said he'd be overcome with evil and I
[44:47] said you've got to overcome evil with
[44:49] good and if you can't overcome that
[44:52] situation at a study group and I'll say
[44:56] like this if we can overcome a situation
[44:57] that we should avoid them until we've
[44:59] got the power to overcome evil with good
[45:03] amen remember your Creator your you
[45:06] create atmospheres you can walk into a
[45:08] situation of anger or bitterness or
[45:11] backbiting you can walk into any
[45:13] situation and by your creative power
[45:15] that God gave to you you can change the
[45:18] atmosphere
[45:19] I'm you've ever seen that happen before
[45:20] in your life where God has used you to
[45:23] change the atmosphere amen it happens
[45:28] numerous times to me at work where I
[45:29] have to change the subject or I have to
[45:31] speak something good about the principle
[45:33] or speak something good about the
[45:34] teacher you got to change that or change
[45:36] or speak something good about the
[45:37] student you've got to change the
[45:40] atmosphere you got to take it from
[45:42] complaining to Thanksgiving
[45:44] praise God got take it from the negative
[45:47] to the positive praise the Lord and so
[45:49] this is how Jesus corrects he exposes he
[45:52] shows us our weakness but he gives us a
[45:55] view this
[45:56] is where you need to go this is how
[45:58] you're going to be corrected through the
[45:59] Word of God
[46:01] and that's why you know whenever I've
[46:05] got to preach a cutting message I may
[46:07] cut and cut and cut but at the end the
[46:09] offers always given come to the altar or
[46:12] come up for prayer come to the cross for
[46:14] healing amen if the words cutting you
[46:17] then you've got to allow it a chance to
[46:18] be healed with the balm of Gilead prays
[46:21] to the heart the balm of the Holy Spirit
[46:24] we've always it's always there's always
[46:26] the view to correction we can overcome
[46:29] we can be amended our character can get
[46:33] better praise the Lord because Jesus is
[46:36] interested in us becoming a better
[46:38] Christian now the love of Jesus the ones
[46:44] he loved would be rebuked and chastened
[46:48] now let's read Hebrews 12 5 through 11
[46:51] it's worth reading you know when my
[46:56] brother Paul came to visit quite a few
[46:57] years ago in the Waterloo Church he gave
[47:00] a testimony and his scripture for his
[47:03] life was this scripture right here he'd
[47:04] been through numerous car accidents and
[47:06] and his in his testimony he said it was
[47:10] because he was running from the Lord he
[47:12] knew God was allowing injuries and God
[47:16] was allowing car accidents because he
[47:18] wasn't fulfilling the Word of God and I
[47:21] always remember that about his testimony
[47:22] that this was the scripture that he read
[47:24] and as he was reading it that night he
[47:26] was weeping and crying and still
[47:28] thankful that God allowed him to go
[47:30] through the car accidents and still be
[47:32] alive and see the hand of mercy in the
[47:36] midst of the car accidents he'd been in
[47:38] he's been in at least three now and each
[47:41] time has walked away by the grace of God
[47:43] verse 5 and he had forgotten the
[47:45] exhortation which speaketh unto you as
[47:47] unto children my son despise not thou
[47:52] the chastening of the Lord nor faint
[47:54] when thou art rebuked of him now if
[47:58] we're real sensitive we'll get real
[48:00] discouraged if somebody rebukes us how
[48:01] many know what I'm talking about if
[48:03] you're really sensitive boy if somebody
[48:04] rebukes you all it's just like ruins
[48:06] your day in my room
[48:08] you're weak I know it's hard for me to
[48:10] get rebuked sometimes it's hard for
[48:13] brother Brown to be rebuked by his wife
[48:15] when she said Oh bill
[48:17] shame on you for thinking you weren't
[48:18] called to the ministry remember when he
[48:20] said that his wife rebuked him he said
[48:22] our brothers aren't you glad for a godly
[48:24] wife when he starts talking all this
[48:27] negative she said oh you ought to be
[48:28] ashamed of yourself bill behind but see
[48:33] we can't let ourselves get discouraged
[48:36] we're not to faint and give up and oh
[48:38] there's just no hope I just can't get it
[48:40] right
[48:40] I just can't overcome God doesn't want
[48:42] us to faint he doesn't want us to quit
[48:45] trying he wants us to take courage and
[48:47] see where he's taking us he's taking us
[48:51] somewhere
[48:52] yes we've still done wrong yes he knows
[48:54] you've done wrong but if you've asked
[48:56] forgiveness he's forgiven you anyway it
[48:58] wants to take you somewhere he wants us
[49:00] to go forward
[49:01] he always corrects with the idea that
[49:04] I'm gonna take brother Jesse higher in
[49:06] Christ amen because I need correction I
[49:10] need the Word of God to guide me and
[49:11] strengthen me in to correct me but he
[49:13] wants to take us higher in Christ so
[49:16] don't give up don't faint if you might
[49:19] have to take a little side take a side
[49:21] but then take courage sign don't maybe
[49:25] don't cry I'll say I would say I don't
[49:27] have a verse 6 for whom the Lord loveth
[49:29] he chasing us it's a good sign God loves
[49:32] you if he's correcting you and scourgeth
[49:37] every son which he receiveth and that
[49:39] word means a spanking a beating he
[49:43] scourge as he spanks every child that he
[49:47] loves praise the Lord
[49:51] think about the thing about how Jonah
[49:53] was spanked you know he got spanked
[49:56] remember the burning of after his gourd
[49:59] died there and he got he got spanked he
[50:02] got spanked in the belly of a whale with
[50:03] seaweed all over him he got spanked next
[50:07] time Jonah you'll learn to honor my word
[50:10] because I love you and God gave him a
[50:14] chance right God gave him a second
[50:15] chance to go to Nineveh aren't you glad
[50:17] for second chances our God is the God of
[50:21] second chances
[50:22] he corrects us and lets us try it again
[50:24] by his grace so don't give him up don't
[50:28] think but yet if you make a mistake he's
[50:30] gonna have to spank us and scourge us
[50:32] but he does that because he loves us
[50:36] I've only had two you know spank my
[50:38] children a few times over the years not
[50:40] very much and I noticed if I've got to
[50:42] apply the rod they really get better
[50:44] right away thankfully for that my dad
[50:48] like I said my dad only had to spank me
[50:50] one time that I remember and I never did
[50:53] that again there's something about when
[50:55] you know it's the hand of God when you
[50:58] know you've gone against God and you've
[51:00] reaped the effects of the seed you sowed
[51:03] there's something about it that teaches
[51:05] us a lesson that we know next time we'll
[51:07] never do it again and that's what God
[51:09] wants us to learn God wants us to learn
[51:12] not to make that mistake again
[51:14] but to always obey the word of the Lord
[51:17] that's right verse 7 if ye endure
[51:21] chastening God dealeth with us son
[51:23] there's a big if this is why Judas was
[51:25] not a son he couldn't endure the
[51:27] correction of the Lord no doubt Judas
[51:30] Judas heard the most anointed services
[51:33] ever preached he couldn't say well my
[51:36] preacher wasn't anointed he had God
[51:38] Himself preaching to him but he couldn't
[51:41] endure the correction of the word of
[51:43] Jesus preached he couldn't stay with it
[51:45] he wanted to leave it he'd rather sell
[51:47] it out and you know get away from it for
[51:49] a little while
[51:49] he couldn't endure it but if we can
[51:52] endure the Word of God that's preached
[51:54] to us learn from it grow from it then
[51:58] God will treat us like sons and
[51:59] daughters amen
[52:01] for what son is he whom the father
[52:04] chased us not he's not a son if God
[52:08] doesn't chasing you or you're not a son
[52:11] or daughter what kind of child what kind
[52:14] of a dog grows up who's never chasing as
[52:16] a child what do they act like they're
[52:18] selfish right all they can think about
[52:21] is themselves they have no sense that
[52:24] they've lost their conscience they can
[52:27] just do evil and there and then they're
[52:29] just they're okay with it and they they
[52:32] have what the Bible calls we know a
[52:34] reprobate mind
[52:36] because they haven't been trained to
[52:39] obey the Word of God they haven't been
[52:41] corrected and then seen well this is
[52:44] what you need to act like it when you
[52:46] need to do the correct decision next
[52:48] time or son I know you're gonna
[52:50] eventually be able to live like this
[52:52] they never had somebody sit down with
[52:54] them and tell them here's where I see
[52:56] you going this is where you're gonna
[52:57] live and you're as far as in the ways of
[53:00] God
[53:01] you're gonna obey next time they never
[53:03] had that and so it's very hard for them
[53:05] to obey and hear the voice of God that's
[53:08] right what son is he whom the father
[53:12] chased us down he's not much of a son
[53:14] he's not very diligent with the father's
[53:17] possessions right that's right
[53:19] verse 8 but if ye be without
[53:22] chastisement whereof all are partakers
[53:25] then are ye bastards and not sons so God
[53:31] doesn't even really place them in his
[53:33] family they're not even really
[53:34] considered family members if they don't
[53:37] go through the chastening of the Lord
[53:39] and we just saw last week the rich young
[53:41] ruler wouldn't be corrected by Christ
[53:42] and yet God blessed him now you see that
[53:46] seems like God bless his business
[53:49] efforts and yet he wouldn't endure why
[53:53] does God allow that God because the
[53:54] Bible said sin is pleasurable first
[53:56] season God gives him that season some
[53:59] people season is longer right than
[54:01] others but their sin their their
[54:04] pleasures of sin lasts for a season and
[54:07] God allows that as a temptation to prove
[54:12] to them and to prove to the devil and
[54:13] approved to God that they wouldn't serve
[54:16] God anyway no matter how many blessings
[54:18] they had they wouldn't serve God but a
[54:20] real Christian will serve God it no
[54:21] matter what you take from them amen
[54:24] because they're not bastards they're not
[54:26] children that are not of the family of
[54:29] God they are children of God
[54:32] the scripture tells us this so my
[54:36] prayers Lord chasing me when I'm wrong
[54:39] correct me I mean you know how it is as
[54:43] a parent when you see your children do
[54:44] wrong you just want to see them do right
[54:46] don't you you just want to
[54:49] them step up and and do what's right and
[54:52] that's how the Lord as the Lord just
[54:54] wants us to step up and do what we ought
[54:56] to do amen
[54:58] because we're his children verse 9
[55:03] furthermore we have had fathers of our
[55:05] flesh which corrected us and we gave
[55:07] them reverence hopefully you gave your
[55:09] father reverence hopefully your father
[55:10] was a godly man shall we not much rather
[55:14] be in subjection unto the father of
[55:16] spirits and live if we can respect our
[55:19] earthly father and mother what about our
[55:21] heavenly father he's saying he's pulling
[55:23] this parallel and that's why we teach
[55:26] the children if the children can obey
[55:28] their parents when they're young then
[55:29] they can surely obey God when they get
[55:31] older because God is such a more
[55:34] faithful parent than we are even as
[55:36] parents right that's why they had they
[55:38] said honor your mother and father and I
[55:40] promise you a long life on the earth
[55:42] there's such a blessing if they can just
[55:44] learn to respect their natural parents
[55:47] then they'll learn to respect their
[55:48] heavenly parent God Almighty he's the
[55:53] father of spirits verse 10 for they
[55:56] verily for a few days chasing us after
[55:59] their own pleasure she's just a few days
[56:02] how many can look back at your childhood
[56:04] it just to seem like a few days then
[56:06] lasts very long you just I see my
[56:08] children grow up my their childhood seen
[56:09] the last just a few days I was looking
[56:12] at a picture they have Lydia and maybe
[56:14] occasionally I and Lydia was about a
[56:15] halfway up my thigh there I got Malachi
[56:19] on my knee and I've got to Kristen's
[56:21] hole in the case she has a brand new
[56:22] baby it's just a few days you know
[56:25] didn't last very long
[56:26] oh how we missed those times just a few
[56:31] days we have to chasing our children but
[56:34] God for our prophet that we might be
[56:37] partakers of his holiness
[56:39] so God corrects us so we'll enjoy the
[56:43] holy spirit amen
[56:45] how many want to walk in the spirit that
[56:48] God is trying to correct us so we can
[56:50] enjoy the blessings of this land
[56:52] hallelujah the milk and honey of this
[56:55] land ha ha hallelujah he's got to
[56:58] correct us and show us where we're wrong
[57:00] so we won't walk in the flesh we'll walk
[57:03] in the spirit and enjoy all the
[57:04] blessings of this Promised Land
[57:06] amen we partake or partaking of the
[57:10] grapes of the land or partaking of the
[57:12] milk and the honey the blessings of the
[57:14] good Word of God
[57:15] huh me know your happiest when you're
[57:17] obeying the Lord when you're walking the
[57:19] spirit you are your happiest you're your
[57:21] most content when you're honoring God's
[57:23] Word and walking the Holy Spirit that's
[57:26] right
[57:27] verse 11 now no chastening for the
[57:31] present seemed to be joyous nobody
[57:33] really gets joy out of being corrected
[57:35] right but grievious nevertheless
[57:38] afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
[57:39] fruit of righteousness unto them which
[57:44] are exercised thereby so if you can
[57:47] endure the hardships of being corrected
[57:49] pretty soon you're gonna see the fruits
[57:52] of being corrected you're gonna see the
[57:54] effects like we said last week sowing
[57:56] and reaping if you can sow and and let
[57:59] God plant these seeds of obedience at
[58:02] the end of it you'll see all the fruits
[58:05] of obedience amen the fruit of the
[58:08] Spirit the Bible calls it hallelujah so
[58:11] look at verse 12 so what does it say so
[58:12] we've got to go through chase things so
[58:14] what you do verse 12 wherefore lift up
[58:16] the hands which hang down and the feeble
[58:19] knees you've got a hard time lifting
[58:21] your hands this morning go ahead and
[58:22] lift them now lift them in praise that
[58:25] then the service don't be discouraged
[58:27] don't faint don't quit don't give up if
[58:29] God keeps correcting you be grateful and
[58:32] do or the hard season let the seeds we
[58:35] planted in your life that you'll see the
[58:37] fruits later on amen that's right lift
[58:40] up the hands they praise the Lord amen
[58:42] say hallelujah lift up the feeble knees
[58:45] right
[58:46] get ready to move get ready to walk with
[58:49] the Lord and make straight paths for
[58:52] your feet lest that which is lame be
[58:56] turned out of the way but let it rather
[58:58] be healed amen
[59:01] follow peace with all men and holiness
[59:04] without which no man shall see the Lord
[59:07] looking diligently lest any man fail the
[59:10] grace of God to see it as God's grace to
[59:14] correct us if we don't take correction
[59:16] we have failed God's grace because it
[59:21] speaks of Esau but won't go to that the
[59:25] Bible says that let's finish the verse
[59:27] 15 looking to og lest any man fail the
[59:29] grace of God lest any root of bitterness
[59:31] springing up trouble you and thereby
[59:33] many be defiled see when we get we're
[59:38] not careful this is like Jezebel
[59:39] remember when she was gonna get
[59:40] corrected by Jihu what'd she do she put
[59:42] the blame on Zimmer
[59:44] or on JG who remember that and here's
[59:48] what the Bible says when you get
[59:49] corrected by God you can't blame others
[59:52] for the problem you got a look to
[59:53] yourself and say God forgive me
[59:56] Jezebel was saying oh you're gonna be
[59:57] just like army you're gonna you're gonna
[59:59] take the kingdom the wrong way and so
[1:00:02] she got all the blame off of her and put
[1:00:03] it on Jihu and Jehu said who's on my
[1:00:05] side
[1:00:06] who's got the anointing of God on them
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:10] she didn't even listen to Jezebel we
[1:00:12] shouldn't even listen to worldly life
[1:00:13] don't even listen to Satan for a minute
[1:00:15] just obey the Word of God just be
[1:00:17] anointed by the Spirit amen
[1:00:20] see but a root of bitterness will spring
[1:00:22] up there like it did in Jezebel if we
[1:00:25] cannot accept the correction of the Lord
[1:00:27] that says that's how you know like you
[1:00:30] use this tongue speaking in tongues
[1:00:32] there's an easy example if somebody is
[1:00:34] out of order with tongues and and let's
[1:00:36] say they give the wrong interpretation
[1:00:37] brother Branham said when you try to
[1:00:39] correct them if they don't listen to you
[1:00:41] and say you're right he said this shows
[1:00:43] they've got the wrong spirit anyone who
[1:00:47] can't take correction from the Word of
[1:00:48] God he's got the wrong spirit harboring
[1:00:51] the wrong spirit rather than obeying the
[1:00:53] Holy Spirit that's the tell a telltale
[1:00:57] sign that someone has the Holy Spirit
[1:00:59] and it's constantly growing in things of
[1:01:01] God because they can be corrected by the
[1:01:03] Word of God the child of God can be
[1:01:06] corrected by their father amen and the
[1:01:10] father gave us his word the father
[1:01:11] spirits gave us his word on how to live
[1:01:14] they meant his behavior guideline book
[1:01:17] amen so see this is what God does he he
[1:01:21] treats us like children
[1:01:22] now I'm 37 I'm almost 40 I don't really
[1:01:26] feel like a child anymore but I've got
[1:01:28] the picture myself as a
[1:01:30] child in the ways of God and those of
[1:01:33] you that have served God longer than I
[1:01:34] have you still have to picture yourself
[1:01:36] as a child before God right in other
[1:01:42] words I will need to be corrected God
[1:01:45] will have to correct me and show me so I
[1:01:47] can walk in the right paths we don't
[1:01:50] want to stumble from one path to another
[1:01:52] do we we don't want to start just make
[1:01:53] it through the week and make it through
[1:01:55] the year and kind of stumble and we want
[1:01:57] to know exactly where we're going we
[1:02:00] want to be on the path that God has
[1:02:01] called for us we want straight past the
[1:02:04] Bible said I want to be on the way of
[1:02:07] holiness don't you and out it's a
[1:02:09] straight road it's a it's a narrow road
[1:02:11] that goes up to heaven hallelujah I want
[1:02:14] to stay on the straight path I don't
[1:02:15] want to wander into this and then
[1:02:16] wandering to that I want to stay on the
[1:02:18] straight and narrow that's a child of
[1:02:21] God he keeps his path straight with the
[1:02:24] word of the Lord now here it is set
[1:02:29] forth the love of God so when you read
[1:02:31] when we read Hebrews 12 now we can see
[1:02:34] God's love set forth to us he desired in
[1:02:39] love a family of his own a family of
[1:02:42] sons sons like himself there before him
[1:02:47] lies all mankind as one lump of clay
[1:02:51] imagine that's how God sees you as a
[1:02:53] lump of clay you are as a clay well I
[1:02:57] tell you you can make some real
[1:02:58] beautiful clay ceramic pieces can't you
[1:03:00] if you got somebody who's really good
[1:03:02] with clay you can make some real
[1:03:04] beautiful things remember after we got
[1:03:06] married my wife gave a bunch out and we
[1:03:09] go over to our family for after our
[1:03:11] wedding you know she and we go over to
[1:03:12] my her mom's house and we still see
[1:03:14] though saving with ceramic pieces there
[1:03:16] because it's a value it's you you've
[1:03:19] made something beautiful out of
[1:03:20] something that not so beautiful at the
[1:03:22] beginning God sees this as a lump of
[1:03:25] clay out of that same lump he will now
[1:03:27] make vessels unto honor and the dishonor
[1:03:30] the choosing will be his own choosing
[1:03:32] then those chosen ones born of his
[1:03:35] Spirit will be trained to conform to his
[1:03:40] image in their walk trained
[1:03:43] sound familiar like child trained like
[1:03:46] going through the training of a child
[1:03:49] that may be the training of a sports
[1:03:51] team or the training of a new job when
[1:03:54] you have to go through the training of a
[1:03:55] new job those chosen of God when they're
[1:03:58] born of spirit are trained to conform to
[1:04:01] his image in their walk
[1:04:03] so all walks we have to be trained to
[1:04:06] walk like Christ walked amen trained to
[1:04:13] walk like Christ walked he reproves with
[1:04:18] all long-suffering and gentleness and
[1:04:21] mercy I like this he chastens with
[1:04:25] nail-scarred hands so before the Lord
[1:04:29] you know would correct you you looked at
[1:04:30] in his hand you know he'd have a hole
[1:04:32] there I tore a scar from where the hole
[1:04:34] used to be his hands he knows what
[1:04:36] sufferings all about and the reason he's
[1:04:39] correcting you is so you can be more
[1:04:41] like him I thought that's beautiful
[1:04:47] but you know when you got to go through
[1:04:49] me know when you go through training at
[1:04:51] a new job you really got to follow all
[1:04:52] the rules you got to follow your
[1:04:55] training to a tee right do you think
[1:04:59] they're going to hire you in your
[1:05:00] training if you're not paying attention
[1:05:02] do you think you'll get the job if
[1:05:05] they're training at McDonald's to flip a
[1:05:06] burger and you can't flip a burger and
[1:05:08] you're on your cell phone texting the
[1:05:10] whole time you think they're gonna hire
[1:05:11] you course not when they train you they
[1:05:16] want you to be diligent about your
[1:05:17] training they want their training you so
[1:05:20] you'll remember how to act when you get
[1:05:23] out in the real job and that's what
[1:05:25] Christ is doing here this morning he's
[1:05:27] training us so he can take his word and
[1:05:30] live it out in our daily lives he wants
[1:05:33] us to be trained to be conformed or
[1:05:36] fashioned to his image but it takes a
[1:05:41] training we've got to pay attention
[1:05:43] right we've got to listen during
[1:05:45] training it's got to be important the
[1:05:48] training has to be important to us we
[1:05:50] got to really listen to our supervisor
[1:05:51] I'm so glad we have a supervisor who
[1:05:54] never makes a mistake our Lord Jesus
[1:05:57] he's going to train us he's going to
[1:06:00] correct us with nail-scarred hands I
[1:06:04] just want you to know the nail-scarred
[1:06:07] hand should remind us of his suffering
[1:06:09] then if we remember his suffering we can
[1:06:13] suffer through our trials whether they
[1:06:15] were our fault or just a test like job
[1:06:18] Joel was just a test apparently now
[1:06:21] brother Bram City had a little fear and
[1:06:22] these things came upon him but when God
[1:06:24] said when God looked at him God said
[1:06:26] he's a perfect man he's forgiven by the
[1:06:29] blood of his sacrifice so it really
[1:06:31] wasn't job's fault now Jonah that was
[1:06:34] his fault he should have went to Nineveh
[1:06:38] but he chose a ship to Tarshish that's
[1:06:41] what he chose it was his choice so he
[1:06:44] had to suffer for his own decisions amen
[1:06:47] but was he a son yes because he does
[1:06:50] eventually know in the very lowest spot
[1:06:52] of that that that ocean in the belly of
[1:06:55] that whale he cried out to God and he
[1:06:57] quoted Solomon's prayer that I'll lift
[1:06:59] your holy temple and if I look to your
[1:07:01] temple and pray you'll hear an answer
[1:07:03] amen so the trial brought him to his
[1:07:06] lowest position physically and
[1:07:08] spiritually that's what the trial did
[1:07:13] and that's what trials do helped us to
[1:07:15] do it's a faithful saying if we be dead
[1:07:17] with him so we got to be dead just our
[1:07:19] sin we got to be dead to our desires we
[1:07:25] shall also live with him if we suffer we
[1:07:31] shall also reign with him if we deny him
[1:07:35] they'll also deny us so he cannot deny
[1:07:38] any of the word we've got to Keith the
[1:07:40] word and suffer in well-doing the Bible
[1:07:42] says just do what's right make the right
[1:07:45] decision do what the Word of God says
[1:07:47] and remember it's nail-scarred hands
[1:07:50] that are correcting you he's been
[1:07:52] through the fires of trial he's overcome
[1:07:54] every drop he's overcome harder trials
[1:07:57] that will ever have to overcome and if
[1:07:59] he did it then his spirits here to help
[1:08:01] us do it through our trials amen whether
[1:08:04] it's our fault or whether it was a test
[1:08:05] like job like we sang on Wednesday
[1:08:07] though he slay me yet I'll trust him I
[1:08:09] love that song
[1:08:13] the Prophet says sometimes this Potter
[1:08:16] must take the vessel he's working on and
[1:08:18] thoroughly break it down in order that
[1:08:21] he may rebuild it exactly as he desires
[1:08:25] it but it is love that is his love
[1:08:31] another way of his love there is that
[1:08:33] there cannot be in every year I modeling
[1:08:37] claimed my class and every year we have
[1:08:38] a science unit where we have to design a
[1:08:41] boat that floats and so you know when
[1:08:45] I'm in a hurry to the previous year I'll
[1:08:47] just kind of smash up those boats a
[1:08:49] little bit and put them in the bag and
[1:08:50] try to get right try to get ready to the
[1:08:51] move I'll move on to the next lesson
[1:08:53] well a year goes around I usually teach
[1:08:55] in the fall as our first science unit on
[1:08:57] physical science and they have and they
[1:08:59] have to design a boat and so I've got to
[1:09:02] take that clay and it already looks like
[1:09:04] a boat that's gonna float I know what a
[1:09:05] boat that's gonna float made of model
[1:09:07] clay I know what it looks like
[1:09:09] so I've before the lesson I always
[1:09:10] forget like oh yeah that's right I got
[1:09:12] to smash these down and make them so
[1:09:13] they don't look anything like the right
[1:09:16] design and so the first two children
[1:09:17] will fail you know they'll try to make a
[1:09:19] real flat boat but you got to give it
[1:09:22] you know got to give it a bottom you got
[1:09:23] to give it to some room and then it has
[1:09:25] to be tall enough so the water can't
[1:09:27] flow into it so you've got to have the
[1:09:29] right design they try to make it flat
[1:09:30] like a piece of paper these six and
[1:09:33] seven-year-olds and so that's what I
[1:09:37] think of when I've got it
[1:09:38] sometimes it's got to be thoroughly
[1:09:39] broken down and the children toys come
[1:09:41] to me and say mr. Smith this is hard now
[1:09:43] I know modelling clay is hard you've got
[1:09:46] to put some heat and pressure on it and
[1:09:48] sorry after that lesson I end up with
[1:09:51] blue hands yellow hands and green hands
[1:09:53] go got that modeling clay all over there
[1:09:54] because I've got to thoroughly push it
[1:09:57] down I've got to lean over I tell the
[1:09:58] children you got to lean over that you
[1:10:00] got to put your weight into that amen
[1:10:02] and sometimes God puts the pressure on
[1:10:05] us he really puts the pressure on us
[1:10:08] what are you gonna do as he's leaning
[1:10:11] over and smashing your life or your
[1:10:14] attitude or your character or whatever
[1:10:16] is he wants to thoroughly break it down
[1:10:18] that he can rebuild it a rebuilt life
[1:10:23] how many could say amen to that
[1:10:25] Jesus rebuild my life this is Ryan
[1:10:28] Church age book this is right where we
[1:10:30] write in our progression on the church
[1:10:31] page book to rebuild our lives we've got
[1:10:34] to be willing to have God rebuild our
[1:10:36] lives to be shaped more like the life
[1:10:38] he'd like us to live that's right that's
[1:10:42] the first thing I thought of was just
[1:10:43] leaning over then I get I get I get clay
[1:10:48] in my ring I get clay on my fingernails
[1:10:50] but it's worth it because they that's
[1:10:52] one of the lessons they learn that's one
[1:10:54] of the ones they remember the most at
[1:10:56] the end of the year is building these
[1:10:58] boats and and making them float and
[1:11:01] that's what God does it is God's love
[1:11:04] that will thoroughly break a man down
[1:11:06] think about Jobe again God had to take
[1:11:09] remember there was three waves of trials
[1:11:11] remember he first lost his animals and
[1:11:14] he lost forget what after that and then
[1:11:16] he lost his children three waves he lost
[1:11:18] everything and then he still got on his
[1:11:21] knees and said blessed be the Lord he
[1:11:23] gives and takes away and the devil said
[1:11:25] watch this because he's got good health
[1:11:27] he said well let me let me touch his
[1:11:28] body said God God said don't don't take
[1:11:31] his life just put your hand on his body
[1:11:33] and that's when he really started
[1:11:35] questioning that's when he really had
[1:11:38] some mind battles when God even let his
[1:11:40] health get attacked but there was no
[1:11:43] other way forgot to do it because that's
[1:11:46] God's Way of love he's got to break us
[1:11:48] down
[1:11:48] to build us up again there is no other
[1:11:53] way according to the prophet of God in
[1:11:56] the Bible a chai many times you see with
[1:11:59] children they got to be broken down from
[1:12:00] their old habit in order to do their new
[1:12:02] habit like we do we do math on the iPad
[1:12:05] at school and I've got to break their
[1:12:07] habits and sometimes it's hard like
[1:12:10] sometimes if we're doing like six plus
[1:12:11] two and they're gonna use their fingers
[1:12:13] to count on I've got to break their
[1:12:15] habits they'll say six seven eight and
[1:12:18] they'll put up like three fingers and
[1:12:20] nine and they'll put up the wrong one
[1:12:21] they'll put up different numbers of
[1:12:22] fingers so I've got to hold their hand
[1:12:24] down and a teach him to teach them to
[1:12:27] count on the right way this is my job
[1:12:28] you know some of you brothers working
[1:12:31] really hard and there's steel and sparks
[1:12:33] flying and I've got sparks of anger
[1:12:35] flying around all day sparks of
[1:12:37] complaining and
[1:12:38] sparks of emotion raw emotion I've got
[1:12:41] to train them there's no other way for
[1:12:43] me to do it I've got to show them how to
[1:12:45] do it and I've got to guide them step by
[1:12:47] step and then they pretty soon they get
[1:12:48] it six seven eight and seven eight nine
[1:12:50] and then six seven eight nine ten and
[1:12:53] you've got to do it there's no other way
[1:12:55] you've got to take them through the hard
[1:12:57] process of breaking down their old habit
[1:13:00] and making sure they've got the new
[1:13:01] habits how many want new habits to serve
[1:13:04] the Lord the right habits this is how it
[1:13:07] does it he breaks us down thoroughly to
[1:13:09] get rid of our old habits and builds us
[1:13:12] up with new habits I've got a new habit
[1:13:15] for those of you who like goal-setting
[1:13:16] I've got a new habit every day and I
[1:13:19] didn't bring my goal page with me but
[1:13:20] I've I've started writing out my to-do
[1:13:22] lists every day on paper and I just make
[1:13:25] a bulleted list and this this works for
[1:13:27] me I found this is this is God
[1:13:28] retraining me so before each day I write
[1:13:31] down the things I want to do the next
[1:13:32] day and on Sunday I'll write everything
[1:13:33] down the whole week I got to do some
[1:13:35] like it just it does something for me
[1:13:37] it's like I remember it better and so
[1:13:38] I'll take a picture of that that to-do
[1:13:41] lists each day and I'll email it to
[1:13:42] myself because my emails like my
[1:13:44] constant to-do list and I just love when
[1:13:47] it finally gets down and shortened
[1:13:48] because it just keeps filling up all day
[1:13:50] all day all day they're gonna emptied
[1:13:51] out and fill it up the next day and so I
[1:13:54] found this habit to be helpful for me
[1:13:56] with the things of God for example
[1:13:58] around there I gotta prepare sermon for
[1:14:00] Wednesday on Monday I gotta start that
[1:14:01] Monday Monday I got a write for 30
[1:14:03] minutes on my modesty book and Tuesday
[1:14:06] I've got to do all this and I found that
[1:14:09] if I I found this habit has helped me to
[1:14:11] focus and get more done I started that
[1:14:14] book December 22nd and I finished on
[1:14:17] February 10th so less than two months
[1:14:19] 80,000 I'm sorry eighty pages
[1:14:21] forty-three thousand words and I found
[1:14:24] this is a way God had to break down my
[1:14:26] habits because before I just say well I
[1:14:28] look on my phone and and pretty soon the
[1:14:29] phone became common so I found another
[1:14:32] way oh I've got to write it down take a
[1:14:34] picture of it keep it in the place where
[1:14:35] I look the most and I found the most
[1:14:37] success there as far as the habits
[1:14:40] changing my habits to be more focused on
[1:14:43] the things I like to do now how many
[1:14:46] want more habits that glorify the Lord
[1:14:48] and that's where that's what we have
[1:14:50] after over me I've got to write that on
[1:14:52] there I've got a prayer
[1:14:52] I read my Bible contact so and so do
[1:14:55] these things I got that's what that's
[1:14:57] the way I found to help change my habits
[1:15:00] that I can do the right things that I
[1:15:03] want to do because remember like Paul
[1:15:05] said when I want to do good evils right
[1:15:06] there there's this is such a quick
[1:15:09] temptation I'll just neglect my
[1:15:11] responsibilities for a few days I'll
[1:15:13] just put this off for a day but I found
[1:15:15] for me like for the habits God giving me
[1:15:18] I've got the mint and that's the way of
[1:15:19] meditation writing it down meditating on
[1:15:22] these things and I found for me that's
[1:15:24] been a real victory a real way God has
[1:15:26] shown me on how to develop good godly
[1:15:28] habits I've gotta look at it I've got to
[1:15:31] meditate on it I've got to ride it I got
[1:15:33] to take a picture of it I've got to send
[1:15:34] it to myself an email just so I can be
[1:15:36] focused on the right things if not that
[1:15:39] evil is gonna be right there with me the
[1:15:41] whole time
[1:15:46] praise the Lord thank God that he breaks
[1:15:49] us down thoroughly in order to build up
[1:15:51] good habits now the Prophet goes into
[1:15:55] this little thought after he talks about
[1:15:57] being rebuked by God he talks about
[1:16:02] Satan's threefold power
[1:16:04] Oh little flock do not fear this age is
[1:16:07] fast closing as it does those tears will
[1:16:10] be bound together and as a three-fold
[1:16:12] cord is not easily broken they'll have a
[1:16:14] tremendous threefold strength of
[1:16:16] political physical and spiritual satanic
[1:16:21] empower and they will seek to destroy
[1:16:23] the Bride of Christ she will suffer but
[1:16:27] she will endure if you're not those
[1:16:30] things that are coming upon the earth I
[1:16:32] love this for he who loved his own love
[1:16:36] them unto the end think about Jesus and
[1:16:41] his disciples and his crucifixion who
[1:16:43] left to who was the one that got scared
[1:16:46] and left was it Jesus that left his
[1:16:48] disciples or was his disciples that left
[1:16:50] him his disciples left him Jesus loved
[1:16:55] them unto the end but they chose to
[1:16:58] separate themselves from the Word of God
[1:17:00] Jesus's love is so faithful
[1:17:03] Churchill loved us to the end of the
[1:17:05] Laodicean
[1:17:06] jay-j men but it's gone that we're have
[1:17:09] to go through some suffering we're going
[1:17:11] to go through some correction he's got
[1:17:13] to show us and break us down in order to
[1:17:15] show us where we're going in Christ see
[1:17:20] his faithful love will keep rebuking
[1:17:23] chastening and rebuilding our habits and
[1:17:26] our behavior until the very end of time
[1:17:30] to the end of our lives to the end of
[1:17:33] time whichever comes first whether we've
[1:17:35] got to die and then go to the rapture or
[1:17:37] just be changed in the moment and going
[1:17:39] the rapture either way we must accept
[1:17:42] that God loves us and because God loves
[1:17:44] me he's gonna correct me he's gonna show
[1:17:46] me where I'm wrong break me down and
[1:17:49] build me up to be a better Christian
[1:17:50] amen praise the Lord Amen hallelujah the
[1:17:56] hard part is we don't like our we don't
[1:17:58] like being broken down right we don't
[1:18:01] like to think all my life my routines
[1:18:02] are gonna change and Oh change is so
[1:18:05] hard you know changes that it can be
[1:18:09] difficult it is difficult the pressure
[1:18:11] and heat is difficult but it's worth it
[1:18:13] if we're gonna be trained to be
[1:18:15] conformed in fashion in the Christ it's
[1:18:18] God's only way to do it break us down
[1:18:23] now the Prophet goes of this thought on
[1:18:25] the consummation of the Gentile ages we
[1:18:28] are coming down to the very end of time
[1:18:34] in fact brother bran
[1:18:36] about his ministry he said thus saith
[1:18:38] the Lord they'll never be a greater
[1:18:39] ministry to the Gentiles than his
[1:18:40] ministry so we're not going to see
[1:18:42] anything as far as supernaturally we're
[1:18:45] not going to see anything more
[1:18:46] supernatural than the Ministry brother
[1:18:47] branham that discernment that we saw we
[1:18:50] can still watch it on tape and we can
[1:18:52] still hear it on tape we're not gonna
[1:18:53] see anything greater than that and so we
[1:18:57] we're not going to be deceived right and
[1:19:00] if any preacher rises up and pretends
[1:19:02] like they have a greater gift than
[1:19:04] brother Branham we're not going to be
[1:19:05] deceived because we've got thus saith
[1:19:07] the Lord the greatest sign that God gave
[1:19:09] to Abraham before the ghent of the
[1:19:11] destruction of Nineveh I'm starting out
[1:19:13] a bit with Sodom was that is the son of
[1:19:15] man to servant that was the greatest
[1:19:18] side he had before right before the body
[1:19:20] change and then before the destruction
[1:19:22] of Sodom so we've got to understand that
[1:19:27] and we've also got to understand that as
[1:19:29] we come to maturity the tares are going
[1:19:33] to come to maturity as well we can see
[1:19:36] them binding with online I didn't watch
[1:19:38] the Superboy I don't believe in watching
[1:19:40] the Superbowl but the day after they had
[1:19:42] a little article on there on the website
[1:19:44] and it said there was a Superbowl
[1:19:46] commercial that stressed the unity of
[1:19:49] one world religion so I I just clicked
[1:19:51] on there and watched it it was a Toyota
[1:19:53] commercial and the Toyota commercial all
[1:19:56] these football fans are going to a
[1:19:57] football game and there's a there's a
[1:19:59] Catholic nun there's a Catholic priest
[1:20:02] there's a Muslim priest there's a Hindu
[1:20:06] guy and they all get in the Toyota truck
[1:20:09] and go off to the game and they all sit
[1:20:10] by each other in the stands and say
[1:20:13] we're on the same team and this is the
[1:20:16] propaganda that's being pushed out to
[1:20:17] these people right this is the
[1:20:21] propaganda they're all in the same team
[1:20:23] yeah that's the devil's team but God's
[1:20:27] team is the way of the word amen the way
[1:20:30] of Jesus Christ
[1:20:32] remember Muslims they've recognized
[1:20:33] Jesus was a prophet but they won't say
[1:20:35] his blood was the blood of God's own son
[1:20:37] they won't say he was the sacrifice and
[1:20:40] if they reject the sacrifice then they
[1:20:42] reject the forgiveness is that right
[1:20:45] to reject the blood is to be out from
[1:20:47] under the blood we accept the blood so
[1:20:49] were
[1:20:49] under the blood amen we're forgiven
[1:20:52] because we accept the blood of God's own
[1:20:54] son but this is the propaganda and it's
[1:20:57] increasing remember ever if years ago
[1:21:00] everybody fell in love with the Pope
[1:21:02] everybody falls in love with the mother
[1:21:04] harlot that's just that's just what the
[1:21:05] Bible says just what the Bible says
[1:21:08] we're all the same and the Pope had a
[1:21:10] commercial last year around Super Bowl
[1:21:12] time where all these different faiths
[1:21:14] said we're all on the same team I have
[1:21:16] that sort of my computer if you like to
[1:21:17] watch it after service I can pull that
[1:21:19] one up they said we're all on faith and
[1:21:22] we're all if the Bible says there's only
[1:21:23] one faith but see these are all coming
[1:21:27] to a fruition brother BAM says they're
[1:21:29] all coming to maturity and as they get
[1:21:31] more mature and powerful they're gonna
[1:21:33] bring some type of little squeezed upon
[1:21:35] the bride we know that here's what he
[1:21:37] says this age is the last of the seven
[1:21:40] Church ages what began the first or
[1:21:42] Ephesian age must and will come to a
[1:21:44] full fruition and harvest in the last or
[1:21:48] Laodicean age the two vines will yield
[1:21:51] their final fruit what's the final fruit
[1:21:55] of the bride of Jesus Christ she's got
[1:21:57] the fullness of Pentecost in her Amen
[1:22:00] hallelujah so you got the fullness of
[1:22:03] Acts chapter 2 in her Amen
[1:22:05] that's her final fruit because that is
[1:22:07] the latter rain hallelujah oh that makes
[1:22:10] me excited Church to believe I'll be a
[1:22:12] part of that hallelujah the two spirits
[1:22:15] will terminate their manifestation in
[1:22:17] each of their final destinations the
[1:22:21] sowing and watering and growing is all
[1:22:24] over summer's end of the sickle is now
[1:22:27] thrust into the harvest that's speaking
[1:22:29] of course the Tribulation Period after
[1:22:32] the rapture so see now is the time that
[1:22:35] we've got the so now the time that we
[1:22:37] got to be watered by the Holy Spirit now
[1:22:39] is the time we got to grow in the
[1:22:41] presence of God this is the time to do
[1:22:44] it now look at the Prophet says in
[1:22:48] verses 15 to 18 which we have just
[1:22:51] studied lies the true picture of the
[1:22:53] ripe and false vine false spirit false
[1:22:56] church people so brother Adam said this
[1:23:00] scripture here now I don't smaller I had
[1:23:02] to make it smaller to fit on the screen
[1:23:03] but Loran said this is the the full
[1:23:07] mature false church member this is what
[1:23:10] they say when the seeds of nikolay
[1:23:13] tourism and the doctrines of Nikolay
[1:23:15] them and the Jezebel religion and the
[1:23:18] doctrine of balaam when that all comes
[1:23:20] to amateur Antichrist seed of Satan
[1:23:23] church member this is what they say is
[1:23:26] that striking Church in a striking this
[1:23:30] is what a mature serpent seed says
[1:23:32] because this is the false Church now
[1:23:37] they say it down here this is what they
[1:23:39] say but let's read up to it I know that
[1:23:40] works
[1:23:41] thou art neither cold neither hot I
[1:23:44] would not work cold or hot so then
[1:23:46] because thou art lukewarm and neither
[1:23:48] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[1:23:50] mouth
[1:23:50] so Jesus spews out the impersonating
[1:23:53] churches we know that he vomits them out
[1:23:56] it makes him sick to say that their
[1:23:58] Christian churches they can't speak for
[1:24:00] him anymore because they're speaking for
[1:24:02] Satan they're speaking for lusts of the
[1:24:04] flesh instead of speaking the Word of
[1:24:06] God
[1:24:06] now look because thou says so these are
[1:24:11] the words of a mature serpents eat if I
[1:24:13] can say it like that
[1:24:14] isn't that striking when a person
[1:24:18] becomes a mature seed of Satan this is
[1:24:21] what they say because they say I am rich
[1:24:25] this is a mature Antichrist follower I'm
[1:24:29] rich
[1:24:30] so they look at the word the word says
[1:24:32] whatever and they say look at the word
[1:24:33] and say I'm rich I don't care what the
[1:24:37] word says I'm rich look at the word and
[1:24:40] say I've got increased with Goods I
[1:24:42] don't care what the Bible says I've got
[1:24:43] lots of goods
[1:24:44] I've got homes and money and furniture
[1:24:46] I've got I've got all kinds of money
[1:24:48] okay all kinds of goods they look at the
[1:24:51] word of this day look at water baptism
[1:24:53] they look at no women preachers and
[1:24:55] women cutting their hair or shouldn't
[1:24:57] cut their hair look at that and say I
[1:24:58] don't care I'm rich I'm increased with
[1:25:01] Goods they look at the word and say I
[1:25:04] don't have need of nothing they look at
[1:25:07] the word they hear this preaching or
[1:25:08] profit thus saith the Lord's and and
[1:25:11] discernment something's they look at
[1:25:13] that said I don't have need of anything
[1:25:15] that's what
[1:25:16] that's a mature serpent seed understand
[1:25:19] it's the false church they ripen and
[1:25:22] become this in the next few years this
[1:25:25] is what the churches are going to become
[1:25:29] and when they turn down what you and I
[1:25:32] believe and they have these attitudes
[1:25:34] where our church is so big our church is
[1:25:36] rich our church is increased with goods
[1:25:38] our church doesn't need any teaching
[1:25:40] from a small church like yours you see
[1:25:43] what they're saying they're saying oh it
[1:25:46] doesn't matter what the Bible says about
[1:25:47] baptism it doesn't matter what the Bible
[1:25:49] says about the Godhead it doesn't matter
[1:25:51] what the Bible says about your
[1:25:52] appearance and how you dress it doesn't
[1:25:54] God's looking at the heart we preach
[1:25:57] that on Wednesday yes God is going to
[1:25:59] look at the heart and he's going to
[1:26:01] judge your heart by this word amen
[1:26:04] that's exactly right he looks at your
[1:26:06] heart he's going to judge your the
[1:26:08] intense the thoughts and intents of your
[1:26:10] heart by this gospel of Paul amen so
[1:26:14] this is a fruition I just want to
[1:26:16] emphasize that that really struck me as
[1:26:18] I studied the ripe Antichrist fruit is
[1:26:22] this attitude I don't care what the word
[1:26:24] says I'm rich we've got so many big
[1:26:26] churches and big buildings and
[1:26:28] missionary programs we got our own jet
[1:26:30] planes and we've got all this property I
[1:26:32] don't need I don't need the word I don't
[1:26:34] need what you're preaching that is a
[1:26:37] mature Antichrist follower Jesus said
[1:26:43] there's hope though for people that are
[1:26:44] in that system aren't you glad for hope
[1:26:45] he said there there's correction if you
[1:26:48] want to be corrected and if you want to
[1:26:50] be one of my children there's hope for
[1:26:51] you amen
[1:26:53] now before we get to that hope so see
[1:26:56] our character should be totally opposite
[1:26:58] of Laodicea later to see his character
[1:27:01] the much the mature Laodicean is going
[1:27:04] to say I'm rich our church is rich we've
[1:27:06] got increased Goods we don't have need
[1:27:08] of your preaching that's what they're
[1:27:10] gonna say so the church says this my
[1:27:14] works are all right because I'm some new
[1:27:16] quorum sometimes I do what's right I'm
[1:27:18] okay brother Jesse nah I'm not too bad
[1:27:20] you know sometimes I do good things you
[1:27:23] know
[1:27:24] yeah that's an awful thing to say you
[1:27:26] should do good things all the time
[1:27:28] praise God
[1:27:30] if you stop doing good things and do
[1:27:33] evil things you need to get saved
[1:27:36] because they say well sometimes I'm
[1:27:38] lukewarm you know sometimes I'm on fire
[1:27:40] for Jesus sometimes no no I just get
[1:27:42] distracted no I'm human right but you're
[1:27:45] supposed to have a part of divinity in
[1:27:47] you and that's supposed to correct you
[1:27:49] fast to get back off walking in the
[1:27:52] divine Way praise God
[1:27:54] you're supposed to crucify that sin
[1:27:57] daily amen
[1:27:59] but we see the the the mature notice see
[1:28:04] in church remember says well sometimes I
[1:28:06] do good brother yes sir
[1:28:07] sister so and so sometimes I do what's
[1:28:10] right I'm pretty good sometimes Jesus
[1:28:14] wasn't good sometimes
[1:28:15] Jesus was holy all the time Jesus
[1:28:19] remember those notable words he said I
[1:28:21] always do that which pleased the father
[1:28:23] therefore the father loveth me hey there
[1:28:25] glory he loves his son because his son
[1:28:29] always honored his father but see I'm
[1:28:32] mature serpent seed person will say
[1:28:35] sometimes I don't need the preaching I
[1:28:37] don't need that that doctrine I don't
[1:28:40] need your fanaticism in your church I'm
[1:28:43] pretty good most of time well you don't
[1:28:45] sin or you think you're so holy I see
[1:28:48] that this is a mature ripened Laodicean
[1:28:52] church member that's gonna that's going
[1:28:55] to receive the mark of the beast and
[1:28:57] they say I'm rich our church is rich or
[1:28:59] I'm rich personally like we know the
[1:29:01] prosperity movements really big in that
[1:29:03] striking you ever thought about that
[1:29:04] how leão to see us all about am rich and
[1:29:06] increased with Goods and this is the
[1:29:07] greatest age we've ever had a prosperity
[1:29:09] preaching I've ever thought about how
[1:29:11] striking that is it totally fits the
[1:29:14] prophecy for this day
[1:29:16] it totally reveals everything that
[1:29:19] Satan's after Satan's after the lusts of
[1:29:21] the flesh that's what the fall
[1:29:27] shirt says we're rich we've got so much
[1:29:29] giving I'm increased look at all that we
[1:29:31] have look at all though that we can do
[1:29:33] for the kingdom of God we pass out Jesus
[1:29:35] films that's fine we pass out Jesus
[1:29:38] movies that's fine but Jesus has to be
[1:29:40] in you praise God it's better for them
[1:29:43] to see Jesus and you then Jesus on a
[1:29:45] screen amen hallelujah
[1:29:48] right that's right oh I don't have need
[1:29:52] of any are more preaching not the time
[1:29:55] to tote the line at your preaching
[1:29:57] brother Jes you're just a legalist see
[1:30:01] we don't have need of that we have to go
[1:30:03] to all that lengths God loves us God
[1:30:06] receives all of our worship no he
[1:30:08] doesn't he proved that with Cain he
[1:30:10] receives one worship there's one
[1:30:11] provided place of God's worship that's
[1:30:14] always been the way and that's through
[1:30:16] his word so church this is what I hope
[1:30:19] you say this morning we have to be the
[1:30:22] opposite of that because I'm mature a
[1:30:25] mature Laodicean serpent seed person
[1:30:28] that's what they say but a mature Holy
[1:30:31] Ghost filled Saint says this God is
[1:30:33] anointing me constantly to do good works
[1:30:36] as we'll see in Scripture I you should
[1:30:39] say that and I can't wait to do good
[1:30:40] works I am so excited to do something
[1:30:44] good for somebody that's what the Holy
[1:30:47] Ghost for a person says I hope you feel
[1:30:52] that way this morning boy God is
[1:30:55] anointing me to help people that are
[1:30:57] less fortunate than me praise God
[1:31:01] instead of aw I'm rich I only worry
[1:31:04] about myself I've got everything I need
[1:31:07] but see a Holy Ghost filled person once
[1:31:09] they reach out and help somebody else a
[1:31:13] true Holy Ghost filled Church says this
[1:31:16] I may be poor naturally but I'm rich
[1:31:18] spiritually hallelujah because because
[1:31:23] I've been given all spiritual blessings
[1:31:27] do they say we're rich naturally but the
[1:31:30] realtor says we're rich spiritually with
[1:31:33] the Word of God amen the true church
[1:31:38] says I am in need of decreasing the
[1:31:43] number of my Goods right Amen Church
[1:31:49] though worldly Church says oh look at
[1:31:51] all I've got and they they they value it
[1:31:54] so much but the true church does they
[1:31:56] say I need less brother Branham says if
[1:31:58] you want to go up you said you gotta
[1:31:59] unpack he said you're not packing up all
[1:32:02] your possessions that on the rapture he
[1:32:04] said you've got to unpack everything
[1:32:06] like we're talking about the cares of
[1:32:09] the world well I care so much about this
[1:32:10] or I care so much about that we've got
[1:32:13] to care more about going up than staying
[1:32:14] down here because this is what the this
[1:32:18] is what the Serpent's eat churches say
[1:32:20] oh look at all I've got this means so
[1:32:22] much to me and don't get me wrong it's
[1:32:23] sentimental value that belong to your
[1:32:25] grandma your dad or your mom or I
[1:32:27] understand that I've got pictures of my
[1:32:28] parents or grant they mean a lot to me
[1:32:30] but I'm not gonna let that get in the
[1:32:32] way of obeying the Word of God the true
[1:32:38] church says I have need of more of
[1:32:41] Christ's words let's see the foster says
[1:32:44] I don't have need of that I'm rich I've
[1:32:46] got goods aren't we're big of a rich we
[1:32:48] got everything we need we don't need
[1:32:49] more of the word I don't need anything
[1:32:54] and of course they're saying this to
[1:32:57] Jesus Christ
[1:32:57] we don't have need of anything Jesus and
[1:32:59] Jesus is outside of their church trying
[1:33:02] to get in can I come in my man said he
[1:33:05] said he's saying can I come in with the
[1:33:06] Pentecostal blessing oh we have need of
[1:33:12] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:33:13] we have need of all the Holy Ghost
[1:33:16] praise God
[1:33:17] but the foster says we got all the
[1:33:18] spirit we got all the Holy Ghost we want
[1:33:20] we got we've got religion
[1:33:22] we've got money and everything we've got
[1:33:25] everything we don't have need of nothing
[1:33:27] where we need more of God's mercy how
[1:33:30] many would say I need more chastening of
[1:33:32] the Lord I need more rebuking I need I
[1:33:37] need God's guidance to help me walk the
[1:33:40] straight path how many would say that
[1:33:41] but they don't feel like they're like
[1:33:43] well I've just lived so well for so many
[1:33:46] years and yet breaking the Word of God
[1:33:49] they're so desensitized to the
[1:33:52] of God remember the Bible said you could
[1:33:54] have a conscience that seared with an
[1:33:56] iron these people go to church for years
[1:34:00] and years they never hear any real
[1:34:01] preaching of the word and their
[1:34:03] conscience has been seared which means
[1:34:05] the nerve endings aren't they're not
[1:34:06] working anymore there's no feeling there
[1:34:08] you preach the Word of God they don't
[1:34:10] move right like I even remember when
[1:34:16] brother vans Church invited me to preach
[1:34:18] at the youth meetings I preached my
[1:34:20] heart on a preach against sin all I know
[1:34:22] how and just a few people would be moved
[1:34:24] the same thing would happen if I preach
[1:34:26] to the denomination you preach your
[1:34:27] heart out and say this is sin same thing
[1:34:29] happens when I'm preaching messy
[1:34:30] churches you preach if they're not
[1:34:32] careful they get so desensitized to the
[1:34:34] ways of the Holy Spirit I don't have
[1:34:37] need of repent we have constant need of
[1:34:39] repentance amen we have constant need of
[1:34:43] correction what child doesn't praise the
[1:34:46] Lord
[1:34:47] what child of yours what little child of
[1:34:50] yours doesn't need constant correction
[1:34:52] and we are all children of God
[1:34:55] I don't need corrected by my father I'm
[1:34:58] so perfect I'm so holy can you smell the
[1:35:01] pride in that statement and you taste
[1:35:04] the arrogancy in that statement I said
[1:35:07] where the brain calls it later he said
[1:35:09] the pride and arrogance I don't have
[1:35:11] need of that I don't have need of that
[1:35:13] preaching like that I don't have to live
[1:35:14] that look at all I've got God's blessed
[1:35:17] me oh my now let's look at a few
[1:35:23] scriptures well I got through that's the
[1:35:27] wrong one go to James 1:27 let's just
[1:35:30] read this again
[1:35:31] I know we've read it a couple times but
[1:35:35] let's go back over let's just flip
[1:35:45] through your Bible I'm gonna try to
[1:35:46] close here let me give me 15 minutes
[1:35:47] here James 1 not Jude its James 1:27 I
[1:35:54] wrote the wrong scripture this morning
[1:36:00] James 1:27 who'd like to read that for
[1:36:02] me anybody read that for me lid now okay
[1:36:04] okay Malachi and Olivia read the next
[1:36:05] one now okay amen so if you have hot
[1:36:18] works and if we said this earlier
[1:36:20] I just put each one earlier on earlier
[1:36:23] from on a separate slide God has
[1:36:25] anointed me constantly to do good works
[1:36:27] if he's anointing you to do constant
[1:36:30] good works then you are gonna find
[1:36:32] people who are hurting and try to help
[1:36:33] them out that's being on fire for Christ
[1:36:38] leaving your home and visiting people
[1:36:41] who are an affliction that's what the
[1:36:42] Bible says is pure religion and pure of
[1:36:47] course means no defilement like you're
[1:36:49] not I'm not doing this for my benefit
[1:36:51] it's hard for me to travel or I'm busy
[1:36:53] or I could be doing other things right
[1:36:56] but I've got a I'm doing this for their
[1:36:59] sake only because I'm living for others
[1:37:04] this is pure religion and to keep all
[1:37:07] sin off you to keep all to keep your
[1:37:11] shirt clean and white like this one
[1:37:12] gotta keep it white that's when you know
[1:37:16] you're really doing pure works before
[1:37:18] God you're trucking everything you can
[1:37:20] to make sure you're walking the Word of
[1:37:22] God every time you see someone who's
[1:37:24] afflicted you try to help them out right
[1:37:29] but Jesus said I know your works or the
[1:37:31] false church you do some things
[1:37:33] sometimes you're doing good all right
[1:37:35] our work should be good all the time
[1:37:37] we've got to make this it's my constant
[1:37:39] habit to help out people who are hurting
[1:37:44] Titus is going to Titus 2:13 now he just
[1:37:54] talked about the rapture I think we'll
[1:37:57] read it Titus 2:13 Lydia can you reroute
[1:37:59] loud thirteen and fourteen Lydia
[1:38:15] amen so we're looking for Jesus is
[1:38:19] coming and while we're waiting he
[1:38:21] redeemed us to take us away from all sin
[1:38:24] and that would be we would be zealous
[1:38:26] for good works so huh me know right now
[1:38:29] I could just prove through this sermon
[1:38:30] there's two things you got to have zeal
[1:38:32] for zeal to repent when you're wrong and
[1:38:34] zeal to do good works amen if you are
[1:38:37] not passionate about repenting
[1:38:39] something's wrong with your attitude if
[1:38:40] you're not passionate about doing
[1:38:42] something good to help out somebody
[1:38:44] who's an affliction you're in need of
[1:38:47] prayer right you have got a Laodicean
[1:38:50] lukewarm attitude and you gotta get that
[1:38:52] attitude off and get the anointing of
[1:38:53] God on you because I can prove out of
[1:38:56] the Bible that from this sermon two
[1:38:58] things you need to be zealous about
[1:38:59] repenting when you're wrong getting
[1:39:01] right and then doing good works for
[1:39:03] people I can prove that by the scripture
[1:39:08] that's why it's so sad people are so
[1:39:10] zealous I like I was talking to the
[1:39:12] teacher on Tuesday at the middle school
[1:39:15] she used to work at arrow and now she
[1:39:16] works at the mill school she said Jessie
[1:39:18] how do you do this how do you do to
[1:39:19] Bible clubs and preach three times a
[1:39:21] week and do a teacher I just looked at
[1:39:23] her and write her super why I said I
[1:39:24] don't watch sports she's like oh yes you
[1:39:28] have all that time she's like you have
[1:39:30] six kids how do y'all do this I said
[1:39:32] well we don't we don't invest in worldly
[1:39:34] things like that and she's like yeah I
[1:39:35] always do that I don't watch TV there
[1:39:37] you know how do you do that you have to
[1:39:40] be zealous over God's works and you have
[1:39:44] to reject the works of the world and do
[1:39:46] what God wants you to do
[1:39:47] I got a zeal for that so that's what I
[1:39:49] do we need to have a zeal for helping
[1:39:53] out other people a zeal to repent when
[1:39:55] we come to church in here we're wrong or
[1:39:57] just listening to the Bible at your home
[1:39:59] you know you have to have a zeal to say
[1:40:01] I'm sorry will you forgive me so this is
[1:40:05] what the true church says they've got
[1:40:08] real hot works they want to help out
[1:40:12] people who are afflicted and if you
[1:40:13] wanna know people that are afflicted let
[1:40:14] me know I know if you want to help
[1:40:15] people with just with a few groceries
[1:40:17] let me know I know I'm gonna go drop
[1:40:19] some off today to a few people if you
[1:40:22] want to know people that need help will
[1:40:23] ask me but we need to be zealous
[1:40:27] do good works don't always have to be
[1:40:29] money it can be something else right
[1:40:30] helping people with your time or if
[1:40:32] you're a mechanic you fix their car form
[1:40:34] you know just give good works to people
[1:40:37] in affliction that's what the true
[1:40:39] church does now the true church says I'm
[1:40:42] poor naturally but I'm rich spiritually
[1:40:44] I've been given all spiritual blessings
[1:40:48] now that's Ephesians 1:13 he's blessed
[1:40:51] us with all spiritual blessings 2nd
[1:40:54] Peter 1 verse 3s about the Statue
[1:40:56] preferred man and the Bible said he's
[1:40:58] given us all divine promises amen
[1:41:01] that we can partake of all the divine
[1:41:04] nature of God every promise is given to
[1:41:07] us if you need peace brother
[1:41:09] he's got peace sister if you need joy
[1:41:12] he's got joy amen
[1:41:14] it whatever we have Nino would ever
[1:41:17] promise that we need he's offered all of
[1:41:20] it to us amen Romans 8:32 the Bible said
[1:41:26] shall he not give us freely all things
[1:41:28] if he spared not his own son if God
[1:41:31] wouldn't hold back his son and would
[1:41:33] give his son but the Bible said how much
[1:41:35] more will he freely give us all things
[1:41:37] but we got to ask and we got to believe
[1:41:39] we got to obey right we got to so the
[1:41:43] right things and we'll reap the right
[1:41:44] things right church so that's what the
[1:41:50] real church says I might be poor
[1:41:51] naturally I don't have everything I want
[1:41:52] naturally but one thing I've got I've
[1:41:54] got spiritual riches Oh glory I'm in
[1:42:00] need of decreasing my goods now first
[1:42:02] Timothy 6:17 says you cannot take
[1:42:05] anything with you you will take nothing
[1:42:08] with you much as I love my ring as much
[1:42:11] as I appreciate my glasses I'm not
[1:42:13] taking them with me right so we need to
[1:42:18] be able to have less jesus said in
[1:42:22] matthew 6:19 don't lay up your treasures
[1:42:24] on earth don't have more things on earth
[1:42:26] where moth and dust corrupt and destroy
[1:42:28] he said but lay up yourselves treasures
[1:42:31] in heaven we need to get more treasure
[1:42:34] in heaven we have to have more property
[1:42:36] in heaven we've got to have memorials in
[1:42:38] heaven praise God
[1:42:41] you know they got the Korean memorial
[1:42:44] they got the Lincoln Memorial the
[1:42:45] Washington Memorial Cornelius had a
[1:42:48] memorial fasting in heaven amen
[1:42:51] there is a memorial of the fasting
[1:42:54] corniest it in heaven ha ha I knew you I
[1:42:56] can you imagine walking down the streets
[1:42:58] ago
[1:42:58] there's memorial to Cornelius hallelujah
[1:43:01] now I'm not saying it's like that but
[1:43:03] I'm trying to give you a picture we go
[1:43:05] to Washington you see we see the
[1:43:06] Washington Monument the Lincoln Memorial
[1:43:08] I haven't seen it but I'd like to you
[1:43:11] understand but in heaven there is
[1:43:12] memorials where people have fasted
[1:43:15] prayed given alms they've done the
[1:43:17] things of God and heaven remembers it we
[1:43:19] need more possessions in heaven than we
[1:43:21] need them we have on earth amen go to
[1:43:25] Psalms 9012 let's read that one they
[1:43:29] would like to read that for me Psalms 98
[1:43:30] Malka Psalms 9012 all right so I've just
[1:43:44] felt burdened because I feel the effects
[1:43:47] of literacy on my life I start worrying
[1:43:50] about this and worried about that
[1:43:52] financially and worrying about this
[1:43:53] we're in about the giving in the church
[1:43:55] worrying about how much money I'm making
[1:43:57] it work and I remember I've got to
[1:43:59] overcome that too
[1:44:01] I've worried about the uncertainties
[1:44:03] what if this happens or with this
[1:44:05] happens with the church what half of how
[1:44:07] we gonna do this and how we're gonna do
[1:44:08] that and I'm constantly living under
[1:44:10] this too.we I've got to overcome that
[1:44:12] I've got I got to be rich in spiritual
[1:44:14] blessings I've got to be rich in the
[1:44:15] promises of God amen
[1:44:18] I've got to cast it down myself just
[1:44:20] like all of us have to cast it down
[1:44:22] Psalms 9012 Malachi amen
[1:44:31] I only have so many days left right you
[1:44:35] only have so many days left teach us to
[1:44:37] number our days if I live a long life
[1:44:40] like I said I'm 37 five a long life
[1:44:42] maybe I got 40 50 more years but I
[1:44:45] should live my life like I've only got a
[1:44:47] number of limited number of days and not
[1:44:49] be so concerned about the natural things
[1:44:51] the natural goods but about spiritual
[1:44:54] goods
[1:44:55] that's what wisdom does it teaches us
[1:44:57] the number of your days realize your
[1:44:59] days are limited so make the most of
[1:45:02] those days don't be concerned about
[1:45:03] treasures on earth be concerned about
[1:45:05] treasures in heaven the true Church says
[1:45:09] I have need of more Christ's words Jesus
[1:45:11] said blessed are they that hunger and
[1:45:13] thirst for righteousness we've got to
[1:45:15] come to church hungry we've got to come
[1:45:17] to church thirsty and the Bible said we
[1:45:19] got to gather more's we see that Day
[1:45:21] approaching and we get a little
[1:45:22] discouragement the Bible says in acts 4
[1:45:24] we've got a crowd have a prayer meeting
[1:45:26] say give me boldness
[1:45:27] I've lost my boldness restore my bonus
[1:45:30] for Christ amen
[1:45:31] I thought the early church did who had
[1:45:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost make me
[1:45:36] more bold give me back my first love
[1:45:39] help me to be more bold for Christ how
[1:45:42] many want to be more bold for Christ
[1:45:44] this is what the true church says the
[1:45:46] foster says I don't need more of God I'm
[1:45:48] good I'm coasting I'm I'm I'm too
[1:45:51] blessed to be stressed it depends how
[1:45:54] you apply that depends what your life is
[1:45:57] like so we should say the following we
[1:46:03] should we should say I'm content being
[1:46:06] poor if we're not rich naturally and yet
[1:46:09] having my daily necessities the Bible
[1:46:11] says as long as I've got food in food
[1:46:13] and clothing the Bible says I should be
[1:46:15] content but the true church like I have
[1:46:18] more worldly goods and I'm more we need
[1:46:22] to say I need less worldly goods I need
[1:46:25] more of the word in my life
[1:46:27] praise the Lord look what Jesus looking
[1:46:30] brother him says next after Jesus
[1:46:32] rebukes them he tells of the three
[1:46:35] things they need and we're gonna get to
[1:46:36] that hopefully he says no words ever
[1:46:39] spelled out a more bitter denunciation
[1:46:42] that means a rebuke there was never a
[1:46:45] more bitter judgment in the whole Bible
[1:46:47] than this right here and no proud and
[1:46:50] arrogant religious people ever deserved
[1:46:52] it more I couldn't find the quote my
[1:46:54] brother Adam said why this is so brother
[1:46:57] Ram said Christians the days of Ephesus
[1:46:58] had to die for their faith they had all
[1:47:01] kinds of persecutions and they were
[1:47:05] really rugged Christians but brother
[1:47:06] never said now in our day
[1:47:08] we have so many riches that there's
[1:47:10] really no excuse not to that there's no
[1:47:13] really fear there's no like there's no
[1:47:15] one there saying I'm gonna kill you if
[1:47:17] you don't obey or if you say you or love
[1:47:19] Jesus and so instead of the fear of
[1:47:24] persecution
[1:47:25] it's the temptation of riches that's why
[1:47:30] these people I think it's a note that
[1:47:32] not 1965 or the brand tells us that
[1:47:34] that's why the rebuke is so great they
[1:47:37] don't even have any real battles this
[1:47:39] this economy that's not a real battle
[1:47:42] compared to you know life or death for
[1:47:44] just saying you're a Christian so nobody
[1:47:47] deserves a more bitter rebuke than this
[1:47:49] age because they had no real battles to
[1:47:51] fight compared to the physical battles
[1:47:54] that they fought in the earlier days
[1:47:58] what do you have to battle brother Jeff
[1:48:00] I had to battle the temptation to be
[1:48:01] rich had to battle you know money I had
[1:48:07] to battle some drugs and overcome drugs
[1:48:09] and you go to the early church what you
[1:48:12] have to battle steaks knives swords
[1:48:15] being burned at a stake and this is why
[1:48:20] Jesus gives them the most hardest rebuke
[1:48:22] your life was so easy you had really no
[1:48:25] excuses but you chose to love the things
[1:48:29] of the world when there was really no
[1:48:31] real battle there I know the deception
[1:48:33] is greater than this day I know that but
[1:48:36] also at the same time there's no real
[1:48:37] physical persecution or pain for most
[1:48:40] people in this day and so Jesus gives
[1:48:43] the most bitter denunciation to this
[1:48:45] group by now let's go to clean
[1:48:54] 7:25 what a parallel we see in
[1:48:56] Ecclesiastes 725 with the latest in
[1:49:01] Church H this just came to me as I
[1:49:04] studied I just felt it was the Holy
[1:49:05] Spirit picking up that word bitter when
[1:49:07] I read that word bitter this morning my
[1:49:08] mind went immediately went to could easy
[1:49:10] a c7 please a c7 25y I'm really part me
[1:49:19] okay are you talking to me I got a few
[1:49:23] minutes left here my I want to go please
[1:49:33] ya see 725 I just felt directed here I
[1:49:37] applied my heart to know and to search
[1:49:39] and to seek out wisdom and the reason of
[1:49:41] things and to know the wickedness of
[1:49:43] folly even of foolishness and madness so
[1:49:46] he want to know he won't know all about
[1:49:48] wickedness he went to all doubt
[1:49:49] foolishness craziness what is this all
[1:49:51] about in verse 26 and I find more bitter
[1:49:55] than death the woman whose heart is
[1:50:00] snares and nets and her hands as bands
[1:50:02] whoso pleases God shall escape her but
[1:50:04] the sinner shall be taken by her behold
[1:50:07] this have I found say at the preacher
[1:50:08] counting one by one to find out the
[1:50:10] account which yet my soul seeketh but I
[1:50:13] find not one man among a thousand have I
[1:50:15] found but a woman among all those have I
[1:50:17] not found though this only have I found
[1:50:21] that God has made man upright but they
[1:50:23] have sought out many inventions can you
[1:50:26] see the parallel program said no no age
[1:50:29] ever does it deserve a more bitter
[1:50:31] denunciation and then Solomon says
[1:50:33] there's nothing more bitter than a woman
[1:50:36] who in snares you can everybody see this
[1:50:39] how the natural woman of Ecclesiastes
[1:50:41] types of spiritual woman can you see how
[1:50:43] it types out because the woman her heart
[1:50:46] is strongholds or addictions or traps
[1:50:50] the woman in the psalmist talking about
[1:50:52] gets you trapped in a situation gets you
[1:50:54] addicted in a certain situation and her
[1:50:57] hands or bars or prison bars I mean oh
[1:50:59] brother Ram said the churches are like
[1:51:00] cages of unclean birds well the Bible
[1:51:03] says that they're like Eagles he said
[1:51:06] there's Eagles trapped in those cave
[1:51:09] we got to go and let the Eagles fly
[1:51:11] praise God but see the woman the bitter
[1:51:14] woman she traps him in there he realized
[1:51:17] that all these megachurches are just
[1:51:18] cages they're prison doors remember
[1:51:21] brother never had the dream he said all
[1:51:23] these church members saying deliver us
[1:51:24] brother brand they're behind the doors
[1:51:26] remember that there were just church
[1:51:27] members and he said house and he'll give
[1:51:30] away to the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:51:33] that's what they were lacking they have
[1:51:34] Father Son Holy Ghost and that's what I
[1:51:37] put my book that was my testimony I can
[1:51:39] never overcome any addictions until I
[1:51:42] came to the message of the hour
[1:51:43] day man because I was imprisoned by that
[1:51:47] bitter denominational woman because she
[1:51:50] wouldn't preach the Word of God is going
[1:51:52] to keep me in her system or you'll make
[1:51:54] a good Luther Luther and preacher they
[1:51:56] told me that's what they told me you'd
[1:51:58] be a real good Lutheran preacher I said
[1:51:59] I don't want to be a Luther and preacher
[1:52:00] I want to be a Holy Ghost field preacher
[1:52:03] Amen but see that woman system traps you
[1:52:07] in there and there's nothing more bitter
[1:52:09] than a woman that traps with her snares
[1:52:13] she she's controlling right a man in
[1:52:16] this case the church controls the people
[1:52:20] we must escape her naturally and
[1:52:23] spiritually and notice men will just run
[1:52:25] after their own inventions oh just got
[1:52:27] their own devices and and worldly things
[1:52:30] wit worldly pleasures now I hope you can
[1:52:38] see that and there's nothing more bitter
[1:52:40] than a woman that snares and in traps
[1:52:43] and traps a man into sin and it's a
[1:52:48] perfect type of the church today
[1:52:50] Laodicea has trap people in it with all
[1:52:52] of its trappings right or you can still
[1:52:55] go to movies you can still smoke you can
[1:52:57] have social wine you can have all these
[1:52:59] things and they're trapped by the lust
[1:53:01] of the flesh that's right I got two more
[1:53:04] slides here let me finish up with two
[1:53:05] more slides first Timothy 6:6 let's go
[1:53:08] there and now that connects now that we
[1:53:11] have more bitter
[1:53:12] there's no bitter denunciation for the
[1:53:14] woman there's no bitter
[1:53:17] there's no bitter woman than a woman who
[1:53:19] traps you in addictions and
[1:53:21] how the Bible said riches are snares so
[1:53:25] a woman who has snares is also a rich
[1:53:27] woman just like the rich churches today
[1:53:31] first Timothy 6 6 through 12
[1:53:35] so to me the church that's a that's a
[1:53:37] chain of truth that cannot be broken
[1:53:40] that's a truth that from the scripture I
[1:53:42] know I'm going a little longer here just
[1:53:44] bear with me here
[1:53:46] first Timothy 6:6 but godliness with
[1:53:49] contentment is great gain for we brought
[1:53:52] nothing into this world and is certain
[1:53:53] we can carry nothing out and having food
[1:53:56] and raiment let us dare be with content
[1:53:58] but they which be rich fall into
[1:54:00] temptation and a snare there's a snare
[1:54:03] see the woman who has snares remember
[1:54:05] that she's more bitter than death and
[1:54:07] now the Bible said riches are a snare so
[1:54:10] see there's nothing more evil than a
[1:54:12] rich woman right evil woman in this case
[1:54:16] a rich church there's nothing more evil
[1:54:18] than a rich church oh I hope everybody
[1:54:21] can see that it's right there Elaine in
[1:54:24] the scripture for us the snares of
[1:54:27] riches it says and they into a snare and
[1:54:32] into many foolish and hurtful lusts
[1:54:33] which drown men in destruction and
[1:54:35] perdition for the love of money is the
[1:54:39] root of all evil which while some
[1:54:40] coveted after they have erred from the
[1:54:42] faith and pierced themselves through
[1:54:43] with many sorrows but Thou O man of God
[1:54:46] flee these things and follow after
[1:54:47] righteousness godliness faith love
[1:54:49] patience and meekness now we don't have
[1:54:56] time to go there but what did Solomon
[1:54:57] get ensnared with riches rich he has so
[1:55:01] rich and the women right the rich women
[1:55:04] from other countries he got ensnared
[1:55:06] with rich women and it kept him from
[1:55:10] giving a hundred percent to the Lord I
[1:55:12] don't want to give 50 and be lukewarm I
[1:55:15] don't want to look down in my life and
[1:55:17] say well half of my schedule looks like
[1:55:19] it glorifies Christ half of my free time
[1:55:22] looks like it's glorifying Christ I want
[1:55:24] a hundred percent of my life
[1:55:26] to glorify Christ Salman couldn't say
[1:55:28] that then of his life he got away no
[1:55:30] longer was it a hundred percent was in
[1:55:32] the word that's maybe 50 40
[1:55:37] last one it's gonna look 20 let's say on
[1:55:39] our feet here I'll closer this one
[1:55:41] Luke 2045 I was just looking at this
[1:55:45] yesterday with the myth the widow and
[1:55:46] her two mites Luke 2045 I just want to
[1:56:03] remind us of this Scripture this is
[1:56:04] really beautiful Scripture Luke 2045
[1:56:08] then in the audience of all the people
[1:56:10] he began I'm sorry he said unto the
[1:56:12] disciples beware of the scribes which
[1:56:13] desire to walk in long robes and love
[1:56:16] greetings in the markets and the highest
[1:56:18] seats of the synagogues and the chief
[1:56:20] rooms at feasts which devour widows
[1:56:23] houses and for a shoe make long prayers
[1:56:28] the same shall receive greater damnation
[1:56:31] so who gets the worst judgment on the
[1:56:34] day of judgment those who claim to be
[1:56:36] Christians or believers and we're not so
[1:56:41] the false church right the Bible says
[1:56:44] nobody gets a more harsh judgment in the
[1:56:47] book of James than preachers who are
[1:56:49] corrupt now Jesus saying this in a big
[1:56:54] crowd so they all hearing what he's
[1:56:55] saying right and then look at verse 21
[1:56:58] and he looked up and he saw the rich man
[1:57:01] casting their gifts in the Treasury
[1:57:04] remember rich and increased with Goods I
[1:57:06] don't need nothing and he also saw a
[1:57:10] certain poor Widow casting in thither
[1:57:12] two mites two mites and that day was 3/8
[1:57:15] of one penny I don't know what that
[1:57:17] equals to us but it's probably really
[1:57:19] small I don't know two mites
[1:57:23] she gave her two pieces or two mites 3/8
[1:57:27] of an Israel cent and he said of a truth
[1:57:32] I say unto you that this poor Widow hath
[1:57:34] cast and more than they all this is
[1:57:39] quite a thought for all these have of
[1:57:42] their abundance cast in unto the
[1:57:44] offerings of God but she of her penury
[1:57:47] hath cast in all the living that
[1:57:49] you had who got the greater reward on
[1:57:51] the day of judgment or who's gonna get
[1:57:53] the greatest reward the wood the widow
[1:57:55] woman in heaven she gave more than what
[1:57:59] the rich Pharisees gave because we know
[1:58:02] they just did it for show and they're
[1:58:04] going to be judged and they have no
[1:58:06] treasure in heaven but here's a sincere
[1:58:08] woman and this whole time Jesus stands
[1:58:11] there and watches her he said hey watch
[1:58:13] this woman he doesn't rush up but ma'am
[1:58:16] said you and I would have rushed up and
[1:58:17] stopped her from giving oh no sister you
[1:58:19] just keep that that's what brother
[1:58:20] Branham said just just keep that oh it's
[1:58:24] okay
[1:58:25] but Jesus lets her give her 3/8 of a
[1:58:29] penny to the kingdom of God and look she
[1:58:32] even gave it to the false church system
[1:58:36] but because she did it in sincerity
[1:58:38] because she did it to glorify God then
[1:58:42] we know these things are true jesus knew
[1:58:45] the laws of God would go to work for her
[1:58:48] right the treasure were these the
[1:58:52] Treasury were these chess or boxes
[1:58:54] outside of the the woman's court at the
[1:58:56] temple according to Josephus and the the
[1:59:00] the believers put in contributions
[1:59:03] whether voluntary or they're paid year
[1:59:05] lead ties and offerings they had to give
[1:59:07] so Jesus watch all the rich guys pour in
[1:59:10] there and a woman walks drops tink tink
[1:59:12] these guys are dropping off and it's
[1:59:14] clang clang clang ching ching ching
[1:59:16] ching ching and they're thinking all man
[1:59:18] look at my money in heaven's own way up
[1:59:20] my bank account and yet they're serpents
[1:59:23] but a real humble woman walks up there
[1:59:26] she's not increased with goods she has
[1:59:29] need a more of God but yet she's still
[1:59:31] willing to give her part to God and
[1:59:33] Jesus lets her because she knows or he
[1:59:37] knows the law of gods or is going to
[1:59:39] operate for the woman widows were the
[1:59:42] worst off in the Middle Eastern country
[1:59:44] as far as economics now that's Josephus
[1:59:49] history on the Treasury look when it
[1:59:50] says widows are associated with weeping
[1:59:53] mourning and desolation that these are
[1:59:55] the words that describe her experience
[1:59:58] here's a woman that's weeping all the
[2:00:00] time she's desolate she's and yet she
[2:00:03] still
[2:00:03] got enough grace to go to church and
[2:00:04] drop off a few mites poverty and
[2:00:09] indebtedness always follow widows
[2:00:11] because they had no source of income if
[2:00:14] they had no husband widows were
[2:00:21] frequently placed alongside orphans and
[2:00:24] landless immigrants homeless so you
[2:00:28] would place a widow with a homeless
[2:00:30] person and an orphan who had no family
[2:00:32] that's how bad off she was yet she still
[2:00:35] walks out there and say I want to do
[2:00:36] something for God I can't do much for
[2:00:39] God but I'm gonna give everything I got
[2:00:42] to God and who gave more who have
[2:00:47] rhetoric rewards in heaven
[2:00:48] the widow woman will have rewards in
[2:00:53] that striking the Bible says all's we
[2:00:56] must do is seek first the kingdom of God
[2:01:00] don't don't worry about tomorrow search
[2:01:02] what we're gonna eat what we're gonna
[2:01:03] drink we're gonna put on the Gentiles
[2:01:09] are gonna seek after that they're gonna
[2:01:10] but so much thought what they eat and
[2:01:11] drink and wear but your heavenly Father
[2:01:14] knows that you have need of all these
[2:01:15] things but seek ye first the kingdom of
[2:01:20] God and His righteousness and all these
[2:01:23] things shall be added unto you take
[2:01:26] therefore no thought for the morrow for
[2:01:27] the morrow shall take thought for the
[2:01:28] things of itself sufficient unto the day
[2:01:31] is the evil thereof don't worry about
[2:01:33] tomorrow just say God I need you with me
[2:01:35] right now I'm gonna say that Lord help
[2:01:38] me just to realize that I need you with
[2:01:39] me right now and help me to give you
[2:01:41] what I have right now
[2:01:42] that's just bow our heads in word of
[2:01:44] Prayer Lloris you can come to the piano

[2:02:16] savor unto God and today we see a woman
