before leaving Earth Lord God we're so grateful let the holy spirit that wrote this word come and back this word up God we pray speak to our hearts and lives today we ask it Jesus this is your

anoint your people here tonight we're gathered for the glory of Jesus Christ we ask all these Blessings In The Name of Christ Our Lord the Saints said amen praise God let's take our Bibles here let's go to Acts chapter 5 I'd like to continue on the series on Supernatural book of Acts Church Acts chapter 5 verse one we'll read verses one two and three here tonight by God's grace Acts chapter 5 you know we've seen in the first few chapters you know numerous manifestations we've seen notable Miracles we saw the not notable Miracle there in chapter three with the the paralyzed man walking instantly receiving his ankle strength there strength in his bones Hallelujah we the the greatest Miracle is 3,000 Souls saved on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah chapter one had a rushing Mighty Wind Hallelujah uh I'm sorry fire fire and wind in chapter two as well by God's grace on the day of Pentecost I think I got not chapter one but chapter two chapter one had the unity of prayer Hallelujah praying together being together for 10 days imagine that 10 days with the Saints to get in one Accord and then the fire the wind the testimonies just wonderful super Supernatural works here by the grace of God Acts chapter 5 verse one it's very course Very uh sobering chapter you know I guess you know I was trying to preach a sober message on the Sunday evening there you know with the recent current events and this is a very sober chapter here as well the grace of the Lord Acts chapter 5 verse one I'll read verse one and two and then we can read verse three together here but a certain man named ananas with safire his wife sold a possession and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet but Peter said ananas I'm sorry I'm sorry let's read verse four three together ready one two three but Peter said ananas why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land amen may God add his Blessing to the read of his word you may be seated praise God very sobering text here watch the time by God's grace Andy for my sake sobering uh topic you know as we mentioned on Sunday night with death anytime death is involved it's a very sobering topic and so here we find in the early church uh this is the first moment we'd say of death in the church and so here we see uh this of course follows chapter 4 uh the Bible said in verse 30 three that the apostles were given great power and witness of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and great grace was upon them all notice that great fear and great grace remember church this is what God wants to restore in our church hallelujah we're restoring we're going back we're the Omega here's the alpha so we got to pattern our Our Lives after the book of Acts Hallelujah we've been doing it since we come in the message you know wife and I been doing that since you know about 2001 end of 20012 2002 so here we are about 21 years trying to pattern Our Lives after the book of Acts praise God it's been a tremendous experience if I can use that word from the song Our God is tremendous amen it's been tremendous because of where we came from we know where we came from and we're thankful where we are right now praise God we can clearly see that our desire is to be like the book of Acts church and notice in verse 34 chapter 4 uh neither was there any of them that lacked because the people that owned houses or possessions or lands maybe extra they went and sold it in order to feed all these poor Christians okay because there was 3,000 remember the Bible said that God added daily so this was a church you know multiplying multiplying um and so they needed food I love this God already had it prepared God always has everything we need already prepared of hallelujah it's already taken care of Amen so when there's a need you know God will raise up somebody to take care of that need it's already taken care of praise God just like with brother brandham you know he had the IRS case what what do you have to pay back I think it was 50,000 or 40,000 he's like how can I ever do this well God already had millionaires in the church to pay for it I don't know if brother could ever pay them back or not I don't think he did but God already had it provided praise God if the devil pulls a scheme against you God's going to bail you out praise God God knows God had to allow in the first place right so God knew all about it Hallelujah and it was an unjust thing but God bailed out brother brandham Hallelujah because brother Bram did nothing wrong uh but here we see that God already had Believers that had lands and possessions and gladly sold them just to give the people food shelter or clothing just to put clothes on the backs of the Christians praise God and they just laid the money at the apostles feet praise God and then but we see that here we see uh uh these Believers now socalled Believers right they weren't really Believers and the the point of that is because the the Bible said Peter said Satan filled their heart that's very specific language that's the same language for Judas scariot Satan filled their hearts their hearts were not filled with the Holy Ghost aren't you glad your heart is filled with God's spirit amen hallelujah praise God Amen aren't you glad Hallelujah but see anti and of fire they were make believers they were just like Judas right they were just like Judas because they were hanging around and remember you know this is this is very deep teaching here I'm going to just just rehearse some deep teaching here people's names can be blotted off the book of life before they're born again right so in other words somebody could be saved but then they could sell that out like Judas right the Bible said his name was on uh the book Jesus said don't Rejoice because you can cast out Devils Rejoice because your names are in heaven but Jesus said if you don't serve God he said I'll blot your name off if you don't overcome I'll blot your name out so we know that's what happened with Judas right none of the disciples knew the the the the thief's heart that was in his heart right none of them knew that he hid that from everybody but he couldn't hit it hide it from God Allelujah because Jesus searches constantly the hearts of the Believers he searches the Reigns of our hearts and so that's a very deep teaching some people say well uh they they take the calvinistic side you know if you're saved there's nothing you can ever do to lose it that's wrong right but then some take the Armenian side you know you can be filled with the Holy Ghost and then be lost no that's not true either the truth is once you're sealed with the Holy Ghost then there's no way you can lose salvation praise God and even for foolish virgins once they're saved they're always saved they can't they can't get saved and then get lost and get saved and get lost they're always saved they Jes Jesus said they've already passed from Death un life and Jesus has the for knowledge that they will never sell it out praise God so it all depends on your perspective is it man's perspective or is it God's perspective even for the foolish virgin God's perspective is they were always saved they were always my Remnant they could not never be lost hallelujah amen but it's those make Believers that they can go through the acts of being saved and they can be forgiven but then they can sell it out and we saw many examples you know like we have Judas okay we have balum and there's other examples I can't think of right now but I made a video on it and we could maybe watch that time but the point is here that this these two are definitely of the Judas es scariot and notice what caused it again money see church we got to be real careful with money right they lied about their money and we'll look at this here in just a moment but look so what got Judas money got Judas think about that he saw Jesus multiply the fish and but he was but he was he knew God could do great things but he got so caught up in what money he had right he saw Jesus Jesus could multiply all these things if Jesus can multiply all that can he multiply what I have need of right but he got so caught up that he sold out Christ and he even LED them to arrest him right he he was he led them to persecute Jesus he led them to that but a real child of God wouldn't do that praise God now look but look a real child of God will they sometimes deny Christ like Peter they might but they'll always come back they'll always repent no matter how long it takes they'll come back because they are genuine predestinated child of God hallelujah amen like I had a gentleman I'm not going to name his name but there's a gentleman and he's emailed me over the years and he he was the one that was weeping when I made that video about 25 acts that you can labor for the Lord and will bless it he said I was raised in the message I just got the email this week he said and everybody when I was growing up told me I had gifts of the holy spirit maybe it was preacher I don't know what it was some type of gift but then he said uh he backs he said I now I have all these Wasted Years and he said but now I've come back to God and but my family seen me waste all these years I walked away from the message and he said without God's help I'll never be able to repair my family situation now Church think about how God has blessed some of us where we don't have those situations he don't know if his wife or children could ever forgive him for the evils that he did but he's come back to God and he wants to serve God and he wanted to know you know if I have a gift will God use me I said absolutely I said God God could use Paul when Paul hold the he held the coats of the men that murdered Stephen if God could use Paul and how did God use Paul Paul said it wasn't me it was the grace of God that was in me amen hallelujah I said yes you always have those memories you always have that guilt but use that as motivation God looked past all my my mistakes God brought me back even though I made those mistakes and so I'm going to use that as motivation I'll never do that again hallelujah amen I haven't heard back from him I'm hoping to get a good email back from him I've told that to people before you got to use your mistakes as motivation remember the Revenge sermon we did a few weeks ago you got to make any failures you got to use that and and say I'm gonna take revenge on that I won't do it again by God's grace Hallelujah see the child of God will always come back to God remember brother man you know that woman that ran up to him on the current of time R said oh she said my precious brother he said I don't even know who she was and the voice said brother ra you baptized her when she was past 90 amen she said if you wouldn't have went I would not have been here see God has a predestinated plan for every Ministry praise God see think about that a 90y old you know let's not give up let's keep trusting God let's keep praying to God let's see what God will do Hallelujah if they're predestinated they'll be there and if they're predestinated for you you'll have some part in it praise God you'll be either praying for it or you'll be involved with it praise God Amen but see these were the Judas es scariot so they sold a certain amount you know they saw the Believers doing that and look it's all say Judas is always trying to imitate just like Cain Cain was trying to imitate the real worshipper but they can't do it the right way see they they did it they did it the wrong way they came and laid it at the apostles feet and said let's say they sold it for 10,000 but really they sold it for 20,000 they kept back part of the price and laid it at the apostles feet and they had a greed let's lie to the man of God let's lie to the church in other words but Peter and now notice here's the next gift we see and this is a powerful gift it's called discernment now maybe this was Vision as well we don't know for sure we're not told if he had we know Peter was a prophet no doubt about that just read the book of H first Peter and second Peter especially second Peter chapter 3 where it speaks of the day of fervent heat no doubt he's a prophet but we're not told all we know is somehow he judges the spirit and says no you didn't sell for that amount he says you've lied to the Holy Ghost and verse four and while remain was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not thine own power it was yours the whole time why hast thou to conceive this thing in thine heart thou not lied unto men but unto God see they were not lying to Peter they were lying to God but they lied to God's Representatives they lied to God's children so it was if they were lying to God didn't Jesus say when you've done it unto me you've done it to the least of these my brethren amen hallelujah when people mistreat you they're not mistreating you really they're mistreating Christ but when people bless you they're blessing Jesus amen same thing hallelujah oh my and ananas hearing these words fell down and gave up The Ghost and great fear Came Upon all them that heard these things now last night in our Bible time we just read about Lev uh now he was faithful at the beginning but I think he got off at the end that's just my humble opinion anyways he was in that meeting brother R's meeting where a young man and woman came and sitting on the front row and they were kissing and hugging all over in front of everybody and brother Lee said he was right there he said I think he said that was the most nervous he'd ever been in his life because he felt the the he felt the Holiness of God against this couple kind of kissing and slopping all over each other and brother Ram tells the testimony later brother raham says uh speak whatever you desire the holy spirit says speak whatever you speak it'll be brother could have judged them and what would happened they would have died or brother ramam could have mercy and it's on the tape brother raham says I give you your lives and they have mercy and brother level said that was the most uh hardest I ever prayed in my whole life that God would show Mercy on these people see a real child of God they don't have Vengeance in their heart they don't want to see bad things happen to people they want to see people repent praise God now look brother Ram was given the same power that Peter had right here why had the same baptism amen hallelujah had the same Doctrine Hallelujah the same word amen same power Hallelujah he spoke to Little Fish and the fish's life came back Hallelujah he spoke to little posum and the mother posum was well hallelujah amen hallelujah same God same word same power hallelujah amen it's the same same gospel like we said last week and this you know Malachi also actually brought up last night this reminds us of Elisha with the she Bears was it 42 children I think 42 children lost their lives now we don't know if that like brother said was that just Elisha being angry or was that one of these Peter moments right so we don't know but here Peter clearly has a a case where he's got life and death in his power but Church what's interesting look at the grace of God and hopefully this makes somebody say Amen here look at the grace of God it wasn't long before this Peter lied three times about Christ I don't know him I don't know him I've only lived with them for three and a half years I don't know the man I've only walked on water I've only cast out Devils I've only preached for him for all these things I don't know the man and yet God didn't strike him down what is that that's Divine Mercy amen that's for knowledge amen hallelujah that's God's Sovereign will in other words God knew Peter would repent of it praise God but apparently ananas and Z fire would never repent of it just like Judas instead of Judas going back and saying Jesus forgive me I'm sorry he would and hung himself see it's got to be predestination here's a man that lied not long ago but then he says that these people lied to the Holy Ghost and they die not him him that is the grace of God if I've ever seen it what about Sarah lied right to God's face God said no you did laughe no you did laugh Sarah brother man tells us God couldn't strike her because she's part of Abraham she's part of the promise and see Peter was a part of Christ amen but don't don't forget you're a part of Christ too hallelujah amen because when you make mistakes when I make mistakes what do we do we come back to Jesus Hallelujah try me again amen forgive me again I want to serve you that wasn't the real me like Lena was telling us Lena says she loves that Romans 7 scripture it's not I that sin it's the sin that dwells within me praise God the things that I want to do I don't do sometimes the things that I I don't want to do things I hate that's what I do but it wasn't me it wasn't the real J it wasn't the real Soul it wasn't the real soul of the believer it was a sin nature and God's got Mercy for that sin's already been judged Hallelujah amen it's already been judged but your Soul's already been forgiven praise God my sins already been judged my soul's already been forgiven hallelujah it's past tense Hallelujah that's why Peter a man who lied can get up there and say you've lied to the Holy Ghost now he's got more power now he's on a different level he's followed On's he's coming to canaan's land amen he's crossed over Jordan in canaan's land and this is like heaven to Peter praise God he's got the Holy Ghost now praise God like we were saying those brothers that argue about who's well not argue but uh praise each other as the greatest of all time how can they be born again I don't know I'll leave that up to God but Peter was no longer arguing about who's greater he he knew the only one that was great that was Christ because they lied to the Holy Ghost didn't lie to Peter oh it's a fearful thing the Bible said in verse six that the young man arose wound him up carried him out and buried him and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in and Peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much and she said yay for so much now look at that Satan had so filled her heart she she couldn't even sense that something had happened there she couldn't even sense the severity the seriousness of the atmosphere see they she had to been like Judas she's beyond the point of feeling the sensitivity of the Holy Spirit like I can just walk in here amongst the church I can just lie like I can li like I lie anywhere like I'm in a bar like I'm in a I don't know wherever Library whatever you can't do that she lost her sense uh the Bible said her conscience has been seared and she couldn't sense the fact that my husband died something happened to him she couldn't even sense that she was so far far beyond verse 9 then Peter said to her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the Lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out then she fell she and then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up The Ghost and the young man came in and found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband and great fear Came Upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things now I was reading uh Billy Paul's testimony Billy Paul said he's seen that a couple times in brother bram's meetings where brother bradam would say something and then people would just speak out against it and the people would die I think it was two times I think Billy Paul said and it had to pack people out dead in the meetings because they defied the spirit of God it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of an Angry God it's a fearful thing like I told you before the most close I've ever seen to this was when that uh our former Church blasphemed God's revelation on serpent seed and they had a whole couple years of 20 funerals or something like that uh it was told to me it was a season of death to speak against the word of God like that so what does it make us do it makes us be careful what comes out of our mouth but church we don't live in fear now we live in we live in the fear of God respect of God but we don't live in fear like well I'm going to be one of those lost ones no you know you know you're that's not in your heart you know God the Bible said I love this scripture the Bible said God is able to keep you from falling amen you don't want to fall so God's able to keep you from falling that's how I know I'm not going to fall amen he's able to keep me praise I've been TR I've asked him to keep me from going too far praise God I've asked him so he's faithful praise God none of us would ever look at acts 5 and say well that could be me someday impossible ible I never go that far why because he's changed me praise God Amen Hallelujah I'd rather be if if I had the choice i' rather be you know I'm saying like this I I I I want to be so safe in Christ I'd rather be the poor person in this situation getting the hand me outs than the rich person I would say Lord put me on that side put me as far away from being a Judas as I possibly can let me be a real Saint let me be a real believer keep me from falling praise God heyen like brother BR said brother Ram said you know when he saw maybe you heard this lately said brother said when he saw Oral Roberts University he said they have millions of dollars he said I think they have a hundred typewriters typing up all the letters and brother BR said I got one little typewriter he said Lord I guess you couldn't trust me with that much money now we don't know one way or the other but brother Ram looked at it like it was God's doing brother R said so see now he said now I don't got to go beg for money every service the church said he said and and Oral Roberts has to go to the big church look he has to compromise and he has to go to the big churches where they're giving big offerings I think he said I got he's got to get $10,000 per day that was back in the 60s what do they got to get now I see all these sellouts you know uh they're like you know even today all the Benny henss of the world are like I feel you know they'll read like a verse like it's uh you know Psalm 119 ver10 all those numbers are up to like let's say 1, you know 19 something dollars they'll say the Lord tells me that's the verse for you and you got to send me $1,190 come on that's you don't see that in the scripture it's just it's a it's a fake discernment it's a lie and anybody with the Bible said anybody with any discernment would know that's a lie the elect cannot be deceived praise God Hallelujah but brother bam said that you know he just took it as if I'm poor if my Ministry is smaller then that must be God's Will and church that's what I want to say too if I'm small and nothing I'd rather be that God Must Have Known that's the right thing for me praise God because I know I'm right in my father's hand hallelujah amen hallelujah I know my life and I'm trying to live as close as I can to Christ I know I'm right where he wants me to be I don't want to be anywhere else I want to be where Jesus wants me to be praise God Glory Hallelujah you know we just humbly say Lord if I miss anything then just show me and correct me Hallelujah so we're given discernment he's given power of life and death Peter's given that a man who used to lie right but God forgave him praise God God gave him another chance hallelujah oh a beautiful testimony God's mercy on Peter you know we've been talking about Peter a lot lately so I don't know I think Lydia wants to write a book about him sometime rightn now I just found this website I just want to read a few things I was just trying to get some other ideas you know I read some quotes from Brother brand just a moment but this one website said God allowed it because he ofor sin and this was the beginning of the church this is the birth the the brand new church and this is the first major sin that came in the church lying lying about money right and they have all these examples of all these men just given all let's say let's call 10 grand or whatever land today is pretty valuable let's say 100,000 okay that's about how much land would probably be today if not more they lay a 100,000 and then these two Liars come up and say well we sell this for for for 20,000 but they're keeping 880,000 no wonder God would allow that so God AB that sin second it's hypocrisy they're trying to act like they're generous but they're they're thieves so God judged it because of the hypocrisy and third it was a lesson for the rest of the church keep the church clean don't try to lie to the Holy Ghost so Church you think God likes an honest person or a liar God likes honesty this example should prove it to us plainly God wants us to be honest Hallelujah and remember this is not Old Testament well brother J that's just the Old Testament this is the brand new New Testament Holy Ghost filled church amen this the book of Acts church amen these are these acts 238 youngans Hallelujah that's the only kind the word can bring forth Hallelujah so we should strive to be like this it shows God hates sin wholeheartedly God hates hypocrisy so this is these are make believers and God judged their bold flagrant sin I like that God hates covetousness see they were Covetous they were thinking well I want to take care of me but I want to make myself look good in front of the church right they're Covetous I'll give a little bit but I'm keeping most of it yeah all these other people are like I'm just trusting God see hypocrisy and they desired the praise of men they wanted to be like these other people that played a part in the church and feeding others they want to look like everybody else but yet keep some back for themselves so see they never really had Faith to begin with right because if they had Faith they would have said well God gave it to me and I'm led by the Holy Spirit to give it and I'm I have nothing to worry about because God's leading me to do this that's just what the Bible said the Bible said God just wants us to be cheerful givers and the church said it's whatever you give is fine just be glad about it just be glad you got something something to give hallelujah amen that's what God loves God doesn't like a ly Giver right like an is's fire so this is a reminder to us that God looks at the heart no matter what we say no matter what we try to project the church God is looking at our hearts God's looking at the truth God hates sin and God wants the church to be pure that's why I saying refiner fire tonight God wants a pure church that's honest and gives just out of the generosity no matter what they give they're just honest about it and they just give remember uh I'm going to read Revelation 2:23 can you pull it up here actually you're probably faster and I can find it good we're doing good Revelation 223 see oh you beat me verse 23 there and I kill her children with death that's speaking of the Protestants and all the churches shall know that I am he which ser churches the Reigns of the hearts now look kill again this is this a this is very scriptural just like ananas and Safa if they lie to me if they have false religion I'll kill them with their false religion and everyone will know that I know the hearts and I will give unto every one of you according to your Works amen what a what a blessing that is for us God sees all of our works whatever we give God is going to pay you back amen every time you give to somebody God's keeping track he going to make sure He blesses you in return praise God hallelujah amen now let me read some quotes from Brother brandom here this is communion 1965 this is the last recorded message of brother Braham he only taught the communion I think Perry green preached the service and they only recorded I think it's like a 35 minute communion service afterwards in the last thing the last part brother Ram says he says me and the church the Lord has let me speak to in these last hours We Believe believe we're in the closing time we believe God has given us this message it's been ordained of God it's been proven by God Amen it's been showed of God now we must come to him with reverence and with love and with purity of heart and mind and soul this message has been proven by God hallelujah all these people that knew brother brandom all these testimonies of brother Ram his gift that he led by that was led by God all these Bible verses he's pointed to God has proven this message is right amen I still got a man who left the message recently he might listen to this but he was trying to text me today and talk to me about that and I was trying to say brother with all the kindness in my heart trying to say brother this message is the Bible Revelation I said it's not brother bram's Revelation it's God's revelation that he gave to brother Bram I said there's no contradictions in the Seven Seals in the water baptism in the Lord Jesus Christ the godhead uh you name it modesty there's no contradictions in those things that's why we know it's God's interpretation amen I said brother R plainly said I don't come that anybody will follow me said I come that men might have a true relationship with Jesus Christ and that's what we've got hallelujah amen we're not married to denomination you're not married to me you're not married to any preacher you're married to Christ Jesus Hallelujah because no matter which preachers come or go no matter what friends or family members go you still know Christ and he's your power he's your life he's your anchor he's your best friend he's your everything praise God hallelujah is it then we just sing he's your companion and he's your best friend who's there when you got nobody to talk to Jesus sometimes we wait till he's the last one that we have to talk to but he's still our best friend he's still our companion that's what this message has done it's given us a real relationship with Jesus Christ I shared that quote with him so so brother R says you know now this is not a prophecy but it's just interesting he says it you know the hour will soon arise right Among Us will be the holy spirit will speak out like it did in ananas and safire how many say God help us hallelujah amen God help us and I prayed that like I told you I prayed that for all these years Lord don't let sin come in that door if it does clean it out while we're here I believe God has honored that like I told you I we haven't had many preachers at all Hardley come in here that preach false Doctrine to us right now you know me I'm a teacher i' like to study the scripture if we would have got false Doctrine I would have told you about it right or you would have asked you would have asked me about yes you would have asked me about because brother R said if I he said if I ever take anything off the word you're Duty bound to come and talk to me about it praise God so God has been very gracious to us he said see that hour is arriving see now you just remember that see God is going to dwell among his people that's what he wants to do now now that's perfect because it's restoration God is restoring us back to the book of Acts church so may God make us the most honest people we can possibly be not to lie about anything not to stretch the truth just tell the truth like it is now my wife will tell you sometimes I make mistakes I sometimes exaggerate in my stories so may God forgive me for that I don't want to do that anymore I'm I need God's help in that Hallelujah mainly it's just because I don't remember the details and I'm really excited about the testimony I'm really glad what God did and it maybe it just seemed like that to me you know everybody was screaming or shouting maybe it just two people screaming or shouting I don't know but my my point is to show and to to testify that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now it's hard to it's hard to exaggerate about that in appointed service right Hallelujah next quote in the church change book brother man says he's talking about returning re repenting and coming back to our first love he said God tells them to remember so let's remember the book of Acts evidently something had left their minds they had forgotten something he told them to turn back in their minds to their point of origin the origin was the first age of Pentecost they'd fallen from it they had forgotten in the the glory and The Wonder of it it was time to go back in their minds and then in reality back to when they could say for to me to live is Christ back to Purity when ananas and sa were dealt with brother calls that Purity two people dying in the church was Purity because God said I'm not going to let that leevan grow and these are Judas es scariot right I'm not going to let them continue I'm going to back up my church my church wants to be clean so I'm going to keep them clean and church that's what we got to want we just got to want our church to be clean praise God I'm trying not to clap around you you got sensitive ears there I want I want to be a more sensitive dad by God's grace maybe I'll just clap over here you know I do want to be careful gotta remember that brother Raam said see back to the purity of ananas and Safa may God help us to always tell the truth and not to lie to the Holy Ghost that's a Pure Heart Lord this is what I've done this this is the best I can do but I'm telling you this is exactly what I'm doing Lord you know my heart I want to be honest before you I want to tell everybody the truth praise God that's a pure heart brother bam says you've heard him say he says if you just tell the truth every time he says and you have nothing to worry about because you it's always it's always the same every time because you told the truth the first time it's GNA be the second time it's always going to be the same you don't have to worry about anything if you just tell it right the first time praise God man said what a reproach it is to drift from God to the acts that defile his name let those and he quotes that good scripture let those who name the name of Christ depart from sin and keep their vessels pure for God look at what you once were in your heart and mind in your life then go back to it you know I was just I watched my interracial marriage video last night because somebody was asking me about it and I was listening I was like yeah somebody emailed me yeah somebody from Ghana uh one God Tabernacle is that ring a bell okay his name's Prince brother Prince I don't know if he's that's a title that's his name but he said uh for all my life I've been taught interracial marriage is wrong he said then I watched your video he said all my fears and all my anxieties fell away from me he said thank you for being true to the word I said you're welcome five Bible examples that set us free Hallelujah Moses and Zapora I'm not going to name all of them but um Ruth uh Timothy I can't remember those two oh um Uriah UAH the hittite Hittites could even go into the house of God and yet God made him a mighty man of Val God's word is true I love getting emails like that sometimes I wish I could put them up there but you you be wasting your time it just makes me feel good like I did something right finally by God's grace somebody was blessed amen hallelujah but I thought my was like wow I looked at that video and then the one brother said uh he said brother Jess he said your videos are different he said every time you're behind that Pulpit he said the spirit of God is speaking through you I'm not perfect at all but that's what the brother noticed he's from Minnesota I said well praise so in my mind I'm like Lord help me to go back to that help me to help me to take this seriously praise God help me not to exaggerate one thing help me just to tell like it is praise God can I say like this may I preach like it was my last sermon before I would die like each sermon brother and said that's how a preacher should preach this is your last chance to point somebody to Christ Hallelujah preach with that type of sincerity that's the purity of the early church and we're a part of the book of Acts church amenu I want to read a quote uh if you got your Bible go to uh Luke 14:26 I'm going to call Lydia and Malachi to read because they're right up here they got their Bibles in hand so Lydia go to Luke 14 Mali go to Matthew 10:28 Lydia Luke 14:26 and Mali Matthew 10:28 I know it's hard to remember with all those numbers but let me read this brother I was talking about um Israel and the church this is from 1953 I'm almost done here I try to close at eight I got 15 minutes that's PL time but way I'm talking about uh Israel and kades barnea and we'll have L read that in just a moment says there you are Kadesh can you do it now remember what was Kadesh Barne God's people with Moses were trying to cross over into the promised land but the majority they sent 12 Spies two of them believed Joshua and Caleb believed they could take the promised land 10 of them doubted now what what was the reason you remember the reason why those two believed because they had a different Spirit than everybody else aren't you glad you got the holy spirit amen you didn't receive the spirit of the world you didn't receive the spirit of Hollywood you didn't receive the spirit of entertainment you receive the spirit of Jesus Jesus Christ Hallelujah the Holy Ghost amen that's why we believe all things are possible God's going to work God's going to move CU we got a different Spirit praise God Amen Hallelujah that's why I believe that's why you believe that's why we act different because we've got the Holy Spirit he said can he said there you are cadus can you do it yes God promised it to you I'm not to bring pre peace but a sword so he goes from kades barnea to Jesus what a connection crossing over the promised land to Jesus preaching on in his initial part of his the beginning of his ministry I come to separate father and mother husband wife sister brother and everything and he that won't forsake his own and follow me is not worthy to be called mine and he that puts his hand in the plow and even turns a look back is not worthy that's right brother I tell you it means a whole lot more than run up and shaking hands with a preacher and a few drops of water sprinkled on you see we don't got that we don't got that to worry about that's right brother it runs a whole lot more than walking up to the Altar and taking communion walking back and sit down your seat it means there here here's what the gospel means brother Ram says it means a selling out dying out brother and oldfashioned Backwoods sky blue sin killing religion that don't wash you white I'm say he says but don't white washes you but washes you white Hallelujah cleans you up Burns you out scour you out sterilizes you and make you a new person he said that's old sassr kind brother but I tell you it'll stick to your ribs amen so now you got some food to stick to your ribs tonight when you go home Hallelujah you got some meaty meaty preaching amen hey you know we've had we've done it many times in our house we sterilized a needle right that's what brother R says God sterilized me like a needle set me right in your fire fire Amen Let the Holy Ghost and Fire Burn upon my life amen sterilize me amen refiners fire Hallelujah clean me out make me pure make me clean so you can use me praise God sterilize my life amen I love this it's beautiful he said it doesn't white wash you it washes you white brother that'll stick to your ribs that's right it'll hold you through the trials oh how many know Jesus hold you in your trials I feel like shouting he says pretty near that's pretty big yes sir when I think of a brother I'm secured God said so can we take the land sure we can take it in the last days I'll pour out my spirit and I'll show signs and wonders Hallelujah he said he would do it God promised it we're at Cades let's go get it somebody's been over and brought back some grapes I know the land's good that's right let's go over and get some of them that's right Hallelujah we got some Revival Services come up let's go on over and let's go over and get some of these fruits amen let's get some of these evidences hallelujah praise God other words let's have some testimonies that we can tell others This Land Is Real I've been to the land and let's say like this I live in the land praise God I just don't cross back over I live in canaan's land I'm born again I possess the promises God keeps his word we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus Hallelujah numbers four I'm sor sorry Luke 14 Lydia 1426 and 27 all right leave that up there so Jesus of course using hyperbole he's not hyperbole he's not saying you need to hate your mom and dad he's saying anything that keeps you from following me you've got to reject it you got to walk away from it as if you hate it he said because you cannot be a disciple disciple means learner you can't learn the message unless you take up your cross daily and follow me right I've said it many times a cross is a slow death I was showing the I was showing the kids at the middle school I said they would nail their you remember that they nail their feet together and they have to lift they have to push up to get a breath and then they got so tired they have to come back down and then their arms will be pulling out like the arms will be pulling out of joint and they run out of breath they got to do it again and then get a breath and then come back down and it's Suffocation it's slow Suffocation but Jesus said that's what you and I do every day we slowly suffocate the the desires of the flesh we've got to fight against we got to crucify our desires Jesus said that's the way you become my disciple he said you got to hate family mother anything anything that will draw you away from the word of God you've got to separate yourself from that and you must die to yourself every day then you can be a Christian praise God sin killing religion amen thou stick to your ribs brother brother sister Hallelujah have some meat on your ribs now I could use some of that praise God Matthew 10 Malachi we get the same idea Matthew 10 now it was 28 but Malachi it's a long text I don't have enough time I got down to about eight minutes here these are the scriptures g g or brother R uses for sky blue sin killing religion in other words clean living now that's a great scripture man uh I might as well read it I mentioned The Sparrows Mali read 2829 and well just read 28 to 31 you're a fast reader amen that's a great scripture think about you know Israel and Hamas let's say we are in that situation with the war and everything we you know the B Jesus tells us Don't Fear the person who can take your life fear the person who can cast your soul down that's real that's real a spiritual maturity right when you're more fearful of God than a person who wants to kill you right and then Jesus says not even a bird falls down except the father knows about it and he says aren't you more valuable than a sparrow doesn't God know you're going up and you're coming down doesn't God know all the hairs on he knows the very hairs on her head praise God one time I count I think I lose like eight or nine every night in the shower got to pull them up there pick them up and throw them away nine or 10 every day God knew every one of those amen he counts our hairs he knows everything praise God he's watching over us praise God and then he says verse 32 who whoever therefore shall confess me before men see tell people about Jesus oh yeah the doctor asked me yesterday I was at the doctor or the secretary she saids what's your religion I said Christian she said oh good I said exactly right I'm a Christian praise God I said God bless you have a great day see you can't be ashamed of it he says uh I will confess also before my Father which is in heaven verse 33 but whosoever shall deny me before men him will I also deny before my Father which is in heaven think not that I'm come to send peace on the Earth right we all pray for God give me peace give me peace but Jesus says Christianity actually creates uh it creates war against itself in other words Satan gets upset so Satan starts fighting the truth but God has to allow it right whatever God we went through that last Wednesday night right whatever happens God allowed it God allowed the disciples to get arrested right put hands on them remember I put hands on Mal guy last week they put hands on them God allowed it so we got to trust God in the midst of the trial Don't Fear the ones who put their hands on you fear the one who can toss your soul into hell should say toss but cast your soul now whatever the word is it's not toss verse 35 for I am come to set a man at variance against his father and against the daughter against her mother and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law so these scriptures really encourage us when the rest of our family doesn't believe because Jesus said that's what I've come to do I've come to make you believer I've come to make you a city on a hill in your family I've come to make you the salt of the earth in your family Hallelujah and a man's foe shall be they of his own household Hallelujah verse 37 he that loveth father mother more than me is not worthy of me he that love a son or daughter more than me is not worthy me I think a brother amen he loved Jesus Christ more than his family willing to be kicked out with nowhere to go Hallelujah he loved Christ Lord love father and mother praise God to and that's a man Jesus said I'll confess you before the father because you confessed me before men verse 38 he that taketh not his cross and boweth after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it but he that loses his life his life for my sake shall find it praise God Amen that's the only way to find your life is to lose your life that's the only way you're going know what God wants you to do when you get rid of everything so you have nothing to do except serve God hallelujah I love verse 40 he that receives you brother Jesse receives me and he that receives me receiveth him that sent me praise God Amen oh thank God Amen Jesus said there this chain if you receive the preacher then you receive the one that sent the preacher and then you receive the one that sent Jesus that was the father Hallelujah now the Bible says if you have the right Doctrine you have both son and the father that's right verse 41 he that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward and he that receiveth a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward I like to preach that someday I don't have the thoughts now but I like what's the difference between a prophet's reward and and a righteous man's reward maybe it's Abraham and lot I don't know that sounds like it'd be pretty good right there because the Bible said AB lot was a righteous Soul right lot was a righteous soul but Abraham was the prophet and whever shall give a drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple verily I say unto you he shall nowise lose his reward God remember brother man says we should labor for Eternal Rewards right in this case giving water to people Christians right helping out Believers anything we can do to help out somebody uh with their life make their life a little easier Jesus says when you've done it to them you've done it to me and I'm going to reward you how many know he's faithful praise God I'm trying to close here hallelujah acts 512 let me go back there now Church look at the Purity and look at what the Purity produced we read 1 through 11 already tonight we'll close with this it's about 8 o'clock so that's really good time and by verse 12 and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrough among the people and they were all with one Accord in Solomon's porch and of the rest dur no man join himself to them but the people magnified them so remember this is right after the death of these two nobody just joined the church after that there was this holy awe about them people magnified them and the Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both men and women in so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might over overshadow some of them the same man who denied Christ three times church if this doesn't bless your heart to know that God redeems his children something we we need to shake ourselves a little bit here tonight amen hallelujah he lied but God forgive him he was the uh he was the preacher on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah he opened the door of Faith to the Jews he opened the door of Faith to the Gentiles he opened the door of Faith to the Samaritans praise God hallelujah God uses him to speak life or death over them and now the man just walks in the street and his shadow Hallelujah is a manifestation God uses the shadow to miraculously heal people just the shadow of the man Hallelujah and then later on what does he do he separates from the Gentiles so he's a man that's so easily beset but what he knew how to do he knew how to lay down the sin that so easily besets him praise God Amen and run the race and start running again for God's glory he's a man who KN who knew he knew how to have Victory he knew how to go through trials but he knew how to start back again praise he could get back to his first love there it is amen hallelujah he was able to remember what it was like and repent and get back to serving God hallelujah there came also multitude out the cities round about unto Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone let's stand to our feet musicians can come here so this is what an honest Church produces praise God this is what a pure Church produces I called this in my notes I called this is a Street Ministry this was such a powerful honest Church they could go out into the streets and people are getting healed out in the streets remember Mike mosy I don't know if you heard his testimonies he said numerous times he he's prayed for people in Menards Lowe's Home Depot all those places and people have got their healing right there in the low's right right there right in public he said the people will cry and they'll feel the healing and yet God allows him to stay there in the wheelchair a god who's rich in Mercy and he is but God is writing a story God has a testimony for each and every person see it takes it out into public so let's be mindful here let's be mindful tonight let's be mindful tomorrow if we run into people that need prayer let's be mindful our God is with us if we can just be honest just tell the truth have a pure heart before God how many want a pure heart tonight praise God not just anybody can join this church let me say like this same is true for us we've seen people try to come join this church you can't join this church you got to be born in this church amen hallelujah you got to be born in this church Hallelujah so I'm so thankful I've been born into the body of Christ praise God like I've I've told this many people before I believe in inviting people to church but I don't believe in begging people to come to church because nobody had to beg me to come to the message I would drive three hours sister Lena on a sun Saturday afternoon and when I got done with my football season I drive three hours on a Saturday I sit there for three hours for Bible study and drive three more hours back nine hours those are some sweet hours listen to brother brandom on the drive there stud about brother brand come back and drive home listen to

to invite people uh I just invited brother Chris again I'm G to invite brother Chris again uh he texted me today asked how the family's doing we want to remember these people we want to pray for these

see someone who needs something we can say a word of prayer for them Lord God in Jesus Christ's name amen I forgot I just ended the prayer there because I forgot I have a coworker a first grade teacher who was in remission of cancer but now they think it's back she's not at work and she's lost feeling in her entire left arm and so we had prayer at our school yesterday in the morning just five minutes of prayer I'd like your prayers too her name's Amanda she's Pro yeah she's probably been teaching maybe 10 years more more than me would you pray for her you know the first scripture I asked the teachers you know could you bring a verse and the first one they read was if you speak to this mountain and don't doubt the mountain will move I just thought that was faith building let's pray her name is Amanda she has four children no three and they're all three in college it would just mean a lot to me if you just pray father God Lord be with Amanda Lord she has Faith In You Lord she can't feel her arm she can't raise her arm she's probably 50 Lord Jesus I ask you'd heal her Lord just like we've asked for Robbie Davis Lord we want to be led by the Holy Spirit many times I don't know whether to speak to the mountain Lord I don't know but I just ask in Jesus Christ's name may you bring healing to my friend and may those teachers of Arrowhead see a miracle Lord God I want to see it to not that they'll see him not that they'll give me any credit cuz I'm nothing I can't heal anybody but I believe Lord God I know Hallelujah all things are possible Lord to them to believe and it would just be a testimony Lord God that maybe I'm the one that called the prayer meeting they would just see that your word is true my wife dresses is the right way when they see my daughters come they would know that this is the truth dear God that you would be glorified God because I know I'm nothing I'm a failure to begin with as brother said we're all failures but I ask for healing in the name of Jesus Christ Lord God he said you have not because you asked not so I ask in Jesus holy name please heal Amanda Lord God may it be another great Victory Lord Jesus for thy Glory but Lord we know your will will be done father God and I ask the same for Robbie remember that man with two children please don't let him pass onto the grave Lord God now of course we would accept it as your will if he did but Lord in our own compassion we want to see him made well we ask for healing for Robbie as well for Amanda and Robbie Lord because we know one day it might be our mom our dad it might be us it might be me so Lord we want to pray for others Lord God while we have the strength so we ask in the Holy Name of Jesus we ask for healing guide us Lord to speak your word guide us to believe your word guide us to be lights help us to walk in the spirit Lord God that even our hands laid on somebody could bring a healing Lord they feel the anointing of the Holy Ghost Grant it Lord and we
