[31:36] and feel of them you know if you're
[31:41] really honest with yourself and sincere
[31:44] every moment every day you should
[31:46] examine yourselves with one another now

[31:50] way every action every thought every
[31:53] detail very mindful of the things we
[31:59] think and say and do and Mota's
[32:02] objectives those sort of things so we
[32:08] want to go right into the Word of God I
[32:12] don't have a gift like brother Isaiah
[32:16] Brooks brother cam Smith brother Jesse
[32:21] Smith these pastors are loved singing in
[32:25] the spirit and our people are blessed by
[32:28] the the ministry of song and they have
[32:30] all those things well I kind of see
[32:32] myself if I if I had to explain myself I
[32:35] see maybe a brother Jesse up here
[32:37] preaching then I'm the guy in the back
[32:38] just trying to jump over his shoulders I
[32:39] get him that's right that's right that's
[32:41] really cams preach and I'm like behind
[32:44] him like that's exactly it so back up by

[36:23] we're pressing on there in Napoleon like
[36:26] we always do
[36:27] like you guys are pressing on here and I
[36:29] was when I heard brother Jesse long long
[36:32] time ago he was coming to Akron and then
[36:34] he God took football away from him and a
[36:37] coach said brother looks like you're

[36:52] here in Akron Akron means what pinnacle
[36:53] or the high peak or Amen so there's
[37:00] something to it and I always like one
[37:04] thing that way stuck with me as sister
[37:05] Wendy said you know he he lives what he
[37:08] preaches and she said I can respect that
[37:12] so any home let's get into this by the
[37:16] grace of God Ezekiel 9 1 he that cried
[37:19] also in mine ears with a loud voice
[37:21] saying calls them that have charged over
[37:23] the city to draw near
[37:25] even every man with his destroying
[37:27] weapon in his hand and this morning like
[37:29] to teach on an urgent inkhorn writer
[37:34] saints of God that Ezekiel one is a very
[37:37] powerful section of Scripture we know
[37:40] judgment is to strike the destroying
[37:43] angels are prepped they're ready I got
[37:48] to talk and listen to brother science
[37:51] there or any science and he said brother
[37:53] do you realize he said that first whoa
[37:55] he says with the first world war he says
[37:58] in the destroying angels the four winds
[38:00] he said were right there he says the
[38:02] world was supposed to be destroyed right
[38:03] then but then in that time the war
[38:07] stopped at a miraculous time on the
[38:09] eleventh day eleventh month eleventh
[38:11] eleventh hour'
[38:12] showing what we're crossing now over
[38:14] into the into the midnight hour he said
[38:16] and look how far and what it was this
[38:18] year or was it last year the hundredth
[38:20] year anniversary of World War one the
[38:22] ending or however and look how the
[38:26] mercies of God are now he told mote Noah
[38:29] he says build that Ark he says and God
[38:31] let that he let him preach for a hundred
[38:34] and twenty years just waiting for
[38:35] everyone to hear the word of God he says
[38:38] and now he's in the World War two he
[38:40] says look we've had a hundred years now
[38:41] to bring this word in about 50 or 60 to
[38:44] bring this message the real light not a
[38:47] man-made light not a denomination or
[38:50] light not something that has a lot of
[38:52] questions in it but saints of God
[38:53] something solid we can point back to the
[38:56] Word of God and say this is exactly it
[39:00] amen so an urgent in corner writer
[39:04] let's read just a little bit a portion
[39:06] of this hope is all right Sunday morning
[39:08] stretch your arms a little bit maybe
[39:09] wave them like this if you're feeling a
[39:11] little tired or brother Malachi yes
[39:13] absolutely
[39:14] yes we're could get that get that blood
[39:16] flowing I got little arms or little
[39:19] eagle wings here my little eagle and
[39:21] legs absolutely why don't come chicken
[39:23] legs I call me go legs
[39:24] you gotta get that blood flowing get
[39:26] that oxygen pumping in there keep keep
[39:29] that natural disease out it will keep
[39:31] the spiritual disease out as well
[39:33] Ezekiel 19 says behold six men came from
[39:36] the way of the higher gate which live
[39:38] towards
[39:39] the north notice the north is there
[39:43] right we've taught on the east gate
[39:45] extensively one time we came here but
[39:47] not we're gonna deal with the north gate
[39:49] he says and which lieth towards the
[39:52] north and every man a slaughtering
[39:53] weapon is handed and one among them was
[39:54] clothed with linen with old with the
[39:57] writer's inkhorn by his side and they
[39:59] went in and stood by the brazen altar he
[40:02] says in the glory of God of Israel was
[40:04] gone up from the chair where he was to
[40:06] the threshold of the house and he called
[40:08] to the man clothed in linen which had
[40:10] the inkhorn
[40:11] riders he says the writers inkhorn by
[40:13] his side and now he says and the Lord
[40:17] said unto me go through the midst of the
[40:18] city through the midst of Jerusalem now
[40:21] he's dealing with now with the city of
[40:24] Jerusalem right this is God's city this
[40:26] is the this is the City of David and
[40:28] what the man that had a heart after
[40:30] God's own heart
[40:31] he says set a mark upon the foreheads of
[40:34] the men that sigh and that cry for the
[40:37] abominations that's done in the midst
[40:39] thereof so he says he says of the cities
[40:41] as there's some people that's know
[40:43] what's going on in the city there's some
[40:46] people who are aware of lost people of
[40:49] situations and things that are not right
[40:52] going on in this city and he says he
[40:55] says the ones that are crying out
[40:56] against these things he says mark them
[40:59] in their forehead right he says enter
[41:02] the others now that was a commission to
[41:04] the what though the in corn rider he
[41:06] says mark that mark those in this city
[41:10] right he says he says but everyone else
[41:12] there was not marked he says and to the
[41:14] others he said in mine hear hearing he
[41:16] says go ye after him through the city
[41:18] and smite let not your eyes spare
[41:20] neither have me pity look at the grace
[41:24] of God once again we know everything's
[41:28] election
[41:29] everything is predestination now look
[41:32] what he says here in the seal of them of
[41:34] the Christ 1955 he says I want to ask
[41:37] you something if that angel came to the
[41:40] city which was the Holy Ghost he says
[41:42] dressed in white like to his purity if
[41:45] that angel came to the city tonight and
[41:48] went through the Pentecostal churches
[41:49] where no world
[41:51] he find amend that sighs and cries he
[41:54] says he says embeds all night in prayer
[41:56] he says for the abominations have done
[41:59] in the city he says who would he mark
[42:04] he's not talking about there back in his
[42:06] eq9 he's talking about right now because
[42:09] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[42:11] and forever and if he's gonna bring a
[42:14] judgement back there in Ezekiel and he
[42:16] brought one bullet all the way back and
[42:17] no his Danny warned and he warned and he
[42:19] warned he says and if there's the
[42:21] greatest judgment that what has never
[42:23] been compared upon the face you earth is
[42:25] about ready to strike in this world when
[42:29] he do it again absolutely he would yes
[42:33] why cuz he's a righteous God he's a just
[42:35] God he's a loving God but he's also a
[42:38] God that don't play games he says who
[42:43] would II Marquis it was going to find
[42:45] out who's got the Holy Ghost pretty soon
[42:47] he says sighing and crying I thought a
[42:52] long time ago back home a little study
[42:54] on the two filters he says and these two
[42:57] filters you have to get through these
[42:58] two filters and one was I thought the
[43:00] first filter was what communion because
[43:02] if you take that communion unworthily
[43:04] and what if you failed to take
[43:06] communities and you actually get sick
[43:08] spiritually and you could affect your
[43:09] natural body and die and thus the last
[43:12] filters the rapture the proving grounds
[43:15] getting in the presence of God real
[43:19] serious he says why be we become so
[43:23] grazed and so indifferent have a
[43:25] little-bitty prayer he says and maybe
[43:28] when we get up he says oh god bless me
[43:30] and Mary's and Martha tell the rest of
[43:32] the family rest and then do the best
[43:34] they can and the men and women are
[43:36] sitting in the street and already saying
[43:38] we get we got thrown these little
[43:39] prayers we have at night and say O Lord
[43:41] save my momma save my daddy safe to save
[43:43] this but what about the man you just saw
[43:45] yesterday on in entering in the bar the
[43:48] ortho or the Banda building that has all
[43:51] the nakedness in there or or whatever
[43:53] what about these people who meet on the
[43:54] street Saints we have to cry for what
[43:57] those last Souls he's talking about soil

[44:50] brother Micah home does it whenever he's
[44:52] anywhere he always says and he asked the
[44:54] people how you doing and he's always
[44:55] hoping for a response he says but much
[44:58] like our doing sir they says well how

[45:02] and highly favored why because he's poor
[45:06] not a little fishing lure their little
[45:07] bigs it's all she's identifying since
[45:09] I'm a Christians and what about you and
[45:11] he's waiting for response absolutely
[45:13] blessed and highly favored because only
[45:15] a Christian would say that hey man this
[45:20] is now questions and answers notice that
[45:21] was back in 55 now we're going post
[45:23] seals he says the exact same thing he
[45:26] says now what now this is question the
[45:27] answers he says he says now let me give
[45:29] you a little twister here in moaña I'd
[45:30] say how many has the Holy Ghost the lion
[45:33] today how many has the Holy Spirit
[45:35] absolutely living and breathing and
[45:37] pumping his energy in and out of you
[45:38] absolutely he's leading and guiding you
[45:40] how many's got the Holy Ghost oh my he
[45:42] says he said alright I'll see if you
[45:45] have the Bible said that they they had
[45:48] the Holy Ghost sighed and cried day and
[45:50] night for the abominations done in the
[45:52] city god helps pieces now how many hands
[45:56] would go up after this we know ourselves
[46:00] better than anyone outside of Christ oh
[46:04] my goodness are we concerned about cares
[46:07] in our own life or are we concerned
[46:09] about others
[46:10] god help us
[46:14] how many you can't rest at night so full
[46:17] of joy the power of God and so sad for
[46:19] the people that's lost that day and I
[46:21] knew weep and cry from the abominations
[46:22] you sees is what would that be in that
[46:25] city how many is it that's in the church
[46:27] that the Bible said that he said the
[46:29] Holy Spirit was the evidence amen
[46:32] all right pretties gone once again here
[46:37] he says he says that and then he brings
[46:40] that about the sighing and crying he
[46:41] works it into Ezekiel 9 again alright he
[46:45] said he said that obviously represented
[46:46] the Holy Ghost right and now let's
[46:50] continue on he says that's the reason in
[46:54] this day that we're coming and we're
[46:56] coming right into a minute he says here
[46:58] in the New Testament where there'll be a
[46:59] seal of God is the Holy Ghost he says
[47:02] and out that he says is the slaughter
[47:05] saints of god this is not coming down
[47:08] just to a spiritual thing this is coming
[47:13] down to a physical life and death it's
[47:18] not just spiritual as well even though
[47:21] that's the most important thing but it's
[47:24] also coming down to a martyrdom if we
[47:27] fail to receive the baptism the Holy
[47:29] Ghost absolutely and of course dealing
[47:34] with Ezekiel 9 you have to throw the
[47:35] scripture in at least I felt - he says
[47:37] you know if any man suffers Christian
[47:39] let him not be ashamed but him glory to
[47:41] God on this behalf he says for the time
[47:42] has come the judgment must begin at the
[47:45] house of God absolutely where did God
[47:48] start he says when they brought this he
[47:50] says he started what in the house of God
[47:52] in that city absolutely he said ISA
[47:55] Honea he says in at first begin at us
[47:58] and if it first began at us why shall
[48:01] the end of them that obey not the gospel
[48:02] of God and if the righteous scared Li
[48:06] scarcely be saved he says where shall
[48:09] the ungodly in the sinner appear right
[48:13] we're at a very difficult all our here a
[48:17] serious sobering out we're 400 years
[48:20] from when it should have been destroyed
[48:21] according the message the hour but
[48:26] we want to get to the go deeper and
[48:29] examine things okay want to examine this
[48:31] the very best I could by the grace of
[48:33] God I'm not captain examination I'm not
[48:36] I've been trained by the CIA CIA or the
[48:39] FBI but I just we just do little Bible
[48:41] studies okay but we want to go into the
[48:43] Word of God and see what it says we want
[48:45] to see what the message of the hour
[48:46] holds everything we wanted to know them
[48:48] every kind of nugget we can poll by the
[48:50] grace of God did I find them all no but
[48:52] we were doing our best
[48:53] in Ecclesiastes ten ten twenties as
[48:55] cursed out the King no not in your
[48:57] thought and curse not the rich in thy
[49:00] bedchamber he says why he says he says
[49:02] be careful what you say be careful what
[49:04] you think he says for a little birdie he
[49:06] says a little bird he says in the air
[49:08] will carry that voice and that wish that
[49:10] hath wings shall tell the matter right
[49:14] in other words all the Bible says what
[49:16] our sins will find us out
[49:18] absolutely and Luke 12 verse 1 in the
[49:22] meantime when they were gathered
[49:23] together in an innumerable multitude
[49:24] people and so mentions the throne at one
[49:27] upon another he began to say the
[49:28] disciples first of all beware ye the
[49:30] leaven of the Pharisees which is which
[49:32] is hypocrisy
[49:33] for there is nothing covered that shall
[49:36] not be revealed neither hear that shall
[49:41] not be known the entire plan of Satan
[49:45] was not only prophesied of in the Book
[49:49] of Revelations but then here in this day
[49:51] the entire book of Revelation is broke
[49:53] out and what the Holy Ghost he said it
[50:00] being opened up every single thing that
[50:03] we need to know absolutely in the barn
[50:06] Jesus even said he said the very elect
[50:08] shall not be deceived absolutely why
[50:11] because what we eat we know first of all
[50:15] we know we have to have the Holy Ghost
[50:16] and we have him he
[50:20] you can sit here in the center a
[50:22] preacher and this and this but what is
[50:24] the Holy Ghost II many Amen absolutely
[50:27] sure way my words absolutely I want to
[50:29] be in the right to if they if you hear
[50:30] something wrong with me absolutely
[50:32] brother Jesse corrected me the last time
[50:34] and I corrected it a big last service
[50:35] that was here 20 how now verse 3
[50:39] therefore what so we have spoken and
[50:41] darkness shall be heard in the light and
[50:43] that's what she has spoken the ear and
[50:44] closet shall be proclaimed upon the
[50:47] housetops saints absolutely and also now
[50:50] any Elijah's ministry the king of syria
[50:53] was going to do a war and he was won in
[50:54] a fight and he said we're going to sneak
[50:56] up on israel and do all these things
[50:58] oh my good god has sent a prophet in
[51:01] Israel I told him exactly what they was
[51:05] plated and they were befuddled how do
[51:11] these guys know then in the second King
[51:13] six and twelve but what a serpent said
[51:15] on him not even my Lord my king but
[51:17] Elisha the Prophet that is in the land
[51:19] tell it the king of Israel the words of
[51:21] our speakers in that bedchamber praise
[51:26] be to God I'll tell you what we need the
[51:29] gift of prophecy in the church once
[51:31] again as far as minor prophets brought
[51:33] give people who have the gift or the
[51:35] gift of prophecy honor absolute
[51:36] interpretation absolutely and God can
[51:38] you also use your pastor to speak forth
[51:40] absolutely Amen God will always warn his
[51:43] children but now Ezekiel 9 1 he said
[51:50] it's time to mark why cuz destruction is
[51:55] coming now why is destruction coming
[51:58] there must be sin in the camp there must
[52:02] be things that's going to be done wrong
[52:04] absolutely there must be the things of
[52:07] God that he said in the into the hands
[52:09] of men must be out of cater and God is
[52:12] going to bring a judgment now and he's
[52:14] he he oh 9 he's lining up his six boys
[52:16] and he says go in there in slay off but
[52:20] he says the one that's kind of heart
[52:21] like me that doesn't what that is
[52:23] actually concerned a for soul just has a
[52:25] little soaps for male he says mark them
[52:28] there has another cup action for someone
[52:30] who did not heard the things we've heard
[52:32] that compassion
[52:33] about Jesus Christ and his saving power
[52:35] and I would change your life atoning
[52:38] blood that spirit that lives within us
[52:40] absolutely - now let's back let's go
[52:47] back here by the grace of God now why
[52:49] was judgment coming because of the
[52:51] chapter before Ezekiel 9 is judgment
[52:55] time
[52:56] Markham's sealed with the Holy Ghost and
[52:58] the reason is is because if you go back
[53:00] to the chapter before something is take
[53:04] place something is revealed Ezekiel 8 3
[53:10] now God dealing with his prophet he says
[53:13] and he put forth the form of a hand and
[53:15] took me by a lack of my head and the
[53:18] spirit lifted me up between Earth and
[53:20] heaven and brought me into visions of
[53:22] God oh my goodness in that word Jesus
[53:24] Christ was that he was in between Earth
[53:25] in the heaven and brought me into the
[53:30] visions of God to Egypt no he did not go
[53:36] to a heathen country to not go in today
[53:39] to those worship worshiping astronauts
[53:42] or anything like that of that nature he
[53:44] goes what's right in my own house right
[53:47] to my own City he says and brought me
[53:51] into the visions of God to Jerusalem to
[53:53] the door of the inner gate that looketh
[53:56] toward the north saints of God what is
[53:59] the north the north is the Eagles age
[54:03] it's our age absolutely remember the
[54:06] four beasts the lion the ox the man in
[54:09] the eagle the eagle is on the north side
[54:10] on Dan side as we taught on Wednesday
[54:12] night right this is the north side this
[54:15] is our age absolutely because remember
[54:17] this types our age as well he says in
[54:21] the door the innermost gate that look
[54:23] toward the north where is the seat of
[54:25] the image of jealousy this is outside of
[54:30] the church is an image placed here
[54:35] outside of the church when someone comes
[54:38] to church they wants you to see this
[54:41] first don't worry about what's going on
[54:45] inside yet guys let's let's just set
[54:47] this out here we're gonna set this image
[54:48] here and just just stare at that for a
[54:51] while okay that's the most important
[54:54] thing yes where was the seed of the
[54:59] image of jealousy which provoked a--the
[55:01] to jealousy who was perused who was
[55:02] jealous
[55:02] Jesus Christ God Almighty but in his own
[55:07] church they had an idol set up before
[55:10] all to see yes and behold the glory of
[55:14] God of Israel was there according to the
[55:17] vision that I saw in the plain now I
[55:19] wonder what this I looked in I searched
[55:21] I there was nothing but let me let me
[55:23] bring a little something a little
[55:24] thought from the Word of God in numbers
[55:26] in 20 and verse 7 and the Lord said unto
[55:29] Moses saying take the round gathered all
[55:32] the assembly together he's a down Aaron
[55:34] thy brother and speaking to the rack
[55:36] before their eyes knows what did speak
[55:38] to it right he said they shall give
[55:39] forth his water
[55:40] and thou shalt bring them to the water
[55:43] of the rock so thou shalt give the
[55:44] congregation and of the Beast to drink
[55:46] he says and the Moses took the rod from
[55:48] before the Lord as he was commanded
[55:50] right now look at verse 10 and Moses and
[55:54] Aaron gathered the congregation together
[55:56] before the rock and he sends them here
[55:58] now he rebels must we fetch you water
[56:03] out of this rock didn't Moses have
[56:06] anything to do with this this move was a
[56:11] sole individual move by the Holy Ghost
[56:14] himself by God himself and now Moses is
[56:18] what he says he says now I've got to do
[56:20] this for you guys don't I I guess I'm
[56:23] gonna have to go out here and dig into
[56:25] the Word of God and feed you this world
[56:26] I guess no it must be the leadership of
[56:28] the whole you kinda can't take credit
[56:31] for one thing I've done because it's
[56:34] that oxygen that he made that I have to
[56:36] breathe to live absolutely I can't I
[56:39] can't take your trailer could afford
[56:40] anything but what he's presented before
[56:44] me I want to accept it Lord give me the
[56:48] air to accept it in number 10 verse 10
[56:51] he says must we fetch you water out of
[56:53] this rock and Moses left of his hand and
[56:55] when his rod with his rod he smote the
[56:57] rock twice and the water came up
[56:59] bundling though in the congregation
[57:00] drank and the beasts drank also and the
[57:03] Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because
[57:05] ye believe me not to sanctify me in the
[57:07] eyes of the children of the Lord he did
[57:11] not put credit where credit was due he
[57:13] did not say God is going to give you
[57:15] water and he disobeyed the Word of God
[57:17] what he disobeyed the would have got in
[57:19] front of all of Israel he did not honor
[57:23] God he was not obey obedient to the
[57:26] commandments of God right and why is it
[57:32] so important I'm just hitting us now
[57:35] look look at this this is powerful to me
[57:37] in Exodus 16 15 and when the children
[57:41] reso saw it they said one to another it
[57:43] is a manna now remember that was almost
[57:47] 4,000 years ago
[57:48] Moses smote the rock spoke to this and
[57:50] spoke to that one God did all kinds of
[57:52] thing but now when God comes down again
[57:54] look at the condition of the people and
[57:57] when the mother and the children saw
[57:59] they said unto one another in his manner
[58:00] for lie they wished not what it was now
[58:03] look up Moses his own confession Moses
[58:06] said unto them this is the bread which
[58:08] to which I have given you to eat no he
[58:12] says this is the bread which God give
[58:14] you so notice Moses the majority was
[58:17] ministries is always pointing to God he
[58:19] said Jesus Christ this fella did this
[58:21] the Javad did this joven did that Peter
[58:24] doughnuts montez's testimony but after
[58:26] three thousand two thousand years later
[58:28] however the sisters timetable was set up
[58:30] look when we get into this the first
[58:33] coming of Jesus Christ in John 6 verse
[58:35] 28 and they said to him what shall we do
[58:38] that we might work the works of God
[58:41] sincere honest he says and jesus
[58:45] answered them this is the work of God
[58:47] that you believe on me whom he has sent
[58:50] and they said it therefore unto Him what
[58:52] sign show us now that we may see and
[58:55] believe me what does our work and look
[58:59] what the cooking of the confessions of
[59:00] the people our fathers did eat manna in
[59:04] the desert look they're quoting the
[59:07] scripture
[59:09] as is written he gave them bread from
[59:11] heaven to eat what's wrong with that
[59:13] scripture absolutely nothing but look at
[59:17] Christ's discernment this is God and God
[59:22] Almighty only he could know what that's
[59:25] the Messiah gift you can know the
[59:26] thoughts and intents of the heart
[59:29] when they said he when they said he what
[59:34] did they mean when they said he oh and I
[59:38] oh he gave them and you are thinking of
[59:41] God to the clean hearted pure and
[59:44] thought but Christ's God and flesh with
[59:48] that gift on him is now discerning the
[59:51] very thoughts and intents of these
[59:53] people and does he let it slide who did
[1:00:00] they lift up did they have an image they
[1:00:03] lift it up a little too high God in
[1:00:11] flesh said what and Jesus said to him
[1:00:16] verily verily I say unto you Moses gave
[1:00:20] you not that bread from heaven he
[1:00:23] straight it up right there boys you
[1:00:27] lifted up the prophet a little too high
[1:00:30] you know brother Branham did this in
[1:00:32] brother Branham did he who gave him that
[1:00:36] gift divisions who given that
[1:00:40] variability to discern the Word of God
[1:00:43] and catch the mind of God God gave hey
[1:00:46] let me tell you something when Jesus
[1:00:48] Christ went down hell
[1:00:49] he took captivity captive and rolled him
[1:00:51] up and he said he was ine when the Bible
[1:00:53] say he gave gifts unto men
[1:00:58] why was that gift that he had that was
[1:01:01] from gharlane praise be to God yeah he
[1:01:05] gave gifts unto men well brother he's
[1:01:08] I'm from this brother here's a
[1:01:10] tremendous preacher he can just preach
[1:01:11] the lights out listen who gave him that
[1:01:13] gift if we lifted people up too high is
[1:01:17] there an image of jealousy outside the
[1:01:18] message of the hour if you could take it
[1:01:20] or look at it in a whole
[1:01:23] same setting sighing and crying for the
[1:01:26] abominations done in sitting Moses gave
[1:01:29] you not that bread from heaven he says
[1:01:31] but my father giveth you the true bread
[1:01:33] from heaven
[1:01:35] not only did said hold on boys easily
[1:01:37] let me tell you I'm gonna correct this
[1:01:39] and make it plain and God didn't speak
[1:01:45] he let the flesh speak he's a boy back
[1:01:49] me up so I got it my father did this oh
[1:01:55] my I wonder if God wants you to speak
[1:01:58] sometime does he have to speak every
[1:02:00] time through you or is he waiting for
[1:02:02] you to back up his word someone uses the
[1:02:04] date someone uses the name of our Lord
[1:02:06] in vain and no one says anything about
[1:02:08] it at work on the job in the grocery
[1:02:12] store
[1:02:13] women cuts just as bad as men now swear
[1:02:18] absolutely Kersten call cursing anyhow
[1:02:23] let's continue on by the grace of God so
[1:02:25] there was an image of jealousy and what
[1:02:27] if that was the profit or a profit or
[1:02:29] something like that nature you think you
[1:02:32] ate five we're gonna go down now he's
[1:02:34] coming he brings this profit now to the
[1:02:36] house of God when outside the house of
[1:02:38] God was that image right and verse 5
[1:02:41] then he said unto me son of man lift up
[1:02:43] thine eyes now the way towards the north
[1:02:46] oma he said I lived in my eyes way
[1:02:48] towards the northern being and behold
[1:02:50] northward at the gate was the altar this
[1:02:52] image of jealousy in the entry right and
[1:02:55] he sees the image God says identify this
[1:02:58] he says I see it he says then he saith
[1:03:00] unto me there furthermore unto me son of
[1:03:02] man cease without what they do to doubt
[1:03:06] what they do even the great abominations
[1:03:08] at the house of Israel committeth here
[1:03:11] that I should go far off from my
[1:03:13] sanctuary look he's outside of Laodicea
[1:03:18] it was so filthy there he was on the
[1:03:21] outside trying to get word of God is
[1:03:27] perfect it was type after type after
[1:03:32] type line upon line here a little there
[1:03:35] little
[1:03:36] precept upon precept he says that I
[1:03:41] should go off from my sanctuary he
[1:03:43] couldn't even live in his own house and
[1:03:45] saints of God are we keeping our own
[1:03:46] houses clean a week is the presence of
[1:03:50] God dwelling can you feel him when you
[1:03:53] go to work when you wake up when you
[1:03:55] pray do you feel him is he there in your
[1:03:56] house his house he purchased it but
[1:04:00] turned me again and thou shalt see
[1:04:02] greater greater than this greater than
[1:04:07] an image outside the house of God he's
[1:04:10] gonna take you inside it's gonna take
[1:04:14] you inside say God's gentleman and when
[1:04:21] he's not a judge when his judgement time
[1:04:25] he senses he says it's forcing let me
[1:04:28] show you something I'm gonna break this
[1:04:29] down right now I'm gonna show y'all this
[1:04:32] evil my easy q85 notice he's focusing on
[1:04:36] the north he's poking is focusing on the
[1:04:38] north now looking questions answered 59
[1:04:40] now as I just got to be basing up this
[1:04:44] that Lucifer in heaven tried to exalt
[1:04:46] himself and even be just a little higher
[1:04:49] than his boss through Jesus Christ he's
[1:04:51] any betrayed Michael and made himself a
[1:04:54] greater Kingdom in the North saying
[1:04:58] member it's the same spirit Saints we
[1:05:00] battle the same exact spirits the same
[1:05:04] spirit that was on Herod is still here
[1:05:06] today the same spirit that was on Pilate
[1:05:08] is still here today this exact same
[1:05:10] spirit that was on Judas is here today
[1:05:13] all those spirits of disease and saints
[1:05:16] of God let's just let's just do the
[1:05:18] addition there's a hundred what 200
[1:05:20] million extra demons released a pull of
[1:05:22] the bride in this thing oh my stuff
[1:05:25] we've never even seen before you see the
[1:05:27] insanity you go back 50 years and let
[1:05:29] bring someone in from that time to here
[1:05:31] they beg what is going on with these
[1:05:32] people always don't know if they're boys
[1:05:34] and girls are not they're girls oh my
[1:05:35] goodness confusion in the midst major
[1:05:40] confusion well I was born this way but
[1:05:44] whatever the reasoning has gone off the
[1:05:47] charts
[1:05:48] into insanity unfeeling realities of
[1:05:54] living out his rubber sin didn't begin
[1:05:55] on earth didn't begin in to heaven when
[1:05:57] loose were taken at main him he says I
[1:05:59] want a denomination make a great big
[1:06:01] thing went on to the north country and
[1:06:04] set up a bigger thing that Michael had
[1:06:06] and was kicked out of heaven now God is
[1:06:08] about ready to run these people in the
[1:06:09] ground setting up that image in the
[1:06:11] North everything runs everything runs
[1:06:14] true everything runs true absolutely now
[1:06:19] let's continue on look at what was the
[1:06:22] heart of satan isaiah 14 we've all been
[1:06:24] through these things i know some of this
[1:06:25] might be reviewed verse 12 for thou art
[1:06:27] fallen from the heaven o Lucifer son of
[1:06:29] the morning how thou are cut down to the
[1:06:32] ground he cut what that tree of now is
[1:06:33] evil down just like just like a
[1:06:35] Christmas tree he says thou did weaken
[1:06:38] it's the nation's for thou hast said in
[1:06:39] thine heart what I was sent into heaven
[1:06:42] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:06:43] of God I will sit also upon the Mount of
[1:06:45] the congregation in the sides of the
[1:06:47] east north or west he goes he goes all
[1:06:50] the way cesare back to the north his
[1:06:52] main goal is not to be the top dog he
[1:06:54] wanted to be the best he wanted to be
[1:06:56] God but the you know the positions now
[1:06:58] available he says I will be most like
[1:07:02] the Most High God right now we know the
[1:07:05] Old Testament Tabernacle was set up in
[1:07:07] the wilderness with badger skins and
[1:07:09] those kinds of things absolutely but now
[1:07:11] as in the time of Ezekiel they had
[1:07:13] Solomon's Temple and I've been rebuilt
[1:07:14] or however he says and this is kinda I'm
[1:07:17] sorry for the it's not real sharp here
[1:07:18] this is just kind of overview but this
[1:07:21] is why there was a Northside
[1:07:22] this is Ezekiel's temple there was an
[1:07:24] extra near entrance to the east and from
[1:07:26] the south and then this is obviously the
[1:07:29] the inner court and the holy place and
[1:07:31] the holiest of Holies right there so he
[1:07:33] could actually go from the north thank
[1:07:35] God in our age we can go to the north
[1:07:37] from the north and we can enter in them
[1:07:39] but we have to enter we shouldn't go
[1:07:40] obviously through the east gate and hit
[1:07:42] these baptism the altar and further into
[1:07:44] God right so that's exactly how it was
[1:07:46] set up that's why so the north that's
[1:07:48] why they give it a little bit better
[1:07:50] picture here by the grace of God this is
[1:07:51] how I was actually set up in as far as
[1:07:54] beauty you have all these entrances here
[1:07:55] and there's the north side and that
[1:07:57] image was set on the north side right
[1:07:59] here's another image of the hope hope
[1:08:00] you guys can grasp this
[1:08:02] go online check it out east east north
[1:08:05] and south all those right there and that
[1:08:08] image was set right above there right
[1:08:12] now is Ezekiel's temple to plan the
[1:08:15] plant the floor plan for Ezekiel's
[1:08:16] temple but now was it so bad that there
[1:08:19] was an image sent in Idol set in front
[1:08:22] of this north gate was that bad enough
[1:08:26] and God brought the Prophet to the house
[1:08:29] of God and he brought me to the door of
[1:08:33] the court and when I looked behold a
[1:08:35] hole in the wall they had completely
[1:08:37] sealed the worshipers out there not
[1:08:45] leading them to the Holy Ghost they're
[1:08:47] not getting into salvation they had not
[1:08:49] healed the sick the lame the halt
[1:08:53] spiritually naturally they have not got
[1:08:55] him there so he's looking well jump
[1:08:59] let's skip that one and then he said
[1:09:01] unto me son of man dig now in the wall
[1:09:03] and when I had digged in the wall behold
[1:09:05] a door they had masonry in front of the
[1:09:08] wall this thing is not no one is getting
[1:09:12] in here remember they all the prophets
[1:09:16] right here just just listen to the
[1:09:17] Prophet I mean I mean we believe the
[1:09:20] message right and there's a couple
[1:09:23] stories that always keep with me one was
[1:09:25] brother Jesse here brother Jesse went we
[1:09:28] got an invitation he went down to preach
[1:09:30] in North Carolina and he preached the
[1:09:31] service and down there they said they
[1:09:34] said brother that was the best service
[1:09:35] we had in 30 years sighing and crying
[1:09:38] for repentance for what couple hours
[1:09:40] brother 30 minutes solid they said was
[1:09:44] the best service day in 30 years and a
[1:09:47] man went up to brother Jesse he said
[1:09:50] brother Jesse and I asked for Jesse
[1:09:51] phone I could share this lesson I talked
[1:09:53] to my if you wanted to okay the man will
[1:09:57] have to brother Jesse said brother you
[1:09:58] have the voice he says you have the
[1:10:01] delivery and you have the word he says
[1:10:04] but you're not getting in they'll never
[1:10:06] let you in why'd they say that Tim
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:17] now we're dealing with the door the
[1:10:20] church is closed
[1:10:21] Ezekiel eight nine and I would not have
[1:10:26] taught this because I needed I just
[1:10:28] needed one thing to click I just needed
[1:10:29] to understand one thing and then the
[1:10:31] rest would flow so I searched and looked
[1:10:33] and by the grace of God is it's in the
[1:10:36] message of the hour zq 8 9 and he said
[1:10:47] unto me darling and behold I he says you
[1:10:50] found the door you don't through this
[1:10:51] masonry you're not there these bricks
[1:10:53] down your construction tradesman he said
[1:10:56] now you know he's they open that door or
[1:10:57] walk in and tell me what you see first
[1:10:59] thing you see and he said to me go in
[1:11:02] and behold the wicked abominations that
[1:11:04] they do here go in and see okay
[1:11:08] look at the outward signs man there's
[1:11:10] something wrong in here Bo as we enter
[1:11:12] in now to the sanctuary to God's house
[1:11:15] what is wrong and so I went in and saw
[1:11:19] and behold every form of creeping thing
[1:11:23] and a bomb little beasts and all the
[1:11:26] idols of the house of Israel portrayed
[1:11:28] around upon the wall roundabout
[1:11:32] interesting this this is what he saw you
[1:11:35] know what he saw was the exact same
[1:11:37] thing that God created in Genesis 1 and
[1:11:40] God said on what the sixth day let the
[1:11:43] key let the earth bring forth living
[1:11:45] creature after his kind animal creeping
[1:11:47] thing and the beasts of the earth after
[1:11:50] his kind that was so and God made the
[1:11:52] beasts the earth after his kind in the
[1:11:54] kalam and everything that creepeth upon
[1:11:56] the earth after his kind he's bringing
[1:12:00] things these are natural things now I
[1:12:02] watched some videos on animals and on
[1:12:05] insects you know what their entire
[1:12:07] purposes to stay alive and they must
[1:12:11] consume one another to stay alive they
[1:12:16] set traps they hunt it
[1:12:22] it is and it is the animal nature they
[1:12:26] want to conquer because they have to
[1:12:30] fill their own bellies it's all them if
[1:12:34] two if a lion and tiger standing next to
[1:12:37] each other and let's say they're friends
[1:12:39] and an antelope runs there do you think
[1:12:42] that lines like you know tiger that's
[1:12:44] that's that's you know III yesterday you
[1:12:47] can have that one go get it it's every
[1:12:50] man for themselves yes that's the nature
[1:12:54] of this day the things that come out of
[1:12:59] this day I'm not talking up there when
[1:13:01] God creates his children I'm talking
[1:13:03] about earthly things carnal things
[1:13:05] fleshly things right now it also jumps
[1:13:10] now back to the New Testament revelation
[1:13:11] and so Rome is one for the wrath of God
[1:13:14] is revealed from heaven against all
[1:13:15] unrighteousness and ungodly and
[1:13:18] righteous of men who hold the truth in
[1:13:20] unrighteousness he says because that
[1:13:21] there may be known of God is manifest in
[1:13:24] them for God has issued it unto them
[1:13:26] right
[1:13:27] he said now think about think about what
[1:13:29] guy what what what Paul is revealing
[1:13:30] here he's revealing something here for
[1:13:34] the invisible things of him from the
[1:13:35] creation the role are clearly seen being
[1:13:37] understood by the things that are made
[1:13:39] even his eternal power and it's God who
[1:13:42] knows God is showing them his Godhead
[1:13:44] there's one God what through nature and
[1:13:46] that is what the SU and that proves
[1:13:49] there's one God we taught that here
[1:13:50] before correct he says not only is he
[1:13:52] one God he says but he has he all his
[1:13:55] power look at creation and tell me
[1:13:56] you're an atheist really let's just talk
[1:13:59] about that let's reason amongst
[1:14:00] ourselves okay I met a quite a few
[1:14:04] because that when they knew God they
[1:14:06] glorified him not as God just like Moses
[1:14:10] did they're just like those people and
[1:14:12] he gave them bread teeth they glorified
[1:14:14] a man instead he says neither we're
[1:14:17] thankful but became vain in their
[1:14:18] imaginations and their foolish heart was
[1:14:21] darkened professing themselves to be
[1:14:23] wise they became fools Jesus and changed
[1:14:26] the glory of the incorruptible God into
[1:14:28] an image made like to corruptible man so
[1:14:33] there's an image of
[1:14:35] laughter both men anyone going back to
[1:14:39] Revelation 13 ecumenical World Council
[1:14:41] of Churches an image to her man
[1:14:45] does everything so not always a just man
[1:14:50] it's men it is a system he says
[1:14:56] corruptible men to birds and four-footed
[1:14:58] beasts and creeping things well brother
[1:15:01] this is all fine and dandy what the
[1:15:02] prophets say we're gonna get to that by
[1:15:04] the grace of God he says now with the
[1:15:08] nicolin-san doctrine and that brother
[1:15:11] jess sister Lydia Malachi someone some
[1:15:15] brains
[1:15:15] he says mo mo dog nation amalgamation
[1:15:21] thank you praise be to God that's why
[1:15:23] you have little big brothers absolutely
[1:15:27] he says algum ation with the Michael
[1:15:30] Arrington doctrine and the alga nation
[1:15:32] of Christianity which had to look that
[1:15:33] up Automation is the Uniting he said the
[1:15:36] uniting of Christianity was Babylonian
[1:15:38] ISM he says the net results had to be
[1:15:41] wet Ezekiel saw in chapter 8 10 once we
[1:15:46] found this quote now now I know now it
[1:15:50] starts to open up what is the problem
[1:15:54] before judgment hits the first thing
[1:16:00] we're not talking about the route we're
[1:16:01] talking about the first thing and he
[1:16:05] also goes what the revelations 18 he
[1:16:08] says and he cried mightily with a strong
[1:16:10] voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen
[1:16:11] is fallen to become the habitation of
[1:16:13] devils and a hold of every foul spirit
[1:16:15] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[1:16:17] thing hateful bird I'm sorry he says for
[1:16:20] every nation have drunk of the wine of
[1:16:21] the wrath of her fornication absolutely
[1:16:23] he says and this was in the house of God
[1:16:26] and they didn't want anyone to find out
[1:16:28] what was in there so they sealed it all
[1:16:30] up and said hey you know we have an
[1:16:32] image just look at this guy for a little
[1:16:34] bit just keep your focus right there
[1:16:36] don't worry about what's going on in the
[1:16:38] inside behind the scenes right everybody
[1:16:42] okay so we saw these things we know it's
[1:16:45] Nicoletta nism right
[1:16:48] now look look what look what he ate look
[1:16:49] now look what he sees after that and
[1:16:51] they stood before them seventy men of
[1:16:54] the Ancients of the house of Israel and
[1:16:56] in the midst thereof stood jazz a jazz
[1:17:00] nya the son of chiffon or chiffon
[1:17:02] chiffon or hutch whatever with every man
[1:17:06] his censer in his hand and thick clouds
[1:17:07] of incense went up look they were
[1:17:09] praying they're worshipping God but what
[1:17:13] does he see he sees a group of men and
[1:17:19] then he said in him then he then said he
[1:17:22] unto me son of man hast thou seen what
[1:17:24] the angels of the house of Israel do in
[1:17:26] the dark notice its darkness what we're
[1:17:28] in Laodicea I wonder if this was a flash
[1:17:33] of light
[1:17:34] I was it takes to to see something in
[1:17:38] the dark as a flash of light and if the
[1:17:42] Holy Ghost is leading Ezekiel through
[1:17:44] this I'm guessing there's light there he
[1:17:48] says every man in the chambers of his
[1:17:50] imaginary and they said for they said
[1:17:54] the Lord has seen if not the Lord has
[1:17:55] forsaken the earth right and noticed one
[1:17:59] of them was given a name was actually
[1:18:01] named out he made a name among himself
[1:18:04] hmm interesting we'll skip this now
[1:18:07] let's continue on everybody remember
[1:18:10] that quote the sickest body that I know
[1:18:15] of here today is the bond the so-called
[1:18:17] body of Jesus Christ the sickest body
[1:18:20] people use preachers use this
[1:18:21] continually continuing to tuning right
[1:18:23] let's go to the root well starting way
[1:18:27] back there in the first church the
[1:18:28] people got to thinking and reasoning how
[1:18:30] to improve on God how to make services
[1:18:32] better how to make things better for his
[1:18:34] children and the deeds of the
[1:18:36] Nicolaitans began showing themselves
[1:18:38] then a group formed like 70 men there
[1:18:46] they drifted away from the pattern of
[1:18:49] the world outward all's it takes is just
[1:18:51] one word change in that little leaven
[1:18:53] leavens the whole lump he that let go
[1:18:56] further than one point of the law is
[1:18:57] guilty of all Eve just changed one word
[1:18:59] that'll do it
[1:19:00] he says and when this what Satan
[1:19:03] centered group was formed it began to
[1:19:05] hate and to fight the true believers
[1:19:07] insisting that the aliens were the
[1:19:08] Church of God why does God hate groups
[1:19:12] forming cliques and all these things
[1:19:14] amongst Ministers amongst people in the
[1:19:15] churches he says it destroys he's as a
[1:19:18] bridge hatred if sister hos brother Jose
[1:19:24] brother Jose and and my wife formed this
[1:19:26] group and they're like brother Simon you
[1:19:29] don't need to you don't need to talk
[1:19:30] with us well that may hurts my feelings
[1:19:32] that probably my feelings a little bit I
[1:19:35] say well how come they're buddies I'm
[1:19:37] not and then he says it destroys he says
[1:19:43] it way it creates bitterness the root of
[1:19:46] bitterness that files many so we're
[1:19:49] looking at these rings right the sickest
[1:19:52] body the sickest body and if they're
[1:19:54] still saying the Church of God is still
[1:19:57] sick the sickness is still there there
[1:20:03] is no strength in it now let's go here
[1:20:05] Church age book when the church allows
[1:20:07] herself to move away from the original
[1:20:08] like Adam and Eve death set in there is
[1:20:12] no stress no strength in her she has
[1:20:14] become a monstrosity
[1:20:15] the minute the church moved toward form
[1:20:18] and ceremony tours Watts a priesthood by
[1:20:22] organizing the ministers into a group
[1:20:25] and that decided leadership apart from
[1:20:28] the Holy Spirit and his word that very
[1:20:33] moment death entered in and she started
[1:20:37] to get sick I wasn't a farmer I wasn't
[1:20:44] raised a farmer but I know if you want
[1:20:47] poisoning IV out of your garden you have
[1:20:50] to pull it by the roots one time I was
[1:20:55] over my brother's house and he's got
[1:20:56] these little trees and pawpaw trees I
[1:20:58] said I like to have some of them my
[1:21:00] guard what I do I said I'm not an
[1:21:03] experienced green thumb man I'm a
[1:21:05] plumber
[1:21:07] I want that treat I've ripped her right
[1:21:08] out of the ground the roots shown as a
[1:21:10] dart through the back of my truck
[1:21:12] embarrassing pray for me by the time I
[1:21:15] got home though with the leaves raw when
[1:21:16] virgin to die why because I pulled it by
[1:21:20] the roots
[1:21:21] I should take it by the roots but left
[1:21:24] on dirt and mud I'm ever learning but
[1:21:29] I'm coming to the glory of God we're
[1:21:32] coming back one to the power God what
[1:21:33] our hearts will be turning back to the
[1:21:35] hearts of one of our hollers absolutely
[1:21:37] we will produce another book X
[1:21:39] absolutely praise be to God we're
[1:21:41] learning we're learning but now we need
[1:21:43] to implement we need to understand what
[1:21:45] we've been taught and action there's a
[1:21:47] certain man come to a certain church he
[1:21:49] said we have this problem this problem I
[1:21:51] had this problem this business there's a
[1:21:53] little messed up and he knows every
[1:21:55] quote he's got every quote he's like
[1:21:58] well this this is it but he does not
[1:22:00] know how to apply it
[1:22:01] he's got so many problems it'll make
[1:22:03] your head spin
[1:22:04] you are completely helpless you're going
[1:22:06] I can't fix this but he knows every
[1:22:10] quote when are we going to apply the
[1:22:15] Word of God and not just apply it but
[1:22:18] wait and have faith in it why because
[1:22:21] he's the restorer
[1:22:22] amen we no man can do these things it
[1:22:25] takes God for everything Jesus even said
[1:22:28] he says he said you can do nothing
[1:22:30] without me
[1:22:31] amen praise be to God that's the truth
[1:22:33] any man yes now this is a powerful quote
[1:22:39] power house quote every time I read it
[1:22:42] I'm just singing he says now Christ is
[1:22:44] the head of this Christ is the head of
[1:22:47] his Masonic Kingdom he's the king
[1:22:50] he's the king there is no other daughter
[1:22:53] Gabrus I mean there's no Savior beside
[1:22:55] me he said there's none other but me and
[1:22:58] you cannot organize the kingdom of God
[1:23:01] which Christ is the head you try to put
[1:23:05] wheat sure if a minister tries to put
[1:23:07] his hands into influencing this pastor
[1:23:09] or this brother or if I'm over off of
[1:23:11] land he tries to influence a pastor this
[1:23:13] way or this way you better be careful
[1:23:17] he says you cannot dominate a kingdom
[1:23:20] which
[1:23:21] rice is the head or Solari denominate he
[1:23:24] says because Christ is king and you
[1:23:27] cannot take the intellectuals of a man
[1:23:29] and make an organization to which God
[1:23:31] will govern in other words a man wants
[1:23:35] to make the church well ok sister
[1:23:38] brother you can sing okay now we're
[1:23:39] gonna be my song later and I want you to
[1:23:41] back up because you guys this now let me
[1:23:43] see okay now you have really good
[1:23:44] teaching ability you're gonna be better
[1:23:45] to let the gifts manifest themselves
[1:23:50] amen gifts and callings without Prince
[1:23:53] even but every gift will find their
[1:23:54] place as a pastor's brother but Jesse
[1:23:58] would it be a pastor you sits back as
[1:23:59] individuals come in he has to watch them
[1:24:02] kissed away their actions we have to see
[1:24:06] what they do did they automatically
[1:24:08] start witnessing and started teaching
[1:24:09] Bible studies are they said man brother
[1:24:11] Jesse yeah I can sing a little bit and
[1:24:14] uh if you want me to you know do a song
[1:24:17] I could and Jesse has to wash these
[1:24:19] things and wait for the timing
[1:24:20] everything must hit just because what
[1:24:23] the rest of the body is in need of these
[1:24:25] things we are dependent on the
[1:24:26] leadership of the Holy Ghost amen and
[1:24:29] there's there's the man right there
[1:24:31] brother Jesse he must be on these things
[1:24:34] and the he and he is he says he says you
[1:24:36] cannot take the nuptials a man and make
[1:24:38] an organization which Christ will govern
[1:24:40] therefore any companies any people's any
[1:24:42] groups of a man that tries to organize
[1:24:45] the kingdom of God is going contrary to
[1:24:48] the king he says he says in if they're
[1:24:51] going contrary to the king it would be
[1:24:53] against the king oh my this is a full
[1:24:55] house quote write this one down studies
[1:24:57] put it over a computer put it on your
[1:24:59] wall amen
[1:24:59] he says salvors god it's over it's
[1:25:02] against the king it would be Antichrist
[1:25:06] that's pretty rough he's of off I just
[1:25:09] had a little more voice somebody had it
[1:25:10] he says we made that clear
[1:25:12] it is a Antichrist and if you'll hear me
[1:25:16] a few minutes I'll prove that an
[1:25:18] antichrist spirit tries to take a people
[1:25:21] call them from organization organization
[1:25:23] organizing together which will which
[1:25:25] never was the will of God every local
[1:25:29] assembly is sovereign of itself
[1:25:31] God in God's mind he has a specific
[1:25:34] duty and purpose for brother Jesse's
[1:25:36] ministry and for this local assembly and
[1:25:39] what is it to be lights
[1:25:45] can you save a soul can you anyone no
[1:25:47] but the Bible says you can win them he
[1:25:51] that winneth Souls is wise
[1:25:55] amen
[1:25:56] reproduce yourselves she do amen amen
[1:26:01] allegory says it's that dominating
[1:26:04] spirit that makes the people think that
[1:26:05] we are the bride we're the message of
[1:26:10] the hour
[1:26:13] there's no prettier
[1:26:15] what's that saying that they send a
[1:26:16] bride pride no humility the greatest
[1:26:22] honor to sit with Christ on his throne
[1:26:24] we must walk and try softly man number
[1:26:32] one of the needs and acquaintance was
[1:26:34] organizing in two groups
[1:26:35] number two but within I I have chickens
[1:26:42] all my free-range chickens and the third
[1:26:46] age third age revealed by the spirit of
[1:26:48] prophecy that the worldly church would
[1:26:49] adopt he says Nicolaitans as a doctrine
[1:26:52] this the separation of a clergy from the
[1:26:54] laity grew from the from the biblical
[1:26:56] truth the ours shepherds of local flax
[1:26:59] ruling the flock by the word to the
[1:27:01] deeds of the Nicolaitans
[1:27:02] wherein the clergy set themselves and
[1:27:05] ranks one over the other so once these
[1:27:08] groups are formed all these ministers or
[1:27:12] whoever even the laity well okay I
[1:27:17] really like you I'm gonna fellowship
[1:27:22] more with him than for the Robert
[1:27:24] because I like him more you know in a
[1:27:27] pastor well he's a better preacher but
[1:27:28] John Graham's a better preacher than my
[1:27:32] brother Malachi so I'm gonna invite you
[1:27:33] more and I'm just going to hold you in
[1:27:35] the back brother you stay right there in
[1:27:37] the computer
[1:27:40] these are rankings and what were to
[1:27:45] treat each one equal
[1:27:48] and the pastor must now be in prayer who
[1:27:51] do I invite the preach not have anyone
[1:27:53] in mind
[1:27:53] nah Lord you you put you place that
[1:27:55] brother's heart rate that boats name on
[1:27:57] my heart and leave me
[1:28:00] who-who Lord who's Lord I'm tired here I
[1:28:03] need someone to come and fill a place
[1:28:04] who do you want me who do you want to
[1:28:05] speak who do you want to feed my sheep
[1:28:10] leadership but they rank one another I
[1:28:13] was a wee I forgot to spend a couple a
[1:28:17] day here with sister Connie and got to
[1:28:20] watch and view her life a man who he was
[1:28:23] able to share these things and we're
[1:28:24] talking and how we could go to big
[1:28:26] meetings and if you nee if you if you
[1:28:29] could look at the names there and you
[1:28:31] could discern who's gonna get what day
[1:28:32] and who's gonna preach to services out
[1:28:34] of the five and I mean we're not disturb
[1:28:36] when you have enough December for that
[1:28:37] and there's an there's an issue
[1:28:39] he's decide themselves and ranks over
[1:28:42] one the other which unscriptural forma
[1:28:44] formula then evolved into a priesthood
[1:28:47] that place the clergy between man and
[1:28:48] God trying well brother all as everyone
[1:28:53] is everyone in service eat no no no I'm
[1:28:56] not saying that at all it's a spirit sad
[1:29:00] to say the true vine was not exactly
[1:29:03] immune to this doctrine oh so true
[1:29:06] ordained sons of God who are ministers
[1:29:10] where the Holy Ghost can be influenced
[1:29:11] by this
[1:29:12] absolutely the Prophet said that
[1:29:15] Polycarp was one of them he was a nickel
[1:29:17] 18 that's why I rhiness was chosen to be
[1:29:20] the man he says by that I do not mean
[1:29:25] that the true vine did ever establish
[1:29:27] and then declares an idea has a doctrine
[1:29:29] they never established it as a doctrine
[1:29:31] far from it but that little one of death
[1:29:33] kept sucking at the True Vine hoping
[1:29:35] that it might fall even within the true
[1:29:38] church man of God who are called as
[1:29:40] overseers or pastors we're holding that
[1:29:43] title to mean a little more than just a
[1:29:45] local responsibility groups rankings and
[1:29:51] why are pastors out of their pulpit more
[1:29:54] than they are in it
[1:29:56] why are they traveling everywhere listen
[1:29:58] is trying to do the work of the
[1:29:59] evangelists trying to do the work of the
[1:30:01] missionary though the apostle the
[1:30:02] prophet I'm not talking about a pastor
[1:30:06] going once or twice a year somewhere I'm
[1:30:08] talking when they are exerting
[1:30:10] themselves in putting their influence
[1:30:13] everywhere well I care about the bride
[1:30:18] and stay at home I've got a lot of
[1:30:22] quotes on this a lot of Scripture it was
[1:30:26] not clear it was not the clear
[1:30:29] understanding of Paul and exists in the
[1:30:31] church at that time for Paul said and
[1:30:32] they glorified God in their forgotten me
[1:30:35] no matter what authority Paul had he
[1:30:37] kept the people looking to God from who
[1:30:39] is all authority but the clergy was
[1:30:41] always looking to divine leadership plus
[1:30:44] human and thus giving honor where honor
[1:30:48] was not due and he gave us manna from
[1:30:53] heaven Jesus said that was my father
[1:31:02] with nickel a dozen establish apostolic
[1:31:05] succession placed ministers vote pastors
[1:31:08] voted in I just heard of another issue
[1:31:10] that had come up and it won exactly
[1:31:13] textbook Bible just like this from his
[1:31:17] own words now let's continue on let's
[1:31:21] just read a scripture Zechariah 11 verse
[1:31:23] 15 and the Lord said to be taken to thee
[1:31:26] yet the instruments of a foolish
[1:31:27] Shepherd for lo I will raise up a
[1:31:29] Shepherd of the land which shall not
[1:31:31] visit those that be call off look
[1:31:32] there's no there's no soul travail these
[1:31:35] were not marked by what the in-court
[1:31:38] rider he said they did not care about
[1:31:40] even their own flock what is true
[1:31:44] religion to want to visit the widows and
[1:31:46] what to be a father to the fatherless a
[1:31:48] man a man brings me to God do something
[1:31:51] through someone who really neither the
[1:31:52] needs to help a man not a mercy just
[1:31:55] basic simple things like that give him a
[1:31:58] call do something absolutely
[1:31:59] we shall not visit those that we call
[1:32:02] off neither shall seek the young nor
[1:32:03] heal that which is broken or feed and I
[1:32:06] would stand as still as they shall eat
[1:32:08] the flesh of
[1:32:09] laughing their tailor their claws with
[1:32:10] pieces full of shepherd go to the
[1:32:14] Shepherd that leaveth the flock the
[1:32:18] sword shall be by his arm upon his arm
[1:32:22] I'm sorry and upon his right eye his eye
[1:32:25] for his arm shall be cleaned right up
[1:32:27] and his right eye shall be utterly
[1:32:29] darkened pastures traveling too much
[1:32:32] maybe I love this now in this now where
[1:32:40] we will break down this is Bible this is
[1:32:42] the word of God we're dealing with
[1:32:43] spirits we're deal with the Holy Ghost
[1:32:44] we're dealing with the Antichrist spirit
[1:32:46] right so everything that we're seeing in
[1:32:49] the natural it should be what textbook
[1:32:51] Bible this took place at our church
[1:32:53] right here now in this I declared you I
[1:32:56] praise you that you come that together
[1:32:57] for the better he says but for the worse
[1:32:59] for first of all when he come together
[1:33:01] in the church I hear that they be
[1:33:02] divisions among you what a group swarm
[1:33:04] divisions one of those Nicholas isn't it
[1:33:06] cause divisions among you and I partly
[1:33:09] believe it but notice what comes next
[1:33:13] heresies if you see something like this
[1:33:16] then something false we just heard a man
[1:33:19] preaching he said Jesus had two to
[1:33:22] adoptions he was adopted when he was
[1:33:26] baptized by John the Baptist and he was
[1:33:27] doctored on Mount Transfiguration that's
[1:33:30] not true adoption took place on a mild
[1:33:33] Transfiguration but why are they saying
[1:33:35] these where were these thoughts coming
[1:33:36] from but just if there's anything I say
[1:33:40] raw you correct me absolutely bring me
[1:33:42] in the word show me in the word if I'm
[1:33:44] wrong absolutely I'll make it right for
[1:33:49] there must also be heresies among you
[1:33:51] that they which are approved may be
[1:33:53] manifest um the God allows these things
[1:33:58] to show who the true ministers are
[1:33:59] absolutely and one who can stick with
[1:34:01] the lawyer absolutely stick with what
[1:34:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[1:34:04] leadership of him a man yes sure brother
[1:34:10] Jesse he's out ministering overseas
[1:34:13] there he went on that trip in other
[1:34:15] words what we're dealing with his text
[1:34:16] book Bible everything you see everything
[1:34:18] you've seen the scripture will happen
[1:34:19] exactly as it is written
[1:34:22] he was praying for a demon-possessed
[1:34:24] woman and he said that woman started
[1:34:26] biting his hand and brother Jesse did he
[1:34:28] move his hand like this said well this
[1:34:30] lady is too far it's too much
[1:34:31] he said he kept his hand on the lady's
[1:34:33] head right there started praying
[1:34:34] rebuking a demon in the name of Jesus
[1:34:35] Christ while biting his hand and boom
[1:34:38] she ran out a roll or she fell as she
[1:34:40] was dead and Jesse said textbook Bible
[1:34:43] exactly you hold to the Word of God if
[1:34:47] you see this watcher keep your eyes on
[1:34:49] it because they don't manifest if it's
[1:34:51] that way good or bad now look what he
[1:34:55] says now moving in now we saw the first
[1:34:57] thing they saw these these creeping
[1:34:58] things we saw this as a group of 70
[1:35:00] ministers right amen
[1:35:01] he says now look what he says here is a
[1:35:03] program a program is church age he says
[1:35:05] now you just can't have it Nicol Anton
[1:35:07] setup in the church and not have this
[1:35:09] other doctrine come in to because if the
[1:35:15] Antichrist spirit is there what's it
[1:35:17] going to do it's going to move further
[1:35:20] and further and grow stronger and bigger
[1:35:25] and creep in into the crevices it's
[1:35:30] going to manifest more and what's he
[1:35:33] talking about the doctrine of Balaam all
[1:35:39] right now I'm bringing this forth as a
[1:35:43] teacher that is your pastor you that is
[1:35:48] that is who have to if there's anything
[1:35:50] I say you take it to the to the pastor
[1:35:52] and if I'm wrong he will correct it by
[1:35:55] the grace of God
[1:35:55] now Ezekiel 8 13 and he said to me yet
[1:35:59] yet be again turn thee yet again and see
[1:36:04] how greater abominations of this worse
[1:36:06] than worse than groups worse than NIC
[1:36:08] elations then he brought me to the door
[1:36:11] of the gate of the Lord's house which
[1:36:12] was towards the north and behold there
[1:36:14] sat women weeping for Tammuz so here we
[1:36:20] are now there's women weeping for Tomas
[1:36:23] right the Saturnalia which means son
[1:36:27] stop is the long week program of sorry
[1:36:30] pagan festival has a program of the west
[1:36:33] of the winter solstice which began in
[1:36:35] December 17th as
[1:36:36] was seen to be rising further to the
[1:36:39] south and the thought of visit dying and
[1:36:40] by December 25th the ancient world
[1:36:43] solstice he says it could be recognized
[1:36:46] at the beginning that turned northwards
[1:36:47] again it was said to be the reborn and
[1:36:49] therefore is proclaimed as the birthday
[1:36:52] of the Sun god deity all the known Sun
[1:36:56] deities were born on December 25th
[1:37:00] Krishna
[1:37:02] Osiris so Horus
[1:37:04] Hercules Dionysus or whatever Bacchus
[1:37:07] Tomasz even they claimed Christ behind
[1:37:15] all pagan deity worship stands Satan
[1:37:17] himself he accepts honor in whatever
[1:37:19] name he wished we wish to call him bail
[1:37:23] Moloch Venus Odin you name it Dagon I'm
[1:37:29] wrong whatever male or female he says it
[1:37:32] matters not he wants worship and he
[1:37:34] wants glory he says the most important
[1:37:37] day in the life of any saint worshipper
[1:37:39] is their annual birthday for roughly
[1:37:43] four thousand years the soleus has been
[1:37:45] been by proxy the day of satan's
[1:37:48] birthday celebration because he has
[1:37:50] desired the original s-tronic religious
[1:37:52] pattern and deceived all mankind to
[1:37:55] worst to them to worship the Sun right
[1:37:58] now let's continue on here by the grace
[1:38:03] of God so Balaam here began to commit
[1:38:08] God Israel to commit fornication and he
[1:38:11] goes in to bail poor and all these
[1:38:13] things you know how Balaam was paid and
[1:38:15] this and that and the and the prophesied
[1:38:17] he said he could not get Israel to sin
[1:38:20] so he had to he had to pull a trick on
[1:38:22] him and he invited them into this
[1:38:24] worship right into this festival into
[1:38:27] this holiday and he now the Prophet is
[1:38:29] dealing with Balaam and Israel
[1:38:31] committing fornication he says do you
[1:38:32] know that physical fornication is the
[1:38:33] same spirit that lies with the
[1:38:35] organization organized religion I said
[1:38:38] the spirit of or occasion in the spirit
[1:38:40] of organization and all fornicators will
[1:38:42] have a place and like a fire that is
[1:38:44] what God thinks of organization yes sir
[1:38:46] the horner daughters will be in the lake
[1:38:48] of fire correct
[1:38:50] absolutely now let's jump down now as
[1:38:52] these work with bayon look when he jumps
[1:38:54] down - he's dealing with the same mode
[1:38:56] and now in this part here
[1:38:59] he says notice now notice that constant
[1:39:02] Constantine gave special feasts and the
[1:39:04] people they were all pagan feasts with
[1:39:06] new names taken from the church as it
[1:39:08] was some Christian rights were taken and
[1:39:10] abused with pagan ceremonies he took
[1:39:12] this worship of the Sun God and changed
[1:39:15] it to what the Esso and God instead of
[1:39:16] celebrating December 24 bring on
[1:39:19] December 21st which is when they used to
[1:39:21] celebrate the Feast of the Sun God but
[1:39:22] they put it now - December 21st 25th and
[1:39:25] called it the Sun God's birthday he says
[1:39:29] but will you know he was born in April
[1:39:35] he says he was born in April when life
[1:39:39] comes forth not in December and they
[1:39:41] took the Feast of Astaroth or s tyre or
[1:39:44] whatever and called it the Easter
[1:39:46] celebration when Chris Christian is
[1:39:48] supposed to celebrate the death and
[1:39:49] resurrection the Lord actually was a
[1:39:50] pagan feasts - this guy returned bless
[1:39:53] you now this we just hid that there by
[1:39:58] the grace of God let's see here he says
[1:40:00] then still crisp and and still worship
[1:40:02] Christmas he says and it's Santa Claus
[1:40:05] and all these oh mercy still pagan
[1:40:06] feasts added to it that's they that's
[1:40:09] just all there you are invited you
[1:40:12] invited Balaam
[1:40:13] when you invite Christmas in your house
[1:40:16] they have you have the doctrine of
[1:40:18] Balaam among you there it is Oh God just
[1:40:20] reveal it father see the birthday from
[1:40:23] April until so-and-so he says now I want
[1:40:27] to follow he says I want to follow the
[1:40:29] Morningstar Christ I want to follow any
[1:40:31] and find any find my Jesus to stay I
[1:40:34] want to get away from all this year
[1:40:35] Christmas tinsel on things because some
[1:40:38] day is going to burn with unquenchable
[1:40:40] fire and all those who are in tolerating
[1:40:43] with it will be burnt with it very
[1:40:46] dangerous things there's more quotes but
[1:40:49] we'll continue on so in other words
[1:40:51] these women in this inner court were
[1:40:53] celebrating what pagan feast days or
[1:40:56] pagan days and when I first come into
[1:40:59] messages in 2002 2001 there at the end
[1:41:02] my pastor
[1:41:04] Brooks was militant against Christmas
[1:41:07] and that's how I've held my standard by
[1:41:10] the grace of God now but that's let your
[1:41:14] pastor lead and guide you on that now
[1:41:17] let's continue on Ezekiel 8 verse 15
[1:41:21] going now further into this house of God
[1:41:24] what else is wrong then said he unto me
[1:41:30] hast thou seen this O son of man turned
[1:41:33] the yet again and see thou greater
[1:41:35] abominations in this you mean he gets
[1:41:38] worse I mean something greater can
[1:41:41] beyond this thing he said so and he
[1:41:46] brought me to the inner Court of the old
[1:41:47] house and behold at the door of the
[1:41:50] temple the Lord behold between the porch
[1:41:52] and the altar were 25 men what another
[1:41:54] group a more devious group a more
[1:41:57] sinister group oh my goodness my more
[1:41:59] deceptive a group with their backs
[1:42:03] towards the temple of the Lord and their
[1:42:07] faces towards the east and they worship
[1:42:10] the Sun towards the east my goodness who
[1:42:14] is a master this question at this time
[1:42:19] who was running the house of God Sun

[1:42:51] of time with this pastor driving around
[1:42:55] with him you know and this and that and
[1:42:57] the pastor told me I heard that the
[1:43:00] pastor said he says one day they're in a
[1:43:02] car together riding and the man kept
[1:43:05] trying to tell him to do a certain thing
[1:43:06] said brother so-and-so you need to do
[1:43:09] this because I think the people will be
[1:43:10] blessed I really think you need to start
[1:43:12] doing this maybe change this this this
[1:43:14] and the brothers kept saying no brother
[1:43:17] I'm
[1:43:17] I'm doing it I'm doing it this way
[1:43:19] because of a reason this is the way I
[1:43:22] run the show here the Lord has put this
[1:43:23] on my heart I'm running this way and he
[1:43:25] kept he said he's like kept on going it
[1:43:26] this and this and this and this he said
[1:43:28] you need to change this he said all of a
[1:43:30] sudden Holy Ghost said this is a Jesuit
[1:43:32] and he turned to him and said you're a
[1:43:35] Jesuit priest aren't you the man said
[1:43:37] turn over turn and pull over the car and
[1:43:38] let me out
[1:43:40] the pastor turn over the car turn the
[1:43:43] car over to the road let him out he got
[1:43:44] out and he never saw the man again in
[1:43:47] the message of the hour brother Mike's
[1:43:53] mcklusky his wife his wife sister
[1:43:59] Netanya got married there and when she
[1:44:02] was younger they sat under a certain
[1:44:04] minister and the minister her pastor
[1:44:07] told her the story that a group of men
[1:44:09] had come and met with him a group of men
[1:44:12] had come and met and said we want to
[1:44:14] make you one of the biggest names in the
[1:44:16] in this the message we're gonna give you
[1:44:18] all the big meetings we're gonna do this
[1:44:19] this this we're gonna make you a big
[1:44:20] name he says but we just want you to
[1:44:22] hold a little bit off on preaching on
[1:44:24] this and and preaching on that and what
[1:44:28] do you think we have a deal and I pastor
[1:44:29] said get out of my church Versailles
[1:44:36] your conspiracy theorist now the Bible
[1:44:40] said so the Bible says what the Catholic
[1:44:43] Church has infiltrated the message the
[1:44:45] our 50 years preaching this word of God
[1:44:53] where is a book of Acts church where is
[1:44:56] a church that that has all nine
[1:44:58] spiritual gifts operating something's
[1:45:02] still not right
[1:45:03] have our hearts been fully turned back
[1:45:06] to there it's coming it is coming he
[1:45:14] says what he says I will restore saith
[1:45:17] the Lord
[1:45:19] you can't stop God no one can stop the
[1:45:24] Holy Ghost and God just allows these
[1:45:27] things that happen why because what
[1:45:29] there's a there's a quote he
[1:45:31] said you can't beat your type you can't
[1:45:38] beat who you are if there's superseded
[1:45:43] amongst is because there was service
[1:45:44] eating eating in the true Church of God
[1:45:48] were Adam and Eve and the Holy Ghost
[1:45:50] we're just rang and a service snuck in
[1:45:52] you can't beat that type they have to be
[1:45:54] here and they can't stop you you will
[1:46:02] overcome you are overcomers God is
[1:46:08] worthy yeah I'll get it straightened out
[1:46:10] he was saying that what do you what do
[1:46:13] you think he has a descent for with a
[1:46:14] shout voice and Trump as a lion and if
[1:46:21] you look at lions when they roar is to
[1:46:25] show their property to let the other
[1:46:27] ones know he's here and he might be a
[1:46:31] little jealous because it was revealed
[1:46:35] in action as he says he's a lot of new
[1:46:37] name ease that name is what jealousy he
[1:46:41] says it's just what he's a jealous God
[1:46:43] absolutely even st. Paul he called the
[1:46:46] minor parties as I'm jealous for you
[1:46:47] with a godly jealousy yes praise be to
[1:46:50] God amen hallelujah yes
[1:46:54] Sun worshipers in the temple controlling
[1:46:57] everything who worship that Sun
[1:47:02] Catholics the highest form of
[1:47:06] spirituality there is as the Prophet
[1:47:08] said worshipping that Sun God enough
[1:47:18] amen let's tan Saints
[1:47:28] and to make the spiritual application
[1:47:30] with it you know what the bishop said
[1:47:32] the bishop said we have a right to do
[1:47:33] this because he is the son the SU n of
[1:47:36] righteousness look they're pulling from
[1:47:40] a scripture malachi wat for one and two
[1:47:46] uh well they got a loophole like they
[1:47:49] did on Father Son Holy Ghost in Matthew
[1:47:51] 20 19 sure they got a loophole they have
[1:47:53] some kind of spiritual application you
[1:47:55] see but the Bible said in the mouth of
[1:47:57] two or three witnesses every word be
[1:47:59] established but you see those little
[1:48:02] things has come so they can pick into
[1:48:05] that and be like that God knowed it
[1:48:06] before the foundation of the world where
[1:48:08] they got it the scriptural application
[1:48:10] God put these little things in here to
[1:48:12] stumble yes so the false can come in and
[1:48:15] say look I'm gonna pull the scripture
[1:48:17] here look it's okay I found this
[1:48:19] scripture on it one scripture maybe even
[1:48:22] two but Saints running we run things
[1:48:24] from Genesis to revelations because
[1:48:27] that's what sons of God do we think what
[1:48:30] he said what eat the whole book yes but
[1:48:37] you know those little things has come to
[1:48:39] where they can pick it up and to be that
[1:48:42] God knowed it before the foundation the
[1:48:43] world where they got described became
[1:48:46] because he is the S Oh n of God we'll
[1:48:48] just take that little pagan sons s UN's
[1:48:51] birthday and make it the S Oh ends
[1:48:53] birthday because he is the son of
[1:48:54] righteousness uh-huh you know
[1:48:57] Protestants still fall for that
[1:48:59] something like that sure take it right
[1:49:01] away from the scripture somewhere - like
[1:49:02] that let's just stop for minute let's
[1:49:05] bow our heads
[1:49:07] Deerling father Lord Jesus we love you
[1:49:09] Lord we hope this little journey you've
