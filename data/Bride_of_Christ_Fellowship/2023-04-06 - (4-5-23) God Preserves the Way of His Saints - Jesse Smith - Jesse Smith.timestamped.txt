[3:48] let's take our Bibles here tonight by
[3:50] God's grace holiday it's good to be in
[3:51] the house of the Lord it's good to be
[3:52] with you again I'm sure they missed you
[3:54] on Sunday and I got to listen to Simon's
[3:56] message it's a beautiful message the
[3:58] lord gave you on Sunday that was a real
[4:00] blessing I told him what a blessing that
[4:02] was to me thank God for individual
[4:04] Revelation praise God thank the Lord God
[4:06] for that Hallelujah truly blessed by
[4:09] that if you wanted to go to proverbs
[4:13] 2 verse 8.
[4:17] you know when Simon preached the last
[4:19] time I wrote down three scriptures
[4:21] afterwards I'd just like to take a
[4:23] general thought tonight I'm not really
[4:24] going to teach on any Doctrine we'd say
[4:26] just like some a general principle that
[4:28] God preserves the way of his Saints I'm
[4:30] just going to preach a general message
[4:32] on that just an encouraging hopefully
[4:34] it's an encouraging message praise God I
[4:36] plan to come here and encourage all the
[4:38] saints tonight by God's grace
[4:40] and uh
[4:42] I guess I was encouraging over the
[4:43] weekend with that event my wife put on
[4:46] I'm going to share just a couple of
[4:47] testimonies on there just how it helped
[4:49] me
[4:50] and uh just gave me a
[4:52] just a fresh perspective on God's grace
[4:55] that God is keeping us in the way God is
[4:59] faithful to us
[5:00] and God is doing his perfect will praise
[5:03] God in our lives and we're very thankful
[5:04] for that
[5:06] Hallelujah he preserveth the way of his
[5:08] Saints
[5:10] now the word preserve means to watch it
[5:13] means to guard from loss or injury
[5:17] so God is watching your way
[5:20] to make sure you're not you don't lose
[5:22] and you're not injured
[5:24] he's got
[5:26] also means he's your Fortress
[5:29] this implies you have a fortress around
[5:31] you
[5:33] Hallelujah
[5:35] also means you're in his custody
[5:39] Hallelujah right Naomi's girls are in
[5:42] her custody tonight sure
[5:44] my children and or my wife and my
[5:47] custody praise God they're in our care

[6:26] message or not Lord they know there's
[6:28] been a change Lord God because of their
[6:30] love for you something's been quickened

[7:01] you chose fallible men
[7:02] father Lord it was your plan Lord you
[7:04] designed it so father God we just want
[7:06] to go along with your plan Lord God and

[7:37] and Lord bless his service in Jesus
[7:38] Christ's name the saint said
[7:40] amen God bless you you're being seated
[7:42] praise God
[7:45] I really don't know how long this will
[7:47] be you know I was thinking it might not
[7:48] be too long but you never know
[7:51] um
[7:52] so yeah again I sound like everybody had
[7:54] a good time in the Lord and my wife said
[7:55] the kids really enjoyed the Sunday
[7:56] School on Sunday night too
[7:59] so I was very happy about that and
[8:01] hopefully they're being really really
[8:03] trained up well and think about that
[8:05] sister how much they know compared to us
[8:07] when we were raised in denomination
[8:08] think about that
[8:10] that's a pretty great blessing
[8:12] so I'm rejoicing and
[8:14] I thank the Lord for that I appreciate
[8:15] Simon being able to Humble himself like
[8:17] that and and teach the children praise
[8:19] God
[8:20] so they're just little sponges you know
[8:22] you just keep pouring water on them and
[8:23] they're going to soak up all the all the
[8:25] truth they can get by God's grace and
[8:26] you adults too right let's not put
[8:28] ourselves as these hard stones that you
[8:30] know we can't receive anything let's
[8:32] let's be sponges too by God's grace
[8:35] in fact that was part of the testimony
[8:36] on Sunday you know I preached I just
[8:37] preached a second part in their little
[8:39] basement down there
[8:40] I preach the second part on the finished
[8:42] mystery of God and afterwards the
[8:44] brother the leader he's 59 and he was
[8:46] crying and he just said
[8:48] he said brother Jesse at 59 years old I
[8:50] feel like I've lost so much time he said
[8:52] but at the same time he said I'm seeing
[8:54] things I've never seen before
[8:57] and the Bible
[8:58] makes sense it's been a reality he's
[9:01] like I love I drew pictures about the
[9:02] three parts of man and the timeline from
[9:04] the Rapture to the Future home they have
[9:06] a big chalkboard up there I took the
[9:07] chalk and I got a picture of it if you
[9:10] want to see it uh
[9:12] and he was just crying he's like to
[9:13] think
[9:14] he said everyone I know in the Amish
[9:16] community he said they can't get out of
[9:18] their old ways but to think God chose me
[9:20] at 59 years old to see this
[9:23] he said and God gets to teach me fresh
[9:25] revelation oh church that's that's just
[9:28] it that's eternal life praise God that's
[9:30] it's just so so special and so thankful
[9:33] for God's grace
[9:35] I really appreciate awesome going down
[9:36] there with me that was a real blessing
[9:38] brother and got the fellowship and
[9:40] it's better than being alone praise God
[9:42] so I really I really appreciate that
[9:44] we're thankful for him by God's grace
[9:47] so uh
[9:49] yeah wonderful weekend there and like I
[9:51] said last night 17 we're baptized
[9:53] I guess I'll just share a few
[9:55] testimonies here briefly that kind of
[9:57] just may want to preach this tonight you
[9:58] know
[9:59] regarding this Amish group remember this
[10:02] is a half of the church that came out of
[10:05] the Amish community so
[10:07] there was an entire Amish church and
[10:10] just so there's thunderstorms tonight so
[10:12] you could lose the power if that happens
[10:14] I'll just turn on my flashlight
[10:16] and still see the preacher up here
[10:19] I won't do any scary faces kids
[10:22] I never well I guess I get to I get
[10:24] emotional sometimes so the faces
[10:25] probably can be intense sometimes
[10:27] they won't be that that scary
[10:29] but uh you know so what happened was an
[10:32] entire Amish Church left the Amish
[10:34] community and for them it's like you're
[10:35] cut off from your family money they
[10:37] never want to talk to you again
[10:39] so they come out but they're still under
[10:40] a leader who is legalistic
[10:43] and so like I told you uh the church
[10:44] prayed and they they anointed every
[10:47] chair in the basement with oil
[10:51] and they said the Holy Spirit move uh
[10:53] upon this this preacher who's still a
[10:56] legalist because they were just starting
[10:57] to read brother Ram's Supernatural books
[10:59] and
[11:00] and hear about water baptism and that
[11:02] that next day the preacher come in and
[11:04] he was all confused he's like I don't
[11:06] even know what's going on I can't even
[11:07] preach and they said the sermon didn't
[11:09] make any sense
[11:11] and then I come the next Sunday and just
[11:13] laid it out you know through the word of
[11:14] God and it all made sense and they you
[11:16] know they were rejoicing and
[11:18] um
[11:20] and so that's what's happened and then
[11:22] last night for the Austin and I uh there
[11:25] was another Amish group that came to
[11:27] support this Amish group
[11:29] and they drove six hours
[11:32] from Indiana
[11:35] when was the last time you or I drove
[11:38] six hours for a water baptismal ceremony
[11:42] and they were just in Alabama on Sunday
[11:47] so Sunday they drove from from Alabama
[11:50] back up to Indiana and then Tuesday they
[11:52] drove from Indiana to Ohio
[11:55] and brother Austin could see some of
[11:57] them like were actually shouting and
[11:59] because right now the church that we're
[12:01] working with the 17 they're just they're
[12:03] not totally free yet
[12:05] because
[12:06] you know the Amish community with their
[12:08] legalists like you can't shout her you
[12:10] can't dance
[12:11] you're in the flesh if you do that
[12:16] and then you know and we feel bad if we
[12:19] get a little happy or something like
[12:20] that or dancing around you know it's a
[12:22] joy it's joy unspeakable full of Glory
[12:24] praise God we need more freedom of the
[12:26] Holy Spirit
[12:27] but I thank God for what we have
[12:29] I Feel Free by God's grace but that's
[12:31] how it is and so you know this Indiana
[12:34] group was kind of cheering them on or
[12:36] praising the Lord cheering them on and
[12:38] um
[12:40] it was just really beautiful to see well
[12:42] one of those gentlemen the oldest not
[12:44] the oldest but one of the oldest guys
[12:46] he came up to me he said brother Jesse
[12:47] he said thank you for doing these
[12:49] baptisms I said I don't do nothing
[12:51] do nothing he said but for 18 years I
[12:54] believe the message and he said
[12:57] I've been praying for 18 years for an
[13:00] Amish Church to receive the message and
[13:02] it hasn't happened until tonight
[13:06] church let me just encourage you
[13:08] I mean this really encouraged me don't
[13:10] give up
[13:11] don't give up on any promise of God
[13:15] 18 years
[13:17] 18 years
[13:20] and so that just blew me away like wow
[13:22] Lord our church has only been we're
[13:25] coming up on 17 in June we've only been
[13:28] here 17.
[13:30] and I thought it was interesting too I
[13:31] baptized more in that church than I
[13:33] think we even have at our church
[13:39] and it was just really special
[13:41] to see what God is doing there and
[13:45] it's you know I told him I said I want
[13:47] to come back I want to I want to keep
[13:48] them from evil spirits you know
[13:51] so I hope the Lord will help us do that
[13:53] but just be encouraged you know 18 years
[13:54] if he can if he can wait 18 years I can
[13:57] weigh 18 more by God's grace
[13:59] and you just got to trust the Lord you
[14:01] know we just have to trust the Lord
[14:05] and even this like I was telling Austin
[14:06] you know when I first got invited to go
[14:08] down there I was so tired you know I
[14:09] didn't really want to go down there I'm
[14:10] like oh they're not going to receive it
[14:12] and you know I was just tired and I
[14:14] guess I was just a little bit
[14:16] selfish or tired or pouty or whatever
[14:20] and then to see what you know
[14:23] you know and this brother kind of had to
[14:25] just keep calling me till I called him
[14:27] back because I was just I get you know
[14:28] I'm working I'm preaching I don't call
[14:30] people back right away all the time and
[14:33] I'm not perfect that guy
[14:34] I'm tired
[14:36] but anyways he kept calling me and then
[14:38] to see you know he only took two sermons
[14:40] and 17 people get baptized
[14:43] it just showed me like it doesn't really
[14:45] like God God is going to do what he
[14:47] wants to do and I just want to fit into
[14:49] his plan
[14:51] and it's it's like in other words this
[14:53] whole situation just showed me like God
[14:55] is sovereign
[14:57] God is going to do what he wants to do
[14:59] and when he wants to use your church
[15:01] he's going to come get you to use you I
[15:03] want to end with some quotes on that
[15:05] brother Ram says that God knows right
[15:07] where you are at
[15:08] I just want to encourage you that I say
[15:09] that in a good way
[15:11] God God's going to use you
[15:13] and he's going to come get you to do it
[15:16] all right think about David David's out
[15:17] there in the field
[15:19] God had to come get it hey come come on
[15:21] in here there's a prophet here to anoint
[15:23] you
[15:23] I mean God's going to find where you're
[15:25] at Moses tried to hide on the back of
[15:27] the Desert god came looking for him
[15:30] Hallelujah church if God wants when God
[15:33] God does want to use you and when God
[15:34] does use you he's going to come find you
[15:37] so don't ever fret don't ever feel like
[15:39] oh God you know he knows you're not
[15:41] watching me he don't care God knows
[15:42] exactly where you are
[15:44] God knows exactly I'd baptize more in
[15:46] one day than I have for how many years
[15:48] combined sister and brother well okay
[15:51] think of all the baptism we've done
[15:52] these last five or six years why
[15:53] baptized the more last night than the
[15:55] last five to ten years combined
[15:57] just amazing because God does what he
[16:00] wants and has taught me just on a
[16:02] greater way just to respect God even
[16:05] more just respect God respective his
[16:08] timing and when he wants to use you he's
[16:10] going to come find you
[16:11] all right so I just want to start with
[16:13] that and then also I think Naomi heard
[16:15] the story you know on Saturday at that
[16:16] event uh seeking Whole Health
[16:19] the keynote speaker was a young man he
[16:21] must have been 30 or 40. I don't know
[16:24] 40 year old men are young men let me
[16:26] tell you that they're young and strong
[16:28] they got a lot of life left
[16:30] uh
[16:31] I don't remember how old he was but
[16:33] anyways the whole I'll just summarize it
[16:34] you know he was out and he was out in
[16:36] California and he was a a military
[16:40] police officer and his health just
[16:43] deteriorated so he was like a hundred
[16:44] pounds he was almost as tall as me I
[16:46] don't know
[16:48] we've got two kids one on the way maybe
[16:50] I'll say he's 30. I'll say he's 30. you
[16:52] know
[16:54] and he tried everything he was on so
[16:56] many medications and none of them helped
[16:58] him so the last thing he tried was going
[17:00] to an organic lifestyle
[17:03] and he also separated from Wi-Fi
[17:06] he separated from everything and he
[17:08] finally started seeing Improvement when
[17:10] he went to the organic lifestyle I'm not
[17:12] even talking about organic in the store
[17:13] I'm talking about straight from the
[17:15] ground organic
[17:17] I'm talking no labels
[17:20] right because they could lie on those
[17:21] labels I talked about that a few weeks
[17:22] ago they can lie on their labels
[17:24] right
[17:26] and that's when he recovered a lot of
[17:28] his health now he still has good days
[17:29] and bad days
[17:31] um but he would he's so sensitive to all
[17:33] these chemicals that he had to
[17:36] build his own house out of Timber and
[17:38] then his insulation is sheep wool
[17:42] so not not insulation like we get
[17:44] because there's all these chemicals in
[17:46] it
[17:46] and everything in his house is natural
[17:50] like it's not a mattress because if you
[17:51] buy a mattress it's got chemicals All In
[17:54] he can't have that
[17:55] he has to pack his food even if he goes
[17:57] to a wedding he won't even eat food at a
[17:59] wedding he'll pack his own food
[18:00] he can't even wash his hands with soap
[18:03] because all the chemicals in the soap so
[18:04] he has to make his own soup
[18:07] I wonder if he I wonder if he shakes
[18:09] people's hands I actually wasn't
[18:10] watching him
[18:11] but anyways
[18:13] um
[18:14] and now the whole point of this is that
[18:16] he moved from California to Ohio to
[18:19] build this house
[18:21] and he suffer he has suffered beyond
[18:23] measure physically
[18:25] suffered wanted he prayed to die like I
[18:28] said last week with Elijah Elijah put a
[18:30] prayer request in God can I die
[18:32] that's my Saints can you pray for me
[18:34] that I'll die uh that's a that's his
[18:36] private class well this young man wanted
[18:38] to die too he found no hope in life
[18:42] but God restored his strength and then
[18:44] now he's got his house built there and
[18:46] he's only got electricity in one room
[18:47] imagine that electricity in one room
[18:50] the kitchen
[18:51] and running water in one room the
[18:52] kitchen now I went out to the Amish I
[18:54] went to an Amish guy's house and I went
[18:56] in the bathroom and they had no running
[18:57] water in the bathroom
[18:59] and no heat in the bathroom that was on
[19:01] Sunday
[19:02] that was and it smelled too
[19:04] there was no Plumbing
[19:06] so that was it reminded me of Guyana
[19:09] being out there on the campgrounds where
[19:11] there's no Plumbing out in the
[19:12] campgrounds anyways that's how they live
[19:14] you know
[19:16] so anyways fast forward now he's got
[19:18] this house and everything
[19:19] he's finally starting to be encouraged
[19:21] and then a tornado comes through
[19:24] and it knocks down his entire uh Woods
[19:28] now he wanted to get away from people so
[19:30] he built his house in the woods and my
[19:32] wife can correct me later if I'm wrong
[19:33] on this
[19:35] yeah there's already some mistakes
[19:36] that's how all my stories go
[19:38] the only thing you can trust when I
[19:40] preach is the the actual the Bible that
[19:42] I quote
[19:43] and or if a quote if I read it off the
[19:45] screen if not you can't trust it fully
[19:48] so that's why the Bible says prove all
[19:49] things
[19:51] but I try to understand you know the
[19:53] best I can I get the gist of the story
[19:55] hopefully but anyways
[19:58] a tornado knocked down his Woods or par
[20:00] part of his Woods and he was frustrated
[20:03] with that can you imagine you know wow I
[20:06] just got this I finally got my help back
[20:07] and now this
[20:09] well then one night he's awake right
[20:12] he looks across the the woods where it
[20:14] was knocked down and someone's house is
[20:16] on fire the neighbor's house is on fire
[20:19] so he has his health back enough where
[20:21] he can run over there and knock on the
[20:22] doors and scream he said it's kind of
[20:24] like you brother but but more advanced
[20:27] and wakes them up and uh it's a couple
[20:30] and three kids
[20:34] the roof's on fire they get them out of
[20:36] the house and just a few minutes later
[20:38] when the the fire department gets there
[20:40] the house is burned down to the ground
[20:45] and I just took that as just you know he
[20:48] used it to show how God was in control
[20:50] of every part of his life no church he
[20:52] don't even believe the message right
[20:53] which I hope I believe he's a Christian
[20:56] if God's in control of that much of his
[20:58] life how much more is he in control of
[21:00] Our Lives as well
[21:02] right think about awesome you know going
[21:04] out to Arizona it was all ordained to
[21:06] God
[21:07] I mean all these steps all of our
[21:09] actions and I'll say this all of our
[21:11] difficulties are all ordained of God
[21:14] it's to make us more like Christ praise
[21:17] God to trust him more to develop the
[21:20] character of Christ
[21:22] and who would have thought you know if
[21:23] if it would have been up to him he would
[21:25] have said I don't want any pain I'll
[21:26] just be a military police officer
[21:29] right but he had to suffer suffer suffer
[21:31] and then finally get into a good spot
[21:33] and then suffer some more natural
[21:36] disaster like you would like if a
[21:38] tornado hit by my house I'd think Lord
[21:39] are you mad at me right at me
[21:42] lord well and then God uses him to save
[21:45] lives so that's again like just like the
[21:48] point I'm making like I just feel like
[21:50] my life God is ordering my life
[21:53] God's ordering that man's life God is
[21:55] ordering your life as well
[21:58] and we are to trust the Lord
[22:01] okay so I just thought I'd share those
[22:03] two things you know 18 years waiting for
[22:04] the people to come out God answered
[22:07] you know moving across the the country
[22:09] natural disasters God is in control of
[22:12] everything
[22:14] you know God calling the littlest I
[22:16] think I'm the littlest message preacher
[22:17] in all of Ohio to baptize 17 people he
[22:20] could I mean he could have had anybody
[22:21] do it
[22:23] me
[22:24] God is in control of everything praise
[22:26] God so we just want to give God the
[22:28] glory so
[22:29] let's look at this for a thought for a
[22:31] few moments here like I said I don't
[22:32] know how long I'll preach you that
[22:33] usually goes longer than I think but
[22:34] maybe be shorter this time we'll see
[22:37] so we looked at the scripture of
[22:38] Proverbs 2 verse 8 God gives or God
[22:41] preserves the way of his Saints
[22:45] and again this means to
[22:47] to watch God watches the way of his
[22:49] Saints aren't you glad God's watching
[22:51] you tonight
[22:52] Hallelujah the Bible said he doesn't
[22:54] slumber nor sleep
[22:56] God doesn't go to sleep and say oh I'll
[22:58] let I'll let Jesse figure it out on his
[23:00] own today I'm just going to take a
[23:01] little nap
[23:02] now he doesn't do that he is he has his
[23:05] holy spirit so great it can watch over
[23:07] all of his Saints of course we know he
[23:09] dispatches Angels do that too
[23:11] but God is watching all of our ways amen
[23:15] you know I was I thought of that how God
[23:17] preserves the way of a Saints like we
[23:19] said with Moses god preserved him even
[23:21] as a murderer God still watched over him
[23:26] for 40 years we'd say I'm sure there was
[23:28] good I'm sure there was good years with
[23:30] Sephora you know but there were some
[23:32] rough years of arguing you know there's
[23:33] High tempers and like brothers says high
[23:35] temperatures in wilderness
[23:38] um
[23:39] but God preserves him you know 40 years
[23:42] and 40 years later God brings him to the
[23:44] ministry that he always thought he was
[23:47] called for
[23:49] what an encouragement to us that we just
[23:51] got to trust in God
[23:52] like I've said that many times you know
[23:53] God didn't call Abraham until he's 75.
[23:56] God didn't call Moses till he was 80.
[23:59] and sometimes we get impatient God when
[24:00] are you going to use me or God when is
[24:02] something going to happen just be
[24:03] patient praise God
[24:04] just be patient God is preserving your
[24:07] way
[24:08] your path God is preserving you on the
[24:11] path he's keeping you on the path
[24:15] praise God you know he said like David
[24:17] David was preserved you know he was
[24:18] preserved from his brothers over there
[24:20] where he had such a as we saw with that
[24:22] play he had such a fellowship with God
[24:25] he learned to worship God by himself
[24:26] within the Sheep
[24:28] Hallelujah God preserved him out there
[24:30] as a worshiper so that when he comes to
[24:32] the battle with Goliath nobody can talk
[24:34] him out of it because he's already had a
[24:36] genuine experience with God God
[24:38] preserved him from the Lion
[24:40] God preserved him from a bear now God's
[24:42] preserved you from what God is what does
[24:43] God preserve you from
[24:45] praise God
[24:46] maybe bitterness
[24:48] broken heart you know broken home broken
[24:50] family what does God preserve you from
[24:52] death
[24:54] what does God preserve you from
[24:57] now let me share this one too one of the
[24:58] Amish families two weeks ago their
[25:01] daughters five and she got her hand
[25:03] caught in a meat grinder
[25:05] and all she has left is a pinky
[25:08] I shook her and I said what's wrong did
[25:09] you break your hand sister your finger
[25:11] she said no I got it caught in the meat
[25:13] writer
[25:16] just has one pinky left and the parents
[25:18] are like God can God can restore her
[25:20] hands and finger back
[25:22] oh that's right
[25:25] I talked to the dad I said I'm so sorry
[25:27] sir he said he said well you know we
[25:29] were sad too but then that same day with
[25:31] that Indiana that Indiana Family the
[25:33] Indiana Amish group three of their
[25:35] teenagers were in a were hit they were
[25:37] in a car accident two of them died
[25:39] that same exact day
[25:42] so he said we were we were so
[25:45] heartbroken but at the same time we
[25:47] thank God she's still alive
[25:50] I thought think of how merciful god is
[25:54] you know the three of them are they're
[25:56] in the buggy or the horse and buggy and
[25:57] the car hits them two of them two
[25:59] teenagers they're gone never seen them
[26:01] again to get to heaven
[26:04] and that God allowed that
[26:06] to encourage his family at least she's
[26:08] alive
[26:10] and I guess you know within those two
[26:11] weeks she's got her cast on there and
[26:12] she's still she likes to bake cakes so
[26:15] she she baked up this cake iced it and I
[26:18] guess her mom shared the text with
[26:19] everybody and nothing's gonna slow this
[26:21] little girl down
[26:24] you know just this is life just these
[26:27] are these are these are battles these
[26:28] are struggles we go through but God is
[26:30] preserving his people
[26:34] so David they're preserved from a lion
[26:36] preserved from a bear how many car
[26:38] accidents have we been preserved from
[26:39] right
[26:41] how many uh how many awful financial
[26:43] decisions have we been preserved from
[26:45] yeah right
[26:48] you think about just God's protection
[26:50] over our lives Daniel was preserved
[26:53] right even as a young child you know he
[26:55] and even as a young teenager we'd say he
[26:57] was preserved from defiling himself like
[27:00] he just wanted to be clean in God's eyes
[27:02] and so God preserved him and God gave
[27:04] him wisdom to say let's do a test I'll
[27:06] just eat the pulse I'll just eat
[27:08] vegetarian
[27:09] uh and then compare me after was it 10
[27:12] days or seven days compare me with these
[27:15] other uh Babylonian teenagers and
[27:17] scientists and let's see who looks
[27:18] better
[27:20] and God preserve him see church if if
[27:23] you want to live right God's going to
[27:24] help you live right
[27:26] if you want God to preserve you and
[27:28] protect you from sin God will do it like
[27:31] I was telling with Austin you know last
[27:32] night I was telling him I said I said
[27:33] brother I don't even know how many times
[27:35] I have prayed and said God protect my
[27:37] children
[27:38] I've just said God preserve him I plead
[27:41] with you I beg you protect them protect
[27:44] their bodies protect their minds we've
[27:47] had a lot of I should say a lot but
[27:48] we've had numerous
[27:50] emergency room trips these last few
[27:51] years but God has been gracious to us
[27:53] God has been gracious but that's my
[27:55] constant prayer I'm praying that God
[27:57] would preserve them and that's what I
[27:59] believe God I believe God likes that
[28:00] praise God that's what job did he
[28:01] constantly gave sacrifice for his
[28:03] children constantly
[28:05] that's what we can do as Christians we
[28:07] can say Lord preserve my steps preserve
[28:09] me praise God hallelujah
[28:13] and so God preserved him as a Young Man
[28:15] wanting to be pure
[28:17] and undefiled
[28:19] and then God preserved her as he got
[28:21] older God preserved him in the Lion's
[28:23] Den
[28:24] God
[28:25] was very gracious to Daniel praise God
[28:28] because Daniel stood for him Hallelujah
[28:31] and it's not legalism church but just
[28:33] remember he prayed three times a day
[28:35] you know he got on his knees three times
[28:37] a day
[28:38] and asked God for his grace ask God for
[28:41] his Mercy
[28:42] and that's that's a testimony how many
[28:45] want to have a testimony like that
[28:46] praise God that's it I mean this is a
[28:48] man who trusted in the Lord
[28:50] and then we can see well God's rewarder
[28:52] of those who diligently seek him God
[28:53] didn't have to preserve him
[28:55] but God in his grace preserved him
[28:58] because he was one who diligently sought
[29:00] the Lord
[29:03] and you know church with that we could
[29:05] go down through every person in the
[29:06] Bible how God preserved their life and
[29:08] even back to Moses god preserved him
[29:10] when he was in a a basket in the Nile
[29:12] River from all those alligators and your
[29:14] crocodiles glory amen God knows how to
[29:18] preserve his people praise God
[29:20] and God has preserved you God has
[29:22] preserved me
[29:23] I want to read this let's go to First
[29:25] Samuel 2 verse 1 this is of course
[29:27] Hannah's Prayer after God gave her a son
[29:31] Samuel a prophet on top of all that
[29:34] the branch that's an extra blessing
[29:35] first Samuel 2 1.
[29:41] this is her prayer
[29:45] or I'm sorry her song of worship yeah
[29:47] this is her song of rejoicing yeah it's
[29:49] a prayer of rejoicing yeah there you go
[29:51] praise God
[29:52] first Samuel 2 verse one and Hannah
[29:54] prayed and said my heart rejoiceseth in
[29:57] the Lord and my horn is exalted in the
[29:59] Lord my mouth is enlarged over my
[30:02] enemies because I rejoice in thy
[30:06] salvation now was it easy for her to get
[30:08] to that spot no remember it was year
[30:11] after year coming up and all the women
[30:13] looking at her no child no child no
[30:16] child and then even
[30:18] her husband's other wife speaking bad
[30:21] about her
[30:22] but there's a purpose behind it praise
[30:24] God God was going to preserve her
[30:26] Hallelujah God was going to give her a
[30:28] testimony Hallelujah
[30:31] and God exalts enlarges her mouth
[30:34] another her testimony verse two there is
[30:36] none holy as the Lord there is none
[30:39] beside thee
[30:40] neither is there any Rock like our God
[30:44] so think about that you know her life
[30:46] was so unstable
[30:48] she didn't have the desire of her Hearts
[30:50] like she wanted to but after God answers
[30:52] her prayer now she feels like I'm
[30:53] standing on a rock
[30:55] isn't that awesome
[30:56] God you know he'll show you that he
[30:58] really is your rock really the whole
[31:00] time you've been standing on a rock
[31:01] praise God really the whole time but now
[31:03] you just recognize it
[31:05] now you recognize it but when God's eyes
[31:06] it was already in God's mind it was
[31:08] already finished before the foundation
[31:09] of the world
[31:10] but now she just recognize it God's my
[31:13] rock I'm standing on the rock of the
[31:14] Lord
[31:17] talk no more so exceedingly proudly let
[31:20] not arrogancy come out of your mouth for
[31:22] the Lord is a god of knowledge and by
[31:24] him actions are ways he's testing us uh
[31:28] like like with Hezekiah right sometimes
[31:30] God will be near to us and sometimes
[31:31] he'll draw his anointing back to see
[31:33] what we'll do in that opportunity
[31:35] he's testing us to see how we'll respond
[31:38] verse 4 the bows of the mighty men are
[31:41] broken
[31:42] I'm gonna try to get down to verse 10.
[31:43] and they that stumbled are girded with
[31:45] strength Hallelujah see Church don't be
[31:47] discouraged you stumble them a bit God's
[31:49] going to strengthen you praise God
[31:51] Hallelujah just because you stumble a
[31:52] little bit doesn't mean you're not going
[31:53] to finish doesn't mean you're not going
[31:55] to get your your stride back or your
[31:56] Victory back praise God
[31:58] he's going to uphold you even when you
[32:00] stumble he's going to help you get your
[32:02] feet back under you praise God
[32:04] amen
[32:05] verse five they that were full have
[32:08] hired out themselves for bread and they
[32:10] that were hungry see so that the baron
[32:12] hath born seven and she that hath many
[32:14] children is wax feeble
[32:16] the Lord killeth and maketh alive he
[32:19] bringeth down to the grave and bringeth
[32:20] up
[32:21] so here we see how God deals with with
[32:24] certain people sometimes he makes you
[32:25] poor sometimes he makes you rich
[32:27] sometimes he takes people down sometimes
[32:29] he raise the people up it's the Lord's
[32:31] doing
[32:33] verse 7 the Lord maketh poor and maketh
[32:36] Rich he bringeth low and lifteth up
[32:38] verse 8 he raise up the poor Out of the
[32:40] Dust and lifted up the beggar from the
[32:42] dunghill to set them among princes think
[32:45] of Joseph my in the prison in the pit
[32:49] right and to make them inherit the
[32:51] Throne of Glory for The Pillars of the
[32:54] Earth are the Lords and they have set
[32:55] the world upon them in other words never
[32:57] give up
[32:58] in other words don't lose hope praise
[33:00] God don't don't let yourself and myself
[33:03] let us not become hopeless let's have
[33:05] hope in God hallelujah
[33:07] because God can take us out of the most
[33:09] awful place and then exalt us to a place
[33:11] on high
[33:13] amen
[33:15] verse 9 he will keep here's where I want
[33:18] to go to verse 9. he will keep the feet
[33:20] of his Saints and the wicked shall be
[33:22] silent in darkness for by strength shall
[33:25] no man Prevail I like that he keeps the
[33:28] feet of your saint of the Saints
[33:31] he's going to make sure you don't fall
[33:33] on the path
[33:34] he's going to make sure you don't fall
[33:36] down and embarrass yourself
[33:38] speaking of runners or races
[33:40] all right thank God I don't think I ever
[33:42] did that all my recent I don't think I
[33:43] ever fell down by God's grace he kept my
[33:45] feet in all those natural races but he
[33:47] wants to do that in all of our spiritual
[33:49] races praise God that we don't stumble
[33:51] on the journey right
[33:54] now the Bible does say the righteous
[33:55] followeth seven times but the Lord
[33:57] raises them up praise God
[33:59] so even if we do have a stumble don't be
[34:01] discouraged raise up try again God will
[34:03] keep your feet next time praise God
[34:05] trust in the Lord amen
[34:07] Hallelujah verse 10 is where I want to
[34:09] end there the adversaries of the Lord
[34:11] shall be broken to pieces
[34:13] Out of Heaven shall he Thunder upon them
[34:16] the Lord shall judge the ends of the
[34:18] Earth and he shall give strength unto
[34:20] his King and exalt the Horn of his
[34:23] anointed praise God
[34:25] so we see here a humble destitute woman
[34:28] now and she has a mouth enlarged with
[34:32] praise to God church that's what I
[34:34] believe God is uh he accomplishes that
[34:36] in our lives God lets us go through
[34:37] difficult times so that when we get the
[34:39] victory when we get a testimony then we
[34:42] can truly understand God's grace we can
[34:44] truly Praise Him and we can have a great
[34:46] testimony praise God
[34:48] a great testimony I think of my my
[34:51] mother you know she got the overcoming
[34:53] uh victory over cancer I think she was
[34:55] 38 or 39.
[34:57] that was and that that has been her song
[35:00] God Has enlarged her testimony
[35:04] now first she's 72.
[35:07] right so 32 through 34 years that's been
[35:10] her testimony
[35:11] that God's A Healer
[35:13] that God answers prayer if you if you
[35:15] cry out for a miracle God will give you
[35:17] a miracle might not be the one you want
[35:18] but God will give you a miracle praise
[35:20] God
[35:21] she didn't even know say what kind of
[35:23] Miracle she just asked God for a miracle
[35:26] well I think it's beautiful that God
[35:27] raises up the poor and God has raised my
[35:29] mama from poor conditions
[35:32] Hallelujah she's able to give people
[35:34] vehicles and stuff like that
[35:36] right
[35:37] right who would have thought who would
[35:39] have thought of all of our relatives
[35:41] God is in control
[35:46] you know God anointed my mom to give
[35:47] Lydia Malachi a truck
[35:49] it didn't cost him anything
[35:51] now my mom would be the poorest of all
[35:53] of us and she's giving away trucks
[35:56] just God's mercy God's mercy
[36:00] uh now Psalm 66 let's go there Psalm 66.
[36:03] I just want to read a few scriptures
[36:05] try to encourage you tonight by God's
[36:06] grace
[36:08] I know I shared some you know
[36:10] truth I mean those are all true stories
[36:12] they're real serious stories
[36:16] but I just thought I felt led I'd just
[36:17] preach on those here tonight
[36:25] Psalm 66 okay I'm going the wrong way
[36:27] psalm 66.
[36:32] I want to get to verse 9.
[36:46] Hallelujah let's start at verse uh
[36:52] let's just start a verse say oh bless
[36:54] our God ye people and make the voice of
[36:56] his praise to be heard
[36:58] that's why I always want to have loud
[37:00] worship Services I know there's times
[37:01] for Whispering I know soft prayerful I
[37:05] like I like the most time to be let's be
[37:06] loud about it praise God because God has
[37:08] done so much for us
[37:10] should we come here after all God's done
[37:11] for us
[37:13] and be quiet to the Lord
[37:15] that all he's done like I was telling
[37:17] Austin I get emails almost every day
[37:18] from people from Kenya or Uganda we
[37:21] haven't had any food for three days
[37:24] and they're not fasting Church they're
[37:25] not trying to fast
[37:27] he said all we had is hot water
[37:29] now I tell them sometimes I said well I
[37:30] don't know I mean people could be lying
[37:32] to me just to get the money I don't know
[37:33] but then some of them send me pictures
[37:36] and so let's just be thankful in all God
[37:38] has done for us praise God let's
[37:39] remember to give thanks
[37:41] and God has done great things for us
[37:44] and God is in other words God has
[37:45] blessed us that we can be a blessing to
[37:47] other people
[37:48] praise God and I know I know you do and
[37:51] I know I do too
[37:52] there's 30 minutes wow

[39:04] psalms 27 verse 1. Psalm 27 if you

[39:08] that I think she listened to it today or
[39:10] yesterday

[39:13] rapture
[39:15] I told I gave her some sermons on that
[39:19] video teaching videos on that
[39:23] yeah this is the scripture belram uses
[39:25] for the Rapture because we'll get to it
[39:27] where God God will hide us the Rapture
[39:29] is a hiding place
[39:32] it's hiding the bride of Christ from the
[39:34] destruction
[39:37] upon the world
[39:38] the Godless sinful World God's going to
[39:41] hide us from that destruction praise God
[39:43] he's going to hide Us in him praise God
[39:47] verse one the Lord is my light and my
[39:49] salvation Whom Shall I Fear is anybody
[39:52] afraid of anybody tonight
[39:55] you don't have to be
[39:56] you don't have to be I know we all we
[39:58] all go through our trials
[39:59] like I said spirits of fear come on
[40:01] honest sometimes at nighttime or daytime
[40:04] but really if God is our strength we
[40:06] don't have to be afraid
[40:08] the Lord is I like that the Lord is the
[40:10] strength of my life how am I going to be
[40:12] strong enough to make it God's going to
[40:15] be my strength
[40:16] he's my strength praise God
[40:20] of whom shall I be afraid
[40:23] so we don't have to be afraid tonight
[40:25] there's nothing to be afraid of
[40:26] because the Lord is on our side
[40:29] who shall lay any charge to God's elect
[40:32] Hallelujah if God be for us who could be
[40:34] against us
[40:36] praise the Lord
[40:40] trying to encourage the Saints tonight
[40:41] by God's grace verse two when the wicked
[40:43] even my enemies and my foes come upon me
[40:45] to eat up my flesh they stumbled and
[40:47] fell so David saw David saw his enemies
[40:50] come after them and as they come they
[40:51] fall down
[40:52] and they don't get to him talk about
[40:55] Amazing Grace
[40:56] right
[40:58] talk about Amazing Grace all this all
[40:59] the struggles look like they're going to
[41:00] come and I'll just say that's I mean
[41:02] that
[41:03] that's a lot of Our Testimony in America
[41:04] I mean it looks like people say all the
[41:06] doomsday in America right oh is this
[41:08] going to be the end is this going to be
[41:09] the end is 2020 going to be the end is
[41:10] Kobe going to be the end like all these
[41:12] doom day prophecies or all these doom
[41:14] day things when they come upon us they
[41:17] all stumbled and fell to this date
[41:20] stumbled and fell God has preserved us
[41:24] right
[41:25] kovid's going to get you or uh monkey
[41:28] pox is going to get you or whatever you
[41:31] know all these enemies
[41:33] we've got to trust in the Lord if the
[41:34] Lord is our strength the Lord is our
[41:36] song let's trust in him
[41:39] like you know and they know what they're
[41:41] doing like I was I was looking at news
[41:43] this week and there's a video on from
[41:45] Newsmax that said uh a deadly bacteria
[41:49] in America I'm like oh let me click on
[41:52] that where is that at
[41:53] and then it just turns out like it's
[41:54] this deadly bacteria that's only it's
[41:57] only contacted in uh in hospitals with
[41:59] really really sick people
[42:01] and the Anchor's like well whoo well
[42:02] that's good news that I don't have to
[42:04] worry about that
[42:05] I'm like yeah why was I worried about
[42:06] that but just the the headlines make you
[42:09] think oh there's a deadly bat now
[42:10] there's a deadly bacteria
[42:12] and we're affected by those things
[42:15] right but the Bible says God will cause
[42:17] the enemies to stumble before they get
[42:19] to you
[42:20] amen just like David and Goliath right
[42:23] before glad you get there
[42:24] the word of God stopped Goliath praise
[42:26] God
[42:27] though and host should Camp against me
[42:29] my heart shall not fear the war should
[42:32] rise against me and this will I be
[42:33] confident
[42:34] what that their enemy is going to be
[42:36] stopped no matter how much opposition
[42:38] comes my way God is going to protect me
[42:42] verse four one thing I love this verse
[42:43] one thing I have desire to the Lord that
[42:45] I will seek after that I may dwell in
[42:47] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[42:48] life see church we just can't get enough
[42:50] of church
[42:52] right
[42:53] and like this weekend if we think oh man
[42:55] there's a lot of services really that's
[42:56] not a lot of services praise God
[42:59] because the the heart of the believer is
[43:01] to constantly be with his people and be
[43:03] with God's presence
[43:05] that's the one desire a Psalm of David a
[43:09] manner for God's Own Heart
[43:12] because he wants to behold the beauty of
[43:14] the Lord and inquire in the temple
[43:19] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[43:21] me in his Pavilion
[43:23] yeah that's the that's the Rapture
[43:24] description so brother Ram uses that
[43:26] verse in the time of trouble God will
[43:29] hide you in his Pavilion
[43:32] all right in the secret of his
[43:34] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[43:37] me up upon a rock
[43:40] so God's going to hide you in a secret
[43:42] place and he's going to set you on a
[43:43] rock not a sinking sand
[43:46] and this is the rapture scripture how
[43:48] many want to stand on the rock of Christ
[43:51] Hallelujah
[43:52] in the time of trouble that's when he'll
[43:54] hide you that's when he'll protect you
[43:57] Hallelujah
[43:59] verse six and now shall my head be
[44:02] lifted up above my enemies round about
[44:03] me therefore will I offer in his
[44:05] Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing
[44:08] yea I will sing praises unto the Lord
[44:11] hallelujah here oh Lord when I cry with
[44:13] my voice have mercy also upon me and
[44:15] answer me
[44:16] when thou said as seek seek ye my face
[44:19] my heart said unto you Thy Thy face Lord
[44:22] will I see now think about that with our
[44:23] meetings coming up this is a time we can
[44:26] seek God
[44:27] and we have to I believe God is asking
[44:29] me to seek his face more during this
[44:31] time
[44:31] praise God or else I would not have
[44:33] wanted to do these meetings
[44:35] when was the last time God said seek my
[44:38] face to you and then you and I responded
[44:42] see like this is a season to really seek
[44:44] God this is a season to draw close to
[44:46] God
[44:47] Hallelujah
[44:49] did we realize that let's not forget
[44:51] that there's Seasons we need to spend
[44:53] more time with the Lord
[44:54] Hallelujah I know that's the theme of
[44:56] almost every sermon right let's draw
[44:58] closer to God I want a closer walk with
[44:59] God I'm going to come up for a closer
[45:01] walk who doesn't want a closer walk with
[45:03] God but there are seasons where
[45:05] it's that time it is that time to see
[45:07] God
[45:09] time to be seeking after God's face
[45:13] in other words for the perfect will of
[45:15] God for a situation
[45:18] these are just such beautiful promises
[45:20] verse 9 hide not thy face far from me
[45:23] put not thy servant away in Anger thou
[45:25] has been my help
[45:26] leave me not neither forsake me o God of
[45:29] my salvation when my father my mother
[45:31] forsake me then the Lord will take me up
[45:33] brother amen could shout a good Amen to
[45:35] that one praise God
[45:37] Hallelujah
[45:39] when you're forsaken the Lord will he'll
[45:41] fight for you praise God
[45:43] he'll fight for you teach me thy way in
[45:46] verse 11 O Lord and Lead Me in thy in a
[45:48] plain path because of my enemies that's
[45:49] what I want a plain path praise God a
[45:51] simple straight forward plain
[45:53] bible-based path Hallelujah amen
[45:57] Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of
[46:00] mine enemies for false Witnesses are
[46:01] risen up against me and such as breathe
[46:03] out cruelty I had fainted unless I had
[46:05] believed to see goodness of the Lord in
[46:08] the land of living wait on the Lord be
[46:10] of good courage and he shall strengthen
[46:11] thine heart way I say on the Lord
[46:14] how many ever hear does anybody ever
[46:16] feel like your heart's given up or faint
[46:17] the Bible said God will strengthen your
[46:20] heart praise God
[46:22] just wait on God even if you don't feel
[46:23] it just trust God God's going to
[46:25] strengthen it praise God
[46:26] just trust God he's going to make you
[46:28] stronger right wait on the Lord he'll
[46:30] renew your strength
[46:32] praise God wait on God be of good
[46:35] courage you know I was listening to this
[46:36] uh Malachi and I were I think Malachi
[46:38] might hurt we're listening to this
[46:39] political commentator today and there's
[46:41] a certain uh it's a certain mindset and
[46:45] it's it came from a guy who was a
[46:46] prisoner of war during Vietnam
[46:49] and he said there he actually was in a
[46:51] Vietnam prison for years and survived
[46:54] but he saw he saw three kinds of
[46:56] attitudes in in the in the
[46:59] uh in the in the prisoner camp
[47:01] and only one of them allowed the people
[47:05] to survive so he saw all his comrades
[47:07] die
[47:09] except the ones who had this mindset
[47:12] so the first mindset is the worst
[47:13] mindset there's no hope we're never
[47:15] getting out of here all those soldiers
[47:16] died
[47:17] if they took that mindset of
[47:20] hopelessness
[47:22] now the other mindset was they set they
[47:25] set their
[47:27] they set their Hope on a certain date
[47:28] we'll be out by Christmas was one of
[47:30] them did you hear that okay
[47:34] um and they had
[47:36] they had it okay well I'll be out by my
[47:39] by my birthday or I'll be out by next
[47:41] year
[47:42] and when that when that specific date
[47:44] came and went
[47:46] they they lost hope and died
[47:49] now think about that that's why no man
[47:51] knows the day or the the hour right in
[47:54] other words we're in this for a life
[47:55] praise God we're in this until he comes
[47:56] whether I go to the Grave or whether I
[47:58] go to meet him in the air I'm waiting on
[48:01] Jesus praise God
[48:02] but the attitude that got got them out
[48:04] was uh it was brutal honesty about
[48:08] conditions
[48:09] but yet also having a never give up
[48:12] attitude
[48:13] amen
[48:15] so
[48:16] the one the one idea oh I'm open for
[48:18] Christmas they would ignore all the
[48:20] symptoms they would ignore the beating
[48:22] they would ignore the chains they would
[48:24] ignore the the
[48:25] uh the the the Modi bread or whatever
[48:28] they were eating they would ignore that
[48:29] and just say oh I'm just hoping on this
[48:31] one day hoping on this one day and then
[48:32] they would eventually lose hope but it
[48:34] was the people who were realistic that
[48:36] they they said this is exactly what I'm
[48:38] going through it's hard but I'm not
[48:40] going to quit those are the only people
[48:41] that survived now may God give us a good
[48:44] lesson in that praise God
[48:46] we like when I preached on that sermon
[48:48] on complaining right I just read that
[48:49] again this week I read it again when I
[48:51] was in my in my devotion time
[48:53] it's okay to complain to God tell God
[48:55] this is exactly what I'm going through
[48:56] but I'm not giving up the Lord is my
[48:58] salvation he is the he's my life he's
[49:01] the strength of my life amen
[49:03] he'll renew my heart praise God
[49:06] Hallelujah the main thing is don't give
[49:08] up praise God
[49:09] keep trusting the Lord
[49:12] wait on the Lord he said be of good
[49:14] courage and God will strengthen your
[49:17] heart how many want to strengthen Heart
[49:18] Tonight God is going to do it praise God
[49:21] he's going to do it
[49:24] now does if God gives you a date or
[49:27] something like that well then yes it's
[49:29] thus saith the Lord you can you know
[49:31] God's going to show up on that date
[49:33] but if God doesn't give you a date you
[49:36] can't put your heart on a date
[49:38] you got to put your heart on God
[49:41] I think I'm going to preach at the point
[49:42] I thought that was really beautiful
[49:44] uh go to Psalm 37 23 you'll be familiar
[49:47] with this Psalms 37. 23 we're close
[49:53] just been noticing the Lord's been
[49:54] giving us some good Psalms scriptures
[49:56] lately these last few weeks

[50:54] you've chosen the right way
[50:56] yes things don't always work out as we
[50:57] want them to but let's trust God
[51:00] 's bringing us to a character he's
[51:01] bringing us to a stature of the image or
[51:04] the statue of the the character of Jesus
[51:07] Christ praise God
[51:09] like Birdman said I can't take Billy
[51:12] Graham's place and Billy Graham can't
[51:13] take my place
[51:15] you know how I found out this week
[51:16] brother Ram was a I have even more
[51:18] respect for brother Brandon because I
[51:19] watched a video on Billy Graham you know
[51:21] what he actually said it was okay to
[51:24] abort babies
[51:25] from rapes
[51:27] and other things
[51:30] and I'm like man this guy if he was a if
[51:32] he was a preacher to manage time a good
[51:33] preacher he really fell away from it
[51:36] just like Oral Roberts these guys fell
[51:38] far
[51:40] he's sitting there with a a suit and tie
[51:43] on slick back hair he's like yeah I
[51:46] believe in abortion's okay if a woman's
[51:48] been raped my brother Austin is a
[51:50] product of that and look at his life and
[51:52] look at his testimony look at him sing
[51:53] for Jesus praise God
[51:56] and sing for Jesus
[51:58] and that man
[51:59] that man
[52:01] money popularity
[52:03] he's got all that and he can't take a
[52:05] stand on the word of God thank God for a
[52:07] prophet who stood on the word of God
[52:10] praise God
[52:15] 's ordered our ways Hallelujah
[52:19] verse 24 though he fall though he fought
[52:21] church he should not be utterly cast
[52:22] down for the Lord upholdeth him with his
[52:25] hand take my hand when I got the
[52:27] strength to stand
[52:30] when you feel like you're gonna fall
[52:31] there's God he's got you just like Peter
[52:33] sinking he's got you
[52:36] he's gonna lift you up
[52:37] he's right there
[52:39] he's right there that's why he didn't
[52:41] fall and embarrass yourself that's why
[52:42] you didn't fall away from the faith
[52:44] because God was right there God
[52:46] preserves the path of the Saints
[52:52] verse 25 now this is true for us right
[52:54] I've been young I've been old yet I've
[52:55] not seen the righteous forsaken nor is
[52:57] seed beg and bread who's whoever here
[52:58] has been on the streets begging for food
[53:00] have you ever been lost
[53:04] okay that's that's begging you about
[53:06] that but that was kind of because of
[53:07] your home life yeah because yeah yeah
[53:09] but I also nice
[53:12] well anybody any anyone else beg for
[53:14] food before

[53:39] and do good
[53:42] and dwell forevermore for the Lord
[53:43] loveth judgment and forsaketh not his
[53:46] sins now look at that now you got Old
[53:47] Testament and New Testament

[55:48] 5 3 so let's turn to the New Testament
[55:54] Luke 5 38 the course is the parable
[55:58] of new wine
[56:00] we don't put new wine we don't put fresh
[56:02] Revelation in in an old heart
[56:05] right now we've seen people fall away
[56:07] that that that's what happened they
[56:09] never got a new heart
[56:11] if the fresh tea preaching on water
[56:13] baptism and godhead and and serpent seed
[56:16] and signs Miracles and wonders and uh
[56:19] the Seven Seals if that doesn't
[56:22] preserve you then you never got a new
[56:24] heart but if you're still here you got a
[56:26] new heart with it too praise God Amen
[56:28] you got a new heart and a new spirit
[56:30] praise God
[56:32] okay new wide in a new bottle praise God
[56:34] oh thank God Hallelujah I'm not an old
[56:36] bottle I'm a new bottle praise God
[56:39] Luke 5 38 but new wine must be put into
[56:41] new bottles and both are preserved
[56:46] that's how God preserves you it gives
[56:48] you a new heart and then he gives you
[56:49] the wine of stimulation of Revelation
[56:52] hallelujah oh that God is he's guided my
[56:55] steps praise God he's ordered all my
[56:57] steps he's not going to let me fall he's
[56:59] not going to let my my my my feet slip
[57:02] praise God
[57:04] he's going to let me dwell in the house
[57:06] the Lord forever he's going to hide me
[57:07] in the time of trouble praise God
[57:09] when my heart's weak and faint he's
[57:11] going to encourage me praise God he's
[57:13] going to lift me up praise God he's not
[57:15] going to let me fall praise God my
[57:17] enemies I'm going to see my enemies fall
[57:18] down as they're approaching unto me
[57:20] praise God Amen that's what God does
[57:22] hallelujah
[57:24] he preserves the way of the Saints
[57:27] amen
[57:31] and this is our testimony we get the
[57:33] fresh revelation of the hour we get a
[57:35] new heart and it preserves us year after
[57:37] year right in a decade I'm coming up to
[57:40] my second decade or I'm over my second
[57:42] decade yeah 2001.
[57:44] second decade 21 years praise God and I
[57:48] feel like I can't even scratch the
[57:49] surface of it you know I still got so
[57:50] much to know so much to understand so
[57:53] many people to share with praise God so
[57:54] many things I want to preach about and
[57:56] teach about praise God hallelujah
[57:59] uh Luke
[58:01] 1733
[58:04] if you want to be preserved your your
[58:06] life preserved you've got to lose your
[58:07] life
[58:08] that's what Jesus says Luke 17 33
[58:11] whosoever shall seek to save his life
[58:13] shall lose it so he won't be preserved
[58:15] if you seek to keep your natural desires
[58:18] of your life and whosoever shall lose
[58:20] his life shall preserve it
[58:23] so now we see now we have a we have
[58:25] responsibility in this God promises to
[58:28] preserve us if we lose our own desires
[58:32] if we crucify our our fleshly lusts and
[58:35] desires every day if we crucify the old
[58:38] man every day God will preserve us
[58:40] praise God
[58:41] what a promise amen
[58:43] remember Jesus said and this was this
[58:46] just struck me while I was preaching on
[58:47] Sunday
[58:48] God says I'm you just got to repent I'm
[58:50] going to give you the free gift of Grace
[58:51] right this is this amazing gift and then
[58:53] he says die every day crew be crucified
[58:55] every day I got this free gift now die
[58:58] crucify your flesh you desires every
[59:00] single day
[59:02] and you can do that because it's a free
[59:04] gift praise God because it's so great
[59:06] because of the Cross because of what
[59:08] Jesus did
[59:09] it should it motivates us to crucify our
[59:12] desires every single day because it's
[59:15] such a great gift amen
[59:17] right receive the gift now die every day
[59:20] but now the world the worldly church is
[59:22] going to tell you receive the free gift
[59:24] and now go make 10 million dollars or
[59:26] whatever right
[59:27] that's what they want to tell you
[59:30] oh yeah get uh speak that
[59:32] mercedes-bender speak it into existence
[59:34] name and claim it
[59:36] right
[59:37] that was different of God's leading you
[59:39] to something right but that's rarely the
[59:41] case in the scripture rarely is the case
[59:45] where do you see Peter say I'm going to
[59:46] speak to that uh Temple and I'm going to
[59:48] have that Temple as my church I'm going
[59:50] to speak to that church that's going to
[59:51] be my church no no you don't see him
[59:54] doing that
[59:55] you see him go to jail you've seen him
[59:56] speak I mean he spoke life to the
[59:58] paralyzed man thank God for that
[1:00:03] but see we have so we have this element
[1:00:06] in preserving Our Lives
[1:00:08] where we got to die to ourselves and it
[1:00:12] allows God of course to work in our
[1:00:13] lives more
[1:00:15] when we die out to ourselves because
[1:00:17] that's that's the gospel Jesus said you
[1:00:19] cannot me you cannot be my disciple
[1:00:21] unless you die every day
[1:00:23] right
[1:00:24] so we're gonna so in other words there's
[1:00:26] gonna be the foolish version we have a
[1:00:27] lot of foolish virgin who never really
[1:00:29] learned to be disciples they just got
[1:00:30] saved at the last moments
[1:00:33] they didn't die every day you know and
[1:00:35] I'm talking about like people like thief
[1:00:36] on the cross people like that I'm not
[1:00:38] talking about foolish versions like a
[1:00:39] lot that actually you know they tried to
[1:00:40] serve God they stood up for the truth
[1:00:42] and they didn't go into homosexuality
[1:00:44] and things like that he spoke against
[1:00:45] that that was good
[1:00:50] but it's this idea of receiving the gift
[1:00:52] of Grace and then you're so thankful for
[1:00:54] that
[1:00:55] you want to Die daily you want to become
[1:00:57] a follower of Christ you want to know
[1:00:58] Christ in his resurrection and also the
[1:01:01] powers resurrection and the fellowship
[1:01:03] of his sufferings
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:06] first Thessalonians 5 23 I remember
[1:01:07] years ago brother Craig preached a
[1:01:09] sermon called this and I couldn't
[1:01:10] remember but he called it
[1:01:12] preserved I think you call it preserved
[1:01:13] it was over in the other sanctuary
[1:01:15] first Thessalonians 5 23. the very God
[1:01:17] of Peace sanctify you holy remember
[1:01:19] sanctify means that make pure
[1:01:21] I think I read that last week
[1:01:25] it says and I pray God your whole spirit
[1:01:28] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[1:01:31] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:35] so God's going to guard your life and
[1:01:36] God Amen God is going to make sure that
[1:01:39] you're blameless Hallelujah remember I
[1:01:41] preach all those all those verses in
[1:01:42] Ephesians and Colossians the bride of
[1:01:45] Christ is Holy and blameless praise God
[1:01:48] she's unreprovable you can't correct her
[1:01:50] because the blood's already perfected or
[1:01:52] praise God the blood's already forgiven
[1:01:54] her
[1:01:56] like we said as though you did it as you
[1:01:58] never did in the first place remember
[1:01:59] last two weeks it's as though you're
[1:02:02] Justified as though you'd like to be
[1:02:03] justified
[1:02:04] like I'm sinless God sees my soul as
[1:02:07] sinless praise God
[1:02:09] that's what the Bible says
[1:02:11] second Timothy 4 18 doing a good job
[1:02:13] back there teenager thank you
[1:02:17] and the Lord shall deliver me and I love
[1:02:18] this from every evil work and will
[1:02:20] preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom
[1:02:24] yet he was going to be beheaded shortly
[1:02:25] after this letter was finished
[1:02:29] now look at that he didn't get delivered
[1:02:31] from the beheading but he said the Lord
[1:02:33] shall deliver me from every evil work
[1:02:35] that means it must have fit into God's
[1:02:37] plan for his life
[1:02:38] right
[1:02:41] he'll preserve me on his Heavenly
[1:02:43] Kingdom
[1:02:44] he was definitely preserved he was
[1:02:45] definitely protected
[1:02:47] in the midst of being a martyr remember
[1:02:49] God had given him prophecy God God gave
[1:02:51] Paul a prophecy after prophecy to
[1:02:53] prepare him for this moment
[1:02:55] right remember agabus said the man who's
[1:02:57] wearing this girdle will go and we'll go
[1:02:58] to Jerusalem right give his life
[1:03:00] God prepared him church God will prepare
[1:03:03] you for your life's calling
[1:03:05] God will prepare you for it
[1:03:09] and he'll preserve you there will be a
[1:03:11] place at the table for you by God's
[1:03:13] grace
[1:03:14] Hallelujah
[1:03:16] and Jude 1 verse 1 Jude 1 verse 1. Jude
[1:03:19] the servant of Jesus Christ and brother
[1:03:21] of James to them that are Sanctified by
[1:03:24] God the Father
[1:03:26] and preserved in Jesus Christ
[1:03:30] and called
[1:03:32] Hallelujah
[1:03:35] where are you preserved Church where
[1:03:36] where does God where does God guard you
[1:03:39] at in Christ
[1:03:42] again that's got to be your soul right I
[1:03:43] mean where where else
[1:03:45] your flesh is in Jesus all the time
[1:03:47] right your mind's not always on the
[1:03:48] things of God all the time right
[1:03:51] so I'm preserved in Christ I'm preserved
[1:03:54] in the plan of God in the mind of God
[1:03:56] he's got a place for me I got a place in
[1:03:58] his Heavenly Kingdom Hallelujah by the
[1:04:00] grace of God he'll preserve me blameless
[1:04:02] Hallelujah
[1:04:05] it's a beautiful beautiful promise let's
[1:04:07] close with these quotes I'm just going
[1:04:08] to read a few quotes in closing here
[1:04:11] almost at an hour wow that's kind of
[1:04:12] surprising to me but anyways
[1:04:14] um
[1:04:16] these quotes you know a few weeks ago I
[1:04:18] was like really desperate to find these
[1:04:20] quotes I hope there will be a blessing
[1:04:21] to you
[1:04:23] I was just thinking about how
[1:04:26] God knows right where you are Church so
[1:04:28] this is from Jehovah Jireh 1962.
[1:04:32] not sure if that means any much to
[1:04:33] anybody if I don't know if we go listen
[1:04:34] to it or not but
[1:04:37] brother I was talking about
[1:04:38] um
[1:04:41] God visiting Abraham you know in Genesis
[1:04:44] 18 in the flesh body and then God the
[1:04:47] angel Lord visiting uh
[1:04:50] Elizabeth and Zechariah to have John the
[1:04:53] Baptist okay here's this quote
[1:04:55] live so that if God would want to use
[1:04:58] you he knows right where to come get you
[1:05:01] you're in a position living a clean life
[1:05:03] before God your words are honest your
[1:05:05] life is true that's the kind of place
[1:05:07] that Angels come
[1:05:09] right
[1:05:11] look at Elizabeth and Zechariah see an
[1:05:13] honest upright walking all the
[1:05:15] Commandments of the Lord that's the way
[1:05:16] we want to live so when God gets ready
[1:05:18] to use us he say this is my people I can
[1:05:21] do this
[1:05:22] with this church what I want to they
[1:05:25] believe me they stand on my word see
[1:05:26] that's the way you want to do live the
[1:05:29] life now church what do you picture do
[1:05:31] you picture Jesus looks down at Akron
[1:05:33] and says that church is Right Where I
[1:05:34] want them now I can use them
[1:05:37] I believe so by God's grace
[1:05:40] if not well then oh come to the altar
[1:05:42] tonight right don't say don't let's not
[1:05:46] say in our sins
[1:05:48] and the proof of that is just what
[1:05:49] happened last night that's the proof of
[1:05:50] it God can use us
[1:05:52] however he wants to
[1:05:54] God gives us a faithful brother like
[1:05:56] brother Simon I can just call him he can
[1:05:57] be here next time
[1:06:01] God said I need a little church there
[1:06:03] that can uh they can have a preacher
[1:06:05] that could help out these Amish people
[1:06:06] to know the truth right
[1:06:09] amen I wasn't even thinking about that
[1:06:11] with that quote praise God
[1:06:13] so you needed a church he needed to use
[1:06:15] somebody to do that so he used us
[1:06:20] he said let's live in that way that when
[1:06:23] God gets ready to use us he'll say this
[1:06:25] is my people I can do this
[1:06:27] I can do with this church what I want to
[1:06:29] how many want to say that Lord just do
[1:06:31] in our church whatever you want to do
[1:06:32] praise God
[1:06:33] I love what Simon said I love what he
[1:06:35] said he said he said Lord if you want me
[1:06:37] to speak in tongues I'll speak in
[1:06:38] tongues that's how I want to be yielded
[1:06:40] to God lord if you want to uh if you
[1:06:42] want me to lay hands on the sick I'll
[1:06:43] lay hands on the sick praise God
[1:06:45] whatever you want me to do Lord I want
[1:06:46] to do it by God's grace
[1:06:48] how many feel that way
[1:06:50] praise God
[1:06:59] let me read another one here
[1:07:05] he's talking about how he says healing
[1:07:07] this is from Hebrews chapter six part
[1:07:09] two if you're interested in that that's
[1:07:11] okay from that
[1:07:12] healing should be in every local church
[1:07:13] all these gifts operating we've seen
[1:07:15] healing in our church
[1:07:17] but don't go to seed on those gifts
[1:07:19] don't pay any attention to the gift if
[1:07:21] God wants you or if God wants to use you
[1:07:23] for something he will do it he said but
[1:07:26] look at the giver
[1:07:28] now that I hope that encourages somebody
[1:07:30] if God wants to raise the dead in you
[1:07:32] God's going to do it
[1:07:33] why because
[1:07:35] you're yielding to him
[1:07:37] each day you're crucifying the flesh are
[1:07:39] you not each day your sister's got to
[1:07:41] put on modest clothing right
[1:07:43] keep your hair long I know I see my
[1:07:46] girls takes a long time to do your hair
[1:07:48] takes a long time to wash it a long time
[1:07:50] to dry it
[1:07:51] long time to brush it God sees that
[1:07:55] God sees that
[1:07:57] each day
[1:07:59] and when God wants to use you for
[1:08:00] something God's going to use God's going
[1:08:02] to come and find you
[1:08:04] right
[1:08:06] just like when Lena's mom was missing
[1:08:09] God really used Austin and Naomi's
[1:08:11] prayers remember that night
[1:08:13] God really used him that night
[1:08:14] when Haven need to uplift God really
[1:08:16] used sister
[1:08:17] who are there remember they're in the
[1:08:19] bathroom
[1:08:20] as an uplift
[1:08:22] when God needs you somebody you want to
[1:08:24] just be right there so God can use you
[1:08:29] he said don't look at the gift he said
[1:08:31] look at The Giver
[1:08:32] so Lord Jesus just use me however you
[1:08:34] want to use me praise God
[1:08:41] now here's a great prayer I've preached
[1:08:43] this numerous times just in passing from
[1:08:45] trying to do God of service 1965
[1:08:49] 's praying said father God keep these in
[1:08:51] your hands they are yours Lord talk
[1:08:53] about the people
[1:08:55] I pray God that will always walk humble
[1:08:57] before you how many want to be humble
[1:08:58] before the Lord here
[1:09:00] we don't know how long now look at that
[1:09:02] that was 1965.
[1:09:04] it's now then he says we don't desire to
[1:09:07] know how long now how many would
[1:09:09] honestly say Amen to that
[1:09:12] kind of like to know how long I think I
[1:09:14] just said that last year right Lord am I
[1:09:15] going to live to see the Rapture or not
[1:09:16] I think I prayed that to the Lord last
[1:09:17] year
[1:09:19] but man says we don't desire to know how
[1:09:20] long it is
[1:09:22] he said it's not our business he said
[1:09:24] that's your business Lord
[1:09:26] it's not our Wills to know when you will
[1:09:28] come it's our will Lord to keep humble
[1:09:31] till you do come
[1:09:33] and walk with you and I love this quote
[1:09:35] this is what I've always prayed it's our
[1:09:37] desire for you Lord to just let yourself
[1:09:39] be known once in a while father Among Us
[1:09:41] that we can see that we're still walking
[1:09:43] with you
[1:09:45] so and I'll just says Lord just show us
[1:09:48] every once in a while that you're
[1:09:49] preserving Our Lives
[1:09:51] like God just showed me these last few
[1:09:53] weeks he's preserving my life he's using
[1:09:55] me when he wants to
[1:09:56] he he watches all over my life
[1:09:59] like I said with Simon preaching nine
[1:10:01] things I nine things secrets in my heart
[1:10:04] that show me God loves me
[1:10:06] I mean I know God loved me with the
[1:10:08] kitchen and God loves me with my wife
[1:10:09] and my children but that that
[1:10:13] was a fresh reminder that God loves me
[1:10:16] when he'll come and preach
[1:10:18] and preaches all my sermons right in
[1:10:20] front of me
[1:10:21] he repeats my sermons to me and then
[1:10:25] plainly says exactly what I just went
[1:10:26] what I just suffered through
[1:10:32] I guess I'm with Austin if I ever knew
[1:10:34] God loves me it's right now
[1:10:36] oh yeah my finances were getting low and
[1:10:38] I was you know
[1:10:39] we go through Seasons like that I just
[1:10:42] kept praying
[1:10:43] I'm like oh Lord just give me Grace and
[1:10:45] the next day I wake up I always check my
[1:10:46] finances and then my tax return was in
[1:10:48] my bank account I'm like thank God
[1:10:51] I started crying I started crying I said
[1:10:53] Lord
[1:10:55] it was like a few days after that I just
[1:10:56] said Lord You Love Me thank you for
[1:10:58] loving me because Nobody Loves Me Like
[1:10:59] You
[1:11:00] you know we just we all get frustration
[1:11:02] we all get nervous we all have doubts
[1:11:04] and beers and it just it just it's just
[1:11:06] wonderful when God reminds us of his
[1:11:09] grace
[1:11:10] we've seen that last Wednesday remind me
[1:11:12] who I am he reminds us of his grace he
[1:11:14] reminds me that he's preserving my life
[1:11:16] he's ordaining my life for something
[1:11:19] for his will
[1:11:22] so my prayer tonight should probably be
[1:11:24] Lord help me not to desire to know when
[1:11:26] the Rapture is right because he said we
[1:11:28] don't want to know help me to be humble
[1:11:31] until it does happen praise God
[1:11:36] but in this quote this is from the sign
[1:11:38] and I just gotta this is my last quote
[1:11:39] basketball Let's Dance Alaska musician
[1:11:41] could go
[1:11:42] this is from the sign of this time on
[1:11:44] November 13 63.
[1:11:48] saying you can only speak thus saith the
[1:11:50] Lord if God gives you thus saith the
[1:11:52] Lord and he says if the Holy Spirit told
[1:11:55] me I'm gonna I want you to go to the
[1:11:56] presidential graveyard tomorrow and I'm
[1:11:58] going to bring up George Washington he
[1:12:00] said I'd invite the whole world to come
[1:12:01] see it
[1:12:07] he says but until he says that you just
[1:12:10] wait you see see
[1:12:12] you know listen
[1:12:14] until God gives you thus saith the Lord
[1:12:16] I'm going to just walk around here

[1:12:35] answers of prayer which I do too I'm
[1:12:37] preaching to myself tonight this this
[1:12:39] thought was just on my heart tonight
[1:12:40] about God preserves the way of the
[1:12:42] Saints
[1:12:44] you know you're saved and you're filled
[1:12:46] with his goodness
[1:12:48] and you know how if he's in you he'll
[1:12:51] act his life out in you
[1:12:56] so just be satisfied he wants to use you
[1:12:59] he'll sure he'll short I'm sorry he'll
[1:13:02] sure do it he knows where you're at
[1:13:06] and the church said
[1:13:08] that's such an encouragement so I was I
[1:13:10] was I spent one morning like I spent an
[1:13:11] hour where I want to find all these
[1:13:13] quotes and I finally found him I put him
[1:13:15] in one email right there how many
[1:13:16] appreciate those quotes praise God
[1:13:18] let's live a life so God can look down
[1:13:20] and say I know how to use bride of
[1:13:22] Christ Fellowship
[1:13:23] Lord just show us every once in a while
[1:13:25] we're still walking with you and Lord
[1:13:27] show us how you're preserving Our Lives
[1:13:32] and Lord help me to live a life that
[1:13:33] when you want to use me you know right
[1:13:35] where to find me I won't be hiding from

[1:13:46] church I hope you are encouraged tonight
[1:13:48] like I said I've just seen God
[1:13:52] excuse me in this way and that's not I'm
[1:13:54] not exalting myself at all but just I
[1:13:56] was just shocked to be used in this way
[1:13:57] like this of all the preachers
[1:14:01] not even the closest one there's a
[1:14:02] preacher in Columbus
[1:14:05] there's a preacher in Logan I think
[1:14:06] would be closer than me
[1:14:09] but it just was a fresh reminder and
[1:14:10] hearing these other stories it's a fresh
[1:14:12] reminder God is preserving Our Lives
[1:14:16] he's preserving your way
[1:14:19] if you're fainting a heart he's going to
[1:14:21] strengthen your heart
[1:14:22] if you're weary he's going to give you
[1:14:24] strength to the weary

[1:14:30] year think about that
[1:14:32] that was for him
[1:14:33] the most holy time of the year the time
[1:14:35] of the Resurrection

[1:14:41] life he's brought me this far he's going
[1:14:43] to keep taking me on praise God
