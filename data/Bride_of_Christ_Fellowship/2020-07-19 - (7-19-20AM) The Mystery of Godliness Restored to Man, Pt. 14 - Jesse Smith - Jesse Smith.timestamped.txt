[34:10] prayer
[34:14] heavenly father we love you we're happy
[34:16] to be in your presence we paid it all
[34:18] you paid all of our sin death so we owe
[34:20] you all the lord it's not by
[34:23] legalism it's by our love yes we'll
[34:26] struggle with the flesh we'll fight with
[34:28] the flesh and the blind sometimes
[34:31] the lord we want to surrender these are
[34:32] times when we can renew our devotion or
[34:34] we can renew our desires
[34:36] and become refreshed and transform in
[34:39] your presence so do that today dear god
[34:42] transform our minds by the renewal of
[34:44] them of god
[34:45] by your holy spirit wash our minds god
[34:48] and
[34:48] let us realign our desires and our focus
[34:50] upon you lord we're so happy to be in

[34:53] let your holy spirit have preeminence of
[34:55] god may we give you
[34:56] the preeminence o god may you have your
[34:59] way in jesus christ
[35:05] set my time here i'll try to go 40
[35:14] minutes
[35:26] i just want to share this quick
[35:27] testimony of this week a church donated
[35:30] uh
[35:31] four thousand dollars to my next book
[35:33] okay so what we talked about the other
[35:35] day
[35:35] so one of the churches donating 4 000 to
[35:38] my next book
[35:39] i got to get it done now i think about
[35:41] all the pressure that puts on me now
[35:57] i just want to share an email we got
[35:58] yesterday on the book a nice woman named
[36:00] rachel
[36:02] she said i just want to drop you an
[36:03] email that you know how thankful i am as
[36:05] a christian wife a mother to read your
[36:07] book
[36:07] i was raised in a baptist church we went
[36:09] through quite a few years of rebellion
[36:11] against god
[36:12] and by faith but because of this i
[36:14] disregarded the issue of women wearing
[36:15] pants and hardly ever wore skirt
[36:17] addressed for years
[36:18] also watching youtube videos on modesty
[36:20] and notice god was starting to convict
[36:21] me about what i wore
[36:23] at this point 98 of my closet is skirts
[36:26] and dresses i hope that
[36:27] two percent changes i got an email for
[36:30] that
[36:33] and i have to come to enjoy shopping for
[36:36] feminine and modest clothing god has put
[36:38] it in my heart
[36:39] where'd that happen where did that come
[36:40] from amen
[36:43] wearing pants and sexy clothes for years
[36:46] but then where'd that
[36:47] conviction come from
[36:50] and i am a daughter of the king of jesus
[36:57] and i should embrace my uh femininity
[37:00] so thank you your book has really opened
[37:02] my heart and my mind
[37:05] that god's leading my life
[37:11] [Music]
[37:19] amen so i said thank you that i said
[37:21] that thrills my heart but i don't even
[37:22] know what i can get
[37:24] gracefully i hope that's encouragement
[37:26] and i just
[37:27] blessed in my heart that somebody would
[37:29] see their life transformed
[37:32] that's why we do it that's why we devote
[37:34] ourselves to the word
[37:36] i know i got a lot of quotes here things
[37:38] like that
[37:41] this is kind of my message for today but
[37:44] it's part 14 of this
[37:46] mystery of godliness
[37:55] so i'm excited i'm excited to see what
[37:57] god is doing
[37:58] and i want to be a part of that i want
[38:01] to do my part praise god i want to labor
[38:04] for the lord
[38:05] there is such a thing as laboratory and
[38:07] doctrine let me know that scripture
[38:08] the bible said give double honor to
[38:10] those who labor doctrine i'm not
[38:12] not asking for your honor but i'm saying
[38:14] that there is an aspect
[38:15] to laboring with doctrine and teaching
[38:18] and god highly values it amen and so i
[38:21] want to be faithful that's what the
[38:22] lord's called me to do which i
[38:24] humbly believe that is i want to be
[38:26] faithful with that
[38:27] and i love seeing testimonies like that
[38:30] so i want to
[38:31] devote this uh service this morning the
[38:33] next uh
[38:34] 36 minutes to uh this idea
[38:37] of we have to understand that the
[38:41] love and the holy spirit are the same
[38:43] thing
[38:45] most people most of us do understand
[38:47] that but i want to just take a sermon
[38:49] and i want to just preach it because i
[38:51] don't know if i ever have but amen have
[38:52] ever
[38:53] do you remember i've dealt with that
[38:57] probably okay now one thing i don't know
[39:00] what i don't think i've ever done is
[39:02] i want to emphasize that this is the one
[39:04] this is uh of course a typed out version
[39:06] of what brother brandon originally drew
[39:08] you can go online and you can see what
[39:10] brother branham originally drew you like
[39:11] with the pencil and
[39:14] a ruler but if you look over there at
[39:17] ours the difference
[39:18] is that brother rams had the holy spirit
[39:22] above broadly kindness but ours doesn't
[39:26] and the reason that is is because the
[39:28] revelation came to brother branham later
[39:31] that the holy spirit is god amen
[39:34] and the holy spirit is love amen and god
[39:37] is love
[39:38] amen so brother am drew this he drew
[39:41] this in october of 1962.
[39:45] and of course you know the seals weren't
[39:46] open until march of that year
[39:49] i'm sorry the next year rather in 63
[39:53] uh and i mean amen and who are kind of
[39:57] experiencing it but i'll just say
[39:58] in general you know our church gets a
[40:00] little bit of criticism or whatever
[40:02] because of the standard we take with the
[40:03] word
[40:04] right as i told amen and i said that's
[40:06] because we dig deeper in the word
[40:09] a lot of people don't dig down deep in
[40:10] the word and so they would so i would
[40:13] get attacked
[40:14] for taking that out
[40:17] but if you if you keep reading you keep
[40:20] listening to brother branham and then
[40:22] read the church age book
[40:24] you'll find that he unites all those
[40:26] terms
[40:27] he unites all those terms as one term
[40:30] happy birthday brother thank you sir
[40:42] so uh you know
[40:46] you've probably seen it people will
[40:47] attack you if you just say one thing a
[40:49] little different than what brother
[40:50] said in one sermon they'll attack you
[40:54] and they'll
[40:54] they'll say oh he's exalting himself
[40:56] above brother branham no we're not
[40:58] what we're doing is we're gaining more
[40:59] revelation of what he said
[41:01] and then yes the holy spirit then goes
[41:03] back and brings correction to it
[41:06] but that's what the holy spirit was
[41:07] given for amen
[41:09] to guide us into all truth amen okay
[41:13] and so a lot of people have trouble with
[41:15] that that's okay let's pray for them
[41:17] let's be real christians
[41:18] and if anybody differs let's not say
[41:20] we're better let's just say
[41:22] well god bless them amen bless those who
[41:24] persecute you
[41:26] pray for those who despitefully use you
[41:28] or say evil things against you
[41:30] so i want to you know as i was going
[41:32] through this uh
[41:34] chapter that the lord helped me to write
[41:35] i wanted to
[41:37] look at this now so what's that
[41:40] i think um
[41:44] so i want to look at this eighth trait
[41:46] the eighth trait is
[41:48] not i guess it's not a trait it's the
[41:49] ceiling of the holy spirit
[41:52] and uh we know after this comes this
[41:56] this is the ceiling you know uh the holy
[41:58] spirit love is the same thing
[41:59] it's the ceiling it also is the adoption
[42:03] because the bible says the holy spirit
[42:05] you receive the earnest of your
[42:06] inheritance
[42:07] the down payment the holy spirit is the
[42:09] earnest or down payment of your
[42:10] inheritance
[42:11] so with the spirit of adoption the holy
[42:14] spirit is the spirit of adoption
[42:16] and then once you're born again you'll
[42:17] produce fruits praise god
[42:19] and then you become a mature believer
[42:23] with true godliness see the first two
[42:26] stages
[42:27] with faith is the first stage and then
[42:29] these all these attributes are the
[42:30] second stage
[42:31] they can just prepare you for service
[42:34] once you're born again
[42:35] now you can serve amen so church look at
[42:38] your life if you're not serving
[42:39] specifically somebody
[42:41] it's time to check up and say am i born
[42:42] again because the holy ghost gives you
[42:45] power
[42:45] to serve amen because
[42:49] it puts you into service so now you're
[42:51] once you're born again you're
[42:52] actively serving and remember it can be
[42:54] as humble as being a father a mother or
[42:56] a farmer brother man says or a nurse or
[42:59] whatever god's called you to be but
[43:01] you're serving people
[43:02] people by the power of god but i
[43:05] personally believe specifically
[43:06] we should be serving our local churches
[43:08] by the power of the holy spirit amen
[43:10] that's more than coming to church that's
[43:12] part of that that's part of that
[43:13] tithing's part of that
[43:15] but you know finding your gifts i think
[43:17] is a major part of that
[43:18] that's why i'm going to go eventually go
[43:20] back to that purpose series
[43:21] let's go back to the gifts and preach
[43:23] more on the gifts later on
[43:25] because when you're when you're into
[43:26] with the holy spirit these things are
[43:28] just supposed to flow out of you praise
[43:29] god
[43:30] and that they're just now at random
[43:32] times like there may be times
[43:34] you expect it there's other times it may
[43:35] be unexpected
[43:37] uh there may be you know gaps where you
[43:39] don't maybe see a lot but
[43:40] that's okay because that's how a plant
[43:42] is right they don't produce fruit their
[43:43] whole life right
[43:45] there's certain seasons for there's
[43:46] times and seasons
[43:49] but in other words there should be
[43:50] evidence that you are
[43:52] are born again and you're in the service
[43:55] of the lord
[43:56] amen praise god uh so that's what i want
[43:59] to
[43:59] make sure i say that now you and i know
[44:02] the word love in the greek
[44:04] is agape it's the word agape there's
[44:06] four words for love in the greek
[44:08] but this is the only one that's godly
[44:10] love
[44:11] there's three other kinds i forget one's
[44:13] philadelphia that's good brotherly love
[44:16] and then there's the two ones that
[44:17] belong to the flesh it's kind of like
[44:18] there's two for god and two for the
[44:19] world
[44:20] just like there's four kinds of ground
[44:22] right two that are safe two they're lost
[44:23] it's a good
[44:24] it's a good thought and so
[44:28] uh agape is this is what it means it
[44:30] means brotherly love
[44:31] so that's a little bit of carryover it
[44:34] means affection
[44:35] good will love or benevolence so church
[44:38] this has to be a greater
[44:39] love than brotherly kindness because
[44:41] it's the next it's the eighth step
[44:44] it's the ceiling step and it's it's not
[44:47] just
[44:47] temporary because remember this is
[44:48] temporary right this can come and go
[44:51] you can be so in love with your brother
[44:53] but then you can be really upset with
[44:55] your father
[44:56] and i mean in sin i don't mean like you
[44:58] can be angry not sin
[44:59] i mean you you can love them but then be
[45:02] so angry you say evil things against
[45:04] them and hurt their character
[45:06] or gossip right and now that's you lost
[45:08] it
[45:09] you lost it for that moment you got to
[45:10] get it back praise god
[45:12] so see this is temporary but god's love
[45:15] is permanent praise god
[45:17] it's a permanent thing and and one way
[45:19] brother says you know what you've got is
[45:21] you know the holy spirit as love will be
[45:24] quick to convince you that you made a
[45:26] mistake
[45:26] yes and remember terms does that mean
[45:29] and i was thinking about this
[45:30] let me just say this in the name of the
[45:32] lord because the bible says this in the
[45:34] name of the lord
[45:35] the bible said let him that names the
[45:38] name of christ
[45:39] depart from iniquity amen in other words
[45:42] if you are born again
[45:44] you will leave iniquity which is slavery
[45:47] which is
[45:47] purposeful sinning addictions to sin
[45:50] praise god
[45:51] that's why i can say that in the name of
[45:52] the lord if you are
[45:55] truly born again you'll depart from
[45:57] addictions and bad habits
[45:58] you'll
[46:03] this week it's so true it's so true that
[46:07] this is a permanent
[46:09] portion of god's divine love living in
[46:12] you
[46:12] my wife and i were talking yesterday as
[46:14] i was studying martin luther's life oh
[46:15] my you can really see it martin luther's
[46:17] life
[46:18] you can really see how he got tired and
[46:20] at the end of his ministry
[46:22] i was reading and i'll preach on this
[46:24] later
[46:26] but martin luther was such a mighty man
[46:28] of god
[46:29] uh historians say hardly anybody has
[46:32] more books written about them than this
[46:34] man other than christ
[46:38] because church you imagine
[46:41] imagine if every government like your
[46:42] local akron government right
[46:44] ever seen the court everybody seen the
[46:46] courthouse the ohio courthouse
[46:49] he was one man that went and stood up
[46:52] against the spiritual courthouse of that
[46:54] day
[46:54] the pope remember the pope and the state
[46:56] were together
[46:59] so that's why he was such an anointed
[47:00] man he walked up there
[47:03] and he nailed he nailed the 95 thesis on
[47:06] the church door
[47:07] he did it after seeing painful workers
[47:09] walk
[47:10] out and selling indulgences
[47:13] he just couldn't take it anymore he
[47:14] hadn't even got a revelation for about a
[47:16] year about justification by faith
[47:17] he was preaching but after seeing those
[47:19] papal workers
[47:21] all by himself he was all he was all by
[47:23] himself he walked up there and nailed it
[47:25] up there
[47:26] and they put a bounty on his head and
[47:28] then four years later
[47:29] he walked into the diet of worms sitting
[47:32] right in front of the holy roman emperor
[47:35] and he said you need to recant and he
[47:37] said he said my conscience is my god
[47:40] scripture is my authority he said i
[47:43] can't go against
[47:44] any of that and i'm kind of messing up
[47:45] now he said but here i stand so help me
[47:48] god amen
[47:49] amen what a man of god
[47:52] he stood there like a rock of ages amen
[47:55] and the anointing was so heavy on this
[47:57] was the age of killing people
[47:59] but the anointing was so strong the pope
[48:01] and their guys they just they stood
[48:02] there still they couldn't they let him
[48:04] leave
[48:04] and then his friends his own friends
[48:06] kidnapped him keep imagine if i came
[48:08] down
[48:09] they kidnapped me because they knew the
[48:10] pope was going to try to kill later
[48:12] and they kidnapped him and hide him away
[48:14] for 10 months and in that 10 months
[48:16] the first 90 days he translated uh
[48:20] the bible the whole new testament in 90
[48:22] days
[48:24] ah what a man of god after that
[48:27] he translates the old testament into
[48:29] german
[48:31] he's a mighty man of god but church if
[48:32] you look at the end of his life
[48:34] he hated jews
[48:38] he didn't have a revelation you know why
[48:40] because it wasn't for that day
[48:42] that was for the last day amen the seals
[48:46] weren't revealed
[48:49] daniel said daniel said shut up the book
[48:52] and seal it to the end time
[48:53] amen that fiscal revelation wasn't
[48:57] available
[48:57] in 1520 praise god but it was available
[49:00] in 1963 praise god
[49:02] amen and it remains available today
[49:05] that's why we don't criticize martin
[49:06] luther it wasn't the age of revelation
[49:08] for him
[49:09] for that aspect of the gospel but see
[49:12] you see by the end of his life you know
[49:14] he was very discouraged and tired
[49:16] he wore himself out and he made some bad
[49:19] judgment calls
[49:21] and you can see where he kind of
[49:23] struggled with some of these
[49:25] to put it lightly especially with jews
[49:28] you know
[49:28] i guess i guess you would be that a
[49:31] christian a jew wouldn't be a brother in
[49:32] christ right
[49:33] so i guess he was at the end of his life
[49:35] he really struggled with godliness
[49:37] we know he smoked a pipe and drank
[49:39] alcohol and other things
[49:41] but yet he was so anointed he could
[49:43] stand there and basically given his life
[49:46] for
[49:46] for he was willing to give his life now
[49:48] he did it but he was willing to give his
[49:50] life and for that holy roman emperor
[49:52] to stand for god's word that the just
[49:54] shall live by faith
[49:55] church are you living by faith today not
[49:58] by what you see
[50:00] by what why what heaven declares is
[50:02] truth amen
[50:03] looking at the unseen praise god we're
[50:06] living
[50:07] by the fact that jesus christ sits on
[50:09] the throne of god
[50:10] making intercession for our sins today
[50:13] praise god
[50:14] i don't see that sister whitney and i
[50:16] believe it i do see it with my sixth
[50:18] sense amen amen
[50:20] amen and i'm living by that and that's
[50:22] what martin luther lived by that's what
[50:24] west is about
[50:36] [Music]
[50:38] hallelujah it's such a great mighty
[50:41] revelation
[50:44] but yet he had his faults oh boy he lost
[50:47] some of this too
[50:48] yes he lost some of that yeah a mighty
[50:52] man of god
[50:53] but i love how brother branham addresses
[50:54] it at the end of this this section the
[50:56] church age but i got to read the
[50:57] church's book of life
[50:59] but abraham said martin luther was still
[51:02] used by god
[51:03] he said but god also used the moses a
[51:06] murderer
[51:08] a jonah a willingly disobedient
[51:13] right and he goes through all samson
[51:17] he bought a prostitute
[51:21] look at these men god used it brother
[51:22] madison the ones that were
[51:25] holy were very few and far between
[51:27] compared to the ones that weren't
[51:29] right he said but either way they were
[51:32] all gods they had
[51:40] but he was still god's man of that hour
[51:43] he was still a chosen mess up and he
[51:45] knew what it was to live by faith amen
[51:52] and so church the baptism holy ghost let
[51:53] me get back to that is the permanent
[51:55] portion
[51:56] of god's divine love living in you
[52:00] it's god's own spirit coming to live
[52:02] inside your soul because the bible said
[52:05] god is love now let me
[52:08] yeah show when he's uh yeah i want to
[52:10] show wendy's artwork
[52:11] the comparison so we i took out the love
[52:13] when i saw that because i
[52:15] i knew brother branham thought more
[52:16] revelation later i'm not ashamed of that
[52:18] because it's in the bible praise god
[52:20] i'm gonna prove it to you this morning
[52:22] lord willing
[52:24] okay uh the show quotes holy ghost uh
[52:28] soon i don't think i need to do that
[52:30] okay
[52:31] yeah i want to yeah i want to show this
[52:32] though brother ram says the holy spirit
[52:34] welds the attributes together
[52:36] so the capstone can cap it off so this
[52:38] is brother rams understanding of the
[52:40] previous one
[52:41] okay so brother and describing this in
[52:44] that sermon
[52:45] from october 62 and this is how he says
[52:48] they're different now me reading this i
[52:50] don't see much difference
[52:52] uh and that's because god was going to
[52:54] show later that it was one the same
[52:56] so here's what brother says i'm sorry
[52:58] it's so small he said building this
[53:00] monument i look at the end of the
[53:01] message
[53:02] this statue see it starts off with the
[53:04] foundation so faith virtue knowledge
[53:05] temperance patience scholars brother
[53:07] kindness
[53:07] now what does it do then they're waiting
[53:09] for the head so which is
[53:11] love for god is love
[53:14] the church if you make that if you make
[53:17] god love but then the holy spirit not
[53:19] god
[53:19] boy do you have some troubles you truly
[53:22] have three persons in your godhead now
[53:25] right but see brother i haven't talked
[53:27] when i want you to say why the brother
[53:28] i'm teaching because it just wasn't
[53:29] reviewed yet
[53:31] it wasn't revealed yet see he controls
[53:34] it and he has the strength of every one
[53:36] of those things that's right
[53:37] right here right here you see i got in
[53:38] between all these works in here she's
[53:40] talking about in between brother kaidus
[53:42] and love
[53:43] hear these little waves come what is
[53:45] that the holy ghost coming down through
[53:47] christ see
[53:48] holy spirit
[53:51] the holy spirit is above all this
[53:53] welding this together building a lot a
[53:56] perfect church
[53:57] for the capstone to cap it off
[54:00] okay so whatever says that holy spirit
[54:03] in between was just
[54:04] welding all those other seven pieces
[54:06] together but then the capsule still has
[54:08] to come to cap it off
[54:11] but a few minutes later brother random
[54:13] says the holy ghost is the capstone
[54:16] so see it was just growing he was doing
[54:18] the best he could he was growing
[54:21] so later he said so when you surrender
[54:23] your complete being oh god help us to
[54:24] just do that
[54:25] if we get nothing else out of this god
[54:27] help us to surrender everything today
[54:29] amen surrender our complete me then the
[54:32] holy spirit just pours through you
[54:35] in these virtues then you're a living
[54:37] tabernacle
[54:38] amen now that she believes the word
[54:43] i'm sorry then people will look at you
[54:44] and say that man's full of virtue
[54:46] knowledge
[54:46] he believes the word temperance patience
[54:48] god is brother kindness full of the love
[54:50] of the holy ghost see there he is
[54:52] walking around what is it a statue that
[54:53] unbelievers can look at and say
[54:55] there is a christian there's a man or
[54:58] woman who knows what they're talking
[54:59] about
[54:59] you've never seen a kinder sweeter
[55:01] godlier person you're sealed
[55:04] he's using all these things synonymously
[55:06] or they're all the same thing
[55:08] a seal shows on both sides whether
[55:10] you're going or coming you see
[55:12] the seal just the same there you are
[55:13] when a man or woman possesses this
[55:15] then the capstone comes down and seals
[55:17] them into the kingdom of god
[55:19] which is the holy ghost
[55:22] okay so i just showed you two quotes and
[55:24] one quote he's saying they're different
[55:26] things
[55:27] but a few minutes later he says they're
[55:28] the same thing okay
[55:31] all right so i want to just make sure i
[55:32] bring that up so because we didn't have
[55:34] a minister
[55:35] a couple years ago come and preach how
[55:36] they're different and then a minute amen
[55:38] and i will talk about that
[55:39] got a good question and that's when i
[55:41] preached at one time i know that for
[55:42] sure
[55:45] uh and again we're not saying anything
[55:47] against people that don't agree with us
[55:48] we need to love them praise god they're
[55:50] the ones we should love amen if they
[55:52] disagree with us
[55:54] uh but which have to differ with god's
[55:56] love
[55:57] so there no doubt there's real confusion
[55:59] about the quotes because brother man was
[56:01] constantly learning
[56:02] right so here he says this is uh
[56:06] sorry i changed the color this is a
[56:08] month after he preached the statue of
[56:09] men so he preached it in october statute
[56:11] man
[56:12] then why i'm against organized religion
[56:14] brother graham said
[56:15] i believe martin luther had the holy
[56:16] spirit absolutely maybe not the portion
[56:18] is today
[56:18] because it wasn't given up we've been
[56:20] through this you people the tabernacle
[56:21] here on the blackboard
[56:22] but he did believe to god and he that
[56:25] believeth that everlasting life
[56:26] i never thought there was a person
[56:27] believe that like me but this morning i
[56:29] heard charles filler
[56:31] fuller as i was going down he believes
[56:32] too that the new birth is not the
[56:34] baptism of the holy ghost
[56:37] okay so a lot of people they they take
[56:39] this quote and this is that's all they
[56:40] can see
[56:42] and i said it last week and i said two
[56:43] weeks ago they denominate around that
[56:45] quote
[56:45] yeah church if you grab onto a quote and
[56:48] you can't
[56:49] you can't let go of that when there's
[56:51] further truth
[56:52] revealed to you then you've denominated
[56:54] you'll never grow
[56:55] you'll never stay in love with the word
[56:57] of god because you denominated and
[56:59] you'll see the effects in your life
[57:00] you can't tell me uh uh an episcopalian
[57:03] today as
[57:04] much zeal for christ as we do
[57:07] they can't because they denominated
[57:09] they've limited the holy spirit
[57:11] but if the holy spirit has free course
[57:13] in our lives we should be the happiest
[57:15] people in the world amen
[57:16] amen right i mean it has to happen the
[57:19] holy spirit in our lives
[57:20] has to make a difference there has to be
[57:24] a tangible difference
[57:25] i do it all the time really man when i
[57:27] walk into other churches that don't
[57:28] believe the message i can feel the
[57:29] difference amen
[57:31] and then i come here and i'm so we're so
[57:32] free in the holy
[57:39] in the spirit portion of god's love
[57:40] that's here
[57:46] because we receive more of the word and
[57:49] the holy spirit only backs up the word
[57:51] praise god
[57:54] you see the new birth is being born the
[57:56] holy ghost is the baptist
[58:00] later he mixes it he says this at least
[58:03] six times before the seals i'm not going
[58:05] to go through all them
[58:07] but then he received the revelation
[58:08] after he said now look the church is
[58:09] booked
[58:10] he says in other words to be born of the
[58:12] spirit is to be truly baptized with the
[58:14] holy ghost is one the same
[58:18] okay so this is the church age book uh
[58:20] four years later
[58:21] he or three years later he already he
[58:23] had it corrected at the end of his life
[58:26] what is the baptism holy ghost it's the
[58:27] spirit baptizing the body of christ
[58:29] it is the new birth amen the spirit of
[58:32] god coming in and filling you after
[58:33] you've repented having heard his word
[58:35] that baptized in water as an answer of a
[58:38] good conscious toward god
[58:40] glory now notice this is in uh okay this
[58:44] is a few months after the seals three
[58:45] months after this after five months
[58:48] brother ram uses new birth and baptism
[58:51] interchangeably so but amen i would
[58:52] argue
[58:53] five months after the seals got it
[58:54] already corrected by the grant
[58:56] i would argue that i believe each one of
[58:59] you methodist presbyterian lutheran
[59:00] never had experience the baptism of the
[59:02] holy spirit was in some formal church
[59:04] and did not believe in the genuine new
[59:06] birth
[59:06] and has now received the facts of the
[59:07] holy ghost is a perfect example of a
[59:09] paradox
[59:11] praise god there's more by the token he
[59:14] says
[59:14] when god gives you the true baptism of
[59:16] the holy spirit and the life of jesus
[59:18] christ is within you now that's true in
[59:20] every theologian i have to admit that to
[59:21] be
[59:21] yes sir it's the new birth remember he
[59:24] just said they're not the same right a
[59:26] year
[59:26] two years or year before but now he says
[59:29] they're the same
[59:31] you're born in new the holy spirit
[59:33] because that god has did this and you
[59:34] know you're no good in yourself
[59:36] i thought i heard it i thought i'd hear
[59:37] a little few more amens on that one
[59:40] amen let me read that again you're born
[59:43] into the holy spirit
[59:46] and because you've got to do this you
[59:47] know you're no good in yourself
[59:50] amen and you accept what god did and
[59:53] then he seals you into his kingdom
[59:55] by the holy spirit
[59:58] let me show these scriptures now that
[1:00:00] they're all synonyms
[1:00:02] and then our i was hoping uh sister
[1:00:04] karen would be here because i just want
[1:00:05] to make a comment about the late perry
[1:00:07] green
[1:00:08] he's a he was a tremendous man of god a
[1:00:10] tremendous man of god
[1:00:11] now i just differed with him on the
[1:00:12] church age book i was hoping karen would
[1:00:14] be here because karen
[1:00:15] used to sit under him she would here he
[1:00:16] was her pastor for many years
[1:00:19] gandhi man i love listening to his
[1:00:20] testimonials listen to it this morning
[1:00:22] thanks for sharing the link buddy
[1:00:23] appreciate that church look at this just
[1:00:25] look at this for a moment if this
[1:00:28] doesn't convince us that the holy spirit
[1:00:32] and love and the
[1:00:33] is not the same then we've got some real
[1:00:35] problems
[1:00:37] right then in other words we're just not
[1:00:39] reading the bible
[1:00:42] you know people claim to believe the
[1:00:44] bible right
[1:00:45] but if they deny this and i'm gonna show
[1:00:47] the scriptures that all support us in a
[1:00:49] moment
[1:00:50] if they deny this then they're just not
[1:00:51] reading their bible
[1:00:53] if they want to believe in the holy
[1:00:55] ghost baptism different from the new
[1:00:56] birth that's fine
[1:00:57] but they are just not reading the bible
[1:01:00] okay i said i would love i know i'm
[1:01:02] coming off awful strong today that's
[1:01:04] because i've been preaching a while
[1:01:06] i'm really zealous last all week i've
[1:01:09] been preaching like two weeks
[1:01:11] happy to be preaching praise god but god
[1:01:13] is love love is charity
[1:01:15] god is the holy spirit the holy spirit
[1:01:16] is the seal the holy spirit is the holy
[1:01:18] ghost and the holy ghost is the baptism
[1:01:21] and the holy ghost is god's love amen
[1:01:24] amen and there's your scriptures if you
[1:01:25] want them i can email to everybody or
[1:01:27] text it to you if you want
[1:01:29] i'm not going to take the time to go
[1:01:30] through all this maybe i'll do that
[1:01:31] tonight maybe i'll do this
[1:01:32] so everybody can have the peace in their
[1:01:34] heart
[1:01:36] church god is love love is charity right
[1:01:39] because love is just another word for
[1:01:40] agape god is the holy spirit jesus said
[1:01:44] god
[1:01:45] is a spirit which one is he he's the
[1:01:47] holy one praise god
[1:01:50] the holy spirit is a seal he said you're
[1:01:52] sealed with the holy spirit of promise
[1:01:54] the holy spirit is the holy ghost uh
[1:01:57] that was a good one let's read that
[1:01:58] though john 7 39 i'm just going to read
[1:02:00] it out of my
[1:02:01] bible here
[1:02:12] and there are numerous examples like one
[1:02:13] example we're not going to get to is
[1:02:15] where
[1:02:15] the bible said and jesus was filled with
[1:02:17] the holy ghost
[1:02:18] and the spirit led him into the
[1:02:20] wilderness was that two persons that he
[1:02:22] met there or is it the same person
[1:02:25] same person he was filled with the holy
[1:02:27] ghost and
[1:02:28] the bible said the spirit led him into
[1:02:30] the wilderness it wasn't the devil
[1:02:31] it was god right god's the one who leads
[1:02:34] you into temptations right
[1:02:36] because he loves to see you overcome
[1:02:38] amen
[1:02:39] praise god
[1:02:43] lord john 7 39 look at the scripture but
[1:02:46] this fake he of the spirit
[1:02:48] she's talking about the living waters
[1:02:50] right now look at verse 38
[1:02:52] shall flow rivers of living water but
[1:02:55] this fake key of the spirit verse 39
[1:02:57] which they that believe on him should
[1:02:59] receive for the holy ghost was not yet
[1:03:01] given
[1:03:01] because that jesus was not yet glorified
[1:03:04] so see church the holy spirit is the
[1:03:07] holy ghost
[1:03:08] is that two different verses it's the
[1:03:10] same spirit
[1:03:12] and jesus said he said i'll baptize you
[1:03:14] with the holy ghost so
[1:03:15] the baptism of the holy ghost is the
[1:03:17] holy ghost
[1:03:18] and the holy ghost is god's love oh i
[1:03:20] love this romans 5 5. my this is you
[1:03:24] i love it they're just it's just
[1:03:26] complete harmony with the scriptures
[1:03:29] i just love it god gives all these
[1:03:30] different ways to look at it romans 5
[1:03:32] 5 and hope maketh not ashamed
[1:03:38] because the love of god
[1:03:41] so there's god's love the love of god is
[1:03:44] shed
[1:03:45] abroad in our hearts by who the holy
[1:03:48] ghost
[1:03:49] which is given unto us praise god so
[1:03:52] where'd that love in your soul come from
[1:03:54] the holy spirit that's what the bible
[1:03:57] says
[1:03:58] so the holy ghost is god's love in
[1:04:00] church once you get here
[1:04:01] you go right back to the beginning
[1:04:02] praise god right because god is love
[1:04:05] never is does that help does that help
[1:04:07] everybody amen
[1:04:09] see that's why we have the liberty i'll
[1:04:11] say like this
[1:04:13] i have the burden to correct that
[1:04:14] picture and make it the right way
[1:04:17] because i'm supposed to labor and
[1:04:18] doctrine praise god
[1:04:21] i just don't think it should be done i
[1:04:23] have a burden to it because the holy
[1:04:24] ghost is going to teach us all
[1:04:26] truth amen it's okay people you know
[1:04:29] okay they don't understand it that's
[1:04:30] between them and god can they be born
[1:04:32] again
[1:04:32] maybe i don't know possibly but church
[1:04:35] if you are born again
[1:04:36] you'll be guided into all truths amen
[1:04:38] there's no doubt about that
[1:04:40] because that's what jesus christ said
[1:04:41] where's god now here's the next one
[1:04:43] who's in you
[1:04:46] the bible said jesus is jesus christ is
[1:04:48] in you amen
[1:04:49] then paul said christ is in you and then
[1:04:52] jesus said the comforter or the spirit
[1:04:54] of truth is in you
[1:04:56] and then paul said the spirit of god is
[1:04:57] in you then paul said the holy ghost is
[1:05:00] which one's in your church it's one in
[1:05:03] the same right
[1:05:04] amen so here's the scriptures if you
[1:05:06] want me to send your screenshot i'd be
[1:05:07] happy to do that
[1:05:09] i would paul said jesus christ must be
[1:05:12] in you
[1:05:13] except you be reprobates see
[1:05:16] like a foolish person could they
[1:05:18] backside and become a reprobate
[1:05:20] right they could be believing for a
[1:05:22] while like judas and then fall away and
[1:05:24] become arrested
[1:05:25] reprobate sorry paul said christ you the
[1:05:27] hope of glory
[1:05:28] jesus christ and the comforter will he
[1:05:31] will be with you and he'll be in you
[1:05:33] praise god
[1:05:34] the end of the age paul said the spirit
[1:05:37] of god is in you
[1:05:39] you're a temple of the spirit of god
[1:05:41] today says the holy ghost in the apostle
[1:05:43] says the holy ghost which is in you
[1:05:45] now does that help by god's man amen
[1:05:47] let's meet church
[1:05:48] the bible solves every problem
[1:05:51] if there's a doctrinal misunderstanding
[1:05:53] we just got to study the scriptures
[1:05:56] and the holy spirit will help us compare
[1:05:58] scripture with scripture
[1:06:00] and out of that will come the truth of
[1:06:02] god's word amen
[1:06:03] amen that's exactly right
[1:06:07] so i don't have time maybe i'll do that
[1:06:08] tonight but there are six great
[1:06:10] scriptures in the new testament where
[1:06:11] you can see
[1:06:11] spirit and ghost of the same thing i
[1:06:14] gave you that one example
[1:06:15] jesus was full of the holy ghost and the
[1:06:16] spirit led them into the wilderness so
[1:06:18] it's one of the same
[1:06:19] one the same now here's our precious
[1:06:23] brother very green which
[1:06:24] he has helped my walk with the lord very
[1:06:26] much because i hear his testimonies
[1:06:28] about brother branham
[1:06:29] in fact my brother hopefully knows this
[1:06:31] that book acts of the prophet that's one
[1:06:33] of the greatest teachings
[1:06:35] on brother random scriptures i've ever
[1:06:37] read
[1:06:38] and he did that back in the 70s
[1:06:41] so i think he had a tremendous ministry
[1:06:44] tremendous
[1:06:46] but one thing i would disagree is that
[1:06:48] so so brother perry green didn't uh
[1:06:50] support things in the church some of the
[1:06:51] things the church
[1:06:53] and one of them was he says this noah
[1:06:56] and i'm paraphrasing this because i
[1:06:57] couldn't find uh
[1:06:58] i couldn't find the exact quote
[1:07:02] about that um brother perry basically
[1:07:04] said no one can get to heaven without
[1:07:06] the blood so only holy ghost-filled
[1:07:07] saints are saved
[1:07:09] you know that sounds all right but now
[1:07:10] to me i differ on that
[1:07:12] because i believe the virgin are saved
[1:07:14] too
[1:07:15] okay that's what i believe now
[1:07:19] here's my scripture for because first
[1:07:21] quotes are good but quotes all have to
[1:07:23] have scripture praise god
[1:07:25] so justification is by the blood amen
[1:07:29] and then faith and then you're justified
[1:07:31] by faith as well praise god amen
[1:07:33] the brother says this no yeah here's
[1:07:35] here's the quote in question
[1:07:37] we do not need to guess about those who
[1:07:39] in the second resurrection are given
[1:07:41] life we're told it's given to them on
[1:07:43] the grounds they have been
[1:07:44] kind and good to the brethren those who
[1:07:47] are raised and cast the lake of fire
[1:07:49] will be so treated because of their
[1:07:50] mistreatment of the brethren
[1:07:52] since this is the word of god we simply
[1:07:54] accept it there is no argument here
[1:07:55] just a simple statement of fact so in
[1:07:58] other words at the day of judgment you
[1:08:00] have the bride
[1:08:00] seated with christ behind him right but
[1:08:03] then you have
[1:08:04] sheep that are on his right hand that
[1:08:06] gets saved
[1:08:08] okay but they're given eternal life
[1:08:12] they're not in the bride but they're
[1:08:13] giving eternal life
[1:08:14] because jesus says they were good to the
[1:08:16] brethren amen
[1:08:18] okay and this is the quote they just
[1:08:21] don't agree with which they don't have
[1:08:24] to further clarify the words of jesus it
[1:08:27] does not say that a shepherd is
[1:08:28] literally separating sheep from goats
[1:08:30] but
[1:08:30] as a shepherd dividing sheep from goats
[1:08:32] these are not sheep in this particular
[1:08:34] area of time but like
[1:08:35] judgment the sheep are in his fall they
[1:08:37] heard his voice the word they found him
[1:08:39] they already have eternal life and
[1:08:40] cannot come into judgment
[1:08:42] but these do not have eternal life and
[1:08:45] they're in the judgment they're allowed
[1:08:46] to go into eternal life
[1:08:48] upon what rounds do they enter life
[1:08:50] eternal certainly not
[1:08:52] upon the fact that they already have his
[1:08:54] life as does the bride but they receive
[1:08:56] it because they were kind to his
[1:08:57] brethren
[1:08:58] they're not his brethren that would make
[1:09:00] them joint heirs with jesus
[1:09:02] okay so let me let me say this how many
[1:09:04] know john chapter 3 says
[1:09:06] you must be born again so see that's a
[1:09:08] scripture many will misunderstand but
[1:09:10] they got to read it carefully
[1:09:11] he said if they're they got to be born
[1:09:13] again to be in the kingdom of god
[1:09:16] so the foolish virgin can be saved but
[1:09:18] they will not be a part of the ruling
[1:09:20] kingdom of god they'll have a portion
[1:09:24] somewhere outside of that kingdom of god
[1:09:26] but the kingdom and the kingdom means
[1:09:28] rulership
[1:09:29] and authority it means those who are
[1:09:32] ruined
[1:09:33] unless you're born again you'll not be
[1:09:34] in the kingdom of god that's right
[1:09:37] you won't be in the bread you won't be
[1:09:38] in the ruling body the bride of jesus
[1:09:41] christ but you still can be saved
[1:09:42] to me church that's not that's not
[1:09:44] fanaticism that's god's grace
[1:09:46] amen amen does that give grace for my
[1:09:51] my roman catholic grandmother amen who
[1:09:53] took my whole family in
[1:09:55] when my dad lost his job and went
[1:09:57] through bankruptcy
[1:09:58] amen my widowed grandmother who
[1:10:01] faithfully cut her hair went to catholic
[1:10:02] church
[1:10:03] and went to mass she took in a family of
[1:10:06] eight
[1:10:07] to me that leaves grace that the fact
[1:10:10] that she put a roof over my head when my
[1:10:12] parents couldn't do it
[1:10:13] i say god have mercy have grace upon
[1:10:16] souls like that praise god
[1:10:18] when was the last time you took somebody
[1:10:19] in your house not only that but a family
[1:10:21] of eight
[1:10:24] and jesus said when you've done it to
[1:10:25] one of the least i hope i'm one of the
[1:10:27] least believers
[1:10:28] when the least of these my brother
[1:10:30] you've done it unto me
[1:10:31] praise god so there's a special group of
[1:10:35] people
[1:10:36] that get eternal life just because yeah
[1:10:39] they were good to those brothers
[1:10:44] i'm trusting in god's amazing grace to
[1:10:47] me this makes grace
[1:10:49] more amazing amen hallelujah
[1:10:52] it makes it more amazing
[1:10:56] they are not heirs so the bluish birds
[1:10:58] are not heirs to anything but life
[1:10:59] they share no throne etc with them their
[1:11:01] names must have been the book of life
[1:11:03] and not removed
[1:11:04] now because of their love of the people
[1:11:05] of god they are recognized and saved
[1:11:07] no doubt be served and help the children
[1:11:09] of god perhaps now
[1:11:10] that's a key word there perhaps that's
[1:11:13] the same word i used in my book i don't
[1:11:15] know we'll get to it
[1:11:15] but maybe this saturday i think it's in
[1:11:18] chapter one or
[1:11:19] i think it's in chapter two in my book i
[1:11:21] wrote in there i said i believe hindus
[1:11:23] can be saved muslims can be saved
[1:11:24] catholics jews you name them i believe
[1:11:27] god can save
[1:11:27] anybody that's good to the brethren but
[1:11:29] it's a perhaps
[1:11:32] so perhaps perhaps like nicodemus and
[1:11:35] gamalia camellia never
[1:11:37] became a christian but yet he stood for
[1:11:40] the children of god in the time of
[1:11:41] church
[1:11:45] my church you tell me
[1:11:48] you tell me justification signification
[1:11:52] baptism legos
[1:11:53] you tell me is someone who's justified
[1:11:55] do they have the effects of the blood
[1:11:58] yeah is it the full effects of the blood
[1:12:00] no
[1:12:02] but do they do they benefit from the
[1:12:04] effects of the blood of jesus christ you
[1:12:06] better believe it because the bible says
[1:12:09] we're justified by faith we have peace
[1:12:11] with god through our lord jesus christ
[1:12:13] much more than being now justified by
[1:12:15] his
[1:12:16] blood amen
[1:12:20] we shall be saved from wrath through him
[1:12:25] see churches we're saved by grace
[1:12:27] through faith we
[1:12:28] we often quote that from ephesians two
[1:12:30] eight nine and ten right
[1:12:31] but really paulie then he takes it back
[1:12:34] further in
[1:12:35] one of his greatest works he says really
[1:12:37] when you have faith you're trusting in
[1:12:39] the blood of jesus christ
[1:12:42] hallelujah that's what i'm trusting in
[1:12:44] this morning how many are trusting in
[1:12:46] the blood of jesus christ
[1:12:47] that he died for me he died for you
[1:12:51] and my faith in confidence is in christ
[1:12:53] amen
[1:12:54] in other words i heard a brother say it
[1:12:56] was very great he said now when i get to
[1:12:58] heaven he said
[1:12:59] and heaven and the angels brother johnny
[1:13:01] asked me for my resume
[1:13:03] i think barry green said he heard a
[1:13:04] story where he said the resume he's
[1:13:06] going to give him is jesus's resume
[1:13:09] amen praise god because i'm not trusting
[1:13:12] in my marriage
[1:13:13] i'm trusting in the blood of myself amen
[1:13:18] how can i get into heaven well i brought
[1:13:20] my resume uh jesus christ died for me
[1:13:23] praise god
[1:13:24] he became my sin that i might become his
[1:13:27] righteousness
[1:13:31] it takes all the doubt out of it it
[1:13:33] takes all the fear out of it
[1:13:34] because it's not based upon my blood or
[1:13:36] my effort it's based upon christ
[1:13:41] that's what martin luther had to restore
[1:13:43] to the church ages
[1:13:45] those that were you know trapped in that
[1:13:46] system there were still believers
[1:13:48] i can't wait to preach it there was
[1:13:49] believers all over the it's like the
[1:13:51] believers were on the outside of the
[1:13:52] roman kingdom but inside it was a
[1:13:54] corrupt system
[1:13:56] and like all the believers were hiding
[1:13:57] out on little islands in scotland
[1:14:00] they're out there by the name and
[1:14:01] they're just having peace
[1:14:06] and then all those saints were trapped
[1:14:07] inside just here in latin they're like
[1:14:09] what are they saying
[1:14:09] what does he say what are we doing and
[1:14:11] god had to annoy martin luther
[1:14:13] right out there he came out of a monk he
[1:14:15] became a man of god and he started
[1:14:17] calling them out
[1:14:18] the script the history says he called he
[1:14:20] won countless souls for jesus christ
[1:14:23] glory but god preserved it by having his
[1:14:25] little saints on the fringes of the
[1:14:28] european government i'll say it like
[1:14:29] that oh god is so merciful praise god
[1:14:32] he hides it from the eyes of the lies
[1:14:34] and fruit reveals it to vape such as
[1:14:39] church you tell me it catholic who's
[1:14:42] saved is he saved by the blood or not
[1:14:44] yeah yeah number one remember that's why
[1:14:47] i asked my college coach right before he
[1:14:48] died did i play you guys
[1:14:51] i said mr kushner i said are you
[1:14:53] trusting in the blood of jesus christ
[1:14:55] for your salvation
[1:14:56] i didn't say anything about the catholic
[1:14:57] church on purpose
[1:14:59] and i knew he only had a few hours or a
[1:15:01] few days left
[1:15:03] and i purposely worded it that way so
[1:15:05] it'd be an easy answer
[1:15:07] i said are you trusting in the blood of
[1:15:08] jesus christ for salvation yes
[1:15:11] yes i believe in jesus that church i
[1:15:14] believe i'll meet him at that day and
[1:15:15] praise god there's my 40 minutes so give
[1:15:16] me five more
[1:15:18] glory justified by the blood
[1:15:22] so see denominational people they only
[1:15:24] accept a portion of the atonement
[1:15:26] it's just like the the three three three
[1:15:28] rounds of the tabernacle right
[1:15:29] outer court blood inner court you have
[1:15:31] the holiest that's how you have the
[1:15:34] candlestick and the prayer and the bread
[1:15:36] right
[1:15:37] but then you had the life of god in the
[1:15:39] baptism of the holy ghost and the holy
[1:15:40] spirit but the outer core was all about
[1:15:43] blood amen
[1:15:44] that's what it was all about mercy blood
[1:15:47] substitutionary
[1:15:49] sacrifice taking death for us that
[1:15:52] believers might have life
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:57] the church do you know this i preach on
[1:15:58] this few weeks blind and jews are saved
[1:16:01] and given white robes by grace yet they
[1:16:03] deny they'll deny jesus as the messiah
[1:16:05] you know they'll just
[1:16:06] don't deny it till they die yet the
[1:16:09] bible said god will have mercy on them
[1:16:12] because he blinded them so
[1:16:15] if god can have mercy on the blinded uh
[1:16:18] jews what about the blinded foolish
[1:16:19] virgin
[1:16:21] because the god of this world has
[1:16:22] blinded the minds of them that believe
[1:16:24] not
[1:16:24] well let me prove it to you here okay
[1:16:27] now just so you know i found a quote
[1:16:28] brother man it's really good
[1:16:29] brother branham says uh this is okay
[1:16:32] 10 months before he died he's talking
[1:16:34] about the church age book with level i'm
[1:16:36] going to skip to the bottom
[1:16:38] he said i s he said and my tapes of the
[1:16:40] seven church agents have sent them to
[1:16:41] him to grammarize them because my old
[1:16:43] kentucky
[1:16:44] get hate and tote and carry and fetch
[1:16:46] that don't do no good for people who
[1:16:47] read the books
[1:16:48] so he was going to grammarize it for me
[1:16:49] and then after he got through it sent it
[1:16:51] back a couple of times for more
[1:16:52] statements
[1:16:53] so the only reason i'm showing this
[1:16:55] church is that you know brother branham
[1:16:57] saw that book
[1:16:58] more than a couple of times some people
[1:17:01] will say
[1:17:01] well brother i never saw you know when
[1:17:02] it was published nonsense
[1:17:04] he said i've seen it more than a couple
[1:17:06] times he knew what was in there
[1:17:09] he knew it was in there to see people
[1:17:12] just
[1:17:12] don't understand maybe they don't study
[1:17:14] hard enough and they don't pray enough i
[1:17:15] don't know
[1:17:16] but i would say like this i've not found
[1:17:18] one doctor in the church age book that i
[1:17:20] can't find in his regular sermons
[1:17:23] praise god and i love this one amen
[1:17:26] but wait till you get that book you'll
[1:17:28] understand it if you just
[1:17:30] got any light in you at all sorry amen
[1:17:34] if you've got any light of god any
[1:17:36] knowledge of god amen
[1:17:38] any anointing of god you'll believe the
[1:17:40] word of god that's written in that
[1:17:41] church book
[1:17:46] catholics are safe i've got plenty for
[1:17:48] you today i'm going to end with that
[1:17:50] brother jose
[1:17:52] you don't believe catholics should be
[1:17:53] safe oh yeah the graph said they can be
[1:17:55] saved
[1:17:56] because the bible says they can be saved
[1:17:59] praise god the bible says
[1:18:03] so i believe that a person is saved if
[1:18:04] he's a methodist baptist catholic or
[1:18:05] whatever he
[1:18:06] may be if he's solemnly trusting jesus
[1:18:09] christ for his grace
[1:18:12] but if he's catholic and believing the
[1:18:13] church saves him then he's lost that's
[1:18:14] why i asked my coach i didn't ask him
[1:18:16] about the church
[1:18:17] i started trusting in the blood of jesus
[1:18:18] christ
[1:18:22] if he's a pentecost that believes the
[1:18:24] church saves him he's lost look at that
[1:18:26] you have tongues you can have shouts and
[1:18:28] loud noises but if you're trusting in
[1:18:30] your church you're lost amen
[1:18:35] but no matter what he is what church he
[1:18:36] goes to if he is soundly depending on
[1:18:38] the blood and merits of jesus christ he
[1:18:40] saved
[1:18:40] i don't care what church he's in for
[1:18:42] it's by faith we're saved and that by
[1:18:44] grace
[1:18:49] the catholic church a catholic a roman
[1:18:50] catholic or orthodox or whatever he may
[1:18:52] be
[1:18:52] if he's looking to the catholic church
[1:18:54] for salvation the person's lost
[1:18:55] if the baptist looked into the baptist
[1:18:57] church for salvation he's lost
[1:18:58] if the pentecost is looking for the
[1:19:00] pentecostal church for salvation
[1:19:02] he's lost but if the catholic
[1:19:03] pentecostal baptist presbyterian or
[1:19:05] whatever
[1:19:06] if they saw me trusting in jesus christ
[1:19:08] be saved
[1:19:10] because it's by faith are you saved and
[1:19:12] that by grace see catholics can be saved
[1:19:14] baptists can be saved by the gospels are
[1:19:16] saved because that we all accept what
[1:19:18] christ did for us that's right
[1:19:20] it's our own personal faith and a
[1:19:21] finished work that christ did for us
[1:19:23] and therefore i've never drawn a
[1:19:24] denominational boundary
[1:19:26] or had a barrier now how many message
[1:19:28] churches do that
[1:19:30] only go to heaven if you're part of our
[1:19:34] message
[1:19:36] i've tried to reach out and take every
[1:19:38] one of them in my arms and point them to
[1:19:39] the cross now
[1:19:41] i hear you praise god you haven't got
[1:19:44] no right to heaven do you believe god
[1:19:46] accepted by the basis of faith
[1:19:48] upon the shed blood of jesus christ the
[1:19:50] son of god have no rights for
[1:19:52] one for no other way no matter you might
[1:19:55] be a staunch member pentecostal to the
[1:19:57] core
[1:19:58] uh methodist baptist or catholic to the
[1:20:00] core makes no difference
[1:20:01] what church you belong to if you're
[1:20:02] solemnly believed on jesus christ and
[1:20:04] accepted him as your
[1:20:05] personal savior you're facing him i
[1:20:07] don't care what church you go to you're
[1:20:09] saved by
[1:20:10] faith and without that there's no holy
[1:20:12] church there's no holy people
[1:20:14] it's the holy spirit of the people which
[1:20:15] makes it holy a holy god that lives
[1:20:17] amongst people
[1:20:18] what makes the holiness not something
[1:20:20] that i do something you do or something
[1:20:22] that we would
[1:20:23] would have done but it's what god has
[1:20:25] done for us through christ jesus
[1:20:26] that's the bible amen
[1:20:30] now remember you catholic people brother
[1:20:31] and i'm catholic i don't care
[1:20:33] a catholic can be saved as anything
[1:20:35] where are these people getting these
[1:20:36] ideas from anyway
[1:20:39] what are they where they get some of
[1:20:40] these ideas
[1:20:42] i'm baptist all right well i'm
[1:20:43] pentecostal a panic also
[1:20:45] can be saved just anybody else can be
[1:20:48] but if you haven't got
[1:20:50] now look at this the token israel this
[1:20:52] is after the seals
[1:20:55] hope i'm all about the blood right
[1:20:57] israel slain lamb was god's requirement
[1:20:59] jehovah required a slain lamb an
[1:21:01] innocent substitute
[1:21:02] as we've been through a week gone by now
[1:21:04] that god when he makes a decision he
[1:21:06] never changed it
[1:21:07] and he made a way his first thing that
[1:21:09] he did was when man had fallen he had to
[1:21:11] make a way for him back if he ever
[1:21:12] wanted to redeem him
[1:21:13] and made a decision that he saved man by
[1:21:15] the blood or of an innocent one
[1:21:17] and he's forever done the same thing he
[1:21:19] has never changed it
[1:21:20] no place will god ever meet any
[1:21:22] worshiper only under the blood
[1:21:24] that's his only place we try to make it
[1:21:27] me under theology under our denomination
[1:21:29] under our educational programs
[1:21:31] see church that's why he won't meet in a
[1:21:32] message church just because it's message
[1:21:35] it's got to believe in the blood of
[1:21:36] christ amen
[1:21:38] churches can denominate just as bad if
[1:21:40] not or more awful amen
[1:21:42] than other denominational churches right
[1:21:45] it doesn't matter what the church name
[1:21:46] is or anything like that it's do the
[1:21:48] people
[1:21:49] believe and trust in the blood of jesus
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:52] praise god someone's built towers and
[1:21:55] someone's built cities battle line tower
[1:21:56] battle all kinds of different things but
[1:21:58] it still remains
[1:21:59] god only makes the true worse for under
[1:22:00] the blood he never changes it we all
[1:22:02] can't be
[1:22:03] we can't all be methodists we cannot be
[1:22:04] pentecostals cannot be this the other we
[1:22:06] just
[1:22:06] disagree but when i came to a man so i
[1:22:09] come to a man let him be
[1:22:10] catholic priest
[1:22:14] the people that are closest to the uh
[1:22:17] the transubstantiation right the way for
[1:22:19] the
[1:22:19] wine or whatever he is when he's under
[1:22:22] that blood
[1:22:22] we are
[1:22:27] care what where he's at as long as
[1:22:38] let me see what i got here
[1:22:41] what's that oh
[1:22:44] let me close this that's that's cool
[1:22:48] you know people people don't believe in
[1:22:50] that perhaps quote i believe in it
[1:22:52] i believe nicodemus will be saved
[1:22:54] humilia anyone that was good to the
[1:22:56] brother if the thief on the cross was
[1:22:58] saved
[1:22:58] these guys definitely would be saved he
[1:23:00] was a murderer and then he was mocking
[1:23:02] jesus
[1:23:02] when he was first crucified but by the
[1:23:04] end he had a changed heart
[1:23:06] the bible said both thieves were mocking
[1:23:08] him
[1:23:09] right if jesus saved him without even
[1:23:12] being baptized
[1:23:13] then jesus will always be able to save
[1:23:15] like that
[1:23:20] now here this is this is not maybe
[1:23:21] personal for our church it's a very
[1:23:23] personal subject
[1:23:25] but just like brother brown said there
[1:23:26] might be a chance adulterers can go on
[1:23:28] the rapture
[1:23:30] people that have been married twice
[1:23:31] three times
[1:23:36] how many brothers said that a couple
[1:23:39] people
[1:23:41] now this is this is the whole question
[1:23:43] but brother maryam inserts this whole
[1:23:44] comment it's a big
[1:23:45] i'm coming lil graham if a man has been
[1:23:47] married or divorced he just says how
[1:23:48] awful that is that's so sad you know
[1:23:50] he said people weren't taught has been
[1:23:53] married and divorced and then remarried
[1:23:54] of a woman who has also been married
[1:23:56] divorced
[1:23:56] then married to him these two can be
[1:23:58] married and god say are they married to
[1:23:59] god's side how can
[1:24:01] both or one of them be in the rapture
[1:24:04] the guy says how i don't know i couldn't
[1:24:06] tell you the question is can they be in
[1:24:08] the rapture
[1:24:08] divorce each one of them divorced each
[1:24:10] one of them has a living companion then
[1:24:12] they
[1:24:12] married again both them married again
[1:24:14] and now this this woman has a living
[1:24:15] husband this
[1:24:16] man has a living wife now they've got
[1:24:18] children and so forth want to come to
[1:24:19] god can they go in the rapture
[1:24:21] that'll be up to the heavenly father
[1:24:26] i couldn't answer that but he said i'll
[1:24:28] say or i saw one thing
[1:24:30] the bible said they should be called
[1:24:32] that they that become doctor the bible
[1:24:33] said doctor will not inherit the kingdom
[1:24:35] of heaven
[1:24:36] let's see that's a little clue to me
[1:24:37] church if the kingdom of heaven is the
[1:24:40] ruler
[1:24:41] rulership hierarchy i hate to say it
[1:24:44] like this but so you understand
[1:24:45] the elite christians you never
[1:24:48] understand
[1:24:49] they're just they're just more dedicated
[1:24:50] christians they just love god more
[1:24:54] right a doctor will not
[1:24:58] inherit the kingdom of heaven but man
[1:25:01] use this scripture it says
[1:25:02] perhaps they can be saved that's all i
[1:25:05] can say i know that just kills me to say
[1:25:06] that but i can't say what the word says
[1:25:08] he says i can't say but what the word
[1:25:09] says i must stay with that i hope that's
[1:25:12] all wrong
[1:25:12] there's places now look what he does
[1:25:14] there's places in the bible i'm not
[1:25:16] advising you but let me just give you a
[1:25:17] little scripture
[1:25:18] remember brother branham had a church
[1:25:20] that was full of people married to him
[1:25:24] they were full because people weren't
[1:25:25] taught the right way my brother had said
[1:25:27] they also didn't pray about it hard
[1:25:28] enough
[1:25:30] right so he's trying to be very gentle
[1:25:34] see sometimes he can be so hard right
[1:25:36] you know and then sometimes he can be so
[1:25:38] gentle
[1:25:40] he said please though if you're living
[1:25:42] happy with your husband and living happy
[1:25:43] with your wife please remain that way
[1:25:44] let's go for it preach american divorce
[1:25:46] you preach that february 65. because i
[1:25:49] told you don't leave
[1:25:50] them little children without a home god
[1:25:52] is made now look he says god has made
[1:25:54] restitution and
[1:25:55] places for people that did things wrong
[1:25:58] you remember jesus said of dave when he
[1:26:00] was hungry he entered the temple of god
[1:26:01] eat the shoe bread which was
[1:26:03] only lawful for the priest and it was
[1:26:05] found blameless
[1:26:07] so david entered into a a a position
[1:26:10] that wasn't his and ate a food that
[1:26:12] wasn't his by the word but yet god had
[1:26:14] mercy on him
[1:26:17] the priest also blasphemed the sabbath
[1:26:19] upon the sabbath day are found blameless
[1:26:22] and the greater than sabbath was here
[1:26:24] see let's just leave it up to god and go
[1:26:26] ahead
[1:26:26] and just live just live for christ now
[1:26:31] he says you might have made mistakes in
[1:26:33] the past he said leave that up to god
[1:26:35] he said but live all you have right now
[1:26:37] for jesus christ right now
[1:26:41] let's see their might so see i use the
[1:26:43] word perhaps perhaps gamalia nicodemus
[1:26:46] perhaps maybe might the doctors might be
[1:26:49] in the rapture
[1:26:50] they might there might be a chance of
[1:26:53] you hitting it
[1:26:55] don't make two wrongs never make the
[1:26:57] right one just go on and live the way
[1:26:59] you are
[1:26:59] if you're happy together you might have
[1:27:00] the wrong companion i'll say this one
[1:27:02] thing if you got the wrong company of
[1:27:03] this
[1:27:04] this wife in this life you'll never have
[1:27:06] in the other one all wrongs will be made
[1:27:08] right
[1:27:08] let's stand on our feet
[1:27:12] now church i have all those quotes um i
[1:27:15] preached this in 2016.
[1:27:18] brother ram over and over and over again
[1:27:20] says that
[1:27:22] he said is that people just make a few
[1:27:26] they misunderstand a few quotes
[1:27:32] so see church see see how the we have to
[1:27:34] make sure and i don't know i'm sure
[1:27:35] prairie green didn't do it but
[1:27:37] i know there's people because i've
[1:27:38] talked to i know there's people that say
[1:27:39] there's no salvation outside the message
[1:27:45] if you do that you're cutting off you're
[1:27:46] saying they don't even have access to
[1:27:48] the blood of jesus christ
[1:27:49] you just drew a circle around yourself
[1:27:51] in your church and that's it
[1:27:52] the brother man always tried to make the
[1:27:54] circle bigger
[1:27:56] even for something like adultery
[1:28:01] which it would seem like they couldn't
[1:28:03] but he said perhaps
[1:28:04] just live for god with all your heart
[1:28:08] musicians if you'll come we'll sing a
[1:28:09] couple songs
[1:28:12] you can go ahead and turn off the live
[1:28:13] stream just so i don't forget
[1:28:17] where he's gone now george was this was
[1:28:18] this helpful today my gosh grace
[1:28:20] i want you
