========================================

physicians thank you appreciate that let's take our bibles tonight by god's grace let's go to hebrews chapter six i'd like to go back to the doctrine series uh for a shorter message here tonight and then lord willing we'll get back to colossians lord willing on sunday so you kind of see how that goes by god's grace just as we're led of the lord uh sorry hebrews chapter six yes hebrews chapter six you know i got a nice email i shared with my wife from some brother over season he's like i was just struggling with the message you know all these questions about the message people leaving the message and then he said i watched your sermon on sunday morning a sunday morning message about colossians and he said it totally gave me victory over my battle so i just said praise the lord amen i said me too oh it's a combination of all the all the blessings and victories god gives us praise god so i just want to encourage you with that let's go to hebrews chapter 6 verse 1. i like to look at the power of the apostles doctrine again and continue to talk about or preach on some scriptures and of course talk about them i'll read hebrews six one through three and if i uh if i have a little time at the end i'd like to preach just a few verses about uh denominational systems like austin and lena and faith and i were talking about on the way here might be good just to preach some of those if we have a few minutes you know kind of see how that goes so hebrews 6 verse 1. hebrews 6 1. i'm gonna get my place here let's all read verse one together okay and then i'll read two and three because it's a little bit long there hebrews 6 1. let's just read verse one together ready one two three therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from good works and of faith toward god now let me read verse two myself of the doctrine of baptism so see there's two different kinds of baptisms right and of the laying on of hands and of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment actually let's all read verse three can we one two three and this will we do if god permit if god permit we will move on from elementary teachings or or uh beginning christian doctrines and we'll move on to the more mature ones if god will permit praise god let's have a word of prayer let's ask the lord to bless our preaching here give us understanding and revelation and wisdom heavenly father we just bow our heads again we're thankful lord to sing these songs we're so glad that we'll be in that number when the saints go marching in lord i believe that you've indicated in each one of our hearts lord god and we're so grateful and lord in fact the longer i serve you lord the more i'm convinced i'm going to be in that number lord not because of me but because of your everlasting grace lord god your mercy renews every morning lord you guide me into all truth you keep me from evil lord you you're so gracious you you give us testimonies you use our bodies you use our lips and our minds to bless people in akron and around the world lord you're so gracious and so merciful and so we just want to say we love you tonight lord bless us as we minister your word lord anoint me anoint your people each one of us god may we feel your presence lord may we receive lord the revelation of the holy ghost tonight god that will give us grace lord strengthen the time of need lord god that will give us victory lord in this hour we know you are an ever-present help lord god to all those who are in need so lord we're in need of your help lord maybe not physically lord but maybe spiritually no doubt lord god so let your holy spirit be a shield around us let it be a buckler lord let it be a hedge about us i pray as we uh settle in here lord and hear the word of god annoying each one in jesus christ's name and everybody said amen god bless you as you being seen and praise god so we'll look at part four of the power of the apostles doctrine i do have some slides here i'd like to um just kind of keep us uh you know on uh the nice track here to to preach these scriptures here and this thought about the power of the apostles doctrine so the apostles basically had jesus's doctrine and they were filled with jesus's spirit and we saw they went away they went around doing miracles signs and wonders but we also saw how they filled all jerusalem with their doctrine and jesus said go into all the world and teach the gospel to every creature right every nation so you have to have both praise god you have to have both power and doctrine praise god so we're thankful for all that god is doing praise god and and uh let's look at this thought of mastering elementary doctrines in hebrews 6. now if you have your bibles go back up to uh verse 10 of chapter five so go to the previous chapter and verse 10. so hebrews 5 verse 10. just to kind of give us this this is a scripture i referenced often throughout the years it gives you a good understanding here about what is a mature believer like what kind of life do they live okay so leading up to what we read is chapter 5 verse 10 says called of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek this speaking of jesus christ he's in a high priest a relationship with us right now in other words he's making the intercession for our prayers to god the invisible god so aren't you glad church you have a high priest in heaven he intercedes for your prayers he's the one that hears your prayers and then he intercedes to the invisible father amen and now verse 11. now here where we get into some real rebukes the author of the book is rebuking the hebrew church here verse 11 of whom we have many things to say speaking of christ right and hard to be uttered so it's hard to speak these things seeing you are dull of hearing so the writer's actually saying your ears aren't very sharp to hearing revelations right he said the writer's saying i know you can't receive a lot of deep teachings how would how do you like if somebody came in here and said we're you're just a baby church and you can't receive many deep teachings i'd feel bad i'd feel awful but i feel like we're a mature church praise god we can receive the deeper teachings of the bible praise god we can go beyond you know just being saved and being loving and being kind and uh being a good christian we can go down that to the deeper things of god we can start lord by god's grace finding the perfect will of god for our lives praise god we can learn how to uh we can learn how to pray we can learn how to overcome we can learn how to intercede for others praise god amen we can learn how our gifts operate we can learn the perfect will where god wants us to be on the job or where god wants us to be in the home we can learn that and know for sure and we can live so close to god i'll say like this that no man could deceive us amen like my dad taught me years ago my dad backslid but he did teach me the greatest lesson in my life he said know jesus christ so well that no man can deceive you that's never left me since i've been 9 or 10 or 11 that that lesson has never left me and that's what i've sought to do i've sought to know the word and i'm not perfect of course but i want to know the bible know the word so well that no preacher or no man in general no woman can deceive me but i will have the holy spirit inside of me to tell me what is the truth to keep that to hold fast that which is good and then reject anything that's not in the holy scripture amen now verse 12 he says this church is a dull of hearing they don't hear the word really well verse 12 for when for the time you ought to be teachers so you ought to be so mature you could teach others he says you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god okay he said so you've been a long or you've been around long enough you should be able to teach other people but he says you can't all right so see think of think of our lives what could we teach somebody what has god showed us that we could teach others hopefully there's a lot praise god amen hopefully if somebody asks you a certain question about a certain thing you know could you teach them about it could you teach them about you know prayer or fasting or reading the bible or the seven seals or the seven church ages or how to raise your children could you teach them about that amen hallelujah these are all things we should learn and grow and become more mature and praise god and then he says finishing the verse he says uh you are i'm sorry you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god imagine that you were around so long you're around so long and you get so lazy on god that you forget the very first things can you imagine that's what this church had come to and he said i can't teach you many deep things because you've forgotten the very beginning points praise god now look what he compares he compares it to a baby like little hannah he says and and are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat i doubt hannah's feasting on uh chipotle you know on the on the sundays or you know a chicken or a steak you know and so that's what paul's comparing the church is like a baby church they can't preach them a lot of deep things praise god gonna teach them uh the simple things and he's gonna talk about these later as we read for our text so people can do that they can hang around church a while but if they don't keep learning if they don't put into practice what they've learned they become dull of hearing they become they become less spiritual and they actually forget the very principles of christianity we're not going to be that church amen we're going to be a mature church that grows in grace and knowledge of god amen the bible says we're going to grow from faith to faith from glory to glory amen from revelation to revelation amen that's how we're going to grow praise god we're not going to backslide on god and get bored with god and forget what god has taught us we're going to remember what god taught us amen verse 13 for everyone that uses milk okay or elementary the first teachings is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a babe so if a preacher just preaches milk all the time and i've been to those churches i'm not i'm not condemning them necessarily but you've been in churches where the pastors preached is the same thing it sounds like the same thing over and over now if you're in a series with me yes i'm going to say a lot of the same things over and over but each time i should add some new things but if you go to church it's just the same thing over and over year after year month after month then you know that preacher is a baby he has stopped feeding on the things of god he can't handle the deep things of god anymore i'm glad when i come in the message brothers i'm glad a lot of things went over my head that shows that that church was not a milk church hallelujah amen right and so we see that we want to be a church where we grow in our understanding we can handle more of the word now no doubt you can handle longer sermons right so thank you for that but hopefully those sermons have more meat in them too praise god like sunday amen you know understanding about the book of colossians in our lives and how that i've never heard that preach before that was i just saw it on the video wow that's great history and tied in like that that was just to me it was just beautiful to me i needed that right we need that for that that moment we need it and the holy spirit gives us what we have need for that moment but these ones were babes they forgotten the very initial things right so like for example uh if somebody come up to they want to be baptized which one of you could just walk them through now not not even even the sisters not even not even being a preacher but just saying well here's what you could do i mean could we all explain that you know that's what it's like we'd have to be ready to understand the main principles right or the early foundational principles how can you even get saved right how can i how can i find the perfect will of god who could explain that you know hopefully we can all explain it by god's grace how do you find the perfect will of god how do you begin to please god how do you live a christian life you know just these early simple questions we've got to grow be we have to learn that but then we have to grow beyond that and also be ready to teach other people too amen and that's you know parents is built into your job description right so your whole life teaches your children and so that's a good thing about parenting you're constantly teaching you're constantly learning and you're constantly modeling whether how much you say it or not you're modeling how to live a life and you're teaching your children nonetheless right now verse 14 this is the scripture i've loved and i've mentioned for many years but strong meat so churches that can handle steak preaching right belong to them that are of full age so you got to be mature to handle the meat of the word even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil so a mature christian is one who they get stronger each service amen they get spirits they grow each service amen hallelujah praise god and they're able by the holy spirit to detect am i growing closer and they know i'm growing closer to god and i'm not growing farther from god i can handle more of the word than i have before praise god now that's what i love about making youtube videos because i'm challenged constantly because if i hadn't made a video about it then maybe i can't explain it very well so i'm challenged constantly because i gotta explain in a way that anybody can receive it right it's a real challenge come up with a new topic every couple weeks you know we really got to study it so i know i like that it's not for popularity it's not for money but i do it because i know people need it it helps me but it also helps the people too and the bible says we should always have an answer ready for the reason of the hope that we have within us amen the bible tells us always have an answer ready and so mature christians they keep they feed they feed on the word of god every service they get stronger and they're able to detect the devil more often right we should we should drop throughout the day we should detect when the enemy's bringing in a temptation right we should be able to detect that you know in the in the in the comic world spiderman had a spidey sense you remember that he could like detect at the last moment oh that green goblin's coming around you're not that's cause i'm i used to watch that when i was a kid well that's how the holy spirit is right we get a sense as we get more mature we can sense when the devil or something's not right here this uh that like you hear so you'll sometimes hear a preacher and then they'll say something oh no that was wrong it just it's brother i'm calling like a buzzer inside of you praise god a buzzer goes off like you know something's wrong with that and as you become a christian glory that buzzer should get louder amen hallelujah praise god thank you jesus amen it should get loud you should be able to start detecting when it's right and when it's wrong praise god now with this background that's where we get to our text there tonight okay so we must master elementary doctrines and be able to teach others about it as well praise god like i i'm sorry army mercy forgive me i didn't even eat really before church forgive me but a brother emailed me this week and he said how can i redeem the time i see you talking about being a wise virgin and how does the wise version redeem the time and so i explain why i gotta get up two and a half hours before my kids get up so i can have time with the lord myself i said in that two and a half hours i'll study i'll pray i'll read my bible i'll prepare sermons or youtube videos i'll pay the bills i'll return emails that's the only way i can do it you know that's i gotta i gotta make the most of that time praise god if i get a little tired by the end of the day that's a that's a small sacrifice to have that time that's quiet in the lord one-on-one with the lord in the morning praise god that's a small sacrifice right and i'm just saying you know you got to go to you got to go to lengths if you want a closer walk with god you've got to go to greater lengths to get there praise god right we all know insanity's doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results we all they say that in education they say that sports like if you do the same thing you're just going to get the same results but you got to do something if you want more of god you got to do something more praise god okay and i'm not saying you know we're not getting into legalism or anything like that but we're getting in a way where how can we continually grow as a christian and the way to do it like we were saying you have to die to yourself every day you have to say i'm not going to live for myself today i'm not going to live live to the lust of my eyes the lust of my flesh or the pride of life i'm going to live for the holy spirit today praise god i'm going to crucify my desires and i'm going to do what i know the lord desires because the bible tells me what the lord desires amen the lord desires that you seek him first the lord desires that you seek his righteousness first amen you seek his righteousness you seek his kingdom you seek you seek that and if you do that god will take care of everything else amen hallelujah first things first holy that's a good song there first things first we seek god first because of his worth right his worth he's the most worthy thing he's he's the most important thing the greatest thing we can invest our time into is the holy spirit praise god god's word and so we seek god first and then everything else works out how many can say amen to that you see god first everything else will work out it always does praise god now that's that's for a mature christian you have to discern good and evil in your life amen discerning good and evil like jesus did it all the time people come up and ask him questions he bug you're not asking that yeah he said you're not asking that he said you're reasoning in your heart he would just he would just discern them right away he said he said good master uh teaches the greatest commandment he said why you call me good there's only one good he could detect that spirit of flattering right he could detect that he could detect their tricks they said by what authority do this he said let me ask you by what authority was john's baptism right he could detect that he could sense that evil praise god and i had a i had another interaction since i'll just since i've been talking about it on youtube where somebody said you're under a deceiving spirit because you did this and that and i wrote back i said no i said i explained the whole situation i said no you didn't know this this this that i said and i said you're under a impatient spirit and he said you're right hallelujah see when somebody doesn't know things for a week or two weeks in this case the brother didn't know three weeks he didn't know all these things that were happening and then he accused me because i didn't respond in three weeks you're under a spirit of deception i said no i'm not second i can i can discern that i know the truth amen and then i could call out his spirit and recognize he and he said pray for me i do need more patience amen i didn't pray for him just a simple prayer just something like that like you can detect when someone you can do it you can detect when somebody's trying to criticize you and it's unfair amen now maybe you wouldn't have been able to do that earlier in your christian journey but now you can detect when they're criticized now here's the hard one when they're flattering you that's the hard one when you're like oh you're just the best pastor you're the best preacher be very careful with that that can be the devil the bible says flattery worketh ruin that's what that's the book of proverbs says so be careful it's easy to detect the criticizing one because none of us like criticism right i don't like it it's not easy but the flattery's the tough part when they're flattering in order to move you to do something for their own selfish desires right they're flattering you that's what he said oh good master jesus good master he said who's there's none good but god he can detect that in there so let's be careful church what we receive all the time let's be careful who's complimenting us be careful not to be deceived by other people praise god because church what i found is a lot of people that even left this church in other churches what they're after is power they want power and influence like one person left because uh they were a deacon one person left our church years ago uh and they're a deacon and one time i was out i think i was sick or something like that and our bylaw says they're supposed to be able to come in and preach a sermon or do a bible study well i forgot about the bylaws and so this person uh uh was basically gasping about me behind my back and and then it come down to it they just wanted the pulpit they just wanted to teach so instead of saying oh he just made a mistake they they've gossiped or the gossip about me and spread it around the church it's been years ago so many you probably don't remember maybe hopefully they didn't get to everybody but i just forgot so i just canceled the service i knew i couldn't be there i think i was sick or something like that but they kind of spread a little gossip around the church like well the deacon's supposed to do a teaching that day what they want to do they just want to get to the pulpit they just wanted power instead of saying oh brother that's okay i understand you forgot we love you instead of being kind and sweet they started contention the bible said wherever there's contention there's pride another in fact the bible says contention only comes by pride amen it wasn't long after that there was other problems wasn't long after that bye bye you know praying and the praying and asking god to remove that spirit and the spirit left maybe i didn't preach that one before but that's true and before was flattery flattery flattery but as soon as i did something they didn't like oh no gossip time bash in the preacher time which i probably i did make a mistake i forgot about it i said i'm sorry but rather than accept the apology gossip about it oh see look he's he's not even a good preacher he's not even a good pastor he makes so many mistakes he makes all these mistakes show me one person who doesn't make a mistake only jesus never made mistakes so see that's just a simple example there of how you got to discern that and i knew as soon as he started criticizing me i'm like that's the devil that's the devil that ain't god the bible says the holy spirit is long suffering that means i could do that sin two weeks in a row or just a mistake right forgetful three weeks in a row and you can still forgive me because you're long-suffering amen it's not short suffering it's long-suffering amen hallelujah just some simple wisdom there for us by god's grace now i'm trying to get to this text okay so let's start reading here before i before i forget here now in our text now the writer which we believe was paul now some people don't agree so that's why i say just the author but i believe it is paul but i don't have proof for it so i just i'm just saying it just sounds like paul's language that he uses in the other books that he or other letters that he writes therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on to perfection so what are we saying he's saying this he said you're a church that you're dull of hearing he says you need to learn these principles again before we can go on to the other ones right and remember he says this will only do if god will permit it okay so let me put them up here so here's the scriptures we read now here i'm just going to skip ahead here's the six elementary doctrines the author says now i personally don't know if this is for every church i imagine it would be but i can't prove that by the bible uh but there are six things you need that we shouldn't forget and the church said amen in other words do not forget these if you forget these you're a babe and you're not fit to teach the congregation or your children or your brother or your sister you're not fit to teach anybody if you forget these amen let's go through these just real briefly okay the first one is uh the doctrine of christ i'm sorry uh the doctrine of repentance from dead works so dead works means you're a sinner and you work for yourself right all your works are selfishly motivated but real repentance means you stop working works of the flesh and you start working the works of the holy spirit praise god in other words this is the doctrine of repentance real if you really repent you will change your ways if you really say you're sorry then you'll try to find a way to stop cussing you'll try to find a way to stop lusting right you're trying to find a way to stop arguing and debating and slandering right if you're really repentant you will stop doing those works and you'll change your works everybody will see your works are different praise god you're a new creature in christ amen repentance from dead works and remember what are the works of the flesh let me read that in galatians five i just kind of came to me thank you lord uh galatians five didn't have any notes because now the works of the flesh yes are these this is galatians 5 19 i'm sorry i don't have it up there adultery right so you have to repent men and women cannot sleep with uh people other than their own husbands or wives and if they repent they won't do it anymore right and they won't divorce they'll forgive and stay together because they they promise god we're together until death and you better not break your promise with god okay so that's the first one fornication sex before marriage right repenting of that means it stops praise god third uncleanness now that's that's that word luxurious living so when you spend your money on luxurious things they're not even necessary you got to repent from that and stop spending your money on that and give your money to god or the family or something like that you have to stop blessing after luxury now lecheviousness is lawlessness which means i can live however i want i'm going to go to heaven no matter what that's lasciviousness the bible says without holiness no man will see the lord amen but holiness means sacredness if you don't live a sacred set apart life from the world you won't see god now the beautiful thing about god is that you can repent on your last breath and you'll be saved that's the beautiful thing about god the thief on the cross you can be separated that last few seconds of your life and go to heaven amen that's grace amen grace grace god's grace amen more of grace to know because you become separate from your dead works right some people have a hard time about that but look at the thief on the cross he was mocking jesus as they're getting crucified but by the end he's saying this man has no sin remember me and jesus said today not tomorrow amen today you'll be with me in paradise amen you'll instantly as soon as you die you'll be with me in abraham's bosom instantly hours after mocking the lord jesus christ so why don't you come down and save us the bible said they were all casting the same in his teeth that's mercy amen that's amazing grace jesus i sing for all that you've done for me amen that's amazing grace hallelujah but for those of us who live longer praise god we should leave the dead works and start doing the works of the spirit now there's a whole bunch of lists of idolatry witchcraft hatred variance so like divisions emulations right uh competition wrath strife seditions heresies endings murders drunkenness revelings and those that do them will not inherit the kingdom of god that's the very first basic step of a baby christian you cannot do evil works and be a christian you have to repent from dead works and live new works do works that manifest god's love amen hallelujah and if you can't explain that then you're still a baby but you have to like also i've heard austin do it many times so bro that's what i know you're on the road buddy you're doing good man he was always saying repentance means you never do it again you turn around and go the other direction because we're together all the time we talk about all these doctrinal issues and everything like that that's what it is that's the first one you got to repent you haven't repented now the second is faith toward god you have to have faith or trust in god you can't trust in man the bible said kurt it's abomination to put your trust in man that's a bible that's a bible foundation if you're going to be a christian you've got to have faith in god you got to know you got to trust god even if things don't look like they're going to work out trust god they're going to work out amen in other words this means be patient with god have faith in god trust his ways if he gives you a promise he gives you a word [Music] he's going to back it up it's just as unfailing as god is amen any promise of god is just as eternal as god is and you have to learn these baby milk you have to drink this baby milk can i say like that you have to this is baby milk here this is because we go on from this if god allows it amen thank god he's allowed it amen hallelujah we've been able to go beyond this praise god into the deeper things of god hallelujah like joshua amen yes brother it could yeah it could if that if that hinders your faith because any science that is true that's god yeah like gravity that's god you're not going to be gravity yep so that's good brother good good question yeah trusting so that's like scientists or atheists and they trust in god like i was reading the other day about uh darwin you know evolution he didn't start that that was like that's hundreds if not thousands of years old he's just the famous one that put his name on it you know the oh yeah not at all and so this is uh this is the building blocks this is the baby food for real christians right here amen next doctrine of baptisms now i got a scripture on my heart go to matthew i think it's matthew chapter 3. now i could be wrong but just go there yeah hallelujah matthew 3 11. there it is yeah matthew 11. now here's where we get doctrines of baptism there's two kinds of baptisms actually i'll say like this there's three yeah i just caught one i just got one here i mean i should have known i've known it already but there's at least three there could be more actually yeah so let me show you what i'm talking about uh i got it on the other document well yeah i you know i this may be my thought brother but let me just show you what i'm talking about this is what i'm talking about right here i'm talking about uh i'm talking about this uh yeah so let's read yeah we're talking about the spirit and the soul yes very good and then you have spirit soul water right so you have water baptism but then you also have the baptism in your human mind yep samification then you have the baptismal holy ghost in your soul so there's like at least three there's at least three yeah so here you know this verse says you have three parts you have a body now i took the body off because that's so obvious everybody knows they had a body that's the part that fails all the time that's that's my biggest enemy is my body the one i hate uh now the second part is your mind your human spirit that's your thinking now your innermost part is your soul that's your nature where's nature here she's where she is she out there okay i missed her i probably use her name more than anybody else's name but if faith comes i'm gonna be using her name a lot too we're here a lot of face names i use maokai a lot too maokai for you know a lot of virtue yeah i use virtue a lot too virtue um so in matthew 3 11 john said i indeed baptize you with water there's a water baptism unto repentance but he that cometh is mightier than me whose shoes i'm not worth about to bear he shall baptize you with the holy ghost and fire okay so you have a holy ghost baptism in the soul you have a water baptism but the old testament they only had the anointing or baptism in their minds okay so the doctrine of baptism that's john 7 39. this proves it it's just been a very uh it's been a very foundational scripture for us john 7 39. everybody awesome when you get that can you read that buddy take your time no rush we got it playing time but this fake kia the spirit amen praise god jesus is almost ready to to to be sacrificed right here this is john 7 he's almost ready to be arrested and the bible says the holy ghost cannot be given now what it means is it couldn't be given the soul because they were their sins were only covered by animal blood and that could never put away sin it just covered it for a little while but when jesus came he was the lamb of god and the bible said that he forgives all our transgressions amen he washes away all of our sins amen he's the real lamb of god hallelujah yes yes sir in the soul yes sir nope he only had it out here his whole life yeah that's what the bible said the bible said john saw the spirit like a dove descended on him and then remained on him and the bible said as soon as he left his baptism he was full of the holy ghost and power let's read that why don't we read that yeah yes sir yeah so his body was the word brother his body had a word nature he didn't have a sin nature like we have but the holy ghost only anointed his outer spirit right and he remember he never did miracles till after he got the holy ghost yeah yeah that's beautiful yeah praise the lord see look we're growing tonight aren't we did you feel that just push down a little more praise god just push down a little more of that divine love amen now let's go to luke uh believe it's luke chapter 3 if i'm not mistaken i could be wrong could be luke 4. yeah if you go to luke 4 verse 1 brother yeah now this says where he now he's filled with the holy ghost but i'll show you also where the other one is okay so john 4 i'm sorry luke 4 1 and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness okay now go to john chapter 1. we were just there in john 7 but now go to john 1 verse 32. so it was at jesus baptism that the holy spirit descended like a dove anointed his soul filled his soul and then now he's filled with the holy spirit and he goes out and awareness right away to be tested by the devil so look what happens brother after we get the holy ghost that's when the real test comes see it's a glorious thing to receive the holy ghost but you're going to be tested you ask brother amen and sister ask them about the test they went through yeah when you get the holy ghost it's a great thing but then watch it watch right after that it's most likely devil's going to come and try to knock you out but you got to stand there with what just the word just like jesus it's written devil it's written get behind me satan amen you can't force me to do miracles you get you can't force me to tempt god and worship idols it is written thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only praise god it's a battle it's a battle especially i remember it now the one i remember most is sister who is so make sure you ask her about that i'm sure eight brother amen did too so john 1 32 and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abode on him look at verse 33 and i knew him not but he that set me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizes with the holy ghost yes all right so let me go back there hallelujah now look we got these three now church now this just caught my this just caught my mind here we're talking about the baptist church right they don't even have this sister they don't even realize there's all kinds of different baptisms because they think when you get saved now you're filled with the holy ghost they don't even realize there's more to it than water amen i don't know you praise god there's more to it than water baptism it's soul baptism amen because the bible says you got three parts body spirit soul god wants to live in your soul and the bible says once he's there he sealed you he's marked you until the day your body is changed amen hallelujah praise god amen that just struck me right there most denominations they don't they stop right right here they can't even get this and even this one too they can't stop cussing they can't stop watching filthy movies or listening to worldly music they can't even get there but thank god look how far you've come amen you bunch of mature saints in here you bunch of meat eaters in here you ain't no babies we're not baby christians amen we're growing up in the things of god we're maturing amen the bible says we're going on to perfection hallelujah amen about just inspiration right here tonight amen that was all inspiration from heaven there you can see right there and the bible says this is the beginning if you can't even get this how are you going to understand the seven seals oh my here we go how do you understand revelation 10 7. if you can't even that's why they can't because they can't even get this how you going to understand well here we're going to get to it eternal that that's that's that's another one right here well let's get to it okay laying on of hands the bible says lay hands suddenly on no man that's for ordaining people you have to realize when somebody gets saved like let's use austin we wouldn't say well the first sunday he was here well let's lay hands on he's going to be a preacher or let's lay on him he's going to be a song leader you don't do that you wait a while and let them work out their own salvation you let them mature the bible said laying hands suddenly on no man that's the one idea but look what happens in other churches right remember you you see that a few years ago with kanye west he got he became a christian what's the next what happened the next sunday he's up there preaching and now look what he's doing i guess he put out his own bible or something like that he put his own name in there that's what happens when you lay hands on people suddenly right yeah yeah it's awful yeah and that's see this is laying on hands that's sim this is one of the simple things supposed to be supposed to be a simple thing now the other one is laying on a hands for healing and here's what i want to say about this this is what i've had to learn i know i say it often but i had to learn before i try to rebuke a devil or command the devil to leave i've got to make sure that person has confessed their sins before i lay my hands on and then rebuke the spirit i've got to make sure they're confessed because the bible says that that when that spirit enters the house that house belongs to the spirit until they repent and then that spirit has to leave then they got a cleaned out house right in other words the person has to want to be free the person has to want to be free from the devil before the devil can go amen so there's two areas with that on the laying on of hands divine healing and ordination now how many churches got that very few very few got that very few most churches like i was watching you know my old pastor not in the message but in denomination they just pray from the pulpit they don't invite anybody up for prayer to lay hands on them but you come up for prayer and the holy spirit came on you remember that burn right in you laying on a hands or something sometimes that's how god uses it laying on of hands i remember when that brother prayed for me and god healed me of my sickness right after service that's been years and years ago i remember that there's something about laying on hands it represents that person represents that's god's representative that's god's servant and now god's servant is blessing you amen hallelujah now next resurrection of the dead now the sadducees didn't believe in a resurrection right that's where they tried to trick jesus well a woman married this man and then the man died and she married her seven brothers which one is she going to be married to in the millennium or the resurrection see they were trying to confuse me he said you don't even understand the power of god he said god is the god of the living amen in other words he's saying when we get over there it ain't going to be about physical marriages our bodies are going to be like angel bodies that's why the mormons are wrong they think they're going to be saved and go to planets and procreate with all kinds of women and have all kinds of babies they don't even know the very beginning of this god's not resurrecting us with physical bodies that have sexual passions god's giving us a new body a perfect body at the off and you had a glorified body amen and what about this the resurrection dead how about this there's two resurrections most people don't know that there's the first resurrection that's the rapture amen that's why you're here tonight you're trying to be a part of the first resurrection and that's what paul said paul said i will do anything to obtain to that resurrection hallelujah i will sacrifice anything to be a part of that first resurrection the rapture hallelujah they're catching away of the bride of jesus christ amen the resurrection unto life hallelujah but there's also a second resurrection only the bride of jesus christ and 144 000 and all the old testament saints live in the millennium right now there's a group that comes up we know they got to populate the earth for satan to deceive someone or most of them but all the others all the foolish virgins they don't live for that thousands they live up in heaven they don't live on the earth for a thousand years but they get raised up or they get raised up here at the last resurrection the second resurrection which is the white throne judgment now how many people know that not many but i got a video on my website about it if you want to watch that there's two kinds of christians and they come out in two resurrections let's be part of the first amen let's strive with all we got lord i want to be in that number amen hallelujah glory thank god is my clapping bothering her is my okay i was gonna say i can stop clapping because sometimes i stop okay and sometimes i try not to clap right by lady's ears that's why i got those headphones there yeah austin you got a question buddy yeah yeah because yeah that's revelation chapter 20 explains it because they didn't overcome everything on earth during their lifetime they were foolish not this time because the millennium brother there's no devil for a thousand years there's no devil yeah because that's where jesus is yeah that's called this yeah it's called the son of david yeah it's called his his time on earth a thousand years as the ruler of the earth not yet no that's that's the future home yeah let's be true uh because they're starting a new covenant it's a brand new covenant it's the called the eternal covenant new heavens new earth uh new city new jerusalem everything's new so it gets a new name good question yeah great coach let's give him two claps relax might as well praise god that's good buddy that's good yep laying on hands resurrected now how about this last one most people don't know that hell is not going to be for eternity what kind of god would send someone and punish one to hell for unending amount of time for only disobeying god for 30 or 40 years 50 years what kind of god would do that you have to suffer eternally just for 20 or 30 years or 40 years of sin what that would be awful is that fair is that a is that a fair sentence if you jaywalked and crossed the street is it fair to have 100 years in prison that's basically what it is right so the bible tells us no murder has eternal life abiding in him amen hallelujah that means in order to be saved in order to live eternally you've got to have the spirit of jesus christ in you amen and all these sinners that die without the spirit of christ they cannot live eternally they may live for thousands or millions we don't know how many years there lived but at some point they will cease to exist they have to be done away with praise god the bible says there will come a time when satan will be no more praise god amen hallelujah he just won't exist anymore he'll be annihilated now i don't know about that because the bible says eternal fire that's a good question but god is a fire so he's called a consuming fire because the bible says eternal fire the bible does say eternal fire but there's no way they can burn eternally because first it's unjust and second because they don't have eternal life exactly and see see brother they're babies then right and i'm not i'm not bad-mouthing them i love them i would help them i'd do anything i could for them i'd send them my books i visited 12 of their churches i'd do anything anything to help them out but most people don't want it they just shut it down because it's a contrary to their their church contrary to their denomination it sounds too crazy well if they read the bible it'd be right if they just read the bible and use a little common sense now church this is elementary christianity 101. so this is like can i say like this it's kindergarten well this is before kindergarten because they talk about milk uh this is preschool yeah still drinking milky i got your i teach first grade mr smith can you open my milk yeah yeah i can open your milk this is baby baby christianity right all right i'm gonna yeah give me 10 minutes i'll try to finish up here i want to be mindful of your your time too amen buddy praise god i just felt you know i was kind of struggling what did i preach and i just kind of felt the holy spirit bring this thought in here so i hope it's to help too my god's grace all right now what we need churches we need hearts that turn back to this doctrine because remember the bible says we'll move on from these if god will permit you to so see god won't permit you to until you what repent and have the right doctrine god's not going to move you on to the seals the church ages gifts of the holy spirit god ain't gonna move you on there for the perfect will of god god's not gonna move you on there he's not gonna permit it until you accept the revelations of these the simple the simple truths of these those six sorry god god has to permit it in other words you have to move past justification amen got to get the sanctification amen hallelujah that's good that's good thank you jesus so remember i read this quote on sunday brother braham says there must be someone rise up it's got to come thus saith the lord malachi 4 it's exactly what he said would be a sign just before the coming of the great and terrible day of the lord i'll send you elijah what would he do turn the hearts of the children back to the doctrine of the fathers now we just read what the doctrine of the children or the early christians were that's the very beginning of christianity those principles and most churches don't even have those so how can they be mature christians they can't be they don't even understand those things i thought of a story i'm not sure if i should say it but uh i'm not sure i'll just i'll skip it i'll come back to it it's just about you turn it not eternal hell it's just a story i heard i'll just i'll save it for later um yeah back to the doctrine of the fathers back to the bible see out of these denominational differences and come back to the bible back to god that's what we must do notice what a great time we're living in now here's what brother is talking about malachi prophesied this i'll send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse okay so in this scripture malachi 4 mentions the spirit of elijah in two separate ministries now this is in my blue book brother austin the big one big one it's the last chapter 13. it's page 700 something 740. these two ministries belong to john the baptist and william branham john prepared the way for the messiah's first coming and brother branham restored the way for jesus second coming i hope we can see that clearer tonight can you see that how brother abraham had to clear those six doctrines up most churches don't even have those six doctrines i i'd go as far as saying this which message churches have all those six doctrines right about laying on hands and you know all those different things there which message churches have those about the different baptisms see most of them just say just come to church believe god sent a prophet and you're baptized with the holy ghost nonsense you got to get sanctified amen you got to get a new heart amen new heart new spirit then my spirit amen they never get a new spirit all right now brother here's here's the two john turned the heart of the fathers to the children and brother brown turned the heart of the children back to the fathers okay that's what the two spirits of elijah did there john the baptist had the spirit of elijah brother bran had the spirit of elijah they prophesied they had miracles of course john the baptist didn't have miracles but elijah did they rebuked immoral women praise god they were men of the wilderness they spoke with thus saith the lord now luke 1 17 says john the baptist fulfilled the first part he shall go before him in the spirit and power of lies to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the lord so john the baptist by elijah's spirit prepared the people for the messiah jesus by preaching repentance all right now next mark claims john did baptize in the wilderness and preach the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins see repenting and obeying god is the definition of a turned heart glory so has brother brahm's message turned to your heart that's the question that's the question tonight brother man's message was to turn your heart which means you repented of your sins and now you're obeying god that's what this ministry is all about amen hallelujah it's about the heart amen that's why when i first listened to brother braham i started crying because i've never heard somebody preach with such a heart as his heart because he loved jesus i never heard a man ever preach like that and so i started weeping but i was chewing tobacco playing tecmo super bowl on my nintendo i'm like trying to get these records and all of a sudden tears start coming down my eyes so i gotta spit out the tobacco and turn off the game what is this i i've never heard this i've been listening to sermons for almost two years good one i mean some good baptist ones too but i never heard a man preach like that that's that's why it's the holy spirit he's supposed to preach with the power of elijah and turn our hearts back to repenting and back to the bible amen that's what romans 6 17 says god be thanked that ye were servants of sin but you obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you and then here's acts 7 39 i love this this shows a disobedient heart is turned back to worldliness so that proves both your hearts are turned towards god because you've left worldliness that proves it because the bible says our fathers would not obey speaking of israel will not obey god but thrust him from them and in their hearts turned back into egypt so god had brought them out of egypt but in their hearts they're like we want to go back glory so as long as your heart is saying tonight i'm not going back i decide to follow jesus i'm not going back to denominationalism i'm not going back to the worldly things i'm not going back to sin i'm following jesus you know your heart is turned amen hallelujah see they turn back well let's go back to egypt let's go back to the drugs let's go back to fornication let's go back to cussing and swearing and murdering let's go back to rap music let's go back to country music whatever you know it doesn't matter what it is let's go back to uh drunkenness let's go back to orgies let's go back to all that no a christian has decided to follow jesus amen they're pressing on they press in the violent christians take the kingdom by force amen spiritually violent which means they snatch it away i'm snatching god's promises i'm going to fulfill god's word that's what the bible said the violent take it by force you snatch it away hallelujah now i want to i got a couple minutes here left on my 10. now my wife and i were talking i just thought i brought i thought i'd bring out this thoughts tonight because i knew it'd be a shorter sermon isaiah says this and a highway shall be there and away and it should be called the way of holiness and the unclean should not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring men though fools shall not air therein the church the way of holiness is jesus how many know that he said i am the way so the bible says there's one way what is that way christ the word he's the way of holiness in hebrew it means you're set apart you were separated on your your uh yeah that's about that's right holy holiness it's the way of being separate from the world amen there it is hallelujah we're preaching the way to live separate from the world that's what our church is all about praise god the way of holiness even a fool or foolish virgin cannot be confused about god's calling for holiness nobody nobody should question this that a real christian should separate themselves from sinful things doesn't the bible say this and church these are new testament everybody say new testament ready these are new testament we are supposed to do what cleanse ourselves from some filthiness oh and this is in every one of their bibles and remember they'll be judged by paul's gospel paul wrote this all those churches will be judged by this you're supposed to get cleaned up from all filthiness amen and brother our voices will be there on that day judging them against them i'm just encouraging i'm not something we enjoy but we'll be there because we believed it amen we preached it praise god we lived it the bible says they're going to raise up the queen of the south they're going to raise up sister naomi they're going to raise up lydia they're going to raise up malachi we need some witnesses who did separate themselves from all fool filthiness and jesus say raise up acacia hallelujah amen hallelujah he needs somebody to be a witness praise god because he won't leave himself without a witness amen hallelujah let it be me let it be you it's new testament and this is the new testament follow peace with all men in holiness without which no man that's what i was saying earlier you can be holy in the last few minutes your life and so go to heaven because you're separate from the world you've decided to reject the world and follow jesus christ that's how merciful god is but for those of us who have decades let's let's let's devote all of our decades let's devote the rest of our lives to living separate from the world and perfecting holiness in the fear of god hallelujah this is good now here it is looking diligently lest any man fail the grace of god people can fail grace people can reject the grace of god by not living a holy life right like judas balaam they had a chance to be saved they had a chance but they failed grace they rejected grace for money or for popularity well actually both were money right balaam was money and uh yeah and then judas was money too they both did it for money that's what brother bam said brother austin uh preachers always get by by three things preachers always fall if they fall money women and popularity and you can see all down through the bible yep money was balaam and judas uh women would have been which preacher oh samson we'd say he's like a leader and then popularity king saul oh no he was saved yeah he was saved saul was saved too i'm just giving you examples of men that fell oh david david fell with a woman but he was saved yeah samson was saved yet yes he repented his last moment so did king saul in one way but it was actually a victory yeah it was actually a suicide but also a victory he had to do that to fulfill god's call for his life god's call for his life was to begin delivering israel from the philistines and they eventually got that victory later on but he's the one that started it that was he that was his brother the whole purpose of him being born was to do that because god knew he's going to be rebellious god knew he's going to be a very lustful man so the first two examples were lost balaam and judas but king saul and samson were saved and david no doubt david was saved yeah see they can fail grace lest any root of bitterness see you gotta watch bitterness right springing up trouble you and thereby you're defiled by being bitter right i'm gonna be bitter against my dad or i'm bitter against my my grandma bitter against the preacher i'm bitter against that that will defile your christian life if somebody hurts you go talk to them get it out of your heart don't let a root of bitterness grab a hold of your life now here's a good quote i want to read brother brahm said this i'll try to close i guess where's my notes okay there we go sorry about that okay this quote uh 1960 you know i've always tried to be this and our lord has always revealed to me there's one extreme and another extreme but right in the middle road lays the truth did you notice isaiah 35 where he said there shall be a highway and you remember how precious nazarene brother used to sing that song you know the highway of holiness highway of holiness now if you'll read your bible right it doesn't say the highway of holiness i just read it to you it doesn't it said there will be a highway and a way and it shall be called not the highway of holiness but the way of holiness and is a conjunction that finishes your sentences see there shall be a highway in a way and it shall be called the way of holiness not a highway of holiness see a road is built a good road is built the highest part is the center because it lets all the trash wash off on both sides that's it when a man really comes to christ he's got his eyes centered on christ but if he's a little bit emotional he'll be a fanatic if he's a little bit cold he'll get on the other side and just be a cucumber now i like cucumbers in the natural but we shouldn't be cucumbers in the spiritual what does the cucumber do just sit there that's all it does just sit there it's waiting for you to oh eat it you know cut it and eat it you just sit in there so some people just sit there in church like this the whole time now i seem like this for austin now when i go to places they're like they're chewing i'm like how can that be so delicious like what why can't you just like say amen to the word they're like brother brooks one time he's like i was doing that he's like hey can i have a bite of that that looks pretty good i started laughing because i had a bad habit of chewing my chewing my nails my hang nails and everything like that but see they sit there like a cucumber but you can't do that and get anything from god you got to get into the service you got to raise your hands like i like how you guys clap like that you know like i like how you clap like because you're getting into the spirit right pretty soon you start feeling good and never start marching around everybody's feeling good hallelujah glory we're just feeling good amen you got to get into the holy spirit praise god that's called crucifying the flesh and getting in the holy spirit he said but see until they get intellectual they just sit there but the other side is i got to have a motion if i don't have any it's all emotion if i don't feel something god's not there but the truth is right down the middle you don't have to have all kinds of emotion you have to sit there and think about it all the time you got to have a balance hallelujah because we've seen many people shout scream dance speak in tongues or whatever and others growing up i've seen all the time but then leave and they go live in sin or get divorced or commit adultery or go cross-dress right or cut their hair we've i've seen it all i've seen it all praise god i think most of it so that's the emotional side but i've also seen the other side people get so cold on god pretty soon they fall away too but you gotta have right down the middle i love this what he says he said but the main thing is right in the middle of the road with enough spirit in you keeps you warm and moving amen and knowing enough to keep yourself under see knowing enough see enough understanding to keep yourself in obedience to the holy spirit to move just as the spirit moves not till or not after just as the spirit moves amen so that's why church i put this up there right we're and if we're baptized with the holy ghost i'm gonna show them if we're if we're baptized with the holy ghost or on our way to it you're on this road brother austin and lena you're on this road the foolish burden's out here in the grass they're not they're not drowning but the make the make believers are out here they're drowning and the sinners they're drowning they're lost but church we are progressing on the road brother ramsay you can start on this and then fall off in the status perfect man i don't want to fall off the road i want to stay right in the middle by god's grace right so see but even now but austin and lena even with people that are born again sometimes they're they're too emotional and they don't have enough doctrine like they're just looking for like a just somebody get excited and tell me that god's gonna answer my prayer but what if it's not time or what if it's not god's will they don't even think about that they just want a motion and yet they can be baptized with the holy ghost but they're just not in the middle of the road and on the other side you have people that are so smart or think they're so smart that they reject all the holy spirit anointing and they don't want to feel nothing they just want to think about it and try to figure everything out you can't always figure everything out right brother ram calls that you're crossing bridges before you get there trying to see how god's going to do it and god will do it exactly opposite of how you think he's going to do it just to prove that you don't know everything right i don't know everything to do it totally different than he did before just to show you you don't know so you got to be what balance right in the middle you got to have the feelings you got to have some emotion right and then you got to be you got to use your wisdom too what does the lord taught me what's the scripture say lord open my mind help me to understand this it could be right down the middle now i believe our church does a good job of that now you've heard it too because we've had some emotional prayers that was beautiful a few weeks ago wasn't that that was glorious uh same thing happened when huda got the holy ghost and different times we prayed for lydia we prayed for different ones and i've needed it too you know i love that because that shows we can be emotional at times and just and then use our understanding and just stay right down the middle of the road we got both we're not always shouting screaming too much and we're not using the word right well i guess yeah too intellectual but we use both the word and we wait for the we we wait for the emotion to come with the word amen that's right amen so we stay right down the middle of the road because anybody can have a motion anybody can have intellectualism think they're smart but the holy ghost is both it's a balance of both now you can stop the live stream so i just want to show a few things i'm going to preach longer on this on sunday so love you live streamers god bless you and keep keep sending those testimonies in
