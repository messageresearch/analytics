TRANSCRIPT
========================================
verses five and six God bless our live streamers we're to look at proving all things uh part 19 tonight going to focus on uh a statement brother random makes he makes a statement and says uh the Elijah for today is the Lord Jesus Christ and many people misunderstand this it seems uh people actually on both sides of the of the message whether you're uh whether people uh uh uh press play and Obey or whether people are against the message of brother Bram people on both sides misinterpret this quote from my perspective and opinion so I'm going to preach uh on this tonight and give us a good balance hopefully uh by the grace of God and then if we have time we'll look at uh avoiding uh Vain babblings and foolish questions uh by God's grace so Malachi 45 and 6 of course we know this is a scripture we believe uh God used brother Ram to fulfill the second part of verse six to turn the heart of the children to the fathers because we know John the Baptist turned the hearts of the fathers to the children what fathers it had to been the uh the original uh we'd say the apostolic Saints right that were alive uh right at time of Jesus's death burial and Resurrection the fathers of the faith we'd call them U the early Apostles the book of Acts Church John the Baptist pointed everybody right he pointed them to Christ Hallelujah and that in turn as he pointed them toist Christ and then their hearts were turned to the second coming of Jesus and that's what the children represents uh the the generation that would see his return to the Earth right John the Baptist turned the hearts of the fathers to the children uh and so the Bible never the Bible never uh Records anyone fulfilling that second part Bible never records anyone uh turning the heart of the children to the father so we have to look at other scriptures to see how this is fulfilled and of course it's fulfilled in uh Matthew 17:11 and Revelation 10:7 and other verses Luke 17:30 verses we're familiar with uh but let's read this here and we'll have you be seated by God's grace Malachi 45 and6 I'll read verse 5 then you can read verse six with me verse 5 says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord let's read verse 6 1 2 3 and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers I come and smite the Earth amen let's have one more word of prayer if we can here by God's grace father God we thank you again for today we thank you for Calvary Mercy there was great and Grace was free pardon there was multiplied to me Lord so thank you Lord that your pardon was multiplied to us Lord God we love what Romans uh 4 says Lord David describes the blessedness of this man to whom the Lord will not impute sin Hallelujah he will not remember his sins and iniquities oh God let that be us Lord God that we would be so blessed you would not remember our sins and our iniquities Lord because of the blood of Jesus Christ because of faith alone in the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah we love the scripture we love Ephesians 2 8-10 Lord God saved by grace through faith it is not of works but the gift of God hallelujah that no man should boast Lord God so we thank you for tonight Lord just guide me anoint me here Lord God For Your Glory bless the life live streamers and those present here and those might listen on the archive in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen amen God bless you as you're being seated there praise God so you know it was just interesting this morning after I prayed and I was studying that this thought just kind of came to me I got an email and it mentioned this quote and as I just I just meditated on for a few moments and it's one of those moment moment where I just felt the Holy Ghost just opened it up to me I just you know sometimes I I I have all these plans I'm going to do this video that topic or I'm going to study that and then all of a sudden God will just put one in there I wasn't even planning on and it seems like it just opened up to me and so um that's what happened today I was going to study on another topic but then uh this thought came to me and it just seemed like it started opening up to me so I just try to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit I can tell when God's opening up something because I didn't expect it right you you know you look for the if the Holy Spirit surprises you then you say praise the Lord you know if he's going to bring you a fresh Revelation you want to thank God for that Hallelujah now uh if we could you know we'll just briefly look at this here U notice it's the spirit of Elijah on a prophet we know the spirit of Elijah was on John the Baptist according to Luke 1:17 the Bible says that and John fulfilled the first part fathers to the children but notice God never came and smoke the Earth with a curse yet mhm right still blessed look out look at all the rain we got this week our Earth is blessed it hasn't been cursed and so uh uh so God had to send Elijah again to turn the hearts of the children the Believers of the second coming of Christ back to their fathers and so that means uh their hearts will be turned turned back to Paul's gospel praise God that's what's happened in this day that's what brother Ram came to do brother Ram said my absolute is the word of God uh he said God's absolute is the word of God hallelujah so if God has and brother man said God only has one absolute there's not two absolutes there's only one absolute praise God and so we recognize that and uh brother Ram said his message came to restore our hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers in other words the book of Acts teaching and Paul's letters and Peter's letters James letters all the New Testament Letters by the grace of God and how many can say Amen they believe brother am did that amen amen without a doubt I have no doubts in my mind at all by God's grace that's what studying does that's what waiting on God does it dissolves all your doubts amen you study you pray you wait on God God gives you Revelation it dissolves all the doubts Allelujah I have no doubts about water baptism or the godhead or serpent seed I have no doubts about that Hallelujah God has dissolved my doubts amen I don't understand everything I don't have every answer but I know the Revelation is Right Hallelujah and so and so the uh the the point of this uh video I made today and of course this the study was on this quote brother makes it's uh November 27th 65 trying to do God a service without being his will and brother man makes a statement he said but the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ he's come according to and then he says Luke 17:30 right in the days of the son of man says the son of man is to reveal himself among his people not a man God and brother screams it out God he says but it'll come through a prophet now that's just a very small section now like I said people on both sides of the message remember we're trying to say right down the middle of the road we're trying to stay right with the word of God right you know there's two sides right uh people worship Brother brandom people revile brother brandom but we know brother BR was a true prophet of God Amen right and so the people that worship brother Braham they'll say look uh and there was people that admit this and they got an on tape that have now passed on Friends of brother brandom said that brother brand was God that's heresy right uh if I can think of a name I might call it because he already passed away I don't know if I can call it it'll come to me I'll just have to wait on that but be and this is the quote they would use these worshippers of Brother brandom The Press Play obey people the no preacher people this is the quote they would use they say the Elijah this day is the Lord Jesus Christ and they would try to say brother Ram was God that's absolute heresy that could be blasphemy that'll be up to God to decide that right and so uh they take the quote the wrong side now the other side the people that revile brother bandam or uh attack brother brandham they'll they'll say see brother bram's trying to say he is a lord Jesus Christ he can't be trusted he's a false prophet that's wrong they they've misinterpreted the quote so like I said I didn't even plan on studying this today that's why I feel like it's God okay um so you might be saying well brother Jess uh you better tell us what this means I said that's what I'm going to do by God's grace but to understand this you know you have to go two paragraphs above this statement see people can take one snippet of a statement and make make it say whatever they want and put they Peter said that's what they did to Paul they would twist his scriptures the word is actually rest wre s t in second Peter chapter 3 they would rest they would twist the scripture and make it say something it doesn't say brother man's not saying he's the Lord Jesus Christ brother is saying the spirit of Elijah is the holy spirit that's what he said it's that simple right right the spirit of Elijah can't be some other Spirit like a spirit of a man that wouldn't help anybody right it can't it's not the spirit of the devil we know that that'd be blasphemy the spirit of Elijah is just the spirit of God with certain attributes for certain Ministries that's right and if you know your Bible real well you'll know there's only one Spirit but there's different uh there's different uh attributes of the same Holy Spirit remember uh Psalm chapter 1 there's rivers of one water brother said that means there's different channels of the same spirit and then he names the nine gifts of the Spirit he said preaching is a different Channel than Divine Healing it's a little different River it's a little different Brook Hallelujah brother it took it took him time to transition from teaching to praying for the sick because it's a different anointing he said and that example is from the uh the sermon the message of Grace so if you haven't listened to that you need to listen to that and let me just say something here you know our church most of us weren't raised in the message so we and I've told this to people too I think I even said it publicly I said we've got to build listening brother Brandon more into our lives because we weren't raised that way whereas other people that were raised that way they're too much on tapes and they got to build more Bible reading into their lives the church said right so you have to build listening to brother brandom into your life if not you're just you're going to miss out on so much right you might be confused on quotes like this right so you have to have the healthy balance now people might even attack me for that statement but then how do you justify how many tapes does it tape to be a good tape follower a good Christian a good message believer how many justifies me when am I justified by listening to enough tapes and then we could say well uh well you're not justified unless you do so many chapters a day see so you got to have the right balance of the Holy Spirit praise God right right but we know if we W raise the message we've got to make an active uh effort to listen to more of the tapes than we would right by God's grace we have to make a active uh effort in that I hope you understand what I'm saying by God's grace amen now there's four reasons that this quote is misunderstood the first is the context brother Rand is talking about the spirit of Elijah is the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ that's what he's talking about if you know your Bibles remember there's one Spirit but there's nine gifts and then remember at the Throne of God in the seventh Dimension there's seven spirits around the throne and then there's four Cher rooms brother said those four cherom are four anointings for the church is that something you have seven fires that represent the Holy Ghost to every Church age but then you have four anointings that cover those Church ages and give them certain attributes right but how many spirits are there there's only one Holy Spirit amen but there's a holy spirit that will anoint you for a certain age Hallelujah a certain life a certain type of testimony like Elijah right right brother uses brother tells us the Bible says the spirit of Elijah used five times right Elijah Elisha uh John the Baptist the seven Church age messenger or the Malachi 46 turning the hearts of the children back to the fathers and then Moses and Elijah in Revelation 11 yeah it's not five different Spirits it's the same Spirit praise God amen and if you've never done that study you need to I got a video on it brother brandom had so many qualities just like Elijah man of the Wilderness spoke with thus sayith the Lord he rebuked those famous women those Jezebels Hallelujah and then when the anointing left he he was a man too he could fall short of God's glory he could question God there's five or six attributes I can I can name four right there right like that he was just like Elijah Hallelujah so we're thankful for that now if you go to paragraphs from this brother starts off with Amos 37 what is Amos 37 God surely God will do nothing except he reveals a secret to his servants theet prophets so in the context brother is talking about God sending a spirit to anoint the prophets he's not saying the prophets are God he's saying God is anointing the prophets amen and then he names Malachi 45 and 6 turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers one paragraph above this he says in the last day the spirit of Elijah is to come too it must come five times God uses that Spirit okay so he's talking he's clearly talking about God using the spirit of Elijah to anoint five different men okay then brother said that Spirit wasn't Elijah that was God's spirit on Elijah that's right any honest person would admit well I was talking about how prophets have to have the anointing of the Holy Ghost or else they can't be a prophet amen and see and there that's why people are guilty of slandering brother random if they're making him say something he's not saying right I know he's from Kentucky I know he wasn't well educated but you still got to do deal do your due diligence and look at the context of what he's saying praise God amen amen hallelujah amen and then he says see it was Elijah was just a man we've had Elijah and Elijah's coats and Elijah's mantel and Elijah's everything he said then but then but but then he says but the Elijah of this day is the Lord Jesus Christ he's to come according to Luke 1730 the son of man is to reveal himself among his people now remember he had to Jesus had to come as son of man and brother Braham because Jesus had never come to the Gentiles yet with that Messiah sign with the discernment gift he only did it to the Jews in John chapter 1 and the Samaritans in John chapter 4 you're getting a good Bible teaching tonight amen HJ this is the Holy Spirit by got it's the Revelation for this day praise God it's not a denominational Revelation you won't find it in these men's books you'll find it preached by the prophet of God hallelujah am with thus sayith the Lord hallelujah yeah amen that's right remember said in the anointed ones the end time he said Malachi 4:5 and6 is on the Earth right now thus sayith the Lord but said search every newspaper search he said look at the ministry of Elijah on the Earth today with science Miracles and wonders thus sayith the lord it's on the Earth right now Church we've been given the message of the hour praise God we got the right baptism like we said the godhead we got all the Mysteries finished hallelujah praise God we've been given a blessing from the Lord the word of God has been restored hallelujah oh makes me happy to know I'm a part of that to know that God would choose me to open my blinded eyes to see it by the grace of God and choose you hallelujah amen blessed are your eyes for they see blessed are your ears for they hear hallelujah amen then he says he says not a man God so brother's looking at Luke 17:30 says not a man it's not a man that's going to do this son of man it's God in the man that's right just like God anointing Elijah amen amen just like God anointing Elisha or John the Baptist amen or Moses and Elijah it's God anointing the man he said but it'll come through a prophet it's God coming through a prophet amen why can't they see that praise God and they always cut off that last part but it'll come through a prophet I'm talking about the people that attack they attack brother Bram they always cut off that part see it's God coming through a prophet that's how God always came so started at Moses right the people said we don't want to hear from God God said fine I'll give you a prophet I'll speak through Moses amen and God has done that ever since yeah that's why God sent brother brandom Hallelujah to speak to us and remember oh if you haven't read this let's read 2 Chronicles 36 haven't read this for a while this is a great blessing boy when I found this I was so happy 2 Chronicles 36 maybe Malachi have you read this buddy cuz nice to hear some other voices here uh 36 I believe it's 15 and 16 if I'm not mistaken yeah can you read 15 and 16 and the Lord God of their fathers sent them sent to them by his Messengers rising up in times and sending because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place but they mocked The Messengers of God and despised his words and misused His prophets until the Wrath of the Lord arose against his people so there was no remedy and the church said why did God send brother brandom he wouldn't have compassion on us I'm sure my wife and I would say it was God's compassion to show us not to wear makeup that was God's compassion yes on my wife it was God's compassion to show me to cut off my long hair that's God's compassion so I don't look like a woman amen hallelujah that was God's compassion to call me out of denominational churches or mega churches that you know would allow you to basically get drunk that was God compassion amen amen amen is everybody with me tonight that's God's compassion to give you the word of God so you can really really live a holy Sanctified Life church amen that's God's compassion to us amen but they don't want it if they reject brother they don't want the compassion of God shame on them hallelujah amen they're rejecting the word hallelujah right and what do they do and and and this is the people not everybody but but look at these people if they mock The Messengers if they despise the word of God that The Messengers saying they misus the prophets and here's a exact this is the topic is that's the example they misus brother Ram's words he wasn't calling himself the Lord Jesus Christ he was saying the Lord Jesus Christ has to anoint this man who's got the spirit of Elijah Hallelujah the spirit of Elijah is equal to the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit is equal to the Lord Jesus Christ it's the Lord Jesus Christ in spirit form hallelujah amen hallelujah Glory I'm feeling religious tonight hallelujah praise God he said it'll come through a prophet now he skips down I'm skipping down a few a few lines here he said God has to get one man under his control so he's talking about God controlling prophets see there's one God there was father son Holy Ghost but one God over it all notice so he was with Elijah the spirit of Elijah he used that Spirit but the same God controlling it all the time to fulfill his word amen so see friends anyone who's honest and look at look at looks at the context they know brother raham is not exalting himself and on the video I have a whole section how brother always humbled himself let me just read them now some of them are familiar you've heard me preach them over the last few weeks brother said in the seventh seal we want to be gems in the crown of Jesus Christ we don't want to never put a man in it you forget anything about me I'm your brother a sinner saved by grace not fit to live that's exactly the truth I ain't saying that to be humble that's facts there's nothing in me not one sound thing at all and the church said amen but said I'm not saying that to be humble that's facts that's right what's he talking about his sin nature amen but then the Bible said his soul never Sinn that in the first place amen right but he's he's looking at he's he's saying don't give any credit to the opening of these seals don't give any credit to me he said put this grace on Jesus Christ amen he says that later in this sermon the seven seal amen he said don't put this credit on me it wasn't me remember he said even at the opening of the first seal he said I would have made an awful mistake this morning if it wasn't for about 12:00 when the Holy Spirit came in the room and corrected me on something I was fixing to say that was wrong amen amen that's right he said I was going to take my text from a previous time I preached the seals and I was going to call the white horse rider the Holy Spirit but then the Holy Spirit came and said it's not me it's the Antichrist spirit amen that's right he said is that deceiver the white horse rider is the deceiver Hallelujah that innocent looking deceiver it's the Antichrist Spirit and the Holy Ghost corrected him that's what I love about God if we love God if we're seeking God God will correct us hallelujah amen what other preacher or even today says that you forget anything about me they're like you better give me your tithes and offerings that's what they're saying today you better build my kingdom and we're World Changers and we're going to yeah while women are bobbing their hair and it's a shame it's a repulse right wearing makeup and sexy clothes in the churches and we're going to be World Changers not for the Holy Ghost not for the fullness of the Holy Ghost right I hope some people get saved in there but Jesus said few there be that find it the narrow road where they actually love the word of God they love Jesus Christ Hallelujah I love this one if you hav this one for a while you'll you'll rejoice the anointed ones of the end time brother man said he said uh I have no more to do with it than nothing no more than just a voice and my voice even against my better judgment I wanted to be a Trapper but it's the will of my father that I declare to do and determine to do speaking of the message I wasn't the one that appeared down at the river now girls we didn't have a chance to go down to the river by Spring Street okay but that's where I baptized Jose you've been there brother yeah that's what he's talking about it wasn't me that appeared there it was the pillar of fire that appeared there I was only standing there when he appeared I'm not the one that performs these things and foretells these things that happens as perfect as they are brother man told that woman Marilyn Hickey he said if you believe you'll have a child thus sayith the Lord she had to wait 10 years but she received it Hallelujah brother said these women will continue to strip themselves that's thus sayith the Lord and hasn't it happened that's a man who knew what he was talking about that's a man who'd been in the presence of somebody greater than just a denominational president or CEO or something like that that's a man who' been the presence of Jesus Hallelujah that's a man that seen Jesus Hallelujah by a uh by Vision Hallelujah that's right see that's what he says perfectly he said I'm only the one that's near when he does it but said he's the one doing everything I'm just standing there when he does it hallelujah amen I was only a voice that he used to say it it wasn't what I knew it's just what I surrendered myself to and he spoke through me that's right amen it isn't mean it wasn't the seven Angel no no see see he recognized he's the seventh angel this quote it's a good quote Oh no it was the manifestation or the appearing of the son of man the appearing of Jesus Christ in the form of a prophet that's right it wasn't the angel it was his message it was the mystery that God unfolded it's not a man it's God the angel was not the son of man he was the messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he's the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man amen hallelujah praise godes that's why I told the Saints in Kentucky you got to hear the voice behind the voice of brother Ram that's right cuz brother said my voice my words can fail he said but when God speaks through me that's not me talking that's God talking amen same thing is true when when I finally yield to myself right when when I can finally yield to the Holy Spirit then God can speak something right to you praise God that you need to hear the same same thing with any preacher this is always the way the fivefold ministry has been when they can yield to the Holy Ghost it now it becomes God voice that's right because revelation 22 says the spirit and the bride say come and brother said the spirit and the bride and the prophet will all be saying the same thing and what they are saying has already been said in the word of God Amen Hallelujah praise God Amen that's a church age Book quote if you don't know that one amen time to get in the church age book if you haven't read that one for a while they'll all be saying the same thing and what's already said is in the word of God Amen in other words the bride will stay with the word of God because she's led by the holy spirit amen but says she has to because she's got the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost wrote the word amen and the Holy Ghost is not going to say something outside the word of God hallelujah oh hallelujah thank you Jesus brother said if you haven't fed fully on every word to give yourself strength to Fly Above All these denominations and things of the world will you at this time do it while we pray I love it amen see I came out of denomination that's why I love it amen cuz I have done that I'm not feeding on denominational food I'm feeding on the body word of the son of man I'm feeding on the Holy Ghost word for this hour hallelujah amen hallelujah look what these other words of these other brothers would do all these brothers that are falling all these preachers that are falling away in sin look what their word it's eating like a canker because they rejected the true word of God Amen now remember you know this church the word of God can never go stale right but see their messages stay when they preach tongues as AB holy ghost first that's wrong and plus that's the different word for a different day right tongues was never the evidence of the Holy Ghost but they did speak in tongues the day of Pentecost but see they on a false Doctrine like that because they rejected the furthering of the word the further restoration of the word of God everybody knows Martin Luther started restoring the church well that means it's got to keep being restored praise God how can they deny a restoration they'd have to deny Martin Luther but we don't deny Martin Luther we accept Martin Luther's justification but then we add Wesley sanctification and then we add the gifts of the Holy Ghost and now we add rapturing Faith hallelujah amen and the finished mystery of God amen amen that brother R brought us by the grace of God Amen Hallelujah so let's feed on every word of God so we can Fly Above All these things of the world Amen that's all it takes church if you need strength to overcome the things of the world just Feast on the word of God you'll fly you'll have all the strength to fly above it as an ego praise God Amen that's exactly right brother ramam said brother if there's one thing that I have to do Jesus Christ died in Vain by Grace I'm saved and not by my self but by the will of God and by the goodness and mercy of God Amen see look how he humbled himself he's not saying well I'm Sav because I'm the seventh angel right I'm saved because I I'm the I'm a son of man no if I have to do anything then Jesus died in vain in other words Jesus Paid It all all to him I owe s and left the Crimson Stain and Jesus washed my stains white as snow amen all do is repent believe amen amen all I had to do is accept the sacrifice and recognize I'm a sinner I need a savior and bring that sacrifice and accept that Sacrifice by God's grace I already say the sacrifice was brought for me amen I just had to come and accept the sacrifice Hallelujah and few there be that find it Hallelujah brother says in God hiding himself in Simplicity Albuquerque 63 say aren't you afraid of failing brother R said I'm always a failure oh I'm always a failure see he was he wasn't calling himself the Lord Jesus Christ but he never does amen because I don't speak my words I speak his that's the reason they're always right speaking of prophecies and discernment prayer lines he said I'm always a failure but when when I'm under the anointing I always speak what God says that's why it's right amen hallelujah that's why when he told sister uh Florence Humes I met her in 2009 or 10 before she passed in 2015 but that's why brother said you got tuberculosis go weigh yourself the next two Mondays and you'll gain a pound each Monday and then you'll know you're going to be healed he said I condemn Satan in Jesus Christ's name amen and she did that she went wait herself the next Monday gain one pound next Monday she had five more kids after that and has all all these great grandchildren how could brother R know that because he's the prophet of God God showed him what was going to happen and God gave her instructions on what to do and it came to pass amen amen I met her it's on tap no how can you deny that praise God see brother I would fail if it was my own idea but that wasn't my own idea that was God's idea hallelujah praise God Amen just like God like just like God's told Brother R he says those denominations will never break up and come back to the word he said thus sayith the Lord they'll never break up and come back to the word he said thus sayith the Lord they'll go in with the Antichrist and take the mark of the beast thus sayith the Lord amen and all these denominations keep falling deeper and deeper into sin continual deg de radation and Corruption into sin somebody tell me that's not right that's right because it was spoken from God's mind brother said it and God's word cannot fail Hallelujah that's right show me a denomination that broke up and came back to this word the Lord Jesus Christ and one person the godhead and the Seven Seals and the Seven Church AES show me one denomination they have it they can't because they're Daughters of the mother Hallelujah that's right the only way they could is break up and no longer be denomination then they be free like us flying around here eating on on the body word of the son of man brother the way we come down we Roost we eat all that good food and we go fly out the rest of the week well we come back Wednesday for another feet and two you know Hallelujah that's what we do we fly above the things of the world for a couple days come back down and feast on some fresh meat hallelujah amen it's God giving you his word so his word can never fail in your life Hallelujah so you can be an overcomer in this hour Amen brother Ram is praying he prays to God for mercy and then he says Satan I'm against you because you're an enemy of the Lord You're an enemy of his word and I charge thee by Jesus Christ the son of God as a mortal being look he doesn't say I'm the Lord Jesus Christ knowing that I have no power within myself I said I haven't power to stop you Satan he says but I do have the authority of God's word as a servant that's right he never says I'm the Lord Jesus Christ that's right to preach it and Duty bound to that Authority he said neither does a policeman have the power to stop a car but he's got the authority chch remember you don't have power but you have authority Hallelujah you have the name of Jesus Christ that's why that song says breathe that holy name in prayer and the demons will move back Hallelujah resist Satan and he will flee that's right it's because of your Authority not because of your power that's right is that right amen oh it's beautiful this is the humility of our prophet and I put on that video today I've never seen him exalt himself Moses did we can admit that Moses did he said why won bu you rebels why always got to get water for you and he smoked the Rock God said because you exalted yourself you won't go to the promised land yet amen but about 1500 years later he got there hallelujah amen he got there by Vision by theophany hallelujah look how rich and mercy God Is To His prophets amen Moses had a lot of weight on his shoulders they had a lot of pressure Hallelujah he went through a lot of tough times but God eventually brought him to the promised land oh glory amen I love it here's what brother says about denomination I might as to read this from the indictment brother Ram said today men walk ignorantly see they're ignorant of Acts 238 they're just ignorant of it they're ignorant of Hebrews 1:3 where Jesus is the express image of his person yeah the exact reproduction of his person not a second person he's the image of the person there's only one person in the godhead amen they're ignorant of these things they're ignorant like I told lady online uh they're ignorant of Genesis 3:15 God said God said uh I'll put hatred between you and the woman between thy seed The Serpent and her seed they're ignorant of that that God's the one who sted the serpent seed serpent Offspring that's what serpent seed seed is Offspring serpent Offspring right and as I I showed you on Sunday Adam called Eve mother of all living even before Genesis 4:1 she was already a mom right she was already mou people are ignorant of these things yeah those just say oh we don't need that that's just your own understanding no it's right there in black and white amen hallelujah praise God Amen we're not the ignorant ones they're the ignorant ones amen because they're ignorant of the word of God hallelujah said they don't know that's the truth they think it's some kind of a ISM don't they yeah look what look what brother says they don't dig down deep enough to get into the spirit of Revelation see they don't pray enough they don't read their Bibles enough they don't get in God's presence enough they would complain sister Z if I preach a two-hour sermon and you'll say Amen the whole time amen they complain and say why is this preacher going so long I got to get to my brunch or I got to get to my football game or my basketball game this preacher needs to shut up I need to leave or something like that they complain but we rejoice in it amen we get lost in Heavenly places in two hours goes like that amen hallelujah because why we're under the spirit of Revelation praise God God's unveiling something that's what Revelation means unveiling God's unveiling something to us while the preacher's preaching and we get lost we get caught up in Heavenly places we get caught up in the spirit of Revelation so it seems like time just stand still oh God help us again that fear Hallelujah so time can just stand still and then God give us Grace to sleep in the next day and get some rest brother man said they don't pray enough they don't call upon God enough these denominations right that reject the word of God I'm talking Independence too any independent that uh ties up with the Roman Catholic Church on that let me say this did you see Trump Cho Trump chose his VP guess what he's a Catholic he just turned to a Catholic in 2016 guess how many of the Supreme Court Justices are Catholic six out of nine there's a lot of people going Catholic y isn't that what the Bible says though all the children got to go back to the mother is that something now I don't know if Trump's going to win or not who knows what they got lined up after uh the debacco from last week and the wickedness of last week who knows what they got uh in the mix but church we can pray hallelujah amen we can pray we don't want to see anybody hurt we don't want to see anybody uh threatened and violence toward anybody so we have to pray by God's grace maybe we'll do that at the end here but notice that another Catholic pick and that that that that pick he used to be Evangelical okay but that didn't s satisfy him that's according to Wikipedia now I didn't do a whole lot of research I just read Wikipedia you know not the most trustworthy Source but it had citations at the bottom so I can get checked if I'm wrong I I'll accept rection but see being a part of a weak evangelical church and then converting to Catholic say oh oh this is it and brother guess who his Saint was that he wanted to uh be conformed to St Augustine of Hippo isn't that that ought to ring a bell if you listen to Seven Seals yeah what did Augustine a hippo do brother man told us and I even put it in the book it's in history he's the one that said it's okay to kill people if they won't convert to Catholicism he was the one that gave them permission to start killing people Protestants if they wouldn't convert right right because he said it's better to bring them into the kingdom by death than to have them be lost that's a lie right and that's the saint that this man chose to model after so I I don't know if they're ignorant of it I don't know I'm just letting you know it's another Catholic Choice all right H now go to Proverbs 2:3 how I do it on time okay I'm at 34 minutes okay pretty good Proverbs chap 2:3 now this just for us church and this is what like we said this is probably what brother Simon's doing right now I'm I'm not going to put the rest of the details on the YouTube but Proverbs 2:3 yay if Thou criest after knowledge you got to cry you can't just say God I'd like to know God could you tell me you got to be sincere you got to really want to know something amen that's what I did with ministers marriage requirements I cried I laid on my face and asked God and then God gave me that Revelation and not one preacher ever been able to come to try to correct me on that not one brother not one CU I laid there and cried and prayed about it say God open it up to me God open it up to me I wrote that uh same thing when I wrote that modesty book in the 12 same thing I laid on my face Waiting for God fact we just got to order yesterday a brother out in Missouri wants to order 30 my books on the uh modesty and hand them out to people he said you're doing a great work brother I said not really you're going to do the great work by passing them out in other words we all do a part together by God's grace amen but see you got to really cry after you want to understand the seals or you want to understand that's what I did that's what I do when I study I say God I need to know I need to understand this now like well it' be nice if I knew something it'd be nice if I understood this dream it'd be nice if I had an experience with God you have to cry out for it amen hallelujah and you must lift up your voice for understanding you can't say well God you know I really be nice if I knew who to marry really be nice if I knew what job to take God you got to lift your voice God show me I don't want to miss it Hallelujah I need it Hallelujah remember job said I esteem God's word more than my necessary food so in other words that means he was seeking God rather than eating he was fasting is that right Church verse four if thou seekest her of silver and searches for her as hid Treasures see you got to really look in the Bible you got to search the scriptures then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord and find the knowledge of God that's how serpent seed I I have I have nine evidences right now brother nine and nobody can even deny one of them I've never seen anybody prove one wrong and I'm being honest nobody ever has they can't because it's the Bible Hallelujah am I had to search for those like I was searching for silver now I got some help I found preachers over the years kind of give me all like some some points to it and then I've got to go find the scriptures they say it but I got to go find the scriptures I got to dig a little bit Yeah verse six for the lord giveth wisdom out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding amen see friends this is why people mock The Messengers they despise The Messengers they misuse the prophets because they don't get they don't understand this is God's compassion that a prophet would point us back to the Bible amen they want to have women preachers right they want to have women in sexy clothes they want to watch filthy dirty movies that's what they want and I said it before but they're lovers of Pleasures more than lovers of God if you love God then you then you love listening to a sermon more than you white I'm sorry before more than you like watching Netflix I'm just going to say that Hallelujah right if you love God you'd rather read your Bible then watch Netflix or scroll on Tik Tok if you love God then you love the things of God hallelujah the word of God hallelujah amen people try to tell me they love God and then then they confess well I stayed up all night watching YouTube or I stayed up all night watching movies shame on you that you don't love God enough amen you love the pleasures of this world more than you love the word of God hallelujah don't tell me you love God when you don't act like it you got to act like it you gotta you gotta you got to crucify the lust of the flesh amen amen there's no temptation that's been given to us except what's common to man amen we've all been tempted to watch the wrong things or say the wrong things or do the wrong things and each time we got to crucify the lust of the flesh we have to cast out anything that exalts itself against the word of God we must let the Holy Spirit transform our minds Hallelujah am we must be washed in the waters of the word hallelujah that's where you'll find God Amen when you cry after knowledge you lift up your voice for understanding hallelujah how am I doing all time I'm just going to I'm probably not going to go to the avoid babblings I'm not I'm probably not going to get to that so see the first mistake they make they missed the context brother is never saying I'm the Lord Jesus Christ it's the spirit of Elijah is the holy spirit which is the spirit of the Lord Jesus Christ anybody can see that see brother he told us he said did you know this in birth brother said he's talking about he's talking about U Jacob and Esau how how they were I'm sorry no it was Isaac and ishmail he's talking about Isaac and ishma how Isaac is the son of the promise and ishma is the son of the flesh brother trying to explain how that even applies today we must believe the promise of the word not denominational uh ishmael's and brother stop brother William you've heard this and he said my he said uh he said I wish there were some men he said that these men are going to come and make more sense of this and bring this to life remember that quote brother says in the birth pains he said I wish I had the education to do it he said but God is going to send men that can bring this word to life Hallelujah in other words but was doing his best with his Kentucky English and everything like that but God knew there' be time there'd be another generation Glory we're at 59 years of preachers making more sense of this in other words for us it's more clear than it's ever been Hallelujah right amen thank God for the computers we can search and find more information more scriptures more quotes and just line it up so it's even more clear now than it's ever been for any age hallelujah amen it's more clear hallelujah amen like they say I can't unsee the serpent seat I can't unsee there's one God I can't unsee the Lord Jesus Christ that's all I see CU that's what the word says amen I can't unsee there's only male preachers in the Bible I can't unsee that Hallelujah where there's seven Church where the Bible said there's ages of the past in Colossians 1 ages of the future Ephesians well if there's past ages and and future ages there must always be ages hallelujah amen we're in ages right now that's right I can't unsee the Bible I can't unsee a revelation that God has revealed to me Hallelujah I'm glad it's that way too that's what Jesus said when you get a revelation from the Father the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us hallelujah amen that's what hell is trying to do hell is trying to prevail against us and bring us into sin but God won't let hell bring us into sin God will raise us up into Purity Holiness righteousness without which no man shall see the father hallelujah holy living amen Sanctified separated living un God uh oh yeah we had a friend this week Mali was there we had a friend this week say we don't even he said I don't even know what the purpose of God for being here is it's just to enjoy life in my mind I'm like ask me I'm like ask me ask me ask me ask me the Bible said your purpose is to live holy that's what the Bible says a holy calling let me look it up here I was like I know it's in Ephesians here I read it a few months ago I was like glory to God that's right that's my purpose I'm sorry it was 2 Timothy 1:9 I would have got the I would have got the verse wrong but I got the right words second Timothy 1:9 who has saved us and called us with a holy calling what's your purpose in life to live holy amen it's that simple holy means separated amen just live separate from the world live separate from the lust of the Flesh and now you're doing exactly what God called you to do Hallelujah you can that's my purpose amen and he was saying well the only thing we can do is enjoy life and he uh this this this different this this friend malach I know his sister died of cancer she was All Shook Up sister was in her 60s it just happened like that it just happened like that real fast and he was just saying how we just got to enjoy life just make the I thought man that doesn't sound very doesn't sound like a very fulfiller in life right you just want me to try to enjoy like uh you know the pizza me try to enjoy the flowers that that's going to make me happy no you got to enjoy the presence of Jesus Christ cuz that's a holy that's a Eternal presence am hallelujah amen see not according to our works but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began Hallelujah you see God's purpose is for you to live a holy calling amen let's go to Ephesians 1 I know there's another one on purpose yeah Ephesians 1 verse 9 having made known to us the mystery of his will see the will what God once done that includes all the teachings of Paul right all the New Testament all the will of God the Ten Commandments all the all the things God brings into the new T the New Covenant as well according to his good pleasure which he has purpose in himself so the mystery of God's will is purpose in himself so your purpose was in God and then God made it known to you it's a holy purpose amen that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ where's that going to happen that's going to happen at the white Throne judgment he's going to gather everything to Christ am Church said sinner Saint whatever it is they're all being gathered together to one person to Jesus Christ both which are in heaven which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestined according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will here it is church verse 12 that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in Christ what's my purpose on this life to praise God to be a testimony for God's glory amen and you can't be a testimony for God's praise and glory without obeying his word hallelujah without living a holy life amen amen what's my purpose on life to be holy Amen to live to the praise of God's glory amen so people can look at me and they can praise God I had another this is the second person that told me this he just told me last night you don't he's not the message but he said the first time I met you I I talked to my wife afterwards and he said is that Jesse guy for real yes you what I told my wife I said yes the soul of me now the Flesh of me is a really awful guy he's my worst enemy I call him bully tell you know what I'm talking about the flesh is my worst enemy but see around him you I remember first meeting him I was just trying to testify just trying to be humble just trying to be a real Christian you just live a reg a Christian Life you know when you meet somebody new you're really trying to show them the love of Christ right and I love that that the very first time he he meets me he's like can this is this guy real yes the Bible said you're like a city on a hill that cannot be hidden praise God that's your light so shine before men that they might see your good works and be to the praise of God's glory amen Ephesians 1:12 Hallelujah that's right that's right look at verse 13 you and I are 13 in whom ye also trusted after that you heard the word of Truth aren't you glad you heard the word of the message the gospel of your salvation in whom also that see after you believed you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promis Amen there's a seal right the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen that's who he's talking to Paul's talking to people that were filled with the Holy Ghost those Ephesians those mature Ephesians Hallelujah they got the Holy Ghost they're they're set aside for God's holy purpose to the praise of the glory of Jesus Christ amen amen all right now you got that I just thought that was fitting I thought that just came to me I didn't didn't write that down but I just thought i' say that now the second reason brother R was not exalting himself because prophets can reference the scriptures that they fulfill brother was referencing Amos 3:7 Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 that's not wrong John did that John the Baptist in John 1:23 he said I am the voice of one crying in the ERS make straight the way of the Lord as said the prophet Isaiah people criticize some of these people that leave the message they criticize brother he talked too much about Malachi 4:5 and 6 and Luke 17:30 what's he trying to do he's being like John the Baptist he said I know my place in the word of God I know why God sent me I want you to receive it if you receive that you'll see so much more of the word of God hallelujah open your heart to the word of God hallelujah and here's the final point this is the the fourth point because remember the other point was that uh other point was that uh brother R always humbled himself I never saw brother exalt himself the one time he did it in the seals he apologized right away remember was in the seals he said uh he was talking about I think the godhead of serpent seed he said I could make if I if I could sit down with that guy I could make his head swim so fast he wouldn't even know what hit him and the people start laughing ha and the brother oh no the Holy Spirit wasn't pleased with that because he he said I put myself in there I could make his head swim brother said I had nothing to do with it he said it would have to be God right and then he even rewards it and says it in a much nicer way Hallelujah let me see if I can find that word that way you got it I don't know if it'll come up let's see Joy so patient with me I like to be able to find these things oh yeah here it is yep Glory it's questions answers on the seals uh this is the morning before he preach the seventh seal so Sunday morning he said you know it shows that people without the baptism of a minister has no business to be in the Pulpit that's right now look what brother brother says I could take that person now by the help of God and hide them in such a knot and make their head swim now brother says oh now I don't mean now that don't sound right forgive me I didn't mean that Lord I felt him check me on that so be careful when we talk about uh putting people in their place be careful you don't exalt yourself like you're going to do it look what brother says I fell and check me on that se so I didn't mean to say it that way I'm sorry he and now here's a nice way he says it I believe that the Holy Spirit could reveal to that person some secret he said that sounds better that's right amen which sounds better I would make his head swim so fast or I believe the Holy Spirit could reveal some secret to that person see the difference in one he's putting himself into it oh I could do this I could make you all I could make your head swim that would glorify me he said but I believe the Holy Spirit could reveal revealing is better than your head spinning right what would you rather have your head spinning after this service or God revealed something to you you'd rather have God give you Revelation see how see how he was so sensitive to the Holy Spirit now he wasn't perfect we're not ex I'm not exalted him I'm just saying he was a mature Christian we you ought to be sensitive I want to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit praise God I want to grow in such a way where I can be sensitive like that if I make a mistake behind the pulpit I'll say Lord God forgive me I want to say it like this amen and one time I'll just share this you know Sister Zur texted me out I didn't plan to share the sister but I hope it's okay by God's grace she had texted me last year and said brother Jess you know I said something that very kind she said it very kind she said uh I hope you're not being vexed by people on the internet you remember that remember she told that I was like you're right sister in my mind I thought you know you you can sense that I'm vexed by people I thought that was really good that was really sensitive there sister and so since then it's been many months I've been trying not to show the vexation against certain individuals right I just been trying to just say broadly you know broadly you got people that attacking brother Bram people that worship brother Bram I'm trying to stay right down the middle of the road amen amen that's right we have to rebuke sin Jesus rebuked it Jesus got out the Rope sometimes and you probably heard me tonight probably sound like I was breaking out some ropes a little bit you know by God chist some digital ropes over the internet you know not here because you all love the Lord and you're in one Accord and you love the Lord Jesus Christ but even the Savior I told that to the brothers down there in Junction City even the Savior said he looked at them and he was angered at them because of the hardness of their hearts sometimes anger is Justified when people are so hard-hearted that's right but you've got to trust God if you're being humble God will lead you to that at the right time amen and if not you got to know this too God will check you when you're wrong and you've got to be humble enough today and say oh I'm sorry I got upset it' sound better if I said this right and you can bring back that real sweetness of the Holy Spirit oh hallelujah praise God brother said it's just like tuning an instrument I'm not a musician so I I I can understand this a little bit right they got to brother amen's got to turn the dials on the on the uh the guitar you to make it sound Just Right Said serving God is just like tuning an instrument when you do something wrong you can tell it as a Christian now what about all these people that went like we talked about it they split churches and they don't even know they're doing wrong they are so out of tune with the Holy Ghost they don't even they they have no fellowship with the Holy Ghost we just talked about they're actually having fellowship with demons if they spit it for a bad reason I'm talking about ever understand that they're so out of their their guitar are Out Of Tune they don't even know it's out they're they're their their their senses are D they've lost the ability to hear if it's in tune or not that's what the Bible says if you keep sinning you're you're U you've lost you gone past the feeling of feeling the sensitivity of the Holy Spirit praise God you gone past feeling he said I said something wrong he didn't like that he said see that was putting me in there see I ain't in the picture at all God help us to have that idea next time we talk to somebody Lord I'm really not in this conversation you just be in this conversation right I'm not in the picture at all because I'm going to make a mistake I'm going to exalt myself I'm going to pridefully try to do something pridefully you know yeah what a sensitivity to the Holy Spirit God didn't like that I don't even want to be myself or nothing it's him let him do the work he does the sounding the trumpets IM mute the voice behind it the one that gives the sound that's right I'm trying to close I'm at 54 minutes here it's already 8:30 okay you've been a good audience as always I just like to say that that's kind of like my refresher phrase and try to bring this down to the close now here's the last thing the fourth reason people misunderstand brother brand after context this one is kind of related to context but they fail to see brother random emphasizes his Humanity numerous times in the same sermon in other words throughout the whole sermon he's not saying oh I'm the Lord Jesus Christ I'm the Elijah I'm the Lord Jesus Christ he's not saying that in paragraph 97 he said I'm getting to be an old man and I know my time ain't too long that doesn't sound like somebody who's exalting themsel as God he said if Jesus carries I could stay a little while but I know that someday this heart's going to make its last beat and listen I'm entering into a great dark chamber there called Death right he's not exalting himself in this sermon but when that comes I don't want anything to have to look back for to try to repent for look at this I want when I come to that time to be clean and pure by the grace of God I want to wrap myself in the Robes of his [Music] righteousness Jesus he's not exalting himself he's humbling himself and church he died in less than a month don't you know God gave him some kind of Clues I mean there's all these kind of clues in his last few sermons like he's talking about yeah even in his last sermon he said this may be my last sermon yes and Leadership too he said leadership too that was his second to last his last full sermon was leadership he said this might be my last sermon so let me say this he was a man who knew God was going to he knew he was crossing over he says when I enter there into that dark chamber Called Death think about that this one thing I want in my mind that I know him in the power of his resurrection and when he calls I'll come out from among the dead and live with him forever amen he's not saying I'm him he's saying I'm I'm trusting I have his righteousness on by his grace and I hoping that he calls me Hallelujah I'll live with him forever I'm not him I want to live with him forever praise God why don't they bring up this quote because they don't want you to know that quote they want you to believe the slander yeah they want you to believe the lie we're not going to believe lies I ain't got a lying spirit I got a truthful Spirit Hallelujah I got the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen at the end he's giving an altar call I'll close with this one here yeah I'll close this he said with every head bowed every eye closed all across the nation raise your hands here in the visible audience and out there too I'll offer a prayer for you that's all I can do I cannot fill it now earlier he said uh he said said raise your hand if you want the Lord to fill your heart look look brother says I can't fill your heart he says that's all I can do I cannot fill it he said God bless you I cannot fill it God bless you and you God can fill it God bless you hands are going up here in the visible audience everywhere fill it Fill Me Oh Lord fill me he said thank you sister thank you brother God bless you God bless you dear sister I think now I've caught the most of the sincere trying to be and I want to raise my hands with you brother said I want to raise my hands I want to be filled with god let's stand to our feet by God's grace I can come just pray uh play Grace Grace God's grace marvelous grace of our loveing hallelujah how many enjoyed the word of God tonight amen hope this was helpful proving all things this proes brother randam uh was just a humble Holy Ghost filled Prophet I'm saying just I'm trying not to Magnify Him anyway I'm trying to give hon the Bible said give double honor to the elders right we give honor to brother we give honor to John the Baptist we give honor but we don't worship anybody except Jesus Christ right that's what this proving all things about if you actually sit down and you cry out to God for understanding God Give me the give me the knowledge give me the wisdom I need to understand this if you actually simple things to us amen you know many people will take that quote and say look brother Ram exalted himself oh I'm done with the message and then they'll go live in the lust of the world I'm not saying all of them but some of them they'll take that and they'll use that misinterpretation as an excuse to go love the things of the world and walk away from all the Bible commands brother Ram gave us by the Compassionate Heart Of God God Is So compassionate to us isn't he it's God's compassion remember Jesus Hallelujah Glory Jesus looked out and he saw the m had compassion on them cuz they were sheep without a Shepherd now Church listen akan Ohio had no Shepherd but he had a bunch of sheep here hallelujah and I count it me I'm counting me as a sheep too because I'm under the great shepher and see God's compassion sent us the message brought us all together and now we can be led by the Holy Ghost amen we can feed on the body word of the son of man amen amen how many enjoy the Sheep food of God's word oh we love it by the grace of God let's bow our hearts to the Lord here how many would say brother Jesse let's pray for me that I'll be more sensitive to the holy spirit so I'm not in it God's in my life that's what I want Church feel me I so glad after last night hearing that that people say are you for real is this person even real because they only see Jesus Christ I want people to see just Jesus Christ in me I don't want anything in it I want people I want
