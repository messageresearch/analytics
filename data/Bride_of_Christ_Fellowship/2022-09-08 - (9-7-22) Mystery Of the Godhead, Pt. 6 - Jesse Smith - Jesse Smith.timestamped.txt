[0:00] prayer and psalms to lift our
[0:02] spirits and souls that's exactly what
[0:03] god
[0:04] told us to do by the grace of the lord
[0:06] amen
[0:06] i think i left my bible back there
[0:09] dude can you look in my bible my old
[0:11] scorpio
[0:12] appreciate that
[0:14] i
[0:17] uh let's read for our text matthew
[0:19] chapter three i want to try to finish
[0:21] uh this series on the godhead i started
[0:23] a while back
[0:26] and i'll show you in a moment it's not
[0:27] that i'm sure on things to preach there
[0:29] is so much to preach i always feel
[0:32] overwhelmed i got i'll show you the list
[0:34] of all the things i want to preach
[0:36] there's there's just
[0:38] i just feel like i got to finish them at
[0:39] some point i don't know what i'm
[0:40] finishing i'm going to try to finish it
[0:42] so matthew chapter 3 verse 13.
[0:44] you know simon comes first beautiful
[0:46] message now that one makes me want to
[0:47] preach on some of those topics
[0:48] you know how this is done
[0:50] you've been around a long time
[0:52] hallelujah
[0:54] i feel like i can only scratch the
[0:55] surface you know
[0:58] god for his grace and mercy matthew
[0:59] chapter 3 verse 13 like to look at the
[1:01] mystery of the godhead part 6 tonight
[1:03] praise god i'm going to try to preach 45
[1:05] minutes lord willing god's grace we'll
[1:07] see how that goes
[1:09] trust the lord will bless each one and
[1:11] speak to us this is a very important
[1:12] topic church don't ever think you know
[1:14] that this would be a time to go to sleep
[1:16] and time to go to sleep you know in my
[1:18] own human thinking we would think well i
[1:19] believe god's one person
[1:21] but there's so much implication to this
[1:23] subject
[1:24] as far as with the squeeze
[1:27] as far as with the tribulations that's
[1:29] why we can't fall asleep during a sermon
[1:30] like this okay
[1:31] so i know it's not the most maybe
[1:33] shouting service but
[1:35] i just want to tell you ahead of time
[1:37] there's major implications with the
[1:38] trinity uh dogma that the catholic
[1:41] church is going to try to push on
[1:43] everybody
[1:44] so that's kind of where we'll go and
[1:45] with that thought but let's try to get
[1:47] through this chapter here like i said i
[1:49] wrote it a number of years ago now a
[1:50] couple two two
[1:52] two years ago by god's grace but
[1:54] matthew chapter 3 verse 13.
[2:01] i'll read 13-16 and then we'll all join
[2:03] our voices for 17. then cometh jesus
[2:06] from galilee to jordan unto john to be
[2:08] baptized of him but john forbade him
[2:10] saying i have need to be baptized of
[2:12] thee and cometh thou to me
[2:14] and jesus answering said unto him suffer
[2:16] it to be so now
[2:18] for thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[2:21] righteousness so even christ our lord
[2:23] had to fulfill all the righteous
[2:25] commands god had in store for him how
[2:27] much more us to fulfill all right
[2:29] see the reason you're still alive is
[2:30] because there's more things you have to
[2:32] fulfill amen when god's done with you he
[2:34] pulls your card the angels come pack you
[2:36] to the next dimension praise god
[2:38] you've got angel pallbearers
[2:40] but until that time there's righteous
[2:42] things for you to fulfill
[2:46] then he suffered him
[2:48] and jesus when he was baptized went up
[2:50] straight away out of the water and lo
[2:52] the heavens were opened unto him and he
[2:54] saw the spirit of god descending like a
[2:56] dove and lighting upon him
[3:00] look at verse 17 let's read that
[3:01] together one two three and lo a voice
[3:04] from heaven said this is my beloved son
[3:08] in whom i am well pleased may god add
[3:11] his blessings to rhema's word and maybe
[3:13] see that god bless you appreciate all
[3:14] the saints be in the house of lord
[3:15] tonight appreciate your faithfulness
[3:18] there's nowhere else i'd rather be than
[3:20] in the house of the lord with the saints
[3:22] of god hallelujah i truly mean that that
[3:24] is the joy in my heart praise god to
[3:26] come to church and see all your smiling
[3:27] faces and
[3:29] worship with you and love god and trust
[3:31] god for all things praise god so here if
[3:34] you switch over just for a moment then i
[3:35] won't have slides for all these but like
[3:37] i said i have
[3:38] many many subjects i'd like to i need to
[3:40] finish first i have at least five series
[3:42] i need to finish
[3:44] okay and then uh here's here's the first
[3:46] five i got god had to finish i got the
[3:48] tabernacle there's a i wanna i wanna
[3:50] break down with the tabernacle the high
[3:52] priest i wanna show the day of atonement
[3:54] with the high priest because that all
[3:55] types jesus christ amen there i have a
[3:57] whole i found a webpage on it i'm like
[3:59] oh my goodness look at all this so i'd
[4:01] like to preach that i got another one i
[4:02] forgot to put on here paul the tent
[4:04] maker i forgot about that one i want to
[4:05] show you all paul's jobs so i forgot to
[4:07] put that around here maybe i can put on
[4:09] there right now
[4:10] but uh i wanted to finish the book of
[4:12] colossians i think i'm only three
[4:13] services into that one
[4:18] okay
[4:20] and then i want to finish the money
[4:21] series i have a couple more bible
[4:22] studies to do on that one and i have one
[4:23] at least one mighty man series left as
[4:26] far as what scriptures that we can quote
[4:27] and believe on
[4:29] uh and then the ones
[4:31] review
[4:32] uh you know it was expressed by amen and
[4:33] who and brother uh austin yo you're good
[4:35] to go over the book of revelation and
[4:37] review the seven seals the deeds of
[4:38] nicolaitans
[4:40] i never preached that seven church ages
[4:41] chapter out of the book it's a it's just
[4:43] a slightly different approach than the
[4:45] church age book
[4:47] so i feel like it would help you
[4:49] uh if i preached on that a lot i put up
[4:51] i put more history in there than what
[4:53] the church hate had i shouldn't say more
[4:54] i put additional history into that
[4:56] chapter from church history
[4:58] than the church age book even has so
[5:01] it's loaded with that i like to preach
[5:02] on revival and miracles uh there's a
[5:05] time and season for that and
[5:07] i'd like to see some more miracles by
[5:08] god's grace we gotta hear the word of
[5:10] god many times to inspire us for those
[5:12] type of things i like to look at slavery
[5:15] in the bible i have notes on that i just
[5:16] haven't finished that uh nature where's
[5:18] nature she requested brother graham's
[5:20] life story so at some point i'd like to
[5:22] show the scriptures and just hit some
[5:24] highlights of his whole life i would
[5:25] never have time to preach his whole life
[5:28] um
[5:29] but maybe hit the highlights and show
[5:30] how in his childhood he was like joe
[5:32] because he's heard from the whirlwind
[5:34] okay and then he was given two signs
[5:36] like moses
[5:37] okay and then he became elijah and he
[5:39] also is our eliezer
[5:41] i mean it's just it's unbelievable you
[5:43] can tie all the quotes you know all the
[5:44] different quotes from brother branham
[5:45] and uh you can tie that all in together
[5:48] and then you know brother jose bought me
[5:49] this book called generations and it has
[5:52] i would say 20 or 30 eyewitness
[5:54] testimonies
[5:55] of brother graham's ministry that you
[5:56] hear on tape and you get you get to hear
[5:59] them testify about what god did through
[6:02] brother branham in their lives and it's
[6:04] beautiful you can go back and listen to
[6:05] it on tape i've done that a couple of
[6:06] times i'm like oh this is beautiful the
[6:08] person that brother way was raised from
[6:09] the dead his testimony is in there his
[6:11] wife's testimonies in there you know
[6:13] billy paul course i differ with him on
[6:15] his teachings you know
[6:16] uh but he saw numerous miracles
[6:20] so like i said this is just a few of
[6:21] them i tried to get them on there so
[6:22] you'd see a it's not that i'm like
[6:24] lacking things to preach it's like which
[6:25] one do i do
[6:27] you know
[6:29] i want to be faithful
[6:30] but just real quick before i turn this
[6:32] off you know this was
[6:33] when we looked at you know the
[6:34] but we looked at some of the parts of
[6:36] the trinity this is the shield of the
[6:37] trinity remember i'll show you this it's
[6:38] in the book
[6:40] the main lie here is that the father is
[6:42] not the holy spirit that's the main lie
[6:45] because the holy ghost is the father the
[6:47] father is holy
[6:48] father's spirit jesus said that's the
[6:50] main lie and because of that
[6:52] contradiction this this this creed
[6:54] easily falls apart right
[6:57] and never really trinitarians will never
[6:59] say they'll never say they believe in
[7:01] three gods but that's what they're
[7:02] that's what they actually teach
[7:04] okay because just like you know satan
[7:06] will never come out and say well i'm the
[7:07] devil you know
[7:08] you know he always hides behind a lie
[7:11] the bible calls it uh
[7:13] uh guys he hides behind a a mask you
[7:16] know he's hiding
[7:18] but tritheism is the doctrine of the
[7:20] fathers and the holy spirit are three
[7:21] distinct gods that's actually what the
[7:23] trinity
[7:24] explains or reveals through its false
[7:26] doctrine but they'll never admit it
[7:28] right but they are try theistic in their
[7:31] definition
[7:33] okay and we'll get to some of those here
[7:34] in the next few services okay
[7:36] um so eventually we'll get to this this
[7:38] is what i want to end with that's why i
[7:39] set my timer for 45 minutes okay so okay
[7:41] now you can you can close
[7:44] okay so let's look at jesus baptism
[7:46] we'll try to get through understanding
[7:47] jesus baptism tonight if i can get
[7:50] through that i think i'll be happier
[7:51] i've got like four pages on this in my
[7:53] book so it's an important subject here
[7:55] by the grace of god all right how many
[7:58] of the lord tonight
[7:59] that's the kind of let's refresh right
[8:01] that's the kind of word you're saying
[8:02] but we refresh on that one
[8:04] i'm going to turn the corner here
[8:06] now so does jesus baptism prove god is
[8:09] three persons the answer is no if it did
[8:12] it would prove trifius the belief in
[8:14] three distinct gods
[8:16] because why does one eternal person need
[8:18] to come and fall upon another eternal
[8:20] person that makes no sense
[8:22] if each one is co-eternal why would one
[8:25] that's already eternal need another
[8:27] eternal one to anoint them it makes no
[8:29] sense it's completely contradictory but
[8:32] jesus baptism shows god's power to man
[8:35] manifest himself simultaneously in three
[8:38] ways that's right okay
[8:40] just like you did in the old testament
[8:42] okay he did it many times but one
[8:44] example is the burning bush from exodus
[8:46] chapter three verses one through six
[8:48] moses witnessed god manifest himself in
[8:51] two separate ways at least actually
[8:53] three you know i think about it
[8:55] voice and fire right voice and fire and
[8:58] you could say yeah voice and fire for
[9:00] sure voice and fire
[9:02] now some people might see two persons in
[9:05] that bush
[9:06] right the father was the voice and the
[9:08] holy ghost was the fire
[9:11] okay
[9:12] but that's not true because the fire
[9:15] that fell on pentecost
[9:16] was on 120 foreheads and it wasn't 120
[9:20] different people
[9:21] it was one it was one person uh dividing
[9:24] himself 120 different ways praise god
[9:27] that's right so just because we have a
[9:29] voice and just because we have fire
[9:30] doesn't mean two persons
[9:32] right
[9:33] just like we don't have 120 persons on
[9:35] the day of pentecost
[9:36] nothing in exodus speaks of multiple
[9:39] personalities the voice and the fire
[9:41] we're not showing two separate persons
[9:44] but they reveal god's power to show
[9:46] himself in different forms at the same
[9:48] time
[9:49] now hold up case if you would first
[9:51] timothy 6 16. can you pull that up there
[9:54] i'm going to put you on the spot a
[9:55] little bit here remember acts chapter 2
[9:58] uh says that uh pillar or i'm sorry
[10:00] licks of fire appeared over every one of
[10:02] them praise god in church isn't it a
[10:04] blessing to know that that fire is in
[10:06] your soul praise god amen whether
[10:08] somebody saw it on my forehead or not i
[10:10] know that fire is in my soul because
[10:11] god's spirit is a consuming fire amen
[10:14] it's consumed all the sin desires in my
[10:17] heart praise god now say it like this
[10:19] it's continually consuming my sinful
[10:21] desires
[10:22] because every day i die and the fire of
[10:25] god consumes those fires every single
[10:27] day praise god amen
[10:29] hallelujah
[10:31] so
[10:32] when moses saw the fire god was inside
[10:35] the fire
[10:36] who had who only had immortality
[10:39] dwelling in the light which no man can
[10:41] approach unto
[10:43] so think about that god was in the light
[10:45] after burning bush god was in the light
[10:47] at jesus baptism and god was in every
[10:50] one of those 120 licks of light and the
[10:52] church said amen god hides himself in
[10:55] life amen amen hallelujah
[10:59] he's actually hiding in the light praise
[11:01] god
[11:02] the light is his mask the light is his
[11:05] manifestation
[11:07] now when jesus baptized some people
[11:08] three or see three persons father is the
[11:11] voice sun in the water holy ghost is the
[11:13] dove
[11:15] the true understanding is that god spoke
[11:17] from heaven was his own spirit not a
[11:19] third person descended like a dove
[11:22] upon the man christ jesus
[11:25] okay so we can see that quite plainly
[11:27] now some people say the voice came out
[11:29] of the dove i think there's a quote that
[11:31] says that and other quotes say the voice
[11:33] came from heaven it doesn't really
[11:34] matter right because it still doesn't
[11:36] make three persons or two persons or
[11:38] more persons or ten persons it doesn't
[11:40] make any of that it just shows how god
[11:42] can manifest himself in as many ways as
[11:44] he wants at the same time
[11:47] so this shows one invisible person
[11:50] anointing his visible human image
[11:54] or his visible human tabernacle praise
[11:56] god
[11:57] or his own tent it's god anointing his
[11:59] own tent or his own temple
[12:02] right
[12:03] so one
[12:04] one person is anointing one invisible
[12:07] person is inhabiting the visible image
[12:10] praise god
[12:12] it's like a hand filling a glove
[12:14] that hand comes down to fill the glove
[12:16] praise god
[12:18] right so once inside the glove the hand
[12:21] doesn't become a second distinct hand
[12:24] right
[12:25] it's the same hand belt behind a glove
[12:28] right just like and like a glove jesus
[12:30] body is the image god's person dwells
[12:33] within
[12:34] jesus is not a second person but he's
[12:36] the visible image of god's one person
[12:39] so there's three amazing errors in jesus
[12:42] baptism first it's an heir to say a
[12:45] co-equal son was anointed by the
[12:47] co-equal holy spirit
[12:49] right that's the first heir
[12:52] so why do trinitarians teach that the
[12:54] son needs a third person to anoint him
[12:58] right if he's already
[13:00] fully eternally god
[13:02] why would he need that it makes no sense
[13:04] it's a complete contradiction
[13:06] when you're eternal you don't need
[13:08] anybody's help amen
[13:10] when you're all powerful you don't need
[13:12] anybody to come anoint you because you
[13:14] are the anointed one amen
[13:16] you're anointed with eternal qualities
[13:19] already praise god
[13:21] hallelujah
[13:23] because so the trinity one god needs
[13:25] anointed by another god
[13:27] but the truth is jesus human body was
[13:30] powerless in john 5 19. he said verily
[13:33] verily truly truly i say to you the son
[13:35] can do nothing of himself but what do
[13:37] you see the father do that'll encourage
[13:39] us if jesus always got to do is see the
[13:41] father do it that's all we got to do we
[13:43] just got to see god leading us to do
[13:44] something praise god
[13:46] that's why we can pull so much strength
[13:48] from the body of jesus christ yes he
[13:49] didn't have a sin nature we understand
[13:51] that but he also overcame every
[13:54] temptation praise god amen and if he can
[13:56] do it by the spirit of god we can do it
[13:59] and if he saw god do things then we can
[14:01] see god do things
[14:03] amen
[14:04] and jesus said john 14 10 the father
[14:07] that dwells in me he do with the works
[14:09] well then why did he need the spirit of
[14:10] god to come why didn't he the third
[14:12] person if the first person was already
[14:14] in him doing the works
[14:16] right
[14:18] but if you put up acts 10 48
[14:21] the bible said jesus was anointed i'm
[14:23] sorry acts 10 38 acts 10 38 jesus was
[14:26] anointed with the holy ghost to do signs
[14:28] and wonders and miracles right
[14:31] with power well i thought the father
[14:33] gave him power
[14:36] so he was he was such a lesser eternal
[14:38] person that he needed the father and the
[14:40] holy spirit to give him power
[14:42] does that make any sense it makes no
[14:44] sense praise god
[14:46] that's the first lie jesus body was
[14:48] powerless jesus body was not all
[14:50] powerful
[14:52] jesus christ did not know all things in
[14:54] his human body
[14:56] he didn't know the rapture that's right
[14:57] he didn't know the woman that would
[14:58] touch him
[15:00] right he didn't know those things so god
[15:02] had to make them known to him
[15:04] hallelujah and when he even when it was
[15:06] made known he lifted up his eyes to
[15:08] heaven and he prayed and he thanked the
[15:10] father that god hid these things from
[15:12] the eyes of the wise
[15:13] and rebuked on the babies amen amen oh
[15:16] we don't do the same truth when god
[15:17] anoints us to see things other people
[15:19] can't see we all say thank god lord hear
[15:22] some gratitude that you've opened my
[15:24] eyes amen
[15:26] glory
[15:28] second
[15:29] here's another closely related problem
[15:32] jesus was filled with the third person
[15:33] and his baptism but the doctor never
[15:36] explains when did the first person come
[15:38] in here
[15:39] so see that's a failure of the doctrine
[15:41] they know he's the second person in the
[15:43] water but they don't know they never say
[15:45] when the first person came in here
[15:48] if the first person's in him why's he
[15:49] got to pray for the first person why
[15:51] he's got to pray to the first person
[15:53] right it doesn't make any sense so it's
[15:56] a doctrine that's not fully understood
[15:59] praise god there's not all the answers
[16:01] are given
[16:02] but see all of our answers argue
[16:06] there's one person that person is
[16:08] invisible
[16:09] right and he comes and makes that temple
[16:11] live he puts life he is life amen god is
[16:14] life god is love amen god is life amen
[16:17] and god makes the temple live hallelujah
[16:20] just like god makes you live amen amen
[16:23] but jesus was different his whole nature
[16:25] his human nature was word nature it was
[16:28] holy nature right his first inclination
[16:30] was to obey the word our first
[16:32] inclination is to sin amen
[16:34] and so we've got to overcome that we've
[16:35] got to build up our our strength build
[16:39] up our power through prayer the bible
[16:41] says
[16:42] building up our most holy faith praying
[16:44] in the holy spirit so when the
[16:45] temptation comes we're already strong
[16:47] enough we already know we're going to
[16:49] overcome that praise god
[16:50] hallelujah
[16:53] see when we when we know a temptation is
[16:54] coming on and we feel like we're not
[16:56] powerful enough that's what we got to
[16:57] pray
[16:59] see we've got to be ready we got to be
[17:00] ready for the test ready for the trials
[17:02] and we get that through fellowship with
[17:04] god through communion with god
[17:08] we've got to be ready for it now put
[17:10] isaiah 42 verse 1.
[17:12] hopefully this is the right verse
[17:19] behold my servant whom i uphold mine
[17:21] elect in whom i sow the lion i have put
[17:24] my spirit upon him now look who's this
[17:26] talking this is god talking who's he
[17:28] talking about his son
[17:30] he didn't say i'm going to put a third
[17:32] spirit on him
[17:33] he said i'm going to put my spirit on it
[17:36] see i'm putting my spirit upon my
[17:39] servant
[17:40] not a second spear or a third spirit but
[17:42] my spirit the father put his own spirit
[17:46] on the sun hallelujah
[17:48] that's beautiful so now there's two
[17:50] problems here's the third problem
[17:53] the trinitarianism implies jesus had two
[17:56] separate distinct persons living inside
[17:59] him but the bible never says two persons
[18:01] drawn in him
[18:03] uh john 14 10 says the father the dwell
[18:05] in me who do he do with the works and
[18:08] the holy ghost won't hit him according
[18:09] to luke 4 verse 1. jesus the bible said
[18:12] jesus was filled with the holy ghost and
[18:14] with power
[18:15] hallelujah
[18:16] if the trinity is true then two separate
[18:18] distinct persons dwell in one eternal
[18:21] person
[18:22] but the truth is the father and holy
[18:24] ghost are the same person and jesus did
[18:26] not suffer with the d.i.d multiple
[18:29] personalities disorder
[18:31] right people have that disorder it's
[18:33] called d.i.d multiple personalities they
[18:35] got this personality they got that
[18:37] personality now church there is some
[18:39] truth to that right there's some truth
[18:41] to that
[18:43] in other words we have two natures
[18:44] that's what i mean we have a multiple
[18:46] nature's disorder right there
[18:49] amen paul said amen we just read it paul
[18:52] said the things that i want to do i
[18:54] don't do i hate what i do praise god
[18:57] so we got multiple nature disorder
[19:00] sometimes i do what's right sometimes i
[19:01] do what i hate
[19:03] but i love what he says but it's not me
[19:05] that does the sin it's sin that dwells
[19:08] within me praise god that's a tribute
[19:10] our sin to the right thing it's a sin
[19:12] nature it's not the soul that's inside
[19:15] of us that's a gift from god that's a
[19:17] seed from god that's a part of god
[19:19] that's god's dna praise god amen
[19:23] dna doesn't sin amen god's dna gives you
[19:26] gives you life praise god and god's dna
[19:28] cannot sin so you yourself and your soul
[19:31] and your real nature cannot sin amen
[19:34] i put on that video this week about
[19:36] lukewarm
[19:38] you're luke you're you're your soul is
[19:40] never lukewarm i got some good comments
[19:42] on it there's just a couple but they're
[19:43] like wow this is a mighty revelation i
[19:45] felt that i thought it was too because
[19:47] after simon preach that i was walking
[19:49] right here to the pulpit as i'm walking
[19:50] to the public right about here i felt
[19:52] like something struck me maybe you saw
[19:54] maybe i went like this or maybe i jumped
[19:55] i don't know what happened
[19:57] but i won't as i was coming i was like
[19:58] that's right my soul cannot sin my soul
[20:01] will never be lukewarm
[20:03] glory enough people around the
[20:07] so you and i will never be in that
[20:09] lukewarm state so we don't have to worry
[20:10] about it amen now we we have to approach
[20:13] our salvation with fear and traveling
[20:15] praise god we have to do that but we
[20:17] don't have to worry like oh i'm going to
[20:18] be lukewarm one day or i'm going to be
[20:20] clothed in warm days if god ever puts a
[20:22] fire in your soul that fire will never
[20:24] stop burning amen it's an eternal fire
[20:27] it will consume your life amen
[20:31] it will consume your soul praise god
[20:34] amen so even in your worst moments like
[20:36] brother i'm wearing shorts
[20:38] or brother am lying to the irs even your
[20:41] worst moments that holy fire glory will
[20:43] connect your mind and then convict your
[20:45] body and bring both of those channels
[20:48] into subjection in the word of god
[20:50] amen
[20:52] thank god
[20:54] thank you jesus
[20:58] got that multiple nature disorders
[21:01] i think i just made a new medical term
[21:03] i better patent that
[21:06] make that money
[21:09] oh actually there's a fourth one some
[21:10] believe the holy ghost is sending like a
[21:11] dove upon jesus body
[21:13] that he exists as a eternally visible
[21:16] dove well of course in the book of
[21:18] revelation it never mentions a dove
[21:20] roosting in heaven okay so that's just
[21:22] another mistake a lot of their paintings
[21:24] have old man father young man jesus dove
[21:27] in heaven you never see a dove in heaven
[21:28] praise god i'm not saying there isn't if
[21:30] there's horses in heaven there's
[21:31] probably another heaven
[21:33] if prince is up in heaven and what's the
[21:35] other
[21:36] prince what's the dog
[21:38] fritz yeah if if prince and friends are
[21:40] up there in the sixth dimension i'm sure
[21:42] there's some nubs up there
[21:43] but the holy ghost does not exist as an
[21:46] eternally separate dove from god the
[21:48] father
[21:50] you won't find that in the bible
[21:53] now we get
[21:54] a couple of important points there's two
[21:56] meanings for jesus words fulfill all
[21:58] righteousness first he was setting the
[22:00] example of obedience for all of us
[22:03] that's right
[22:04] if jesus christ the perfect man was
[22:06] baptized each one of us ought to run to
[22:08] the waters
[22:09] because we're the ones that actually
[22:11] need it praise god
[22:13] and he led the example he didn't even
[22:15] need to as far as being baptized
[22:17] represent he had to die to his sin he
[22:19] had already overcome sin praise god he
[22:21] was going to continue overcoming sin but
[22:24] he did it as an example for you and i in
[22:26] other words if jesus did something god
[22:28] help us to model that and do that as
[22:30] well praise god amen
[22:32] amen i'm going to schedule a uh
[22:35] a communion here pretty soon not this
[22:36] sunday but the following sunday night
[22:37] we'll do community by god's grace so i
[22:40] like simon's message on communion i
[22:41] thought well that's a good time to do it
[22:42] by god's grace let's uh let's read renew
[22:45] our communion by the grace of the lord
[22:48] so in tucson i'll try to text everybody
[22:49] about that i text all those dates so uh
[22:52] everybody should have those by the grace
[22:53] of the lord
[22:54] now repentance is what's required before
[22:57] you're baptized but jesus did not need
[22:59] to repent
[23:00] it was only an example but he did need
[23:03] to be filled with the holy ghost amen
[23:05] so that was a good example for him he
[23:08] didn't have to repent but he went down
[23:09] there anyway so one example was
[23:11] uh it was an example be baptized and you
[23:14] shall i mean let's all say shout ready
[23:16] you shall receive the gifts of the holy
[23:18] ghost how do you believe that i promise
[23:19] but austin you believe i promise
[23:21] hallelujah amen assistant you read that
[23:23] promise
[23:23] you shall if you repent and if you get
[23:26] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[23:28] christ jesus christ is going to send
[23:30] this spirit like a dove into your soul
[23:32] praise god amen amen
[23:35] it's a promise of god amen
[23:37] amen and all those sincere souls will
[23:39] receive it amen
[23:42] what does it take just a little more
[23:43] dying out
[23:44] praise god
[23:46] and trust me it takes a lot of dying out
[23:49] it takes a lot of humility to receive
[23:51] the holy ghost that's right
[23:52] you got to be a brother says when you
[23:54] fully surrender he'll come in fully so
[23:56] it's each day each week each month each
[23:58] service we're learning to surrender more
[24:00] and more
[24:00] [Music]
[24:02] right because we've all seen people that
[24:04] could try to surrender for all these
[24:05] decades but then when it comes down to a
[24:07] test they got offended by the message
[24:09] and they need the message right
[24:11] oh my family won't join me i need a
[24:13] girlfriend i need a boyfriend
[24:16] they lead they got offended
[24:18] see they weren't growing they weren't
[24:20] willing to surrender at all may god help
[24:21] us to surrender everything amen amen
[24:24] prove that you're a child of god right
[24:25] that's what the bible says
[24:27] make your calling election sure
[24:30] so he did need to receive the holy
[24:31] spirit so he set that example for us
[24:34] praise god
[24:35] he left jordan full of the holy ghost
[24:37] led by the spirit into the wilderness
[24:39] like we saw with our sister's testimony
[24:40] a couple weeks ago got the holy ghost
[24:42] and instantly into a wilderness
[24:44] sometimes our life is like that we get
[24:46] the holy ghost and then satan's going to
[24:47] test us to see if we really got it right
[24:50] oh but don't worry the holy ghost always
[24:51] stands at the test amen
[24:54] the hunter will never fail a test
[24:56] hallelujah
[24:58] amen was given the spirit though without
[25:01] measure the bible says
[25:03] in other words he has access to every
[25:05] power of god but he always yielded to
[25:07] god's will instead of his own remember
[25:09] he said i could have caught 12 legions
[25:11] of angels he said
[25:12] he could have done it
[25:14] right
[25:15] now we don't have all the measure of the
[25:17] holy spirit so we couldn't do that
[25:19] we can call on god for our request no
[25:20] doubt
[25:21] we can call on god we have those powers
[25:23] and authorities by god's word but it has
[25:26] to be led of the holy spirit
[25:28] amen right god my wife sent me that
[25:30] quote you know um
[25:33] uh yeah it was a quote on saturday my
[25:35] wife sent me that quote
[25:36] brother rand prayed for that dead baby
[25:38] in mexico and amy and i were talking
[25:39] about this and that baby after a whole
[25:41] day was brought back to life his brother
[25:43] saw the vision of it not long after that
[25:45] that family from germany the stud
[25:47] staff cliffs
[25:48] uh stag cliff they lost their baby and
[25:52] the the man was in the military and he
[25:53] could have access he would he but he had
[25:55] a ticket for brother branham he was
[25:57] going to fly the german plane over get
[25:58] brother and come to lay his hands on the
[26:00] baby over in germany but brotherham said
[26:02] let me pray about it first
[26:04] now he just had a baby come back from
[26:06] the dead right
[26:08] you would think his faith would have
[26:09] been what mountain mountains have faith
[26:12] but he said let me pray about it first
[26:15] and he prayed about it for two days with
[26:16] the holy spirit saying no this is the
[26:17] hand of the lord
[26:19] so he said he sent the message back no
[26:21] it's god's will to take that child
[26:23] and then she called her brother and said
[26:24] what we didn't have enough faith he said
[26:25] no the fact you had the plane ready and
[26:28] the the fact you called me show you had
[26:29] great faith
[26:31] but it was the hand of god
[26:33] he said find that clear-cut decision
[26:35] amen
[26:36] see before before we make a boast or
[26:38] before we make a before we just speak
[26:40] something let's get god's decision on
[26:42] something first thing amen
[26:44] that's maturity yeah right that's real
[26:46] maturity
[26:48] that's what the man said i appreciate
[26:49] you brother for getting a clear-cut
[26:51] decision from god that's right before
[26:53] you said oh yeah i'll fly over and raise
[26:55] the baby up that's a serious thing to do
[26:59] so it's a mighty thing to do
[27:04] remember jesus personally verified he
[27:06] received the holy ghost
[27:08] it was in uh matthew
[27:10] 20 verse 22. he said he said you will be
[27:13] baptized with the baptism that i'm
[27:15] baptized with and he just wasn't talking
[27:16] water because jesus didn't get baptized
[27:18] in his own name
[27:20] right he didn't need to get baptized in
[27:22] his own name he just was baptized by
[27:24] john
[27:26] so that's the first example now
[27:29] notice jesus said it becomes made up of
[27:31] all righteous i'm setting the example
[27:34] church the example always is the
[27:36] anointing comes after washing
[27:39] all right
[27:40] amen elijah
[27:42] said pour three barrels of water on here
[27:44] praise god
[27:46] anoint this with water everybody's like
[27:47] you're going to waste all the water on
[27:49] that
[27:50] he said don't worry i've already seen it
[27:52] praise god i've already seen this
[27:53] showdown before and i know it's going to
[27:56] happen that way i can stand i got thus
[27:58] saith the lord i got a clear-cut
[28:00] decision from god amen amen let's anoint
[28:02] this sacrifice with water and then the
[28:05] fire is gonna fall praise god
[28:07] oh that's what happened at jesus baptism
[28:09] he had to be washed first and then the
[28:12] fire fell hallelujah
[28:14] that's what they did in the days of
[28:15] moses at the end of exodus right exodus
[28:17] 40. they had to wash the priests they
[28:19] had to sanctify the tabernacle i don't
[28:21] think i got to this one but they go
[28:23] through all these rituals they wash
[28:25] everything they anoint everything and
[28:27] then aaron and moses think they're mad
[28:28] they might go in and minister but god
[28:30] interrupts and says everything's in
[28:32] order everything's washed everything's
[28:34] clean now i'm coming down i'm gonna fill
[28:36] the temple so that no american glory in
[28:39] this this is the work of god cleansing
[28:41] comes first and then comes the anointing
[28:43] of the holy spirit amen hallelujah
[28:48] same thing happened when jesus was
[28:50] baptized he had to be washed first and
[28:52] then filled with the holy ghost oh lord
[28:54] wash me praise i like what peter said
[28:56] that wash not just my feet but my head
[28:58] also
[29:00] that ought to be our prayer tonight wash
[29:02] all of me praise god
[29:04] wash every part of my life
[29:07] so that your anointing can be on me
[29:08] praise god
[29:10] how many want that by god's grace amen
[29:12] amen amen
[29:14] good 20 minutes in by gosh 25 all right
[29:17] now the second reason he had to be
[29:19] baptized was because uh the bible says
[29:22] offerings the sacrifices always had to
[29:24] be washed before they were offered
[29:26] that's leviticus chapter one verses one
[29:28] through nine we're not going to read it
[29:30] but to have a burnt offering in the old
[29:32] testament the sacrifice had been washed
[29:35] first then cut then presented
[29:38] and then it was accepted so jesus got
[29:41] baptized of course three and a half
[29:43] years before he was offered
[29:45] right
[29:45] because once he was anointed he had
[29:47] three half years of ministry from 30 to
[29:49] 33.
[29:50] praise god when he was 30 years old to
[29:52] 33 years old
[29:54] and the bible said burnt offerings were
[29:56] a sweet savor unto the lord in other
[29:58] words when god gets everything when god
[30:00] gets off of our lives it's a sweet savor
[30:03] unto the lord amen
[30:05] hallelujah
[30:07] that's exactly right and then paul said
[30:09] though
[30:10] paul said in ephesians 5 verse 2 that
[30:13] jesus has given himself for us an
[30:15] offering and a sacrifice to god for a
[30:19] sweet smelling savor
[30:22] hallelujah so had to be washed
[30:24] and then he was cut praise god then he
[30:26] was cut by the cat and nine tails
[30:29] the bible jesus like david said my bones
[30:31] stare at me
[30:33] jesus saw his bone stare because imagine
[30:35] his ribs as a man his bones were staring
[30:38] at him he was looking down at his bones
[30:41] so so incredibly ripped apart didn't
[30:43] even look like a man
[30:45] what would it take to be like that it'd
[30:46] be awful
[30:48] but he this was him this was jesus i'm
[30:50] giving myself as a burnt offering i'm
[30:52] giving god everything my body my mind my
[30:55] soul the bible said his soul was an
[30:57] offering for sin
[30:59] and then when he was offered god smelled
[31:01] the aroma
[31:03] that's holiness
[31:05] that sweet divine device to my nostrils
[31:08] amen
[31:09] someone who gives i imagine the same
[31:11] thing happened when paul was crucified
[31:12] paul was martyred amen or peter was
[31:14] crucified upside down that complete
[31:17] sacrifice that complete dedication god
[31:20] smelled it and it was well pleasing in
[31:21] his nostrils
[31:23] that's a lie that's worthy of the gospel
[31:25] hallelujah
[31:26] may god help us to sacrifice all of our
[31:28] lives
[31:30] right now it's not physical sacrifice
[31:32] it's spiritual sacrifice
[31:34] we've got to cut off anything that
[31:35] doesn't please god and that's a sweet
[31:37] smell in the in those nostrils of the
[31:39] lord
[31:40] absolutely
[31:42] absolutely can the rich man get to
[31:44] heaven absolutely abraham got to heaven
[31:48] right job got to heaven amen can the
[31:50] rich later sin get to heaven yes because
[31:52] we're rich in christ that's the main
[31:54] thing we're writing rich in christ
[31:56] hallelujah amen
[31:58] of course americans are more richer than
[31:59] any other country so we're not rich
[32:01] naturally as well we got everything we
[32:03] need
[32:04] but just like abraham and just like job
[32:07] we can be rich naturally and rich
[32:08] spiritually but we must be totally
[32:10] generous praise god
[32:12] we must be ready to do good works
[32:15] how do you believe that amen if you like
[32:17] going on that money channel i'm saying
[32:18] that for later praise god all right
[32:20] hallelujah
[32:24] that's what we need church we need god
[32:26] we need god to lord over our finances
[32:30] and make our entire life a sweet smelly
[32:32] savior unto him amen
[32:35] he he sees our giving he sees our our
[32:38] love he sees our cheerful givers not
[32:42] grudging givers
[32:43] well okay since brother jesse preached
[32:45] on it here's my last 20.
[32:48] i hear that i'll finally give her it
[32:50] since
[32:51] i've been preached on it no matter who
[32:52] preached on it
[32:53] not a grudging giver but god loves a
[32:55] cheerful giver
[32:57] and just getting some good prayer then
[32:58] you'll start feeling cheerful praise god
[33:00] that's really all we need we're getting
[33:01] into a good service say a hearty amen
[33:03] you'll start feeling good about giving
[33:05] again
[33:05] hallelujah now i got uh 15 minutes here
[33:08] before i want to kind of bring it down
[33:10] to close here so let's look at jesus
[33:12] prayer regarding the 74 luke 22 42 luke
[33:15] 22 42.
[33:20] do uh so this is where trinitarians
[33:22] would say jesus prayers in the garden
[33:24] prove he was three persons
[33:27] right
[33:28] but to us although we pray
[33:31] his prayers reveal his full humanity and
[33:34] help prove god's one personality
[33:39] and this proves god is not a trinity
[33:41] because one co-equal person does not
[33:43] need to pray to anyone else for any
[33:46] advice
[33:47] or any help because he's already eternal
[33:50] he already has everything that he needs
[33:52] he's already co-he's co-eternal co-equal
[33:53] co-powerful co-everything that's that's
[33:56] what their creed says
[34:00] okay so let's read that saying father if
[34:02] thou be willing remove this cup for me
[34:03] nevertheless not my will but thine be
[34:06] done
[34:07] okay so three persons is always equal to
[34:10] polytheism or more than one god multiple
[34:12] gods
[34:14] so jesus prayer shows he's 100 human and
[34:17] 100 deity yet it doesn't equal two to
[34:20] two gods it doesn't equal two persons
[34:22] now the human part had a separate will
[34:24] than the eternal father because that's
[34:26] what he says not my will but thine to be
[34:29] done jesus flesh although sinless did
[34:31] not want to die
[34:33] but he had to get it to surrender to the
[34:35] will of god now if he had to pray to
[34:37] surrender to that what do we have to
[34:39] pray to surrender to our tribes
[34:41] in church we don't have to we don't we
[34:43] don't have to surrender to death
[34:44] necessarily
[34:45] right or persecution we don't have to
[34:47] surrender to that
[34:49] we just have to surrender to not
[34:50] partaking in lust of the flesh
[34:52] lust of the eyes
[34:54] pride of life
[34:55] how much more should we pray
[34:58] right or just be willing to pray
[35:01] like i said i love that what simon
[35:02] showed there the reason that god uh was
[35:05] upset with david he didn't consult god
[35:08] he showed another one who else did he
[35:09] say so he showed somebody didn't consult
[35:11] god do you guys remember
[35:13] josh that's right amen that's right so
[35:15] you're my second member i told you that
[35:16] amen
[35:17] that's what i was thinking about
[35:19] joshua
[35:21] uh and david didn't consult god and they
[35:23] got in trouble
[35:25] see we're gonna get in trouble if we
[35:26] don't consult god now i'm gonna point to
[35:28] some
[35:29] people over here i'm not gonna
[35:31] i'm not gonna point them out too much
[35:32] but i'm gonna point it
[35:34] they got some big consulting to do
[35:38] right
[35:39] or relationships right i'll point some
[35:40] singers like relationships
[35:42] you know
[35:44] you guys got some big decisions coming
[35:46] up
[35:48] i i'm just gonna say this i know i'm
[35:50] gonna see you praying more about god's
[35:51] grace
[35:54] remember our sister's testimony you have
[35:56] to pray before getting married pray
[35:58] before going over to us
[36:00] pray sincerely fast before i before i
[36:02] was called to preach brother i fasted
[36:04] two days
[36:06] faster
[36:07] this is not something you just jump into
[36:10] you gotta know god's behind it
[36:13] and god will show you brother i said
[36:14] just ask him in some way or another
[36:17] he'll speak to you
[36:18] he'll show you his will
[36:20] and if you really don't want to get out
[36:21] of step with god's will he won't let you
[36:23] get out
[36:24] amen because you're surrendered to him
[36:28] does not god honor the integrity of
[36:30] hearts
[36:33] if he'd honor king abimelech's desire
[36:35] not to sin against god don't you think
[36:36] he'd honor your request amen
[36:38] [Music]
[36:40] well you must have known god somehow i
[36:41] don't know i'm not sure how much of he
[36:42] that he was out to back up on that one
[36:44] he knew god's voice that's for sure god
[36:45] talked to him
[36:47] he didn't want to sin against god
[36:52] jesus flesh did not want to die but it
[36:54] surrendered
[36:55] see that humanity needed god's deity he
[36:57] wasn't co-equal a co-equal person
[37:00] the humanity needed the deity the
[37:03] tabernacle needed the glory
[37:05] the tent needed the anointing right the
[37:08] tabernacle needed the fire amen
[37:11] hallelujah praise god
[37:13] see that's the difference between us and
[37:14] jesus he had a word nature we have a sin
[37:17] nature
[37:18] right and jesus
[37:20] was in uh theophany first right he went
[37:23] from thought
[37:24] theophany
[37:26] flesh glorified body that's what
[37:28] broadband talks about and who's this
[37:29] melchizedek we know there's no
[37:31] pre-existence of our souls amen
[37:34] we went from thought to the soul coming
[37:36] down to our mother's womb praise god
[37:41] thought
[37:42] to to to whom and then one day by god's
[37:44] grace of god jerry said we'll get that
[37:46] theophany up in heaven if not we'll get
[37:48] the theophany when we go in the rapture
[37:50] and get the glorified body as well
[37:53] i don't know i think the order actually
[37:54] is on the rapture we get the glorified
[37:56] body first uh that life swallows up
[37:58] death and then we go up to meet the
[37:59] theophany at the rapture if i'm not
[38:01] mistaken brother and i can be wrong
[38:02] that's a minor it's not really like a
[38:04] major thing like you got to know this to
[38:05] be saved
[38:06] hallelujah
[38:07] thank god amen
[38:10] so the two wheels in the garden make two
[38:13] equal persons no
[38:15] it just shows how jesus body was a one
[38:17] of a kind a one and done manifestation
[38:20] for god to dwell in
[38:22] there's never been a body like jesus
[38:24] there will never be another body like
[38:26] jesus he's the one of a kind of god
[38:29] it's a manifestation praise god that
[38:31] body was a manifestation
[38:33] of god
[38:34] was not a separate person
[38:37] it was a house for god to dwell in amen
[38:40] like i said i'm gonna keep saying it to
[38:41] austin memorize it malachi and all these
[38:43] you know for any of you
[38:45] i believe everything the bible says
[38:47] about the god
[38:48] amen and trinitarians can't say that
[38:52] they can't say that because of all those
[38:54] contradictions i just showed right there
[38:56] they can't say that
[38:58] they do not believe everything the bible
[39:00] says
[39:01] but we believe everything the bible says
[39:04] they've got to add words to the bible
[39:05] like they have a greater revelation than
[39:07] paul or peter or james or john the guys
[39:10] that wrote the new testament they don't
[39:11] have nothing compared to those guys
[39:13] hallelujah
[39:16] we've got the revelation what they wrote
[39:17] about
[39:18] god was manifest in the flesh not a
[39:20] second person god was manifest god one
[39:22] person was manifest in the flesh
[39:24] praise god but because it was a
[39:27] one-of-a-kind manifestation it needed a
[39:29] separate pronoun
[39:31] because a pronoun is a thing person
[39:33] place
[39:35] what does it say animal or thing so the
[39:37] body of jesus was a thing
[39:39] praise god
[39:41] or you can say it was the first it was
[39:42] god it was the visible image of god's
[39:44] person you could say
[39:46] but it wasn't a second person
[39:49] because that would be uh that would be
[39:51] uh trithyism because then you have a
[39:53] third person in heaven that'd be three
[39:54] separate gods of course not
[39:57] god's eternal spirit could never die so
[39:59] he needed a tabernacle or a person or a
[40:02] human that would die
[40:05] hallelujah he didn't become a second
[40:06] person it was the same person in another
[40:09] mask amen that's right
[40:11] god in the human form manifest in the
[40:13] flesh the word became flesh god became
[40:15] flesh the father and the son were one in
[40:17] nature the word but with different
[40:20] characteristics
[40:21] the father was eternal but the son had a
[40:23] beginning praise god the son was
[40:25] humanity the son had father and mother
[40:28] praise god but jesus had but god had no
[40:30] father and mother amen amen
[40:38] so i'm gonna just go ahead and
[40:40] close okay we'll go ahead and close
[40:45] we gotta have times in seasons church
[40:46] where i don't preach till 9 30 you know
[40:50] there's got to be a variety of services
[40:51] okay so just bear with me
[41:00] now why is this so important again
[41:02] getting this now to something thank god
[41:03] nobody fell asleep uh that unless a
[41:04] little ones fell asleep but that's okay
[41:06] i want them to sleep if they need sleep
[41:08] they need to do that
[41:09] but why is this so important so
[41:11] important
[41:13] because remember i read this a few
[41:14] months ago
[41:16] brother graham says about the mark of
[41:17] the beast
[41:18] you'll not be able to buy or sell you'll
[41:20] be at the mercy
[41:21] you cannot buy or sell without the mark
[41:23] of the beast or in the hand or the head
[41:25] this mark in the head means that they
[41:26] will have to take the doctrine see what
[41:28] doctor's important of the world church
[41:30] which is trinitarianism and the mark of
[41:32] the hand which means through the will of
[41:33] the world church with this great power
[41:35] the church systems will persecute the
[41:36] true bride
[41:39] it's either gonna take their doctrine
[41:40] okay i believe it i believe or take or
[41:42] follow their rules
[41:44] do their works
[41:45] okay i'll keep the church open but i'm
[41:47] not going to preach about water baptism
[41:48] i can speak about women creatures or
[41:49] whatever
[41:52] now i've been this i like i like youtube
[41:54] preachers especially the ones that point
[41:55] to the bible you know but i listened to
[41:57] a trinitarian he was saying are we wrong
[41:58] about the journey because i thought i
[41:59] was going to preach this today so i was
[42:00] listening you know while driving
[42:02] and he said i would die for the trinity
[42:06] i thought oh my goodness
[42:09] it just goes to show how much of a
[42:10] ingrained deception this is it's so
[42:13] ingrained into them i don't even know
[42:15] why i i can't understand honestly i
[42:17] really can't understand
[42:19] because it's not even the earlier it's
[42:21] not even in the bible the word trinity
[42:23] is not in the bible the definition is
[42:25] not even in the bible praise god
[42:29] but he said i'd be willing to die for
[42:31] this
[42:31] at church the opposite was true they
[42:33] were willing to kill for in the dark
[42:35] ages yeah right and they're going to be
[42:38] willing to kill for it again
[42:39] that's what's coming
[42:41] that's what it's going to come
[42:43] they're down to
[42:43] be willing to kill anyone who doesn't
[42:45] accept the trinity dogma
[42:47] that's why it's so important
[42:49] right because right now they're saying i
[42:50] die for it
[42:52] uh those guys that left the message they
[42:53] call me straight out a heretic right on
[42:55] their podcast or public on their youtube
[42:56] channel i'm a heritage because i don't
[42:58] accept three persons
[42:59] and my question is where is three
[43:01] persons in the bible i'm still waiting
[43:03] i'll be checking my email i'll be i'll
[43:05] be refreshing that email wait where's
[43:06] that verse it says three persons i'll be
[43:08] refreshing it all day
[43:09] i'll refresh it till my fingerprint
[43:11] wears off
[43:12] then gonna find one
[43:14] because god don't want to be known that
[43:15] way god wants to know i'm i'm the lord
[43:17] thy god and him only praise god hear o
[43:20] israel the lord our god is one lord amen
[43:26] but that's why this is so important
[43:28] because one day we may have to take a
[43:30] squeeze for it
[43:31] i'm going to leave this open too one day
[43:32] we may have to give our lives forward
[43:34] because there may be some people that
[43:35] die for it because there's people in
[43:36] nigeria there's christians there's
[43:38] denominational christians dying today in
[43:40] nigeria
[43:42] catholics anglicans lutherans are dying
[43:45] for the sake of christ today
[43:47] in nigeria yeah
[43:49] it's all over i mean you can look it up
[43:50] on the news look up on the internet look
[43:51] up nigeria christians persecution
[43:53] they've been persecuted for years it's
[43:54] probably the most dangerous place in the
[43:56] world to live right now as a christian
[43:59] so let's not leave it out let's not
[44:01] leave it out
[44:02] does it look like it's going to happen
[44:03] right now pretty soon i don't think so
[44:06] we have to see the laws change first the
[44:08] brotherhood told us the laws have to
[44:10] change first when the church and state
[44:12] unite they'll change laws
[44:14] yeah that's what the bible says about
[44:15] the antichrist right they'll change
[44:17] times and seasons
[44:19] and laws
[44:21] you see we
[44:22] they're willing to die for it but
[44:23] actually they're willing to kill for it
[44:25] is what it's going to come down to
[44:26] they're going to be willing to kill for
[44:28] this
[44:30] remember this one uh the image so the
[44:32] beast the roman catholic and roman
[44:34] catholic church and state united states
[44:36] united will keep we'll try to keep the
[44:38] true bride from preaching and teaching
[44:40] her ministers will be forbidden to give
[44:41] comfort and truth to the people who need
[44:43] it but before the antichrist in person
[44:45] takes over this complete world system of
[44:47] churches the true church will be taken
[44:48] away from this world to be with the lord
[44:50] god will catch away his bride for the
[44:51] great marriage supper of the lamb
[44:55] remember church this is thus saith the
[44:57] lord
[44:58] so just gotta just got it mark it down
[45:01] we're coming into a religious
[45:02] persecution with the same things that
[45:03] they did in pagan rome many years ago
[45:05] for its thus saved the lord now what is
[45:06] it setting up on a beast of power
[45:09] the same persecutions from rome are
[45:11] coming to the united states
[45:13] you can see it slowly building up
[45:16] right i showed it to you uh remember
[45:17] after january 6 2001 so some of those
[45:20] cops had a meet uh had a press
[45:22] conference a few weeks later
[45:25] and they said all the evil people were
[45:27] the people that said trump is my is this
[45:29] an evil evangelical christians i said
[45:32] trump is my president jesus is my god
[45:35] and they put all the blame for that
[45:37] on
[45:38] conservatives when yet it was a democrat
[45:41] was the one who shot a republican
[45:43] the only person that died that day was a
[45:45] a republican that was shot by a
[45:47] democratic cop is that right yeah
[45:51] and they're putting all the blame on
[45:52] christians conservative christians
[45:55] right that's what they're all see it's a
[45:56] hatred that's going to come down on us
[45:58] but one thing that's going to be
[45:59] different about it it's going to be
[46:00] religious and it's going to exalt the
[46:02] trinity
[46:04] because that's paganism
[46:06] that's a
[46:07] polytheistic spirit that's the spirit of
[46:10] idolatry praise god
[46:13] more than one god
[46:18] now remember church what have they done
[46:20] when they change it to fathers and holy
[46:21] ghosts instead of lord jesus christ and
[46:24] with all the godhead and all the things
[46:26] i went to uh i went to my friend's
[46:28] funeral i remember my funeral my friend
[46:29] died if you uh this summer my friend
[46:31] died he was a catholic
[46:33] uh he's the guy i talked to him the day
[46:34] before he died i told him god loves you
[46:36] because you've been a faithful father
[46:38] you're taking care of your six kids and
[46:40] god
[46:41] god loves a faithful father like that
[46:43] because he's a faithful father
[46:44] i went to his funeral and it was a
[46:46] catholic funeral
[46:48] and i don't know how many times the
[46:49] people did this i was only there for 30
[46:51] minutes they must have did this like 50
[46:53] maybe 100 times i'm not even joking i
[46:55] would never say that to joker
[46:57] it's so ingrained in them and then you
[46:59] got women there wearing short shorts and
[47:01] showing off their chests and and guys
[47:03] there just not just going through the
[47:05] motions there's just no real sincerity
[47:07] there's no real sincerity there isn't
[47:10] it's not a real life religion right i
[47:12] was thinking like lord give me some oh
[47:14] give me some of that old-time religion
[47:15] praise god
[47:16] i don't want this creed-based religion
[47:20] but when they do that they blasphemed
[47:22] the name of god because the philippians
[47:25] 2 says the name of all names is the name
[47:26] of
[47:28] jesus christ the bible says
[47:30] so the beast opened his mouth and
[47:32] blasphemed against god to blaspheme his
[47:34] name
[47:35] and his tabernacle on them that dwell in
[47:37] heaven
[47:38] they blasting the saints by praying to
[47:40] the saints
[47:41] and telling people to pray to the saints
[47:44] oh yeah in that in that service that
[47:46] 30-minute service i was sitting in they
[47:47] must have prayed to mary at least five
[47:49] or ten times
[47:50] o holy mother and whatever hail mary
[47:54] i just stopped counting after a while
[47:55] like this is just ridiculous
[47:57] praying to mary mary may you comfort
[47:59] this man as he comes in the presence of
[48:00] god like what's very where are you going
[48:02] to comfort anybody
[48:03] it's the holy spirit that's going to
[48:04] come for people it's god's spirit jesus
[48:06] is spirit
[48:08] thinking mary has some type of a work
[48:09] she can do to help a dead man get to
[48:11] heaven
[48:12] it's insanity
[48:14] now here's what simon was talking about
[48:17] and there's some truth to this i don't i
[48:19] don't have all the answers
[48:21] but somehow in the catholic church was
[48:23] found the blood of the prophets and of
[48:25] the saints and all that were slain upon
[48:27] the earth
[48:29] so somehow all the murders go back to
[48:32] the beast system
[48:34] it's hard to understand but it's true
[48:36] the bible says the blood of all the
[48:38] prophets of saints and all every murder
[48:41] look look at that every murder goes back
[48:43] to the catholic church because it's a
[48:45] cage of unclean and hateful birds
[48:49] so somehow i don't know how i looked up
[48:51] jesuits on monday before we end that
[48:53] fellowship you know
[48:54] there's my 45 minutes
[48:57] and it said you know the catholic church
[48:59] set up the jesuits and now they've moved
[49:01] into education as their biggest
[49:03] uh sphere of influence
[49:07] remember tim humes he was he was a
[49:08] message preacher
[49:10] uh jesuit tried to get into his church
[49:11] hung around for about a year and they're
[49:13] driving in the car one time and he said
[49:15] he said you know tim you've got to get
[49:16] that holy ghost shout out and scream you
[49:18] gotta get that out of the church and he
[49:19] said a voice
[49:21] come to him and said it's a jesuit
[49:23] this is when he was the message he said
[49:24] are you a jesuit and the jesus said stop
[49:26] the car
[49:27] let me out
[49:29] and then he stopped and he walked away
[49:32] so a jesuit came in and acted like he
[49:34] was a messenger believer for a year
[49:36] and then tried to become buddy buddy
[49:37] with the preacher so i gotta be real
[49:38] careful who my buddies are you know
[49:41] you you gotta be you
[49:43] [Applause]
[49:45] we all got to be careful
[49:49] that's why i want you to shout for jesus
[49:51] i want you to cry for jesus
[49:53] i want you to scream for jesus
[49:55] weep for jesus some of you need to jump
[49:58] for jesus amen
[49:59] jump as high as you can amen
[50:02] jump for jesus amen amen don't let
[50:04] anything hinder your praise he's through
[50:06] the evolution praise amen amen
[50:08] one time i saw my one time i saw my
[50:11] tongue speaking trinitarian uh
[50:13] somebody's a god pastor jumped like this
[50:15] and he was speaking in tongues
[50:18] i was like ah that'll do that to a 40
[50:20] year old man hold on do it to me i'm 16
[50:22] years old well makes you do the same
[50:24] thing amen praise
[50:26] makes you run around the church and
[50:27] makes me dance like a like a victory dad
[50:29] say man i'm not gonna say a pool makes
[50:31] me dance like a victory dance
[50:33] i might be a fool to the world but one
[50:35] thing's for sure you'll be a fool for
[50:36] somebody i'll be christ's fool later
[50:40] amen you always got liberty to worship
[50:43] christ here with the right spirit amen
[50:45] you know it's not when it's not the
[50:46] spirit they'll growl like an animal
[50:48] i've seen sisters do it i've seen
[50:50] brothers grow like animals you'll know
[50:52] when it's not god
[50:53] you'll know god will give you the wisdom
[50:55] one time the woman in the back she's in
[50:56] the back of this woman
[50:58] she was screaming and going like this
[50:59] everything was a move the holy spirit
[51:00] she was smacking her
[51:02] her sisters next to her like i seen him
[51:04] hit him on the base i'm like
[51:05] what and i didn't understand i was young
[51:07] in the faith but come out if i come to
[51:09] find out that woman was demon-possessed
[51:11] she was trying to distract from the holy
[51:13] ghost that was preaching to me to pull
[51:14] up people to pray for them
[51:16] and actually distracted actually
[51:17] hindered the service
[51:19] and later she had the devil on her and
[51:20] we cast it out later by god's grace and
[51:22] we're not mistaken i'm not mistaken it
[51:23] was one of them so i think we did five
[51:25] demon casts out in that that meeting
[51:28] see you'll know
[51:29] that's why god give you that spirit of
[51:31] discernment
[51:32] i started every song amen amen to know
[51:35] the difference
[51:37] but don't let anybody take away your
[51:38] love for god amen
[51:40] don't let the preacher don't let your
[51:42] mama your dad your brother sister don't
[51:44] let anybody take god loves spontaneous
[51:47] praise
[51:49] hey i amen god it's the judas that wants
[51:51] to shut it down
[51:53] so he must have been the first jesuit
[51:54] okay
[51:57] somehow the catholic church is behind
[51:58] all this money system somehow i don't
[52:00] know how we've got guesses right bankers
[52:02] and catholic bankers
[52:04] we've got some guesses
[52:06] somehow but we know for sure all the
[52:09] murders in the world
[52:10] are from that demonic spear
[52:14] the beast spirit remember it's the
[52:16] spirit that was on babylon it was the
[52:18] same spirit yeah
[52:20] same spirit that was on meats of
[52:21] persians
[52:22] same spirit that was on alexander the
[52:24] great the gracious
[52:25] same spirit that's on
[52:27] ancient pagan rome and now it's on pavel
[52:30] rome somehow i don't know somehow behind
[52:33] the scenes the pope's pulling strings i
[52:35] don't know
[52:36] people he says you don't want war but
[52:38] the bible says it's all from the pope
[52:40] it's all from the catholic church they
[52:42] apparently want the war in ukraine
[52:45] i don't know
[52:46] all i can tell you what the bible says i
[52:48] don't plan to have all the answers but i
[52:49] do claim to have the bible praise god
[52:52] i'll take the bible praise god amen
[52:58] see church the difference between us and
[53:00] the trinitarians we know him we know the
[53:03] one person of god that we don't know
[53:05] them
[53:06] that's right there's not them that we
[53:07] know we know one person amen
[53:10] god almighty the lord jesus christ amen
[53:13] i love these verses this is my chapter
[53:15] this morning i'm like oh this is the
[53:16] perfect right for the message
[53:18] i just messaged my chapter this morning
[53:21] paul said that i may know him
[53:24] who christ
[53:26] in the power of his resurrection and the
[53:29] fellowship of his suffering see we all
[53:31] want the power but don't forget you got
[53:32] to suffer for jesus
[53:34] that's what goes along with it not just
[53:36] power for miracles but suffering goes
[53:38] along with it
[53:40] both
[53:41] if you want to know him you have to have
[53:43] his power but you also have to have his
[53:44] sufferings yeah
[53:46] thank god for the power but thank god
[53:48] for the sufferings too
[53:52] why because the sufferings make me
[53:53] conformable unto his death
[53:57] when i suffer i can relate to how jesus
[53:59] had to die
[54:01] in a little bit of a way
[54:03] and it helps remind me one of these days
[54:05] if jesus don't come back i'm gonna have
[54:06] to die
[54:07] i've got to meet
[54:08] him and i have to know what it's like to
[54:11] suffer
[54:12] so if i suffer like him i can reign with
[54:14] him
[54:16] if i suffer when she's like nobody else
[54:18] suffers like me don't feel bad the bible
[54:20] says there is somebody out there who
[54:21] suffers like you you're not alone
[54:23] right
[54:24] we all suffer there's no temptation
[54:26] except what's common unto man praise god
[54:29] first corinthians 1 13
[54:32] in other words paul says let me suffer
[54:35] anyway by any means as long as i can
[54:37] make the rapture
[54:39] lord whatever you have to happen in my
[54:41] life let it happen that i might attain
[54:43] to the first resurrection i don't want
[54:45] to come up with a second i don't want to
[54:47] have christ say
[54:48] you know
[54:49] i don't have to see the saints up there
[54:51] or me not there i want to sit with
[54:53] christ i don't have to go through the
[54:55] the white throne judgment i don't want
[54:56] to be there i want to be on the throne
[54:58] i'm going to live through the millennium
[54:59] hallelujah
[55:01] i don't want to miss a thousand years
[55:03] with christ on the earth praise god
[55:08] help me to know him help me to know
[55:10] christ's power and his sufferings so
[55:12] i'll be ready for the rapture amen
[55:14] that's what this is saying
[55:16] lord whenever i have to suffer how about
[55:18] this boy this message believer just died
[55:19] at 20 years old
[55:21] 20 years old
[55:24] 20 years old
[55:26] by a drunk driver just like brother
[55:28] brown died from a drunk driver
[55:30] and now his parents what they're
[55:32] suffering
[55:33] but what is it why suffering to be made
[55:35] conformable unto his death
[55:38] to taste have a little taste of what
[55:40] christ had to suffer
[55:42] so that i can be ready whatever god
[55:44] allows
[55:45] and allows me to suffer i'll be ready
[55:47] for the first resurrection
[55:51] this whole chapter is powerful jeremy if
[55:53] you haven't read it in a while you've
[55:54] got some extra time you didn't read your
[55:56] chapter yet for the day
[55:57] jump ahead to jeremiah 9. it talks about
[56:00] all these lies people do israel's in
[56:02] awful condition they shoot their uh
[56:03] their tongue is like a bow and they
[56:05] shoot all these lies and god has had
[56:06] enough of it god's rebuking them they've
[56:08] murdered they've sacrificed their
[56:10] children they've done all kinds of
[56:11] things
[56:12] and and god has jeremiah speak this but
[56:15] let him that glorieth glory in this
[56:19] that he understands the godhead and he
[56:21] knows i'm one person can i say it like
[56:23] that
[56:25] praise god amen amen
[56:28] rejoice that you know which person
[56:30] you're praying to and not there's no not
[56:31] three there's only one
[56:33] hallelujah that's right rejoice that you
[56:35] know the truth
[56:39] glory in the fact that you know the god
[56:42] you know the god of the bible
[56:45] and that i the lord exercise what does
[56:47] he do for us he's loving kindness he
[56:49] shows his loving kindness to us
[56:51] he gives us judgment he makes us
[56:53] exercise in righteousness in the earth
[56:56] for these things i delight saith the
[56:58] lord
[56:59] so see when you judge things the right
[57:01] way god delights when you make the right
[57:03] choice
[57:04] when you make the right when you choose
[57:06] the righteous act god delights in your
[57:08] obedience
[57:10] right when you exercise when you show
[57:12] loving kindness to people that don't
[57:13] deserve kindness you are delighting god
[57:17] everyone hear me amen
[57:19] when you show loving kindness to people
[57:21] that don't treat you good
[57:23] you are delighting god god smiles
[57:26] he smells that sweet savor that's a
[57:28] sacrifice that i can deny
[57:32] because why how can they do that because
[57:33] they know me
[57:35] hallelujah
[57:38] church we all know people that don't
[57:39] know god right i'll bring this picture
[57:41] back up
[57:43] i shared this a long time ago
[57:46] our president
[57:49] he's a trinitarian catholic
[57:51] according to the trinity he's a pagan
[57:53] idolater
[57:55] he's an adulterer he's been married
[57:57] twice
[57:58] he's a murderer because he sends
[57:59] billions of dollars to countries so they
[58:01] can commit abortions
[58:06] right liar
[58:09] abominations there's thing that kind of
[58:11] can't even
[58:12] did you see his daughter's diary came
[58:13] out and he abused her as a child
[58:16] but they hide that
[58:18] it's all in her diary
[58:20] all the drugs they do
[58:23] this is a person who says he knows god
[58:25] as a trinity
[58:27] but we're the ones that know god
[58:30] are you with me church
[58:34] and almost all those
[58:36] people are like all those catholic
[58:38] leaders in our nation anthony bauti
[58:42] i think adam schiff aoc
[58:44] nancy pelosi all these catholic people
[58:48] they say they know god they don't know
[58:50] nothing about god that's right
[58:53] because if they knew something about god
[58:54] they would delight and they would
[58:56] execute righteousness
[58:58] hallelujah
[59:00] they would execute holiness
[59:02] but you're the ones by god's grace
[59:05] who know him
[59:06] in the powers resurrection
[59:08] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[59:10] that's what we need to glory in tonight
[59:14] last thing i'm going to show you there's
[59:15] 8 billion people on earth these are just
[59:16] rough estimates
[59:18] remember i start with the series with
[59:19] this no it's in the beginning of the
[59:20] chapter
[59:22] two point the biggest group are
[59:24] trinitarians so they're
[59:25] pagan idolaters they believe in three
[59:27] persons catholics and protestants
[59:30] two billion are atheists or agnostics
[59:32] believe in nothing
[59:34] two two billion muslim now they believe
[59:37] in one person but it's a false god
[59:40] and a false prophet muhammad i probably
[59:42] i get stoned for saying that if i was in
[59:44] saudi arabia or iraq or iran
[59:47] i get stoned for saying that
[59:48] he's a false prophet in fact my barber
[59:51] asked me that on saturday i got my
[59:52] haircut he's like what do you think
[59:53] about the muslims i think well
[59:55] i said you got a violent sect and you
[59:57] got a
[59:58] a peaceful sect
[1:00:00] but either way their prophet was a
[1:00:01] wicked man
[1:00:03] married lots of women
[1:00:04] lots of murders
[1:00:06] he took a child bride yeah
[1:00:08] he's a wicked man he saw these visions
[1:00:10] and got the book that was a demon
[1:00:13] right visions of demons giving them a
[1:00:15] false bible the bible said if you add
[1:00:16] one thing the plagues will be added to
[1:00:18] you that's right
[1:00:22] i said look at their murderous spirits
[1:00:23] that they have
[1:00:25] yeah they're peaceful ones but you can
[1:00:27] be peaceful you can be sincere yes
[1:00:28] sincerely wrong
[1:00:29] all right but see jesus look jesus looks
[1:00:31] at the peaceful ones and he has mercy he
[1:00:33] has loving kindness on that hey then
[1:00:35] i'm over about 45 of them probably about
[1:00:37] an hour now
[1:00:38] now there's other religions in here too
[1:00:39] of course i didn't cover all of them you
[1:00:42] know like the japan religion i forget
[1:00:43] the name of it right now but there's
[1:00:45] they have millions of them but these
[1:00:46] were the big ones now look at one is
[1:00:48] pentecostal so brother william people
[1:00:50] like us there's 24 million that say
[1:00:52] god's one person
[1:00:54] but then they reject a lot of our
[1:00:56] teachings
[1:00:58] like holiness like god sent a prophet
[1:01:01] right like non-eternal hell
[1:01:04] all these like three works of grace
[1:01:06] they say the tongues is the third word a
[1:01:08] tongue a tongue is the third word
[1:01:11] unbelievable
[1:01:14] now this was the estimate uh about ten
[1:01:16] years ago two to four million message
[1:01:18] believers
[1:01:19] so all these
[1:01:20] comes down to a couple couple million
[1:01:22] i'd say less than that now so many
[1:01:24] people left the message
[1:01:26] recently
[1:01:28] because it's because their preachers
[1:01:30] lied to him all those years they said
[1:01:31] brother ram was infallible every word he
[1:01:33] said was thus they the lord and they
[1:01:35] found out oh he wasn't infallible right
[1:01:38] i'm not lying to you i'm telling you the
[1:01:39] truth chris god
[1:01:40] i put that third video out today i have
[1:01:42] 69 proofs
[1:01:44] not everywhere on papers i'll say the
[1:01:46] lord i was shocked to see that
[1:01:50] and i yeah i still leave was a prophet
[1:01:52] why because he's a human
[1:01:54] you think if i recorded you for 20 years
[1:01:55] could i find 69 or 70 or
[1:01:58] 80 things you did didn't say right right
[1:02:01] i could probably find a lot more than
[1:02:03] that yeah so i wouldn't want to do that
[1:02:06] i wouldn't want you to do that to me
[1:02:07] either you find a lot of things wrong
[1:02:09] that i did thank god for the blood
[1:02:10] praise god amen the things i love i
[1:02:13] can't reach you last time he was here
[1:02:14] i'm sorry two times ago and cam was here
[1:02:16] i think before you got here
[1:02:18] cam said the thing i love about brother
[1:02:19] graham he'd make a mistake in the in the
[1:02:21] in the sermon you know like a human and
[1:02:23] then the angel lord would still forgive
[1:02:25] him and come down and discern their
[1:02:27] hearts and do miracles in other words
[1:02:29] god stands behind his gifts
[1:02:31] the gifts and callings of god are
[1:02:32] without repentance god is a god who's
[1:02:35] rich in mercy amen amen amen church god
[1:02:38] will still stand behind you
[1:02:40] you'll make a mistake and then the next
[1:02:41] week i'll do some great miracle through
[1:02:43] you and yet you just made a foolish
[1:02:44] mistake a week ago
[1:02:46] because god delights in mercy amen and
[1:02:50] you know the living god let's stand to
[1:02:52] our feet musicians
[1:02:54] we're a small minority who believe god
[1:02:56] is one person and believe the entire
[1:02:59] bible
[1:03:02] are you a grateful church to be
[1:03:04] one of those that know him amen
[1:03:08] bro jesse i'm going to glory in my works
[1:03:10] i'm going to glory in all that i do know
[1:03:13] glory in the fact that you have the
[1:03:14] revelation of who jesus christ is amen
[1:03:17] glory in that
[1:03:19] that i know him
[1:03:21] and the enemy is going to use
[1:03:23] the identity of god whether three
[1:03:25] persons or one the enemy is going to
[1:03:27] bring that down to a life or death
[1:03:28] decision that's going to be one of them
[1:03:30] one of the doctrines
[1:03:34] so we've got to be able to stand how
[1:03:35] many want to stand on god's word tonight
[1:03:36] amen
[1:03:39] i appreciate your patience with me
[1:03:42] i'm just going to check real quick one
[1:03:43] two three four five
[1:03:46] six seven
[1:03:48] eight nine ten
[1:03:51] eleven i got eleven more pages in that
[1:03:52] chapter so i got a couple more sermons
[1:03:54] in there you have to bear with me church
[1:03:56] to see how i can teach and i can bring
[1:03:58] in that shouting and screaming and
[1:04:00] jumping
[1:04:01] you can preach and teach at the same
[1:04:02] time
[1:04:03] you can do it
[1:04:05] but you always have that liberty in our
[1:04:07] church to worship god amen
[1:04:09] the bible says quench not the holy
[1:04:11] spirit
[1:04:12] so if you feel like you need to run you
[1:04:13] run around the church brothers
[1:04:15] sometimes i'll do it
[1:04:17] praise god then while since i danced the
[1:04:18] last time i danced was when i said god
[1:04:20] i'll dance when austin gets all his
[1:04:21] bills paid off and i dance for the lord
[1:04:22] i think it was a wednesday night i just
[1:04:24] danced over here for a couple minutes
[1:04:25] house of the lord
[1:04:27] i don't gotta do it amen
[1:04:29] because that's why you dance you got the
[1:04:31] victory
[1:04:32] hallelujah all the desperate pain
[1:04:34] hallelujah
[1:04:36] all the taskmasters are drowned i got a
[1:04:38] new life amen that's why you rejoice and
[1:04:41] give god praise because he knows things
[1:04:43] man cannot do how to do it amen
[1:04:47] thank god
[1:04:49] we ought to be never ashamed to praise
[1:04:50] the lord amen that's why we need to
[1:04:52] preach on revival miracles too because i
[1:04:53] think we need a stirring up don't you
[1:04:55] hallelujah
[1:04:57] i've been talking about all these
[1:04:58] revivals cam and i used to have used to
[1:05:00] have we need to have some revival here
[1:05:01] again by god's grace but we've got to
[1:05:03] pray it down church you've got to pray
[1:05:05] now
[1:05:06] got to frame now
[1:05:07] so i told brother amen this sunday maybe
[1:05:09] i'll maybe i can try to preach 45
[1:05:10] minutes
[1:05:12] now listen if i preach 45 minutes
[1:05:14] i know or preach an hour and a half
[1:05:16] that would give us plenty of time to
[1:05:17] pray after the sermon
[1:05:19] and we could pray for revival and still
[1:05:21] not have a longer service
[1:05:23] and you know when the holy ghost comes
[1:05:24] you forget about the time anyway
[1:05:27] don't really matter anyway
[1:05:28] but what i'm saying is i don't want to
[1:05:29] have any excuses where we're too tired
[1:05:31] to pray
[1:05:32] but it's our prayers that bring revival
[1:05:34] in other words when we get a revival it
[1:05:36] break brings the trash out of our lives
[1:05:37] we cut out everything that we didn't
[1:05:39] really need to do don't really need to
[1:05:40] do this let's devote this energy to god
[1:05:42] [Music]
[1:05:46] i watch those uh message revival some of
[1:05:48] those churches are having message
[1:05:49] revivals
[1:05:51] and i look at that like that's exactly
[1:05:52] what we had in 2009 2010 2011 2012. i
[1:05:57] can look it up on the on cams archives
[1:06:00] that's exactly what we have
[1:06:03] but god says i'll restore sin amen we've
[1:06:06] got to hope for that church we've got to
[1:06:07] hope for a revival
[1:06:09] where people will scream and shout speak
[1:06:11] in tongues miracles will be done devils
[1:06:13] be cast down and hopefully not not out
[1:06:14] of us hopefully the devils get cast out
[1:06:16] of our visitors god that means we were
[1:06:18] clean before god amen
[1:06:21] if we got a devil then we're in a bad
[1:06:23] situation we ought to come up here for
[1:06:24] prayer
[1:06:25] confess your sins let's cast that devil
[1:06:27] out of here
[1:06:28] you know
[1:06:29] you don't belong here
[1:06:31] no devil belongs here there should be no
[1:06:33] leaven in the camp praise god amen
[1:06:35] so we should have the shot of the
[1:06:36] kingdom
[1:06:37] amen god bless you i appreciate your
[1:06:39] patience love all of you let's buy our
[1:06:41] heads for word of prayer
