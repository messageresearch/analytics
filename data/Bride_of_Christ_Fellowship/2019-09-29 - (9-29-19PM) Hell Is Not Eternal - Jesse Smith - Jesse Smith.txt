we read through the church [Music] so I think there's numerous scriptures but I think let's go to let me go down here Luke 16 let's just start with there the rich man and Lazarus the parable there let's just look there because the one thing that was surprising to me was to find out that hell was different from the lake of fire that was a tremendous revelation to me so Luke 1622 all right so that's Luke 1622 and for times sake like I said we'll just read up let's just read twenty two twenty three already twenty two and then we can all read three for twenty three rather Luke 1622 I'll read this by myself and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom and the rich man also died and was buried let's all read twenty three one two three and in how he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom amen let's have a word of Prayer ever need on your heart just make it on unto the Lord here tonight Heavenly Father were gathered humbly Lord but Lord with boldness and gratitude and Thanksgiving for your holy spirit dear God we thank you for your love and your mercy towards us take this word and we understand it better Lord and this would be a blessing to the Saints Lord I know the young ones need it Lord and it was a great refresher for me Lord God so I pray Lord to be a great blessing to everybody so Lord we ask that your divine presence will be with us open hearts open minds in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you be in see the praise god I'm gonna get a few tissues yeah it's that time of year you know the germs come all around and you got a I'm battling germs you know I'm gargling with salt water and everything you know so we'll get the victory thank the Lord for His grace now to two great points I just want to make just from the outset of this you know even today I may get numerous emails there's different people listening in from all over the place you know and you know I think I'll just start off by saying there's two great revelations that come in this teaching that I found you know when someone first right away says or someone hears Oh hell's not eternal usually they they're shocked but there's two great revelations that I found that actually you know give a lot of comfort to to God's people the first is God's mercy that God would not punish someone eternally for just a few decades of sin you know it would be so be so cruel for God to send someone and and punish them without end for let's say ten fifteen you know fifty at the most a hundred years of wickedness and how how cruel that would be for a God to punish them without end for that it just doesn't seem doesn't seem like the merciful heart of God you'd be surprised hurts the you know I've gone youtube a lot to listen to sermons you know and the the men that are like really well-known that believe that you'd be surprised the well maybe you wouldn't be the the doctors of divinity and the smart men that teach that and believe that that hell is eternal and God is eternally gonna punish people you'd be some you wouldn't maybe it wouldn't be surprised but I was surprised second the second revelation is that this doctrine emphasizes that eternal life is a person and not a location so those are the two great revelations that come out of this teaching that I have found of course there's probably more I think a third is what I'm going to get into at the and is that God is gonna share this eternal life with plants and animals that's quite striking because he's taking everything back to the Garden of Eden and so God is gonna share this eternal life with animals and ladies it's just it it's a little bit a little bit mind-blowing for our highs but what's that yeah it's good thought yeah I came to me this week I was like wow oh yeah maybe that worm can live eternally because we'll get to that a little bit you know because the horses are gonna live eternally the Tree of Life is gonna be a turner off the line lamb I mean that starts the Millennium that's gonna carry over so God is actually gonna share his eternal life with his creation which wasn't that's so merciful isn't it that's so merciful that he's gonna let them live eternally you know so let's look here now the purpose this is a show that unbelievers will not burn eternally without end in the lake of fire I'm reading off my script here for this next YouTube you know I'm probably recorded tomorrow morning unless I start shout and scream and lose my voice here tonight by the grace of Lord cuz I gotta have some voice so to summarize this briefly for those who maybe they'll listen to the beginning but not the end unbelievers cannot burn or suffer torment for eternity because they do not possess eternal life because eternal life is God's Spirit eternal life is a person eternal life is God because Jesus said God is a spirit according to John 4:24 Lydia can you pull it up there John 4:24 so we'll show it later but God's Spirit is the only spirit with eternal life it is the only one that has eternal life and here's what I was mentioned this morning which has opened up to me a little bit more - I never thought about it unbelievers may suffer in Hell right now because hell is a prison house and they may suffer for thousands brother Graham said maybe even Millions he may let them do that but it will not last eternally and because after the white throne judgment unbelievers may be tormented in the lake of fire for many years but at some point they'll be annihilated and done away with because they rejected the person of eternal life the Lord Jesus Christ God's to merciful and loving to require unbelievers to suffer an eternal number of years without end for only disobeying for one lifetime solidia pull up there John 4:24 God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth so God is a spirit and that spirit is immortal eternal it's eternal life praise God now here's a great statement I'm just gonna I'm gonna reword brother Graham statement cuz he says it in the church age book I'll just read it from the church in you book now if a sinner is going to go to hell and then suffer the same amount of time as you are going to heaven and enjoy heaven then he has the same kind of life you have already in that great I just that was beautiful out my hats I'm gonna put that right on YouTube they need to hear that happen so you know then what then what good is the Holy Ghost if a sinner is gonna burn eternally what good is the Holy Ghost cuz I'm gonna live eternally so they're gonna be turtley too but in the reality we know the Holy Ghost is the only form of eternal life the human soul as we said this morning the soul is the nature of the Spirit that the human spirit can live a very long time it's already you know the oldest ones have already lived 6,000 years right nothing about the demons the demons have already lived many many many years who knows maybe millions if not trillions because their spirit was made to be a supernatural being but that doesn't mean because it that doesn't mean it can't be destroyed though if God created it God can destroy it so it's important to emphasize that if the sinner is gonna burn eternally then he's already got the same life you have but we know he doesn't Amen because the Bible said murderers do not possess eternal life let's read that in first John I believe it's first John three no murderer has eternal life I'm just gonna pull it up here because yeah three fifteen yeah first John 3:15 well let's just go to 14 for John 3:14 we know that we pass from death unto life because we love the Brethren see if we should love each other so much right that we always want to help one another we always want to be with one another that's how I know I pass from death unto life I love God's people so that's why John will later say in the same book they went out from us because they were not of us so see the church membership peoples make the light think of that but I've always God's always put on my heart it's a very important thing being a Holy Ghost fill member of a church being faithful to church right and loving the people in your church he that loveth not his brother abideth and death see he's see we're currently abiding in life they're abiding in death whosoever hath his or hated his brother as a murder and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him amen see it's plain by the scripture no murder person who had confessed or I'm sorry with unconfessed sin has eternal life you don't have it so you can't burn eternally if you don't have eternal life so very plain scriptures there we're starting with now let's again show how hell and the lake of fire not the same thing hell of course we read that in Luke 16 hell is the prison house so let's read that in first Peter 3:18 Lydia 1st Peter 3:18 this is good for the children because they'll wait to see this where's Haven okay there's acacia there's all right there first Peter 3:18 I want them to see this we often use this like we said this morning with the resurrection and how Christ preached to the spirits in prison Christ went to hell in the theophany form right with his theophany and then preached to other theophanies for Christ also hath once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits and prison so there it is he went preach this appears in prison which sometime were disobedient when once the long-suffering of God waited the days of Noah while the ark was a preparing where a few that is eight souls were saved by water so prison is another name for Hell okay because he'll of course means the grave we know brother ma'am and the Greek teaches that the grave so we know there's a natural grade but there has to be a place for this the spirit a spiritual grave for the souls and spirits of men and the Bible says right here he went preached to the spirits in prison so the spirit of course remember the soul is the nature of the spirit so those spirits are down there of the unbelievers and Jesus went and preached to them sort of other words Jesus went to hell and preached to them for and rebuke them for disobeying Noah praise God so prison house and the prison is another word for hell and it's located in the heart of the earth that they pull up Matthew 12:40 it's in the heart of the earth now as you're turning there here's a real deep thought now this is a new thought I never had before so Jose and some of you Wendy here's some good here's a good thought for you when Jesus resurrected I'm just saying this I don't know if he brought up all the Old Testament Saints because the Bible and he says many of the Saints and brother ma'am emphasizes not all many so I'm just saying there may be some Old Testament Saints like we would say saw those are that were just barely saved lot they may be still down in what used to be a Rams bosom their spirits have to be somewhere and the spirits think maybe that maybe Jesus might have brought all of them and maybe just let some of them maybe just let the really wise ones resurrect but I'm just going out on a limb here was because the Bible said that the souls under the altar were up in heaven the Jews from the Holocaust days right so there's they the Jews from the Holocaust days they weren't born again but yet they went up not down and they didn't have the baptism the Holy Ghost so that's another thought like it's interesting I don't know if all the Old Testament Saints came up or not I don't know but it's a that's a deep thought and that's about as deep as I'm going on that subject right now so let me know afterwards if you got a good thought on that you do okay good let's talk about that afterwards but here the Bible said for as Jonas is in the three days and three nights in the whales belly so this shall the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth so hell is in the heart of the earth and Jesus descended down there and preached unto them and then the Bible said he led captivity captive we're familiar with that most of the children are aware of that Ephesians 4:9 Lydia's you can pull up there now he that ascended but what is it but he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth so we could call it hell prison house lower parts of the earth the heart of the earth the Bible describes it in numerous ways now while he was down there he took the keys of death and hell because Satan had rights over all the sinners up to that point he could keep them down in the heart of the earth he had rights because Adam was a ruler of the earth but when Adam when Adam fell and purposely sinned on purpose he lost his Dominion and Satan took the Dominion because the Bible said Who am ever your overcome by or held in bondage under that person right that's in 2nd Peter chapter 2 verse 9 I believe I'm not mistaken so because Adam was willingly overcome by Satan then he threw all mankind into slavery to the devil in Hell right so they're all under there Satan's got a hold on them he's got the power of death and that's why that Witch of Endor could pull up spirits because there was no blood of Christ to protect them yeah because Satan had power he had the power of death and that woman being anointed with the spirit the evil spirits she could access with Satan's help she can access those souls my but when Jesus went down his head this morning he paid the price of all the sins and he was worthy to take the keys back amen in other words he'd lived a holy life and so Satan couldn't pin him down and said look I got you jesus said I got you I defeated you and I'm taking those back because I'm a righteous one hallelujah I was an innocent one kill for the guilt praise God and I overcome so he took the keys of death in hell and then through that he could he could call all these Saints and all Brahimi's bosom call them up to the Earth's surface and resurrect them revelation 1:18 Lydia just pull it up so everybody especially the young ones can see it Haven in a case you there everybody can see it I don't know if I taking Malachi and Lydia through this study or not have I just in the church age book revelation 1:18 I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am Alive for evermore and have the keys of hell and of death jesus went down lived a holy life and he had authority and power to take those keys back praise God okay and Matthew 27:51 Lydia let's read about the resurrection he first descended and then he ascended so he went down to hell for us that we don't have to go to hell praise God amen thank you Jesus 27:51 and behold the veil the temple was rent in twain from top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the grace were open in many bodies of the saints which slept see many for his resume into the holy city and appeared unto many so see not all of course many so that would mean Isis were the wise virgins of their day we're resurrected I imagine they'd have to be and but the foolish it doesn't look like were because the Bible just has many not all all right now I just want to show this though - let's go back to Luke 16 verse 23 this is a point I want to make - when sinners die they go to the prison house in the heart of the earth or hell and there is a level of torment right just like I you know I have a couple of friends that have been in prison before I got one in prison or person right now it's torment he's got to battle that because there's nothing to do really there's no freedom your your your slave and it's just mental torment and he always tells me you got to stay positive he said you got to you got to speak positive things or I'll she'll go crazy in there cuz he's been in there 10 years seeing hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom next verse there's a fire there - and he cried saying father Abraham have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue for I am tormented in this flame so he's in a flame and he just wants water right just like today people in prison just want to be free they just like my friend told me I just want to be around nobody cuz he's been in there 10 years he's always around somebody no no personal space see we take that for granted don't we then you can lock yourself in your room and just have peace and quiet they can't do that in prison because prison is torment it's made to be that way it's supposed to be that way it's supposed to be punishment so here we see there's a level of torment in hell but it's not the same type of torment that'll be in the lake of fire okay and notice has his human spirit see a lot of people misunderstand that quote brother Ram said when you die your spirit breaks up they they kind of misunderstand that because this man still has his human spirit okay go down to verse 27 Lydia I think that's it yeah cuz he say he said won't you send Lazarus back up to my brother so they can be saved and what isn't that next verse verse 28 what is Abraham's I'm sorry next 1:29 they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them to see he's he still got his insincere mind he still he's still trying to figure things out with his human spirit so his human spirit didn't break up like like we think of that means it may mean something else like it may break up from your body that's maybe what it means but it doesn't like vanish because here a man's in hell and he still has his wrong thinking and under the fifth seal the Jews are crying out for vengeance well that's not the right attitude but their spirits aren't those spirits aren't the right spirits because they want revenge that's the wrong spirit vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord so see the human spirit and soul stay together until the white throne judgment then they get cast like a fire and then its destruction annihilation time and God lets them keep their thinking because that's their character they chose the evil character but we choose godly character amen that's the character we're taking with us hallelujah now now go to Revelation 20 verse 13 let's read this now you'll hear you'll see here this was the scriptures I did it for me death and Hell will be cast into the lake of fire I don't know this part I don't understand either I don't know how that how does hell in the heart of the earth get cast and lake of fire I'm not sure about that I'm not sure I don't know how to explain that to the church but all's I know whatever location that is God somehow gonna take it out of the earth and throwed burn it in like a fire I don't know verse twenty thirteen revelation twenty thirteen and this gave up the Dead which were in it and death and he'll delivered up the Dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works oh look he'll has to obey the word right the word says deliver up every soul and so he'll obeys this had this I don't know this location or this hole this prison house has to obey and so it sends all the souls to the white throne judgment but then in verse fourteen death and he'll were cast a lake of fire this is the second death so see hell is not eternal and sinners will not be tormented in hell eternally so I hope that's clear now go Lydia Matthew 25:41 now next thought this is the next section the first section is we just went through a hell in the lake of fire kind of defining them the second section is that hell had a beginning but God's children do not God and his children do not have a beginning in the soul that's what I'm talking about so see in Matthew 25:41 hell was prepared or had a beginning so that means anything that had a beginning has to have an ending so the Bible said then he shall say to them on left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels now I'm quoting the church age book now if it was prepared then it wasn't without a beginning it had if it had a beginning then it can't be eternal praise God now the beautiful part is that the Bible said Melchizedek never had a beginning or an ending so Hebrews 7 3 I thank the Lord for the revelation of this message amen Hebrews 7 3 Melchizedek without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor the end of life yeah there it is hat neither having neither beginning of days so here's a man who comes down you're guy come down earth he pulls on all these atoms and puts on a flesh body and the Bible said he never had a beginning hallelujah nor an end of life amen because it's speaking of the life underneath that flesh same thing for you and I praise God same thing for you not the life that's behind this flesh never had a beginning so it will never have an ending hallelujah now here is the scripture beautiful first Timothy 6:15 this proves there's only one type of eternal life and that's God's life first Timothy 6:15 which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and Lord of lords here is who only hath immortality amen see Satan doesn't have immortality right the evil wicked side does not end in mortality but only God has that the Bible said who only hath immortality dwelling in the light because he's an invisible spirit which no man can approach unto whom no man hath seen nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting amen there's a scripture that nails it down only he's the only one with eternal life praise God the way I said there's only one kind of eternal life God has it if we have God we have eternal life in and through him he said see that word eternal or everlasting so when you see that everlasting or eternal he said they can be applied in many various ways but when it applies to God being what he is it has one meeting it is the duration of God you can't apply like that to any other thing God alone is eternal because he lives we live with him praise God now this is familiar to all of us but I want the children to see it here Ephesians 1 verse 4 you might say well brother Jesse you had a beginning so you're not eternal now I would say yes my flesh did have a beginning right but my soul did not as far as the Spirit of God in my soul did not because the Bible said I was in Christ in the mind of God before the foundation of the world this means God's thought about us you and me eternal and if it's God's eternal thought it's a part of God because your thoughts are a part of you right but for us you know we can have bad thoughts and good thoughts well God can if we're in God's thoughts in the Lamb's Book of Life then we we always had eternal life will always have eternal life amen seasons 1 4 according he has chosen us in the church nope in the denomination no yea chosen us in him before the foundation of the world amen that we should be holy and without blame before him in love verse 5 having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself see every Christian is eternal because they are part of the eternal thoughts of God now let me just stop right here and you know brother Branham says interchange book there God had thoughts in other words there are there was some record of all the sinners that will be lost but they were in the section of the Lamb's Book of Life or the book of life but brother may have said there was some record of them somewhere in the records of life because they lived a physical life but they're not in the part of his thoughts that were for eternal life that's a little bit deeper there I said that's about as deep as I go on this subject his brother BAM said there has to be a record of them somewhere because God's infinite and knows all things so he knew the sinner like Judas he knew Judas would live there had been some record of that you know he knew Judas would come he knew he'd be the son of perdition but he wasn't written in the Lamb's Book of Life and that his name was blotted off the book of life so that's about as deep as we go at least right now and as we go on but perhaps the Lord will open up more to us alright now here let's read a scripture all Christians who are born-again already possess eternal life first John 5:11 Lydia can you pull it up here we already possess eternal life we already went read one scripture about that already in 1st John 3 John 1st John is the book of life here 1st John the book of life thank the Lord and is the record that God has given to us what what has he given to us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath WA life must be eternal and he that hath not the son of God hath not life these things have I written unto you that you may that you that believe on the name of the son of God that ye may know that you have you're not guessing an eternal life so you know you have eternal life that you may believe on the name of the Son of God amen John wrote this specifically so we would know we've got eternal life amen but were born again we've got the life of God in us like we said the nature of God within us to always keep us coming back to the Word of God back to the Word of God so see yes Holy Ghost field Saints were in the mind of God before the world was founded a part of the eternal God who had no beginning all right the Bible says let's go to Revelation 13:8 the Bible said the overcomers who overcome the Beast the reason they overcome is because their names were written in the book of life before the foundation of the world so see they were by God's foreknowledge they were placed in this section of it.the the books of life where he knew they'd be overcomers and so that's the record of them revelation 13:8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world amen that's the reason we can't go along with Catholicism or any denomination for that fact amen we can't go along with it because our names are written in the book of life not the book of death the book of life amen revelation 17:8 the Beast sauce was and is not and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into perdition and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is so everybody will wonder what happened to this beast now of course this was in the this was during the time of Imperial Rome okay because this is revelation 17 here I'm sorry no those revelat know this is real yeah I'm sorry revelation 17 no this is the this is the mother heart I'm sorry yeah that's another heart so I got those mixed up there forgive me yeah going into perdition okay yeah that's that's the mother heart I sorry my fault next section unbelievers are destroyed and they have an ending point they have a time when they'll end or cease to exist this is starts off in 2nd Peter 2:12 so Lydia can you pull it up there 2nd Peter 2:12 I'm trying to watch my time because I got to get Steve back to the haven of Refuge the rest here before 6:45 so I gotta watch my time so neither hell nor unbelievers are eternal they have to have an ending now here's a thought - and let me know what you think about this afterwards I'm not even sure if the lake of fire is eternal but I know this the fire is eternal but I don't know if that lake of fire is gonna be eternal sea because once everything's once everything's annihilated there might not need to be a lake anymore because it's all done away with but the Bible said the fire is eternal because that's um it's a manifestation that's where I'm trying to get to that's the manifestation of God's Spirit see since God's Spirit created these things these unbelievers and angels then God's Spirit has to do away with it and the Bible calls it eternal fire so you get a little deeper here by God's grace so there may be a time when the lake of fires not need any more and maybe that fire just go back to the pillar fire and go back and join the other like slick of fire they're up and I bet the throne in the New Jerusalem I don't know because remember you can't limit God God can have the pillar of fire here at the New Jerusalem and then that same pillar more of that pillar fire can now be that that we down there with a lake of fire oh my second peter do trump but these as natural brute beasts look at this the comic look how the Bible describes it made to be taken in destroyed speak evil the things that they understand that and show utterly perish in their own corruption see they're gonna be destroyed they're gonna have an ending point see not tormented eternally but they're gonna be destroyed and done away with Jesus teaches the same thing in Matthew 10:28 let me pull this up here see it's always destroyed bring to an ending point done away with no more Matthew 10:28 let's all read this ready one two three and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell so a body so this is a time where it looks like hell can also mean the lake of fire but we know there's separate things we know you know hell is in the heart of the earth and then the go lake of fire but it looks like sea there's gonna destroy it both soul and the body will be destroyed [Music] Satan will have a time when he no longer exists thank God how many can say amen to that we ought to shout Amen for that as much trouble as he puts us through that old serpent and draggin my filthy devil as much as he puts us through Zico 28:19 let me pull it up they're all they that know the among the people shall be astonished at thee thou shalt be a tear and never shalt thou be any more there comes a time when Satan will no longer be there amen and we get to experience the whole thousand years of it in the Millennium amen no Satan but yet we can live Church just like we're living now can you imagine living a thousand years like we can now no devil no temptation you'll never think one evil thought oh we can go for a couple hours you know without the evil thoughts that we could but my a thousand years of peace no evil thoughts Satan has no longer access to our human minds oh what a honeymoon that'll be praise God I'm gonna get back to that in just minute but let's go to Malachi 4:1 the Bible said they'll be burnt up and they will have no root that means no chance to live right and no branch no fan the branch what produces fruit - which produces more seed so they will they will come to a spot where there's no more reproduction there's no more of them Malachi 4:1 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day and I'm sorry in the day that cometh shall burn them up see burn them up saith the Lord hosts and it shall leave them neither root have roots right if you're gonna live or branch branch produces the seed so see these sinners have none of that go down to verse 3 and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do us do this say it's the Lord of hosts now you want a good millennium scripture here let's go to Isaiah to verse 4 brother Branham quotes us in 1954 here's a good millennium one not going to be able to read the quote for times sake but I'm still on as far as my book of Revelation series I'm still on revelation 20 I kind of pause right there because I want to put in this kingdom of heaven series but I'm gonna go back to that Lord willing I say it to verse 4 oh you got it thank the Lord Legrand says this is the millennium and he shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation shall not lift up sword against nation neither shall they learn war anymore keep that up there hon now did you know do you remember the church age book brother Branham said how important the Millenium was remember that let me pull it up here let me find it real quick I'm just looking I know it's in this note somewhere I like to quote it for you yeah here does see he said the foolish version will miss the millennium which can you can begin and wonderful than we have were believed hey man what's so important about the millennium it's God having his day it's not having the lord's day amen it's God having brother bang his day of rest amen where there's rest for a thousand years but look it's important for you and I to because we finally get to manifest our eternal calling right because we are kings and priests unto God right now spiritual but it's important because the millennium it turns into the natural as well in other words we get to realize brother amen and sister who our purpose on this life in the Millennium we actually become the rulers that God ordained for us to be praise God that's why I says it's more important and wonderful than we never thought or believed and that's why God doesn't let the foolish virgin do it because they can't rule right now amen they can't rule over sin right now they can't rule over the cares of the world right now but we've got to be able to rule over the world because look he judges them among the nations and rebukes him so even though there's no devil there they still got their human spirits I'm talking about the the inhabitants of the earth that grow up so God needs Holy Ghost field Saints with glorified bodies on sorry to rule over this world and it's more important than we ever knew before because God is going to establish this world brother Branham said everything in the Millennium is gonna be just like it is now except there's rulers over there amen God's got judges over there God's got kings and priests over there hallelujah God's got men and women that can rule with the rod of iron amen and it's more I thought see but we'll have that's why I use that illustration and albian I say I was using brother Jim shoemaker I said well Jim you have to stand there the millennium with your rod of iron right and they'll be nations come up and say we want to plant potatoes here no and this one say no we want to plant apples and oranges or we want to build a road here we want to member it all gets burned over it's all started all over we want to build a city here and you and I if we're really holy goes for the Saints wolf there and judge and we'll have to rebuke some people too and say no even though Satan's on here they got the human thought remember there there's just inhabitants of the earth but the man said perhaps God's given the people that never got a chance hear the message perhaps she's giving him chance to hear it now or maybe like I thought maybe it's those aborted souls that never had a chance to live on this earth maybe God will give him a chance to live on this earth that's what I think God is so merciful and loving remember God told Jeremiah before I formed you I knew you and I ordained you a prophet amen remember David's boy died and he said ah he said he'll not come to me but I'll go to him so those souls are somewhere somewhere amen all those aborted souls there were somewhere waiting and I believe God will give him a chance that's what it's just my opinion but see brother Jim and all of us if we're really Holy Ghost field Saints we'll have to stand there and judge between the nation's and brother and said see you'll have such a character of Christ you'll be able to handle any situation that's brought before you the program said they may die over there they may not because the vows that a child will die a hundred years old he said maybe there's so maybe there'll be some accidents maybe people might die but we have to stand there and judge and judge it like Christ would amen see it's more important than we've ever thought I just want to emphasize that tonight before we're gonna close in a few minutes but one emphasize that it's so important to be a part of the millennium because gods kings and priests are get to be manifested physically on this earth and we get to carry out what should have been carried out the Garden of Eden amen oh Christ finger he brings it right back to where it was them at the beginning and how spoken word sons amen will be the spoken words right will be the spoken word sons amen and who knows there may be more - we got all eternity who knows right all right now I'm closing with this not this may be helpful brother Craig taught me this when I first came in the message there's four commonly misunderstood scriptures and let's let's close with this there's just four of them but you got if you look at them and rightly divide them then you can honor they're not saying that torment lasts eternity or eternally so the first ones mark 329 let's go there sorry I'm battling this cold here forgive me mark 329 sorry now this is so often misunderstood but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost has never forgiveness but is in danger of eternal damnation now the word damnation does not mean torment it means separation judgment or decision so it just means they're in danger of eternal decision God's gonna make eternal decision about them and they will have to suffer the danger of that right they'll have to deal with that it doesn't mean torment so see their separation of unbelievers will last eternally they'll be eternally separated from God but not their torment it's just the decision will be eternal in other words God's decree will last eternally because he's a righteous and true judge but their souls will be annihilated or destroyed or done away with as the scripture says they cannot live eternally because they do not possess eternal life mark 943 just next chapter yeah well now notice this is striking but Jesus says this three times in this portion three times in a row that just struck me this week I never really caught that he repeats this three times mark 943 and if thy right hand offend thee cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell into the fire that never shall be quenched where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched now look there's two thoughts on this the first one is the fire see the fire may be eternal because it's God's Spirit in the form of fire right it's not a man-made fire God's not gonna ask you know which one of us are landscapers well oh yeah yeah you burn things guys I got it's gonna be an eternal fire a holy fire and that's the fire that he's talking about this fire will never be quenched in other words it's God's Spirit in the form of a fire cleaning up all of the universe I'll say like that glory recycling and cleaning it up and purging the universe of all evil amen amen so see that's true the fire will never be quenched because that fire like I said once it's done burning up all the souls and the demons maybe it'll go back just to be in the pillar fire hallelujah and where the worm dieth not well this hat this could have two means two it could just mean the worms are gonna live for hundreds of thousands of years or it could mean that the worms do indeed have a form of animal eternal life now now listen they don't have a soul but God may give them a form of eternal life with their animal or insect or whatever spirit they have just like other animals remember the white horses that arm again where they live in that right now where are they they're in heaven right there in the heavenly realms you think they're gonna die I don't think so Jesus's horse is gonna die I doubt that so see all this nature it all goes back to the Garden of Eden and so animals and plants and now the plants in revelation 22 to the Tree of Life will produce fruit every month so plants have a form of eternal life so seeing that scripture has been new to me oh yeah in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was the Tree of Life which bear manner or twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of nations now some people may say this just represents Christ which I wouldn't argue against that it's kind of a mystery to me but it could look like it is a natural tree when brother brown talks about it it talks about actual fruit and leaves healing nations but it could be you know just a figure of Christ just like the tree of life in the Garden of Eden so I just want to keep that in mind and show that to you that this word may have eternal life but it's not in the soul cuz it doesn't have a soul hey man it may just be part of the part of the thoughts of God that were the Garden of Eden that we're gonna last for all eternity two more here yeah two more and we're almost done bear with me here Hebrews six - Lydia Hebrews six - this is the same kind of Scripture as Mark 329 in mark 329 it was a eternal damnation here in Hebrews 6 - its eternal judgment which is the same thing Paul talks about the big the elementary doctrines of Christ their doctrine of baptisms laying on of hands of resurrection Dead and of eternal judgment so see there's an unending decree or sentence against sinners its unending but yet their souls will cease to exist but that judgment will last upon them eternally they'll cease to exist and they'll never come back because they didn't love the Lord Jesus Christ right see God's never gonna change that if they reject his love he's not gonna force them to love them he's gonna give them what they want they don't want to go to heaven so God's gonna let that give them what they want they want to be separated so God is merciful he's gonna let them do that but you and I we don't want to be separate from Christ we want all of Christ we want Christ in us now so that we can be with Christ later amen we want a spirit in us now so that we can be with his body forever amen see never says eternal torture or eternal torment never says that God's righteous judgment about each person's destiny will be upheld for eternity unbelievers though will cease to exist at some point and will never live again proving God's judgment is eternal last one Jude 1:7 Jude 1:7 here's what I was saying earlier the fires eternal Saints hallelujah thank the Lord Jude 1:7 even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them in like manner giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh are set forth an example suffering the Vengeance of what eternal fire now this scripture needs to be understood because in Genesis 19 silent gomorrah suffered the Vengeance of eternal fire in other words the Vengeance of the Spirit of God so historically speaking sodom and gomorrah stop burning shortly after it was destruction right maybe it was a few days maybe hours right but the Bible said and it's not burning today right you can go to that area and I think some people have found places that look like Sodom and Gomorrah I've seen a few videos on YouTube but you know who knows I haven't been there I haven't seen myself you can't believe everything you see on YouTube but it's not burning today so the eternal fire it was God's Spirit that sparked that fire can I say like that God's Spirit started the fire and then God's Spirit must have left off of there and left some natural fire because God's one who started the spark of that fire so again eternal fire refers to the fiery manifestation of God's presence just like the pillar fire amen the same type of thing it's an eternal fire remember God dwells in the light God dwells in the fire praise God just like Mark 943 speaks of the fire that shall never be quenched and remember Hebrews says our God is a consuming fire hey man mess in our feet and he manifests as a holy fire to display his holiness and power fire stands what symbolizes purification right purging purity and so an eternal fire came down started the fire Saudi Gomorrah left left a natural fire but then that fires coming back praise God and that same fire will be used in the lake of fire to burn up and do away with all the evil all the sin for that fire still eternal so we got to go back that shouldn't stumble any of us you know we know how this appeared of God moves right changing just changes form it's the same God just change his mask all the time now is that helpful by God's grace hopefully I was a blessing to you I tried to add some extra scripts and things I'm just looking at my notes here anything else I wanted a I'll be that's it by God's grace okay that's it oh praise God so how many can see how God's mercy is great now God's mercy is great God's not gonna punish people without n for all eternity and God's emphasizing the power of eternal life it's a literal person that you and I can receive right now we can receive today and with that life will never die the soul will never die amen it'll never be separated from the Friends of Christ amen all right musicians let's come here let's worship the Lord praise God what a
