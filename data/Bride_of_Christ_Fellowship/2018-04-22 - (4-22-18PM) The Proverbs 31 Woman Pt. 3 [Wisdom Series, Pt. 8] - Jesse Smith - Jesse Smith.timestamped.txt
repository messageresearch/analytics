[35:15] take Gracie let's take our Bibles this
[35:32] evening let's go back to proverbs 31 I
[35:34] imagine I'm just feeling led there to go
[35:36] that direction finish up there by the
[35:39] grace of the Lord Robert chapter 31 I
[35:41] start at verse 13 let's continue with
[35:47] this thought of the proverbs 31 woman
[36:01] proverbs 31 verse 13
[36:12] for their say Amen verse 13
[36:15] she seeketh wool and flax and worketh
[36:18] willingly with her hands she's like the
[36:21] merchants ships she bringeth her food
[36:24] from afar she Rises also wild as yet
[36:28] night and giveth meat to her household
[36:29] and a portion to her maidens she
[36:32] considers a field and buy a fit with the
[36:35] fruit of her hand she planted the
[36:37] vineyard
[36:37] she girder loins with strength and
[36:40] strengtheneth her arms she perceived as
[36:45] her merchandise is good her candle goeth
[36:47] not out by night she layeth her hands to
[36:51] the spindle and her hands hold the
[36:53] distaff she stretches out her hand to
[36:57] the poor yay she reaches forth her hands
[36:59] to the needy amen that's the portion I'm
[37:03] hoping to get through tonight by God's
[37:04] grace let's have our heads for a word of
[37:06] Prayer if you have need on your hearts
[37:08] make it on into God here tonight as we
[37:10] approach communion Heavenly Father Lord
[37:12] you see the hands Lord my hands up to
[37:14] Lord God we're so grateful for your
[37:17] presence and for your word we're
[37:19] grateful for every soul that's gathered
[37:20] here to hear the Word of God Lord we
[37:23] know your prophet teaches Lord that
[37:24] communion is a showdown Lord and we know
[37:27] those saints who have gathered Lord they
[37:30] consider it a showdown Lord they want to
[37:32] be right with you they want to be
[37:34] examined according to thy word Lord they
[37:36] want to be clean in thy sight Lord God
[37:38] and I pray you'd bless them Lord that's
[37:41] your spirit Lord minister to them Lord
[37:43] God we're grateful that you're our
[37:45] friend that you chose us to be your
[37:47] friend
[37:48] not only your friend but your spouse
[37:50] Lord what a privilege what an honor Lord
[37:53] we don't take it lightly Lord God we
[37:55] come here Lord soberly in the fear of
[37:57] God we ask that you speak to us here
[37:59] tonight bless every heart and soul
[38:01] gathered Lord in our mit's Lord and
[38:04] father may we feel your presence in
[38:06] Jesus Christ name everybody said amen
[38:08] god bless you being seated praise the
[38:10] Lord so let's look at this is part three
[38:17] of the proverbs 31 woman here and like I
[38:20] said we'll try to go as far as we can
[38:23] with this thought here by the grace of
[38:25] the Lord
[38:27] you know I'm polling from numerous
[38:30] commentaries here and just to kind of
[38:33] give us some context to the background
[38:35] you know the economic background of
[38:37] Israel so I think it'll it'll help you
[38:39] up by the grace of the Lord so well we
[38:44] did our text from this morn that was
[38:46] this morning's text was the two
[38:48] foundations of a proverbs 31 woman she
[38:51] fears the Lord first she has a great
[38:53] hatred for evil and she departs from
[38:57] evil and then after that she only does
[39:00] good to her husband all the days of her
[39:01] life now as we begin this section like I
[39:04] said I'm only trying to get to verse 20
[39:06] tonight but it goes all the way to 27 we
[39:09] see the freedom a godly woman has of
[39:13] exercising her gifts within these two
[39:15] boundaries so she has to fear the Lord
[39:19] and then she has to do good to her
[39:22] husband all the days of her life and
[39:23] within these we'd say bookends she has
[39:26] much freedom to exercise her gifts that
[39:30] God has given her and remember that just
[39:34] to encourage all of our sisters but also
[39:35] everyone this whole chapter is about the
[39:39] scope or potential or growth over time
[39:44] so we want to keep that in mind here and
[39:48] remember this kind of woman is rare so
[39:49] for a woman to accomplish this in an
[39:51] entire life would be a very rare thing
[39:54] amen
[39:55] but this is what we should strive for
[39:57] while honoring our to life boundaries
[40:00] right fearing God and then doing good to
[40:04] your husband all the days of his life
[40:06] this is what our sisters should strive
[40:08] for and I believe we can see the
[40:09] spiritual aspect of it as well so again
[40:15] potential or growth over time how many
[40:19] can see growth over time in their lives
[40:21] maybe things you couldn't do when you
[40:23] were younger you know I thought I could
[40:24] never do that you know I don't know how
[40:27] I could ever handle that but yet God has
[40:29] given you the grace to handle it the
[40:32] grace to do things you never thought you
[40:34] were possible before I never thought
[40:36] it'd be possible to song lead preach
[40:39] be deacon trustee treasurer pastor
[40:41] Sunday school teacher I never thought I
[40:43] could do all that so I know God and be a
[40:46] husband and a father to six children I
[40:48] never thought I could do that so and
[40:49] teach as well so I never thought that
[40:53] was possible but God keeps expanding our
[40:56] boundaries and we by wisdom try to
[40:59] balance everything let's look at verse
[41:01] 13 and 14 like I said we'll just go
[41:03] verse by verse and I set my timer and a
[41:05] half-hour cuz if I can do a half-hour
[41:07] and feel pretty good and you'd all be
[41:09] shocked but but we're gonna try to do it
[41:13] by God's grace I really want to wear
[41:14] myself back I can't I got I got like I
[41:17] went to bed at like 3 a.m. last Sunday
[41:19] you know because of the the rain and
[41:20] everything and I've just been worn out
[41:21] all week so I really got to have wisdom
[41:23] proverbs 31 13 now she seeketh wool flax
[41:30] and works willingly with her hands now
[41:35] it doesn't say she's she is a merchant
[41:38] ship but she's like a merchant ship ok
[41:42] and she bringeth her food from afar so
[41:47] she seeks out wool flax to work with her
[41:50] hands now if you know the scripture and
[41:52] Deuteronomy flax is used to make linen
[41:54] and of course linen makes garments
[41:57] really nice clothes you know like the
[41:59] Bible said clean and white linen
[42:01] garments would have been the highest
[42:03] quality of garments you could have
[42:04] especially clean and white but we know
[42:07] purple would have been very valuable as
[42:09] well it's hard to get purple garments
[42:11] but we know white represents purity
[42:12] righteousness right and she acts like a
[42:18] merchant right because not all women
[42:21] could operate a business or God's not
[42:24] calling all women to be entrepreneurs of
[42:27] their own business God's not doing that
[42:28] but she acts like that this proverbs 31
[42:32] woman like she takes upon the
[42:34] responsibility of a business in a way
[42:38] and she like here's Adam Clarke says she
[42:41] acts like merchants which is if she buys
[42:45] anything for a household
[42:46] she sells sufficient of her own
[42:49] manufacturers to pay for it
[42:52] in other words she's going to be able to
[42:54] afford everything she buys and we saw
[42:57] that this morning to her husband can
[42:59] trust her with the resources that he's
[43:01] given to her and Christ can trust you
[43:04] and I with the word aim ahead oh there
[43:07] yeah so in this case if she imports
[43:11] things I'm sorry in ports things and she
[43:14] also exports so it's gonna work both
[43:16] ways she's gonna be diligent with her
[43:19] with her giving and taking and then she
[43:22] sends articles of her own manufacturing
[43:25] or produce to distant countries so she's
[43:28] able to sell to others
[43:29] so she's producing things if she needs
[43:32] something she's able to get it and she
[43:34] pays for by what she produces remember
[43:37] this is this is a potential now a woman
[43:40] can grow to this and she can be very
[43:43] prosperous with natural things and then
[43:48] she traffic's with neighboring tribes or
[43:51] communities so let's so far that's quite
[43:55] a trying to look at a woman now so so
[43:58] far let's just build what we talked
[43:59] about this morning so she's faithful
[44:01] with resources and trustworthy to her
[44:04] husband his remember she does good to
[44:06] her husband she tries to do something
[44:08] good to help her husband's vision right
[44:11] that's why she does this that's why she
[44:14] would try to make a profit or or try to
[44:18] have a good business she would do that
[44:20] for the good of her husband and in this
[44:24] case like we seen in verse 13 she takes
[44:26] initiative the Bible said she seeks it
[44:29] out she's not waiting for this to happen
[44:31] she realizes well if I'm gonna be a
[44:34] blessing here to my husband I've got to
[44:36] take initiative right brother Branham
[44:39] says there's a proverb that says God
[44:41] only helps those who help themselves in
[44:42] romance that's a bad proverb that's not
[44:46] a good proverb brother have said god
[44:48] only helps those who cannot help
[44:50] themselves so this woman here she can
[44:53] help herself and she knows this business
[44:56] venture here falls under the permission
[45:00] of her husband the the wisdom of her
[45:02] husband the the vision of her husband
[45:04] and so snowing
[45:05] she gets permission from her husband
[45:07] she's able to bring in wool and flax and
[45:10] and make some linen here some clothes
[45:12] and then she knows if she orders
[45:15] something from afar she know she can pay
[45:18] for it amen
[45:20] and then she's able you know to produce
[45:21] maybe something sells something she's
[45:24] able to cover it to cover the costs and
[45:27] she buys and sells wisely like a
[45:30] merchant amen
[45:32] I know about all the brothers but my
[45:34] wife's much better financially than I am
[45:36] so I can say amen to that you know much
[45:40] better by with buying and selling and
[45:44] we'll see that later on it's gonna come
[45:45] later on in verse 16 but let's look at
[45:47] verse 15 she rises also wild as yet
[45:51] night and she giveth meat to her
[45:55] household and a portion to her maidens
[46:01] so she rises from bed early and during
[46:05] the night how many brothers get to sleep
[46:07] while your wife has to get up and help
[46:09] the six children at night that's me I
[46:11] usually sleep and my wife gets up and
[46:13] helps or if they have an accident or you
[46:15] know somebody's sick at night or
[46:17] something like that who rises at night
[46:19] my wife does most the time unless I'm
[46:22] already up and now in this case we would
[46:25] say for our natural language she packs
[46:27] the lunch she prepares for the day she's
[46:31] an economist of time and when the nights
[46:33] are long the days are short her family
[46:35] not only spent a part of the evening
[46:37] after sunset after the after the Sun
[46:40] Goes Down they they labor around the
[46:43] home they also rise before daylight and
[46:45] prepare the day's food that they may not
[46:48] have their labor interrupted so if you
[46:52] know they had they were agricultural
[46:53] society so the workers had to go out to
[46:56] the fields well if the mother or the the
[46:59] wife didn't rise and repair the food
[47:01] then they'd have to come back in from
[47:02] the fields right it kind of wastes some
[47:04] time but if she can prepare their meals
[47:06] beforehand that would make the most
[47:08] efficient use of the day the hours of
[47:11] the day and so this is the kind of a
[47:14] woman she she wanted to really be
[47:16] efficient with time so she'd rise
[47:19] earlier
[47:19] late to prepare meat for her her workers
[47:23] remember this is special kind of woman
[47:25] she's got servants or lots of children
[47:28] that go do a lot of work for I can see
[47:31] how can't you see how that the mother of
[47:33] a king would give her son this wisdom
[47:35] you know if your wife's in charge of all
[47:37] these servants or all these you know all
[47:40] these children and they go work out in
[47:42] the fields see how this is see how this
[47:44] is a a verse for scope you know a long
[47:47] term and even even cultural for the
[47:51] culture of a queen right the wife of a
[47:56] king who would have servants who would
[47:58] have the servants go out into the field
[48:01] and they work all day so see we have to
[48:04] consider this this is a rare woman and
[48:06] she's in an interesting situation may be
[48:09] a situation you and I can't relate to we
[48:12] don't have any servants at our house I
[48:13] don't know about you we don't have any
[48:14] paid servants or anybody that lives with
[48:17] us or they're indebted to us so they
[48:18] have to do all of our work for us we're
[48:21] not in that society but the point is and
[48:25] this is a point later coming later on if
[48:27] she is the wife of a king she doesn't
[48:30] have to do all this work but she chooses
[48:33] to do it to make sure it's done right
[48:37] she could easily sit back and say oh
[48:40] that's somebody else do that because
[48:42] she's the she's the wife of a king she's
[48:46] got servants she well let another
[48:47] servant you know let a householder do
[48:50] that let somebody else do it but she is
[48:52] right there active in the home and in in
[48:55] all the affairs of the home to make sure
[48:58] it goes right she doesn't sit back and
[49:01] take the easy road she's not lazy
[49:03] she's right there working to make sure
[49:04] everything goes in order amen so she
[49:12] gives their necessary food she knows
[49:14] they're gonna be out there laboring so
[49:15] she wants to provide for them make sure
[49:16] they're well taken care of my mom always
[49:20] packed lunch for me you know and all my
[49:21] brothers in high school so we'd have six
[49:24] brown paper bags fill with food until we
[49:28] got to a big where she couldn't afford
[49:30] the food for all of us then we started
[49:32] getting free lunches because we were
[49:33] so poor but always on the bottom so you
[49:35] take a big purple I can still see to
[49:37] this day a big purple permanent marker
[49:39] and say I love you son
[49:41] she write it on the back and I just one
[49:43] way to remind me of this you know and
[49:45] all my friends would make fun of me and
[49:47] I try to you know hide that or you're a
[49:50] great son Jesse you know hug the bottom
[49:51] of um but with six kids you were tried
[49:59] to you know make the the food go as far
[50:02] as it could go and I look back now I
[50:04] thought what a sweet mom I didn't like
[50:07] and then but I like it now so now when I
[50:09] see my children you know in school at
[50:11] the table and I see they get letters
[50:12] from their parents I said you need to
[50:14] thank your mom for that little you know
[50:15] they write on the napkin hope you have a
[50:17] great day love ya you know I'm thinking
[50:20] about you I think oh what a sweet what a
[50:22] sweet mom and so this is kind of what we
[50:24] see the proverbs 31 woman she gets up a
[50:26] little early to make sure everybody in
[50:28] the house is fed I like that because she
[50:32] cares they met there's another thought
[50:35] he gives to the women who are to be
[50:37] employed within the house she gives
[50:40] tasks to so they have tasks you can see
[50:43] that they're a portion you see that with
[50:45] portions here and the kind of work
[50:48] they're to do the materials out of which
[50:51] they are to form it and the quantity she
[50:54] expects from each that's the portion so
[50:57] yet meet and then you had portions so
[51:00] Adam Clark is pulling on this portion
[51:02] word as not necessarily food but but
[51:07] your job for the day the portion of your
[51:10] work thus all the servants are settled
[51:13] so here she's got servants and their
[51:16] food work and tasks are appointed
[51:18] everything is done orderly in other
[51:21] words every every member of the
[51:23] household has what they need to do their
[51:25] job for the day now see we we you know
[51:30] we got to realize how humble this
[51:32] proverbs 31 woman is she just staying in
[51:34] her place she fears God so much she she
[51:38] wants all the evil out of her home and
[51:40] she loves her husband so much that she
[51:42] knows the best things you can do is keep
[51:44] her house in order that everybody do
[51:46] their job too
[51:47] keep our home moving in the right
[51:49] direction so sometimes you know like as
[51:54] we're gonna see her scope can go really
[51:56] really big like with buying things and
[51:59] being an entrepreneur we're gonna see
[52:01] her scope you know really big but we
[52:02] can't also neglect these little things
[52:04] because we know we can be faithful in
[52:06] these little things we know we've got to
[52:09] be and we might not be at the spot where
[52:11] we can look at a field and go buy it
[52:13] yeah we're gonna get to that next we
[52:15] might not be at that spot for our
[52:16] sisters or you know whoever this as you
[52:18] apply it to yourself but what we see as
[52:23] a job we can do today let's be faithful
[52:25] with that amen so now we add to our list
[52:28] so now she serves her family at all
[52:31] hours aren't you glad for the mothers
[52:32] who serve at all hours I remember many
[52:35] times laying on the couch I was sick and
[52:38] my mom would bring me a wet washcloth
[52:40] because I was so hot burning up with
[52:42] fever and she just laid on my forehead
[52:44] and I was just crying I'm feeling so
[52:45] sick but if that's all she did but it
[52:48] meant so much to me you know growing up
[52:50] because everybody else was sleeping but
[52:52] my mom stayed up to help me out rising
[52:55] and I am getting me now she would she
[52:57] would water down spry and she said that
[52:58] this will make you better I don't think
[53:01] it was a very good medicine but that was
[53:03] there that was how she was raised oh
[53:05] you're sick just water down some sprite
[53:07] and drink some high-fructose corn syrup
[53:09] you know you know she just did the best
[53:12] she could now no doubt many of her
[53:14] things she did help me out she got the
[53:15] medicine and but the point is she was up
[53:19] with me late at night my dad wasn't you
[53:22] know my mom was you know so thank God
[53:24] for a faithful mother and as we saw she
[53:28] plans and prepares the work so that it's
[53:33] not interrupted so whatever they can
[53:35] accomplish that day it's the most wise
[53:37] use wisely as the most wise use of their
[53:40] time their time is not wasted in other
[53:42] words all right let's read verse 16 and
[53:45] 17 what a picture what a picture of a
[53:48] proverbs 31 woman here's where ever see
[53:53] this might be later on in life because I
[53:55] don't think I've ever done this
[53:57] but here a woman has the ability within
[54:01] fearing God and loving her husband too
[54:05] right now here do some entrepreneurial
[54:07] work here
[54:08] verse 16 she considers a field so she's
[54:12] watching the prices this kind of reminds
[54:14] me of sister Karen how she was watching
[54:15] the prices of our church buildings she's
[54:18] watching she's considering why what if
[54:20] the church could go here go there I
[54:22] appreciate that
[54:24] she considers a field you know she's
[54:26] planning ahead and buys it and with the
[54:30] fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard
[54:35] let's just slow down a little bit she
[54:38] was thinking about this field I might
[54:40] need this feel like we need some more
[54:41] food we need we're gonna need some more
[54:44] crops I may consider you know husband
[54:47] what do you think I may consider buying
[54:49] that field well who's gonna work it
[54:51] honey I am I'm gonna work this field I'm
[54:55] gonna go work out in the hot Sun and I'm
[54:59] gonna break up the fallow grounds right
[55:01] and I'm gonna plant and this is gonna
[55:04] bring forth a harvest bring forth fruit
[55:06] who's gonna do it
[55:07] you're I'm gonna do it so see this is a
[55:10] woman in a special stage of life how
[55:13] many sisters think like you could go do
[55:14] that tomorrow buy a field and go till
[55:17] the till up the land anybody feel like
[55:18] doing that any of the sisters out there
[55:22] sure I love to break out the hoe and the
[55:27] rakes and let's get this let's level
[55:29] this ground off you know this is the
[55:33] embodiment of wisdom and I like how in
[55:37] the next one I like these next thoughts
[55:39] look at these thoughts here I'm sorry I
[55:41] never read 17 she guards her loins with
[55:45] strength so remember to gird their loins
[55:47] was to be ready to work so she make you
[55:51] just her skirts there she's ready to
[55:53] work and then she strengthens her arms
[55:58] so you get the picture of that you know
[56:00] she's ready to work she considers a
[56:04] feeling for fruitfulness
[56:06] she's business mind and I like what
[56:08] Holman says it requires tremendous
[56:11] strength to earn the extra money to buy
[56:14] a vineyard and then clear of stones
[56:18] plant the vines dig a winepress and
[56:23] build a tower to protect it I mean this
[56:28] was not a small endeavor this was going
[56:32] to be a labor of love this was going to
[56:36] be a long-term cause when you plant if
[56:38] this is a vineyard like with grapes this
[56:40] is going to be years in the making so if
[56:46] you're in that phase of life God could
[56:49] lead you to do that and I like the next
[56:51] thought like what Adam Clarke says she
[56:53] provides for the growing wants of her
[56:56] family she realizes we are going to
[56:58] outgrow our garden pretty soon we need
[57:01] some more food so more land will shortly
[57:05] be needed for the family's growing up
[57:08] and having seen a field contiguous to
[57:13] her own which was on sale she estimates
[57:15] it's worse as members she considers it
[57:17] how much is this worth how much fruit
[57:19] can it yield me and purchase it of a
[57:22] good bargain and she pays for by the
[57:25] fruit of her own industry well darling
[57:27] how do you plan to pay for this well I
[57:29] bet I've had some other business
[57:31] ventures here I know in a few years when
[57:34] we get the we sell the fruits and then
[57:37] we'll have enough money to pay this off
[57:39] I'll take out a loan and and this will
[57:41] be so fruitful to have so much money
[57:43] here each month we'll be able to pay it
[57:45] off my what a striking look at a
[57:50] proverbs 31 woman so now we see
[57:58] she's been business-minded she foresees
[58:01] prosperity oh I can make a profit here
[58:04] and I'm going to need to make a profit
[58:06] here in order to provide for my family
[58:08] and she does all this with the guidance
[58:12] of course an approval of her husband she
[58:14] does this for the good of her husband
[58:16] because member the Bible says really
[58:17] those arrows are in his quiver you
[58:21] understand like the husband's
[58:22] responsible for the children's ever to
[58:24] understand he's the head of the home now
[58:27] of course she pours into them you know
[58:28] the why but the Bible said they're his
[58:31] arrows so these children are gonna
[58:34] reflect the leadership God gives to the
[58:36] man so she does this for his children
[58:42] now to no doubt they're her children too
[58:45] but God places the father above them and
[58:49] so she she's healthy and physically fit
[58:52] she's hurting up her loins she's ready -
[58:55] right right go out there and pull some
[58:57] stones out of the ground
[58:59] strengthens her arms you know she's
[59:01] gonna be right there so see this is it's
[59:03] gonna be for 85 year-old woman so see
[59:07] this yet that we have to understand this
[59:09] and not be overwhelmed like oh I've got
[59:12] to do this right now
[59:12] if I don't do this I'm not the proverbs
[59:14] 31 woman we've got to look at this as
[59:16] growth over time this is times and
[59:18] seasoned God's makes all things
[59:20] beautiful in his time we must not let it
[59:23] overwhelm us but see what God may be
[59:26] leading us to do remember God looks at
[59:29] the beauty of one life he he looks at
[59:32] all the seasons of life and he wants to
[59:34] express his beauty in each stage of life
[59:36] well I've got young children the home
[59:38] this is the time I've got to get up
[59:40] early or I've got to be willing to stay
[59:42] up late in the night and as they get
[59:43] older then you can move into different
[59:45] phase of your life and each phase has a
[59:47] particular glory each season has a
[59:50] particular Glee for your life amen I'm
[59:55] not gonna ask the sisters to raise their
[59:57] hands over the brothers but how many of
[59:58] you can see some of these in your life
[1:00:00] already come to pass
[1:00:01] you've already stepped into some of
[1:00:04] these this is what Christ this is the
[1:00:07] embodiment of wisdom not sitting back
[1:00:09] and waiting for something good to happen
[1:00:11] come on
[1:00:12] lord knew something for me bless me Lord
[1:00:13] bless me but using the wisdom the Lord's
[1:00:16] given you and the gifts God's given you
[1:00:20] to help solve the problems of life amen
[1:00:23] now some free I listened to a sermon
[1:00:26] from a I think he was a Presbyterian
[1:00:28] preacher I was just over this I've been
[1:00:30] listening to sermons for weeks on the
[1:00:31] book of Proverbs you know I've gone
[1:00:34] through every time brother Branham said
[1:00:35] the word proverb I've gone through every
[1:00:37] one of those but I listened to one
[1:00:39] sermon in particular and he has
[1:00:41] different you know insights which you
[1:00:43] know some of these might some of these
[1:00:44] might work you know like he looks at
[1:00:46] verse 13 where she works with her hands
[1:00:48] he says well she has joy and work which
[1:00:50] I could see that you know but we ought
[1:00:52] out we ought to have joy in our work
[1:00:54] because we work as into the Lord not
[1:00:57] unto man I enjoy going to school I enjoy
[1:01:00] seeing the children and learn I enjoy
[1:01:02] helping them you know have better
[1:01:05] behavior you know I love Joy's helping
[1:01:07] them learn math and learn how to read
[1:01:09] and comprehend I I enjoy those things we
[1:01:12] should have joy and I'll work now verse
[1:01:15] 14 is a little interesting I never
[1:01:16] looked at like this but the one preacher
[1:01:19] said she is very creative a proverbs 31
[1:01:23] woman is very creative bringing food
[1:01:26] from afar she brings variety or
[1:01:29] freshness to life I thought that was
[1:01:30] interesting because she brings things
[1:01:33] from out of the country into the country
[1:01:35] and you wouldn't have these unless you
[1:01:38] exported them I'm sorry imported them
[1:01:41] and I thought that would written that's
[1:01:42] really interesting you know life would
[1:01:44] be dull without her she brings things
[1:01:47] that would really wouldn't be there all
[1:01:48] the time she brings life into the
[1:01:51] dullness of life and I like this he said
[1:01:55] men can build a house but a woman builds
[1:01:57] the home in other words the the love
[1:02:00] inside the home or the feeling of a home
[1:02:02] only a woman can do that she brings it
[1:02:06] in and I think I'll just give an example
[1:02:10] of my wife you know over and over in the
[1:02:12] fellowship room you know last year I had
[1:02:14] it had the tables laid out a different
[1:02:16] way and it was fine for me but my wife's
[1:02:20] like you know honey I'm just gonna
[1:02:21] rearrange those one time or I thought
[1:02:23] praise the Lord
[1:02:25] walked in there and and then now it's in
[1:02:26] the state is in and I love how it is now
[1:02:28] it was way better than the way I had it
[1:02:30] and I just thought my that's just given
[1:02:32] her that creativity and something and
[1:02:36] now it feels like a fellowship room to
[1:02:38] me I don't know maybe you don't feel
[1:02:39] that way but that's how I feel I feel
[1:02:41] just real nice and comfortable that room
[1:02:43] because it's got a woman's touch you
[1:02:45] know and I still told my wife I said at
[1:02:49] some point you know when we got the
[1:02:50] funds for the church I want to have her
[1:02:52] other sisters who like just to decorate
[1:02:54] the church I did all the decoration you
[1:02:59] know I just I don't know I feel like the
[1:03:01] girls could the sisters could do better
[1:03:03] you know but I just saw those signs you
[1:03:05] know family and prayer and Jesus I
[1:03:07] thought my wife might have seen those
[1:03:09] actually but you know I'm talking about
[1:03:10] the touch that a sister has amen just
[1:03:14] her her she makes it feel like a place
[1:03:17] you want to be amen
[1:03:20] and then you know the preacher was
[1:03:24] mentioning how she's disciplined she's
[1:03:26] physically strong and she's got a desire
[1:03:28] for enterprise you know for business and
[1:03:31] he you know he mentioned that in verses
[1:03:34] 15 through 17 and I thought those are
[1:03:37] some you know those are those different
[1:03:38] words we might use to describe some of
[1:03:40] the characteristics we're seeing that we
[1:03:43] already mentioned all right let's look
[1:03:45] at look at verse 18 here I like this
[1:03:51] here I like this she perceives that her
[1:03:54] merchandise is good and her candle goeth
[1:03:57] not out by night I like what Clark says
[1:04:04] he says she takes care to manufacture
[1:04:05] the best articles of the kind so
[1:04:08] whatever she manufactures it's going to
[1:04:10] be the best and to lay on a reasonable
[1:04:13] price that she may secure already sale
[1:04:15] her goods are in high repute and she
[1:04:18] knows she can sell as much as she can
[1:04:21] make and she finds that while she
[1:04:23] pleases her customers her and she
[1:04:25] increases her own profits I like that so
[1:04:28] she knows she's selling a good product
[1:04:30] and doesn't the church know that too
[1:04:32] we're selling the best thing there is
[1:04:34] the word of God the message of the hour
[1:04:37] amen
[1:04:38] because it is the word it's the pure
[1:04:40] unadulterated Word of God I know there's
[1:04:44] not many buyers out there but I'm sure
[1:04:46] glad to sell it anyway
[1:04:48] and I'll wait until we find some buyers
[1:04:50] by the grace of the Lord but that's
[1:04:52] since she is business minded or in this
[1:04:55] stage of her life she wants the best
[1:04:57] products my dad always told me you get
[1:05:00] what you pay for son you don't buy
[1:05:03] something good it's not gonna be buy
[1:05:04] junk he says you're gonna get junk and
[1:05:06] that's been true my whole life no doubt
[1:05:09] about that
[1:05:10] and she her candle goeth not out by
[1:05:14] night she's watchful she's careful her
[1:05:19] lamp burns all night which is of great
[1:05:21] advantage in the case of sudden alarms
[1:05:22] can you imagine in those days without
[1:05:24] electricity we can just flip on a light
[1:05:26] but can you imagine them stumbling
[1:05:29] around in the dark for an oil lamp and
[1:05:32] then to get a match and light that I
[1:05:34] mean spilling potentially spilling oil
[1:05:37] fire you know that's not a good picture
[1:05:39] so she had to leave a light on somewhere
[1:05:42] all night and be ready we just can turn
[1:05:45] on a light or we I got my phone I just
[1:05:47] slide it up and turn on the flashlight I
[1:05:48] walk around and where's my where's my
[1:05:50] clothes for the day or what's going on
[1:05:52] here well she had to keep a light
[1:05:54] burning she was always ready always
[1:05:56] ready at any emergency to be up at Adam
[1:06:00] Wow and in times and places where there
[1:06:04] were so many bandits or robbers this was
[1:06:07] a very necessary family regulation
[1:06:10] perhaps some works were carried on
[1:06:12] during the night those employed sleeping
[1:06:15] in the daytime thus labor never stood
[1:06:16] still while some slept others worked
[1:06:19] this was no unusual thing in ancient
[1:06:21] times and it prevails now an especially
[1:06:24] church if you think about the queen of
[1:06:27] the King and they had a city right with
[1:06:30] walls you would have watchtowers and you
[1:06:34] had to have Watchmen that stayed awake
[1:06:36] all night so you had to be ready to help
[1:06:39] a watchman if they needed food or water
[1:06:42] whatever they needed she was even
[1:06:45] willing to help anyone who worked all
[1:06:47] through the night this is the kind of
[1:06:50] woman that God calls
[1:06:52] a virtuous woman in other words she
[1:06:55] cared about everybody in the kingdom if
[1:06:57] somebody needed something she'd get up
[1:06:59] even at nighttime I'll help out and
[1:07:01] again take into consideration this is a
[1:07:04] certain stage of life right you got to
[1:07:08] take that so I don't know I imagine that
[1:07:10] this stage she might be a little older
[1:07:11] cuz if she's younger she got a nurse the
[1:07:14] children you know take care of the
[1:07:15] children I'd imagine that so see she
[1:07:21] produces high quality merchandise
[1:07:23] how many appreciate a one products
[1:07:25] mother may have said if you do a product
[1:07:27] do a a one job so she was into a one
[1:07:31] products if she was gonna manufacture or
[1:07:35] send something out it's gonna be a high
[1:07:37] quality product
[1:07:38] she's not gonna send out junk to people
[1:07:40] and then she's prepared and alert all
[1:07:43] night or she's just prepared to help out
[1:07:46] anyone in the kingdom in this case our
[1:07:49] case anyone in the home she's able to
[1:07:50] help out
[1:07:54] verse 19 she lent her hands to the
[1:07:59] spindle and her hands hold the distaff I
[1:08:03] like this this is an interesting thought
[1:08:05] - she has a burden to produce thread
[1:08:11] which is interesting so the spindle and
[1:08:15] distaff there's my half-hour so let me
[1:08:17] set it for ten more minutes I'll try to
[1:08:18] finish up 40 minutes that'd be a real
[1:08:20] victory uh are the most ancient of all
[1:08:25] instruments used for spinning or making
[1:08:27] thread so she goes back she's even she's
[1:08:31] so humble she'll go back and use the
[1:08:33] oldest technology she'll go back to the
[1:08:35] ancient ways she's willing to humble
[1:08:37] herself and do whatever's needed to help
[1:08:40] out the family should go use the oldest
[1:08:43] tools she's not so high and gray and and
[1:08:46] mightier than others that she can't go
[1:08:48] humble herself and put her hands on the
[1:08:50] old ways she's in touch with the old
[1:08:54] ways to give me that old-time religion
[1:08:57] i-ight with me cherish that look at the
[1:08:59] spiritual she's able to tap in to the
[1:09:01] old ways amen
[1:09:04] she's not high and lofty she don't need
[1:09:06] something new she can go work with the
[1:09:08] old tools I thought that was pretty neat
[1:09:11] the spinning wheel superseded them in
[1:09:14] the countries but they are still in
[1:09:15] considerable use to spinning machinery
[1:09:17] superseded both them and the spinning
[1:09:19] wheels in general so she was able to
[1:09:21] humble herself to the old ways listen if
[1:09:25] a job needs done even if I got to use
[1:09:27] the old the old tools I'll do it I got
[1:09:30] to make bread the old-fashioned way I'll
[1:09:32] make bread the old-fashioned way I've
[1:09:34] got to wash clothes the old-fashioned
[1:09:35] way
[1:09:36] I'll do that she was willing to fit in
[1:09:39] and do whatever was needed to help out
[1:09:41] the family I like that and I'm just
[1:09:43] looking I'm looking at the spiritual not
[1:09:45] just this word thread kind of went
[1:09:46] through my mind so just bear with me on
[1:09:48] this thought Rahab
[1:09:51] she already had a scarlet thread in her
[1:09:54] house
[1:09:54] and the scarlet thread once outside
[1:09:57] represent the token the baptism of the
[1:10:00] holy ghost
[1:10:01] so she was willing to put her hands to
[1:10:03] the old ways in order to bring about a
[1:10:06] thread in other words she was willing to
[1:10:09] work with the old-time religion and
[1:10:11] bring forth a character that would
[1:10:13] produce the token amen
[1:10:15] so I'm just trying to I'm really
[1:10:16] straighted on that one you understand
[1:10:18] I'm really reaching because that word
[1:10:20] thread was so striking to me and church
[1:10:23] is not just there it's in Song of
[1:10:24] Solomon Solomon says thy lips are like
[1:10:27] threads of scarlet so this this Holy
[1:10:32] Ghost religion this token religion was
[1:10:34] even on her lips she lets she spoke the
[1:10:38] Word of God all the time amen I just I'm
[1:10:41] stretching a little bit but you
[1:10:43] understand what I'm saying she had this
[1:10:44] thread she was willing to go the old
[1:10:47] path to produce this thread and this
[1:10:49] thread on a public display was the token
[1:10:53] amen in other words she was making
[1:10:56] preparations for the token the thread to
[1:10:58] be on display amen
[1:11:01] go back to the old-time ways to see
[1:11:05] again again she works with her hands now
[1:11:08] before it was working with other things
[1:11:10] with wool and linen and so forth like
[1:11:13] that but now she's again able to go work
[1:11:17] with the most ancient of tools she can
[1:11:20] herself to the most ancient of ways if
[1:11:22] she has to I like that now verse 20 this
[1:11:30] is where I ended my notes I may go a
[1:11:32] little bit further we'll see verse 20
[1:11:35] she stretched out her hand to the poor
[1:11:38] she reaches forth her hands to the needy
[1:11:44] now I've mentioned this earlier but she
[1:11:46] stretched her hands to the poor needy
[1:11:49] she's laying up treasures in heaven as
[1:11:52] memorials of alms and maybe fasting we'd
[1:11:55] say because that's what the Bible said
[1:11:57] in acts 10 with Cornelius and when he
[1:11:59] looked on them he was afraid and said
[1:12:01] what is it Lord and he said to him thy
[1:12:03] prayers this is the angel thy prayers
[1:12:05] and that alms are come up for a memorial
[1:12:08] before God I'm gonna preach a whole
[1:12:11] sermon on the poor in the book of
[1:12:13] Proverbs but the book of Proverbs is
[1:12:15] jam-packed with scriptures about the
[1:12:18] poor I mean you can't get through just a
[1:12:21] couple chapters it's always like God is
[1:12:23] for the poor you must help the poor you
[1:12:26] know the wicked oppress the poor and
[1:12:28] it's just it's all through the whole
[1:12:30] book and here at the very end the climax
[1:12:33] of what a wisdom produces we see a woman
[1:12:36] who's able to run a business here or be
[1:12:38] business minded produce and make a
[1:12:40] profit and she doesn't keep all this for
[1:12:43] herself she still remembers those less
[1:12:45] fortunate than her and she's able to
[1:12:49] reach out and say I couldn't help this
[1:12:51] one she reaches out with her hand right
[1:12:54] so someone someone that's close within
[1:12:56] her circle of influence or or her or her
[1:12:59] friends she's able to reach out and she
[1:13:02] reaches out to them let's ask
[1:13:08] to help us to reach out and help
[1:13:09] somebody this week or maybe this month
[1:13:12] how many want to reach out and help
[1:13:14] somebody she stretches forth her hand
[1:13:17] it's gonna take a little effort but it's
[1:13:19] worth it God has blessed me so much I'll
[1:13:21] stretch forth my hand he stretched forth
[1:13:23] his hand to me I'll stretch forth my
[1:13:25] hand at somebody else amen glory I like
[1:13:28] that and in doing that she stores up
[1:13:32] memorials in heaven treasures in heaven
[1:13:35] God will remember when you help the poor
[1:13:39] God will remember when you when you
[1:13:41] stretch forth your hand to others not
[1:13:43] just pulling into myself not just
[1:13:45] receiving receiving receiving but giving
[1:13:48] out to the poor God will remember that
[1:13:51] amen so now we see not only that but she
[1:13:57] takes initiative to help the poor and
[1:13:59] the needy now I got four more minutes so
[1:14:05] let me just I'll do the next one then
[1:14:07] I'll stop I'll just do the next one okay
[1:14:09] just verse 21 I was gonna go 21 to 25 as
[1:14:12] you can see I was gonna go to 25 but
[1:14:14] I'll just stop at 21 so let's just read
[1:14:17] 21 and then we'll have to stop there by
[1:14:20] the grace of the Lord and maokai go and
[1:14:24] switch off here okay because I'm going
[1:14:25] to I don't have any other quotes that
[1:14:27] was the only one I had I was gonna read
[1:14:29] them from my notes so proverbs 31 21 and
[1:14:34] I'm gonna read off my notes here I
[1:14:35] didn't have time to put him on slides
[1:14:37] today verse 21 she is not afraid of the
[1:14:43] snow for her household for all her
[1:14:47] household Arklow with scarlet now
[1:14:51] there's a couple of things we have to
[1:14:52] see in here and let me get there I'm not
[1:14:56] quite there yet okay here we go and this
[1:15:03] is what
[1:15:04] said American Christians bow the most is
[1:15:06] fear how many memory said that fear that
[1:15:09] God won't keep his word American
[1:15:12] Christians battle fears God going to
[1:15:14] provide is God gonna answer prayer is
[1:15:16] God gonna help me in the land of plenty
[1:15:19] we battle fear the most is God gonna
[1:15:22] help me out and that's striking Satan
[1:15:25] does that he turns it around so she does
[1:15:28] not fear so that means she's got faith
[1:15:32] she's got faith despite the snow for her
[1:15:38] household so she does not fear winter
[1:15:42] because she knows her house is clothed
[1:15:45] with scarlet now scarlet is at least a
[1:15:47] double-layered garment so these are
[1:15:49] warmer clothes so she has warmer double
[1:15:53] layered clothes for the wintertime not
[1:15:56] single layer but double layer and she
[1:16:03] has planned ahead and this is what we
[1:16:05] saw earlier remember we saw earlier how
[1:16:07] she Ponder's things and she's thinking
[1:16:09] about what's next she has planned ahead
[1:16:13] to make sure our children are warm in
[1:16:17] the cold seasons and they have
[1:16:20] everything that they need amen
[1:16:26] and I didn't have time to put that one
[1:16:28] up there but how many ever seen your
[1:16:31] wives are seen people plan ahead well we
[1:16:34] got to get ready for winter we got to
[1:16:37] get ready for spring time to get out the
[1:16:39] old get in the new right and this is the
[1:16:43] kind of woman that God was looking for a
[1:16:46] woman who would be ready for hard times
[1:16:49] and we can apply this for even
[1:16:51] spiritually right now sure we think
[1:16:53] naturally oh I've got I've got this bin
[1:16:55] of clothes for winter time I've got to
[1:16:57] get that out I got to start walking I
[1:16:58] know my wife does that all the time we
[1:17:00] got to wash these clothes because they
[1:17:01] sit in the bin all year round but how
[1:17:04] much more for the spiritual winters of
[1:17:07] our life right the church we say the
[1:17:10] woman she's ready for the hard times
[1:17:13] because she's with Christ all the way to
[1:17:15] the end amen
[1:17:17] she's received so much of his word so
[1:17:19] much of his love she's got the seal of
[1:17:21] Christ in her soul to the day of
[1:17:22] redemption she loves God on the
[1:17:25] mountaintops and she loves God in the
[1:17:26] valley it's based upon love it's based
[1:17:30] upon the fear of the Lord and she's
[1:17:34] ready the bride is ready for all seasons
[1:17:36] of life amen
[1:17:38] let's stand to our feet here I'll stop
[1:17:39] right there that was 45 minutes here in
[1:17:42] or 40 minutes that way I hopefully I
[1:17:46] don't hurt myself by trying to go so
[1:17:48] hard so so long
[1:17:50] and let's if you have your Bibles here
[1:17:52] let as we stand let's go to Luke 22 I
[1:17:54] just want to read this for my techs
[1:17:55] tonight for communion Luke 22 verse 13 I
[1:17:59] like to change text every now and then
[1:18:01] kind of back and forth you know from
[1:18:03] first Corinthians 11 let's go to Luke 22
[1:18:05] tonight by the grace of the Lord Luke 22
[1:18:12] 13 now let's before we read us think
[1:18:41] about how this applies to our life are
[1:18:43] we faithful with our resources are we
[1:18:45] trustworthy do we take initiative do we
[1:18:50] buy and sell wisely are we willing to
[1:18:53] serve in any hour of the day are we
[1:18:56] planning and preparing to be most
[1:18:58] efficient in the work of the home and
[1:19:00] work of our lives are we forced seeing
[1:19:03] prosperity how we can be more prosperous
[1:19:05] are we healthy and physically fit to do
[1:19:08] it are we producing high quality
[1:19:11] merchandise are we prepared and alert
[1:19:15] are we willing to humble ourselves and
[1:19:17] work with the most oldest oldest tools
[1:19:20] we'd say are we taking initiative to
[1:19:23] help the poor with our surplus
[1:19:29] this is how we want to examine ourselves
[1:19:30] here tonight by God's grace Luke 22
[1:19:34] verse 13 and they went and found as he
[1:19:41] said unto them and they made ready the
[1:19:43] Passover verse 14 when the hour was come
[1:19:50] he sat down in the twelve apostles with
[1:19:53] him and he said unto them with desire I
[1:19:57] have desired to eat this Passover with
[1:20:00] you before I suffer for I say unto you I
[1:20:06] will not anymore eat thereof until it be
[1:20:09] fulfilled in the kingdom of God can you
[1:20:12] imagine Jesus has had a 2000 years since
[1:20:14] he partook of communion there he's
[1:20:17] waiting until the marriage supper of the
[1:20:19] lamb and he took the cup and gave thanks
[1:20:23] and said take this and divide it amongst
[1:20:26] yourselves for I say unto you I will not
[1:20:28] drink of the fruit of this vine until
[1:20:30] the kingdom of God shall come and he
[1:20:34] took the bread and gave thanks and brake
[1:20:35] and gave unto them saying this is my
[1:20:37] body which is given for you this do and
[1:20:39] remembrance of me likewise also the cup
[1:20:42] after supper saying this cup is the New
[1:20:45] Testament in my blood which is shed for

[1:21:00] moment before we come forward let's take
[1:21:02] a moment let's just examine ourselves in
[1:21:04] light of the the scriptures and the
[1:21:08] preaching that we heard tonight how many

[1:23:49] and you know how to discourage us from
[1:23:51] the wrong things that we do because

[1:23:58] so much care with so much desire for
