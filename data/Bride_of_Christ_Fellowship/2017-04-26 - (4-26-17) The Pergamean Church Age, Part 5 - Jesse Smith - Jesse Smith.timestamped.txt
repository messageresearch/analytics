[33:13] of everything around I hopefully I got
[33:15] juice right now I just as a reminder we
[33:20] do have that assignment he's gonna
[33:21] preach forth twice on Sundays I'm
[33:23] looking forward to that God has blessed
[33:25] his ministry more and more as he's
[33:26] becoming you know just like any gift
[33:28] I've been compared to like a child
[33:30] talking or you let the little baby talk
[33:32] better it's going to get talking all the
[33:34] time we'd only hinder that you know the
[33:36] hundred pieces of God we're looking for
[33:39] - I need to break
[33:40] I'm just tired worn out I try to preach
[33:43] almost every sermon just except for a
[33:45] couple since January January for every
[33:47] March April I did pretty good I feel
[33:50] like God's giving me strength to do
[33:51] that's what I did it by God's grace I
[33:52] really felt like I want to preach these
[33:54] church ages
[33:54] now I'll take a few Sunday break my
[33:57] brother Simon and their brother Brooks
[33:58] so really looking forward to that having
[34:01] these brothers in God's grace all right
[34:04] that's so I'm going to go right to the
[34:06] church age book here so I spend all my
[34:09] time this week I started Sunday night
[34:11] just really got home from church or from
[34:12] charts I took a shower I went downstairs
[34:15] just for a few minutes I started reading
[34:16] the rest of the chapters here this
[34:18] chapter is read at Monday Tuesday and
[34:21] finish the chapter today again by God's
[34:23] grace so the first section here is I
[34:26] know that works in verse 13 so we got a
[34:30] little scripture to read here up Friday
[34:32] to help reading Malachi can you read
[34:34] buddy Lydia Pingree anybody else want to
[34:36] read it but it's used with Malachi first
[34:42] John 3:7 Lydia James 3:11
[34:48] but Adam yurid broken six to that okay
[34:51] anybody else to the replay
[34:54] okay sister bow so what you want to read
[34:56] up Matthew 12:33 so I got first John 3:7
[35:02] Malachi Lydia
[35:05] James 3:11 that in Romans six - it's a
[35:08] stroke Matthew 12 rule program lists all
[35:13] these scriptures as soon as he quotes I
[35:15] know that works so God is telling these
[35:19] Pergamon pergamene church age believers
[35:21] I know your works how we know God is
[35:24] watching your works praise the Lord
[35:26] works don't save you but works prove you
[35:29] are safe that's right just one more
[35:31] proof that you're saying Amen along with
[35:34] of course having an experience like you
[35:35] know the book of Acts fruits of the
[35:37] spirit
[35:38] signing crimes of abominations all these
[35:40] scriptures that apply to our day this is
[35:43] another this is just another angle on
[35:45] you have to have the works of God much
[35:47] do the right works okay so now when we
[35:51] first job three seven little children
[35:54] let no man deceive you he that doeth
[35:57] righteousness is righteous even as he is
[36:00] righteous alright so by man says if you
[36:03] do righteous you are righteous right
[36:05] amen Lydia James 3:11 amends remember
[36:14] Christ is comparing your life to a
[36:16] fountain your fountains bring the two
[36:18] types of water no just one kind of water
[36:20] because all but whatever water is it
[36:22] just it combines into one right whether
[36:24] it's the salty or whether it's fresh
[36:25] it's the only one okay brother Adam how
[36:29] about Romans six you sir
[36:34] god forbid how shall we that are dead to
[36:38] sin live any learner
[36:40] they're in amen thank you we've seen
[36:43] that if you're righteous you live
[36:45] righteous you're a fountain you should
[36:47] bring for sweet water not bitter and
[36:50] then the Bible says if you're dead just
[36:52] sin I gonna live instead of sins dead to
[36:54] you how can you live in that it's dead
[36:56] alright such a boat Matthew 12:33
[37:03] either make the tree good and has pretty
[37:06] good or else make the trooper out in his
[37:08] fruit grow the tree is known by his
[37:10] fruit
[37:10] David so program quotes these these
[37:13] wonderful scriptures praise God no doubt
[37:16] in verse 35 they said a good man
[37:18] the good treasure of a the heart
[37:20] bringeth forth good things an evil man
[37:23] out of the evil treasure bringeth forth
[37:24] evil things praise God
[37:28] so Graham makes this statement here you
[37:31] list all these scriptures it's just a
[37:32] beautiful just a beautiful combination
[37:35] of scriptures and all say if you're a
[37:37] child of God you'll have godly works you
[37:40] will live the right kind of life the RAM
[37:43] said if you are the word he said you
[37:45] will produce the word they met I'm going
[37:48] to read this quote I read a few weeks
[37:49] ago this is beautiful if a man fears
[37:52] that he might not please God let me stop
[37:54] right there anybody ever have that fear
[37:55] sometimes sometimes that comes over me
[37:57] and I please he got enough well dad tell
[38:00] us what to do if we have a fear if you
[38:02] wonder if I'm pleasing God Gomez's then
[38:04] let him fulfill the word so if you're
[38:09] scared am i doing God's will or not he
[38:11] said then act on the word do what the
[38:13] word says if a man wonders if he will
[38:16] hear those words well done good and
[38:18] faithful servant let him fulfill the
[38:21] Word of God in his life
[38:22] and surely he will hear those words of
[38:25] praise I simply Mason I don't want to
[38:29] hear the words put all down to the papal
[38:31] sudden the road Addison look at your
[38:32] life look at the word for your life as a
[38:35] man or woman whatever you are and
[38:36] fulfill that work do that word he says
[38:41] and surely you'll hear those words up
[38:43] praise program calls that phrase God is
[38:46] praising you I know you're worse I know
[38:48] how you're laboring for Christ Christ is
[38:51] praising you amen then real random
[38:55] quotes you know James chapter one if a
[38:57] man wants to know how he is making out
[39:00] let him do as change suggestion look
[39:03] into the mirror of God's Word hallelujah
[39:06] look into the mirror loo and see if you
[39:09] cannot if your reflection matches the
[39:12] word Amen you
[39:13] like the word is this what your life
[39:15] looks like amen
[39:17] all right that's a first highlight guard
[39:19] kind of highlight that put some stars
[39:21] under that I know it's a bridge like
[39:22] whatever the Holy Spirit struck my heart
[39:25] said all my I want to preach that I'm
[39:27] gonna turn the page
[39:28] all right now the holdest fast my day
[39:32] now yeah verse 13 and the holdest fast
[39:37] my name said I didn't preach this yet
[39:39] here's the poem says about holding fast
[39:42] the name he quotes John 6 where it says
[39:45] Peter says to whom can we go now alone
[39:48] has the words of eternal life
[39:51] they held fast then they were holding
[39:55] fast now but not with fatalistic dread
[39:59] as men who lived out barren lives they
[40:02] were holding fast in his strength in the
[40:05] assurance of the Spirit they were one
[40:08] with this theirs was a certian knowledge
[40:11] of sins forgiven and they bore the name
[40:14] of Christian in testimony to it they
[40:18] knew and loved that name that was above
[40:20] every day their knees bow to that date
[40:23] amen their tongues had confessed it
[40:27] whatsoever they did they did it all the
[40:29] name of the Lord Jesus they had named
[40:32] that name and departed from evil and
[40:34] having taken understand they were now
[40:36] prepared to die that for that name being
[40:39] assured of a better resurrection praise
[40:43] God so see their voting fasting the name
[40:45] in the example there are numerous
[40:46] examples but the money game is Peter
[40:49] remember that case there he said Jesus
[40:52] said you must drink of my blood and eat
[40:54] of my flesh and every all the seventy
[40:56] preachers left but he said you want to
[40:59] go to and the disciples said where are
[41:00] we going to go in other words were
[41:02] holding fast to the name of Christ
[41:04] that's what we say today we're holding
[41:06] fast to the name of Christ amen that's
[41:11] what we're gonna mentions their great
[41:13] he said hold fast to the literal name
[41:14] not the titles father son Holy Ghost
[41:16] that's what the next two paragraphs
[41:17] about but we know that all right now now
[41:21] rest is not denied my faith I get ready
[41:24] to turn to acts
[41:25] 3:16 let's go x3 16 x3 16 this is a
[41:30] Horton scripture and just the way he
[41:33] brings it out was just so powerful
[41:35] x3 16 you see where Peter you know
[41:38] program said he saw a vision of this
[41:42] going to be made well and that's
[41:44] why you said such as I have give I
[41:46] believe eyes and walk in the name of
[41:48] Jesus Christ when he poor it points out
[41:51] the red points out verse 16 because
[41:55] jesus said thou has not denied my faith
[41:57] he said you held to my name and you've
[42:00] not denied my faith the program brings a
[42:04] striking thought out of this year 3
[42:07] first 16 months we together ready one
[42:09] two three and his name through faith in
[42:12] his name have been ages and man strong
[42:15] whom you see and know yay
[42:18] the faith which is by him hath given him
[42:21] this perfect soundness in the presence
[42:23] of you all
[42:25] mmmm says see there it is Jesus's name
[42:28] and Jesus's faith brought about the
[42:32] miracle like that it was a Peters
[42:35] neighbor Peters faith it was Jesus's
[42:38] name and Jesus's faith but that faith
[42:41] was in theater
[42:42] hey you then other than a beautiful
[42:45] highlighted words on that page in the
[42:47] three stars I know that's gonna need to
[42:48] preach right there Peter did not claim
[42:52] it was his own human faith anymore that
[42:54] he claimed it was his own name he said
[42:57] it was Jesus's name used in the faith
[43:00] which is from Jesus that performed the
[43:03] great work and then so what does that
[43:05] tell us we need to say God give you your
[43:08] faith to speak something in your name
[43:12] praise God
[43:13] that's what we need we need God's a God
[43:15] we need to see God say Lord reveal
[43:17] something to me that's why our maps are
[43:19] the most important thing to pray for is
[43:20] love guru remembers revelation
[43:23] revelation of the will of God that when
[43:26] you got a revelation you know God's will
[43:28] for something that you can speak God's
[43:30] will in the name of Jesus Christ with
[43:33] the faith of Jesus Christ and no matter
[43:35] what any delusion
[43:37] any neighbor it's going to come to pass
[43:40] if you see it in Jesus name
[43:42] with Jesus's faith because jesus paid
[43:46] Kenneth Bailey met
[43:48] that's a beautiful scripture his they
[43:51] through faith in his name had made the
[43:53] man strong the faith which is by him
[43:56] where'd you get your faith to come to
[43:57] church nah I got from Christ right have
[44:00] given him this perfect soundness in the
[44:03] presence of you all so it's always the
[44:05] faith given from God that overcomes the
[44:09] gates of hell
[44:10] praise God all right holding fast his
[44:14] name that's the one major Orson he
[44:17] brings out here okay let's read a few
[44:25] more see this actually about four
[44:27] scriptures in here okay go to Romans
[44:31] 12:3 actually now I didn't get Romans
[44:34] 12:3
[44:34] and then Lenny did you get fees ins to
[44:39] eight garden but Adam can you get James
[44:42] to 113 maybe say three more scriptures
[44:47] here to build this doctrine I love what
[44:49] the Bible says line upon line precept
[44:52] upon precept that's exactly what program
[44:53] that's exactly what the church age book
[44:55] is it's a thought and then all the
[44:56] precepts building it up okay so back I
[45:01] Romans 12:3 sir
[45:04] right say through the grace given unto
[45:07] me to every man that is among you not to
[45:10] think of himself more highly than he
[45:12] ought to think but to think soberly
[45:14] according as God has dealt to every man
[45:17] the measure of faith amen
[45:19] measure means a portion right so I
[45:22] suffered tonight or breakfast this
[45:24] morning you had a portion of the eggs or
[45:27] you had a portion of the steak we ran a
[45:29] portion of the salad right that's what
[45:32] the Bible said here you have a portion
[45:34] of faith from God you don't have all
[45:36] faith like Jesus head right but you have
[45:39] a portion praise God
[45:41] every man's got it some Paul says
[45:43] everybody that's at the Roman Church has
[45:45] a measure of faith everybody that
[45:46] accurate it's not a measure of faith
[45:48] and Jesus says I'll think about how big
[45:50] your measures Jesus said if it's the
[45:52] size of a mustard seed to move mountain
[45:55] but education did you ask the other day
[45:58] honey mind that bag of the mustard seed
[46:00] just daddy why you got this bag of
[46:02] mustard seeds I said it reminds me just
[46:04] one of those little CDs is all I need
[46:06] that's all the faith I need to move a
[46:08] mountain
[46:09] now I already believe they got the faith
[46:10] of Christ amen you got that much faith
[46:13] absolutely just looking for the timing
[46:16] of God to use it amen use it against
[46:18] sickness
[46:19] I was listening just a brother yesterday
[46:21] brother I'm saying he said Satan keep
[46:24] giving me a cold and I keep giving it
[46:25] back
[46:26] he said he keeps giving it to me I keep
[46:28] giving it back to him so he's got faith
[46:31] to say I'm not keeping this cold it
[46:33] keeps coming back but I've got faith and
[46:35] on one day Satan just going to keep that
[46:37] cold whether it's through divine healing
[46:39] or medicine or death ready for
[46:42] separation and the press you got one day
[46:44] faith will overcome that devil amen and
[46:47] all you need is a little bit of faith
[46:49] I like that church imagine everybody's
[46:52] got a little portion everybody that's a
[46:54] believer has a little bit of portion of
[46:56] faith we've all got it
[46:58] we all say God now use it helped me to
[47:00] use it let me have your faith with that
[47:02] amazing yours now let me speak something
[47:04] in your name your glory help me to know
[47:07] your will for the situation now that's
[47:10] getting up to real spirituality right
[47:12] there
[47:12] that's our mature Christian when you can
[47:14] speak something in the name of the lower
[47:15] and you know what's going to happen is
[47:17] you just prophesied aim ahead because
[47:20] the spirit of Jesus is the spirit of
[47:22] prophecy the faith of Jesus speaks the
[47:24] word of Jesus its prophesy that's a real
[47:27] spiritual Christian amateurish okay
[47:31] would I say that's Lidia Ephesians 2:8
[47:32] is all I said Thank You KC where'd you
[47:43] get that faith did you work it up did
[47:45] you pump yourself up to get the faith no
[47:46] the Bible says faith which is of God so
[47:49] you have a measure given to you from God
[47:52] now your faith your eyes if you hear
[47:55] because faith cometh by hearing the Word
[47:58] of God that's why come to church is such
[47:59] a great thing to do
[48:01] if not layout Church throw few services
[48:03] once you betta watch your love for your
[48:07] brother or sister what you love you go
[48:08] to the your enemies watch it then see it
[48:11] when you hear the word of God and races
[48:13] your faith in it you're ready to
[48:15] challenge the devil when you got the
[48:16] right portion of faith when your faith
[48:18] is raised from here the Word of God
[48:20] James - would give it out of you James -
[48:23] unser my brother in the head not the
[48:25] faith of our Lord Jesus Christ the Lord
[48:28] of glory with respect of persons yes
[48:31] over here
[48:31] see brother man said look he said have
[48:33] not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ
[48:36] he didn't say faith in he says the fate
[48:39] of that's what our points out it is
[48:43] Jesus its own faith so what led you to
[48:46] be baptized in Jesus Christ in Jesus is
[48:48] faith what leads to believe that you're
[48:51] saved
[48:51] I thought the Holy Ghost when the
[48:53] rapture it's Jesus's faith Hey
[48:56] not behind it Jesus faith of my
[48:58] possessor of it yes I'm holding that
[48:59] faith I do have that faith I possess
[49:02] that faith but it's actually his faith
[49:03] thing that it's his assurance praise God
[49:07] it's his promise it's going to be backed
[49:09] up alright now that's a four in part
[49:12] brother have more highlights and I
[49:14] highlighted that do that was important
[49:15] part there that's a crucial doctor just
[49:18] understand that's why that's why we
[49:20] can't be discouraged like that's why I
[49:21] gotta watch myself with my wife noses I
[49:23] gotta watch myself if I don't see enough
[49:25] miracles by the time I get discouraged I
[49:27] thought it must be my fate my fate can't
[49:30] do anything Church ain't even my faith
[49:32] it's his statement and he's the one
[49:35] that's got to use his faith in me praise
[49:37] the Lord and I just got to get to the
[49:39] spot where I muted enough and then God
[49:41] can use people as glory not to be the
[49:44] scourge but be encouraged when God wants
[49:46] to do something nobody's going to stop
[49:48] I'm not gonna stop
[49:49] but churches were so yield to God those
[49:52] think God's going to use this when he's
[49:53] good and ready service after service
[49:55] year after year month after month we
[49:58] just keep coming faithful to the house
[49:59] of God homes that God's going to use
[50:00] this one day absolutely praise God at
[50:03] some point he's going to use us even
[50:05] more horse glory
[50:06] I believe that must stay committed must
[50:11] stay faithful now I'm going to go to
[50:14] start now Antipas mother Adam said
[50:17] there's no history record of him but
[50:22] there he said the only one that counts
[50:24] is that Jesus recorded his name and the
[50:26] Word of God that's only history that
[50:28] counts is revelation to that Antipas is
[50:32] in here
[50:32] now it says this let me have said
[50:36] Antipas he died but like Abel's and I
[50:39] takes it back to Abel ball for what
[50:41] Marvin both were killed for the faith
[50:43] like Abel and the purpose obtaining a
[50:46] witness from God which was his name
[50:49] written in the word and though dead his
[50:53] voice still speaks in the pages of God's
[50:56] divine record and then remember one of
[50:58] the voice of Abel cry out for vengeance
[51:00] right cut out for many where's my
[51:02] brother you don't hey dobe can't go
[51:04] the Bible says that the blood of Jesus
[51:06] Christ speaks better things in Abel what
[51:09] does the blood speak for you and I
[51:10] forgiveness raised God says forgive him
[51:14] forgive her forgive them Abel's blood
[51:17] cut out for open gence avenge me on am
[51:19] Kane's murder men's feet but the blood
[51:22] of Jesus Christ cries out for mercy have
[51:25] mercy forgive them father not to forgive
[51:28] them they don't know what they do and
[51:30] here and offenses voices crying out be
[51:33] faithful to my name hold on till death
[51:35] amen
[51:36] I do hold on to my name I know your
[51:40] works be faithful to Christ amen that
[51:43] voice is crying out even now the Prophet
[51:46] says it's crying out through the written
[51:48] word hey now Satan seat I hid that
[51:54] pretty good on Sunday did y'all catch
[51:57] that it was the physical sexual
[51:59] headquarters of Satan it started in
[52:02] Babylon the actual city of Babylon in
[52:04] Iraq I think I got my geography right
[52:06] and then it moved when a Dallas was a
[52:10] Babylonian ruler when they got overtaken
[52:12] by the Medes and Persians he moved all
[52:14] their Babylon religion up north to Parga
[52:17] most in Turkey hey that was sane see
[52:20] Sagan's he actually moved location and
[52:23] then run answer then stop in Pergamos in
[52:25] north would be Northwest to Rome I think
[52:29] I got my geographer you guys don't have
[52:31] to teach at first grate it so I kind of
[52:33] lose that you know I just got a teach
[52:35] like oceans continents individual
[52:39] counties in their countries and things
[52:40] like that
[52:42] it moved from Babylon Iraq Turkey and
[52:46] then to Rome you see that and that's a
[52:49] program goes through here now if you
[52:51] have time you want to redo that purchase
[52:53] out is you should make time at some
[52:55] point to redo this it's a detailed
[52:58] description of where Babylon came from
[53:00] honey does anybody remember which Bible
[53:02] character come from anybody remember it
[53:05] was cush cush the son of ham who was the
[53:09] son of Noah Babylonian worship came from
[53:14] ham I mean through his descended now it
[53:17] went ham cush Nimrod and Nimrod built
[53:20] the tower Babel
[53:21] so Babylon so in other words the Roman
[53:24] Catholic Church came from cush who did
[53:26] the son of ham baby then but a NASA
[53:30] program takes about four pages and shows
[53:32] you in the Bible where it came from
[53:33] which is pretty powerful now and it was
[53:38] cush who introduced the multiplicity of
[53:42] gods in other words more than one God so
[53:45] where the Trinity came from it actually
[53:47] came from cush he's the first one that
[53:50] started introducing more than one God
[53:52] which is pretty astounding now okay
[53:58] there's that okay now I want to uh
[54:03] that's all there if you want to read
[54:05] that it's on page 186 to 188 now it goes
[54:08] in the denunciation so let's go to
[54:10] revelation 214 let's go back to this I
[54:13] just want to bring this out because it
[54:14] blast you I've preached a series on this
[54:17] I just want to bring this out just for
[54:20] men here relation to 14 where did that
[54:30] I'm sorry
[54:39] okay I think I got yeah let's look at
[54:42] verse 14 because what I've done is I've
[54:46] I've looked at verse 14 I'm going to
[54:49] just read this the street 14 but I have
[54:51] a few things against thee because thou
[54:52] hast there them that hold the doctrine
[54:54] of Balaam who taught failing to cast a
[54:57] stumbling block before the children of
[54:58] Israel to eat things sacrificed unto
[55:00] idols and to commit fornication okay so
[55:04] here in this one we see the doctor to
[55:05] Balaam verse 15 so has thou also them
[55:09] which hold the doctrine of the
[55:11] Nicolaitans which thing I hate now
[55:16] that's where I want to get to that's
[55:17] what I was on I was like where's that
[55:18] scripture I know that scriptures in here
[55:19] and there it is in verse 15 so forgive
[55:21] me that's what I was looking for hatred
[55:22] his brother has spends the next pages
[55:25] right about how Jesus hates things
[55:28] what's the first thing that we see that
[55:30] he hates the doctrine of balaam and the
[55:32] doctrine it belated I'm just going to
[55:35] hit a few more things on X I want to be
[55:36] mindful the time here by God's grace as
[55:40] I spend a little bit of time on that now
[55:41] over the years I preached numerous times
[55:43] on on Balaam and I think you all
[55:45] understand that I just want to make sure
[55:46] I remind you that last row preaches
[55:48] series on how what God loves and what
[55:51] God hates I was born while I think I
[55:58] caught a Christ the lights as brethren I
[56:00] preach a little series on that lid you
[56:01] remember okay good thank you I don't
[56:03] there's a lot of service but ii mean i
[56:05] you know as I've studied I go back and
[56:07] think about them okay I did preach
[56:08] that's right again uh but in that series
[56:12] I showed what Christ loves and what
[56:14] Christ hates and one thing for sure that
[56:17] Christ AIDS is these false doctrines
[56:19] what does he love he loves to be
[56:22] worshiped he loves faithful prayers they
[56:25] had even loved us before we loved him
[56:28] any better so he loves all these things
[56:31] and that whole series went through all
[56:32] the things that he loves he said if you
[56:34] love me keep my commands
[56:35] okay so that kind of refreshes our
[56:38] memories I'm sure but here is what it's
[56:41] about what he hates we know what he
[56:44] loves here's what he hates so what we
[56:47] are spending
[56:47] sparked showing what he hates and of
[56:51] course it's this false religion now let
[56:54] me look at the pages here okay now
[56:57] here's Wade us he shows the history of
[56:59] where actually the Church of Rome
[57:01] started actually writing there in Rome
[57:03] so after the Pergamos after Pergamos you
[57:06] know Rome Babylon moved to Rome and
[57:09] there was a Church of Rome there okay
[57:12] and my dad says how the First Church of
[57:13] Rome back slid and then some real
[57:16] Christians came in there's a lot of
[57:18] history there many ways that first
[57:20] church in actual actual Rome turned in
[57:23] eventually to the Roman Catholic Church
[57:25] okay that's what he spent the next looks
[57:27] like four pages five pages off now I
[57:31] want you read I want to read this focus
[57:32] I got this one highlighted here to
[57:34] mother Madison there was at least two or
[57:36] three churches in Rome the first church
[57:38] was the pagan Church that back slid and
[57:41] brother had said here's what the true
[57:43] church is I want you to catch this
[57:45] the true church that was in Rome like it
[57:48] was called the second Church of Rome
[57:49] kept trying to get the first church to
[57:54] repent how do they do the praise guy so
[57:59] even though the first church vaccin what
[58:02] is the true church what is the true
[58:03] church what do we knows what are we
[58:05] always going to be trying to do we're
[58:06] going to try to get our church friends
[58:08] to repent amen is that simple Church we
[58:12] can't force them to repent but it should
[58:14] always be our desire to try to get them
[58:16] to ring it what was John the Baptist to
[58:18] it he was trying to get air to repent of
[58:20] his sins even though they wouldn't he
[58:24] still tried to church that's my desire
[58:25] even though even if my friends well I've
[58:28] got to try to get them to an end
[58:29] that's my invited to church as a by a
[58:32] vital to watch the videos I don't know
[58:35] you don't pray with them like I'm guy
[58:37] witnesses spent at school I said I want
[58:39] to meet with you I want to talk about
[58:40] your soul he's like well I will some
[58:42] time and now I said I'm not you know
[58:44] he's not going to be with me but what am
[58:46] i trying to try to get to his soul I'm
[58:48] trying to give to repent and get saved
[58:50] you see we must do that because that's
[58:53] what the true church is trying to do is
[58:55] try to get the false churches to become
[58:57] true churches amen
[59:02] after that event goes throughout the
[59:04] persecution started in Rome the false
[59:06] church the First Church of Rome try to
[59:08] persecute the second Church of Rome by
[59:10] the Randstad that's how it always is the
[59:12] false church always persecutes the true
[59:15] church now the next page the next page
[59:20] he talks about how and what I'm this
[59:21] little bit on Sunday
[59:22] how eventually Constantine marry the
[59:25] false church and state together and it's
[59:28] in a true church Constantine married the
[59:30] false church the Church of Rome with the
[59:33] state ok the government's the government
[59:36] and the church United then brother man
[59:40] talks about that how that was when it
[59:42] gotten married that's when the church
[59:44] and state married and then I'd already
[59:47] spent a lot of time with this then
[59:48] program goes through Daniel chapter 2
[59:49] the image of the man never he's got the
[59:51] four parts the head go let him go
[59:53] remember the silver arms and chest the
[59:56] loins and thighs of brass and the legs
[59:59] of iron and then the feet of iron and
[1:00:00] clay he goes through that shows how Rome
[1:00:04] was the the legs and the feet okay goes
[1:00:07] through that and I've already pre
[1:00:08] stepped quite thoroughly you've heard
[1:00:10] that I'm sure numerous times okay now
[1:00:15] the next thing he hits is the feet of
[1:00:21] that that image the feet of the image I
[1:00:24] don't know if I got a picture that real
[1:00:26] quick or not I'm not sure I probably
[1:00:29] that if I take too long now the feet of
[1:00:33] the image member is iron and clay who
[1:00:35] remembers what the clay is anybody
[1:00:36] remember lady come Protestants glory
[1:00:40] amen
[1:00:41] I'm Olivia's Lydia bless your heart
[1:00:43] garden hey
[1:00:44] iron is the spirit of Rome or the Roman
[1:00:46] got the church the clay is Protestants
[1:00:49] the program says it again right here
[1:00:50] it's on page 195 if you want to look it
[1:00:52] up there I encourage you to do that he
[1:00:56] said but that's how Rome is controlling
[1:00:59] the world today is controlling through
[1:01:01] papal pagan Rome right or the holy
[1:01:05] unholy Roman Empire that's how they're
[1:01:08] controlling for example Road and I heard
[1:01:10] what I understand something tape
[1:01:10] yesterday he said Eisenhower doubt he
[1:01:13] was the president
[1:01:14] I saw I was a pretty big net in America
[1:01:16] he said with overseas and I already
[1:01:19] nothing he said he said but the boat is
[1:01:22] a big man in every country headed better
[1:01:25] right
[1:01:25] and I strike you to see a prophet say
[1:01:27] that he said that's because that's
[1:01:30] because look the iron crushes every
[1:01:32] nation the Pope has influence in every
[1:01:34] nation is a great person every nation
[1:01:36] are no Trump so they did he gets booted
[1:01:39] every nation I think pretty much even in
[1:01:42] our nation he gets moved I voted all the
[1:01:44] Liberals I'll go if he does he evil
[1:01:47] things I was looking too excited vote
[1:01:48] Parker but I'll give you just some good
[1:01:51] I like the muhammed anything goodman
[1:01:53] he'd do anything good really i could see
[1:01:55] not very much at least
[1:01:58] notice how to say but see this is how
[1:02:02] the iron will crush every nation because
[1:02:06] everybody loves hope that now if he's
[1:02:09] that liberal what's the next guy going
[1:02:10] to be if god Terri's they just keep
[1:02:13] getting more and more more liberal in
[1:02:16] other words all we're all saved come
[1:02:18] back to the mother right daughter's come
[1:02:20] back to mama that's what they keep doing
[1:02:22] and program goes through that and this
[1:02:24] chapter he goes through that again to
[1:02:26] show you he said papal fox christian
[1:02:30] roams with roman catholic church now
[1:02:32] controls by religion even more aptly
[1:02:36] than when pegida bare room controlled by
[1:02:38] the pure iron of force see that so what
[1:02:41] does mother am showing religion is more
[1:02:44] powerful than government right the root
[1:02:48] of the power of religion the influence
[1:02:50] of the roman catholic church is more
[1:02:51] powerful than just military power that's
[1:02:54] a program shown here it is it's more
[1:02:58] powerful
[1:03:00] he said the spear that motivated pagan
[1:03:03] rome is the same spirit that now
[1:03:06] motivates
[1:03:06] false Christian rome remember what they
[1:03:09] did they tried to rule everybody didn't
[1:03:11] they is that what it really rome did
[1:03:13] never they said all roads lead to Rome
[1:03:14] remember that and the history my brother
[1:03:17] in history books more history that's why
[1:03:20] that's what the Roman Catholic Church
[1:03:21] all churches are not supposed to go to
[1:03:23] Rome that's what they're teaching them
[1:03:26] right we're all saving
[1:03:28] everybody save every save my grades were
[1:03:29] all in the flame family we should all
[1:03:31] unite I've heard the Pope say things
[1:03:33] like that
[1:03:34] now the next page they show how st.
[1:03:39] Augustine of Hippo gave permission to
[1:03:42] the bishops and Pope's to start
[1:03:44] persecuting people that wouldn't come to
[1:03:46] the Roman Catholic Church and that was
[1:03:48] in 354 to 430 so it's on page 195 if
[1:03:51] you're interested to read that but I've
[1:03:53] been through that I think I just
[1:03:54] preaches a few weeks ago all right okay
[1:04:01] and then this is interesting to remember
[1:04:02] this
[1:04:03] do you ever Julius Caesar called himself
[1:04:05] Pontius Maximus remember that remember
[1:04:08] that now got you didn't do the Caesar
[1:04:09] book a few months ago remember that he
[1:04:11] called himself
[1:04:12] Pontus or paja maximus brother branham
[1:04:15] founded history and showed that the next
[1:04:19] one after him let's see what his name
[1:04:21] was maximus the third refused to be
[1:04:23] called that because it was just too
[1:04:27] exhausting of a title as a title it
[1:04:28] exalts the ruler but then the history
[1:04:34] said without a history from a man named
[1:04:37] Stephens
[1:04:38] and it said when the leader Maximus the
[1:04:41] third denied that title the Pope picked
[1:04:43] it up and none of the Pope is called the
[1:04:46] pontiff of Rome how do you know that
[1:04:48] he's the pontiff or the head or leader
[1:04:51] of Rome the god of Rome that's what he
[1:04:54] is and that striking Julius Caesar is
[1:04:57] off himself as a god the next man saw
[1:04:59] her more humble you wouldn't take that
[1:05:00] with the Pope willingly takes on that
[1:05:03] role I'm the pontiff on the head I'm the
[1:05:05] gospel and he still called the pontiff
[1:05:09] that's exactly right my dad sees rodents
[1:05:14] at sea
[1:05:14] yes positive Maximus is still with us
[1:05:17] today who is he the Pope of Rome right
[1:05:20] now next is a doctor Nicolaitans the
[1:05:24] thing that he hates now remember what
[1:05:26] does Nick elated mean to conquer who the
[1:05:28] laity to conquer the lay of T so program
[1:05:33] spends the next pages 1 2 3 4 5 the next
[1:05:39] 5 pages
[1:05:41] showing how the preachers are not any
[1:05:43] holier than the congregation I said good
[1:05:45] amen on this
[1:05:46] amen creatures are not any more holy
[1:05:50] than the laity everybody everybody who
[1:05:53] is bought by the blood of Christ are all
[1:05:54] the same for the eyes of God there's not
[1:05:56] a Jew or Greek there's not male or
[1:05:58] female there's not bother free we're all
[1:06:01] one in Christ Jesus
[1:06:02] if we're watching the blood I'm not
[1:06:06] saying like if a sinner walks in
[1:06:07] somebody's done an adultery yes we're
[1:06:09] more holier than that you understand
[1:06:11] like they're living consider I'm talking
[1:06:13] about people that artists the right
[1:06:15] relationship with God they're all the
[1:06:17] same God just for dogs is where a
[1:06:21] preacher has to stand here and preach
[1:06:23] but I know more holier brother brookster
[1:06:25] brother cragger recited we're no more
[1:06:27] holy than anybody else if we're all
[1:06:29] washed in the blood but that's what
[1:06:32] Jesus hates Jesus hates a doctrine that
[1:06:35] conquers the lady it puts all the
[1:06:37] holiness in the priesthood and no
[1:06:39] holiness in the church that's the
[1:06:43] Nicolaitans option it conquers the lagi
[1:06:46] oh you've all got to follow the
[1:06:48] preachers and the preachers are more
[1:06:50] holier than you and and you should just
[1:06:52] be thankful for the preachers no we all
[1:06:54] need Christ you all need the blood of
[1:06:56] Jesus yes you should listen to the
[1:06:58] preachers if they're living the Word of
[1:06:59] God yes you should respect them but the
[1:07:01] preacher should respect you as well but
[1:07:04] that's what the nickel day and doctrine
[1:07:06] does it separates us in two groups we're
[1:07:09] more holy than you and if wasn't for us
[1:07:11] you could hear from God no you can go
[1:07:13] home to get a revelation right you can
[1:07:16] come here you can come here oldest
[1:07:17] undergrad with a thus saith the Lord and
[1:07:19] it can be just as powerful as anything
[1:07:22] that would be preached on Sunday praise
[1:07:24] God because why is God using his body
[1:07:27] everybody's got a measure of Fame
[1:07:29] everybody get out of the faith of Jesus
[1:07:31] everybody can speak the name of Jesus
[1:07:33] amen it don't have to be just preachers
[1:07:36] but that's what the Roman Catholic
[1:07:38] Church does they make the priests more
[1:07:40] holy don't they they make that more holy
[1:07:42] and that's what actually most every
[1:07:44] denomination and the daughters the
[1:07:46] Protestants the clay they do the same
[1:07:48] thing many of them most of them they
[1:07:50] make the preachers more holy than the
[1:07:53] congregation
[1:07:55] we cannot allow that here we've got to
[1:07:57] let everybody uh have respect and
[1:08:01] everybody's got to have a right walk
[1:08:03] with the Lord let me say like that
[1:08:05] everybody has to be spear that programs
[1:08:07] that spear filled and word living how do
[1:08:10] you want to be that man but I said
[1:08:12] everybody should be that led by the
[1:08:13] spirit he said the nickel laden
[1:08:18] separates the ministers and makes them
[1:08:21] overlords instead of servants you see
[1:08:27] that I don't want to ever be an overlord
[1:08:29] I would be a servant to you if I can
[1:08:32] help you send me text call me email me
[1:08:34] you know talk to me other service if I
[1:08:36] could be help to you then God help me to
[1:08:37] be a servant to you amen it's not an
[1:08:41] overlord like yous Isham you do that you
[1:08:44] just happen now if you got a message the
[1:08:46] Lord Yeti you do that you'll believe
[1:08:48] that but if the word says something do
[1:08:51] what the word says but you don't do it
[1:08:54] without the word of the Lord
[1:08:55] aim ahead so I want you to catch have
[1:08:59] you ever seen the Overlord he come come
[1:09:00] to me about it because I want to be the
[1:09:03] letter the Holy Spirit I want to be a
[1:09:05] human
[1:09:05] Overlord just with my thinking well I
[1:09:07] think this will be good I want to feel
[1:09:09] that the dish on it like recently I felt
[1:09:12] led to ask a certain person step down
[1:09:14] from a certain position I just kind of
[1:09:16] led to do that and I know it was the
[1:09:18] right leading because by the fruits
[1:09:20] works are known you understand what I'm
[1:09:24] saying by someone's actions it declares
[1:09:27] if that's the right decision or not
[1:09:28] jesus said that jesus says wisdom is
[1:09:31] justified in your children other words
[1:09:33] wisdom is justified by the actions that
[1:09:35] are produced after a decision is made so
[1:09:39] if somebody makes a right decision then
[1:09:40] the fruits will show that was right
[1:09:41] decision for example of God leads you to
[1:09:43] this church the effects of that will
[1:09:45] grow in Christ Jesus
[1:09:46] right or another example you've got need
[1:09:49] you to take a job then that job will be
[1:09:51] a blessing to you right the fruits of
[1:09:55] that the actions that take place after
[1:09:57] decision prove that you've made the
[1:09:58] right decision
[1:10:01] see that's what we must do in our lives
[1:10:04] we must make sure we're spirit leg look
[1:10:07] at that what's the results
[1:10:09] my decision what was the result of my
[1:10:10] decision here then you can tell that was
[1:10:13] a leading of the Lord or not amen
[1:10:17] so brother Branham said what they
[1:10:19] started doing first they got rid of the
[1:10:21] Holy Ghost and then they started giving
[1:10:23] men titles he said like bishop Cardinal
[1:10:27] elder Oh all these titles I just want to
[1:10:33] be called your brother hey you see it's
[1:10:35] just be my brother you should just be my
[1:10:37] sister to the Lord
[1:10:38] we shouldn't exalt anybody give you a
[1:10:40] special title okay I said that's the
[1:10:43] trouble they started giving titles we
[1:10:46] might have said the spirit of Rome
[1:10:48] divides and then conquers you see what
[1:10:51] the Antichrist fear once they do to our
[1:10:52] church he wants to divide our church and
[1:10:54] then conquer us so we don't let the Holy
[1:10:57] Spirit move in you see that divide
[1:11:00] what's afoot preachers against the
[1:11:02] people or maybe this family against that
[1:11:04] family it's kinda nice to divide the
[1:11:06] church but we understand what whatever
[1:11:09] stand with you not even love you're not
[1:11:12] loving even anyone who speaks is he to
[1:11:14] get you loving anyone who's upset with
[1:11:16] you loving them love will cover a
[1:11:18] multitude a city Rome is divided Concord
[1:11:22] nickel Laden is divided the people
[1:11:24] conquer the people the spirit of Rome is
[1:11:26] divide and conquer that's how Rome
[1:11:28] became a great nation they go into the
[1:11:30] next nation and divide it and conquer it
[1:11:32] and that's what Satan does today but
[1:11:36] Christ counters with love amen so we'll
[1:11:39] see that God will help our church be
[1:11:42] united through loving one another
[1:11:44] amen devoted answer they first rejected
[1:11:48] the Holy Ghost then they started taking
[1:11:50] titles and then they started choosing
[1:11:52] the most educated preachers the mother
[1:11:55] richest preachers and the most political
[1:11:57] preachers oh that was how they voted who
[1:12:02] had the most money with the most
[1:12:04] education and who was the best
[1:12:05] politician to please everybody but see
[1:12:09] preachers shouldn't try to please
[1:12:10] anybody but Christ amen in other words
[1:12:13] preach the word if the rich people want
[1:12:15] to go or whoever wants to go let him go
[1:12:17] just preach the word
[1:12:19] then I thought about this all the way
[1:12:22] over yo two years ago in 2015 we had
[1:12:26] about three or four families move in and
[1:12:29] it was my desire to unify the church so
[1:12:33] what I turned down some invitations for
[1:12:35] each other other places I just wanted to
[1:12:37] preach here preacher preach here and
[1:12:39] after two years like on Sunday
[1:12:42] most of those families have left and
[1:12:44] that's okay that's okay
[1:12:47] now one of them is that okay because one
[1:12:49] of them left the message and I told them
[1:12:51] not to but they did anyway
[1:12:53] but I just want you to see that my heart
[1:12:56] was to unite everybody when some people
[1:12:58] have different doctrines maybe some
[1:13:00] people get worldly maybe some people do
[1:13:02] need the message but the people that
[1:13:04] have stayed have seen that we're trying
[1:13:06] to unite under the Word of God and you
[1:13:08] see that by God's grace can you see that
[1:13:10] sister come over China know you've been
[1:13:12] here this whole time they were you don't
[1:13:13] California you watch the whole thing
[1:13:15] since when a man came into 2014 you a
[1:13:18] man came in I haven't changed my
[1:13:19] preaching I try to stay with all the
[1:13:21] message stay with all this but people
[1:13:23] come to people to know but we must
[1:13:25] remain united with those who stayed we
[1:13:27] must remain united on the truth
[1:13:29] that people want to lead let them go
[1:13:32] they're free to go we wouldn't want to
[1:13:33] force anybody to stay we want people to
[1:13:35] come here who love the Holy Ghost amen
[1:13:37] who knows the ownership who knows the
[1:13:39] Spirit of God who want to see more of
[1:13:41] God their lives data that's going to be
[1:13:43] uniting of the church amen
[1:13:45] God knows our labor God hates dividing
[1:13:48] in Congress I hate to see people leave I
[1:13:50] hate to see of young people conquered
[1:13:53] and divided by st. but we're trying to
[1:13:55] unite around the love of Jesus Christ
[1:13:57] and that love is shown through obedience
[1:14:00] through sport that's exactly right I try
[1:14:04] to stand there's a pastor and Holden and
[1:14:06] if somebody don't agree with me fighting
[1:14:08] that's fine go to church but go to a
[1:14:09] church that loves the Lord serve God
[1:14:12] love God with all your heart I know I'm
[1:14:15] not had them the best preacher for
[1:14:16] everybody I understand that I understand
[1:14:18] that I'm the lowest of the lows of the
[1:14:21] preaching of the least of the least
[1:14:22] that's fine with me
[1:14:23] I just want to be pleasing to God I just
[1:14:25] want to hear him say well duh
[1:14:27] here and I do that who I do that I'm
[1:14:31] just pretty sort of guy man
[1:14:33] every every preacher has a different
[1:14:35] gift for every uh every one that God's
[1:14:38] called them to every sheet that's
[1:14:39] supposed to give that Shepherd God has a
[1:14:41] special gift for that preacher to meet
[1:14:43] the needs of those sheep and it's not
[1:14:46] there's nothing good with a shepherd and
[1:14:47] he just a shepherd he's just a human
[1:14:49] it's Christ in it's Christ as a shepherd
[1:14:51] its Christ in the Sheep not dividing a
[1:14:53] concrete but united by the word God
[1:14:57] hates the division and conquering
[1:15:00] amongst people
[1:15:01] God loves unity so what's going on I
[1:15:05] thought about that later I wanted to
[1:15:06] make sure I should say that though
[1:15:07] people come and go all of you that are
[1:15:09] here still know we're preaching the same
[1:15:11] message just more of it that's the only
[1:15:15] thing that's changed we fall more in
[1:15:16] love than any event that's always gonna
[1:15:19] change by God's grace just trying to
[1:15:22] stay more true to the Word of God go to
[1:15:24] love the Lord man hey that's my heart's
[1:15:27] desire God knows my heart just want to
[1:15:29] be faithful to Lord Jesus now what was
[1:15:36] amazing to me remember a few weeks ago
[1:15:38] when I preached in Ezekiel you rented
[1:15:39] out a few weeks ago right before Easter
[1:15:40] remember when I went to Ezekiel and I
[1:15:42] showed you the Tammis in Ezekiel brother
[1:15:45] Branham Redknapp writer wrote about that
[1:15:47] right in the church age book and I was
[1:15:48] so rejoicing I just preached about it
[1:15:50] before Easter Tammuz in this part of the
[1:15:53] book he said damn us was romps our point
[1:15:59] of the wrong scripture for Oh
[1:16:03] in Ezekiel 8 number one is eqo went into
[1:16:06] the temple and they saw abominable
[1:16:08] things all over the walls remember that
[1:16:10] a few weeks ago brother Branham quotes
[1:16:12] that he said that's exactly what the
[1:16:14] Church of Pergamos was the false church
[1:16:16] and that's exactly what the Roman
[1:16:18] Catholic Church's three Sundays ago I
[1:16:21] appreciate right before Easter his he
[1:16:24] feels brought to the house of God
[1:16:25] remember that and he sees remember there
[1:16:27] was four steps to the evilness remember
[1:16:29] there's four abominable steps remember
[1:16:31] that some of you remember that and run
[1:16:34] out of gloaty here and I've forgotten
[1:16:35] all about it
[1:16:36] so those who showed that the Roman
[1:16:39] Catholic Church and their daughters
[1:16:41] the Bible said they're filled with
[1:16:44] unclean and hateful spirits can you see
[1:16:47] that not to be me but to be honest if
[1:16:52] they don't preach the truth they're
[1:16:53] filled with unclean spirits in other
[1:16:56] words there's abominations all over the
[1:16:58] walls like we said right
[1:16:59] there's abominations behind the pulpit
[1:17:02] there's abominations of the congregation
[1:17:04] letting homosexuals and transgenders
[1:17:07] lead the church and and for many people
[1:17:10] to marry the Overson fornication and
[1:17:13] adultery and all these things what is it
[1:17:15] it's abomination so the church is filled
[1:17:17] with all these sins are filled with
[1:17:19] unclean and hateful spirits can every
[1:17:21] see that a program brings that up in
[1:17:24] this chapter that's what the Church of
[1:17:26] Pergamos was the false church and that
[1:17:28] church of course spread to Rome and now
[1:17:30] rolled the Roman Catholic Church and all
[1:17:33] the denominations are filled with
[1:17:35] unclean spirits did everybody see that
[1:17:37] so we better have a church filled with
[1:17:39] the holy scheme and let them sit let
[1:17:42] them get bigger let them get bigger
[1:17:44] buildings and bigger ministries and rock
[1:17:46] and roll services nothing let them have
[1:17:49] that just let these walls speak an echo
[1:17:52] and whisper of the name of Jesus and the
[1:17:54] holiness of my name let these walls
[1:17:57] whisper holy holy holy is the Lord God
[1:18:00] Almighty a day let them have that
[1:18:03] let me fill with unclean birds we want
[1:18:05] to be filled with the clean Gaia
[1:18:06] the Dove of God the Holy Ghost exactly
[1:18:10] right God hates the vision God loves
[1:18:13] purity all right the next page goes the
[1:18:20] doctrine of balaam tells about five
[1:18:22] pages there on your own time so my timer

[1:18:27] hour I think maokai told no takes--it

[1:18:35] minutes on Sunday night

[1:18:40] preserve my strength here that that
[1:18:42] service also tonight impacted me the
[1:18:44] rest of the week it really did it's
[1:18:46] shorter services no matter how long this
[1:18:48] matters how much godson how much our
[1:18:50] hearts are willing to enter the
[1:18:51] gasps amen it was on the power of a
[1:18:54] prayer life if you like to listen to him
[1:18:55] even got a good evening about that and
[1:18:57] it was really blessed by that as well
[1:18:59] I thank the Lord for that now the
[1:19:01] doctrine of balaam I got a little bit
[1:19:03] more to go
[1:19:03] some more pages we went we went over
[1:19:09] that pretty good okay how he sucked had
[1:19:14] a worship that was close to his remember
[1:19:16] he had seven altars and Israel you know
[1:19:19] had seven red arrows random Sliema seven
[1:19:23] Rams and the feasts of Israel anyways
[1:19:26] they both had sevens in their worship
[1:19:28] and he was the Balaam was impersonating
[1:19:32] and copying God's worship the program
[1:19:35] said that's how Balaam got the anointing
[1:19:37] on him because he knew the way to
[1:19:39] approach God you approached out through
[1:19:41] sevens and then that's exactly how he
[1:19:45] said Balaam we got the the worship in
[1:19:48] other words he knew the approach to get
[1:19:49] the anointing what's the pro she gets
[1:19:50] anointed humble yourself right cry out
[1:19:54] for aid and God will send rain right
[1:19:57] that's the way to get the anointing on
[1:19:58] you worship God remember that with the
[1:20:02] live show Jehoshaphat and a have a half
[1:20:06] son went Elijah and said prophesy and he
[1:20:08] said bring me a minstrel they started
[1:20:09] playing the music and the Holy Spirit
[1:20:12] fell how do these people get the Holy
[1:20:15] Ghost on them even though they're tears
[1:20:16] they worship God with all the ghosts on
[1:20:19] you now Holy Ghost on me let's worship
[1:20:22] God amen yeah that's the approach unto
[1:20:24] God but let's make sure we take that
[1:20:26] anointing home with us man he then and
[1:20:29] then we're all by ourselves in our in
[1:20:31] our bedroom and we're all by ourselves
[1:20:33] the kitchen table let that same
[1:20:35] anointing let's let's have that same
[1:20:37] anointing praising God all day long amen
[1:20:39] and bring that real life to church the
[1:20:42] next time we have trip hey Dad let's
[1:20:45] live a life of integrity I spent the
[1:20:49] next one two three four five six seven
[1:20:53] seven pages going over the doctrine of
[1:20:57] balaam we pretty much went through the
[1:20:59] line program said the doctrine of Balaam
[1:21:01] is this he said you know God's will
[1:21:04] would you take out from
[1:21:06] and then Balaam for money's sake for
[1:21:11] money's sake he taught Israel to CID
[1:21:14] right taught them to commit fornication
[1:21:16] he taught them to have a false unity
[1:21:18] over all the same we all love Jesus we
[1:21:22] all worship the same God right and they
[1:21:26] all gather them as Israelites left their
[1:21:29] camp left their church and went to a
[1:21:32] false gathering and committed
[1:21:34] fornication and died God judges it so
[1:21:38] that's the doctrine of balaam again
[1:21:39] taking the permissive will of God
[1:21:41] knowing God's will doing the permissive
[1:21:44] will still with the anointing but
[1:21:46] eventually teaching others to sin that's
[1:21:49] the doctrine of balaam you get that all
[1:21:50] through this he just lays it out off you
[1:21:53] the whole thing okay
[1:22:00] now let's go to Revelation 2:16 I'm
[1:22:02] gonna try to close out I might have one
[1:22:03] more service we'll see I didn't get as
[1:22:05] far as I thought over well I think I can
[1:22:10] understand it look at revelation 260
[1:22:16] mark 2:16 repent or else I will come
[1:22:19] unto thee quickly and will fight against
[1:22:21] the fire fight against them with the
[1:22:24] sword of my mouth
[1:22:25] forgetting now the point about I makes
[1:22:27] the book here
[1:22:30] can God overlook the sin of those who
[1:22:33] have borne his name in vain other words
[1:22:36] is God going to look over look
[1:22:37] somebody's sin who serve him in vain
[1:22:39] worship no but man said God is going to
[1:22:43] judge those people who worship Him in
[1:22:45] vain he says there's only one way to
[1:22:48] receive grace and that's the repent and
[1:22:51] then honey one grace amen
[1:22:53] then we need to repent hey keep
[1:22:55] repenting that's what I mean we've
[1:22:56] already done that
[1:22:57] let's keep repent amen but when I said
[1:23:01] this this is our wolf those who fought
[1:23:03] the word who fight the message will one
[1:23:07] day find the word fighting again is that
[1:23:11] what Jesus said he said repent or else
[1:23:13] I'll come and fight against you so
[1:23:16] listen to me if we fight against the
[1:23:18] message the
[1:23:19] is unified against UPS right if we fight
[1:23:22] against the words and we don't have to
[1:23:23] live that or I don't want to live that
[1:23:25] if you fight against the word the words
[1:23:27] going to come fight against you you know
[1:23:28] where it's going to fight against you
[1:23:29] it's going to fight against you in your
[1:23:31] life towards it in your life because
[1:23:33] people can run people can run from God
[1:23:34] for a while but it always catch them at
[1:23:36] the end of their life right it called
[1:23:38] call Michael Jackson and caught prints I
[1:23:41] just read the article about Prince he
[1:23:43] died the same way those other guys died
[1:23:44] he had 16 uh drugs in his house that
[1:23:48] weren't even prescriptions for him the
[1:23:51] same thing Elvis did the same thing
[1:23:53] Michael Jackson did taking drugs the
[1:23:55] water drugs remember where drugs are
[1:23:56] witchcraft remember that that's in the
[1:23:59] scripture of those who do witchcraft
[1:24:03] will not inherit the kingdom of God
[1:24:04] and all three of those men died on drugs
[1:24:08] see that see they can't have any real
[1:24:13] peace from the Holy Ghost so they got to
[1:24:15] go to drugs but we get a real peace
[1:24:17] every time we cover the house you got it
[1:24:18] every time you pray your prayer closet
[1:24:20] every time you confess your sin what do
[1:24:22] you get it you're getting peace out
[1:24:24] so see you're fighting for the word so
[1:24:26] the words going to fight with you amen
[1:24:28] glory the word is fighting against them
[1:24:31] but the word is fighting with us say
[1:24:33] that if you don't take the word if you
[1:24:35] fight against the word the word I'll
[1:24:37] come fight against you how about you I
[1:24:39] want the word to fight for me because I
[1:24:42] know I can't defeat the word I never
[1:24:43] would want you the word I want to were
[1:24:45] to slay my sin and take away all my sins
[1:24:48] and the lust and everything like that
[1:24:49] and then the word will fight for me a
[1:24:51] hot idiom thank you Jesus now the reward
[1:24:58] now I hope you enjoyed that on Sunday I
[1:25:01] don't think I've had enough time to
[1:25:02] preach it but I sure enjoyed preach on
[1:25:04] those rewards they hidden manna and the
[1:25:07] white stuff now I want to just let's
[1:25:10] close vex I got into five minutes yeah
[1:25:11] yeah I got three minutes with the clock
[1:25:14] up there since I said I'm gonna take
[1:25:16] five okay the reward now in the church
[1:25:20] age book brother random goes through the
[1:25:24] reward of of the the hidden manna now on
[1:25:30] Sunday I showed you how brother I've
[1:25:32] said it was
[1:25:32] the shewbread now there's two kinds of
[1:25:35] Reds did you catch that I only studied
[1:25:38] the serving part the servant part except
[1:25:40] the shewbread the shewbread was it in
[1:25:42] the holy place remember that it's on a
[1:25:45] table and there was 12 loads of them
[1:25:47] that was hidden man said that hidden
[1:25:50] manna was he said was the shewbread now
[1:25:53] that's true it was only for the priests
[1:25:55] right and when they would come in to do
[1:25:59] the service they'd light the lamps
[1:26:00] they'd offer the incense they wouldn't
[1:26:02] eat that bread and that was that was the
[1:26:05] hidden shewbread this is hidden with the
[1:26:06] congregation they had a special bread
[1:26:09] then a special word just for them but
[1:26:11] now in the church age book brother Ram
[1:26:14] takes us to Hebrews 9 for let's go to
[1:26:16] Hebrews 9 for now I could read up for me
[1:26:18] sir
[1:26:19] Hebrews ninety-fourth the country Bibles
[1:26:21] whenever you're ready would and I
[1:26:25] mention this on Sunday I kind of felt
[1:26:27] silly at the end because I I didn't
[1:26:29] teach honor but I couldn't help it
[1:26:30] because I studied was the servant not
[1:26:32] the book but now I study the book again
[1:26:35] so hearty ready hey go ahead
[1:26:38] which had the golden censer and the Ark
[1:26:41] of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with
[1:26:43] gold
[1:26:43] wherein was the golden pot the head man
[1:26:46] up and Aaron's rod that budded and the
[1:26:48] tables of the covenant he meant I'd hear
[1:26:52] that this lists everything that was in
[1:26:54] the Ark of the Covenant had the tables
[1:26:56] of stone the rod of Aaron was the third
[1:26:58] thing man now and the sermon program
[1:27:02] said the hidden manna was the shewbread
[1:27:04] in the church age book he said it's the
[1:27:06] manna in the Ark of the Covenant so
[1:27:09] either one will work but the actual
[1:27:11] manna was the one the Ark of the
[1:27:13] Covenant and here's what he says but the
[1:27:18] ark was naked but the sum of the
[1:27:20] original manna in it he said it was
[1:27:22] angel food member rain down from heaven
[1:27:24] so they could have these little pellets
[1:27:26] an angel booted and honey
[1:27:28] he said they never got sick all these
[1:27:30] little pellets he thought now he said
[1:27:34] they kept some of the Ark of the
[1:27:36] Covenant so in every generation all the
[1:27:40] priests that would come to the Ark of
[1:27:41] the Covenant could eat some of that
[1:27:43] hidden manna so
[1:27:46] the program says is for us he said God
[1:27:49] gives his hidden manna to the overcomer
[1:27:53] Aaron the high priest had to overcome in
[1:27:56] order to get the Holies of Holies what
[1:27:57] do you what he had to overcome to church
[1:27:59] all the sins of his self and the people
[1:28:02] right on the day of atonement that's the
[1:28:05] only day in the year that he could go to
[1:28:07] awesome Holies how do you know that how
[1:28:09] did you overcome to get in there he
[1:28:11] overcame by the blood are you with me he
[1:28:14] overcame by the blood that's how it
[1:28:16] overcome and so he would overcome you
[1:28:19] put the blood of the outer court inner
[1:28:21] court and then bring the blood of the
[1:28:23] holiest of Holies and program said in
[1:28:26] every generation so the man after Aaron
[1:28:28] and the manager that each one could take
[1:28:30] a little bit of that mana and eat that
[1:28:32] hidden revelation they could have a
[1:28:34] taste of the original food and program
[1:28:37] says that's the believer today eating
[1:28:39] the original truth from Pentecost a an
[1:28:44] area so when we read the book of Acts
[1:28:46] and we live and enjoy that original
[1:28:50] treatment we act like the book of Acts
[1:28:51] we are feasting on it advant is and
[1:28:55] that's a reward for the overcomer of
[1:28:57] that day but also for this statement is
[1:28:59] not so it works fold it works both in
[1:29:02] the holy place and it works off so the
[1:29:05] voice of Holies it's even better than
[1:29:06] always always because that represents
[1:29:07] the fact system of the justification
[1:29:11] outer court sanctification holy place
[1:29:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost all these
[1:29:15] diplomas thank you Jesus amen glory
[1:29:19] that's what he said I did and some page
[1:29:23] of 211 is what we're eating
[1:29:25] he said they received the original truth
[1:29:29] of Pentecost that's right he said it was
[1:29:35] in the the pints of manna that were in
[1:29:38] the golden vessel behind the veil in the
[1:29:42] holiest of Holies praise God now brother
[1:29:47] Branham says there's also a future
[1:29:50] partaking of this manner okay so let me
[1:29:53] say like this there's manna we partake
[1:29:55] of today it is the truth with Pentecost
[1:29:58] my brother has said God has
[1:30:00] that will be a reward for us in the
[1:30:02] future okay so you have mana today but
[1:30:06] you also have future mana that Christ is
[1:30:08] going to give us in the Millennium at
[1:30:10] the New Jerusalem oh I love you hey man
[1:30:14] my makes his tired body all feel
[1:30:17] energetic for a little while amen
[1:30:19] the anointing of the Lord amen here's we
[1:30:22] said the future partaking of the hidden
[1:30:26] manna will be the eternal partaking of
[1:30:29] the revelation of Jesus Christ in
[1:30:32] eternal ages to come how else can we
[1:30:38] begin to know the unsearchable riches of
[1:30:40] his own being all that we have longed to
[1:30:42] notice is all our unanswered questions
[1:30:46] anybody got any other answer your
[1:30:47] questions I have a lot of unanswered

[1:30:52] happen more life you allow this I have a
[1:30:54] lot of questions unanswered but never
[1:30:56] said when Christ shows us all of our
[1:30:58] questions throughout eternity that will
[1:31:00] be the hidden man up for the future amen
[1:31:03] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[1:31:06] he'll anthill dissolve every doubt just
[1:31:10] like is that about Daniel you know
[1:31:12] Christ will dissolve all of our doubts

[1:31:16] will know even as he knows right he said
[1:31:22] all that will be remember jesus said it

[1:31:55] important questions but Christ is here
[1:31:58] Christ will be there as a reward to
[1:32:00] answer any questions they met that's the
[1:32:06] future manner that will partake them now
