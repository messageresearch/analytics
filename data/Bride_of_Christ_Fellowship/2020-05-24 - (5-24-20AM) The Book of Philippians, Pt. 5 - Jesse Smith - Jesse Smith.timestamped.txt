[45:47] by God's grace and so we are looking
[45:49] forward to that day what a glorious day
[45:52] to know Christ and the power of his
[45:54] resurrection praise God so let's look
[45:56] here as we look at our scriptures and we
[46:00] will ask the Lord here to help us we're
[46:04] gonna continue this message here our
[46:07] little series oops sorry about that and
[46:11] we want to stay in the thought we want
[46:14] to stay in the channel of Paul the Holy
[46:16] Spirit that Paul's riding with and the
[46:19] Lord will help us to understand this I
[46:22] trust the first four parts have been a
[46:23] blessing to you they've been a real
[46:25] blessing to me and my whole inspiration
[46:27] behind this was because we know the
[46:29] saints when brother man went beyond the
[46:31] curtain of time we're saying we're
[46:32] resting on Paul's gospel well we need to
[46:34] know Paul's gospel we need to be
[46:36] familiar with it and most importantly we
[46:38] need to live at praise God and so God is
[46:40] helping us to do that and Paul you know
[46:42] in Chapter 1 is a beautiful chapter
[46:44] where he says he's confident that God
[46:47] who started the work will perform it
[46:50] until the day of Jesus Christ and he's
[46:53] continuing that in our lives and and
[46:54] Paul said that as we looked at last week
[46:57] pause prayer for you is that you would
[47:00] grow in your knowledge of God and your
[47:03] judgment that was his one prayer in
[47:05] verse 9 and then in verse 10 that so you
[47:08] could approve what is excellent you know
[47:13] a lot of people I'll say like this a lot
[47:14] of people which is good a lot of
[47:16] Christians will spend money to buy
[47:18] software that will keep pornography off
[47:21] their phone in their devices or they'll
[47:24] buy software that will keep you know
[47:25] evil images off of their their email
[47:29] system right there's all kinds of
[47:31] software that kind of purges and cleans
[47:34] out your your internet experience and
[47:37] that that's a good thing but really God
[47:41] wants the Holy Spirit in your life to be
[47:44] the the cleaning age of everything in
[47:47] your life
[47:47] God in other words you have to pay any
[47:49] money for it praise God
[47:51] God has given you a free software a
[47:53] spiritual software amen it gets
[47:57] downloaded into your soul praise God
[47:59] Amen it gets written upon stead of
[48:02] written on as a computer chip or
[48:04] something like that it's written upon
[48:06] the fleshly tables of your soul praise
[48:08] God and so that's what Paul is asking
[48:11] I'm sorry praying for that you and I
[48:13] would approve the excellent things that
[48:17] everything like program preached would
[48:18] pass through the thinking man's filter
[48:20] praise God and we would be able to
[48:22] approve what is excellent what is right
[48:25] what would a what would a wise virgin
[48:28] and for us that's that's our main
[48:29] question what would have a wise virgin
[48:32] approve in their church
[48:34] what would a wise virgin approve in
[48:37] their lives praise God and that's how we
[48:38] want to pray that's how we want to live
[48:40] amen and that's how we want to operate
[48:43] is that every day we can we can live by
[48:45] that motto that we only want to approve
[48:48] we only want to allow what what God
[48:51] would allow praise God and you know we
[48:56] reach or trusting God and we know God
[48:58] will do that for us he says that we will
[49:01] and if we do that Paul says in verse 10
[49:03] you'll be sincere and you'll be without
[49:06] a fence now people will make up things
[49:09] you've done and maybe you made a mistake
[49:10] against somebody but once you say I'm
[49:12] sorry you're you're without offence
[49:14] praise God and you know of course your
[49:16] enemies will always make up things
[49:18] against you or accuse you of things but
[49:21] in God's eyes and through the blood of
[49:23] Jesus Christ we are without offence Paul
[49:27] said have all possible with all your
[49:29] strength he said live with peace with
[49:32] all men praise God try to go through
[49:34] this life and leading a quiet humble
[49:36] simple life a live at peace with all men
[49:41] because really Church the Spirit within
[49:43] you is either the Holy Spirit or the
[49:47] unclean spirit the Antichrist spirit and
[49:50] if the Holy Spirit's in you you're
[49:52] seeking for peace you're seeking for
[49:55] victory amen
[49:56] you're seeking for fellowship with God
[49:58] you're not on the attack mode all the
[50:00] time now some
[50:01] of us like me and preachers like Paul
[50:03] said some of us are appointed to defend
[50:05] the faith and so some of us are on the
[50:08] front lines you know attacking false
[50:10] doctrine with the sword of the Spirit
[50:12] now so are you and your daily life
[50:14] praise God but I'm talking about in our
[50:16] daily walk we should be striving for
[50:18] peace in our families peace in our
[50:22] churches
[50:22] praise God peace on our job or in the
[50:25] school we should be prisoners of peace
[50:27] amen we should be champions of peace and
[50:31] then there's times when we must you know
[50:33] we must defend our faith and we must
[50:35] fight against any we must cast down
[50:39] anything that exalts itself against the
[50:41] Word of God amen and we must fight but
[50:44] but you know we either fill with one
[50:47] spirit or the other amen
[50:49] and so uh you know and even I'll say
[50:54] like this even a foolish virgin Church
[50:55] even she can have the Holy Spirit in her
[50:58] spirit all the time because you have
[51:00] three parts right body spirit soul so
[51:04] even though the foolish virgin doesn't
[51:06] have it in her soul that's not her
[51:08] nature she's not she's not fully yielded
[51:10] over to the leadership of the Holy
[51:12] Spirit she can still have the anointing
[51:14] in her mind right because she's smart
[51:17] enough not to flirt with the devil she's
[51:20] virgin right she don't have interactions
[51:23] and intercourse with with idols and
[51:25] worship and things like that so she had
[51:27] she has some anointing in her human
[51:30] sphere but it hasn't dropped down to her
[51:32] soul where she can be guided into all
[51:34] truth amen and every promise she reads
[51:37] in the book she'll say amen to it and
[51:40] she'll live it praise God that's what
[51:45] separates us from every other church we
[51:48] should look at the Bible and say and not
[51:50] just say well Paul just wrote that just
[51:51] for the Corinthians no that was just for
[51:53] them to have long hair
[51:54] no it's for Bible believers today and
[51:58] you and you'd be surprised that's one
[51:59] big thing that separates us the length
[52:02] of hair right we had a piano teacher
[52:04] years ago but one of the reasons she
[52:06] stopped teaching our children was
[52:08] because she found out that we believe
[52:10] that women shouldn't cut their hair and
[52:11] women women women shouldn't wear makeup
[52:13] so what we lost in
[52:15] piano teacher God gave us in anointing
[52:17] praise God because look at Malachi Lydia
[52:19] now praise God you see so God like
[52:22] sister sang about God will always
[52:24] provide amen you said that the test you
[52:27] go through the trials you go through our
[52:28] just tests God wants to see if you'll
[52:31] stand and if you'll stand he'll provide
[52:33] and make a way praise God
[52:35] amen yeah thank the Lord
[52:40] so see and then he says if you if you
[52:43] live this way and verse 11 you'll be
[52:45] filled with the fruit of the Holy Spirit
[52:48] and the fruits are very rare most people
[52:50] don't express them because they don't
[52:52] believe they don't have the seed quicken
[52:54] of the Holy Ghost
[52:55] the seed of God has to fall into the
[52:58] soul and then it's got to be quickened
[53:00] by the word amen and so most people
[53:04] don't even have the fruits of faith
[53:06] right or the fruits of self-control like
[53:09] this here's a good example for the amen
[53:11] mang we know pastors right in the
[53:12] nominations you're you guys were raised
[53:15] in the church that's why I'm using you
[53:16] as an example they all say they're
[53:19] Christians but then they'll go and
[53:20] they'll go to movies right where is
[53:25] their fruit of self-control they don't
[53:27] have enough self-control to not feed
[53:30] that Hollywood devil machine their
[53:33] hard-earned money and then they'll let
[53:35] that pump they'll let them pump all
[53:37] those evil thoughts into their minds and
[53:38] enjoy the fornication and all things
[53:40] like that if they didn't enjoy it they
[53:42] wouldn't be there right because if you
[53:45] were really born again the Bible said
[53:47] flee from any appearance of evil praise
[53:50] God and Joseph ran from that pot of
[53:53] first life and if they really have the
[53:55] Holy Ghost way they'd run it out of that
[53:57] movie theater when they saw naked woman
[53:58] praise God they would it's the same
[54:01] thing Jesus said it's the same thing
[54:03] whether you commit the act or just look
[54:05] at it it's the same thing
[54:07] fornication adultery so thank God the
[54:09] Holy Ghost keeps us out of there totally
[54:11] praise God it's a very good determining
[54:14] division between the wise thank God were
[54:17] wise and the foolish praise God now I
[54:20] hope they repent that if not they're
[54:21] gonna be guilty of that right it's gonna
[54:24] be very hard for them to be saved but so
[54:27] see even the fruit they're just
[54:29] one of the nine brother-sister that's
[54:31] just one of the nine fruits of
[54:32] self-control they don't have enough
[54:34] self-control to stay out of that evil
[54:36] theater but you and I some huh somehow
[54:39] we got enough control we don't even let
[54:41] our bodies or children go in there
[54:43] where'd you get that self-control it's
[54:45] from the sea Church where'd you get that
[54:48] fruit of self-control was from the seed
[54:50] my father planted in my soul and then he
[54:52] watered it praise God and then it
[54:54] brought forth its fruit and people can
[54:57] look and say that's a real genuine
[54:58] that's a taste and see that the Lord is
[55:01] good that's a real godly fruit of the
[55:02] Holy Spirit
[55:03] it's so rare you don't see it very often
[55:07] hallelujah and then you know last
[55:10] evening or last Sunday evening we looked
[55:11] at the next verses 12 down to 18 Paul
[55:14] understood church everything in his life
[55:17] was to further the gospel you know I
[55:21] think his sister or Brenda you know or
[55:23] doctor's appointments and things like
[55:25] that you know when sister Brenda is able
[55:27] to go to those and you know and
[55:29] different ones of us that have different
[55:31] hospital trouble the reason we're there
[55:34] is to testify to that doctor right Paul
[55:40] the reason Paul was in prison he said is
[55:42] so that all the palace heard about Jesus
[55:45] Christ we just read that last week the
[55:48] reason you get sick the reason all these
[55:50] things happen is so somebody can get
[55:53] blessed by God for helping you and that
[55:55] you can testify and glorify the Lord
[55:58] Amen and tell them about Jesus amen
[56:00] and there are some times you get sick
[56:02] because it's your fault you don't sleep
[56:05] enough you don't drink enough water you
[56:07] don't eat healthy you catch a germ right
[56:10] and you shouldn't medicine didn't wash
[56:12] your hands that's a big important thing
[56:13] now should wash your hands but see even
[56:16] in our sickness even Paul said
[56:18] everything is working together for good
[56:21] praise God for the furtherance of the
[56:23] gospel so that people know that God is
[56:26] in control amen
[56:29] and Paul said and he said but yet the
[56:32] haters look at him and they find a
[56:34] reason to despise him but Paul said you
[56:37] know he said I'm here to defend the
[56:39] gospel he said either way
[56:42] Isis beached whether people are being a
[56:45] showboat whether pretending or whether
[56:48] they're really sincere when they're
[56:50] preaching he said their way Jesus Christ
[56:52] is being preached and I'm gonna rejoice
[56:54] amen
[56:55] now that's the theatre where Paul would
[56:58] have no doubt seen that they're in a
[57:00] Philip I now I'm gonna I may get to
[57:03] these quotes later I got some quotes I
[57:05] want to share with you if I ever I just
[57:07] had him on my heart I've been wanting to
[57:08] share him with you but let's just let's
[57:11] go to us 18 as we ended there I'm just
[57:14] kind of waiting for the leadership of
[57:15] the Holy Spirit now in those verses
[57:17] Paul's in a palace in prison he said
[57:20] everybody knew where everybody knew the
[57:23] message because of him he was there and
[57:25] it was the further the gospel and he was
[57:28] defending God's revelation and he
[57:31] rejoiced that their you know Christ was
[57:33] being preached whether in sincerity in
[57:35] nonsense City and now in verse 19 let's
[57:38] read it he says for I know that through
[57:41] this turn I'm sure this shall turn to my
[57:43] salvation
[57:44] through your prayer and the supply of
[57:47] the spirit of Jesus Christ so Paul's
[57:50] expecting to be released from prison
[57:52] amen hallelujah and how is Paul
[57:56] expecting to get out through your
[57:58] prayers through their prayers how is he
[58:02] expecting
[58:02] how are you expecting to get out of
[58:04] trouble amen by our prayers amen that's
[58:07] why you come up here after service amen
[58:09] you want the saints of God
[58:11] you know God hears his children's
[58:14] prayers amen and he said you're praying
[58:20] that the Holy Spirit will be supplied to
[58:23] me that means an incremental daily
[58:26] portion of the anointing of God Church
[58:28] you and I we need to remember our souls
[58:30] are born again thank God but your mind
[58:32] needs a daily filling of the Holy Spirit
[58:36] Paul said I know somebody's praying for
[58:39] me because every day I get a fresh
[58:40] supply of the Holy Spirit
[58:42] I like my coffee every morning I need us
[58:44] fresh supply every morning if I start
[58:47] getting low I get a little nervous now
[58:48] how much more if I get nervous if I
[58:51] don't have coffee how much more should
[58:53] we be concerned that we need a
[58:55] anointing of God amen you know how if
[59:01] I'm really low on coffee brother Brian
[59:03] I'll make sure it gets here Express
[59:04] Delivery my get it here a couple you get
[59:07] as fast as as I can right two days isn't
[59:10] enough I need it tomorrow
[59:13] that's a supply their supply and the
[59:17] Saints were saying God's supply Paul's
[59:19] need give him the revelation as he's in
[59:22] that prison
[59:22] given boldness to witness to those thugs
[59:25] right those prison thugs that are
[59:27] beating him and mocking him and given
[59:30] him moldy bread give him anointing so he
[59:32] can be a real witness of Christ he said
[59:39] I know I'm gonna be delivered to Saint
[59:41] salvation like bang he's not wondering
[59:43] if he's gonna be saved he's he's talking
[59:45] about I'm gonna be delivered out of this
[59:47] prison you are you really think Paul was
[59:50] wondering if he was gonna be saved or
[59:52] not he'd met Jesus Christ for three
[59:54] years and a rave yeah he didn't seem
[59:56] Christ and taught him the Word of God
[59:58] through the Old Testament so he could
[1:00:00] write the new he knew he was saying my
[1:00:02] he knew he was a chosen vessel he said
[1:00:04] but I know your prayers are gonna bring
[1:00:07] me out of prison and he didn't get out
[1:00:11] he'd shipped into another prison and he
[1:00:13] went to house arrest you know in Rome he
[1:00:15] did now I want to make sure you notice
[1:00:19] the power of prayer we've got to really
[1:00:22] make sure that we keep you know and ask
[1:00:25] God to help us in times of trouble in
[1:00:28] moments of uncertainty may we learn to
[1:00:30] pray and call Jesus on the scene listen
[1:00:35] you know I got those group texts you
[1:00:36] know like I send to the church the
[1:00:38] groups if you need a prayer request type
[1:00:40] it in there just put it in there I know
[1:00:42] group text can be sometimes annoying
[1:00:44] especially when you can't get off one
[1:00:46] and you see all those things pop up come
[1:00:49] on come on I've asked people can you
[1:00:51] please remove me from this group text
[1:00:52] I'm not into this anymore I wasn't I
[1:00:55] didn't ask to be in this but the point
[1:00:58] is if you need people to pray call me
[1:01:01] text me text the group somebody praise
[1:01:04] God if you if it will help your faith to
[1:01:07] know that bangs praying for you our
[1:01:08] sister who are
[1:01:09] amen if it will help your faith reach
[1:01:11] out and ask for prayer because it helped
[1:01:13] all amen it helped the church age
[1:01:17] messenger the prophet of God it helped
[1:01:20] him to know the Saints are praying for
[1:01:22] me I know I'm gonna get out of here I'm
[1:01:25] gonna be delivered and I know they're
[1:01:29] praying for me to get a fresh anointing
[1:01:31] can you imagine where they men the
[1:01:33] conversations sometimes you know they
[1:01:36] were chained to those soldiers there you
[1:01:39] know whether in prison house arrest
[1:01:41] sometimes they'd be chained and can you
[1:01:43] imagine some of those guys who just
[1:01:44] reach over and what could Paul do they
[1:01:46] elbow him they'd smack them they would
[1:01:49] mistreat him and all these things and
[1:01:51] he's asking he's saying please pray for
[1:01:53] me he said I know you're gonna pray for
[1:01:56] me because I need strength I need a
[1:01:59] portion of the Holy Spirit I want this
[1:02:01] whole president know that Jesus Christ
[1:02:03] died for their sins and raised for their
[1:02:06] salvation remember at one place incur
[1:02:09] things he said I chose to come amongst
[1:02:11] you not knowing anything but Jesus
[1:02:13] Christ and him crucified so see he Paul
[1:02:18] knew if I can he said I become all
[1:02:20] things to all men that I might save some
[1:02:23] to the Jews I become like a Jew to the
[1:02:26] Greek I become like a Greek to the weak
[1:02:28] I become like I'm weak whatever
[1:02:30] situation I'm in I choose to be all
[1:02:32] things to all men that somebody might be
[1:02:35] saved
[1:02:36] amen that's why when I fellowship with a
[1:02:40] man I can fellowship with Pentecostals
[1:02:42] or Presbyterians who have nothing
[1:02:44] they have no emotion because I've been
[1:02:46] in both of those churches I was very
[1:02:48] faithful Presbyterian member and when I
[1:02:51] was in college because that's what the
[1:02:52] chapel is up here down the road that
[1:02:53] mega church that's a Presbyterian Church
[1:02:55] and I fit in real good there brother
[1:02:58] bang for a while but after I'm like I'm
[1:03:01] really hungry I'm getting I'm getting
[1:03:02] really hungry
[1:03:03] this milk isn't enough for me I need
[1:03:05] meat and that's all reaching out for the
[1:03:08] Baptist doctrine is a little bit more
[1:03:09] media so more thick you know maybe it
[1:03:11] was like a smoothie you know so they
[1:03:13] they had like Nilka at at that church
[1:03:16] and then I got I got ready for a
[1:03:17] smoothie and they had chunks of a
[1:03:19] smoothie in there chunks of fruits
[1:03:20] well after that Simon came over and
[1:03:23] brought me a steak a porterhouse steak
[1:03:26] can I say like that on the Serpent's eat
[1:03:29] amen and that's exactly what I really
[1:03:32] started to Ewing sister Karen I really
[1:03:35] had to chew on that one for a while that
[1:03:38] was really something that's the first
[1:03:39] sermon I ever heard was Serpent's eat
[1:03:41] and since I'm there I think I'll just go
[1:03:43] back to that thought that's right I
[1:03:47] didn't even really mean to preach that
[1:03:49] this morning as I was studying let's
[1:03:51] look at the second one right here uh it
[1:03:54] just came to me that a lot of people
[1:03:57] disagree with the Serpent's II because
[1:03:59] of Genesis 4:1 I'm gonna read it to you
[1:04:02] just cuz I I can get it real quick it's
[1:04:05] right to begin the book and Adam knew
[1:04:08] his wife and she conceived and bare Cain
[1:04:10] and said I've gotten a man from the Lord
[1:04:13] now people will look at this and they
[1:04:16] will say we'll see it wasn't a serpent
[1:04:19] seed because that's when he knew and you
[1:04:23] know I've waited on that and I know
[1:04:24] brother Ram said you know program points
[1:04:26] it out and says that every man is from
[1:04:28] the Lord right every man whether it's
[1:04:32] Judas or Cain their life comes from God
[1:04:36] now Cain's nature though came from the
[1:04:39] serpent and his spiritual nature came
[1:04:42] from the serpent he didn't take God's
[1:04:44] nature he could have God offered it
[1:04:45] right God offered him salvation but you
[1:04:47] know now as I was studying this morning
[1:04:49] the argument that they give is that seat
[1:04:53] everything is literal in chapter 3
[1:04:56] chapter 3 is literal so it was a literal
[1:04:58] tree is the literal fruit probably apple
[1:05:01] right or apricot where the Brian right
[1:05:02] that's what they say so see they think
[1:05:04] it's literal and so see they see well
[1:05:06] chapter 4:1 is literal so see chapter 3
[1:05:10] must be literal and it just kind of
[1:05:13] dropped in my spirit this morning as I
[1:05:15] was studying and I felt like it was a
[1:05:16] revelation that God can switch from
[1:05:20] symbolic to literal whenever he wants so
[1:05:25] what we know is chapter 3 is symbolic it
[1:05:29] wasn't a literal Tree of Life it wasn't
[1:05:32] a literal tree of knowledge of good evil
[1:05:33] brother Ram said the tree of life was
[1:05:35] Jesus Christ
[1:05:37] and brother name said the the tree of
[1:05:39] knowledge get evil was the spirit of
[1:05:41] Lucifer the light bear
[1:05:44] he was the less whose name means Lucifer
[1:05:47] means light bear he was the most
[1:05:49] beautiful of all the angels he was he
[1:05:53] had tablets he had pipes that were built
[1:05:55] into him his stone all the beautiful
[1:05:57] stones were covered and he was right
[1:06:01] there are costs because remember he had
[1:06:03] two cherubs right covering the throne he
[1:06:05] was the anointed cherub that covereth he
[1:06:07] look across at Michael I think it was
[1:06:08] Michael I could be wrong I think it was
[1:06:09] my cuz Michaels Archangel and Michael
[1:06:12] and Lucifer were the ones battling brace
[1:06:14] God and Lucifer after a few thousand
[1:06:18] years or maybe million years brother
[1:06:19] amen he looked after and said you know
[1:06:21] I'm just a little bit more handsome than
[1:06:23] Mike oh my goodness look at me I just
[1:06:27] look my pipes and Mike you know what
[1:06:30] Tavor it means there it means a
[1:06:32] tambourine
[1:06:32] how did say Lucifer had the tambourine
[1:06:34] and we love the tambourine but he
[1:06:36] perverted it so that actual word means
[1:06:40] tambourine so Satan is like leading them
[1:06:43] and he said let's worship the Lord and
[1:06:45] he just heard all the angels and pretty
[1:06:47] soon he thought well since I'm more
[1:06:49] handsome other people he said I deserve
[1:06:53] I need to be like the Most High
[1:06:56] I want to exalt my I want to throne and
[1:06:59] I want to exalt it above the stars of
[1:07:01] God I want I want people shouting my
[1:07:04] name right and so he's able because he's
[1:07:11] the accuser of the Brethren Johnny he's
[1:07:14] able to go off and talk to like a third
[1:07:16] eye can you imagine a third of millions
[1:07:18] and innumerable numbers of angels
[1:07:20] he was so slick brother bang he could he
[1:07:22] could talk and accuse Michael did you
[1:07:25] see Michael do this I can't believe he
[1:07:27] wasn't singing as loud as me he's not
[1:07:31] looking he's not even as handsome as me
[1:07:32] he said you should join my church and
[1:07:36] the first church split was in heaven via
[1:07:40] the most beautiful preacher of all the
[1:07:44] most handsome preacher of all
[1:07:47] Lucifer Abel he's such a good
[1:07:50] liar he's such a good accused to be
[1:07:53] careful when people are accused and
[1:07:55] other people cuz Satan is the father of
[1:07:58] that iniquity brother Brian was found in
[1:08:02] his heart iniquity means wickedness when
[1:08:04] you know what the new right also means
[1:08:06] lawlessness
[1:08:07] he finally decided one day related I'm
[1:08:10] not going to obey God's law I think I
[1:08:12] deserve this now how can he think that
[1:08:15] because God was so humble God was so
[1:08:18] great God wasn't showing all of his
[1:08:19] power as planned yet right God even hid
[1:08:22] the cross from Lucifer because the Bible
[1:08:24] said the princes of this world would not
[1:08:27] have crucified our Lord had they known
[1:08:28] what was going to happen a man yeah I'm
[1:08:33] kind of off my subject now I hope that's
[1:08:35] okay I just felt led not at some point I
[1:08:38] want to preach it so he does that and
[1:08:42] he's able to convince a third of them
[1:08:45] he's able to convince the third one of
[1:08:49] angels to come over to his side and we
[1:08:52] know the rest of the war are getting
[1:08:53] that later by God's grace but I wanted
[1:08:56] to get back to this thought chapter
[1:08:58] three Satan has the tree of knowledge
[1:09:00] good evil chapter three is all symbolic
[1:09:03] and then in Chapter four switches back
[1:09:07] brother
[1:09:07] amen to literal and people say see
[1:09:09] chapter four is literal the rest is
[1:09:11] literal well how many know that God
[1:09:14] switches between
[1:09:15] symbolic and literal all the time he can
[1:09:19] do it in the same chapter he don't have
[1:09:21] to wait to the next chapter but if you
[1:09:23] are if you want an example of a next
[1:09:25] chapter I'll give you one let's go to
[1:09:27] revelation 17 revelation 17 is almost
[1:09:37] I'm sorry in many ways symbolic but it's
[1:09:42] also literal in there so see the Holy
[1:09:45] Spirit can switch back at any time I'll
[1:09:48] tell you Church God is so wise he hides
[1:09:50] it from the eyes and the wise and
[1:09:53] prudent but he reveals to us his
[1:09:55] children that one
[1:09:57] earn and really want the truth
[1:09:58] hallelujah he hides it from the wise and
[1:10:01] the scholars but he reveals it to those
[1:10:04] who want to obey the Word of God his
[1:10:06] children revelation 17 verse 4 the woman
[1:10:13] was arrayed in purple and scarlet and
[1:10:15] decked with gold and precious stones and
[1:10:17] drills jewels having a golden cup in her
[1:10:20] hand full of abominations and filthiness
[1:10:21] of her fornication is this literal
[1:10:24] brother bang or symbolic what do you
[1:10:25] think I'm putting or putting on the spot
[1:10:27] today brother so is the Roman Catholic
[1:10:30] Church one literal woman or is this
[1:10:32] symbolic what do you think everybody
[1:10:34] symbolic the Roman Catholic Church is
[1:10:37] not just one woman right
[1:10:40] a lot easier for us just one woman huh
[1:10:42] but nothing's too hard for God right but
[1:10:46] let me show you in the same chapter
[1:10:48] glory verse 9 we get to literal praise
[1:10:52] God see God switches back from symbolic
[1:10:55] the literal symbolical intro so it
[1:10:57] proves you can't understand God with
[1:11:00] your mind you need the mind of Christ
[1:11:03] and that's what Paul said that's what we
[1:11:05] got we have the mind of Jesus Christ
[1:11:10] amen
[1:11:11] verse 9 and here is the mind which hath
[1:11:15] the seven heads are seven mountains on
[1:11:19] which the woman sitteth God didn't have
[1:11:24] to tell us this symbol he didn't have to
[1:11:26] tell us the revelation of the symbol
[1:11:28] Didion he could have just said it seven
[1:11:32] seven heads that would was I'm sorry I
[1:11:34] forget already
[1:11:36] yeah the heads God God could have left
[1:11:40] it oh this beast has seven heads and
[1:11:42] that many could have moved on and talked
[1:11:44] about something else but he told us the
[1:11:48] literal interpretation of the symbol in
[1:11:51] the very same very same sentence
[1:11:54] the very same scripture so see Church
[1:12:00] don't let Genesis 4:1 stumble us these
[1:12:03] guys think then gals now these guys and
[1:12:06] gals think they're so smart but nobody's
[1:12:08] smarter than Jesus well
[1:12:10] said I didn't come up with that serpent
[1:12:12] seed he said the angel the Lord told me
[1:12:14] that I didn't any of the age of the Lord
[1:12:17] deliver this message amen and for
[1:12:19] innocent members serpentine doesn't save
[1:12:21] you it just shines more light at the
[1:12:24] thing we're trying to see a men
[1:12:26] hallelujah we don't expect people to
[1:12:29] everybody to believe that but I expect
[1:12:31] the bride to believe that because she's
[1:12:34] got more light right hurr hurr hurr hurr
[1:12:38] hurr flashlights really working good
[1:12:40] praise God it's really shining bright on
[1:12:44] the Word of God and she can see oh this
[1:12:47] is literal in chapter 3 I'm sorry
[1:12:49] symbolic in chapter 3 and then it goes
[1:12:52] too literal and you know in Revelation
[1:12:54] 18 then he calls her in verse 10 18 10
[1:12:58] standing afar off Babylon that mighty
[1:13:01] City for in one hour thy judgment come
[1:13:04] amen
[1:13:06] he jumps back from symbolic to literal
[1:13:09] literally now she's a City the Vatican
[1:13:13] City amen and she's going to be
[1:13:15] destroyed in one hour amen so see Church
[1:13:20] that's the wisdom of the Holy Spirit boy
[1:13:22] that just I felt like it fell down from
[1:13:24] heaven I just started I shook my head
[1:13:25] like this blaming I know I've been
[1:13:27] wondered about Genesis and I wrote it I
[1:13:28] wrote it I was learning about this in
[1:13:30] 2015 brother Brian and God just dropped
[1:13:33] that down this morning five years later
[1:13:35] amen the Bible says wait upon the Lord
[1:13:38] and he'll renew your strength amen
[1:13:40] just wait upon these revelations wait on
[1:13:43] these think wait and God will give you
[1:13:45] the answer because he's guiding us into
[1:13:47] all truth just wait just give us some
[1:13:52] time he'll open it up and make it so
[1:13:54] crystal clear now I got all these
[1:13:55] answers and I can't wait to I can't wait
[1:13:57] for somebody ask me that question
[1:13:59] because man didn't tell me this the Holy
[1:14:02] Spirit whispered it down to me I said
[1:14:06] they're literally thinking how how could
[1:14:09] it be symbolic and then literal and then
[1:14:11] it just felt like he just dropped I just
[1:14:13] started to smile and shaking my head I
[1:14:14] wrote the dust
[1:14:15] thank you lord five years is nothing to
[1:14:18] wait because God does everything in a
[1:14:20] perfect timing now
[1:14:23] so you know just so you know to let me
[1:14:25] just say this we were riding in the band
[1:14:27] a few weeks ago and my tutor are looking
[1:14:31] at the National Geographic for kids it's
[1:14:34] from September 2017 that was kind of you
[1:14:37] know I'm just meditating on the word and
[1:14:39] then I think a case sure one of them
[1:14:40] said daddy did you know snakes once had
[1:14:42] legs and I thought that's right I forgot
[1:14:48] about that another kind they make him
[1:14:52] like like Eve would think he's
[1:14:54] attractive right I shows you it's a
[1:14:57] carnal mind he was just like a man in
[1:15:00] fact he was more handsome than Adam
[1:15:01] right that Fitness that fit Satan's
[1:15:03] character he was more muscular he was
[1:15:06] more stronger he was bigger than Adam
[1:15:08] because the Bible said after the curse
[1:15:11] God said Eve your desire which means you
[1:15:15] know what it means longing or craving
[1:15:18] your desire is now gonna be to your
[1:15:21] husband before it wasn't really meant it
[1:15:25] was at first but then through seeing
[1:15:27] this handsome serpent this whenever this
[1:15:29] figure on two feet
[1:15:30] she got so but guile the Bible says she
[1:15:33] got so seduced and deceived looking at a
[1:15:36] member she said she looked at the fruit
[1:15:37] salt was good for food that's spiritual
[1:15:40] food and to be desired to make one wise
[1:15:43] and she made love to the serpent he
[1:15:47] didn't look like that he was more
[1:15:49] beautiful just like Satan's always in
[1:15:51] deception right and then as soon as this
[1:15:55] happens God comes out and says there's
[1:15:58] two seeds here and that seed means
[1:16:00] offspring or children so whatever fruit
[1:16:04] they ate it caused two immediate
[1:16:06] offsprings is that right now the reef
[1:16:11] doctor not was just remind I found this
[1:16:13] article too
[1:16:14] this was two different articles NPR
[1:16:16] recorded it in 2015 how snakes lost
[1:16:19] their legs God's Word is right I don't
[1:16:25] care what these demons say I don't care
[1:16:27] if they got PhDs if they're really out
[1:16:29] of scientists sister Donna one day
[1:16:31] they're gonna find out that this word is
[1:16:33] right they can't explain how a donkey
[1:16:37] talk
[1:16:37] they can't explain how God parted the
[1:16:40] Red Sea but one day they're gonna find
[1:16:42] out it was right amen
[1:16:43] the longer they study their science and
[1:16:45] their laboratories they're going to find
[1:16:47] that this word has all the answers
[1:16:49] this word is truth it's forever settled
[1:16:52] in heaven amen as they're breaking into
[1:16:56] God's laboratory they're gonna find out
[1:16:57] God's Word is right and then the
[1:17:03] University of Georgia had took the same
[1:17:05] information and they just laid their
[1:17:08] headline was blueprints forelimbs
[1:17:11] encoded in the snake genome in other
[1:17:14] words the DNA of snakes it has the
[1:17:16] ability to support limbs and they don't
[1:17:20] find that in any other animal that
[1:17:22] doesn't have arms and legs already it's
[1:17:25] the only animal on earth going that has
[1:17:28] genetic ability that it can support arms
[1:17:32] and legs but yet for some reason it
[1:17:35] doesn't have arms and legs that's
[1:17:36] because God cursed it amen
[1:17:40] that's because God said you're gonna go
[1:17:42] on your belly right and lick the dust of
[1:17:45] the earth all the days of your life but
[1:17:47] yet God left in there for us to find
[1:17:49] amen for us to know it because it backs
[1:17:52] up what we're trying to see I remember I
[1:17:55] don't have it here but in 1995 the
[1:17:59] Journal of forensic science reported
[1:18:02] that one woman had twins by two
[1:18:04] different men it's called hetero
[1:18:06] paternal super super fun dication or
[1:18:10] something like that it's really close
[1:18:11] it's pretty close to that but I tried to
[1:18:13] find the pictures this morning I didn't
[1:18:15] have enough time to find it but I just
[1:18:17] thought I'd bring that out today does
[1:18:18] that help by God's grace I mean it might
[1:18:21] not have been on your list of like I'd
[1:18:22] like to hear a serpent's he preached
[1:18:23] today but I just was waiting for the
[1:18:26] right moment and I was saying holy
[1:18:28] spirit just let me to preach it when at
[1:18:29] the right time so I hope that's a
[1:18:31] blessing praise God and while I'm there
[1:18:34] let me preach on this other thing too
[1:18:35] okay just so I can say I want to preach
[1:18:37] in the last three weeks I just keep
[1:18:39] forgetting there is a false doctrine
[1:18:41] going around and it's it's from the tape
[1:18:44] Church people saying rapturing faith is
[1:18:47] on the tapes and they use that brother
[1:18:49] van to say see we got a
[1:18:51] play the taste not you preachers preach
[1:18:54] now my first thought was well let me go
[1:18:57] see where brother Brennan said rapturing
[1:19:00] faith is on the tapes go ahead and look
[1:19:06] it's not on the tapes so for years both
[1:19:13] Johnny we've been here rapture pages all
[1:19:15] the days raps everybody rat mate
[1:19:17] I never said except that's not really a
[1:19:20] quote looks like we got some more
[1:19:25] studying up to do Church yeah I just
[1:19:30] thought it out this year too so I'm I've
[1:19:33] repeated that too now there's a balance
[1:19:35] in here don't get me wrong I'm gonna get
[1:19:36] to that there's a balance but that exact
[1:19:39] quote is not on the tapes here's the
[1:19:41] quote they're talking about this is from
[1:19:44] right before 63 the day before he
[1:19:48] preached serves as the end time and now
[1:19:51] I believe she's ready to strike that
[1:19:52] final climax yonder to bring forth a
[1:19:55] faith that will rapture the church into
[1:19:57] glory and she's laying in the messages
[1:20:00] the church I'm I looked at I looked it
[1:20:04] up that whole sermon for the word take
[1:20:05] brother Branham wasn't even talking
[1:20:07] about the tapes
[1:20:09] this message is word that could mean
[1:20:11] anything it can mean the sermons it
[1:20:13] could mean the Bible it could mean the
[1:20:16] tapes brother Branham never literally
[1:20:18] says it's on the tape we're really at
[1:20:23] the end time we've talked about it and
[1:20:24] everything but the thing has moved up
[1:20:26] upon us now now let me say this
[1:20:28] don't get all lazy on God and don't
[1:20:33] think that rapture and faith couldn't
[1:20:34] strike in our day you say brother Jesse
[1:20:38] that's been my how many years has that
[1:20:39] been that's almost been 60 years but
[1:20:43] it's closer than it's ever been Church
[1:20:45] don't let the devil rule you to sleep
[1:20:47] just go to sleep just take a nap let's
[1:20:50] be awake let's be looking for the
[1:20:53] rapture pretty soon she's gonna strike
[1:20:55] that final climax see Church we are
[1:20:58] climbing our faith is climbing and
[1:21:01] our revelation is climbing and when it
[1:21:03] gets to its height God's going to pull
[1:21:06] out rad same thing and that's gonna send
[1:21:08] her into the latter rain anointing and
[1:21:11] that's gonna bring her up in the air to
[1:21:13] meet Jesus amen
[1:21:15] see the bride is climbing see she's
[1:21:18] growing in her knowledge she's growing
[1:21:22] in her judgment she's growing cuz he's
[1:21:24] waiting to strike that final climax how
[1:21:29] do ya rapturing faith I will say this
[1:21:35] but men did say rapturing faith is rain
[1:21:39] our tapes rain not exactly not that I
[1:21:44] can tell now let me say like this does
[1:21:47] the rain come when you're listening to a
[1:21:48] tape sure oh yeah I've had many times I

[1:22:00] brother Branham in the prayer line and
[1:22:01] that program will call their name and
[1:22:03] they'll get healed I've heard three or
[1:22:05] four testimonies about that I've never
[1:22:06] had it happen to me but different times
[1:22:08] I've heard different people say that yes
[1:22:11] the rain falls as we're playing the tape
[1:22:13] but this a you know first of all that
[1:22:16] quotes not even on the message praise

[1:22:22] tape we're gonna we're gonna worship
[1:22:24] Jesus Christ amen we thank God for the
[1:22:27] tape the tape and the Bible and

[1:22:35] man says God's not gonna plant a new
[1:22:38] church he's gonna bring the original
[1:22:40] back to the original seed and the seed

[1:24:33] selective just like the lighting goes to
[1:24:38] right
[1:24:38] everywhere else brother amen was all
[1:24:40] darkness except there's this there's
[1:24:42] this cloud there's this pillar of light

[1:24:49] and darkness and savor right there
[1:24:52] darkness starts can you imagine and
[1:24:54] that's how the reign of God is going to

[1:25:06] hit me it's gonna bring forth a new body

[1:25:19] metal wall there and there's a big rock
[1:25:21] column and how's the rain and the rain
[1:25:23] will wrap around then if you're worried

[1:25:48] preached it two months after he preached
[1:25:49] it in Jeffersonville I'm looking for a
[1:25:52] time of a break forth of the Spirit of
[1:25:54] God I notice he didn't say tape although
[1:25:57] there's nothing wrong it like you said
[1:26:00] you might be listening to the tape at
[1:26:01] the time of the rapture I hope we are
[1:26:03] because our family listens to it every
[1:26:04] night we listen to ten minutes of mother
[1:26:06] Bram I'll talk about it and you know
[1:26:07] then what we'll sing and pray and
[1:26:09] everything that I hope it happens my
[1:26:10] heart listen to the tape it don't matter
[1:26:12] to me praise God he said in the last
[1:26:16] days that were living now for another

[1:26:40] Holy Spirit into the church for what a
[1:26:43] rapturing face I'm not expecting the I'm
[1:26:49] not expecting a surge of volume on the
[1:26:51] tape that'd be good
[1:26:54] I'm expecting a surge of my soul praise
[1:26:56] God that's where I'm expecting the surge
[1:26:59] I'm expecting a surge of you know I get
[1:27:02] more more computers with more messages
[1:27:04] I'm not expecting that I'm inspecting a
[1:27:07] surge of power a surge of faith to see
[1:27:10] I'm trying to rightly divide that we're
[1:27:13] yeah we're gonna still to the tapes but
[1:27:15] it's not like they say where it has to
[1:27:17] be on the tape and no preachers
[1:27:20] preaching oh how silly is that just
[1:27:26] before it comes and everything is
[1:27:28] sitting right straight in order for that
[1:27:29] and I believe we're at that time now
[1:27:31] where the word should have preeminence
[1:27:33] whereas the word say preachers need to
[1:27:35] sit down it never says that so we got to
[1:27:39] give the word preeminence he said the
[1:27:42] church is just moving up Holy Ghost
[1:27:44] power is the holy smokes that we're
[1:27:47] justified by you ministers know that
[1:27:48] don't you the Holy Ghost sanctifies us
[1:27:50] the Holy Ghost fills us the Holy Ghost
[1:27:53] gives us rapturing faith they're saying
[1:27:57] the tape tape tape but man saying Holy
[1:27:59] Ghost Holy Ghost Holy Ghost hmm remember
[1:28:02] a tape can be good it can raise your
[1:28:04] faith but they're making the source of
[1:28:06] it the tape the source is not to tape my
[1:28:09] friend that tape had a source the
[1:28:11] sources heavens headquarters praise God
[1:28:14] the throne of Jesus Christ that's the
[1:28:16] source of the rain as we move up moving
[1:28:25] up right into heavenly places in Christ
[1:28:28] Jesus are you moving up with your
[1:28:29] knowledge of God are you moving up in
[1:28:31] your your discernment for God your
[1:28:35] judgments forgot you should be moving up
[1:28:37] right we should be moving up better able
[1:28:40] to judge excellent things from things
[1:28:43] that are not excellent
[1:28:45] okay never ego now I'll get to that
[1:28:48] okay now I'm already about an hour so
[1:28:52] let me set my timer ten minutes okay
[1:28:54] give me ten moon rise I really been
[1:28:56] taking you along the last few weeks so
[1:28:57] here now hopefully I don't open I'll
[1:28:59] feel this so remember Paul's expecting
[1:29:03] this I hope that's okay sometimes I just
[1:29:05] feel so burned I got to get those
[1:29:06] thoughts out I hope they are a blessing
[1:29:08] to you it's my daily bread I don't know
[1:29:10] about you it's my daily bread praise God
[1:29:12] I notice now verse 20 let's close here
[1:29:16] 10 more minutes okay yeah Philippians
[1:29:26] 1:20 we read 19 oh ha they lujah or just
[1:29:32] so you know I did get that date I'm
[1:29:33] gonna debate that rod Bergen guy from
[1:29:35] leave aside September 12th on a Saturday
[1:29:37] I'm gonna debate him but it's a
[1:29:39] different format he wanted a new format
[1:29:40] so we're in a debate with 10 questions
[1:29:43] and answers so I'm gonna write out ten
[1:29:45] questions give them to him beforehand he
[1:29:47] can answer him he's gonna write out ten
[1:29:48] questions that's just the way I like it
[1:29:50] I like to study before I'm asked a
[1:29:53] question although I don't mind being
[1:29:54] asked questions
[1:29:55] I'd rather much rather study and pray
[1:29:57] where they've been right so that's
[1:30:01] September 12th looking forward to that
[1:30:02] by God's ease ah you know I even said
[1:30:04] last week I believe that God sent me to
[1:30:06] defend this message I believe that with
[1:30:09] all my heart brother Brian God sent me
[1:30:11] to defend that that's what Paul said I
[1:30:14] am appointed to defend the message I
[1:30:16] think every preacher is don't you I mean
[1:30:22] God told me rightly divide the word of
[1:30:23] truth that's what he's talking to me by
[1:30:25] they meant he said if you're a preacher
[1:30:26] rightly divided you got to divide this
[1:30:28] is right this is just opinion this is
[1:30:30] thus saith the Lord this has word this
[1:30:32] doesn't praise God blippi ins 120 now
[1:30:40] remember he just said I need your
[1:30:42] prayers then I'll get out of here and he
[1:30:46] knew God was gonna do it and then also I
[1:30:49] need your prayers to get a fresh
[1:30:50] anointing of the Holy Spirit so you can
[1:30:53] be saved
[1:30:54] sealed baptized filled with Holy Ghost
[1:30:55] with amen but we need a fresh anointing
[1:30:57] of the Holy Spirit we're at right here
[1:31:00] we get so weak in our minds don't we
[1:31:02] church aren't you ashamed of yourself so
[1:31:04] I was ashamed of myself this week why
[1:31:07] why am I so discouraged how come I don't
[1:31:10] feel like praying and now here's
[1:31:12] somebody preach on that I was excited to
[1:31:13] pray this morning you know like I'm
[1:31:15] ashamed of myself how come I wasn't mom
[1:31:16] see because God lets us go through those
[1:31:20] trials to show us the need to renew our
[1:31:23] minds God wants us always hungry and
[1:31:28] thirsting for righteousness
[1:31:34] he said I know this will turn to my
[1:31:37] salvation I know I'm gonna get out of
[1:31:38] here
[1:31:39] and I know your prayers are gonna make
[1:31:41] sure I get more of the Holy Spirit for
[1:31:43] my mind
[1:31:44] verse 20 according to what the earnest
[1:31:47] expansion
[1:31:48] my hope was he had a hope he was hoping
[1:31:54] that in nothing I shall be ashamed oh
[1:31:58] god help us here but that with all
[1:32:00] boldness as always so now also Christ
[1:32:03] should be magnified in my body whether
[1:32:05] it be by life or death look at that
[1:32:10] church what was pause one hope his main
[1:32:16] hope here was that he would be unashamed
[1:32:19] of the message and boldly present Jesus
[1:32:24] Christ in life or death don't you want
[1:32:28] that let's say God let you die on a
[1:32:29] deathbed don't you want your last words
[1:32:31] on your deathbed to be praised God I
[1:32:34] love you Jesus I'll see you I'll see you
[1:32:36] on heaven I'll meet you at the eastern
[1:32:38] gate praise God
[1:32:39] oh don't you want Jesus Christ to be
[1:32:43] magnified whether you live or whether
[1:32:45] you die
[1:32:47] that's what Paul says he says but my
[1:32:50] earnest hope is that I will be unashamed
[1:32:53] and everyone will know that Jesus Christ
[1:32:58] is being magnified in my life so see to
[1:33:03] magnify Christ
[1:33:04] that means he's I'm sorry he said in my
[1:33:06] body yes in my body so listen we can't
[1:33:10] have the excuse well I'm born again in
[1:33:11] my soul but you know I'm having a mind
[1:33:13] battle right now I don't feel like
[1:33:14] raising my hands no Paul said let my
[1:33:16] body that means what any men it's got to
[1:33:20] flow out of the soul into the mind and
[1:33:23] you gonna let it flow out into the body
[1:33:25] where people can see it praise God now
[1:33:28] can be by the things you do or the
[1:33:30] things you refuse to do
[1:33:31] I refuse to bow like the three Hebrew
[1:33:34] children said amen
[1:33:36] they saw they magnify God by not bowing
[1:33:40] amen I don't know yeah I noticed Church
[1:33:46] Paul
[1:33:47] did I skip it yeah I skipped it Paul
[1:33:51] Paul's not expecting for God to come
[1:33:54] down and shake the jail again he already
[1:33:57] had that happen and Philip I he wasn't
[1:34:01] saying you know I listen God if God did
[1:34:03] it once he can do it again he wasn't
[1:34:05] looking at because Paul knew there's a
[1:34:08] time and season for everything there's a
[1:34:10] time to do America like that but he knew
[1:34:13] by his wisdom but they meant the same
[1:34:14] time for a great big miracle this is a
[1:34:16] time for the people to pray and work a
[1:34:20] different miracle that the prayers of
[1:34:24] the Saints get me out of here instead of
[1:34:27] my worship now we like to say O God you
[1:34:34] did it once do it again right we all
[1:34:35] said it you did it once you brought this
[1:34:37] person up you heal me what's healed me
[1:34:39] again that might that might happen but
[1:34:41] we got to be so humble and understanding
[1:34:44] of God's ways and will and time and
[1:34:47] season that we say like the three Hebrew
[1:34:48] children even if he don't rescue me I
[1:34:51] won't worship the devil I'll be obedient
[1:34:53] to Christ I'll be true he don't say
[1:34:58] nothing about shaking prisons and
[1:35:00] getting out of the prison he was gonna
[1:35:02] come out the natural way sister de niro
[1:35:06] I think it was Nero Nero was gonna have
[1:35:08] to say Paul you're innocent go ahead go
[1:35:11] we're gonna send you off to this other
[1:35:12] person he was gonna go this ain't the
[1:35:15] regular way all of the other prisoners
[1:35:17] but brother bang while he was there
[1:35:19] ba he was there standing before Nero and
[1:35:22] saying before on the Caesar he wanted
[1:35:25] Jesus Christ to be magnified in his body
[1:35:29] how could that happen if there's gonna
[1:35:31] be no miracle sister Naomi it's gonna
[1:35:33] have to be through the lips it's gonna
[1:35:36] be have to be through his testimony
[1:35:37] through his nature through his character
[1:35:40] through the way he talks to the leaders
[1:35:44] what other way are you gonna witness to
[1:35:46] your people on your job can you do a
[1:35:48] miracle and prove a miracle right there
[1:35:49] for your people you know you can pray
[1:35:51] that God does America on the job but if
[1:35:54] God doesn't choose to do a miracle on
[1:35:56] your job or your family
[1:35:57] what can you pray Jesus be Magne
[1:36:01] five in my body let me be so bold for
[1:36:04] you let me be so unashamed of this word
[1:36:08] and this message that everybody sees
[1:36:11] that I'm your true servant oh yeah thank
[1:36:16] the Lord
[1:36:19] so through this but the Brian Paul makes
[1:36:22] it clear we don't have to have a miracle
[1:36:25] of some some supernatural destruction of
[1:36:28] buildings or weather patterns or
[1:36:30] anything like that although I believe in
[1:36:31] that
[1:36:32] Karen seen that in her life I've seen it
[1:36:34] too I spoke to a storm one time it don't
[1:36:38] have to be in that but Paul says it's
[1:36:40] going to be in my unashamed my bold
[1:36:43] witness for Jesus Christ that's how I'm
[1:36:47] going to make him known so we have to
[1:36:50] submit our whole body now if we're gonna
[1:36:51] magnify Christ that means that's to
[1:36:53] enlarge enlarge Christ through your body
[1:36:58] make Christ so great through the things
[1:37:01] you say your attitudes the things you do
[1:37:04] the way you live your life what you turn
[1:37:07] down and what you exploit you approve
[1:37:09] amen
[1:37:10] magnify Christ in your body this is what
[1:37:15] Paul says and then he says he's noble
[1:37:20] these notable words some preachers call
[1:37:22] these the greatest some people call
[1:37:24] Philippians one the greatest chapter in
[1:37:26] the Bible now I think as Isaiah 53 but
[1:37:30] it's all good you know what I mean it's
[1:37:32] all eternal but Paul says my prayer is
[1:37:38] that I'll be bold unashamed
[1:37:39] he said because for me to live is Christ
[1:37:43] and to die is gain look at the next
[1:37:50] verse
[1:37:51] 22 but if I live in the flesh this is
[1:37:53] the fruit of my labor yet what I shall
[1:37:56] choose I what not for I am in a strait
[1:37:59] betwixt two having a desire to depart
[1:38:00] and to be with Christ which is far
[1:38:03] better there's no words to describe it
[1:38:07] where they men you can't describe
[1:38:09] eternity can you you just have to say
[1:38:10] it's far better than this but RAM said
[1:38:13] it's beyond sublime there's no other way
[1:38:16] to describe it and that's that
[1:38:19] conversation he was having let's go back
[1:38:21] to that conversation one of that one of
[1:38:25] the prisoners said I'm gonna kill you
[1:38:27] Paul Paul would say praise God
[1:38:29] I gain by going to heaven then he said
[1:38:33] I'm gonna let you live I'm gonna beat
[1:38:35] you up I'm gonna let you live he said
[1:38:36] then for me to live is Christ and the
[1:38:41] prisoners like what can I do with this
[1:38:42] guy nothing you can't touch his leg
[1:38:45] until God takes him amen right you can
[1:38:49] hurt and beat him but just like job they
[1:38:51] can't take your life Satan can't touch
[1:38:54] your life until God said come on home
[1:38:56] come up son it's your time to enter the
[1:38:59] gates of heaven come and be received and
[1:39:02] come and look upon the face of the one
[1:39:04] you have loved
[1:39:06] there's my timer let's stand to our feet
[1:39:08] praise God living here is service for
[1:39:15] Christ we experience the presence of
[1:39:19] Jesus Christ but to die its gain you
[1:39:24] actually gain the person of Christ well
[1:39:30] Jesse Hauser 2020 going like Christ
[1:39:34] because for me to live is Christ I've
[1:39:37] told all those brothers they were
[1:39:38] laughing at me on the phone I was
[1:39:39] talking to a couple couple brothers I
[1:39:41] was saying this coronavirus has been
[1:39:44] nothing but a blessing to me I got more
[1:39:45] time with my family I got more time in
[1:39:47] my study more time at home I got more
[1:39:49] money I got more time to make videos got
[1:39:53] more time to write about the Bible for
[1:39:56] me to live is Christ now God might have
[1:39:59] let you go through a sickness right and
[1:40:01] that's part of God's plan but even
[1:40:04] that even in that we should be able to
[1:40:07] say for me to live is Christ but to die
[1:40:11] it is gain what if brother hey man got
[1:40:16] we're looking like a brother branham
[1:40:17] look how he left this scene it was so
[1:40:20] humble right
[1:40:22] it was so humble car accident he lays
[1:40:25] there for a few days and then dies on
[1:40:26] Christmas Eve but guess what church we
[1:40:30] lost but he gained the people lost the
[1:40:35] prophet of God but the Prophet gain
[1:40:37] Christ amen
[1:40:39] had he stayed his mission his mission
[1:40:41] was done has he said he stayed here I
[1:40:44] god raised him up for the bank it would
[1:40:45] have been more fruit to the kingdom of
[1:40:48] God but God had already decided he's
[1:40:51] finished he's preached his seven seals
[1:40:52] glory he's operating the third Pole he
[1:40:56] spoken the word he's taught the word
[1:40:58] remember the third pole is the
[1:40:59] revelation of the word - he preached
[1:41:02] eternally lost no doubt people there
[1:41:03] that couldn't get saved he done all this
[1:41:06] and his life had had been finished as
[1:41:10] the testimony had he lived it would be
[1:41:12] to Christ but to die he would have great
[1:41:16] gain now as our musicians come let me
[1:41:20] talk about this here musicians have you
[1:41:21] come up now I've had a lot of questions
[1:41:24] about the beyond the curtain of time
[1:41:25] thoughts I never wondered about the
[1:41:27] curtain of time for some reason he
[1:41:29] couldn't see Jesus but yeah Paul says to
[1:41:33] be absent from the body is to be present
[1:41:36] with the Lord
[1:41:37] what does that mean does that mean
[1:41:39] brother Rams vision was wrong no it just
[1:41:42] means it's a mystery and God's gonna
[1:41:44] show it to us one day
[1:41:46] praise God there are different answers
[1:41:49] brother bang it could be the voice said
[1:41:51] he couldn't see Jesus because perhaps he
[1:41:53] never really died he was still alive his
[1:41:57] body stayed there but his soul
[1:41:59] no know how that works actually not sure
[1:42:03] how that works I'm not sure if his soul
[1:42:05] stayed there for about your but he never
[1:42:07] really died I don't know if perhaps the
[1:42:11] multitude was with Jesus member they
[1:42:13] came running the brother branham I don't
[1:42:15] know if you have to die and then be
[1:42:16] present with Jesus by
[1:42:17] thrown and then they ran over here just
[1:42:21] to see him just to give him this
[1:42:22] experience I don't know maybe that could
[1:42:23] be it
[1:42:25] maybe you just see Jesus when you arrive
[1:42:30] after you die and then you go off to
[1:42:33] join the other Saints or maybe president
[1:42:40] with the Lord means when you get boat
[1:42:42] when you when you die and you go to that
[1:42:43] sixth dimension then you're just
[1:42:45] dwelling amongst a holy presence the
[1:42:47] presence of the Lord not the body of the
[1:42:50] Lord
[1:42:50] now really Church does it really matter
[1:42:52] which one of these it is doesn't really
[1:42:54] matter we know to be absent from the
[1:42:58] earth from this body is to be present
[1:43:00] with the Lord
[1:43:02] however God interprets that let's leave
[1:43:04] it up to him how many want this life to
[1:43:09] count for Jesus Christ how many want
[1:43:12] your life to be fruitful for Christ and
[1:43:15] yet you know if God takes you you know
[1:43:18] accidents can happen they happen the
[1:43:19] message remember a couple years ago
[1:43:20] pastors children were in a plane and it
[1:43:22] dropped the brother from Texas McGary
[1:43:28] out of nowhere his young son in his 20s
[1:43:31] in a plane just dropped in in the
[1:43:34] Arizona desert none of us are guaranteed
[1:43:39] anything church that's why we must live
[1:43:41] for Christ now and then when God takes
[1:43:44] us far better far better things await us
[1:43:49] let's bow our heads for word of Prayer
[1:43:55] how many would say bro Jessie pray with
[1:43:58] me that I'll magnify Christ in my body
[1:44:00] and that my life will be one word Christ
[1:44:05] very bad that's my prayer for me to live
[1:44:10] in 2020 sister Beatrice is Christ

[1:44:25] Anointed One Christ means you know what
[1:44:28] for me to live is the anointing but
[1:44:33] denies gain
