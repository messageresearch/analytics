[0:00] Judges chapter 16 verse 28 I'd like to
[0:02] just preach a part two on just once more
[0:06] Lord I'd like to preach part
[0:09] two felt like I didn't quite get all the
[0:11] way there was a few more quotes I wanted
[0:13] to read and then tie in some other
[0:17] thoughts judges
[0:26] 16:28 with communion I'll try to watch a
[0:28] time maybe you know I preached for about
[0:31] 49 minutes there on Wednesday night I
[0:32] don't know if I'll do that today I might
[0:33] preach an hour today um kind of see how
[0:37] we go by God's grace but I do want to be
[0:40] mindful of the time here of
[0:43] course judges 16 verse
[0:49] 28 let's read that together on three one
[0:53] two three and Samson called unto the
[0:56] Lord and said oh Lord God remember me I
[1:00] pray thee and strengthen me I pray thee
[1:04] only this once oh God that I may be at
[1:08] once Avenged of the Philistines for my
[1:12] two eyes amen we saw that on Wednesday
[1:14] night that it's okay to want revenge but
[1:16] it's not revenge over someone else it's
[1:18] Revenge from our past mistakes praise
[1:21] God and we want to make up for our lost
[1:23] time we want to make up for our mistakes
[1:25] and we want to do what's right and
[1:27] glorify the Lord hallelujah
[1:31] uh may God add his Blessing to reading
[1:33] of his word you may be seated there by
[1:34] God's grace we'll start with a little
[1:35] review and then in a little bit Casa
[1:37] I'll have some quotes here but not right
[1:40] now I want to get to those eventually
[1:47] here so uh we're thankful again for all
[1:50] the efforts today by God's
[1:55] grace we'll have the Lord's Supper here
[1:58] in just a moment by God's grace
[2:01] so we looked at Wednesday night on O
[2:03] Lord once more I think that's the first
[2:04] time I've ever preached that by the
[2:06] grace of the Lord I want to overview
[2:08] just briefly uh Samson's life I found
[2:10] this just a brief overview online and I
[2:13] thought it was nice and summarized it's
[2:15] from a Bible study
[2:16] website um you know we looked at it a
[2:20] little bit but I want to just go over it
[2:21] briefly uh Samson's mentioned at least
[2:23] 38 times in the King James Old Testament
[2:27] and remember he's also mentioned in
[2:29] Hebrews 11 in the Hall of Fame of Faith
[2:33] which is a wonderful testimony of God's
[2:35] grace praise God um because we know the
[2:38] the the the depths that he fell to um
[2:42] now this was new to me I'd forgotten
[2:43] this Samson's name means like the Sun so
[2:48] like we can all see the sunlight right
[2:50] his name means like the sun I thought
[2:53] that was very interesting you know uh
[2:55] because we must be like Christ who is
[2:57] the Sun that shines brightest today
[2:59] Jesus Christ amen the Son of God right I
[3:02] thought wow what a beautiful thought you
[3:03] know uh he was named by the angel
[3:06] remember he was named by the angel to be
[3:07] a Nazarite unto God and the angel said
[3:11] he's like the sun Hallelujah I think
[3:13] it's a very very wonderful thing we know
[3:16] Jesus was a Nazarite to the father as
[3:17] far as obeying every word of God
[3:20] hallelujah of course we know Jesus drank
[3:21] wine and things like that but it didn't
[3:23] impact him of course the wine was
[3:25] different again in those days as well
[3:27] but I think it's a very beautiful type
[3:29] here Samson like the son he's not the
[3:31] son but he's to be like the son and
[3:33] we're not the son but we're to be like
[3:36] the son the Bible uh clearly teaches
[3:39] that Romans 8:29 said for whom he did
[3:42] Forno he did predestinate to be
[3:45] conformed to the image of his son
[3:48] Hallelujah that he might be the
[3:49] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[3:53] whom he did predestinate them also he
[3:55] called and whom he called them he also
[3:58] Justified whom he justified them he also
[4:01] glorified so we see the whole uh the
[4:03] whole plan of predestination in these
[4:05] two verses Hallelujah church if if God
[4:08] is forming you to be more like Christ
[4:11] then that proves you are
[4:13] predestinated that proves you are forn
[4:16] he forew you he knew about you way ahead
[4:19] of time Hallelujah he chose you in his
[4:22] mind before the foundation of the world
[4:24] Hallelujah and he wants you he's
[4:26] conforming you which means to be shaped
[4:28] or molded he's molding you to be more
[4:30] like Christ we wish it was a one easy
[4:33] one day easy process right but it's not
[4:36] it's through years of of Trials right
[4:38] years of it's a lifetime of learning
[4:40] praise God I'll say like that it's
[4:43] constantly being molded and shaped
[4:44] through different seasons of Life those
[4:46] 14 seasons of life we saw in the Book of
[4:49] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 uh there's times
[4:52] of Joy times of dancing but times of
[4:54] mourning as well Hallelujah all the
[4:57] different seasons of life that we go
[4:59] through
[5:00] but in all of it we're being made like
[5:02] unto the Son of God hallelujah I love
[5:05] what Paul said in Galatians 1 he said it
[5:07] when it pleased God 1 verse1 15 he
[5:10] separated me from my mother's womb and
[5:12] called me by his grace think of think of
[5:14] the children that don't get out of their
[5:15] mother's womb you know the right way or
[5:18] uh even you know you know miscarriages
[5:20] or whatever or the things that that
[5:22] happen think of the children that don't
[5:24] get separated from their mother's womb
[5:26] but God ordained it that we that each
[5:29] one here today was separated from the
[5:30] mother's womb praise God and called by
[5:34] the grace of God so God's grace called
[5:36] you Hallelujah we would say we were
[5:39] walking our own path we're all walking
[5:40] in the desires of the lust of the Flesh
[5:42] and lust of the mind but then you heard
[5:44] a call it was Jesus calling you praise
[5:46] God hallelujah amen hallelujah and God
[5:49] and Paul said to reveal his son in me
[5:52] that it might that I might preach him
[5:54] among the Heathen I immediately
[5:56] conferred not with flesh and blood so I
[5:59] think I think this is beautiful you know
[6:00] along with that other verse from
[6:02] Colossians 1:26 and 27 Christ in you the
[6:05] hope of glory so Samson was like the sun
[6:08] and we're to be conformed to the sun
[6:10] Hallelujah the sun is to be revealed in
[6:12] our lives oh isn't it beautiful praise
[6:15] God to reveal his son in me so I believe
[6:20] we can get some meaning of that that
[6:22] that Jesus will reveal himself in us
[6:25] I'll say like this to us he'll reveal it
[6:27] to us but also to other people
[6:31] in other words you'll see your life
[6:32] being formed more like Christ and it
[6:35] it'll be revealed to you wow I see
[6:36] Christ he's really being formed in my
[6:38] life amen that that'll make you joyful
[6:41] amen and then other people will see
[6:42] Christ being formed in you praise God
[6:45] Amen they they'll testify and say wow
[6:47] like I had numerous or two people three
[6:49] or four yeah three people tell me this
[6:51] week uh they say I don't know how you do
[6:53] all that Jesse I don't know they told me
[6:54] at work there and I said it's just
[6:56] Christ in me if there's anything good in
[6:58] me it has to be Christ hallelujah amen
[7:01] it has to be Jesus uh conforming me to
[7:03] be like him and is Jesus revealing
[7:06] himself in me praise God Amen Hallelujah
[7:09] and then Jesus said let your light so
[7:11] shine well I thought he's the light he
[7:14] is the light but you're the Lesser light
[7:15] amen he's the sun you're the moon
[7:18] Hallelujah as the Bible says plainly let
[7:20] your light so shine before men in
[7:22] Matthew 5:116 that they may see your
[7:24] good works and glorify your father which
[7:27] in he which is in heaven there's C
[7:29] certain things we we can't we can't hide
[7:31] right we're to do our prayers our
[7:33] fasting our giving of Psalms in secret
[7:35] but there's sometimes everyone's going
[7:36] to see the light and Jesus said let that
[7:39] light shine Hallelujah now brother Ram
[7:42] often says that he said Hollywood shines
[7:45] but the gospel glows well it don't don't
[7:49] Focus too much on those words because
[7:51] the Bible said let your light shine
[7:53] before men right in other words
[7:55] Hollywood has a false light and the real
[7:58] light of Jesus Christ is his spirit
[8:00] being revealed in you praise God Amen
[8:02] you obeying the Bible you living the
[8:04] word of God and that shines because the
[8:06] Jesus said let your light shine before
[8:08] men Hallelujah let it be a real light
[8:10] not a false light not a A personation or
[8:13] a man-made light but let the Divine
[8:15] Light or the Life of Christ the life l i
[8:18] f e Let The Life of Christ be displayed
[8:21] in your life and that's the real light l
[8:24] i g HT of God hallelujah amen those
[8:27] words kind of sound a lot ofik so got to
[8:29] spell him out
[8:30] there now Samson had a miraculous birth
[8:34] exploits but also had
[8:36] failings and but yet is a beautiful
[8:38] picture of redemption in his death
[8:41] hallelujah it's in judges 13-6 it begins
[8:44] with the Philistines harassing the
[8:46] people in the southern part of ancient
[8:48] Israel and Samson is
[8:51] born to deliver them from the
[8:53] Philistines that's the very purpose he
[8:56] was born to deliver someone praise God
[8:59] don't you know Church someone was born
[9:01] to preach the gospel to you yes amen
[9:04] someone was born to raise you to serve
[9:06] God amen amen someone was born to
[9:09] witness to you praise God someone was
[9:11] born to pray for you someone was born to
[9:12] pray for me praise God amen amen this
[9:15] man was born to help the people each one
[9:18] of you were born to help somebody else
[9:20] praise God and somebody was born for you
[9:22] hallelujah
[9:24] amen I like that amen cuz we all have a
[9:27] purpose like brother amen told me before
[9:29] I don't I wouldn't be here without you
[9:31] but I turn around and say brother I
[9:32] wouldn't be here without you I might
[9:34] have quit a long time
[9:35] ago see we got that we're all born for
[9:39] one another praise
[9:40] God Samson was born for them but uh his
[9:43] mom was born for him we wouldn't have
[9:46] Samson without his mother and father
[9:48] praise God and so see it's it's
[9:50] everybody has a purpose we're all tied
[9:52] together in this great plan of God this
[9:55] great economy of God everybody's got a
[9:57] purpose everybody's got a a gifts every
[9:59] everyone has something they're called to
[10:01] do so let's do what God called us to do
[10:03] praise God let's be like Samson let's
[10:05] yield ourselves to the Lord
[10:08] hallelujah now we don't want to be like
[10:09] him in his failures but we can we we
[10:11] what we learn is a type of this we learn
[10:14] a pattern of this that no just no matter
[10:17] how far we might fall no matter the sins
[10:19] we might do God is rich in Mercy
[10:22] hallelujah amen and he'll redeem us
[10:25] praise God and we can still accomplish
[10:27] our purpose of God no matter no matter
[10:29] our failures no matter our struggles
[10:31] will still accomplish God's purpose
[10:33] nobody can thwart God's purpose
[10:35] Hallelujah in other words nobody can
[10:37] stop the plan of God hallelujah amen the
[10:40] Devils can't stop the plan of God for
[10:42] your life God has a purpose and it's
[10:44] going to be accomplished praise God and
[10:46] like brother R said no matter what God
[10:47] has to do to get us to obey him God will
[10:50] get his sons and daughters to to obey
[10:53] him he'll chasen them whatever he must
[10:55] do because he loves them hallelujah amen
[10:58] think about that it was the love of God
[11:00] that is Samson's eyes got plucked out
[11:02] that was God's love that was God's mercy
[11:05] because what would he have kept doing he
[11:06] would have kept laying with the Lila and
[11:09] who knows he probably would have went to
[11:10] some other woman
[11:11] right look at s look at Solomon look at
[11:14] all you know look at David look at these
[11:16] men see it was God's mercy it doesn't
[11:19] look like it it may not feel like it but
[11:21] it is God's love to us hallelujah amen
[11:24] the trials of Life brother man said is
[11:26] God's grace to us and they draw us
[11:28] closer to him
[11:33] Hallelujah next uh he's born Solomon or
[11:37] Samson is Born To The danite woman there
[11:41] and she was healed of her barness she
[11:43] and manoah were instructed to raise him
[11:45] as a Nazarite he was dedicated to serve
[11:48] God to his death Hallelujah serve god
[11:51] with a Nazarite vow till he died
[11:54] Hallelujah and then the Holy Spirit
[11:55] started stirring him and I love how the
[11:58] Sight and Sound kind of kind of
[11:59] dramatizes that he just uh they just the
[12:01] spirit comes on him and then he every
[12:03] Everybody Knows the spirit of God is on
[12:05] Samson I like
[12:08] that and then you know we see him
[12:10] greatly Desiring to marry this
[12:11] Philistine woman of course we see a type
[12:13] here of the Jew and Gentile
[12:15] Church a a young lion attacks him as he
[12:18] travels to the city to take her for a
[12:20] wife and in this first notable Act of
[12:23] strength with his bare hands he tears up
[12:25] and kills the hungry lion with his bare
[12:27] hands
[12:29] right and of course uh brother typed
[12:32] this of course the lion of the tribe of
[12:33] Judah Christ dying right it's like God
[12:36] it's God tearing his son apart the lion
[12:38] right but yet inside of jesus' death
[12:40] there's honey in there amen amen praise
[12:43] God there's honey there's Sweetness in
[12:46] the death of Christ because it means
[12:48] forgiveness Hallelujah the mighty lion
[12:51] has died for us the lion has become the
[12:53] lamb hallelujah amen and there sweetness
[12:57] there makes me want to sing Honey in the
[12:59] Rock praise God but song service is over
[13:02] come on up brothers let's sing the Honey
[13:03] in the Rock real quick here
[13:07] hallelujah now during the wedding
[13:09] celebration he offers his guests a
[13:11] valuable prize if they'll answer a
[13:13] riddle and they're stumped so they have
[13:16] to resort to threatening his uh future
[13:18] wife and they finally get that answer
[13:21] and he gets enraged after that uh he his
[13:24] wife had been uh uh kind of uh not not
[13:28] tricked in that but persuaded to give
[13:30] the riddle and then he went and killed
[13:32] 30 Philistines in order to provide the
[13:35] prize now we see the type in there and
[13:38] of course this is not a perfect type but
[13:40] we can see how um the wife didn't know
[13:44] the secret until the seventh day the
[13:46] seventh Church age it's a beautiful type
[13:48] of what God is doing in this day the
[13:50] seventh angel Revelation 10 the mystery
[13:52] couldn't be finished until the seventh
[13:54] angel had it praise God it's a beautiful
[13:57] type this is a type you'll never hear a
[13:59] denomination church I know cuz I was
[14:02] raised there that people you know even
[14:05] today you know even when I was in the
[14:06] message I still struggled with this
[14:08] until the Revelation came uh cam got the
[14:11] he told me CAM got the he heard another
[14:12] preacher overseas preach it and then cam
[14:14] preach it well when cam preached it was
[14:15] the first time I heard it so I gave cam
[14:17] the credit in the book for preaching
[14:18] that but Cam said well Jesse it wasn't
[14:19] me it was it's another preacher that
[14:21] actually preached that I gave cam the
[14:23] credit because that's the first person I
[14:24] heard it from but it's a beautiful type
[14:27] a Jew marrying a gentile an anointed man
[14:30] under Nazarite vow Jew marrying a
[14:32] gentile wife and there's a mystery for
[14:34] seven days it's a wedding for seven days
[14:36] seven Church ages praise God and the
[14:38] answer is made known on the seventh day
[14:40] praise God oh it's a beautiful type but
[14:43] of course it's not a perfect type
[14:44] because then we know uh she's given a
[14:45] marriage to somebody else
[14:48] right now 3,000 men of Judah decide to
[14:51] turn Samson over to the Philistines in
[14:52] order to avoid rep retribution he seizes
[14:55] on the opportunity to get closer to
[14:57] Israel's Army but once he's turned over
[14:59] to them he finds a Jawbone of a newly uh
[15:03] Dead uh a dead what's that word there
[15:08] mon donkey there you go I don't want to
[15:09] say the regular one I mean I could but I
[15:12] thought you say donkey and he takes that
[15:14] Jawbone and he slays a thousand of them
[15:17] and I heard brother Adam say yesterday
[15:18] he said any anyone that finds an old
[15:19] dead bone out in the wilderness he said
[15:22] a bone of an animal it's easily broken
[15:24] he said but brother Ram said the
[15:25] anointing of God came on him and he slew
[15:27] a thousand men and he said they had
[15:29] helmets on and and and what do they call
[15:31] it the mail the metal mail sheet or
[15:34] clothing on their their their armor and
[15:36] a thousand of them remember I I shared a
[15:38] few weeks ago or I'm sorry last year he
[15:40] was on an elevated place so he was able
[15:43] as they ran to him God just brought them
[15:45] all in and he just wiped them all out
[15:47] praise God God set him on a rock
[15:49] hallelujah amen hallelujah and God sets
[15:52] us on the rock of the revelation of
[15:55] Jesus Christ praise
[15:57] God where it wouldn't seem you'd be able
[16:00] to overcome we overcome by the blood of
[16:02] the lamb and the word of Our Testimony
[16:04] praise God by Supernatural means we
[16:07] overcome because God has exalted us the
[16:10] Bible said he exalts those who humble
[16:12] themselves Hallelujah so we humble
[16:14] ourselves God exalts us and we're able
[16:16] to conquer all the foes see that's proof
[16:19] you're conquering is because you're here
[16:20] today Hallelujah after all these years
[16:23] and all these months and all these
[16:24] trials you're still here today you're
[16:26] still conquering Samson Hallelujah
[16:29] amen glory after this in judges 15:20
[16:33] the Bible said he judged Israel 20 years
[16:37] so that's and I think that Sight and
[16:38] Sound beautifully describes that as well
[16:40] that time just passes they know there's
[16:41] an anointed man but then time passes and
[16:44] that's how you know God trains people
[16:46] but that's also how the enemy works you
[16:48] got to be careful in those seasons of
[16:49] quietness
[16:51] right uh God's people can be tempted
[16:54] away from the real
[16:55] thing and that's when s uh Delilah
[16:58] started wooing Samson brother bradam
[17:00] said the Bible said the people of Goda
[17:03] discovered that Samson's in in the city
[17:05] uh he was with the prostitute uh they
[17:08] quickly decide to secretly surround him
[17:10] they wait till morning to kill him but
[17:12] then he leaves the city at midnight with
[17:14] a spectacular show of strength he tears
[17:17] loose the city Gates and he deposits
[17:20] them on top of a hill outside the city I
[17:23] love how they dramatize this this was a
[17:25] literal fulfillment of what God told
[17:27] Abraham Abraham's seed will possess the
[17:30] gates of their enemies amen what a
[17:33] beautiful type amen you know today we
[17:35] think for us it's spiritual right so any
[17:37] area that's maybe in our lives that's
[17:39] weak or overcome or or taken over by the
[17:42] enemy we're able to go into that area
[17:45] and we're able to take back that area of
[17:47] Our Lives we're able to possess the
[17:50] gates that the enemies that the enemies
[17:53] had why because we're Abraham's seed
[17:55] hallelujah amen like like I you know
[17:58] just just giving some simple examples
[17:59] like my life had hatred for my father
[18:01] well God anointed me and I was able to
[18:04] capture those Gates back and now I love
[18:06] my dad amen so see in your relationships
[18:09] you're able to get you're able to go to
[18:11] those Gates and take back what the enemy
[18:13] may have stolen from you because you're
[18:16] Abraham's seed and it's promised it's a
[18:18] word of God you can possess those Gates
[18:20] Again hallelujah amen and I love what
[18:23] Jesus said he said the Gates of Hell
[18:25] will not Prevail against you praise God
[18:27] amen amen Hallelujah you're able to take
[18:30] back your Gates and then the Gates of
[18:32] Hell the councils of Hell cannot
[18:35] overcome you praise
[18:39] God hallelujah after this uh the five
[18:44] Philistine leaders employ the services
[18:47] of Delilah to discover how to render him
[18:50] powerless his uh lust and weakness for
[18:53] women coupled with Thea's persistence
[18:56] pays off and she learns the source of
[18:58] his power is his unshaved head his
[19:01] separation to
[19:03] God
[19:05] hallelujah
[19:06] Delilah as he as Samson sleeps shaves
[19:10] his hair off caus him to break the vow
[19:12] and lose his Supernatural strength the
[19:14] Philistines uh imprison him they Gorge
[19:17] out his eyes and they force him to grind
[19:20] in the prison right and that's kind of
[19:22] the background where I didn't preach on
[19:23] Wednesday just to see that again to be
[19:26] aware of that I love brother man says to
[19:29] get our remember on Wednesday brother
[19:30] man said to to get our our power back he
[19:33] said we got to have a another prayer
[19:35] meeting so the opposite is true Samson
[19:39] lost his power by not staying in
[19:41] prayer he lost his power by compromising
[19:44] not living a separated life unto God
[19:47] hallelujah it's a beautiful picture
[19:49] there I love it I keep saying
[19:51] beautiful now you can switch over I got
[19:53] some uh quotes
[19:56] here oh yeah I got to plug in now as I
[19:59] was preaching I went back and listened
[20:00] to it because sometimes I wonder well
[20:01] what was inspired what what did I feel
[20:03] like was a a
[20:05] help and I want to you know this thought
[20:07] came brother Brandon mentioned about
[20:08] mechanics and Dynamics and I don't know
[20:10] if I've ever preached a sermon just on
[20:11] mechanics and Dynamics I know last year
[20:14] uh during the the doctrine series I
[20:16] preached a whole sermon on the latter
[20:17] rain
[20:18] quotes So I know I'm trying to raise
[20:20] your faith but I think this will raise
[20:21] your faith because I help I think it
[20:22] will help you understand mechanics and
[20:24] Dynamics brother Braham applies it in at
[20:26] least six or seven different ways
[20:28] there's many ways to apply this so let
[20:31] me just go through these I try to go
[20:32] quickly here's six illustrations of
[20:34] mechanics and Dynamics he said balum was
[20:37] a an illustration of that balum killed
[20:40] the seven Rams right brother R said he
[20:42] had the mechanics right but not the
[20:44] Dynamics now this is difficult for me to
[20:46] understand because he still had Visions
[20:47] he still had Supernatural in his life
[20:50] and he spoke to God
[20:52] directly okay so it seems like he had
[20:54] some Supernatural
[20:56] work um but that's just one interesting
[20:59] quote there so just again to show how
[21:01] even anyone with the gift everyone has
[21:03] the gift of God anyone who whoever it is
[21:06] they they have to have both mechanics
[21:08] and Dynamics right you got to have the
[21:10] mechanics the simple things you got to
[21:12] have all the foundation but then you got
[21:13] to have the power come upon that all
[21:16] right now I want to read some quotes
[21:18] from Brother BR here's the first
[21:19] illustration it's the train a
[21:22] constructed train with all the parts
[21:24] think of all the parts in a train right
[21:26] versus a moving train that's the first
[21:28] one brother random uh gives he said
[21:30] today with the great intellectual
[21:32] messages we can explain it till you can
[21:34] see the picture but that isn't what
[21:36] we're looking for we're not looking for
[21:37] the mechanics we're looking for the
[21:38] Dynamics of it okay he talks about he
[21:41] said look at this big 16 or 35 coach
[21:44] trained sitting there on the track but
[21:46] if you haven't got any steam in it it
[21:48] takes the dynamic to perform with the
[21:49] mechanics and that's what we need now is
[21:52] to see that okay now so I you know this
[21:56] is of course a good a good scripture or
[21:58] good quote rather you know we can have
[21:59] everything constructed right but we got
[22:01] to have the power to make it move amen
[22:04] now church but all but I want you to
[22:06] catch this both parts are equally
[22:08] important you can have all the spark all
[22:11] the fire all the coals you want but if
[22:13] that Train's not constructed right it
[22:15] ain't going
[22:16] nowhere you can have all the fire fire
[22:18] in that engine but those those wheels
[22:20] are not moving unless every nut and Bol
[22:23] and screw everything is exactly in the
[22:25] right spot but B said we're a bunch of
[22:28] nuts remember that he said he said we're
[22:30] a bunch of nuts you got to have all the
[22:31] nuts in place amen all the nuts and
[22:33] bolts a second illustration he says is
[22:36] the body and the spirit so think of a
[22:38] funeral you have the mechanics there but
[22:40] you don't have the
[22:42] Dynamics he says now my body is the
[22:45] mechanics but my body will not operate
[22:47] without the Dynamics the spirit and the
[22:49] spirit operates my body brings it under
[22:53] control Hallelujah so spiritually let's
[22:55] apply that we're the body of Christ we
[22:57] have made male female children we have
[22:59] preachers we have Ley we have everybody
[23:01] here but everybody has one of the nine
[23:03] gifts of the Spirit that's all mechanics
[23:05] we're all here but it takes the Dynamics
[23:07] Hallelujah to get something done praise
[23:10] God Amen so for people's needs to be met
[23:13] it takes the
[23:14] supernatural power of the Holy Spirit to
[23:16] move through the body of Christ that
[23:18] needs can be met Hallelujah a third
[23:21] illustration brother R said it's like
[23:23] having a checkbook but having no money
[23:26] he said we need both we need checkbook
[23:28] and we need money we can all say Amen to
[23:30] that right brother said in my travel I
[23:33] find two classes of people he said the
[23:36] fundamentals the fundamentals like
[23:38] Baptist and so forth they know where
[23:40] they're at but they don't have any faith
[23:41] in the word right we kind of saw that a
[23:44] little bit last week right they need the
[23:46] reverence they need the reverence in the
[23:48] reverence for the Holy
[23:50] Spirit he says and the Pentecostals has
[23:52] got a lot of faith but don't know who
[23:55] they
[23:56] are so brother said we need need both we
[23:58] need to have faith in God's word and we
[24:00] need to know who we are amen praise God
[24:04] hallelujah we're a Samson praise God
[24:06] right we're an overcoming Church
[24:08] hallelujah we're the blood bought uh
[24:11] completely forgiven uh no condemnation
[24:14] bride of Jesus Christ Hallelujah and
[24:17] these signs follow us because we're
[24:19] Believers amen I was thinking about you
[24:21] know the signs and wonders you know and
[24:23] just try to make it so simple so back in
[24:26] 2018 when we had the uh that little
[24:29] difficult situation I was telling my
[24:31] wife at that moment I saiding I feel
[24:33] like this is some type of like a wolf's
[24:35] coming after our church and I was I was
[24:37] talking to her about Acts chapter 20 and
[24:38] how uh Paul said wolves are going to
[24:41] come in here and at that very moment
[24:43] brother amen sent me a text and said I
[24:45] just had a dream about wolves attacking
[24:47] the church it was at that exact moment
[24:51] that was a sign to me and I'll tell you
[24:53] that was a Wonder to me because i' have
[24:55] this problem for years and and the very
[24:58] moment I'm quoting the scripture I get a
[25:00] text say we just had a dream that this
[25:02] these people are like wolves attacking
[25:04] us that makes me go wow God cares about
[25:08] me right and I'll just use sister Naomi
[25:11] when she went to Ghana we're all praying
[25:13] you know uh you know with the coid
[25:15] restrictions no one knew the government
[25:17] was going to change that was a great
[25:19] sign to us that's a great wonder I
[25:21] wondered how did God ordain that amen
[25:25] God had all those meetings in Ghana in
[25:26] their airports whever government
[25:28] facilities well we're going to relax the
[25:30] we're going to relax the requirement on
[25:31] this
[25:32] day that just makes you wonder like wow
[25:35] God is really great praise God Amen
[25:38] signs and wonders right signs wonders
[25:40] Miracles when God heals our sick it's a
[25:42] miracle praise God when it just happens
[25:45] and there's no there's no uh explanation
[25:47] for it and and and that's what the
[25:49] church of living God has signs wonders
[25:51] and miracles and church let's make it so
[25:53] simple that we can see Christ Among Us
[25:55] praise God cuz I believe that's what
[25:57] Christ does
[25:59] Amen like I was telling uh like Austin
[26:02] and I were texting yesterday you know
[26:03] we're going to go through different
[26:04] moments of desperation our lives and
[26:07] that really brings out the real part of
[26:09] us it really brings out our character
[26:12] it's like when no no was going to fly
[26:14] you know she was she was in
[26:16] desperation right when I was uh battling
[26:19] that situation I was in
[26:20] desperation right you know each one of
[26:23] us when Austin had the migraine he's in
[26:24] desperation you know God brings us to
[26:27] those moments
[26:28] and how God answers that's God's
[26:30] Vindication that's God's blessing that's
[26:33] God's Fe rushing in to save the day and
[26:35] rescue his people praise God hallelujah
[26:39] he's going to he's going to come in and
[26:40] rescue Emma amen from this uh this legal
[26:43] situation let's believe it by God's
[26:45] grace
[26:47] Hallelujah and so it's it's a it's it's
[26:50] the same thing we got to have money in
[26:52] the bank but we got to know how to write
[26:53] a check praise
[26:56] God there's a a third ill okay that's
[26:59] the same one or did I not change this
[27:05] one okay that's just more on the same
[27:07] thing yeah so yeah we've got to have the
[27:09] power of the spirit so the power of the
[27:11] spirit is the money in the bank but we
[27:14] got to come back to the word to feed
[27:15] this machine we got to know how to
[27:17] mechanically write a
[27:19] check so we got to have both praise God
[27:21] Amen we got to know what the word says
[27:24] and we got to have the power of the word
[27:26] praise God Amen brother said there ought
[27:29] to be a holy power
[27:31] surrounding and this is once more Lord
[27:34] in the church that will make demons flee
[27:36] now what is that it's become a laughing
[27:38] stock what is that mechanics instead of
[27:40] Dynamics now he's doing the tricks he
[27:42] says so I want to bring out this point
[27:45] Dynamics make demons flee if you're
[27:48] living a life above sin the demons have
[27:51] have have left your life the demons have
[27:53] have have flown I don't know yeah that
[27:55] is that the word flown I need some
[27:57] grammar help up here the demons have are
[27:59] fleeing right well that proves you got
[28:02] the Dynamics praise God I hope I said
[28:05] that right by God's grace hope you can
[28:07] understand what I'm saying it's just
[28:08] like the Bible says you know sometimes
[28:11] uh you know any time where where we've
[28:14] resisted the devil the Bible says
[28:16] anytime we' resisted the devil and he
[28:18] flees that proves we've got
[28:21] Dynamics right because it's it's a
[28:23] dynamic it's a holy spirit Power that
[28:26] resists Satan
[28:28] it's two Powers fighting each other
[28:30] right like the angels we talked about
[28:31] remember when Zurg gave that good
[28:32] scripture at my house you know Daniel 10
[28:35] it's like Angels fighting and wrestling
[28:37] and when Satan finally leaves that means
[28:39] you're the Victor praise God you were
[28:41] more powerful you had more Dynamics but
[28:44] it really wasn't me it was Christ
[28:46] revealed in me praise God wasn't my
[28:49] power it was me yielding to God's
[28:53] power so see the Bible say submit
[28:55] yourselves to God when we're being
[28:57] tempted we got to yield to God obey God
[29:00] resist Satan and they'll flee from
[29:02] you so whether the the the Dynamics or
[29:05] raising the dead or giving sight to the
[29:07] blind or healing from cancer or just
[29:11] getting peace in your life Over The
[29:13] Temptations of God both all those are
[29:16] Dynamic power of
[29:18] God because they make demons flee praise
[29:21] God I've also often said this too you
[29:24] know I don't know why it's been so many
[29:26] years since I've cast out of devil but
[29:28] you know I got to say like this God
[29:29] hasn't sent me many devil possessed
[29:31] people but I want to have the faith if
[29:34] one comes in here we'll be able to do it
[29:35] by God's grace remember with Wendy and
[29:37] Jason remember that one service they
[29:39] both said it was interesting the demons
[29:40] were both on this side of the church now
[29:42] nothing against this side of the church
[29:43] okay but that morning there was
[29:46] something going on and the enemy both of
[29:47] them said the enemy was saying leave
[29:49] leave leave but God got the victory
[29:51] praise God I don't know I don't remember
[29:52] if it was in a song or the preaching or
[29:54] something but the Holy Spirit they both
[29:55] come up for prayer and God helped both
[29:57] of them praise God well what power made
[30:00] them leave it was the dynamic power of
[30:03] Jesus Christ praise
[30:04] God but in one way I'm grateful nobody
[30:07] here is possessed with demons so we
[30:08] don't have to cast them out I'm very
[30:09] grateful for that that means you got
[30:11] Dynamic power amen demons have to flee
[30:16] at the power of Christ hallelujah amen
[30:19] remember demons have a legal right to
[30:21] stay in your life and and stay
[30:23] tormenting you or haunting you until you
[30:25] confess but once you confess and yield
[30:28] to yourself to God those demons have to
[30:30] flee praise God Amen they cannot stay
[30:33] they cannot uh uh they cannot possess a
[30:36] Believer or torment a Believer because
[30:38] he whom the son has set free is free
[30:40] indeed and if you take his freedom and
[30:42] his Liberty and his laws you can drive
[30:44] out the enemy praise
[30:46] God draw night to God James 4:8 says and
[30:50] he will let's say he will ready he will
[30:52] it's an absolute promise of God come
[30:55] closer to God and God will come closer
[30:57] to to
[31:00] you cleanse your hands ye Sinners purify
[31:03] your hearts you
[31:04] double-minded amen now I believe that's
[31:06] the people that are really these people
[31:08] are really these are people are really
[31:09] in sin right here adulterers and
[31:11] adulteresses these people are really
[31:13] deep in sin James is writing to but they
[31:15] can still resist the devil and God will
[31:17] come near to them that's the mercy of
[31:20] God now I just want to read this you
[31:21] know if you haven't read this for a
[31:22] while this kind of struck me this
[31:23] morning uh about Dynamics one of the
[31:26] multitude answers said master I have
[31:28] brought unto thee my son which hath a
[31:29] dumb
[31:31] spirit and where I'm sorry wheresoever
[31:34] he taketh him he teareth him and he foth
[31:36] and naseth with his teeth and pineth
[31:38] away and I spake to thy disciples that
[31:39] they should cast him out and they could
[31:40] not he answering him said oh faith of
[31:42] generation how long shall I be with you
[31:44] how long shall I suffer you bring him
[31:46] unto
[31:47] me and they brought him unto him and
[31:50] when he saw him straight way the spirit
[31:51] tear him and he fell on the ground and
[31:53] wallowed foaming and he asked his father
[31:56] how long ago since Jesus came into him
[31:57] and he said of a child so again that
[31:59] we've had some good questions on
[32:00] demonology we don't know how this Spirit
[32:02] came in but the spirit came in when this
[32:04] child was or saying well this person was
[32:06] much smaller as a child and often times
[32:10] the demon would cast the boy into the
[32:11] fire and into the waters to try to
[32:14] destroy him see that's when you know
[32:16] there's demonic activity when people are
[32:18] trying to be hurt and Satan's trying to
[32:20] take
[32:22] lives he said but if thou can't do
[32:25] anything have compassion on us and help
[32:27] us boy he asked he he asked the right
[32:29] thing there praise God he found the
[32:31] person that could do something amen he
[32:34] has infinite possibilities Hallelujah if
[32:37] you can do anything well you come to the
[32:39] right person he can do anything praise
[32:41] God if you can do anything I like that
[32:44] see he's still open to God's will if if
[32:48] not I'm demanding my way I want my life
[32:51] to be a certain way no it's open to
[32:53] God's will praise God I heard brother R
[32:56] say it yesterday that that stadle that
[32:57] stad cleff woman who had the baby die
[32:59] and she was going to fly brother random
[33:01] over brother Ram said I had to wait to
[33:03] get a clear-cut decision from
[33:05] God he said he said he said if if the
[33:08] Lord told me to go to the president or
[33:10] graveyard and raise up JFK he said I'd
[33:12] do it he said but I can't do anything
[33:14] until I get a clear word from God and
[33:17] that's why he told all the sick people
[33:18] in that meaning he said first find God's
[33:21] will right find the will of God for your
[33:23] situation and then you can rest on that
[33:26] Hallelujah amen rest on it he said a
[33:29] clearcut decision from
[33:32] God then Jesus now look Jesus challenges
[33:35] him he says if you can do anything he
[33:36] said if you can believe look at him look
[33:39] at him put it back on his faith in other
[33:42] words I need you to believe you got to
[33:43] believe the word of God that's right if
[33:45] you can believe all things are possible
[33:47] to them him that believeth now I think
[33:49] verse 24 is like all of us right we can
[33:52] all relate to this we all know God can
[33:54] do
[33:55] it but we need God's help to believe it
[33:58] praise God Amen same for this cancer
[34:01] case for Jose's health and whatever you
[34:03] know all the requests in the room we all
[34:06] know God can do it but we still need
[34:08] God's grace to give us help that our
[34:10] faith can be raised amen amen hallelujah
[34:14] we all we all know he can but we all got
[34:16] a little human battle with unbelief amen
[34:20] the soul doesn't battle Hallelujah but
[34:22] it's a it's a mind and and and body that
[34:24] battle unbelief and so we need to cry to
[34:27] Jesus Lord help me to believe I do
[34:29] believe it but help me to believe with
[34:31] all my heart praise God amen amen what a
[34:35] beautiful picture of if and if and we we
[34:38] want to find God's Will and then God
[34:40] said now Jesus said now it's on you you
[34:43] you you said if it's on me well I'm
[34:44] going to tell you I'm putting it on
[34:46] you now it doesn't work that way everywh
[34:49] my wife my wife had a good statement the
[34:50] other night we're walking at the park on
[34:51] our date and she said you could teach a
[34:53] lesson on all the different ways God's
[34:55] God heals right and I think that's a
[34:58] good idea so in this case Jesus puts it
[35:00] on him now you've got to believe but
[35:03] remember uh in John chapter 5 Jesus just
[35:05] told that paralyzed man get up and take
[35:07] up your bed and walk he didn't ask him
[35:09] do you believe he just said take it up
[35:11] and
[35:12] walk right now we might complain and say
[35:15] well why didn't you know this person
[35:16] could have complained why is he putting
[35:17] it on me it's for a
[35:20] testimony I'll never give you a trial
[35:22] you can't handle amen hallelujah praise
[35:25] God you can over you I can do all things
[35:28] through Christ who strengthens me praise
[35:30] God sorry sorry man
[35:33] okay these aligners make it a lot harder
[35:36] to preach without spinning even at
[35:38] school I gota be
[35:40] like I love this he said all things are
[35:43] possible if you believe sometimes God
[35:45] will put it on you right like with Jacob
[35:47] why like Austin and I were texting
[35:48] yesterday why does Jacob have to wrestle
[35:50] all night and not everybody else because
[35:52] that was for his
[35:54] testimony he needed that he was going to
[35:56] be
[35:57] Abraham Isaac and Jacob he's the
[35:59] grandson of the father of faith and
[36:02] they're going to be called the the
[36:04] children of Israel a whole nation is
[36:06] going to be named after him my that's
[36:08] right he's going to have 12 sons amen
[36:12] God needs a man who's going to be a
[36:13] leader of a Nation who's going to be
[36:15] example and God gives us the example
[36:17] wrestle it out so you overcome all fear
[36:20] and get a name change Amen to be a
[36:23] prince who has power with man and God
[36:25] hallelujah
[36:28] amen it's for a
[36:31] testimony you never see Abraham having a
[36:33] wrestle all
[36:35] night that wasn't his
[36:37] testimony right each person has a
[36:39] different testimony I love that look the
[36:42] father cried out again desperation God
[36:44] will let you be desperate to bring out
[36:47] your real
[36:48] character you'll find out what you
[36:50] really are in your hardest
[36:52] moments am I going to rely on the world
[36:54] am I going to run back to the world am I
[36:56] going to run to God God a true shot of
[36:58] God will run to God it took Samson a
[37:00] while but he finally run to God it took
[37:03] Samson a lot of laps around that
[37:05] grinding mill a lot of laps a lot ofps
[37:08] but pretty soon all that complaining all
[37:10] that argu or debating whatever pretty
[37:12] soon it turned into God once more have
[37:15] mercy on me I'm now ready to pray I
[37:17] wasn't ready to pray before but now I'm
[37:20] ready hallelujah
[37:21] amen right sometimes it takes cycles of
[37:24] years and months and tri trials and
[37:27] tests and all saying the wrong thing but
[37:29] finally God's wearing you down amen so
[37:33] you stop relying on yourself I stopped
[37:35] relying on myself and we cried to God
[37:37] said God have mercy on me come again
[37:40] come back into my life praise God I
[37:43] invite you back into my life praise
[37:45] God and notice with tears he was brought
[37:47] to tears Lord I believe help my
[37:52] unbelief when Jesus saw the people he
[37:54] rebuked that foul Spirit saying thou th
[37:57] dumb and deaf spirit I charge you come
[37:59] out of him and enter no more see that's
[38:01] what I like that's I remember a brother
[38:03] Austin stood up when I preach that last
[38:05] time you know remember that brother we
[38:07] got the power we got the authority to
[38:08] say Satan you're leaving and you will
[38:10] not come
[38:11] back now he'll come back to Temp but he
[38:13] won't come back to to torment
[38:16] you glory right you'll enter no more
[38:20] he'll come back and knock and try to
[38:22] bring you that box of rattles Stakes but
[38:23] you can turn down you can slam the door
[38:25] and say Jesus is the door amen I'm
[38:29] putting Jesus between me and that box of
[38:30] rattlesnakes
[38:32] amen hallelujah Christ is the door amen
[38:35] oh I love
[38:37] that
[38:38] Hallelujah see that's what we got to do
[38:40] too we got to rebuke evil spirits when
[38:42] they come amen got to rebuke it in Jesus
[38:46] Christ's
[38:48] name whatever your testimony is going to
[38:51] be not every testimony is like this the
[38:52] spirit cried R him sore he came out and
[38:54] I've seen that I've seen that uh
[38:56] Pennsylvania also in Guyana Jesus took
[38:59] him by the hand lifted him up and he
[39:00] arose and the disciples said why can we
[39:02] not cast him out he said this kind can
[39:04] only come forth but by prayer and
[39:08] fasting okay so in this case the
[39:12] Dynamics will only come if the mechanics
[39:15] are right now that's that this is
[39:16] spiritual algebra right here church
[39:18] because we don't see casting out demons
[39:19] a lot of times so this is algebra this
[39:22] is not
[39:23] ABCs right we don't know how long Jesus
[39:26] J was fasting we don't know was it two
[39:28] days was it three meals what what was it
[39:31] we don't
[39:32] know but he was praying he was in the
[39:34] channel for healing and he wasn't
[39:37] eating and so to see the Dynamics cast
[39:40] The Devil out he's got to have the
[39:42] mechanics right
[39:44] first now think about that all the
[39:46] disciples they they were seeing all
[39:48] these Miracles they were sent two by two
[39:49] to all these cities and they were seeing
[39:51] all these Miracles but this case they
[39:52] couldn't crack because it required more
[39:56] mechanic
[39:57] mechanics more mechanics they to be more
[40:00] consecrated more focused think about
[40:01] that church and church you know what I'm
[40:02] talking about sometimes God will do
[40:04] great things and you're not even you're
[40:05] not really espcially dedicated to God
[40:07] you know what I mean he'll answer your
[40:09] prayers and thank God that's what the
[40:10] disciples were doing two by two wow
[40:12] we're seeing demons cast out but this
[40:14] one was different this required a
[40:16] greater level of mechanics God help us
[40:19] amen God help
[40:22] us for what he's called us to do God
[40:24] help us to be prepared with our
[40:26] mechanics so the Dynamics can come
[40:29] Hallelujah I just believe God will work
[40:31] out everything for his glory but we got
[40:33] to be yielded vessels as well we got to
[40:35] be led by the Holy
[40:38] Spirit now here here's one where people
[40:41] misunderstand this
[40:43] one brother raham said uh he's talking
[40:46] about how Moses how did Moses call flies
[40:48] and do all the the 10 plagues brother
[40:51] Bram said he didn't know the M mechanics
[40:53] of it he just know the Dynamics so
[40:55] preachers will some preachers not all
[40:56] some preacher will use this and say see
[40:58] we don't need the mechanics we don't
[40:59] need the word but that's not what
[41:01] brother br's talking about brother br's
[41:03] talking about the Dynamics he doesn't
[41:05] understand the mechanics of that
[41:08] Dynamics right brother doesn't know uh
[41:12] how do you explain all those flies and
[41:14] and frogs being created we don't know
[41:16] the mechanics of
[41:18] that of that
[41:20] Supernatural I don't know the mechanics
[41:22] of how the the wind blew the walls of
[41:24] water up that's what he's talking about
[41:27] see he's not he's not he's not saying
[41:29] well Moses didn't need to to write the
[41:30] law that that was the mechanics is
[41:33] everybody understanding I hope I'm I
[41:35] just hope the Holy Spirit Will Reveal to
[41:36] you he's talking about a different kind
[41:38] of mechanics
[41:39] amen think about it before they could
[41:41] get out of out of Egypt they had to have
[41:44] the mechanics of the word they had to
[41:46] slay the lamb the Passover Lamb and they
[41:48] came out of there by the blood of the
[41:50] lamb praise God just like we come out of
[41:52] the World by the blood of the lamb
[41:53] praise God so see they had the mechanics
[41:56] of the word but brother saying Moses
[41:58] doesn't know the mechanics of Miracles I
[42:01] don't know how God I don't here's here's
[42:03] a good point I don't know how God did
[42:05] the mechanics of taking the cancer out
[42:06] of my mom I don't know the mechanics of
[42:09] that right but I know the dynamic we
[42:12] know the Dynamics of it because we saw
[42:14] it praise God that's what brother saying
[42:16] we don't know mechanically how God does
[42:19] these Supernatural things but we know he
[42:21] does them so don't so some people use
[42:24] this the wrong way we got use it the
[42:26] right way that's why I want to preach
[42:28] it now again he says this is one
[42:31] misunderstood you don't know you don't
[42:32] have to know the mechanics just know the
[42:34] Dynamics the thing that Paul States it
[42:35] in other words let me say like this you
[42:37] know we all have loved ones we're
[42:38] praying for how many have loved ones
[42:39] they're praying for I don't care the
[42:42] mechanics on how God draws them whether
[42:44] it's a car accident whether it's just
[42:46] you know they're in a service and they
[42:47] weep their way they finally get a
[42:48] revelation they confess their sins I
[42:50] don't care the mechanics of how it
[42:52] happens we just want to see the Dynamics
[42:54] of it Hallelujah praise God what what
[42:58] was the mechanics that led you to Christ
[43:00] for me it was Cam's driving in Cam's car
[43:02] going to see Kristen and I left the
[43:05] Christian music in there I didn't turn
[43:06] it off that started that was the
[43:08] mechanics of it and then I went to the
[43:09] athletes and action conference the
[43:11] pastor of the chapel uh took me out to
[43:12] eat every Tuesday and he talked to me
[43:14] about the Bible that was the
[43:16] mechanics but then the Dynamics was see
[43:18] you know being there finally raising my
[43:20] hands and tears running down my face and
[43:22] me going home and getting rid of all my
[43:23] trash out of my house well most of my
[43:26] trash
[43:27] out here's the fourth
[43:29] illustration brother Ram says
[43:31] denominations are mechanics and that's
[43:35] true
[43:37] right brother br's talking about
[43:39] denominations he said look our
[43:40] educational system our denominational
[43:43] system has took the place of the Holy
[43:44] Spirit leading in the church now think
[43:45] of a Roman Catholic church or something
[43:47] they got these fine trained
[43:49] ministers and it's taken the place of
[43:52] all night prayer meetings old time way
[43:54] we used to get to God
[43:57] he says now they know the mechanics but
[43:58] they ain't the Dynamics we know the D we
[44:01] want the Dynamics I don't care about the
[44:03] mechanics I want to know the Dynamics so
[44:05] we have to understand this brother R
[44:07] saying we don't he's not saying we don't
[44:09] need the mechanics of the Bible he's
[44:11] saying we don't need mechanics of
[44:13] man-made
[44:14] denominations okay I hope you're going
[44:16] to get I need to go faster here because
[44:18] you're probably not going to remember
[44:19] all this but you're GNA remember the
[44:20] punchline hopefully he said I don't he
[44:23] said a fourth illustration denominations
[44:24] are mechanics same one okay the fifth
[44:26] one now here's a good one I
[44:29] like he's the Dynamics of the mechanics
[44:32] the mechanics of the church what is it
[44:34] Apostles prophets teachers and so forth
[44:36] and he's the Dynamics that works that
[44:38] amen hallelujah how many you ever been
[44:41] blessed by a preacher
[44:42] sermon that was the preacher did the
[44:45] mechanics the Dynamics was God's word to
[44:47] you amen
[44:49] hallelujah the can say we need pastors
[44:52] prophets teachers evangelist we also
[44:53] need the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit
[44:55] and the church said amen and sisters can
[44:57] have all nine gifts and the church said
[44:59] and brothers can have all nine gifts and
[45:01] the church said am those are all
[45:03] mechanics but then when God gets in that
[45:05] then that's Dynamics praise God amen
[45:08] amen hopefully see some Dynamics today
[45:10] amen amen some Dynamics next week when
[45:13] brother Diggs comes
[45:14] amen as simple as lives changed people
[45:18] baptized Sanctified filled with the Holy
[45:21] Ghost or healed or prophecy or Vision or
[45:24] dream or sign or Wonder or Miracle we
[45:27] just want to see God's Dynamics have
[45:29] their free course
[45:32] Hallelujah like I said on Wednesday like
[45:34] brother man said we just want to be able
[45:35] to tell people Jesus Christ is the same
[45:39] amen the the Dynamics are the same today
[45:43] that's what we want to be able to say we
[45:44] want to go to work I want to go to work
[45:46] and say God did a miracle
[45:48] yesterday I did when Austin got heal
[45:50] that migraine and different testimonies
[45:52] we've had I've gone to to work and said
[45:54] that he's the same yesterday today and
[45:58] forever praise
[46:00] God now I could read all these but you
[46:03] understand my brother R said Moses was
[46:05] at the burning bush he had all the
[46:08] mechanics but one
[46:10] day he heard a man speak out of a a a
[46:13] burning Pillar of Fire and said I am
[46:15] that I am see he had the mechanics but
[46:18] he got the Dynamics and now the
[46:20] mechanics was all the promises his mom
[46:22] had told him you were born under a sign
[46:26] there was a pillar of fire and an angel
[46:27] of the Lord brought you and then the
[46:29] angel protected you in that
[46:31] Ark brother said a n River full of
[46:34] crocodiles God protected you Amen in
[46:37] other words you shouldn't be here Moses
[46:39] but God protected you can I say it to
[46:40] you many of you shouldn't be here but
[46:43] God protected your life praise God amen
[46:46] amen the devil might have tried to
[46:48] snatch your life away but it was
[46:50] impossible God had a desire God had a
[46:53] plan Samson God had a purpose and you'll
[46:56] fulfill that purpose praise God
[47:00] Amen so he had he had mechanics all
[47:03] those promises all the Visions all the
[47:05] dreams all the prophecies but he also
[47:07] had done Dynamics the burning bush amen
[47:11] I'll tell you the the burning bush also
[47:13] gave him
[47:14] mechanics it gave him two signs you got
[47:17] the sign here leprosy well death life
[47:21] amen life and death resurrection and
[47:23] death and then he had also uh the second
[47:27] sign uh the staff praise God is that
[47:30] right the
[47:32] staff for some reason I'm a little blank
[47:34] on the Moses story right now should have
[47:36] read that last last night I was too busy
[47:39] listening to uh just once more Lord okay
[47:42] spirit and Truth now here's what I've
[47:44] always taught you and I believe this is
[47:45] right brother Ram taught it mechanics
[47:47] and Dynamics the right way are spirit
[47:49] and
[47:51] truth right Jesus said every worshipper
[47:54] has to Worship in spirit spirit and in
[47:57] truth so as I've taught having the right
[48:00] Doctrine is the truth but we we want the
[48:03] spirit to go along with that but I'm
[48:05] also an advocate you can't even have the
[48:07] right teaching unless the spirit's there
[48:09] to teach
[48:10] it because it's a gift of God teaching
[48:13] is a gift of God and the Dynamics have
[48:15] to get in that gift in order to teach
[48:16] the word
[48:18] right now here's another illustration
[48:21] the mechanics is the car and he even
[48:23] says the gasoline is the mechanics but
[48:26] he said 'th spark is a
[48:27] Dynamics he said I don't care how much
[48:29] power is in the gasoline unless there's
[48:31] a spark there to manifest that power L
[48:34] there's a power there to confirm that
[48:35] gasoline it just might as well be
[48:38] water
[48:40] Hallelujah so think about that I got my
[48:43] car fixed yesterday that was not a happy
[48:44] situation
[48:46] but you know how it is
[48:49] anyways I could have all that car but if
[48:53] I don't have the spark to fire what good
[48:55] is it
[48:56] it I've got to have the mechanics thank
[48:59] God for the mechanics I sure enjoy the
[49:01] Dynamics I enjoy driving to work and
[49:02] getting to work on time I enjoy enjoy
[49:05] driving down to preach in Junction City
[49:07] and coming back to preach up here I
[49:10] enjoy the Dynamics of it but I got to
[49:12] have the mechanics the mechanics are
[49:14] just as important as the Dynamics praise
[49:17] God and that's why we're a mature church
[49:19] we understand that but some people
[49:21] don't and that's why they get into all
[49:23] these like so-called false prophets oh
[49:25] this one this one's going to be healed
[49:27] and they die or this one's going to be
[49:28] well and they die that's that's why
[49:30] they're off the word right we all want
[49:33] to hope we all want to hope for the best
[49:35] like again I just heard more preachers
[49:36] saying this week and even Joseph
[49:37] brandham oh saying the Rapture is just
[49:39] any day now any day now now that's the
[49:41] same thing they said two years
[49:43] ago when when when are people ever going
[49:45] to wake up and be like these guys are
[49:47] not
[49:48] prophets they're speaking on their own
[49:50] yes we all want to be ready but stop
[49:52] trying to fearmonger us into believing
[49:54] the holy SP spirit will prepare us for
[49:56] the Rapture amen not some false leaders
[49:59] that have so-called gifts that lie and
[50:01] tell like they said yesterday the LIE
[50:03] yesterday was William brandham is the
[50:04] pastor of the whole world show me one
[50:06] quote where that's actually brother
[50:08] actually says that I'll tell you who's
[50:10] the pastor of the whole world it's the
[50:11] chief Shepherd Jesus
[50:13] Christ that's what the Bible says amen
[50:16] every other Pastor is a local
[50:20] pastor and I I sh I shared the quote
[50:22] with our brother see every service I got
[50:23] to lay one in like this so forgive me
[50:26] it's because this blog posts come out on
[50:28] Saturday and that's what I'm studying
[50:30] and so I'm always quick to like Lord
[50:32] give me a scripture give me a quote for
[50:33] this
[50:34] guy my brother Ram said I he said I
[50:37] never was a successful pastor and I
[50:39] never could be look it's an exact quote
[50:42] I never could be a successful Pastor so
[50:44] I asked the brother how can you guys
[50:46] have a successful church if he's your
[50:47] pastor because he said he would never be
[50:49] successful do that make sense to anybody
[50:52] I would never successfully Pastor I
[50:54] couldn't be successful than how can all
[50:56] those people around the world be
[50:57] successful they can't right I said when
[50:59] are you going to preach that
[51:00] one when are you going to share that one
[51:02] in your blog he ain't got to share
[51:05] because he's
[51:06] lying they're lying but see that that's
[51:09] my that's my apologetics of the day
[51:12] there right God gra he said the gasoline
[51:14] represents the word it's the truth but
[51:16] without the spirit it won't
[51:19] move now here's another one this is a
[51:21] good one
[51:23] too oh yeah I like this quote did I skip
[51:25] one here just bear with me no okay what
[51:27] shall I do and I haven't even gone
[51:29] through all 54 there was so many I'm
[51:30] like I have to preach it next week or
[51:32] something Wednesday night maybe because
[51:34] next Sunday brother digs is here he said
[51:36] now the religious system has turned down
[51:39] the end time message isn't that
[51:42] true as God God predicted this message
[51:45] word by word right Luke 17:30 Malachi 4
[51:49] Revelation 3 revelation 10:7 God
[51:52] foretold Malachi 45 and6 God for told it
[51:55] word by word it's on tape if they shoot
[51:57] me whatever they do it'll never stop the
[51:58] message it'll go on the same it's
[52:00] already out it's the word of the end
[52:03] thoroughly Vindicated and proved over
[52:05] and over by signs wonders Dynamics he
[52:07] said by science by the church by God
[52:09] himself has proved it's the hour both
[52:11] the word and the signs and the Wonders a
[52:14] message approved of God among you by
[52:16] signs and wonders of this hour a message
[52:18] that Jesus Christ is not
[52:21] dead but a living just the same as he
[52:24] ever was and sending forth and it
[52:26] exactly fulfills Malachi 4 and all the
[52:28] other scriptures that Jesus said would
[52:30] be in the last days is totally fulfilled
[52:32] both scientifically by the
[52:34] world so all the scriptures that brother
[52:38] man fulfilled that was the mechanics and
[52:40] then when Jesus Christ came and told
[52:42] them their names and their addresses and
[52:44] that they were well that was a Dynamics
[52:46] praise God Amen
[52:50] Hallelujah now here he switches back and
[52:53] forth in this quote on a mechanics
[52:55] uh of the seminaries but then how the
[52:57] church needs real mechanics so like I
[53:00] said there's already six or seven
[53:01] different ways you can use mechanics and
[53:03] Dynamics he said it's not a seminary
[53:06] that teaches you all the Theology and
[53:08] the Greek
[53:09] interpretations he said it's the
[53:10] Dynamics of the Holy Ghost in there to
[53:12] set that a fire and to bring it to pass
[53:15] and make it live just exactly what was
[53:17] the promised word is for this hour not
[53:19] the mechanics Dynamics but not so look
[53:21] he says not the mechanics he's speaking
[53:23] of denomination it takes mechanics and
[53:26] Dynamics the word and the spirit and the
[53:29] church said there it is John 4:24 right
[53:32] there if anybody says it's not it's
[53:34] right there you must Worship in spirit
[53:37] Dynamics and Truth
[53:39] Bible Glory they're the he said they are
[53:42] the one that gives life these two give
[53:45] life
[53:46] Hallelujah right just like you can't
[53:48] have a car without mechanics and
[53:50] Dynamics you can't have railro without
[53:51] mechanic and Dynamics you can't have the
[53:53] real Holy Ghost Church Without both
[53:55] mechanics and
[53:57] Dynamics I'm trying to get down I'm
[53:59] almost done
[54:00] here if I finish before noon it's a
[54:02] miracle by God's grace no I'm just
[54:04] kidding I shouldn't say that forgive me
[54:05] Lord I should if I finish before noon
[54:07] and we'll all be
[54:08] blessed now here's a good one this is
[54:10] the one we really like now this is one
[54:12] also preachers are confused they'll say
[54:14] the Dynamics aren't here well it depends
[54:16] what you're talking about the Dynamics
[54:18] of the nine gifts are here amen that's
[54:21] why we see signs wonders and miracles
[54:23] amen if the Dynamics wasn't here we
[54:26] wouldn't see anything Supernatural right
[54:29] we wouldn't ever get healed we never
[54:31] have a dream we never have a vision we
[54:32] never see God move supernaturally but
[54:34] the fact is there's different kinds of
[54:37] Dynamics there's Dynamics for the holy
[54:39] ghost in the church with the preaching
[54:41] gifts and the nine gifts but there's a
[54:43] Dynamics that's future to come that's
[54:45] the latter rain
[54:47] amen okay so yeah that's why it's so
[54:50] important to know all these quotes if
[54:52] not if if people only know one quote
[54:54] they won't know the the other
[54:56] side right you got to know all that's
[54:58] why it's good to search all those
[55:01] quotes if you haven't done that for a
[55:03] while do that sometime just type in
[55:05] mechanics and Dynamics read all 54
[55:06] quotes see what you find out then you'll
[55:08] know what it's like to be a preacher you
[55:11] got to sip through those and say which
[55:12] ones am I going to preach I ask God I
[55:13] don't know help me
[55:15] Jesus see like just like the latter rain
[55:17] I want to show you all the quotes
[55:18] brother R said oh we're receiving lerain
[55:20] Faith right now it's
[55:21] 1954 and the Rapture still hasn't heaven
[55:25] see you know you gota gotta got to have
[55:28] Grace you got to have humility you got
[55:29] to take everything back to the word of
[55:31] God I had a brother called me up from
[55:33] Missouri yesterday he said brother Jesse
[55:34] I've watched almost all your videos he
[55:36] said I was raised in a church in Fiji
[55:38] where they said every word was thus
[55:40] sayith the Lord he said it confused a
[55:42] lot of people he said but when we come
[55:44] to America some of us migrated over here
[55:46] I think it was I can't remember maybe
[55:49] they got Asylum I don't
[55:51] know but he said I knew he said I
[55:54] started watching your videos and I saw I
[55:56] made a video with over 60 human just
[55:58] human mistakes that brother brand on the
[55:59] tapes and the brother said he said I
[56:02] can't tell you he just talked to me on
[56:03] the phone yesterday I was driving no I
[56:05] was at home and he said brother he said
[56:08] that did so much for me because my whole
[56:10] life I was raised to believe everything
[56:11] is thus said the Lord and he said the
[56:13] way I Saw You by the Holy Spirit bring
[56:16] he just said you brought it with such
[56:17] humility you showed how brother Ram
[56:19] would correct himself many times he grow
[56:21] in Revelation and you said yet he's
[56:24] still a prophet
[56:26] you stayed with the message he said that
[56:28] did so much for me he said I was all
[56:30] worried if I preach it who's going to
[56:32] leave and he said I just watched your
[56:34] video I said I've just got to do it I've
[56:36] got to stand with the word of God like
[56:37] brother Jesse yes he said let let the
[56:40] chips fall wherever they may I've said
[56:41] that many times I don't care what people
[56:44] say I believe God's word amen yes he
[56:47] said I preached it as hard as I could
[56:49] and he said I thought people would leave
[56:50] he said only one person left he said God
[56:53] was good to us we still got most of the
[56:54] church
[56:55] I said you that's a good sign you got
[56:58] real Bible believing Christians yes amen
[57:01] right cuz Moses had sins David had sins
[57:04] Joshua Daniel everybody sinned everybody
[57:07] fall short of God's glory but there's
[57:09] one thing that won't fail that's thus
[57:11] sayeth the Lord amen
[57:13] amen so just I'm just drop dropping that
[57:16] in there to show how this you know I put
[57:17] the videos out there and God will direct
[57:19] them wherever they need to go I got even
[57:22] more uh emails this week just people
[57:23] thanking me for what what we're doing by
[57:26] the grace of God I say we because you do
[57:28] you do it you support us you support me
[57:31] now here's another thought he said the
[57:33] Council of churches now that's the image
[57:35] of the Beast right all the churches
[57:37] coming together before the Rapture
[57:39] that's the image of the
[57:41] Beast brother Braham said that image of
[57:43] the Beast needs Dynamics but he says so
[57:46] does the bride of
[57:47] Christ so this is this is Harvest Time
[57:50] church both seeds are coming to maturity
[57:54] I'm glad I can see the wheat being
[57:55] revealed to me I'm not a terar brother
[57:58] amen I'm a
[57:59] wheat brother Jose I I I really like
[58:02] these wheat grains that are growing up
[58:03] in my life here I Hallelujah as time
[58:06] goes on it's more and more revealed
[58:08] because Harvest Time proves what seed
[58:10] you are
[58:12] amen the season will reveal what seed is
[58:16] inside of you thank God we've got the
[58:17] seed of
[58:20] Christ he said there you are that hour
[58:22] that we're arrived at that big machine
[58:24] that set up they got the mechanics the
[58:26] only thing they have is Satan there with
[58:27] the Dynamics to force the marking of the
[58:29] Beast so the mark of the beast is going
[58:31] to be satanic mechanics and Dynamics to
[58:33] lay down the mark of the
[58:38] beast but let me say something this
[58:41] uniting time to see the churches uniting
[58:43] Nations uniting it's uniting time of God
[58:46] and his bride and I say this with
[58:48] reverence and respect I believe that the
[58:50] bride of Christ is
[58:52] called I believe she's sealed in the
[58:54] king kingom of God I believe the
[58:57] mechanics is there thank God we got the
[58:59] Bible they're waiting for the Dynamics
[59:02] that'll take her off the earth into
[59:04] glory in the Rapture praise God so see
[59:07] brother R clearly shows Dynamics for the
[59:10] Rapture is the latter rain I believe
[59:13] with all my heart yes sir we don't know
[59:14] how he's going to do it but he shall do
[59:16] it he is the
[59:18] Dynamics we just become members of the
[59:20] machine of his body forming ourselves
[59:23] into his image and we see him uniting
[59:25] himself with us in his works with his
[59:27] love gifts as he hands them to us just
[59:29] before the wedding supper and we're
[59:31] waiting watching for that now look at
[59:34] this what will be the latter rain the
[59:36] Dynamics of the church will be a
[59:37] refilling of the holy spirit that we've
[59:40] worked in a small measure while The
[59:42] Headstone is coming down to unite with
[59:45] the body if we've loved the small
[59:47] measure this much how much we can enjoy
[59:49] the full measure how much if we dance
[59:52] and praise God and shout and glorify God
[59:55] under something small what are we going
[59:57] to feel like when we get the real thing
[59:59] praise
[1:00:00] God oh what are we going to feel like
[1:00:03] praise God it's a new
[1:00:06] application and this is the this is the
[1:00:08] Dynamics we don't have control over
[1:00:10] remember the disciples needed to get
[1:00:12] control over their
[1:00:13] mechanics they had to fast and pray to
[1:00:16] cast out the deaf Spirit but this one we
[1:00:19] don't really have control over this this
[1:00:20] is God's control because Jesus only
[1:00:22] knows the hour and the day of the ref
[1:00:25] sure all
[1:00:27] right now we do have control over prayer
[1:00:30] and fasting for dynamic power in our
[1:00:32] daily lives and our Ministries because
[1:00:35] everybody has a ministry here let's say
[1:00:38] it out loud let's let's say I have a
[1:00:39] Ministry ready I have a minist
[1:00:41] everybody's a minister here a servant
[1:00:44] with your gifts everybody's here to
[1:00:46] serve one
[1:00:48] another now I'm just going to skip down
[1:00:51] yeah let me close this I think I got a
[1:00:52] couple more slides here I'm almost done
[1:00:56] yeah a little bit little over an hour
[1:00:57] here I'm almost
[1:00:58] done I didn't read this quote but this
[1:01:01] meant a lot to me as I went back and
[1:01:02] listen to the sermon here brother Ram
[1:01:04] said Jesus anointed every fiber of
[1:01:06] Samson's
[1:01:09] being he says always now think about
[1:01:12] this when the power of God comes in the
[1:01:14] walls that you build around fall so
[1:01:16] think of Samson he had all those walls
[1:01:18] around him that was his own fault church
[1:01:21] sometimes we have walls we feel
[1:01:23] surrounded it's our own fault fault
[1:01:25] sometimes he said but when God's spirit
[1:01:28] comes in the walls
[1:01:30] fall The Fortress around you the the
[1:01:33] insurmountable odds all the tests and
[1:01:36] trials when God's power comes in the
[1:01:38] walls start
[1:01:40] falling Hallelujah and God will be known
[1:01:44] again he's the same yesterday today and
[1:01:46] forever his every fiber filled with the
[1:01:48] Holy Ghost every muscle filled every bit
[1:01:51] of his body was just filled with the
[1:01:52] Holy Ghost that was Sam son's greatest
[1:01:55] Victory praise God what will be your and
[1:01:58] I greatest Victory when every fiber of
[1:02:00] our being is yielded to the Holy Spirit
[1:02:02] praise God when we only say what God
[1:02:05] wants us to say when we only do what
[1:02:07] God's leading us to do when we only
[1:02:09] think and meditate on the right things
[1:02:11] praise God that will be our greatest
[1:02:13] Victory can I say like this the victory
[1:02:15] in the love divine hallelujah oh my and
[1:02:18] I believe this is where Samson finally
[1:02:21] gave his heart to God before that he'd
[1:02:23] only given God his his mind and his body
[1:02:26] but he saved his heart for the
[1:02:28] women right the woman from Timnath and
[1:02:30] then it was his prostitute and then it
[1:02:32] was theath he gave his love to the women
[1:02:35] but finally when he when God now look at
[1:02:37] this God and his love had to separate
[1:02:38] him from the the addictions of of his of
[1:02:40] his of his life I'll say it like that
[1:02:43] from his real loves for his sinful loves
[1:02:45] God had to separate him very
[1:02:49] forcefully God very forcibly with eyes
[1:02:51] plucked out and embarrassed and ashamed
[1:02:53] and whipped and be beaten
[1:02:56] enslaved God had to separate him from
[1:02:58] that and then he finally gets to the
[1:03:00] spot when he's broken down he finally
[1:03:02] gets to the spot we're saying Jehovah I
[1:03:04] know you love me you're a God of Mercy
[1:03:06] remember that quote Oh Jehovah you're
[1:03:08] full of love just once more pour out
[1:03:11] your blessing on me avenge me of my eyes
[1:03:14] in other words now Lord I'm finally
[1:03:15] giving you my heart it reminds me that
[1:03:17] song Lord I give you my heart I give you
[1:03:20] my soul Hallelujah I live for you alone
[1:03:23] God had allow Samson to get such an
[1:03:25] awful place where he could finally live
[1:03:27] for God alone and in that moment he got
[1:03:31] the greatest Victory he could ever
[1:03:33] get let's stand to our feet musicians
[1:03:35] I'm going to skip past this I'm gonna go
[1:03:37] right to this last quote I heard brother
[1:03:38] Randy Sai say this he preached at cams
[1:03:40] last week and I was listening between
[1:03:43] services and he used this quote I
[1:03:44] thought well this is perfect for
[1:03:46] communion I didn't really think about
[1:03:51] it it's not noon yet praise God
[1:03:53] hallelujah
[1:03:56] so preach hour and 15 instead of hour
[1:03:58] and 30 Hallelujah you've been a great
[1:04:00] audience and Sur he love you in the Lord
[1:04:04] Brother Ram says in 1955
[1:04:06] Fellowship he's talking about Peter
[1:04:09] worried about John after the
[1:04:10] resurrection he said what is John gonna
[1:04:12] do what is John gonna do and Jesus says
[1:04:14] what is that to thee Peter follow thou
[1:04:16] me I'll take care of the rest of it you
[1:04:18] just go ahead and follow me he said
[1:04:20] that's the way it is then get back to
[1:04:22] Carefree again all right
[1:04:24] in other words Peter was worried about
[1:04:26] John and Jesus says don't worry about
[1:04:28] him just have fellowship with me just
[1:04:31] follow me right now for me it's like I
[1:04:33] can't worry about brandom Tabernacle
[1:04:36] right and as much as I love brother Cam
[1:04:38] and the Saints and brother Samuel and
[1:04:40] brother Brooks I can't worry about them
[1:04:43] I've got to follow God what is brother
[1:04:45] Brooks's life he's already 63 what
[1:04:47] what's his life going to be like Randy
[1:04:49] SC is already 70 what is his how how is
[1:04:51] the his his life going to end I can't
[1:04:53] worry about that I've got got to worry
[1:04:54] about following Christ
[1:04:56] myself see that in other words we got to
[1:04:58] get our eyes off other people we got to
[1:05:00] get our eyes on
[1:05:01] Christ and brother Ram said this is
[1:05:05] fellowship and I love what he brings out
[1:05:07] he brings out Cain now we all know Cain
[1:05:08] was a demon-possessed son of son of the
[1:05:10] serpent but he said when man when Even
[1:05:13] Adam and Eve right but but specifically
[1:05:16] when Cain when Cain left the presence of
[1:05:18] God what the Bible say he became what a
[1:05:21] Wanderer wondering about everywhere the
[1:05:23] Bible to just wander from place to place
[1:05:25] couldn't find a steady
[1:05:27] home he said what a picture that is of
[1:05:30] today when a man really gets fellowship
[1:05:32] with God he says You Won't Say I'm
[1:05:35] Baptist we just saw our Baptist friends
[1:05:37] last week you won't say I'm
[1:05:40] Methodist he goes on he just then he
[1:05:42] says no matter what church you grow to
[1:05:44] you fellowship with any group whether
[1:05:45] it's one assemblies Oneness tuness
[1:05:47] latterday Saints whatever it is just as
[1:05:48] long as you your fellowship is clean
[1:05:50] with God the Bible said the blood of
[1:05:51] Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin
[1:05:54] and then we have Fellowship one with
[1:05:55] another isn't that beautiful I hope you
[1:05:59] appreciated that that that quote meant a
[1:06:00] lot to me in other words Church there's
[1:06:02] times in all of our Lives when we feel
[1:06:03] like we're just wandering
[1:06:05] around I don't know where my life is
[1:06:08] headed we we we might wonder that I
[1:06:10] don't know where my family's headed you
[1:06:12] might wonder I don't know where our
[1:06:14] church is headed where's my you know we
[1:06:16] might think about our careers where's my
[1:06:18] career
[1:06:19] headed we might feel like we're
[1:06:21] wandering well you know what solves that
[1:06:23] fellowship with God
[1:06:26] because the type is Cain wandered away
[1:06:27] from God because he left the presence of
[1:06:29] God but when we live in the presence of
[1:06:32] God we have fellowship with God and then
[1:06:35] the peace of God which passes all
[1:06:37] understanding it rules our hearts and
[1:06:39] our minds the Bible
[1:06:41] says so who do we want to rule our Liv
[1:06:44] do we want a Wandering a tormenting
[1:06:45] Spirit or do we want the peace of God to
[1:06:47] rule Our Lives that's a good song
[1:06:48] brother you saying peace of God cover me
[1:06:50] that very appropriate for
[1:06:53] today
[1:06:54] I trust that's what you want I trust
[1:06:56] that's why you love God why you come to
[1:06:57] church while you sit through this hour
[1:06:58] and 15 minute
[1:06:59] sermon it's because you want to have
[1:07:01] fellowship with Jesus Christ it takes
[1:07:04] all the wandering out now we talk about
[1:07:06] wander but let's change the vow to
[1:07:07] instead of a a wander around to O
[1:07:10] wandering let's change it from wandering
[1:07:12] in the walking to wandering in our minds
[1:07:15] we both we got to battle both of those
[1:07:17] right my wife and I have seen this one
[1:07:19] family from this area they wander from
[1:07:21] church to church to church to church
[1:07:23] they just can't find any they every
[1:07:25] Church they go to is not good enough
[1:07:26] this pastor that Pastor they even come
[1:07:28] to our church and that's I made a little
[1:07:30] mistake when they came I apologized we
[1:07:32] talked on the phone I tried to really
[1:07:34] push them too hard in the presence of
[1:07:35] God and I
[1:07:38] apologize but that's just that's what
[1:07:39] they do they just wander from one Church
[1:07:41] to next when are you going to find a
[1:07:42] place you can just forgive and love
[1:07:45] because you're never going to find a
[1:07:46] perfect
[1:07:47] church as far as a sinless church that
[1:07:50] never makes any
[1:07:52] mistakes when you going to find that I
[1:07:54] don't want to wander in the natural
[1:07:56] neither do I want to wonderer
[1:07:59] spiritually but I want to instead I want
[1:08:01] to have fellowship with
[1:08:02] Christ there's a possibility of prayer
[1:08:05] meeting might spark a Revival praise God
[1:08:08] Amen how many love God today amen that's
[1:08:11] my symbol let's that's my that's my sign
[1:08:14] let's bow our heads for word of
[1:08:15] prayer Hallelujah Church there's a
[1:08:20] possibility the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:08:22] can have Revival a prayer meeting
[1:08:25] Fellowship might spark that
[1:08:30] Revival as we prepare for communion
[1:08:33] let's check on your
[1:08:36] mechanics that's why I to take my car in
[1:08:38] yesterday we could hear the brakes were
[1:08:42] squealing the tires were going flat
[1:08:44] every couple weeks I got to go sometimes
[1:08:46] our lives got flat tires in our lives
[1:08:50] we're not going anywhere got to get got
[1:08:52] to get it fixed got to get the mechanics
[1:08:55] fixed so the Dynamics can come
[1:08:58] back I hate to be strand on the side of
[1:09:00] a road I'll tell you that how much more
[1:09:02] should we hate to be stranded in our
[1:09:04] spiritual
[1:09:05] life but you know what solves all that
[1:09:08] fellowship with
[1:09:10] God Cain left the presence of
[1:09:14] God we should stay in the presence of
[1:09:22] God
[1:09:27] I do want to thank all the saints for
[1:09:28] coming out today I think this might be
[1:09:30] the first time in a long time we've done
[1:09:31] communion with the whole entire church
[1:09:32] is anybody missing today forgive me if I
[1:09:34] forget anybody that's not here sometimes
[1:09:36] I
[1:09:37] forget this is really nice everybody's
[1:09:41] here all the families
[1:09:44] gathered God's people are here praise
[1:09:47] God I love
[1:09:49] that it's God's family let me say it
[1:09:51] again each one of you are a miracle by
[1:09:53] God's grace
[1:09:54] each one of you are a
[1:09:56] miracle
[1:09:58] Hallelujah you know on Wednesday night I
[1:10:00] turned off the live stream if you
[1:10:01] weren't here but I prayed for a miracle
[1:10:03] for every person in this
[1:10:05] church I paid for it Thursday though I
[1:10:07] was sore and I was tired my throat
[1:10:09] really hurt on
[1:10:11] Thursday but I felt under that anointing
[1:10:13] I want to pray for every person but am
[1:10:15] and I were talking about let's believe
[1:10:17] for a miracle for every person whatever
[1:10:19] it
[1:10:20] is let's remember the Dynamics are here
[1:10:23] praise God
[1:10:25] let's keep our mechanics right until
[1:10:26] it's the time for the Dynamics can I say
[1:10:28] like
[1:10:30] that let's trust God let's believe
[1:10:34] God how many have renewed Faith by God's
[1:10:36] grace my faith has been renewed praise
[1:10:39] God my faith has been strengthened
