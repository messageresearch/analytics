Acts chapter 2. I like to start reading it verse 4 and then we'll just skip ahead a little bit by God's grace Acts chapter 2 verse four I'd like to speak on I will pour out my spirit this morning by God's grace I will pour out my spirit Acts chapter 2 verse 4. I've been mentioning I've been studying the Zuzu Street Revival so I'd like to preach a little bit on that today by God's grace Acts chapter 2 verse 4. let's read that together on three ready one two three and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance now I've had to verse 15. I'll read a little bit 15 16 and 17. for these are not drunk and as you suppose seeing it is but the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days saith God here's my title for today I will pour out of my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams may God add his Blessing to dream his word you may be seated so I have a few quotes I'd like to share so you can switch over whenever you're ready by God's grace oh thank you sir before I forget I just got a text from Brother Cam and uh next weekend I'll be preaching at brother Cam's church and we're having a Saturday night service at 6 00 pm and then a Sunday morning I believe at 10. do they do 10 30 or 10. okay so we're earlier than them wow okay and then brother Bender out will be here both services next Sunday by God's grace so look forward to that and then I believe that's the main announcements here uh like I was telling you I may have brother Simon come once a month on a Wednesday night just to give me a little break um as my voice gets really tired and so I could really use some help and then he could do some teaching as well with the young little ones you know and also brother Chris being new to the Faith by God's grace I thought we could do that so kind of and I surely enjoy Simon's Ministry and last time he preached here we got a nice comment on YouTube and the sister said she'd been emailing me now separately and she said that is exactly what I was praying about was the absolute remember when Simon preached on the absolute and she said that was just what I needed for that hour and then she's been listening to our services I think her name is uh well maybe I shouldn't say it but she didn't listen to our services and saying the Holy Spirit has been speaking to her you know exactly what she's been praying for God's been giving it to her so if God's answering their prayers for what they need I'm sure God's answering your prayers as well Hallelujah so that's the next announcement there again no second service today uh this funeral starts at 3 P.M I sent the text a little late but that's when I texted brother Vang for the address and the time and I got it back from Brother Vang and just as you probably know brother amen's home I guess he got home on Friday um I haven't heard from them other than sister Hua so I don't know if he's at the funeral today or if he won't be there or not but we're thankful for that and he may have surgery later I'm not sure I haven't got an update on how he's how his overall health is but let's keep our brother in prayer thank you each one of you thank you for going to visit him if you could thank you for praying for him those of you who could like I told brother amen if time goes on I said brother I said one of these days I'm going to be in that that bed that you're in right now right I said you're going to come visit me right if time goes off because we're all going to get sick we all may pass on if the Lord doesn't come in our lifetime he kept thanking me said oh thanks for coming thanks for coming I said well brother you're going to visit me someday too you know so we'll humble ourselves and be thankful for all God's love and all God's grace to our lives praise God so I'd like to just start here in Acts chapter two I think this was my first yeah I'd like to start there in Acts chapter two of course we're familiar with this this was the day of Pentecost and this was the birth of the church as I've been going through with my family at home and also Emma's been there a couple nights here in a row and uh this was the this was the birth of the New Testament Church this was the time when the baptism of the Holy Ghost could now fall on their souls all the time before this the Holy Ghost could only fall in their flesh but it would go away it'd fall in their mind it would go away but now the Holy Ghost could fall on their souls and now they could have a permanent anointing they could have a life that looks so different from the Old Testament and isn't that true church look at the life of Peter and Paul and James and John look how their lives were a life of Holiness my goodness Saint John lived until he was a hundred years old did he ever kill a man like David did he ever commit adultery like David no look at this life look at the testimony that this life produced praise God the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a constant presence that they have stumbling here and there well sure they stumbled on minor things you know Peter had some discrimination problems with the Gentiles Paul said the things that I hate that's what I do he would do things that he hated but it never brought such a reproach like a murder or an adultery like David or something along those lines it never brought this major reproach because now they had a a permanent presence now the spirit of God was going to be a constant companion amen that was going to be a friend that was closer than a brother praise God All Because of Jesus resurrection amen he died but then he rose Hallelujah and he said he said once I'm glorified then the Holy Ghost will be in you it'll be like uh Living Waters rushing up in out of your mouth hallelujah how many know it like that praise God Amen it's like Living Waters when it comes out it just flows out praise God it's just the spirit of God Desiring to speak to others it's the spirit of God giving God praise amen it's Fellowship between you and your heavenly father Hallelujah that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost produces Jesus says it'll be a living water praise God I'm just going to go ahead and read that in Acts 7 because it's a beautiful promise from the Lord Jesus you know brother Ray has been talking to me about this one too and I wrote about in my book as well acts 7 verse 30 I'm in the wrong chapter there it is X yep X7 37. now this is the Feast of Tabernacles Jesus was attending there in Jerusalem in verse 37. in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried saying now we'll pause right there in the book in my book there in chapter 6 on the last day of the Feast of Pentecost one of the last things they would do is they would go get water out of the pool of Siloam and they would bring it up and the people would rejoice and say they would praise God for the water that they had of the past year and then they would praise God and I'm sorry then they would ask God lord we're just going to trust you're going to give us water for the next year and church remember this natural water was a sign that they were spiritually right with God because God told them if you don't keep the word I'm cutting off the rain right so in other words this was a celebration we've been faithful to God we haven't backslid on God God's given us rain and then they would praise God and they would bring the waters up and they would say they would Rejoice thank you God for the water and Lord we're dedicating ourselves now and we're freshly dedicating ourselves that that you'll pour out your water in the next coming year and you know for most people it just became an annual tradition but when it first started it was a real important thing they were sincere now little did they know in 40 years Titus would come and destroy the whole Temple right and so this was a uh this was a a moment of rejoicing in the water and now let's finish verse 37. so they're rejoicing in the water but now Jesus cries out if any man thirsts let him come unto me and drink praise God they're rejoicing in the water thank God we have water but Jesus says I am the Living Water praise God Hallelujah they're rejoicing in the water and God's saying the real water is right here right now praise God it's God in flesh it's Emmanuel praise God the real water is in flesh hallelujah amen thank God verse 38 he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water don't you love those moments when it just feels like the Holy Ghost is Flowing out of you praise God whether you're praising God or whether you're praying or whether you're witnessing or whether you're testifying to somebody or you're singing a song don't you love those moments but you know it's just flowing out praise God Amen this is more than me praise God this is more than my Humanity can produce the spirit of God is like a living water flowing out of me praise God that's what happened that last time I preached on dance like David dance I was just praying out here and it was just flowing and brother amen said I couldn't hold it back he said the spirit of God kept blowing on him like a fire like a wind and he started shouting and crying and praising God hallelujah amen oh I appreciate those moments amen hallelujah when the spirit of God flows out of you like a living water Hallelujah you can't contain it you can't stop it God is Flowing God's speaking Hallelujah God is moving amen that's exactly what Jesus said church I'm so glad to know I can experience what Jesus talked about praise God Church we're not living by a pain and fire today right we don't want to live by a painted fire like oh it's great with the head of Pentecost but we'll just pretend like we got it today we don't have to pretend the spirit of God is the same today praise God the Holy Ghost moves in the same way he did back then he moves like water praise God Amen he moves like living water Hallelujah it is our responsibility here to drink of that water and when we drink of that water then Jesus says it'll come flowing out of us hallelujah like rivers of Living Water verse 39. but this big he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified Hallelujah so we know we know the Holy Ghost was was was there was available for for the outer core the body and the mind but the Holy Ghost had not yet come to the soul praise God but on the day of Pentecost now I'm turning back to Acts chapter 2. they were in one place in one Accord and the Holy Ghost fell and the Bible said they spoke with other tongues and I and I constantly need help reminders from my wife on this one as we talked about on Friday night at our house they were Galilean but they were actually speaking in other languages they were galling they were speaking in Galilean that's what that's how I've changed my understanding of that they were actually speaking in other languages it was unknown to them but the hears were hearing it in their own languages praise God Hallelujah so the miracle was in the speaking praise God because the Bible said the spirit gave them utterance right Hallelujah and then it's noise the brow abroad and what are they they're just saying the wonderful works of God no doubt Jesus came as the Messiah Jesus died for our sins God raised Jesus from the dead Jesus is alive Jesus is here to give out Living Water praise God because that's what he said he'd do praise God maybe they were saying come to Jesus come and receive Jesus come receive believe in Jesus Christ no doubt they were saying these things because the Living Water was now flowing out of them Church Hallelujah church we got to make sure uh complaining doesn't flow out of our lips we got to make sure uh negativity doesn't flow out of our lips praise God we've got to make sure worldiness and foolishness doesn't flow out of our lips we gotta let the spirit of God flow out of our lips praise God Amen that's what the Holy Ghost does now no we I know we all have human moments like we did last night we just joking around about these some of these funny videos and things but there comes a time we have to move past that and we got to get back into the real the real sincerity of the Gospel praise God we gotta let the Living Waters Flow out of our our lips I've said it before I'll probably say it again I'm tired of just I get tired of just seeing the humanity of Jesse Smith I want to see the deity inside of Jesse Smith flow out praise God and that's what each one of us have to do we have to get tired of just being human and just tired of The Human Experience we want a supernatural experience amen Hallelujah we can't get too comfortable with that if we do we're going to backslide and do things we wish we would not have done praise God it's our responsibility have Revival praise God and the amount of Revival is up to you your amount of Revival is up to you just like it's up to me praise God Hallelujah but here in Acts chapter 2 we see the power of unity when everybody can get in Revival at the same time that's what we want to have here by God's grace is that right that's right and so people start mocking them oh they're drunk and Peter lifts up his voice and quotes the scripture of Joel now um uh that this was my text in verse 17 it should come to pass in the last days I just love this saith God this ain't the devil saying this ain't some man declaring this this is God God says I will Hallelujah let me say that again God said I will if God says it God will do it praise God if you were I say it we might not do it we may do it we may not there can be question on it if we say it but saith God God says I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh they didn't say he didn't say just to America or just to Africa or just to Australia he said All Flesh Hallelujah saith God said I'll pour it out so if God says it he's got to back it up praise God right but we know there's conditions that God pouring it out they had to get in condition they had to go to Jerusalem that's the first condition and they had to wait that's the second condition praise God that's all they had to do go to Jerusalem and wait and once they waited after 10 days the Holy Ghost fell praise God church that's what we got to do we got to obey and wait there it is right there amen hallelujah you have to go to some certain place now you might have to if you want to shut away you got to obey God's word and you got to wait on God hallelujah and then God pours out his Spirit as we wait upon him as we obey his promises God pours out his spirit and then the Bible says exactly what happens when God does pour out of his spirit look at this three things I was just meditating on this the last few weeks verse verse 17. I'm skipping down a few lines I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and what will you see happen your sons and your daughters now this was spoken to Joel so Joel was speaking to the Jewish sons and daughters in other words the next Generations what are you going to see when the Holy Spirit gets poured out on you he says you're going to see prophecy you're going to see Visions young men sure see visions and old men shall dream dreams a church you and I have a right then if God says this you and I have a right to say Lord back up your word Lord you said you'd pour out prophecies visions and dreams Hallelujah every believer has the right to go to God and say God you said this you said you never leave me nor forsake me you said you're not a liar you said you're faithful you say you answered prayer we have every right to go to God and say God you promised this and I want to experience this praise God all right is that right Church now the same is true though for uh the The Sovereign hand of God we also have to understand God has a time and season the Holy Ghost could not have fallen on the ninth day it could not have fallen on the eight or now we think the seventh oh seven is completion it's gonna fall in the seventh day no it had to fulfill a different type it wasn't seven it was 50. 50. Pentecost 50. there's a certain time in certain place but what God does is God gets us in the channel to start crying out for the promise of God when it's about his time to pour it out Hallelujah that's what the Bible says in the days of Moses the first Exodus came because they started crying out Lord Deliver Us Deliver Us From Slavery they started crying out remember your promises you told Abraham you told the prophet we'd go back to Israel you said it you said it and eventually God raised up a Moses amen but what if you're in the generation that didn't see Moses you still cry out to God you still ask God to keep his word here we are we're what three generations for brother Branham and they've all been crying out I'm going to show you the history they've all been crying out for Jesus to come back was there a life was there life a waste absolutely not they were in the season of Jesus's coming praise God they said we're not in the sixth age we're not in the fifth age we're in the last age praise God we're in the age where Jesus is returning so we should sense that and we should cry out to God Lord let me be ready for your coming I sense I sense the spirit of God is moving to for me to draw night to you Lord fulfill your promises amen so there's been a few prophecies you know we've seen over the years you know when we uh when brother Bang's dad got healed I remember I looked I point out there and I said he's going to come out of that hospital completely well in the name of Jesus Christ and he did two weeks later I didn't say thus saith the Lord I just spoke it right when uh it was Beatrice Naomi when Zion was transverse they said it's going to be all right and it was all right the spirit of God doesn't lie Hallelujah so see our prophecies may not all come with us saith the Lord but God does tell us what's going to happen praise God I remember brother Brooks in 2013 brother Brook said many or numerous uh famous message preachers are going to die this year and it happened five I counted five major ones died that year he said the spirit of the Lord told me that he didn't say thou saith the Lord but he said the spirit Lord told me that the Bible says when the spirit gets poured out you will prophesy but then the Bible just says do you all prophesy so not everybody's going to prophesy but there's going to be prophecies Among Us praise God Hallelujah in other words the Holy Spirit Will foretell something in advance that's what I think what happened to you brother Chris the Holy Spirit showed you're going to get the job at Walmart right before you got it before you got it it'll prophesy it'll tell you things to come praise God when it gets poured out it will foretell the future in the book of Acts if foretold the famine in Jerusalem right so the Saints could send food and and drink to the Saints there so they didn't die during the dearth it's called a dearth or a famine that's an example right so if the Holy Spirit told you oh there's going to be a recession save up your money or do this or that that could be a very real possibility today the Holy Spirit could warn people of those things now we know there's a recession like every 15 or 20 years you know maybe sometimes seven or eight years there's always a recession but the Holy Spirit Will Never Lie praise God when he pours out his Spirit you'll prophesy anybody else remember any prophecies you've had in your life where you knew there were prophecies you're going to come to pass anybody want to raise your hand in charity that have already come to pass you've seen them coming to pass Austin that's right mccath yes amen let's say praise the Lord can we praise that's right brother that's exactly right Hallelujah that's kind of like what happened to my mom with cancer the the friend came in and she said Ruby the Lord told me you're going to be made well and quote Psalm 118 Verse 17. I shall live and not die and declare the works of the Lord amen it's a prophecy I will not die I'll live and declare the works of the Lord so the Bible doesn't tell us how much prophecy will get but the Bible tells us not all our Prophets and so the Bible says when you get the Holy Ghost poured out you'll prophesy there will be prophecies amongst the people praise God think about brother Brown's Ministry he's told us numerous things to come in the name of the Lord right he's told us about the World Council of churches I was listening to it yesterday uniting with the American government now we haven't seen that rise up recently but we believe it's going to come where the churches will control politics and they'll move the politicians to change laws and then once they change their laws that latter rain is going to fall that's what we're told by brother Brandon that's why we watch the news that's why I watch the lawmakers that's why I pray for the government because that's what brother man told us the spirit of God told him that said pick up your pen and write he said he said the bride will be forced to stop preaching me here we are preaching so that how can these preachers say there's nothing left to be fulfilled they just don't they haven't studied enough I don't know what's wrong they haven't prayed enough they haven't started enough I don't know but there's definitely more to be fulfilled chronovirus was a pestilence are there more pestilences we'll see it's burnt pains it's got to get closer and closer each time to laying down in the mark of the beast but one thing's for sure we know Jesus will be with us in the midst of the birth pains praise God he cannot forsake his his own he said I've got proof on the red letters he said I'll be with you to the end of the world praise God I'm not going to give up at the event right before the end he said I'll be with you to the end Hallelujah he's faithful praise God he keeps his promise Hallelujah and then Jesus says he said these signs shall follow them that believe let's go back there to Luke 16. now this is the verse the NIV takes out I'm sorry Mark 16. I said Luke 16. I met mark 16. I know they put a little footnote at the bottom and it mentions these verses but they still take it out of their Bible they don't recognize it as it's inspired verse 15 Luke 16 verse 15. and he said to them go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creatures that's for Apostles right women aren't called to preach and pastors aren't called to be apostles Apostles a certain gift to go to places where they don't have churches and make converts and start churches verse 16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved how many how many know you're saved here today you've been baptized you're saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs are bother them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils how many have ever seen a devil cast out break your hand couple yeah I've seen it numerous times first time I saw it was in The Message Church it was on a Wednesday night the organ player was a woman she come back here and cast The Devil out of some man and he looked totally different afterwards he was crying weeping delivered because of that I've seen it uh once in Pennsylvania and I've seen it six times there in Guyana where literally saw the people go from like either being all confused and and burdened and angry just to being joyful and free right they're countenance changes right and the demon leaves these signs for all them that believe in my name they shall cast out Devils see in the name of Jesus Christ they shall speak with new tongues right many of us were here when sister Naomi spoke with that new tongue praise God right I've been other churches of brother cams and other churches down in South Africa where I heard speaking in tongues most times it was interpreted not every time but we pray for the interpretation see God will move on someone and he'll speak in a new language he'll speak in a new tongue sometimes the message is for the people sometimes the Bible says they're speaking a mystery in the spirit praise God some spiritual mystery it's hard to understand that when they're speaking some mystery praise God sometime that's just to edify the person who's speaking in tongues God knows they're weak or God knows they're struggling God knows they need something so God's got to send them a tongue to edify them and make them feel stronger praise God God knows what we have need of and God's faithful to give us what we have need of God knows we need experiences with him so he provides them praise God because he promised he would he promised he would Hallelujah they shall take up serpents now that's of course speaking of Saint Paul when he had took up the serpent and didn't know it he was carrying sticks the serpent bit him he threw it off in the fire and all the uh all the Islanders thought he was a God he said no I'm just a man so he had to assure them it was just the power of God right but we're not like those in Alabama or Mississippi where they actually bring poisonous snakes in there they got to pray up and make sure they're holy enough and if they get bit then that and they they're well that proves that they're they're born again well how many people have died you know how many people how many preachers have died from that that's the wrong application of this don't they even know what Jesus said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God hallelujah but if it happens you get bit by a serpent in the service of the Lord you'll cast it off and it shall not harm you that's right if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them so there's I can't think of a new testament example of that but there's an Old Testament example of that in second Kings chapter four we're not going to read that today and then the next one they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover how many have laid their hands on someone and they got well praise God anyone else any other hands okay so this is what Jesus Promised Hallelujah this is his last commission to the church Hallelujah and he said I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh praise God it's his promise saith God and God doesn't lie God's here to pour out his Spirit praise God amen Hallelujah brother man says Mark 16 is the true church in action he said there is not another church Hallelujah God hallelujah we're so glad to be a part of that church praise God and the burden today is you got you and I got to find our place in that church which one is which one is God anointing you for to prophesy to see a vision to dream a dream like the more I think about it when I got the holy ghost that hadn't been a vision because I've never had an experience like that before I'm just standing up there crying praising God and I see them pound the nails in Jesus's hand on the cross and they raise him up and I just see the side sideway view of them like this I see the sideway View and I'm just I'm just so burdened I'm so hurt but I'm so thankful that Jesus Is My Savior I just spend a few minutes praising God and I leave that church and shaking the people's hands just with so much love I just feel like I want to love everybody praise God and I've been a different person since that service praise God but the Bible says when I pour out my spirit you'll prophesy you'll see Visions you'll dream dreams how many had a spiritual how many has ever had a spiritual dream before come to pass right absolutely this follows those that get the spirit poured out on them praise God it's exactly right the true church in action I've been feeling burdened to preach this again by God's grace I just want to make sure I don't miss any of my notes Here Sometimes they come right in at the right time now I don't know uh when I asked a few weeks ago I don't think anybody had read on Azusa Street right right if you read any any writing on Azusa Street is anybody or anything no okay so this is going to be all fresh so everybody can leave this service saying I heard something new today brother Jesse didn't repeat his old sermon I rarely do that anyway sometimes I'll post sections but brother Adam said there was hope at the beginning of this church age around 1906. he said this age started after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must be a necessity be a return of dynamic power now that's what we need more of today praise God right how many want more Dynamic power right like I'm thankful that the sick recover but I'd like to see more miracles praise God would you more new tongues more Devils being cast out but I'll say it like this it's a good sign we don't have more Devils cast out because that proves you don't have devils then we got to clean out Church I'm glad I don't have to cast The Devil out of you because that means you got the devil out yourself right you didn't let it come in and build it up and let it build this complex and and then you're you're all uh carried away with devilish thoughts thank God Amen but how many believe in casting out devils oh yeah I never forget when uh remember Wendy was here she was sitting right on that road right about where uh Jose was and that brother from Illyria what was his name Jason thank you honey this is always my second brain but I preach and they both come up and said the devil is whispering in both of their ears that they need to leave the service and I prayed and the brother said the devil is cast out I think when he said while the preaching was going on that devil was cast out of her mind the spirit just left that's just a moderate example how right right brother Chris you can come into the service and have we talk about this on the text you can have all kinds of Mind battles but you got to press through that and say Satan get behind me you got to point Satan the Bible says this Satan you're a liar God tells the truth all the time amen every word of God is yea and amen that's an example where devils are cast out in the mind battles right and there's not these people weren't demon-possessed because we all have mind battles but Satan is President trying to get two people out of the service and so we've got to preach the word of God and the Holy Spirit will fight for his people praise God the Holy Ghost came to battle today praise God Hallelujah the Holy Ghost came to fight for you Hallelujah it's exactly right church amen amen God's here to fight for you praise God he won't let you be taken over he won't let you fall praise God he won't let you be lost he's the Savior praise God put on the helmet of salvation Hallelujah thank you Jesus see Dynamic power it's your brother Crystal we want to see see more of it you've been with us for a few months over the years we see Dynamic power from time to time where something instant happens we believe in it we're trusting God to do it Hallelujah and you hang around long enough you're going to see it brother praise God you're going to see it the believer sends this in their spirits and began what they begin to do crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century does this sound familiar to anybody this is does this sound like brother Brown's message is to turn our hearts back to what we've been taking notes she's been saying amen hallelujah that's exactly what they were feeling a hundred and fifteen or so years ago the same thing we're feeling it it should be time for the Lord to come we need we need pot we need Dynamic power just like the book of Acts amen so what do we do do we sit sit around do nothing about it no we've got to cry out to God for it that's what we need to do today praise God I'm gonna make time we can do it today I'm going to try not to preach too long usually preach hour and a half I'm not trying not to preach an hour and a half that's why I set a timer I'm already at half an hour already so all right ah busy body back there now just just good just so you know I'm good I'm going to get to this but the Holy Ghost fell in Los Angeles in 1906. but they had been praying for Revival for at least two years because they heard about Evan Roberts Revival in Wales and some of the men traveled from the U.S to Wales to learn from Evan Roberts how the Holy Ghost how the Holy Ghost fell and you know what he said they had house prayer meetings so who's going to open up your house this week so we can have a prayer meeting now we laugh but if one of you do it and if I do it who's all going to come now we know second shifters can't come well so what do we do not have any prayer meetings I don't know I have a prayer meeting as I've announced it before I have a prayer meeting before and after every service if you want to be a part of it I've been having that for years now prayer meetings just calling on God right every Wednesday night there's a prayer meeting every Wednesday night see It's gotta we gotta begin to sense that Christ is coming we want the same Holy Ghost they had in the book of Acts so we got to cry out for it praise God and so far this this month I've just I've just prayed three extra hours just for the power of the Holy Ghost I'm keeping track because they kept track Azusa Street kept track they prayed five that man prayed five hours every day and right before it fell he started going to seven hours every day so I know I'm not I I know I'm not just going to wake up one day sister lean and say well I feel like praying five hours today that ain't gonna happen make it happen we gotta we gotta slowly work ourselves into that praise God we have to have a burden now let me let me show this balance to it too the man that did that had no job he was living on handouts brother Seymour so he had all the Time in the World to pray you and I don't so we got to pray with the time that we got he was living off a handouts he was basically now some people might say that he was bumming off one of the church members he was just living in a church member's house he didn't have a job so I'm going to tell kind of tell that story he was a rejected preacher and so somebody had mercy on him let him into their house and so he's like I know God sent me here I'm just going to devote I'm going to have a season of Prayer and so he prayed from February March April so about about after about two and a half months the Holy Ghost fell in a powerful way now if I said let's pray for two and a half months everybody pray one hour per day who could do it who could do it see it takes a real leading of God it takes God leading you to do it right it has to be God's time and season but Who's Crying Out Among Us who's crying out for God to pour out a spear that's what we got to get to now what seemed to be the answer came now remember they want to return to the book of Acts Church as many began to speak in tongues and manifest the gifts of the Spirit now from what I've read and seen on documentaries is that when the tongues came they were interpreted but then different things I read make it sound like Maybe not maybe as the Revival went on there was just unknown tongues and no interpretation it's kind of hard to know I got to dig into some more personal journals and Diaries of the people that were there but right now I've just read dictionaries and different things and watched some documentaries on it it was then believed that this was indeed the long restored or long-awaited restoration of the of the book of Acts it was not for the latter rain can come only after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain the latter rain then is the Harvest rain how could this be the real thing when the teaching rate had not come now listen the prophet messenger brother Branham who was dissent to what was he taught to do teach what was he said to do teach brother man was sent to teach that's what this message is this message is a school Master Amen to bring me to Christ Hallelujah that's what the tapes are that's what the books are the books are tapes or so our school Masters to teach us to seek the Holy Ghost and be ready for the Rapture praise God yes there's anointing on those tapes there's anointing on brother Seymour's Journal if you read there's anointing on Evan Roberts Journal praise God because they're anointed men of God the prophet messenger was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and the final quickening unto the Rapture had not come but brother man showed us it was Return of the gifts of the Spirit right that's what it was it was a return of the gifts people now see church this tells us if we want to see gifts we got to pray more that's what this teaches us when we sense God wants to move and God is fulfilling his word right now and I don't want to miss it I don't want to be a part of it we got to give ourselves into a season of Prayer praise God was doing something great God was restoring the gifts of the Holy Spirit praise God it was a great thing now later on here here's this is what Brother Brad means because what from what I've read later on it was a mixture of unrighteous partaking a spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we as we have kept pointing out to you now what does this mean some of those people were unrighteous in the Azusa Street meetings and the revivals around them in other words some of them just came to get an experience and then they'd start a denomination everybody understand uh even history records that some people came to that Revival just to become popular so they could say they spoke with tongues and then get a following just like it is today people just try to get popular on Instagram just they can get a following that's all they want is to be followed so that was the unrighteous part of it the unrighteous part was I just want to speak in tongues or I just want to see a miracle I just want to be there so people can follow me so I can become famous that's the wrong motive the wrong motive is I wouldn't have experience with God so God can use me whether good or bad or whether rich or poor right like the marriage vow whether rich or poor no matter whether they're healthy or not healthy so God can use me for his glory praise God now later on as I'll show here witches started going into their meetings mediums and they would pretend to speak in tongues to distract the people and Seymour didn't catch it right away and so the the mediums would speak in tongues and distract and do other things and it would distract from the real move of God now we all say we all say we want Revival how many say want Revival but look if we ask for Revival Satan's going to come fight us really hard now don't raise your hands but how many want witches to come in here right see along with Revival comes tests and trials right and from what it says Seymour didn't he didn't rebuke them and send them out right away because maybe he didn't know he didn't maybe wasn't praying enough about it maybe they start to Backside a little bit I don't know but brother man it misses everybody can see at least one unrighteous thing was all the denominations that came out of it and the initial evidence of tongues that was an unrighteous thing because anybody can interpret anybody can impersonate a tongue any devil can speak in tongues and impersonate it right but God has a real tongue thank God for that but Satan impersonates that in an unrighteous way and a real person that speaks in tongues well again after that they'll live a life that's worthy of the Gospel praise God but you had a lot of people there that would speak in tongues and try to get rich off it and start their own denomination well I was at Azusa follow me I spoke in tongues and what does it produce it's produced what we got now a bunch of a bunch of nonsense in the Bethel movement the Hillsong just speak in tongues and you got it nonsense right the charismatics and uh just speak in tongues and you're filled with the Holy Ghost and you can live any way you want that's a bunch of nonsense the real thing is what they had Seymour was taught in the second work of Grace sanctification Hallelujah he was trained under a Wesleyan movement and learned sanctification Church they didn't even wear wedding rings right and so I'm listening I'm like whoa look how far they went but then you I see some of their other false doctrines later so I'm like I'll see it's just a it's a liberty it's a wedding ring is a Christian Liberty they wouldn't allow necklaces they wouldn't allow nothing super strict I mean they were super legalistic strict now are they free to have that yes they're free to have their liberty no doubt but he knew justification and sanctification Seymour did now I'm going to get to that in a little bit hopefully in this movement also was devil Powers men were under the control of devils and yet no one seemed to realize it like we said with the mediums and then with these preachers those false preachers who came in there just to say they were there and then lead people astray and then later Church what I mean is that some of them would then get arrested for doing wicked things later you know sexual sins or money laundering or something like that yet they were there to zoos in they spoke with tongues see so the devil that's what the devil does when God pours out a real blessing Satan comes to break it up you've seen in your life you have uh some season of great time with God and all of a sudden here comes all the trials right like we just had a good season of Dancing and look what happens season of death and morning sickness right after I mean right after we're dancing around here praising God love these are the best Services we've ever had right Haven perfect timing everybody's the best services in all my it's just going to get greater and greater and then tragedy comes loss comes mourning comes two days after two days after but we were warned by the Holy Spirit and God wants us to be faithful in every season then to prove that the tongues as evidence was not real these people even before a second generation had appeared organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did the main man that did this was Charles parnam now he got arrested at the end of his life which was not a good thing but he's the one that he said there's three works of Grace but that third one is speaking in tongues okay and so William Seymour learned from him but I mean that was just a few years after Pentecost they set up these doctrines you've got to speak in tongues see forcing people and that's what Seymour said Seymour is the one that said that we've got to seek the giver and not the gifts we don't seek a tongue we don't seek a miracle we see Christ Hallelujah and then Christ gives us what we have need of then Christ shows us what gifts are in our lives what about the true seed you've heard me read this probably 50 times if you've been here a while it will happen just as we have said the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger this age brother Ram's message in the bride will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning that is thus saith the Lord I just love reading that praise God Amen I told brother amen one day I want to get that on those plastic letters I want to put it right up here on the wall the Holy Ghost is going to bring us right back to Pentecost it's thus save the Lord praise God Hallelujah I'm going back there and after I go back there I'm going up praise God we've got to go back if we want to go up it's the saith the Lord praise God we got to have what they have on the day of Pentecost so like when I got the Holy Ghost let me compare it to the dead Pentecost and the day of Pentecost they went and sold everything they had because they had a bunch of poor Christians but when I got the Holy Ghost nobody sold out their house and gave me money because I wasn't poor because nobody was poor in the church right so we can't say it has to match everything has to match perfectly because they're we're in a different age we're in an age of rich and increased with goods and people say they have no need of the Holy Ghost what a bunch of nonsense if anybody needs the Holy Ghost we need the Holy Ghost praise God Hallelujah I'm just showing you when I got the Holy Ghost nobody said okay now I'm going to go sell my third home I want to help you out really Jesse now what is that that's okay they didn't have to I had a job I'm sorry I had a school school scholarship yeah I had a job but see the Holy Ghost is going to take us right back to the spirit of love that they had on the day of Pentecost that's where we're going back to and the dynamic power and the right doctor all the fullness of Pentecost not a portion of Pentecost everybody say the phone it's ready though say it again duh the fullness of Pentecost will be in us hallelujah that's what I lived my life for that's what I'm expecting that's what I'm preaching for that's what I'm praying for That's What I'm Living For living for that's what I'll die for praise God if I live long enough to die hopefully hopefully I lived long enough to live so I don't have to die Hallelujah so see church what do we got to have what do they have their Spirits were crying out for more of God that's what we got to have they had two works of Grace they had justification they had sanctification but they said we need more than this praise God now I know we preached that too but in each one of our Lives God knows where each one of us are at I know I've cried out for the Holy Ghost I'd spend an hour up there in my college room just screaming and shouting and singing asking God for the Holy Ghost I go to the Altar and ask God for the Holy Ghost I spend a lot of time seeking the Holy Ghost I've cried out for it I still cry out for it praise God I haven't stopped crying out for it amen every service I cry out for praise God that's what each one of us have to do we have to desire the gifts or the moving of the spirit they thought they were getting the they thought they were getting the latter rain before the Rapture but it wasn't time yet thank God there wasn't time because you and I had to come on the scene God was gracious to us Church they had power they could have gone the Rapture they had power there was blind people that were giving their sight back in those meetings now which one of us have seen that rare but that seems like Pentecost right a paralyzed man walking and leaping instant healing Dynamic power everybody say Dynamic power ready Dynamic that's what the Holy Ghost brings Dynamic power see they could have it could have been but God knew they had more time right don't you think don't you think on the day of Pentecost with Peter and Mary don't you think they would have had the Holy Ghost to go into Rapture could they have had rapturing faith of course they're the standard but it wasn't God's time for it that's why I I really think I really think critical of people that are critical of Azusa Street because it was God pouring out a great Revival they just haven't read about it if they say bad things about Azusa it's because they haven't read about it these people let me ask them when was The Last Time You Prayed five hours a day message preacher or whoever you think you are that you think you're so great when was The Last Time You Prayed five hours in a week and the church said huh when was the last time you had uh three services a day for even one week yet alone for three years like they had and you're so spiritual you can look down on Azusa you don't they don't really know they don't know nothing about Azusa Street they're just as if they're a preacher or they're a pastor they're just trying to get money and and live their best life now that's what they're trying to do I better stop there I'm being real critical here but you understand right there's a few There Be Few there be preachers that find it praise God Jesus and few people will find the narrow road that leads to eternal life praise God but blessed are guys when you see the way to eternal life blessed are your ears when you hear the way to eternal life now brother Adam says this it was like on the day of Pentecost it was like God planting a tree that was the church was like a tree now when God not when this tree that God planted it was to Bear nine different gifts of the Spirit nine kinds of fruit nine different kinds which means nine spiritual gifts nine gifts of the Spirit to go with the nine spiritual gifts that was God's tree he planted it in the Earth on the day of Pentecost I'm just going to skip ahead I'm just going to skip ahead here let me just go to the history here yeah let me just skip ahead that's all good and maybe I'll preach that Wednesday okay but let me just skip ahead because I got a lot of I got a lot of research yet to do on the Susan Street revive now I have I have one uh dictionary and I have numerous YouTube videos I got another book I just haven't read it and put it up here so I have two books and like four or five YouTube videos now the Revival only lasted about seven years I think of that brother Brandon said a preacher could last his Revival lasts for about three years in other words that preacher remained on fire for about three years but then he just has to live off that Revival the rest of his rest of his life in other words he keeps getting greater now I've seen it I could name some message evangelists that for a few years oh that's getting more and more and more excitement around the ministry but now it's just kind of leveled off I could name some up here but I'm not going to do that because I'm on live YouTube live stream I've seen in my life well for about three years there I kept getting more and more invitations my wife and I we traveled all over the place my my Ministry kept getting more and more accepted and then just kind of cooled off now it happens every preacher right if you really that a god you'll just go higher and higher and higher then then he's got a message you just got to live off that Revival you gotta stir yourself up stay in the spirit keep all the sin out of your life you get a reputation off what God did in that three-year Revival span that's what that's what that's what Seymour did too now before the Revival though all these subjects were being preached for years God's returning us to the New Testament glory amen expect the latter rain expect God to uh that the return to the apostolic faith once delivered to the apostles Jude 1 verse 3. you can experience overcoming life you can have personal Holiness you could have sanctification the Pentecostal baptism of the Full Gospel you can have that and there was a book even written but wrote about it in 1870 about the three works of Grace Hallelujah and they started using the Scofield bible because the Scofield bible points to a pre uh Millennial Rapture I'm sorry no pre-tribulation rapture he was very influential in showing people the Rapture takes place before the tribulation period now Los Angeles had heard of Evan Roberts 1904 Revival in Wales for the past two years and they established prayer meetings because that's how it started Evan Roberts now I I watched a documentary on him he said the Lord Jesus appeared to him like every day for a month preparing him to start praying for the Revival that's that's what the video said I don't know if that's real or not but then he started he was a co-worker coal miner worker he had to leave the coal miner worker job and then he enrolled in a seminary so he because God Jesus was visiting and he devoted his time to prayer remember church this is the prayer he prayed Lord send the Holy Ghost more powerful he said Lord send the Holy Ghost to Wales for your sake you've heard me say that before haven't you Lord send the Holy Ghost to Akron for your sake and his other prayer was Lord Ben me in other words I'm stiff and I'm just a human bend me make me flexible help me to move by your spirit that was his prayer bend me that's why I like that song mold me how about this break me break me in my bad habits right break me of my unbelief mold me shake me how about this one fill me praise God right now I'm filled with uh discouragement right now I'm filled with doubt or fears fill me with the Holy Ghost instead praise God so see word spreads when there's a Revival word spreads right most of you know I got saved in that Lima Ohio Revival everybody almost everyone in the message heard about that we've gone to different places and they said oh are you part of that you better believe I was part of that Hallelujah that's one of the preachers that come out of that Revival Hallelujah see when the when God moves people hear about it and it gets exciting it spreads see and what was the cause of that Revival brother Craig brother Brooks and brother Dave were praying Simon was praying for Revelation Simon was seeking God in the prayer closet for months brother Brooks was fasting for Revival and they got the Revival praise God Hallelujah oh it's beautiful now William Seymour was the leader of the Zuzu Street Revival uh when he had polio and he lost sight in one eye so in some one of these pictures you might see him like his eyes like kind of glazed over so he was a one-eyed preacher when I preacher now he sat under Charles parnam who taught the third work of Grace was the evidence of tongues now what's interesting he preached this even though he never spoke in tongues he believed it now church that gives us a little bit of insight if we want Revival we still got to preach it even if we haven't seen it the church said if we want Miracles if we want more gifts of the Spirit if we want more faith we've got to preach it until we get it praise God to preach it to bring the people up into the faith expectation I want more of God I want to see more of God Holy Spirit flow through me today praise God to preach it the people got to be under expectation so there's a picture there's William Seymour uh I think that's his bad eye because he's got his right eye that's the bad eye I don't know any of these guys well that's a that's Charles partner he was a guy that taught three works of Grace So William Seymour sat under him now there was segregation in those days Seymour enrolled in his school but he was because he's black he wasn't allowed to sit in the room he had to sit in the room across the hall and listen but he was so hungry for God he even he even did that anybody know who that is say it out loud anybody knows FF Bosworth Hallelujah Christ's the Healer he wrote that book Christ the Healer president said FF Bosworth he says one of those oak trees he said go sit under that oak tree get some shade he said learn under FF bosma so guess who was at Azusa Street who did FF Bosworth come out of retirement to follow well who did FF Bosworth come out of retirement to follow brother Branham to see Church Our Roots go all the way back to Pentecost Hallelujah sorry to lose the street and then they go all the way back to Pentecost Hallelujah I can trace my spiritual Roots all the way back to Azusa Street right William C Moore FF Bosworth brother Branham Tom Brown Isaiah Brooks and then me I can chase it all the way back to zoosa Street and in one way I was there right in the mind of God I was there I was a part of the family of God hallelujah in other words brother says you're identified with that you you like that event you appreciate that event the spirit of God that was there is now in you praise God and the spirit of God that was there is producing the same life in your life that it manifested in that Revival praise God Hallelujah see more they say wasn't a shouter he was a teacher he they say he talked real slow he would just talk talk preach teach the scriptures but then the Holy Ghost would rush you down and they'd rush to the altar or they'd raise their hands and start praising God and have a healing service or so it was either it was either a healing service a Salvation service or a sanctification service or a holy ghost feeling service three services a day for three years and I physically get tired after just a one weekend of services we'll have a Friday night a couple years ago we had a Friday night two Saturday and one Sunday I'm exhausted after four now of course I'm in I'm like singing every service or preaching or praying every service I get exhausted after four services that's just four their weekends had Friday three right Saturday three Sunday three that's nine they had nine in the time we had four and they kept going why because it's Revival they're under anointing for Revival they want more of this they're seeing it change lives they're seeing a reality of a living God praise God they were under the expected my brother amen would preach they're under the expectation for God to move and God was moving because they prayed for all that time they thought the Rapture was coming you know one of the false doctrines that split the church was that some of the sisters said in the church we're not supposed to marry because the Rapture is too close why should we marry our kids won't go in the Rapture did you know that was one of the false doctrines that split the church so see church we can't all we can't look at the Jews and say oh it's perfect it wasn't perfect and look what look what doctor and Satan use oh the rapture's coming don't get married we'll uh Seymour went and got married then two years after the Revival started to just improve it was okay to be married and pretty soon those sisters and one of the sisters wanted to marry him that's why she left well there's brother Seymour a real man of God and church he was different than all other preachers because he left blacks and whites come together and praise God remember part of them separated them because it was you know that was the age of the the segregation laws separate bathrooms separate schools separate water fountains but Seymour said we're breaking down all those walls that's why God honored him praise God he had the unity of the Holy Spirit see because he couldn't see that in the Bible where in the Bible do you separate Jews and gentiles Hallelujah and we're all Gentiles here right right so the white the white people were separating Gentiles when the Bible never says to separate gentiles see it was just Satan in a different form Satan would attack Jew Gentile when I was Satan dividing gentiles save Satan same liar same deceiver same divider but God's a great unifier Hallelujah amen so there's that Bosworth he was the same one that Azusa Street there so here's where the prayer meeting started just this Bonnie Ray Street in California now Seymour was living in another house I think but then they started they had uh they caught it Cottage prayer meetings I'm almost at my hour okay and so when the Holy Ghost first fell it was at this house so let me keep moving on here the Revival was the result of house prayer meetings at that house Bonnie Bray Street it was on a Monday night the Holy Ghost fell so teachers don't limit God has got to come on Sunday morning it can come any night of the week April 9th well the man was born what April thank you it was April 9th was it six okay my dad was born the fourth okay brother Brad was born in the six okay at a prayer meeting Edward Lena Edward Lee was the man who let Seymour move in with him after Seymour traveled from Texas uh he got invited to come be the pastor of a woman a woman's Church a woman pastor's Church said I feel the Lord to have you come he spent the whole weekend preaching on three works of Grace tongues of the evidence he went out to get lunch he'd come back and they locked the door and he got locked out of his own church he just preached a few services and so this Edward Lee had mercy and said I'll just you're a preacher no no money no food no job just come and live with me but then Edward Lee saw Seymour go down to his knees and start praying five hours every single day and then he started praying with him Edward Lee was a banker so he would he would pray with Seymour and then they would pray sometimes they prayed all night the history says not every time but sometimes they pray all night and then he'd get up and he'd leave and go work at the bank he was a teller at the bank in California see that gives me hope if I'm a school teacher or if you're a teller the Holy Ghost can still fall praise God in a powerful way amen there's my hour so let me see how I can close here but after praying February March April they have a night bible study Seymour preached Acts chapter 2 verse 4. and after he preached that the verse I opened up with after he preached that verse Lee came up for prayer and Seymour prayed for him who never spoke with tongues just preached it and he started speaking in tongues and that was the night the Revival started let me show you his wife uh so Jenny Jenny Seymour was there as well so they weren't married at that point but she's the one she was just sitting you know after Edward Lee come up for prayer she was just sitting and once he started speaking in tongues the Holy Ghost knocked her out of her chair and she started speaking in tongues after she got up she went over to the piano this is her own testimony she started playing and singing in tongues and had never played piano before how long do they pray for church two and a half months how long would they pray for now there's no formula but I'm just saying if we want to see God move we got to be more dedicated I mean I appreciate all God's movement now but if we want to see God move in a more greater way we got to be more consecrated to God and then of course he married her a few years later I think two years later I think uh this this the woman that wanted to marry him was a white woman and so uh he knew about it Seymour knew about it and he liked her but he asked uh parnam you know should I marry and he said no don't do interracial marriage so he took that you know because it was it was illegal it was illegal and so he told the woman no and then he took uh Jenny to be his wife so these were real I mean you gotta we had to live through difficult times church we have I mean there's we're all called to live through difficult times and go through trials but the Lord Jesus will guide us through all those trials he'll give us the wisdom of the Holy Spirit how many believe that Hallelujah and even I'll just I'll just share this even after he died in in 1922 she was the pastor I think for 14 to 16 more years she was the pastor a woman pastor now I don't think she preached but she she was the one that was in charge so we'll we'll learn more about uh this Lord willing Wednesday yeah so he arrived in Los Angeles in February he was instantly rejected though he never spoke in tongues he was taken in by the two different families he had one family then the other family and started praying five hours a day and then the spirit in April the spirit said now you've got to increase it to seven hours a day of prayer praise God within one week of the Holy Ghost falling at that uh house right there that very night all the noise was spread abroad people came to see what it was they started preaching that night and people started getting saved they had Services there for about 10 days they had so many services there to that porch collapsed and they couldn't have service anymore so they had to go rent the building on Azusa Street that's why it's called the Azusa Street Revival but then the noise and the worship and the praise and the tongues and the shouting and the piano it was also glorious it attracted all the people and it became so much over those days that the porch collapsed and they had to go rent a building so here's the that's the there's brother Seymour right there just a small Building compared to here's the size of cars this is like it's maybe two or three car lengths wide to stay in a big building probably like a lot a lot like our little place here you know except smaller they had upstairs in the downstairs for this this is the is uh this was the building on Azusa Street now let me I'll just close to this or I'm sorry let me read this and I'll move to my closing so Services were long often spontaneous there was no order like we always sing first and then preach and then pray or sing they had no order there was absolutely no order whatever God wanted to do they would they would just wait and do it they would just wait till someone was moved by the Holy Spirit and music was mostly instrumental you know we have the blessing of having all the instruments most Services had no instruments and pardon me acapella what did I say instrumental yeah sorry thank you appreciate that so they'd have songs testimonies prayer altar calls for each of the three works of Grace whatever the spirit said whatever the people needed that's what the spirit would do call them up for sanctification call them up for salvation call them up for the baptism Holy Ghost call them up for healing it was constantly calling the people up to the altar to pray and then Seymour would preach when he felt let the Lord too I've heard two different things I've heard that he sat with a peach basket on his head until he felt led to preach or he hid between two empty shoe boxes he would just sit in these empty boxes and just wait humble himself until God said go preach that's how he waited for his sermons so he was in charge but allowed freedom there's prayer for the sick shouting some were slaying the spirit sometimes there's periods of just extended silence just waiting on God and sometimes there was singing in tongues as well see I don't know if that was interpreted or not that's why I don't know is that the right thing got the wrong thing because the Bible says when you walk in and everybody's speaking in tongues it's confusion so I'm not sure I don't want to call the Holy Ghost something wrong if the Holy Ghost was doing it right never want to blaspheme I know as a Believer we never blaspheme on purpose God knows our hearts we would never Blast From God on purpose right we would never say anything wrong on purpose and no offerings were collected look how this man lived he lived off that house he lived off Edward Lee until they got the church and then they just had a box that was set up in the back and people would drop in offerings and that support the church he never asked for it they never took up any offerings history says people would have to go up and push money into his pockets and run away just to give him money because he wasn't after money that's something this is how humble this man was brother Seymour all right let me close to this I got a lot of history about I'm gonna let me yeah I'm sorry I'll go to the lessons on Sunday there's a lot of lesson or Wednesday so I want to close to this because I already preached an hour and seven minutes the same Holy Ghost Church is available to every generation brother said that's why each Revival has I'm sorry each generation had its own Revival a chance at the word aren't you glad you get a chance at it praise God church I feel like if we just prayed one hour a day what would happen in our lives we're in the midst of later to see with all this Darkness I mean most deception of any age if we just prayed one hour a day what would what would change in our lives now think about it we can eat over an hour a day if you you add up all the times you're eating a meal think of all the time maybe you're listening to listen to something for just an hour what if we could pray one hour a day see each each generation gets its own Revival at the word another chance so The Sovereign God at the Judgment John Wesley's group will raise up and these starch wash methodists of today will answer for it see that's what Seymour was he was a a real Wesleyan right but then the wesleyans kicked him out of the church because he believed in Holiness he moved on into deeper things of God so he was actually rejected in his day by most of the churches Luther will raise up the Catholics Ariza back behind iranius Martin cauliflower from those and will have to stand the Judgment for hybriding the word of God to dogmas this group of lutherans that filed Luther's Revival will answer the same thing they the Buddha group of Baptists that followed John Smith's Revival will do the same thing Alexander Campbell's group would do the same thing I don't know about Alexander Campbell I never studied him and the Pentecost will do the same thing tonight goes to Azusa Street that original Revival when the Holy Ghost fell caught out of a people and God trying to get his word to it and they organize it set over there and denominated and died right there you say but look what they're doing we'll get on that a little later on today see we're coming right down to I'm just putting the seat in now then we're going to show you after a while what happened now as I close Jesus said blessed are they which hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled our hunger must be for the spiritual things of God and Jesus said ask and it shall be given to you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you everyone that asks receives and he that seeketh findeth unto him that knocketh it shall be opened or what man is there of you whom if his son asks bread will he give him a stone or if you ask a fish will he give him a serpent if then if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him in Luke he says it like this if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts on your children how much more shall your heavenly father give to the give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him and now I just love this next verse now look he goes from saying if you want the Holy Ghost I'll give it to you and then he goes right back to living by the Holy Ghost being led by the Holy Ghost to cast out a devil Jesus was constantly filled with the Holy Ghost led by the Holy Ghost and he was casting out a devil and it was Dumb and it came to pass when the devil has gone out the dumb spake and the people wondered Jesus lived under the constant anointing of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and I know each one of you want to live under a greater anointing than what you're living or else you wouldn't be here if you thought this was a domination you would have probably left already but we're here to grow closer to God and churches I showed you sometimes it takes two years it took them two years to get in the spot where they could start praying for Revival two years of prayer focusing on Supernatural Revival that's why I'm not saying we got to have more Revival today I'm not saying that but I'm saying if we want more of God we've got to invest in it because that's how it's always come because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever this verse has always been striking to me and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John so it seems like Jesus is saying those that want the kingdom of God they go and take the kingdom of God right they seize they claim for themselves they snatch it out of the way right if you were in John the Baptist day and you won the kingdom of God what would you do you'd go to John and say John baptize me I'm going to take God at his word I'm going to believe God's promise I want to be baptized Hallelujah each one of you today each one of you today I've taken you down to the waters to baptize you in the name of Jesus Christ praise God that shows at one point we've all had this desire to possess the kingdom of God but if we want more of the kingdom of God we've got to put more into the kingdom of God we've got to go take it we've got to possess the promises of God we must ask the Lord to pour out his spirit God promised to pour it out so the question is how often has you have you asked God to pour out a spirit and I want to ask will you ask for the pouring out of the spirit today musicians could come let's stand to our feet I preach an hour and 15 there by God's grace how many love the Lord today thank you Jesus how often has you have you asked for God departed spirit and will you ask for it today will we ask for it today we all know the scripture Jesus says you have not because you ask not I read about these Amazing Stories I'm thinking wow I can relate to some of them in some ways but there's some things church we can't relate to three services a day for three years and not that we have to relate to that but we have to have a desire for more of God because the Antichrist Spirit of this day says Be Rich increase with goods and have need of I'm sorry I have no need of more of God I'm sure sister Beatrice I'll just use her I'm sure see since she's coming the message she's seen how people have had a real hunger for God and then it just cools off am I right sister all right anybody could have guessed that I'm not smart right you start off with a great desire to serve God then slowly you're not asking for God to pour out a spirit anymore but God said God said I will pour it out that's what we saw with a lot of these people they just got they wanted a fresh pouring out Hallelujah tell me when a fresh pouring out and that's all we need give me a fresh pouring out so I can prophesy Vision give me a dream Lord give me a word of wisdom give me a word of knowledge it don't have to be just prophecy dreams and visions but when the spirit of God moves it it does something it flows out in other words I want God God I want to see you flow out of my life I want to see you flown to somebody for healing I want to see you flow through me to speak in a tongue or to give an interpretation how many times have I asked God to speak in tongues I'm like Lord I've given you 17 years 18 years of preaching I'd love to speak in tongue just one time I've asked God for it I guess I got to ask God more for it but then again the Bible says do you all speak with tongues I might be asking contrary to what God wants me to ask but I just hear about it I read about it in the Bible I hear about it in these revivals and I just want I just want more experiences with God the question is have we asked God to pour out his Spirit on us afresh and the other question is are we willing to ask God for it today those are my two questions I'm closing the service Hallelujah I really enjoyed the worship before service I really thought the Holy Spirit I'm sorry to be in service I really thought the Holy Spirit was guiding that I was weeping and crying I really felt the prince of God just play that uh the spiral heads here my word of Prayer uh spirit Living God fall fresh on me because that's what Evan Roberts prayed and that's really what Seymour did in other words he was praying five hours a day saying Lord bend me change me in other words prepare me for this revival foreign [Music] I want a Revival and I'm here for the Long Haul praise God the Bible says verse when the Bible says follow charity and desire spiritual gifts desire the best gifts I want to see the spirit poured out on brother Chris so he can have another vision who prophesy I don't see a poured out on our sister on our brother on me I want to I want the spirit of God on me Hallelujah have I asked for it am I willing to ask for today that's the question I'm excited for this series I'm really excited you see what the Bible says we stir up our minds by way over I wonder I was thinking I was going to ask sister Naomi you remember that service when you got the Holy Ghost and they had to carry out of the service it's like me can I remember when I got the Holy Ghost what was that like what does that do it stirs you up say Lord Do It Again Lord pour out your spirit once more we sense you're coming we sense Jesus coming you see the world getting darker and more wicked we see our lives be more holy foreign we see our lives in the light of the Gospel we're walking the light as Jesus is in the light [Music] just waiting on the Lord [Music] foreign foreign
