praise the lord let's open up to uh song of solomon i want to start there with this uh series here's the pirates by a score of 3-1 today okay somehow it uh caught some key word there you can always uh okay mercy let's uh go to song of solomon here by god's grace when he continues thought on the church mystery of the church as the bride let's go to song of solomon 1 verse 7. quite a book this book is i preached on this years ago it's probably been 10 years maybe quite a quite a intense book we'd say but it's all pointing to christ and the church praise god amen so we want to just glean a few more thoughts out of here and look at the uh the church as the bride song of solomon 1 verse 7. i want to start just with this thought about uh the depths of the wife's love for solomon let's read verse seven i don't think i've got a memory verse yet from brother bang so we'll just keep with the uh we'll just keep with the february memory verse from james five so let's sing i'm sorry let's read rather song of solomon 1 verse 7. let's begin on three one two three tell me o thou whom my soul love us where thou feedest where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon for why should i be as one uh that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions amen now the point i want to bring out there is that first phrase tell me o thou who my soul loveth praise god so this uh schulamite uh had fallen for solomon and he had fallen for her and their love was down to the soul so it was it was past the body right it was past the human spirit and it was down into the soul praise god that's the nature of the human being praise god now let's go to james 5 7. james five seven read seven and eight james five seven and eight all right let's read that seven and eight let's read that on three one two three be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husband waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain be also patient establish your hearts for the coming of the lord draweth nigh amen let's that word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it unknown unto god here let's pray together heavenly father for we come into your presence lord we worship you we love you thank you for putting the banner over us lord of love you're the one lord who assigned lord the flag that would fly over us lord is love because you love us lord god you you gave your life for us lord god you sent us every good and perfect gift lord god and you're making a way for our union with you lord god you want to be with your people heavenly father lord and you want to do it through your son lord the physical body so lord we're grateful for that lord god thank you for lord our banner of victory lord we know love is how we overcome through your love so lord let your love fill our hearts and our minds tonight lord speak to us by the holy spirit help us lord jesus we just want to be pleasing to you and we want your truth here tonight we're so grateful to be in your house there's no better place to be lord than in spirit and in truth worshiping you so we give you praise and thanks bless the saints that press their way out to the house of god give them a double portion lord of thy holy spirit in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god all right now i want to go back to song of solomon 1. and let's go to verse 5. i kind of ended this uh message last week with this thought about how the shulamite was jewish but she had gentile characteristics i want to read this verse again song of solomon uh 1 verse 5. now as i said it's a very uh personal and descriptive book right because in verse the very second verse starts with uh them having uh marriage contacts in certain ways right so it's a very uh descriptive book but again it's showing uh the natural love between a husband and wife and it's the the closest expression jesus could have for his love for his wife would be this story of the song of solomon in fact the bible calls it the song of all songs praise god so it's the greatest song is this song of uh love and devotion now verse 5. i just want to share this again bless you sir you're fine sir verse 5. now it says i am black but calmly o ye daughters of jerusalem as the tents of keter as the curtains of solomon look not upon me because i'm black because the son hath looked upon me my mother's children were angry with me they made me the keeper of the vineyards but mine own vineyard have i not kept now we saw this last week that the the shepherd girl the shulamite she's talking with friends and as you read through this book it's a conversation constantly between the bride and her bridesmaids her friends and then groups of jews and her husband solomon it's a conversation you got to be very careful how you uh understand it and uh i want to bring you this thought out here uh with this color black okay i just want to bring a brief thought here because god is all skin colors okay i want to make sure i say that especially to our little girls god loves all skin colors but in this case there was a little tradition they had so the tradition of the jews was that if you stayed out of the sun you were thought to be more pretty if you didn't go in the sun now that's opposite today right in america if you go in the sun you are considered more handsome or more pretty the darker you are today in america the prettier you are right uh switch over real quick i just want to show this picture again when i was a little boy i got really really dark and now it was a good way i loved it but i got tea sometimes because i was uh so dark at sometimes look at my uh white socks here can we just i'll have to zoom in there look at my white socks and look how dark my skin was there look at my white shirt there there's a little brother jesse right there but look how look how much darker i was compared to my sister so people you know had they were surprised sometimes when they thought that we were siblings i just want to bring this out because i i didn't mention this last week and i want all the children to know especially that god loves every skin color but in their time in country you if you were rich and had lots of money you got to stay inside a day and you didn't have to go out in the sun and and work hard and watch the sheep right and feed the sheep and and shave the sheep but the poor people had to okay so i want to make sure you bring that out here that uh when you read the old testament they have many customs that don't apply to us today like i was reading this week i think it's in leviticus 24 the men couldn't shape their beards in a curved way right they had to just let their beards grow out and that was because a lot of heathens cut their beards in a circular way because it looked like the moon god or the sun god or the the planetary gods of the saturn and mercury and so they worship the sun and so when they worship the sun they want they cut uh like people do today they cut things in their heads right they come they they shave symbols in their heads and and god said he told moses tell the men not even to round off the corners of their beards now do you think today if somebody trims their beard do you think that's a sin if jose trims his beard or something you don't grow a beard but i can't grow a beard but do you think it's a sin to today for g for gentiles to round their beards no it's not that was a cultural command for israel because all the nations around them were heathens and they worshipped idols so i just want to make sure i was kind of thinking about that last week i want to make sure i said that that god loves all skin colors but especially here uh the jews they were so uh they were so concerned about uh making sure that they stayed out of the sun right and they wanted to make sure that they lived an easy life they didn't want to they didn't want to sweat they didn't want to work hard who likes to work hard raising does anyone like to work hard out there yeah okay good we don't want to be lazy do we we want to work hard right i like getting out in the sun in the summer i like mowing and i like to see my arms get a little darker and i like to see my complexion get dark jose gets dark dunny you're a lot darker or winning the summer buddy it's going to start be 67 next week but i want to make sure that uh especially our children understand that when they read that um this this this girl was ashamed of her dark skin but we shouldn't be ashamed of our skin color praise god because it's something god gave us it's a beauty that god gave us right so i want to make sure i bring that out but in those days the darker skin you had they thought uh the more poor you were and you weren't as good as the people that were lighter skinned okay and that was just a custom that was just a tradition and that's not true at all right it was just a tradition or a custom okay so but the fact was that she worked outside she was a laborer and i like that the bible said she worked with the sheep praise god amen a woman a bride who knew about sheep amen and that's what we should know we should know about sheep today right we're god's sheep he's the great shepherd praise god we should not uh we should not know about wolves too much except when we drive them out right praise god we should have a bunch of sheep in here a bunch of humble obedient sheep not to what just not what i say but to what the word of god says amen when i'm saying what the word says then yes you submit to that but it must be according to the word of god because jesus is feeding his sheep today praise god and so i like this her connection with the sheep and she said my skin though is like the tense of the ishmaelites so we see a connection she's inward jew but she outward looks gentile she did not have a royal life and i like this in her soul the very center of her being she's in love with this man solomon what a mighty man he was he was such a mighty man at the beginning that god appeared to him twice think about that where you would you would say such a prayer that the holy spirit would come to you and and god would speak his word to you because you were so sincere and you wanted to do god's will this was the kind of man he was now god's holy spirit works to the very depths of our being as well now let's go to psalms uh i'm sorry song of solomon 3 verse 1. song of solomon 3 verse 1 by night on my bed i sought him with whom my whom i soul loveth i sought him but found him not i will now rise and go about the city in the streets and in the broad ways will i seek him whom my soul loveth i sought him but i found him not the watchmen that go about the city found me to whom i said saw ye him whom my soul loveth now look this was in her her constant conversation have you seen the one that my soul loves hallelujah she was constantly talking about this one uh with with simon with with how much she loved him right and that's what we should do we should we should tell people how much we love jesus right they should know that we love jesus very much that we love him so much we go to church on wednesday night right we go to church on sunday night we love jesus so much we read our bibles we pray we listen to sermons uh we do we have extra fellowships right we we love jesus so much we just want to hear his word and we want to be with his people i like this she says it over and over uh that she loves him with her soul her nature had expressed its love to this one man praise god i like what it says that uh he's she says i held him and would not let him go until i had brought him into my mother's house and in the chamber of her of her that conceiveth me now this is again a scripture where it's hard to know if they're already married or not um me personally you know i i think she's speaking future tense to when they would be married uh but verse five i'm sorry finishing verse five i charge you all you daughters of jerusalem by the rose and by the hinds of the field that ye not i'm sorry you stir not up nor wake my love until he please okay so of course it's speaking of married life all right now uh in chapters one two and three they're dreaming of their time together they get little short vacations of courtship that's what it looks like and then uh solomon arrives for the wedding in uh verse six of chapter three so let's read uh these last few verses now you may have a scofield bible and other bibles i've read talks about uh he's prepared this bed and so that's why in verse six and seven it seems like solomon is is coming into the city to have the wedding ceremony because he's bringing a bed which there was of course a wedding procession that they would do remember the foolish virgins they said go ye out to meet him right because he was on his way uh to his father's house for the wedding uh reception and and all their wedding festivities so verse six who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke perfume with myrrh and frankincense with all powders of the merchant upon his bed which is solomon's three score valiant men are about it i'm sorry behold his bed uh of the valiant of israel they all hold swords being expert in war every man had this sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night i like that so solomon comes here his bed is is coming as well and he's also surrounded by warriors amen he's surrounded by those that have swords amen does not sound like armageddon amen jesus comes he's leading the charge right but he's got an army behind him praise god so it looks like the coming of the lord now verse 9 king solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of lebanon he made the pillars thereof of silver the bottom thereof of gold the covering of it purple the myth thereof being paved with what love amen so he's riding in love he lives in love church amen how many want to live in love amen he travels in love i like that he travels with soldiers he travels with swords he travels with the word amen and his way is paved with love he's got the royal colors right a purple amen silver redemption now it's love for the daughters of jerusalem so he loves his people that he rules over verse 11 go forth o ye daughters of zion and behold king solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him now listen in the day of his espousals and in the day of the gladness of his heart so this is why you know a lot of people think here's solomon uh this was him coming in to marry the shulamite now one idea too you know that this may be the shulamite reminiscing about what had already happened in the past so it's hard to know the chronological order but i trust everybody can see that there's a wedding going on the main point we want to see is that these two desperately love each other amen they desperately love each other they love each other more than just with the flesh and the mind they love each other with their souls amen the very depths of their being they're completely devoted and the bible says they love one another with their souls and all they can do is think about time being together all they can think about is is sharing love and and being finally united praise god amen now church we know as well the bible says that uh they love uh she you know they love each other with their soul and the bible says that we love jesus with our soul amen so the bible said we're sealed to the day of our redemption let's uh go to first peter uh malachi can you do some reading lilia can you just remember lily can you pull up first thessalonians 5 23 and malachi first peter 1 22. pull up those two let's look at some scriptures about the soul and how we're to obey with the soul and love jesus from the soul isn't that something that god could give uh saints in the old testament such a love that they knew it was a everlasting love right they knew it was an eternal love even in the old testament but before the holy ghost could fall they knew a great connection no doubt right adam and eve no doubt they had a great love for each other because she was part of him praise god they would have had a great love because they were originally one right and we see other couples down through the bible that their love was expressed through the dedication of their soul amen they were drawn to that person they just they just had to be with that person because their souls told them and showed that they had love for just that one person all right so can you read that lydia first thessalonians 5 23 amen so jesus promised to make your soul blameless and the saint said amen your soul your nature is to be blameless right there's to be nothing against your soul the bible said jesus will preserve your soul he'll protect your soul amen he'll keep your soul in a state where it's not to be blamed not to be guilty but to be guiltless amen to be justified and i like that jesus he's going to make all three parts of you he loves you so much he's going to keep your soul safe he's going to keep your mind safe he's going to keep your body safe amen he's going to preserve your love for him what a beautiful promise malachi 1 peter 1 22. now look here church a soul can you keep that up there honey this is beautiful your soul gets purified we just read that jesus keeps it re preserved blameless how does it be preserved blameless jesus is helping you to obey the word amen how many know that each week you need more reminders about obeying the word right that's the second law of thermodynamics we're going to get to on sunday night that that law says everything tends towards disorder right things just kind of unravel they kind of get old that's the law of thermodynamics right that's what solomon had unfortunately went through his love got cold for god right it got cold for god but the bible says here now in the new testament the holy spirit is going to purify your souls now here's the holy spirit as you obey the truth amen so he's going to help your soul obey the word your soul is going to be clean purified made new and it's going to help you to have genuine love amen so the holy spirit here in the new testament is working in your soul and it will give you love for god's people and also give you love for your enemies amen but that's the the interest of the soul god is most interested in getting our souls lined up with his word amen hallelujah praise god this woman says have you found the one that my soul loveth amen that's kind of how we do have you heard anything new any new prophecies about the lord is he do you think he's going to come soon right how many people they'll text you brother jesse your brother sister so and so brother son so what do you think is the lord going to come soon are you looking for the lord right what are we saying have you seen the one whom my soul loveth amen have you heard any signs have you seen any heard any prophecies uh do you feel the lord's gonna come right we're looking for the one that our soul loves amen that's why we watch him pray right that's the real reason we get on and check the news right that's the real reason we uh we talk to others from overseas and we talked to different people about the how's it going in your church and how are things going there are the people encouraged no you want to kind of see uh if the lord is dealing with people and how they're doing in the spirit because we want to be ready for his coming our souls want to be pure praise god our souls want to be ready and we want to show god's love and we want to have a pure heart at the coming of jesus amen that is getting this soul ready praise god what a great blessing now in chapter four here's some of the most detailed parts of the of the book it looks like the wedding night and uh the couple goes uh they take turns and they they complement each other from head to toe uh they both say how beautiful they are from head head to toe and then their marriage is consummated uh as solomon enters into his garden right uh the scripture says now here uh there's a there's a physical union and of course that's a type of the union of christ and the church right and so we see that air in chapter four uh the language shows a union has taken place amen praise god and then you as soon as uh as soon as that happened you start talking about the fruits of the spirit amen in verse 16 they talk about the fruits amen the the pleasant fruits of the union and that's what we see when someone is really united united with christ you're going to see the love of christ amen when you're really united with the holy spirit you're going to see the longsuffering of the holy spirit amen you're going to see the temperance you're going to see the patience of the holy spirit you're going to see the fruits of the spirit when you're really united to christ amen thank god now chapters five through seven are just um interesting chapters they kind of deal with the shulamite struggles she has a struggle to respond quickly to her husband after the husband is walking all through night the husband said he's got dew on his hair and he's been out all night and he knocks and said let me in my dove and that's kind of a strange thing she said how could i get dirty how could i get dusty but by the time she gets there he's already gone and she goes out in the streets right and she tells the watchmen have you seen uh the one i love and they beat her you know it's a really strange story but we can but what we can see churches through this we can see a struggle that we have to respond quickly to that gentle uh still small voice of the lord amen praise god how many want to respond quickly to that call praise god amen that's what so what it teaches they're already married they compliment each other up and down they say the nice things they have such great intimacy but yet she's a little slow to respond notice he's not slow to respond she is amen notice jesus will never fail you but sometimes you might fail jesus right it's a beautiful story it's a struggle for the woman here to respond quickly to her husband and then diligently seek his presence but of course they reunite they again compliment each other from head to toe right in every way and then uh and this of course as the uh the church right the body of christ amen the body the body in europe right the the body in in australia the body in japan amen the body in mexico praise god uh the body in iceland the body in the united states all of it's beautiful from the top to the bottom praise god amen from the highest office can i say like that from the highest office the apostle all the way down praise god to the to the soul that just got saved last night or this morning praise god the entire body of christ who's born again she's altogether beautiful amen now of course in this text she's the one that's saying is saying he's altogether lovely right but we know he compliments her as well she's completely beautiful in his sight and she says the same thing he's completely beautiful in my sight so chapters five six and seven they go on a vacation they they go out uh uh to a garden right they go check on their uh their crops and church this is where we can relate uh how we want to be with the lord right we want to feel his anointing i don't want to feel the lord's anointing how many want to have times where you're shut in with god amen praise god you just get tired of you know maybe your life feels like it's far away and you're just longing for more of god and you just want to feel like you did at the beginning and the church said right that's what she's longing for oh my the things that uh you know we've been married but we're getting busy and we haven't had you know time together like we ought to oh yeah remember he says come away my love amen right come away my lover it's like jesus drawing the bride away for a time of fellowship amen oh it's a beautiful picture beautiful picture it's on the book there lord women on the book now in the final chapter let's go to song of solomon chapter eight this is such a glorious ending to the book again it's a little bit strange but we got to see the the broad principles here that god is trying to uh explain here through this woman and this man remember he had no other love interest in the entire book right because that would not have type christ in the church right so we had one love interest the shulamite from issachar and it was up north i looked it up on finally found on the map it was north it was north of jerusalem and everything so the north part so in the eighth and final chapter the best way they can describe their love is a seal a seal now let's let's read that let's read uh song of solomon chapter 8 verse 5 who is this that cometh up from the wilderness leaning upon her beloved i raise thee up under the apple tree there thy mother brought thee forth there she brought thee forth that bear thee and i'm not sure who says this i think it's the the wife set me as a seal of paul nine heart as a seal paul nine arm for love is strong as death jealousy is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which has a most vehement flame many waters cannot quench love so this this woman is seeing you know them coming up out of the wilderness and they've got their arms around each other and it's just quite a picture she's leaning on him as they're coming closer back into we'd say regular life and society many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would be utterly contempt okay so look seal he said she said set me as a seal a paul nine heart amen church nothing was more permanent in the bible than the king seal right in the old testament nothing was more permanent they had a seal normally on their ring right esther eight verse 8 says the king's proclamation sealed with this ring was irreversible and so she said set me as a seal upon her heart in other words let my love or let my love be stamped upon your heart let me be marked upon your heart amen that's what jesus said he kind of says the same thing he said you're written on the palms of my hands amen not just like a regular uh relationship but this is a special relationship you're written on the very palms of my hands you're marked on me praise god and that's what she said let me be marked upon your heart like a seal praise god amen as a a love that is irreversible it's a unending love it's an eternal love it's an unchanging love because jesus christ is the same today yesterday and forever amen that's the best way she can describe it uh the best way we can give an idea of love is that it's stronger than death is that what the bible said love is stronger than death prove it yes i will adam prove love is stronger than death because he purposely chose to die in order to be with eve amen praise god hallelujah thank god i love that he proved it he could have lived he would have been alone he would have no help me right had he let eve just go you go and die you know she got older and died but he didn't want that he knew eve was a part of him they're the same nature right flesh of flesh bona bla bona bone word of word spirit of spirit life of life amen praise god and so adam said i've got to prove it i love her more than anything so i've got to prove that love is stronger than death amen he purposely chose to die to be with eve and jesus did the same thing he purposely chose to die in church we know he's stronger than death because he conquered death he defeated death amen he took the keys of death amen so he's stronger than death so adam and jesus christ prove once and for all that love is stronger than death amen what a beautiful picture this is the eighth and final one that we have here of uh old testament women that typify christ and the church irreversible love i like what ephesians 4 30 we read it many times but did you notice it said they're sealed unto the day of redemption it doesn't say sealed until it's sealed unto it praise god in other words you don't lose your seal after after you get a new body or you die you know you're still sealed your soul is still marked for all eternity amen it's sealed to that point so at that point you get a new body you get a theophany body how many looking forward to a theophany body amen a perfect body praise god a word body amen now we know there's limitations to it doesn't know everything right uh so we look forward to that and that's what we're promised here a love that's so strong it cannot be reversed amen and then song of solomon ends almost identically to how revelation 22 ends in both books uh the brides or the churches are eager for the bridegroom's return amen what a beautiful picture so we see in a love story in a love story the greatest expression is a seal a permanent mark an order a declaration of love amen and then also the husband and wife are longing to be together they're eager to be united amen song of solomon 8 14 she says make haste my beloved and be thou like a row i'm sorry like two a row or a young heart upon the mountains of spices now did you catch that you know in verse five they're walking up she's leaning on him now verse 14 she's saying hurry up my beloved and be like a row so he must gone back up to the mountains right he must have left for a little while and then come back because she's saying make haste hurry back uh uh i'm missing you i love you amen my soul longs to be with you praise god and john right and jesus in revelation 22 said behold surely i come quickly amen now what did she say said she said come like a row come quickly like a gazelle right like a deer type of a creature like a heart right like a deer i'm some species of a vast fast-moving deer she said come quickly uh we long to be together my soul longs to to to hold the one that i love and so john finishes the book by saying amen even so come lord jesus so he says surely i come quickly and then he says amen so be it amen he said i'm coming quickly he amends it and says so be it come lord jesus amen and church that's what we should feel today we should be greatly anticipating the rapture we should be looking for his coming we should say lord come quickly quickly save souls quickly baptize souls into the presence of god seal them in their souls amen with the holy spirit do it quickly do a great work because we long to be with you we know uh all these kingdoms will fail right they'll pass away we have no continuing city here we're like abraham looking for a city whose builder and maker is god amen the new jerusalem amen so come quickly we're looking for a future home that's a home of holiness amen it'll be a reign of righteousness amen hallelujah it'll be the hallelujah highway where we live and our addresses and it's a longing it's a great anticipation for that we cannot make this world our home we've got to remember that the new jerusalem is our home amen that's our real home and we must say lord jesus come quickly why don't i end with this thought here on with one more thought oh it's a beautiful picture how many like that picture there praise god what a beautiful picture it ends with the seal now as you know too it talks about the the maturity because she's talking how i'm not yet a woman i haven't developed you know into maturity and so it's showing of course that the bride has to mature right uh the bride has to become mature in order to take her position and her place so now since we're on that adam thought let's close with eve now at the end of the chapter i put all these other women you can learn lessons from that speak to the bride in christ and then i end with proverbs 31 but let's close with eve can we let's close with eve the first female came out of adam uh formed from his rib the man said that was be because she come close to his heart right the rib is close to the heart she's a piece of his uh spear right a part of him and so she's a representation of christ's bride uh how the bride originated from god's mind right because she was chosen in adam's rib but we were chosen in christ before the foundation of the world amen hallelujah thank god eve came out of adam we came out of the mind of jesus amen that means our souls are eternal we came out of god we'll go back to god so that and that should mean we live by the word if we came out of the word we should live every day by the word amen not by a creed like all those denominations we went through a few weeks ago and we should not live by those creeds and man-made dogmas and denominations but the word should become more living to us should become more alive to us we should be seeing how it more applies to us as the bride of christ amen but what happened to eve she was deceived into sinning by that satan filled serpent right satan injects his nature in the human race eve receives two different seeds any of us would have fallen so we do we don't blame eve too much right but the lesson is we never add or take away from god's word right as repeatedly taught in scripture remember like with joshua don't stray to the right don't straight to the left just meditate in the word day and night amen don't add one to so the lesson the very lesson from the beginning from from eve to moses to joshua to jesus when he faced satan he said live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god amen the lesson through the whole bible then remember the bible ends in revelation 22 don't add to it don't take one word from it amen the same lesson brother says it happens the beginning of the book the middle and the ending of the book the whole plan of the book is through the love of god keep every command amen beautiful thought but we know e fell just like every church would fall right every church falls short of the glory of god at some point but we have the lesson we have the lesson that eve fell because her desire went to something outside the word that's where we've got to be careful and all of our plans all of our desires all of our decisions are found in the word of god because god later says well see because you've done this your desire was to the serpent so now your desire will be to your husband it went to someone else other than her true headship right all right so our desire must only be to christ praise god and we must not repeat her heirs remember paul said he said every scripture in the bible was written for our admonition right that we would learn from it that we would not uh tempt god we would not lust we would not murder right all these are written and they're they're suitable for our doctrine and our teaching so that's what we must learn from eve the serpent we know only added one word right and true churches when i add one thing to god's command i had a brother email me this week and said he said jesus came and visited me this week and i don't even know him he just put me on his mailing list from overseas and he said he said i'm the eighth angel messenger the holy spirit is the eighth angel and i said sir i said show me one place in the bible in revelation where there's an eighth messenger there is none right there's a seventh angel and that's it and the church said so see even if it's just one edition now it sounds good doesn't it well brother rahm's gone so we need a messenger but it's not according to the bible the bible never says an eighth messenger we know jesus said he was the messenger of all time he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you even to the end of the age amen so he never named himself as an eighth messenger well look how people and then they call me uh they call me uh the backslidden one because i won't accept their doctrine because i won't add one word to it that's fine call me whatever you want i'm backstage from your false doctrine i'll say it like that but what i'm doing is i'm obedient faithful to christ doctrine amen you can call me backslidden to your false doctrine because i never believed it to begin with so it's hard to know that it's hard to say i'm even baxter from it i just reject it but that's what we're dealing with church dealing with people that will just add one little thing although we know the seventh angel revelation 10 7 oh just well there's got to be an eight messenger no the bible didn't say that he's christ is the ever-present messenger amen praise god and so we learn not to add one thing or take one thing away now the beautiful part about eve's life is that we see redemption through her life amen how many can say praise the lord so adam willingly sinned right but eve was deceived into it but god fell sorry god still made a way for the deceived one to be redeemed amen god still stop god still knew well she fell short there she she got deceived but she still came out of adam i'm gonna redeem her i know she still has good qualities she came out of the man that i said was good amen hallelujah so i'm gonna make a way for her to come back praise god amen church let me say it like this even if we make even if we're deceived even if we make a mistake god can bring us back hallelujah amen if he brought eve back if he brought that original church back that first woman back then god could bring us back if we make a mistake or we weren't able to catch it or we made just a little mistake there god is able to redeem us uh he knows we need redemption and he knows we'll thank him for redemption amen because we're not god that was the whole lie oh you can be like god right you can you're you can be greater than god you can be equal to god that was the whole lie god god knew he wouldn't be like that but satan lied and so the point of this is to show mankind redemption and his love church remember adam and eve never even asked god to come and sacrifice those lambskins god did it out of his love amen right god did it because he loved them and god sent jesus christ before you and i even cared about it god sent jesus to show us his love amen while we were yet sinners christ died the righteous for the unrighteous oh it's a beautiful picture praise god she was part of him and then adam took her sin upon himself just like jesus takes took our sin upon him and it was god's mercy that redeemed us hallelujah amen now god made sacrifices so he could clothe adam and eve in genesis 3 21 and the bible said they made coats of skins for adam and eve so despite their fall god comes around and clothes them with his choice right and it wasn't bikinis right and it wasn't uh shorts it was with long tunics of lambskins right long tunis of lands like long t-shirts of lamb skins so god provides a sacrifice god provides the righteousness god provides the blood god provides everything and god provided a way back through the baptism of the holy ghost amen he provided a way back pull up isaiah 61 10 honey isaiah 61 10. how many know you got special clothes on tonight i'm not talking about the name brand you got whether it's target or dockers i think i might have dockers on today or something like that i can't remember any of the names of the clothes but look uh 61 10. i'm sorry 61 10 90 61 10. now look when you accept jesus christ he gives you new clothes amen just like he gave adam and eve new clothes isaiah 61 10 says i will greatly rejoice in the lord my soul shall be joyful in my god for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation amen hallelujah i'm i i'm clothed i'm wearing god's salvation amen i am a living testimony that god delivers amen hallelujah through he delivered me and i'm wearing that uh my public testimony speaks that jesus is the my deliverer praise god people see my life and they should know i've been delivered by christ his sacrifice is clothing me amen oh glory thank you jesus you have covered me with the robe of righteousness as a bridegroom decketh himself now look at this a man decks himself with ornaments now that's something different right you we usually we don't think of a man looking all handsome with ornaments right chains and rings and we just you know we don't think about that too much but that was what it was in the old testament the jewish man would no doubt have done that and as a bride adorneth herself with jewels praise god so we we fall short that the devil uh deceives us we fall short but jesus welcomes us back he made a way he made a sacrifice he died for us and he welcomes us back in and then he gives us the clothes that we need praise god he gives us the jewelry need right the righteousness we need it's his gift to us he's clothing us this is the beauty of eve's testimony can i say it like this she took upon the clothing of the devil right but then jesus provides her clothing that washes away her sins and she gets a new clothing she gets a new uh wardrobe can i say like that's probably what we do children are grown so much we got to get rid of their old clothes and get them a new wardrobe right constantly a new wardrobe my wife's switching out the the clothes for zion right from the three-month-old the six month old nine month old it's a new wardrobe and jesus has given us a new wardrobe hallelujah amen this is the beauty of eve's testimony she's defiled in the midst of the garden but god makes a way that when she walks out she's clothed in his righteousness she can say i didn't buy this god gave me this amen hallelujah god gave me this message church amen god gave me this life that i lived the life you live god gave it to you it's a garment of salvation amen and you're clothing it you walk in it i'll say this you live in it praise god amen you live in the salvation and deliverance that jesus gave you that's the beauty of each testimony she walked in it she lived in it she knew what it was like because i guess it fit her just right praise god and this message fits you just right praise god other people can't live it they can't they can't make sense of it they can't figure it out but to you it just fits perfectly amen thank the lord jesus eve is forever connected to adam just as the bride is always connected to christ you know you know jesus called the last adam right he's called the last adam the first adam was a failure right but the last adam undid what the first adam did praise god for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the dead so because a man brought death another man had to bring life for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive amen oh glory so if jesus is the last adam the bride the holy ghost filled church must be the last eve amen one that's desiring only her husband and she won't be deceived and shall long and desire for christ the word amen praise god remember brother adam gave us three a few examples of that remember eve was the one who received the wrong seed right brother ram went from eve and then he went from went from eve to haggar right still the wrong seed right the sea went to the wrong place then it went to sarah because it was the right one right it was abraham and sarah that was natural seed but then god showed the real way the seed is supposed to come and that's through mary the power of the spoken word and she said be it unto me angel according to thy word amen and that's the seed life that you and i receive right faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of god and when we hear the word we receive it when we accept it we repent of our sins and here as the last eve this last eve shall do the opposite of the eve that fell shall shall resist satan praise god and shall receive the word of jesus the word of the last adam amen and that word will be come up hither praise god amen that word will be the last trump meet me in the air i'm coming to rescue you i'm coming to rapture you you're going to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye praise god let's stand by god's grace i'll stop right there hallelujah oh my let's be like mary praise god hallelujah let's be the last eve let's undo what eve did at the beginning praise god let's resist the enemy and he has to flee from us praise god resist the enemy musicians you can come yes let's just play that beat unto me according to thy word let's play that by god's grace the real faith brother said that's the real way to receive seed hear the word and believe it just like rahab we saw that a few weeks ago remember she didn't see nothing she didn't see the prophet all she did she heard about him believed it and it quickened it to her praise god amen that's what we have today amen we hear the word and it's just quickened to us amen i don't have to be sick i don't have to be discouraged i have to be an addiction i can be free by the word of god amen hallelujah i don't have to be downtrodden i have to be defeated i can be an overcomer i can be more than a conqueror in christ jesus praise god just let me hear that word amen hallelujah just let me receive the seed of god amen the seed word promise of god oh what a reality amen what a reality praise god the positive attitude toward any seed of god will bring it to pass let's pray for that tonight church could we let's pray that god will give us a heart like mary and be this last eve who desires only the word of god shall resist the enemy so that he flees [Music] should be totally true to the last adam heavenly father we

revelation 19 all heavens rejoicing in revelation 19. they said let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready amen i learned the whole theme of the bible lord wrapped up in human history glory you're trying to get a final ear alaska a church that will just hear the word and believe it shall resist every one of satan's lies lord i just pray
