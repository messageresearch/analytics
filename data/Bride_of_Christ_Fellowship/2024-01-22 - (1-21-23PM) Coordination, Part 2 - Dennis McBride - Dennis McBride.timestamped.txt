[0:00] all
[0:00] right God bless you all I mean again
[0:04] just wonderful
[0:06] selections just to hear just the hearts
[0:09] of everybody all the kids and everything
[0:11] you know that's beautiful that's a
[0:14] blessing amen um you all are a lovely
[0:19] group thank you amen I don't know if the
[0:22] devil tell you otherwise but if he does
[0:26] he
[0:27] lying really you all are a wonderful
[0:30] group man it's just a real blessing to
[0:32] just be amongst people where you I mean
[0:34] in my heart I feel a
[0:36] connection right the spirit of God is
[0:39] here you know what I mean so that's just
[0:42] that's priceless that's priceless
[0:46] so all right brother vain God bless you
[0:51] brother amen good to see
[0:54] you okay so let's get into the word here
[0:57] now um pray that the Lord help help us
[1:00] once more and we've already prayed for
[1:03] brother Jesse that the Lord continue to
[1:04] use him 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:10] 12 1 Corinthians chapter 12 we going to
[1:13] start at Verse
[1:16] 18 so I guess this should be a part two
[1:20] amen I never had a part two before we
[1:23] got one
[1:25] now so uh the same topic coordination
[1:29] and same same subtopic
[1:32] connected 1 Corinthians 12 starting at
[1:35] Verse 18 says but now hath God set the
[1:39] members every one of them in the body as
[1:41] it hath pleased him amen and if they
[1:45] were all one member where were the
[1:48] body cuz sometimes the devil fights us
[1:51] you know sometimes people are not
[1:53] satisfied with who they
[1:58] are Satan loves to cause
[2:03] dissatisfaction you know what I mean cuz
[2:05] then that causes you to kind of not be
[2:06] able to see the valow you of of how God
[2:09] made you he'll have you looking at
[2:11] somebody else and say man I wish I
[2:14] was but you got something that they
[2:17] don't have and they have something that
[2:19] you can never have because each one of
[2:21] us are unique yes we're uniquely made in
[2:24] the sight of God and how we made is
[2:28] needed how we are made is needed for the
[2:30] body for for the church for the family
[2:33] that God has placed us individually
[2:36] within okay so uh verse 20 but now are
[2:40] they many members yet but one body and
[2:44] the eye I like this and the eye cannot
[2:47] say to the hand I have no need of
[2:50] thee cuz the eye might feel like it has
[2:52] a greater
[2:54] role now I can see everything you can't
[2:56] see nothing so hand I don't really need
[3:00] you but yet let the eye try to reach for
[3:04] something that's right you can see but
[3:06] you can't do nothing else so you need
[3:09] that hand it says so that I can't say to
[3:11] the hand I have no need of thee nor
[3:13] again the head to the feet I have no
[3:16] need of thee nay but much more those
[3:18] members of the body and I love how God
[3:20] places the
[3:22] Saints which seem to be more
[3:25] feeble are necessary
[3:28] amen and those members of the body which
[3:31] we think to be less
[3:33] honorable upon these we bestore more
[3:36] abundant honor and are uncommonly Parts
[3:40] the ones that don't have the attention
[3:42] the you know seemingly you know the the
[3:44] level of
[3:47] importance it says for all more cly
[3:49] Parts it
[3:51] says I'm sorry verse 23 again and those
[3:54] members of the body which we think to be
[3:56] less honorable upon these we bestow a
[3:58] more abundant honor and uncommonly Parts
[4:00] have more abundant cess for our calmly
[4:04] Parts have no need but God hath tempered
[4:07] the body together having giving more
[4:09] abundant honor to that part which lack
[4:11] which lack that there should be no
[4:13] Schism in the body it says but that the
[4:16] members and this is my point but that
[4:19] the members should have the same care
[4:22] one for the other amen and whether one
[4:25] member suffer all the members suffer
[4:28] with it or one member be honored all the
[4:32] members Rejoice with it it says now ye
[4:35] are the body of Christ and members in
[4:37] particular BL bow Heavenly Father we've
[4:40] read your word Lord may you just
[4:43] minister to our hearts as you see fit in
[4:45] Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
[4:50] amen so of course in me being a father
[4:54] of
[4:55] five with the age
[4:58] ranges with the age ranges that I I I
[5:02] have so I have
[5:04] 26 I have 22 I have
[5:09] 20 I have 18 and I have
[5:13] 16 right so uh everybody's got their own
[5:18] personalities nobody's the
[5:21] same right um and so and what I find is
[5:25] a parallel because for a number of years
[5:29] I was uh a supervisor well I was in the
[5:32] military right and so as you gain rank
[5:35] you have more people under you I was a
[5:37] supervisor for a number of years and so
[5:40] you're dealing with a group of people
[5:42] that are all different right but yet you
[5:45] have to uh provide uh guidance and
[5:50] training and development skills to try
[5:53] to cause them to to come together and
[5:55] work together as one
[5:57] unit you know and so the same thing for
[6:00] a
[6:02] church you know uh you can take it to
[6:05] the household right so is it's just that
[6:08] that that that element that's there
[6:10] where you're bringing different people
[6:12] together that have different a mixture
[6:14] of different qualities and what have you
[6:16] and you got to bring them together to
[6:18] work together in
[6:20] coordination right and so but in doing
[6:23] that it helped me to really begin to see
[6:25] for one the number one thing you have to
[6:28] really care about the people that you're
[6:29] working with yes if you have a manager
[6:33] or a supervisor that really don't care
[6:35] about the people you can feel that don't
[6:36] you yes and you will see it it'll be the
[6:40] the results of their leadership it'll be
[6:43] off I've been in those places where a
[6:46] person they might have a n you know a
[6:48] number of years of experience in a job
[6:51] or you know they've been in a 32 years
[6:54] but yet they don't have that right
[6:56] makeup to be a manager or to be a super
[6:59] supervisor they're harded and in the
[7:01] right
[7:02] place right and even even outside of
[7:05] that outside of the leadership the team
[7:08] itself right that's the one that's the
[7:10] number one thing I promote in my
[7:11] household is teamwork you know we but in
[7:14] order to have teamwork you got to have a
[7:16] care one for the other you got to care
[7:19] that I don't want to I don't want to
[7:20] create no more work for my brother or my
[7:23] sister so whatever role I have whatever
[7:26] I'm I'm I'm assigned to do let me do
[7:29] that
[7:29] so that the body or the group or the
[7:31] household can flow in the right manner
[7:34] so how much more
[7:36] God right we're all the body of Christ
[7:39] but members in particular so God wants
[7:41] each one of us to be a a highly
[7:44] functioning part yes amen right because
[7:47] there there is a way in which he wants
[7:49] his body to move there is an atmosphere
[7:51] that he wants to exist among his family
[7:54] I don't want no quarreling among my my
[7:57] my my
[7:58] children and I've had to deal with that
[8:00] you know you I kind of you know I'm I'm
[8:02] off I'm doing other things or whatever
[8:04] you know but then I'm listening you know
[8:07] I listen to tones and the choice
[8:10] words and I got to go to them sometimes
[8:13] I'm like is everything all right you
[8:17] sound a little
[8:18] edgy you know the things you saying are
[8:20] a little too sharp to me I don't think
[8:23] that's how God wants you to talk to your
[8:25] brother or your sister you know but I'm
[8:27] a father but I'm monor in these things
[8:30] without even really doing it on purpose
[8:32] but it's just it's my desire and that's
[8:34] how I know a family should operate so
[8:38] God is always listening to us he's
[8:41] always watching us you understand what
[8:43] I'm saying so he don't want no ISM or no
[8:46] Schism in his body he don't want it in
[8:48] the home he don't want it in the church
[8:50] and even while we're out in the world
[8:52] God wants us to represent him properly
[8:56] yes
[8:58] amen
[9:05] my mind just it just go places Saints
[9:08] let me share this with you right
[9:11] here okay uh brother brandom kind of
[9:14] picks up on
[9:16] that kind of that body illustration and
[9:19] he says here and what is the what is the
[9:21] works of God 1959 April the 4th he says
[9:25] my finger could never take the place of
[9:28] my ear
[9:30] no matter how much it tried neither
[9:33] could my mouth take the place of my eye
[9:36] he says but each member knows what it
[9:38] can do and all of them notice our topic
[9:42] again coordination he say all of them
[9:45] coordinating he says together makes the
[9:48] body move he says if this church can
[9:51] only see that so now notice now this is
[9:54] this is not just brother Brandon this is
[9:56] the Holy Ghost amen and the Holy Ghost
[9:58] is taking the time just like he did
[10:00] through Paul to lay out the different
[10:03] parts of the body and to make those
[10:05] emphases that same God was here here
[10:07] here here right here with the prophet
[10:09] and he's taking a time to emphasize
[10:11] these points he says if this church can
[10:13] only see that what's that all of them
[10:17] coordinating makes the body
[10:19] move we left off with showing how
[10:22] brother brandham was showing that the
[10:24] third pool now God allowed the third
[10:26] pool to operate in his life to show us
[10:28] an example to give us a taste through
[10:31] his experiences of what we should expect
[10:34] and he said he said you're only going to
[10:36] see this a little bit in my Ministry but
[10:38] you wait when that squeeze comes upon
[10:40] the bride he says watch the third pool
[10:42] then that's right but then God comes
[10:45] through the prophet and he begins to
[10:47] emphasize this point it's going to take
[10:50] coordination in order for us to see that
[10:52] third pool work properly through the
[10:55] body am amen so the Holy Spirit right
[10:57] now is working with all of us to bring
[10:59] us to our places so that this thing can
[11:02] come into a a real
[11:04] manifestation amen
[11:06] right so then he comes down he says if
[11:09] you can only see that it takes
[11:11] coordination it takes cooperation with
[11:15] all the body of
[11:17] Christ so now when we talk about
[11:19] Heavenly
[11:21] atmospheres sitting together in Heavenly
[11:24] places what does that look like it's not
[11:27] complicated it's very
[11:29] simple but it takes the effort of every
[11:32] heart to create that atmosphere we're
[11:35] amateur creators
[11:36] right right so it's up to us to actually
[11:40] create the right atmosphere for God to
[11:42] be
[11:43] welcomed so he can come down in the
[11:45] midst of us and really work and move as
[11:47] he wants to listen there are real needs
[11:50] Among Us right now there are prayers
[11:53] that's been offered up countless times
[11:55] sometime maybe you've been waiting a
[11:57] long time for a certain prayer to be
[11:59] answered or whatever how many realize
[12:01] there is gifts in
[12:03] here can we say praise the Lord to that
[12:06] the prophet said there is gifts in every
[12:08] local assembly there's the gift of
[12:10] interpretation of tongues tongues
[12:12] prophecy you know the gift of knowledge
[12:16] wisdom helps healing right so we're
[12:20] praying and we're looking for God to
[12:22] come and move to give us the answer to
[12:24] certain prayers right but if we all get
[12:27] into our positions conse Our Lives to
[12:29] God God will come right down and Supply
[12:32] that need maybe through one of the
[12:33] members of the body why was it that
[12:36] people were so uh enthusiastic about
[12:39] brother brandom
[12:40] coming they wanted him over here they
[12:42] wanted him over there they wanted him
[12:45] everywhere why was that excuse me
[12:48] because he had become so surrendered to
[12:51] God and God has such a control over his
[12:54] life until God can take that human man
[12:57] and speak through his mouth to give help
[12:59] and healing to the rest of the body amen
[13:03] you understand what I'm saying his love
[13:04] for God came to a profound
[13:07] place that's what the ministry was all
[13:09] about it was a display of his love
[13:12] relationship with his God Amen so how
[13:16] are the gifts going to come into a
[13:18] manifestation Among Us it's not it's not
[13:21] going and seeking for a
[13:23] gift but it's giving our hearts to The
[13:25] Giver amen and as we give our hearts to
[13:28] the giver and we fall more in love with
[13:31] God you will begin to see these things
[13:34] automatically
[13:38] surfac it don't even have to be in a
[13:41] church
[13:43] setting the Holy Spirit can just move on
[13:46] you at any
[13:50] time Heavenly places Watch what he says
[13:53] about this cuz that's what we're talking
[13:55] about here adoption again 19
[13:59] 1960 May the 15th he says oh what could
[14:03] happen
[14:04] tonight what could happen tonight if we
[14:06] would just if we be sitting here in a
[14:09] Heavenly
[14:10] atmosphere and the Holy Spirit moving
[14:13] over every heart he says that's been
[14:16] regenerated and become a new creature in
[14:18] Christ Jesus all sins under the blood in
[14:22] perfect worship with our hands up to God
[14:26] and our hearts lifted setting he says in
[14:29] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[14:31] worshiping together in the Heavenly
[14:34] places I want to drop this in if I may
[14:38] brother brandham says sincerity brings
[14:41] real
[14:42] worship
[14:44] amen he says sincerity brings
[14:50] power if you don't have
[14:53] sincerity I'm just going to say it just
[14:55] very plainly if we don't have sincerity
[14:58] our worship means nothing to God
[15:03] right that's a subject I've been dealing
[15:06] with
[15:06] also cuz it's like wow because he says
[15:10] in vain do they worship
[15:12] me you worshiping you taking you taking
[15:14] the time the effort the money the the
[15:17] the the all that you put into going I'm
[15:19] not talking about you guys but just
[15:21] places that have false doctrines and
[15:23] things of that nature they go through
[15:25] the through all that extent of effort
[15:27] and time and money and all that put they
[15:29] pour into building a building and and
[15:32] Gathering of people and then and on
[15:35] service days they sing songs and they
[15:37] have wonderful sounding
[15:40] worship all the lyrics are together
[15:43] everything is in tune and all the
[15:44] musicians are in tune and every bit of
[15:47] it is rejected by
[15:50] God because they're not sincere that's
[15:54] right they don't really love God they're
[15:58] just giving God a
[16:02] performance but God is bringing us above
[16:04] all of that amen it's not just a
[16:07] performance it's not just a a physical
[16:10] workup but it's from the
[16:12] heart amen the same worship they gave
[16:15] him before God said it's a stench in my
[16:17] nostrils
[16:18] now why what happened what changed their
[16:21] hearts
[16:24] change praise God everybody understand
[16:27] that
[16:30] he goes on to
[16:35] say setting together in Heavenly places
[16:38] he says not one evil thought Among
[16:42] Us do you believe that's possible
[16:47] yes say
[16:50] Amen it's possible all things are
[16:53] possible through Christ Jesus but we
[16:55] deal with things so often and sometimes
[16:58] for so long we we we kind of lose sight
[17:02] that I can really be delivered there is
[17:04] a real place that I can come to where I
[17:07] can be free from this bondage of
[17:09] whatever kind of sin it is why because I
[17:12] got a God that's already died for me my
[17:15] sins are already paid for and within
[17:17] that plan that he made what did he do he
[17:19] released his own Spirit to come back and
[17:23] live inside of my soul so that I can now
[17:26] rise up above all the listen he's the
[17:29] one that defeats the enemy for us amen
[17:31] all we have to do is welcome him yes
[17:34] listen the Bible says if there first be
[17:36] a willing mind that is
[17:39] accepted according to what you have and
[17:41] not what you don't have right yes you
[17:44] can't beat this way God has laid out
[17:47] everything for us and his helping hand
[17:49] is here to just come right in and
[17:51] accommodate whatever we
[17:54] need all right he says not one evil
[17:57] thought talking about Heavenly
[17:58] atmospheres Heavenly places not one evil
[18:01] thought Among Us not one cigarette smoke
[18:04] not one short dress not one this that or
[18:07] the other not one evil thought nobody
[18:10] got anything against one
[18:13] another this is what he's calling
[18:15] Heavenly
[18:16] places most people had the idea oh we in
[18:19] Heavenly places brother do you feel the
[18:20] power of the Holy Spirit man the gifts
[18:23] operate you can have
[18:26] listen the lord gave us a well supplied
[18:29] message here you can have the gifts of
[18:32] the Spirit operating every and
[18:34] everything right but in the Bible it
[18:37] says all that say unto me Lord Lord
[18:39] shall not enter into the kingdom he says
[18:41] and they say haven't we prophesied in
[18:43] your name he said depart from me for I
[18:46] what I never knew you there was no
[18:49] relationship but yet it was the real
[18:51] power of God working among them so our
[18:54] focus is not on just the receiving of
[18:56] gifts but it's the to have a
[18:58] relationship with the giver yes amen
[19:02] that's the key note
[19:05] relationship with God and that'll bring
[19:08] the relationship among us that'll bring
[19:10] the real care that we need for one
[19:12] another so even though I'm preaching
[19:14] these things every bit of it is wrapped
[19:17] up into the baptism of the Holy Ghost it
[19:20] brings our
[19:21] perspectives it takes our perspectives
[19:24] from all these places and it brings it
[19:26] right in line with the mind of God cuz
[19:29] now that's what's working in us
[19:31] right so that's the number one thing
[19:34] listen if you're not sure that you have
[19:37] the baptism of the Holy
[19:39] Ghost let that be your
[19:43] priority and if you may have received it
[19:47] but need more so be it an initial
[19:50] feeling or a refilling let that be the
[19:54] focus every single day now now how do
[19:58] you come into that just on a daily basis
[20:01] submitting yourself to the things of God
[20:04] making time for God we make time for
[20:06] what we want to make time
[20:12] for that's the
[20:16] truth I don't know what the stores are
[20:18] around here right but whatever the
[20:22] favorite stores are you catch the news
[20:26] that they got a 99% sale
[20:29] on that means you get it for nothing now
[20:32] you got all kind of plans you got things
[20:35] to do and it's a one day
[20:40] sale you'll do whatever you can and at
[20:43] least try to make it the only way you
[20:45] won't make it is if you absolutely can't
[20:47] make a way but you'll be willing to
[20:48] change
[20:50] things because of the importance of
[20:53] getting something that would cost a $100
[20:55] for a
[20:57] dollar brother you know I can get you
[20:59] know what kind of deal I can
[21:01] get God is much he's worth much more
[21:04] than that so can't we make sacrifices
[21:07] can't we make time for him amen look
[21:11] whatever you have done up until this
[21:14] point where has it gotten you
[21:19] right when it comes to the things of God
[21:22] what more could you have
[21:26] done right with you already know is he
[21:29] worth that extra effort yes sir he is
[21:33] amen that's the way that's the road to
[21:36] travel in into all these areas and I'mma
[21:39] leave you with something at the end
[21:41] that's been a key to what God has really
[21:43] been doing in my life over these last
[21:45] few months it it helped me so much
[21:50] Saints I'm kind of I'm I'm just I'm just
[21:53] kind of like in awe to be honest amen
[22:01] okay not one evil thought Among Us not
[22:03] one cigarette smoke not one short dress
[22:06] not one this that or the other not one
[22:08] evil thought nobody got anything against
[22:10] another everybody speaking in love and
[22:13] harmony everybody with one Accord in one
[22:15] place he says then suddenly there came
[22:18] from Heaven a sound like A rushan Mighty
[22:20] Wind he says there you are has blessed
[22:22] us with all spiritual
[22:25] blessings okay so we touched on living
[22:28] our lives for others
[22:30] right and that's very
[22:33] important but I think God is kind of
[22:35] allowed me to see that in that
[22:37] particular way because it's like wow I
[22:40] didn't I I didn't ever considered it
[22:42] like that how I live my individual life
[22:45] within my own heart and my own mind my
[22:48] thoughts that I allow to flow through my
[22:49] mind it matters and it can affect my
[22:52] brothers and my
[22:54] sisters oh my God okay now watch watch
[22:58] this I'm not going to go back over
[23:07] that
[23:10] okay we we read the scripture where he
[23:12] he admonishes us that we love one
[23:14] another as he loved us he gave up a lot
[23:19] we realize that and when I say he gave
[23:21] up a lot meaning he lived a life on
[23:25] Earth that was going to be beneficial
[23:29] to the body of Christ he said I sanctify
[23:32] myself for their
[23:34] sakes how many remember that scripture
[23:37] it's John chapter 17 starting at Verse
[23:40] 18 he says as thou has sent me into the
[23:43] world even so have I sent also them or
[23:46] even even so have I also sent them into
[23:50] the world he says and for their sakes I
[23:54] sanctify myself that they also might be
[23:57] sanct ified through the truth so here it
[24:00] is he sees a need amongst these men and
[24:03] he's saying now I'm going to live my
[24:05] life in a certain way so that they can
[24:08] receive the full benefit of what's going
[24:10] to come from my life into their lives
[24:13] Amen brother brandom say he never Liv
[24:16] for himself he always he say he spent
[24:18] his entire time living his life for
[24:20] others now watch what brother brandom
[24:22] says here and what message is this this
[24:24] is called the the lamb and the dove he
[24:27] says
[24:28] while you're listening the most
[24:30] outstanding scripture he says one of
[24:32] them that I can think of is when Jesus
[24:34] said father think of it father for their
[24:36] sake I sanctify myself he says what was
[24:40] he doing setting the example for you and
[24:43] I and for them right he says he was a
[24:46] lamb what did he do he had a right to a
[24:49] home he was he was a man he had a right
[24:52] to be married he had he was a man he had
[24:54] a right to good clothes he was a man he
[24:57] say but he Sanctified himself he
[25:01] forfeited there are things that you and
[25:03] I could do places we could go right but
[25:06] it's not profitable for us it's not
[25:08] going to benefit us but it might hinder
[25:10] us it might it might create unnecessary
[25:13] battles is a term they use out in the
[25:16] world choose your battles wisely certain
[25:19] things we ain't got to have a battle
[25:21] with we actually go to the
[25:23] battle and we put ourselves in battle
[25:26] unnecessarily just stay away from the
[25:29] place stay away from the person don't
[25:32] watch it don't listen to it you
[25:34] eliminate the battle right there that's
[25:37] right I sanctify myself amen right he
[25:42] goes on to say um he could have he could
[25:45] have he could have come down the
[25:46] corridors of Glory a full statured man
[25:48] he says with an Angelic band sure he
[25:51] says but he Sanctified himself he could
[25:53] have at least been born in a nice clean
[25:55] bed somewhere but he was born in in a
[25:57] Manger over manure pile he says in a
[26:00] borrowed manger he says but he
[26:02] Sanctified himself why he was the lamb
[26:05] see friends we got to go back to the
[26:07] assembly line religion he says and so
[26:10] forth and all these things we're getting
[26:11] away from the real things humble
[26:14] yourself keep humble Lord I sanctify me
[26:17] he says Jesus was training some men that
[26:21] was going to take the gospel to the
[26:22] world 12 men so he lived a Sanctified
[26:26] life and for forfeited every worldly
[26:29] pleasure for their sakes glory to God
[26:34] see but he was God and he had the love
[26:37] that was necessary to be able to see
[26:39] them in the right way to lay down his
[26:42] life you
[26:46] understand but now we understand that we
[26:48] can lay down our lives also for our
[26:52] friends praise the Lord he says we ought
[26:55] to Forfeit our worldly dressing and our
[26:58] worldly pleasures and things like that
[27:00] for the sake of the people we're trying
[27:02] to lead to
[27:04] God Amen it's more than just word
[27:08] spoken we can we we we can learn the
[27:10] message or the gospel you know you can
[27:12] learn the verses of the Bible and you
[27:14] can go to somebody you can repeat words
[27:16] or whatever but what's more effective if
[27:19] there is a life that matches the words
[27:22] that are being
[27:24] spoken you understand what I'm saying
[27:26] now that's the working of the Holy ghost
[27:28] not just a right word to say and due
[27:30] season but a life that expresses Christ
[27:33] amen that puts God on display so that
[27:36] people can see a real God in their day
[27:39] remember the prophet said many people
[27:41] ain't going to never read their
[27:43] Bibles he said but they'll see you he
[27:45] said you'll be the only Bible they'll
[27:47] ever
[27:48] see why cuz your life is the message
[27:52] amen Paul said ye are our Epistles read
[27:56] of all men
[27:58] huh the more we surrender the more God
[28:01] molds us and our lives begins to reflect
[28:04] him more and more and he was the Living
[28:06] Word and we become the Living
[28:09] Word oh
[28:11] my praise the Lord Saints that's good to
[28:15] me amen he says he says let the dove
[28:18] come in tonight sanctify yourself that
[28:21] the dove of real faith will come in and
[28:24] take his
[28:26] abode
[28:28] all right I'mma try to draw it down to a
[28:31] close here but it's a few things I want
[28:32] to
[28:34] highlight when the Holy Ghost comes
[28:37] inside of you like I said it kind of
[28:38] brings your perspective into these
[28:40] places he works inside of us and he's
[28:43] been working right and he's working in
[28:45] each one of us I believe right now and
[28:48] he's bringing our focus and our sight
[28:50] and our attention to these needful areas
[28:53] because it's his work he see what needs
[28:55] to be done he's the gardener and so he's
[28:58] just dealing with us he's dealing with
[29:00] us but then I noticed that there's that
[29:03] Common Thread amongst all that really
[29:05] had the baptism of the Holy
[29:07] Ghost they begin to live their lives for
[29:09] other
[29:11] people watch this 1 Corinthians I'm
[29:14] sorry 2 Corinthians chapter 4 start at
[29:18] verse
[29:20] 10 2 Corinthians 4:10 he says always
[29:24] bearing about in the body how how how
[29:26] often
[29:28] how
[29:32] often always mean all the time right I
[29:36] mean like every
[29:37] day every every second every
[29:40] minute the Holy Spirit brings us con he
[29:43] brings into a consciousness of himself
[29:46] that's how we were able to fall into all
[29:47] kinds of sin and whatever when we lose
[29:49] consciousness of god notice how it says
[29:52] this always bearing about in the body he
[29:55] says the dying of the Lord Jesus
[29:59] what does that mean he died remember he
[30:01] said I would that you would love one
[30:04] another as I loved you he died to his
[30:07] own will remember in Gethsemane father
[30:10] if it be possible let this cup pass from
[30:13] me but nevertheless let thy will be done
[30:17] and not my will so it's a death to our
[30:19] own
[30:21] will you understand and allowing the
[30:24] will of God to have the
[30:26] Forefront
[30:28] God don't want to force us he want you
[30:30] to want that he wants us to want his
[30:33] will he don't want us to be forced to
[30:36] take his will what is that to him it
[30:38] it's
[30:39] meaningless if you got to force somebody
[30:41] if you say tell me you love
[30:45] me what good is that if somebody got you
[30:49] got you ain't told me you love
[30:51] me if somebody got to make a statement
[30:53] like that something is
[30:55] wrong let me ask you this question does
[30:58] God tell you he love
[31:01] you that's important right God wants to
[31:05] be freely told he wants us to freely
[31:07] serve him he don't want to force us to
[31:09] do nothing he wants us to give it to him
[31:11] freely without being
[31:13] provoked that's what it's all about he
[31:16] introduces himself we start our journey
[31:19] he begins to show us who he is and in
[31:21] turn we're to gain that appreciation for
[31:24] him to say Lord you are worth my time
[31:26] you are worth the giving of my life to
[31:28] you father you are worth me
[31:31] dying so that you can live on the inside
[31:34] of me that's the place Paul came to Paul
[31:37] said I I count everything I ever learned
[31:39] and saw whatever as dumb that I might
[31:42] gain the excy of Christ
[31:45] amen talk about a love
[31:49] relationship praise God but notice this
[31:51] life of sacrifice here he says in verse
[31:55] 11 I'm sorry verse vers 10 Again always
[31:58] bearing about in the body the dying of
[31:59] the Lord Jesus that the life also of
[32:02] Jesus might be made
[32:05] manifest
[32:06] where in our
[32:09] bodies praise God he says in verse 11
[32:12] for we which live are always delivered
[32:15] unto death for Jesus sake living your
[32:18] life for others right that the life also
[32:20] of Jesus might be made manifest in our
[32:23] mortal flesh he says so then death
[32:27] worketh in us but what in turn of that
[32:31] life in you so the more we die the more
[32:35] life comes to you because we become
[32:37] condu of the flow of the spirit of God
[32:40] that affects you in such a way until you
[32:44] begin to die to yourself and you begin
[32:45] to enter into that same love
[32:51] relationship 1 Corinthians chapter 4 and
[32:54] verse
[32:56] 9
[32:58] he says for I think he says for I think
[33:00] that God have set forth us the apostles
[33:04] last as it were appointed to death for
[33:08] we are made a spectacle unto the world
[33:11] and to angels and to Men He says we are
[33:14] fools for Christ's sake but ye are wise
[33:18] notice they were taking this
[33:19] condemnation from the world because they
[33:21] were used by God to spearhead these
[33:24] revivals but it caused a lot of
[33:26] persecution
[33:28] they had to endure with a lot a lot of
[33:31] wrongdoing a lot of people they tried to
[33:34] kill Paul how many times one time they
[33:37] stoned him so he was unconscious and God
[33:39] had to well I think he actually died and
[33:41] God had to come and actually raise him
[33:43] up and when he got up because the Holy
[33:45] Ghost was so powerful so so full within
[33:48] him he went on to the next
[33:50] assignment that's a real life of
[33:52] sacrifice I'm not saying we got to go
[33:54] through that but whatever God chooses
[33:58] right amen he says we are fools for
[34:02] Christ's sake but ye are wise in Christ
[34:04] you're benefiting from our dying amen we
[34:07] are weak he says but you are strong amen
[34:11] he says ye are honorable and we are
[34:13] despised we're carrying forth this
[34:16] gospel and all the demons that are upon
[34:18] these religious leaders they're
[34:19] persecuting us they're blaspheming our
[34:22] names and all of these things but yet by
[34:24] our sacrifice it's causing you to now
[34:27] live in the sight of God and we're
[34:30] gladly giving our lives for
[34:33] you
[34:35] my amen he says in verse 11 even un this
[34:38] unto this present hour he says we both
[34:41] hunger and thirst and are naked and are
[34:43] buffered and and and have no certain
[34:45] dwelling place and labor working with
[34:48] our own hands being reviled we blessed
[34:51] being persecuted we suffer it being
[34:54] defamed he says we entreat he says we
[34:57] are made as the filth of the world and
[34:59] are the offscouring of all things until
[35:03] this day look at what he had to deal
[35:05] with for the sake of bringing that
[35:07] gospel Saints but the people because God
[35:11] was in him the people that he was
[35:13] laboring for he saw as being so valuable
[35:17] he said you're worth me giving my life
[35:20] for the sake of seeing you being able to
[35:22] live in your
[35:23] purpose
[35:25] amen amen
[35:27] and that's the place that the Holy
[35:29] Spirit I believe is bringing each one of
[35:31] us to amen so I'm going to make a few
[35:34] last points here that I want to leave
[35:36] with you that I think are very
[35:40] needful Matthew 18 and verse
[35:50] 6 Matthew 18 and: 6 says but who so
[35:54] shall offend one of these little ones
[35:56] which believe in me it were better for
[35:59] him that a millstone were hanged about
[36:01] his neck and that he would drown in the
[36:03] depth of the sea he says woe unto the
[36:06] world because of offenses for it must
[36:08] needs be that offenses come but woe to
[36:11] that man by whom the offense come in the
[36:14] Amplified Bible that same few verses
[36:16] read is this but whoever calls as one of
[36:19] these little ones I'm talking about our
[36:21] lives affecting other people yes Ain
[36:25] ain's life was connected
[36:27] right and he caused Israel to come into
[36:31] a great downfall and defeat on that day
[36:35] right we already went through that part
[36:37] of it so we're not going to go back over
[36:39] that again but we see how our lives can
[36:41] affect people positively or negatively
[36:44] but notice God's view here and it
[36:46] Amplified it gives a little more of a
[36:48] picture of it but whosoever causes one
[36:51] of these little ones who believe in me
[36:53] to stumble and
[36:55] sin you place a wrong example before
[36:58] somebody that's following your
[37:02] influence no matter where you might
[37:05] be watch how he says this by leading him
[37:09] away from my teaching it would be better
[37:12] for him to have a heavy Millstone hung
[37:14] around his neck and to be drowned in the
[37:17] depth of the
[37:19] sea so in God's mind if you call
[37:22] somebody that would believe on me that's
[37:25] currently trying to come to me to
[37:27] stumble because of your influence in
[37:29] their life and they see a wrong example
[37:32] come from you and you he said
[37:34] look I don't play with
[37:38] that just something to be mindful of
[37:41] because you know the way that the enemy
[37:43] had Eve or caus Eve to do what she did
[37:46] is because he took
[37:48] away he took away the seriousness of the
[37:51] repercussions of her
[37:53] decisions God said you will die if you
[37:55] eat of this tree
[37:57] Satan say you ain't going to die God is
[38:00] trying to keep you back from gaining
[38:01] more
[38:02] knowledge isn't that how things happen
[38:05] right the Devil comes in and tries to
[38:07] lessen the seriousness of what could
[38:10] happen as a
[38:12] result and now now that enables a person
[38:15] to feel like well I can go ahead because
[38:17] I I can
[38:20] just praise the Lord
[38:24] Amen brother brandom says let's live our
[38:26] lives for our neighbor sake let's live
[38:28] our lives for the people on our job sake
[38:32] you know just people that you will come
[38:34] in contact with and have an influence
[38:36] over or can influence live your life for
[38:39] that
[38:41] person all right so now I'mma give I'mma
[38:44] give these two examples
[38:46] here um and these really touch my heart
[38:51] amen okay we already went over in the
[38:54] first service what brother brandom says
[38:56] by our misconduct and our unconfessed
[38:58] sins we can block somebody from healing
[39:01] we can we can block the church from
[39:03] progressing
[39:04] right watch these two examples here
[39:07] Saints especially this first one this
[39:10] message is called how the angel came to
[39:12] me um and his
[39:14] commission he says there is a lady
[39:17] sitting right back over there in the
[39:19] corner I see that light hanging over her
[39:23] so the Holy Spirit the angel of the Lord
[39:25] was present
[39:27] and he was drawn to that woman he says I
[39:30] see I see that I see that light hanging
[39:33] over he says that's the only way I can
[39:36] tell what he says what about it he says
[39:39] that's light that light that that
[39:40] light's hanging this light right here is
[39:43] hanging over the lady maybe just maybe
[39:47] he says maybe just in a minute if I can
[39:49] see what it is it'll break talking about
[39:52] what God want to show him he says listen
[39:54] to this Saints the lady is suffering
[39:57] with a heart
[40:02] trouble she's looking right to me he
[40:05] says and her husband is sitting next to
[40:09] her and her husband has got some
[40:12] sickness he's he says he's just been
[40:15] sick upset sick he says that's he says
[40:18] isn't that right sir raise your hands up
[40:21] if that's right if that's true he says
[40:23] that's right he says it's you lady with
[40:25] the little scarf there the mister isn't
[40:28] that right haven't you been just kind of
[40:31] upset today watch he says you have upset
[40:35] in your stomach the man that's right you
[40:38] all believe with all your heart both of
[40:40] you you accept it sir notice this now

[40:50] one man pass in front of the other by
[40:53] one by one and he stopped with aching
[40:56] and he begin to hone in on him so now
[40:59] you see all these people in this
[41:01] Auditorium but now God is naring it down
[41:05] to one situation and now he keeps
[41:07] focusing in on that husband but the
[41:09] woman has the heart trouble watch
[41:13] this he says sir I tell you he says you
[41:17] too I see you with your hand up he says

[41:25] that's the holy Spirit
[41:27] right he says quit doing that he says

[41:32] cigars you shouldn't do that makes you
[41:38] sick watch how he says this saint he
[41:40] says isn't that right sir raise your
[41:43] hands up if that's true I'm sorry he
[41:45] said you smoke cigars you shouldn't do
[41:47] that makes you sick isn't that right if

[44:36] isn't that right I can't see you from
[44:38] here he says and you know that he says
[44:40] but you're carrying cigars in your
[44:43] pocket in the front he says lay the
[44:46] things out and put listen to this now

[44:50] pocket right now lay the things out and
[44:53] put it over he says and put your hand
[44:56] over on your wife tell God that you are
[44:59] through with that kind of stuff and
[45:02] you'll go home well and and you and your
[45:06] wife will get
[45:09] well his wife's
[45:13] cure was him stopping
[45:17] smoking they were
[45:21] connected you think about prayer
[45:24] requests and just different things that
[45:26] go on in different
[45:30] places this open my
[45:33] eyes you understand what I'm saying is
[45:36] when people have prayer requests and
[45:37] whatever like oh Satan is moving amongst
[45:40] the people you know all kind of things
[45:41] or whatever but then they're not even
[45:44] mindful of the fact that that little
[45:46] secret sin you have could be causing
[45:48] that prayer
[45:54] request second one
[45:56] it's a little girl
[45:58] here she had what they call hodkin
[46:03] disease a little girl come here not long
[46:06] ago from the high school her mother
[46:08] called me up said brother brandom my
[46:10] little girl praise God has got Harkin
[46:14] disease he says that's cancer forms in
[46:17] lumps and the doctors took a piece from
[46:20] from a break on her on her throat send
[46:23] it away and it was perfectly hot skins
[46:25] disase
[46:27] so so he said the next one breaks may
[46:29] break over her heart when it does she's
[46:32] gone she's going to die he says said
[46:35] she's got uh the way the way they're
[46:38] breaking she's got any anywhere about
[46:40] three months to live the mother
[46:44] said what shall I do send her back to
[46:46] school talking to the doctor right uh
[46:50] said let her go because she'll go
[46:52] probably suddenly and said she let her
[46:55] she let her go and let her go just let
[46:57] her go and live a normal life as she can
[47:00] don't tell her nothing about it so the
[47:02] lady said to me what must I
[47:06] do she went to the doctor there wasn't
[47:10] nothing for the doctor to do because the
[47:12] cure for her daughter lied within
[47:18] her bring her up brother brandom says
[47:21] watch this Saints and put her in the
[47:23] prayer line and I said you come with her
[47:27] he said I felt a little funny
[47:30] feeling the Holy Spirit
[47:34] moving the little girl needed healing
[47:36] she was going to die he said you bring
[47:38] her up but you come with
[47:45] her and when a little girl come by that
[47:48] morning with blue blue looking lips from
[47:51] makeup and as the school has them and
[47:53] the little thing come by I didn't know

[48:09] them without god without Christ I said
[48:12] how can you expect healing on these
[48:18] grounds will you accept now listen they
[48:20] going to the doctor the doctor telling
[48:23] her what he's telling her but the do the
[48:26] Lord made it that way to where nobody
[48:29] else couldn't do anything for them
[48:31] because he was going to use this bondage
[48:34] as a
[48:37] Deliverance there's a strange statement
[48:39] brother Brandon makes and I I wondered
[48:41] at it for a while but I think I finally
[48:43] understand it he says the hair off of a
[48:46] dog's back is good to put on the bite
[48:48] from the
[48:51] dog praise God God is using this very
[48:55] situation
[48:56] to actually bring Deliverance to
[48:58] them you understand the working of Satan
[49:01] being used to actually bring them out of
[49:06] bondage watch
[49:09] this just in a few moments look down saw
[49:12] a mother how can you expect healing on
[49:14] these grounds will you accept Jesus
[49:16] Christ as your personal savior I said
[49:18] will you come to this pool here and be
[49:21] baptized in the Name of Christ for the
[49:23] remission of sins they said we will will
[49:25] do that he says oh you know what
[49:29] happened the woman may be sitting here
[49:31] this morning many of you know the case
[49:33] brother Mike Egan one of the trustees
[49:35] here watched the case that's been about
[49:38] four or five years ago the little girl
[49:40] was took back to the doctor not even one
[49:43] trace of Harkins disease was found in
[49:48] her her mother was seeking help but she
[49:52] didn't know that her decision was The
[49:54] Cure
[49:56] her decision to live for God and not
[49:58] only live for God live for her
[50:02] daughter and the disease was taken away
[50:04] the devil was cast
[50:06] out they were
[50:10] connected they were
[50:15] connected I feel led to stop right there
[50:18] Saints I feel that
[50:20] I've issued out given out what's been
[50:23] placed on my heart to give I do I
[50:26] believe without even asking I know you
[50:30] understand right and for these areas for
[50:34] these types of subjects it's not so it's
[50:37] not joyous meaning it doesn't make you
[50:39] happy but it's joyous to see that God
[50:42] comes in and deals with us in such
[50:46] detail remember in the Bible it says in
[50:48] Malachi I believe the son of
[50:50] righteousness shall arise with healing
[50:52] in his
[50:53] wings how did that come about through
[50:56] God coming through a prophet and
[50:58] Discerning the thoughts and the intents
[51:00] of the heart getting down to the root
[51:02] cause of issues and bringing about real
[51:06] healing amongst the people that's what C
[51:09] every time Christ comes that's what he
[51:11] does he sets us free amen amen so I pray
[51:16] that Beyond this service that the Lord
[51:19] would continue to deal with all of our
[51:20] hearts it's his work we're his body he
[51:23] loves us he watches over his word the
[51:26] Bible says to perform it so I pray that
[51:29] God is continue to deal with all of us
[51:31] and help us to die to ourselves and to
[51:34] submit ourselves to
[51:36] him now there's a a a gold nugget that I
[51:40] said I was going to give to you I didn't
[51:43] say a gold nugget but it was a little
[51:45] something at the end it but it's a gold
[51:47] nugget
[51:50] amen all right I need for you take a
[51:54] real strong mental notive you ain't got
[51:56] nothing to write
[51:58] with or just write it down if you
[52:03] can I'm not speaking uh I'm not saying
[52:07] this just because I'm behind the pull
[52:10] pit just the UT forth words because it
[52:13] sounds right or whatever um I'm speaking
[52:16] this because of the realities that I've
[52:19] experienced
[52:21] myself I needed
[52:23] help I was tired of dealing with certain
[52:26] things
[52:28] continuously you know um I wanted to be
[52:33] more free than I ever been free
[52:36] before you know I wanted to have a just
[52:39] my mind wanted everything to just to
[52:42] come into a higher place a less plagued
[52:47] place and the Lord led me
[52:50] here and in my life I'm seeing the
[52:54] benefits
[52:55] of what he's come to prove to me is true
[52:58] God wants to prove his word to each one
[53:00] of us he wants us to know that he's real
[53:02] and that his word is right yes amen
[53:06] watch this now I'mma narrow this down to
[53:09] these few verses of scripture here
[53:11] something to just kind of take to heart
[53:13] I talked with brother Jesse about this
[53:15] on
[53:16] yesterday you're going to have to be led
[53:19] in your own in your own lives to really
[53:23] enter this but this is a tool that you
[53:25] can
[53:26] use to gain more victory in your
[53:30] life Isaiah
[53:33] 58 and I want to start here at
[53:40] um verse
[53:42] 6 Isaiah 58 and verse
[53:48] 6 he says is not this the fast that I
[53:52] have
[53:54] chosen
[53:55] I'm not going to ask how many people
[53:57] fasting here I'm just going to point
[54:00] this out right and if you if you are
[54:02] sincere if you if you if you mean
[54:04] business with God I'm telling you God is
[54:08] going to come and prove to you his word
[54:11] is not this the fast that I have chosen
[54:14] he says to loose the bands of
[54:17] wickedness so through fasting it brings
[54:22] Deliverance he says to undo the heav
[54:25] heavy
[54:26] burdens if your heart is burdened you
[54:28] got things that are waiting you
[54:31] down fasting becomes an Avenue through
[54:35] which God will release you from that
[54:37] heavy
[54:38] burden he says and to let the oppressed
[54:42] Go free oppression is not possession you
[54:45] might not be possessed by a devil but
[54:47] you got certain spirits that have gained
[54:49] a certain level of success within your
[54:53] life over time
[54:55] and those particular ones keep sweeping
[55:00] by and in one place the Bible says Satan
[55:04] takes people under his control at will
[55:08] because of that weakness that's there is
[55:10] like you always give over to it if you
[55:12] want to be free from that he says to let
[55:15] the oppressed Go
[55:18] free and notice and that who
[55:24] break you ye break every
[55:29] yoke so a yoke is used to control
[55:32] something they put Yol on oxen and
[55:34] things of that nature to drive it
[55:36] wherever they want to drive it yeah it's
[55:39] a control
[55:41] mechanism that's what demons do once
[55:44] they
[55:46] gain that place and they begin to drive
[55:49] people into things they don't even
[55:51] really want to do they don't want to do
[55:54] it but they become a slave to it they
[55:56] find themselves being weak and that's
[55:58] just due to a lack of
[56:01] consecration but God is giving us an
[56:03] answer right here if you want to be free
[56:05] from these things you enter into a
[56:08] sincere fast with these as a
[56:11] focus your self-reflecting lord I want
[56:14] to be free from this once and for all
[56:17] it's worth the sacrifice Saints I'm
[56:19] telling
[56:22] you verse 8 says then as as a result of
[56:25] fasting he says then shall thy light
[56:28] Break Forth as the
[56:30] morning and thine Health y your
[56:32] spiritual health being free from the
[56:34] sickness of sin he says and thy Health
[56:37] shall spring forth speedily God will
[56:40] recover you he'll cast that devil out
[56:43] right shall spring forth speedily and
[56:45] thy righteousness shall go before Thee
[56:48] the glory of the Lord shall be thy
[56:50] rearward notice in verse n we got
[56:54] prayers that we pray but the Bible says
[56:56] if there is some kind of condemnation in
[56:58] your heart you can't have
[57:01] confidence so you going to pray but
[57:03] because something is in your life and
[57:06] and that devil holds that over your head
[57:08] when you go to pray sometime well God do
[57:10] you even hear me you can't have a
[57:13] confidence but notice what it says here
[57:17] verse n then shalt thou call and the
[57:20] Lord shall answer amen so that means
[57:23] that he don't just come and readily
[57:25] answer us when everything ain't on good
[57:28] terms between us and
[57:30] him right he repeats the same thing in
[57:33] the New Testament but he's saying here
[57:35] if you give yourself over to this
[57:37] lifestyle of consecration with includes
[57:39] which includes fasting then shalt thou
[57:42] call and the Lord shall answer Thou
[57:44] shalt cry and he shall say here am I if
[57:48] thou take away from the midst of Thee
[57:50] the Yoke and the putting forth of the of
[57:51] the finger and speaking vanities right
[57:54] right I'm going to skip down he says in
[57:56] verse 11 and the Lord shall guide thee
[57:59] continually as a result of fasting and
[58:02] the Lord shall guide thee continually
[58:04] how many want to be guided by God
[58:05] continually amen that means you ain't
[58:08] wasting time on stuff that's unnecessary
[58:11] right he says and satisfy thy soul in
[58:14] drought in a spiritual drought I'mma
[58:17] give you what you need to feed you I'm
[58:19] going to give you the moisture of my
[58:22] spirit right he's he's the Fountain of
[58:24] Living Waters he told the woman at the
[58:26] well take a
[58:28] drink her soul was in a drought isn't
[58:32] that
[58:32] right and what was the result of her
[58:35] drinking from that life flow it healed
[58:38] her praise God Amen then he says and the
[58:42] Lord shall guide thee continually and
[58:44] satisfy thy soul and drought watch and
[58:47] make fat thy bones your bones is a
[58:49] strength it's a strength of your body
[58:51] God I'll strengthen you all this is
[58:54] result of fasting
[58:56] now I'm telling you Saints it's the
[58:59] truth it
[59:00] works Amen brother brandham fasted but
[59:04] Paul said I fasted often brother
[59:07] brandham he fasted often many times
[59:10] three days before he was going to have a
[59:11] healing service and before he preached
[59:14] he would fast on certain days of the
[59:16] week it was incorporated we see the
[59:19] success of it watch this now I'm closing
[59:22] on this and make fat thy bone
[59:25] and thou shalt be like a watered garden
[59:27] and like a spring of water whose Waters
[59:30] fail
[59:31] not and they that shall be of thee shall
[59:34] build the old waste places that that
[59:37] thou shalt raise up the foundation of
[59:39] many generations so ACC so so as a
[59:41] result of you fasting you're going to
[59:43] cause other people to begin to prosper
[59:45] and recover and be taken from the snares
[59:48] of the devil to begin to live the life
[59:50] that God intended for them to live
[59:52] you're going to raise up the foundation
[59:54] he says of many
[59:57] generations praise the Lord he says and
[1:00:00] thou shalt be called the repairer of the
[1:00:02] breach the restore of the paths to dwell
[1:00:04] in if thou turn away thy foot from the
[1:00:07] Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my
[1:00:10] holy day and call the Sabbath of delight
[1:00:12] of the holy of the Lord honorable and
[1:00:15] shalt honor him not doing your own ways
[1:00:18] he says we see
[1:00:22] that where is it at not doing your own
[1:00:25] ways right you living for me now you
[1:00:28] ain't worrying about this having your
[1:00:30] way the way you wanted and if you don't
[1:00:31] now you got an attitude no now you begin
[1:00:34] to Value what my will is for your life
[1:00:36] over your own amen right nor finding thy
[1:00:40] own pleasure nor look speaking thy own
[1:00:46] words he want to have that control over
[1:00:49] you the way he use your mouth your
[1:00:51] tongue is surrendered to him amen amen
[1:00:57] man he says in verse 14 then shalt thou
[1:01:01] then thou then shalt thou Delight
[1:01:04] thyself in the Lord and I will cause
[1:01:06] thee to ride upon the high places of the
[1:01:09] earth and feed thee with the heritage of
[1:01:12] Jacob thy father for the mouth of the
[1:01:14] Lord have spoken
[1:01:20] it take that
[1:01:23] and lock Got Away in your
[1:01:26] heart and I know when it comes to
[1:01:30] fasting you just
[1:01:33] can't you you need to be led to enter
[1:01:36] into
[1:01:37] it but at the same
[1:01:39] time if you got a certain thing going on
[1:01:42] in your body and you go to the doctor
[1:01:44] and the doctor say oh that's a result of
[1:01:46] you drinking
[1:01:49] sodas that pain you feel that's because
[1:01:51] you're drinking soda you need to stop
[1:01:53] drinking sodas
[1:01:55] do you need to wait to stop drinking
[1:01:58] sodas once you realize that's the thing
[1:02:00] that's negatively affecting my body I
[1:02:03] can be free from what I'm experiencing
[1:02:05] if I just stop you're going to
[1:02:09] stop so we're not trying to force this
[1:02:12] upon nobody as a religious act CU your
[1:02:16] heart and your mind needs to be in the
[1:02:18] right place whenever you enter into it
[1:02:20] but you can't deny the benefits that God
[1:02:23] has laid out concerning what it brings
[1:02:27] so if you want these things in your
[1:02:30] life it's at your you you have access to
[1:02:34] it pray for me Saints I'll be praying
