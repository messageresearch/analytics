[Music] [Music] I just to come and talk about the worthy one praise God to get our lives to one who is worthy praise God Amen let's go to first John chapter 4 like to take our text from first John 4 verse 1 we're willing I'd like to finish this little series on how can I overcome so this morning we like to do part 4 first on chapter 4 verse 1 even had people from other states you know reach out and say I really enjoy your series on how can I overcome I said well it's not mine it's the Lord's thank the Lord for that so anyone gets blessed it's all glory to the Lord Jesus Christ he is worthy praise God he's worthy of this our lives given as a sweet-smelling savour unto the Lord first John chapter 4 like to greet everybody the name of Lord Jesus Christ good to be with you and worship just want to make sure I got the prayer requests okay by the grace of Lord I'd like to start at verse 1 I'll read for a few verses then we'll read verse 4 together very familiar passage here I'd like to read verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world I remember in Galatians 1 Paul puts himself in that group he said if I or an angel or we teach anything other than what was first taught let it be accursed so this means we test every preacher we test everyone who comes to our door we test everything we see on YouTube everything we see on there we test everything by the word verse 2 hereby know ye the Spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and that is the spirit of Antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already it is I'm sorry is it in the world this was written after 1890 right so this is 60 years after the Holy Ghost fell and John's assuring them it's already out in the world now let's read verse 4 it together one two three ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world let's have a word of Prayer as we bow our heads here Heavenly Father we love you today Lord and we're just happy to be worshiping one who is worthy none of us are worthy we all fall short of the glory our righteousness of our own selves is as filthy rags Lord we are trusting in your righteousness and lower we overcome by your power within us by simply yielding our will by simply doing what you you'd like us to do because we know know what's best for us to do Lord God and Lord you would never lead us in a way that would be wrong or selfish Lord or or or and anything at all Lord that would be evil but you always lead us into righteousness Lord and so we're happy to yield our lives to you help us today to yield again Lord each day we die daily help us Lord God to you to you that we might be overcomers or we want to be part of that group that inherits all seven rewards Lord God as overcomers help us today Jesus Lord God to hear your voice Lord move amongst us as we just saying may this be one of those services Lord where we can say Lord and ever as every service should be that you're moving amongst us Lord that you're moving in our lives that you're moving in the lives of the saints Lord God granite we pray and father anoint us now for your service the speaker and they here in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you see the praise God so I was back to a case you could just switch over I just have a few things I want to share here by God's grace I just want to give a little update you know this week I uploaded my our latest video you can see it there in the corner it's hell is not eternal and I don't know if you can see the numbers there but it's doing really well it's it's just interesting to see what people are feeding on out of the last 10 uploads it's number one so it's neat to see that and the views are up 122 percent the average durations up ninety nine percent and the watch I'm is up four hundred sixty four percent so it's neat so if I just click that maybe you can see it so Hal's not eternal is first wise of foolish virgins second abomination in the Bible do the Ten Commandments apply to Christians predestination the new book I just released about the new book a video about that ministry updates Revelation chapter 14 and then home church part 3 it's just interesting to see what God does with that I just heard brother Adam say actually I was on the message thirst brother ran thank the Lord that they could do phone hookups through the phone and he was he said what a blessing it is and now we got Internet you know what a blessing that is that people wandering all that maybe they went from this bad video to that bad video but maybe the Holy Spirit directed them to our videos praise God and just it could be a great blessing if we use it for God's glory we're up to nine thousand four hundred subscribers and we almost have nine hundred thousand views so when we get to a million I don't know I'm gonna do something about that but that'll be here is to think a little church like ours with a million views you know so we're just thankful just want to update you on that and Lord willing today we'll be looking at how can I overcome brother Branham emphasizes lilies so I'm just gonna leave this picture up here well that's kind of the thought I'm gonna get to it's just the waterlily this is a major thought he deals with here in the in the text and so I want to get to that sister Connie's live streaming Lord bless you sister Connie praise the Lord so let's let's go back here to our text here I want to make a few beginning statements here and I want to just review real quick just to kind of give you a little background again about this sermon I don't know if you listen to it lately but bro Graham said that he got this thought from another Minister and he said it wasn't a message minister and that's why I like I like how brother Branham always models apostolic apostolic order I'll say like that so brother Adam could listen to other preachers and he could pull thoughts from them even though they didn't believe the message because he talks about he believed in divine healing the the preacher that he heard it from he said but he didn't disagree he didn't he didn't agree with everything brother Ram said he said I like a man like that who's got a backbone he said but I like that and that's how you and I you know that's how we are too we can be blessed by talking to anybody right because we can see how God works through each individual and whether they're Methodist Baptist or what a Jewish I have a little Jewish girl my class and I can I can even appreciate things that she says because it's coming down to their holidays in fact we just pressed Rosh Hashanah and she took a whole week off her family took a week off to worship the Lord and she was memorizing the Torah and I say praise the Lord you know that's our God our God is the God of the Torah he's just advanced praise the Lord and so I liked how brother Graham could do that and he just didn't listen to his own sermons he could listen to any preacher and he could see the thought that God wanted to get to him right and so that's what this message came from and he preached this the morning and then the evening he preached perfect faith for a healing service thought was a great combination of sermons right we need to overcome so we can have perfect faith because we can't have perfect faith unless we overcome sins that we're battling right now praise God what a beautiful combination of topics there that the Holy Spirit gave to our prophet and so he starts it off again just wrote I just want to go real briefly he talks about how we've got to overcome in Laodicea that's where he starts and we have one purpose in Laodicea that's to overcome and many people are getting Dodi or lazy on the Lord but we've got to be about the Father's business praise God he types the elect from the non elect and God always has overcomers and then he starts with Noah and we looked at that in part one and then part two we looked at Daniel as an overcomer the next was Shadrach Meshach and Abednego and then in part three we looked at lot as an overcomer and his two daughters and we ended that that message remember a couple Wednesday nights ago by looking at the life of brother Mike durdle remembering our precious brother who overcame the spirit of Sodom and Gomorrah all right doing both here today alright praise the Lord so he overcame now for those who didn't hear it my girdle was a wonderful brother he went to brother Jonathan Martin's Church in Lima used to be brother Brooks's Church and brother Craig brewer's church and he overcame homosexuality what a beautiful testimony of overcoming the sin of homosexuality praise God and you can say if you met him you could say I knew somebody who came out of Sodom praise the Lord now remember of course the Bible said any spiritual fornication is Sodom right it's a it's an evil thing in other words we all came out of Sodom somehow praise God we all came out of some sin but this man was in the actual physical sins of Sodom Gomorrah and he was an overcomer in church I believe there's a great crown in heaven awaiting him praise the Lord because he left that and he chose to suffer right escape the pleasures of sin for a season amen that he might suffer with the Lord's righteous view praise the Lord amen like Moses of old amen and like lot and his daughters how they overcame Sodom and Gomorrah and so coming now to this point here I told you I go real fast that's our review real fast next program mentions this now I don't know where he got this thought perhaps he got it from the preacher who he heard the message from but he said in the days of John the Baptist he said there were six over comers now of course you know there was actually more than that right because what about all the people John baptized but brother I was making a point that if you look at the days of John the Baptist's and before Christ the Bible highlights six of them so that's what brother Ram is saying there we know there was more say than just six but the Bible highlights six of them and six is the number of man now we looked at that last year and we showed clearly through the Bible that six doesn't just mean bad parts of man it also represents the good parts of man because when God made Adam he was a perfect man praise God he was in the stature of the fullness of a godly man but then he chose to fall from it in order to redeem his wife praise and he willingly disobeyed the word of God but he was anointed when God made him he was anointed praise God and of course you remember the six pieces of the the armour of God praise the Lord there six amen not seven there six because it's what man needs to be fully anointed by God's Spirit hallelujah and so Rob Ram listen he said in John the Baptist I'm we found six had overcome and he said notice a man a woman a man a woman because he names he names Joseph Mary and then Zacharias Elizabeth Simeon and Anna he said man woman man and a woman he said see it's Christ and the church Christ and the church Christ and the church phrase God that's an interesting type I like that one praise the Lord he said but now notice he said look at the men he said look at the men Joseph was a carpenter he said and then Zacharias is a priest and then Simeon is a prophet so Brougham sees the progression of greater calling right or higher cuz I have this higher responsibility I shouldn't say greater calling forgive me everybody has a great calling the Bible said it's your high calling Amen with some callings have more responsibility and so they get a greater reward but they also if failed they get a greater punishment praise God and then brother brother man makes that statement I want to find this in Scripture where he said our sisters will get a greater reward than some brothers because they forsaken more so I want to find that in Scripture if any of you have a clue on that let me know many because many times sure yeah you know the Holy Spirit will bring it to you but then also there's great resources like them the like the encyclopedias and the reference books from the days of like Martin Luther so like the Bible dictionaries if you look up a scripture it'll give you a list of like twenty others that all say the same thing like Tory's topical textbook there's all these nice tools that we can use and we can benefit from the sacrifices of men that have labored in the word their entire lives we reap the benefits of their labors amen because it all ties together the bible does we said notice and he said these three carpenter priest prophet he said represent justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost amen that's very interesting now I can't really explain that other than by saying that each one is a greater responsibility than the other right we all want to be faithful at our job don't want to be faithful in the job this week I don't want to get fired for being a bad worker because I neglected my responsibilities I want to do my responsibility and I want to be a shining light of Christ while I'm doing it but then there's a higher role than that working out in the man's world right and man's economy there's a higher calling there's a higher responsibility than that and that's serving in the house of God amen it's even more responsibility but then a beyond that is being an interpreter of the word because a prophet is who the Word of God comes to praise the Lord and so that's an even higher responsibility to make sure you say only what God says as Balaam found out you only do what God tells you to do praise God the first time you ask a man right and so those three pairs three pairs man woman man woman of course Simeon and Anna I don't I don't believe we're married I don't believe so I could be wrong on that does anyone can correct me on that real quick okay I didn't think they were but but notice and here's the thought I had noticed each of these six had a ministry what was Joseph and Mary's to instruct and lead Jesus they had to tell him what to do because remember we looked at that what do we talk about last Sunday night Jesus Christ the only scripture that went that described his life from 12 year old to 30 was that he was in subjection to his parents for 18 years and church that will be the proof that you and I are truly led by the Holy Spirit well we are subject to every word of God those who are discipline remember what does Enoch mean does it mean emotional no this Enoch mean excitable no there's Enoch mean current charismatic no Enoch means disciplined Amen hallelujah praise the Lord he was disciplined to the world Amen he obeyed the word that's why God said you want to come home you want to leave all that behind and come up with me you live so true to me we've had such a good relationship you've been walking with me all these years why don't you just come on up to heaven Amen that's right church amen it's the discipline it's Jesus being disciplined to the word overcoming Amen hallelujah obeying every word of God hallelujah God loved it so much he said come walk with me praise the Lord omma but see each had a ministry Joseph and Mary had to instruct the word right the little boy the word they had to give him an direction and he had to obey now of course we know he they failed that they had at least a fail one time in their parenting but Jesus always kept the word but they had a ministry that to feed and protect him and minister to him when he was sick right and take care of him and Zacharias his ministry was a priest Elizabeth was a homemaker and we know that because brother Graham said the only way that angel could visit Zacharias and the temple was because they were praying in their home so Elizabeth was keeping the home pure from any sin and because she did that and because Zacharias was living clean and keeping his priestly duties the angel could visit Zacharias and answer their prayer for a baby praise God amen it could bring fruit to the barren woman why because they always wanted to walk with Jesus they were disciplined to the word oh yes angels visited them because of their faithfulness they're overcoming now I find it striking - he was even working inside of the denominational system of that day and he still becau to overcome ah that's striking just like lot was the overcomer as a foolish virgin so see there's levels of over covering there's the foolish virgin over covering right where they turn down the denominational spirit of the Antichrist spear but they still stay in their ministries but then there's the wise virgins overcomer who comes out of all of it and obeys all of it and live separate under God just like their father Abraham amen so see Zacharias was an overcomer despite being part of the denominational system of that day because he didn't follow it right he didn't follow their Creed's he just did what the word said hey man he kept offering sacrifice right there right you know going in the Holy of Holies in the holy place I don't know if he went actually I don't think he went the holiest of Holies cuz he wasn't the high priest but he went in the holy place and he kept offering faithful sacrifice year after year and God honored him by giving him a child amen and not just a child a prophet Amen thank the Lord now the next thought program does is upon Lily a type of a Christian overcomer by saying as overcomer he says you are born defeated and that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated you're born in a defeated world amongst the feet of people amongst defeated Creed's amongst the feet of denominations you've got to come to victory some way says Amen but any man that we look around us sister Karen we look around us everyone's defeated I'm not talking bout in here we ought to be overcomers in here you ought to look around see some overcomers around you when we look around in our families you know we look around in our homes and you know friends and work and socially and everything's defeated you see everyone bowing to Satan right you see everyone bowing to the world but as I said the major sin of this day is worldliness they're bowing to be like the world we've got we've got to reject the invitation to be like the world and we've got to be like Christ we've got to be godly if we're gonna overcome we must be like Christ there's defeat all around us and so we've got to be the one some way we got to find a way to overcome despite all the defeat around us all the other the negativity all the whining and self-pity that we see around us we've got to find some way and thank God Jesus said I am the way amen oh yes he says like a lily it's one of the most prettiest flowers that there is I'm very fond of those great calla lilies and pond lily I think there's nothing hardly as pretty as a great big pond lily how its radiance that look radiant where does it come from it's a little seed down in the bottom of a muddy mucky pond and that little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in it is in it right then when it's down in that mud but it has to strive daily knowing that there is something he said when it starts it's black it's dirty it's mucky its slimy in that slime that's living in yet it presses its way through the mud the muck the waters and the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what's been hid in it all the time amen thank the Lord amen mine and if you don't know the joy of sticking your head above this world and the waters of this world I encourage you keep pressing keep pressing and the things of God keep overcoming and one day your little head will pop up above it and you'll be able to see that I'm above it and you'll really realize that you're in the light of Christ amen you'll finally see it clearly for not just through the waters through the muck but you will see the light of Jesus Christ and you'll be able to not guess you'll know you're walking in the light amen that's what the beauty of this message is and this the message that we believe that God gave to brother Branham we know we're walking light because every word in this Bible every doctor in this Bible we can say we don't have to put it off and say oh we don't believe that that's for the days of old we don't put it off like that but we apply it to our lives and we know we're walking obedience because the Bible taught it to us and we obey thus saith the Lord oh my thought I get a lot of shot than that praise God can somebody give me a loud a man out there you're walking in the Lord Amen you ought to have a sunburn you're in so much light Amen it ought to be burning upon you already enjoying it you ought to put your sunglasses on because it's so bright you're not in the muck you're the light Amen hallelujah thankful I'm in the light hallelujah everything slimy all the dirty things you used to think and do other mucky relationship you used to be in you're above that now you're living above that that's the things of the past I'm no longer of that life I've cross the line praise God I've gone above those things I'm living a higher life in Christ he said I think that's an overcomer once in sin once they're the things that was wrong don't worry about it now I'm gonna have to worry about anybody catching me smoking cigarettes anymore or catching me watching the wrong movies anymore like I used to I'm glad I don't the word see because these things are their way their way below me their way away those are things of the past praise God those are far far below me there they're part of my past but that's not where I'm living anymore praise God amen once I did things that was wrong now why look back into the pond again look up amen praise God I used to open my I go swimming under the pond all the time on the water I opened up my eyes so much I think it messed up my eyes I was wanting to see the dirt you know and see the bottom of the pie I think that messed up my eyes and brother said we got to be like that spiritually azipod Lily don't look back to the things of the world and want to look around under there you know what it is it's mucky it's dirty it's gonna get you filthy it's gonna be leading to death he said look up look up to heaven look up set your affection on things above a man set your heart and pleasures on heaven amen he said neither did you and your sin your adultery everything you lived in you didn't express nothing but there was a seed in there and it got a chance to press itself into light and now you're in the presence of Jesus Christ with the Sun of light I'm sorry with the sunlight he said it brought you out of what you really was in in the beginning you see what I mean you saw the light you bloomed out you laid your heart open and now you're a lily remember my sermon on the lily program said Reverend Lily sir program likens a lily to a preacher of course but it's all of us and yet does he said how he toils and yet he does not spin yet solomon all's glory is not arrayed like one of these he said look at him he takes nothing for himself a lily don't care nothing about himself now I had to look that up in his urn in the science and I'll share in just a minute he says what does he do he throws his beauty out his life that others might see his life is expressed out that others might see the glory what's in him that was in him in the mud now he's on top can I just make a statement here see you and I got to open up and we got to share our testimonies with others praise God we got to open up to people that may were uncomfortable opening we got to be just got to be more free to share things now of course we got to pray before we do it because we don't want to glorify Satan or you know tell things that someone might do damage against us or something like that but see as this what program's going to get to a little bit they've got to open themselves up and show glory of what was in them from the beginning and church the only glory anyone's gonna see in you and I is the love of Christ the mercy of Christ the power of Christ the character of Christ amen the word of Christ all these things that's the only beauty that we have is what God put in us while we were in the while we were yet sinners right he had at the end of testimony for us and program said that's the overcomer he overcome the things of the world he freely gives himself out everybody can look at him his life now look at this you can't put a finger on it see when he's at work you can't put a finger on him there he's found the Word of God like Daniel oh they said we're gonna change these laws so he can't pray but they couldn't put a finger on his life he wasn't anything evil so they had to change the laws to get him to do evil but it wasn't evil OHS good they couldn't put a finger at work oh you're not doing this this at work no they couldn't do that they couldn't go to the church to say you're not doing this at church they couldn't put a finger and say here see was he was so he was so much into the light they look at this you can't find any book can you find any blemish in this you can't put it because it's in the light it's fully manifesting the character of its seed life amen and see when we when we fully manifest Christ the Bible says they see that will people won't be able the Bible say that will be blamed on that same and that's the word I'm looking for Amen you're blameless the Bible said live blameless amongst all men that just came to me now I didn't have them my notes blameless oh you're blameless at work you're blameless at home you're blameless of the church you're blameless because the life of Christ is your expressing his life you're living his life he's a real overcomer you can't say nothing about him say he cause you can say is he come out of the mud amen but he's not in the mud now he's on top of it Amen you can't now back what he was what is he now he's on top church where are you at is the devil on top of you beating you down and getting you addicted to worldly things is the devil on top or are you on top as the overcomers we're on top praise God we're on top of worldliness on top of pride we overcome agar and bitterness and fear and lust we overcome all these things we've got to be on top remember the Bible said that God will bruise Satan shortly under your feet amen oh yeah and the mud is underneath the lily the lily is the overcomer he overcame all of that and he freely gives out his beauty he said then the bee comes by and says that's wonderful perfume I believe I'll go and get my part Stinger right a creature of stinging you ever got stung by anybody but you guys see people that although they're gonna hurt me again they're gonna so you got to be able to manifest Christ and I'll say like this you got to control the situation so you don't get stung like that little you got to so manifest that see if you got a temper of course they're gonna fight back at you you're gonna get stung you're all closed up but if you open up and show the glory of Christ that bees not going to come around this thing that bees gonna come to get some love from you that bees gonna come ask you for prayer amen not pick a fight with you and even if they do you can shine the light of the God and you can change their motive right taking them from a fighting spirit to a humble spirit so you just open up your heart he said I believe I'll go and get my part but see the thing we gotta do is make sure we're opened up how do you open up you gotta pray in the morning you got to read your Bible in the morning you got to walk in the spirit praise God you got to be open up for business that's what I feel like every time I go to the class two kids are like 22 little bees coming to take some of my strength they all got to come and get their hugs and I gotta come and get their attention look what I did today and looking they all want to show me impressed me with their learning every day I want to come get a portion of my of my virtue that's right and then I got my own seven children - the same thing - praise God see everybody's got to come and get a part aside this people ought to be attracted to you and I people oughta like being around you amen because you're Lily you have something to give them praise God you have some weight to bless them you have some weight to help them and we'll look at this in the natural just a moment he said the lily just opens up his heart and say come on now be alright everything takes from him the lily he's a real pastor now that's a real quote I'm not making that up I'm not packing myself on the back I'm just saying what he said I say that's what I need to be I need to be a real one of these he expresses the glory of God and look where he came from he had he had to overcome to do that that's my new thing I like hitting this you know thank the Lord gives me something to contact I mean maybe I didn't do that too much I donno he said one time he or she so he now he goes a lily can be a sister one time he or she was young and fair and beautiful they had a lot of temptations to go through a lot of muck to go through a lot of mud to go through but they overcame that see they overcame now they're expressing the real beauty of Christ in their life notice expressing through the mud see if you study a lily it's its roots go straight down and stays in the mud it's like all these you know all these lilies there there's all these are the lines of stems right see there's a part of us that's still in the muck part right we still got a sin part of us but we got to live above that praise God we're not expressing the mud works crossing the beauty of the seed of the character that's inside us but we're still connected to the muddy parts but we're not expressing that even you see any mud on that church can anybody put a finger on these lilies say there's mud here there's mud here no your your life's out of order here your life's is sinful here your life's disgraceful here can anybody put a finger on it no because it's manifesting the beauty of it's a seed praise God amen it's living above that it overcame that it used to be muddy right it used to not be able to express this but now it's an overcomer now he's expressing the beauty and now everybody can come and get something from them praise God so I look up in Britannica about water lilies let me I'll read this it's just a little paragraph here now look just real quick look at all their parts and you're gonna see how every single part of it is used to help somebody else right many species of water lilies are suited for pools aquatic gardens and aquariums where they are prized for their attractive foilage and showy flowers and I was in South America four times and they got lilies there's the most there's some of the biggest lilies I've ever seen their leaves are massive just massive and we went to a wedding there one time and they had all these lilies laying out you know it was one of the most beautiful things you could see and I thought that in a poor country like that they still had some of those beautiful decorations they'd have to hang all this white stuff like you know we do here in America try to make it all beauty they take the beauty of God's nature and it's just as beautiful if not more beautiful than our weddings we'll spend millions and hundreds of thousands of dollars to make it naturally beaut or artificially beautiful and these poor people will take the natural things of God it's probably more beautiful than our weddings that's right the submerge leaves the starchy horizontal creeping rhizomes so it has submerged leaves as well so leaves above and leaves below and the protein-rich seeds of the larger species has been used as food by humans throughout history so humans come get apart humans look over there say oh I'd like to use that seed oh we're gonna use that for some food or the humans will get under there in the water they'll pick the leaves out front of the under let's say oh we can use this for food sounds like some good cabbage or lettuce right there but it was wet but first the humans would say my I'll come get my part praise God so you don't humans come to you and try to get there apart from you right maybe men so humans come and the water lilies don't fuss don't take it from me I need it don't take it no they realize that's my purpose in life my purpose in life is to give to other people a lily doesn't exist for its own self all right now does it reproduce yes but it's not living for itself of course you can see it about any of God's creation right now the head I'm sorry I don't know how to say it peni petals petals leaf stalks serve as cover for fish and hold fast for their spawn okay so these these serve as cover for fish and then they're babies so see every part helps life the life of humans the life of fish church because they like this our love should be able to cover people as well our prayers should cover the sins of others he's got like member Stephen he said Lord lay it not to their charge what was he doing he was covering Paul amen because Paul was standing right there holding Coates but there is Stephen as a lily he's he put out his pet tiles whenever you come and he said cover Paul and Jesus heard it and jesus answered and said I'm gonna use him and make him a chosen vessel because the Stephens Prairie man he wasn't living for supper they meant he was living for Pauly man I don't know yeah covered him hallelujah and your prayers will cover the lives of others how many believe that like I told you Steve Alexander now he left but in the 1990s he prayed for God to raise up a church here to cover the sins of his family and that beautiful to cover and my mom told me that she said no one else prayed for you Jesse no one else prayed she said grandpa just preached at us and everything like that she said I was the only one that prayed for you and your siblings and God heard those prayers say your prayers are so powerful they cover and the Bible says he that converts a sinner from the error of his way covers a multitude of sins amen glory so they help humans they feed humans and they help the fish life they protect it they cover it and they help it reproduce and grow and multiply and then who catches the fish humans right he says the huffed wildlife so Huff's right any animal with the hoof the hoof wildlife also browse and eat on the plant parts that are above water so these two I'm not sure about the pedals but these any of the parts that are above water the hoofed animals they come get their part so far we got bees we got humans we got fish now we got hoofed animals everybody's coming to get a part of these beautiful lilies and you see them one by one they slowly start fading away hallelujah right but the RAM said and I said this wrong last week Legrand said you have four likes to your humanity not three I said three last week but mater said when you're born you have four lights the first one goes out at 25 then 50 then 75 then 100 or 120 however you live that lap that last light shines a little longer it can not that it will but see if you look at these lilies when they first come up beautiful but with each passing day in their season of life amen something is using it something is taking from it and it only exists to minister to other people and each one comes by the little guy that little person that always comes up and buzzes in your ear a little person who always send you the text you know every sends you boys cause you at this time of the week every week a little a little thing that keeps happening all the time but then the big things that happen in your life those big huff to family members that stomp into your life everybody stand yours are coming back to you today right because some of them don't believe right and so someone is going to manifest the light of Christ amen either you're gonna be defeated or you're gonna be the overcomer amen but this world is were surrounded by defeated people saying they're Christians when they're not but we should be the overcomers and be ready to give love or concern or money or prayers or time or the curves man or a hug or prayer whatever's needed we should be able to do it and slowly as time goes on we just fade fade fade still expressing the glory of God almost done with this Lily the emergent leaves are the leaves on top also provide cover for the aquatic birds I'm not sure which one it is I'm thinking like this maybe small birds can kind of hide in here but not only for things under but they cover on top too the bird comes by I think I'll hide here for a little bit can I hide under your prayers for a little bit brother Jessie can I just hide here I have we had that we have people hide in our church for a little while and I thank God for it right I thank God they just want to hide here but hey man be protective for a little while just hide me under the the beauty of Christ's word then when they're done alright thank you thank you see you later praise the Lord there they go but what do we have to do we have to serve God's purpose be a shelter to somebody praise God be a friend be the encouragement praise God that's what you're there for every part of you has a purpose for it for you to give out for the benefit of others if you've got eternal life eternal life is living bar so the birds even fly down saying I can find little I'm flying this world of toil and snares if I falter who cares well there's a Lily who cares for me hey man thank the Lord I'll find little protection for a while before I go my way you know I was in Coeur this week I was reading in this book about prayer and fasting I'm about halfway done beautiful book powerful book um was it gonna now lost my thought there yeah I lost my thought sorry so sorry the emergent leaves provide cover for aquatic birds and the seeds of many species are food for fish and fowl so just like a human will come get the big seeds there's little seeds left over then fish will get the ones underneath I don't know how they do it but then birds will come get the seeds as well well while I'm here I'll just feed on the word of God the seed while I'm here so jesus said those seed is the word amen thank the Lord here's what I like brother sister the science says because they grow rapidly they can clog the lakes several members of theirs family provided essential link in plant succession from pond to swamp to wet Prairie so without these water lilies some of the plants would die off because it attracts glory it attracts all these people that want a part of their beauty and because of that because of their humble existence they just stay in one spot they just stay in the same church they stay in the same home right they're not divorced and remarry and divorce free man they stay in the same place they stay in their position where God plays them and because of them life can go on you know and you've heard it before but it's scriptural you remember from Genesis 19 or Genesis 18 rather the only reason this world can go on is because of Holy Ghost field Christians they are the salt of the earth God says I'll destroy it unless there's 10 but what happened he ever your life preserves sinners lives but it's not to pat you on the back and say thank God that greater is He that's in me than he that's in the world amen but because of the beauty of Lily's life can grow and succeed in generations can go keep going on and moving on by the grace of God I like that grow rapidly praise God someone comes to the message and really received it brother Jose what happens you see him grow real fast amen God is the god of a short quick work Amen Alleluia look at Paul he was killing Christians he was going to put Christians in jail within a matter of three days he had the Holy Ghost amen Bob said his scales on his eyes three days and and I said to be praised and repent go be baptizing me filled with the Holy Ghost three days later he went from being in the muck hallelujah being dirty being slimy being filthy being a murderer he went from the mud and muck up to the top walking the light within three days God does a short quick work may God do a work in our lives may we not remain in slimy things maybe not think look back to dirty things Oh may we look to the heavens amen may we look to eternity amen and be a lily that others might benefit from our lives praise God hallelujah every part of our lives then we learn from the lily should be service to others that's why I do Bible Club does it wear me out yeah it also wears me out written to you three times a week - I love it though don't get me wrong I love it but I'm saying it's like I'm gonna be worn out either way when I wasn't doing Bible club I was still worn out fall asleep when I got home I mean we're not either way but I want to make sure my life is live for others and that includes my family and children that's why I take him and I try to spoil him and take him out to eat and get him nice things you know I try to spoil him cuz I don't know they're only with me for a little bit Lydia's already almost 15 my goodness Kirsten met me my wife met me when she was 15 so can you imagine Lydia meeting her husband next year oh don't talk about the Burgman don't say anything about that I'm gonna set the Deacon right there by the door all right all right thank you of conversations with myself see every part of our lives people should be able to benefit from every part of our life they can find shelter in you I've been telling you that somebody asked me to mentor them so I talked to them yesterday I'm trying to talk to them regularly and I've been finding that like they just they don't have any friends which is a lot like some of us you know we don't have a lot of like you are you are all my closest friend I talk to you more than I talked to even my own brothers we don't have many friends but if we want more friends than we got to reach out to them but that's what this you know this person was telling me as a mentor they said I feel all alone and so thank you he said thanks for texting me and reaching out to me he said because I don't have any other friends the church that's what my life is supposed to be right that's what yours are supposed to be you're supposed to be a shelter you're supposed to be a cover for somebody you're supposed to be a refreshing to somebody that they know they can buzz over they can buzz over into your life and they can get a blessing they can say like this they can buzz in your ear you know usually we're like I'm not gonna answer that I'm not gonna that's different if you can't well see we we gotta let people buzz into our lives and give them a part of us that they need now not compromise that's where we got to be careful not say it's okay to say that's what I try to tell this person I'm entering I don't agree with their sin I try to point them here's I try to say here's what I did when I was in that situation and here's how God taught me or I talk to brother Brooks about this right I call bears you're browning about this that's why told me yesterday I said you might want to call them just to be a mentor because I don't have all the knowledge that Lily doesn't have everything but it has something you don't have everything but you've got something they want amen what see Bertrand Labor's on this over and over it's the overcomer first we got to overcome all the muck and dirtiness and everything and we got to shoot up real strong and fast see that's the word quickened amen this quickly grows it's quick it in the hey man it's made alive amen see we gotta make sure our lives are growing to the word and then once we're born again on top of the water we got to stretch you out and keep growing in the grace of God what if this guy didn't grow and put forth these leaves the fish would die the birds wouldn't come see him and aren't leaves the type of fellowship that's what I told that friend I might the mentor I said listen I said it and I'll say it's all the church here if you need fellowship with me let me know once a month we can meet at my house over to my house you just tell me what you need I'm here to give myself to you praise God and you should be here to give yourself for everybody else we should all be living for each other we can't do this alone the lily can't do it alone right it neat and it needs it to people to take the animals take the seeds and spread it right right just like all the flowers they need to that nectar to take it they need to be to help pollinate them right that's I told the person yesterday they said oh I always feel like uh you're the one giving me advice about that I said listen the Bible said iron sharpens iron and I said even when I'm reflecting about how to help you it causes me to examine myself to make sure I'm just as zealous for Christ now as I was then because it doesn't do anything to blabber doesn't help me to blabber off things and look what I look how prideful I am look how there's none of us good but if we can give a word and new season how pleasant is that word amen hallelujah the bob says like snow to the marathon runner I forget what it was gone on a hot day when he's running all these 26.2 miles bangs a marathon runner right bang he ran one it's more than one more than I've ever run but the bottle said it's like snow to the messenger hey after the long race Amen refreshing a church that's what our words can be let's refresh others now you got to correct children yes you got to correct sometimes adults but we but if we do it right it will refresh them because if you're not Korean with the Lord even with your own walk with the Lord if God's not correcting you something's wrong because the Lord Chasen's every Sun or else he's a bastard child a church that's not having struggles is not a true church right okay give me about yeah all right I'm maybe half an hour we'll see I want to I want to try to finish today so now bo-ram changes the thought now he doesn't mention lilies over and over again you know of course as the sermon goes on brother Ram now goes into the thought of how Jesus overcame and he said Jesus gave us the example how to do it now we want to know how he overcame he told us how to do it see what's the one word brother Ram said how I overcame humility that's what he emphasizes he gird himself took a towel wash his disciples feet and wiped them the very God of heaven humiliated himself he said but we don't want to be humiliated that's the reason women don't wear their hair they don't let their hair grow out the reason they don't want to dress like lady should dress men don't men don't want to do that see it's the same thing they get humiliated but he said Jesus constantly look who he was he said I'm gonna say something greatness humiliates itself he says greatness humbles itself greatness now of course that means you don't like embarrass yourself to be silly but you obey the Word of God and you put others needs above yours that's humility it's putting the needs of others above your own LeBron talks about how he met people rich guys he said but I've met they weren't he said they thought they were great men but they weren't he said I stood by people he said that were great men with ragged sleeves on and cuffs my shirts fairly new I think it's one year old program said the great men he met had raggedy clothes on he said they they make you think you're the great person see because and church it's not a put-on I've had people do that toast this money about this one time so a preacher came up and said oh you're you're a better preacher than I after I preached and I could sense my spirit it was not a compliment it was false humility but see when it's real genuine perhaps is like this perhaps God showed you know you sinned and then God you know it shows you how humble you are how much you need him and then you're just coming out of this right you're coming out of this period of being guilty and but then feeling forgiven but you realize how weak you are and then God will send somebody to you and you'll just see like like you're just you see good in them and you're just you're complimenting them because you just realize that you fell and that you need God's grace to and you are making them feel like the great person but you're not doing it for any selfish gain it's because you're so encouraged that they're in a stage of overcoming amen that's where that quote really is the reality of it when you're making people greater than yourself it's done in all sincerity because you realize ma I've been struggling I think the Lord for forgiving me but thank the Lord God is really helping this person right now and you're making them feel like they're better than you that's at least how I see in my life church praise God so when someone you make someone the great person and that church God helps me that I need to do this all the time people start talking about me or my book or YouTube and by God's grace God knows this I always try to like change it back to them I don't want the I'll just say a few things but I always want to try to turn it back to them I don't want it to be all about me because I know that's selfish they're not gonna really maybe they'll benefit a little bit if they're encouraged by God blessing or the ministry or something like that I always try to make sure it's not about me how are you doing or what are you going through right now or what do you reading your Bible right now it's message you're listening to lately you know turn the focus back on them which is a way to get them to feel like they're a good person right or that they're pleasing God but I don't think it's something to say well you're them I think it's wrong to say well you're the best sister I know I think that's wrong because now everybody else feels bad or you're the best preacher I know that's not a I know people say that that's not the night that's not the thing to say see that makes everybody else feel bad it's just encouraging them and just noticing God's grace in their life see so we got to make sure it's not a false exalting of someone else but it's actually in all sincerity you thank God you see growth in people's lives praise God now he's not talking about humility genuine humility not something that's a put-on he says something that's real human at Milty Jesus told us how to do it overcome means to stand the test like all the old Saints did like Jesus I miss all of his enemies he stood the test everything he was tested against he stood it in the very face of sickness him me and the Messiah he healed them in the face of death he brought it back to life in the face of Calvary his own death he defeated by surrendering himself why by the word he said you destroy this temple in three days I'll raise it up the word said so and the prends of death he defeated it amen he overcame death in the presence of hell he defeated Hell and overcame hell hey see there was defeat all around him but he overcame all of it amen why by oh by the word all by humility there's the real man how many wanna be a real man or will real woman you overcome by the word there's the one to make your example he defeated everything overcoming temptation was for him you know that the Bible said he was tempted in all points like as we are yet without sin he was tempted by drinking can you imagine that Jesus there were times wanted to go have a drink now we know he drink a little bit of wine the Bible said so John had none Jesus had a little but there was times where they men Jesus wouldn't have a lot more of that in his flesh he was tempted by it Satan said why don't you take a little more and just relax it's been a real stressful time these Pharisees have got under your nerves yeah you should take an extra big drink to kind of left the pressure shame on that right shame on that devil for trying to tempt our Lord like that but Jesus was tempted by it he said he was tempted by women right he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are he was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him you couldn't find any mud on his life amen I know about his spiritual life now you can find mud all over and right that's what they didn't wash his feet remember that in Simon's house they didn't wash the mud off his feet so yeah that he had natural mud but not spiritual mud oh thank god help us to be like that praise God he said but you got to overcome means to recognize the devil at every one of his tricks he said you must say he said you must recognize he's a real devil levan says don't say there's no devil he said you must recognize there's a devil and he's trying to kill you he is trying to kill you he seeks the easy though trying to kill you steal or steal kill or destroy yeah destroy one of those three he's trying to do one of them to you he said you must nice him and no these a devil he's against you then overcome you must recognize that the God in you is greater and mightier than he is the one that's in you has already overcome him and by His grace you are more than a match for him that's real overcoming when you recognize praise God now here's a quote I don't know if you heard this bill Bram says if the devil gives you a sickness you can't say I don't believe it's a sickness now look at this I'm just trying to balance this out he's every other quote we've read or heard is that if you're sick deny it but Bram just got done saying you can't deny and say there's no devil there's no devil there's no devil trying to you can't deny it you're fooling yourself and he says this you can't say I don't believe it's a sickness oh yes it is a sickness you got cancer you you don't believe it's a cancer it is a cancer it is a cancer so see there's part of you as a human you have to recognize there is a devil trying to destroy me he has given me this sickness he said but you must quote greater is He that's in you than he that's in the world you must realize that the Holy Spirit that's in you has already overcome this thing amen and he's in you and you can overcome by him that's exactly sensible exactly the way the scriptures written praise God so see there's a balance to it now does the possession of cancer does that belong to you no that's Satan's possession right who started sickness the devil right so the first perverted cell and then without the sphere that went into it was a devil so yes you're not you're not taking the backs of rattlesnakes but you're recognize you recognize the enemy has brought this upon me it is not mine to keep Christ is gonna deliver me from it praise God I know that's simple but I just want to bring out that quote so you know you can't just act like wow I'm not sick I'm not sick you have to realize I'm sick but I'm gonna be well praise God thank the Lord he said he that's in he was greater than he is in the world now if you look back and you're condemned then you're still in the world but if you're living above that then he that's in you has led you above that darkness see if you got a sickness and you're living in sin he said well then you're not up on top of the water you got to get up on top of the water first right like the lily he's above the darkness of the mud he's in the light reflecting the beauty that was put him both in him before he left the mud amen hallelujah it's press its way through it overcome the shell it overcome the mud it overcome the waters and overcome everything and was an overcomer reflected the beauty and glory of God he said that's the way every believer does that's the way Noah did lot did what a mess he was in look that's the way Moses did that's the way Joshua did the way Daniel did Shadrach Meshach that's the way John the Baptist Zacharias Elizabeth that's the way Simeon that's the way Ana every one of them did they overcome the mud that was there around them and packed into them they stuck their head above the thing and shine forth the glory of God that's what a real Christian does oh not as glorious amen see we got to stick our hand above the things of the world we got to get our eyes off the things of the world right and look up and look above if we can just keep using that illustration of turning our eyes upon Jesus and looking full and this wonderful face now look at the problem not look at the mud not look at the slime not look at that but look at the one who gave us the power and the beauty within us to overcome the mud muck and slime that's what a real Christian does hallelujah let me go further now Jesus herbal man breaks into Jesus three temptations in Matthew chapter four he said he was tempted above any man that could ever be tempted in the temptation of Jesus Christ how do you overcome he said it is written he said he overcame by the word and Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you're back to word again the word of promise what is the word of promise to every Christian greater is He that's in you then he that's in the world then how do I overcome not me but the word that's in me the word is God then I overcome the things of the world because it's the word in me if you abide in me my words and you then ask what you will just keep pressing up you're coming to the top it sure is anything you got to come to the top Ami's I like this we've got to come higher brother Ram said like I said last week we've got to come out of babyhood we've got to come into manhood if we're gonna have faith for a body change we got to come into babyhood and we got to come higher than that into manhood praise God we got to rise up above just our everyday battles and we got to keep staying in the Word of God until the season comes when we can rise high above that and we can reach our destiny which is the rapture praise God that's the reason it is our destiny because we've heard it right that's the reason we heard it because it's our destiny praise God other churches don't care about they don't want to preach on it they're scared about it but why we heard it because God's calling us to in amen we got to keep pressing up you've got to come to the top of it you've got to come to the rapture you've got to come to the marriage supper of the Lamb you got to come to the money you got to keep coming up so you can possess those promises just keep his words in you if my words abide in you and you abide in my word ask what you will it'll be granted to you see buh-bam said it was three major assaults upon Jesus in the wilderness it's always in them three don't forget it those three major assaults from the highest to the lowest Satan had three major attacks but he met it with the word every attack he could make it with the word praise God now you know the lust of the eyes Satan showed him the kinas the world said fall down and worship Me and Jesus didn't fall down he stood up and said I'll only worship God amen thou shalt worship none but God hallelujah so you know we guess what we got to do we can't bow down in worship things right we can't submit ourselves to doing the wrong thing we can't submit ourselves to loving the present world we can't borrow those things we got to stand and obey and stay with the word and quote the word let the word abide in you that you can stand against bowing down to the things of the world all right you see it all the time people give in to the pressures of the world and they bow down to their job they bow down to their family and they don't obey the simple Word of God right you can't read your Bible you can't pay your ties you can't come to church see they bow down simplest and simple things if you can't submit in these simple things what about the big things a mahendra how are we gonna be ready for a rapture if we can't stand up against the little things oh it's so crucial Church it's so crucial to stand on the Word of God and obey every word hallelujah come to the top Church we got to come to the top amen see lust of the flesh Satan said turn the stones into bread you're hungry and you'd be hungry after 4 hours not 40 days you'll be hung out for 40 minutes right he's hungry after 40 days it's a great temptation use your gift for yourself help yourself this time and Jesus said no I live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God Satan's not gonna try to trick me to do americo I'll wait till God tells me to do a miracle I'll wait till God tells me to eat I'll wait till God tells me to stop the fast my god help us all I'll wait till God tells me to do something to help my flesh or my body I'll wait till God tells me until then I'm keeping the word and the pride of life cast yourself for up on this pinnacle cast yourself down the Angels will bear you up go ahead put your life on the line let's see if see if God Allah answer for you put yourself in a hard situation and Jesus said I will not put myself in a temptation he said thou shalt not tempt the LORD thy God see like I knew a friend one time this is true story maybe I've said it before good friend but he said lordy and this man want to commit adultery on his wife and he prayed a prayer he said Lord if it's okay for me to commit adultery he said let me speak in tongues and then he said he spoke in tongues so he went commit adultery on his wife right in the message we see that's the same thing that happened right here cast yourself down that would've been a sin right commit suicide and your life and see what is it it's tempting the Lord I don't know where that tongue came from I'm not sure we see God will never lead a man back into the mud God will only lead him out of the mud amen Sonlight brother Jose does not make the lilies go down into the mud sunlight makes him rise amen out of sin out of unbelief the Sun brings you honor it raises you up he raises me up out of the past muck and dirty and and filthy slimy things like that he raises you up so I don't know where the tape son came from but I know the prayer was a temptation of the pride of life God give me a supernatural thing so I can go sin nope that's the temptation of the enemy and it's brought nothing but destruction to his family in church nothing but destruction see people make this big syke making a deal with the devil almost my goodness so I could have the lust of the flesh as people have heard our message see so it's about you and I letting the word abide in us see the word should have been abiding in that individual and say thou shalt not commit adultery amen right quoting the Ten Commandments seat but it was it and so this that's how you and I overcome we receive the word and we stand with the word and we resist Satan hey Satan get behind me I'm married to my wife I'm married to my husband only I will not commit adultery I'm staying with the word amen but like I said before some people try to quote the word then you give in to the temptation well that's not that's not abiding in the word and I'm gonna close with this thought it doesn't matter what you say it matters what you say by revelation let me close with this thought because brother man brings up Matthew 7:21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven so it's not just quoting the word Jesus just didn't quote the word he obeyed the word he did the will of God after quoting the word because all these Judas workers of iniquity they all can say lord lord i love you lord i love you i love Americans I love the anointing I love the atmosphere they all love that but they also love iniquity and they don't do God's will but then church the Bible says you might write this down in first Corinthians 12:3 wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaketh by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is lord but by the holy ghost did you catch that Matthew 7 they're saying Lord Lord but then Paul says you can only say Jesus is Lord by the Holy Ghost lurid so it's one of two things either those workers of iniquity had the temper anointing and they called him Lord but then they went out and sinned and lost that anointing or they never said Lord with the revelation that he was their root he was their ruler praise God you only don't hear it I mean they were just calling Lord Lord out of the coz they appreciate his miracles but they weren't calling him Lord because they had a revelation that they had obeyed him and then the blood of Jesus Christ had washed away all their iniquity amen because remember Church the seal of God the boss of the seal of God is that a Christian departs from iniquity glory that's the seal of God the seal of God is that a Christian will not remain in addictive sins over a long period of time very mad that's the seal of a Christian a certain minister toll brother branham said mr. Brannon look here Jesus said whosoever believeth that Jesus Christ son of God is born a Spirit of God I said but don't the Bible also say that no man can call Jesus Christ only by the Holy Ghost see you can't make the Bible lie it's got the hook ID so see doesn't matter what people say I believe the message I believe programs a prophet I leave Jesus Christ son of God I believe it's the end times doesn't matter what you say it matters if you're saying it from Revelation with the word abiding in you or if you just saying it for temporary blessings where is it speaking from is it speaking from the soul that I jesus is my lord and if it's speaking from your soul your soul is your will your nature your desires and if you're saying it from your soul then your desires are nothing but his desires hey man and then every area of your life is to do God's will to be a blessing to every person in every area of your life see this preachers trying to say see that's what you see all the UH let me say this I saw this morning huh do you know one of Billy Graham's daughters was married four times you know that I saw an article this morning on it and now she's writing a book which is okay Oh heshes really repented I've been married four times and realized after the fourth divorce that maybe she wasn't really in love with Christ because she really think God she realized it I don't know where I don't know where she stands now but even though her dad was a good man of God thank God for his ministry she realized my life is still in the mud and muck of the filth of this world amen imagine that for weddings not manifesting the light of Christ yet hearing all the time oddly she said I believe Jesus was my Savior he who calls upon the name of Lord shall be saved we Romans 10 right we all know that Scripture whoever calls on the name of Lord but the Bible also says you can only call him your Lord by the Holy Ghost so see it comes down to how did Jesus overcome Saint he wasn't saying it is written by his flesh he was saying it is written by the by the anointing by the revelation in his heart and then he was ready for the Amen to stand behind it and obey it that's how we know we're overcomers when we speak the word to temptation and we're ready to obey it and we're not going to give in let's stand to our feet search I hope that balances out gee that really helped me as I was listening this sermon I thought well let me find that scripture well Graham said if you are a part of God if you're a child of God in the Word of God how can you deny the word how can the Holy Spirit make you believe a Creed that you have to do something like this when the Bible said something else he the Bible plainly tells you what to do then when you see that you jump right into it you're right with it then just keep moving right on up and it just grows thick it it just grows see words matter yes words matter buts the words that are spoken by revelation of an overcomer you have to say it by the Holy Ghost see a lot of people say it by fear right or by pressure well I know my parents I know my friends are pressuring me to say Jesus is good to praise God thank you Jesus they say by pressure or fear I don't want to go to hell I love God alone but they got to say it by revelation in obedience in humility do a sin there I could do a sin there right that's the Saints the same thing just jump off the cliff God Oh for go ahead and do it you know God's gonna forgive you at the end the church said go ahead you know God's richer mercy he'll he'll forgive you well of course he will but you're not supposed to jump off the pinnacle you're supposed to wait till he says jump and he won't ever tell you to jump in this end it's if you get accidentally knocked off the pinnacle there it is ha there it is if you accidentally get tricked into sinning then God will bear you up but not if you purposely jump off the pinnacle purposely trying to jump into sin praise God let's bow our heads here I might have one more message on that I wanted to show you how the RAM ends it so we saw humility we saw service today how many appreciate the Word of God today praise the Lord and then brother Graham gives some specific examples of people at the end of the sermon about what they could pray for things they need to overcome in their lives but the additions if you just play a soft song here what a beautiful thing a Christian life is how many could say amen to that that picture is just not I've seen bigger one than that yeah they're so big and beautiful I just remember this morning water lilies so much benefit their life is just a benefit to others constantly blessing other people every part of their life is a blessing the finances their worship at church you know the prayer
