[29:23] worthy so this is part 5 of the series
[29:26] on the starter surging praises Lord
[29:28] revelation 3 verse 4 I didn't finish all
[29:31] the Scriptures remember I showed you all
[29:32] the scriptures at the end I want to make
[29:34] sure I cover those it is kind of the
[29:47] worthy one calls us worthy hallelujah
[29:50] what a tremendous privilege and honor
[29:52] amen
[29:54] that's going to be a revelation 3 verse
[29:57] 4 we're so happy to be in the house and
[30:01] Lord as you're turning there we had a
[30:03] good Bible Club at the Middle School on
[30:05] Tuesday morning we met at 7:15 and 10
[30:08] kids came at 7:15 in the morning and I
[30:12] was really thankful to parents email me
[30:14] afterwards said the kids were so happy
[30:15] we're having Bible club at middle school
[30:18] and I'm just found the vision of one of
[30:20] the parents the parents said I want to
[30:21] see my child go through Arrowhead middle
[30:24] school and high school and have a
[30:25] ministry there the whole time so I'm
[30:27] just kind of found in that vision so we
[30:30] can train up disciples in the word of
[30:31] the Lord so we're very happy about that
[30:33] and then I met a teacher afterwards and
[30:35] she's like this place is evil she said
[30:37] we need a Bible club here and you know
[30:39] because demons start showing themselves
[30:40] more aggressively when do people get
[30:43] older so she said keep doing Bible club
[30:46] she said I'll come and pray sometimes
[30:47] I'm gonna hold her to that I'm gonna
[30:48] invite her to come and pray with us at 7
[30:50] and 15 in the morning because that's
[30:53] what we should do
[30:54] but I was just so happy and so next week
[30:57] one of the guys got so excited he's like
[30:58] let's go through the halls before school
[31:00] like Joshua
[31:02] let's sing until the walls of these
[31:04] spiritual powers fall down so I thought
[31:06] well we'll pray about that that sounds
[31:07] pretty good one time my mom walked
[31:10] around a bar praying for years until
[31:13] they closed it and that was a wonderful
[31:15] testimony for my mother just like Joshua
[31:18] now we don't have to do natural we can
[31:19] do spiritual but there's something about
[31:21] going through the motion that might stir
[31:23] up faith and anything if a handkerchief
[31:26] was your faith God said that's okay
[31:27] because the handkerchief has no virtue
[31:29] it represents something and that's a
[31:33] walking around a building remember lima
[31:34] when we did I don't just think my wife
[31:38] might remember we used to Jericho
[31:39] marches around at the sanctuary I don't
[31:41] know if anybody ever did that before but
[31:43] there's really nothing to that but it's
[31:46] something that will raise our faith or
[31:47] something to remind us that God is with
[31:50] his people so just you keep praying for
[31:52] me by God's grace if you can for God to
[31:56] give me strength
[31:56] so revelation three verse four
[32:01] revelation three verse four we want to
[32:03] start there I want to look more of this
[32:05] thought of how we're worthy I want to go
[32:08] through all the requirements like I said
[32:09] I searched the whole New Testament for
[32:10] what makes a Christian worthy and what
[32:12] makes them unworthy and I want to show
[32:14] it to you in the scripture tonight by
[32:15] the grace of the Lord all right
[32:18] revelation three verse four let's read
[32:20] it together
[32:20] on three one two three thou hast a few
[32:23] names even in sardis which have not
[32:26] defiled their garments and they shall
[32:28] walk with me in white for they are
[32:31] worthy
[32:32] red-letter words Christ says they're
[32:35] some that are worthy
[32:36] that's beautiful let's bow our heads
[32:38] every need on your heart just make it
[32:39] known unto God as we pray have any
[32:41] father my head is bowel or but my heart
[32:43] is burning right now with love for you
[32:46] Lord to see red-letter words Lord and to
[32:50] hear Lord this as we read it that you
[32:52] actually call believers in Sardis worthy
[32:57] nor we know it was a dark age we know if
[32:59] there ever was zeal for denomination it
[33:01] was in the Sardis church age a father if
[33:05] you found a few worthy
[33:07] in sardis I believe you'll find a few
[33:09] worthy and Leona C and Lord lor we know
[33:12] it because you said there are some that
[33:14] are hot and there because they're hot
[33:16] for Christ they will sit on the throne
[33:18] with you Lord Jesus
[33:20] help us tonight Lord to examine our
[33:22] hearts and lives help us examine our
[33:24] motives and objectives and reveal Lord
[33:26] more of these scriptures to us so they
[33:27] can be a living reality about living
[33:29] worthy of the gospel Lord God we thank
[33:33] you Lord for tonight bless every heart
[33:34] and soul that press their way out to the
[33:36] house of God tonight
[33:37] Lorna's we're gonna read this scripture
[33:39] that those that are planted in the house
[33:42] of our God shall flourish in the courts
[33:44] of our Lord so father we give you glory
[33:47] tonight let the Holy Spirit have his
[33:49] free course help us not to hinder your
[33:51] move Lord in any way shape or form in
[33:53] Jesus Christ name the church said Amen
[33:56] god bless use me and see the praise the
[33:58] Lord so let's look at this thought here
[34:06] part 5 we want to look at they are
[34:08] worthy I just want to focus in again a
[34:10] little closer on that thought I think
[34:13] it'd be a blessing I didn't get to
[34:14] finish it I like to finish it praise the
[34:16] Lord and like to get through these
[34:18] quotations here the scriptures
[34:20] especially by the grace of God I'm not
[34:23] mistaken we only went over a few and the
[34:27] most important ones if you remember were
[34:30] the ones that we looked at where Jesus
[34:31] talked about to be a worthy disciple he
[34:35] said you must forsake your family right
[34:38] must forsake your family to be worthy
[34:40] one thing else I can't remember that
[34:42] right now I have to go back there let's
[34:43] go to Matthew chapter 10 I can remember
[34:44] that second one forsake your families
[34:46] anybody remember the other one take your
[34:49] family I can't remember who sort of so
[34:50] let's go Matt back to Matthew 10 forgive
[34:52] me I was thinking about it the whole way
[34:54] here and I forgot it let's go to Matthew
[34:56] 10 pardon me it was fate forsake your
[34:59] family and one more thing Matthew
[35:02] chapter 10 he gave us two indicators
[35:04] there
[35:11] oh yes the cross yes taking up your
[35:15] cross taking up your bird and that's it
[35:17] forgive me that's what I forgot let's
[35:19] read that though by the grace of the
[35:21] Lord amen praise oh let's read I'll
[35:23] reverse 37 he that loveth father or
[35:25] mother more than me is not worthy of me
[35:28] and he that loveth son or daughter more
[35:32] than me is not worthy of me
[35:34] right and verse 38 that's why I want to
[35:37] get to and he that taketh not his cross
[35:39] and follow after me is not worthy of me
[35:42] either so there's a two-fold requirement
[35:45] of God at least of Jesus in this case
[35:47] that he had his 12 preachers right his
[35:49] 12 disciples this is what the 12
[35:51] disciples preached here and he told him
[35:53] this he said that you must love me more
[35:56] than everyone in your family even your
[35:57] children and then he said the second
[36:00] thing was he said you must take up a
[36:02] cross and every day follow the Lord
[36:04] Jesus Christ that is a life that's where
[36:07] the gospel praise the Lord so Malachi I
[36:09] want you switch over here I think I'm
[36:10] ready now for the I got some more slides
[36:12] here by the grace of the Lord I just
[36:16] want to review that so I didn't forget
[36:17] that by the grace of God okay so this is
[36:20] part 5 here seem like this but I think
[36:24] we have the fear series in there and I'm
[36:26] still not done with that there are some
[36:27] more thoughts I want to look at fear but
[36:29] seemed like I was longer or further
[36:31] ahead in this series but maybe not
[36:33] Sunday we finished judgment we didn't
[36:35] finish eulogy so we're gonna just
[36:37] continue a little more on the eulogy and
[36:39] next time I'm back with you Lord willing
[36:40] I'll see you Wednesday next Wednesday
[36:41] we'll look at the promise deal over over
[36:43] comers which is the longest portion in
[36:46] the church age book it's 20 pages on the
[36:48] book of life how many remember that
[36:49] let's read the church age book the
[36:51] doctrine that gets the most number of
[36:53] pages is the book of life because he
[36:55] said you can't do a casual study on the
[36:57] book of life and actually understand
[37:00] that you have to do a deep study on the
[37:02] book of life so that's important or
[37:04] willing we'll look at that again next
[37:06] Wednesday if God's willing and nothing
[37:08] else comes to my heart I have a thought
[37:10] I want to preach but I haven't had time
[37:11] to get into it it's the thought of
[37:13] showing how men and women could be
[37:17] adopted in the Old Testament I wanted to
[37:19] show that thought but I think I'm gonna
[37:21] preach that this weekend I think I'll
[37:22] have time I think brother Brooks will
[37:23] preach Friday so I have all
[37:25] right off to preach or to study
[37:26] hopefully and then I'll preach Saturday
[37:28] so hopefully I have all day Friday the
[37:30] study and prepare that message but in
[37:32] that wouldn't that be so helpful for our
[37:33] sisters and also for our brothers who
[37:35] don't preach you know sometimes we look
[37:37] at men who preach that they can actually
[37:39] know their adopted you know like Jesus
[37:42] and brother branham how we can see we
[37:44] can clearly see how they were adopted
[37:46] you know hear ye him like brother Rams
[37:48] given the sword and weakens can't we
[37:50] clearly see okay we're supposed to
[37:51] listen this man he has the sword of the
[37:53] Lord kid can you guys see can everybody
[37:54] see that by the grace of God we can see
[37:56] how God's saying here this man but now
[37:58] it's a little different for sisters
[38:00] because they don't preach but God still
[38:02] wants the life of the sister to be heard
[38:05] and she can still always testify a woman
[38:08] can testify as much as she's able to hey
[38:11] men just like a man can testify as much
[38:13] as he's able to but I got this thought
[38:15] to go through the Old Testament and find
[38:18] women that were adopted or in other
[38:20] words stayed in their position and we're
[38:23] mature believers that God could speak to
[38:26] for example I got some good examples for
[38:27] you I'm gonna give you a little
[38:28] foretaste the hall-of-fame of faith in
[38:33] Hebrews 11 lists a couple women you
[38:34] remember some of the women Sarah she's
[38:38] known of all these men they're listed
[38:39] there Sarah placed in there after that
[38:43] there's another one remember another one
[38:44] Rahab there's two women specifically
[38:48] called out as being by faith or through
[38:51] faith she did this and so God clearly
[38:54] gives us examples of godly women who
[38:57] although not preachers not in the church
[38:59] leadership they lead by example praise
[39:02] God I love you cuz everybody everybody's
[39:05] a leader somehow somebody's gonna follow
[39:06] you by Branson everybody follows or
[39:08] knows what you do by what you say by how
[39:11] you live your life and so I want to go
[39:13] through the Old Testament show how jakka
[39:15] bed mine the Bible said she wasn't
[39:16] afraid of the Pharaohs command
[39:19] can you imagine Pharaoh he imagined the
[39:22] president Trump send you letters say all
[39:23] the babies to dunder gonna die and this
[39:27] is there something very similar that was
[39:28] a time of Jesus but in the days of Egypt
[39:31] jacoub had got a letter in the mail
[39:32] saying all the babies are gonna die and
[39:34] the Bible said she wasn't afraid of that
[39:36] so she placed her baby Moses in the are
[39:39] why is that brother Bram said because
[39:41] they prayed until they saw the angel the
[39:43] Lord so what does that mean for us we
[39:46] must pray until we hear the word of the
[39:48] Lord from the Holy Spirit praise God so
[39:51] there's an example of a very mature
[39:53] Christian woman who stayed in her
[39:55] position and had the word of the Lord I
[39:58] like that
[39:58] amen that's another thought I want to
[40:01] bring them but looking at adoption a
[40:02] little more and I want to look into that
[40:04] by the grace of God once you appreciate
[40:06] that I think that'd be really good I
[40:08] think it'd be so wonderful because you
[40:10] know we so often look at preachers can
[40:12] be adopted but what about the common
[40:14] person we're just we're just common I'm
[40:16] common too don't get me wrong I'm
[40:17] talking about Jesus and brother branham
[40:18] they were men with higher rank I'm a
[40:21] common person I'm nothing but us common
[40:23] people like you and I it'd be wonderful
[40:25] to see what a positionally placed
[40:28] Christian ought to be amen
[40:31] so hopefully hopefully the Lord will
[40:33] give me a good message on that by God's
[40:34] grace now I want to read over these
[40:36] quotes one more time Jesus said they
[40:39] shall walk with me in white that is what
[40:41] God said he'll bestow upon them for this
[40:43] upright walk that is part of their
[40:46] inheritance that he's reserved for them
[40:48] if they were willing to walk with him
[40:50] through the toils and snares of life and
[40:52] be an honor to him he was going to
[40:55] reward them he's not forgetful of our
[40:57] labor of love God will always recompense
[40:59] us for our efforts to please him so
[41:03] Jesus here gives us a little foretaste
[41:04] the Millennium is not going to be all
[41:07] about sitting around playing harps on
[41:09] clouds that's not what the Millenium is
[41:13] gonna be about the future homes not
[41:14] gonna be about us singing and playing
[41:16] harps and everybody just in a choir you
[41:19] know we are gonna do things in the in
[41:23] the Millenium we're gonna build houses
[41:24] and we're gonna rule over nations and
[41:27] they will be our servants praise God and
[41:31] they and then the future home these
[41:33] people outside the city will bring their
[41:35] fruits into the city the Bible said they
[41:37] bring their glory into the city so we're
[41:41] going to be walking around doing
[41:42] something we're gonna need our bodies
[41:43] amen we're gonna so Jesus says if you
[41:46] walk with me on earth and Akron I'll
[41:48] walk with you in the Millenium amen I'll
[41:51] walk with you in the future home can you
[41:52] imagine walking next to Jesus what a
[41:55] privilege only really the disciples got
[41:57] to do it on the earth in a physical body
[41:59] but you and I if we walk with his spirit
[42:02] now he'll will walk with his body later
[42:04] praise God that's a reward if you walk
[42:07] with me now I'll walk with you later
[42:09] amen
[42:10] and I like that reward so I'm gonna walk
[42:12] for Christ and this day I want to walk
[42:15] with him in the future home
[42:16] Loran said yes they'd walk through the
[42:19] world and had not partaking of it now
[42:22] let's stop right there remember the
[42:23] story brother Graham said when he went
[42:24] to a foreign country he said a shepherd
[42:27] brought his sheep right through the
[42:28] middle of the city remember that the
[42:30] marketplace and he said those sheep were
[42:32] so trained they passed by tables of
[42:35] produce like apples and all these things
[42:39] and dates and all these things and the
[42:41] sheep were so trained to the voice of
[42:43] the shepherd that they never reached out
[42:45] and started to eat in any of the food
[42:46] they just went past all those
[42:48] temptations and follow the voice of the
[42:50] shepherd amen and remember I'm said
[42:52] that's exactly like the Christian today
[42:54] we pass through the world and there's
[42:56] temptations on the right hand and on the
[42:57] left isn't there Church everywhere you
[43:00] look there's a temptation here
[43:01] temptation there to do this or do that
[43:03] but the real saints of God walk with
[43:05] Christ they keep their eyes on Christ
[43:07] why because they're taking up a cross
[43:09] they have a burden and they're following
[43:11] Jesus amen I love that see we're we're
[43:15] walking amongst this but we must not
[43:18] partake of it they not let the world
[43:20] systems overcome them when the
[43:22] illustrious names of that age had unit
[43:25] to the blandishments of the state since
[43:27] this speaking of Luther's day and chosen
[43:29] political mind in this rather than
[43:30] spiritual - and were on their way back
[43:32] into the world
[43:33] those few stood for the word of God and
[43:36] thereby honored the Lord I like that and
[43:41] then he says next now he would honor
[43:43] them in return for they shall walk with
[43:46] him in white they had identified
[43:48] themselves with him on earth and now he
[43:50] would identify himself with them in the
[43:52] New Jerusalem and how marvelous will be
[43:55] that identification praise God is that
[43:58] beautiful praise the Lord
[44:01] alright next one here it makes me
[44:04] rejoice and yet it makes me weep to
[44:06] think
[44:06] his condescension for you will note that
[44:09] he is not dressed in another color
[44:11] different from the Saints as earthly
[44:13] leaders would so do know they are like
[44:16] him he is like them they are like him
[44:18] even as John said they shall see him as
[44:21] he is praise God
[44:23] do you realize now here's where we get
[44:25] to this so I want to spend the rest of
[44:27] the time on here and I got about 45
[44:29] minutes good for they are worthy do you
[44:34] realise who sang this it is Jesus the
[44:36] worthy one himself this is the only one
[44:39] who is accounted worthy to take the book
[44:41] out of the hand of him who sits upon the
[44:44] throne and now this worthy one is saying
[44:46] to a Saints you are worthy here is the
[44:49] one the only one qualified to judge and
[44:52] indeed all judgment is committed unto
[44:54] him and he says you are worthy that's a
[44:58] mouthful right there praise the Lord
[45:00] but the worthy one is the one who calls
[45:03] us worthy praise God
[45:06] now I got a few more scriptures I want
[45:09] to read this again these words are as
[45:11] astounding as are the words in Romans
[45:14] 8:33 God says I am righteous who shall
[45:19] lay any charge to God's elect for God is
[45:22] the one who justifies us now you can say
[45:24] here tonight and say brother Jesse
[45:25] preached some astounding words because
[45:28] it wasn't my words it was Christ who
[45:30] herds and program said these should be
[45:32] astounding to you that Jesus lets us
[45:35] know that God says I'm righteous you and
[45:38] I can't brag on how righteous we are but
[45:40] if God says we're righteous then who's
[45:42] gonna argue with God on an area and the
[45:45] only way we're righteous is when we meet
[45:48] his requirements and his Quran
[45:50] requirements are very little because the
[45:52] Bible said even a fool shall not err in
[45:54] God's requirements the highway of
[45:57] holiness the way of holiness it's so
[45:59] simple even a fool can't miss it if we
[46:02] just reach God's simple requirements
[46:05] glory there in the white light of God's
[46:08] righteousness hear the sweet voice of
[46:10] Jesus as he says these are mine they are
[46:13] righteous they're worthy they shall walk
[46:15] with me in white note we're worthy
[46:18] because God says we're worthy
[46:20] no doubt church a lot of people might
[46:23] have looked at Judas and said that guy's
[46:24] worthy boy he's he's preached three and
[46:26] a half years whether Bram said his
[46:28] ministry was no less than any of the
[46:30] other ones if you listen if you read the
[46:33] rest of the church age that's what he
[46:34] talks about in the book of life he
[46:35] spends a lot of time on Judas how his
[46:37] name was removed his anointing was just
[46:40] as powerful as the other brothers right
[46:42] his anointing now when he was under the
[46:44] anointing when he would get his sin out
[46:46] of his heart you know and get anointed
[46:47] and do miracles where the RAM said he
[46:49] had a Holy Ghost given ministry not Holy
[46:51] Ghost sealed ministry but just the Holy
[46:54] Ghost anointed ministry they would
[46:56] understand that his soul was never
[46:58] sealed now those brothers weren't either
[47:00] but eventually they were on the day of
[47:02] Pentecost eleven of them were you see
[47:05] but he had a Holy Ghost anointed
[47:07] ministry because Jesus I give you power
[47:08] to cast out demons I gave you power to
[47:10] heal the sick and raise the dead amen
[47:12] you see that so Judas here is one like
[47:18] this the Bible says here the Bible said
[47:21] he had a real ministry the Bible said an
[47:23] action after one that he had a part of
[47:24] the Apostleship of the Apostles and
[47:27] brother Branham said the thing that
[47:28] makes us shiver about Judas he said the
[47:31] reason we shiver when we hear the name
[47:32] of Judas is because he was given the
[47:34] highest calling in the Bible but he
[47:36] turned it down because there's no higher
[47:39] calling than to be an apostle to be a
[47:41] missionary for Jesus Christ and the
[47:43] church said there's no higher calling to
[47:46] leave your home and children and to
[47:48] leave your lands and preach the gospel
[47:49] to Jesus Christ to people that never
[47:52] heard it there's no higher life you
[47:54] could possibly live than that how many
[47:56] understand that to forsake your children
[47:59] or not not forsake them but just not be
[48:00] with them right they still you still got
[48:02] to give them food and make sure they're
[48:03] with their why their mother and
[48:04] everything like that but to leave your
[48:06] home and leave everything and go to a
[48:08] unknown land
[48:09] and preach the gospel of Jesus Christ
[48:11] there's no higher calling in the Bible
[48:13] and so that's what Judas left he left
[48:15] the highest calling in the Bible for
[48:18] some chump change for some money and
[48:21] brother man said he was fooled because
[48:24] he did the same thing that Balaam did at
[48:27] bale prbl PR said you guys come over
[48:29] worship with us works we're all the same
[48:31] we're all the same church and God killed
[48:33] 24
[48:34] thousand then because they started
[48:35] fornicating with those bailet balaam
[48:38] women Amen remember that from numbers
[48:40] chapter 25 so Judas did the same thing
[48:43] he sold out he was tricked well I just
[48:45] I'll just be a little money here on the
[48:47] side and Jesus so maybe save himself or
[48:49] or we're all believers you know all
[48:51] these things I'll just take a little
[48:52] more money here I'll tell them where
[48:53] Jesus is at and the Bible said he found
[48:56] no place to repentance that's exactly
[48:58] right and I know that's some tough harsh
[49:00] truth but that's the Bible amen
[49:01] and the Bible has all the word of the
[49:04] truth for us amen the word of the Lord
[49:06] amen now I want to look at the word
[49:08] worthy here just a moment jesus said
[49:12] those who walk with me and white on this
[49:15] earth are worthy of me now our word
[49:19] worthy is this this is from my phone I
[49:23] just copied and pasted it you know here
[49:25] Webster's dictionary says it's an
[49:27] adjective so it's a describing word it
[49:32] means good and deserving respect praise
[49:34] or attention it means having good enough
[49:39] qualities to be considered important or
[49:41] useful huh me know you're important to
[49:43] God everyone is important to God you
[49:47] know why because he sent his son to die
[49:49] for you that's how he everybody is
[49:51] important for him even the sinner the
[49:53] Bible said God doesn't like when sinners
[49:55] die and go to hell
[49:56] God doesn't rejoice in the death of the
[49:58] wicked the Bible says God paid the price
[50:00] and of all the sin his son was sinless
[50:02] and he died for all of us and Jesus was
[50:05] saying I love you all all of you need to
[50:07] come to me but so many people will turn
[50:09] them down because of love of the world
[50:11] they love sin and Sexton and music and
[50:15] rock and roll and all kinds of things
[50:17] they love all those things more they
[50:18] love Christ how could you not love
[50:20] Christ more than that because Christ
[50:21] died for your sins amen
[50:23] how could you not love Christ more than
[50:25] that it shouldn't be easy at times to
[50:27] walk away from some of these things
[50:28] because of love amen
[50:30] because when you see God's love how can
[50:32] you not feel love for that if somebody
[50:34] does something good for you how can you
[50:36] not want to love them back again and no
[50:38] one here none of us can do anything
[50:40] close to what God did for us when he
[50:42] gave us Christ amen it's exactly right
[50:45] let's see we're worth we have to be
[50:47] worthy
[50:48] we have to be worthy of God's respect we
[50:52] have to be worthy we have to be
[50:54] important to God we have to live a life
[50:56] that's important to God we can't a waste
[50:58] away our lives so the full definition is
[51:01] having worth or value means honorable or
[51:06] merit to us I think I'm saying that
[51:08] right that's a fancy word I bought I'm
[51:09] not real good with that one now if you
[51:11] got your Bible go to 1st Samuel please
[51:13] 1st Samuel I believe it's chapter 29
[51:16] that's enough I'm sorry chapter 2 I got
[51:20] some scriptures like I said I want to go
[51:21] through 1st Samuel to 29 yeah that's
[51:24] right first time into 29 good to see
[51:25] Benjamin god bless you sir and your
[51:28] friend name is Jamar unless the Lord
[51:35] amen
[51:37] all right first samuel 229 if you got
[51:40] your Bibles they're for Samuel 229 now
[51:43] give you the background on this God is
[51:45] giving a judgment against Eli he was a
[51:48] high priest in other words he's like the
[51:49] leader of the church at that time
[51:50] remember and God is giving him a word
[51:54] through the little child Samuel I'm
[51:55] gonna remove you and your family from
[51:57] being priests and you know the reason
[52:00] why because Eli honored his sons more
[52:03] than he honored God mm are being worthy
[52:06] is you're deserving of respect and honor
[52:09] your honorable your honorable so let's
[52:13] see how Eli dishonored the Lord because
[52:16] he lost his position he lost his
[52:17] preaching really he lost his ministry
[52:19] because he dishonored the Lord if he
[52:22] would have just honor the Lord he
[52:24] wouldn't remain a servant of the Lord
[52:26] First Samuel 229 wherefore kicky at my
[52:29] sacrifice and at my offering which I've
[52:31] commanded in my habitation and honors
[52:34] thy sons above me to make yourselves fat
[52:37] with the chiefest of all the offerings
[52:38] of Israel my people let's stop right
[52:41] there remember Eli sons would intercept
[52:48] the people before they got to actually
[52:49] sacrifice the animals and they would cut
[52:53] them because remember the priest rightly
[52:54] divided the sacrifice remember that type
[52:55] of the New Testament how the minister
[52:57] has to rightly divide the Bible to you
[52:59] those sacrifices had to be rightly
[53:01] divided
[53:02] well God was supposed to get all the
[53:04] pieces that had the fat on him because
[53:06] God get all the fat it was a sin for
[53:07] Israel but Eli sons would intersect that
[53:10] and they would take those pieces and eat
[53:12] it until they actually started gaining
[53:13] weight Eli was so big when he died the
[53:15] Bible said he was a large man because he
[53:17] was eating too much fat that fat should
[53:19] have went to God so they were taking
[53:21] they were breaking the scripture to feed
[53:24] their flesh and how many people will do
[53:26] that today they'll break the scripture
[53:28] just to make their flesh happy right
[53:31] whether it's food or whatever it is
[53:32] movies whatever it is you know who you
[53:34] can make it whatever it is just to make
[53:37] their flesh happy just to make
[53:38] themselves comfortable when they would
[53:40] intersect that and take that and God is
[53:43] saying this you kick against my
[53:44] sacrifice and in other words you're
[53:46] ruining the worship the worship has a
[53:48] certain order and you're supposed to
[53:50] keep the order amen how many people ruin
[53:53] the song service because they come in
[53:54] here and they're bored singing their
[53:55] songs for God or they're falling asleep
[53:58] during the the preaching of the word
[53:59] when this is the only thing that will
[54:01] give them life because the word has life
[54:05] amen
[54:05] Jesus said my words are spirit and my
[54:08] words are life the whole time the words
[54:10] being preached the Holy Spirit's trying
[54:11] to say believe it believe it accept it
[54:13] act on it change your life repent the
[54:16] Holy Spirit is trying to give him the
[54:17] offering but they kick against it and
[54:19] deny it it's exactly right church and
[54:21] they honor their sons above me to make
[54:26] themselves fat with the cheapest of all
[54:27] the offerings look at verse 30 wherefore
[54:30] the Lord he said God of Israel saith I
[54:34] said indeed that thy house and the house
[54:36] of thy father should walk before me
[54:38] forever but now he saith be it far for
[54:42] me for them that honor me will I honor
[54:45] and they that despise me shall be
[54:48] lightly esteemed praise God
[54:51] so how many want to be worthy of God's
[54:53] love I'm going to be worthy this is how
[54:56] you do it you honor God above everybody
[54:59] else then that sound familiar Jesus said
[55:02] he was worthy of me has to love me more
[55:04] than father mother children they have to
[55:07] obey my words above what their dad tells
[55:09] them or their grandpa or grandma right
[55:12] if they break God's Word and someone's
[55:14] telling you to break god's word you've
[55:15] got to deny
[55:16] and honor God's Word that's how you
[55:18] honor God and the second thing was I
[55:21] forgot was Eli sons were sleeping and
[55:23] having adultery with the people who
[55:24] women in the church right so that's the
[55:29] idea
[55:31] Eli was not honoring God he was honoring
[55:35] it himself and his sons by letting them
[55:37] have the food that was God's so taking
[55:39] part of God's offering and worship and
[55:41] also Eli should remove his sons for
[55:44] having adultery with the women in the
[55:46] church but he let them he said all it's
[55:48] okay they can keep preaching that would
[55:50] that's what it would be for us today oh
[55:51] they can keep playing song specials oh
[55:54] they can keep ministering and testifying
[55:56] in the church or speaking in tongues the
[55:59] church even though they're committing
[56:00] adultery and the Bible said if somebody
[56:02] commits adultery get that leaven out of
[56:04] the church are you with me
[56:06] amen but see Eli didn't have enough
[56:10] backbone to get his own sons out of the
[56:12] position so God said because of that
[56:14] you've honored me more than you've
[56:16] honored I'm sorry you've honored them
[56:17] more than you've honored me and so Eli
[56:20] was not worthy he was not honorable
[56:22] enough to be a priest of God how many
[56:25] love the Lord tonight see acne right so
[56:28] see God there is a honor that we can
[56:31] achieve it's not through our perfection
[56:33] it's through his perfection hallelujah
[56:36] it's exactly right
[56:37] now let's go look at a few more
[56:39] scriptures here so to be worthy of Jesus
[56:41] so far he's told us you have to forsake
[56:44] your family and put the word above
[56:46] everything that doesn't mean you leave
[56:47] him because remember if you don't
[56:48] provide for your family you're worse
[56:49] than an infidel right like men that
[56:53] don't provide for their children and
[56:54] wives they're worse than infidels so it
[56:57] doesn't mean don't provide for him it
[56:59] does it just means don't listen to them
[57:00] if they tell you to do something that's
[57:01] above the word obey the word first
[57:05] that's right so we obey the word first
[57:09] and then Jesus said he said then after
[57:11] that and once I'm first in your life
[57:13] you're worthy of me then take up a cross
[57:15] find a burden right find your ministry
[57:17] find your position and hold that
[57:19] position the rest of your days amen
[57:21] glory it's exactly right that's what
[57:24] Jesus said if you do that now you're
[57:26] worthy of eternal life that's
[57:29] exactly right now I want to make sure I
[57:32] do that now let's go to I told you I
[57:35] wrote let's read this Psalms 9212 Psalms
[57:40] 9212 Psalms 9212 our only hope is in the
[57:53] Word of God and where is the Word of God
[57:55] at it's in the house of God praise the
[57:58] Lord
[57:59] Psalms 9212 the righteous shall flourish
[58:01] like the palm tree he shall grow like a
[58:04] cedar in Lebanon cedar trees are pretty
[58:06] thick from what I've read I've never
[58:07] seen one of their in a Palestine but
[58:10] I've heard they're really thick they're
[58:11] so thick that Solomon used them to build
[58:13] the temple of God which was the greatest
[58:15] structure ever built at that time verse
[58:18] 13 those that be planted in the house of
[58:21] the Lord shall flourish in the courts of
[58:25] our God they shall still bring forth
[58:28] fruit in old age they shall be fat and
[58:30] flourishing you like that the picture is
[58:34] of Moses is tabernacle or Solomon's
[58:38] tabernacle you had the house of God
[58:40] which was called the holy place and the
[58:42] holy place inside that was the holiest
[58:45] of Holies
[58:45] that was called the house of the Lord
[58:47] and the Bible says if you plant yourself
[58:49] in the house of God
[58:52] you'll flourish in the courts of God
[58:54] which are the outer courts can you
[58:57] picture can you picture us planning some
[59:00] blueberry bushes and here in Vaes apple
[59:02] trees or maybe some pumpkin vines
[59:04] picture us planting something in here
[59:07] because this is the house of the Lord
[59:09] and if we plant them here God will bless
[59:13] them pumpkin vine so much they'll grow
[59:15] out into the hallway and they'll grow
[59:17] right right out into the parking lot
[59:19] that's the picture God's given us that'd
[59:22] be some pretty mighty vegetables that'd
[59:24] be a pretty big I could see how a tree
[59:25] could do that break through the ceiling
[59:27] and everything like that to get to the
[59:28] light but that's what God says if you
[59:31] want to be fruitful for Jesus Christ
[59:33] he said plant yourself in the house of
[59:35] God and you'll flourish in the courts of
[59:37] God amen you will become so strong
[59:40] spiritually that your strength will be
[59:41] seen not just in church but
[59:43] seen out there in public amen that's
[59:46] exactly right that's the word of the
[59:48] Lord people outside the house of God
[59:50] have a point zero one chance to be saved
[59:54] and that's in first Peter 4 let's go
[59:56] first Peter 4 you remember this scarcely
[1:00:00] saved someone outside the house of God
[1:00:03] our scarcely saved it's gonna be almost
[1:00:06] impossible to be saved unless they do
[1:00:08] something nice to a Christian that's the
[1:00:11] only way they can be saved outside of
[1:00:14] the house of God I know that's rough but
[1:00:16] that is the scripture and not happy -
[1:00:19] happily meet anybody to show me any
[1:00:20] scripture that teaches any different I
[1:00:22] say that humbly now I would never argue
[1:00:24] anything like that but say humbly that
[1:00:26] is the word of the Lord first Peter
[1:00:30] chapter 4 I was back in heave of Hebrews
[1:00:34] parmie 1st Peter chapter 4 verse 17 now
[1:00:40] this tech context is talking about
[1:00:42] suffering for a Christian Paul said if
[1:00:45] you live wholly in this life you're
[1:00:48] gonna suffer persecution that's right
[1:00:51] to some degree you'll suffer persecution
[1:00:53] now the most severe I think I've had on
[1:00:55] me is that people at churches have
[1:00:57] labeled my name and say have nothing to
[1:00:59] do with that guy because I've talked to
[1:01:01] them and they've told me themselves now
[1:01:03] if people had people lie on me and say
[1:01:05] Jesse said this and that and come back
[1:01:06] and they asked me did you say that I
[1:01:07] didn't say that
[1:01:08] so people lied on me and they've warm
[1:01:11] pita me about that they've warned their
[1:01:13] people about me and their churches
[1:01:14] that's the most persecution I've got
[1:01:16] other than people just rejected me and
[1:01:17] not contact me anymore but we there's
[1:01:20] some level of persecution for people
[1:01:22] that live godly in Christ Jesus
[1:01:24] there is some level persecution 1st
[1:01:28] Peter 4:17 for the time has come that
[1:01:31] judgment must begin at the house of God
[1:01:33] and if at first begin at us
[1:01:36] where does judgment start right here how
[1:01:39] can people escape judgment if they're
[1:01:40] not even hearing what's being judged
[1:01:42] right you have to hear the judgments
[1:01:45] that you can escape them and at first
[1:01:48] begin to us what should be the end of
[1:01:49] them and that obey not the gospel so see
[1:01:53] we see a lot of things from there
[1:01:54] someone that's not even in the house of
[1:01:56] God they're not going
[1:01:57] you're the judgments of God and they're
[1:02:00] not even gonna obey God because they're
[1:02:01] not hearing the word of the Lord
[1:02:02] look at verse 18 and if the righteous
[1:02:05] scarcely be saved think of lot lot was
[1:02:08] scarcely saved the fiery left the city
[1:02:10] and then the fire fell scarcely saved
[1:02:13] he wasn't like Abraham who was living
[1:02:15] miles away from it the Bible said
[1:02:17] Abraham was so far he just saw the smoke
[1:02:19] of it but lot it was hot on his back and
[1:02:22] the angels had to pull him out god help
[1:02:24] us to live such a life
[1:02:25] we live so far away from sin that we
[1:02:27] don't feel the flames of heat of hail
[1:02:29] amen understand what I'm saying we
[1:02:33] should be so far removed away from sin
[1:02:35] that we should stand afar off and live
[1:02:38] such a godly righteous life that
[1:02:39] everybody knows I'm not of Sodom amen
[1:02:42] I'm not of the world
[1:02:44] I'm of Christ hallelujah I serve the
[1:02:47] only living God the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:49] exactly right and if the righteous
[1:02:52] scarcely say where should the ungodly
[1:02:54] and sinner appear remember judgment
[1:02:58] begins with us that's why we come to
[1:03:00] church so he can be judged amen who
[1:03:03] knows what happens when you miss a court
[1:03:04] date do they find you what happens when
[1:03:07] you miss the Courtney I know one time I
[1:03:08] had a court date because I hid some
[1:03:09] money in a car and I had to go to the
[1:03:11] court but I don't know what happened if
[1:03:12] I missed it I think they'd find me or
[1:03:14] something awful would happen a warrant
[1:03:17] for your arrest all right they put a
[1:03:18] warrant on you then you got this black
[1:03:20] cloud hanging over you're right I'm
[1:03:22] gonna get you sir or I'm gonna get you
[1:03:23] ma'am if you don't show up to the house
[1:03:27] of God I'm saying God wants his children
[1:03:31] to be in the house of God so that their
[1:03:33] lives can be judged they can be
[1:03:35] straightened out and they can hear the
[1:03:36] part near the pardoning words of the
[1:03:38] judge you're forgiven and you're worthy
[1:03:41] amen you confess your sins you met my
[1:03:43] requirements and you're forgiven
[1:03:45] hallelujah what if I went to this
[1:03:48] happened one time one time I had a
[1:03:50] speeding ticket what if I went to the
[1:03:51] municipal judge and okay they said okay
[1:03:54] the case is closed
[1:03:55] you're fine is $120 what if I walked in
[1:03:59] there or what if somebody walked in
[1:04:01] there and said Adam walked in they say
[1:04:02] judge hold on I'll pay his fine what
[1:04:06] does that do for me it saves me from
[1:04:07] being suffering the judgment right Adam
[1:04:10] says here's
[1:04:11] $120 let the man off the hook and I
[1:04:14] could say praise the Lord I I didn't
[1:04:16] have $120 something like that and that's
[1:04:19] exactly what Christ did for you the
[1:04:22] Bible said Christ paid your ransom let's
[1:04:24] put it at two trillion dollars that's
[1:04:26] how much it costs to get you out of jail
[1:04:28] and the blood of Jesus Christ paid your
[1:04:31] price amen
[1:04:32] you're free you know what this you
[1:04:34] there's no way you could pay it well
[1:04:36] that's what Christ did when he died for
[1:04:38] you all the sins of the world were put
[1:04:40] on him and he's you're worthy lamb you
[1:04:42] just have to believe in him and if you
[1:04:44] believe him you'll love him and you'll
[1:04:46] serve Him amen but if you love Satan the
[1:04:49] world you'll live for Satan in the world
[1:04:50] but if you love Christ you'll live for
[1:04:52] Christ amen because he paid your fine at
[1:04:56] the courtroom holiday there's no warrant
[1:04:58] over me
[1:04:59] God ain't looking to rest me or or
[1:05:01] chasing me or anything like that
[1:05:02] my debts been paid amen Christ that
[1:05:05] didn't paid for me and now I'm free as a
[1:05:07] bird as a eagle and I'm living for Jesus
[1:05:09] amen
[1:05:10] exactly right so we must be planted in
[1:05:14] the house of God then we'll flourish in
[1:05:16] the courts of our God how can we escape
[1:05:20] judgment if we don't come to the house
[1:05:22] of judgment to be judged or forgiven we
[1:05:26] can't we must come to the house of God
[1:05:28] for what God said we must come for
[1:05:30] forgiveness praise the Lord now let's
[1:05:34] look at a few more worthy scriptures
[1:05:35] here I got a few more scriptures now
[1:05:38] this is the ones we looked at on Sunday
[1:05:39] here right here we looked at these on
[1:05:40] Sunday and I want to go over these here
[1:05:45] here it says this we went over this John
[1:05:49] the Baptist said I'm not even worthy to
[1:05:51] loose the latchet of your sandals
[1:05:54] that's how holy Christ is we're not even
[1:05:57] worthy to take off his his shoes and and
[1:06:00] kiss his feet now God he loved God loves
[1:06:02] that though and someone will home with
[1:06:03] him selves but we're not even worthy to
[1:06:05] do it we are not even worthy to approach
[1:06:07] him but yet he's so loving and merciful
[1:06:08] he lets us approach him and then the
[1:06:11] roman centurion said jesus i'm not even
[1:06:14] worthy that you come over to my house
[1:06:15] just speak the word and it'll be done
[1:06:18] and jesus said I haven't found so great
[1:06:21] a faith even in Israel because the faith
[1:06:24] like that
[1:06:25] to Beach worthy of Jesus reward you must
[1:06:28] take up your cross daily amen you must
[1:06:30] have a burden you must have a position a
[1:06:32] burden that you hold all the days of
[1:06:34] your life serving Christ and you must
[1:06:36] also put Christ above your family and
[1:06:38] everybody else's ideas about everything
[1:06:40] that's exactly right
[1:06:42] jesus said here let's go this let's go
[1:06:44] to luke 21:36 this is all through the
[1:06:47] Bible
[1:06:47] you must be worthy you must meet God's
[1:06:50] requirements to escape the tribulation
[1:06:53] luke 21:36 so on this sermon I'm
[1:06:59] focusing more on what we do right I'm
[1:07:01] not focusing on how God is sovereign and
[1:07:03] it's all about God's saving it is all
[1:07:05] about that but God has to have something
[1:07:07] to base it upon and that's our faith or
[1:07:09] unbelief are we gonna choose to believe
[1:07:12] or choose to disbelief right so we're
[1:07:14] looking at that we're looking at the
[1:07:15] human choice today not so much how God
[1:07:17] is choosing we know God chooses right we
[1:07:19] know that but we don't know that that's
[1:07:21] all in God's mind we're looking at what
[1:07:23] men see not so much what God sees right
[1:07:26] as far as eternally and we'll look at
[1:07:29] that again next Wednesday we look at the
[1:07:30] book of life Lord willing Luke 21:36 but
[1:07:34] they men can you read that for me sir
[1:07:45] hey man so now we have more requirements
[1:07:49] to be worthy you have to watch and pray
[1:07:50] all the time
[1:07:51] if you want escape evil watch and pray
[1:07:55] that's what you have to do Jesus tells
[1:07:57] us we know how to be worthy whether I'm
[1:07:59] in the church a book he said how can a
[1:08:03] man know if he's right with God he said
[1:08:04] let that man obey the words of Christ
[1:08:06] and he know and then he'll know he'll
[1:08:08] heal the hurt he'll hear those words
[1:08:10] well done thou good and faithful servant
[1:08:13] hallelujah how do I know I'm worthy I've
[1:08:17] met his requirements I've done exactly
[1:08:19] what Jesus said I'm constantly watching
[1:08:21] and praying looking for the coming of
[1:08:23] the Lord and my life is lined up with
[1:08:24] God's Word exactly right the Rieger the
[1:08:30] disciples rejoiced that they were worthy
[1:08:33] to suffer for Christ and sometimes a
[1:08:38] we're not careful we can discourage if
[1:08:39] we have to suffer for Christ they
[1:08:41] rejoiced when they suffered for Christ
[1:08:43] because they knew I'm worthy but I'm
[1:08:46] living a life that's worthy of the
[1:08:47] gospel and we mention this I'm not going
[1:08:50] to read those because we don't have time
[1:08:52] suffering now is not worthy to be
[1:08:56] compared to the glory that's to come
[1:08:58] let's read that Romans 8:18 I do want to
[1:08:59] read that one Romans 8:18 any trial or
[1:09:03] any hard time you're going through right
[1:09:04] now whether it's like we heard of our
[1:09:06] prayer requests depression or temptation
[1:09:09] or loneliness or whatever maybe whatever
[1:09:12] you're going through right now it's
[1:09:14] nothing compared to the great blessings
[1:09:16] God has for you if you believe in his
[1:09:18] word Romans 8:18 this life is so short
[1:09:22] my Romans 8:18 for I reckon that the
[1:09:29] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:09:30] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:09:32] which shall be revealed in us is I've
[1:09:36] been worthy to be compared it's so great
[1:09:38] it's so honorable eternal life and an
[1:09:41] eternal peace an eternal happiness is
[1:09:43] that you can't even compare it to the
[1:09:44] little things we suffer on this earth I
[1:09:47] know it's hard for some people to
[1:09:49] understand but it's the Bible truth I
[1:09:51] want to read a few of these also let's
[1:09:54] go let's go the next one let's go to
[1:09:55] first Corinthians 6:2 I want to read
[1:09:56] that one now this is a little different
[1:10:04] aspect of being worthy first Corinthians
[1:10:08] 6:2 so in this case one of the members
[1:10:12] of the church at Corinth was going to
[1:10:14] sue another member of the church like
[1:10:18] maybe like maybe uh maybe someone's
[1:10:23] gonna sue me who's that somebody's gonna
[1:10:27] sue me in the church they say brother
[1:10:29] Jesse didn't do this or that or he
[1:10:31] mistreated me all these things like that
[1:10:33] well the Bible said in verse 1 dare any
[1:10:36] of you having a matter against another
[1:10:37] go to law before the unjust and not
[1:10:39] before the Saints in other words Paul
[1:10:42] said I dare you who would dare to go to
[1:10:46] an unrighteous judge rather than come to
[1:10:49] the house of God what does that tell you
[1:10:51] or here if we got the real holy
[1:10:53] ghost there's more honour and justice
[1:10:55] here than in the courtroom the Summit
[1:10:58] County courtroom there's more honor and
[1:11:00] justice here why cuz we've got God's
[1:11:02] spirit here no one's trying to pay
[1:11:04] anybody off there's no political - the
[1:11:06] only headquarters were concerned about
[1:11:07] is heaven hallelujah
[1:11:09] making sure Jesus's word is fulfilled
[1:11:12] look at verse 2 do you not know that the
[1:11:16] Saints shall judge the world and if the
[1:11:19] world shall be judged by you are you
[1:11:21] unworthy to judge the smallest matters
[1:11:24] huh look at that now powerful we think
[1:11:28] oh I'm going to get my day in court you
[1:11:29] don't know now people think that not a
[1:11:30] people thing I'm gonna get my day in
[1:11:32] court I'm finally gonna get my money
[1:11:34] back or whatever you see how they think
[1:11:36] and Paul said you're the ones that are
[1:11:40] worthy to judge now the trouble is
[1:11:42] people that will get like that they
[1:11:43] don't want to bring it before the church
[1:11:45] because they know they're gonna lose
[1:11:46] because they got a evil spirit on them
[1:11:47] and they know the real Holy Spirit will
[1:11:50] sniff that out yes some wrong there some
[1:11:54] wrong you know discern that evil spirit
[1:11:57] so the real Christian doesn't mind
[1:11:59] coming before bringing the matter before
[1:12:01] the church but it's the one who's wrong
[1:12:03] usually don't want to do that right
[1:12:06] unless there's a corrupt leaders then
[1:12:08] the person who's corrupt you get the
[1:12:10] karp leaders on their side then they'll
[1:12:11] come before the church but see how
[1:12:13] everybody's got to be fill with the Holy
[1:12:14] Ghost and if you remember you remember I
[1:12:17] think the Bible said here if I'm not
[1:12:18] mistaken I think Paul said find the
[1:12:23] least esteemed members in the church
[1:12:25] through the judging I think if I'm not
[1:12:26] mistaken is that right yes well I can't
[1:12:32] find it anybody find it which verse that
[1:12:34] was Yeah right there verse four and if
[1:12:39] then ye have judgments of things
[1:12:41] pertaining this life set them to judge
[1:12:43] who are least esteemed in the church not
[1:12:45] the most popular or rich people in the
[1:12:47] church the people who are the least
[1:12:49] esteemed they will give a true judgment
[1:12:52] why because they're not swayed by money
[1:12:54] only swayed by the Holy Ghost amen
[1:12:58] but see don't you know we're worthy to
[1:13:02] judge even the smallest matters well
[1:13:04] I've got this against the preacher for
[1:13:05] the
[1:13:05] so that I've got this against the person
[1:13:07] for this or that the person we should go
[1:13:10] to is the church we should go to that
[1:13:13] person individually right if they won't
[1:13:15] hear you
[1:13:15] then you'd bring somebody else usually
[1:13:17] just program said take a deacon with you
[1:13:19] okay you can bring me I'm the deacon and
[1:13:22] the pastor you can bring me if somebody
[1:13:23] hurts you in this church and they won't
[1:13:25] hear you they won't repent bring me if
[1:13:27] they were repenting for that then we
[1:13:29] give them 30 days or whatever time and
[1:13:31] if they don't get right with God get him
[1:13:33] out of the church and treat him like a
[1:13:34] heathen don't even look don't even
[1:13:36] listen to him
[1:13:36] that's how God's church is supposed to
[1:13:38] operate and people aren't going to toe
[1:13:40] the line get them out of the church
[1:13:42] they're just going to be a they're just
[1:13:44] gonna bring their sin and lust and
[1:13:45] destruction and temptation all these
[1:13:47] demon powers they're just gonna bring it
[1:13:49] in the church but God don't want any
[1:13:51] leaven in this church he wants a loaf
[1:13:53] that's free from sin hallelujah we're
[1:13:56] better off without sinning the church
[1:13:57] know if we're small even if we're
[1:13:59] smaller God would rather have a small
[1:14:01] lump of unleavened bread than a big old
[1:14:03] luf of puffed up sin God hates sin and
[1:14:05] God don't want sin in this church it's
[1:14:09] exactly right so this is a different
[1:14:12] kind of worthy when you become a mature
[1:14:14] Christian now you're worthy to judge
[1:14:17] even the smallest matters so see there's
[1:14:20] a level of worthiness or honor that we
[1:14:22] have as Christians in this life now we
[1:14:25] don't want to take communion unworthy
[1:14:27] the Bible said if we do that that's the
[1:14:29] reason many people get sick in the
[1:14:31] church and can't get over their sickness
[1:14:32] that's the reason many people die in the
[1:14:34] church is because they don't discern
[1:14:36] they don't judge God's body the right
[1:14:37] way they don't treat each other the
[1:14:39] right way that's why I've been laboring
[1:14:41] on that we got to make sure we get all
[1:14:43] the complexes out treat everybody the
[1:14:44] right way love everybody look past their
[1:14:47] faults love everybody with the love of
[1:14:49] Christ
[1:14:50] if not then things can happen to us get
[1:14:53] sick die other things all because we
[1:14:56] didn't treat the body of Christ the
[1:14:58] right way let's go to Ephesians 4:1
[1:15:01] let's read those in Colossians 1:9 Paul
[1:15:07] says you must walk worthy of the
[1:15:08] invitation or vocation as the the King
[1:15:11] James word fusion is for one Asians for
[1:15:17] one how I do it on time okay for they
[1:15:19] two minutes oh my how did that happen
[1:15:21] visions for one I therefore the prisoner
[1:15:26] of the Lord beseech you that ye walk
[1:15:28] worthy of the vocation wherein you are
[1:15:30] called with all lowliness and meekness
[1:15:34] with long-suffering forbearing one
[1:15:36] another in love have patience with our
[1:15:38] brothers and sisters right have patience
[1:15:41] with them endeavouring to keep the unity
[1:15:43] of the Spirit in the bond of peace
[1:15:46] praise God
[1:15:47] so look at that we're a prisoner of the
[1:15:50] Lord calls a prisoner Lord and we must
[1:15:52] walk worthy we must live we must live
[1:15:55] honorably like the one who called us is
[1:15:57] very honorable Colossians 1:9 let's go
[1:16:01] there ephesians philippians colossians i
[1:16:05] want you to see this here as we look at
[1:16:07] worthy the worthy one has to call us
[1:16:10] worthy colossians 1 9 through 11 for
[1:16:16] this cause we also since the day we
[1:16:18] heard do not cease to pray for you and
[1:16:20] is to desire that you may be filled with
[1:16:22] the knowledge of his will in all wisdom
[1:16:24] and spiritual understanding that you
[1:16:26] might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
[1:16:28] pleasing so that here's another way to
[1:16:30] know you're worthy I'm doing everything
[1:16:32] that pleases the father the father would
[1:16:34] not be displeased with the relationship
[1:16:36] that I'm in with the job that I have
[1:16:38] with what I do with my money the father
[1:16:41] would not be displeased he's pleased
[1:16:43] with what I do all pleasing this means
[1:16:46] you're worthy in other words you're
[1:16:47] living as close to God as you possibly
[1:16:49] can
[1:16:51] verse that's finished verse 10 they're
[1:16:53] being fruitful in every good work and
[1:16:55] increasing in the knowledge of God
[1:16:58] there's so much more we need to learn
[1:17:00] about God how many can say amen to that
[1:17:01] you don't have it all figured out I
[1:17:03] don't have it all figured out there's so
[1:17:05] much more we can grow in God absolutely
[1:17:08] there's so much more I can learn there's
[1:17:10] so much more I can humble myself in many
[1:17:12] ways but we got to be willing to do it
[1:17:15] verse 11 strengthened with all my seed
[1:17:18] from the Word of God we come here to get
[1:17:19] strengthened we come here to grow come
[1:17:21] here to to let our fruits go out into
[1:17:23] the world according to his glorious
[1:17:26] power unto all patience and
[1:17:28] long-suffering with joyfulness okay
[1:17:32] now again suffering makes you early we
[1:17:35] just went through that Peter said if you
[1:17:36] suffer you're worthy of the gospel we
[1:17:39] must suffer loss of family loss of money
[1:17:41] loss of anything job any anything you
[1:17:43] must suffer loss of anything just to
[1:17:45] stand on God's Word that's exactly right
[1:17:48] now here's what I want you to this is
[1:17:50] what you need to do if you can get
[1:17:51] nothing out of this sermon which I hope
[1:17:53] you get a lot because some of these
[1:17:53] things are astounding the brother Graham
[1:17:55] said if you get nothing else out let's
[1:17:57] to get this pray for people that they
[1:18:00] can live a worthy life if your life is
[1:18:04] worthy then you want to see other people
[1:18:05] live worthy so if you get nothing else
[1:18:08] remember that you can pray for people
[1:18:10] that they'll live a worthy life second
[1:18:13] Thessalonians 1 verse 10 which I know
[1:18:16] you'll get more than that but I'm just
[1:18:17] saying everything everything is the word
[1:18:22] of everything the Word of God is
[1:18:23] critical for us second Thessalonians 1
[1:18:26] verse 10 and I read this to my children
[1:18:28] on Sunday night because I don't get to
[1:18:29] preach it you know excite kind of ran
[1:18:30] out of time I said children let's go to
[1:18:33] the scripture I want you to see this I
[1:18:34] show this to the children and I said
[1:18:36] let's pray remember the different people
[1:18:37] I call this when I said let's pray these
[1:18:39] people walk word remember that we prayed
[1:18:40] for some of our friends remember Lydia
[1:18:42] we pray for some of our friends we said
[1:18:44] God help them to live worthy of the
[1:18:46] gospel help them to live a hundred a
[1:18:48] life when the Christ just on Sunday
[1:18:51] night verse 10 and with all I'm sorry
[1:18:54] I'm in the wrong one yeah I'm in chapter
[1:18:57] 2 sorry 2nd Thessalonians chapter 1
[1:18:59] verse 10 when he shall come to be
[1:19:01] glorified in his Saints and to be
[1:19:03] admired in all them that believe because
[1:19:06] our testimony among you was believed in
[1:19:08] that day wherefore also we pray always
[1:19:12] for you that our God would count you up
[1:19:15] worthy of this calling amen and fulfill
[1:19:20] all the good pleasure of his goodness
[1:19:21] and the work of faith with power that's
[1:19:25] beautiful Paul says he told his church
[1:19:28] in Thessaloniki Salonika I'm always
[1:19:30] praying for you that you walk worthy of
[1:19:32] the gospel that you've heard I'm always
[1:19:34] praying god help brother so-and-so help
[1:19:36] sister so-and-so let them live a life
[1:19:38] that's worth aghast when if Paul was
[1:19:40] doing that and he had the Holy Ghost if
[1:19:42] you got the Holy Ghost you'll do the
[1:19:43] same thing I don't understand that
[1:19:46] he was constantly praying for this
[1:19:48] little church god help them to walk
[1:19:50] worthy of the gospel glory let's go to
[1:19:55] first that's Ari first Timothy 5:17
[1:19:57] let's read that one that's a good one
[1:19:59] this applies to preachers but of course
[1:20:01] it applies to everybody because
[1:20:02] everybody has influence in some capacity
[1:20:04] but this is particularly for preachers
[1:20:06] first Timothy 5:17 right after
[1:20:10] Thessalonians an elder of course is an
[1:20:16] elder in the office of a pastor elders
[1:20:22] that rule elder means you have a longer
[1:20:24] testimony of serving the Lord Jesus
[1:20:25] Christ but an elder who rules is has to
[1:20:29] be a preacher because the rule belongs
[1:20:30] to the fivefold ministry that rules that
[1:20:32] governs the church according to st. Paul
[1:20:35] let the elders that rule be counted
[1:20:38] worthy of double honor especially they
[1:20:42] who labor in the word and doctrine so
[1:20:45] when you have a preacher who's labored
[1:20:46] for years and years and years and word
[1:20:49] and doctrine you should give them double
[1:20:51] honor verse 18 for the scripture saith
[1:20:55] thou shalt not muzzle the ox that
[1:20:57] treadeth out the corn and the labourer
[1:20:59] is worthy of his reward an elder someone
[1:21:04] who has years and years of faithful
[1:21:06] service under God that person is worthy
[1:21:09] of honor next one this one I want this
[1:21:12] now this is a warning we read this on
[1:21:15] Sunday night in our Bible study let's
[1:21:17] read again Hebrews 10:29 this is a
[1:21:21] warning scrips remember the flashing red
[1:21:22] lights children memory to death it's a
[1:21:24] warning Scripture Hebrews 10:29 let's
[1:21:27] take heed to the warning now can you
[1:21:33] read that you got that one Hebrews 10:29
[1:21:36] thank you sir
[1:21:53] amen so doing this spite of the spirit
[1:21:56] of grace is disobeying the Holy Ghost
[1:21:59] how many one obey the Holy Ghost the
[1:22:01] Holy Ghost can't give you anything
[1:22:02] outside of this word hallelujah because
[1:22:05] the Holy Ghost wrote the word and about
[1:22:08] said how much more sore punishment will
[1:22:10] someone get who takes the word and then
[1:22:13] tramples on it like Judas did Judas was
[1:22:17] given here you're you're a preacher in
[1:22:19] the message of the hour he was given
[1:22:22] that but he he trampled on it left and
[1:22:24] said I can't well I'm not gonna walk
[1:22:25] with these guys I'd rather take the
[1:22:26] thirty pieces of silver he left that
[1:22:29] behind can you imagine that after seeing
[1:22:31] the miracles and the storm calmed on the
[1:22:34] sea can you imagine a little bit of
[1:22:35] filthy lucre money seen a miracle and
[1:22:37] then trotting that underfoot can you
[1:22:39] imagine that and that's why God said
[1:22:41] he's worthy of more punishment he saw
[1:22:45] the great miracles of God remember Jesus
[1:22:47] even said it's gonna be worth it's gonna
[1:22:49] be worse on all these cities that have
[1:22:51] seen my miracles it'll be worse on them
[1:22:53] and Sodom and Gomorrah right because a
[1:22:57] greater than that is here today praise
[1:22:59] God Jesus was greater than all Abraham
[1:23:02] he's greater than all of them and to
[1:23:03] turn that down after seeing all those
[1:23:06] miracles the punishment will be far
[1:23:08] worse than what even the homosexuals
[1:23:11] received at Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:23:13] that's shot that's shocking that's but
[1:23:17] that's the Word of God it's this one
[1:23:20] you're a believers response to the
[1:23:23] gospel makes you worthy let's go to acts
[1:23:27] 1346 in this scripture I believe Paul
[1:23:32] and Barnabas we're trying to get Jews to
[1:23:34] believe that Jesus was the Christ and
[1:23:36] they started blaspheming so they were
[1:23:38] basically saying Oh Paul and Barnabas
[1:23:40] threw out the devil and look what Paul I
[1:23:42] think Barnabas said this acts 1346 I'm
[1:23:45] not mistaken they say all these guys are
[1:23:48] abused about these guys are devils all
[1:23:49] these things like this Acts 1346 so I
[1:23:53] guess it said they both said
[1:23:56] then Paul Barnabas wax bone said it was
[1:23:59] necessary that the Word of God should
[1:24:00] have first been spoken to you but seeing
[1:24:03] you put it from you and judge yourselves
[1:24:06] unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn
[1:24:11] to the Gentiles for so hath the lord
[1:24:13] commanded us saying I have set thee to
[1:24:15] be a light of the Gentiles and thou
[1:24:16] should us be for salvation unto the ends
[1:24:18] of the earth amen
[1:24:21] so see a person's response whether they
[1:24:24] accept it or not where they say
[1:24:26] something good about or bad about it
[1:24:27] that is their own judgment upon
[1:24:30] themselves they're judging themselves
[1:24:32] that's right so see that's what we must
[1:24:36] consider remember and then what makes
[1:24:40] you unworthy of the wedding it's going
[1:24:41] to Matthew 22 we went over this briefly
[1:24:43] but let's read it again to refresh our
[1:24:45] hearts let's make sure we're not like
[1:24:47] these people making light of the wedding
[1:24:49] invitation Matthew 22 we cannot make
[1:24:56] light of the fact that Christ has
[1:24:58] invited us to his wedding and we search
[1:25:00] we're not just the invitation we're the
[1:25:02] one he's marrying we're the ones he
[1:25:07] wants to marry we're not just gonna
[1:25:08] watch there and stand and throw rice and
[1:25:10] wonderful go to sleep during the service
[1:25:13] we're the ones up there staring into our
[1:25:16] lover's eyes we're the one that
[1:25:18] everybody's honors and watches there's
[1:25:20] the bride here she comes
[1:25:22] give her salute stand and give her
[1:25:24] salute she's washed and why she's
[1:25:26] spotless she's holy amen
[1:25:29] she's just like Christ hallelujah
[1:25:31] hallelujah we're not just invited to
[1:25:34] attend we're invited to be the very one
[1:25:36] he marries now you remember this course
[1:25:40] Matthew 22 verse 2 the kingdom of heaven
[1:25:45] is like unto a certain King who made a
[1:25:47] marriage first sun and set forth the
[1:25:49] servants to call them that were bidden
[1:25:50] to the wedding and they would not come
[1:25:52] to the rapture again he sent forth other
[1:25:57] servants saying tell them which are
[1:25:58] bidden behold I prepared my dinner my ox
[1:26:00] and my fatlings are killed and all
[1:26:02] things are ready coming to the marriage
[1:26:03] but they made light of it it wasn't a
[1:26:07] heavy important issue in their lives it
[1:26:09] was just one of those
[1:26:09] we could go to church we could go to
[1:26:12] God's house we could do that but we
[1:26:14] could also do this or this or that with
[1:26:16] the Christian there's no choice you go
[1:26:18] to God's house because that's where
[1:26:20] God's Word is being judged right the
[1:26:22] truth is being judged that's where you
[1:26:23] can obey that the word of the Lord but
[1:26:26] see like now we could do that or we
[1:26:28] could do this they made light of it uh
[1:26:31] it's really not that important you can
[1:26:32] be still be saved maybe if you're nice
[1:26:34] to somebody who would ever take a chance
[1:26:36] like that that'd be foolish to take a
[1:26:38] chance like that
[1:26:38] well I'll try to get in on my last
[1:26:40] breath you don't even know if you have a
[1:26:42] last breath you know we know if you get
[1:26:44] to think about your last breath it's
[1:26:46] wise to obey God's Word now today's the
[1:26:50] day of salvation today is a day of
[1:26:52] repentance and they went their ways one
[1:26:56] to his farm and to other than others
[1:26:58] merchandise can you imagine this man
[1:27:01] would rather walk up and hug Bessie and
[1:27:02] kiss Bessie and say I love you cow and
[1:27:04] you're such a sweet cow they'd rather
[1:27:06] love and hug on their animals than they
[1:27:09] love and hug Jesus Christ and go to the
[1:27:11] house of God can you imagine that that
[1:27:13] seems insane they'd rather go play with
[1:27:18] their chickens you know then go to the
[1:27:20] Kings house for the marriage of his son
[1:27:22] well a lot of people doing today chase
[1:27:24] around some cats out there on the
[1:27:26] streets write some sexy dress cats you
[1:27:29] understand what I'm saying beetles and
[1:27:31] girls will chase the Beatles and the
[1:27:32] modern-day Beatles whatever you want to
[1:27:34] call them I don't know what they're
[1:27:35] called today hipsters I don't know what
[1:27:38] they're called but they'd rather chase
[1:27:40] animals and beastly people that go to
[1:27:43] the marriage of God's son amen
[1:27:45] they make light of it well I've might
[1:27:47] have next year I can do it when I get
[1:27:49] older or they went to the merchandise
[1:27:52] I'd rather have the new iPhone I rather
[1:27:54] spend my money on that and paid my
[1:27:56] tithes and offerings no they want
[1:28:00] merchandise I'd rather have this their
[1:28:02] houses or lands or what do you name it
[1:28:03] you name it I'd rather have this than
[1:28:06] have time with the king in his son
[1:28:10] that's right Church now go down to verse
[1:28:14] 8 then saith he to his servants the
[1:28:17] wedding is ready but they which were
[1:28:18] bidden were not worthy so again I don't
[1:28:22] want to be worthy for the wedding
[1:28:23] you must then come to the wedding
[1:28:27] you must come you must leave everything
[1:28:29] else and come to Christ wedding
[1:28:32] hallelujah worthy this is worthy and
[1:28:36] then look down in verse 11 once you get
[1:28:38] there you got to get the baptism of the
[1:28:39] Holy Ghost amen this is God's
[1:28:43] requirement for our day first you got to
[1:28:46] leave everything forsake everything then
[1:28:48] you got to come then you got to put on
[1:28:49] God's garment as well hallelujah
[1:28:53] verse 11 and when the king came in to
[1:28:55] see the guests he saw there a man which
[1:28:56] had not on a wedding garment so once you
[1:28:59] get to God's house then you got to put
[1:29:00] on the word that's being preached how
[1:29:03] many want to walk worthy of Christ
[1:29:04] there's more it's good to come it's good
[1:29:07] to come but now you got to put it on and
[1:29:09] what could we love so much that we would
[1:29:13] fall in love with something else and it
[1:29:15] could get all of our life
[1:29:16] what could we love so much more than
[1:29:18] God's love in Jesus Christ what could be
[1:29:21] so important like I was telling Benjamin
[1:29:24] just sitting yesterday I got a good
[1:29:25] fellowship this Christianity is based
[1:29:27] upon love that's all it's based upon
[1:29:29] right it's all based upon love love the
[1:29:33] Lord your God with all your heart soul
[1:29:35] mind and strength that's the greatest
[1:29:36] command love fall in love with this
[1:29:39] Savior fall in love with this provider
[1:29:41] fall in love with this healer amen fall
[1:29:43] in love with this Lord of lords and King
[1:29:45] of Kings amen fall in love with this
[1:29:47] risen Christ amen why can't people fall
[1:29:51] in love with I don't know because they
[1:29:52] love the things of the world too much
[1:29:54] they're living from the flesh instead of
[1:29:57] living from the inside it's exactly
[1:30:00] right that makes somebody unworthy of
[1:30:02] the wedding there's my hour so give me
[1:30:04] just five minutes let me set another
[1:30:05] timer here Jesus said you must be worthy
[1:30:11] of that world let's read that Luke 2035
[1:30:13] we must be worthy
[1:30:15] you must be honorable to make it to that
[1:30:19] world
[1:30:20] Luke 2035 2035 I think this might be a
[1:30:24] parallel passage it's one we read
[1:30:26] earlier I think but I'm not sure Luke
[1:30:30] 2035
[1:30:34] to be worthy of the gospel of Jesus
[1:30:36] Christ I want him to be first on him to
[1:30:40] have all my love on him to have all my
[1:30:41] allegiance I want to bear his cross as
[1:30:43] hard as it gets sometimes I want to bear
[1:30:46] his cross
[1:30:49] 20:35 but they which shall be accounted
[1:30:53] worthy to obtain that world and the
[1:30:55] resurrection from the dead neither marry
[1:30:57] nor are given in marriage again to be in
[1:31:00] that first resurrection you must live a
[1:31:02] worthy life a respectful of now for God
[1:31:07] to respect your life you must live a
[1:31:09] worthy respectable life that God can
[1:31:11] respect praise God
[1:31:13] alright I'm gonna skip past that I'm not
[1:31:19] gonna read that let me just do a couple
[1:31:20] more scriptures I have another scripture
[1:31:22] here I want to read I got about three
[1:31:29] four more thoughts I just want to share
[1:31:30] before we close I've been saying it over
[1:31:35] and over again but the only way were
[1:31:38] worthy is if God says we're worthy and
[1:31:41] the way we get God to say we're worthy
[1:31:43] is to keep his commands it is that
[1:31:46] simple that simple let's go - oh my ba
[1:31:59] just let me just read them and just
[1:32:00] share some thoughts here's because I
[1:32:01] stand on our feet I'm gonna close it is
[1:32:10] God Himself who can call us worthy but
[1:32:20] God knew what was behind that we must
[1:32:24] have faith the Bible said we must
[1:32:25] receive the end of our faith right we
[1:32:27] can start out but we must receive the
[1:32:28] end of it it must last other words all
[1:32:31] the way to the end in this story in
[1:32:35] Zechariah remember in Zechariah Joshua
[1:32:37] the high bridge this is in Joshua with
[1:32:39] Moses it's a different Joshua hundreds
[1:32:41] of years later Joshua the high priest
[1:32:42] has brought dirty garments remember that
[1:32:44] story and
[1:32:48] a voice said take away his filthy
[1:32:50] garments and clothe him with clean
[1:32:52] garments remember that it's in the
[1:32:54] Zechariah 3 form and he answered and
[1:32:56] spake unto those that sit before him
[1:32:57] saying take away the filthy garments
[1:32:59] from him and I'm saying hey we said
[1:33:01] behold I have caused I iniquity the
[1:33:04] bastard thee and I will clothe thee with
[1:33:06] change of raiment what is the iniquity
[1:33:09] iniquity is knowing what's right and
[1:33:10] doing what's wrong anyway it's called a
[1:33:12] transgression so God was saying
[1:33:16] Joshua was repenting take away all his
[1:33:18] iniquities and clothe him with
[1:33:21] righteousness thank you don't worry what
[1:33:25] am I saying
[1:33:25] if we come to God repenting and really
[1:33:28] repent and really love God and really
[1:33:30] for surrender all things Jesus will take
[1:33:32] away all of our iniquities and we'll
[1:33:35] know they're gone how many know how many
[1:33:37] know there's some iniquities you used to
[1:33:39] do but you know they're gone now
[1:33:40] anybody say been to that today Lori
[1:33:44] thank you Jesus
[1:33:46] amen he said take I'm gonna cause your
[1:33:49] iniquity to pass away and I'm gonna
[1:33:51] close you in righteousness it's not
[1:33:53] gonna say give me that righteousness let
[1:33:55] me try that it's you the best thing it
[1:33:57] and letting Christ say okay take it away
[1:33:59] he's worthy the only way to be worthy is
[1:34:04] to meet God's requirements remember god
[1:34:07] I've got a joven set this man is perfect
[1:34:09] why oh because all he did was sacrifice
[1:34:12] animals that was all God required in
[1:34:14] that day offer sacrifices offer
[1:34:16] sacrifices that God looked out and said
[1:34:18] he's perfect and the same thing today
[1:34:24] cause if you have enough Sun all the
[1:34:25] other dude is offering the sacrifice of
[1:34:28] repentance offer the sacrifice of praise
[1:34:30] give our lives as an offering for Jesus
[1:34:32] Christ
[1:34:33] make yourselves a living sacrifice and
[1:34:35] God look down no matter what your
[1:34:37] struggles are you look down and he'll
[1:34:39] know that you're serving your whole life
[1:34:40] it'll say Anna Rico is perfect they met
[1:34:42] I was like Jesse Smith is perfect by the
[1:34:45] blood of Christ amen but he's the one
[1:34:49] Christ is the one who must say you're
[1:34:51] worthy
[1:34:52] that's the only way we can be where you
[1:34:55] meet is humble and member simple
[1:34:58] requirements the Bible said the way of
[1:35:00] holiness is so
[1:35:01] a fool won't miss it it's so simple to
[1:35:05] keep the Word of God and let me say this
[1:35:11] my last thing or is there another idea
[1:35:16] other than job is the pass over of the
[1:35:18] death age I remember that from the sexes
[1:35:20] chapter 12
[1:35:22] how will the death angel pass over you
[1:35:25] and I today if the blood is applied all
[1:35:29] you have to do is to meet the
[1:35:30] requirements all I had to do is kill and
[1:35:33] take that catch that blood in the bowl
[1:35:35] and put it on their house all you got to
[1:35:38] do is recognize that Jesus was killed
[1:35:40] for you right confess and get rid of all
[1:35:43] the love of the world and let him put
[1:35:44] his blood all over yourself
[1:35:46] I thought you have to do lay here until
[1:35:49] he puts his blood on your soul so you
[1:35:51] don't want nothing more to do with the
[1:35:53] world that's all you have to do is
[1:35:54] follow with the one who died for you
[1:35:56] amen
[1:35:57] that's all you have to do and then
[1:35:59] you've passed from death unto life and
[1:36:01] now you're excited you're worthy not
[1:36:06] because of anything else but yes you've
[1:36:08] met my requirements and they're so
[1:36:10] simple
[1:36:10] who won't miss it it's the same thing we
[1:36:13] meet God's requirements and he makes us
[1:36:16] worthy and the reason unless unless
[1:36:22] thing the reason that he does this the
[1:36:29] reason he can say you're worthy is
[1:36:30] because remember he said you were chosen
[1:36:32] in Christ before the foundation anyone
[1:36:36] so now I am zooming back out for that
[1:36:38] now I happen to be back out to the
[1:36:39] sovereignty of God the reason he
[1:36:43] ultimately could call you worthy it's
[1:36:44] because he foreknew you because you were
[1:36:46] in his mind and you were part of him you
[1:36:52] know God said a mother can forsake her
[1:36:55] sucking baby
[1:36:56] remember that scripture said that a
[1:36:59] mother could actually forsake and leave
[1:37:01] her baby and forget about it they do it
[1:37:03] all the time because washing clanks are
[1:37:05] they gonna adoption inductions million
[1:37:08] times better and that's good I'm glad
[1:37:10] they adopted let the baby be adopted but
[1:37:13] if a mother
[1:37:13] God said a mother can be
[1:37:15] baby said but I can never forget you so
[1:37:19] God's unity to his people God's unity to
[1:37:22] us is white it's so special it's greater
[1:37:26] than even a mother to child that's why
[1:37:30] he can call you worthy because really
[1:37:32] you're a part of him amen
[1:37:35] let's bow our heads and word of Prayer
[1:37:38] heavenly father we're thankful for the
[1:37:41] word we've heard tonight Lord God when I
[1:37:45] read these scriptures I was so stirred
[1:37:47] up because you plainly lay out what we
[1:37:51] must do to meet your requirements to be
[1:37:54] called worthy ultimately we know Lord
[1:37:57] all of those who keep those requirements
[1:37:58] were already known in your mind were
[1:38:00] chosen in Christ but Lord here on earth
[1:38:02] we don't have that knowledge necessarily
[1:38:04] of what happened and and exactly what
[1:38:08] took place before the foundational world
[1:38:10] so Laura down here we have to work out
[1:38:12] our own salvation with fear and
[1:38:15] trembling help us the fear and help us
[1:38:18] to tremble to work we're gonna help us
[1:38:21] Heavenly Father we want to be on the
[1:38:23] worthy side there's only two areas to be
[1:38:25] found either were worthy and in honor
[1:38:28] you and we and we love you and then you
[1:38:30] will walk with you and you off with us
[1:38:32] or we'll be unworthy of the gospel wow
[1:38:36] that we want to be worthy to God we want
[1:38:39] to be worthy of this glorious gospel
[1:38:41] Lord God we thank you Lord for the Word
[1:38:47] of God and thank you for the songs we've
[1:38:48] heard Lord Jesus father if there's any
[1:38:52] other needs I hear you meet them Lord
[1:38:53] God and I prayed that people would go
[1:38:55] Lord to their homes tonight worshiping
[1:38:57] you Lord God loving you and rejoicing
[1:39:00] that we can be worthy to suffer for me
[1:39:04] we can be worthy and you'll call us
[1:39:08] worthy because God says I'm worthy God
[1:39:12] is the one who says I'm righteous not
[1:39:14] because of necessarily what I've done
[1:39:16] I've just humbled myself to His
[1:39:19] commandments and then the worthy one
[1:39:21] judges me as worthy what a beautiful
[1:39:24] picture we have mode tonight of the
[1:39:28] worthy judge calling
[1:39:29] us the worthy ones we thank the Lord for
[1:39:32] the word that we've heard help us to
[1:39:34] search our hearts and souls here tonight
[1:39:36] for a few minutes because we want to
[1:39:38] love you we want to see you Lord and we
[1:39:40] want you to walk with us Lord God it
[1:39:43] would be such a privilege if we could
[1:39:45] walk with you Lord in the Millennium and
[1:39:48] the future home Lord come you're only
[1:39:51] going to walk with the worthy ones and
[1:39:54] so we must walk with you now if we want
[1:39:58] to walk with you then thank you lord
[1:40:01] help us to watch our walk in Jesus

[1:50:58] we're going to be clothed with your
[1:51:00] righteousness Norden so I prayed for
[1:51:03] anyone in the range of my hearing
[1:51:06] whether here or on the livestream father
[1:51:09] if they haven't come yet to the wedding
[1:51:12] and accepted this invitation I pray
[1:51:14] they'll accept it in Jesus name and come
[1:51:16] to the house of God and then I pray for
[1:51:19] those who are here and don't have their
[1:51:20] garments on I pray they'd walk worthy
[1:51:24] and get the garment off just as Saint
[1:51:26] Paul prayed two thousand years ago for
[1:51:28] Thessalonica and so we pray always that
[1:51:31] they'll walk worthy of the vocation in
[1:51:34] which they're called orders you don't
[1:51:38] Sunday night remind my family and I
[1:51:40] remind all of us in the church to pray
[1:51:42] for others that they walk worthy of this
[1:51:46] vocation they would live a life that
[1:51:49] honors you Lord Jesus
[1:51:55] they would honor you Lord Jesus above
[1:51:58] their family above children and they
[1:52:04] would take up a cross and follow you
[1:52:07] daily what I believe personally Lord my
[1:52:10] whole revelation of myself I believe
[1:52:12] I've taken up my cross there's times
[1:52:14] it's very heavy

[1:52:29] heavy but you were right there to help
[1:52:32] them dear God you were faithful to help
