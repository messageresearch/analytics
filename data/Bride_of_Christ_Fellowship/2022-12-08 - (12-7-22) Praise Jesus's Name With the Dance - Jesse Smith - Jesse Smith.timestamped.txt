[10:15] pretty soon and
[10:17] just get a wave of birthdays here praise
[10:19] God so thankful for God's grace let's
[10:22] take a few announcements here Lord
[10:24] willing by Brother Nathanael both
[10:26] services on Sunday by God's grace
[10:28] looking forward to that just come
[10:29] expecting pulling on the word of God and
[10:32] ask the Lord to speak to us
[10:34] by God's grace
[10:36] and then Sunday after that in the 3M 3
[10:39] P.M service brother amen is going to
[10:41] preach for us by God's grace so looking
[10:42] forward to that as he feels the light of
[10:44] the Lord you know so look forward to
[10:46] that buddy by God's grace
[10:47] so those are the next events I think the
[10:50] Sunday after that then we'll try to do
[10:52] our dance service by God's grace so I
[10:55] just want to put it on the schedule you
[10:56] know I got uh
[10:58] I have a I made a new friend this week
[11:01] who called me lives in Washington and
[11:02] he's like I heard you want to do a dance
[11:04] service he said I wish I could be a part
[11:06] of that
[11:07] and uh I'm like well yeah we've never
[11:09] done one before I'm researching a dance
[11:11] you know I was a research in Jewish
[11:12] dances and things and I said I don't
[11:14] know if I'll put it out there on the
[11:15] live stream yet I'm not sure if I'm
[11:17] brave enough to do that
[11:20] I said I surely can't dance I don't have
[11:22] any
[11:23] Rhythm you might say
[11:25] but as long as I'm joyful that's all
[11:27] that matters you know
[11:29] so uh I'll try to schedule that in then
[11:32] for uh
[11:34] it would be December 25th oh wait okay
[11:38] Christmas well we could make Christmas a
[11:41] dance service
[11:42] so let's just see about that we'll see
[11:44] about that by God's grace
[11:47] it's only one service anyway that day so
[11:51] we could try that I know in Ghana from
[11:53] what brother Williams says they dance
[11:54] every service at least from is that
[11:56] right sister but okay so
[11:58] they have a dance service every service
[12:00] so
[12:01] I guess we could do a Christmas dance
[12:04] service so
[12:06] you know the Bible said there's a time
[12:07] to dance praise God there's a time to
[12:09] mourn
[12:10] uh so it's a blessing praise God let's
[12:14] take a few prayer requests then here
[12:15] tonight
[12:17] if you just pray for me I've had a
[12:18] little sore throat all week my wife says
[12:20] I'm probably not sleeping enough that's
[12:21] probably right
[12:22] I've been taking as much spray and
[12:25] cough drops and gargling as much as I
[12:28] can I just kind of need God's grace here
[12:34] is it okay well I'll rebuke that in
[12:37] Jesus name by God's grace
[12:41] yeah we had a friend who had that last
[12:44] week and they missed school they never
[12:45] came into school but we had a friend a
[12:47] teacher friend
[12:50] um yeah I definitely reviewed that in
[12:52] Jesus name okay that's great by his
[12:54] grace
[12:57] happy news a couple uh good news uh Gene
[13:00] my mother-in-law's husband had his first
[13:03] cancer treatment today went really good
[13:05] so we thank you for your prayers
[13:07] I think he's got two more if I'm not
[13:08] mistaken or three more okay
[13:10] and then trust that he'll be cancer free
[13:13] also my brother cam his wife Julia had
[13:16] the baby girl today they don't have a
[13:18] name yet but we can thank the Lord for
[13:19] that praise God
[13:22] so the uh
[13:24] the sister Brielle has been wanting
[13:26] she's finally got it
[13:27] she had to wait a few extra years I'm
[13:29] sure was worth the wait I'm sure
[13:31] by God's grace so very thankful cam just
[13:33] sent me the pictures on the drive to
[13:34] church and Malik I was driving so I got
[13:36] to say oh what a precious baby
[13:39] I'm very happy for for the Cameron
[13:41] sister Julia
[13:42] there's a couple sad things though um I
[13:45] have a a friend I see at Giant Eagle
[13:47] every day or some days and
[13:49] he's in his 60s and his 41 year old son
[13:52] committed suicide this week so
[13:55] they're Catholic Malachi met him not
[13:57] long ago and
[13:59] he was in tears today you know he's
[14:01] trying to he's the greeter and he's
[14:02] always so happy and but he wasn't happy
[14:04] today you know and I started crying too
[14:06] talking to him
[14:08] he said will you pray for my son I
[14:09] didn't say anything because he's
[14:10] catholicated I can't pray for a son
[14:13] but I can pray for the family we can
[14:14] pray for the family
[14:16] um
[14:18] you know I went in cases like that I
[14:19] just say it's up to God I don't I don't
[14:21] condemn people to hell I mean usually
[14:23] the way a tree leans that's the way it
[14:25] falls you know
[14:27] but God God will be God will be fair and
[14:30] he will judge the right way that's we
[14:31] have confidence in that
[14:33] um
[14:34] but those are heartbreaking moments
[14:37] he's been a drug addict for years but
[14:39] let's remember his name his name's Al
[14:41] and he said his wife has really taken it
[14:43] hard
[14:44] three boys now they only have two boys
[14:46] and of course they have a few
[14:47] grandchildren and everything
[14:49] but this man was single he didn't have a
[14:51] he didn't have any kids or anything like
[14:53] that
[14:54] just been a drug addict his whole life
[14:57] also brother Simon and Beth Simon's dog
[15:01] passed away today and Simon really loves
[15:03] that dog
[15:04] he chairs ice cream with that dog that's
[15:06] how much he loves that dog so
[15:08] I'm sure he's crying and he's hurting
[15:10] here tonight let's remember brother
[15:12] Simon in prayer
[15:14] by God's grace
[15:16] anybody else have any other
[15:18] what's that oh yeah yeah I'm sorry I
[15:21] said her at the beginning you haven't
[15:22] prayed for bed too that's where they're
[15:23] really close to that dog there brother
[15:24] Chris you have a request brother
[15:32] do you know what he's got or what he's
[15:34] battling
[15:36] okay
[15:38] is it stage four
[15:44] I'm sure that's understandable
[15:47] paper
[16:00] yeah
[16:02] yeah in my experience brother if you
[16:04] don't have a thus saith the Lord is
[16:05] going to be healed I would prepare that
[16:06] he's going to pass
[16:08] and then try to witness to him about the
[16:10] Lord you know you know ask him this
[16:12] question like I was the man on a
[16:13] deathbed I recorded I got the recording
[16:14] too
[16:15] I said are you trusting in Jesus Christ
[16:16] to be saved
[16:18] and he said yes and you know that was a
[16:20] couple days before he passed away so
[16:22] Jesus said If you deny me before men
[16:25] I'll deny you before the Holy Angels but
[16:26] if you recognize me before men I'll
[16:29] recognize you
[16:31] so if you need me to come talk to your
[16:33] grandpa let me know you know we can talk
[16:34] about that but we'll definitely pray for
[16:35] him
[16:36] by the grace of God
[16:39] anyone else have a request here says
[16:41] relina yes amen we're starting to pray
[16:43] for that
[16:51] when I was all in nature
[16:53] okay yeah we'll graphically pray for
[16:55] that by the grace of the Lord
[16:59] Hallelujah
[17:01] anybody else uh Haven yeah
[17:04] pardon me oh you have to remember those
[17:06] six Miracles yes thanks sir
[17:10] yeah a couple weeks ago I was up here
[17:11] Weeping at the altar praying for those
[17:13] and just asking you know Lord I don't
[17:15] know why you know I don't know why
[17:17] you know some people don't get the
[17:19] Miracles you know I don't understand
[17:20] that
[17:22] but I can pray
[17:24] I can pray to the walls come down by
[17:25] God's grace
[17:27] you know you just your heart goes out to
[17:28] people who hurt
[17:30] physically hurting
[17:33] um and I just wish I could do the
[17:34] miracle
[17:36] but I'll never be able to do one only
[17:38] Jesus could do it in other words I wish
[17:39] I could ease their pain out I'm sure you
[17:41] feel the same way
[17:43] so let's remember them in prayer I
[17:45] appreciate that to him by God's grace
[17:47] it's powerheads here for word of prayer

[25:25] and his praise in the congregation of

[25:32] let the children of Zion be joyful in
[25:35] their King Hallelujah let's read verse
[25:36] three together ready one two three let
[25:39] them praise His name in The Dance Let
[25:42] Them sing praises unto him with the
[25:45] timbrel and the Heart praise God may God
[25:47] has blessings are reading of his word
[25:48] you may be seated praise God
[25:57] all right so we'd like to uh I got some
[25:59] scriptures to show
[26:01] by God's grace I'd like to begin looking
[26:04] at this here tonight
[26:06] pulling up a few notes that I had here
[26:11] it was kind of like a
[26:13] last minute thing I just started
[26:15] studying it uh
[26:17] I'm not mistaken yesterday if I'm not
[26:19] mistaken you know so sometimes you got
[26:20] the thoughts well in advance sometimes
[26:23] you're uh
[26:25] you're just studying up with you're
[26:26] studying at the last minute by God's
[26:28] grace good to see you brother Ray God
[26:29] bless you sir Hallelujah
[26:32] so uh
[26:34] you know I was thinking about dance and
[26:36] uh how many times I've danced around the
[26:38] church and how I love it and we talked
[26:39] about having a dance service and I saw I
[26:41] thought well I want to study on that I
[26:42] want to get a good understanding on that
[26:44] by the scripture so I like to begin
[26:46] looking at that maybe this will be a two
[26:48] or three part series you know the fear
[26:49] of the Lord would I could do a couple
[26:50] more on that you know because there's
[26:53] more verses on the fearing the Lord but
[26:56] I'd like to look at this here tonight
[26:58] and Trust to be a blessing to you
[27:01] you know the uh the Hebrew word for
[27:03] dance has a couple of different words
[27:05] and eventually when you get back to the
[27:07] root word
[27:08] it's the word uh I don't know how to say
[27:11] it it's chol c-h-u-l
[27:14] or I guess another maybe it's cool or
[27:17] can you kahil not sure exactly
[27:20] what is it cool
[27:22] I can't say I'm not Hebrew I know our
[27:26] brother studied it so
[27:28] um It's A Primitive route and it says
[27:30] it's to it means to properly twist or
[27:33] whirl in a circular or spiral pattern
[27:39] twisting or whirling in a spiral pattern
[27:42] that is to dance
[27:45] specifically to dance
[27:47] some of the words mean shake or tremble
[27:51] but the main part there at least in the
[27:53] top of the definition means to so whirl
[27:56] so think about that you know how we I
[27:58] looked all around I found no one you
[27:59] know that's it
[28:01] we've got to dance around the church you
[28:02] know times and that's a good thing to do
[28:04] by God's grace
[28:06] if we should dance for anybody should be
[28:07] for Jesus praise God that's why my title
[28:10] was praise Jesus's name in the dance
[28:13] because the Old Testament just has
[28:14] praised his name we don't speak enough
[28:16] Yahweh you know you know speaking of
[28:18] Jehovah but Jesus Christ is Jehovah the
[28:21] Old Testament right Jehovah the Old
[28:22] Testament is Jesus Christ of the new
[28:24] and so
[28:26] we know God created All Things by Jesus
[28:28] Christ Hallelujah
[28:30] and we know in the beginning was the
[28:31] word the word was with God the Word was
[28:33] God hallelujah so Jesus Christ is the
[28:35] word of God praise God
[28:37] and so we just want to look at this
[28:39] thought here I got lots of slides here
[28:42] so actually I'm going to skip a little
[28:44] bit
[28:45] well I guess you know yeah I guess I'll
[28:46] just start right here then we'll just
[28:48] get to the verses you know as you
[28:49] probably read before heard brother
[28:50] Brandon said dance means victory
[28:53] or in the Hebrew uh
[28:56] I'm sorry for what I read in the the
[28:57] dictionaries another word is re
[28:59] rejoicing
[29:00] dance means to Rejoice you when you
[29:03] rejoice you dance I know when brother
[29:05] Austin got his uh bills debts paid off I
[29:08] dance around the church for that I told
[29:10] the Lord I said Lord if you pay off all
[29:12] his debts I'll dance around the church
[29:14] I made a vow with the Lord hallelujah
[29:18] um other times I dance you know and I
[29:19] think amen some with amen's job I danced
[29:22] around the church for that I don't
[29:23] remember what it was I don't know if it
[29:24] was when you be able you were able to
[29:26] come all day or every Sunday that might
[29:27] have been it this is a couple years ago
[29:29] now I'm going back a long time here but
[29:32] uh that's the whole thing you know
[29:34] that's why you dance you're dancing
[29:35] because you're rejoicing you're thankful
[29:38] to God you're joyful
[29:40] and uh dancing is Victory what brother
[29:42] Adam says and of course this is 1950 but
[29:44] still applies to today
[29:47] he said there Israel was called out a
[29:49] type of the church Israel always was a
[29:51] type of the church that church was
[29:53] natural and the church is spiritual
[29:55] today they was called out as soon as
[29:57] they were called out they passed through
[29:58] the Red Sea baptized into Moses and as
[30:01] soon as they come on the other side they
[30:03] were baptized with the spirit now I made
[30:04] that in blue because we see brother
[30:06] Ram's growth in his terminology for the
[30:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[30:11] right because later Brothers going to
[30:13] tell us they weren't born again in type
[30:15] at the Red Sea they didn't get born
[30:18] again in type until canaan's land
[30:21] so see how brother Ram grew in his
[30:23] Revelation everybody see that
[30:24] Miriam picked up a tambourine and down
[30:26] the bank she went dancing Hallelujah yes
[30:29] sir she had the victory
[30:31] did you ever get that much
[30:33] and the church said
[30:36] did you ever get that much Victory
[30:37] praise God see I think it's just
[30:39] beautiful how brother man brings it out
[30:41] like that all right she was dancing in
[30:43] the spirit and all the daughters of
[30:44] Israel followed her dancing
[30:46] Moses did with his hands up and sang in
[30:48] the spirit praise God hallelujah now
[30:51] just so you know later on you know
[30:52] here's finishing the quote why they laid
[30:54] all those taskmasters laying behind them
[30:56] and all the things they ever done the
[30:58] meanest they and the things you've done
[31:01] when you see the red blood of Jesus
[31:03] Christ is cleanse you from all your sins
[31:05] you can sing too with a Victorious song
[31:08] Hallelujah Amazing Grace how sweet this
[31:10] out that saved a wrets like me
[31:12] Hallelujah so brother Ram you know he
[31:15] uses it the natural type to the
[31:17] spiritual in the natural their natural
[31:19] taskmasters was gone when the spiritual
[31:22] all of our sins are in the sea of
[31:25] forgetfulness
[31:27] and the spiritual our past is gone our
[31:31] past doesn't have to haunt us
[31:33] hallelujah amen all the records of the
[31:37] past sins is all gone praise God
[31:39] if you've confessed your sins Jesus
[31:41] forgives it the Bible said he forgives
[31:43] us of all transgressions
[31:46] Hallelujah can't let Satan bring those
[31:48] taskmasters back
[31:50] they are drowned they're no more
[31:54] praise God yes we have current sins we
[31:56] have to confess and no doubt future sins
[31:58] of time goes on but anything from the
[32:00] past when you're a Christian it's been
[32:02] forgiven you praise God
[32:04] Hallelujah now if there's something from
[32:06] the past that comes back and you feel
[32:08] like you need to make it right well go
[32:09] make it right praise God but the guilt
[32:12] of it or the punishment for it has
[32:14] already been taken care of praise God
[32:17] he was wounded for your woundings that
[32:19] you deserve praise God
[32:22] the punishment for your past sin was
[32:24] paid for
[32:26] and if there's anything that you can
[32:28] undo yes try to undo it
[32:31] like I've told you I used to steal from
[32:33] my mom I gave her hundreds if not you
[32:34] know a couple thousand dollars you know
[32:37] over these years
[32:38] to try to make it right until I felt
[32:41] peace like okay that's probably good
[32:42] enough
[32:44] like I told you the last time I went
[32:45] into the the bank and they let me do
[32:47] something and I should not have done
[32:48] they let me deposit money in her account
[32:50] without her knowing
[32:52] that was probably breaking some law but
[32:54] hopefully the cops don't hear this
[32:57] they'll come arrest me and they'll show
[32:59] me take me out to jail for give my mom
[33:01] money
[33:03] all right I'm guilty
[33:06] I wonder what my bond will be
[33:08] but you know you you do that and uh if
[33:12] there's things you made wrong you know
[33:14] you go back and make it right I mean I
[33:16] had numerous friends in high school I
[33:17] said I said hateful I really said
[33:19] hateful things to them and when I became
[33:21] a Christian I went back and said you
[33:22] know what I'm very sorry I said I hated
[33:23] this about you in high school I'm very
[33:25] sorry and they're like oh brother Jess
[33:27] and they call me brother Justin oh Jess
[33:29] you know
[33:30] but I said no it's something I had to do
[33:34] some of you know my cousin Matt I said
[33:36] some of the office things that my cousin
[33:38] Matt when I was a young boy
[33:41] but at a football game at one of Paul's
[33:43] football games years ago I went and I
[33:45] said can I talk to you down here and we
[33:47] left the stands and I went down there
[33:49] and I said you know what Matt I'm so
[33:50] sorry I said that to you
[33:52] I said forgive me I started crying and
[33:55] now before that he was really kind of
[33:57] cold shoulder to me and now you've seen
[33:58] how he treats me
[34:00] I'll be like Matt I love you he's like I
[34:03] love you more
[34:05] foreign
[34:06] ever since I confessed that sin to him
[34:09] he has loved me with like amazing love
[34:12] I guess as much as a sinner can love you
[34:14] you know
[34:15] um so I just want to tell you know there
[34:16] are things if you did some really awful
[34:18] things and you get a chance make it
[34:20] right
[34:21] but you never have to pay for that sin
[34:23] because that's why Christ died for you
[34:27] so you gotta we have to find that
[34:29] balance that's what Zacchaeus did he
[34:30] made his wrongs right he said if I stole
[34:32] from anybody I'll give him four times
[34:34] the amount I stole from them
[34:36] so hopefully I'll reach that amount if
[34:38] not after sneaking in the bank sometime
[34:39] again and do that
[34:43] so just so you know brother Brown later
[34:45] would say this is 10 years later
[34:46] justification was leaving Egypt they
[34:48] crossed the Red Sea right they killed
[34:50] the things behind them the test Masters
[34:52] which was sanctification through the
[34:54] blood that kills all the human desires
[34:55] of evil second stage of the journey
[34:58] okay so now even changes later he said
[35:00] the second stage was the wilderness
[35:03] so in later quotes brother Brown says
[35:05] you know coming out of Egypt and then
[35:06] Crossing Jordan was was step one
[35:09] justification
[35:10] Wilderness with sanctification and then
[35:12] Crossing Jordan was the baptism of the
[35:14] Holy Ghost so I just want you to see how
[35:15] brother M Gruen is understanding but the
[35:17] main point is dance is Victory
[35:20] now you may remember this story I'm not
[35:21] going to read all this but
[35:23] there was a time when brother Ram saw
[35:24] people dancing in the church and he said
[35:26] that's horrible now look church he
[35:28] didn't blast him the Holy Ghost because
[35:29] he didn't understand it yet
[35:31] right
[35:34] he said oh my that's terrible people
[35:36] dancing
[35:37] and then one night he was having a
[35:38] meeting a New Year's Eve service
[35:41] and I want you to notice and you'll
[35:43] probably be thankful
[35:45] he preached four and a half hours
[35:49] I'm still waiting for my turn
[35:51] maybe this New Year's Eve
[35:55] straight
[35:57] straight
[35:58] two and a half is the longest ever
[35:59] preached down there in Guyana because
[36:01] they just kept pulling I almost died
[36:02] after the service I felt like I'd fasted
[36:05] all day I still got the recording of it
[36:07] I I was listening to it the other day
[36:08] two and a half hours
[36:11] um
[36:14] some ladies come up and want to beat on
[36:16] some little tin cans and things so look
[36:20] at the instruments they had we're pretty
[36:22] blessed to have the instruments we got
[36:25] on a washboard I guess you've seen the
[36:27] hookup one was playing the piano they
[36:29] started playing song there's gonna be
[36:30] that meeting in the air right that sweet
[36:32] sweet bye and bye the little lady turned
[36:34] real wide around the mouth and began to
[36:36] beat the piano
[36:37] I'm not sure how that looks man
[36:41] she said I believe if there have been
[36:42] three decks of keys she would have
[36:44] played them every one so her hands
[36:45] otherwise her hands are going like this
[36:46] me okay
[36:48] I never seen such a plane in my life
[36:49] that lady on the washboard hitting them
[36:51] with the Thimbles a thimble okay now
[36:52] thimble on a metal washboard
[36:57] I never seen such
[36:59] blonde headed sister about so high
[37:01] jumped out in the floor and started
[37:03] dancing and I was sitting there in my
[37:05] Tabernacle I thought oh my here it is I
[37:07] thought now
[37:08] why'd they have to do that
[37:13] so I waited looked around and they
[37:14] looked up at me imagine everybody looked
[37:16] up at the pastor what are you going to
[37:17] do about that Pastor
[37:19] just like you do sometimes Brothers what
[37:21] are you gonna say about that
[37:24] wow we couldn't wait to say something
[37:27] I thought oh I'm a fundamentalist you
[37:28] couldn't show me that in the Bible
[37:33] and he says where did Dancing ever come
[37:35] from
[37:36] he was sitting in the seat of the
[37:38] scornful look at that he was in the seat
[37:39] of McCall
[37:42] he was scornful why do they dance why do
[37:44] they got to dance like that
[37:46] he said
[37:48] he said I was afraid to say anything
[37:50] because I was afraid they might be right
[37:51] and me wrong look at that there's the
[37:53] Holy Spirit right there
[37:54] see sometimes God will keep you from
[37:56] saying things
[37:57] because you're a child of God
[38:00] and God wants to spare you from a little
[38:01] shame and I'll say Amen to that God
[38:04] spared me from things I've said before
[38:05] I've said them
[38:07] and I thought isn't that terrible right
[38:09] right in here in my tap look my
[38:11] Tabernacle later God sent him out and
[38:13] said it's not your Tabernacle
[38:15] right
[38:17] he said this lady up there her eyes
[38:19] closed just dancing around first thing
[38:20] you know got another one started I
[38:22] thought oh my I began to rehearse in my
[38:24] mind in in that Bible they did dance I
[38:26] thought when they danced what was it
[38:28] Pharaoh was pursuing Israel the enemy
[38:30] was drowned Miriam picked up a
[38:32] tambourine and began to dance and all
[38:34] the daughters followed her dancing I
[38:36] thought well there they had the victory
[38:38] and I read in David when the ark had
[38:40] been away so long and when he returned
[38:42] back why he was so happy started dancing
[38:44] he had the victory his sweetheart made
[38:46] fun of him kind of laughed at him
[38:49] he said well if you don't like that
[38:51] watch this
[38:52] and down there he went round and around
[38:54] he went again I thought well she set up
[38:57] there and laughed at him and God put a
[38:58] curse on her and thought David thou art
[39:01] a man after my own heart
[39:03] well I thought the only thing is the
[39:05] matter with me I just got I just ain't
[39:07] got enough Victory Maybe
[39:09] in a few minutes something happened now
[39:11] this might shock you when I come to
[39:12] myself I was out there with that little
[39:14] girl dancing on the floor
[39:17] that's right just the thing I thought I
[39:19] wouldn't do I did now church that's what
[39:21] the Holy Ghost does to you sometimes
[39:23] you will do the things you never thought
[39:25] you'd do
[39:26] yeah I never thought I'd preach I never
[39:28] thought I'd dance in church I never
[39:29] thought I'd scream or shout or cry or
[39:31] weep or I never thought I'd do any of
[39:33] that but the Holy Ghost makes you do
[39:34] things you won't think you'll do
[39:38] amen
[39:39] brother says sometimes God will do it to
[39:41] you to Humble you
[39:43] to get all the starch out of you
[39:45] as I told the brother on the phone today
[39:47] around Washington I'm like I don't even
[39:48] care at this point I hardly care what
[39:49] anybody thinks anymore right right
[39:51] because if they don't think I'm a
[39:52] fanatic by now then I don't know they
[39:54] must actually be a real saint
[39:56] most people probably think I'm a fanatic
[39:57] that's okay I probably am amen I'm a
[40:00] fanatic for Jesus praise God
[40:02] and I like it that way praise God I
[40:04] don't want to be a chained up fearful
[40:06] scared
[40:08] uh
[40:09] prisoner of the world Amen I want to be
[40:12] God's free man Hallelujah
[40:14] thank you Jesus amen I spent the first
[40:17] 19 years of my life in in Chains
[40:19] I spent the first 19 years of life and
[40:21] the change of sin in the church and
[40:23] didn't like church didn't like going to
[40:24] church and when I became saved and when
[40:27] I became I couldn't wait to raise my
[40:28] hands and then this was as far as I
[40:30] could raise him when I got saved I look
[40:31] around and say who's raising anyone's
[40:33] raising their hands if not I'll put them
[40:35] down
[40:36] but you better believe I wanted to raise
[40:37] them then when I came to message yeah
[40:40] now I finally got some Freedom
[40:42] Hallelujah
[40:43] thank God Amen I could raise and shout
[40:47] and cry and rejoice and leave with the
[40:49] best of them praise God I think about
[40:51] that mishawashi Mr Walker preacher how
[40:53] he he jumped up and clicked his heels
[40:55] like that you know
[40:57] he's old man he said you ain't got
[40:59] enough room for me to preach up here
[41:01] that's about our church right we already
[41:03] got enough room for me to preach up here
[41:06] I almost pulled a muscle on that jump
[41:07] there I got to start stretching out
[41:09] before I jump around here
[41:11] getting older now
[41:13] but that's what the Holy Spirit does
[41:15] Church it makes us do things we wouldn't
[41:17] think we do
[41:18] because it's not about our desires it's
[41:21] about God's glory praise God
[41:27] just the thing I thought I'd never do
[41:30] I was never on a dance floor in my life
[41:31] but I guess I did it all right
[41:34] I sure about awful good I had a lot of
[41:38] Victory after that and brother Jeff said
[41:40] amen
[41:42] Hallelujah
[41:44] and George that's what I you know I
[41:46] danced a few weeks ago around here I was
[41:47] having a good old time sometimes when
[41:48] that music just gets going I just I just
[41:50] got to move I I got to give God some
[41:52] glory amen and the next day I'll notice
[41:54] it's easy to read my Bible it's easier
[41:56] to pray it's easier to get up I've
[41:59] noticed that church and if you haven't
[42:00] done it bro I mean I've said have you
[42:02] done it yet
[42:04] have you done have you tried it yet
[42:06] praise God that's what Ram said have you
[42:08] ever felt like that where you're so free
[42:10] and you got all the Victory church if
[42:12] not make a vow with God say God if you
[42:14] do this I'll dance around the church for
[42:16] you
[42:16] that's what I've done I've done that a
[42:18] couple times with Austin like I said
[42:19] with brother amen and other times I Just
[42:21] Dance because I feel good I feel like
[42:22] dancing I'm good I'm good I'm in good
[42:24] health I dance at the school why can't I
[42:26] dance at the church
[42:28] we dance for Jesus in my classroom
[42:30] praise God I've done that for years
[42:32] why can't I dance in God's house amen
[42:36] Hallelujah so God's in music don't You
[42:39] Believe God's music certainly God's in
[42:42] music he's an art and God's in this
[42:43] universe he's in his creatures he's in
[42:45] his church he's in his creation he's in
[42:47] the universe God's all around just
[42:48] everywhere he's here in the Shriner
[42:51] Auditorium right now this night he's
[42:52] here at bride of Christ Fellowship
[42:53] tonight
[42:54] he's right president here tonight
[42:57] God's everywhere I just wonder sometimes
[42:59] if he just take the shades off her eyes
[43:01] to our sight would be fast enough to
[43:04] catch his presence in the building
[43:07] I don't know how often brother Ram
[43:08] dances may be one of the one or a few
[43:09] times on tape that he talks about it I
[43:11] know out in the Canadian wilderness when
[43:12] he was way up there you know he heard he
[43:15] heard uh the elk cry for the he heard
[43:17] the mail elk cry for the female elk and
[43:19] then he heard the chitter chatter the
[43:21] Chipmunk was trying to discourage him
[43:23] then he saw the eagle and he said he got
[43:25] so excited he ran around the tree and
[43:26] was praising his maker you know he said
[43:29] oh he said this is where God's at God's
[43:31] in his creation amen he said he was he
[43:34] said if people would have saw me they
[43:35] would have thought I was insane that I
[43:38] just got out of an insane institution
[43:39] praise God he said he's kicking Up The
[43:42] Mulch on the ground and the leaves and
[43:44] everything just praising God oh my if
[43:47] you haven't felt like that I pray you'll
[43:49] feel like that sometime praise God if
[43:51] you can't do it around nobody else at
[43:52] least do it between you and God Amen
[43:55] Hallelujah that's right church that's
[43:57] right
[43:58] what is dance to twist to whirl in a
[44:01] circular spiral manner
[44:04] Hallelujah
[44:06] I'm going to skip past this I'm going to
[44:07] get to the verses yeah I'll get back to
[44:09] that later
[44:10] well maybe we'll see kind of how the
[44:12] time goes here
[44:13] 37 30 man that clock's a busy body
[44:16] uh
[44:17] let's look at just briefly dancing in
[44:19] the Bible a couple of these I didn't get
[44:20] a chance to study all the way on so I'm
[44:22] not going to read a couple of these
[44:23] but these are familiar the first mention
[44:25] of dancing in the Bible is Miriam
[44:28] dance is Victory
[44:32] and if you notice it's just the women
[44:34] dancing with the women
[44:36] and so that's where I found it good
[44:38] that's what I saw in Ghana too the Ghana
[44:40] when William sent me the videos all the
[44:42] sisters dance on one side and all the
[44:44] brothers dance on the other side
[44:46] that's a good thing to do praise God
[44:47] that's a real wise thing to do
[44:49] so Moses was singing in the spirit you
[44:51] should I mean we should read that song
[44:52] sometime maybe we don't have it all the
[44:54] time I'm just gonna hit the highlights
[44:55] tonight
[44:56] but he was singing the spirit and pretty
[44:59] soon Miriam gets out there gets out the
[45:00] tambourine and all the sisters start to
[45:02] dance and and they start answering Moses
[45:05] back
[45:06] so Moses would say the Lord is a man of
[45:08] war the Lord is a man of war and men
[45:11] would say singing to the Lord for you
[45:13] Triumph gloriously I don't know how wet
[45:15] you but you you get the picture
[45:18] it was the answer it's kind of like is
[45:20] he Worthy is all the world groaning he
[45:22] is I'm sorry is all the world groaning
[45:24] it is
[45:25] is the new creation coming it is it's an
[45:28] answer it's a call and answer song Amen
[45:30] Hallelujah
[45:34] and remember they just seen all their uh
[45:38] other task Masters they've just seen all
[45:41] their past they've just seen any threat
[45:44] Hallelujah of any future life would be
[45:47] an awful life any threat to their future
[45:49] was just washed away praise God
[45:52] they were just giving a clean bill of
[45:54] life amen hallelujah no more slavery
[45:57] I'll never be a slave again praise God
[46:00] because there ain't nobody to make me a
[46:02] slave ah Church there's nobody that can
[46:04] make you a slave tonight Jesus set you
[46:06] free Hallelujah sorry okay
[46:08] I'm gonna spit on malcast sorry about
[46:10] that buddy
[46:11] nobody can make you a Slave
[46:14] it's all done
[46:16] you just got to stay out of Egypt
[46:19] and the church said or can I say like
[46:21] this get all the Egypt out of you
[46:24] amen that's what I need to do right
[46:26] because we so we have the sin nature
[46:28] inside of us
[46:29] it's hatred against God
[46:31] see that's what the Bible says the flesh
[46:33] is enmity the flesh is hatred against
[46:35] God and sometimes our minds are too
[46:37] when we when we Harbor the wrong
[46:39] thoughts
[46:41] so Miriam got the Tam room out all the
[46:43] women followed her so see we need
[46:45] somebody to be the leader that's why I
[46:47] said Naomi and uh Beatrice are going to
[46:49] be our leaders there
[46:51] I'm just kidding you don't have to be
[46:54] I'll lead if I have to I'm the pastor
[46:59] God is good I can't dance anyway so I
[47:01] just I dance for Jesus as far as
[47:03] anything that can look like it's a real
[47:04] dancing
[47:05] but see somebody's got to catch the Holy
[47:07] Spirit Moses caught the spirit and
[47:09] started singing hallelujah amen song
[47:12] leader Hallelujah
[47:14] and then somebody's got to catch a spear
[47:15] to dance amen
[47:17] and notice everybody joined in
[47:20] all the women joined in on the dance
[47:22] Hallelujah and so that's what we want to
[47:25] have we're just free where if you feel
[47:27] led you can dance if you don't feel led
[47:29] you don't have to dance but I'll tell
[47:30] you you have a lot of Victory if you do
[47:31] dance praise God you're missing out
[47:34] just like you're missing out on a good
[47:35] shot for Jesus
[47:37] the church said
[47:40] you feel real good you shout kind of
[47:42] wakes you up Hallelujah
[47:43] you feel alive again
[47:45] you get out of that rut that you're in
[47:47] right we get sometimes we're in that rut
[47:49] oh woe is me I'm tired I've got a
[47:52] headache sore throat feeling sick we
[47:54] start talking about Jesus things change
[47:56] amen
[47:57] thank God
[48:00] Hallelujah
[48:02] it does something to you praise God it
[48:05] changes the atmosphere Hallelujah
[48:09] thank you Jesus
[48:12] now here's part of Moses song
[48:14] then saying Moses and the children of
[48:16] Israel this song unto the Lord and spake
[48:17] and saying I will sing unto you imagine
[48:20] Moses singing
[48:21] 80 year old Prophet I will sing unto the
[48:24] Lord for he hath trying gloriously the
[48:27] horse and his rider he's thrown into the
[48:30] sea you know he gets going Miriam's
[48:33] answering back and forth
[48:36] and this is the first time
[48:38] so the first time dance is mentioned in
[48:41] the Bible is the first time the word
[48:43] salvation is mentioned in the Bible
[48:45] do you think there's a connection to
[48:47] that I think so
[48:49] this wasn't written by no man this was
[48:51] written by God
[48:53] wanted to place salvation at the same
[48:55] spot as dancing the same place as all
[48:58] your enemies drowning the sea the same
[49:00] place where you are officially out of
[49:02] Egypt hallelujah thank God Amen I'm
[49:06] officially out of Egypt and nobody can
[49:08] take me back Hallelujah
[49:10] yes
[49:12] Glory thank you Jesus
[49:15] Egypt always represents the world
[49:18] Egypt is the first really civilization
[49:21] uh or the Kingdom built by man in the
[49:23] Bible
[49:24] right Tower of Babel got started but God
[49:26] stopped it but if you look at the Bible
[49:27] the first major civilization the first
[49:29] major kingdom was Egypt
[49:31] so it represents the epitome of Satan's
[49:33] kingdom but God used it as a type to
[49:36] bring Israel to show us God was going to
[49:38] bring us out of the kingdom of darkness
[49:40] Hallelujah and he was going to bring us
[49:42] into the Kingdom of Light Hallelujah
[49:45] that's the first time we see salvation
[49:47] in the Bible Moses singing the Lord has
[49:50] become my strength and my song and he
[49:53] has become my salvation
[49:56] he is my God and I will prepare him and
[50:00] habitation yeah he got he got going and
[50:03] Mary said we've got to go get the
[50:05] tamarinds out come on somebody
[50:06] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[50:11] that's the first time they danced was
[50:13] when they had the victory
[50:15] Glory
[50:16] they had forgiveness
[50:18] they had a future ah oh my the past was
[50:22] gone Hallelujah a new life
[50:26] Oh I thought I'd get more amens on that
[50:28] Hallelujah
[50:29] a new life has started a new life in
[50:31] Christ Hallelujah
[50:34] that came to pass Exodus 32. now of
[50:36] course this is sinful dancing
[50:38] Moses and Aaron come into the camp and
[50:41] the Israelites the same people that were
[50:43] dancing for Jesus are now dancing for
[50:45] the devil we see it all the time
[50:47] I don't have to be dancing but you live
[50:49] for you live in the message for a while
[50:50] then you go back out in the world
[50:52] same thing same spirit
[50:53] right the spirit of Satan
[50:57] any any uh rejoicing over idolatry right
[51:01] any any idolatry would lead to this kind
[51:03] of dancing
[51:04] they'll laugh they'll Rejoice they'll
[51:06] they'll shout they'll show all their
[51:07] emotions for the world but be cold on
[51:10] God
[51:11] that's an evil spirit of idolatry
[51:14] right
[51:17] that's why I was telling uh well I told
[51:19] the church over and over again you you
[51:21] know you watch these sinful sports games
[51:23] or you go to sinful movies and you can
[51:25] spend two and a half hours laughing and
[51:28] shouting and spending money on on the
[51:30] sinful things and you come to church and
[51:32] you're dead quiet that shows your soul
[51:34] is dead
[51:35] if you can be emotional about the things
[51:37] of the world and love them and be
[51:39] excited and clap and and jump and dance
[51:41] if you can do that for Satan and you're
[51:43] cold on God you are lost and going to
[51:45] hell
[51:46] unless you repent
[51:48] and message people do that
[51:51] I know them
[51:53] they're not message people they're
[51:55] Pretenders they're like the mixed
[51:57] multitude that's what happened a mixed
[51:58] multitude come out of the denomination
[52:00] ah but not us we're like Joshua and
[52:03] Caleb we got a different Spirit
[52:04] hallelujah amen and you know why because
[52:07] my life proves it praise God the proof
[52:10] is in the pudding the proof is in your
[52:12] life amen hallelujah I don't dance for
[52:15] the world I dance for Jesus Hallelujah
[52:18] Hallelujah
[52:19] thank you Jesus
[52:24] now this is this is a sad story I don't
[52:26] quite understand the story I don't know
[52:27] if uh Jeff and I had to sacrifice his
[52:30] daughter or she just didn't have to be
[52:31] married the rest of her life but anyways
[52:34] he come back from the battle and he was
[52:36] met with timbrose and dancing so there
[52:39] was a dancing act after a victory in
[52:41] battle see church when you come to
[52:43] Revival like amen who are talking about
[52:45] her if anybody has the victory that's a
[52:47] good time to dance
[52:48] when you're happy when you're feeling it
[52:50] that's a time to dance
[52:51] Hallelujah because you feel it praise
[52:53] God you fear the victory you feel the
[52:55] rejoicing that's the time that's how you
[52:58] should know this is my time to Rejoice
[52:59] this is my time to give God thanks
[53:01] because I know more valleys are coming
[53:03] but while I'm on the Mountaintop let me
[53:05] give him a dance Amen Let me give him a
[53:07] shout let me give him a praise because
[53:08] he's worthy he brought me up to this
[53:10] mountain amen
[53:12] I know what the valleys are like church
[53:13] right
[53:15] that's the time to give God praise after
[53:17] the victory
[53:20] Hallelujah no that's what I didn't
[53:22] understand so I made it real obvious on
[53:23] my notes like I don't understand that
[53:24] one
[53:26] um it was a case where
[53:28] uh women were dancing and they were
[53:30] caught and robbed in the days of Judges
[53:33] that's no surprise judges is like the
[53:35] most
[53:36] uh Wicked book of as far as Israel they
[53:39] had backslidden so far it's like Israel
[53:42] without Joshua I'm sorry yeah Israel
[53:43] without Joshua had become the Book of
[53:45] Judges right no prophet and it was just
[53:47] awful
[53:48] now here's the one where the women
[53:51] danced
[53:52] um and it says nothing about men dancing
[53:54] okay this after David slug Goliath
[53:57] and uh
[53:59] notice they're singing they're singing
[54:00] their women are singing dancing they're
[54:02] playing they're worshiping God see
[54:04] another great victory
[54:05] the giant fell Hallelujah church when
[54:08] the giant Falls you ought to give God
[54:10] glory
[54:11] praise God
[54:13] when the giant Falls we give God the
[54:15] glory
[54:16] but notice Saul I David from that day
[54:18] forward Saul wasn't hearing the Praises
[54:20] he wanted the Praises
[54:22] he should have just been happy his
[54:23] brother got the victory
[54:25] because his brother had the courage to
[54:26] go out there and fight him and he didn't
[54:30] right how sad is that somebody does
[54:32] something you're jealous of their you're
[54:34] jealous of their uh you didn't have the
[54:36] courage you were you were afraid to do
[54:38] it but you're jealous of them because
[54:39] they had the courage and they got the
[54:40] Victory and God bless him and you're
[54:42] jealous of them it shows it shows us we
[54:44] got to keep our eyes on Christ
[54:46] the Bible said Saul idem from that day
[54:48] forward
[54:50] if I get a chance I'm gonna do something
[54:51] bad to him let's keep our eyes on Jesus
[54:54] because if we keep him on Jesus pretty
[54:55] soon we're gonna see those nail scarred
[54:57] hands amen
[54:59] where those good to get those scars in
[55:01] the house of my friends
[55:03] and he was Scarred For You and I
[55:05] he died for our wickedness
[55:08] for our iniquities bruised for our
[55:10] iniquities
[55:12] Hallelujah
[55:14] so we see a great testimony there
[55:17] now here this is a strange thing in fear
[55:19] David acted insane when he was uh at the
[55:22] at the king akish's uh Kingdom there
[55:28] the men of akish knew the women dance
[55:30] for David's victory over Goliath but now
[55:33] he was running from Saul so the dancing
[55:35] look at this this just shows how far Our
[55:37] Testimony will go
[55:39] oh my if mountains fall
[55:42] or if mountains move in 2023 Hallelujah
[55:45] and we get some miracles in this church
[55:47] we ought to dance and it ought to spread
[55:49] a testimony to other close churches by
[55:51] God's grace
[55:53] Hallelujah because that's what happened
[55:54] in David's day they at these nearby uh
[55:57] Heathen kingdoms had heard about the
[56:00] dancing they'd heard about the shouting
[56:01] they heard about the victory amen oh God
[56:05] give us Grace until the victories come
[56:06] Hallelujah
[56:08] help us to hang on to her sometimes you
[56:10] know the victory's just right around the
[56:11] corner we may think it's never going to
[56:13] happen how can it happen and Churchill
[56:15] we just hang on and give God praise in
[56:17] the hard times how do we know the
[56:18] victory is just not coming next week or
[56:20] something praise God
[56:22] we don't know so let's let's let's let's
[56:24] be full of Faith praise God let's
[56:26] encourage ourselves in the Lord like
[56:27] David did Hallelujah
[56:33] remember David act like he was crazy to
[56:35] get out of there
[56:38] uh David is such an awesome character of
[56:41] the Bible
[56:45] here uh
[56:47] David said can't thou bring me down to
[56:49] this company and he said swear unto me
[56:50] by God that thou will neither kill me
[56:52] nor deliver me in the hands of my master
[56:54] I'll bring thee down to this company
[56:55] okay
[56:56] uh when he brought them down behold they
[56:58] were spread abroad upon all the Earth
[56:59] eating and drinking okay so this is
[57:01] after uh the enemy had come and taken
[57:04] David's spoils and his family they've
[57:06] taken all the Israelites spoils and it
[57:09] was that sick lag right and David prayed
[57:11] Lord do I go he inquired the Lord Lord
[57:13] do I go get it back and the Lord said go
[57:14] take all of it back
[57:16] and so when David finally got there all
[57:18] these heathens were rejoicing in dance
[57:20] so again showing how Sinners dance over
[57:22] their victories and the Sinners dance
[57:24] over victories what about us praise God
[57:27] you think Satan's going to get all the
[57:28] glory and we're not going to give it God
[57:29] any glory god deserves the glory praise
[57:32] God
[57:33] he deserves a good dance style every day
[57:35] every now and then praise God he
[57:36] deserves a few swirls or a few Twirls
[57:39] he's so great praise God how can you
[57:41] contain it we got to give God glory
[57:43] Hallelujah
[57:45] Hallelujah
[57:47] the Cleveland guardians or Indians do
[57:49] not deserve our praising Glory
[57:52] they haven't done nothing for me
[57:55] nothing
[57:57] and even though the Cavs won the uh the
[57:59] NBA championship in 2016 they haven't
[58:01] done nothing for me praise God I don't
[58:03] even care
[58:04] right they just getting steeper and
[58:06] deeper into sin deeper and deeper into
[58:08] wickedness
[58:10] it just gets worse and worse it's
[58:12] rotting it's decaying oh but the word of
[58:14] God is forever alive amen the word of
[58:17] God is life Hallelujah Hallelujah
[58:20] brother Adam said if the word won't give
[58:22] your life nothing will bring your life
[58:23] praise God oh
[58:26] thank God
[58:29] the preaching of the word is what brings
[58:31] life Hallelujah
[58:33] that's why Jesus said go and preach go
[58:35] and teach All Nations Hallelujah
[58:37] that's exactly right
[58:40] so David spoiled their dance party I'm
[58:42] sure he started a dance party for Israel
[58:43] as soon as they got back
[58:45] no doctors No Doubt
[58:48] here David dancer for the Lord when the
[58:50] ark was returning with all of his might
[58:54] and day was girded with the Leonard
[58:55] ephod so he put on the Priestly garments
[58:58] because David was prophet priest king
[59:01] oh Hallelujah
[59:03] so Dave and all the house of Israel
[59:05] brought up the Arkham Lord was shouting
[59:07] and with the sound of the trumpet you're
[59:09] telling me they can shout under the
[59:11] blood of bulls and goats but we can't
[59:12] shout under the blood of Jesus Christ
[59:14] I'm gonna shout amen I'm going to shout
[59:17] out of Jesus Amen
[59:19] thank God for the blood of God's son
[59:21] Hallelujah
[59:23] they can shout about the Old Testament
[59:25] what about the new
[59:28] Hallelujah
[59:30] as our Lord came in the city of David
[59:31] McCall Saul's daughter looked through a
[59:33] window the man said she said
[59:37] I saw King David leaping and dancing so
[59:39] again leaping if I stretched out enough
[59:40] here leaping for the Lord clicking the
[59:43] heels together David was leaping for the
[59:46] Lord I'd like to show the kids at school
[59:47] that jump you know they like that jump
[59:49] he wasn't just you know walking around
[59:51] and you know
[59:53] the answer he was leaving for the Lord
[59:58] not with some of his Mike Church
[1:00:00] with all of his mind

[1:05:12] Kentucky grammar
[1:05:15] right
[1:05:17] as long as the people lives right
[1:05:22] yeah there it is
[1:05:23] brother man said I know there's a lot of
[1:05:25] fanaticism this is the fourth seal
[1:05:27] people carrying on I know sometimes they
[1:05:29] do it when the music is jumping up and
[1:05:30] down and everything I know that goes
[1:05:32] I know and I believe that too and the
[1:05:35] church said
[1:05:36] brother man believes when the music
[1:05:38] going it's okay to jump up and down it's
[1:05:39] okay to rejoice
[1:05:42] he said but I've seen people in the day
[1:05:44] when as long as the music is playing
[1:05:46] everybody was jumping and screaming but
[1:05:48] when the music stopped it stopped see I
[1:05:49] believe that well that's still all right
[1:05:51] as far as I'm concerned see as long as
[1:05:54] the people lives right
[1:05:56] let me tell you church I've seen both
[1:05:58] I've seen people dance and say true to
[1:06:00] God I've seen people dance run around
[1:06:01] the church and leave the message
[1:06:03] and go back to three persons and the
[1:06:05] fathers and Holy Ghost
[1:06:07] and criticize Brother Brad I've seen
[1:06:09] both I've seen on both sides
[1:06:12] Hallelujah so what does it show I mean
[1:06:14] it shows you get anointed on the flesh
[1:06:15] which is good the thing is we need
[1:06:17] anointing on all three courts praise God
[1:06:20] that's a thing
[1:06:21] God wants to know all three parts of our
[1:06:24] body praise God of our being rather Body
[1:06:26] Spirit soul
[1:06:28] that's the thing and so when the word
[1:06:31] comes it shows who's got the anointing
[1:06:32] on the soul Glory
[1:06:36] that's right
[1:06:38] the shouting screaming dancing or
[1:06:40] whatever weeping crying that just shows
[1:06:42] the holy spirit's on the body
[1:06:43] or this in the spirit too but when the
[1:06:46] word of Correction comes who's able to
[1:06:48] receive that now we see who's got it in
[1:06:49] the soul praise God
[1:06:51] because Jesus looked at his disciple
[1:06:53] said you want to go to
[1:06:55] you guys want to go too
[1:06:58] you said Peter said those wonderful
[1:07:00] words where we go Lord thou Hast the
[1:07:02] words of eternal life

[1:07:06] Catholic Church
[1:07:08] where am I going to go back to the
[1:07:09] Pentecostal church and try to speak in
[1:07:10] tongues
[1:07:12] right which would be okay to speak in
[1:07:14] tongues like we thank God for that
[1:07:17] should I go back to the Methodist Church
[1:07:19] and try to accept the lgbq2 or QT
[1:07:22] whatever they got should I try to accept
[1:07:23] that should we go back to the Baptist
[1:07:25] and just be stiff as a board
[1:07:27] sitting staring Stern okay all right
[1:07:30] we'll go out now
[1:07:31] should I go back to that what should I
[1:07:33] do I should go back to the word praise
[1:07:36] God hallelujah and this is the word

[1:14:26] me in honor
[1:14:28] you're thinking you think they're going
[1:14:30] to despise me but really they're going
[1:14:32] to honor me see church that's how it is
[1:14:33] I mean my wife can tell you all the
[1:14:35] saints we've known the message the ones
[1:14:37] that really worship God and live the
[1:14:39] right life we give them a lot of Honor
[1:14:42] they're the most honorable people it's
[1:14:44] those stiff starchy people that don't
[1:14:45] want to worship God they probably got a
[1:14:47] closet full of like pornography or
[1:14:49] Abominations or or secret sins or
[1:14:52] something like that they don't worship
[1:14:53] God those aren't the people that get
[1:14:54] honor it's the people that are unashamed
[1:14:57] to worship Jesus Christ and give Jesus
[1:14:59] Christ all the glory those people who
[1:15:01] get anointed by the Holy Ghost they're
[1:15:03] not ashamed they let God do things in
[1:15:06] them they thought they never do and that
[1:15:08] shows God is truly in charge of them

[1:15:12] ah thank God Amen
[1:15:15] thank God
[1:15:17] I want to be one of those people that
[1:15:19] people honor because I get in the spirit

[1:15:25] me I want to I want to be there by God's
[1:15:26] grace in fact that guy I talked to on

[1:15:33] and he said I just want to tell you I'll
[1:15:35] just read it to you
[1:15:36] I'm going to chop it up or I'm going to
[1:15:37] say things that aren't in there my wife
[1:15:39] knows I can hardly tell a story and get
[1:15:41] half of it right
[1:15:43] because I'm a human man
[1:15:51] remember I was making up that song I'm
[1:15:53] going to stay in the fear of the Lord
[1:15:54] remember
[1:15:55] he said that I couldn't get that song
[1:15:57] out of my head after you sing that
[1:15:59] that's good it's either because of bad
[1:16:02] singing or it's a good song
[1:16:05] I think it was a good song
[1:16:07] it's probably bad singing too but
[1:16:13] where did he say it in here
[1:16:17] maybe it's the next one
[1:16:19] oh yeah I am fascinated quote I'm
[1:16:22] fascinated by how freely and easily you
[1:16:24] can praise the Lord now think about that
[1:16:26] I would love to be able to praise him
[1:16:28] with such gusto
[1:16:30] that's a new word I never used before
[1:16:33] and inhibition well God give me some
[1:16:34] more gusto
[1:16:37] give me some more Gusto for Jesus
[1:16:39] Hallelujah I hope he's watching now and
[1:16:41] Lord bless you sir if he's watching now
[1:16:43] God give us hearts of gusto
[1:16:46] see I like that he sees I'm not
[1:16:48] inhibited to praise God in other words

[1:17:05] here and get my conscience cleared out

[1:17:11] oh what are people going to think you
[1:17:12] can't worship God but if you don't care
[1:17:14] what people think if you can imagine
[1:17:16] that the angels are watching you worship

[1:17:37] foolishness to the world right
[1:17:38] but to them who are of the faith of God

[1:18:29] the service of the Lord oh just like
[1:18:32] brothers said if you don't get anything
[1:18:33] out of service it's because you put
[1:18:35] nothing into the service
[1:18:37] if you leave here and you get nothing
[1:18:38] out it's because you put nothing in ah
[1:18:42] Hallelujah

[1:18:47] after service or go lay your hands on
[1:18:49] and pray for somebody afterwards if

[1:18:57] that's right that's right that's right

[1:19:40] everlasting life
[1:19:41] but you got a plan Church
[1:19:43] we got to plant them
[1:19:45] I've been listening to some of our
[1:19:46] sermons from 2007 brother the year after
[1:19:48] we started this church I am amazed
[1:19:51] at the loudness and the noises and the
[1:19:54] screaming the shouting and everything
[1:19:55] I'm amazed like wow our Zeo you think
[1:19:58] I'm zealous now
[1:20:00] wait do you hear that
[1:20:03] I thought I was else no I thought oh my
[1:20:05] Lord have mercy
[1:20:08] I'll share the sermons if you want
[1:20:12] [Laughter]
[1:20:13] now a lot of them had you know guest
[1:20:15] guests there you know brother Ray and
[1:20:16] brother or some other sisters and
[1:20:18] brothers
[1:20:19] oh yeah Lorraine okay yeah yeah okay
[1:20:21] yeah I was thinking about when we first
[1:20:23] started the church here in Akron but yep
[1:20:24] yep I agree
[1:20:25] no doubt about that
[1:20:28] I'm gonna play Lord willing and next
[1:20:30] time I preach maybe next Wednesday I'm
[1:20:31] going to share some of those I want you
[1:20:32] to hear
[1:20:33] because if I if I could point you back
[1:20:35] to a time where I know I was in Revival
[1:20:37] mode like
[1:20:38] the first first love Zeal I'm going to
[1:20:40] point you back to there now I'm doing
[1:20:41] everything I can now don't get wrong I'm
[1:20:43] doing everything I can now to stay
[1:20:44] within that Revival
[1:20:46] but things are different now I got eight
[1:20:47] kids now
[1:20:49] things are a little different now
[1:20:51] I'm older now
[1:20:53] I'm more feeble now
[1:20:56] but see I do everything I can to get to
[1:20:58] stay in that Revival mode
[1:21:01] because remember men have died for
[1:21:03] pushing too hard in revivals
[1:21:06] Robert Evan Roberts died early because
[1:21:08] he pushed so hard in the Welsh Revival
[1:21:10] he just physically was exhausted his
[1:21:12] body till he died
[1:21:14] people can do that
[1:21:16] that's why brother random church people
[1:21:18] criticized him he had to go out for
[1:21:19] hunting trips right and these men would
[1:21:21] pay huge money to send him overseas but
[1:21:24] he needed that rest all right all right
[1:21:25] I don't see the burned out and would
[1:21:27] have lived to 40.
[1:21:29] 45 or whatever
[1:21:37] job saw the Wicked dancing and rejoicing
[1:21:39] with instruments so again the world does
[1:21:40] it of course we know that but just just
[1:21:42] so you see it's in the Bible
[1:21:44] um
[1:21:45] I love this Psalm a Psalm at the
[1:21:47] dedication of the House of David so that
[1:21:49] was when the ark finally got to Mount
[1:21:51] Moriah right as we preached out not long
[1:21:53] ago Mount Zion series I will extol thee
[1:21:57] O Lord for thou Has Lifted Me Up and has
[1:21:58] made me or made my foes to Rejoice over
[1:22:00] me hear O Lord verse 10 and have mercy
[1:22:03] on me Lord be thou my helper thou has
[1:22:06] turned me
[1:22:07] I'm sorry that was turned for me my
[1:22:10] morning into dancing
[1:22:13] thou Hast put off my sackcloth and
[1:22:16] girded me with kindness I see church I
[1:22:19] believe I'm preaching on this for a
[1:22:20] reason praise God
[1:22:22] so if we've been mourning we got to say
[1:22:24] God bring me to a season of Dancing
[1:22:28] David couldn't have the dance unless he
[1:22:30] had the morning
[1:22:32] because he said God did this to me
[1:22:34] remember he killed Goliath everybody's
[1:22:36] dancing Hallelujah but then he started
[1:22:38] getting chasing down for 15 years or
[1:22:40] whatever 14-13
[1:22:42] that was a seasonal Mourning
[1:22:45] we don't see him dancing we see him
[1:22:46] acting like he's insane
[1:22:48] get this insane guy out of here
[1:22:51] he's got spit all over his beard get
[1:22:53] this insane where's the dance there
[1:22:55] right he's afraid for his life
[1:22:58] the mountains
[1:23:00] look at the mountain and valleys in
[1:23:01] David's life
[1:23:03] such mountains but so deep deep valleys
[1:23:08] adultery and murder
[1:23:10] his own son absolutely taking the throne
[1:23:12] from him
[1:23:14] but then there's coming to Mountain
[1:23:15] Church
[1:23:17] yeah there's coming to Mountain Church
[1:23:19] I'm saying something
[1:23:21] their season you have to in order to
[1:23:23] really dance you have to understand what
[1:23:24] it's like to mourn
[1:23:27] and God hallelujah he'll turn that
[1:23:30] morning into a dance he'll give you a
[1:23:32] reason to dance
[1:23:35] absolutely will
[1:23:38] Hallelujah
[1:23:43] to the end that my glory may sing praise
[1:23:46] to thee so the what is all the point of
[1:23:47] this dancing what's all the point so
[1:23:49] that God is praised
[1:23:52] and I will not be silent God doesn't
[1:23:54] want a silent worshiper
[1:23:56] now Church there's going to be times
[1:23:58] when you are and that's okay that's
[1:24:00] mourning but you need to say God bring
[1:24:03] me a bring me a garment of Salvation
[1:24:05] amen bring me a garment a dancer I want
[1:24:08] to dance and get in the house of the
[1:24:09] Lord I want to know victory in my life
[1:24:11] praise God
[1:24:13] bring me a dancing garment praise God
[1:24:15] bring me garments of Salvation take away
[1:24:18] my ashes and give me some beauty praise
[1:24:20] God I ain't talking about straighter
[1:24:22] teeth
[1:24:23] although I got to pay for that
[1:24:25] yeah
[1:24:27] what can I do
[1:24:29] he's talking about giving God the praise
[1:24:32] getting his Joy back getting his victory
[1:24:33] back
[1:24:36] and he did it at the dedication of the
[1:24:38] House of David
[1:24:40] it was a dance for a new season of Life
[1:24:42] how many ever been through a new season
[1:24:44] of life
[1:24:45] but Austin came in Lena came that's a
[1:24:47] new season of life right there brother
[1:24:48] oh got the dances she's on Hallelujah
[1:24:51] out of dad and they're back oh my God
[1:24:53] hallelujah thank God I guess I'm still
[1:24:55] in that dancing season
[1:24:57] Glory right thank God
[1:25:02] but it took a seasonal mourning though
[1:25:03] to get there
[1:25:07] took a season in the morning
[1:25:09] but that's why God does it he does it to
[1:25:11] teach us remember we must suffer nor
[1:25:13] that we might obey
[1:25:15] we have to suffer so then we can help
[1:25:17] somebody else who suffers with the same
[1:25:18] thing
[1:25:20] to be a help to us in the midst or I'm
[1:25:23] sorry to be helped to them in the midst
[1:25:24] of their trials
[1:25:28] here's our text Praise You the Lord sing

[1:25:32] the congregation of saints

[1:29:05] that's why you got it
[1:29:07] so you can praise God
[1:29:11] praise ye the Lord
[1:29:13] Praise Him amen
[1:29:16] what was the context of this
[1:29:18] this was the time and season for dancing
[1:29:20] he had mourned but now he had peace and
[1:29:22] victory over his enemies
[1:29:24] Church you realize David had a time
[1:29:26] where he just fought tooth and nail for
[1:29:28] two decades almost but then he finally
[1:29:30] had a chance no more battles
[1:29:34] what would that feel like brother
[1:29:36] no more battles no more going out to
[1:29:39] battle no external battles Hallelujah
[1:29:43] and then he could start at that time he
[1:29:45] started praying I feel led to build a
[1:29:47] house for the Lord praise God can I do
[1:29:50] that prophet he said do all that's in
[1:29:52] your heart Prophet went home have a good
[1:29:53] night
[1:29:55] go tell him his he's not going to build
[1:29:56] it yes sir
[1:29:58] yes my friend I'm sorry I said that a
[1:30:00] little too early now
[1:30:02] actually you're not going to build it
[1:30:03] you can sort up but your son's going to
[1:30:05] build it because you're a man of war you
[1:30:07] shed too much blood this is going to be
[1:30:08] a house of peace
[1:30:13] platform
[1:30:16] for the children or grandchildren go in
[1:30:19] the rapture we don't know praise God
[1:30:21] how do we know we got to be faithful win
[1:30:24] every battle find every battle and let
[1:30:26] God bring us the seasons of Peace
[1:30:28] Hallelujah
[1:30:30] fight battles Hallelujah while you're
[1:30:32] strong fight him Hallelujah
[1:30:35] also recognize scenes of scenes the rest
[1:30:37] we had that remember we talked how we
[1:30:39] had years of rest right after certain
[1:30:41] people leave that are criticizing us or
[1:30:43] whatever
[1:30:44] we just have these seasons of rest but
[1:30:46] then guess what we go back into battles
[1:30:49] so enjoy The Season's arrest because God
[1:30:51] gives them to you
[1:30:52] that's the time to really meditate on
[1:30:53] God
[1:30:56] that's why I share that if we're not
[1:30:57] under a mandate for masks and lockdowns
[1:31:00] well let's enjoy it
[1:31:03] let's praise the Lord more let's let's
[1:31:04] spend more time together let's do
[1:31:06] whatever we got to do praise God Amen
[1:31:08] let's enjoy it Hallelujah
[1:31:11] because we got the season to do it
[1:31:15] to everything there's a season a time
[1:31:17] and purpose under the heaven
[1:31:19] verse 4 a time to weep and a time to
[1:31:22] laugh there's a time to laugh in church
[1:31:24] a holy laugh
[1:31:26] not the denominations holy laugh that's
[1:31:28] that's probably an evil spirit
[1:31:30] a time to mourn and a time to dance
[1:31:33] he's made everything beautiful in his
[1:31:35] time
[1:31:36] God wants to see you do both church God
[1:31:38] does God wants to see you dancing but he
[1:31:39] also wants to see you mourn for people
[1:31:43] he wants you to experience loss sure
[1:31:46] right and then you can feel that
[1:31:47] suffering and then in your scenes of Joy
[1:31:49] he wants you to feel that Victory you
[1:31:50] want you to feel like David praise God
[1:31:52] you want to feel like uh Miriam praise
[1:31:54] God you want you to feel that praise God
[1:31:58] so you can look at the Bible and say I'm
[1:32:01] one of them yeah like brother Brown said
[1:32:03] he made it he made an identification he
[1:32:05] said because God's Spirits in me that I
[1:32:08] was with Elijah Mount Carmel because
[1:32:10] God's spirit was there on Mount Carmel
[1:32:15] Hallelujah
[1:32:17] right in other words the spirit of God
[1:32:19] that's in me the spirit of God that was
[1:32:21] in me was also there so another in one
[1:32:23] way I was there
[1:32:27] Hallelujah see he was he became one so
[1:32:30] see he was one of them

[1:32:53] know
[1:32:54] it's a good thing I don't have a doctor
[1:32:57] again this is Solomon's end of his life
[1:32:59] there's a time and season he looked back
[1:33:01] he said okay there was a time I danced
[1:33:02] there's a time I mourned
[1:33:04] he had a lot of more to do at the end of
[1:33:05] his life for all of his hundred thousand
[1:33:07] wives yeah I'll tell my wife about that
[1:33:08] if you calculate a thousand weddings in
[1:33:12] 40 years he reigned for 40 years that's
[1:33:14] a wedding every two weeks
[1:33:16] well honey let's go enjoy our honeymoon

[1:33:19] married to this other woman here could

[1:33:27] of course I don't think I had a wedding
[1:33:29] for every one of those

[1:33:33] one Christ with a many-membered bride
[1:33:37] Hallelujah
[1:33:38] it turned out to be awful in the natural
[1:33:40] but in the spiritual it's a beautiful
[1:33:42] thing Hallelujah

[1:33:46] man amen we can all get the same truth
[1:33:49] from One Source oh we're all drawing on

[1:34:03] wife we are his body praise God
[1:34:06] and every part of his body is important

[1:34:23] and to do good in his life
[1:34:27] that's many times while I love dance

[1:39:23] got to rejoice in what God's done for
[1:39:25] you you've got to follow the lead of
[1:39:26] others who are free to worship God
[1:39:34] I better close here where where am I
[1:39:36] here are my notes Here
[1:39:39] I just got a couple more to go
[1:39:42] oh yeah here the sin stops dancing
[1:39:45] so this is why I was saying like people
[1:39:46] have closets full of sin that's why they
[1:39:48] don't worship God the way they should
[1:39:50] that's why I didn't worship God when I
[1:39:51] was in the dominations and when I first
[1:39:53] come to message I'll still tune tobacco
[1:39:55] I was doing other sins I should not have
[1:39:57] done once I'm embarrassed to admit
[1:39:59] but that's the reason I didn't have
[1:40:00] dancing the Bible says our dances turned
[1:40:03] into mourning
[1:40:05] woven to us that have sinned that's why
[1:40:07] people brother that's why people can
[1:40:09] never really some people can never
[1:40:10] really get the worship because they
[1:40:11] never confess their sins
[1:40:13] all you got to do is say God I'm sorry
[1:40:15] take this eve away from me and I'm gonna
[1:40:17] do everything in my power I'm going to
[1:40:19] make my calling election sure that I'm
[1:40:21] not going to be addicted to this again
[1:40:23] well you're gonna get your dance back
[1:40:28] when the word returns you'll get your
[1:40:30] dance back I'll say like this when you
[1:40:32] let the word return right
[1:40:34] David had to make sure that word come
[1:40:37] he had to bring it back you've got to
[1:40:39] bring the word back to your life
[1:40:41] in the right position of your life
[1:40:43] we all got to do that whether I'm as
[1:40:45] excited as I can be for a couple days I
[1:40:47] appreciate I'm gonna get tired I'm going
[1:40:48] to sin I'm gonna make a mistake I've got
[1:40:49] to bring the word back to first place in
[1:40:51] my life
[1:40:52] all of us got to do it
[1:40:56] so we're not I mean you're not alone
[1:40:57] nobody's here is it alone nobody's here
[1:40:59] uh is without God's help you have God's
[1:41:02] everlasting love
[1:41:04] that's right
[1:41:05] Hallelujah
[1:41:08] Jesus's Ministry was compared to
[1:41:11] uh John Jesus ministry was compared to a
[1:41:14] gluttonous winebiver I'm sorry they
[1:41:16] called him a gluttonous winebiver
[1:41:18] and they compared him to they compared
[1:41:20] his ministry to piping
[1:41:23] so Jesus is Ministry in the spiritual
[1:41:25] was like angels singing people rejoicing
[1:41:28] dancing praying all the Miracles all the
[1:41:30] signs wonders all the teaching was just
[1:41:32] a joyful time but John the Baptist was
[1:41:36] um
[1:41:37] came neither eating or drinking
[1:41:42] yeah more yeah John the Baptist is more
[1:41:44] of a morning sanctification and uh
[1:41:47] dedications kind of ministry it was
[1:41:49] mourning but Jesus's Miracles think of
[1:41:51] all the Miracles the dead Rays it caused
[1:41:53] dancing and rejoicing and and all this
[1:41:56] and that's the imagery that's given
[1:41:59] see when God does a miracle or God heals
[1:42:01] somebody we should come to church ready
[1:42:02] to dance and praise God
[1:42:05] and just tap me on the shoulder now
[1:42:06] cause I'm the pastor I can I can put a
[1:42:08] song request into the song leader and
[1:42:10] I'm sure he'll sing it
[1:42:11] yeah or if he's busy I'll sing it you
[1:42:15] might not like how I sing but
[1:42:17] you are we ought to just worship God
[1:42:20] we gotta that's what we need to grow we
[1:42:21] need to mature and recognize okay this
[1:42:23] is a season for rejoicing
[1:42:25] or maybe I'm in the season of tests and
[1:42:26] trials
[1:42:28] maybe I'm in the season of losing maybe
[1:42:30] I'm in the season of getting hey we're
[1:42:31] in the season of getting let's let's get
[1:42:32] some worship on hallelujah amen
[1:42:37] thank God
[1:42:39] so Jesus doing Mighty Miracles and
[1:42:40] saving Sinners through Fellowship was
[1:42:43] dancing spiritually
[1:42:45] it's like a spiritual dance
[1:42:49] of course we know herodi's daughter
[1:42:51] dance alone she did such a wicked
[1:42:53] seductive dance that the man said I'll
[1:42:55] give you anything you asked for
[1:42:56] right what kind of a dance could a woman
[1:42:58] do
[1:43:00] to get that kind of offer
[1:43:02] and we're talking like maybe millions
[1:43:04] and millions of dollars what kind of a
[1:43:05] dance and this the Bible said Herod
[1:43:07] actually observed the prophet John the
[1:43:09] Baptist
[1:43:10] look see look how lukewarm he was he
[1:43:12] could observe John the Baptist but then
[1:43:14] he could watch this girl dance
[1:43:17] see that's just a make that's called a
[1:43:19] make-believer
[1:43:20] right you know the word is true but then
[1:43:22] you enjoy sensual things that's a
[1:43:24] make-believer you got to repent of that
[1:43:25] become a real believer praise God
[1:43:28] that's right
[1:43:30] uh who remembers the first now the first
[1:43:32] dancing in the Bible was Miriam what was
[1:43:34] the first dancing in all of history
[1:43:37] Jesus
[1:43:39] oh you didn't know that
[1:43:41] the Bible said the low guys I preached
[1:43:42] this a number of months ago under the
[1:43:43] godhead series remember that
[1:43:45] the logos Rejoice that actual means in
[1:43:48] the Hebrew the logos danced before the
[1:43:50] Lord that lick of fire was dancing
[1:43:51] saying thank you Jesus I'm sorry no
[1:43:53] thank you thank you Father thank you
[1:43:56] Father thank you Lord
[1:43:59] uh the Oneness of God what a mystery huh
[1:44:03] gory
[1:44:05] the logos was the Delight of the father
[1:44:07] rejoicing dancing always before him yeah
[1:44:10] I just like that little goat like that
[1:44:12] little Ram just oh I'm so happy oh we're
[1:44:15] so that's so wonderful it's so sinless
[1:44:18] here it's holy holy holy holy amen thank
[1:44:20] God Amen he rejoice in the habitable
[1:44:23] part of his Earth
[1:44:25] so that that Pillar of Fire would dance
[1:44:28] all around creation oh Hallelujah
[1:44:33] and that was during the foundations of
[1:44:36] the world that was after God chose you
[1:44:38] because God chose you before the
[1:44:40] foundation of the world
[1:44:42] and the church said
[1:44:45] see there was dancing after you were
[1:44:46] chosen
[1:44:48] the first dancing was Jesus
[1:44:50] the logos
[1:44:52] dancing before the invisible father
[1:44:56] oh brother Jess you just copied that
[1:44:58] dancing from oh you know brother Ram's
[1:44:59] tapes or you just got no I actually got
[1:45:01] it before the foundation or I'm sorry
[1:45:03] when the world was founded that's where
[1:45:05] my dancing come from
[1:45:06] like brother Graham said we didn't copy
[1:45:08] shouting and dancing from the Devil
[1:45:12] shouting religion is the oldest religion
[1:45:14] there ever was
[1:45:16] because the Bible said the angels of God
[1:45:18] shouted at the foundations of the Earth
[1:45:21] all I've got is the same religion the
[1:45:23] Angels had amen glory
[1:45:25] not the Fallen Angels the Holy Angels
[1:45:28] I've got holy religion praise God
[1:45:31] I know you're getting getting tired I'm
[1:45:33] getting tired too here so let me find a
[1:45:35] place to close
[1:45:37] oh man I just I gotta stop somewhere let
[1:45:40] me see where I'm at
[1:45:41] I gotta stop at some point
[1:45:45] I'll just have to preach a part too

[1:45:51] I want to close with this thought here
[1:45:52] let me uh did I get it
[1:45:55] yeah I'm gonna close with this thought

[1:46:09] get a chance to get those scriptures on
[1:46:10] there
[1:46:12] okay bear with me here I had him say
[1:46:14] right here on my yeah

[1:46:18] like I said I didn't have a lot of time
[1:46:19] to prepare for this one
[1:46:22] because it came at the last minute
[1:46:25] Psalm 65 13 the pastors are clothed with
[1:46:27] flocks and The Valleys cover with grain
[1:46:29] they shout and Triumph indeed they sing
[1:46:32] did you know that the flocks and valleys
[1:46:36] the Bible says shout and Triumph and
[1:46:38] they sing
[1:46:40] I watched the video of that that brother
[1:46:42] left for us do you know whales sing

[1:46:59] know
[1:47:00] the flocks sing
[1:47:03] the Valley's covered with grain
[1:47:06] they shout and Triumph they sing
[1:47:09] Psalm 4 148 3. yeah we got that praise
[1:47:12] him all the Angels praise him all of his
[1:47:14] hosts Praise Him son in the moon the Sun
[1:47:16] and the Moon praise God sir
[1:47:20] you think the sun ever takes a break
[1:47:21] from praising God
[1:47:24] nor does Jesus praise him all ye shining
[1:47:26] stars Praise Him highest Heaven you
[1:47:28] Waters above the heavens
[1:47:30] let let them praise the name of the Lord
[1:47:32] for he commanded and they were created
[1:47:35] Isaiah 55 13. you will indeed go out
[1:47:39] with joy and be peacefully guided the
[1:47:41] mountains and the hills will break forth
[1:47:42] into singing before you and all the
[1:47:44] trees of the field are clapped their
[1:47:46] hands Hallelujah
[1:47:48] he answered I tell you if they were to
[1:47:50] keep silent the stones would immediately
[1:47:52] cry out
[1:47:53] Psalm 19 says the heavens declare the
[1:47:56] glory of God and the firm and it showeth
[1:47:58] his handiwork day and today utter speech
[1:48:01] and night on tonight showeth knowledge
[1:48:03] there's no speech nor language where
[1:48:05] their voice is not heard
[1:48:12] the mountains and the hills break into
[1:48:15] singing
[1:48:18] Hallelujah all the hosts praise God
[1:48:22] I'm gonna close with this I heard a
[1:48:23] preacher say this I really liked it so
[1:48:24] I'm gonna close with this a Pentecostal
[1:48:26] preacher
[1:48:28] the word dance in Hebrew means to world
[1:48:32] or go in a spherical
[1:48:34] a spherical shape so Circle here
[1:48:36] circular shape right
[1:48:40] and some of the dances some of the most
[1:48:41] popular dances we said they go in
[1:48:43] circular fashion
[1:48:45] praise God
[1:48:47] and the Bible says that we were made we
[1:48:49] were born to praise God
[1:48:52] we are his we're his creation
[1:48:54] and church when we actually get in that
[1:48:56] channel of worship we actually and we're
[1:48:58] dancing and singing or praising God or
[1:49:00] you might be whirling in your home
[1:49:01] praising God I'd like to do that too
