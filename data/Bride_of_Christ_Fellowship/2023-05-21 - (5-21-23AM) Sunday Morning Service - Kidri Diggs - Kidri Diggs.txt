Jeremiah chapter 29 and uh we're going to start reading that verse verse 11. Jeremiah 29 and 11. the Bible says for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then shall ye call upon me and ye shall and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye shall seek me and find me when ye shall search for me with all your hearts and I will be found of you save the Lord and I will turn away your captivity and I will give and I will gather you from all the nations and from the places where the I have driven you saith the Lord I will bring you again into the place once I cause you to be carried away amen let's let's go to um Romans I mean second Corinthians chapter 10. second Corinthians chapter 10 um let's just read um let's read verse 5. let's start at verse four for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God through the pulling down of strongholds casting down imagination and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and bringeth unto a captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ may the Lord a blessed reading of his word you can have your seats amen you know and uh um as your sitting I just want I just want to kind of quote out of um um Genesis chapter 17. what God Said to Abraham he told Abraham in uh verse verse 6. he says I will make thee exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of thee and King shall come out of thee and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee the land where wherein thou art a stranger all the land of Canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God Amen praise the Lord look like a little like a powerful promise amen amen you know um by the grace of God I desire your prayers but today by by God's grace I want to use for a subject living in your reality living in your reality and you know if we just if we just take the word of God first things first you know in Jeremiah God says I know the plan I have for you see nobody can change that no circumstance no situation first things first we want to talk about our reality we want to talk about our situation our life you as an individual not us as a church you as an individual now if you ask yourself right now in this moment are you living in your reality amen amen you know in reality has to coincide with God's plan because when we deal reality it speaks of Truth amen so anything that doesn't reflect truth is not of God you don't look at your life right now you know you say well brother Jesus I'm going through a trial but is that the truth does that Define who you are or is that something God's using you to get you into your reality because our reality is the word of God Amen because that's our truth amen and you know when I when I when I look in the in the in the word of God you know and I begin to think about uh Jeremiah he says I know the plans that I have for you thoughts of peace that should be your reality this morning amen and you know uh these thoughts come by experience Hallelujah you know God had to deal with me and you know and you think about the things that you be worried about uh or kind of upsets you or you you're trying to put things in place to take care of us and take care of that but God's plan is the thoughts of Peace amen so what we ought to do we ought to put these things back on God Amen Hallelujah whatever's troubling you put it back on God whatever standing in your way put it back on God hallelujah because my life is according to his plan Hallelujah peace and not of evil so brother Dixon I don't pay this bill they gonna take my house evil is not a part of my plane amen hallelujah lack you know sickness poverty all these things is not a part of my plan that's not a part of my reality Hallelujah amen you know and you know as I look in you know and we we we we read the scripture let's go back to Jeremiah chapter 29. you know this this is a powerful um verse of scripture you know because it it deals with uh God distinctly you know uh it shows how God is Not wishy-washy you know we we we have to take him at his word you know he says for I know the thoughts I have concerning the thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected ends see God already knows how things are supposed to end the problem is now we're God reality is not with God when we look at things and and what hinders our reality our imagination and your imagination can be something good or it could be something misplacing your reality all right and most of the time our reality our imagination stands in the way of our truth hallelujah and you know what we do is see how do we get sick or certain things happen and we start to imagine you know if I don't take care of this gonna happen the greatest detriment to our imagination is this thing called Google Hallelujah because as soon as something that's starting to happen we don't run to the word of God we run to Google what does Google say what does this say what does that say and what's happening it's activating your imagination to run away with your thoughts to run away or to run away from your reality Hallelujah Google is not the son of the law [Applause] so I don't make Google a part of my reality Hallelujah I I use Google as a MapQuest yeah but the reality of my travels is being here is accurate see there's something I have to do to get to that place amen I have to believe the truth of the matter but a lot of times your imagination that's why the Bible says casting down imagination Hallelujah casting down imagination in every High thing that exalt itself against the knowledge of God see what what is your what's hindering you from living in your imagination anything that comes against what God already said anything that comes against the knowledge of God and then the Bible says who's gonna give God knowledge who's gonna give God wisdom who's going to give God increase Hallelujah nobody nothing can give you knowledge amen so there's not anything out there that can stand against God's plan Hallelujah but what we have to do is cast down reasons amen and live in our reality Hallelujah when we think of uh uh the word that God has said he says and we keep going in Jeremiah he says uh to give you an expected end see God is expecting something amen amen see the whole journey down here is God trying to place us in our reality before we before we came into this message we were living a a life that was not according to God's plan and I'm not just talking about a group of people calling himself the message of the hour no I'm talking about the plan of God for your life Hallelujah and we all everyone in this room God has a plan for your life that's going to bring you to an expected end what is that expected in what God has already saw for you before the foundation of the world and nobody can change that again who's gonna give God knowledge who's gonna tell God which door should be open which door should be cold no God is the one bringing all of us to our own living reality Hallelujah despite what the enemy may do What the enemy may say amen God already knows that you know there's something a brother he loves to say in in my church and it's just so profound you know a lot of times when we preach he'll he'll throw us out there and he'll say God cannot have another thought think about that if God can have another thought that means in your life there was an error or he didn't he he's not a god of completion see that's why I always like to say you know the Bible says uh what we say all the time Lord you know give me more faith how can he when he gave you everything already amen Hallelujah when you will create it I love the example the prophet of God uses when he talks about an orange tree or apple tree he says when that bush is that high he says every seed everything it would ever produce is in it Hallelujah at that size honey you know one time I know you're about 18 19 now but once you about that size one-year-old two-year-old and everything you were turning out to be at 18 was already in you in that side hallelujah amen can you believe it you were once Hallelujah two foot now you're about six foot but everything in you when you were two foot is there in you right now while you're six feet hey [Applause] Hallelujah when you was running track he was already in here when you were playing football he was all this message was already in you oh God hallelujah why didn't you make it hardly to the NFL because that was not your reality why did you run hardly for gold medal because that was natural reality your reality was bursting out those children go to Hamilton of being a father of many Smiths holy reality was being the bride huh the passive Pride Church Hallelujah that was your reality [Applause] and we look at things that I hope Jesse don't mind Hallelujah well he said he said he's a real inspiration him him and his wife have reinspirations to me you know because you think about it you know in that moment maybe when you when you messed up your meniscus or or or whatever it was you know when you tore it you might as thinkers like man I was right there he played with some of the best of the best you know uh uh some of the some of the greatest of the greats and in that moment he may have had a thought like man I could have been this or I could have been mad see that's his imagination [Applause] and God don't wound our imagination Hallelujah he want the truth of the position of Christ that he called us to be in Hallelujah God wants us to live Our Truth amen Hallelujah and We Know by the grace of God because of this church in this building all of you being blessed now he's living in his truth the thing of it is hallelujah are you living in your truth my reality Hallelujah when I was struck by cancer that was not my reality God was using cancer to bring me to my reality [Music] Hallelujah and every trial and everything you go through God is using it to bring you to your reality [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah stubbing problems are not your reality your reality is I damn 53 by his fights I'm here see God's trying to get us beyond our imagination [Applause] because your imagination can be one of the biggest detriments to your walk in Christ that's why the scripture comes and come back and it says thank on these things what's up is honest whatsoever Spirit whatsoever is of a good report and you don't want to know like the scripture say amen God is trying to keep our thought process Hallelujah in Our Truth amen amen well you know and you have people in the world you know they'll be doing crazy stuff and they'll just say well I'm real I'm just I'm just real like no that ain't what he's talking about that's the real of this flesh the real of your own worldly desires no the real of the saith the Lord the real of God's plan for your life what God created you to be amen see there was a point Hallelujah when Man was created he was living in the reality of God's mind [Music] oh boy that's heavy That's Heavy right there huh think about the church when God saw Adam God was living his reality he said I'm gonna create something in my very own image in my likeness in my person think like me won't like me talk like me does everything like me Hallelujah he didn't do that see the animals wasn't his reality Hallelujah the fruit trees and all these things was not his reality but man what's his reality Hallelujah because man was not Hallelujah created just to be a part of the imagination of what God would be no he was the reality of who God is [Applause] [Music] are we [Applause] I just love going back to this casting down imagination and every High thought and every half thing that exalt itself above the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought see that's our challenge amen anything that's not speaking truth about who you are in Christ bring it into captivity how do you bring it into the activity you passed it down you tell the devil I will not let you have the last word in my mind I will not let you speak my destiny earlier but I will live according to the reality of God's word you say Brothers what do you mean the word cannot be changed the altar amen hallelujah that's why the prophet of God will say when you're going through things find yourself identified in Bible characters [Music] [Applause] because that's the reality Hallelujah he says if you find it in here do what they did and you'll get the same results so we should be able to go through the scriptures and look and find hallelujah our placing our position in Christ Hallelujah and you know church as a as I as I think about the word of God and even Christ Jesus coming upon the Earth he was living out his reality as a lord as a savior as a Healer all these things pulled him out of Glory he allowed all these things to happen Hallelujah to show us that bondage is not our reality that's why he came all the way he sent Moses to be a deliverer of Hallelujah to bring the children out why to bring them into their reality [Applause] amen and he did that over and over and over throughout the scriptures Hallelujah all the way up to the birth of Jesus Christ to show the people amen that sickness and shame and even Holier doing it having your sin forgiving and going back through it because the desire is there Jesus came to break away that [Applause] he came to breaking away his show there's a greater reality you can live beyond Hallelujah sinful desires even and Beyond carnal desires I'm gonna bring you into a real reality what is it it's called The Holy Ghost Hallelujah and the Holy Ghost becomes the reality that we can live by but when you look at Christ and how he walked the Earth they said oh he's just a man no that wasn't his reality see they got it all mistaken amen they crucified Jesus because they say you being a man make yourself God see they was looking at it wrong they couldn't step into the reality they look at him and they saw a man they say how could it be God the real reality of Jesus Christ was not that he was a man Hallelujah calling himself God the real reality was he was God making himself a man [Music] they couldn't understand Hallelujah the reality of God God was so high he could form a body Hallelujah and put his spirit in just like he did in the Garden of Eden see look at God's reality look at his truth hallelujah what did he do he put his Spirit Hallelujah in a man called Adam did he made a body for Adam earlier that was the reality of who he was so if he did that before he had to do it again [Applause] so you allowed another body to be born of a virgin birth Hallelujah his name was called Emmanuel counselor Prince of Peace the mighty one known as Jesus Christ and God came down again and put his spirit in a body Hallelujah and live the reality yeah what was the reality the reality was not only Hallelujah to just take away sin Hallelujah but to become sin [Music] he who knew no sin became sin he never became our sins he couldn't take it away amen so you had to become Hallelujah the very thing that was hindering your walk Hallelujah let's look at the execution of it not because he was a sinner Hallelujah but he became sin earlier by the confession of all of us believing him as Lord and savior but that's heavy right there not that he was a sinner but you confessing him as Lord and Savior Jesus Christ pleading his blood your sins Came Upon him amen now that's my reality [Music] I'm no longer a sinner but I confessed my sins unto Christ so every room everything I've ever done I've given it unto him and what did he do he's already crucified that's why the devil cannot hold anything to your child because it's already under the blood [Applause] Hallelujah see that's why we're so blessed to be able to go beyond just religion you know I was talking I was talking with a friend of mine and uh at one of the gyms I go to and she don't believe in God like we do and it's it's churches is is strange now the way people believe the things they believe in it doesn't even make sense you know this is why this is why it's very important to understand your truth amen hallelujah if I if I could tell the whole clan of the Smiths family this is not just your Mama and Daddy's uh gospel yo when you stand before God you're not going to stand there as their children you're going to stand there as a son or a daughter God Hallelujah you know churches is in this day people believe in anything and they try to they try to make it fit in their reality if you take the the the LBG D on TQ whatever you want to call it you take that Community they're not living in reality in a living reality you take a man and he said well I'm a woman and I can look at them and say you're a man amen everything about you speaks man Your Voice Hallelujah your statue amen your size 12 shoe everything about you speaks of a man I'm looking at the reality but his imagination [Applause] his imagination will allow him to live something sauce but if he or she just keep living it'll always bring them back to reality because there'll always be something to remind Hallelujah that that trans that you have been changed by the thoughts of your mind because there'll always be something there to come back I was telling Jesse yesterday I watched the interview with this man this woman this woman she said she said oh well what what is what is the definition of a woman he said an adult female she said well trans doesn't fit into that uh definition she says with all my friends see me they say that I am a woman he say of course they're your friends he said but I'm gonna tell you the truth every time when I look at you I see a man all right guys and you know they went on and on and on he says okay enough for this he said if you can just change the scope like that you could just say you are what you want to be or whatever however you feel like it and and all these things he say okay I'm I'm gonna I'm an adult black woman and he was a Caucasian man and she looked at him and she was like you just going too far he's like no if you can change it and for you to make for you to make it make sense in your mind why I can't change it and make it make sense in my mind and she was looking at him and saying what you're saying is crazy and he's looking at her and saying what you're saying is crazy see a person Hallelujah will only believe in something Hallelujah a lot of times if it fits into the scope of what they want to be but God didn't call us hallelujah through an imagination he called us through truth he called us holy through position and purpose Hallelujah every whole March or try to stop it try to do something all these things but every moment that trans woman that want to be a man every month it will remind her that she's a woman [Music] Hallelujah that's why they got to take medicine and shoot this and hit this and pump this just to stop Hallelujah their reality but if we can just catch the reality of God amen we can live in such a place above all this foolishness [Applause] and that's who Jesus was Jesus could live beyond what was going on at that time honey think about the church Jesus the god of Glory he who was not born of a man Hallelujah but born through the inspiration of the spoken word amen the disciples look like so much of the word uh the Sadducees and Pharisees look like so much of the truth but when the truth came to them they couldn't even understand when the facts Christianity the fact of the word the facts of the Savior Lord holy the fact of real power the fact of life the fact of the door being opened or standing right in front of them and they couldn't even step into that reality why because they had their own precepts of how it should be [Music] amen the worst thing we can do Hallelujah he's tried to orchestrate our own plan [Music] Amen in everything we do we should say if the Lord is willing amen [Applause] because say you go to the bank and you say I want fifty thousand dollars if the Lord is willing you go to the bank and you get that 50 50 000 you know why because the Lord was willing Hallelujah you go to whatever car dealership down here that has a 2023 Corvette Hallelujah and you go down there you say man you know what I always wanted a Corvette I'm gonna go down here and get a Corvette if the Lord is willing amen amen and just some kind of way with no money down no nothing amen does a Salesman come out there he say I like you know what I'm gonna create a deal for you and you're gonna leave out here today with that Corvette if you leave with it you know what the Lord was willing now let's apply that to Joy let's apply that to peace let's apply that to love healing that's a financial case amen if the Lord is willing [Applause] if the Lord is willing I'll have what God wants me to have but we look at the Walk of Christ and how Christ walked Hallelujah he walked with an authority of knowing Hallelujah his reality Jesus amen you go back and read it Jesus didn't come out to get him and different things different things will happen Jesus will tell his disciples amen they're gonna come get me Hallelujah they're going to crucify me in three days I'm a rock oh he will speak in his reality no man has never spoken as death and ever risen Resurrection again but he knew he had a purpose Hallelujah so your reality will always lead you to your purpose [Music] and you think about the church nobody could stop it nobody could do anything church he said nobody take my life but I lay it down [Music] he lived that way throughout his whole time on the Earth look when they came when Jews betrayed him and everything when they when they betrayed him look they came back with with knives and stabs and all these things and Jesus was like y'all ain't come to get a criminal realize nobody can take my life amen nobody can take my life that's not the reality of who I am nobody can take my life I'm God I'm omniscient holder I'm all powerful nobody can take my life church and he proved that he proved that in Luke the fourth chapter amen Jesus was healing people and doing these different things and the Bible says that the crowd got angry with him then they led him a certain way on the side of a hill or a mountain or whatever seeking in their imagination that they're going to push them off the cliff that was their imagination we're gonna kill him we're gonna push him off a cliff but that wasn't God's reality he wasn't supposed to die of a cliff he was going to die giving his life on the cross so he knew his reality even death couldn't stop his purpose he even controlled how and when he was supposed to die [Applause] that's when you know who you are live in your reality it's like it's like Jesus see Jesus they pull they brought him to the side of the cliff and they ain't mine they thinking they said we're gonna throw him up a cliff while they think of them thoughts Jesus walking straight through nobody could touch him why because his reality wasn't to die off a cliff that's what we ought to tell Satan my reality is not cancer amen [Music] amen my reality is not high blood pressure my reality is not diabetes that's not the way Hallelujah I was supposed to leave here I was supposed to leave you as a son and daughter of God [Applause] oh and he lived that way throughout his whole life upon the Earth many of the times they thought they'd kill him in different things but they couldn't do it why because that wasn't a part of who he was that wasn't a part of his Journey Church Jesus was so confident in his reality in his truth as coming Hallelujah to redeem us amen coming as a redeemer holy as a Healer and all these different things he was so confident in that Jesus could ask the devil whom you seek who you come after they said Jesus would never he said I'm he yeah [Applause] church he wasn't in hiding he was living his truth amen that's why this message doesn't put us in a corner where we had to know we're living out too [Applause] live my truth in front of my family live by truth in school live my truth on the job live my truth in church see Jesus wasn't hiding he says I am he and when he said that all of them fell down he waited till they get up he asked him again he said I said who do you seek they said Jesus name they fell down again see proving that nobody can change my reality hey man I've come to go to the Cross bear the sins of the world Hallelujah and make Sinners redeemable amen amen make Sinners righteous make Sinners faithful Hallelujah that was his purpose of coming Hallelujah that he would give us his life amen amen changing our reality amen amen because we were born in sin came into the world speaking lies but the confession of Jesus Christ changes all of that amen amen Jesse what it does it destroys generational curses that's when the confession of Jesus Christ does [Applause] but we have to get beyond what we see [Music] even what we hear that sometimes you can hear something and hear it wrong amen you ever you ever was telling your mom and dad somebody said don't you talk to me like that say mama I said this this oh okay oh okay all right all right you lucky because you said something but it was heard wrong so you had to clear it up amen that's why the Bible says be careful how you hear [Music] [Applause] we're not listening to the word hallelujah of a man we listen to the words of God yes think about it Church there were many of people that heard the voice of God and could not step into that reality [Music] amen they heard straight from God and couldn't live the reality of what they heard because something else was there think about it it blows me away every time I read the story of Balaam Balaam he goes straight to God to hear what God would say Amen now keep in mind this wasn't something strange for him he did this on several occasions but now he's coming into a place where who he is is really going to come out now he's going to come into the reality of who he is even though he's a prophet that he can hear from God walk with God and still have desire for things that's not of God Amen amen a dangerous place to be because his desire was going to get him killed even though he heard strength from God on what to do hey oh wow he heard the voice of God heard straight from God but his desire was Stronger amen his imagination of what he really wanted was Stronger than hearing straight from God and you think about how often we hear straight from God in our desires push away that reality you say ah come on bro these was it what did he really hear from God yes really he told balak he said look I'm gonna go get with God and see what he say first thing God says God is giving him a reality check God says who are those men you're with now he's all knowing he knows everything Hallelujah so that who are those men you're with is telling him you shouldn't be with those men [Applause] it's like a parent coming there saying who you on the phone with who you talking to who you on social media with they already saying to you that you shouldn't be talking to that person and Balaam goes into his whole Atkins holy spirit that this is they like it you know they want to curse the children of Israel and so forth is that and God says you can't change their reality amen [Applause] amen they like can't change their reality Balaam you can't change the reality because you can't curse what's blessed Hallelujah no matter what you see no matter what it looks like hallelujah what was God doing God was reminding Balaam of what he told Abraham [Applause] thank you no matter what it looked like 400 years later hallelujah or how many other years it was Hallelujah that real that was a reality check [Applause] he told him he said hey I told Abraham in blessings I Will Bless thee and multiplying our multiply the thy and thy seed shall be blessed [Music] [Applause] oh yeah and the journey through the Wilderness didn't change that blessing holy the murmuring ain't complaining didn't change that blessing all the unbelief didn't change that blessing the worship of a golden calf didn't change that blessing oh my God oh who got caught up with the gods of Baal and the Groves of bell didn't change that blessing [Music] [Applause] because he told Abraham in you they're going to be Nations and they're going to be blessed amen so here comes Balaam Hallelujah not realizing those people that he see already have a God sent reality amen he grows Bay Lake Hallelujah he's looking at the people and he's saying amen they don't they lick up the whole the whole country all the grass and everything Hallelujah church that wasn't the first time Hallelujah somebody had got a check like that honey lot had the same check hey man his husband and Abraham hers when they begin to argue and so forth and lot was like hey we need to do something about this so Abraham knowing his reality all this belongs to me you just chew you just choose and I go someplace else [Applause] Hallelujah see when you understand your reality you're not going to fight with unbelief [Applause] let them go go ahead hey you just be like Abraham go ahead and get what you want so I can save you later thank you cause my reality is blessings and not curses what what made light righteous it was the blessings of Abraham it was the prayers of Abraham it was just his connection with Abraham [Applause] and because Abraham had contact with God hallelujah Abraham became lot's savior [Applause] and just you holy think about it we was in yesterday think about it just you being a child of God somebody giving you a drink of water makes you their savior amen they can make it into the kingdom just because they treated you good they said something nice to you they help you uh up the stairs or they help you put Grocer in the car whatever it is some unconsciously knowing earlier that they're doing something for a child of God and they're going to be rewarded because of that that in my time of need maybe somebody pulled a hundred dollars out and say hey here you go brother James they did that unto the Lord helping me to remain in my reality oh my God I'm about to close but the reason why I'm ending with Abraham because Abraham going back to what we started with Abraham and Sarah they had to conquer their imagination to live out their reality in the whole life the whole part of their Journey first started out with a carnal imagination God comes again speaking to God listen Church Hallelujah unbelief is powerful don't give yourself over to doubt if at any time you have questions and you begin to doubt just know one thing don't doubt the word of God Amen [Applause] you can tell people all you want just don't doubt the word of God [Music] because every man all of us every man no matter how great you want to make himself be all of us have an element of failure inside and with that the grace of God we would project failure daily [Applause] so never put your eyes on a certain person and say I want to be like that no no because then you're setting that personal for failure and you're saying yourself up for failure amen because God will show you that that person needs the grace of God Amen amen just to get your eyes back on him Hallelujah he did it to Isaiah and uziah Hallelujah because you saw your Hallelujah he looked at me so lifted up and all these great things and everything and Isaiah being a young man up under him Hallelujah he looked at him he idolized him but God allowed certain events to take place to bring Isaiah back to his reality [Music] [Applause] but we look the greatest thing Abraham and Sarah had to deal with was their own imagination [Music] having that face to face with God wasn't a problem All Through the Bible and and I'm a little jealous I'm a little jealous because you read the Bible you see people had one-on-ones With God all the time when they needed something from the Lord they'd go get into prayer and God will come and speak to him or God will send an angel and so forth and everything church God hasn't changed he's still the same what's the problem hallelujah it's it's up we're too connected to this world but we just lay everything aside and really get into the reality of God communicating with his people we will hear his voice and it'll be clear Hallelujah Church sin cannot stop you from hearing the voice of God I don't know about that church it has to be because if sin could stop it I'll ask you a question how could Adam hear God after they particularly [Applause] even after he's seeing even after he called all creation to fall he still heard God calling him as he always did through give me no excuses about the situation don't give me no excuses about what you did and what you think about if he couldn't stop Adam and he from hearing the voice of God it surely can't stop your situation but it's something that I'm just kind of taking know that that there's so many people in the Bible or in the word that we read that they have one-on-ones with God but who they were the voice of God still couldn't change them Cain himself bad having a one-on-one with God talking to God and My Brother's Keeper you know I don't know where he at and all these things and even getting instruction from God if you do as your brother you'll be accepted he's getting instruction from God but who he was his reality would let him be something he wasn't amen man and he could walk out of the presence of God and there's so many people like that you know if again if I go back to Balaam Balaam comes to God at least three times asking him about the same thing like God doesn't didn't know what he was saying the first time but what there was something inside of him that was craving something else and he kept trying to reason with God picture that honey God is only obligated to his word and he's obligated to what he said about you amen and all these things that God was saying they blessed and not curse I don't care what you show me they blessed they're not cursed okay Balaam go ahead just go ahead God didn't change his mind he told me to go ahead and God said now I got the key because you want that more than you want to obey me amen and it took a donkey to be anointed by God to speak to Baylor man look Church he's so blinded by what he wants he's so blinded about his imagination getting what he can get from balak he's so blinded by that he's not even realizing he's in a supernatural event right now a donkey is talking to me he couldn't even see he's so blinded he didn't even realize a donkey he's having a conversation with a donkey I don't know about y'all but if I'm sitting at the house I gotta I got a uh uh a dog named Bella and Bella is a a half pit bull and she's a pretty stocky dog but if we're sitting in the living room and I come home and I sit down I look at Bella and better look at me and she say how was your day I think I lose it or I call the news and say hey I got a talking dog that's not some ordinary but Balaam was so blinded by what he but but what he wanted and what he desired God opened the mouth of a donkey and started talking to him the donkey trying to save his life and he didn't even realize what's going on he getting mad at the Donkey [Music] sometimes God will put things in place to keep you in your perspective reality [Music] because you're going after something that he didn't ordain for you something that could cost you your life so you put something in the way to try to keep you in your reality and then balaam's case it took a talking donkey and he wasn't happy about that thing either he was mad at the Donkey he wanted to kill a donkey and then God opened his eyes and he saw the angel standing there with the sword ready to chop his head off be careful this is a whole other message man I'm about to quit be careful where your desires are pulling man because your desires can be pulling you completely out of the will of God completely out of your reality that God has for you but when we look at conquering and we see what Abraham and Sarah had to conquer first was their imagination God told him to say in your old age you're going to have a son you and Sarah out of your own vowels out of your own you you you're gonna have this Sarah and Sarah laughed Abraham laugh but that didn't change God one bit that didn't change their reality one bit Sarah says okay how can this be me being old my Lord being oh we haven't pleased you know what hey God that's how it's gonna happen still didn't change their reality Hallelujah Abraham having other kids still didn't change the reality earlier Abraham Hallelujah got out of the will of God began to walk down he said hey you're my sister now don't say you're my wife the king gonna come get you Keem come until Sarah still didn't change their reality [Applause] God is going to make sure you fulfill the plan he has for you [Applause] because if you don't that mean God has to change his plan whatever he's laid is once and for all [Applause] so what I love about God God protecting himself as well as protecting you God comes down tells the man give Abraham back Sarah or you're good as a dead man and better yet go down and let him pray for you [Applause] he goes down he prays for him he said why did you lie to me why do you do this this and that he's the house of free blah blah blah and the man was like oh my God you're about to get all of us killed and then the next thing you know Sarah has Isaac and that whole promise 25 years later became a reality [Music] [Applause] and now we're all living by faith the reality the promise that God has given to Abraham I see let me tell you this morning what is a part of our reality die seed shall possess the Gate of this enemy [Applause] that's my reality oh sickness is not my reality depression is not my reality Hallelujah the Bible says whatsoever you desire When you pray if you believe you shall have it that's my reality [Applause] because this walking in let's believe in that earlier because reality speaks of Truth speaks of facts Hallelujah so when you look at your life Hallelujah ask yourself the question before you do anything if anything is happening where you are right now ask yourself is this really who I am [Music] is this really who I am what just you you'll be going through something you're going through the greatest child of your life and you have to ask yourself is this really who I am or am I overcome don't let that child change who you are up here [Applause] speak those things that are not as though they are that's my reality my reality is speaking Hallelujah my my truth into existence hey I pray God help us all to continue to live our reality you know a lot of people don't understand they look at us as church folks that's all you do this you that and you know you just you're just too saved oh you just you just too much and your dress and you're this and you know I'm pretty sure we all had heard it you know even even I mean uh cable guy came to my house one time he's like hey we got a new dude I say I got your internet that's good enough he said well who you got for TV I say nobody he said well you got kids I said yeah he said well what they watch I say nothing and he looked at me like in discuss like why are you doing those children like that and I'm thinking in that moment that if you only knew there's something way greater for them [Music] [Applause] that's something way ain't greater earlier so the way ain't greater than a Hulu way greater than Netflix well ain't greater than Disney Plus there's something way greater a relationship with God that's what I wanted them to experience a relationship with God all that other stuff can be put on the back burner [Applause] amen because you think about it when we get to heaven what's going to be the entertainment ain't gonna be no more actors ain't gonna be no Denzel ain't gonna be no fast and furious and ain't gonna be no wakanda forever ain't gonna be none of that [Applause] ain't gonna be no Captain in America ain't gonna be no Spider-Man ain't gonna be ain't gonna be no entertainment what's gonna be the entertainment Hallelujah God being worshiped by us [Applause] Hallelujah come on musicians Hallelujah you know what's gonna be an entertainment hallelujah amen now the guy and brother amen leading the bride of Christ and I've been touched by a fire Hallelujah [Applause] come and watch me burn hooray let's pray let's pray Lord Jesus father we love you Lord and we thank you for the unction of your spirit Lord and we just pray Lord something was said to help the people bring us closer to you Lord the power of God foreign [Music] [Music]
