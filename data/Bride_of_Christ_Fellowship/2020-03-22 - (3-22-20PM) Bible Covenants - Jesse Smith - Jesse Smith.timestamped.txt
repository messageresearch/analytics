[5:30] but Stan will read our scripture here
[5:32] today we want to take the topic tonight
[5:37] of Bible covenant so we'll just do a
[5:39] little Bible study by the grace of the
[5:43] Lord now what I've done is for the
[5:47] Saints in our church that know I've been
[5:49] writing another book on the the 12 Bible
[5:52] mysteries and in the chapter two I'm
[5:55] looking at Israel and her blindness and
[5:58] so I'm showing how Israel's part of the
[6:01] Mosaic Covenant because she's rejected
[6:04] the New Covenant so that kind of got me
[6:07] studying on covenants and so we'll look
[6:12] at that here today by God's grace I
[6:15] think we'll start with the the seventh
[6:20] covenant so let's go to Jeremiah 31:31
[6:27] we'll just start there for our text
[6:29] Jeremiah 31:31 since that's the covenant
[6:32] we're in right now I think I like to
[6:34] start there and then build up to that
[6:38] one by the grace of the Lord Jeremiah 31
[6:52] verse 31
[7:08] worried 31 to 34 by the grace of the
[7:11] Lord now I children run out we all read
[7:18] verse 30 31 and then I'll read the other
[7:22] ones but we'll just read one verse
[7:23] together so we're gonna read in verse 31
[7:25] together then I'll just read 32 to 34
[7:28] myself let's read verse 31 on three one
[7:32] two three
[7:33] behold the day's come saith the more
[7:36] that I will make a new covenant with the
[7:40] house of Israel and with the house of
[7:43] Judah I'm going to keep reading myself
[7:45] not according to the Covenant that I
[7:48] made with their fathers in the day that
[7:50] I took them by the hand to bring them
[7:52] out of the land of Egypt which my
[7:55] covenant they break although I was and
[7:57] husband unto them saith the Lord but
[8:02] this shall be the Covenant that I will
[8:03] make with the house of Israel after
[8:05] those days saith the Lord I will put my
[8:08] law in their inward parts and write it
[8:11] in their hearts and will be their God
[8:14] and they shall be my people and they
[8:17] shall teach no more every man his
[8:20] neighbor and every man and his brother
[8:21] saying know the Lord for they shall all
[8:24] know me from the least of them unto the
[8:26] greatest of them saith the Lord for I
[8:29] will forgive their iniquity and I'll
[8:32] remember their sin no more
[8:34] praise God let's have another word of
[8:36] Prayer here just briefly Heavenly Father
[8:39] we thank you for this opportunity
[8:40] Lord we can't or we don't feel led to
[8:43] gather tonight physically just just
[8:46] through this livestream Lord we're
[8:48] gathered in spirit we'd say so teach us
[8:50] from the Holy Spirit guide us lord help
[8:52] us today to understand our covenant more
[8:55] that we're under and the blessings and
[8:58] benefits of it dear God and we just
[8:59] thank you for all you've done or be
[9:02] magnified glorified protect your people
[9:04] Lord Jesus from this this awful
[9:07] sorrowful virus the coronavirus protect
[9:11] heal them and lord help us to come
[9:13] through Lord God with a great testimony
[9:16] of your love and your care your healing
[9:18] your provision your safety your
[9:20] protection
[9:21] and we give you all the glory tonight in
[9:23] Jesus Christ's name never said Amen god
[9:26] bless you is being seen in praise God so
[9:34] we're gonna start right there
[9:36] as far as our text but we'll go back and
[9:38] look at all the covenants I kind of want
[9:42] to just start with this Saints I'm
[9:45] writing this chapter I'm currently on
[9:46] this chapter the Israel's blindness
[9:48] chapter Paul calls it a mystery in
[9:51] Romans 11:25 I believe but to understand
[9:56] how God can how can God still save
[10:01] blinded Israel and so one of the aunt
[10:04] one of the reasons is because they're
[10:07] still under covenant blessings
[10:09] although they've turned down the New
[10:12] Covenant they they still are entitled to
[10:16] the of other Covenant blessings and so
[10:19] that's where this thought ID idea came
[10:22] from as far as studying the Bible
[10:25] covenants and so it's been a great study
[10:28] I've been working on it probably for a
[10:30] couple months now here just in the
[10:31] mornings for a few minutes each day Lord
[10:34] willing and we'd like to begin looking
[10:37] at this and I hope as I've done with the
[10:40] other chapters I hope as I preach it
[10:42] more inspiration or more clarification
[10:44] will come and it'll help Lord willing
[10:48] when the book is finished maybe another
[10:50] year so it could be just as solid as as
[10:54] possible to strengthen the people and to
[10:57] show them that the mysteries of God are
[10:59] finished by the grace of the Lord
[11:01] according to revelation 10 7 and that
[11:04] they're continuing to go around the
[11:06] world praise God
[11:08] so I like to preach off my notes I tried
[11:13] to print them off here I want to start
[11:16] with just some general statements on
[11:18] covenants Testaments and the Gentile
[11:23] dispensation
[11:24] so I want to start with those thoughts
[11:26] just to kind of lay a groundwork here
[11:29] for understanding the terminology of
[11:34] course terminology and understanding
[11:36] things is very important especially with
[11:39] the church ages and seven seals and now
[11:43] as you get into this with covenants it's
[11:45] very important as well to understand
[11:47] everything okay so understanding the
[11:52] covenants will help us understand how
[11:55] God particularly deals with Israel but
[11:58] then how God makes a gracious shift he
[12:02] goes from Israel just focusing on Israel
[12:05] to all mankind namely the Gentiles so
[12:11] it's wonderful to see God's love in the
[12:13] covenants and I believe church it is
[12:18] God's immutable power of his covenants
[12:21] which is his promises that allows even
[12:24] blinded Israelis to be safe think of
[12:28] that even those that are blinded by
[12:30] their own unbelief God can even save
[12:33] blinded Israelis and of course that's
[12:36] proven through the fifth seal Lord
[12:42] willing tonight I don't think I'll cover
[12:43] that too much but anyone that follows
[12:46] the message of William Branham will know
[12:49] that the fifth seal was all about Jews
[12:51] and how they're there right now the
[12:53] souls of faithful blinded Jews are under
[12:57] the altar in heaven and they're crying
[13:00] out oh Lord
[13:02] how long until our blood is Avenged on
[13:05] the earth and so they're crying out and
[13:08] the Lord will even answer them so we
[13:12] know blinded Jews do not go down to the
[13:16] grave as far as the heart of the earth
[13:18] or we'd say Hades why did Jews although
[13:22] blinded if they're faithful they are
[13:24] taken up to heaven by the grace of God
[13:26] so it's a it's a wonderful to see how
[13:28] God is so merciful and that's why I
[13:30] believe Church I can be wrong that's why
[13:32] I believe even foolish virgin I don't
[13:35] believe they'll go down to the heart of
[13:37] the earth
[13:38] I imagine if God has mercy on blinded
[13:40] Jews then God has mercy on foolish
[13:43] virgins who passed away and there there
[13:45] must be a place for them not gonna be
[13:47] wrong on that but that's just that's my
[13:49] opinion on the grace of God if God is
[13:52] gracious to blinded Jews I believe he
[13:55] would be gracious to foolish virgins
[13:57] because he is the god of all grace so I
[14:01] want to start with saying this the words
[14:05] covenant and Testaments are synonymous
[14:09] which means they mean the same thing and
[14:13] what they mean is a compact or a league
[14:17] so in the Old Testament the Old
[14:22] Testament only uses covenant in the King
[14:24] James a total of 256 times there's no
[14:29] uses of the word Testament in the Old
[14:31] Testament the first use is Matthew 26:28
[14:37] and the New Testament uses both covenant
[14:40] and Testament 24 and 13 times
[14:44] respectively the same Greek word for
[14:48] covenant it's it's Daiya feekiee I think
[14:53] that's I say die of theek a which means
[14:57] a compact a covenant or Testament
[14:59] Testament is interpreted as both
[15:01] covenant and Testament repeatedly in the
[15:03] New Testament so the same Greek word in
[15:05] the New Testament can be used to say
[15:07] Testament or covenant and so that's why
[15:10] I believe covenant and Testament they're
[15:12] just inert interchangeable words so some
[15:14] people disagree they think they're
[15:16] different but from what I can see by
[15:18] studying the scripture and you know just
[15:21] their Greek origins it seems like
[15:22] they're one in the same here's a word
[15:26] that's often misunderstood I mentioned
[15:28] this a few weeks ago but the word
[15:30] dispensation I believe it's it's rarely
[15:34] understood because it's often confused
[15:39] with a covenant but I do not believe a
[15:44] dispensation is a covenant I believe in
[15:49] this
[15:49] sensation is a stewardship which in the
[15:51] Greek means I'm sorry
[15:53] that's what dispensation means in the
[15:55] Greek is a stewardship they can also
[15:58] mean an overseeing job so dispensation
[16:04] is a stewardship a job of overseeing a
[16:07] covenant is a compact or agreement so we
[16:10] can see some difference there okay the
[16:13] dispensation is a job but covenant is
[16:16] just an agreement so the Greek defines
[16:20] dispensation as a manager or overseer or
[16:24] stewardship so the Bible speaks of that
[16:28] we'll talk about that soon here the same
[16:33] word the same Greek word for
[16:35] dispensation is also used for
[16:36] stewardship in Jesus's parable of the
[16:39] unjust steward in Luke 16 1 to 13 so
[16:45] that's the parable well Jesus comes back
[16:47] and the steward or the steward was
[16:50] unjust and he quickly had to sell some
[16:51] things and try to save his own skin and
[16:55] that's where Jesus says the children of
[16:57] this world are wiser in their generation
[16:59] and the children of a faith of course
[17:04] that's just dealing with where Jesus
[17:06] saying you know Christians should make
[17:07] more investments in the things of God
[17:09] right we should make more investment we
[17:12] should take more time to invest in
[17:15] heavenly rewards that's basically what
[17:17] that means
[17:21] now you'll I've seen it on YouTube and
[17:25] you'll hear preachers preach it but some
[17:27] people say there's multiple
[17:29] dispensations throughout human history
[17:31] but I don't believe that idea is
[17:33] scriptural because I'm not I'm not
[17:36] defining a dispensation as a time period
[17:39] I'm defining dispensation as a
[17:40] stewardship the way the Greek defines it
[17:45] now the King James mentions the word
[17:48] dispensation four times and Paul is the
[17:52] only Bible writer from who uses it at
[17:55] all and will read those scriptures three
[18:00] of the verses point to one dispensation
[18:03] that belonged to Pau okay
[18:08] that's the dispensation of the gospel of
[18:11] Jesus Christ so why don't we read those
[18:15] so children can you read out loud would
[18:18] that be okay so Jeff your Bibles there
[18:20] okay so Lydia gave first Corinthians 9
[18:23] 17 that he's gonna read first
[18:25] Corinthians 9 17 Malachi Ephesians 1:10
[18:30] that's okay
[18:32] you just have two readers so we have two
[18:35] readers in our house and then I'll tell
[18:41] you they go so we read all four
[18:43] scriptures that say dispensation in the
[18:46] King James so Lydia 1st Corinthians 9 17
[18:58] okay so Paul says this stewardship or
[19:01] dispensation is committed specifically
[19:03] to him Lydia go to Colossians 1:25 while
[19:09] you're going there I'm gonna go to
[19:09] Melancon it okay so that was first
[19:12] Corinthians 9:7 now Malachi is gonna
[19:14] read Ephesians 1:10 so Malachi when
[19:16] you're in the fullness of times you
[19:20] might gather together in one all things
[19:21] in Christ both which are in heaven and
[19:24] which are on earth even in him okay so
[19:27] this is the one time dispensation isn't
[19:29] used clearly just to refer to Paul it
[19:34] just says in the dispensation of the
[19:35] fullness of times and then maokai go to
[19:40] Ephesians 3 - can you read that bit
[19:50] fusions 3 - ÿà heard of the dispensation
[19:53] of the grace of God which is given to me
[19:55] even needs you work ok so again so Paul
[19:59] says in Ephesians 1:10 and I'm sorry I'm
[20:04] sorry feet
[20:05] yeah I'm sorry 1st Corinthians 9 17 and
[20:07] Ephesians 3 - that a dispensation of the
[20:11] gospel has been committed unto him then
[20:14] Lydia Colossians 1
[20:15] 25 wherefore I am made a minister
[20:18] according to the dispensation of God
[20:20] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[20:22] the work to fill the Word of God
[20:24] alright so Paul says I have a
[20:26] dispensation to fulfill the Word of God
[20:29] so it seems like in those three verses
[20:31] there's one specific dispensation and
[20:34] that's given to Paul and it's the gospel
[20:36] that Jesus Christ committed to him now
[20:39] the one verse the dispensation of the
[20:41] fullness of times that word does seem to
[20:44] deal with when all time comes to an end
[20:48] we would say that would probably have to
[20:50] be at the New Jerusalem the future home
[20:53] when time comes to an end because
[20:54] there's time all the way up to that
[20:56] point so that's the difference now
[21:01] between covenants Testaments and
[21:03] dispensations that's the way it looks
[21:06] like the scripture teaches it covenant
[21:08] and Testament are agreements between God
[21:11] and man and then dispensation it seems
[21:15] like Paul had a dispensation of the
[21:17] gospel a stewardship committed to him
[21:21] that he had to be faithful in and we
[21:22] know he was faithful he said there's a
[21:24] crowd of life waiting for me praise God
[21:27] now let's go back to covenants now let's
[21:29] do a few scriptures here Paul literally
[21:34] uses the word covenants plural which
[21:37] means there's more than one so I'll read
[21:40] that Romans 9 for so if you have your
[21:42] Bibles you can turn there Romans 9 for
[21:45] and as you're turning there I want to
[21:47] say this my title for this is viable
[21:49] covenants now I want to say this I don't
[21:53] know if there are seven covenants or
[21:54] eight but to me it looks like eight but
[22:00] the reason it could be seven is because
[22:01] seven is a complete number and the
[22:04] rainbow rainbow rainbow represents a
[22:06] token of God's covenant and a rainbow
[22:09] has seven colors so it could be that
[22:12] there's seven covenants but I want to
[22:15] say the reason I think there's eight is
[22:19] because eight is the number of eternity
[22:23] brother branham use this in the future
[22:26] home and I'll go through some more
[22:27] examples as well
[22:29] the eighth day is the first day all over
[22:32] again so it points to the fact that life
[22:36] will just keep going time will just keep
[22:38] going on unending and the example he
[22:42] gives is brother Branham said God
[22:44] created the earth in six thousand years
[22:47] the seventh was interrupted by sin and
[22:50] so since God had 6,000 years God's given
[22:54] Satan 6,000 years to tempt the lie steal
[22:57] destroy kill but when Jesus returns and
[23:01] after the tribulation God gets his
[23:05] seventh day of rest the Millennium the
[23:08] 1,000 year millennium and then brother
[23:11] Ram says after the Millennium he said
[23:14] comes the eighth day or the future home
[23:17] or new Jerusalem so as I looked at the
[23:20] scripture and the quotes it seems to me
[23:23] there would be eight covenants because
[23:26] eight points to Eternity eight points to
[23:30] the future home by God's grace so but I
[23:33] could be wrong and I looked up quotes I
[23:35] couldn't find any quote where brother
[23:36] Branham says the exact number of
[23:38] covenants but I'll show you why I think
[23:43] there's eight of course through the
[23:44] scripture by God's grace I better set a
[23:46] timer I probably started it like four
[23:49] ten or something like that so just so
[23:53] that it's a little timer here all right
[23:59] so Romans nine four hopefully you're
[24:02] there by God's grace Romans nine four
[24:04] says who are Israelites to whom
[24:07] pertaineth the adoption and the glory
[24:10] and the covenants and the giving of the
[24:14] law and the service of God and the
[24:18] promises it was a great thing to be a
[24:20] Jew right look at all those blessings
[24:22] covenants lost service promises glory
[24:25] adoption what more could you ask for
[24:28] praise God there are so many great
[24:30] blessings I want you to again see Paul
[24:34] says there's more others plural there's
[24:36] multiple covenants go to Ephesians 2:12
[24:40] if you have your Bibles that are
[24:42] Ephesians 2:12
[24:49] now here Paul specifically calls them
[24:52] covenants of promise so that's why I
[24:56] think there's eight as well as you'll
[24:57] see every time God makes a promise or a
[25:01] league or a compact or agreement with
[25:04] man even beginning in Eden it seems it
[25:08] has to be classified as a covenant and
[25:12] so hopefully that will make sense by
[25:14] God's grace so Ephesians 2:12 okay every
[25:18] dance engine even then at that time ye
[25:23] were without Christ being aliens from
[25:24] the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers
[25:26] from the covenants of promise having no
[25:28] hope and without God in the world know
[25:31] what a scripture what a beautiful
[25:33] scripture so really Paul says if you
[25:35] have no covenant with God you have no
[25:37] hope
[25:38] what an awful place to be in and Paul
[25:40] said that's where we were until the
[25:43] blood of Jesus Christ came amen thank
[25:45] God for the blood of Christ to come to
[25:47] us poor blinded aliens to the covenants
[25:53] Gentiles who were lost as brother Craig
[25:56] oi says Gentiles with clubs on our backs
[25:59] which brother branham said but always
[26:01] stinks in my mind because the being
[26:04] taught by Craig so how many covenants I
[26:09] think it's eight now here's why it seems
[26:14] God initiated eight covenants and
[26:16] granted them to mankind
[26:19] each covenant or compact established a
[26:22] new beginning for a group of people or a
[26:26] beginning and it's an expression of
[26:30] God's love grace and faithfulness
[26:32] because their promises right a promise
[26:35] of God would be a gracious thing it
[26:38] would be a faithful thing it would be a
[26:40] loving an act of love right because God
[26:41] doesn't have to make promises with us it
[26:44] is His grace and love now in the book
[26:48] when I did next is after that I showed
[26:52] biblical numerology and to show how a is
[26:55] a number that rep
[26:56] presents it can represent either new
[26:58] creation or a new beginning and I give a
[27:03] number of examples here let me just see
[27:05] one two three four five six seven eight
[27:09] I give nine examples okay so that's a
[27:11] lot of examples we're not gonna read
[27:14] them for times sake
[27:17] as far as in the Bible but you'll
[27:18] probably familiar with them
[27:20] if not then you know as you're listening
[27:22] this pause as you're listening to it
[27:25] later on the archive pause it and go
[27:28] back and read them but just write them
[27:30] down so if you're listening live just
[27:31] write down down if you want to go study
[27:33] them out and search them out I find
[27:36] though in this age
[27:38] I'm not sure how many people actually go
[27:41] study out everything they write down I
[27:43] know it's good that reason I say that's
[27:44] cuz it's a struggle for me now I study
[27:46] everyday but when I actually take
[27:48] specific notes on sermons I don't always
[27:51] find myself going back over those so I
[27:53] want to encourage you to do that by the
[27:56] grace of the Lord as you feel led by the
[27:59] Holy Spirit so let's look at these nine
[28:04] examples how eight represents either new
[28:06] creation or new beginning okay the first
[28:09] one is God saved eight souls by water
[28:13] during Noah's Flood and he gave humanity
[28:17] a new beginning
[28:18] that's Genesis 818 and first Peter 3:20
[28:23] very familiar with that he saved eight
[28:25] so he starts all over humanity gets a
[28:28] second a second beginning with eight
[28:30] people number two every Hebrew male was
[28:34] circumcised on the eighth day which
[28:38] seems to represent males getting a
[28:42] beginning part of Abraham's covenant so
[28:46] if they weren't circumcised they'd be
[28:48] cut off from the people of Israel so
[28:53] they had to be had to be circumcised in
[28:56] order to have a beginning time in the
[28:59] Covenant and it came on the eighth day
[29:03] the third example is that God officially
[29:08] forgave in
[29:09] through sacrificial atonement and gave
[29:14] them a new beginning as the glory of the
[29:17] Lord fell on the eighth day of
[29:19] sacrificing okay so when God established
[29:22] his covenant it was on the eighth day
[29:25] that the glory fell so it seemed to give
[29:28] them a new beginning
[29:30] the people of God and they were declared
[29:33] as having the atonement at that point I
[29:37] was Leviticus 9 the whole chapter 1 to
[29:41] 24 live in against 9 1 to 24
[29:45] now Leviticus 14 it kind of deals with
[29:48] this morning's message with the
[29:49] coronavirus a leper was declared clean
[29:53] at the door of the congregation on the
[29:55] eighth day of their recovery which was
[29:59] like beginning a new time of cleanliness
[30:02] right on the eighth days on the eighth
[30:05] day they're declared new here's a fifth
[30:12] example Israel held a holy convocation
[30:15] or sacred assembly assembly as an extra
[30:19] Sabbath the Sabbath day on the eighth
[30:22] day of the Feast of Trumpets to mark the
[30:25] beginning of the civil year okay and
[30:29] that's actually the example brother
[30:30] Branham uses in the future home to show
[30:33] how the eighth can be the number of
[30:36] eternity or a new beginning
[30:39] that's leviticus 23 verses 33 to 44 so
[30:46] there was an extra convocation an extra
[30:49] Sabbath day on the eighth day praise God
[30:53] marking the beginning of the civil year
[30:54] because the religious year you know
[30:56] there's there was two years there was
[30:58] religious year started in April usually
[31:01] April sometimes March with Passover and
[31:04] went all the way till Feast of the
[31:06] trumpets and then they had that they
[31:08] called it the civil year all right the
[31:15] next example is David was the youngest
[31:18] and eighth son he was chosen by God as a
[31:22] man after
[31:23] God's own heart to give Israel a new
[31:26] beginning after King Saul's failure so
[31:30] we see he was the eighth son God chose
[31:32] the eighth son of Jesse and that's First
[31:39] Samuel 1314 and the part ways after the
[31:42] heart of God is 16 chapter 16 10 and 11
[31:50] alright next one in acts 933 the
[31:53] paralyzed Aeneas I think that's how you
[31:56] say it was healed by Peter in the eighth
[31:59] year of his infirmity as a new beginning
[32:02] of sound health so he got sound health
[32:04] in that eighth year in Philippians 4:8
[32:11] Paulus eight things to meditate upon in
[32:16] order to renew your mind so yeah I don't
[32:19] know if you remember that one that was a
[32:20] real blessing there's eight things there
[32:22] to meditate the things that are holy
[32:24] things that are good of good report all
[32:26] those examples there 8 why list 8
[32:29] because it renews your mind makes it new
[32:31] again and here's the ninth and final one
[32:36] now there was more of course but these
[32:38] were the these were the most clear ones
[32:40] I could show through Scripture and I
[32:43] wanted to put in in the text of the book
[32:50] okay so the next one is found in 2nd
[32:53] Peter chapter 1 the statue perfect man
[32:55] verses 5 to 7 second Peter 1:5 to 7
[33:00] charity is the eighth and final
[33:02] attribute in the stature of a perfect
[33:05] man and that makes you a new creature in
[33:08] Christ Jesus praise God
[33:10] that's according to second Corinthians
[33:12] 5:17 any man that's in Christ is a new
[33:15] creature and so there starts with faith
[33:17] virtue knowledge temperance patience
[33:19] godliness brotherly kindness and then
[33:22] eighth is charity so charity makes you
[33:24] brand new praise God of course as
[33:26] eternal life as well so that's another
[33:28] one for eternity praise God now I 1
[33:34] give a reference here because there's
[33:37] been a lot of critics of brother Branham
[33:40] who said he didn't a reference where he
[33:43] got his works and you know sometimes he
[33:45] didn't but I don't think it was really
[33:46] necessary he wasn't trying to copyright
[33:49] anything and make money off anybody but
[33:52] I'm in a credit clearance Larkin at this
[33:55] point
[33:57] because I looked up covenants in his
[33:59] book and his book is called
[34:01] dispensational truce now of course I I
[34:04] see things a little differently he has
[34:06] seven covenants I believe there's eight
[34:08] just after looking at Scripture and what
[34:11] a covenant means as a compact agreement
[34:14] between God and man and some of these
[34:18] scriptures I got from Clarence Larkins
[34:22] work so I won eight and I give reference
[34:24] in the book to clarence Larkins work but
[34:27] I don't just like brother Branham I
[34:28] didn't agree with everything that he
[34:29] said so as we look at now we'll take a
[34:35] few minutes here as we look at these
[34:37] eight covenants we'll discover when they
[34:41] were initiated their individual commands
[34:45] and their conditions and when they end
[34:51] there's only one that doesn't end I'm
[34:53] sure you know which one it is it's the
[34:55] last one praise God
[34:56] the eternal covenant is what I call it
[34:59] the eternal covenant the new heavens and
[35:01] a new earth praise God so all the other
[35:03] ones are either end or get interrupted
[35:08] but that's the only one I believe that
[35:11] that we would say doesn't end now though
[35:15] as I think about that I start getting
[35:16] other thoughts so some of these things
[35:18] could be subject to change because I
[35:21] think about Abraham's covenant you know
[35:23] being blessed you know through Jesus
[35:25] Christ and so forth so I think of the
[35:28] day David covenant or Davidic I think
[35:31] they call it Davidic covenant how the
[35:34] son of David would sit on the throne
[35:36] without end so that could be an unending
[35:39] covenant as well so bear with me as I
[35:42] meditate on these and just seek the
[35:44] leadership of the Holy Spirit
[35:47] and then some of the covenants had
[35:49] unique signs as we'll see as well also
[35:53] called tokens praise God tokens so I
[36:00] think Lord willing I'll just you know
[36:02] kind of read through my notes here and
[36:04] maybe we'll stop from time to time too
[36:08] to read a few scriptures if my readers
[36:11] could help us out by God's grace okay so
[36:16] the first covenant I believe is the Eden
[36:19] covenant now there's another way to say
[36:21] it
[36:23] add Enoch I'm not sure if that's how you
[36:25] say identic I'm not sure how it's said
[36:28] but there's the covenant from the Garden
[36:31] of Eden and this of course was found in
[36:33] Genesis 1 verses 26 to 30 in Genesis
[36:36] chapter 2 verses 15 to 25 so any
[36:40] scriptures that deal with God giving
[36:44] promises and conditions and maybe signs
[36:49] all those scriptures have to be combined
[36:51] to be his commands for that specific
[36:55] covenant so God initiated this covenant
[37:00] from him down to Adam and Eve and this
[37:03] was before sin of course and her
[37:05] humanity these unclothed humans Adam and
[37:09] Eve lived in complete innocence and
[37:11] obedience and then God gave them these
[37:14] gracious commands he said be fruitful
[37:17] and multiply
[37:20] of course they hadn't yet right that's
[37:22] where Satan came in and injected his the
[37:27] seed of discrepancy into the human race
[37:29] but he they had the commands to
[37:31] reproduce fill the earth with people
[37:34] subdue the earth keep the garden and
[37:37] have dominion over fish birds and all
[37:40] living creatures and part of it man
[37:44] animal were limited to a veg vegetable
[37:47] diet or vegetarian diet that was part of
[37:50] it at the beginning now there was this
[37:53] covenant only had one condition
[37:55] children that's something there's just
[37:57] one condition God only asked him to do
[37:59] one thing
[38:01] of course if any of us would have been
[38:03] in that same situation we would have
[38:05] done it but God made this first covenant
[38:07] so simple just keep one command but we
[38:13] know God had to do it so he could
[38:14] manifest that he was a savior that he
[38:17] was a healer he had all these attributes
[38:18] of love and Savior Redeemer healer and
[38:22] he wanted to manifest all these
[38:25] attributes so he he and his
[38:27] foreknowledge knew they'd fall any of us
[38:29] would have fallen but it just shows
[38:32] humanity's nature their weakness
[38:36] they couldn't even keep one command so
[38:41] their one condition for the Covenant was
[38:43] abstinence from eating from the tree of
[38:46] knowledge of good and evil now in this
[38:51] book chapter 9 I'll go over the true
[38:55] identity of the forbidden fruit because
[38:57] that's the chapter on the mystery of
[38:59] iniquity which we know is Satan just
[39:02] like the mystery of godliness is a
[39:04] person Jesus Christ the mystery of
[39:07] iniquity is in the person of Satan which
[39:11] his spirit of course is the spirit of
[39:12] Antichrist and but through the mystery
[39:16] of iniquity we can see the person of it
[39:18] how it starts in Satan in heaven war in
[39:21] heaven and then come down to earth and
[39:23] then we can see how iniquity started in
[39:26] the Garden of Eden right through Satan
[39:28] possessing the serpent and then causing
[39:32] injecting his seed into the human race
[39:34] and so that will all be tied together so
[39:38] I think it's just a God's Word is so
[39:40] beautiful praise God that mysteries of
[39:42] God must be finished praise God and also
[39:48] in that chapter they'll see the secret
[39:51] of the true identity the forbidden fruit
[39:53] and the true identity of the two trees
[39:55] the Tree of Life and the tree of
[39:57] knowledge and good and evil as long as
[40:00] Adam Eve kept his condition eternal life
[40:03] and peace was theirs and they would keep
[40:06] it within their bodies they would have
[40:08] eternal life within their bodies if they
[40:11] just kept that one condition of the
[40:12] Covenant
[40:13] but we know Eve was beguiled which means
[40:16] deceived by the serpent and she ate the
[40:19] forbidden fruit and then Adam Lee Adam
[40:22] willingly sinned so even she was a
[40:24] little deceived on it but then Adam knew
[40:28] what he was doing he partook of the
[40:29] forbidden fruit and he plunged all
[40:32] humanity into sin slavery because let's
[40:36] read the second Peter
[40:39] 2nd Peter 2:19
[40:42] so there was already some condition you
[40:45] know we know there was the Word of God
[40:48] is forever settled in heaven right so
[40:50] all God's Word was already written in
[40:52] heaven and so Lydia if you read 2nd
[40:55] Peter 2:19 there was a Unruh there was a
[40:59] law there I don't know if it's written
[41:00] or not but there had to been a law that
[41:03] if a man is overcome then he becomes a
[41:08] slave to that man so let me go ahead
[41:16] Superman is overcome of the same is he
[41:19] brought in bondage amen
[41:22] so hopefully you can hear that but God
[41:24] had given Adam all this power and
[41:25] Dominion but then the Bible said four of
[41:28] whom a man is overcome of the same he's
[41:31] brought into bondage so when Adam
[41:34] willingly sinned he became a slave slay
[41:38] a sin slave to the devil right and then
[41:42] sin comes in our members then the sin
[41:47] nature begins in our members that's why
[41:51] Paul calls Satan the god of this world
[41:53] in 2nd Corinthians 4:4 because this is
[41:57] the moment that he took that title Satan
[42:00] deceived Eve and then through that Adam
[42:03] willingly gave in trusting God to make a
[42:05] way for his wife to be redeemed because
[42:09] she was part of him so he took the sin
[42:12] on out of his love right just like we
[42:15] know as a pre figure of Christ Christ
[42:16] took upon our sin that we can be saved
[42:19] and were his wife by God's grace amen so
[42:24] there was that unwritten law
[42:27] of whom a man is overcome he's brought
[42:29] into bondage and so Adam became a sin
[42:33] slave Adam and Eve and all their
[42:34] descendants down to us are slaves to sin
[42:39] so much so that Paul a Holy Ghost field
[42:41] man says the things that I don't things
[42:44] that I hate are the things I do a
[42:46] wretched man that I am right but thanks
[42:49] be to God who gives us victory to the
[42:51] Lord Jesus Christ
[42:52] so we fall in sin but we should have
[42:53] remained there we have because we have
[42:55] power to overcome the sin through
[42:57] repentance through the atonement of
[43:00] Jesus's blood right and a renewed mind
[43:03] praise God now finishing up on this
[43:07] first covenant looks like I probably
[43:09] won't get to all eight tonight so maybe
[43:11] then or really maybe next Sunday we'll
[43:13] get to some of them well by the grace of
[43:16] God
[43:16] so after Adam breaks God's covenant
[43:20] because he knew what he was doing the
[43:23] blessing of eternal life inside their
[43:25] bodies came to an end and death began to
[43:29] set in didn't it wasn't right away
[43:30] because Adam lived over 900 years and
[43:33] then God because of their disobedience
[43:35] he has to dry them can you imagine
[43:38] you're driving your own children out of
[43:39] your presence God had to do that because
[43:42] they broke his covenant he's a holy God
[43:44] right and now their unholy their defile
[43:47] they chose to do that so he has to dry
[43:49] them out and he even sets cherubims even
[43:58] sorry yeah
[43:58] he says chairman's was flaming swords to
[44:00] keep mankind from accessing the Tree of
[44:04] Life now God just did that because he
[44:08] again he wanted to display his love and
[44:10] mercy through all of human history
[44:13] he had a great plan praise God the Bible
[44:16] said God hid it from ages and from
[44:18] generations Christ in us the hope of
[44:20] glory praise God now what's interesting
[44:25] is though even though Adam and Eve fell
[44:29] and Adam particularly plunged all of
[44:32] humanity into sin there are still some
[44:37] commands that remain so the command to
[44:40] do stay the same the command to subdue
[44:44] the earth and have dominion over all
[44:46] living things remained as well because
[44:48] we see Adam and Eve and their
[44:50] descendants doing that after the fall
[44:55] and it says it seems these covenant
[44:59] commands continue unending throughout
[45:02] all covenants including the eternal
[45:08] covenant because the eighth mirrors the
[45:11] sinless condition of the first okay so
[45:16] what I mean by that is that this seems
[45:18] like there may be reproduction in the in
[45:22] the future home but it would be by
[45:23] spoken word there's no doubt going to be
[45:27] subduing the earth during the future
[45:28] home and there's going to be dominion of
[45:33] mankind over everything else even in the
[45:37] future home will take dominion over it
[45:39] so I might see my statements if I'm
[45:43] saying anything wrong please pardon me
[45:44] I'm trying to grow and understand these
[45:46] I've never preached on these these is
[45:48] the first time I've actually preaching
[45:49] on covenants and remember as brother man
[45:56] taught us the future home is God
[45:59] returning mankind to that Eden condition
[46:03] praise God that's why some of these
[46:05] commands will remain unchanged they just
[46:08] may differ a little bit so the only
[46:14] difference is the eternal covenant has
[46:16] no conditions since Satan and sin are
[46:20] finally annihilated praise God amen so
[46:23] the Eden covenant had conditions but the
[46:26] few the eternal covenant the future home
[46:28] I don't believe there's any conditions
[46:30] because the sin will be done away with
[46:32] will have perfect bodies
[46:34] there'll be no temperature praise God
[46:36] there we know Satan to deceive or caused
[46:38] to stumble you won't be overcome by
[46:41] anything except you'll be overcome with
[46:42] Jesus's love praise God hallelujah be a
[46:46] love slave to Christ for all eternity
[46:48] praise God all right let's go about
[46:54] more minutes here that way I'll just
[46:56] teach you bow to our soul or running
[46:58] with to the second covenant and then
[47:00] we'll then everybody have a restful
[47:03] evening and you can think on the
[47:05] covenants right you're gonna chew on
[47:06] this and ruminate on this think on this
[47:10] hopefully through the night by God's
[47:12] grace so the second covenant is called
[47:15] the Adam covenant or Adamic I'm not sure
[47:18] how to say it
[47:19] Adamek I'm not sure how to say it is the
[47:22] Adamek covenant and this was found in
[47:25] Genesis 3 14 to 24 we kind of mentioned
[47:28] this earlier at the end of the other
[47:30] covenant now this covenant is initiated
[47:35] by God again so see God initiated the
[47:38] first one with Adam and Eve he created
[47:39] them and gave them a covenant this one
[47:43] he initiate Segen and he does it with
[47:46] animal sacrifice as you're gonna see
[47:49] most of the covenants this is where it
[47:51] gets a little strange but most of the
[47:53] covenants starting with Adam have blood
[47:56] because an agreement has to be made and
[48:00] so God's way he does he the way God
[48:02] makes an agreement is he tears a part of
[48:05] sacrifice and he has to give an innocent
[48:08] substitute something has to die at the
[48:13] time of an agreement now the reason I
[48:16] said it can be strange is because I
[48:17] can't find any blood shed for David's
[48:21] covenant so children and Saints let me
[48:24] know if you find one I've searched it
[48:26] we'll get to that maybe next week but
[48:29] Nathan gave a covenant to David that his
[48:32] seed and and his seed would have a king
[48:35] on their throne forever but I can't find
[48:39] where God ever instituted that covenant
[48:41] with with a blood sacrifice but all the
[48:45] other ones do except for the last one
[48:46] right the eternal covenant wouldn't need
[48:48] it there's no more sin there's there's
[48:52] no more atonement needed because we
[48:53] already have perfect Laura five bodies
[48:55] say he's done away with that's that's
[48:58] where there may be one thing that's a
[48:59] little strange maybe doesn't meet the
[49:02] same pattern of bloodshed
[49:04] when covenants are given
[49:08] so the second covenant is Adam's
[49:10] covenant it's initiated God initiates it
[49:13] with his own blood sacrifice because the
[49:16] Bible said God made coats of skins to
[49:20] cover Adam and Eve's newly discovered
[49:23] nakedness right because before they were
[49:24] naked and didn't bother them they
[49:27] weren't aware of it but now they've
[49:29] sinned now they know they cover their
[49:30] private parts their loins we cover that
[49:33] through the scripture and so God has to
[49:36] initiate a covenant with them and here
[49:40] Adam and his offspring learn without
[49:43] shedding a blood there's no what there's
[49:45] no remission of sins and forgiveness and
[49:48] that's actually from Hebrews 9:22 so
[49:52] Adam and Eve especially Adam no doubt
[49:55] and then later Abel they had a must at
[49:57] all Abel later they have to learn
[50:01] without the shedding of blood there's no
[50:03] remission of sins Adam Eve must have
[50:05] felt sinful but then they see God kill
[50:09] lambs probably to make them coats of
[50:11] skins and God says I've you must have
[50:14] said I've forgiven you I put away your
[50:16] sins and so this would have been done by
[50:21] faith because the Bible says by faith
[50:23] Adam and Abel and their godly offspring
[50:26] understood how to offer offerings and
[50:31] gifts unto God and that's in Hebrews 11
[50:36] verse 4 the Bible said by faith Abel
[50:39] offered a more excellent sacrifice than
[50:41] Cain so by faith by revelation God
[50:45] revealed to Adam and then to Abel that
[50:48] there's no remission of sins except 5
[50:51] except for self-sacrifice this is part
[50:54] of the second covenant now in this
[50:58] covenant God commanded curses and
[51:01] consequences for the Serpent's beguiling
[51:03] and also Adam and Eve's disobedience the
[51:09] serpent is cursed above all cattle
[51:11] beasts forced to go upon his belly and
[51:14] eat dust so before he wasn't on his
[51:16] belly he wasn't eating dust so note the
[51:20] serpent was upright standing creature
[51:22] before the curse now while speaking to
[51:26] the serpent in genesis 3:15 God places
[51:29] enmity or hatred between the woman and
[51:34] the serpent and their separate
[51:36] offsprings God actually caused them
[51:38] offsprings and now most importantly
[51:43] though God makes a promise he makes a
[51:46] beautiful promise praise God he declares
[51:49] the first prophecy of the cross of Jesus
[51:52] Christ four thousand years in advance
[51:55] praise God and he promises that a member
[51:58] of Eve seed would bruise the Serpent's
[52:01] head while the serpent would bruise his
[52:05] heel Jesus indeed began to destroy the
[52:09] works of the devil and his resurrection
[52:11] was a public triumph over every demon
[52:15] foe praise God hallelujah that's how he
[52:18] began bruising the Serpent's head but
[52:21] don't but let's not forget Paul told the
[52:23] Corinthians Satan will I'm sorry
[52:25] Satan will be bruised shortly under your
[52:28] feet so that's why I children that you
[52:31] still have you and I we still have
[52:33] opportunities to bruise the devil now in
[52:36] order to cast out evil spirits right and
[52:38] overcoming evil spirits so we see Jesus
[52:41] on the cross started bruising right he
[52:44] bruised his head and now we can get
[52:46] victories and we can bruise we can put
[52:49] Satan under our feet as well by God's
[52:50] grace so what a beautiful promise Jesus
[52:57] fulfills on the cross he fulfills God's
[53:00] promise from the second covenant now of
[53:06] course as time goes on this genesis 3:15
[53:10] prophecy is expounded upon and fulfilled
[53:14] through for future covenants Abraham
[53:18] Moses David and then the new covenant
[53:21] okay so this this this prophecy keeps
[53:25] getting more and more information praise
[53:27] God and then till Jesus fulfills it or
[53:30] implements it through the New Testament
[53:33] he said the New Covenant in my
[53:35] praise God now notice Eve is not cursed
[53:42] but her consequences are multiplied
[53:45] sorrow in conception and bringing forth
[53:48] children remember the punishment has to
[53:50] fit the crime so Eve had to do something
[53:53] immoral right intimately immoral of
[53:58] course we know that was adultery with
[54:01] the serpent because that's that was the
[54:05] sin and then the consequence was
[54:08] multiplied sorrow in conception and
[54:11] childbearing
[54:15] additionally God says her desire or
[54:18] longing is to be for her husband
[54:20] which means previously her desire was
[54:23] for someone other than her husband which
[54:25] was the serpent her last consequence is
[54:29] her husband will rule over her meaning
[54:32] Adam is the leader in their marriage and
[54:34] she's under submission to him as taught
[54:36] in the New Testament as well you'll find
[54:39] that first Corinthians 11:3 in Ephesians
[54:41] 5:22 2:24 almost done here by God's
[54:47] grace notice like Eve Adam is not cursed
[54:53] but the ground is cursed for his sake
[54:58] Adam would bring forth food through
[55:01] sorrowful sweaty hard work
[55:04] battling thorns and thistles that was
[55:08] his consequence but he himself wasn't
[55:12] cursed you know God cannot curse his own
[55:15] children now seems like all conditions
[55:21] and commands from this covenant remain
[55:23] to this day God's promise to send Christ
[55:29] to bruise the Serpent's head is the
[55:31] ultimate expression of love to us so
[55:35] right after the very first sin God chose
[55:38] his greatest expression he says I won't
[55:41] send someone else's I don't send someone
[55:44] else he said but out come or I'll send
[55:46] my son
[55:48] through the woman's seed and I will pay
[55:51] the penalty for all the sins of the
[55:53] world and this is spoken of in Romans
[55:56] 5:8 which says but God commendeth or
[56:00] proofs his love towards us in that while
[56:03] we were yet sinners Christ died for us
[56:06] praise God so God in this bathroom after
[56:11] the first most this awful sin here
[56:13] God makes the most glorious promise he
[56:16] says my love will bring you back right
[56:18] yet to drive out his children we said
[56:20] remember I'll bring you back praise God
[56:22] I'll bring you back to Eden hallelujah
[56:25] through my son Jesus Christ hallelujah
[56:27] thank God amen and drive him out every
[56:30] time I let you back in hallelujah thank
[56:34] God for His mercy and His grace in
[56:36] closing the Adamic or Adam covenant is
[56:41] fulfilled and it ends when the eternal
[56:46] covenant begins now here's why I believe
[56:49] this it is fulfilled and ends when the
[56:53] future home begins because it seems the
[56:57] inhabitants of the earth during the
[56:59] Millennium still be farming I don't know
[57:04] if they'll be sweating now actually they
[57:06] would be sweating because they don't
[57:07] have eternal they don't have glorified
[57:09] bodies like we'll have I'm just talking
[57:11] about the inhabitants of the world
[57:13] that's right so there will be human
[57:16] inhabitants on the earth during the
[57:18] Millennium who was still far remember
[57:20] they're going to change their swords
[57:21] into plowshares I believe the scripture
[57:24] says a couple of times and they're still
[57:28] gonna be working the land that's
[57:29] according to Isaiah 65 21 and Micah 4
[57:33] verses 3 & 4 so this this Adam covenant
[57:37] still goes on all the way through the
[57:40] Millennium and also it still scenes
[57:43] there's going to be death in the
[57:45] Millennium - and that's from two
[57:47] scriptures Isaiah 65 20 the Bible says a
[57:50] child may die a hundred years old
[57:52] remembers looking a thousand year
[57:54] millennial period and then also we know
[57:57] there's going to be death in the linen
[57:58] because at the end of it Satan deceives
[58:00] all
[58:00] habitants of the earth right that aren't
[58:03] saved and they come up against the holy
[58:05] city and God has the save by sending
[58:08] down fire and destroys all those that
[58:11] come against the Jerusalem they're the
[58:14] Millennial temple the Jewish temple in
[58:17] Israel so see Church it's a great
[58:21] exercise I'm being I'm being challenged
[58:24] by the Holy Spirit not getting
[58:26] complacent I'm going into things I've
[58:28] never taught before
[58:29] now I'm trusting in the gift of the Holy
[58:32] Spirit to help me rightly divide the
[58:34] word of truth to you to me to all of us
[58:37] and we rejoice in God's covenant praise
