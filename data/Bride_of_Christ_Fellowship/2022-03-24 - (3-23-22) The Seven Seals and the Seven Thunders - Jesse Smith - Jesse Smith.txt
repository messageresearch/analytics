a joy to be a christian praise god amen let's take our bibles tonight by god's grace let's go to revelation chapter eight i'd like to preach on uh the seven seals and the seven thunders you know i felt like i didn't give a good answer on sunday nights i'd like to go over that and i thought boy it's been a long time since i studied that and preached that so we'll try to preach it tonight and then maybe next wednesday we'll finish it we'll kind of see how that goes by god's grace revelation chapter 8 verse 1. i'm looking forward to having brother brian again by god's grace i do want to get to the gideon of course we'll get back to the gideon that was a wonderful time in the lord last week and i just felt like i just felt really uh anxious or not anxious but i just felt burdened i really wanted to go study that and look at the seven thunders again tonight i thought it'd be good also for austin and lena i don't think they've ever heard of seven thunder sermon so let's be the first one praise god and it's been a lot of years since i preached it's been six years since i preached it so i went and checked so it's very simple you know remember brother man makes a statement it's so true god is always revealed in simplicity so people have taken this subject and made it so strange or mysterious and it's sad but you know that's of course that's the enemy getting in there you know deceiving people or uh people not praying enough seeking god enough but it's very simple um now i know it's kind of deep with the the three different forms for each seal we'll go over that tonight i'll try to show as plainly as possible i was working on that last few days trying to make it just really plain i hope it's so plain that even a newly baptized person could receive it so who's the latest one baptized was it victoria who was it nature virtue so hopefully it can be so plain well whoever was the even the littlest one could understand it right i'm going to try to make it so plain here tonight revelation 8 verse 1. let's all read that together on three one two three and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour now go to chapter 10 revelation 10 verse 1 revelation 10 verse 1 and also i'll say this this topic does not pertain to salvation as brother ram preached throughout his whole ministry there are subjects that deal with salvation those are the most important subjects in other words those are the ones we really got fight we have to fight battles over that if people are being lost we have to really rebuke people help people to get people saved but there are subjects that do not pertain to salvation brother brahm said like he said for example some minister might believe jesus will come on a white horse when he returns some believe he might come on a white cloud he said but the main thing is we believe he's coming and he said we shouldn't disfellowship because we don't agree on how he's coming because that doesn't pertain to salvation that pertains to how he's coming so it is here with the seventh seal and the seven thunders it doesn't this doesn't have nothing to do with your salvation this has to deal with the future praise god or we say like this the past and the future it has to deal with brother branham's ministry praise god that's what it has to deal with and so i hope that's made clear here tonight i hope that will be understood and i think as we start i think you'll see that by god's grace the main thing that for salvation that we need is the blood of jesus christ that's what we sang about that's what we should always sing about church praise god hallelujah because that's what purchased our salvation the faith our faith must be in the blood of jesus christ now of course these are deeper subjects as i said as brother craig said i love that statement the seven thunders is as deep as we go so i know it's kind of deep but hopefully it can be so simple tonight that you you won't miss it and uh and then i'll i'll catch it you know of course and have a better understanding of anything that i haven't understood yet revelation 10 verse 1. now i'm gonna read one and two and then we'll all read verse three and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was on his head and his face as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire those last two details are the same of jesus christ in revelation chapter one so this is jesus christ coming down as a messenger and notice angels here or angel rather come down the form of an angel verse two and he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot upon the earth and his left foot up i'm sorry left i'm sorry right foot upon the sea pardon me my and his left foot on the earth that's all read verse three ready one two three and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices now john is seeing this church in a.d 95 or 96 or 800 doesn't matter so around around 100 a.d he sees this he sees the mighty angel come down and he his voice cries and seven thunders utter their voices okay so john sees us and then in verse 4 and when the seven thunders had other voices i was about to write so john heard what it was and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which were which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven so that's we say the holy spirit and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things that which are therein that there should be time no longer okay now that word means delay that there should be no more delay verse seven let's read that together one two three but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now let's have a word of prayer let's bow our heads one more time ask the lord to help us heavenly father we sing because your goodness lord god we sing we will always sing because of what you've done lord and all of our soul gets the same because the holy spirit is in our soul lord god and we're worshiping you we're loving you lord your holy spirit's filling our minds right now god so we give you all of our songs we give you all of our worship and we give you thanks and praise thank you for the blood of jesus christ thank you for salvation lord god the greatest miracle the greatest gift that a mortal man could be given thank you jesus for salvation through your blood and father help us to see the connection here tonight lord god and we just pray lord in jesus name you'll give me grace and strength god and help the people to receive it and father i just pray it's a blessing to them father we know lord you always make all things simple lord you're revealed in simplicity and lord you said also the deep things lord belong to you belong to your children lord and to their children that they might do all the words of the scripture so lord we believe that these belong to us father not by what we've done but by what you've revealed lord god and we're coming by grace asking you lord to reveal them to us afresh lord if we've forgotten or never understood them and lord reveal more lord if we do understand them to some degree we just need your holy spirit to give us wisdom tonight we pray in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated and if we go to revelation chapter 5 you can switch over i just have a few i got plenty of slides but revelation chapter 5. now uh to background this uh in revelation chapter 5 there's a seven sealed book john is transported up to heaven and no one is worthy they announce who can open the book the book has seven seals on it and no one is able to loose that book until jesus christ comes forth no man in heaven no man on earth does that means mary the virgin wasn't worthy that means uh peter was already dead at this time peter wasn't worthy john john was there he wasn't worthy no one was worthy so the only one worthy to open it was the lamb of god jesus christ praise god in church he come and takes the book and that's when john rejoices praise god uh and i want to just uh show you in verse 9 again i read this a few weeks ago but let's look at revelation 5 verse 9. and they sung a new song so now they're worshiping jesus because he's come and taken this book this seven seal book barmy saying thou art worthy to take the book and open the steels thereof for thou slain it has redeemed us to god by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and it's made us unto our god kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth now check just check this for a moment church when jesus takes the book the 24 elders worship him and say you you redeemed us you purchased us back from the enemy praise god you purchased us you bought us on the through the blood of the cross you purchased us and you own us and now you saved us pardon me got a little ugh go off there in my throat pardon me amen and notice they are kings and priests unto god how many know that you're a king and priest under god as well praise god you you're a king you rule over spiritual wickedness and you're a priest you intercede for the needs of the people you're a king and priest unto god okay now if you go to chapter six verse one jesus starts opening the seals he starts loosing the seals off the book in verse 1 he said and i saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and i heard as we're the noise of a thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see now chapter six has six seals opened right so six out of the seven are open and all of them have symbols okay now you go to chapter eight where we were when the eighth seal i'm sorry when the seventh seal opens in revelation 8 there's no symbol all there is is silence in heaven so the angels stopped worshiping jesus for some reason well we know that's because jesus left jesus came down for the rapture praise god hallelujah now i'm going to show the quotes as well to kind of back this up but that's the background so the background of this oh yeah and then go to chapter 10. then chapter 10 this mighty angel comes down with that book that's now open the same one that was sealed up with seven seals is now open and that book is brought to earth and when it's brought to earth it's given to an earthly man and he and then he finishes the mystery of god because the book's open now all the mysteries that were in the book are now preached and revealed and that's when god sent brother branham praise god hallelujah and that's what my latest book is about the mysteries revealed because the bible said the mystery of god is finished so anything that's called a mystery in the book is now finished but then don't forget in chapter 10 verses 8 through 11 john has to eat the book and then it must be prophesied again to every nation kindred people tongue and tribe and the church said so in other words this has to hap this has happened in our day so jesus christ came down in that picture out there that cloud picture in other words his holy spirit now not his body physically but his holy spirit came down and that cloud is actually seven angels but the man said that was seven angels formed that cloud and i got a good sermon on that there's six hours of sermon about that cloud that no man made that cloud out there that picture that cloud it was totally from god it's impossible for man to put that in there and the scientists he's in the message he proves it with six hours of science now it's kind of it's way over my head right it's way over my head but i did uh write down a few notes like these these are powerful statements these this is powerful science some of the things i could understand but not everything but if you want the link to that it's on it's on youtube it's got many thousands of views that was a supernatural cloud it was a vindicated and god vindicated that god sent that cloud down there to fulfill revelation 10 1-6 in other words god was sending his angels down to tell brother brahm to go back to jeffersonville preach on the seven seals and the holy spirit would reveal to him the seven seals the revelation of the seven seals praise god all right and then verse seven says the days of the voice of the seventh angel all the myths the mystery of god is finished so there's one mystery that just means all the bible-defined mysteries are now revealed and they're finished praise god and that's when god took brother branham and now our job is to take all these uh wonderful sermons these revelations around the world and i'm glad to take it to akron praise god i never would have thought you know growing up you know we had the bible i never would have thought that i would have been in revelation chapter 10 verses 8 through 11 praise god but that's where i am i'm doing my part i'm taking it to akron praise god we're inviting them to come in akron praise god all over the world wherever they may see this they go through the internet we're inviting them i say contact me i'll help you find a message church we've done that numerous times people have contacted me numerous times and i've given them a contact for pastors now they've got a home church and now they've been baptized in jesus christ's name amen that's our that's our job we have to prophesy these things again tell the word of god again and god will back up our preaching amen hallelujah now here's just a summary before we get too far i believe the revelation form of the seventh seal has been revealed which is the revelation of the seven seal is that it is the day and hour of the rapture because there's silence in heaven when that seal is opened when the reality form is opened the reality form though of the rapture or the seventh seal has not happened yet because each seal has three forms and i'm going to show it to you hopefully it's so plain that we can't miss it now what do i believe about the thunders i believe the seven thunders have already uttered their voices when brother adam preached the seven seals in march of 1963 the revelation of each seal was a thunder or it was god's voice giving us thus saith the lord on what the seals mean that's that's my humble opinion now i've talked to other brothers and brothers i love and brothers you love and people you know i talk to brothers we love and we've just come to this agreement we might disagree on it i don't believe the thunders are going to come in the future now what i have said though maybe a greater revelation of what's already in the seals will come to us but the reality is is that the revelation form has already been given to us okay so i'm not and church will show it to you plainly the thunders are not anything outside the bible they're everything that's in the bible praise god hallelujah because it was the book it was the book it was the bible that needed the revelation given to the people of god and that's exactly what brother branham gave us praise god brother bran was always pointing us back to the bible back to the scripture praise god and so that's that's that's the the kind of the short-term summary of that now let's prove it here by the by the grace of god we had our texts here now here's why this is so important church now think about this in revelation 10 that seven seal book is now those seals are loose comes down to earth brother branham preaches these seven seals and then he ends this sermon this is the last sermon of that series he said now the vision of the seven angels in the cloud plus the word about the seven seals plus the history plus the church ages all blend together so i could truly say that to the best of my understanding and according to the word of god and the vision and the revelation the interpretation thereof is thus saith the lord now church that's a statement did you catch that he's basically saying that revelation 10 7 is fulfilled thus saith the lord because the seal the the seals are loose and now the book's been brought down to earth and we have the revelation of it praise god that's such a powerful statement praise god it's not like this is my opinion it's thus saith the lord so if we have thus saith the lord then revelation 10 7 has to be already in the past it's already happened the book's already been uh the seals have already been taken off the book the book's been brought down the revelation's been preached to us and we've just got to eat the book how many eating the book tonight praise god amen i'm eating the book tonight amen you're reading the book tonight if you're hearing the word of god and receiving it praise god and it's thus saith the lord now some people stumble with this brother austin and they don't realize brother brahma it just means the revelations were thus saith the lord not every word on the tapes of the seven seals was thus saith the lord i'll give you two simple examples the first one is that brother braham says in the days of elijah only 700 didn't bow the knee but if you read your bible it's not 700 how many is it 7 000. so not every word was thus saith the lord right now i know he corrected it later uh on the second to last sermon questions and answers on the seals but still those other words then on the on those tapes on the sermons were not thus saith the lord but notice what he says here church he says the revelation he says according to the vision the word of god and the revelation see the interpretation of the word of god that is thus saith the lord amen hallelujah now here let me give you another one i found this in a good book i've been reading lately here's another one i'm sorry that's so small yeah sorry it's so small why didn't i make that bigger okay this isn't here he makes another mistake now he says now you know it just goes to show that people without the baptism of the lord jesus christ and are not called to the office of a minister has no business to be in the pulpit that's right now look what now brother mark says something prideful here now watch i could take that person the preacher who doesn't believe in water baptism and now by the help of god i would tie them in such a knot to make their head swim now look what brother ram says he says look i don't care now i don't mean now now that don't sound right forgive me i didn't mean that lord i didn't now i felt him check me on that see i didn't mean to say that way i'm sorry i believe the holy spirit could reveal that to the person some secret that sounds better now look think and think about that that's a prideful statement right oh if i just had a chance to talk to that person i'd make their head swim my brother said oh the holy spirit just checked me on that that wasn't right thing to say he says he said just like you're tuning an instrument when you do something wrong and the church said you can tell it as a christian you said something wrong he didn't like that okay so now there's something on brother ram sermons in the seven seals that god doesn't like and the church said see and we're not going against brother ram we're just showing the reality that you have to rightly divide the brother ram sermons you have to and it's just it's it's wrong people are they're so afraid of people questioning whether they believe the message or not that they they'll say just statements that that are just obviously wrong like you can't correct brother branham and brother brahm has no mistakes and we believe everything on the tape it's so wrong it's so see it's fear motivated and not love motivated amen but perfect love casts out all fear amen let people say what they want they can say whatever they want i know what god says and i believe god's word and god is in our lives and god's cleansing our lives and god's preparing us for the catching away praise god let people say whatever they want but see when but the fact is they'll nev though rarely or never even take a hard question like that they won't even give their time for it they'll avoid it now church what does that remind you of an ostrich and ostrich puts his head in the sand right is that right is that right kids see they just they're scared of something or they're scared so they put their head in the sand they won't even look at it that's fear that's not love jesus didn't do that jesus didn't hide away from questions jesus didn't hide away from that why because he had the spirit of truth and if we have the spirit of truth then we will earnestly fight or contend for the truth now look brother man said see i was putting myself in there like i would tie him in a knot and spin his head around see i in the picture at all now church that will help us when we're witnessing right so that's why i was telling you when we were talking about witnessing you got to be led to witness because if either you can be in it or god's in it or you can both be in it praise god but you want to be in witnessing when you and god are in it praise god he said i don't even want to be myself or nothing it's him let him do the work he does the sound and the trump it's a mute the voice behind it one that gives it a sound all right does everybody see that now there's two examples not every word in the seven sermons or seven seals series was thus saith the lord but the revelations were now here's another example brotherhood said god don't have to apologize to nobody or nothing well brother adam just apologized so not every word of brother branham was thus saith the lord because god never has to apologize brother branham had to apologize i mean it's just it's just common sense i mean and a a two-year-old child can understand that god never makes mistakes all men make mistakes a baby you know not a baby but a toddler can understand that see but because of their fear or they don't want to lose their status or their popularity or their money or their income for preachers because they don't want to lose that then they can't address questions right they're scared to address questions but the real bride of christ is not afraid of questions amen she's been washed in the blood she know who saved her she know who sanctified her she knows who filler with the holy ghost she has the spirit of truth not the spirit of fear the spirit of truth and love and power and a sound mind amen that's what she's got now now revelation 5 showed how christ obtained redemption for us through the cross and resurrection we just looked at that now because of his victory we can become kings and priests unto god we'll reign with him on the earth and we reign over death which is the antichrist horse rider right now we're reigning over death right now i believe church that the pale horse rider is writing now so satan is writing through message churches now trying to bring spiritual death to them now he starts off with deception right but then he leads to wars and then he leads to money-making kingdoms and then he leads to spiritual death and all you have to do is look around and listen to people around the message it happens all the time because they'll go into uh they'll go into awful awful places they'll just go into the awful sins you think how could that happen it's because they don't discern the antichrist spirit they don't fall more in love with jesus like they should like we know they can sell out the anointing that they do have they can try to underfoot the son of god afresh the bible says that's right they can reject their salvation they can lose salvation they can't lose the holy ghost if they're born again but the fact that they do the sins they do shows they were never born born again to begin with now here's where we're going to get to some good uh hopefully some simple things here so christ took the book of redemption and loosed the seals in symbol form to john in 90 a.d so john saw the loosing on the isle of patmos he saw it by vision in 90 a.d there was great rejoicing and worship when the book was taken and loose because it held the mystery of redemption now let's look at the three forms of each seal i tried to say this on sunday now hopefully this is so simple uh now here's the quote there's actually two quotes right two two paragraphs in a row no okay just okay the end of this paragraph and then the start of a new paragraph okay now notice the first seal opened and it went opened in the symbol form it thundered now what about it when it's open in reality form so when oh now just let me get to this when brother adam preached the first seal when he said that was thus saith the lord that was the thunder in other words you didn't hear a thunder but it was god's voice amen it was god's voice giving brother brown the revelation the first seal and when brother brown preached the first seal it thundered in other words god spoke amen hallelujah god's revelation was preached in the first seal that was the thunder but you didn't hear a thunder now i thought it was really fitting that we had thunder on the way to church today did you ever hear that i said only god could plan this i've had that numerous times i preached on thunder and no thunder right out there it's just all god it's god just that's just a simple sign you know nothing nothing too spiritual he said now what about when it's open in the reality form it thundered as soon as the lamb struck back the seal in other words jesus took the first seal off what it revealed not all of itself first it's with god see first the revelations with god then it's in a symbol form john writes it down and then it's revealed three things it's coming forth from the throne first it can't be seen heard or nothing it's sealed up the lamb's blood played paid the price it thundered when he spoke out and when he did a white horse rider started out and it was still a symbol now here's the scripture he's saying now here's what we read this earlier when jesus broke the first seal he said when i when and i saw that when the lamb opened one of the seals i heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see so can everybody see that when the first seal was broken there's a thunder can everybody say amen to that okay when the first seal is revealed thunder in other words god's talking god's voice is talking now here's what i want to show you uh this is one of the simple i've showed this six years ago so it's been a while i don't expect you to remember but i remember because i made it now the first seal was the same the first thunder the symbol form was in 80 90 when john saw it on the isle of patmos but the first seal in reality form started off at the early church it actually started before john if sorry when they got the holy ghost right because right after the holy ghost anointing went out and the line anointing then satan wrote as a white horse rider and it rode all the way to about 385 a.d went until the next anointing came now the revelation of the first seal came on march 18th 1963 praise god that's when we knew the revelation what did that white horse writer brother brown thought it was the holy spirit for so many years amen but when the revelation come it was the antichrist amen so the symbol form of the first seal was 80 90. the reality form was when he that's that writer that the antichrist spirit actually was battling the believers who had the line anointing on them like paul and peter and james and polycarp iranians all those mighty wonderful men of god women of god when was the revelation of the first seal given on march 18 1963 all right the second seal same the symbol was the the year the symbol was given the same year same time but the reality form was the symbol was it was the ox anointing right these are the christians that gave their life more freely there was more of them that died during this time so almost from 400 a.d to almost 600 years they had that ox anointing that was the reality form of the second seal and they battled that red horse rider because that's when the church and state united in rome that was the reality form of the second seal now the the revelation of the second seal though came on march 19th 1963. and that's when it thundered so this was a thunder this was the first thunder second thunder everybody seen the pattern so what's this going to be what's this going to be third thunder good what's this one going to be four thunder very simple it's the voice of god it's god's revelation it's god's speaking his revelation through a prophet amen hallelujah just like he said it's going to be like when a lion roars that's what he said in revelation 10. the line roaring represents a prophet god speaking through a prophet amen the seventh age messenger praise god the seventh angel the seventh church age messenger so the third seal was the third sunder third thunder sorry it's been a long day forgive me third seal was also the third thunder and it thundered on march 20th now the john got the symbol in 80 90 the reality form took place around 1095 to 1906. now we're getting close to our day so that black horse rider the dark ages so the dark ages lasted about you know so most of that time in there okay there's the thunder again so see the church like i told you because god knows what he's doing praise god it's just it's a vindication it's a natural vindication brother brother that's happened like five times now maybe i'm exaggerating at least four maybe three three at the at the least it just happens i don't know what god god he's just so faithful he's just so faithful now the fourth seal was the fourth thunder brother man preached the fourth seal on march 21st 1963. john saw though the fourth seal 86 or 90 a.d and the the the pale horse riders i said is writing now i have a quote brother ram said thus saith the lord he said the pentecostal church is spiritually dead thus saith the lord that means the pale horse rider has written into the ranks of the denominations that's true jesus said they had a name but they live but they're dead the denominations are dead and the church said when you were in denominations and some of you weren't thank god naomi wasn't but most of us were in denominations we were dead our souls were not quickened but when we came this message our souls came alive amen hallelujah praise god this word became alive it became living and it gave me a life and it changed my life amen it transformed my life amen hallelujah and it's transforming lives right now praise god austin alina praise god now let's go on the fifth seal was the the fifth thunder brother man preached on march 22nd john got the symbol same time now the reality form of the fist seal doesn't happen until after the rapture because remember in the fifth seal there's no horses anymore that means the antichrist spirit is done battling the spirit of christ in the in the in the gentile church so this is right after the rapture the the jews are going to say how long lord holy and true dost thou not avenge our blood upon them that are on the earth and the voice the lord is going to say back he's going to say just wait for a season a certain number of your martyrs have to be fulfilled and that's because church the jews put themselves under a blood curse did you know that when jesus was crucified the jews said let his blood be upon us because remember pilate washed his hands of the blood he said this man's blood is not on my hands and the jew said let his blood be upon us that's called the blood curse the jews got the blood curse that's why the jews have been slain over the years that's why they've been hated because they took the curse upon them now god's still going to save them the ones that are obedient to the word of god and there are some of them that have to be filled with the holy ghost to make the bride a bride from every nation because she has to be a full gentile bride with every nation represented like paul had the holy ghost peter had the holy ghost cornelius said holy ghost uh so next the sixth seal it was when brother and preached it was the sixth thunder on march 20 23 1963 the symbol form was 80 90 and the reality form is the future this hasn't happened yet because it's the last three and a half years of the tribulation period that's the sixth seal because remember that's the awful one that's the one when the the moon turns the blood brother austin that's the one when they hide in the dens in the caves and say rocks fall on us and kill us but they won't be able to find death that's the last three and a half years of the tribulation that's when the trumpets blow and that's when the vows are poured out upon all the wrath of god is poured out upon the earth that's the sixth seal the judgment seal now the seventh seal when brother brandon preached the revelation of it that was the seventh thunder and this is the future also the unknown day and hour the rapture and john saw there's no symbol but john heard about it in 80 90. okay now just so you know church i have all this on keynote or a powerpoint i can email it to anybody i've said many things that brother jose so if you're going to study it just let me know i can email to you tonight now here's a real deep well i'd say hope it's not a confusing visual this just shows over the last 2000 years so this is this is right after jesus was crucified resurrected these are all the seven church ages for the last 2000 years and this shows the three forms of the seals okay so stay with me try to look here can everybody say symbol form ready can you say it symbol symbol form was in 80 90. so that's when john saw these four horse riders right here now everybody say reality form ready the reality form was these years when the antichrist spirit battled the true spirit of christ it battled for this many years then it battled this for this many years then it battled the man anointing for this many years and now it's battling that eagle anointing amen that's our anointing amen the flying eagle praise god now everybody say revelation form ready revelation the revelation though didn't come until 1963 they didn't they didn't know what these meant they didn't even know it they just lived by the holy spirit that they lived under but we didn't get the revelation until revelation 10 7 said when it had to come it had to come at the end time praise god that's what daniel 12 says let's go to daniel 12 4. daniel 12 4. yeah i think i read this on sunday didn't i sunday night do you remember that one that's one where knowledge will be increased and he said seal those things up until the end time hallelujah praise god thank you lord only god could orchestrate that only god could do that daniel 12. that's why i just you know that's and i forget to tell some of my friends i forget to tell them that when i preach this god thunders you know i'm not joking it has happened numerous times at least three times at least daniel 12 thank you jesus daniel 12 4 but thou o daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased so see look the bible even says even daniel's prophecy which was about the gentiles and the jews it's sealed up to the end time they won't understand it to the end time but here we have a book of revelation the bible says that it would be it would be revealed in the end time praise god and then it's got to be taken it's got to be preached to every gentile nation praise god hallelujah amen now if you want a picture of that i'll be happy to email you that have i gone over anybody's head yet okay look i haven't gotten to the quotes yet now just you know there are quotes on both sides brother i'm grew in his understanding of some of these things but there's clearly quotes on our side that are to me they they make the they're the only ones that make sense according to the thus saith the lord that we have about the seven seals it's the only one that makes sense now here's just a closer picture so see the symbol form was when john saw a vision i just tried to blow up that picture okay every seal all seven seals have a symbol form except the seventh all we know is that they're silenced in heaven so that's really the only symbol they're silenced in heaven the angel stops singing okay that's the fir every seal has three forms symbol here's the reality form i put them in i put them in numbers for you see the first seal in reality took place during these years the first seal the white horse rider the reality of the second seal took place here there it is again has to be god third seal the reality of that dark horse rider took place during these years that's the reality form the fourth seal was 1906 to the present day that that payless rider is writing today spiritual death and brother ram said he's going to make his final ride and he's going to take all those people to the battle of armageddon that's his final ride that antichrist spirit because remember after armageddon doesn't does the jesus throw that antichrist spirit in the lake of fire now he don't get rid of satan after the next thousand years but he gets rid of that and that beast there it is right there you have that beast amen he takes his final ride in the pope antichrist and at the end at armageddon he takes the pope antichrist and he throws him in the fire that's his final ride okay now the fifth seal is after the rapture the six seals the last three and a half years the tribulation the seven seals the day and now the rapture so the this one this one's out of order right here but it doesn't matter because seven always represents completion seven has to be completion and if you look at the scripture what else would make heaven silent and the bible says in first thessalonians 4 that jesus will come down and meet us in the air amen praise god he's got to leave heaven that body has to leave heaven it's got to come down and meet his bride in the air praise god like isaac met rebecca out in the field not in the house but in the field praise god amen and the revelation form of the seven seals came in 1963. now there were so many things brother there's things i'm forgetting now brother jose bought me a book about 1963 there were so many important things about 1963 i forgot i forgot him now but there's numerous just things started going crazy after 1963. the enemy was fighting against the truth and the revelation there were so many uh awful sinful things that happened in america and around the world after 63. now some of them are like abortion you know no prayer in school no no no bible reading in school some of those but after 63 it's like everything went down you could it's proven by educational studies and everything we've seen them even kent hovind who's not even a message believer he's like a creationist guy even he had charts and it started in the 63 it started going down all the test scores all the stds went up all the all the murders everything something happened in 63. praise god so now it seems like uh this is a little deeper here i just thought i'd share this i don't know why hopefully this doesn't throw anybody off here it seems john saw this seven seal vision in 90 a.d but it was a vision of what would take place in reality in 1963. so here's what i mean in 1963 i believe in heaven now they're they're not they're not bound by our years but i believe in heaven that was when jesus actually loosed the seals in heaven on that book that's my humble opinion right because in march of 63 the book had to come down to earth as thus saith the lord we got the revelation of that book thus saith the lord either that's wrong or it's right well to me it's right because everything in the bible lines up with those revelations amen it has to be and no man has ever had a gift like brother branham praise god no it's not even close praise god not even close no one's had a scriptural ministry like william branham like like i said in my book i got 30 thus the 8th of the lord's in that book 30. who what other preacher has that none of them have it praise god amen we've been visited by god hallelujah amen the mighty angels come down the holy spirit praise god and given us thus saith the lord praise god amen that's exciting amen that's a blessing praise god now that may be over your head if so just push it off to the side that took me years to get to so it might take you years to get to too it took me years to try to understand that now this is my personal opinion because brother rams does state the lord's statements from the seal sermons and also it's his quote about the seven the revelation 10 7 is history uh seem to point to this fact okay now i'm going to uh skip skip past this for time's sake yeah it's almost 8 o'clock austin needs to get to bed too he told me so unless some powerful anointing comes on him but i'm gonna there's a time and season for everything brother there's a time to sleep there's a time to stay awake i mean that sincerely i i understand i've been there before uh i'm gonna skip past this these are just the four horses what they mean i'm skipping past that most of you know that um i just want to stay on the thunders and the seals here tonight now brother branham if you listen to these sermons about the seven seals i would encourage you about austin and lena to listen to those sermons those are some of the most powerful sermons i've ever listened to they're absolutely anointed now like i said there's a few human errors in there but but everybody's human but nothing's wrong with the word as far as i can see as far as i can see the revelations of the seals i'm talking about but in on each sermon brother austin alina you can hear brother branham will tell about that earlier that morning before it came to the preach early that morning when the holy spirit visited him and he said i for many of them sound like this there's a light there's a ball of light hanging in the room and i see a vision of the seal and i spend the rest of it after it leaves i spend the rest of the day writing it down and making sure the bot man searching the scripture making sure this lines up with the whole bible and that's why after the second seal he can get up and he say that's thus saith the lord who does that nobody only a prophet i don't do that no preacher does it only a prophet does that amen hallelujah he said he would be numb for hours afterwards and he would just spend the rest of the day after he kind of coming out of that numbness writing down checking it and he said he said i got to check it by the world word because paul said though an angel teach anything other than what i preached let him be cursed amen so brother and brother ben had to spend the rest of the day making sure what this light showed him what this angel showed him he had to make sure it was the word that's why we love we have a word-based prophet praise god he didn't point us away from the bible he pointed us to the bible praise god now i'm not going to preach on that because i've already read through them i preached them well that's probably been 12 years ago i preached on that that's been a long time now the seven thunders are connected to the seven seals because christ takes that book that had the seals on it and then it's open then the open book after the seven seals are loose it's brought to earth and then the seven thunders are the seven voices of god or the seven revelations uttered on earth okay now i'm gonna skip past uh okay brother branham said revelation 10 1-7 was history meaning the open book has already been brought to earth and the seven thunders already uttered their voices it's already done now here's the quote where he says it it's uh brother austin it's let's see it's uh five months before he died he said what happened on mount sunset he's talking about when the angels met him that cloud out there the angels met him and i think he met them by vision because i don't think he was there when that picture was taken i think he meant it by vision i don't know for sure i'm not god i don't know what happened on mount sunset god was confirming his word that's what all this noise is about notice it's god's fulfilling his promised word again of revelation 10 1-7 and the days of the sounding of the seventh angel's message the mystery of god should be finished the hidden mystery of revelation 10 1-7 the last message to the last church age fulfills exactly in this age saint luke 17 30 even thou shalt be when the son of man is real i could have the girl stand up and say that but i'm not going to i could have you all recite that you'd probably get like 90 right you know because you forget a little bit every week if you don't practice it again the day when the son of man is revealed now he skips a few paragraphs and he says and the god of heaven promised the evening time would have evening lights three years ago this mystery the mystery of what revelation 10 7 it was a prophecy amen what time is it sir but now it's history it's past the promise is fulfilled praise god so brother says revelation 10 1 to 7 is history now he doesn't say thus saith the lord that's why i leave some wiggle room there if i'm wrong but i know thus saith the lord the seven seals have been revealed well that means all the mystery of god is fulfilled well that means revelation 10 7 has to be fulfilled that's why this supports i believe are understanding the best and this is nothing i would argue about this is nothing i would fight about fuss about it's just my humble opinion based upon the scripture and then i get natural vindication as well or you might call it supernatural or vindication whatever you want to call it praise god god is so merciful what time is it sir and what's this attraction god fulfilling his word he's the same yesterday today and forever now there's two brother random quotes after the seals that explain that the voices of the seven thunders were were the revelations contained in the seven seal sermons someone read this again i'm to read these two quotes brother branham says the seven thunders were what the seals were all about in other words the revelation of the seven thunders was the seven seals so the white horse rider that being the antichrist that was the first thunder okay the lion the lion being the uh bold anointing of the holy ghost on the saints the beginning that was the thunder praise god that's the first thunder and it repeats for the rest of the six thunders church they ask him this point blank and look this is a year and five months after he preached the seals have the seven thunders which equal seven mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals but are not yet known to us at as the thunders yet no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about they was to reveal the seven thunders had to utter their voices and no one could make out what it was john knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel the days of his sounding the seven mysteries of the seventh hundreds would be revealed and the seventh angel is a messenger of the seventh church age see and that's all he says but he says they were they were they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about so the thunders uttered what the revelations were of the seven seals in the church age book which brother ram read over he said at least a couple of times he read over this book now the messenger of malachi 4 brother branham and revelation 10 7 brother branham is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children of the fathers how many god have turned heart to the fathers how many have a heart that loves the bible praise god and you you want to see paul's gospel manifested in your life that's what the heart of the fathers means you want to live just like the apostles lived amen the second thing brother brahma was going to do he'll reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals amen it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so praise god so the way i understand that is that the rev especially for us the revelation of the fourth seal showed us that we need the holy ghost anointing the baptism of the holy ghost in our lives would produce an eagle-like character amen saints that could watch and pray saints that could live in heavenly places church you're living in heavenly places praise god amen if you haven't yet talk to a denominational person they're not living in heavenly places like you praise god we battle for a little bit like the eagle will land for a little bit but then we rise up above that praise god we're living above that in heavenly places praise god amen we're not worried about things we're trusting in the living god hallelujah we're not worried about earthly things we're we're flying we're we're soaring we're watching for us coming we're praying we're trusting in the living god that's our anointing the holy ghost anointing praise god and that means our hearts are turned our hearts are turned back to the apostolic fathers so they were revealed and he will reveal them well brother adam's gone so he's not going to come back and reveal him that means they're revealed now here if you uh you don't have to get your bible because i'm trying to it's already 8 o'clock mercy that busy body there's many there's numerous scriptures there's probably probably 10 scriptures that say the thunder a thunder is the voice of god so here's the first one let's read this together one two three ready the lord thundered from heaven and the most high uttered his voice okay so when god thunders it's the voice of god hallelujah job said after it a voice roarth he thunders with the voice of his excellency and he will not stay them with his when his voice is heard god thundereth marvelously with his let's all say together with his voice a thunder is a voice it's a speaking it's a word of god the lord also thundered in the heavens and and his highest gave his what gave his voice hailstones and goals of fire the voice of the lord is upon the waters read this word the glory of god what thundereth the lord is upon many waters the voice of the lord jesus says this as well the bible said therefore uh the people therefore that stood by heard it and said it thunder so people were standing around jesus and god literally spoke from heaven and they said if they we heard a voice and it thundered and they said an angel spoke but jesus answer said this voice came not because of me but for your sakes so even jesus christ said a voice of god thunders praise god amen and look even if you were in heaven if you were in heaven right now in the seventh dimension what you'd be seeing is thunderings voices and lightnings and hallelujah praise god amen in other words heaven is a loud place praise god we just heard a little bit of thunder here tonight there's thunderings lightnings and voices and all kinds of things coming out of the throne of god right now praise god in heaven and there's seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of god praise god those are not seven different holy spirits it's the same holy spirit that was sent to every age and god just represents his ages that way remember he has seven stars seven church age messengers he has seven candlesticks in heaven he has seven fires before his throne as well god loves seven amen here's some more quotes here i'm trying to finish here now let me see how many quotes i got just so i can check one okay that's two three four five okay yeah let's just finish this and then we'll pick up more on the seven seal maybe lord willing next week okay okay so i know quotes uh everybody take a deep breath ready take a deep breath okay here first seal quote now let us find the symbols we found out that or what a thunder means that's perfectly we know the thunder was the voice of god when the seal was opened okay and then let's remember revelation 6 1 when that first seal was opened a thunder went off the noise of a what noise of a thunder so that's why when brother adam preached the revelation the first seal it was a thunder because it was god's voice it was god saying this is the antichrist spirit through deception and he was and he was to go combat against the lion anointing in the saints that's thus saith the lord amen okay so this at the bottom i put this is why i believe each revelation of each of the seven seals was a thunder making seven thunders in march of 1963 john heard thunders at the symbol form of revelation chapter 6 and revelation chapter 10. so john just saw the symbols of revelation 6 in revelation 10 and it thundered then too oh my praise god amen okay now i'm going to skip to this one okay this is the most important quote so everybody just hang on just for a minute please when i saw this i just i just smiled i i don't know if i cried but nature i just smiled i thought oh how come i never i don't remember this i got so happy actually a brother brother jason demars helped me with this one now look look what he says everyone has come to me and said brother branham them seven thunders that the voice uttered and he said write it not see but close it up said that'll be seven thunders that will be revealed in the last days see seven thunders that'll tell us now doesn't that sound real good see but watch what you're talking about when you say that so people would come up to brother branham and pressure him like i'll use austin hey brother brother brother branham don't you think those seven thunders that weren't written don't you think it's going to come to somebody in the end time right and brother bram said but watch what you're talking about he said see that you write it not these seven thunders out of their voices see don't write that but it's to be sealed up in the book to the last days i'm going to go back to brother austin here now some he said some of some someone has been many has been saying to me and theologians said brother branham if the lord with your experience has given you these things for his people wouldn't you be eligible to write a bible yourself and the word if god has manifested you so see in other words brother and i'm saying people have pressured me to write a book and reveal the seven thunders because they're not in the bible but brahm says no that's wrong the seven thunders are in the bible look what he says i said that might be true see but he was trying to catch me so see brother man caught his spirit he's trying to get him to add to the bible i said but you see i couldn't do that he said he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications you see visions you say thus saith the lord you have healings miracles you have a pillar of fire picture you have all these qualifications to write your own bible about the seven thunders i said but look one word cannot be added or taken away hallelujah amen that's a real prophet right there the devil comes up and gives them a proposition hey i got a book idea for you i'll add something outside of the bible and brother brahm says no you i see what you're trying to say but you're wrong you cannot add one thing or take one thing away from this holy book right here he said well well that well then what about them seven thunders you see wouldn't them seven thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation be give to some man i said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking away something from it he said it's all revealed in there and the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was hallelujah amen so the seven thunder or the seven seals opened up the revelation of the seven thunders now we know what the thunders are they're the voices of god telling us what the seven seals said okay i hope everybody catches it here tonight by god's grace that's what it was see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word amen and god's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word blinding some and open the eyes of others it'll always do that and the church said so see we have nothing to worry about the revelation the seven thunders even if we don't got it right it's not outside the bible it's in the bible and so what do we keep doing we keep preaching the bible praise god amen we keep learning more about the bible growing more in the bible studying the bible loving the bible and so we have nothing to worry about if we're born again the holy spirit will only point us to the word of god praise god now i believe i just by god's grace i've studied and prayed about this i fast whenever i study and usually i just people got the right interpretation and i haven't seen anything now i've been helped by numerous preachers over the years i've been helped it just didn't all come down like through prayer i've been helped by numerous preachers over the years but to me this is the best way to make this out it's the it's the only way it makes sense to me the seven thunders can't be anything outside the word they have to be about the seven seals now i'm not going to go on this tonight because uh they you know uh jeffersonville is saying there are things they want to say i disagree uh it's already 8 10. so i better stop here let's stand our feet here god bless the livestreamers love you all
