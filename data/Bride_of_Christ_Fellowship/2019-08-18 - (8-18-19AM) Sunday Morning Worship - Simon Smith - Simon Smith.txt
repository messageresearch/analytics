precious nuggets there help me further understand the gospel understand the word understand the mind of God and right it gives me faith to continue on it gives me faith because the word is perfect sorry I'm supposed to grab this I'm not used to one of these I have a lengthy reading here in the beginning if we could and about 26 verses in a row we're going to read this and if it's a simple little subject but I want to teach this by the grace of God you know I'm just a teacher this morning you just rolled out a little spare tire and I can't take you the whole way the Bill Graham said he said the pastor will see you through we can take a teacher and just roll him and put the little spare tire on the side there and he'll get you about 50 60 70 miles by the grace of God and he's a little lighter he's a little bit thinner walled but all is well he he'll work for purpose let's go to Genesis 41 I wandered on this for almost 20 years what this meant and I'm when the Lord opened up to me I was so excited and it shows you the power the mind of God is preeminent see everything is planned out Saints are gone we don't have to worry about anything we have nothing to worry about everything you want every desire just wait on it it's going to happen I am fully believing that my faith is just right there the things with the very things we desire that are in the will of God are ours even though we cannot have it right now or it looks like it's not possible it trust me it's possible let's start here in Genesis 41 and we'll start at verse 1 and it came to pass at the end of two or four years that Pharaoh dreamed and behold he stood by the river and behold there come upon the river seven well-favored kine and fat fleshed and they fed in a meadow and behold seven other kind came up after them out of the river ill-favored and lean fleshed and stood by the other kind upon the brink of the river and the ill-favored and the lean kine favoured did eat up the seven well-favored and fat kine so Pharaoh awoke so he had this dream and there's seven here and there's seven there and then pretty much equal doubt it even out and then he woke up he went to bed again here a second time in verse five and he slept and dreamed the second time and behold the seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk rank and good and behold seventh in ears and blasted with the east wind strung up after them I don't know further Jessie had taught this already but I actually shared it with him a little kid did he teach this guy would you ever repeat and behold seventh in years and blasted the east wind sprung up after them and the Seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and four years and verse seven and Pharaoh awoke and behold it was a dream and in this dream saying to God he was trouble to use trouble you to dreams and notice the second dreamer seven and there were seven again okay and he called his magicians and his wise man all together there and he said tell me this dream I want to know it and then I man remembered the truth of the butler there and remembered that there was a man in the prison house a Joseph that I could interpret dreams and the interpretation of his dream had come to pass and he was saved he was restored back to Pharaoh's house so if we could turn to verse 22 there and his he was rehearsing this and I saw in my dream and behold seven years came up in one-one stalk full and good and behold seven years with withered thin and blasted with the east wind strung up after them and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears and I told this unto the magicians and there was none that could declare it unto me if we could read together here verse 25 and 26 we'll start on the count of three if we could read this together verse 25 and Joseph said unto the Pharaoh the dream of Pharaoh is one he says God has showed Pharaoh what he is about to do verse 26 the seven good kine seven years and the seven good ears are seven years he says the dream is one so let's say a word of Prayer I just wanted that to sink in let's bow our heads dearly father Lord Jesus slope we just love you Lord we come Lord just as reverently was we could God Lord standing here Lord and Lord Lord we pray a blessing upon the people Lord the hearing of the word God Lord may you empower them Lord may you strengthen them God Lord Lord may you given them revelation or may awaken them God Lord may awaken us Lord this entire bride awake in a slore - what we have to accomplish in this day in this hour Lord things that we have to fulfill individually but it would be with the congregation or be with our pastor Lord brother Jesse Lord is he's over preaching there in another state about eight hours away Lord drive time and or just anoint him accordingly as well or we just love you so much in the name of Jesus Christ amen and I have your seats saints of God back home there at my home assembly the the Lord has been dishing out some very very wonderful things oh I love brother bangs shirt wow that's beautiful brother amen praise God I like that and one of the things I wanted to say this because this so encouraged there's a couple things that have been preached over the pulpit found an ink they have just have been come they've become a standard in my life one of them was a years ago and and all the services are good all but there's certain things that you know that just gave that were just like it was like almost like a steroid a spiritual steroid pumped into you in your ears and one of them I remember years bag brother Brooks had come and he preached and he said he said these are did you know that you're the god of Satan and when he said that that put such the mindset into me then when I tell spirits what to do if there's something I tell that demon what to do what it would where to go and when to go and I believe by faith that he has to listen to us we have to understand who we are and my pastor here we was preaching and he started preaching on Enoch and if you think about this and I want this to just chew on this is just a little bonus nugget that was given to me and it's really incredible the rapture since then anyone believe they're gonna miss the rapture is it is this rapture gonna be tough to make is is this thing gonna be I mean the Prophet said it's gonna take more faith in this age than any other age we need rapturing faith did you know and did think about this and I'm just gonna say it's one sense thing Enoch made the rapture under the blood of bulls and goats this was before the perfect sacrifice came this was before the infilling of the Holy Ghost he made the rapture before all that and if you have the life of Jesus Christ in you it is a it is done we are just waiting for that time all that faith is already within you it'll come don't worry anymore saints of God right now it's time for you to find and me to find our calling to find our spot in the body what we are supposed to do I am very encouraged you see brother Malachi up here playing piano brother amen and faithful here sister Lydia all of us here sitting here this saints of God what but now we're here now we're here to feed we're here to get something from the word of the Lord and then now our to go out and do something with it it's this simple things of God we've already made this rapture it's gonna happen we have nothing to worry about it Laurel or if you if we have the Spirit in us to the Holy Ghost and if the Holy Ghost is in us do you think the Holy Ghost is worried about this rapture he's not worried about it and if we have the Holy Ghost we should not be worried as well everything is gonna work out for our good amen [Music] anyhow I just wanted to share that by the grace of God if I had a topic this morning I know there was a little bit of reading there and that's all right uh III haven't understood this for almost 20 years I've wandered this evenin denomination I was sitting there I was thinking Oh what does this really mean you know what is the what is the real meaning of this and I think here if I had a topic would be fed in famine fed in famine I think back to Amos in fact let me read I want to share this - I actually got invited to a little fraternity reunion from my high school days when I was a real heathen okay and a sergeant and I went to that Friday night and I seen my old fraternity brothers all the way from New Jersey and many various areas in the state and and it was the same old same old I I probably shouldn't have but I brought my wife and I said now prepare yourself you're gonna hear a lot of things and sure enough she's like wow that was a yeah yeah that's how it is out in the world every other word is a swear word every other thought is continually evil it just goes worse and worse one simple even innocent comment I could make and it went downhill just as fast as falling off of a cliff saints of God I am so grateful to be where we are today I don't know if you remember when you were back and you were lost whether it was in a religious condition or a heathen condition but thanks be to God where we are right now is this our ending know who we're going beyond but we thank the Lord Jesus Christ for bringing us all the way out and into this precious word so now in in Amos 8:11 the Bible says behold the days come he says saith the Lord God that I will send a famine in the and since cottony been been hungry there's been a lot of times where you go on to a fast and you put yourself in a famine on purpose so for to accomplish a certain thing to accomplish a desire in your heart you meet an answer from God there is someone on your that's weighing in the spiritual realm and your on your heart and you need it answered or there's Lord I need to know this and all right I need to know that and we put ourselves in a fast and it's like a little miniature famine no eating your drink water your drink maybe a coffee to give you a little caffeine he says but about that God he says I will send a famine in the land a famine is a tough time there's no food the waters scarce others absolutely nothing to eat people are calling out for food or they're crying and the Bible says it was not a famine for bread it was not a famine or for water is not a famine for the porkbelly it was not a famine for least chicken it was not that kind of famine that God was calling for but he was said he says nor thirst of water he says but it was a famine of what but of the hearing of the words of the Lord saints of God there is a famine for the hearing of the words of God right we know these things that are are taking place and have been taking place when I was in denomination on on the Friday nights we had a pretty strong youth group because mean by the cam were the leaders there and we had we're leaders as far as that kind of that time we were and and we would take the youth over to other churches that had Friday night events or Saturday events and we were just always looking for more words something maybe deeper and the pastor would go year-round would preach the same thing again and again the same year and be family money and this or that to love and Jesus loves you in August but I felt like there is always something greater and and I was oh I was in a famine at that time since I was at the famine there he says and the Bible says and when they wander from sea to sea and notice where they're wandering from in this famine from the north which is what dan which is which is the eagle in the eagle day from the north even to the east they would go from what and a try and enter in at the east gate looking for that food there was a famine the land he says and they shall run to and fro to seek the word Lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst correct amen now so we know that there is a famine in the land there always has been a famine for a very long time and I'll say like this there's been a famine for 2,000 years okay if you think about it okay put your spiritual thinking caps on because I want to show this to you by the grace of God now if we look at these there's actually two sets of people in Amos 8 there is a people in famine there's a people who who is looking for the very voice of God for the catch the very mind of God if you read in the Old Testament there's a a wise man by the name of if a fowl and the Bible says that when he spake he spake as the Oracle of God that there was a man that had such a gift of wisdom that when he spake you were actually hearing from the throne then what he says was exactly what you should do absolutely now obviously fell and turned away but in Amos 8 there is a people in looking for the word of God but then we find here in Malachi 4 and verse 1 and behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven we know this is our day notice all review and a re ordered many times and all the proud yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up saith the Lord of a host and it shall leave them neither root nor branch notice there is a dry time there is a what a scorching time coming but unto you that fear the name shall the son shall fear my name shall the son that s you want of righteous arise with healing as winds and ye shall grow go forth and grow up as calves of the stall notice they are being fed absolutely they're growing the only way you can spiritually grow is to be fed spiritually absolutely and we're not just talking milk but we're talking meat we're talking what the Eagle anointing we're talking about the deep things of God we're talking about the simple things of God we need on everything we need to get these eagle wings strong and these feathers just right we need those kind of things a man right absolutely so the people who are in famine and there are people who were growing up what in God's barn a man praise be to God being fed just like how he would a man now let's continue on by the grace of God I don't want to keep you too long on this I know we have two services in job five the Bible talks about in Joe 5:19 he says he shall deliver yet thee in six troubles yay and seven that shall there no evil touch thee right he says inin famine he shall redeem thee from death absolutely so if there is a true saint of God here which we believe we all are you'll not look like as we have we hate to say this but over in Africa they show you the pictures they're the little little babies and their bellies are bulging and and and and they're all the Flies are all over their eyes God have mercy may God bless them and keep them however send them however who anoints someone to go and touch them people amen may God be with him and here but in a time of famine a time of death he says that God would redeem them from that and in war and from power of the sword correct I think about even the the crisis that has hit American America in in the the hills of Kentucky and Tennessee how they're they're just so malnutrition nutrition and how they that the children who grow up just on mountain Dew and they lose all their teeth and just the gall ragged god-a-mercy it's everywhere Saints and verse 22 at destruction and famine thou shout laugh the Bible says neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth they men so here we see that a time of famine God is going to be with you if you're hungry saints of God is spiritually what do you do you eat from this saints of God if you're hungry spiritually what do you do you eat from the very manna from this day you listen to it right you maybe grab a little book and on a certain topic the Prophet preached and you read it and what you're being fed spiritually know it on the face of the earth can do that except they'd be in this message they're starving are they still alive sure many are still alive but they're starving they're starving they're trying to figure it out what gives you strength just reading this or having an understanding of it if you really I think the God knows denomination I read this and I just would not have a clue what this stuff is like Wow it would go in and I forget it in two seconds and I still would have not but now as we read it God over the greater and greater and greater things for you to hear and to understand amen saints of God this rapture is joy that's all it is as you'll see here today by the grace of God will show you understanding of these two sevens by the grace of God what this all meant it's just a simple unfolding it's just a simple revelation it's on is but if you take these things that you have a greater faith in God you have a greater faith in Jesus Christ than ever before hey man now the school here continued on here in uh he says in a time of famine the Bible says in job 5 he says he will redeem you from death he'll keep you from anything that can harm you and how it says here in verse 25 thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great he says and nine offspring as this grass of the earth thou shall come to the grave in a full age look at that full strength amen you're holding mature he says like a shock of corn cometh in his season absolutely ripe for the harvest we know we're not going to see death in this age but we will be taking up Amon in that area praise be to God there was a brother uh brother mike.mccluskey he was over at big Dave's house there a couple of Saturdays ago and he had looked up and he saw one of those they say UFOs and it took off whom it was gone and it was like a certain blue or a purple or something he said he said I said brother you saw chariot right there absolutely right Oh hovering right over big Dave's house just kidding address is now saying sir the names already there just getting address we're live okay because he's coming sister Wendy's house brother God's got one he's for all of us a man by the grace of God amen in Psalms 33 verse 18 behold the I the Lord is upon them that fear them he says upon them that hope and his mercy to deliver their soul from death and they keep them alive in famine the Bible says God knows when famines coming and he knows how to sustain you during famine amen he says also here in proverbs 10 verse 2 through 4 we'll just read verse 3 he says the Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famine you're not gonna starve out Saints Saints of God well brothers we've been eating the same sermons for 50 years saints of God every time I listen to them I get something fresh he keeps showing me things in fact the study is off of a sermon I was listened to on a Saturday my boss made me work and I actually volunteered to work to keep up with a certain job we couldn't be on it and I listened to a certain sermon and this this little phrase jumped out and opened up the entire thing oh my goodness it's amazing it's there just keep listening wait the Bible says to meditate on the Lord think on these things and if you hit that channel it'll open up absolutely the Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famine amen in in a Psalms 34 verse 8 o taste and see that the Lord is good Amen how many here has tasted that the Lord is good thank you God if you ever get in that presence you ever received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll know he's real he's well and alive amen there's no one there's nothing like it praise be to God and I have tasted and seen that the Lord is good at amen and I want him to keep his right she says the right hand his powerful hand onto me don't ever let me go don't ever let you go amen praise be to God yes Oh fear the Lord ye his Saints where there's no one to them that fear him the Young Lions do lack and suffer hunger but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing amen praise be to God look at how many promises are in the scripture Saints God what brother these are just basic scriptures these are promises if you're hungry you can take any one of these and say Lord this is for me and he will feed you any man yeah that's absolutely truth in fact I was actually thinking about stepping down and quit preaching or teaching however four-season just to see if I was in the hand of the will of God and your pastor came in preached number of totally the way he did it rebuked me and then I started preaching that or started studying the next day and he he open these up next to these next two studies here this morning and tonight's so I take it as that he wants me to keep doing Bible studies so we're gonna keep going as saints of God if God says a famine there's always a reason for it he just thought there's families just don't strike because of nothing there's always a reason in Ruth one the Bible says now it came to pass in the days that the judges ruled there was a famine in the land the Bible does not declare what caused that famine but I believe there was something that caused it right weather was a test to test Naomi and to see what would take place or however there was it was a famine sent for a reason amen and if you read the scriptures and this is where we're going to go into tonight and second samuel 21 verse 1 saints of god we're going to break this down by the grace of god and show you the importance of this the bible says in 2nd samuel 21 1 then there was a famine in the days of David three years notice of famine strikes the man who's who's had a heart just like God's own heart a man that worshipped God like God wanted to be worshipped a man that loved God like God wants to be loved he says and there's a famine Atlanta Davis year after year and David inquired of the Lord he said why is this taking place the David could look back and say man why is this Florida you I have done this and I have done this and I have not I served you with my heart and this and asked and the Lord now what did he do what should we always do if you think you're in a famine if you're a dry place this morning if you haven't felt the presence of the Holy Ghost long time why don't you inquire of the Lord the brother or sister Lord Lord show me what's going on a man who would do it a man he's faithful and he David Enquirer the Lord and the Lord said it is for saw and for his bloody house because she is slew that give you nice and tonight we're going to touch on the Gibeonites the Lord has opened up what that is and I want to share because to me it is powerful I die the Lord has been keeping me on a certain topic for about five years and I don't go looking for this stuff he just shows it to me it's so what's he said tonight so this famine hit because of the slaying of the Gibeonites okay and also now here in in in this in second Samuel 24 verse 1 there is another a situation that takes place the Bible says that that if you read and chronicles that Satan encouraged David to number the people right and we know according to the scripture you are not to number the people which they didn't we don't wanna get overconfident you don't have think you're too big and do this and are we only well we got 200,000 men we only need to some 100,000 God mercy where we're in Owenton we got the we got the Ark of the Covenant with us we got who God was us with the Holy Spirit is with us and we were more than overconfident oh we want to be right on the word amen he says and the Bible said that jate that David said told Joab eases go number the people he said go didn't get all the numbers I want to know because we're going to war however and Joanna for the first time actually does something good he says he says David let's not do this but the Bible says that David's a word prevailed over Joab okay and and as soon as Joab and went and numbered all the people the Bible says that though that David's heart was smote after him that he numbered the people right and then of course the man the Prophet GAD come up to David in verse 11 for when David was up in the morning the world Lord came unto the Prophet GAD David's ear go and say it to david thus saith the lord i will offer the three these three things choose one of them that I may do unto these so David numbers of people it's against the word it's against the scripture is actually the Antichrist spirit doing this correct and notice one of the punishments one of these could have been done look in verse 13 so dad came to Dave and told him he says shall seven years of famine come unto thee in the land see so even for one little thing disobedience famine can strike in the land for seven years oh my powerful I think God gave him three options and the second option he says or will they flee three months before thine enemies while they pursue thee and then another option is or that ye be there three days pestilence in thy land and of course David now has to make a choice do we take seven years of famine but remember he knew the scripture they did not have seven years stored up and also he said the three months of fleeing the enemies now look what he comes to he says in verse 14 David said again I am in a great straight let us now fall into the hand of the Lord that is the most best thing you can fall into as a hand of law Lord whether it be for good or for evil for chastisement for spankings or whatever I'd rather be in his hand than in the other hand a man yes law he says four waters mercies are great and let me not fall into the hands of man and of course Israel suffered for this but it could have been a famine could be even worse how many people would have died in a seven-year famine with absolutely nothing stored up oh my praise be to God now we want to move into this we are almost twenty-five minutes in here we're gonna we're gonna keep moving here by the grace of God let's see here another famine takes place in the days of let's see here in the the days of a hab in first Kings 1630 through I believe 33 and Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord at once he became above all that were before him he became a king and it came to pass that he had as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of eath Bell were king of the zidonians and went and served bail and worshiped him saints of God the prophet Elijah said he said neither do no rain shall strike until I call for why did that happen because of this because of the king had gotten off of the word at the end of the famine when God is going to send a rain now notice here in first Kings 18 and 1 and it came to pass after many days that the word Lord came to Elijah in the third year saying go shew thyself in the Ahab and I will send rain upon the earth and Elijah went to show himself in the air and there was a sore famine in the land what it's already been three years now look what the Prophet says in verse 17 it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah and Elisha said there art thou he that troubleth Israel so here am puts all the blame on Elijah and he said I have not troubled Israel he said but thou and thy father's house and that you have committed forsaken the commandments of Lord and thou has followed Balaam see were the cause that entire famine was was getting a false king a king that did not love the Lord God and what God smaller with a famine Amen a powerful example of God's power is anger against not Nicollet ISM but Balaam ISM hey man sure now therefore and then we had the showdown correct now that's another famine that hit the land but remember in the time of famine what's the most important thing it is the food it is the seed it is the word of God spiritually right and the natural it's what the corn wheat they made all the brand those things bread was the staple of life back in those days right now look what he says here in masterpiece 64 705 he says no it'll never be it at harvest time the seed is back to its original condition and you must have all the word in order to be the seed now there was a there's a quote they hit that that just really just opened us up to me saints of God Jesus said the things that I do you shall do also right and greater things let me ask you a question if Jesus Christ is the original seed what was Luther what was Wesley what was what was all those seven Church Ages was that Jesus Christ let me show you what the Prophet said on this but I'm gonna read us a couple scriptures here in John 6:63 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth absolutely nothing that's not a revelation that's simplicity he says the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life see so if he's the word the Word was made flesh right the word the logos became flesh God became flesh he was the word he was the seed if Jesus Christ of that seed and he's the word my now in genesis 3:15 and i'll put any between thee and the woman between thy seed and her seed what was that seed that seed was Jesus Christ that's what that prophecy is about the seed was Jesus Christ he is the original seed now in Genesis 12 verse 6 and Abraham passed through the land unto the place of saitama to land Omori and the Canaanite was in the land and the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said unto thy seed will I give this land who is thy seed the I said it was Jesus Christ we're always looking for that seed remember the Prophet dramatized it when Jesus Christ died for our sins and he went down into the hell there and and he started knocking on Hell's door or Satan's door there and Satan open the door said there you are I thought I had you I thought I had that seed when I killed Abel when I killed the prophets when I killed Jeremiah and and and Daniel and all these men I thought I had you he said but now I've got the real see Toma this is the one the prophesied would take me down and Jesus said I have taken you down amen what my beliefs is my blood is still fresh on Calvary it's just thinking down soaking your sanctifying and it's ready now to fill the people with the Holy Ghost a man that's right Jehovah Jireh 61 209 he says now notice to Abraham at the seat after me and now to his not to his but the seed after him Abraham many sons but the prowess one was through Isaac and through Isaac came Christ the Royal seed the real seed of Abraham was Jesus Christ they might praise be to God sure now I know I'm taking a long way here now in Galatians 3 and verse 16 he says now to Abraham Abraham and his seed he says were the promises made he says not to see the many but of one and to thy seed which is Christ amen okay first John he says whoever says born whoever's whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him what is that is that your gene seed no it says you're his for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God that sees that remains in you is the baptism of the Holy Spirit it is the law very alive very person of God living and dwelling in you and that is the seed that keeps you clean hey man that's right now here he is in question the answer is 59 12:23 listened let me read this again whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for the seed what is the seed of God no the prof is breaking this down I just reiterate it he says the promise Abraham had that this - the seed - the seed what does the see now Christ is Christ the seen of God who's seen is he if he isn't alright he's the seed of God Jesus Christ is the Holy Ghost right now just when the reader at they reiterate that by the grace of God now dealing with the seed one of the greatest revelations you can have if you go to Isaiah 41 for the Bible says who has wrought and done it calling the generations from the beginning he says I the Lord the first and the last the first and the last notice this is a Hebrew the first and the last if you look at Isaiah 44 verse 6 he says thus saith the Lord God the king of israel and his redeemer the lord of hosts he says i am the first he says and I'm the last and besides me there is no God he said I'm the first and the last and as they have 48 verse 12 hearken to me oh he Jacob in Israel by my called I am he I am the first and also am the last day man that's just sum it up now brother side what are you trying to say here he's the first and the last in the old in revelations 1 and 9 John is now penning the book and he's saying and he heard a voice in verse 10 I was in the spirit of Lord's Day and behind me I heard a great voice as of a trumpet right in the spirits and Lord and what does he say the prophet breaks it down here says he says now we hear it now what what was he doing he was transferred from the I love now alabama's now in the spirit over into the Lord's Day and as soon as he got over the Lord's Day he heard a trumpet what was it it's somebody a approaching a great ones approaching trumpet sound somebody's coming he looked he says hallelujah a trumpet and what did the trumpet say he says I am Alpha and Omega now notice the Jehovah of the old he says I am the first he says and I am the last and then now we get to Jesus Christ of the new and the Bible says he's he declared that I am the Alpha and the Omega in the same a man man this fires me up and of course he says in 60s 12:04 that happens vision he says the greatest of all the revelations is the deity the supreme deity of our Lord Jesus Christ you can't get to first base until you believe that even see that's where the promise said you can never be eternity and get to revelations chapter 1 because here he declared in the Old Testament first last but in the new he says I am the Alpha and the Omega the very exact same worldly man he's one of the same did you know this revelation of the Prophet is bringing came by a supernatural vindication yes I want to read this to you the prophet went out he had just just was a couple of months maybe a year before he went out hunting and those squirrels right and the squirrels he spoke to squirrels and he took his limit and this time he goes back out then I turned and I started along a familiar pathway now this is this is him this is God he's bringing him into the church ages he's and what was at the church ages was the seals this revelation had to come before the church ages and the seals then I turn and start along a familiar little pathway by the side of a pasture that crossed over an l-shape in the woods and something strange took place he's breaking this down all my experiences I've never had anything like it I looked at the top of the hill to the left from where I was standing and there come up the top they came three rain three rainbows appeared to him and they're running some 34 - hi first I looked and seen the light I turned back because I thought it may be the Sun arising it was nighttime it's early early morning and there was three rainbows now remember God is trying to teach his prophets something before that he goes into this into the church ages he says and the second thought I was look to the sons and it was towards the south it was easy another thing it was smooth cloudy rain raining all over that was August 25th last Friday morning you know how it was raining and it's smooth clouds everywhere he says and I looked again and they were growing taller and taller three rainbows I took off my hat I set down my gun I started walking towards it with my hands up something just said that's close enough let me tell you something God he has certain rules we must abide to we have certain parameters we are mortals your sons of gods stuck in mortal flesh we are talking about a seriously holy God after this story I'll tell you another Jesus he says and I was close that's that that is close enough I was just going to sit down and take my boots off that I head on to see if I could walk a little closer but I got within a few yards of it I seen the color it's like a fog moving around I stood there for a few moments I was coming right to the top of the little mountain I watched as the three one went right one went left and one down the center running down into a little Bowl like all these three rainbows growing taller coming into this bowl he says whatever it was was alive he said it was moving and making its motions and I just stood there like it was graying dawn amen I turned and look and I screamed out o God what would you have your servant to know God brought the supernatural thing three rainbows into one pot right before the church changes and what does the voice say just then spear Lord came in and said Jesus of the New Testament is Jehovah of the old he only changes Mass from spirit to man and the Prophet said this is the greatest revelation you can have because outside of this is confusion and Satan is the author of confusion we must know that when we see an invisibility that that could be God we see a pillar fire that can be gone a pillar of cloud that could be God if we see Jesus Christ in the flesh that's God it's one in the same person amen and when I see you brother that should be Jesus Christ in the flesh as well Haman and the husband and wife are one praise be to God now in Isaiah Chris last four slash four slash in Revelations revelation 1:8 I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end he declares he's Alpha Omega Alpha Omega this is in Greek in history the word Alpha was used to proclaim the chiefest persons or things there were two places and they called them Mac mass and meskan chai he says and they were called alpha for fine flour so at these two places their names were tied into alpha which meant the fitnah fine flour and there was one chief place taquoia which meant alpha for oil were the best place I can find for oil the best most purest most annoyed oil they could find and they called it alpha for the oil so what is so important about the Alpha the Omega in psychology the Alpha personality is a leadership personality when Jesus Christ came on the flesh he was leading the charge he said I am The Good Shepherd I am the first one in the last I'm the one they came he says I come again alpha personality is a leadership personality to lead something you need to be the best at it this means the alpha females tend to be extremely competitive alpha male personal personalities are likely to cause a stir in the room just by their mere presence or entry and every time Jesus Christ took place or set the foot in somewhere something took place people took notice something supernatural always happen why because he was the Alpha well it's because their impeccable dress or firm handshake or their effortless body language alpha males tend to naturally command respect and attention that's our that's our commander that's our leader Jesus Christ amen now what is the Omega personality alphas number one I'm the best this this I will lead on this this but what is the Alpha personality and Omega personality is one defined outside the traditional hierarchy of dominance they have the intention to neither climb to the top nor give way nor give way to others to rise above them they simply reveal themselves outside of this biological system there is no one better you think of something now you're not the elf of mentality is that I am God there is no ideal for the America the first and the last the beginning in the end that was which isn't is to come him and he's all in everything about praise be to God now I'll read I want to read this quote if Jesus Christ is the Alpha and the Omega what was loser well reason we're we seeing Jesus Christ and Luther in Wesley masterpiece 64 705 the first eve fell and was used in the second Reformation second coming as bringing forth a child now when now has become the true bride again the seed right back to the original again the Alpha and Omega is the same is the same I am Alpha and Omega he never said anything in between why because the Antichrist spirit had already entered into the church and defiled the church through the entire seven Church ages so when you look at these church ages you are not seeing the true seed because what they had false doctrine they had false ideas they were still not manifesting Jesus Christ perfectly saints of God where are we at we are coming up to the Omega R we manifesting you know the prophets of time and time again every local church would have all nine gifts operating in them I'm not picking on you guys my church doesn't have them but remember the Alpha has to become the Omega the Omega has to become exactly like everything we've seen in between was not the true 100% Jesus Christ Jesus can only come back and get the original seed right that is what he's looking for that harvest time the life they were the life they had the life in them the Holy Ghost but when they denominator became shocked or or or leaf or or a branch or something or something like that but we're cut we had to come back to original seed the first ministry and the last ministry is the same do you see where you're coming should this worry you know because we're gonna we're gonna make this rapture in order to make the rapture you have to be become the sea and to become the seed you have to eat all of the word to become the seed he said the first message and the second last message is the same thing why do you think he said read your Bibles and pray read your Bibles and pray eat this word listen to these tapes why because if you take in the nutrients of the seed or the seed life you'll become the seed and when you are fully seed the rational take place amen now in John 12 23 here we're moving here John 12 23 and jesus answered them saying the hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified verily verily I say to you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die there's the Alpha there's the seed there's the original seed that was in Genesis 3 there was in Genesis 12 there was what that was promised all the way through that is the seed except the corn and wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if a diamond for my root this second Eve Saints is going to be exactly like him remember that quote in there says she is him it's gonna happen it's going to happen can we see it we can see it do we can you see it now oh no but we see it my faith a month if we don't see my face what are we doing here why do we even come to church saints of God we know we have to fulfill something something in us drives us and pushes us and pulls us to the house of God to gain these things saints of God we have to understand we have to get it refilling the Holy Ghost we need these gifts operating in a church now let's hit up Joseph here now we know Joseph was a type a perfect type of Christ he was a special one he's born special spiritual saw dreams and could interpret dreams supernaturals brothers hate him we know he was just like Christ right we know the story and how he was loved of the father and rejected thrown into a pitch and all those things but like we read earlier about Pharaoh and the Pharaoh had the two dreams there and the Bible said there one and there was a seven here and there was a seven here first of all I won't ask you a question why was there a famine even coming what caused that famine the Bible says that there be seven good rise up full and hearty calves and corn but then seven weak tender or very not life-giving substances rise up right another day he said there be a seven-year famine coming what caused that seven year family if you turn to Genesis 37 and one something this simple things can cause a famine Genesis 37 1 why did that seven years fan but remember God God had this in a plan he was so loving and kind he's a long-suffering and he had to precede preserve preserve his seed okay he had it all planned out he was not gonna send this famine until he he boosted him up a little bit okay but this is for a reason Genesis 37 verse one and Jacob dwelt in the land where and his father was a stranger in land of Canaan there in the promised land these are the generation of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old hey man as we know is there pastures been preaching that's the type of the bride right was feeding the flock with his brother and the land was the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah his father's wives and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report look at verse 3 now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and we know by the message the our and my things that that coat of many colors was the head that seven colors of the rainbow in it it was actually the Covenant coat it was Joseph's a type of Christ that carried the Covenant with him and what was in that covenant by your stripes you're healed I was bruised here iniquities all healing all redemption lied within that covenant and we know what takes place and worse look here in verse Genesis 37 verse 29 and Reuben turned returned unto the pit and behold Joseph was not in the pit and he rent his clothes and he returned to his brother and said the child is not and whither shall I go and they took Joseph's coat they took the Covenant that had been given to Joseph and they covered was actually just for them as well and they took that coat and kid killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood they put the blood on the Covenant they defiled the Covenant well whose revelations Tana was that coveted angel that came with the rainbow and he dipped the coat in the blood and sent the coat of many colors and they brought it to their father and said we have this we have we found no now Dustin's boat or no saints of God they put innocent blood they they they made this coat it seemed like it was a murder like it was a slaying and the Covenant had an innocent blood on it and if you look at Genesis three nine after the flood I'm sorry Genesis 9:3 every moving thing after Noah gets off the ark look what takes place notice how he ties the Covenant and this together in the book of Genesis 3 every moving thing that showed that limbs shall be meat for you even the green herbs shall I give to you but flesh with life thereof which is the blood thereof shall not you shall not eat and surely your shirt of your blood of your lives will I require at the hand of every beast while required and at the hand of I'm sorry the hand of man at the hand of every man's brother will acquire the life of man whoso sheddeth man's blood by man his shall his blood be shed for in the image of God was made so here if you kill someone you are going to die this was directly after the flood and he makes this promise it becomes what part of the Covenant here in Genesis 9 and verse 9 and behold I established the covenant with you and you and with your seed after you and jump down to verse 12 and this is the token of the cub which I make between you and every creature living creatures with you for perpetual generations I do set my bow in the cloud there's your rainbow so notice how killing of the blood that blood of the Covenant now is tied with the brain bow and the Bible says if you kill a man these diseases he's not bringing judgment upon you so what what caused this famine and Joseph today was they literally they took and this is all type and shadow he could not literally do they could not kill Joseph because they continued on he was the type of Christ but they had to Godhead their work and in their - almost mimic in the death of Christ right so they took the blood of what a goad which Christ became sin they put it on the Covenant and now they're in judgment now notice think about think about this deeper we're gonna get in this a little bit deeper if that blood caused the famine the blood of goat caused a natural famine what about the spiritual so brother what are you trying to say if you look in Leviticus 26 verse 15 you want to go there God is giving all these Commandments to Israel and he says it four times in here Israel few disobey he says and if you are not yet for all this hearken to me I will punish you seven times for your sins if the Israel were not hearkened to the Word of God he would punish them seven times right and then verse 21 if you walk contrary to me I will not hearken and will not hearken to me I will bring seven times more plagues according your sins thing is a plague or a sin he says if you will not read be reformed by me by these things of all countries I will walk Kosh for you and will punish you yes seven times for your sins there's always a seven in little biggest 26 verse 27 to 28 if you and that harken I told me for all this and walk contrary to means then if I will walk contrary unto you all in my fury and I am and I will chastise you seven times for your sins what was this if Israel were to reject Christ reject the Covenant he would punish them seven times where's that come from it comes from the parable in Matthew 21 hear another parable there was a certain householder he planted a vineyard and we know how God sent husbandmen over it and they planted they did well they did well for a season but then when it was time then to receive his fruits the husbandmen would that would send men in right and they would the people that took it took care at that time then would slay the people one by one but now notice at the end of the parable in verse 41 Matthew 21 verse 41 they say to him he will miserably miserably destroy those wicked men and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen so he's going to kill these is going to take these Jews out give it to other husbandmen which shall render me in fruits in the seasons Jesus have you not read in the scripture the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner this is the Lord's doing it is marvelous in our eyes therefore I've seen you the kingdom of heaven shall be taken from you he said what the kingdom of heaven he said he'd punished him seven times what is the kingdom of heaven it is the seven church ages and given to a nation bringing forth fruits thereof he's going to give it to Gentiles so every time in the scripture we they see us soon what does it represent it represents the seven churches correct absolutely study it out that was what was the form the first thing seven wasn't they built a seven can little stick right what was the revelation behind that we see in Revelations 1 the seven golden candle represent the seven churches what in the Gentile correct so now back to the dreams what was this one but remember we're dealing with two sevens not one what was taking place here what was God showing through the scripture there's seven good years coming there's seven good ages coming and then there's seven dry ages coming what does it mean I'm just gonna break this down real simply by the grace of God if you go to Ephesians two and six it's right in the scripture this to me thinks of God this is so exciting this is why this is what that parable this is why they all had to take place in Ephesians 2:6 and has the raises to sit up together and made us to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus and what is the same verse seven that in the ages to come the second seven in Pharaoh's dream remember the dream is one seven good years seven dry years the second seven is the Gentile dispensation any profits rise up in the last seven Church ages of side ours has any new Word of God come forth in the last seven Church ages things how many's gentile here to us us Gentiles how much word of god has come to us this was finished in 98 ad it's been a ye it's been seven Gentile years of famine and the Jews it was all because they stood the Christ they put the blood and put it on the covenant they slew into some blood and God sent a seven church age of famine and now when you're hungry what do you have to eat [Laughter] [Music] amen now let's see what's the first seven years absolutely yeah absolutely let the Holy Ghost lead and guide you in all truth they meant out of the mouths of babes in Ephesians three verse one for this cause i paul the purse the prisoner of jesus christ for you gentiles if you ever heard this the dispensation of grace of god which is given to me you word how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery which as i wrote a for and few words here whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of christ which in other ages remember the prophets said the prophets said in water the water separation 55:1 21 notice just speaking of it in the three decimals we could bring it down to the Old Testament through the seven church ages for the seven strokes and so forth looking to those streaks of blood there the seven different streaks represent the seven Church ages Israel natural and the Gentile Church in spiritual the seven church ages just exactly the same way and Israel had seven church ages as well all of the entire Bible was written in the Jewish times in their church ages do you see why he's Alpha Omega he's Joseph what was Joseph he was there at the beginning he was there he oversaw the entire thing the seven years of fat saints of God we are still in the four storehouses all's we have to do is eat now the bottom think about this this is powerful this was all stored up for us remember from Matthew up into revelations is only a space Matthew I believe was written right before the Ephesian Church age started before 23 ad and the last revelation the book of Revelation was a 98 96 ad so that was 130 about 60 years and 60 years he completed the capped off the book hmm but before that all the way from Genesis to Malachi Jesus Christ Joseph of all Jehovah vol geez of noon was was what he was giving the Jews the feast he was storing up all the food in the time of plenty wide prophet after prophet after prophet after prophet and the word of Lord came down oh sorry and the word Lord came down and they started speaking the word and the scribes are write them down and they recorded and now they had fresh fresh manna all and they stored right from the Prophet restoring and keeping the Word of God but when they killed the Christ when they killed the Christ our Savior it put us into a seven church age famine where there was absolutely no word going in forth and one by one martyrs died for stored food and they would not compromise on the original seed but they had to eat Luther had to eat this March and had to eat this Columba had to eat this what their food for us and the Bible said the time of Joseph that they stored up all the food in the cities hallelujah what in the seven church age cities for what F is this a smart upper dirt where was all that when don't you understand when this church age book when these service went forth it opened up the plan of God the RET you read that church's book one more time Saints that thing just beautiful opens up the entire plan we got step back and see that church age book actually helps you step back and see with this entire things about the seals one seals it reveals the Antichrist spirit within the framework of the church you can step back and see and see it right all the way through here and we're getting off all of us toward food it's so simple there were seven churches before and there's seven churches after just opening up it's just slowly opening up thanks of God what's next the city of Jericho what are those seven silences seven walk I mean I'm talking about really what are they let's hear someone preacher it's coming praise be to God now one thing I really like here at the end did you know that within the seven famine years that's when the money failed they're not our prophets say the system's gonna fall in Genesis 47 verse 23 then Joseph sentence people behold I have bought you this day in your land for fare low now notice at the end of the famine Joseph says I'm giving you extra seed he says lo here is seed for you and ye shall what eat it he said so in the land saints of God there was one last prophet giving a little bit of extra seed that open book now come down and now given to us and now this extra revelation this extra cedar was stored up with a very last scene of the last was now stored up and I've given to you for you to so what into your ground and into the ground of others and saints of God this thing is perfect the Bible is absolutely if you have I wanted this for 20 years and you just have to wait them and wait there and God will slowly open up the revelation of this word praise be to God I hope that was a blessing tonight now look what the Prophet says here last quote everyone stand by the grace of God 63 728 Christ is the mystery of God revealed help this morning Lord as we read the word may the Holy Spirit avail to us that the church might be fully established in the faith that once was once was delivered to the Saints to hold them and may as you give the vision some two years ago to store up the food we're given this little bit of food Saints and now if we eat now we can read this absolutely and the whole but allow the revelation I I find it I I look at something here and then I search the church the message engines and Lord the Lord will usually leave a little something a word or two or three or little sentence or phrase and it open up the entire revelation let's keep eating things of God I want to show you a little a little story here as we close we just had a certain brother come he's very gifted in the spirit and I got a little bit of time with him after service I want to eat a supper within there and I'm you know one of these things we have two Saints at God to become the seed to really become the sea Saints go Jesus Christ had he was he came as a man with no reputation as a servant all humility there was nothing he'd be puffed not one thing up a book there's not some puffed up about it he was just an average humble God and simplicity he brother say these are the thing about Jesus Christ is that he as great as he was he could make himself just so hungry right and I think if we get this I'm going to heat the snow this man very spiritual man he went up and he's he's from Montana and he went up to the mountains and seven peaks that was given her brother branham and and he said on the seventh peak as you get there's actually a plateau before he hit the pea and he says it's like a Razors Edge he's it's only about that wide and it's a two-mile walk this and his sheer sheer it's a two-mile walk on sheer just like a like a knife edge and you have to walk that before you can get up into the peak then and he said he was walking and he was walking on this and I don't know where he said a snowstorm come down and he he just went down into hugs like this he said god I'm gonna die I'm gonna die Lord help me out and he said he says in a moment's time he said he had this much snow on top of him just covered and he was crying out to God and he said he's a Jesus appeared to him I think she was right or behind him or something and he felt the presence of God he's not an angel he's not this was not an Inc remember Brooke Graham said he said the angel that was with him he says was a miner in here this dude was right he said bye he said this was Jesus Christ he said this wasn't he said Simon he said for some reason he said this was such a holy feeling about it he said he was there was so much pressure in that presence he is gonna die first now he said he said brother Simon he said he said as he was abused I'm gonna die cuz he felt just so much power he could not you could and he was so holy he said he said brother Simon he's a to appease that power that they're holding us he says I tried to put everything good that I have done mmm he said it meant nothing nothing all the good that he thought he did the sermons he preached the demons he cast out the people who got healed hear this he said it meant nothing and he said brother Simon then I thought well maybe my bad and he said that meant nothing as well what I'm trying to say saints of God when we come to this we must trust in his blood and his blood alone there is nothing else we can put our trust it is what he did origins and I'm just worried Saints that we remember I caught a while back on how the man said at the end of the Laodicean age it would go back to works thinking I did something for you no no thank you God getting back to the pure seed it is all Jesus Christ do you think the Apostle Paul was puffed up well I'm know he could not say one good thing about him he said he was a prisoner could Peter say anything that I've done this like no saints of God the true bride will be so humble they will realize they have nothing to do with this verse I well I'm just a hey I have nothing to do with it as well saints of God we are just trying to we have to get to the point where we yield armed vessels you know there's a quote in the in the message it seems like it's kind of reversed in the original I been studying that 20 years span from 33 to 53 ad won't wait that's so pure what made that so holy what what causes the fall and I'm talking forever what caused the follow the true church the true church you are the most important thing the laity is the most important thing in fact you are actually the powerhouse if you can get the spiritual gifts flowing in operation saints of God this body here to take over the area they don't turn the world upside down this by the years back I'm gonna tell you this is this is Antichrist spirit years back I heard a sermon and a brother preached and he was preaching he said it's safer than we do not have the gifts in the church unless they go wrong or a while he said it's safer to be like this then they have him and that is not that he is stripping he's robbing the power off of the Assembly of the church the power is supposed to be in the field because how do you know who's coming up here to preach it if this man be full of sin you should be able to call it out you must band together and a local assembly become one the Holy Ghost should be flowing operating what Gifts doing this is where I'm at this is where our church our church we want to get there - we want to produce this the true church is the Black Sea it's not just an anointed man up here miss the anointing the Holy Ghost in the charts yes hey thanks God we have a duty to do I have a duty I'm 90% time I'm sitting in this seat right here I have to find what gifts getting this chair do I can I speak of thumb if they say you do not need to speak with tongues that Antichrist you if they say we do not need speakers and orator pers of tongues that's ain't that Christ because those things are supposed to be amen we have to get to original seed power heads dear honey father Lord Jesus we just love you Lord we thank you Lord for their attentiveness Lord and you know how I'm just so I just TI yes you just bill me to teach like this what I
