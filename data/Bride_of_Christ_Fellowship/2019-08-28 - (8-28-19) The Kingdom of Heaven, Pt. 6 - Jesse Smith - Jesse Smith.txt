going to deepen mother's burn your house more chances the exalted we pray Jesus Christ sir second estate our feet the carpet [Music] did you on the new this would be part six the kingdom of heaven part six it's a very fresh revelation to me that there's there's sixteen parables about the kingdom of heaven and it's a very fresh thought so I've been feasting on that and meditating on it for months and months now and now I feel kind of led to preach on I've been riding on it you're meditating on it and it's been a real blessing so I'd like to bring those thoughts by the grace of Lord tonight Matthew 13 verse 10 Matthew 13 10 we read verses 10 maybe down through 16 by God's grace Matthew 13 10 and the disciples came and said unto Him why speakest thou unto them in parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given now we looked at that on Sunday member and we saw that we have to understand the scripture carefully everybody got to hear the people got to hear it but this didn't mean Jesus wasn't offering it to them he was offering it to them but this means it wasn't meant to them because they rejected it right Jesus came to his own but his own received him not the juice and let his blood be upon us so the Jews got to hear it this means it wasn't predestinated for them because he knew they would reject it because God is loving God he's a fair God he's equitable he's he's just verse 12 for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath we saw that on Sunday how God took Judas's Judas Iscariot sold out Christ so God took his ministry and gave it to Matthias of course we know the Apostle Paul played a part in that as well but Matthias was a tremendous missionary and was a martyr crucified like Christ he was such a godly martyr verse 13 therefore speak I unto them in parables because seeing they see not so here this backs it up the Jews saw it but they didn't see it didn't understand it because he says that next and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross so here's why they can't understand their heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed see they've closed it on purpose they just didn't want to obey it lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart so see their hearts were in love with worldly things can everybody understand that that's why they rejected Jesus they were in love with their money they were in love with their denomination more than they were in love with really with God and should be converted and I should heal them Amen may God as blessing the reading of his word may be seated like I said I'm gonna try to protect my voice here I usually shout and cry and scream and everything like that but I'm gonna try to control myself hopefully tonight by God's grace okay girls I'm gonna try to control myself I got out of control somebody just yell wave that because I don't want to go preaching and I don't have a no voice I want to if they invited me to come I want to have a voice to preach which I gave all my voice on Sunday to you all so praise the Lord it seemed like an America that's really all we got to give right now you know we don't have political pressure we don't have military pressure we don't have imprisonment you know we don't have to worry about that other countries do but our suffering is just really small and more my battles and battles with the cares of the world and the riches of this life and we've got to overcome that now let's look here you can switch over Lydia I got a few slides I want to show this has been like I said in inspiration to me on the kingdom of heaven I've been studying this since probably December maybe earlier and at first I thought there was only seven parables about the kingdom of heaven because you know I'd read Matthew chapter 13 and there are seven parables in Matthew chapter 13 about the kingdom of heaven well I I for some reason I guess in my absence of mind I never thought to go read and search and see if there was any more parables about the kingdom of heaven so in July the Holy Spirit put a little thought of my heart and kind of asked me the question did you ever check if there was more parables about the kingdom of heaven and I went back I found nine more so what a surprise I didn't even have half of them when I went to look and that just shows you no man's effort and then God's correction of man so I was happy to be corrected by the Holy Spirit I always want to be happy to be corrected by the holy spirit so this is part six tonight we'll look at we looked at part four and five on Sunday hopefully that was a blessing on the parable of the talents and the pounds so remember there sixteen parables so I found this out through studying 16 parables I don't know the real definition of the number sixteen I know eight is eternity but sixteen is interesting because in the book of first Corinthians 13 there are sixteen attributes about charity you know it suffers long is kind does not boast is not prideful does not exalt itself does not puffed up there's 16 of those characteristics about charity and jesus said the kingdom of heaven with is within you which is the love of God or the baptism of the Holy Ghost so it's just interesting I feel like again I'm just scratching the surface you know of the number 16 but the themes we saw I'll list them here I put these in orange because I preached on these this weekend so I'm kind of done with those I may go back later you know or I'm sorry we will go back to those in the future and start praying and asking God to show us the gifts in our lives so we can be a help to one another alright so for example like when brother brother Jose was sick sometimes they'll call me or text me and ask me to pray and God has answered prayers for him at times there's other times like if you need someone maybe need a godly word of wisdom you want to contact someone with the word of wisdom right or if you know someone's had a dream and it's come to pass like Amen who have dreams that things I've gone through and it's come to pass and they've told me about the dream and the very scriptures in their dream was the ones I was thinking of and so that's not that's a channel we may be able to use in the future you know God kind of speaking and discerning so you know we would let's say if you had a need on your heart you might say you know brother amen could you pray for me and see if the Lord would give you a dream now I'm not make a make a gift make it operate but just see if God would use that chair because this in church how many know this that's what people did to brother Brandon all the time how many know that why did the people drive across the country why would they sleep in his yard people would camp out and sleep in his yard why would they do it so he could pray for them they could operate the gift right not to make an idol of brother branham but just to recognize that's a gift of God and if there's a genuine gift of God then we want to see if God will speak to us through that gift and if that's the leader leadership of God that could be a good thing right like why did they come to Peter they came to Peter and people got healed just by his shadow touching them it's because they knew he was a godly man and church when we live so close to God people will see Christ in our lives and they will start coming to us right they'll start coming to you as you live a more consecrated godly life and as God starts using your gifts people will come to you and God will use you praise the Lord I believe that so see it's it's it's not like it's not making an idol out of someone's gift but it's recognizing that God placed the gifts in this church for your benefit how many believe that I believe that follow my heart praise the Lord you know there was times I don't know what gift this is but there was times you know John Graham when he was here I would need help organizing things and I could go ask him and he would help me organize them he did agree he just had this gift to kind of or in a kind of a vision to see things and organize things and he helped me organize my life my finances even my well the way I set up my my studying my computers you know he just and that course that might not be a spiritual gift but it is some type of gift you know to be able to organize maybe it's wisdom there are this maybe it's wisdom maybe it's wisdom but he would be able to just kind of lay things out and and show it in a way that I hadn't seen it before and you know there's times that I needed I needed a knowledge about the Word of God and so there was times I would ask brother Brooks questions about the Word of God and and God would answer my question through brother Brooks because perhaps he had a gift of knowledge he could point me to the scripture and I didn't know especially early on when I wasn't hadn't been studying the Word of God very long and so we want to see where God has placed gifts in our lives so that we can be vessels for God to speak to other people praise God how many one how many want your testimony to be that I help people praise God that's what I want my life to be then I help well I didn't live a selfish life but I lived a life where Christ could use my gifts to glorify his great name and if I could and we know this church you know we talk about justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost justification is getting you saved what sanctifies what sanctification sanctification is cleaning you out and setting you aside for service right so now you're set aside but the Holy Ghost is putting you into into service right so when you're sanctified now you're finally set apart now you're to place your your way far apart from your old habit your old lifestyles and just being a new Christian you are so now you're set apart and God can come over here and use you because now you're not close to dirty things you know your your way removed from that you're so far from that and your your godly is sanctified and God can pick you up and use you like a gold vessel praise God or like a silver vessel trust we trust by God's grace we're gold vessels amen we don't want to be on earth in our wood vessel because that was where out what they wrought out we want to be a gold silver we want to be a real vessel of God Gold really amen because gold represents deity in the scripture right because all the deity all the gold was in the Holies of Holies praise God amen now so we will go back to these I just wanted to share a few words about that that was a great blessing this has been a tremendous blessing for me these these parables and and and church one thing we got to remember we are God gave us something valuable don't let the devil ever tell you you're not valuable you're very valuable yeah God gave everybody something whether little or extremely great everybody has a great valuable gift from God so don't let the devil ever tell you well you don't have nothing no God gave everybody something the parable show everybody got some of Christ's money everybody got something divine from Christ it was straight from him amen praise God you've got something inside of you that was straight from heaven hallelujah and it's valuable it's special it's something the devil wants you to waste right the devil wants you to waste it the devil wants you to ignore but you can't bury in the earth you can't cover it over with excuses you can't cover it over a doubt or fear or anger or bitterness you've got to take all that off and you got to invest it in the father's business amen hallelujah so well we'll continue on those but I feel like I want to move on tonight out of the 16 two of them do a sin house in spreads and that will help us these will help us to overcome sin in the kingdom of heaven that's why they're there right now in both cases Church sin was a tiny mustard seed I got a bunch of mustard seed in my office it's such a tiny seed in both cases it's something either small or hidden see that sin is always small when it starts and it always seems to be hiding and that's a mystery see the kingdom of heaven reveals that right Satan's not gonna come in and show himself he's gonna come in real sly real small and we've got to have spiritual eyes to recognize it and that's why it's a mystery of the kingdom of God we need God to reveal to us our wisdom and everything now is so we can recognize Satan's tricks and then overcome it three of the parables deal with the Holy Ghost and the rapture in this one you have to have the the wedding garment without it you're not a part of the wedding so that represents the batson holy ghost the oil that the the five wise virgins had that represents the baptism holy ghost and I joke just look this one up earlier this is the parable where they make three excuses not to come to the wedding supper I gotta watch my field I gotta go check out my oxen and I gotta go I just married a wife you know they the money property and relationships there's all these excuses but the King gets upset he said fine he said go go get the MAME the halt in the blind they say there's still room he said fine go out one more time to compel them go out to the highways and hedges so we're in the age of compelling people that's why we that's why we'll do with that it will do anything we can to try to get people to come to Christ you'll do anything for them you'll invite them you'll pray for them how many people we prayed for to come to church you know I've given out almost 120 books now just try praying for people just to come to Christ to do anything you can do take the loss no matter what the money you lose doesn't matter God will provide amen God sees our sacrifice so see and so a Holy Ghost person will respond to the invitation and they'll come to the marriage supper because he said my room my feast will be full praise God how many have a reservation at that supper praise God Amen now there's five the deal with salvation so god of course he gives us grace for salvation treasure in the field the pearl gray price Labor's in the vineyard the unmerciful servant and the seed cast into the ground I guess you could make an argument this kind of deals with the baptism Holy Ghost I guess I may move that one we'll see because it deals with the three stages of wheat of a wheat grain or wheat plant rather now tonight I want look at these two by God's grace and I want look at these two I kinda already preached on that one I don't know if I'll deal with that one too much that one's really simple but it's it's for the this one's for those people it's for that that Jewish age at the beginning when there was that age of crossover between Jew to Christian juda Gentile that was an important that was a port in Revelation for those early Jews that were trying to understand well we're not under the law not under the curse of the law but we still feel convicted with the law and so what Paul says later is that when we have the holy spirit we live such an obedient life that we fulfill the righteous commands of the law from our hearts amen and we're not under the curse of the law because Jesus took our curse but now we happily obey the law because it's God's nature right God's unchanging so his godly nature from the Old Testament carries over to the new praise God and now that we've got the Holy Ghost we love to obey the Word of God our flesh hates it but our soul loves it amen praise God hallelujah yeah still find that I've been serving God almost twenty actually twenty years this year December will be twenty years I've been serving God and my flesh still hates to obey it sometimes but my soul loves it Ethan I always got to crucify this guy and all the things he thinks and once they do I just got to cast it down in Jesus name Amen now let's I got some quotes so I'll get to those in a little bit but I'll keep that up there for a moment now let's go right through this first parable tonight we're looking at let's look at the wheat and tares some of you it'll be a refreshing course you've already heard it before maybe the children it'll be new because I don't know how much I've taught my children on this one yet I've taught them a lot but I don't know if I've taught them this parable so they may deserve a chance to hear it too right praise God so Matthew 13:24 let's go there the wheat and the tares now in the next book I'm writing which I'm about 42% done almost halfway done I give a a simple one-line revelation for every parable so this is what I felt led to right here for the wheat and the tares the revelation is this every person is either a child of God or Satan and churches are full of them both until the time right before the rapture he's a member right before the rapture member what happened Jesus the King comes in he says oh you don't have a garment you've got to be dismissed never that phrase God and brother Branham calls that the squeeze or the time right before the rapture it's right before the laying down to the mark of the beast when the government's are gonna come against Christianity and it's gonna come through America because of Revelation 13 America is the Beast out of the land so it has to be America it has to be us it's gonna be right here amongst us now doesn't that make it shouldn't make you scared it should make you feel good that God knew you could overcome the say the satanic influence in this government hey hey man now don't get me wrong I pray for Trump I pray for pence I pray for Congress I pray for the Supreme Court I pray for all those people but we know right before the rapture that Satan will use the politics in such a way he's gonna persecute Christians the same way they did in the Roman Roman Kingdom right and that's scriptural because the Bible said the Beast exercised the same power the Beast out of the land as the beast out of the sea and the Beast out of the sea was Imperial pagan Rome Nero Titus all those evil men that pursue the church the Bible said that same power is gonna speak in this United States beast out of the land and the church said this is not brother branham's idea it's not a man's idea it's the Word of God and so God thought so much of you he said ah I'll place Naomi in the United States cuz she'll overcome amen I've got confidence in Malachi Lydia because they'll overcome amen see a lot of countries you know they're good they go through hard times no doubt but we're coming down to the the ramstad members thus saith the Lord a persecution just like pagan Rome just like the Colosseum where the Christians were you know eaten by lions I don't know if it'll come to that it'll probably be guns here in America but the same spirit of persecution is coming to United States it's thus saith the Lord so we've got to be ready we got to be praying watching waiting for the coming of the Lord but we'll know he said you'll know the times in seasons amen thank God he pauses Paul said you know you'll know the times in seasons so the Holy Spirit will keep us in line with the word so that will recognize the time and season of the rapture hallelujah Matthew 13:24 Matthew 13:24 well maybe we only get the way I'm going I don't know if I'll get to done with the first the first parable thank the Lord I know a lot of its review but just just keep enjoying it keep feeding on it and hopefully tonight Lord willing you'll see something maybe you never seen before hopefully tonight by God's grace Matthew 13:24 another parable put he forth on them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tares also so the servants of the householder came and said to him Sir didst thou not sow good seed in thy field from whence then hath it tares and he said to them an enemy hath done this the servant said unto Him wilt thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tares ye root up also the wheat with them verse 24 and here's good good scripture here let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my barn now Christ interprets this parable and verse 36 so go to verse 36 then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciples came unto him saying declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field 37 he answered and said unto him he that soweth the good seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tares are the children of the wicked one the enemy that sowed them is the devil the harvest is the end of the world and the Reapers are the Angels as therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire so shall it be in the end of this world so every see that that's why this is an end time conditions parable every see that Jesus is foretelling what the kingdom is gonna be like at the end of the world that's why this is an endtime parable the same thing he says about the net cast in the sea okay where was that okay yeah there were a verse yeah verse 41 the son of man shall send forth his angels and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and then they do iniquity and shall cast them into a furnace of fire there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth then shall the righteous shine forth as the Sun in the kingdom of their father who hath ears to hear let him hear praise God now let's look at some of these thoughts here in this parable the good seed is not the word remember in the foregrounds the good seed was the word but now the seed is not the word now the seed is you and I seed represents it I guess you could say we're part of the word you know I guess you could say that but the foregrounds was the word seed falling on hearts and it was four different heart conditions but now the seeds are seed children of God that are planted in this earth praise God and Jesus teaches there'll be both wheat God's children and tares Satan's children in the world until the end time God's children you and I came from Jesus aren't you glad you were right there in his soul's pouch of all those seeds you came right out of the heart of God amen you were right there PAC I how do you where he said I want Jesse there I want Kristen there so they can get married and have a family I want the Saints and gone over there sister Beatrice and brother William and he just placed exactly where I'm farmers say they'll just go like this you know but God knew exactly where he was putting you he knew exactly where he put each one of us by the grace of the Lord so true but see they were sewn first the enemies Satan who came in afterwards and so tears or unbelievers at harvest time the end of the world the angels come and separate unbelievers for their fire judgement afterwards the righteous wheat shine forth as the Sun in the kingdom of their father now here's something you need to remember the timeline of this parable is the beginning of Jesus Christ's ministry so 8030 all the way till now or the end of the world whenever the rapture takes place that's the timeline and the reason is because the Son of Man does the planting right and the Son of Man is used over 80 times to describe Jesus Christ in the in the Gospels 80 times he always calls himself the Son of Man people call him a son a man he just keeps referring to himself as the Son of Man so the Son of Man was planting his children ordaining his children as their times and seasons right there at the beginnings and ministry that was Jesus's three-and-a-half year ministry now then the Bible said while men slept right so after Jesus three and a half year ministry he went to heaven and those early Saints started dying right and as they died then what did Satan who Satan came in and the Bible said corrupters or false liars and wolves entered into the flock I remember that from Acts chapter 20 Paul cried for three years saying wolves are gonna come in wolves are gonna come in they're gonna look like sheep but they're wolves remember that's three years he cried I can't even cry two days in a row let alone three years Paul cried for three years saying wolves are gonna come in and eat up the Ephesian Church beware watch out and that's when Satan was sowing his tears he was sending in wolves it was after men slept it was when men died right the Saint started dying and so after that now that both had sewn all their seeds now what grows up we in terror side-by-side now the church is intertwine right with wheat and tares first Jesus during his three and half year ministry plan the good seed the word of the saints the believers while after the men died Satan brought in his lying preachers the false preachers the false apostles Satan transformed himself as a servant of light the Bible says in sin Corinthians 11 and he started devouring the real church and pretty soon tears started taking over the field that's right that's scriptural now let me go the next thought here we'll see how far maybe we'll get pretty far by the grace of the Lord now tears you know our impersonators of wheat and they grow together to the human eye you can hardly distinguish a wheat from a tear they look so much alike the only way to know is as they get older and they get mature so we know there can be tears sitting in any Church and we've seen them especially in the last seven years since 2012 when the believe the sign movement really started taking steam people that would say they believe the Word of God before now they basically speak evil of Christians and see it proves they're the wrong see Church because Esau persecuted Jacob right see the false seed will always persecute the true seed is that right so see when these people started switching sides and now they start condemning brother Branham or they start condemning you or they start condemning anyone who obeys the symbol word of God it shows they're on the wrong side because they're persecuting the elect of God and bride will not persecute bride praise God we'll have troubles you don't have little problems in the church but nothing like that nothing persecuting nothing like blaspheming the Word of God and the revelations of this hour you won't have that amongst real bride members so see tears they look so much like it but at harvest time remember tears will not bow so real wheat vows are the other one they call it nods so so if you don't have a big shout amen hopefully got a nod tonight if you're not shouting name in hopefully you'll not say that's right brother that's right maybe you're tired and you just you can't shout Amen just not because the the tear cannot not delight of the son they just stand there and defy the Sun and if eaten you know tears cause vomiting right convulsions and that's why Jesus said I'll spew you out of my mouth right that's what I told the laity in church age and people can even die if they eat the tear kernels that's what science says and I showed the video years ago remember that I don't know it was some some women overseas when they harvest wheat they don't have combines they squat down like this and they they just take that that that a circular knife I forget what's called the C that might be called and they just cut handful after handful while they're sitting there once they got the handful they just can pick off the tears like that and they just throw them away like that there's because they're trained to it they can see which ones are bound and which ones are tame hen and the angels see Church the Angels know who's on God's side and who's not Amen when you bow to the word when you obey the word when you repent when you get blessed by the Holy Spirit and serve God with all your heart you better believe the angels are watching amen they know who's a real servant of God amen they know who loves the Lord the Angels be able to pick them out right away that's it unbeliever that's a that's a wolf that's a deceiver of men and jesus said you'll know them to by their fruits you shall know them we won't be deceived the true bride always stays with the true word amen hallelujah I'm trying not to scream amen trying to keep my voice under control it's a different feeling it really is I can just usually lose all my inhibitions and just but I can't do that right now now remember they're just like Cain and Abel they look so much alike for a while but then a Cain showed his colors showed he was a terror right Jacob and Esau they look a lot a lot of like for a while but then Esau showed his colors Balaam and Moses they both had visions they both did supernatural things but pretty soon Balaam showed his his colors Judas and Jesus Judas did the same miracles he was sanctified the Bible said he was clean until the end when his money-hungry spear got on him right the devil got on him he showed his true colors sea wheat and tare they look so much alike but at some point they'll go their different ways the wheat will bow nod but the tare will defy the Word of God yes that's right both of them are offered the Word of God Cain God said Cain if you do what's right you'll be accepted I will accept you Cain if you bring a blood offering but he refused he just he got mad and he went and killed his brother see the we will always obey the word bring the right sacrifice have the revelation of true worship hallelujah but the tear will always defy it and hate it and bring the wrong sacrifice amen see now the trouble is the the deceptive part is in Matthew 7:21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter in the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied then a see prophesy tears can prophesy member Caiaphas prophesied he Kyah Caiaphas said one man has to die for this nation and he prophesied that Jesus Christ would die and he was right and brother man said he did that because that was the office of God when you're in that kind of office that anointing gets on you so he prophesied right but yet he crucified and hated Jesus in that strikin he could prophesy one minute he says how much he hates Jesus and he's jesus blaspheming the next minute he's prophesying and he's exactly right oh my thank God for discernment in this hour thank God the way we know is discerning who stays with the word who obeys the word who speaks right of the Word of God see they can cast out devils Judas cast out Devils he did miracles just like the other eleven and then thy name done many wonderful works then I'll profess unto you I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity now Paul says these tears are tears spoken of in the last days they're lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents see children I thank God that you obey me because one of the spirits of this age is children that will disobey their parents so god bless all you little ones for listening to mom and keep doing it now that that's how you know you got the right spirit is that right there's either disobedient to parents because they got the wrong spirit and now of course everybody disobeys a time so that's why we need the correction of the the rod you know we need the correction of I got it I got the whip and to help me by God's grace of course it wasn't abuse you know but it was it was correction ah now he says tears do some good works but they Harbor wicked selfish hearts but they put on a public church membership act but true Christians are purified and they live the same whether they at church or they're at home they live the same all the time tears will go and they'll do miracles in the church on Sunday but come around Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday they're living for the world they're living for themselves they're selfish they're boasters they're proud they're arrogant they're haters of those who are good but see they get and then they know how to get in the anointing right they know how to approach God and worship God with the right sacrifice at least for the anointing but they never obey all the Word of God that's a great mystery but that's why Jesus told this parable because it's one of the mysteries revealed praise God now let's move on here yeah okay I mention that okay now here's they notice to remember the scripture said at harvest time that tears are gathered first before the wheat and brother man tells us that's the economical counsel before the rapture right so the churches are all gonna join well you know it's okay we're all Catholic we're all Baptist Methodist we're all the same anyway that's not true no we're different because we're blood washed we're washed by the blood we have more than just a confession we have a possession amen see they just many churches just have a confession they just say I'm a Christian I was baptized I I love Jesus but we've got to have Jesus himself faint ahead we've got to have the Holy Ghost himself living inside of us we got to have a confession and a possession but many of them just have a membership act they're just acting like Christians when they're really not and they're gathered first so the tears are gathered first in the ecumenical council brother Branham said that they will be comes the churches will unite with the government and they'll be so tightly united together that the churches will influence the government to make new laws that persecute real Christians right but listen Church the whole time those churches and government are gonna be calling themselves Christians right because it's a deception they're gonna be calling the government and church is gonna be calling themselves Christians but where are the real Christians they were gonna probably cost radicals they're gonna call us for nags they're gonna they're gonna probably make us look like hate crime people because we love the Word of God and we hate sin that's the only thing I'm guilty of is hate and sin praise God I don't even hate the people that do it I just hate sin itself right the Bible said we should hate even our own sin we should hate the garment spotted with the flesh the Bible says we should hate our own sin but we don't hate our enemies in fact we love our enemies but we've got to speak truth to them and tell them the truth see but the government the church and government false church and government will unite and that's the gathering the tares first before before the burning now you know this if you haven't let me know in 2016 the Pope called for a uniting of Jews Christians Muslims and Buddhists I got the video if you haven't seen it has anyone not seen it they were not seeing it raise your have you've not seen it ok so mature ok remind me I'll share with you the Pope says those four religions you need to unite and that's not that's wrong the Muslims don't even believe Jesus was the Messiah they believe he's a prophet but they don't even recognize his precious blood was shed for their sins so in other words they reject the atonement they can't be clean they can't be one with God because they reject the way to be clean through the cross of Jesus Christ so how can we unite with a group that denies Jesus Christ there is no unity with that there's only separation a true child of God has to separate that and the only one we unite to is Jesus Christ amen so that was 2016 that's why we've known the rapture is getting closer we know by logic as well you know every day that goes by were a day closer but when we see the Pope who will be the future Antichrist when we see him calling for all the great religions of the world to unite we know we're getting closer Church we just got to keep our eyes open and we got to keep watching and we got to keep praying praise God we won't miss it by the grace of the Lord and remember all the nations will commit adultery with the mother harlot Roman Catholic Church remember that that's from revelation to 22 and 23 and 13 14 18 see they're gonna have this unity and it's a it's an adultery spiritually speaking they say they're married to this right your church but when they don't obey it they're not married to it they're our adulterer against it but when we obey it we're married to it amen and we're keeping our vow praise the Lord we are keeping our vow by keeping the Word of God all right let me just finish up with this one you and I can't always identify every tear some of them we can like like I'm trying to think of a few examples Oh like some of the preachers have left the message over the last few years I told you this one of them was real famous worldwide famous and for years I just wondered how can this guy be a message believer because I had six doctrines he was wrong with he let women cut their hair wear makeup he was wrong on the baptism of the Holy Ghost he persecuted brother Brooks and made fun of his worship in the spirit in other words he mocked the holy spirit and said oh you're making love to Jesus and he said it in a kind of a blasphemous way and there was two other doctrines for all these years of Mike how can this guy be so popular in the message and then just a few years later he left the message and after that I was so happy because I thought my eye was looking at the fruits and I'm scratching my head how can this guy have these kind of fruits and all these people in the message flocked to him I thought it's something wrong with me sister Naomi I was kind of like knocking on my head I said what what's wrong with me how can all these people flock to somebody who breaks the word but see Jesus said by their fruits you shall know them see watch him Bible said mark those who break the word who cause division LARC them be careful around those kind of people and pretty soon I'll show their colors that's right see tears are self loving self-serving false worshipers the only worship to serve themselves they only worship to love themselves instead of loving Jesus Christ the word of God alright okay I may get done with the next one so let's go the next one okay got your Bibles here hope that was a blessing was that helpful by God's grace hopefully that helped you by the grace or see this is the endtime kingdom of heaven parable next one let me turn there I almost got a hundred thousand words on my book I'm not even halfway done so I don't know what's gonna happen with this much but I hope it's a blessing like I told you on Amazon I got a review from a woman named Kate I don't even know her she's like I never knew about you purpose that's a reason God had me write that book because God knew that woman would want to know the truth why does the Bible say about makeup what does the Bible say about long hair was the Bible say so God had to have me write it to help that person out and of course help all the other people who were blessed by it but see that's what we're to do in this hour we're supposed to do everything we can to get the message out compel them amen compel them beg them give them away free do anything you can do try to get people to receive the Christ and try to get them to come to the rapture the marriage supper of the Lamb amen do anything you can do to try to get them to come to the supper praise God okay so it's Matthew 13 47 let's do one more the net cast in the sea I got a few quotes and we'll I'll try it give me about 15 more minutes Lord willing I've done pretty good I've been a good good young man behaving myself here noticed I call myself a young man 38 years old brother man would call me a boy preacher that's what he called people younger than him he was 56 and got him boy preachers that's alright that's you thirteen forty seven so this is the second one it's all about the end time oh my I'm so happy to have the revelations of the endtime hallelujah we can see jesus said they cannot see the kingdom of God but we can see it we can see the kingdom of God is gathering around the word in a real small gathering like tonight it's not rock and roll it's not the big million dollar churches although there could be a big church that was the truth it's not worldliness is not financial prosperity all the time it's not big TV programs and everything like that it's obedience to the Word of God it's being born again the Holy Ghost it's been the real Church of God the book of Acts church amen Matthew 13 47 it's 47 to 50 okay 13:47 again the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind which when it was full they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels but cast the bad away now look what he says this beautiful verse 49 so shall it be at the end at the beginning the end this is an endtime revelation the angel should come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth just like we heard in the other pair of all I like 51 look at this huh I wonder if this I wonder if the disciples were totally honest on this one or not and Jesus said to them have you understood all these things they say unto Him yeh Lord I don't know if they knew that or not I don't know maybe they were just saying that they heard it I don't know it's possible they could have they could have verse 52 then said he unto them therefore every scribe which is instructed on the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is a householder which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old praise God alright now let's look at this one and we'll finish with this parable tonight okay once again we see two different types of people right we see some neither gather into a vessels of angels a collection vessel of angels and we see other that are just cast away bad we see good vessels bad vessels just like wheat good tare bad we see both the same idea and this parable foretells a worldwide gathering under Christianity that requires a final separation between the wick and the just see it's required it has to happen because Jesus said let both grow together and the other parable there's going to be right amongst us we can have true believers here and we can have false believers here only time will tell Oh fruits will tell and we've got to we got to make sure our fruit is the right kind of fruit praise God alright next the net is the universal invitation to Christianity that Christ commissioned his disciples to go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature so the Great Commission the net is the Great Commission preach the good news see it's good news the bad news is you're a sinner I'm a sinner that's the bad news and our sins make us worthy of Hell but the good news is Jesus Christ died for your sins and if you believe in him he'll give you power to become a son or daughter of God that's the good news amen he'll break the chains of addiction he'll break the chains of lust and greed and fear and pride he'll break all those chains and he'll set you free and it'll make you a vessel of honor and it'll make you full of power praise God hey man and remember there's this beautiful member what does the C represent this parable says it's a net cast in the sea what does the sea represent in revelation 17 people's multitudes nations and tongues and that beautiful I didn't see that till recently that bless my heart so the parable the symbols match the symbols in the book of Revelation our Lord prophesied that n would not come until every nation heard the gospel imitation or the gospel net was thrown into every part of the world ocean we'd say praise God remember Jesus called his first preachers fishers of men so the invitation becomes Christian as a spiritual net that draws men to Christ see Jesus throughout the net to Judas and it grabbed him for a while but later he was taken out because of the evil in his heart so just answering the call of Jesus doesn't make you saved it doesn't guarantee salvation because Jesus said many are called but few are chosen praise God all right now this net scenarios for the last days Jesus specifically says this is for the end of the world and it's because Jesus foretold many people would be attracted to Christianity but it's a mere profession of the faith rather than true possession of the faith Jesus said the same thing when he was on the earth he said this people draws nigh to me with their mouths but their heart is far from me in vain do they worship Me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men so that's how you always can recognize a tear or someone who's deceived their doctrine is not a doctrine from the Bible it's a teaching from the thought of man okay like sprinkling at baptism that's not in the Bible that's a doctrine a man letting women preach or cut their hair right letting men divorce their wives and marry two three times and or even polygamy that's a doctrine a man that's not a doctrine of the Bible see it's a doctor and a man and the by Jesus said their worship is in vain Jesus is not receiving that worship because it's not according to the Word of God praise God now remember Paul said deceivers would wax worse and worse so they're gonna get more and more deceptive as we come closer to the end time the false church is going to be more and more like the true church because Paul said it was prophecy it'll be wax worse and worse the deception is going to get harder and harder to to deceive let me just bring this thought out and hope everybody understands here I love the people in jeffersonville but listen most of them have a false doctrine they say every word brother Branham said was thus saith the Lord that's not true that's a lie that's wrong that's a false doctrine but listen Church they are anointed when they worship God anoints them here's proof they had a man died a couple years ago in their service they went and prayed for him and brought him back to life and they had a doctor there in their church he was a church member and he was one of the ones that was up there and verified he died and then he was there when he came back to life a doctor and they got on YouTube you can go on YouTube and look at it they have the it's recorded and everything like it was it would be like a miracle you and I would want to have it was recorded it was I mean that they died they prayed the man came back to life but they have a false doctrine they say pastors shouldn't preach anymore in fact they called our church a Dimas Church they say anyone who doesn't play the tapes is a make believer so they're calling churches like ours make believers but if there's a if there's a question what do we do go back to the word the Bible never says pastor should stop preaching in fact Paul said preach the word be instant in season out of season and rebuke correct with all long-suffering because there will come a time when they'll heat to themselves teachers having itching ears and many shall depart from the faith church we're not departing from the faith we're keeping the faith but see they can have such an anointing and have the wrong spirit and church it's almost idolatry I think some of those people are actually worshiping brother Branham and they're so close to the truth but they're so off as well many things they have right but some things are totally wrong and they name car churches and they they say we're not believers and I'm not saying what they're I'm just saying they're off the word that's what I'm saying and their own fruits will judge them but we are called to recognize and call out false doctrine now how about that how many knew that there was a man raised from the dead at the church they may know that is that new to everybody that was a couple years ago and that's when I started paying attention I was like well let me watch this move let me see what doctrines come out of here and that's why I started writing them down so I could preach him to you so you would know the anointing is great the worship is great that's wonderful and thank God for the miracles we thank God for the miracles listen God does miracles here - praise God thank the Lord for that hallelujah but it's got to come down to the word the word who obeys the word who's got the truth because the Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth that's the promise of God that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost the Word of God guiding you into all truth John 16:13 jesus said when the comforters come he'll not speak of himself he'll speak of me and he said when the comforter comes he'll guide you into all truth saying brother Branham every word he says thus saith the Lord that's not all truth that's being guided away from the truth that's that's I bring in idolatry into the church saying pastor should not preach any more that's wrong that's that's anti word right which we know is Antichrist it's a it's a small innocent form of the Antichrist spirit and I just wanted you to see that that people can have great miracles even around us remember it's gonna get closer and closer and closer so we got to be in the word more and more and more we got to read our Bibles amen we gotta listen to brother brain and we got to take everything he says back to the word we got listen to you listen to your pastor you know listen to the banjos that come through listen to everything that's being preached take it back to the word don't take nothing for granted just obey the word of God fall more in love with Jesus all the time amen now jesus said the Holy Ghost in Matthew 5:45 is like rain he said he makes his Sun to rise on the good and evil and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust that's why so many people are attracted to Christianity they come in worship and they feel good they come and worship and God will heal them but see not only does the rain come to do that to heal them the rain comes to get them to produce the right kind of fruit God wants you to produce fruit not just grow up and get strong that's good thank God for that but God wants you to produce the fruit of the Holy Spirit but see tears or we say like that they just want the rain because it makes them feel good it makes them feel like they're growing but it depends which side you're growing towards it depends what you want to produce with your life do you want to produce righteousness or do you want to produce self-love and and and and and treasures of this world where we stored our treasures we got to store them in heaven hallelujah so see the the rain represents the anointing here that's why everyone's gathered the neck attracts so many because the anointing is so beautiful don't you love the cried worship the Lord I was doing that earlier don't you love to cry and sing and praise the Lord and and feel all clean out in your heart don't you love that people that's why I said you know that's why false church members like that too it's a it's it's a wonderful feeling it's a refreshing feeling but we got it I want more than just the the anointing we got to have the life of the Holy Spirit as well he's God see the Bible says the Spirit breaks the yokes in Isaiah 10:27 so a lot of people like to like experience being free from certain things but we got to be totally free he whom the Sun sets free is free indeed from all addictions right from all us but some people just like to get free from a few things like Jesus told the story of the man who was in his house and and in Matthew 12 and he drove out the demons but the demons after a while I said I'm gonna go back and see if I can get into my house see people will get free for a while but then the demons will come back it'll be seven times worse than it was at the beginning see that's what a lot of people like they like to be free how many times have I seen my cousin different ones they get free from drugs and they rejoice and shout and scream but a few weeks later they're right back into it and it's seven times worse even in my family I've seen that it's heartbreaking but see the reason Jesus cleans you out so he can fill you praise God that's why I cleans you out so he can fill you so you can live in you not just you know a few miracles are a few good feelings you know but a life of life that's fully consecrated and devoted to Jesus Christ amen see that's what we want by the grace of the Lord in Hebrews 6:4 2:8 Paul compares wicked people to briars and thorns so you have thorns in your garden right you have briars in your garden I hate those things I usually smoke over them though but Paul says wicked people are like that they grow up like thorns and briers but they enjoy the rain they feed on the rain they love the anointing of the Holy Spirit but their N is to be plucked up and burned the fire Paul says they can listen terse Paul says this they can be enlightened by the Holy Spirit the Spirit can enlighten their thinking Wow the Bible said they can taste of heavenly gifts you say brother my tasted his good word last night a tear can say the same thing I tasted a good message all that was delicious you know that was such a glorious message tears can say the same thing for a while Paul said they can be partakers of the Holy Ghost they can receive that oh I feel so fresh I feel so clean oh what a great service but then the Bible said they can fall away from living a true Christian life just as a thorn lives off the rain so do sinners live off God's anointing they do but they're not the true sea they're not the churn of God and they do not bring forth godly fruit because they're workers of iniquity for this let's go I'm almost done here Jesus said in Matthew 24:24 he said many false Christ's and false prophets will come among you what does Christ mean is now remember but RAM always emphasized this he said you didn't say false Jesus's because anybody who comes with oh I'm Jesus I'm a false cheesier I'm a Jesus and I've got uh I've got marks in my palms I've got scars in my palm that would that wouldn't trick any real believer right geez then say false Jesus's will come he said false Christ's and Christ means The Anointed they're gonna come false anointed ones right though and the thing is that the hard thing is they got both anointings at times they got the right anointing when they do a miracle but then they leave that anointing and then the knowing of Satan will just like Caiaphas right he's he's putting Jesus on trial he's slapping or spitting out accusing Jesus and then he prophesized at the meeting a few nights later said oh he's the one man has to die for our nation and he prophesized see they got the Spirit of God for a little while but then they reject it they don't want anymore and then the spirit of Satan comes upon him right he said false Christ's in Matthew 24:24 alright let me look at a few more notes here Balaam is that one of the clearest examples Balaam spoke directly to God in extended conversations right in numbers chapter 23 24 and 25 Balaam talks to God and God tells him what to do but then Balaam asked for a second opinion well God can't I go God already said no church you and I don't need to ask God for second opinions what he tells you the first time you need to obey that what the word says the first time obey it just like women preachers well I asked God if I could preach he told me I could well that wasn't the first thing he said because the first thing he said was I do not suffer a woman to a Serpa 40 over a man that's the first thing he said right then yeah you keep begging God and keep begging god yeah and he knows your heart is selfish yeah I let a woman preach later but he won't let them preach the first time just like Balaam he wouldn't let Balaam go the first time but the second time with an evil heart God said fine go if you really want to go and you really want to lust after money go ahead Church Balaam he talked to God face to face but he led to 24,000 people dying remember that at bay o PR God sent a plague and his false teaching that said we're all the same we can all worship you you men you can you can take and sleep with these virgins of Moab it's okay you'd have to marry him God said I hate that I'm not forgiving you 24,000 people died in one day 24,000 see that's a man lets us that's an insane man the Bible said Balaam he could go from talking to God and then he could go to teach and false doctrine just to make a little money that's what they do today that's so many people do today let me show you a quote here I don't remember this quote Balaam anointed with the same spirit that was upon Moses what was the difference the teaching of Moses was perfect the church said see they both had supernatural they both had miracles they both could talk to God they both prophesied but what was the difference Moses taught the people holiness Moses taught the people to obey the Word of God Balaam said oh it's okay to have sex outside of marriage it's okay to worship but we're different churches and no matter what you believe we're all one it's a lie the Bible said here in 2nd Peter it was the teaching of Balaam that Israel received that God never did forgive unpardonable sin not a one of them got saved though they had come out under the blessings of God had seen the hand of God moving by his mighty prophet and seen it exactly vindicated by God the member church all those people that died at 24,000 they all were baptized under Moses and the church said they all got baptized by the prophet Moses I'll say like that because they went through the Red Sea I don't care if william branham baptized you or some big-name preacher they don't matter people like that can still fall away the thing to do is have the Holy Spirit to guide you into all truth because Balaam was known by his false teaching Librium said because another prophet come in with a teaching contrary and disputed with Moses and tried to prove to the people that Moses was wrong and Dathan core and many of them agreed with him and taught the children Israel to commit fornication to go after his organization that were all the same no we're not now Judas you know is another great example he casts out unclean spirits he had power to cast him out he had power to heal all manner of sickness imagine that Judas had power to kill Kay I'm sorry to heal cancer did you know that all manner of sickness Judas could cure because Jesus gave him that authority but then at the Last Supper what he do jesus said what do you ever got to do go do quickly and as soon as he left out Satan entered into his heart see he was a traitor he was lost went to his own place as a son of perdition or destruction Judas fulfilled revelation 3:15 Judas's name was blot out of the book of life how me know that he claimed to be sanctified he claimed to be a believer for those three and half years but then when he sold out jesus said I'll blot your name off the book of life he walked in it for a while but then he rejected it his name got brought it out at one time let me just tell this quick story here we were having a Bible study at my house in Congo Falls this was quite a few years ago case you must have been a real tiny baby at that time and it's a kind of a sad story but I just want to give you a little warning tonight there's a brother I'll just use his first name his name was Robert now there's you know a lot of Robert so oh I just want to give you a little warning here he had just come to the message he was baptized he was all excited he was doing Bible studies all the time but yet he had this hidden sin that nobody really knew about except a few people I didn't know about it and one day in Bible study he was kind of we were just biting the Bible he was kind of bragging on himself like oh I heard from God I heard the voice of God I thought and he said so see I must be that must mean I'm something special it was kind of a brag and the Holy Spirit in me I didn't rebuke him but I said well brother it's right my own house okay I said brother I said Judas heard the voice of Christ and I said Balaam heard the voice of God and he still sold out he still sold out Moses and the Word of God and God is my witness I remember it just really really vividly he stood up and he was you almost punched me in my own house you children won't remember and I'm just and they're like oh lord have mercy what did I do I'm just sharing the word because I knew what the word said anybody can hear the voice of God but it's those who obey the Word of God and what kind of spirit would get mad about that wouldn't you like what if it was true when do you just say oh that's that's good thought right but he got mad at me church within a year he had left his wife got addicted to drugs and slept with other women and got other children now he's in prison in a certain state not this day he's in prison for domestic abuse he's tattooed all up all over he don't even claim to serve God anymore complete heathen all's I did was share one little thing about the Word of God I said Balaam could hear the voice of God Judas could hear the voice of God and I said Cain can hear the voice of God he said would you say you call me a Judas I said no sir I'm just and Simon Church Simon had maybe he'll remember when he's here Simon had to come and stand between us cuz I'm just and they're like I'm not gonna fight you it's my house like I'm not leaving my house he's like one to fight me and Simon has Simon has a brother Robert come on calm down brother Jesse just he's just staring the scripture and I got so heartbroken I felt like I was gonna cry because like I'm just trying to help him out like I'm just trying to point something out and now I can look back sister Beatrice and I can see that was the word discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart the reason he shared about hearing God's voice was a prideful reason not a humble reason he was trying to exalt himself and just a few with like I said within a year gone out of church sleeping with other women different children by different women and got locked up in jail and he wanted to fight other preachers I know other preachers that he wanted to fight so what am I saying I'm saying this what the word says the word says if you've got the Spirit of Christ he'll guide you into all truth you'll fall in love with all the Bible you won't hold any sin in you won't hide secrets you'll obey all the Word of God I felt led to tell that story because anybody can hear the voice of God those women preachers that say they hear the voice of God I don't doubt that one bit but if they if they say they heard God's voice and a total lie that was the devil acting like God's voice that was a demon masquerading with a mask on looking like an angel if it breaks god's word all right see no denomination or movement whether it's charismatic Pentecostal word of faith Apostolic holiness or even the message miracles do not prove a person is saved or or a church is part of the kingdom of God the only way to know Jesus said by their fruit and the only way you can produce fruit is to be born again of the original seed praise God the incorruptible seed of God Peter said in first Peter 1:23 born again of that eternal seed the Holy Ghost amen that's the only way to do it let's stand to our feet here I better stop right there I got one more quote for you here hopefully this will be a blessing to you this is the fourth seal so it's also the fourth seal is the last seal that deals with the Gentiles still on the earth before the rapture look up brother Branham says now being baptized in Jesus name like my friend Robert or in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ rather that that's alright but that's not all of it yet no sir you could be baptized 50 times like that and that don't do a bit of good until that heart it's changed by the Holy Spirit it all has to go together notice it's Christ the Antichrist refuses the true bride doctrine praise God so what made what made Balaam different than Moses false false teaching false doctrine Moses had the right doctor and he had miracles that's what we got we got miracles we use in America last month our brother was healed I don't know if our sister Natalia I don't know if you heard about that or not but we prayed for a man his hips were read or degenerating he was gonna have two hip transplants we prayed for him we spoke life to his hips three days later after MRI the doctor said I don't know how this happened but your hips healed themselves they before the doctor said your hips can't heal themselves and they didn't Christ did it C so we have miracles too maybe different but God we have miracles too but no matter what the miracle is we got to have the miracle of a change life a life that loves the Word of God a life that wants to obey every promise of God hallelujah see we gotta have the real bride doctrine aren't you glad we got it I'm so happy I don't know if I'm any happy for anything else the blood of Jesus Christ has given us the true bride doctrine remember first
