[0:01] so I had to read by myself
[0:04] it was you know and uh if I'd listen to
[0:07] a couple sermons and you know the
[0:09] prophet God taught one called
[0:12] giving respects or something like it's
[0:14] called respects and just how you ought
[0:16] to honor Christ and give him uh all the
[0:20] glory why because we're sitting we're
[0:21] standing here as
[0:25] Sinners who were saved
[0:28] and we were all lost at a time and we're
[0:30] so grateful for what God did in our
[0:32] lives our brother had called me uh
[0:37] yesterday
[0:38] and he asked me he said Simon he goes I
[0:41] don't have the Holy Ghost he goes and I
[0:42] still struggle with smoking he says am I
[0:44] still saved am I saved I said yes
[0:46] brother you're saved right now you're at
[0:48] that justification level I said and just
[0:51] continue to come to church continue
[0:52] reading don't worry about that that'll
[0:54] fall off
[0:55] God's not God there's one thing we're
[0:57] serving God looks at the heart
[0:59] and
[1:00] I said brother you just keep reading the
[1:02] Bible keep praying those things will
[1:04] fall off that's that thing those things
[1:06] falling off are called sanctification
[1:08] and I saw then when he were clean and
[1:10] God sees and you've believed every word
[1:12] and waited for him to clean you up then
[1:14] he comes and fills you with the Holy
[1:16] Ghost so
[1:17] hopefully we're able to bring the
[1:20] modification there and clear that up for
[1:21] him is you know the devil fights
[1:24] everybody and the battles are raging
[1:26] hard so
[1:27] uh let's get into the scripture here if
[1:30] you could turn to uh
[1:33] Romans 11.
[1:42] Romans 11.
[1:48] so Romans 11 here let me get through to
[1:50] myself
[1:52] but there's still a songbook down
[1:56] everybody have a good week this week and
[1:59] as long as you're still standing and in
[2:01] the in this truth
[2:06] we ought to be grateful
[2:09] I heard some people maybe you know some
[2:11] people are struggling and uh some maybe
[2:14] even on the verge of quitting but
[2:16] imagine quitting right now at this time
[2:18] when we're seeing
[2:20] they're literally telling everybody hey
[2:22] this thing's collapsing it's going to
[2:23] collapse the banks are bankrupt look
[2:26] what the prophet said 60 years ago and
[2:27] what he's talking about right then is
[2:30] happening right now
[2:32] so we're literally at that hour it's
[2:33] almost like the vision is catching up
[2:35] and we've got to then once it catches
[2:37] we've got to start walking in that and
[2:39] fulfilling all his righteousness so
[2:41] Romans 11 verse 1 sorry to keep holding
[2:43] there
[2:44] standing
[2:45] Romans 11 verse 1 he says and I say then
[2:48] hath God Cast Away his people God forbid
[2:52] he says for I also am an Israelite of
[2:54] the Seed of Abraham and of The Tribe of
[2:56] Benjamin
[2:57] God hath not Cast Away his people which
[2:59] he foreknew I want you not that but the
[3:02] scripture saith of Elias how he maketh
[3:05] intercession to God against Israel
[3:08] saying Lord they have killed thy
[3:10] prophets and dig down thine altars he
[3:12] says I am left alone and they seek my
[3:15] life but what saith the answer of God
[3:17] unto him I have reserved to myself seven
[3:20] thousand men who have not bowed the knee
[3:23] to the image of Baal hi
[3:27] the image of Baal verse five now notice
[3:31] what now Paul picks up right there says
[3:33] even so then at this present time also
[3:38] there is a Remnant according to the
[3:39] election of Grace
[3:42] amen so let's jump down to verse 16 as
[3:46] well
[3:50] got a little lengthy reading here by
[3:52] guns Greece
[3:53] verse 16. for if the first fruit be holy
[3:57] the lump is also holy and if the the
[4:00] root be holy
[4:02] so are the branches see look we're all
[4:04] depending on that Holy root who's that
[4:06] root who's the root and offspring of
[4:08] David Jesus Christ
[4:10] he says and if some of the branches be
[4:12] broken off and thou being a wild olive
[4:14] tree
[4:15] we're grafted in among them and with
[4:18] them partakers of the root and the
[4:21] fatness of the Olive Tree boasts not
[4:23] against the branches but of thou boast
[4:25] thou bearest not the root but the root
[4:28] the
[4:29] thou will then uh say then the branches
[4:33] were broken off that I might be grafted
[4:35] in well because of unbelief they were
[4:38] broken off and thou stand Us by faith be
[4:42] not high-minded but fear for if God
[4:45] spared not the natural branches take
[4:48] heed lest he also spare not thee see
[4:51] that's why we'll be so humble
[4:53] Reverend because remember
[4:55] well you'll see here in a little while
[4:57] here by God's grace we have but we're
[5:00] not to think any more higher than we
[5:03] ought to verse 22.
[5:07] behold therefore the goodness and
[5:09] severity of God of then on them which
[5:12] fell severity
[5:14] he says but toward the goodness if thou
[5:17] continue in his goodness see how it's
[5:19] just not a one-step deal we've got to
[5:21] continue on
[5:24] now notice
[5:27] he says
[5:29] towards he says if thou continue in this
[5:32] goodness otherwise Thou shalt be cut off
[5:33] see the danger of this we've got to go
[5:36] all the way to the end
[5:37] and they also if they abide not stealing
[5:40] unbelief shall be grafted in for God is
[5:44] able to graft them in again why because
[5:46] he's the husbandman he is the great the
[5:49] remember if Adam was a garden keeper
[5:51] then then uh the second Adam would be
[5:54] the garden keeper of his garden right
[5:56] here on Earth remember he says he went
[5:57] into a field and sowed on these seeds
[6:00] and this and that and the enemy came and
[6:01] sowed seas behind him and those sort of
[6:03] things he is the husbandman now
[6:06] let's continue on here verse 24 for if
[6:09] thou word cut out of the Olive Tree
[6:11] which is Wild by nature and we're
[6:13] grafted contrary to Nature into a good
[6:15] Olive Tree how much more shall these
[6:18] which be the natural branches be grafted
[6:21] into their own Olive Tree now notice
[6:24] verse 25 I think yeah we'll continue on
[6:26] verse 25. oh I guess I do have all that
[6:29] never mind
[6:31] for I would not Brethren that ye should
[6:33] be ignorant of this mystery unless you
[6:35] should be wise in your own conceits that
[6:38] blindness in part is happened to Israel
[6:43] unto the fullness of the Gentiles become
[6:46] in so let's say a word of prayer here
[6:53] and father Lord Jesus Lord we come
[6:55] humbly Lord and Lord God giving you
[6:57] respects Lord for you're the creator of
[6:59] heavens and earth Lord and Lord how
[7:01] you've even created us Lord and Lord God
[7:03] we were wrought in your image Lord God
[7:05] our lord Jesus Lord we have assembled
[7:07] Lord those that heard this word and
[7:09] something stirred and changed in their
[7:11] lives something the desire for the world
[7:14] is completely left and they'll may be
[7:17] tempted here there every once in a while
[7:19] or or however you know how the man the
[7:21] East person battles the Lord but Lord
[7:23] Jesus Lord we are here assembled uh for
[7:26] the post of Duty Lord not of law but of
[7:29] Love Lord we we know you called us to
[7:31] assemble together Lord and we love to
[7:33] come together Lord to hear your word
[7:36] Lord to be uh in your presence Lord God
[7:38] and to believe all things Lord bless the
[7:41] people bless the Saints Lord and Lord we
[7:43] ask a special anointing
[7:46] a blessing upon brother Jesse Pastor
[7:49] Jesse York as he is doing a great work
[7:53] here Lord though look may he look humble
[7:55] Lord the outcome will have a Bountiful
[7:58] Harvest Lord
[8:00] those some might think were outcasts
[8:03] Lord or some might not think as a
[8:05] high-class people yet Lord God your seed
[8:08] is everywhere Lord maybe be conscious of
[8:11] that oh God we love you so much Lord
[8:13] protective God as he even drives back
[8:15] Lord bless his Services Lord bless those
[8:17] baptisms in the name of Jesus Christ
[8:19] amen amen you have your seats there
[8:22] we're all excited about that I can't
[8:24] wait to hear what happens there and
[8:26] brother Jesse had asked me a couple
[8:28] weeks ago to go down it was like 10
[8:29] o'clock on a Saturday night and I'm like
[8:31] huh
[8:32] you have to drive two hours here and
[8:33] then another two two and a half down
[8:35] south to pick a family up and I was like
[8:37] whoa that's in the first one of the
[8:38] first times I said no and I said that's
[8:41] a little late even for me
[8:43] now if I would have had like something
[8:45] pierce my my mind and run into my heart
[8:47] and say well we'll get it then we'll get
[8:48] it right because that's what we do right
[8:50] sure
[8:51] um so
[8:53] we thank the Lord for all things and I
[8:56] think about uh
[8:59] who you are and how what God has
[9:01] declared you to be he's declared you to
[9:03] what to be the Kings and Priests what of
[9:07] this world
[9:09] and I just have a real simple uh study
[9:12] this morning just a real thought but I
[9:14] want it to be an encouragement because I
[9:16] see
[9:17] battles raging at the home Church
[9:20] so much going on up here in individuals
[9:23] and people
[9:24] so many thoughts
[9:26] so many uh polls from this person that
[9:30] person or from the world or however just
[9:34] seeing things and and things people are
[9:36] going through and just hearing through
[9:37] the grapevine and we there's so much to
[9:40] pray for and there's so much to believe
[9:42] for for others to receive what they need
[9:45] of God
[9:47] it's a burden you know and just like uh
[9:49] I sometimes every once while I
[9:52] get a little down and I say Lord I don't
[9:54] know what to do for these do for people
[9:56] you know all you can do is pray
[9:58] ER remember the prophet of God he would
[10:00] say he said if I could heal you I would
[10:02] if I if I could encourage you and and
[10:05] uplift up lip uplift or heal that broken
[10:08] Spirit he says I would
[10:10] but in those sort of things we've got to
[10:12] intercede from one another and and
[10:14] really pull on God and try and get in
[10:17] his presence and ask the blessing for
[10:19] the other person you know to lift them
[10:22] up and make them the the higher calls
[10:24] than yourself and to really you know be
[10:26] a a a a a a an animal of self-sacrifice
[10:30] you know because Christ who who is our
[10:32] example Jesus Christ right did he seek
[10:34] his own did he seek his own good and
[10:37] this and that and however no he was all
[10:39] about his children or his people right
[10:42] he he literally he literally laid down
[10:44] his life and gave it and shed his blood
[10:47] for us
[10:48] I mean what more what what more can we
[10:51] ask for he's given us that's why that's
[10:54] why he had to close that book of
[10:55] Revelation said you can't enter take
[10:57] away because what it's already been done
[10:58] everything everything we need has been
[11:00] given to us so
[11:02] you know he's been so good and so kind
[11:06] uh so now here we'll start we'll just
[11:07] end here in verse 26 and we'll move 28.
[11:10] he says and so all Israel he says shall
[11:13] be saved as it is written there shall
[11:17] come out of Zion or Zion to deliver and
[11:20] shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob
[11:22] this for this is my Covenant unto them
[11:25] when I shall take away their sins
[11:28] as concerning the gospel they are
[11:31] enemies for your sakes
[11:33] you look at some of the famous Jews like
[11:35] in America what's that famous
[11:37] intellectual they have now uh Ben
[11:40] Shapiro Jewish super super intellectual
[11:43] just an absolute just talking just
[11:45] rattle machine gun fire drop anyone
[11:47] that's contrary to logic but when you
[11:51] see him taking everyone about Jesus
[11:52] Christ he's like no he was just a man
[11:53] you know he's just you know this and
[11:55] this why because they've been that that
[11:57] seed that that line there was blinded in
[12:01] that natural Branch was broken off and
[12:03] cast what
[12:04] so that we then could be grafted in
[12:10] we are blessed and he did it on purpose
[12:14] see the election of God
[12:17] he would he for some he would let
[12:19] absolutely not allow to see these things
[12:22] and then others must see these things
[12:25] this was given to them specifically to
[12:28] understand and to see amen now as
[12:31] concerning the gospel they were enemies
[12:32] for your sakes but it's touching the
[12:34] election they are beloved for the
[12:38] father's sakes and I did another study a
[12:40] continuation of what I taught here last
[12:42] time at home and you better bless those
[12:44] Jews
[12:46] God God uses the Gentiles for the Jews
[12:48] amen notice it says he says and out of
[12:50] Zion to deliver in other words who Zion
[12:52] the bride out of the Bride will come
[12:54] come what the deliverer Christ is going
[12:57] to rise and I was like this when when
[12:58] the bride then brings forth Christ once
[13:02] again the way it's supposed to be in the
[13:03] book of Acts but Graham said he said
[13:05] well he says that same gospel that was
[13:07] that we received here will be preached
[13:09] to them and bring them into the Covenant
[13:12] as well and the Bible says in one day
[13:14] 144 000 will receive the baptism of the
[13:17] Holy Ghost
[13:18] the same thing we've received the same
[13:20] promises we have they are going to
[13:22] receive them back amen why but we have
[13:25] to wait to the Gentiles days are over
[13:26] and that's what we're we're seeing the
[13:29] culmination that right now this thing's
[13:31] breaking forth very very rapidly now
[13:34] this morning nothing deep but I want to
[13:37] just I want to
[13:39] this was kind of on my heart here did I
[13:41] just jump out of this okay no so I
[13:43] didn't okay uh
[13:45] so this has been on my heart here and I
[13:47] want to
[13:48] um just something last night just
[13:53] I just want to I hope this is a blessing
[13:54] so we want to teach on an individual
[13:57] revelation
[14:00] an individual
[14:03] revelation
[14:06] now notice here in second Corinthians 3.
[14:11] and this is a very serious uh I mean I
[14:13] guess it's simple but it's a very
[14:15] serious this is coming down to it right
[14:17] here this is literally this this
[14:19] distinguishes this this shows who's
[14:21] going to make Rapture and who's not
[14:23] okay because God always deals with the
[14:26] Jews different than with the Gentiles
[14:29] now notice here in second Corinthians 3
[14:31] 11 he says for that which is done away
[14:33] with was for that which is done away
[14:36] with was glorious now they're talking
[14:37] about the Old Testament the old ways the
[14:39] laws and the those sort of things he
[14:42] says much more that which remaineth is
[14:44] glorious so in other words what what God
[14:46] has magnified in the law that's even
[14:49] more glorious right because now he said
[14:51] he said he said we're going to do away
[14:52] with this legalist and this thing and
[14:54] that law and this uh thing here and this
[14:56] here but he said but these Ten
[14:57] Commandments were continuing on and
[14:59] we're going to make it even harder to
[15:01] make it
[15:03] so he says seeing then that we have such
[15:05] a hope we use great plainness of speech
[15:09] a great plainness of speech and not as
[15:12] Moses which put a veil over his face so
[15:14] Paul reading the Old Testament sees when
[15:18] Moses come down from receiving those in
[15:19] the Bible said his face shown it glowed
[15:22] and he had actually it was so it Shine
[15:24] so bright they had to put a veil over
[15:26] and Paul's reading this and the Holy
[15:28] Ghost quickens to him what that meant
[15:32] he says he says that the children could
[15:34] not steadfastly look to the end of that
[15:37] which is abolished he says but their
[15:39] minds were blinded For unto this day
[15:42] remaineth that same Veil untaken away in
[15:45] the reading of the Old Testament see
[15:49] we have so many scriptures what
[15:51] thousands of scriptures uh I had young
[15:54] banaya wanted to teach a Bible study a
[15:56] couple months about a month ago and I
[15:58] and I had to I actually had to come here
[15:59] and teach and uh I said banaya what are
[16:02] you teaching on he says I'm teaching on
[16:03] the Prophecies of Jesus Christ in the
[16:05] Old Testament I said oh
[16:07] that sounds very good why because
[16:08] there's hundreds and hundreds of them
[16:12] and Christ his testimony was what that
[16:14] he would fulfill each one of them he
[16:17] said look and the Bible talks about how
[16:18] his bones are out of joint and he'd look
[16:20] down at his chest he could see his ribs
[16:22] and he said to my bones stare at me and
[16:24] he gave his back to the smiders and they
[16:26] ripped out his beard and all those
[16:27] things exactly he fulfilled it to the T
[16:31] amen and he did it what for you and I
[16:33] that what we could receive salvation
[16:35] because without that human sacrifice
[16:38] without Christ giving his own life what
[16:41] we would still be what dead in our sins
[16:43] absolutely because the Bible says in
[16:45] First Corinthians 15 he says if you're
[16:46] baptized unto the dead he says he says
[16:49] we're still yet in our sins right but he
[16:51] didn't just die but he was raised again
[16:53] what showing what that the same life
[16:55] that was in him and if it being you
[16:57] it'll Quicken that same mortal body amen
[17:01] sure he says For unto this day remaineth
[17:03] that same Veil taken away in the reading
[17:06] of the Old Testament which was veils
[17:07] done away in Christ even unto this day
[17:09] when Moses is read the veil is upon
[17:12] their heart they literally
[17:15] they can't see it see this is a
[17:17] spiritual thing
[17:20] you know what if you take a an Old
[17:22] Testament or a Jew right now with a with
[17:25] a it's like this someone who believes
[17:27] this word and you asked him two plus two
[17:29] you guys are going to have the exact
[17:31] same answer
[17:33] and you can run through algebra with a
[17:35] Jew you can go run through algebra
[17:37] through you guys and you guys can come
[17:38] up with the same answers you can ask
[17:40] them scientific questions one after the
[17:42] other and what you guys are gonna have
[17:44] the same answers you're going to say uh
[17:46] uh uh like brother malkai is a he was at
[17:48] one time I don't know if you still are a
[17:50] big history buff or whatever in World
[17:51] War II and
[17:53] he sent me a couple of those pictures of
[17:54] planes and tanks and all those sort of
[17:56] things and uh
[17:58] give them to me and they're not so you
[18:00] can actually ask them old uh World War
[18:03] One World War II history of this and
[18:04] this and give them the Jewish angle and
[18:07] the the American angle this this and
[18:09] they'll come up with the exact same
[18:10] stories right because what is history
[18:12] because in other words their minds
[18:14] operate the exact same way we all can
[18:16] think we can all we're ease and we call
[18:18] someone memorize and think those sort of
[18:20] things but when it comes down to
[18:22] spiritual revelation
[18:25] this is something that's beyond the
[18:27] natural
[18:28] it's something higher it's something
[18:30] greater what God has there literally God
[18:32] has given you the ability to spiritually
[18:35] hear and to spiritually see these things
[18:40] just we can't take this for granted we
[18:42] have to be thankful for Jesus Christ to
[18:44] Jesus Christ what the God gave us this
[18:46] ability
[18:48] amen sure
[18:51] he says nevertheless when it shall turn
[18:52] to the Lord the veil shall be taken away
[18:55] now notice once God comes and what
[18:58] turns them God is going to take all that
[19:01] darkness and they're going to read the
[19:03] Old Testament in a new light in the in
[19:05] the and for for us who is in this
[19:07] message the Bible is going to be a new
[19:09] book to them
[19:11] and they're going to receive the Holy
[19:13] Ghost in one day
[19:17] but if you look at Israel in the
[19:20] scripture God says so many wonderful
[19:22] things about them now notice here in in
[19:25] Deuteronomy 32
[19:27] and verse 8 he says when the most high
[19:29] divided to the Nations their inheritance
[19:31] when he separated the sons of Adam now
[19:34] notice there are sons of Adam there is a
[19:36] seed line he says he set the bounds of
[19:39] the people according to the number of
[19:40] the children of Israel for the Lord's
[19:42] portion is his people he says Jacob is
[19:45] the lot of his inheritance notice he
[19:48] says he says these are my inheritance
[19:49] what does he point to are those natural
[19:51] Jews absolutely those were the
[19:52] inheritance absolutely but he's looking
[19:54] forward Christ is always looking forward
[19:56] to what the end of the entire work the
[19:58] entire I say like this we just had a
[20:00] brother
[20:01] in our assembly
[20:03] and and he's married to a wonderful
[20:05] sister
[20:06] and she has a mother
[20:08] and they went through years now going to
[20:11] Chicago and back witnessing to their
[20:13] mother Chicago and back and this and
[20:15] that and then finally the mother in
[20:17] Chicago agreed to move back with them
[20:19] and she moved in and the brothers had to
[20:21] come in and unload a ton of her stuff
[20:24] and trailers and semi trucks and all
[20:27] those things bring it into the house and
[20:29] then they get all sorted assists and the
[20:31] brothers looks so tired
[20:33] and guess what yesterday that woman was
[20:37] your 80s
[20:39] 80s got baptized in the name of Jesus
[20:41] Christ
[20:43] in Ottawa Ohio
[20:45] and I looked at that brother
[20:48] and I said brother all those travels all
[20:52] those laboring witnessing to your
[20:55] mother-in-law paid off today
[20:59] and I went to the Mother-in-law sister
[21:01] and I said sister this is literally one
[21:03] of the few things God actually asks us
[21:05] to do in the physical is get baptized
[21:09] you can't call yourself you can't
[21:12] justify yourself you can't sanctify
[21:13] yourself you can't fill yourself with
[21:14] the Holy Ghost but he asked you to do
[21:16] one thing he says get baptized in the
[21:18] name of Jesus Christ amen and now she's
[21:20] done it and now what there's a promise
[21:22] that that is hovering over her she'd
[21:25] come up out of the water just crying and
[21:28] it's a beautiful thing but all all that
[21:31] was for this one moment right there and
[21:34] Christ when he started this great story
[21:37] this great I'll say this this great
[21:39] mystery from the beginning and just
[21:41] creation this and creation and doing
[21:43] this in the 50s and fourth days and
[21:45] third days and all those stories the
[21:46] whole thing he's looking forward he was
[21:48] looking to the end
[21:49] he was looking at what he was going to
[21:51] produce at the end and who is he trying
[21:52] to produce himself in you and through
[21:56] you and that you would be what led by he
[21:59] himself and doing the exact same signs
[22:01] wonders and miracles amen
[22:04] so about notice here in verse 10 and he
[22:06] found him in the desert land and in the
[22:08] weight howling the waste howling
[22:10] Wilderness he led him about he
[22:12] instructed him he kept him as the apple
[22:14] of his eye and yet he called he called
[22:17] these Jews what the apple of his
[22:20] and yet what he let many Fall by the
[22:22] wayside he let many of this and many of
[22:25] this he sent him into captivity time and
[22:26] time and time again but what God loved
[22:29] him but what he was looking at them and
[22:31] seeing it was in them all the way at the
[22:33] End Amen sure he says and as the ego
[22:36] stirs up her nest flutters over her
[22:39] young spread of the brought her wings
[22:41] taketh them and bear them upon her wings
[22:43] so the Lord alone did lead him and there
[22:46] was no strange god with him look he did
[22:49] all that
[22:51] for them when they came out of Egypt
[22:53] there was literally only two real
[22:55] Believers that came out of Egypt and he
[22:57] did it all for them and the seed that
[23:00] would come out of the fathers that
[23:01] failed in the wilderness
[23:04] that's what the prophet God said he said
[23:06] he said this is just like it's just like
[23:07] a plant there's the seed and then out of
[23:09] the seed comes the the the the stem and
[23:11] the and then and then the tassels and
[23:13] then the the shock and then this and
[23:14] then the seed itself is in that Shug
[23:18] a lot of people are just carriers
[23:21] of the life of God and there is a
[23:23] generation that's going to and I believe
[23:25] we're in this generation that's going to
[23:27] Manifest this thing the way it was meant
[23:30] to be manifested amen now let's continue
[23:34] on here so he calls them the apple of
[23:36] his eye
[23:37] notice also what the Lord calls them in
[23:40] verse 22 he says and thou shall say unto
[23:43] Pharaoh he says thus say the Lord Israel
[23:45] is my son even my firstborn
[23:48] look at God he see God he picked and
[23:52] chose this people and the Bible says not
[23:53] because they were biggest or not because
[23:55] they were strong as me what because what
[23:57] God loved them amen in the Bible the
[23:59] reason why he loved Israel so much is
[24:01] because he picked Abraham he picked
[24:03] Jacob he picked Isaac and those and he
[24:05] loved those three fathers so much
[24:09] a lot of times he said he says I
[24:11] remember he says and Moses would cry out
[24:13] and say he said Lord don't don't slay
[24:15] these and don't say that he said
[24:16] remember that you're the god of Abraham
[24:17] Isaac and Jacob and sometimes the Bible
[24:20] would say he says he's the he's you're
[24:22] the god of Abraham Isaac and Israel amen
[24:25] and that's a there's a major uh uh some
[24:27] Revelations there by God's grace when he
[24:28] switches that name change and really
[24:31] pulls on the heartstrings of the Lord
[24:32] amen sure
[24:34] he says say unto thee let my son go that
[24:38] he may serve me he says if thou refused
[24:40] to let him go behold I will slay thy son
[24:42] even thy first born
[24:45] see so because Christ they came out of
[24:47] Christ and he called them his firstborn
[24:49] I said what a nation an actual like
[24:52] church first born Church nation and here
[24:56] now he calls it the firstborn he says if
[24:57] you don't let this church my firstborn
[24:59] my son go he says I'll slay your
[25:02] firstborn and he did
[25:04] right absolutely so now
[25:09] so if you see this here whenever God
[25:11] deals with Israel's within it's an it's
[25:13] the whole thing it's a nation they were
[25:16] a nation Church a nation people when one
[25:18] person failed just like we've seen the
[25:20] promised land uh Aiken rose up and this
[25:23] and this he stole this and hid that and
[25:25] did that or whatever and the entire
[25:26] nation suffered because of that
[25:29] right absolutely so now uh here's here's
[25:33] another uh thing right here
[25:35] we see
[25:37] this take place
[25:39] in second Samuel 21 verse 1 then there
[25:42] was a famine in the days of David three
[25:44] years year after year
[25:47] so David comes into power and all of a
[25:50] sudden he comes into power and a famine
[25:52] strikes Israel
[25:54] why did this famine happen
[25:57] we see right there
[25:58] and David inquired of the Lord the Lord
[26:00] said answer it he says it is for Saul
[26:03] and for his bloody house because he slew
[26:06] the Gibby Knights so one man did one
[26:08] wrong thing one king did one wrong thing
[26:11] and the entire nation had three years of
[26:14] famine that's enough to wipe them out
[26:18] and David he finally got so desperate
[26:19] after three years like Lord what have I
[26:21] done what have I done what's going on
[26:22] what's going on he finally entered in
[26:24] and God answered and said it's because
[26:25] of what Saul did
[26:27] the Forerunner remember he was a type of
[26:29] what denominational
[26:31] Prophet God said that he was he we had
[26:33] the easy ecclesiastical swords and
[26:35] ecclesiastical jackets and vests and
[26:37] armor and mail and all those things for
[26:39] what ecclesiastical battles
[26:43] but now notice here
[26:45] wherefore Davidson to the giving us what
[26:47] shall I do for you
[26:49] and where was shall I make the atonement
[26:51] they may be that he may bless the
[26:53] inheritance of the Lord
[26:55] and to give you I said unto him we will
[26:57] have we will have no silver nor gold of
[27:00] Saul nor of his house neither to us they
[27:03] shall Thou shalt neither for us shalt
[27:05] thou kill any in Israel and he said what
[27:07] shall I say what shall I do for you and
[27:10] they answered the king
[27:13] the man that consumed us and that
[27:15] devised us against us that we should be
[27:17] destroyed from a remaining in any of the
[27:19] coast of Israel that seven men of his
[27:22] sons be delivered unto us and we will
[27:24] hang them up before the Lord and give
[27:26] you of Saul whom the Lord would choose
[27:27] and the King said I will give them
[27:31] anytime you see that number seven
[27:34] that represents the church ages
[27:37] seven is always them Church ages but now
[27:40] remember be because of these famine
[27:42] because of this famine what what they
[27:45] have to do they had to offer up these
[27:46] men which is a type one a denominational
[27:49] offshoots this is what this is the
[27:51] because in every Church age what was the
[27:53] problem organization
[27:56] my pastor just listened to another
[27:58] sermon and he said he said he goes
[28:00] everything this entire Pro the entire
[28:02] problem with why the book of Acts fell
[28:04] had to do with organization the reason
[28:07] the book of Acts could never spring
[28:09] forward once again was because of
[28:11] organizational Spirit men coming up what
[28:14] and taking that spirit and it and then
[28:16] the Bible says well not the problem but
[28:18] the prophet God said God says what he
[28:19] says he says what is it he says it's
[28:21] divine leadership plus human
[28:25] and that's where I would get in trouble
[28:27] that's where all of us would get in
[28:28] trouble if we take Lord what is your
[28:30] wallet what is your will what is your
[28:31] will and then we come a thought comes
[28:33] and we don't know if it's God or if we
[28:35] think it's our own or however but if
[28:36] it's our own we cannot add it into
[28:38] whatever the answer would be we're
[28:41] preying on or asking for a leadership
[28:43] right amen he says so let the seven men
[28:46] of his sons be delivered unto us and we
[28:47] will hang them up into the Lord in
[28:49] gibeas in other words we have to do away
[28:51] with all organizational ideas anything
[28:54] organizational and I'll say it like this
[28:58] any dogmas that have come up in the
[29:02] message
[29:03] I'll say now I'll just make I'll just
[29:05] mention one here I've been studying out
[29:06] a couple things our past has been
[29:07] hitting back home and
[29:09] wow
[29:11] I was originally taught that the the
[29:13] Rapture was a process
[29:18] and I said hmm
[29:19] and then so we did some study on that
[29:22] some research and we found out exactly
[29:24] where that Doctrine came from
[29:25] is the rapture a process
[29:28] the Bible says when the Lord descends he
[29:30] shall send what a shout voice and Trump
[29:34] and if you look at the Shadow and type
[29:36] or the first one It All Happened very
[29:39] very very quickly
[29:41] so we're kind of leaning against that
[29:43] now that not the Rapture is not a
[29:44] process
[29:46] because once you receive the Holy Ghost
[29:48] you've made the rapture
[29:52] there is a time a point in time where
[29:54] Jesus Will descend and all these things
[29:57] will take place and then the Rapture
[29:59] that in Christ will rise first and they
[30:01] which were alive and remain shall be
[30:03] caught up with him in the clouds forever
[30:04] amen
[30:06] that's what we're looking for amen sure
[30:08] now let's continue on here by God's
[30:10] grace
[30:12] now notice and he delivered them into
[30:14] the hands of the gibeonites and they
[30:15] hang them in the hill before the law
[30:19] seven together notice in one day and
[30:23] we're put to death in the days of the
[30:24] Harvest in the first days in the
[30:26] beginning of the barley Harvest so
[30:28] notice all seven of them were identified
[30:31] this one this one this one this one this
[30:33] one this one and they were all taken
[30:34] down in one day
[30:36] in the days of the Harvest what Harvest
[30:38] was it according to commentators he says
[30:40] they were put to death in days of
[30:41] harvest in the first days in the
[30:43] beginning of the barley Harvest which
[30:44] began at
[30:46] Passover
[30:48] what so that Death Angel couldn't touch
[30:50] him anymore that angel or that Spirit
[30:53] one that would bring forth the famine
[30:55] the land or however or try to steal from
[30:57] the people what it would be atone for
[30:59] amen and what that that would literally
[31:02] show that everything has been made right
[31:05] amen when Christ came
[31:07] he would they were Moses was bringing
[31:09] judgment plague plague plague plague and
[31:12] the final one that would strike that
[31:14] nation was death sure but when that took
[31:17] place if we had to have the the the uh
[31:20] the blood applied we had to have that
[31:22] hyssop use the hyssop to apply the blood
[31:24] and if we had that we would be saved
[31:27] sure
[31:28] amen so
[31:30] uh
[31:31] we're seeing those things now
[31:35] and I wanted to to kind of just uh
[31:39] teach on these individuals here because
[31:41] if you look at this
[31:44] Revelations two and four he says
[31:46] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[31:47] thee against thee because thou has left
[31:49] thy First Love remember for therefore
[31:53] from whence Thou Art fallen and repent
[31:55] and do the first works or else I will
[31:57] come unto thee quickly and remove thy
[31:59] Candlestick out of his place except our
[32:01] print but this thou Hast that thou
[32:03] hatest the deeds and neglatans which I
[32:05] also
[32:06] hate
[32:09] so what was the entire
[32:12] the seals were revealed in 63.
[32:15] revealed right
[32:18] what were the Seals All About
[32:21] they were about the Antichrist spirit
[32:24] and what did the what was the first
[32:26] thing the devil went after
[32:30] he went after
[32:32] the laity
[32:34] because Nicholas wanted to conquer the
[32:36] laity
[32:38] the body of Christ that's been the whole
[32:40] battle that's organization when the when
[32:43] the when the body of Christ or the laity
[32:45] is put under the thumb of a headship
[32:49] it shuts it down
[32:53] but we've got to come up out of that
[32:56] no I don't think brother Jesse is
[32:58] definitely not Nickelodeon there's no
[32:59] doubt about it he's not
[33:01] where does he want to
[33:04] now he's supposed to watch over the
[33:06] house of God and make sure everything's
[33:07] in order and those sort of things but
[33:09] the whole point of this thing is to
[33:11] bring us into Liberty
[33:16] you have to come into Liberty the pastor
[33:19] the the Evangelist the however the
[33:22] five-fold still operating they're trying
[33:23] to do their best
[33:24] but we're sowing they want to we went to
[33:27] sow the seeds of bringing the individual
[33:30] laity into power
[33:33] literally recognizing who she is and
[33:37] what to do with what she's been giving
[33:42] that's what was stolen from the
[33:44] beginning and then that must be restored
[33:48] now notice
[33:50] he says it's not I'm not one of those
[33:52] Believers in the nicolaitan taking all
[33:55] conquered ladies putting it all on the
[33:58] pastor
[34:01] putting it all on the how much how much
[34:03] work does brother Jesse do here
[34:07] [Music]
[34:10] teacher in a Bible study
[34:14] should I go down on the road and just
[34:16] let it back me up back me up what else
[34:17] does he do whether he does it all right
[34:22] it's not all on this must not all be on
[34:24] brother Jesse
[34:26] and that calls for what the other men of
[34:28] the church
[34:29] to rise up and take positions if they
[34:33] see their past or needing rest here or
[34:34] they're passed to this or Pastor that
[34:36] saints of God do not be scared to offer
[34:40] your services why because God placed you
[34:42] in a position what are the gifts in your
[34:44] life
[34:45] your brothers sisters as well what are
[34:48] the gifts you're like what can you do to
[34:50] make this
[34:51] congregation better what can you do to
[34:54] usher in the Holy Ghost more
[34:56] don't limit yourself
[35:00] all of you
[35:02] do not limit what God can do with you
[35:08] he says
[35:09] he says is the the Holy Ghost doesn't
[35:11] doesn't just doesn't baptize the pastor
[35:13] it baptizes the Leia to laity too it's
[35:17] all in the laity and the pastor is just
[35:20] one of us
[35:21] see see the we've got to get out of the
[35:23] mind oh he's the pastor he's the bishop
[35:25] this and the saints of God we are a unit
[35:28] we are a living breathing Stones what of
[35:33] the temple of God
[35:35] and each one of you has to come to their
[35:39] maturity right me as well I'm striving
[35:41] I'm like Lord how do I get there I don't
[35:43] know
[35:45] but he said he would do it
[35:47] look at Peter James and John they're
[35:49] fishermen
[35:51] just common everyday guys to go out in
[35:54] the boat smell like fish constantly
[35:57] washing our hands in seawater
[35:59] touching dead guts of fish all day long
[36:02] mending Nets doing those sort of things
[36:05] and one day they're out there mending
[36:07] Nets or whatever they're by the seashore
[36:08] and a man says come follow me and
[36:10] they're like
[36:12] [Laughter]
[36:20] Jesus said come follow me how many other
[36:22] how many other fishermen were there that
[36:24] day how many well their dad was there
[36:26] I'm sure Zebedee right and though he
[36:29] heard it did he come fishing did he come
[36:31] with Jesus no those that were ordained
[36:34] to hear they said come follow me and
[36:37] those went and left their jaws went and
[36:40] what followed the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:45] common everyday ordinary individuals
[36:50] when Jesus came and said come follow me
[36:52] to the entire nation of Israel follow
[36:55] Jesus
[36:57] but at that point he says I was looking
[36:58] for the Lost
[37:01] sheep he didn't say goats he said sheep
[37:05] of Israel
[37:07] and did Jesus accomplish what he said he
[37:10] was going to do or not
[37:13] he came and did exactly what he said he
[37:16] was going to do
[37:18] and there's still more sheep to be found
[37:20] what he sent those sheep that he didn't
[37:22] catch strength and then God strengthened
[37:24] them encouraged them fill them with the
[37:26] same Spirit he had and set them off to
[37:28] catch more more Sheep amen
[37:30] yes he says means Shepherd Pastor which
[37:33] means the feet of like the holy spirit
[37:35] gives overseer to watch it and to
[37:37] control it absolutely
[37:40] but what about you you're the
[37:42] individuals
[37:44] he says now we know that God that God
[37:47] was always wasn't always been against
[37:49] organized religion yes sir he said it
[37:51] Nickelodeon is what I hate Nicola means
[37:53] to conquer the lady laity is the laity
[37:55] is the church the body who's the body of
[37:57] Christ
[37:58] you are
[38:00] I have been now
[38:03] speaking here for a little bit to the
[38:05] body of this assembly
[38:10] he says the body Nico Nico nickeo means
[38:13] to conquer overcome in the words to make
[38:15] to make a holy man somebody above the
[38:18] other
[38:22] so let's say brother Jesse invites
[38:24] someone who's somewhere felt well well
[38:26] known
[38:27] and everybody's like
[38:31] you know how it is
[38:33] and there are some that have very
[38:35] tremendous Ministries very gifted and
[38:37] eloquent and bringing these things have
[38:38] power all those things anointed and all
[38:40] those sort of things but remember
[38:42] that's not them
[38:45] you're seeing a gift
[38:49] not the person
[38:50] you're seeing a gift
[38:53] the anointing is that the person no
[38:55] that's the Holy Ghost on them
[38:59] so you can have a wonderful service the
[39:01] Holy Ghost can come down but remember
[39:03] you're just as equal as he is in the
[39:06] sight of God
[39:08] because remember that gift is a gift for
[39:11] who
[39:12] the laity
[39:14] the body of Christ
[39:16] you
[39:18] that's for you that's your chef
[39:21] serving up the meal right he says we're
[39:23] all children we got one king that's God
[39:25] we all got one Holy One he says and
[39:28] that's God Amen he is in the midst of us
[39:30] he says in the form of the Holy Ghost he
[39:32] said that's the Holy One
[39:35] that's why we don't call them beyond
[39:37] what they what they are we just call
[39:39] everybody brother
[39:42] here we go we give double
[39:45] you call them Pastor Jesse or brother
[39:47] Jesse but you know just give them a
[39:48] little extra iron give them that that
[39:50] title name because he's a pastor it's a
[39:52] high calling it's a high standard
[39:55] and someone's maybe called to be a
[39:57] pastor they have to walk on eggshells
[40:00] before the people
[40:03] sister Lydia brother milk I had to
[40:05] probably raise pretty strictly
[40:10] Keisha raised pretty strictly
[40:13] Haven see there's people there should be
[40:16] raised pretty strictly it's cares Toba
[40:19] raised strictly right absolutely why
[40:20] because the pastor must have his
[40:22] children in or
[40:25] must
[40:27] it's not that's not an option it's a
[40:29] requirement
[40:30] amen now
[40:32] he said that's what started the chaos
[40:34] for the first time the chaos he says at
[40:37] the 90 Council they wanted the doctor
[40:39] the neglators mean to conquer the lady
[40:40] takeaways and lazy and make a holy man
[40:43] he said that's not a holy man holy Hill
[40:46] it's the holy God a holy God amongst the
[40:48] people the laity has part of it
[40:52] we've got to come up higher I've got to
[40:53] come up higher
[40:55] I am being honest I want to speak in
[40:57] tongues I want to interpret I want to
[40:58] warn of there's if there's a danger up
[41:01] ahead
[41:02] anybody know the future
[41:04] no but the Holy Spirit knows the future
[41:06] it's the spirit of Prophecy right and if
[41:09] someone can get into the anointing and
[41:10] worship God and that gift of speaking or
[41:12] interpretation in tongues lay in you God
[41:15] can use you to warn of impending Danger
[41:22] in the book of Acts didn't didn't one of
[41:24] the prophets say he says there's a
[41:25] famine coming
[41:26] and the Bible says it was fulfilled in
[41:28] such and such days
[41:30] and they were given ample time to
[41:32] prepare for the famine
[41:34] other things they may have perished did
[41:37] not Jesus himself the spirit of Prophecy
[41:39] in him say what he says he says when you
[41:41] see this city surrounded do not go back
[41:43] to your house is so he said he says when
[41:46] you see this when you see Titus or Nero
[41:47] whoever was surrounding he says don't go
[41:49] back just flee the hills and stay away
[41:53] and it saved those Jews that heard that
[41:56] prophecy that God opened their eyes and
[41:59] ears to hear and see
[42:01] save them see the Holy Spirit was our
[42:03] keeper we need him more than we even
[42:06] know
[42:07] even comprehend
[42:10] he says remember he says there the laity
[42:12] is part of it we are children
[42:15] there's no great ones Among Us
[42:18] how can you have faith when you desire
[42:19] respects one from another we're all one
[42:22] in Christ
[42:26] you are all one in Christ amen
[42:35] to me this is
[42:38] we can let's see when we call each other
[42:40] or fellowship or another we should be so
[42:42] excited because
[42:43] brother what is God doing in your life
[42:47] or sister what is the Lord working what
[42:49] have you what has God manifested listen
[42:51] this and what's going on over here and
[42:53] why because we are the body of Christ we
[42:56] should all be operating
[42:59] letting the Holy Spirit work through us
[43:01] continually
[43:04] and the Bible said Mark 16 was what he
[43:06] says these signs shall follow them that
[43:08] believe well verse I am just a sister
[43:10] I'm just a young man or however no no
[43:14] you all have this potential
[43:17] everyone here can raise the dead and
[43:19] heal the sick and those sort of things
[43:21] it can all be done by the yielding to
[43:24] the spirit of God
[43:28] absolutely I've seen it
[43:31] I'm a most of the times I've seen a
[43:33] healing take place where I've actually
[43:34] laid my hands on them haven't he been at
[43:36] the church it's been out in the job
[43:37] force or this person or that person or
[43:40] however
[43:41] why because I'm
[43:43] most people aren't sick when I come to
[43:44] teach
[43:46] or however they've already been healed
[43:49] but what making yourself available out
[43:52] in the world
[43:55] Jesus said I send them out to the world
[43:56] what as sheep uh you know Among Wolves
[44:00] right you're to operate out there what
[44:02] to do to to display the power of Christ
[44:05] that's manifestation absolutely now he
[44:08] says we're all one in Christ Jesus
[44:10] there's no big men and no littlemen
[44:12] we're all the same we're children of one
[44:14] father and his children see
[44:19] bro
[44:20] equal brother you have the exact same
[44:22] potential as anyone in this entire world
[44:26] sister as well
[44:30] well brother Graham had Signs Now
[44:31] brother Graham was the seventh star in
[44:33] the hand of God okay that was that was a
[44:35] once in 2000 Gentile lifetime or
[44:38] whatever you want to say that we
[44:39] actually saw a real Prophet given to us
[44:41] he's the only one that's going to be
[44:42] right
[44:43] there's no other stars that's the last
[44:45] one but there are gifts nine spiritual
[44:48] gifts healings miracles
[44:52] wisdom knowledge those sort of things
[44:55] that is in the laity that's in the bride
[44:59] to operate
[45:02] in the time of deception
[45:04] in the time of deception
[45:06] wouldn't you want ourselves in operation
[45:10] so that whoever walks through here will
[45:12] be called out from sin like right now
[45:16] what if I'd done something completely
[45:17] evil and I walked through here and and
[45:21] sister Naomi raised up thus said Lord
[45:23] Brother Simon you better repent
[45:27] I will drop to my knees run to the altar
[45:29] here
[45:30] Pastor Jesse please pray for me saying
[45:32] to God Brothers keep pray for me
[45:35] then you know this place is clean
[45:37] that'll spread really fast at the power
[45:41] of God is working among you
[45:45] but aside that's going to take labor and
[45:47] that's going to take yeah absolutely
[45:48] it's going to take a heart and a hunger
[45:50] for God that you want God in the midst
[45:52] in such a way
[45:54] amen yeah I mean that's that's what
[45:56] we're straving for right that's this is
[45:57] the whole point to reproduce to what the
[45:59] restoration of the book of Acts amen
[46:02] let's continue on here now now notice
[46:04] what the prophet God says he says
[46:05] there's no great ones he says how can
[46:07] you have faith when you desire respects
[46:09] one from another he says my brother and
[46:11] have not faith in the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:13] the lord of Glory with respect of
[46:15] persons
[46:18] Pastor Jesse's just drove down picked up
[46:21] like a family of Amish or come on Amish
[46:25] and this and this he drove down he said
[46:27] there's people with a lot of problems
[46:30] and see people the way they dress is a
[46:32] little bit
[46:34] more old school than our holy sister is
[46:36] here right and brothers
[46:38] say oh they're just this blah blah blah
[46:40] but notice brother Jesse with the heart
[46:42] of to save Souls the Bible says he that
[46:45] is wise when his Souls
[46:48] now he's been what called to baptize
[46:50] them in the name of Jesus Christ why
[46:52] because he sees every soul as ten
[46:54] thousand worlds
[46:56] that's what we're called to do is to get
[46:57] to find our seed Lord God direct our
[47:00] past to find the lost sheep of the House
[47:03] of Gentiles of God's Gentiles absolutely
[47:06] this dissensations thanks to God one of
[47:07] these days we got to get the rest of
[47:08] them and then we go there's got to be
[47:10] some out there and we got to go
[47:13] how's this rash going to take place
[47:14] unless God Saves all of them
[47:16] amen make yourself available help us
[47:18] Lord Jesus now let's continue on here he
[47:21] says for there come unto your assembly a
[47:23] man with a gold ring in goodly apparel
[47:26] and there'll also come a poor man and
[47:27] vile Raymond and ye have respect to him
[47:29] that wears the gay clothing or the the
[47:31] fancy clothing clothing he says and
[47:33] saying to him here sit down here in a
[47:35] good place and say to the poor stand out
[47:37] here or stand upon my footstool
[47:40] see putting plate by notice
[47:42] they're looking on on the outward
[47:47] completely carnal
[47:49] completely carnal looking at the
[47:52] appearance of what the person could
[47:54] afford or what the person could or how
[47:56] even dressed
[48:01] he says are you then not partial in
[48:04] yourselves and are become judges of evil
[48:06] thoughts
[48:08] the Holy Ghost said that was evil
[48:13] now here's the dangerous part in America
[48:14] because there's so many people on the on
[48:16] the the Homeless Action now
[48:18] and you drive past from this this and
[48:20] you're thinking
[48:21] is this a real or is this they choose to
[48:23] be this way
[48:24] now it's become a battle because there's
[48:26] so much opportunity out there I mean
[48:28] they could go get a job here this and
[48:29] this and this is the one to get to that
[48:31] point it's hard to climb back up but it
[48:33] can be done
[48:38] hearken he's with my beloved Brethren
[48:40] hath not God chosen the poor of this
[48:43] world rich in faith he says in Heirs of
[48:47] the Kingdom which he hath not he hath
[48:49] promised to them that love him amen so
[48:51] God sees the poor and says that's my
[48:52] people
[48:55] I was out with apprentice and my
[48:57] Apprentice he's the first year and he's
[48:58] like one day he's like sorry
[49:00] can we go get some breakfast sandwiches
[49:02] I was like okay let's go so I cleaned
[49:04] out my front seat because it's always
[49:05] dirty and he jumped in and we drove
[49:07] downtown Toledo to this my favorite
[49:09] little breakfast sandwich place we got
[49:11] our breakfast sandwiches and we're
[49:12] eating them in the truck and blah blah
[49:13] and boom a guy walks up says hey can you
[49:16] spare like uh and he had his gas can
[49:18] he's like I need gas I'm like okay he
[49:20] goes I'm living my car but it's so cold
[49:22] I can't run my my truck because I don't
[49:24] have any gas she stayed warm at night
[49:26] and I was like okay and my parents okay
[49:28] let me goes
[49:30] I'll be all right
[49:32] you know what we did I gave him 20 bucks
[49:34] and I said I'm going to fill your gas
[49:35] can up went and got the gas drove it
[49:38] back to me where he was at
[49:40] delivered it
[49:42] and you know what really moved me
[49:43] because when he came up to me he was
[49:45] about my dad's age and he had my exact
[49:47] name my dad's eyes
[49:49] and when I saw him I saw my father
[49:52] you know my dad asked me one time your
[49:53] grandpa asked me he said he said Simon
[49:55] go just take me to the Cherry Street
[49:56] Mission in Toledo and I go I am not as
[50:00] your son going to take you to a Cherry
[50:02] Street Mission he wanted to be homeless
[50:04] I said Dad those guys will eat you alive
[50:07] you don't even know what you're asking
[50:09] well he just just did not have the
[50:11] wisdom to understand what
[50:13] because once cold out you don't stay in
[50:15] there they kick you out for the day and
[50:16] you got to walk around
[50:18] because I see him downtown Toledo you
[50:19] gotta walk around
[50:21] I said my father is not and I told my
[50:24] parents I see the reason he's in his car
[50:25] and not with his son is because I'm not
[50:28] his dad
[50:30] and you're not his you know staying with
[50:32] your mom and dad for so long
[50:34] see when you see the poor you don't know
[50:36] what they've been through
[50:38] and the prophet God said Jesus from that
[50:39] he presents from from that time
[50:42] some people take shots and they just
[50:44] never recover
[50:46] they take they go through such battles
[50:49] and they're built maybe a little weaker
[50:51] than you are
[50:52] in the mind or don't have that drive and
[50:55] don't have that fight in them
[50:58] some don't have that
[50:59] you better thank God for what you have
[51:01] amen praise God
[51:04] if you're so standing if you can still
[51:05] go to work and this and this and you you
[51:07] go through your mind battles or your
[51:08] things at home and you still push on
[51:10] praise God because there's a lot of
[51:12] people who can't do that
[51:14] and God has allowed that for what what
[51:17] did the Bible tell us he says what he
[51:19] said he says you strong he says strength
[51:21] in the weak
[51:25] all those that don't have strength to
[51:28] even don't even have the motivation to
[51:30] do something and count themselves as
[51:32] nothing
[51:33] praise God
[51:35] we've got a lot to do a lot of work to
[51:37] do Saints
[51:39] but the Lord knows how to get it done
[51:40] just in time
[51:43] he says uh but you have despised the
[51:46] poor do not Richmond oppress you and
[51:48] draw you before the Judgment seats do
[51:51] not they blaspheme the word the name by
[51:53] which you are called he says if you
[51:54] fulfill the Royal law written in the
[51:57] scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor
[51:59] as thyself what he says ye do well amen
[52:06] got to get our eyes off this guy
[52:10] well I've wanted that saints of God
[52:12] looked so many people need love
[52:15] so many people just need a friend
[52:18] and that can lead right into salvation
[52:20] if they see something real
[52:25] a real loving kind gentle honest Pure
[52:30] Heart
[52:33] and they're ordained you're going to win
[52:34] them
[52:38] now
[52:39] look at this we're dealing with
[52:40] individuals
[52:42] and Peter said repent me baptize
[52:43] everyone in the name of Jesus Christ for
[52:45] the mission of sins that you shall
[52:46] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[52:47] the promises unto you and to your
[52:49] children to all that are to all that are
[52:51] far off even as many as the Lord God
[52:53] shall call amen
[52:55] that's individuals
[52:57] he didn't say full groups full churches
[52:59] he just said he says two those that God
[53:01] would call individuals amen
[53:05] now notice here
[53:10] you know why it's so hard for us to push
[53:12] through those things and I'm just
[53:13] speaking to myself too
[53:15] is because you look at someone more
[53:17] gifted than yourself
[53:22] I can get up here and say man I need to
[53:23] sing a song I look at brother amen I'm
[53:25] like
[53:29] if only I could play those strings
[53:31] if only had the ranger voice yeah
[53:34] I could be better for Christ
[53:38] I'm supposed to do what I'm supposed to
[53:40] Rejoice we have someone who can play and
[53:42] sing we've got someone who can praise
[53:45] God and look at you can you can hear it
[53:48] when he sings that he's a worshiping God
[53:51] he's not putting an entertainment or a
[53:53] show on for you he's worshiping the
[53:55] Lord's savior amen he's the worshiping
[53:58] the great Creator amen that made that
[54:00] voice that made that hard to receive him
[54:03] sure
[54:04] you know why because we're all built
[54:07] different
[54:09] for thou has possessed my Reigns thou
[54:12] has covered me oh I says in my mother's
[54:15] womb we all came from there
[54:17] I will praise thee for him fearfully and
[54:20] wonderfully made each one of you is
[54:23] wonderfully
[54:24] made
[54:26] well I wish I was like no no no
[54:29] you are specific built
[54:33] you didn't come out of no shop out of
[54:34] China where everything's the same or
[54:37] Taiwan or wherever
[54:39] you come from Heaven
[54:42] down here there's twins but up there I
[54:45] don't think there is
[54:47] amen everyone's individual
[54:51] he's a gardener
[54:54] he had a garden in the beginning Adam
[54:57] why because God is
[55:00] distinct
[55:01] he likes variety
[55:05] he says marvelous are thy works and that
[55:08] my soul knoweth right well my substance
[55:10] was not a hit for me when I was made in
[55:12] secret and curiously wrought in the
[55:14] lowest parts of the earth yet my Thine
[55:17] Eyes didn't see my substance yet being
[55:19] unperfect
[55:21] he knew what you were going to be and
[55:24] yet he still chose you to come on this
[55:26] side hallelujah amen you mean all the
[55:30] sin all the iniquity I'll say this same
[55:32] to God for the most part the message uh
[55:34] most message people don't really sin
[55:36] their sin is Iniquity their problem is
[55:39] Iniquity knowing how much do you
[55:41] understand what when I was a
[55:43] denomination I first got saved and this
[55:45] is like oh man I'm saved this is but I
[55:47] didn't even I didn't even know I was
[55:49] sinning half the time because I didn't
[55:50] know I didn't know sisters were supposed
[55:52] to wear skirts and dresses I didn't know
[55:55] I couldn't go to Sunday second service
[55:57] with my umbros on and this tank top and

[56:36] really iniquity because I didn't know

[56:39] ignorance oh my
[56:43] it's embarrassing yeah I look back and
[56:46] I'm like

[58:52] big numbers doesn't mean blessings
[58:54] big numbers doesn't mean God's with
[58:58] neither the small numbers
[59:01] remember it's individuals
[59:09] all all David knew is what how precious
[59:12] he says are thy thoughts unto me oh God
[59:14] how great is the sum of them to look
[59:16] past all this
[59:18] yeah absolutely every mistake every
[59:21] failure fault
[59:23] I just failed my wife about six months
[59:25] ago I I got scammed on something and I
[59:28] had to go home and confess and this and
[59:29] this and I'm like
[59:32] it's too much of a giver
[59:34] right we just failed now notice
[59:37] and God the great Creator who has
[59:39] expressed itself through all his
[59:41] creation we are part of his creation
[59:43] just as those flowers are just as the
[59:45] trees all other nature we are part of
[59:47] this creation think about it
[59:50] all creation are you not his creation
[59:52] absolutely
[59:54] how many stars are like
[59:56] zero how many snowflakes since the
[59:59] beginning of time are like zero how many
[1:00:01] Blades of grass are exactly perfectly
[1:00:03] the same zero how many trees
[1:00:06] zero
[1:00:09] how many people are exactly the same
[1:00:14] but you're all individually
[1:00:17] wonderfully made
[1:00:20] special
[1:00:22] well brother Psy how come how come this
[1:00:24] happened this happened we're going to
[1:00:26] get to that we're going to get to this
[1:00:27] now now God is a god of variety he
[1:00:29] doesn't have anything just the same he
[1:00:31] just doesn't have all mountains he has
[1:00:33] deserts planes grassy Fields yellow
[1:00:35] flowers white blue pink different colors
[1:00:38] he has a large man small men
[1:00:40] and dark-headed brown-headed redheaded
[1:00:43] he's a god of variety for everything is
[1:00:45] to serve his purpose
[1:00:48] you have a purpose
[1:00:52] each one of you has a potential
[1:00:55] some 30. 60 100 fold
[1:00:58] reach your potential
[1:01:03] reach your potential
[1:01:09] Lord
[1:01:10] what am I to do
[1:01:13] what gifts do I have Lane what did you
[1:01:15] place inside of me bring this out
[1:01:20] he's the god of writing for everything
[1:01:22] to serve his purpose he's got everything
[1:01:23] to serve his purpose purpose and
[1:01:25] everything that does serve as purpose
[1:01:27] correctly there is a resurrection to it
[1:01:31] [Laughter]
[1:01:33] fine why what did Enoch do the Bible
[1:01:35] said Enoch please God
[1:01:38] he obeyed God in all things and it
[1:01:42] pleased him so much that he made the
[1:01:44] Rapture without the Holy Ghost
[1:01:49] pleasing the Lord
[1:01:51] I know now I know we're at one hour
[1:01:54] right now got a little longer
[1:01:57] okay now now notice this
[1:02:00] Christina 16 7. and the Lord said to
[1:02:02] Samuel look not upon his countenance nor
[1:02:04] the height of a statue because I have
[1:02:05] refused him
[1:02:07] for the Lord seeth not as man see you
[1:02:12] for man looketh on the outward
[1:02:14] appearance
[1:02:15] but the Lord looketh on the heart
[1:02:21] sister could you maybe come back a
[1:02:23] little bit taller next time
[1:02:25] and could you like put a little more
[1:02:27] muscle tone on those arms
[1:02:30] is that going to please the Lord
[1:02:33] but if this sister goes home
[1:02:35] seeks God in such a way and if there's
[1:02:37] anything in her heart got a funny
[1:02:40] feeling against brother Malachi well
[1:02:42] milk I grew taller than me
[1:02:45] why did he do that I think he's got
[1:02:47] something on me
[1:02:49] he's got something against me for sure
[1:02:53] or if she's jealous of his height
[1:02:56] like I might have been
[1:03:01] ah
[1:03:04] what hey
[1:03:06] you've got to have you got a clean heart
[1:03:10] see all we have to do is keep our heart
[1:03:13] clean
[1:03:16] it doesn't matter how you look
[1:03:18] how is your heart condition
[1:03:21] that's what he's looking at he's looking
[1:03:23] right in here
[1:03:28] is there evil continually
[1:03:32] is is deep down your desire to serve the
[1:03:34] Lord 100 absolutely
[1:03:37] now are there still evil thoughts
[1:03:39] absolutely but here's your desire say
[1:03:41] Lord
[1:03:43] I'll be honest like me I always say Lord
[1:03:45] you know when somebody's body is going
[1:03:47] to
[1:03:48] be I'm gonna be perfectly serving you
[1:03:50] when I have one evil thought and the
[1:03:52] rest of my
[1:03:54] eternity
[1:03:56] so Lord that thing I just did or I said
[1:03:58] or I acted in the wrong kind of way I
[1:04:00] don't like it I want to be freed from
[1:04:02] this
[1:04:05] because it's so much better to be happy
[1:04:06] and to be joyful in the Lord than to be
[1:04:09] you say you win a thousand dollar ten
[1:04:11] thousand million dollars
[1:04:12] there's no there's no lasting joy in
[1:04:15] that
[1:04:17] I'll say like this last time I was
[1:04:19] hearing about Justin you guys were
[1:04:20] singing better as one house one betters
[1:04:22] one day in his uh course than a thousand
[1:04:24] elsewhere man I felt that song I felt
[1:04:27] that song and I come out here and I said
[1:04:29] that's how that's how I feel so to be
[1:04:32] right here I am so you hate to to give
[1:04:37] the example of like lot the Bible says a
[1:04:40] lot his his righteous Soul was vexed
[1:04:42] from day to day seeing the wickedness
[1:04:46] because we don't get to live like
[1:04:47] Abraham
[1:04:48] Abraham was out in out there by himself
[1:04:52] he lived by himself with his servants
[1:04:55] and everything was he was in charge of
[1:04:58] everything you don't don't use that you
[1:05:00] do this you do it right
[1:05:01] we have to go out in the world
[1:05:04] and I've got to hear country music
[1:05:06] blurry 24 7 of the job site
[1:05:09] and it's absolutely wretched with their
[1:05:12] singing it's horrible
[1:05:14] then you got to hear This Man costume
[1:05:16] this man costume this so tall dirty this
[1:05:18] and dirty that and that's like oh you
[1:05:20] can't even Escape it
[1:05:23] and you come here and you're just like
[1:05:25] however he's like praise the Lord
[1:05:28] we love you Lord Jesus praise God and
[1:05:31] everybody's happy no negativity
[1:05:36] man I'm like you hardly you know you
[1:05:39] invite people to church they don't come
[1:05:40] but if they get negative on jobs like
[1:05:41] guess what I'm like hey it's gonna be
[1:05:42] the right day man let's
[1:05:45] let's smile let's just be happy and just
[1:05:47] you don't want to worship God guess what
[1:05:48] I'm just going to have him get them
[1:05:49] excited to be happy you know I don't
[1:05:51] know I just don't like being negative I
[1:05:53] don't like that down timing I like
[1:05:55] depression I don't like any of that
[1:05:56] stuff
[1:05:58] he says but the Lord look at upon the
[1:06:00] heart
[1:06:01] now notice what it says here in second
[1:06:02] chronicles 28 9 he says and thou
[1:06:04] Solomon's son know thou the god of thy
[1:06:07] father and serve him with a perfect
[1:06:09] heart and with a willing mind
[1:06:12] individuals
[1:06:14] individuals you
[1:06:18] clean keep your heart clean not a root
[1:06:20] of bitterness
[1:06:22] one thing or this person
[1:06:24] or my wife or my husband or my brother
[1:06:26] or my sister or my friend or my pastor
[1:06:29] or my Deacon or this no
[1:06:32] nothing
[1:06:34] you know who you know who's one of the
[1:06:35] best Brothers I've ever seen like in
[1:06:37] taking something like that his brother
[1:06:38] Matt Leitner
[1:06:40] for the Matt leitler can can like
[1:06:42] someone can like jump in front of a line
[1:06:43] at like a buffet you know like
[1:06:46] must be hunger than me
[1:06:48] I've seen him do I've seen
[1:06:51] he takes everything straight he's just
[1:06:52] like well this guy did this to me he's
[1:06:54] like
[1:06:55] must have been the Lord's will okay
[1:06:57] he like takes it just like just keeps on
[1:06:59] going
[1:07:01] and you can literally see he he takes no
[1:07:03] offense to it just like this is my
[1:07:05] predestinated walk
[1:07:08] as David men spitting on David and
[1:07:10] trying to kill him this this and they
[1:07:11] was just like well I'm just gonna try
[1:07:13] and survive that's all I'm gonna do I'm
[1:07:14] not gonna say anything bad about the
[1:07:15] person just kind of Dodge arrows and
[1:07:16] Spears and all kinds of things and hide
[1:07:18] out in caves and this snat and however
[1:07:19] and whatever
[1:07:21] foreign God told him to do it
[1:07:27] hey man that's right
[1:07:29] now he says for the Lord shall judge the
[1:07:32] people judge me O Lord according to my
[1:07:34] righteousness and according to my
[1:07:36] Integrity that is in me oh let the
[1:07:39] wickedness of the wicked come to to an
[1:07:41] end but establish the judge the justice
[1:07:44] for the righteous God strieth the hearts
[1:07:47] and Reigns
[1:07:49] he's gonna try you
[1:07:51] oh brother I'm clean I've got nothing
[1:07:53] around somebody then the Lord lets this
[1:07:55] person that really rubbed you wrong
[1:07:57] about three years ago come back and say
[1:08:04] he's gonna try you and when you fail
[1:08:06] guess what you got to go through the
[1:08:07] test again and maybe even harder until
[1:08:09] you overcome that
[1:08:15] now notice neither is there any creature
[1:08:17] that is not manifesting his sight but
[1:08:19] all things are naked and open under the
[1:08:21] eyes of him and whom we have to do
[1:08:25] if the Lord Jesus Christ which he is
[1:08:27] right here but if he was in flesh and
[1:08:29] you got to see him in his Corporal body
[1:08:31] and he walked up to you it didn't matter
[1:08:33] if you did your hair nice or if you
[1:08:36] didn't do your hair nice
[1:08:38] he would be able to see your heart right
[1:08:41] now and know what you are all about
[1:08:44] remember Christ went to the cream of the
[1:08:48] uh the Pharisee crop
[1:08:50] went to the fair to the sadducee to the
[1:08:53] best guys their they sent their guys out
[1:08:56] and when these righteous men showed up
[1:08:59] Jesus looked at him and said
[1:09:02] you're a serpent
[1:09:04] I said Who who how do you know that he's
[1:09:06] a trust me
[1:09:09] absolutely why because he could see
[1:09:11] right into their heart and discern it
[1:09:12] what was in their heart what was it all
[1:09:14] about
[1:09:17] now
[1:09:18] I don't wanna
[1:09:20] now let's continue on here he says he
[1:09:22] says now look at the ill-fame woman she
[1:09:24] recognized that she wasn't in document
[1:09:26] made it he says the lamp on she was
[1:09:29] morally wrong of course no one would re
[1:09:32] endorse that the laws of God condemned
[1:09:34] that but she was morally wrong see God
[1:09:37] don't judge you upon what you are he's
[1:09:40] dealing with the woman with well
[1:09:41] he judges not how big or how little you
[1:09:44] are he judged your heart what you want
[1:09:46] to be
[1:09:48] everybody want to be a Christian
[1:09:50] everybody want to hear want to be the
[1:09:52] bride of Christ everybody want here want
[1:09:55] to lay their lives down and yield to the
[1:09:58] spirits to what he can work through you
[1:10:00] has he worked through you already
[1:10:03] absolutely we've all got testimonies and
[1:10:05] those sorts of things now see God judges
[1:10:07] the heart man judges the outward
[1:10:10] appearance
[1:10:13] now look how God judges right here this
[1:10:14] is a I've seen this coil like oh it's
[1:10:16] beautiful
[1:10:17] like the little woman with a pure heart
[1:10:18] and a defiled body
[1:10:22] and the Pharisee with a pure body
[1:10:25] and a defiled heart
[1:10:27] you see how you see how deceptive this
[1:10:29] can be
[1:10:31] there can be absolutely someone who's a
[1:10:33] prostitute
[1:10:35] who is completely defiled and everybody
[1:10:37] in town knows it and God says
[1:10:41] it's mine
[1:10:42] I was like
[1:10:44] a perverted Minister well what no
[1:10:48] then Christ could come up to the highest
[1:10:50] minister in the message or highest this
[1:10:52] and denomination say you're nothing but
[1:10:54] this or that you need to clean up repent
[1:10:57] because remember God knows the heart
[1:11:02] and if you keep your heart clean things
[1:11:04] of God the reward is what Thou Art well
[1:11:06] done amen now
[1:11:09] let's continue on here
[1:11:11] it condemned one and saves the other why
[1:11:14] outward appearance
[1:11:17] praise God now
[1:11:20] it's getting late let's just let's just
[1:11:22] uh
[1:11:24] let's just stand here by God's grace
[1:11:28] David says create and me a clean heart
[1:11:30] oh God I renew a right Spirit Within Me
[1:11:33] sure
[1:11:34] he says who can say I made made my heart
[1:11:36] clean I am pure for sin not a one that
[1:11:39] takes the work of the god right
[1:11:45] and look at this
[1:11:47] don't just come this far say
[1:11:50] I believe the message
[1:11:52] you obey the messenger come into what
[1:11:56] was the message coming to Christ receive
[1:11:59] the token receive the Holy Ghost
[1:12:01] you say well I believe every word said
[1:12:03] brother Graham that's good but that just
[1:12:06] makes you able to read
[1:12:09] see we can't stop at this no you've
[1:12:11] heard it and believe it we've got to
[1:12:13] receive it and manifest it take the
[1:12:16] message in your heart that you may have
[1:12:17] a token the very Life of Christ
[1:12:20] that was in Christ be in you now
[1:12:24] I want to read this real quick
[1:12:29] we're not going to okay let's just let's
[1:12:31] just jump to what I want to read
[1:12:32] remember do you guys remember
[1:12:35] Ernest Sandler's letter
[1:12:38] let me get ready here one time but I
[1:12:40] want to you to listen to this I'm going
[1:12:42] to have you read this as we okay
[1:12:44] and remember
[1:12:45] well you well we're not the biggest
[1:12:47] church and
[1:12:49] our pastor is not famous
[1:12:51] or or this or that or I'm not a big of
[1:12:53] this Robert let me tell you something
[1:12:54] this I don't know the reason why
[1:12:58] brother Branham gave this letter to
[1:13:00] Ernest Handler I don't know why but one
[1:13:02] thing we're certain he gave it to him
[1:13:03] now I've looked once I copied and pasted
[1:13:05] this into my own thing the they took
[1:13:07] this off the website for whatever reason
[1:13:09] but I still got it so let's read this
[1:13:11] together individually as individuals
[1:13:15] how special are you
[1:13:17] let's just let's look read this
[1:13:19] the High Calling of God
[1:13:23] it's called
[1:13:24] given by Brother Branham to Ernest
[1:13:26] fanler
[1:13:27] from brother Robert Goff
[1:13:30] brother Ram told Ernest fans to write a
[1:13:31] book of his life story which you can
[1:13:33] read below this exhortation so here's
[1:13:34] the letter right here
[1:13:35] if God has called you to really like to
[1:13:39] be really like Jesus in all your spirit
[1:13:41] He will draw you into life of
[1:13:44] crucifixion and humility
[1:13:48] my mom doesn't accept me my dad doesn't
[1:13:50] accept me for what I believe
[1:13:51] this this this this
[1:13:54] he will put on put such demands of
[1:13:57] obedience that he will not allow you to
[1:13:59] follow other Christians
[1:14:03] and in many ways he will seem to let
[1:14:06] other good people do things which she he
[1:14:08] will not let you do
[1:14:12] I've experienced it
[1:14:14] spanked me heavy
[1:14:16] ties in it from them on high
[1:14:19] the old spiritual leather belt comes out
[1:14:21] and uh
[1:14:24] other Christians and ministers whom seem
[1:14:28] very religious and useful may push
[1:14:30] themselves
[1:14:32] pull wires and work schemes this happens
[1:14:35] to carry out their plans
[1:14:38] but you cannot do it
[1:14:41] if you attempt it you will meet with
[1:14:44] such failure and View From The Lord as
[1:14:46] to make you sorely penitent
[1:14:51] others can brag about themselves their
[1:14:54] work their success or their writings but
[1:14:57] the holy spirit will not allow you to do
[1:14:59] any such thing
[1:15:03] if you begin it he will lead you into
[1:15:06] such deep mortification that will make
[1:15:08] you despise yourself in all your good
[1:15:10] works
[1:15:13] if you've been called to be like Jesus
[1:15:18] my others will be allowed to succeed in
[1:15:22] making great sums of money or having a
[1:15:25] legacy left to them
[1:15:26] or in other having luxuries
[1:15:30] but God May Supply you daily because he
[1:15:33] wants you to have something far better
[1:15:35] than gold and that is a helpless
[1:15:38] dependence on him
[1:15:41] that he may have the privilege of
[1:15:43] providing your needs day by day out of
[1:15:45] the Unseen Treasury
[1:15:50] well hard
[1:15:51] sounds like you might be one of these
[1:15:53] guys
[1:15:54] well the boss only pays me so much and
[1:15:57] this and this and my bills are stretched
[1:15:59] from here to here and I'm I'm splitting
[1:16:01] pennies
[1:16:04] might be the bride of Christ
[1:16:07] the Lord may let others be honored and
[1:16:09] put forward
[1:16:10] but comes but keep you hidden away and
[1:16:13] obscurity
[1:16:15] because he wants to produce some choice
[1:16:18] fragrant fruit
[1:16:20] for his coming Glory which can only be
[1:16:24] produced in the shade
[1:16:28] hmm
[1:16:32] anybody can relate to this
[1:16:34] God will others be great
[1:16:37] but keep you small
[1:16:40] he will others do a work for him and get
[1:16:42] the credit for it but he will make you
[1:16:44] work and toil on without knowing how
[1:16:46] much you are doing then to make your
[1:16:48] toil still more precious he says
[1:16:51] precious he will let others get the
[1:16:53] credit for the work which you have done
[1:16:57] and this will make a reward
[1:17:00] ten times greater when Jesus comes
[1:17:06] let's see here
[1:17:11] I better not okay
[1:17:15] we're still on this letter
[1:17:16] the holy spirit will put you strict put
[1:17:18] your strict watch on you with jealous
[1:17:21] love
[1:17:22] and we rebuke you for little words and
[1:17:26] feelings or for wasting your time ma
[1:17:29] my goodness which other Christians never
[1:17:33] seem distressed over
[1:17:36] I still feel bad even right now about
[1:17:38] some things I said 20 15 years ago which
[1:17:41] is my foreman or my boss and
[1:17:43] I probably should make those things call
[1:17:45] them and they know nothing about it but
[1:17:46] I said it under my granddaughter
[1:17:49] not swear words just
[1:17:52] or something like that you know
[1:17:56] so make up your mind that God is an
[1:17:59] infinite Sovereign and has the right to
[1:18:01] do as he pleases with his own
[1:18:07] why am I like this
[1:18:09] well you must be the other earnest
[1:18:12] fanlers
[1:18:13] he will not explain to you a thousand
[1:18:16] things which may puzzle your reason in
[1:18:18] his dealings with you
[1:18:20] why this why did this happen to me
[1:18:23] why did that take place sister brother
[1:18:27] I still don't understand this part of my
[1:18:29] life
[1:18:31] not he might not answer you
[1:18:33] hope so
[1:18:36] God God will take you at your word if
[1:18:39] you will absolutely love will yourself
[1:18:41] to be his slave
[1:18:43] he will wrap you up in a jealous love
[1:18:45] and let other people say and do many
[1:18:47] things that you cannot do or say
[1:18:52] I'll say like this
[1:18:53] and the Lord open up deeds and neglatans
[1:18:55] to me and brother Kim
[1:18:57] I thought
[1:18:58] everyone's going to see this
[1:19:02] but I thought I thought the same thing
[1:19:03] when I saw baptism in the name of Jesus
[1:19:05] Christ
[1:19:06] I was like oh my whole entire youth
[1:19:08] group is coming into the message because
[1:19:09] they're going to see it guess what
[1:19:12] didn't even see it
[1:19:16] he says settle it forever that you are
[1:19:18] to deal directly with the Holy Spirit
[1:19:21] also that he is to have the privilege of
[1:19:24] tying your tongue or changing her hand
[1:19:27] or closing your eyes in ways that others
[1:19:30] are not dealt with
[1:19:33] he's trying to make you a love slave
[1:19:36] to him
[1:19:38] did not tape Paul say he goes I am a
[1:19:40] prisoner to Christ
[1:19:43] look what God did in his life as a
[1:19:45] prisoner to Christ
[1:19:48] because he was always in the will of God
[1:19:50] what building the kingdom in the
[1:19:52] father's business

[1:20:09] everything God allows you you're just
[1:20:11] waiting for uh uh this money or you're
[1:20:13] waiting for this or you're waiting for
[1:20:14] that you're just and then you find

[1:20:28] jealous Guardianship and management of
