========================================

[Music] and everything is [Music] it was [Music] amazing yes [Music] what's up man never ever [Music] yeah friends [Music] Christmas the Lord [Music] my son hey Jesus foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] remember [Applause] things [Music] foreign [Music] amen thank you sir appreciate you let's go to First John 3 verse 9 first John 3 verse 9. you know Wednesday I just went off a taught on a subject I never taught before ye are gods and I hope that was a blessing I thought well since I'm not really in a series I'll just preaching I thought I never preached before yet so it's I preached numerous ideas about it but there's a specific quote where brother Brandon said it's as though you never did it in the first place so I'd like to preach on that this morning as though you never did it in the first place it's a pretty long title so I want to work with that here today as though you never did it in the first place of course brother Adam preached this in the sermon November 25th 1965 in of the Heavenly bride and the Earthly brighter beautiful message if you haven't listened to it for a while that's a beautiful message so there's a lot of popular quotes you know message preachers use in this sermon I've heard over the years and so I'll be going through some of those here by the grace of God I want to read out of two portions of scripture First John 3 verse 9 and then Romans 7 17. so First John 3 9. thank you doing a great great job vacation thank you let's read this on three one two three whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God now of course this speaks of the Soul it's the part of the Soul where God's spirit dwells Hallelujah if you're to have eternal life you have to have you have to actually possess eternal life if if you're going to live eternally how many can say amen and that life wasn't your own it had to come from God so the part the anointing in your soul that came from God never sinned it can never sin and it's the divine nature of God praise God now Romans 7 17 Paul so I like that John both John and Paul wrote about this now in a little different language but we still get the same idea that just like a just like a a child has the seed of his father and the genetic makeup of his mother and father in the natural in the spiritual we also have God's spiritual genetics in our in our Souls praise God Hallelujah in other words God has we have God's own life inside of our souls praise God so Romans 7 17. now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me amen do you ever need on your heart let's make it known unto God and we'll have one more word of prayer father God we just want a closer walk with you what a beautiful song nor do to be singing as we come into the word of God that's why we're here your words are spirit and their life so let the holy spirit that wrote these words Lord come and Quicken these words to the hearts of your children this morning Father God we are rejoicing in your promises God we rejoice in you we commit everything into your hand Lord because you are the one who makes all decisions you declare the beginning from the end Hallelujah and no man can tell you what to do Lord you don't need our counsel Lord God you don't need our thoughts or our opinions we need your thoughts we need your mind we need the mind of Christ so help us Lord today Hallelujah to have the mind of Christ Lord God and may you just move in our lives God and we'll be thankful and and will magnify your Holy Name we'll glorify you for all that you do in our lives God because you are good you are kind you're merciful Lord Jesus you are trustworthy and you're worthy of Our Praise so we give you thanks and praise anoint your people today with the Holy Ghost myself included those listening as well in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated there praise God so we'll just trust the Lord here to minister by the Holy Spirit and of course we'll have a second service this evening here looking forward to that so we we read our text now uh I didn't read verse 20 but verse 20 of Romans 7 essentially says the same thing so again my title is is as though you never did it in the first place and and I believe this is part of rightly dividing uh brother Ram's sermons um I think now you know uh I'm up to I think 79 human human mistakes brother man made on the tapes yet he's still a prophet because uh he's a man and all men make mistakes and uh and you know I've been criticized you know some people think I keep track of that because I'm trying to criticize brother Brown I'm not I'm keeping track of that to make the side that worships him look foolish in in hopes they'll repent of their sins of worshiping brother Brandon like I did a blog post earlier I'm sorry late last year I said our 64 when I had the list of 64 I wrote Our 64 proofs enough how many proofs do you need to to realize that brother Ram was not infallible that he was a man that he was human and he made mistakes but you'd be surprised you'd be surprised 64 apparently wasn't enough because that demonic Spirit if they worship that demonic spirit that Spirit of deity then they'll never they'll never turn from until they expose Satan until they can recognize uh their their folly um and you know I just found another one this week you know brother random said he said I I can't interpret the word think about that brother man said I can't interpret the word but then other quotes say only a prophet can interpret the word of God so if that quote I can't interpret the word is thus say the Lord their brother is not a prophet according to his own words you see how foolish these you know see how see how sad it is when people get an evil spirit on them now it's true in one sense no man can interpret the word but a prophet is allowed by God to interpret the word that God interprets himself okay so you know as I love the tapes I listen to the tapes all the time you know and I hear these things and I just make a list of them this is now this is one of the quotes that I feel like I need to rightly divide uh and I'll get to this later because preachers misapply this statement uh they kind of make it sound like you know you never sinned and the the the the mistake the mistake of that is that well then if you never sin why do you need the blood of Jesus that's the mistake when the devil takes it too far does everybody understand like well then why did I need Jesus if I never sin to begin with so and and it's the same group that's saying they're the greatest of all time so I just you know I felt I've been wanting to preach this for months and months and months I've had this in my I have an email with like 15 sermon thoughts I got an email I email myself with 40 YouTube video thoughts you know I just kind of keep a running list of all these thoughts there's never enough time to preach all these thoughts so anyways let's just get started here by God's grace so let's look at our opening text you know we've you've heard me say this before people say it all the time context is King in other words you gotta if you have one scripture to understand that you need to look at all the scriptures around it because that will give us the correct understanding of what the author actually meant um and so we want to do that with these quotes here today these scriptures so our first opening quote was the seed of God cannot sin uh and so we ended actually Wednesday night with these verses behold what manner of love the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God so I thought I was very inspired I thought well holy spirit I do believe you are leading to me to this because it picks up where I left off because we don't call ourselves Gods but we are children of God now we have a scripture we could say well the Bible calls us Gods we could say that but I don't want to cause anybody to stumble and I don't want anyone ever to look at me I want them to see Christ I don't want them to think I'm anything because without God I am nothing um therefore the world knoweth us not that's why your friends and you know your co-workers and some family members they don't understand you because they don't understand Christ beloved now not not next week not next year not at the Rapture now we are the sons of God and it doth not yet appear what we shall be so we've never seen a glorified body right we I've never seen a theophany I've read about it but we've never seen it to praise God but we know that when Jesus shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and we will have a body like on his glorious body now every man that has this hope in him how many have a hope to see Jesus amen hallelujah if you have that hope and I remember amen shared this scripture about his dad remember that brother uh everyone that has this hope purifies himself now you can't purify your soul so this is purifying your mind praise God right you I mean you you allow the Holy Ghost to come into your soul it quickens your soul right uh so one way you know your soul does get a life but but this is John's writing to people that are already Christians these aren't people that haven't been baptized or haven't been filled with Holy Ghost these are people that are filled with the Holy Ghost and later on he says you know there's many antichrists in the world he said but you've got anointing you've got anointing to teach you all things praise God he's talking to Believers here so Believers how do Believers purify themselves they mortify the evil habits in their flesh so if you're hoping to see Jesus church which I am too let's purify ourselves even as we are pure our souls are praised God but we got to purify our mind amen whoso commit a sin transgresses also the law Moses for sin is the transgression of the law and ye know that he Jesus was manifested to take away our sins and in him is no sin whosoever abides in him Sins Not So this means what do you mean abiding in him Jesus talked about that in John chapter 15. if you abide in me and I my words abide in you then ask what you will and it shall be given to you so this means walking in the spirit in other words you're going about your day and you're trying not to sin and the church said see there's times where we're where we're at we're actually walking in Disobedience we know we've sinned and we've got bad habit we're in a bad habit but we've got to confess that habit and we've got to walk in the spirit and actually fight against that lust of the eyes less of the flesh or the pride of life praise God we've got to walk against that and when we are doing that when we're fighting against that sin and trying not to walk in it then the Bible says we're abiding in Christ and whosoever sinneth not hath not seen him I'm sorry whosoever sinneth hath not seen him neither known to him okay so in other words whoever remains in sin whoever stays addicted to sin but if we walk in this is true because earlier in the same book he said if we walk in the light as he's in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from us and US everybody say us that means the Believers John was writing to we've got to walk in the light as we walk in the light we're forgiven by the blood and he forgives us of all of our current sins that we have now don't get me wrong the the cross of Jesus Christ forgave you of your past sins present sins and future sins praise God but it was an all-in-one payment remember it was all in one payment with all the sins anyone would ever commit remember they were all nailed to the cross praise God any sin that and all the Believers would ever commit he paid for the sins of the whole world the Bible says but then in time in time we actually we actually commit sins and then we've got to confess them and we got to keep walking in the light of God praise God because God knows of beginning from the end but that's true but but we're in time now this is the testing time amen Hallelujah this is our time to overcome this is our time to have a testimony that we love Jesus Christ amen we've got it we've got to go through the drama this is the time that we're on stage amen and we've got to overcome the wicked one praise God this is our time to do it but Jesus Paid the penalty for it all praise God now if we say we have no sin well I'm a little God I have no sin see we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US if we confess our sins though he's faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from All unrighteousness I'm going to keep telling that to the devil devil he forgave all my sins all my unrighteousness not some not just you know up until this day all my sins praise God if we say we've not sinned we make God a liar and his word is not in US so that's the danger again of this of this using this quote from Brother Branham I never did in the first place if we say we haven't sinned we make God a liar for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God right Romans chapter three most of us got that memorized by heart if you don't now's a good time to memorize that little children let no man deceive you he righteousness is righteous even as he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sinneth from the beginning for the this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil aren't you glad Church all your sinful life it was destroyed Jesus destroyed your past sinful life praise God people might remember it uh you know you might remember parts of it but God has destroyed the evidence of that sin praise God there's no evidence of that in in heaven it's been forgiven praise God oh my God and then and then under this context the context that you know God sees us as righteous God sees us as his children under this context that that God has destroyed the works of Satan in our lives yet we're battling Satan every day under this context he says if you're born of God you have God's seed inside you and that seed that's inside of you cannot sin Hallelujah that's why your mind is fighting against sin because your soul cannot sin praise God Amen your soul has an anointing that cannot sin that won't that doesn't that won't sin Hallelujah but there you live in it we live in our conscience in our mind and we choose a Sin at times but the soul is trying to influence influence us to purify our minds and not to give into sin praise God now I've often gone I've often battled with this you know uh brother cam use that quote from another brand where he says you don't have to sin and that's true I guess I you know and then brother man says you sin every day well I guess you could I mean all things are possible with God you could make it through a day without sinning so let's strive for that praise God I just want to give grace to the to us though when we make mistakes not to feel condemned of the devil because there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ amen and who can lay any charge to God's elect amen see so I'm trying to find the right balance and I'm still learning and growing as a Christian I mean it's a all things are possible you might have made it through a day without sinning one time you might have got tempted but you might have cast it down praise God don't don't let me hinder you praise God don't don't let anybody hinder you amen have the mind of Christ overcome make it a day without any giving in to sin praise God Amen Hallelujah I don't want to discourage anybody you know I often think about that and it just kind of came to my mind it wasn't even in my notes so I distrusted bless somebody now in this context verse 10 in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever doeth not righteousness this is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother all right so in other words God you know God through the holy spirit is telling John look at the overall fruit of your life are you producing fruit of a Believer or fruit of a sinner we're producing the fruit of believers we're working Righteousness Church that's why I always say if you are praying fasting and giving alms if you're doing those three things from John or from Matthew chapter 6 from Jesus Sermon on the Mount the devil can't tell you you're not doing works of righteousness because that make that that's the effects of righteousness you want to pray to your heavenly father you want to help the poor you have eternal life you're living for other people you recognize God's food is greater than your own food you can buy praise God Hallelujah and you fast in other words you're Desiring a spiritual feast in the Lord amen you're Desiring God's meat praise God hallelujah you're Desiring to talk to your heavenly father and you care about other people praise God so as we focus on those things remember that is God working righteousness in you and then God keeps track of it in heaven praise God Glory Our Lives should be moving more towards righteousness Our Lives should be purified Hallelujah now this scripture proves when we're born again in the soul it's the Holy Ghost is like a seed seeing you have purified your soul so yeah you you do purify yourself with the baptism of holy ghost in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned so that's real love of the brother not pretend love see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently okay that's what I was preaching at Cam's last week I knew I ended the morning service with that scripture we gotta love each other fervently praise God that means continually show your love to other people hallelujah being born again not of corruptable seed but of the incorruptable by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever for All Flesh is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass withereth and the flower and the flower thereof falleth away now you always see I don't know I go to Newsmax for my news and sometimes they'll have ads there and they'll say uh look how this person uh who is famous during the 60s look how they look now or look at this person from the 70s look what they look like now it's just a good reminder no matter how beautiful or handsome people think there are if time goes on they're eventually going to get old so we don't put trust in our our flesh we don't put confidence in the flesh we put confidence in God hallelujah this is all it all goes fast it all goes it all Withers away anything in the natural Withers away but the word of God endures forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you praise God thank God Amen our bodies will get old our bodies will get tired and everything will wear down things will get uh these are feel old but the word of God does not become like that the word of God is always fresh amen it's always fresh it's always alive amen it's always got something present that we have need of hallelujah it's always living and active and moving that's what God's word is praise God it does it wither away it's Eternal praise God remember the parable The Parables is the seed is the word of God so the seed of God fell on every in every heart but the good heart the fruitful heart which is we what is what we believe we are on the good ground are they with which an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and bring forth fruit with patience Hallelujah if you want God to fully move in your life you got to be patient Hallelujah you got to weed out all the cares of the world now what as I've told you with my wife's uh backyard garden we gotta weed it almost every day now I'd never do that but if you want to stay up on it you need to do that praise God I do it like twice a summer but if you really want to and search if we want to keep our hearts uh pure from from Weeds of lies or weeds of deception or weeds of lusts right or or weeds of Pride we got to eat it every day Hallelujah we got we got to be patient with God we've got to know that God's seed if it's planted in the right ground and it gets water and it meets all the conditions it will produce fruit praise God oh it's going to produce something in my life my life's not going to be hopeless my not my life's not going to be useless my life is going to bring forth fruit to Christ Hallelujah amen I see that my life I hope you see in yours where you see your life has produced good fruit the fruits of the spirit I'm going to read that real quick since I'm right there Galatians 5 I'm gonna read that real quick you don't have to turn there unless you really like I really want to let me just read that again but the fruit of the spirit is love do people see love in your life do they see joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law that's we want people to see we want an honest and good heart and church is okay to be honest and say well I'm really struggling with patients right now where I'm really struggling with love right now that all it means is God has pruned you and it's going to grow back greater praise God that's all it means praise God it's a fruit of the spirit the spirit of God is going to produce this in my life my life is going to be fruitful praise God God's seed will produce of its own kind praise God now what I'm waiting for is a revelation on that scripture Jesus says 34 60-fold hundredfold that's what I'm waiting for a little better Revelation on that what does that mean I've always wondered even my brother Paul asked me what does that mean I don't know does that mean one seed has a certain genetic code in it where it can produce a hundred fold more than another seed that's exactly the same I don't know I'm not a farmer but I should like to know that answer praise God for example like a tree like what makes one tree put for let's say ten thousand apples but another tree just puts forth a thousand apples right you'd have to be what's written in the seed right the genetics of the seed and also the conditions that it's in so that's what I'm waiting for I'm waiting for a humble farmer to walk in here one of these days and give me that revelation maybe ask Lydia's uh employer there that might be a good idea remember don't forget this man is a three-part being may God sanctify you completely how many one complete sanctification that means cleaned out and set aside for service brother Adam tells us let me read another general definition of that since I got it right here maybe one that's kind of uh maybe like an official one here sometimes I think these thoughts come to me right when I'm preaching them I like to look at my there it is sanctify you holy okay thanks for your patience for about that 30 seconds there sanctify means to make holy to make clean to ceremonial ceremonially purify or consecrate to venerate to Hollow to be holy to sanctify okay so to make clean to make separate so God is going to make your thoughts separate from the thoughts of the devil that that ought to be good news everybody here praise God he's going to sanctify you completely praise God and I pray God your whole Spirit that's your mind and your soul and your body be preserved blameless now look at that blameless Satan can't put one blame on you now how's that going to be possible that's the miracle of Jesus blood amen That's The Power of Jesus's forgiveness unto the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ you have your body right very familiar spirit and mind and then you have your soul that's where we want the seed of God praise God that's where God's seed comes in there uh and he wants all of us Sanctified so each part of us must be pure we must have pure thoughts that's where the greatest battle ever fought is right we must have a pure Soul we must keep our bodies pure from temptation as well amen remember this anointing on the soul it's only one ceiling I think I preach at brother cams I think it helped out the church I heard the church say oh amen you're not sealed over and over again it's not it's not your soul is baptized today and now your soul is baptized tomorrow it's one ceiling it's one baptism until the day of your Redemption praise God and all it means is a quick and see the fire of God has anointed your soul and then that seed begins to push out its life praise God now I just love visuals so I just thought I'd share this this is from the end time message website that brother from Philippines I agree with a lot of you that what he teaches not everything but in your spirit you know your spirit is your intelligence your mind your brain you have your conscious memory reason affection imagination on your human Spirit your body of course your five senses see taste uh feel smell here your soul brother ram calls it your control tower that's where all the that's where the the leadership of the Lord comes from your soul he calls it the real you which is what Paul says he said I didn't sin it's a he said I didn't sin it's the sin that dwells within me the soul that part of God the predestinated seed that dwells in your heart that's what we also call the soul you're also the this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost uh the sixth sense of faith yeah I did for study on that a little more uh eternal life of course the Baptist Holy Ghost is eternal life the spirit of God is eternal you're saved and Redeemed by the blood of Jesus and then and then this just gives another visual of the three parts that I just showed so you have soul spirit and body I just I like visual as a you know when I first come in the message I was downloading all these you know I was like click download click download I'm Gonna Save that I love visuals I like I like to learn like that I mean that's why I'm a teacher I guess I don't know uh I like this one too you have your your soul Spirit body but we have all these other influences right Temptation ambition Fame honor want trial stress threats necessity problems sickness fear hatred Envy lust Pride mouths contentions all these influence are trying to get in but we gotta we gotta push him out by God's grace we got to raise up the shield of faith and the Bible said you can stop every fiery Dart of Satan praise God you just got to raise up your faith raise up your Revelation raise up your trust in God and I and you got to say I'm not going to let this strike me I'm not going to let this hurt me I'm going to overcome praise God we'll not let I will not let these influences affect me now remember now brother Brown before the before 1963 brother man taught the spirit was the deepest part of man but after he says it's the soul just as you're listening you'll hear him say that and I just want again I like those visuals it's very helpful just so you understand how brother Graham had to grow in Revelation just like we grow in Revelation now back to the context we know the law is spiritual but I'm carnal sold under sin for that which I do I allow not for what I would that I do not but what I hate that I do now look Paul had seen Jesus in a vision three years out in Arabia three years in the desert with Jesus but he still goes on his missionary trips and then he says I still do things that I hate praise God think about that normally you know you might think well if I could just have this miracle if I could just see Jesus in a vision I wouldn't struggle anymore I got news for you you're going to struggle every day maybe that's why God doesn't give us more Supernatural things because he wants us to not trust and experiences he wants us to trust in the word Jesus didn't overcome Satan with let me show you this let me show you this power let me shoot fire out of my hands and he said it is written it is also written he overcame just by quoting the word of God but don't get me wrong I believe in power I believe in the Holy Ghost but I also believe in Overcoming By the word of God Amen amen just Overcoming By obeying the word and standing behind the protection and the fortification of God's word hallelujah he's a man who's met with Jesus off and on for three years straight to write these books of the Bible and yet he says I still do things that I hate now how many could be honest the operation but you say I do things that I hate sometimes if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is good in other words I'm saying in one part of me like it's okay to break the law it's okay to sin now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me so Paul here now goes in this thought the same thought John would write about you know 30 years later 40 years later that Paul recognized Christ is in me he said but yeah also sin is in me so when I sin it's not the Christ part of me the anointed part of me it's the sin part of me praise God I know this is review but I just want to uh preach it I know sir may not have heard us uh often so I know assamina might need this too I say like this I need it praise God I constantly need reminders that I've got a part of me that it's really not me praise God that sinful part that's the part I don't like either that's the part I really hate I hate it that's what Paul said I hate I do things that I hate for I know that it that in me that is in my flesh dwelt no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not I want to obey the word I want to cast down these imaginations but sometimes I don't find the power to do it I want to overcome I want to live two days perfect in a row whatever you whatever don't let me hinder your faith three days in a row three weeks in a row I don't want to hinder your faith praise God the man said like Enoch he said he said if I don't have the faith of Enoch to take a Rapture and we'll just walk right into it he said I never want to hinder anybody anybody else that would have that kind of faith but see when I I want to do what's right so maybe I want to fast I want to pray I want to give alms I want to go pray for the sick person but when I I want to do it I don't I don't actually know how to perform that praise God for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do see church we gotta we've gotta we've got to learn to live with disappointments we disappoint ourselves and yes it disappoints God not in Eternal sense but in a in a short-term time sense right we grieve the Holy Spirit there it is praise God we got to learn to quickly recover like I said when we play football I made a bad decision I made I made a bad uh play and they say Turn the Page Jesse turn the Paige Smith they'd say whatever they'd say turn the pace man in other words forget about the past we've got more battles ahead praise God amen that's what Paul's saying I hate these things right Evil's always present but I've gotta I gotta move on I can't I kind of I gotta separate that wasn't the real Jesse that wasn't the real amen that was the sinful part inside of me but I've also got a Christ part inside of me praise God for I Delight CeCe I Delight I hate the sin that I do I but I also at the same time I Delight in the law of God in the inward part of me I love the preaching but then sometimes I disobey it and I hate when I do that but I see another law of my members war and against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity see we when we sin we become a slave to that sin short short term or temporarily right like I'm just gonna be honest last night I couldn't even hardly sleep it took me over an hour to fall asleep because a spirit of fear came on me I remembered how Trump was gonna might get arrested and so I started thinking about the Rapture and I thought I thought about it am I going to get arrested I mean I just laid there for over an hour and I just had to pray I said Lord Jesus I'm trusting you with all my heart and I'm not going to lean to my own understanding I was all happy going to bed I'm like praise God I want to get into bed for church tomorrow and then the spirit of fear just comes on me because I've got to pray myself out of it thank God I finally fell asleep by God's grace I just got to quote the word of God until I can fall asleep but there's a lot there's see it brings you into captivity you can't get away from it that's all you think about right that's you hate that you do that I hate that I do that but I'm human and I've got to overcome praise God I got to overcome the law of sin and I got led by the law of God hallelujah verse 24 oh Wretched Man that I am no we so this is the beauty of contacts here Paul says I never sinned it was sin that dwelleth in me but what does he still call himself I think we dealt with this with uh Lena's sister right uh when Lena's sister was out here she's sweet of course but uh one of the conversations we had was where we we always speak we're full of power we're full of power and we're children of God right those are all good things but we can't let that become a pride issue because at the same time Paul said I'm a wretched person as well in other words like I'm not I you know we just gotta say I'm so full of power I'm a I'm a lowercase God I'm a Creator we got to be careful how much Faith we're speaking right we got to be careful remember do you remember when we talked about that a little bit kinda yeah I remember because we I think Austin and I were talking about it yeah that's okay no no you got a good memory you gotta get married I'm speaking it but this is the balance to it right we gotta have got to know where we're children of God we're called by God God's spirit is with us but at the same time recognize we're wretched the flesh now oh Wretched Man that I am now he he even used I am right oh Wretched Man that I am he said before he said I don't sin it's the sin the dwell within me he said I didn't do it it was sin but now he says o Wretched Man that I am so St George this teaches us as Christians we have to recognize all three parts of us are a part of our being now say like this we got to be responsible for all three parts you're responsible for crucifying the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life you're responsible for transforming your mind praise God you can't blame it and say that brother answer you can't say the devil made me do it he can't make you do it you got to get into it praise God see and then when we when we when we make a mistake then we got to confess and say I'm sorry Lord forgive me I'm walking back in the light I praise God I'm walking in the in the light where the blood of Jesus forgives me praise God oh my thank God oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me from the body of this death I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God but with the flesh the law of sin so see we don't we don't see Paul saying he's the greatest Christian of all time we don't see a bride Pride message in here now don't get me wrong in the next chapter he says there's no condemnation for me nobody can lay any charge to me I'm more than a conqueror nothing can separate me from the love of God how many feel like you know how many how many people with the gospel uh you know so often we're going back and we're going back and forth between the mind and the soul I do it all throughout the day I feel powerful powerful powerful in the spirit and then I'll be battling in my mind I'm like what happened to my power praise God you're just you go back and forth right that's what he's doing I don't sin but then he says arrest you man I am so it's learning to battle these three Realms that we live in now here's the origin of the sermon if you haven't listened to it or it's been a while it's from Louisiana brother man preached us there in Shreveport now this court towards the end of the sermon it's like the second to last thing before he closes the sermon he says you're standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now see as we go off the air just a minute you're standing if you're standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every job every Tittle where are you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from those shucks and get out here in the wheat where you can ripe before the sun the son I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place Hallelujah now notice the words there as though and like it's it's not that you never sin because we just read where Paul said I sin I did it I'm wretched okay so he says get out of the the shuck or what the shuck is like the chaff so the chaff is the previous Revival that denominated on gifts now like I showed you in Azusa Street it was genuine they had tongues then they had interpretations the blind received their sight praise God hallelujah my goodness they had prophecies about the city of Los Angeles that come to pass but see now look where it's at now look look how the word of God has moved on and look at them look at Pentecostal churches now they wear sexy clothes right they break all the Holiness standards they speak in tongues and no one interprets it which is confusion Babylon right and they just get they have as much Scandal as the Catholic church or any other I mean they sin just as much as any other churches right now no doubt there's a few saved in there but there's a few saved in every group but this I just want to give you illustration this is where God has moved he's moved past that and now he says we're supposed to be living in the grain right the grain is the present truth it's what God is preaching to us right now and Peter said be established in the presence room praise God and then the present truth is the bride is making herself ready for the coming of Jesus praise God coming out of denominations right and coming into Christ who is the word amen Oh Glory thank you Jesus boy talk about a Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful than that for anything that I know of you are the pure virtuous sinless bride of of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born in the spirit of God in washing the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never did it you never sinned it the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ now again he never said you never sinned he said but it's as though you never sinned all right now there's the same quote but let me let me let me re uh remind you when I preach on the Colossians series I'm still not done with that I got to finish chapter three and four but remember when I preached this last last summer in the body of Jesus's flesh through death he presents you holy and unreprovable well I thought I'd get a little more Amen on that one let me uh let me read that again to present you holy that means cleaned out right we just saw it was Sanctified and you're unblameable that means without blemish and you're free from faultiness that's something that's what the Greek says free from false Jesus bride is free from faults amen that means he's not looking at your faults praise God and also on top of that you can't find it he doesn't put any faults on you and you're unreprovable which means blameless or you you're unaccused no one is standing there accusing the bride now I know the Bible says he accused us day and night before God right but God doesn't take that accusation because the blood is there amen Hallelujah in it now look it's his size not Satan's sight it's not even your side brother Austin brother amen it's not even your side it's God's side praise God when God looks at you he sees your unaccused you're blameless you don't have any faults no blemish you're spotless praise God that's what the Bible says amen Hallelujah and this is all based upon your desires right God gives us the desire of our heart if you continue in the faith ground and settled if so there's always the human element do you want to be saved do you want to be without accusers do you want to be without blemish who wants to be holy here today well if you want it you can have it he says all those who call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved amen and I've called so I know I'm saved praise God I know this applies to me because the blood of Jesus Christ has forgiven all my sins amen Oh Glory also now we go to Ephesians 5 that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word that he might present his bride to himself as a glorious church not having spot now think about think about your worst sin that you struggle with maybe it's guilt maybe it's lust maybe it's fear how do we picture ourselves we picture ourselves like coming before God and we have all these spots on us what does the Bible say we'll say the Bible say when we confess our sins all the spots are washed away we gotta we gotta start taking what the word says about us I mean I'm talking I'm preaching to me Church I know I'm preaching to all of us praise God my biggest struggle your biggest struggle we see it as oh look at this sin State all over my beautiful white garments but the Bible says when we confess it he washes us and we don't have any spots praise God I hope someday by God's grace spiritually you know we can understand that after we sin we confess our sins we can look down and we can see that we have no spots now I always got to take my pants to the dry cleaners because I always got spots on them but I think today I have no spots that actually might work out pretty good for today's lesson amen yeah pretty good no spots really am I I sit with my children my lap and they'll spill food on my lap when you were little you were little I always have all this food all over here but actually pretty clean today Hallelujah well that means they've been washed praise God and that means when we pray we say God I'm sorry I want to walk in this mirror we can look down at our garments and God don't see the spots we don't see any spots amen he's washed us that fast that clean praise God he does it quickly praise God he does it it's just by the Holy Spirit praise God Amen you don't have you even have a wrinkle right now I like pleats right I like these pleats right here but there's no wrinkles how many uh don't raise your hand but how many spent time yesterday making sure you had no wrinkles in your clothes well I don't want I don't want the pastor to see that I don't want their brothers I don't want my friends to see that the Bible said you don't even have any wrinkles your garments are all cleaned out Hallelujah everything's ironed out of your past brother Hallelujah all those doubts and all those mistakes or all the fears I have it's all but everything's smoothed out praise God hallelujah everything's ready to go I'm looking clean I'm ready to come before God what did it it wasn't me it was him that washed me praise God it's him that sent me to the dry cleaners praise God hallelujah because brother bear says you stand as though you never did it this is a woman that sounds like she never did it she has no spot no wrinkle anything is wrong nothing's wrong with her clothes Hallelujah now what we have church is a missed application love you buddy God bless you Lord Jesus Christ anoint you for work today buddy love you well we'll pray for your next job too by God's grace Hallelujah yeah we'll pray that he'll get a different job by the grace of the Lord now see the what the misapplication happens I've heard the preachers over emphasize this and uh to take the guilt away but if you take that too far then we then we don't need nor appreciate the cross because apparently we didn't even sin to begin with okay but you never see that in the Bible we just saw it with Paul we just saw it with John both men both men said it's not really me but then they say I hate what I did it's like there's two people amen it's like two persons dual personality now look at the contacts he has raised us up together made us to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that in the ages that come he might show the exceeding Riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is a gift of God you didn't save yourself by being so holy I didn't say myself because I was so holy he say Me by Grace amen he gave me a favor he actually even gave me Faith to believe amen it's a gift praise God see the Bible says we'll spend ages and we'll look at wow God was so gracious the brother amen and sister Hua right wow God was so kind to Sister Naomi and her family there the rich in his kindness towards we'll spend years look how kind God was to Malachi and Lydia I'm trying to use people in the church you know he's going to spend ages going through look how kind I was look at the grace I poured out on my people amen Hallelujah and when Revelation 5 when he taken the book The Four beasts and the four twenty Elders fell down before the lamb having everyone them Harps and golden vials full of odors which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song Amen imagine that singing new songs in heaven Hallelujah Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain it has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth think about that the Holy Spirit flew over Ghana and said I want to find some people that want to be redeemed and so he found Naomi's family praise God and the blood redeemed it and that word redeems means a Marketplace so God saw all the ghanaians and he said well I'm going to redeem some of them all those that want to be redeemed and Jesus bought and paid for your price Jesus bought you out of that Marketplace and he's redeemed you you're no longer in the marketplace you're a free child amen glory and then he flew over America amen hallelujah and he saw a bunch of sinners in the marketplace he said I believe that one wants to be saved I know that one desert and there's brother brother Jesse and there's brother brother amen and there's Austin Lena and he and he went into the marketplace of America he said I'm going to pay for them I'm going to redeem them I'm going to bring them out of the marketplace amen they are mine the price has been paid no one can lay a claim on them I bought them amen and now I'm going to wash them now I'm gonna take them home and wash them like little children yeah every Saturday you know my wife does the baths you know and Zion every time I see him I get home and he comes out and say Daddy I had a bat today and he looks so he smells so fresh and so clean that's what redeemed means it reminds us of Hosea remember Hosea God told the prophet go marry a harlot now you would think I'm gonna preach on this one amen who it just came in the message right that was a very wonderful sermon I wept and cried after that one that beautiful message that God gave us in the word of God not because I preached it but God said go Mary Harlot and then they had a uh two children and he named them words uh that would uh represent what Israel was doing to God and then his wife Gomer right ran away from him and then one day Hosea the prophet's down at the marketplace and he sees the indentured servants being sold and the Bible said oh I'm sorry before he went down there the holy spirit said thus saith the Lord go get a woman beloved of her friend yet an adulteress according to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel who look to other gods and love flagons of wine in other words the holy spirit said leave your home and go by your adulterous wife your Harlot wife go buy her back to show my love for Israel think about that you're already living under the shame that she left you she's living with all these other men she got drunk the Bible said drunk flaggins of wine she's worshiping Idols out there yeah as Hosea was faithful raising his children in the things of God and your spouse you ran away and uh just a shame you know uh degraded your whole family and now the holy spirit says go show Mercy to that person and go purchase them back and so hey I takes Hosea takes thus saith the Lord and he said so I went to her at the marketplace and for 15 pieces of silver and for Homer barley and a half Homer of barley I love this Hosea lays out the exact price that was paid oh my and church Jesus laid out the exact price that was paid praise God it was a spotless lamb it was a Holy Lamb all the sins of the world were placed on his shoulders praise God and he walked the road to Calvary and he died for us praise God he told us the whole price the whole price was all of our sins amen it was a holy sinless son and all the sin was placed upon him but he's willing to pray the full price amen he had to get whipped 39 times Hallelujah he had to pay the full price Hallelujah he had to be slapped and mocked and spit on and his bear ripped out he had to be mocked and made fun of he went through all the entire price so he could redeem back an Unfaithful woman and church we were all Unfaithful until Christ the faithful one came and purchased Our Lives amen and now we can be what somewhat faithful if you can make it through the whole day praise God keep going make it through two days make it through make it as much as you can be as faithful as you can to Jesus praise God Hallelujah because that's what he did for us and then after he bought her imagine he carries her you know she's in she's in Chains she's she's being sold in a market he carries there and says listen to her Thou shalt abide for me many days You're Gonna you're gonna live with me many days you're not going to run away this time you ran from your children you ran from your husband but this time you're not going to run away because I've got thus say the Lord praise God Amen I shall not play the Harlot anymore and thou shalt not be for another man you're not going to go sleep in those other men's house anymore you're just going to stay with me all these days so I also will be for thee and I'll be faithful to you even though you weren't faithful to me I'll be faithful to you imagine him carrying her Hallelujah so this is a type of Hosea redeeming his wife out of the market and that's what that Greek word means we're redeemed out of every Kindred praise God every nationality Jesus went to every nationality and said I want to find my bride where's my bride there she is I'm going to pick up brother Jesse and I'm going to tell him I'm going to forgive you of all that you did and you're going to be faithful to me you're not going to live in that denomination anymore you're not going to be an adulterer with the world anymore now you're going to be faithful to me praise God because I bought you you're mine oh thank God Amen praise God thank the Lord this is the same redemption in Titus 2 14. but let's let's read that Titus 2 14. Timothy Titus yes right after a second Timothy Titus 2 14. so the same Greek word for redeemed out of uh Revelation 5 is used in Titus Chapter 2 Verse 14. who gave himself for us like Jose had to pay the full price he had to give of himself that he might redeem us from how much iniquity Church all of our liquid and purify unto himself a peculiar people who are zealous of good works that's why I always bring up praying fasting and alms we should be zealous to do something for God and first reason I bring that up is because most churches Don't Preach that most churches just say get as rich as you can and make yourself and your family as rich and happy and comfortable as possible Jesus says the opposite live for other people fast don't don't get overweight fast right right you know uh don't be selfish Hoarding in all the money give to the poor save a little bit like John Wesley said give a little bit save as much as you can earn as much you can give as much as you can it's act it's actually the opposite of what a lot of people are preaching today be zealous of Good Works in other words I want to do something for Jesus praise God and what does the Bible say I can preach this with all authority look at this verse 15. These the I'm sorry these things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority let no man despise Thee I like how the Bible gives me that Authority praise God wish me zealous of good works but don't forget you're Redeemed by the blood you're redeemed he redeemed you to purify you and make you more like him Hallelujah am I over an hour already I think I'm over here okay I forgot to set my timer now George there's something with this there's a deeper thought there is a Heavenly presentation of Jesus presenting his bride to himself there is that because remember the Lord said unto Satan have you considered my servant job there's none like him in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feared God and skewed evil so it seems God currently presents us as forgiven and without sin in heaven right because God presents to Joe or God presents to Satan have you considered job he's perfect all right so God sees us as this finished product right in heaven but yet on Earth he corrects us all the time and Paul said for I'm jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have engaged you to one husband that I represent you as a Chase virgin to Christ so here's the future presentation when all the church age Messengers present the Bride of their age to Jesus and we're presented as forgiven and without sin remember now we are the sons of God Hallelujah it does not appear what we shall be some of these now here's the one I was speaking of earlier so now let's remember though for all of sin to come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God has set forth to be a propitiation that word means Mercy Seat Jesus is our Mercy Seat the blood was sprinkled on The Mercy Seat praise God Jesus blood was shed that covered that that paid for the the charge of of Wrath against us Jesus took our wrath praise God through his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission the sending away of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time his righteousness amen that he might be just and the justifier of him that believes on Christ amen I just want to point that out church at this time everybody say at this time at this time Jesus declares his righteousness for us amen at this time not not just 2 000 years ago at this time too Christ's righteousness is declared for you Hallelujah so in heaven God sees you as being righteous because you already accepted Christ Hallelujah at this time at this time Paul declares Jesus righteousness you are justified by the righteousness of Jesus Christ because you believe in him amen and you might not have as much belief as you want but how many still believe in him praise God I believe in Jesus Hallelujah My Sacrifice my My Savior My Lord praise God my Lord and my God like Thomas said amen I believe in Jesus Hallelujah I got more I want to do by God's grace but I believe in Jesus Christ my Lord so where is boasting then says he who's going to get to heaven and say well I made it out of laodicea there I still hear preachers saying that everybody's going to run up and say how'd you make it out later to see it well that would be us bragging all boasting is excluded by what law Works nay but by the law of faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law so Jesus saved us without our works without all the laws we kept and all the rules and all the legalism Jesus saved us despite that and he declared us righteous without works praise God now of course we know Works have to follow that's what James chapter 2 is all about right Works have to follow genuine Faith but the act of Salvation is is salvation by grace through faith praise God Jesus was delivered for our offenses and raised again for our justification therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah by whom also we have access by faith into this grace where and we stand brother Jesse Are you standing in legalism or Grace I'm standing in Grace I'm saved by grace see we've got to be careful not to stand in legalism or well I can do this and I'm I'm good I'm better than other denominational people no if anybody's saved we're all standing in Grace now we might have more favor with God because God rewards those who diligently seek him but that doesn't make us any better we're still standing in Grace praise God yes and we're zealous for good works yes but we're ultimately standing in Grace Hallelujah we're redeemed we were brought we were carried into Grace amen we were carried out of legalism praise God the market of legalism we were carried out of that and now we're standing in Grace Hallelujah hallelujah thank God for Grace amen hallelujah I have peace with God through Jesus Christ again God's not fighting against me God's actually fighting for me God's encouraging me to obey the word to make a whole day without sinning make a whole couple days without saying God's fighting for me praise God he's not fighting against me praise God if God can be if God is for us who can be against us isn't that the scripture if God is for us who's going to defeat us nobody can defeat us that doesn't mean we won't have struggles we'll have struggles but no one will take away our faith in Jesus Christ no one will be able to take that pearl of great price from us brother amen praise God Amen the pearl of great praise Hallelujah is the baptism of the Holy Ghost nobody can take that Pearl from you because it's sealed in there to the day of redemption praise God now I want to close to this y'all I am trying to close I think down to my last few slides here kind of like to give a visual one two three that's a whole lot back I can go pretty fast here we watch you watch you trust me I want to read a few more quotes this is a beautiful section of the the sermon and I know what brother man I'm saying and but I don't like what some preachers are saying about it because they're already saying you're the greatest in heaven you're the greatest Christians ever they were saying I was in the sermon no doubt I enjoyed the sermon most of it but they were saying that that we've got a harder battle than other people no we don't they were saying Satan's bound us harder now than in the days of Paul they were killing Christians in the days of all nobody's killing us in America yet right we don't know what's going to happen we've got to trust in God let the peace of God rule your hearts in other words don't let the spirit of fear come on you at late night right before you go to preach so I overcame it by God's grace but I'm still praying I came here to pray for our president I came here to pray for all the conservatives he the bridegroom took away your shame I like that and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which foreordained you has washed you by the washing of the Water by the church the congregation says no that don't sound right does it no you might find that in an almanac but that's not God's Bible you're washed By the Waters of the it's in the word now is that isn't that right now we don't have time here actually we do have time yes we do have time let's go to Romans 7. I don't want to leave this out this was this is uh brother Adam's text I believe for this sermon Romans 7 1. no ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath the husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she's loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she'd be married to another man she should be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she's free from that law so that she has no adulterers though she'd be married to other men now that's just marriage and divorce right there but now Paul shows the beauty of the spiritual part of this how many know that you were married before you became a Christian I'm not talking natural I'm talking spiritual let me know that you were spiritually married before you came to Christ you've been touched by another man like brother Braham says huh well that's a good thing to read our Bibles praise God verse 4. wherefore my brother and you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ now he's talking to Jews the Jews were married to the law they were under the previous Covenant that ye should be married to another even to him who's raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God now look at this keep going for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law now we he says that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of the spirit and not in the oldness of the letter what should we say then is the law of sin God forbid nay I not known sin but by the law for I had not known lust except the law had said Thou shalt not covet no church can we see that we were all married to something either the lust of the flesh or less of the eyes pride of life we are all married to that before we came to Christ but when Christ came our first husband died and when your died when he's died you're loose from his laws ah Glory loose you know it's a brand new life amen it's a fresh start praise God hallelujah it's a whole different world now because I have a different husband the old husband was sin the law of a sin but now I got a new husband it's Christ the word amen and now I'm going to bring forth fruit under Christ because I'm now married again my old husband though is dead now strange for me to say that but that's true my old husband is dead but Christ is my new husband praise God so see all these quotes about around music we've got to take them back to the Bible when we do we find this yes I was married to sin and the law but now I'm married to Christ and yes Jesus Through Micah did say he will cast all my sins into the depths of the sea and the Bible does say he forgives all my sins and the Bible does say blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man whom the Lord will not impute sin he has I mean Jesus has all these sins he could accuse me of but the Bible said he will not impute them to me same thing for Paul think about Paul all the murders all the all the blasphemy against Jesus Jesus will not impute that to him because of Amazing Grace praise God so what I want you to understand church I want you to understand how freely you're forgiven how much God loves you yes you're going to battle praise God but I want you to see what God does with your sin it's as though you never sinned in the first place as though praise God like that perhaps right as though and does this blessedness just come on the Jews only or the Gentiles and Paul answers this he says it's by grace to the promise might be sure to all seed and even this even those of the faith of Abraham who's the father of us all praise God your first wedding was a no think about that you were married to sin brother man says it was you never done it in the first place because there's only one thing could do it that would become from God God come down himself and took your place in the form of the Son of God Jesus Christ and wash you by the water the washing of Water by the word the word not the denomination the word washed you right I love who is testimony uh Bob remember being in denominations there was never a real Zeal or fire for God same thing for me right a denomination can't wash you the the dog was a man the Creed's a man cannot wash you the Holy Ghost washes you praise God that's what brother man was trying to say we got to get out of this shuck we got to get out of the out of these things and come to the pure seed the word of God hallelujah he said but he says the word not the denomination you the word wash you but if you won't say in the water the word how are you going to be washed then he sings there's a fountain filled with blood we might have seen that one we'll see what brother amen feels like to do man no pressure buddy I'm not trying to direct you what to do I'm just saying that's what he's saying beautiful song husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for do we see this do we see these ideas rather than preach in the scripture yes that he might sanctify and cleans it by the washing of the water word so taking a bath so you were dirty before you came to Christ but when you came to Christ he gave you a bath he said here's here's the bathroom here's the bathtub here's hot water here's soap here's a towel I'll see you when you get out right and we come out and now we're no longer dirty Church we're clean I mean what better I mean there's few better feelings in this world than a good good clean shower that's why those women will pay for all those gift certificates to go to get the massages and uh what does mommy do the Magnesium flow there it is there's we get our gift cards you know and or whatever it is you know the the sauna I know Austin likes Asana he taught me that all the time who don't like to come out feeling clean and fresh that's what Jesus did for us praise God we were dirty I was dirty I was filthy I was just as filthy as anybody praise God but one day Jesus said come into this bath I'm going to wash you praise God you're going to be washed and you're going to come and out clean praise God Amen Glory thank God Amen Hallelujah same word not by Your Righteous not by well it was my bath it was my no it was Jesus word it was Jesus water not by what we've done but according to his Mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration the renewing of the Holy Ghost which she he shed on us how much abundantly Church never worry that God's going to run out of Mercy for you the Bible said it's abundant he can't run out of it to praise God he can't change his mind about what he saw about you before the foundation of the world he can't change his mind God don't change amen praise God you're justified by grace we should be heirs and now he gives us an inheritance praise God he brought me out of the marketplace and then he gets me an inheritance amen that's Grace amen Hallelujah in other words I was an orphan he bought me with his own money with his own blood he washed me and then said here's your inheritance I'm giving you all this land this house oh I'm giving you all this well what more can you give me how could I not be thankful how could I not rejoice in all that Christ has done for me and all that Christ has done for you praise God all because you accepted his grace takes away the braggers doesn't it why you Terry that Paul said or they told Paul be baptized wash away your sins see the wash in the bath washed By the Waters of your word and from Jesus Christ who's the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us see because he loved you what he do he washed you from our own sins in his own blood Hallelujah it's his love to do that his love purchased me his love brought me to the bathtub praise God his love gave me the soap his love gave me the scrubber whatever the wash rag his love did that and now I have no spots on my garments now I'm clean and he made you and I Kings and Priests unto God his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen but that's not the amen of the sermon I'm almost done Hallelujah now notice you're not only that but you're going to the wedding in the sky and you're wearing the wedding band a predestinated unmerited Grace a wedding band of Grace unmerited of your own I didn't buy myself
