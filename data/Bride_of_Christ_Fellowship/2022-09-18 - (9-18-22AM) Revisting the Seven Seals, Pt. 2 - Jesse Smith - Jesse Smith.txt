========================================

seals i realized i didn't finish all of them i just got to the first four so i'd like to continue a little longer on those by god's grace revelation chapter 6 verse 9 10 and 11 revelation 6 9 10 11. of course we know the holy spirit loves this type of worship and loves this subject praise god because the holy spirit saved this subject to the seventh church age and brother iran said i've been in meetings where i've seen people healed and saw visions of healing even the dead rays but nothing compares to the holy spirit coming in his room fellowshipping with him and revealing the truth of the scripture praise god think about that we would rejoice in healings we'd shout if we we'd scream if we saw a dead person raised but the revelation the spirit was even greater than that because god is giving us a thus saith the lord so thank god for his mercy in his grace revelation 6 verse 9 10 and 11. we read this a couple weeks ago it's like to pick up here by god's grace why don't we all just read verse nine if we can we'll all read verse nine and then i'll read ten and eleven myself here let's read verse nine one two three and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held i'll read verse 10 and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren should be killed as they were should be fulfilled this gives us this also insight into how souls in heaven can desire for things to happen in scripture to be fulfilled on the earth they're aware they're in heaven they're aware that their uh the revenge hasn't been taken upon those that killed them they're aware so those in heaven can be aware of certain things upon the earth may god has blessings to bring his word you may be seated here praise god of course we're not sure how much they're uh aware of but they were aware that their blood had not been avenged by god so let's pick up here we'll uh i have just a few uh scripture a few slides i'd like to show here by god's grace we'll see how the holy spirit is directing here today just awesome real quick what time you got to go 12. oh we work at three well glory thank you i want to make sure if we had any special prayer time you could be here so you'll be here don't gotta worry about that okay praise the lord so uh i'd like to continue on this thought you know when i was talking to my wife this week and i realized when i preached this i think only bang was here i think when i preached on the seven seals my wife my family and vancouver was in 2010. we probably don't remember too much about 2010 other than god was gracious to us that year of course he's gracious every year but it's been a while i thought well here let me take a little i just think maybe one more service here we'll see it i'll try to show more about the revelation of the seven seals so i found this picture online i thought was pretty beautiful you know the their souls under the altar this is of course the altar of incense in heaven it seems the altar of incense would be in the seventh dimension uh because it's near the throne of god so i don't know if if this is the seventh above or this is the sixth below you know i'm not quite sure that's a whole other topic brother william i'm sure we could discuss he's that's the reason i say him because he's heard all the sermons down through the years brother bran you know different preachers and trying their best to understand the seventh seven dimensions right and where each one goes you know we know sinners go to the fifth dimension but the band tells us the fifth dimension is in the heart of the earth and brotherhood says that believers after they die go to the sixth dimension which that seems to be true but one thing for sure we know there's 24 elders in the seventh dimension because they sit around the throne of jesus christ the throne of christ would be the seventh dimension and so we know that some souls are privileged to sit in the seventh dimension we believe 12 of those were old testament souls right the 12 leaders of the tribes of israel 12 sons of jacob and then 12 of them would be the 12 apostles of christ jesus course someone taking probably matthias or paul taking judas is scared's place but so there's a great mystery even in this picture well is this the end of the sixth dimension and now to get up to the seventh i don't know all i can say is i just want to be there praise god lord help me to do everything i can do to be there by god's grace hallelujah and again this is a minor right this is a minor and that's why i don't spend a lot of time on you know things like that i'll take we take questions about it we want to i don't choose to preach full sermons on that because it's such a minor i want to major on getting people saved and filled with the holy ghost praise god and then while after you're saved and filled with the holy ghost i want to strengthen you praise god you can be a mighty man or woman almighty in the faith praise god hallelujah so we just try to major on what's a major and then you know minor on what's a minor by the grace of god and even brother braham said divine healing's a minor now that's shocking to me sometimes when i hear that but that's the reality of it you know but you know he had so many healing services so there's a time for a minor there's definitely time for minors and minors are important when you're sick how many would say men to that when you're sick you want the minor to be a major don't you that's how i feel if i'm sick i want god to heal me in a major way so um you know it's just a great balance in other words we're looking at the time and season when god is going to move praise god we need god to move in the time and season of our lives so the scripture plainly says we read that these were slain for the word of god now if you go to revelation 1 verse 2 brother man brings out this beautiful revelation and this could have been i don't know if this was from larkin or the holy spirit listed brother branham or from another of the historians we'll get into a little bit of that today uh it seems like brother ram got most of his uh uh thoughts that were not revelations he got most of his just teaching thoughts from larkin uh uriah smith and charles tays russell and so i'll show you pictures of them you know they at the end of the 1800s early 1900s and god gave some of them some revelation they had some revelation but it wasn't time for them to receive the full revelation the mystery of god finishing would come just a few short might would just come 60 or 80 years after them it was so close i mean they were so close to that season no wonder they were probing right no wonder they were probing into the seven seals they were probing into the seven church ages no wonder because that season was right on them praise god the same thing happened in jesus day before the messiah come there was numerous men gamaya said that rose up and said follow me i'm the messiah and went out to the wilderness and to see people you know because it was time satan sends that time it was time for the messiah so he raised up people to try to get people uh off the beaten path and distract them from the real reality of the messiah and that's how it was in this day as well you know with uriah smith and charles uh charles hayes russell and clarence larkin now larkin seems to be the one who lived the best life as far as a cleanest life but they were they sensed that god was doing something god was finishing up the seven churches they sensed god was gonna finish the mystery of god unbelievable and that you know think of it now even uh charles says russell's book was called the finished mystery well where did he get that phrase from that's from revelation 10 7. he even wrote a book about the entire book of revelation uh because he felt there's a pull i feel the pull the mystery some i feel like these scriptures have been laying here for two thousand years but i feel the spirit of god like god wants to reveal it praise god oh my hallelujah man he was so close just 80 years away for when god was actually going to pour out these revelations praise god but in revelation 1 verse 2 he said john he who bear record of the word of god and of the testimony of jesus christ and of all things that he saw so john has both testimonies he has a testimony for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ hallelujah and so we see that these are two different testimonies the word of god of course would be the old testament we call it uh the torah or the the law of moses the first five books of the bible but of course then there was many books added the prophets and the law and poetry after that of course but it makes up the old testament that's the testimony of the word of god but after john the baptist jesus christ came amen and he the bible said that all the law and the prophets were until john amen hallelujah and then jesus christ was here hallelujah and since then the bible said the kingdom of god is here hallelujah and the kingdom of god is in you hallelujah by the anointing of the holy spirit and now we have the testimony of jesus christ praise god you know yesterday i met a young man and he was a look like a spanish he looked like 100 percent spanish i looked 50 right uh but he looked 100 and he asked hey what is that john three fit what is that john 3 16 on your hat and i was just i was just you know going throughout the day and uh i was kind of shocked i had to kind of get my words you know because i wasn't ready to witness but i like how god helps me to witness that's why i wear that hat and i had i said oh that's right uh john john 3 16 for god so loved the world and i quote in the scripture and i said have you ever read your bible do you have a bible no you had no bible and he i said well you should get a bible i said i've written two books about god i said would you like my card and so you know eventually he took my card there and uh and i said god heal my mom a cancer i gave her that whole testimony you know what i said jesus christ is alive i just kind of bowed his head and said okay you know and he walked away i thought maya was just a shock to me like we have the testimony of jesus christ amen amen and i gave my card hopefully he'll text me he hasn't yet you know so i don't know you know how it is but i thought wow it was so sad he's probably 20 and he's never even read john 3 16. fine god help us to be lights amen god help us to we ought to be thankful that we've heard john 3 16. thank god for that old rugged cross hallelujah i opened that door i i walked out there to do the finances and somebody opened the door i thought everybody was screaming and shouting old rugged cross hallelujah amen that sounded good in here i like that kind of worship hallelujah hallelujah glory we have the testimony of jesus christ and we share his testimony praise god but these on the altar have no testimony of jesus they're under the altar they're not even on the same level as the altar and they're not above the altar so there must be some in heaven there must be some type of ascension of levels you know you must you can be below it but there must be some type of a uh incline or something into the higher in the presence of god there must be something like that because they're under the altar uh they're not in a higher dimension like the 24 elders isn't that what isn't that what the holy spirit told john come up higher hallelujah he opened he said open there's a door open in heaven and the voice said come up hither amen hallelujah amen thank god hallelujah and then brother brown brought this out to us that they're crying out for revenge on their for their blood and in acts 7 verse 60 stephen's being stoned now look look at this interesting look at it interesting how the holy spirit anointed him to say you stiff-necked and uncircumcised the heart look at that it just struck me right now i haven't even thought about that he rebukes him and name calls him you're stiff-necked but then when he dies he says god don't lay it to their charge for being stiff-necked now look at that look at that how you can be so direct to the holy spirit and name call somebody which they deserve it's not a negative thing it's not like a personal thing it's just a spiritual thing you're stiff neck and then in a few moments later say father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing right that's what jesus prayed on the cross is that is that just isn't that striking that one moment the holy spirit can be so uh direct and so strict and the next moment cry out for mercy and the church said yeah procedure sometimes when we're critical against the nomination or sometimes when i preach or a preacher or you will be so critical against someone but in the next breath we can say god be merciful to them i thought wow i've never seen that before until right now just how the holy spirit is what is it it's a warning of the holy spirit don't be stiff-necked don't harden your heart that's what the bible says in hebrews chapter 3 don't harden your heart like in the days of the provocation don't harden your heart like israel when you see those giants don't harden your heart and say we can't possess god's promise have a tender heart toward god know that god calls you to overcome giants amen say it like that amen god called you to take the promises of god hallelujah god called us to overcome these giants and these obstacles in our life you are called to overcome because god sent you god's with you god is for you how they do god cannot fail hallelujah if god sent you to do anything then he's going to equip you to overcome hallelujah amen one moment that we can be so critical and the holy spirit says yes you will get revenge jesus tells them they will get revenge and again notice that i know it's something we taught in passing but when a holy ghost-filled person i'm sorry when a person who doesn't have the holy ghost goes to heaven six dimension or to the heart of the earth they still have their human understandings they have not been perfected they have not entered into that theophany or that perfect that perfect theophy they haven't entered into that so they still have their own thoughts lord revenge me or like like the rich man in hell oh send if my if my brothers just saw five people raised from the dead they would believe or if my brothers just saw one person raised from the dead that's what it was they would believe but that's a human thought the word of god alone i believe it was david who said the law of god is perfect converting the soul amen hallelujah you can take the ten commandments and convert the soul praise god amen because you can start listening off take the name of the lord god in vain worship him only right honor your mother mother and father i should not lie they shall not murder commit adultery bear false witness you can take all these things and it will so convict the person that they can repent and receive eternal life right there praise god the law is perfect converting the soul praise god church let us let us have humble hearts and and say lord help me not to need anything other than what you you've already given to receive your word for my life praise god in other words help me not to rest upon a sign or help me not to wrestle upon a wonder or something like that help me just to trust your word and believe it praise god i'm talking about like a sinner you know but we get tempted too like i got to have a sign or i've got to have a miracle or i've got to have this or that i've got to have this or that really when it all comes down to it jesus said you've got the word believe the word of god hallelujah amen so they're crying out for revenge these jews and uh the bible said they're given white robes now in the church age book brother man says they're giving them at the white throne judgment so it doesn't say that in the text but that's what brother branham alludes to because that's when the people who were not born again remember the dead the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished and then they're given white robes so it seems they're given white robes later after the millennium and after the white throne or at the right throne judgment they're given the white robes but church we have robes now jesus says when you get the holy ghost you're endued with power from on high that means clothed with power praise god and then hebrews 13 14 says put ye on the lord jesus christ and give not provision to the flesh amen amen in other words you can put on his anointing like a garment praise god and then jude 1 23 says hating even the garment spotted by the flesh praise god he's not talking about natural clothes he's he's not telling them well you should wash your clothes more you come to church with stains on your clothes that's not what he's talking about now if you do try to wash it you know just if you can but he's talking about spiritual things in other words don't get your life contaminated by sinful things amen hallelujah praise god so we can see these revelations that god gave to brother branham now there's more he said the voice said rest yet for a season now if you if you read revelation 12 the bible said the jews are out in the wilderness and they hid from the from the dragon for a time times and half a time that's three and a half years a time is a year in that in that particular context so there's a little season in a little three and a half year season that they have to rest this is after the rapture now the fist seals after the rapture because there's no more horse riders there's no more beasts right like we said last week we got the flying anointing flying eagle anointing praise god we watch and pray amen we're watching and praying for that glad millennial day praise god but the jews when they're crying out after the rapture the lord says you have to wait a little season so there's some more jews that have to die after the rapture now does that fit with everything we've been taught that the foolish virgin have to give their lives or take the mark of the beast some of the faithful jews will have to give their lives or they'll take the mark of the beast it lines up perfectly with what the bible says in hebrews 13. i'm sorry in revelation 13 because it talks about the mark of the beast in revelation 13. and he said your fellow servants and their brethren should be killed as they were and now these were all the blinded jews the thing about this this is all the blinded jews that couldn't see jesus as messiah that were martyred for their faith from jesus's time to the present think about that 2000 years almost a martyred jews and this includes over the 6 million holocaust victims and then the jews yet to die in the tribulation period my this is quite a multitude of people here this is quite a group and they're all crying out to god avenge our blood avenge our blood and god said it will come you'll be given white robes i hear your prayers but you've got to wait praise god oh isn't that something like sometimes we cry out to god and god said you must wait first we don't like doing it but god tells us sometimes we must wait praise god we don't get everything we want right away sometimes we've got to wait and sometimes there's other people that must give their lives there's other people that must give a testimony of jesus christ until all things be fulfilled now the sixth seal is very uh uh very simple uh in fact clarence larkin this is the only seal that brother branham agreed with clarence larkin on so what's one divided by seven i don't think i have my phone up here but you could do the you could do the math there real quick anybody got it who's this who's the smart guy 14 so so think about that brother branham got 100 of the seals right and larkin just by guessing got 14 percent right and that's something he got 14 right because it wasn't his age it wasn't his time for the revelation of the seven seals and so when you probe see when we probe we're going to get a little bit of things right but not everything right that's why we should wait upon the lord for everything hallelujah god help us to wait now the symbols are the great earthquake now the worst earthquake in revelation actually i forgot to look that one up yeah so i actually forgot to update this slide yeah i'm sorry i forgot to update this slide uh it speaks when the sixth seal hits there's a great uh earthquake and brother adam says it's the two prophets that bring out the sixth seal they start the sixth seal because it's called the tribulation seal now as we've looked at i believe the first three and a half years uh are just the plagues that moses and elijah or two men with moses and elijah's spirit will bring forth upon the earth but i believe the trumpets and the viles and the woes are for later in the second half of the three so the second half of the seven weeks okay and that's because the bible says in revelation 7 that there the no tree can be hurt no grass can be heard nothing can be hurt until the 144 000 are sealed with the holy spirit amen that's what the bible says it's impossible so the great earthquake i believe this could be the los angeles earthquake this could be another earthquake there's a great one spoken of in revelation uh the bible says there's never been an earthquake like that nor since the time let me look it up here real quick anybody got it anybody been reading the revelation lately that's okay i don't have it either so it would be uh revelation 16. yeah okay revelation 16 18. there it is okay and this is speaking of the vials okay vials seven vows okay 16 18. got seven vows so vows are after the trumpets uh 1618 and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty earthquake and so great okay and then the great city that's got to be jerusalem was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell cities of the nations fell so cities are going to fall because this earthquake is going to be the greatest earthquake there ever was so i believe that's what it's speaking of that great earthquake and the sixth seal could be los angeles and then the bible said every mountain island were moved uh and there's a vile about that as well the bible said the islands fled away or fled away it's revelation 16 20. yes the two verses after that and every island and fled away and the mountains were not found so we see how the the sixth seal has to apply to all of that all of the destruction during the seven year great tribulation period here's the thought i had just briefly i'm starting to believe that the spirit of moses and elijah will just be a spirit on two men who are not moses and elijah and the reason i think that is because then moses would have to die twice and the bible says it's given for men once to die so that just scripture just came to me i'm just passing along just some food for thought okay i just thought i never thought about that before he's gotta die twice uh well maybe because the word was crucified twice maybe that would work too right it was crucified naturally and spiritually that's what the bible says in hebrews chapter six they crucify afresh the lord jesus christ spiritually so it could be it could be but it seems like it's just uh for men to die once okay so i'm just not gonna throw that little nugget out there we'll see if the lord ever you know if he terry's ever opens anything up about that but the bible said every free man hid the great men the mighty men or the common man because the great day of wrath has come and brother man tells us armageddon is the beginning of the lord's day he said this is the day of men now men exalt themselves now women exalt themselves now but when jesus comes back there will be no more exalting men or women praise god amen men and women will not control the events in the news oh thank god they won't control this governments and news but jesus christ will restore everything amen he'll control everything it'll be a new government a holy government praise god amen it'll be the lord's day praise god amen of course we know that day can represent a thousand years as one day with man is one day with the lord is a thousand years with man so it could represent that millennium coming in after the great battle of armageddon praise god i can represent that as well now the seventh seal i've always loved this picture since i've seen it a few years ago in the rapture you have all these people meeting in the air really they they kind of form up the one bride of jesus christ so it's like it's one group that represents i'm sorry it's a major huge group that represents one church one bride one wife praise god many members one wife hallelujah so i get jesus you get jesus too praise god we all get jesus hallelujah amen and of course this is revelation chapter eight no longer chapter six they're silent in heaven for half an hour i don't understand the half an hour apart but the only way it could be silence was if the four beasts uh would stop crying holy holy holy because the bible said they rest not day or night but they cry holy holy holy the lord god almighty so jesus's body would have to leave the seventh dimension and the four beasts would stop crying holy holy holy because he wouldn't be there and then jesus would come down to meet his bride in the air now i have to work that out if you had a thousand years was a day right so a thousand years is a day how much would half an hour of a day represent in years that's something i have to work out there i've done that before just kind of presuming all right so you know you'd have to kind of work that out by math i'm kind of unfamiliar with that math right now but if you look now if you look at the next there's that's the only symbol you're given but if you look at the next four verses after the seventh seal angels start preparing trumpets right right after the seven seals open and then the bible said all the prayers of the saints will be poured out so i believe all the uh all the bible evidence points to the seventh seal is the rapture of the bride of jesus christ and then as soon as soon as the rapture takes place then the angels start getting ready for the trumpets and the vials because it's a short time and then all the wrath of god is going to be poured out so i believe the context fits perfectly okay and of course there's lots of quotes like this i preached this a number of months ago but brother man said the seventh seal hasn't opened yet you know that's his coming and i'm just going to skip here's another one broken cisterns that last trumpet like the last seal will be the coming of the lord it shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise first the speaking of course of first thessalonians chapter four i'm not going to spend a lot of time because i preached these recently feast the trumpets to the seventh seal was the silence no one knew that was the minute or hour that christ was come as he revealed it to us the minute and hour glory amen the seventh seal is the moment of the rapture praise god it's the moment of the body change hallelujah okay that's the one i already showed you then he says it again the seventh seal the mystery of going it's the going it's when the bride is drawn up she's taken up the seventh seal is the rapture you'd be surprised how many preachers don't believe the seven seals the rapture you'd be surprised a lot of people believe it's already happened that's what that's what people are influencing today like it happened in 1963 well it just it doesn't make any sense praise god our lives are so wonderful sometimes there's no way this could be the tribulation period right there's no way but that's what some people believe because they're just trying to make all these quotes fit okay because remember each seal has three forms you have the symbol form and that was the silence in heaven that's the only real symbol given it's not really a symbol you have the reality form of the seven seal that's what we're waiting for that's the part of the seventh seal that hasn't opened up yet when is the day and the hour but the father keeps that to himself amen because he wants to find a bride who loves him so much he's waiting for they're waiting for his son to marry his son they're ready at any time hallelujah that's the kind of wife he wants for a son amen a lady who's just she's waiting and ready any time you come it's fine with me lord i'll be ready i'll be watching amen i'll be watching and praying with that evil anointing amen now the revelation of the seven seal's already been given it's the rapture it's already been revealed to us as brother adam said in march 24th it's the day and hour of the coming okay that's the revelation because jesus said but of that day and hour knoweth no man no not the angels of heaven but my father only souls that are imprisoned now the seventh is always the mystery watch that seven that's the finish that was the coming of the lord heaven was quiet silent nobody moved because jesus said not even an angel of heaven knows when i return i don't even know myself what time the father has put that in his own mind god alone knows that the spirit said i didn't know it then it wasn't revealed he said it wasn't give away what would take place hallelujah souls in our prison again remember he hid the seventh seal from us he wouldn't do it when the angel stood day by day telling telling it but then he wouldn't do it he said there were silence in heaven no one knew it it was the coming of the lord okay we just went through that why is there silence in heaven oh yeah here's the quote from 1960. this just gives me the best insight that i can find jesus comes from heaven with ten thousand times ten thousand of his saints and the bible says the heavens was empty for the space a half hour where is this big fellow god then uh see he's in christ sure hallelujah praise god christ is the mystery of god revealed god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it see he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence jesus when he was on the earth they wouldn't know when he would come he said it's not even the son himself don't even know what's gonna happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret that's the reason there was silence in heaven for the space half an hour and seven thunders under their voices and john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will become it's a good thing that he does it no can you imagine if all the catholics knew when he would come they'd be getting their prayer beads out right and thinking but see at that time they they'd be rejecting the revelation that god sent through his prophet they would try to get ready their own man-made way hallelujah praise god if they knew the coming they would try to get ready their own man made way they kiss the feet of the statues they look for blood to come out of the statues of mary they look at all these things they'd be get ready the wrong way but god keeps it a secret because he says those who have an ear to hear amen those who have the spiritual ear will hear what the spirit is saying praise god and the spirit will be telling them i'm coming soon i'm coming to get you i'm coming to catch you away it's a season of you're going away oh just like eliezer told rebecca it's the season of you're going away will you go away she knew it was soon and so it is with us god has sent us a prophet to tell us it's the soon going away you're going to meet isaac soon hallelujah glory hallelujah and the power of the camel has taken us there the power of the holy spirit is taking us to our isaac hallelujah oh it's beautiful now the coming lord is in mystery we don't know when he's coming how he's coming but we know he is coming and he said he never gave his mystery in full in other words he never told us the day of the hour okay so i'm going to skip past that now i want to read this one from the seventh seal now he says no angels no praises now speaking of the seventh seal no altar service no nothing there was silence hush deadly silence in heaven for half an hour all the hosts of heaven was silent for this half hour when the seven seal mystery in the book of redemption was broke open think of it but it's broke the lamb breaks it you know what they were all about i believe they didn't know there it was they just stopped why what is it now none of us know but i'm gonna tell you my revelation of it seven god's perfect number seven just right in a row seven thunders utters straight together like that they're spelling out something notice at that time john started to write and he said don't write it jesus never spoke about it john couldn't write it angels know nothing about it what is it it's the thing that jesus said even the angels of heaven didn't know nothing about it see he didn't know it himself he said only god would know it praise god you'd be surprised how many people can listen to sermon and not get the same conclusion we are and yet it's plainly stated right there only god would know it that's the day and the hour of the rapture that's the only thing that jesus didn't know as far as the scripture right that tells us in the scripture now of course he didn't know some people would be healed like the woman with the blood issue certain things the father didn't make known to jesus but he said but he told us when we begin to see these signs coming up now you're getting somewhere notice we notice we can see these signs coming up now brother is talking about all the signs in his ministry like the experience with the sword of the king right and the junior jackson's dream of the white rock and the pyramid maybe i have to go back over that again another all these things just point to brother random getting the revelation the seven seals and speaking the revelation with thus saith the lord i'm just doing a quick summary praise god he has all these signs he's to go out west and meet the seven angels and the whole and the seven angels send him back to open the seven seals right to preach the revelation of seven seals all those dreams all those signs were to let us know that jesus is getting his bride ready the mystery of god is being finished revelations are being unveiled and we're the ones we're the beneficiaries we're the ones who enjoy the finished mystery of god amen my there's the scripture again but of that day in that hour no man no not the angel who's in heaven neither the son but the father only the father knows that day and hour hallelujah now i just want to take a few minutes on this i've only been preaching for half an hour so i'm trying to preach an hour and a half today by god's grace so this week i've been studying on the seven seals and of course you know there was you may know because i told you the group that's left the message the most well-known one i don't like to call their names anymore cause i don't have nothing against them i just don't like to call their names so much anymore if they're watching i love you guys as always god bless you but they made videos in april uh that said brother man stole all the seven seals now that fired me up so i went and studied uh charles days russell and larkin and showed how brother ram did not plagiarize him i got a podcast on it i asked amen can i record that one alone he's like sure brother yeah cause i just wanted to get it out as soon as possible but uh it's clear god gave brother brown the revelation of the seven seals i just want to just go through these now here's the accusation on the first video they say uh brother graham did not have a special revelation they said he stole it from larkin and charles says russell now larkin was a baptist preacher charles tays russell eventually his followers became the jehovah's witnesses they're the ones that go door to door okay and they're say they'll say did you know jehovah god's name is not jesus we met one member brother we went a giant eagle up there in that place before cloven he's like do you remember he said he said do you know his name's not jesus i'm like okay i know this guy is so you know what remember i remember where i took him i took him to philippians chapter two the name above all names is jesus christ so i said you can call him jehovah but jehovah means jehovah is our salvation right i'm sorry jehovah's self-existent one joshua is jehovah's our salvation and that's what i shared with him and then he walked away because he don't want to hear he's just got his own denominational thought now they're the ones that don't take miracles either they won't my wife told the testimony of my mom being here with cancer and they walked away from our house that was kind of good in one way but i was another way i wish they'd receive it and they just said well i don't know if that was god or not can you imagine not believing god does miracles and they have to earn their salvation i was listening to a former jehovah's witness say if they're not constantly going door to door they're not assured of their salvation because they say then you don't have any works you have no real faith now think about that that's a works based salvation now they st how come they stopped going door to door now that covet hit see they're scared right they haven't come to our door anymore i don't see them walking around anymore like they used to uh but anyways that's charles says russell eventually his followers started uh jehovah's witnesses and brother man was accused of stealing it but we know he got it directly from god and i'm just gonna choose today just for time's sake i'm just gonna do the first seal just to show you and i got the pictures like i told you i've got my receipts emma i made sure i get my receipts right lydia i just like to i'd like to know what i'm talking about praise god and so these guys can make they make a four-minute video about the first seal i made like an hour long video about this the seals not being plagiarized now which which and they have like one sentence and i've got all these different quotes which one are you going to believe who did in other words who did more research we did more research in other words so it just it burns me up but that's okay deceivers must come the bible says those that bring offenses must come but we'll stand for the truth praise god so let me just give you a brother brahm said the timing when was the timing of the first seal he said it started in the first church age and that's an exact quote now there are quotes i don't know if william knows this there are quotes brother graham said the church ages started at jesus's resurrection so there are quotes that say the church the first church age started in 80 30. i don't know if you knew that uh but the church age book says it started in 53 a.d now to me it doesn't matter it's just 23 years difference i tend to believe it did start in 30 a.d because that's when they were the church they were filled with the holy ghost that's that's my thought but whatever reason in the church age book brother ramsey started in 53 a.d doesn't matter but anyways this uh the timing was this white horse rider rode from the first church age until he had power to kill with the sword then brother ramsey said he jumped off his white horse imagine he jumps off his white horse and he climbs up on a bloody red horse he throws his leg over and now he's a bloody red horse rider with a great sword so when i studied history at edward broad that's the name of that historian brother brandon actually read him too he said the first time the catholic church with united church and state killed a martyr was in 385 a.d see they got the power through constantine remember around 325 the nicean council they actually rejected the humanity of jesus they actually rejected that because arius was there and he was saying jesus body was a creative being and these catholics shut him out and said no he's the eternal son we preach that on wednesday night he's the eternal son he and eris is just he's standing up for the humanity of christ christ did have a human side he said i'm the beginning of the creation of god amen so aerys was standing up but these catholics with constantine they kicked him out and they said oh jesus we're just going to call him the eternal son well five years after that constantine moved the headquarters from his headquarters from rome to constantinople he made his own city named it after himself a real humble and he called himself the 13th apostle can you believe that he called himself the 13th apostle after you know peter or whatever and then he killed his son and his mother this man he saw the vision of the cross got a victory but then it shows he never really had a real conversion you should i'm going to preach on constantine pretty soon well whenever i get to that chapter seven oh it's such an example of judas is scared or like balaam you can have the anointing for specific things but if you don't continually feed on the word of god if you don't daily confess your sins that satan's going to take you farther than you want to go praise god you've got to daily confess these things i don't you might have some great beautiful testimonies but if you don't continue in the word then you'll fall from the word the bible jesus said you'll fall from your your own steadfastness right you'll fall from that so you must continue in the word of god you might had a good start but he had an awful end and so when he moved the capital of of italy from rome to continental he was separating the civil from the religious and then the focus and you know rome only lasted about 200 more years after that the pagan rome but then the focus came on the church of first church of rome which eventually became the catholic church and 300 years later the first pope came out of there boniface pope boniface was the first pope in 606 a.d okay so there's a lot of history in there i'm just kind of pouring it in there praise god but that's what brother brown did when the holy ghost was on him hallelujah preach those seven seal messages hallelujah so the first seal was about 30 a.d or 53 a.d which is about 385 a.d and who is that writer brotherham said he was the nickel lane spirit to begin with or the antichrist spirit in other words the spirit of death and then he become incarnate in a man and when he was crowned he received a throne and was crowned okay so at some point the bishop of rome uh became the of the he the bishop is the pastor the pastor of the first church of rome eventually got a crown during this time eventually got a crowd okay now here's clarence locker nice looking fellow there he's a guy that can draw he's a really good draw he's going to drew the future home that i love so much so what was his now that's what the video says brother adam plagiarized clarence larkin well let's look what did he say in other words this white horse rider is the antichrist did brother ram say that yeah but he said the spirit of the antichrist he said he is the prince who is to come of daniel's vision of 70 weeks who will confirm for one week the last or seventh week with daniel's people the jews daniel 9 27 did you catch that is the timing the same as brother branham's and larkins no it's a two thousand year difference his his antichrist white horse rider hasn't even rode yet according to his understanding praise god that's that's what happens when a man tries to guess he gets 14 right right the only one he got right larkin got right was the sixth seal he didn't get any other ones right 14 right on a man's guessing uh percentage on uh can you guess prophecy can you can you guess fulfilled prophecy man gets it right 14 percent of time now he's a good man as far as i know he's a good man so what's the conclusion brother branham's first seal started 2 000 years before larkins and brother man said the writer was a spirit let me say this a universal spirit a universal spirit in other words all the evil churches the antichrist spirits in those churches brother ram said that was the white horse rider in all the churches but larkin said it's just one man it's one man once the tribulation starts who be in other words the pope who becomes the antichrist so see brother brown had a greater understanding and that matches up with what john said john said even now there are many antichrists entered into the world praise god remember that many so brother man recognized it was a spirit that was upon many many false preachers that were anointed with the false antichrist spirit larkin said it's just one man and it hasn't even happened yet and those liars are getting on there i'm going to call them liars like the holy spirit can rebuke you but then give give you love right i just said like stephen it was liars to say brother man plagiarized from larkin he didn't play jurassic rock and i stand by my research because it was god leading me there just like god led brother graham to the books god led brother to certain parts of research larkin said the writer is a literal man uh of the antichrist during the great tribulation so is there plagiarism there no sir all right here's the one who uh charles says russell he started the uh his people founded that jehovah's witnesses so no miracles group door-to-door group uh the title of the book was the finished mystery so he believed he was revelation 10 7. is that something look 1917 eight years after brother branham uh was born elijah was getting ready to come on the scene and this guy caught the revelation the mystery of god's going to be finished he was getting caught up around that spirit of prophecy and he said i must be the elijah he called himself the elijah in church you know his pyramid i'm sorry his tomb is a pyramid just like brother adams do you know that you should look it up it's a pyramid he was so caught up in this oh the mysteries of god are going to be finished i got to preach daniel i got to preach revelation i am i am i'm the elijah messenger to fulfill revelation 10 7. he got so caught up in it that he even had himself uh he had the revelation the future holds the pyramid he had that see because it was the time for it church it was the time for it remember there was people in jesus day that were not with jesus casting out devils right and the disciples said you got to follow us you got to come to our church what happened they got under the same anointing it's a time for miracles glory it was a time for devils being cast out it was time for the dead to be raised and so the people can feel this is time prophecy is being fulfilled and they fell under it praise god ah god help us to feel what anointing what prophecy is being fulfilled right now praise god to take this gospel it's the revelation 10. amen eat this book and prophesy again hallelujah tell the nations tell the people praise god that's why internet's been a great help to us to spread the message praise god so when was his timing uh his timing was his own epoch which is the church age that of smyrna and who's his writer now look his writer is just one man it's the bishop of rome in other words the pastor of the first church of rome his bishop means bastard overseer the embryo pope so in other words the baby form of the pope so the pope was eventually going to be formed but it was going to happen in 606 a.d he became the universal pope but the bishop there who was there at the beginning of the bishop of rome the pastor he was the he was the white horse rider in the embryo or the baby form now look at this here this is unbelievable and this is the part that the accusers left out of their video he said the white horse look he said the white horse was the doctrine and teachings of the lord and the apostle can you imagine that a bishop of rome is writing and he's writing on the true teachings of the lord and the apostles that's not what brother branham said a little brother said a horse is a charger it's a power in other words the white horse was an evil spirit and here he says no the white horse was actually the right spirit see that's the part they leave out of the video and i'm like i just want i just want to write a comment this is some of the weakest research and with all broadly love this is the weakest research i've ever seen and they always pat themselves on the back we're the great researchers we do research we take everything back to the bible well you should have read on a few more sentences and i say that in love and here's the receipt here's the screenshot behold a white horse this is charles says russell jehovah's witness the doctrines teachings of the lord the apostles recognized as the one and only rule of faith and practice of god god's church the bishop of rome is writing jesus and peter's uh teachings no he wasn't he wasn't propagating the true facts they they uh the history says they instituted uh infant baptism there's no infant baptism in the bible history says they put the father son holy ghost in there that's not what the apostles taught that's not what jesus taught jesus told peter it's in my name praise god hallelujah and he that sat on him the bishop of rome the embryo pope the personal representative of satan okay and here's more uh russell said john's epic or church age was from smyrna age which lasted 73 to 325 so here's where he saw the voice of thunder and i saw john behold the vision of the first strange wonderful feature of the divine plan for the permission of evil as it relates to the epics of the church or church ages of the church beyond his own epic that of samurai so john saw the first white horse rider and it was going to be the the time period of the summer church age which he said was 73 to 325 a.d all right so i'm giving you the timing so i'm going to do these conclusion slides so you i know it's a lot of information but you can see it so let's look at the conclusion brother brandon's first seal started either 20 or 40 years before russell's and lasted 60 years longer that's the first difference is that plagiarism no plagiarism is copying and stealing somebody else's thought and presenting it as yours and failing to mention them and brotherhood said the writer was a spirit and then became a pope russell said it was just a man russell missed this whole thing about the many antichrists because he wasn't a bible-based prophet amen but a bible-based prophet has got to teach you the bible praise god and he left out john's words how there's many antichrists already entered into the world he left that out and he just singled it down it's one man but man said no it's one evil spirit impacting the eterna i'm sorry the entire universal church that's falling away of course not the true church they were rebuking that devil they were they were casting out that devil amen in jesus name hallelujah and church russell never even mentioned the nicolaitan spirit in that in that whole page those two pages you never mentioned the nicolaitane spirit and brother ram never used the words bishop of rome in the entire first seal look it up you get a chance he never even used it brotherhood did not even quote this right here the bishop of rome brother i never recorded that in the first seal bill abraham said the white horse was a deceiving spirit russell said it was the doctrine of the lord and the apostles that's you can't get any different from that right what's the opposite of good evil what's the opposite of holy evil brother man said the horse is evil russell said the horse is holy who's right the man who's got thus saith the lord hallelujah is it evil white horse praise god oh church aren't you glad the accusation is the main accusation is that brother man plagiarized him and i just showed you with just two little snippets of one page two little snippets brother ram did not plagiarize we are standing on truth they're attacking our god-given face hallelujah let me just share this and i showed you this before the reason they do this is because they don't love the doctrine that we love remember i showed you this months ago the people that leave the message there's at least 14 or 15 doctrines they deny the reason they're attacking us is not because they don't like brother braham so much it's because they don't love the spirit of truth they don't want to live a holy life see they want to allow people to be homosexuals they would allow them to remarry like one of the most famous pastors remarried his daughter two or three times fornication murder through birth control pills they allow women preachers substance abuse viewing sinful content like there's this one man he's the he's one of the leaders now against brother branham and you know what he says he likes watching all these dirty movies ocean's 11 you can name it murder movies all these things he said he hopes he can dress up like dracula for halloween this year and watch the movie dracula blood sucking demonic power uh that's what he said and he says he's free in christ he's not free in christ we're free in christ amen we've got the holy spirit we believe in holiness the bible said i was sent no wicked thing before my eyes praise god and he said he's gonna he's gonna let his children watch dracula the movie and then dress up like dracula he said put on the blood on because it's just having fun i just heard it this week on the on the podcast and these are the people that attacking us we're trying to live holy and they're trying to enjoy the things of the world and say they're right and promote themselves as some greater uh greater revelation and accuse brother bam uh hallelujah but jesus said by their fruits you shall know them ah i just gotta examine the fruit but we've got some fruits out there we've got some vegetables out there right how do you know how do you know you're gonna eat it well just flip it over look it over see the people that don't examine these people that leave the message if you don't examine it you're not going to see their evil fruits now you know they're wrong but when you start examining their fruits you say oh that's rotten oh there's a rotten spot oh there's some there's some worms in there church that's what we see there's some worms in their doctrine now they let women preachers come in now they watch wickedness now they believe there's only one work of grace now that their women dress sexy but we will stand on paul's gospel amen that's what all those millions were shouting brother william those millions were shouting we're resting on the fact brother branham preached paul's gospel amen that's what i'm resting on hallelujah thank you jesus they believe god's three persons now like we saw on wednesday he wasn't lonely because he could always talk to the dove and then he could talk to his father jesus was never lonely because if want to talk you dove can you cool on my shoulder can you give me some fellowship father can you give me a hug i just need some fellowship you see this is ridiculous that's what they believe amen and then cross-dressing which they wouldn't answer that on my debate well they said it's always wrong but they wouldn't condemn crossdressing on the debate because they said oh everything's just wrong and they didn't some of them deny like the jehovah's witnesses the gifts of the holy ghost they want the holy ghost come in there now that's just 15 right there 14 now this one's not in crossdressing is not in the new testament but we know by revelation abominations carry over to the new testament we know that by revelation we can see it i've got a whole video on that if you want to know about that so see what are they're getting under the jezebel spirit all right we're all the same we're all we're all christians there's and they're they're they're they're sure there's no such thing as wise and foolish virgin well then why did jesus put in the bible then why did paul why did john say the rest of the dead live not to the thousand years we're finished why the bible say that why did paul say i will do anything that by any means i might attain to the first resurrection praise god in other words there's something a human glory has to sacrifice if he wants or she wants to be a part of the first resurrection praise god you've got to sacrifice all your thinking all your sinful desires all your your sinful paths all that must be sacrificed and by any means you must press on toward the mark of the high calling and god will give you a place in the rapture and the first resurrection amen you've got to love god with all your heart soul mind and strength and this is what we're standing on the unchanging body word of the son of man in other words we're standing on the thus saith the lord of jesus christ hallelujah amen hallelujah when i heard that about dracula i jumped out of my seat i'm like i like to tell these guys something did they ever watch the dragon i mean i was a sinner i watched dracula movies wickedness i would watch some of those horror movies by the way and i'd be scared for the next month i'd be peeking out of the showers like anybody out there to kill me with a knife right every time i was in the uh at night park in the car be like looking out anybody in the back of my seat they might jump in my car they're going to kill me while i'm in the back of my car like a spirit of fear fear that's not fun that's called fear as soon as you let the first one in then you go to a more wicked one and then that that that type isn't enough for it just like pornography right one little picture and then a video and then movie it just goes and same with this one this doesn't scare me anymore now i got to go further and further and pretty soon they dress up like freddy krueger or whatever you see little kids dressing up like chucky that dow i hope you don't know that one but i did he used to watch those awful things but see they fall under all these evil spirits see they're getting full of all these unclean spirits but you and i are called to be filled with the holy spirit glory and not let all these demons lust unclean spirits cross-dressing lying spirits deceiving spirits pride spirits right we see that the message pride lust all these things they fall under these seducing spirits but you and i are kept free from that jesus says if you keep the word of my patience i will keep you from the hour temptation that will come upon the whole earth praise god keep the commandments of the lord how many will do it by god's grace is it already okay we had a long song service right so that's why the time changer okay let me try to finish up here my contest everybody enjoying the word of god today and somebody asked me on the they were a young christian they said i'm a young christian but can you explain to me i don't think we're supposed to defend the gospel i said well go to philippians chapter one brother twice paul says i am set in other words god ordained me to defend the gospel and the word defend means to give a verbal argument that's what it means give a reason with your words for the it means an answer give an answer for the hope of calling of jesus christ in your life we're supposed to have answers for these lying devils we're supposed to have answers that's how you defend the gospel that's how you tell the devil you know it is real oh yeah he does he is the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah there is a spirit of truth amen you can find truth god can show you revelations god's here to teach us more god wants to take us deeper in the things of god god is real amen so it wasn't the white horse wasn't the doctrine of christ and the apostles wasn't it was an evil power it was a demonic power so the this is the this is the first seal and they're already saying brother man plagiarize him anybody with any ability to read i'd say a fifth grade education could read these pages and see brother brown did not plagiarize that see the radical church here's what i believe too these people when before they left they never even studied and prayed about the message like they should have and this is the danger like i told you about a few weeks ago going to church on sunday and wednesday is not enough for anybody you have to seek god every day of your life these guys that one guy went to church brother for 40 years and that one preacher preached for 33 years before he left the message at some point they stopped confessing their sins they stopped seeking god for truth they started being swayed by other people that one pastor that was there for 33 years he even admitted i started preaching about just what people were saying around the internet instead of feeding the sheep and then he eventually that was jeff jenkins and then he eventually called brother brandon a liar he calls him a liar now he got away from feeding the people the word of god he got away from feeding them and just want to try to solve all these problems now church we're unique we have the internet right so we can by god's grace i can defend that and then i can also feed you at the same time i believe that hallelujah that's what i believe because i've done it all these years praise god i've done it and if you're not fed let's come come talk to me about it and show me i'll try to point you where i preach here i try to preach there by god's grace to do the best i can amen i got to defend it but i also got to teach and feed the flock the people of god and i like this this series was from by the men's request right so see the people need to feed on some of these revelations so we're bringing them out to teach the people hallelujah praise god so did he did he the brother man plagiarized him not even close it's this now this just you know this is the second closest of all the seals the closest was the larkin where larkin brother brother ram and larkin agreed completely on the sixth seal this is probably the second closest but it's still such a big difference the timing's not the same the horses are not the same and the writer is not the same also this brother branham's first seal showed the early church was anointed by the lion anointing and said it was thus saith the lord brother ram said the lion anointing empowered the early saints to save the world how did you understand that church in other words their anointing saved the believers for that day that means our anointing is going to save the world for this day hallelujah don't leave yourself out of there put yourself in the seals we're in the fourth seal the anointing on you will save the world praise god it'll save those souls that are elected to salvation it'll save austin it'll save elena praise god it'll save a jesse smith amen they'll say but kristen smith he'll save a bang yang amen put your name in there it'll save you praise god amen this anointing of the holy spirit saves you it's a prophetic anointing you can understand for prophetic revelations because you're an eagle praise god hallelujah jesus said where the carcass is let the eagles be gathered there amen he said this is an enzyme revelation eagle's feast on the rape revealed word of god the fresh word of god this is fresh revelation it's been hidden for 2000 years but it's been freshly revealed to us in our day hallelujah there's my hour okay i'm almost done now look what look what look what uh russell said yeah yeah brother ram said the anointing saved the world russell said god forsook his church he said when russell said the line anointing was infinite justice and he said god forsook his church or the lying beast was defeated by the ecclesiastical system look at that see what was he doing brother he was exalting himself as look i'm i've got the greatest anointing i'm finishing the mystery of god charles russell was exalting himself greater than all those early apostles because he said they failed and he actually said god failed i'll show you the quote god forsook his church jesus said jesus said god forsook me so you don't have to be forsaken amen hebrews 13 verse 5 said god cannot leave us nor forsake us hallelujah but yet this guy says god forsook the early church impossible see that's why don't these people these accusers don't they keep reading are they just trying to find one little thing against brother brahm to make him look bad that's what they're doing here it is thus we he said he went forth conquering in the conqueror that's the first seal thus we see the apparent defeat of infinite justice in this first epic apparently god forsook his church having jeopardized all its interest by placing the power in the hands of the self-seeking ecclesiastical system but worse things are coming look at that brother can you believe that what man in his right mind what man led of the holy spirit would say god's word failed what man led by the holy spirit would say god forsook his church god can never forsake his church amen god can never forsake you god can never forget about you the bible said god can't even forget about israel because he's engraved in the palms of his hands amen the bible said jesus was crucified for the joy that was set before him and what joy was that the joy of your love amen the joy of your worship praise god he shall see his seed isaiah 53 says you are the seed of god the bible says you're born again of the incorruptible seed the word of god oh my hallelujah thank god hallelujah and they call me a heretic and they say i'm not a good researcher we're not we don't know how to research well here's the research either me or i'm asking you guys can you go on that that video of theirs and leave a comment say this is you need to look at brother jesse's research on this so anyway if any of you want to help me out today you can do that i'll bring some real trials on me too so okay here's uh uriah smith i like that name smith that's pretty good news now his book was called daniel and the revelations that's like a acronym daniel in the revelation his was before both of them before larkin and uh russell now this guy would eventually become the leader of the seventh day in venice they believe he got a worship on saturday they have some things that are right but they have some false prophets like ellen white and some different other false prophets they actually follow a woman prophet like her teachings they really major on ellen white's prophecies okay so when did he say did brother man plagiarized from uriah smith brother admits on tape he read uriah smith but he said when the holy spirit came in it was totally different hallelujah so he said the god the timing of the first church age or the first seal was the gospel in the first century he said the identity of the writer was the earliest ministers of the gospel look at that in other words the white horse rider was the ministers and the holy spirit riding conquering the world for christ that's totally opposite of what brother ram said totally opposite and they say brother man plagiarize him it's polar opposites and there's uh so here what's the difference brother branham's first seal started the same as uriah's but brother rams lasted much longer he said it was only for the first century so 30 a.d to 100 a.d brother rams laughter lasted around 385 around 385 when the church and state had power to kill and brother said the writer was a spirit and then became a pope larkin said the writer is a literal person or man of the antichrist during the great tribulation period here's the quote this is right from his book you can get it online you can download it online let me skip ahead here yeah he said he goes forth concreting the conqueror is a fit emblem of the triumphs of the gospel in the first century of this dispensation he said oh the white horse rider is the gospel conquering and brother branham said it's actually satan conquered totally opposite completely opposite so plagiarize no yeah he said it was the zeal and the success with which the truth was promulgated by its earliest minister so the white the writer actually represents all the ministers of the first century program said no it was the antichrist spirit the nicolaitan spirit all right now let me uh try to close here by god's grace now church there's been numerous people you know uh in the message you can you could know the symbols you can know all these symbols of the seven seals but miss a relate a relationship with jesus christ but don't forget this jesus christ gave us these symbols to know and the church said jesus christ gave brother ram these symbols and told the revelation so that what we could withstand the antichrist spirit that's why we're given these revelations so we can know them through personal revelation and the experience of meeting jesus because the bible said the mystery of god must be finished someone has to come sometime that's why i told sam at my house i said brother i said the bible says the mystery god's got to be finished i held up my book i said there's 12 that are finished six of them have thus saith the lord to see you can tell somebody right to their face and either they're hungry for or not see the seed will fall on one type of four grounds what was the difference were you what was the difference for you you were hungry for the word of god it fell on good ground amen hallelujah it fell on good ground you started watering that ground you started watering that seed and pretty soon good for good fruits come forth hallelujah from that seed amen but don't forget this this is what we've seen the message here people can understand all these mysteries of the seven seals but if they don't have love they're nothing love for what the entire word of god the gospel of jesus christ let me skip ahead to this i got a lot of thoughts i never got to so i've just showed you he brother did not plagiarize russell larkin or uriah smith and look what he said he says this is the first seal he's getting ready to preach he said he's got it he said christ has a book in his hand he's starting to reveal it and oh i would have absolutely today i hope that people are spiritual i would have made him a horrible mistake on that if it hadn't been about 12 o'clock in the day and look at it it's 1205 right now glory when the holy spirit came in the room and corrected me on something i was writing down to say brother iran was going to miss the revelation of the first seal but the holy ghost that glory the holy ghost that met him out in arizona amen with seven angels sent them back and said you go back i'll be with you to open the seven seals to reveal them to my bride i'm finishing the mystery of god this is the time and season this is the place this is the saint the lord amen and to keep someone from a mistake and to keep his profit from a mistake the holy spirit came in and swept the room and showed him a vision and you can go through all we'll go through these maybe later but you can go through all yeah he says this later he says about 12 o'clock in the day the holy spirit swept through the room the whole thing just opened up of this first seal being opened now for the second seal he said the first thing you know something happens it's all together different then i grab me a pencil real quick and start writing down just as fast i can while he's there so brother man would be studying and the holy ghost would sweep in the room he would see a vision and then try to write down what he sees sound familiar sound like john the book of revelation because jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he did not plagiarize uriah he did not plagiarize larkin or russell can i say this he got it from god hallelujah he was sharing the revelation that jesus christ gave to him hallelujah in the third seal he said uh the holy spirit came to where i was and this other seal opened up just exactly i love this as soon as the brotherham saw it vision what'd he do he said i went quickly to the scripture it was revealed to me early in the morning before daylight then i went quickly to the scripture and began to look to search it up he said the fourth seal finally did come he said i took my bible he said so help me i never know before none of these things have ever known before i got up there and take the bible sit down there when it goes to breaking forth like that i stick i just pick up my pen and start writing and stay there maybe for hours until it gets finished so the holy spirit would come in and brother man would write down all the things in the vision about the white horse rider the red horse writer the black horse rider the pale horse writer he write it down while he's there and then he said i spend the rest of the day searching the bible to make sure the revelation is right because paul said even if we or an angel preached anything different than what we've already received let him be a curse amen it's the gospel of jesus christ let's stand to our feet hallelujah church i'm convinced now more than ever that jesus christ visited brother branham and brother brahm was god's prophet see all these lies and attacks they always bring out the truth brother brown said heresies i'm sorry paul said heresies must come in to approve the true ministers of god that's why these lies come in that's why heretics come in that's why false accusers come in because it shows who's the real believer and who is it musicians can come brother amen you got are you led for a song praise god i know i did a lot of teaching today but i did some preaching in there too by god's grace first we must have a experience we must have a personal experience with jesus christ some of these men that left they knew these revelations for years or maybe they didn't know it i don't know what something happened to them they thought they knew it can't say can i say like this they were listening to the tapes but they weren't hearing what the spirit said it's two different things
