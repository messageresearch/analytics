and Lord there's a permanent address for us in the New Jerusalem what greater requests could we have Lord God then to be sealed with thy Holy Spirit father for your courts above that we could be like David and said this one thing I desired to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life that I may see your beauty glory and enquire in your temple Lord God thank you Jesus sometimes it's just so overwhelming or good above all else we adore your name and above all else tune our hearts that will sing your praise in the good times and the bad times we thank you for this worship service Lord bless us now Lord as we get to your word I think I'll just pray over the word now Lord that you open it to our hearts as we look at time it seasons again Lord just minister these thoughts a new place upon my heart from your prophet but Lord if there's any direction you want to take me off just help me to be like a little lamb that could be led let me not be arrogant like a wolf but I'm gonna be more like a lamb could just be led by the Holy Spirit here tonight for orders not my outline that counts it's your outline that kind of stick speak to us here tonight we just worship you and we just prepare for your way in Jesus Christ Nate the church say Amen let's say into our feet here let's take our Bibles here tonight let's go back to please ask you chapter three like to look back at this time in seasons I'm almost done I think I'm at 130 150 looking at brother branham's quotes on times and seasons so it's been a blessing and looking forward the Word of God here tonight that's part 12 Lydia I don't know if and I tell you was it 12 is that the right one I told you okay thank you yeah I hate to I hate to put the wrong number on please ask you chapter 3 verse 1 praise God let's reverse one together and then we'll just have you be seated justjust first one on three one two three to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under heaven amen may God his blessings ringing his work may be seated by God's grace thank you we'd like to look at the Word of God here tonight and thankful for the Saints meaning the house of Lord praise God where else would you want to be tonight and God's presence okay just want to make sure I didn't miss anything all right so we look forward to the Word of God here and trying to think about any other announcements just May 31st we have the Hawkins coming I'm sorry March 31st I wrote May on here that's why I get keep messin Etta and the books available so sister Naomi you don't have to read it but if you want a copy I'm not gonna force you you don't brother Aaron said he's studying for a test next week so I'm a teacher I like to give tests so he's gonna study for a test next week nah but if you want one you're more welcome to have one and you can ask your dad if he wants to meet a male 1 I'll mail in one you know maybe look I said to put in some OMA glory well we could thank the Lord for that amen glory hallelujah well he can't wait on male 1 so we're thankful by God's grace for that trying to think it seemed like there was something else someone to share well I think that's it all right so let's look at this here tonight and seem like I'm forgetting some you could get inside switch over I got some some some quotes we like to read and look at tonight by the grace of the Lord so let's look at part 12 of the purpose series we look at time and seasons again and then we read our text but on it sums I did the cleese e Asti suffer out to change that it's like I said I'm at 137 and 150 I'm almost done but I think Lord willing tonight I'd like to get to the five musts that brother branham taught about the will of God and at the right time and season so I think we're try to get to that if we don't pass it we may pass it we'll see how the Holy Spirit directs us here tonight so brother man talked about how meetings like the chief church gatherings were in the right season so he said this meeting is not providentially it is God's provided way for us it's just in the right season the right time you never come here this afternoon just by chance it was God that brought you here everything is moving just right now whether you want to listen or whether you want to believe that'll be up to you see but at the judgment bar then God will say so if someone doesn't believe God will say the judgment bar you remember that sermon remember I guided you to the church that night uh-huh then what can you say so we want to apply that to tonight that God wants to speak to us tonight praise God so that the judgment bar God said aren't you glad you listened on that Wednesday night that's what I want to say praise God I thank the Lord that I was able to hear your word and you're able to speak and and quicken something to my heart tonight that I really needed amen so uh well they also said their seasons of Prayer now brother man was you know it was so was so simple he called he called a season of Prayer if you just stay if you and I just after service for a few minutes and pray that's what he called us season of Prayer just something so simple so you'll see it in the quote here he says this is 1960 now with our heads bowed your hearts open just give yourself a season of Prayer sometimes we think well I got to pray for three hours well it's not always that way but most of us probably don't do that I haven't done that for a long time he said just before I guess the baptismal service coming so so look at this he called the time from the end of a sermon to the time they have a baptismal service he called that a season of Prayer aren't you glad for that amen see there'll be another service tonight and I remember don't let this opportunity pass I've been here now for two and half hours or more trying to just take my time and bringing the gospel lay it just imperfectly then we come right down to the end so little season a prayer from the time the sermon ends to the time they baptize he says it again and the very text here recognized Acts II don't let it pass over your head you've heard it you recognize it as presence is here you know it's him that's calling you then act upon it god be with you have a season of Prayer amen I would like to do that sometimes I just like to have my doctor or before service but you can have it after service it doesn't matter wherever God's leading you into a season a prayer just enjoy that 15 or 20 minutes or however long you feel lead we should be open to that brother band had to encourage them have a season of Prayer just take a little time and just talk to God talk it over right we know just a little talk with Jesus makes it right we know all the jokes that you know God you God God will never be busy when you call it heaven you'll never get the busy signal never have to leave a voicemail alright we know those jokes and the technology jokes but it's a reality God wants to hear from us and I just thought it was so special that the Prophet made it so simple that it's not hard to have a season of Prayer it's actually very simple it's just a little sacrifice of our time now also Church don't be discouraged - if you feel like you need to take a vacation sometime and maybe go out in the wilderness and pray pray or you know I know I know vacations are expensive most of time right so it's hard to do occasionally and it's hard to get time off but bro Graham talked about how it was important for him to have vacation time he said now I got to go back to Arizona I got to go back Monday a week to go back to son to get the children there for school and I'm coming back then after that the wife has to be there early to register the children so we were talking about that's just to know me where we how they do there's a certain time there to register the children two weeks before school starts so that was back in that day and then I'm going to return back for a while here and now this is my vacation time as you know I preach since December January February March April May June July so that's quite a few months three four five six seven eight months in a row now if God be willing and not any special call this is the season I like to take my rest my vacation I go hunting amen so Jill or August was brother Rams time to take a little vacation huh me no it's alright to take a vacation is it alright they might say Amen on that wait it's not okay somebody better let me know because I like to have fun my wife and I get a little way you know once in a while you know we got we're way I think in what October and then in February for just a weekend two days away but even the prophet of God had to schedule a little vacation and he called his season so you could have a little season of prayer for a few minutes you can have a season of vacation a certain month well that's the month I like to get a little vacation now let's get a little more serious things now that's just a nice little kind of soft little light little subject there but now we get in the season for revelation program said God reveals his word only in its season Martin Luther had the same Bible we did Wesley read the same Bible Martin Luther did Pentecostals were the same Bible read it we did Jesus were the same Bible if the Pharisees read but they they're trying to keep the corn in the early stage when it was ripening they failed to see their hour now david has done the same thing here or what a blessing church that you and I could open the Bible and we can read you know Malik four five and six revelation ten seven and we can see what that actually means for today praise God hey you know they couldn't see it a couple hundred years ago but we can see it because it's the season that we're living in praise God beautiful God only does it in a season God chooses this word this season I'm sorry reveals awareness season to whom he chooses to reveal it to God chooses who he reveals it to he chose that before the foundation of the world all of his doings were for known by him hidden from man he just reveals him as he wills his chosen season his chosen person and he never did choose a party or sect it's a chosen person how he does it praise God so he didn't choose a denomination he never chose a certain group he chosen individual to reveal his word to praise God who is it that will dare to correct him and say now Lord you made a mistake by putting this man in the ministry this man doesn't believe like we believe so think of all the Pentecostals that didn't agree with brother Branham who is gonna tell God he's wrong in it it would take some money that's a little more delinquent than I am to tell him that he knows what he is doing he knows who to choose and who not to choose what to do and when to do it no matter how much we think that a certain person is qualified to do a certain job God knows who's qualified for the time and season or the time and the right time to do it praise God now is this thing Billy Graham a few weeks ago I just had to you know he just kind of came up on my YouTube and I listened to him and I thought my what a tremendous voice he had why he was just a powerful speaker and no doubt that's the reason people flocked to him and brother Branham said he had justification down to a tee nobody can preach salvation like Billy Graham and who's gonna tell god that he was wrong for Billy Graham to preach salvation right nobody you'd be a delinquent to say God should have gave it to somebody else no God gave it to the right man praise God but we should be able to say the same thing when we listen to brother that God gave him the message of the rapture praise God and nobody can preach it like him hey amen hallelujah nobody could take his place and you'll be a delinquent to say that it should be for somebody else other than who yeah you'd be a far more delinquent man than me to say that it wasn't brother man's message to get a bride ready for Christ amen and the true real Christian the real believer in God waits upon the Lord for these things wait on your ministry if you feel a call be sure that it's God be sure that's right be sure it's a timely of what you're saying the Bible said they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up upon the wings like an eagle they shall run and not be weary if they walk they'll not faint notice David king of Israel just anointed Samuel poured the oil upon him and he was chosen of God to be king of Israel and David got this revelation to bring the Ark of the Lord up to the City of David now there's nothing wrong but you see David went at it wrong there was nothing wrong with with God with God putting it on David's heart of course David had the right I desired to bring that Ark but he went about it the wrong way now I copied and pasted a few slides from about two years ago when I preached a little bit on this I just want to review this I thought it'd be good because I forgot the five months so if I thought I forgot it well we all probably forgot it right so there's five months if we want to do the will of God but man said it must be his time and season it must line up with his word it must be his person to do it and then it must come through his prophet and then it must be his vindicated prophet but remember those are the five mus to doing the will of God now he says now I'm just going to skip these because these just kind of tell what I already said first is time season no it must be word ok program profit and they says there's your five must then it must be a vindicated profit ok so David miss on three of the five three of the five so you didn't even get him right right now he said they'd already done one thing wrong two things wrong and then he goes down there three things wrong so David got the time and season right that was the right time in season but he didn't consult the word David was the right person to do it but he didn't go to the profit nor did he go to the vindicated profit praise God now let's just apply that to our lives for a little bit here first for whatever we feel caught of God to do is it the right time and season does it line up with the word am I the person to do it and did it come through his prophet and now what I mean by this is that you could have a prophecy from someone who has the gift of prophecy but then that prophecy must line up with God's vindicated prophet for this day brother Branham right because we know a couple people that had prophecies over them team Meyers and different ones brother kam had a prophecy over him but but no matter what a minor prophet is said it's got to line up with the major prophet praise God and so so David he had the right time he missed the waiter because he put it on the cart rather than the shoulders was that right so he had to be packed up on the shoulder of the Levites he was the right person because he caught the revelation but the problem was he did not consult a single prophet he went to men that were not prophets right and then he didn't go to the prophet of the which was Nathan because he was them major profit of the hour amen praise the Lord so what if David a man after God's own heart right if he missed on three or five and he was a man after God's own heart how careful she knew and I be before we do something now remember church God said if you seek my face with all your heart you'll find me so that's Jeremiah 29 how many four member that if you seek me a find me I'll seek me with all your heart right so apparently David must have not saw it with everything right because he didn't consult the word he didn't consult any local prophet and he didn't in fact salt consulted the major prophet so if we're gonna do something if we're going to make a choice a major decision our lives it behooves us to seek God with all we have and what I mean by that is you might have to take a Saturday morning offer whatever your day off is maybe it's Wednesday I don't know if maybe it's Monday whatever your day and you might have to just devote a day or a morning or evening or a couple let's say you can just do a morning well devote that morning all month so that's Saturday do all four salaries in a row but make sure you can say at the end of that that you've saw God with all your heart because if not you're gonna miss on the plan of God praise the Lord that's why I'm so thankful before we started this church we fasted and prayed before we started cams church because cam was coming here Simon before we did that we fasted and prayed the whole day over at that one church over there I forget near Jose's old place well low drive motor drive and we had a day of fasting and praying and God so hazm indicated that God gave the miracles and signs and wonders and God still doing great things at brother cams church because we fasted and prayed for the right time and season and all this was lined up you know I think I think cam or I'm sorry brother Brooks and I ordained cam a prophet or saw a pastor so I but that all lines up with programs message it all lines up everything was lined up with the word so I believe in this how many believe in this so many times decisions are made and you may have waited a certain time or season may we maybe we have but have we really saw God with all of our hearts and as you know what David you're gonna save a lot of pain if you do it the right way it always makes sense to do it the right way wait a little bit on the Lord don't push anything to force them to get done just wait upon the Lord for it to get done so just a little admonition tonight can I just say like that does anybody have any major decisions coming up for the next year month or anything like that anybody no okay well maybe you will but before you do that may the Holy Spirit bring this back to your remembrance that we must seek God with all of our hearts and these five conditions must be met they must be met if not something awful can happen now the beautiful thing is it just took three months and it was all made right again amen everything that went wrong was made right again amen that shows us how merciful how loving how sweet how faithful how patient our long-suffering our Lord is amen so let that be an encouragement to us church that we want to get all five out of five how many want to pass that test now that's a real word test right there Amen I don't want to get a what is that 40% I don't want to get a 40% on my god test I want to get a hundred percent Amen I want to pass it exactly right amen so look what he says getting into his ministry I love this quote here and I wonder today if all of our drawing in and great Crusades and revivals we haven't been filling up the Methodists octa Baptists Ark the Presbyterian Ark and what about the Ark of Christ the word and if the bride is to be the word then she's got to be of Christ part the bridegroom she's got to be the word the word not for his day the word for this day that he promised would be this day that he sent his word for it to mold his bride and make her hope we see it don't get some idea of your own now and don't take somebody else's idea take the vindicated word here of the Bible it says God has promised in his word up you would choose his bride in the last day did you know that he promised it how he would do it and that by his original plan of choosing Christ or choosing the times choosing the seasons he can't miss it on his bride because she's part of that word he can't choose it by denomination thank God amen that gets us a lot closer amen Alleluia - being in the perfect will of God he when he didn't choose Christ by denomination did he did Christ come the denomination did he come denomination no they rejected him well that's what the denomination done then then when he chooses a bride can he come any other way Oh huh how did he bring Christ Church by the word of the prophets is that right how do we bring the what brought here by the word of the prophets how do you identify when he came by a man with the spirit of Elijah partum come out of the wilderness how we identify his bride he promised in Malachi 4 the same thing before destroyed the earth like it was in the days of Sodom amen thank you nor how does he choose the bride he said Elijah restores all things Matthew 17 11 and Elijah is sent to you in Malachi four five and six the brother Branham was sent to us right and when he sent to us and we hear what he says it restores the Bible so you and I see the Bible as a living book and it's living today right now amen it restores the Preds of Jesus Christ that doctrine of Jesus Christ the person of Jesus Christ it restores the the Word of God Jesus Christ it restores all of Jesus to us amen and that's all by the prophets Malachi Isaiah all the prophets Moses all the prophets spoke of him and that's what we're living in the day when all this is fulfilled how they do yeah it's the right diamond season now this is something other a men and I were talking about a few weeks ago and I didn't mean to I wasn't planning on preaching it but when I came across the in the quotes I thought well this will be helpful to go over again for the church there was a season of revelation for brother Branham with mark 11:23 if you're having your Bibles well you don't have to all go right to it and Jesus answering said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say to you what things soever ye desire when you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them now brother Branham struggled over this for not months not weeks this scripture struggled him for years he said oh if we could weigh those words you can have what you say not what I say but what you've said you can have what you said for years I lingered over that I went to every one they said if I can't rightly divide it it's still the true so we searched every dot dictionary and dot lexicon so I believe sometimes it God just lets us see things when it's time for us to see things aren't you glad Church that's encouraging you and I will see the body change when it's time for the body change hey we might not see it right now how it's even possible how can our bodies be swallowed up by a supernatural Holy Ghost power overflowing us how could that happen we may not see it now but if we're alive and remain and wait for that we're a part of the rapture we'll see it at the time when we're supposed to see it glory he withholds these blessings like the blessings that were enjoying today our forefathers did not enjoy those it wasn't season for them they couldn't enjoy the seven seals like weekend they couldn't enjoy the seven churches like we can amen hallelujah they can enjoy the blessings of marriage and divorce like weekend or the baptism only ghosts like we can they can't enjoy these things it was withholding from them and now church they got there's just a few things withholding from us that are withholding before the rapture there's very few things that still not been revealed but we're the ones by God's grace that may live to see them hallelujah oh my what is it it's just another blessing what is the rapturing faith it's just another blessing just like your blessing for divine healing just like your blessing for justification blessing for sanctification blessing for all these blessings of God so is the lobstering faith just another blessing from God Almighty just another blessing amen thank God for the blessings now here's where he struggled now let's skip down he said I could never preach on him because of this he said now I could not justify that because I could not understand that how then could it be that I would say something as a man what if I said something that wasn't according to his word and asked something was in the corners word that it would have to come to pass so this is our brother Brandon with this he always notice how it said if you say to the mountain be thou removed and brother have said well what if I said something that God didn't want me to say how many couldn't understand that this rugged him because Jesus said if you say to the mountain it'll happen and here's the problem Adam had see to me that took away from the atonement and put it on a person he said I could not understand it so Jesus said if you'd speak to the mountain it'll move and brother boys thought well is that me or God speaking then how can I just speak it and then it looks like it looks like I have all the power and not the power of the atonement praise God and isn't that a way or the way a lot of people preach it in denominations and in the message you'll hear you'll hear people say it all the time we've heard it you've heard it before oh just speak the word come on brother just speak the word but if God's not leading you to speak that word it's not gonna happen so always keep that in mind and I think we have a pretty mature church right I believe so by God's grace why do I say you're mature because you can handle deep preaching you can handle the meat of the preaching praise God that's right but see brother may have a struggle with this well if I say it then the it's me doing it and not God so brother may have learned though that Christians only speak the will of God according to the atonement in other words according to the will of God brother Branham use examples in this sermon speak to the mountain 19:59 of speaking squirrels and giving the fish back its life and so in each case it wasn't brother branham's thought to do it God through the atonement gave him grace to do that and that's what he says at the end of this service he clears closing words of the sermon all right listening this good old hymn my faith looks up to thee that's where we stand that's the only thing that a moving bone that's when God has to anoint you to such a faith that it cannot fail amen hallelujah Church listen there's no pressure don't feel pressured to speak to the mountain because it's not up to you to speak to the mountain it's up to God to speak to the mountain and if God wants you to speak to the mountain you'll feel such an anointing to speak that that's all you can do you cry you'll speak amen just like Moses you won't be crying about it well this problem on this awful problem when it's God's time to move that mountain he'll so poor spirit upon you you'll be like David your cup will run over you and then you can't help but speak because your cup is just flowing over with anointing afternoon tea with power at their power with inspiration abroad inspiration you'll speak to that problem you'll speak to that mountain and that mountain has to move me and that would happen on Sunday for those that you told me God supernaturally for Jose told me write down her service God and healed him as a miracle on Sunday and he told me with tears in his eyes what was it it wasn't any of us we just got under such an anointing that we spoke to them out and spoke to the headache whatever the trouble was we spoke to that and it had to move because it wasn't our anointing it wasn't because of us it was because of the atonement but blood of Jesus Christ amen Mary it wasn't us but see when we get into that anointing there was no fear for me to pray for Jose because it wasn't my anointing that was going to do it I don't have any power to do it it's God's anointing to do it let me understand that so ever have struggled for years how can it be me speaking to the mountain I thought God has to speak to the mountain do I need the atonement or not so he just preached on it what a wise prophet that is and church the same thing should apply to you if you're scared to speak to the mountain don't speak to it don't speak to it but when you so get in God's presence through prayer through worship through believing the word the Bible said the Holy Ghost fell as Peter preached the word this is one of the church this is one of the best times for the Holy Ghost to fall on you and speak to the mountain because that's when it fell in the day of Pentecost amen and when the Samaritans and the the Gentiles lot while Peters preaching the only goes false that's what I like to see now people that are disinterest in the preaching but people that are getting under the anointing that's on the preacher amen and then they'll speak to the mountain because God's anointing you we're the same anointing that's on the preacher and then it's gonna happen because it's God's anointing it's through the atonement through God's provided way not through our power or energy amen that's when God has to anoint you in fact you can look it up look up the word super anointing ever done that before when brother Boehner spoke the squirrels he said it was a super super anointing he said that came upon him well now that makes sense right now you and I can understand what would it be like to ever speak squirrels into existence it's easy to understand you have such an anointing there's no fear you have such an awareness you know God is there and the church said we can understand it now it's not it's not well how could he ever speak to a snowstorm and it could leave how could he ever speak to a fish and give his life back he could do it because it wasn't him doing it it was God doing it amen it was God vindicating the third Pole amen that's why in perfect faith mother ham could say that's normal you have to worry about it he said we know we're no longer wonder about the third for the third pole is he the third poles been vindicated amen I know yeah thank the Lord now I told you about that one time I spoke to the mountain my co-workers infertility guess what she sent me a text two weeks ago out of the blue she said I had a dream about you mr. Smith because they even want another baby so I'm waiting for the anointing she said she had a dream and the dream she couldn't have the baby but she said then I came over and smiled at her and said they're gonna have another baby so what am I waiting for just waiting for that waiting for the anointing I'm saying like that text about gave me an anointing I need to pray about it see you and I can't speak anything it will no good but when God so anoint you your cup overflows and you speak to the moment it's no longer humanity speaking its deity amen I didn't hear you praise God amen so the thing to do is get under the anointing amen and like you said it's not something that God's not a show-off God's not a clown no you have to do it at work I'll show me that you can speak the word worker show me can speak the word in front your family God's not a con God's not a show-off just wait for God's time and season see the trouble is people don't get under the anointing but man said if you want to get in the spirit you got to join with everybody else clapping you got to start stomping your feet you gotta start swaying back and forth you got to raise your head you cannot sit there like a Wallflower and expect to get in the spirit you know you get you can't romance that you just like the world gets into their big soccer games and football games and basketball games you got to get the same way instead of painting up yourself with the Cleveland Cavaliers cars paint yourself up with the nine thing of the Holy Ghost amen get painted up with that right right like like the Bible said stay out the word until your face is transformed just like Moses countenance was transformed in God's presence get your get our faces in the Word of God until the glory of God shines on our face that's how you get the trouble is people are too tired or too stubborn or don't want to confess sins or something like that you know how does it every Church well it's our church too it's every Church we've all real human we all got to overcome and get under the anointing so true so true lord help us amen I so brother can preach on heavenly places right there's something we've got to get into something we have to create something we have to we have to give an effort to get in that anointing that's right I think it's amen on that it takes effort churches takes a dying out got to give effort now I've before by the ass brother Bram could you speak us with the third bowl could you speak us in the rapture and he said he said now my dear friend I know what you're saying he said maybe I can polish it up a little clearer you see you're believing because of the spoken words that he said about that all you hear witness the squirrels he's somebody's notice that was sovereignly given he said I never asked him let me do this he by his own divine will came to me and said you go do this see I wasn't asking one thing about it all right Moses never asked to go down to Egypt but was God that sent him down to Egypt does that help over that helps I may have used this last a couple times this year but I just want to reiterate that to us that you can see brother Graham never did this on his own accord he would never try to do a miracle on his own accord in fact that's what he got in trouble for at the beginning his ministry he said I was in Balaam shoes because I said bring all the worst cases up here let me pray for those then brother Graham said he got he was getting the people's faith in miracles rather than faith in the word he said God had to correct him on that they angel Lord how to correct him on that so see it's the same thing you and I just have to stay under the anointing standard prayer stay in the Word of God and God will anoint us to speak his word and that's such a great revelation God made him wait years and years and years oh but look what God did all just struck me look what God did once he got the revelation then he started speaking the word amen then they smoked squirrels right they spoke to the storm then he spoke to meanest tumour Amen hallelujah then he spoke to Hattie right see once he laid once he waited for the time in season four the revelation then the revelation came then he could be faithful with the revelation then God could trust him with his word how do you want God to trust you with his word I do Lord trusts me with your word help me to be trustworthy with your word a true servant of God now what I want to get to Sunday and I never got to it so let me give me about a few more minutes here I had never seen it like this now this may not be some some huge deep revelation but I just I never seen it like this before God's fruit in the seeds and the Prophet is bringing it the Bible said this you read this on Sunday but his delight is in the law of the Lord in his law doth he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now look what he says the restoration of the bride tree I'm gonna skip down here he said no notice it's his his fruit that's the personal pronoun it's his fruit God's fruit in the season that the Prophet is bringing it it will be in the Prophet season God's fruit in God's time by the Prophet season see he shall bring forth this fruit in his season see if there isn't to his there bring forth his God's fruit see in the season that the messenger is ordained to come he'll bring forth those now remember that the messenger that brings the fruit of God will bring it in God's season in the season of the bringer see he will bring forward this fruit of season that cannot wither why he's got predestined it can't destroy it because it's predestinated amen so I've never applied this to a prophet I've always applied it just to me and you those of us born again feeding off the river water feeding off the Holy Ghost are fruits never wither in other words our love doesn't wither our long-suffering our peace our joy those don't wither we may go a little back there there or there never wither that you never get to a spot where you saying well I just don't have anymore peace anymore right never get the spot where you say well I have no more patience with brother Jesse anymore I'm done I'm gonna bawl him out do you ever get there before you ever get there I never got there with you see the fruit doesn't wither because that's what the Bible said it can't wither because it's predestinated it's gonna have somebody other words who can manifest the fruit of this hour who's able to give out the fruit to hungry people that wouldn't experience God's real fruit amen the sweetness of his fruit glory oh the sweetness of it the refreshing of it the strength from God's fruit praise God it cannot wither you'll never get to a spot if you're real only goes real Christian you'll never get in a spot where you don't have any more long-suffering you can't wait any longer for this person to get saved you're just you're gonna you're done praying for know if you've got real fruit that fruit will last but the evening light shall rise in the West what forward is shine upon the word what to ripen the fruit bring forth the bride tree with the same signs wonders and fruits that they had at the beginning it should be lie in the evening time right oh the word will then bring forth its fruit in its season it shall not wither but will bring forth its fruit David said in its seasons amen same fruit ooh had at the beginning praise God he says now look now I'm skipping ahead to the Seventh Seal I've held that word look at every vision everywhere the day I laid that cornerstone yonder I put that in there I wrote on there what he showed me that morning in a vision look what the Holy Spirit told him the instant in season and out of season rebuke with all long-suffering and doctrine for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but after their own lust shall he for themselves together teachers having itching ears and be turned away from the truth into fables and I've seen those two trees that I stood by do that very same thing that's right and here we are and that is true you remember the vision of the two trees where the RAM saw a vision and he saw a any tree he saw a oneness tree and God said don't don't join neither those plant a different tree right in between them amen and then the truth and that tree grew up right and it was mixed in there right it was right in the middle of it and then said after a while he said that kind of weight and then he said then all of all of them because of that tree planted all the people at the foot of the cross praising and worshipping Jesus glory amen so in other words the true message of God will bring people a real experience with the cross of Jesus Christ amen you know they don't get there in Trinity churches do that when the horns of the Trinitarian churches I didn't get there I really didn't die out in the church said I went to oneness Church for a little while only a couple services but I still went to one I never really got to the cross but brother Jose when I came to the message church and I came to hear that true pure Word of God brother I find myself at the cross amen that's always been my testimony the other two churches the Trinity and the oneness can never deliver me from my sins until I came to the message of the hour that's my testimony there's something I was going to say I think I'm gonna say it as I was writing a little bit so I devoted all this morning to the sermon and then at work I had some free time so I devote a little bit of time to writing the next book so when your Bible go to revelation 17 I think it's 9 I just want to lay a little thought in here about denominations that okay hope it's okay it kind of goes with this vision I'd yeah I didn't plan that but that'll work out who knows in revelation 17 what is required in order to recognize where the woman sits and who she is what is required what does God require of you to recognize that or what is required to recognize the 666 mark of the beast anybody shout it out wisdom yeah good Lydia were you looking at my notes today I didn't really have in my notes I just had it right there but I was meditating on the words I'm writing chapter 9 it's on Mystery Babylon during the 12 New Testament mysteries brother man talked about it in the services the end time and I'm starting off and I'm just the Holy Spirit was dealing with me on that there's one thing that's required to recognize the mother harlot it's wisdom I think it's amen to that revelation 17 9 I think it is yeah and here's the mind which hath wisdom the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sitteth wisdom now go to Revelation 13:8 I believe it is is it 13 8 nope it's 13 18 yeah 13 18 that's right I knew it was a 8 in their relation 13 18 here is wisdom that him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for his the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six praise God you know you might think Lord just give me the power to speak the word so I can know whether the mark of the beast is right denominations will say something God just filled me with so much power I can speak in tongues like a machine gun so I can know who that mother harlot is can you believe that you let some people think give me some divine healing gift let me do miracles I can be a part of the true church and gods like that's not what's required what's required is wisdom and what's the beginning of wisdom Church to fear the Lord the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom now how many nations will the Antichrist deceive it's a three-letter word all of them awesome so all that's required to recognize the mother harlot in the Trinity Church and the one that's right because one this will have mark of the beast to any denomination their denomination the UPC I am said every nomination will take the mark of the beast that's thus saith the Lord he said that's quite as that's quite a thought sir think about that they can baptize in his name they believe he's one person and there's still many people are still taking the mark of the beast in that church in that shocking is that shock you that shocks me they can have all that truth and still be a denomination still limit the Holy One of Israel still crucify the word for their day that right cuz a little more makeup that I'm cut their hair all these all these other signification issues they can't even get to second base with God right because second base is sanctification right they might get the first base through the name but they don't get a second base now think of this church now how does God give wisdom when you have the fear of the Lord how does God give wisdom what's the one thing you have to do to get wisdom once you have fear the Lord does anybody know James chapter one let's go there James chapter one there's one thing you got to do to get the wisdom of the Lord now think think about this this struck me I was I was so shocked when I was writing this I just felt the Holy Spirit riding through my fingers and typing it out I really did it was such a striking moment I like mine this is just all coming together here I never I never had placed all these scriptures together we just put about four scriptures together James 1 verse 5 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men what how does he give it abounding Leah liberally is the King James does God in other words does God want to give wisdom or not yeah yeah God is God is so liberal right he just wants to give God once got God's like up there he's saying I'd love to give you this wisdom will you ask me how many nations are gonna take him up on that none cuz they're all gonna be deceived I hope everybody see yeah the impact of this thought and upbraideth not but it shall be given him so God said if you ask for wisdom I'll gladly give it to you how many can say men but first you have to fear the Lord you have to respect for God and you got to ask and you have to believe verse 6 but let him and ask him faith nothing wavering for he that wave with is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed now one more scripture go to James for well I check out 2 more why how come all these people in the denomination or even the message can say they're asking God for wisdom and then not get it because they're asking with the wrong motive and objective you ask and receive not because you ask amiss that you consume it upon your lusts and Jesus said in Matthew 7:14 he said broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there are many there are that fall into that narrow is the way that leads to life and how many be there that find it few I'm giving a little quizzes here tonight how are you ready it was a pop quiz so let's put all those together God wants to pour out wisdom so people can recognize who the false churches he's not going to hold it back he wants to just give it to everybody but you'll receive it because they're not asking for wisdom with a pure heart that wants to know it they're just asking God give me money God give me food God give me a sexual partner or God give me this or God give me a big house or God give me their asking for their lust only all's God wants them to ask is God give me your wisdom amen I knew you gonna say like this I feel like there's probably some Solomon's in here tonight Amen that you and I did not ask for riches or will you and I ask for the wisdom of God now do you see what I'm trying to say did I bring it across ok can anybody see it if I didn't Lord let the Holy Spirit reveal to him tonight I feel like I maybe didn't bring it out the right way can you see and you understand that so that's why brother man had to plant a new seed not seeds of discrepancy but pure word seeds amen the original seed oh yeah because all these other ones were the wrong scene of discrepancy and they asked they pray all the time sure but they're not asking for the truth because it might offend somebody might offend their grandma might offend their grandpa might offend their wife or their girlfriend or their boyfriend so when they pray I see it on Facebook all the time well I'm praying for you here praying for you there and they prayed all these prayers but it's selfish prayers because the next day they're Custance we're go to the dirty movies you know sexual sins all these things like that music filthy music see they're mixing with unclean spirits but you and I should be free from unclean spirits you and I should be under the anointing of the Holy Spirit does everybody see that God just wants to give out wisdom so they can escape the false church and just get saved but their problem is they're so filled with the lust of the world remember if you love the things of the world the love of God is not even in you and they pray sure they pray but it's for the wrong things now how many say God helped me to pray for the right things that's what I was praying earlier prayer so powerful because God either answers it like on Sunday right Jose or God says no and either way it's powerful because it's making us wait if you don't answer it teaching us to be patient and then we get upset about that or we get impatient about that it's so powerful now let me find place the clothes here give me ten minutes so see the two trees now the two trees he couldn't be a part of either one of those he had to come plant an original seed and had to grow up and then because of this tree now they can enter in and now they can go to the cross for some reason he said it kind of faded out and then I didn't quite understand it I looked at three or four times on that vision so remember second Timothy four was Bo's brand Tabernacles foundation and it wasn't playing the tapes in new season it was preaching the word a new season right are you with me Church and what the Holy Spirit say said brother Graham this is not your Tabernacle right but that's what they're making today his tabernacle this is his cybernetico God said it wasn't in his tabernacle see how it's all focus on brother man brother man it's close like we like we know it's close to idolatry right they're getting close god help him we pray for him all the time but look all these things that are on the tapes and they're all saying all these things they're just being passed over see it's got to be a chord in the word the seasons got to line up with the word it's all got to be the Word of God amen ha ha thank you lord preach the word let me see where I can close here I got so many more look I got all that okay I'm almost done okay ah yeah let me see if I can finish this next thought it shall be line the evening time Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever the bride tree it come up at Pentecost there's a tree that David saw it's planted by the rivers of water one river the Holy Spirit all these waters flowing into a gift spiritual gifts flowing into it it's leaves can't wither it will bring forth its fruit is that right remember it'll bring forth its fruit and it's season see church this is what this is why feel like everyone in our church in every church needs to be born again because if if you're born again these gifts will flow right through you praise God and number one of those is wisdom amen one of those is wisdom and mother have said that's the most important one because that manages all other eight of them amen how they do you we want to think what miracles is probably the most important one but brother Ram said wisdom is the most important one his wisdom helps you manage the rest and also helps you see the true church and the false church come out of her my people but the sad part is they're so few of his people because they don't where they want to ask upon their lusts they just want to live their best life now instead of living their best life over there in eternity right it sad to say let me finish with this one I said look here Fred let's think about nature God works in his nature let's watch what happened the Sun rose in the east the oldest civilization we had civilization we have is in China we know I'll know that the oldest civilization we have is China all right the civilizations move west we're all along and now where would you leave it if if you left the west coast going straight across go to China exactly we're at the end the Bible said the Prophet said there will be a day when it won't be day or night when the sons are passing over when the evening time just before ends up over there again it'll be light the same jesus said there will be a former rain and a latter rain and the latter rain will produce both former rain and latter rain in the same season praise God we're at the end time so remember this is bro Graham said this is thus saith the Lord the church age book he says and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and brother man says that's the same season praise God so well other man's ministry was the former rain the teaching rain and then the rapturing faith is the latter rain so can I say like this we're in the same season of the layers in church age it's the same season we haven't changed see since it's still brother-sister it's still harvest time amen what is it just getting drier and drier and we just got to lay the Prince of the Sun right we gotta wait for that last latter rain by the grace of God because it is the same season now he says they had many Exodus is of course but I'm speaking of time that God called in Exodus a separation from where they were at the present time here God is making ready to fulfill his divine promised word that he gave to Abraham and to Isaac and to Jacob years hundreds of years of past but yet God never forgets his promise in the season the do time God always makes his promise right oh yeah praise God this rapture promise has been here 2,000 years but it doesn't make any difference to God it's still gonna come to pass in God's season amen God didn't forget like I wonder what season it is now I wonder what word the bride needs next he's not wondering it he never forgets they meant he was on time for the first sxs that brought two million people out of Egypt physically he was on time for the day of Pentecost and he brought all those three thousand out right away into the baptism the Holy Ghost and brother/sister he'll be on time so he changed our body so we can be at that meeting in the air in that sweet sweet by mine and it'll be your time he never forgets his promise amen therefore you can rest assured that what God has promised in the Bible he's going to do it just no need to try to think anything else to say well the promise and maybe maybe brother Brandon was wrong he was right brother and it was right with us a to live he was right it's going to come to pass it's not saith the Lord it's according this word don't let doubts come into your mind just let's just believe the saith the Lord amen it looks what church it looks awful for the Roman Catholic Church I don't know how well I maybe I do now I didn't know how that false prophet was gonna pull off changing their reputation their reputation is dirt right now because of all these sexual crimes in America but actually I think I do know how it's gonna come to pass the Bible said he'll do lying wonders and miracles and with flatteries right he'll take the hill take the covenant with the people the Pope is gonna just flatter them and say such wonderful Christians right oh you're such sweet sweet people thank you for your love and thank all you just thank you we all got to be one let's have communion together come to my church of course so make you go to his church he won't come to your church eventually you go to the Jewish Church right because that's in the temple of God saying that he is God but then he'll do miracles church and the whole world will wonder well I guess we can forget all this sexual molestation maybe God forgave him God never forgave them because they never repented in order to be forgiven you've got to repent and they've never repented they keep these men and most of the men in the positions there's never any judgment opponent it was a real child of God they would lay that axe of the root of the tree amen hallelujah they would cut those sinners out of their churches amen nuns are like nuns and priests alike but it shows they're not interested in that they're interested in tickling their ears well maybe brother Branham was wrong maybe there won't be any driverless cars or maybe there won't be a mark of the beast with a unionized religion no there will be it whether or whether people want to accept their or not there's going to be it because this thus saith the Holy Bible that's right not the most impossible then more impossible than it does now he says but God did it anyhow because he promised he would do it oh thank the Lord and look how simple he does do it so see we're looking for something great Church we are looking for something worldwide it's gonna be something worldwide brother man said it'll be so humble right with the third pole so it's working he said they'll be so humble but it will be for the bride don't look for something great don't look like it has to come in special services will when it's brother Jessica and right brother so-and-so from there brother where does he when are we gonna have that we might we don't have to have that we don't know what God's gonna do but one thing we know it's going to be so simple it'll be so humble it'll be God anointing us to speak the word he'll speak it Amen right it'll be him here's his anointing will overflow us amen he'll bring his old word to pass he says I have come down to Akron Ohio I've heard the cry let's stand to our feet I've heard the cry of Bride of Christ fellowship I remember my promise to my bride I've come down and do it I'm sending you you knew it I'm going to be with you certainly I'll be with you my never never failing presence will be with you wherever you go don't be afraid oh I like that don't you I'm coming deliver I'm sure the spiritual mind catches that see I'm going to send you to bring my people to Nexis call them out and I'll be with you that's what God did with brother Branham praise be let's stop right there maokai you want to come here I just had a few more slides but I think stop right there because that's kind of a different thought there let's finish with that thought God is going to mr. past the former I and he will cause to come down you the former rain and the latter rain in the same season that's encouraging Church it's encouraging for us tonight to know that we're still living in the same season as brother Branham lived Leora see him and last time we checked the book of Revelation Jesus is still standing in the myths of the seven golden candlesticks three on this side three on this side one in the middle he's still standing that means Church he's standing here tonight if there's any needs on our hearts tonight since bow our heads here let's think about the needs that we have as I said earlier maybe a major decision will come up pretty soon if so Church then you and I whoever's in this decision seat needs to seek God with all of your heart because God said you'll seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart baby church you just have a little minor decision and maybe need wisdom then the thing to do is ask God with a pure heart with pure motives and objectives and then believe he's going to give it to you and he'll give it to you [Music] we're privileged people hallelujah we're living in Exodus where God never forgets his promise God set his tree and he planted between two seeds of discrepancy the original seed tree and it's bringing forth evening time fruit that you and I get to enjoy thank God for that this evening time fruit doesn't wither all we can thank you for that Jesus amen hallelujah the fruit of the message doesn't wither because it's true now just as it was 56 years ago how they do thank you lord let's pray to night church and if you're in that area you're in that spot that valley decision where you got to make a major decision or a minor let's pray for wisdom tonight because he's liberally trying to give it to us we're so thankful for that Heavenly Father's we bow our heads we thank you for the word tonight Lord seeing that he's always speaking your time and season Lord as we read at the beginning your prophet said or not here my chance tonight we're here because this is the sovereign will of God Lord you ordained that we came to church tonight to hear this word or there's so much that was said Lord perhaps you're encouraging us to wait to speak the word until we're fully anointed with that super anointing how they do you maybe we have a major decision let us before we decide let's make sure we've sought you with all of our heart in all five must line up with the will of God maybe it's at this end of the sermon this thought here Lord and we just have to ask and you liberally give us your wisdom or maybe if we've doubted in thought well maybe gods forgot his promise sir maybe Road RAM was wrong on some of these things god help us to see that your truth your fruit never withers hallelujah and you want to give us the wisdom Lord many times more than we want to receive it so help your people Lord many of them having decisions and I'll run I know I'm speaking in those live stream you know amen in vain
