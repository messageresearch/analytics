[1:03] greetings everybody god bless you
[1:06] it's good to be with you I'd say over
[1:10] the internet and just want to greet
[1:13] everybody the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:14] Christ thank you for your prayers I know
[1:19] a lot of people have been praying for
[1:20] our family
[1:22] some people have sent me texts and asked
[1:25] how the family is doing and we've had a
[1:28] real rough week but we're starting to
[1:30] come out of it by the grace of the Lord
[1:31] so thank you for your prayers I really
[1:33] appreciate that I do want to say I'm
[1:38] sorry about Sunday morning I went to bed
[1:43] with a fever and I thought perhaps it
[1:45] would pass because I've gone to bed
[1:46] before with a fever and woke up and then
[1:48] the fever was gone but the fever didn't
[1:52] pass and it lasted even to today but now
[1:55] it seems like it's gone by God's grace
[1:58] so I do apologize because we didn't have
[2:03] a service but we didn't have a preacher
[2:06] and didn't have a song leader or
[2:09] musician available so I thought it would
[2:12] be best to cancel service so I apologize
[2:14] for any inconvenience now I talked to
[2:18] brother Adam on a text and I need to
[2:22] text brother van yet but we thought
[2:24] about putting a plan in place if this
[2:26] ever happens again in the future and so
[2:29] I'll text brother bang and brother Adam
[2:31] about that and our plan is just to have
[2:36] a prayer service in the future if this
[2:39] should ever happen again if I should
[2:40] ever get sick at the last minute we
[2:42] can't get a preacher in we would just do
[2:44] like a prayer service brother Loras was
[2:48] there he could just lead songs if not we
[2:51] just do prayer and then do a tape of
[2:53] brother Branham so I wasn't able to get
[2:57] ahold of bang early enough and that was
[3:00] my fault
[3:02] so in the future of that ever would
[3:05] happen again
[3:06] that we would just do a prayer service
[3:09] and then listen to tape a brother
[3:11] branham and close the service so I would
[3:14] just need bang and Adam kind of in one
[3:19] Accord about that so that's my plan for
[3:21] the future but I do apologize like I
[3:24] said for Sunday I just didn't think I'd
[3:27] be sick you know I thought I'd be all
[3:29] right so I do apologize about that but I
[3:32] want to let you know hopefully we'll
[3:33] have a plan in place for the future also
[3:37] I sent out an email on Saturday night we
[3:41] have brother Ben Neriah coming on June
[3:43] 24 so that's pretty awesome very
[3:45] thankful for that
[3:46] and then brother Brooks will be here
[3:48] this weekend so hopefully my family and
[3:51] I are all back to complete full health
[3:55] but even if something would happen where
[3:57] I'd get sick again brother Brooks will
[3:59] certainly be here I think he's coming in
[4:00] tomorrow actually so brother Brooks will
[4:05] definitely be here to preach to services
[4:07] on Sunday so we're thankful to the Lord
[4:10] for that and so I do believe that's all
[4:16] the announcements oh and one more thing
[4:20] I hope this is OK tonight I just started
[4:24] having strength around it be around noon
[4:26] or 1:00 2:00 or 3:00 somewhere in the
[4:28] early afternoon you know just to kind of
[4:30] walk around and not be in constant pain
[4:32] I want to thank the Lord for that touch
[4:35] and also my wife just nursing him back
[4:38] to health so it was the longest sickness
[4:41] of my life I can't ever remember being
[4:43] that sick but I do want to thank you for
[4:47] doing this live stream here tonight by
[4:50] the grace of the Lord
[4:51] so anyways with that being said let's
[4:54] just have a word of Prayer and then we'd
[4:56] like to do the Bible study on the fear
[4:58] of the Lord I'm sure you can see the
[5:00] title there of this YouTube video so
[5:05] it's the fear of the Lord Bible study
[5:07] and this is wisdom series part 2 so
[5:11] let's just have a word of Prayer as we
[5:13] look at this thought on the fear of the
[5:15] Lord Heavenly Father Lord we thank you
[5:18] God for your mercy and your love we
[5:20] thank you for your son Jesus Christ
[5:23] Thank You Laura that you made a way back
[5:26] to heaven Lord God thank you that you
[5:28] made a way Lord that the righteous can
[5:31] walk along that way Lord and be with you
[5:34] for eternity Lord we're grateful for
[5:36] that so we humble ourselves here tonight
[5:40] Lord we ask that you just bless our
[5:41] little Bible study here father and just
[5:44] thank thank you for the strength Lord
[5:45] that you've given me to get the study
[5:48] ready Lord and to have this study and I
[5:50] pray to bless the hearts of the saints
[5:54] Lord God and our congregation and anyone
[5:57] else who is feeling lead Lord to view
[6:00] this Lord so that's your word Lord
[6:02] strike deep in our hearts father made
[6:04] changes Lord draws closer to you Father
[6:08] in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[6:11] so I like to look at the fear of the
[6:13] Lord as we said and just remember it
[6:16] remember that wisdom and proverbs let's
[6:20] define those again we define them last
[6:22] time we preached on the book of Proverbs
[6:25] so wisdom is skillful timely application
[6:28] of the word to your daily life so it's
[6:32] how you daily apply God's Word to your
[6:35] life
[6:36] another way to say it's how well you
[6:38] build or create your life and that's of
[6:41] course done by speaking the word but
[6:44] also obeying the Word of God a proverb
[6:47] is a brief well-known principle that
[6:50] states a general truth so we kind of
[6:53] majored on those last time we looked at
[6:56] how proverbs many times are absolute
[7:00] truths and then sometimes their
[7:03] probability truths which means they
[7:05] happen most of the time so we just have
[7:09] to rightly divide that by the grace of
[7:11] the Lord let's start with the fear of
[7:14] the Lord here now the fear of the Lord
[7:16] is defined in the Hebrew as moral
[7:21] reverence and so reverence means honor
[7:25] respect or profound adoration
[7:34] and fear is the prerequisite to wisdom
[7:40] so we all want wisdom
[7:42] the Bible says wisdom is the principal
[7:46] thing so if you have your Bibles
[7:48] proverbs chapter 4 verse 7 proverbs
[7:53] chapter 4 verse 7 says wisdom is the
[7:58] principal thing therefore get wisdom and
[8:02] with all thy getting get understanding
[8:07] so the word principle in the Hebrew
[8:10] means the first in order of rank so the
[8:13] highest priority in our life is to get
[8:16] wisdom skillfully applying the Word of
[8:19] God to our life or timely application of
[8:22] God's Word to our life that's the most
[8:25] important thing we can get is wisdom of
[8:29] the Holy Spirit when to do this command
[8:32] of God how to do it and that will be
[8:35] pleasing to the Lord now if if wisdom is
[8:41] the principal thing to gain on your
[8:43] earthly journey then the fear of the
[8:48] Lord is your necessary foundation for
[8:51] this journey or we'd say this is your
[8:53] fuel for the journey like if you're
[8:55] making it for you liking it unto a
[8:58] travel you know if your life journey is
[9:01] like traveling if you use that imagery
[9:05] fears your fuel that's what's gonna
[9:08] guide you on your journey of wisdom fear
[9:14] of the Lord is the driving force of your
[9:17] life in order to to gain wisdom and so
[9:21] to lose the fear of the Lord is to lose
[9:24] wisdom fear the Lord is the pre-wet
[9:28] prerequisite it's something that you
[9:31] have to have I have to have it or we
[9:33] lose our way and it's so incredibly
[9:37] important this is because of proverbs 9
[9:40] verse 10 says the fear of the Lord is
[9:42] the beginning of wisdom and the
[9:45] knowledge of the holy is understand
[9:49] so that's the beginning once you've got
[9:51] fear of the Lord once you've got this
[9:53] honor for God once you have this respect
[9:58] this profound adoration now you've begun
[10:01] on your path of wisdom and we'll get to
[10:08] this a little bit too but remember
[10:09] wisdom also according to proverbs 3:18
[10:12] wisdom she is a tree of life to them
[10:16] that lay a hold on her so again with
[10:18] that imagery of us on a journey we're
[10:20] journeying to lay a hold on wisdom
[10:24] eventually we lay hold on eternal life
[10:28] but wisdom is this fear the Lord is the
[10:31] driving force on our journey - to live a
[10:34] wise life now this is interesting
[10:39] thought I just kind of came to me as I
[10:41] was studying the word here today if you
[10:44] go to proverbs chapter 2 let's read in
[10:46] proverbs chapter 2 because I asked
[10:49] myself how do we obtain the fear of the
[10:51] Lord now there's different ways in the
[10:53] scripture you know the Bible said when
[10:56] angels appeared or when God's presence
[10:58] appeared the people feared the Lord so
[11:01] God's presence immediately brings fear
[11:04] we know that that's one way to have the
[11:09] fear of the Lord but in our daily lives
[11:11] I think proverbs chapter 2 verses 1 to
[11:15] 11
[11:16] I'll give us a lot of great insight on
[11:20] how to get wisdom on a daily basis
[11:22] because we all know we don't have
[11:24] visions or dreams or supernatural
[11:26] encounters every single day be great if
[11:29] we did but we don't have that we
[11:31] wouldn't want them to become common so
[11:35] it seems proverbs chapter 2 verses 1 to
[11:39] 11 have this the circumstances where we
[11:45] can gain the fear of the Lord so if the
[11:49] fear of the Lord is the prerequisite the
[11:50] foundation the driving force if it's
[11:54] what's required for this journey to be
[11:55] successful we definitely want to know
[11:58] how do we get this fear of the Lord
[12:01] and I think it's just a beautiful
[12:02] passage of Scripture so to read that
[12:05] proverbs 2 verse 1 so I'll read it for
[12:11] you my son if thou wilt receive my words
[12:14] and hide my commands with thee so that
[12:17] thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and
[12:19] apply thine heart to understanding now
[12:23] here it is in verse 3 4 and 5 there's
[12:26] like four steps to gaining the fear of
[12:32] the Lord so I want you to watch this in
[12:34] verse 3 yay if thou cries after
[12:37] knowledge so the first one is crying out
[12:40] and lift us lift us up thy voice for
[12:45] understanding so those are kind of the
[12:47] same crying out lifting up your voice
[12:51] for verse 4 if you seek missed her as
[12:55] silver and searches her asked for hid
[13:00] treasures so I guess I could narrow this
[13:02] down to two crying now and seeking after
[13:06] God now look at verse five this is the
[13:09] the key this is what I believe the Holy
[13:12] Spirit spoke to my heart today when I
[13:15] was studying and preparing look at verse
[13:17] 5 this is beautiful if you do this then
[13:19] in verse 5 then shalt thou understand
[13:23] the fear of God and find the knowledge
[13:27] of God so let's back up again and show
[13:32] that you we've got to cry out and then
[13:35] we've got to seek after knowledge and
[13:39] understanding then we understand the
[13:42] fear of the Lord so it seems this is one
[13:45] way we can really make me trim our lamps
[13:49] we might say this is one way we can
[13:51] really refresh our fear of the Lord is
[13:56] to get alone with God in the prayer
[13:59] closet or when you study or when you
[14:02] seek the Lord to get alone with God cry
[14:06] out in prayer crowd to the Lord and ask
[14:09] God to give you wisdom give you
[14:12] understanding give you the fear of the
[14:13] Lord and then
[14:15] time crying out spend time seeking your
[14:19] answers to your questions reminds me of
[14:22] when David said there's one thing I
[14:23] desired and he said that's to dwell in
[14:26] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[14:27] life that I might inquire in God's
[14:30] temple so just ask God questions and ask
[14:33] God for his understanding for his will
[14:35] and the Bible said if you do this if we
[14:40] cry out and if we seek it as silver then
[14:44] we'll understand the fear of the Lord so
[14:46] that was that was a to me it was a
[14:48] revelation to me and I could say amen to
[14:51] that times in my life when I felt like
[14:55] I've received God's instruction where
[14:57] times I was really diligently praying
[14:59] and crying out and seeking the Word of
[15:03] God for answers and then according to
[15:05] God's rule you know if you draw a knife
[15:08] to God God will draw nigh to you but
[15:11] let's keep reading here because you can
[15:12] just see the some of the more truths
[15:15] about gaining the fear of the Lord look
[15:18] at verse 6 for the Lord giveth wisdom
[15:21] out of his mouth cometh knowledge and
[15:23] understanding he layeth up sound wisdom
[15:26] for the righteous he's a buckler to them
[15:29] that walk uprightly notice he lays it up
[15:32] so it seems like you got to look up you
[15:33] got to cry up you got to pray you know
[15:36] ask God for those blessings like brother
[15:38] Brian talked about on the Variety story
[15:39] of all these blessings in the variety
[15:42] store we just need a ladder a prayer to
[15:45] just go up there and get what we have
[15:46] need of the wisdom of the Lord verse 8
[15:51] he keepeth the paths of judgment and
[15:53] preserveth the way of his Saints then
[15:57] shalt thou understand righteousness and
[16:00] judgment and equity yay every good path
[16:03] and I think that's what do you want I
[16:04] think that's what I want I want every
[16:07] path I walk in to be God's path and not
[16:11] my own but I want to see the leadership
[16:14] of the Holy Spirit in the path of
[16:16] walking verse 10 when wisdom enters into
[16:20] thine heart and knowledge is pleasant
[16:24] unto thy soul discretion shall preserve
[16:28] the understanding shall keep thee so God
[16:34] promised to preserve us and keep us
[16:37] after we've received his wisdom but
[16:39] first we gotta cry out for it and we
[16:42] gotta spend time seeking God and then
[16:45] that's when God helps us to understand
[16:47] the fear of the Lord and after that God
[16:50] grants wisdom to us
[16:51] and remember this all ties in with James
[16:54] chapter 1 if a man needs wisdom he just
[16:57] has to ask God and not doubt so the best
[17:00] way we're not gonna doubt is by spending
[17:02] time with God you know spending more
[17:04] time with God than we do with worldly
[17:06] things we've got to devote our full life
[17:09] to Christ so I hope that helps you I
[17:13] thought that was a beautiful nugget in
[17:16] the scripture about how we understand
[17:20] the fear of the Lord how do we get that
[17:21] we've got to cry out we've got to seek
[17:24] for it like we'd seek for gold
[17:25] like we'd seek a job that would like
[17:27] we'd see seek silver rather so this
[17:31] shows again the power of a prayer life
[17:32] the power of personal study you and God
[17:37] just saying God this is your my time
[17:39] together I just want to study your word
[17:41] I just want to know you more and that's
[17:44] a time when your fear of the Lord seems
[17:47] to increase or your you have a more of a
[17:51] reverence for the Lord okay so I'm
[17:56] looking at our time here so I make over
[17:58] a little over 1/2 hour I know I did some
[18:02] announcements at the beginning and a
[18:03] prayer so next part of this Bible study
[18:08] I want to I want to read over most of
[18:12] the scriptures in Proverbs that talk
[18:16] about the fear of the Lord so there was
[18:18] 14 of them and we'll probably go over
[18:21] most of those and I'll stop and make a
[18:24] few comments on some of them and I
[18:27] thought it might be easiest if we just
[18:29] start at the beginning if you have your
[18:30] Bible I hope I'm not going too fast if I
[18:33] am please pardon me but if you have your
[18:35] Bible we'll just start in proverbs
[18:37] chapter 1 and we'll just flip right
[18:40] through
[18:42] we'll try to hit those 14 scriptures and
[18:47] I'll make sure I share which ones I
[18:48] think will really be a blessing to you
[18:51] that have been blessing to my heart this
[18:53] week as I've been looking at these
[18:54] scriptures okay so the first one is
[18:57] proverbs 1 verse 7 the fear of the Lord
[19:01] is the beginning of knowledge but fools
[19:04] despise wisdom and instruction so again
[19:09] this is how you begin to get godly
[19:11] knowledge and this reminds me of the
[19:13] statue of perfect man have fears and
[19:16] parts of faith virtue knowledge so we
[19:19] have to have the fear of the Lord even
[19:20] of course by the probably the first step
[19:23] or second step but at least by the third
[19:25] step because the fear of the Lord is
[19:27] just the beginning of knowledge so at
[19:34] the end of proverbs chapter 1 after
[19:36] wisdom cries out in the street you know
[19:38] I'm pouring out my spirit you know to
[19:40] type to the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[19:43] after she cries out for people to be
[19:46] born again her message is rejected and
[19:48] then at the end of the chapter she makes
[19:53] a mockery of those that wait until the
[19:55] day of judgment to cry out for wisdom
[19:57] and in proverbs 1:29 says for they hated
[20:01] knowledge and did not choose the fear of
[20:03] the Lord so again it shows that fools
[20:07] will wait till did the day of
[20:09] destruction to get their lives right or
[20:11] asked God how should I live my life and
[20:13] that's such a blessing if we can ask
[20:15] that everyday Lauren what decision
[20:17] should I make today help me not to be
[20:20] hasty hummina pray before every decision
[20:22] I just want to walk in the righteous
[20:24] pass of the Lord all right now proverbs
[20:29] 2 verse 5 we already read that if you
[20:31] cry out and if you seek God like you
[20:34] would gold you'll understand the fear of
[20:37] the Lord proverbs 3 verse 7 this is a
[20:42] really good one the next two I would
[20:45] probably say are some of the most
[20:47] crucial for us today in Laodicea with
[20:51] all the lust of the eyes the pride of
[20:53] life
[20:56] and the lust of the flesh sorry lust of
[20:59] the flesh lust of the eyes and pride of
[21:01] life but especially with the lust of the
[21:04] eyes so let's look at proverbs 8:13 the
[21:10] fear of the Lord
[21:11] I'm sorry proverbs 3 7 pardon me
[21:14] proverbs 3 7 be not wise in thine own
[21:18] eyes fear the Lord and depart from evil
[21:22] so it can truly be said when you have
[21:25] the fear of God
[21:27] you're not exalting yourself in wisdom
[21:30] so you're in a complete state of
[21:31] humility I just you're just sayin I'm
[21:34] just gonna trust God and I'm just gonna
[21:36] humbly just stay away from evil that's
[21:40] when you know you're walking in the
[21:42] spirit and then when you fear God you
[21:45] leave evil and especially for our eyes
[21:49] especially with technology and our cell
[21:51] phones and the internet and all the
[21:55] attractions the TV's whenever we go to
[21:58] Walmart of the eye candy all the
[22:02] temptations of the eyes we've the fear
[22:05] the Lord will cause us to leave all
[22:07] those situations
[22:09] now proverbs 8:13 is probably the most
[22:13] important scripture to me about the fear
[22:17] of the Lord so I want to read that
[22:18] proverbs 8:13 the fear of the Lord is to
[22:23] hate evil pride and arrogancy and the
[22:26] evil way and the froward mouth do I hate
[22:30] so this scripture kind of deals with the
[22:33] the fervency and zeal we preached on
[22:35] last month when we really fear God honor
[22:40] God respect God and then adore him we
[22:46] will begin to hate evil begin to hate
[22:49] sin we'll begin to hate things that
[22:51] causes the stumble like I said with the
[22:54] internet even with YouTube even with any
[22:59] anything that becomes an idol the fear
[23:03] the Lord makes us hate anything that
[23:05] goes against God's Word
[23:08] and I just want to tell a quick
[23:09] testimony one time I was at a public
[23:12] place with a brother in the Lord and he
[23:17] had a burden on his heart and I was
[23:19] really blessed by it and so we were
[23:23] talking and the brother started talking
[23:26] about the dangers of the internet and
[23:31] even in this public place it was such a
[23:34] beautiful testimony of the zeal of the
[23:37] Lord we're in a public place we're
[23:39] surrounded by people and he starts
[23:42] crying he starts raising his voice
[23:46] pointing you know and not upset with me
[23:49] but just upset with evil and the dangers
[23:53] of internet and cell phones and tablets
[23:55] and crying in front of all these people
[24:00] and to me it was a beautiful picture of
[24:03] the zeal of the Lord and it was just
[24:07] just something that I thought truly this
[24:11] brother has the fear of the Lord because
[24:13] he hates evil so much that even in the
[24:16] public place
[24:17] he's denouncing it crying raising his
[24:20] voice almost shouting because he hates
[24:24] evil so much and I thought God bless
[24:27] this individual so I just thought I
[24:30] would share that that I've seen the zeal
[24:33] of the Lord that close and the fear of
[24:36] the Lord as well to fear God is to hate
[24:40] any evil so anytime we hear a cuss word
[24:43] or see an immoral picture or anyone
[24:49] making fun of anybody you know any
[24:51] coarse or idle word you know Jesus said
[24:53] the idle words will be judged and so we
[24:56] can all say God forgive me helped me to
[24:59] cry it allowed for knowledge and
[25:01] understanding and grow and the
[25:04] understanding of the fear of the Lord we
[25:05] all need that from time to time but I
[25:09] think more so as the time goes on we
[25:11] need to grow in the fear of the Lord
[25:16] okay the next one proverbs 9:10 we
[25:19] already read that so we'll skip to
[25:20] proverbs 10:25
[25:22] the fear of the Lord prolong its days
[25:25] but the years of the wicked shall be
[25:27] shortened so again we know this one is a
[25:31] probability proverb most of the time God
[25:35] will extend the life of a believer and
[25:38] God will shorten a wicked persons life
[25:41] but we got to make sure we understand
[25:43] this the right way that doesn't mean
[25:45] every Christian is gonna live longer
[25:47] than a sinner like we gave the example
[25:48] brother Branham live in 56 years and
[25:51] Hugh Heffner live in 91 years so but
[25:57] most of the time this is a reality when
[25:59] you fear God it actually makes your life
[26:00] last longer when you respect God and you
[26:04] you put his commands first and you
[26:05] depart from evil you're gonna live
[26:08] longer most of the time by the grace of
[26:10] the Lord that really like proverbs 14
[26:14] verse 2 he that walketh in his
[26:17] uprightness fear the Lord but he that is
[26:21] perverse in his ways despise him so I
[26:30] just I just thought this scripture was
[26:33] nice because it tied in your daily walk
[26:35] with the Lord remember Peter said we
[26:38] don't walk in the vanity of our minds
[26:40] anymore so our walk is our thought life
[26:42] according to Peter so our thoughts have
[26:47] to be constantly I fear God I know God's
[26:49] watching I know God is he's keeping
[26:53] tally of my life like like I was telling
[26:56] somebody recently I said my whole life
[26:58] is live-streamed you know right now
[27:00] we're live stream in that church we live
[27:01] stream but I have this understanding and
[27:04] I'm sure you do too at the angels of God
[27:07] are around us all the time and so our
[27:10] lives are being live-streamed constantly
[27:12] and we want to reverence the Lord and we
[27:15] want to be aware of his presence so in
[27:18] other words our walk must be in the fear
[27:20] of the Lord our thought life will
[27:22] determine our walk in the fear of the
[27:24] Lord okay
[27:28] this is really good too proverbs 14 26 I
[27:32] think this will give you some strength
[27:35] proverbs 14 26 in the fear of the Lord
[27:39] is strong confidence and his children
[27:43] shall have a place of refuge so what a
[27:46] beautiful promise so strong confidence
[27:49] reminds us of faith so in the fear of
[27:51] the Lord is faith we can have a lot of
[27:53] faith trust as we trust that's what
[27:55] faith is is trust it's a revelation you
[27:58] trust God because his wills been made
[28:00] known to you so you could have faith
[28:03] when our hearts condemn us not like I
[28:06] said if we disobey the Word of God we
[28:09] lose that fear and then we step out of
[28:11] the path of wisdom so we've got to obey
[28:13] the Word of God then our heart doesn't
[28:15] condemn us and then as we fear the Lord
[28:18] it gives us strong confidence that God
[28:21] is with us God hears our prayers and
[28:24] he's faithful to his promises and also
[28:28] that's a great promise there to you were
[28:29] we will always have a place of refuge
[28:31] you always have a place of protection
[28:33] when we fear the Lord because God will
[28:37] always protect his people remember of
[28:40] course the scripture says in every trial
[28:42] God will make a way out so we have that
[28:44] confidence proverbs 14 27 is the next
[28:49] one the fear of the Lord is a fountain
[28:52] of life so this goes with the one from
[28:55] chapter 9 about the tree of life so not
[28:59] only is the fear Lord a tree of life I'm
[29:02] sorry
[29:03] wisdom is a tree of life pardon me but
[29:06] the fear of the Lord is a fountain of
[29:08] life well that that just kind of struck
[29:10] me right there if the fear of the Lord
[29:12] is the fountain that fountain flows to
[29:14] the tree which the tree would be wisdom
[29:16] I like that that's a good thought by the
[29:19] grace of Lord so the fear of the Lord is
[29:21] the fountain of life which that would
[29:24] flow to the Tree of Life and that gives
[29:25] us imagery of Revelation chapter 22 how
[29:28] the the fountain the rivers run out of
[29:30] the Tree of Life so beautiful I praise
[29:32] the Lord God given us some fresh
[29:35] revelation there amen in other words
[29:38] though obedience or fear of the Lord
[29:41] departing from evil brings life and so
[29:45] that's what we know whenever we obey God
[29:46] Jesus said those who obey are those who
[29:49] me so praise the Lord for that I like
[29:55] proverbs 1516 this is just a an
[29:58] encouraging scripture for all of us
[29:59] better is little with the fear of the
[30:02] Lord than great treasure in trouble
[30:05] therewith so you have this promise
[30:10] you're always in a better spiritual spot
[30:14] in the fear of the Lord you're always in
[30:17] a better spot your life will always be
[30:20] better than in a life of disobedience or
[30:24] a life that doesn't respect God or
[30:28] doesn't honor God so we want to be very
[30:31] thankful for that that God comforts us
[30:33] and lets us know that our life is better
[30:36] off when we fear the Lord has to be
[30:40] proper is 15 verse 33 the fear of the
[30:46] Lord is the instruction of wisdom and
[30:50] before honor is humility so not only is
[30:55] the fear of the Lord guide you and start
[30:56] you on your way to journey on your
[30:59] journey to wisdom but as actually
[31:01] instructs you in wisdom so it keeps
[31:03] driving you and guiding you to wisdom
[31:06] that's a beautiful scripture proverbs 16
[31:11] verse 6 by mercy and truth and Nic witty
[31:13] is purged and by the fear of the Lord
[31:15] men depart from evil so again this is
[31:18] the third time we've seen that the fear
[31:21] of God the love and honor and respect
[31:23] for God the adoration for God will cause
[31:25] us to shun evil proverbs 19 23 we're
[31:31] almost done here by God's grace the fear
[31:34] of the Lord
[31:34] tendeth to life and he that hath it
[31:37] shall abide satisfied he shall not be
[31:41] visited with evil this is a beautiful
[31:45] scripture there's three great thoughts
[31:47] in here the fear of the Lord will lead
[31:49] to life no doubt eternal life and in
[31:52] many cases longer life if you have the
[31:57] fear Lord you're satisfied with life
[32:00] which is a great testimony that's a
[32:02] great virtue that
[32:03] we need to have is just being satisfied
[32:05] with life just because we respect God we
[32:08] know God's in control and then he shall
[32:13] not be visited with evil this may be a
[32:15] probability scripture again because we
[32:17] know Jobe had evil happened to him or
[32:19] you could look at it spiritually
[32:22] spiritually nothing evil can happen to
[32:24] us especially if our soul has been
[32:27] sealed unto the day of redemption Satan
[32:29] can't get into our soul so there's a
[32:31] couple ways you could look at that by
[32:33] the grace of the Lord all right so I
[32:41] lost my spot here okay proverbs 22 for
[32:48] by humility and the fear of the Lord are
[32:51] riches honor and life again so this is a
[32:55] scripture about probability or it could
[32:57] be a spiritual truth because those who
[33:02] fear God are not always rich they're not
[33:06] always given honor or long life but
[33:11] spiritually those who are humble and
[33:12] fear the Lord no doubt have spiritual
[33:15] riches like Jesus talked about in the
[33:18] labor scene church age honor no doubt
[33:21] from God and then eternal life so this
[33:24] can be looked at naturally as probable
[33:26] but then spiritually as absolutely true
[33:32] proverbs 23 17
[33:36] let's not thine heart and be sinners but
[33:39] be thou in the fear of the Lord all the
[33:41] day long
[33:43] so this is just an encouraging Scripture
[33:45] we've got to keep this up all day long
[33:47] we've got to honor God fear God depart
[33:50] from evil all day long and that is I'm
[33:53] sure you're burdened I'm sure that's my
[33:55] burden as well we got to keep this going
[33:57] all day every day and we can do it by
[34:00] the grace of the Lord now proverbs 24 21
[34:08] says my son fear thou the Lord and the
[34:11] king and meddle not with them that are
[34:15] given to charge
[34:16] so this is about respecting those in
[34:18] authority and so this shows were to fear
[34:21] God and the king so this is what brother
[34:23] Ram taught a lot in the message respects
[34:25] he said when you respect God
[34:28] I'll show when you fear God then you
[34:29] have respect for other people so in
[34:32] other words if we start with fear for
[34:33] God it will naturally flow out to
[34:35] everybody else
[34:37] and so that's a beautiful promise there
[34:40] by the grace of the Lord and like this
[34:42] last one proverbs 31:30 this is I'll
[34:45] probably preach on the next time when we
[34:49] look at the proverbs 31 woman says favor
[34:53] is deceitful and beauty is vain but a
[34:55] woman that fear the Lord she shall be
[34:58] praised so at the very end of this poem
[35:02] about this valuable gifted woman here we
[35:09] know as the proverbs 31 woman it all
[35:12] boils down to the fact that she feared
[35:15] the Lord and will actually see there's
[35:18] two things that really amount to her
[35:21] success number one is she feared the
[35:23] Lord second she did her husband good all
[35:28] the days of his life so a woman really
[35:32] has those two main motivations in her
[35:36] life and if she can do that if she can
[35:38] fear the Lord first a subpoena of wisdom
[35:41] and then do good to her husband all the
[35:42] days of her life she'll be praised so
[35:47] God will honor her no doubt her family
[35:49] will honor her should probably see the
[35:51] honor on this side but without a doubt
[35:53] she'll receive honor on the other side
[36:00] well let me bring this down to a close
[36:02] here they bring it down to close by the
[36:04] grace of the Lord that's most of this
[36:10] they're about the fear of the Lord in
[36:12] Proverbs now recall Ecclesiastes 12
[36:15] verse 13 and 14 let us hear the
[36:17] conclusion of the whole matter fear God
[36:20] and keep his commands for this is the
[36:23] whole duty of man for God shall bring
[36:25] every work into judgment with every
[36:27] secret thing whether it be good or
[36:30] whether it be evil so the conclusion of
[36:35] Solomon's searching in the cleese EOS
[36:38] T's is that men should fear the Lord
[36:40] that's the whole conclusion and I just
[36:44] want to say as I studied the scriptures
[36:46] and listen to the message respects from
[36:48] brother Branham I believe the fear of
[36:50] the Lord is still the whole conclusion
[36:53] of the matter so let me give a few New
[36:57] Testament examples to prove that the
[37:00] thief on the cross the one that was
[37:01] saved looked at the thief thief who is
[37:04] cursing Jesus and said don't you fear
[37:08] God so that means the saved thief did
[37:12] fear God and was saved so this shows the
[37:17] importance of the fear of the Lord it is
[37:20] still the conclusion of the matter
[37:21] instead of blaspheming God in the day of
[37:24] our judgment or when we should humble
[37:26] ourselves and realize that God is
[37:29] innocent God is holy God is just and we
[37:32] should fear the Lord so there's an
[37:34] example of the thief being saved because
[37:38] he feared God he feared Christ Ephesians
[37:47] 5:21 submit to one another in the fear
[37:49] of God so that's that's what we need
[37:52] today in the church our church every
[37:54] church needs that instead of fusses in
[37:57] the church we should just submit to one
[38:00] another because we fear God because we
[38:03] honor God respect God and then we should
[38:05] humble ourselves in the Fellowship of
[38:08] the saints 2nd corinthians 7 verse 1 we
[38:12] should perfect holiness in the fear of
[38:14] the Lord so that's a
[38:18] see a work of continual sanctification
[38:19] what is our our motivation behind
[38:23] perfecting holiness and being cleansed
[38:25] from all filthiness the motivation is
[38:28] the fear of the Lord we honor God we
[38:30] respect God you want to please the Lord
[38:34] I think I'll just jump to the last one
[38:39] rod I got two more in Revelation 14 6
[38:43] through 7 the angel with the everlasting
[38:45] gospel said to fear God and give Him
[38:48] glory right before the mark of the beast
[38:50] is laid down now there's different
[38:53] thoughts about this angel I think
[38:54] brother Branham said it was Martin
[38:55] Luther but we know along with other
[39:00] scriptures
[39:01] scriptures the fear that God is so
[39:02] important so it's the last call before
[39:07] the mark of the beast and says fear God
[39:10] give him glory so when we fear God we'll
[39:14] more freely worship the Lord and give
[39:16] him praise with our lips and course in
[39:18] church service and everything on the
[39:22] last one I thought this is what was
[39:23] really powerful yesterday when I was
[39:25] listening to respects 1961 from brother
[39:28] Branham brother Ram says this he says
[39:34] and that because God is God he deserves
[39:37] respect that's right and he we've got to
[39:40] respect him and give a fear to him and
[39:43] that brings respect God has demanded
[39:46] that for himself and for all the
[39:48] servants God demands respects for his
[39:50] servants he is servants how we know that
[39:53] there are servants because he vindicates
[39:54] these servants by his word he takes
[39:57] these servants and makes them servants
[39:59] of God and proves that they are servants
[40:01] by making his word work through them
[40:03] servants then as you respect that
[40:06] servant you respect God so when I
[40:09] respect you and you respect me we
[40:12] respect each other then we're respecting
[40:14] God here's what he ties the scripture
[40:17] into respecting God and his servants the
[40:20] RAM says in paragraph 54 respects did
[40:23] not Jesus say in so much as you have
[40:26] done unto the least of these my little
[40:28] ones you have done it unto me
[40:32] so that just really struck my heart of
[40:36] course that's from Matthew 25 verse 40
[40:40] where Jesus grants eternal life to the
[40:43] foolish virgin these people who were
[40:45] surprised to be saved and brother
[40:47] Branham said that because they had
[40:49] respects because they had the fear of
[40:51] God and respects God granted them
[40:54] eternal life and that's powerful because
[40:57] that ties in again with the thief on the
[40:59] cross he feared God God saved him and
[41:02] here at the white throne judgment God
[41:04] saves the foolish virgin that are as
[41:07] sheep on his right hand side because
[41:11] they feared God and because they feared
[41:13] God they did good to jesus's brethren
[41:16] although they didn't realize those were
[41:18] Jesus's brethren or they didn't realize
[41:22] it was Jesus in them that's necessarily
[41:25] so brother Graham said it was respects
[41:28] that caused these ones that are saved to
[41:31] do good to the least of Jesus's brother
[41:34] so I think I'll stop right there by the
[41:36] grace of the Lord and trust that was a
[41:39] blessing to you it was a real blessing
[41:42] to me and I'll just close in prayer and
[41:44] ask God to help us depart from evil and
[41:46] walk in the fear of the Lord all the
[41:48] days of our life father God and heaven
[41:51] we thank you Lord for your mercy and
[41:52] grace we just thank you for this
[41:53] scripture thank you that the fear of the
[41:55] Lord is a fountain Lord and it flows
[41:57] into this tree of life this wisdom that
[42:00] gives it life Lord God help us Lord each
[42:03] and every day to depart from evil lord
[42:05] help us Lord God to fear you god help us
[42:09] to cry out for understanding help us to
[42:11] seek you as silver and gold and then
[42:14] we'll understand the fear of the Lord
[42:16] the Father bless your people tonight
[42:18] Lord thank you for their patience lure
[42:20] with the Bible study and not having
[42:22] church on Sunday and today physically

[42:29] we be a tentative to your voice may we
[42:30] spend more time with you Lord to
[42:32] understand your fear and to gain your
[42:34] wisdom we love you Lord Jesus in
[42:37] Christ's name we pray amen
[42:38] god bless you just email me or text me
[42:41] if you have any questions about the fear
[42:43] of the Lord my lord bless you I
[42:44] wonderful night
