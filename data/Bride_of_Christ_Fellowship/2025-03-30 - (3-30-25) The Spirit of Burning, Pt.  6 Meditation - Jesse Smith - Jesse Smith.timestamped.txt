[0:00] there preach a little bit further I
[0:01] wasn't planning on that I was planning
[0:03] on doing a a different example of the
[0:05] spirit of burning but as I studied this
[0:07] morning just something opened up in a
[0:08] simple way and uh so I'm going to preach
[0:11] on uh the spirit of burning and our our
[0:14] subtopic will be meditation by God's
[0:21] grace Psalm 39 verse3
[0:43] so I preached Psalm 39 on Wednesday and
[0:45] I was at home getting ready for bed I
[0:47] was listening to brother Simon's sermon
[0:48] and Simon was preaching out of Psalm 392
[0:50] so I just like when I get a second
[0:52] witness sometimes it's nice to to get
[0:54] that by the grace of
[0:56] God Psalm 39 of course A Psalm of David
[1:01] seems to be that he wrote this while uh
[1:04] being chased down by his
[1:09] father-in-law let's read verse
[1:12] three we'll read that on three one two
[1:14] three my heart was hot within me while I
[1:18] was musing the fire burned then spake I
[1:22] with my tongue amen may God add his
[1:25] Blessing to the reading of Thy word you
[1:26] can be seated
[1:31] so as I thought further on this uh story
[1:34] here of David I I like to change you
[1:36] know what I what I kind of classify this
[1:39] as David had the spirit of burning to
[1:41] meditate on his service so I want to
[1:43] just shorten to that there's so much
[1:46] power in meditation that's kind of the
[1:47] thought that opened up again this
[1:48] morning as I was just studying um so
[1:53] Isaiah had the burning to put him into
[1:55] service Jeremiah had the burning to keep
[1:58] him in service keep him from quitting
[2:00] Copus and his friend had the burning to
[2:03] uh dissolve the doubt about their
[2:04] service and David had the burning to
[2:07] meditate on his service Hallelujah and
[2:10] we look how important this is you know
[2:13] um Psalm 39 you know I looked at some of
[2:15] the commentaries and uh this is a
[2:18] powerful chapter that even Jews and
[2:20] Christians have used over the years when
[2:22] you're going through times of mour and
[2:24] you're reflecting On Life's uh the the
[2:28] the fleetness how how life is fleeting
[2:31] the the quick movement of Life how many
[2:33] are surprised by how fast time moves I
[2:36] am constantly even a teenager can say
[2:38] Amen uh let alone grandfather or father
[2:42] mother Hallelujah but life is so
[2:45] fleeting and you know Believers down
[2:47] through the years have gone to this
[2:48] chapter to get encouragement when life
[2:51] seems like it's moving so fast or uh
[2:55] they're going through times of mourning
[2:57] because David was mourning here as we we
[2:59] saw he was crying out to God and he felt
[3:02] God's face and judgment was upon him
[3:04] because of the wrong things he said
[3:07] right he said some things he should not
[3:08] have said and uh he really made a vow
[3:11] really at the beginning of the chapter
[3:13] to watch what comes out of his mouth
[3:15] praise God and I'm sure we've all been
[3:17] there where we've said things we wish we
[3:18] wouldn't have
[3:20] said but we've got to live with our
[3:22] mistakes we've got to cry out to God and
[3:25] and then do better the next time by
[3:27] keeping a bridal Upon Our mou mouth
[3:30] praise God so David learned this a man
[3:33] after God's Own Heart could say things
[3:35] that he regretted he was ashamed of and
[3:38] that God was chastening him for it's as
[3:41] if God's face was so close to him
[3:43] judging him as you should not have said
[3:45] that kind of reminds us of how he
[3:47] numbered the people right and he just
[3:49] did wrong and he repented and all those
[3:52] thousands of people uh lost their lives
[3:55] of course that would that their own sin
[3:57] played into that but God just allowed
[3:59] David to make his mistake at the same
[4:01] time as they were God doesn't punish
[4:03] other people for other people's mistakes
[4:06] God is faithful Hallelujah but here this
[4:08] chapter is a uh it's a a chapter of
[4:11] meditation on how our life our human
[4:14] strength is so weak at times and yet
[4:17] despite that God's power is Sovereign in
[4:19] our lives we're so weak but we must
[4:22] remember God is strong hallelujah
[4:25] hallelujah that's what this chapter is
[4:27] about it gives Timeless wisdom
[4:30] about how we should humble ourselves
[4:32] repent and the importance of putting our
[4:35] hope in God because everything of this
[4:37] world the hope of it will fade away
[4:40] Hallelujah and the only thing you're
[4:42] going to take with you is your character
[4:46] hallelujah it's a beautiful chapter as
[4:50] we read verse
[4:51] three see his heart got hot when he was
[4:54] meditating on God now Church we're going
[4:57] to get there in just a moment but
[4:58] meditation is one of the hard things in
[5:00] this day remember it's prophesied it's
[5:03] thus sayith the Lord this is the day of
[5:05] greatest deception because Paul wrote it
[5:07] he said evil seducers will wax worse and
[5:09] worse so we have to be very careful the
[5:11] people around us that they're not
[5:13] seducing us into a a state of deception
[5:16] and especially happens at churches where
[5:18] they get seduced that everything's okay
[5:21] and everything's all right but we we
[5:24] know the Holy Spirit if we sin we know
[5:25] the holy spirit's going to chasen us and
[5:27] correct us hallelujah so what I mean is
[5:30] we can't let uh we can't let ourselves
[5:32] be deceived if we have sin in our lives
[5:33] it's got to be cleaned out praise God or
[5:36] we can never move on with
[5:38] God right we can't be seduced in
[5:40] thinking everything's okay if there's
[5:42] sin laying in our lives that hasn't been
[5:44] repented of Hallelujah that's the day
[5:47] that's the that's the temptation of the
[5:49] the deception of this day right uh
[5:52] they're rich and increase with Goods
[5:54] have need of nothing but Jesus said you
[5:55] need some eyes out so you can clearly
[5:57] see the spirit of judgment on your life
[5:59] amen you can clearly judge your own life
[6:01] is my life pleasing to God right
[6:04] now that's what we want to know praise
[6:06] God now I love this uh as as he's
[6:09] meditating what happens once the fire of
[6:11] God starts burning in his heart what
[6:13] happens verse four he says Lord make me
[6:16] to know mine end and the measure of my
[6:20] days what it is that I might know how
[6:23] frail I
[6:24] am so the Holy Ghost Came Upon David and
[6:27] he said God I want to know how it's all
[6:29] going to end now with him it ended in
[6:31] peace right he was buried in the city of
[6:33] David and named after him and that's how
[6:36] his end was it was in peace he had
[6:38] established Solomon right Solomon was
[6:40] established ordain key his life ended in
[6:43] peace it didn't end by the hands of Saul
[6:46] although he thought it was remember we
[6:47] taught that the Bible said the the Bible
[6:50] said he thought in his heart Saul is
[6:52] going to destroy
[6:53] me but see God showed him that's not
[6:56] going to be your end I have Grace for
[6:58] you how many want Grace for the end of
[6:59] your life
[7:00] praise God I want Grace as well
[7:01] Hallelujah and David got Grace because
[7:03] he was a man after God's Own Heart
[7:07] Hallelujah and he said make me to know
[7:09] the measure of my days how long do I
[7:11] have
[7:12] Lord how long do I have help me to see
[7:16] how weak and frail I
[7:18] am help me to know that I might feel
[7:20] right strong right now I'm I'm 18 years
[7:24] old I'm 26 or 27 right is it 27 brother
[7:27] 27 27 28 okay sorry brother Mercy how
[7:31] old are you 27 amen these young young
[7:34] Brothers Hallelujah enjoy it but even in
[7:39] my whatever age I am help me to know how
[7:41] frail and how short life is because it's
[7:44] not going to last forever remember the
[7:46] Bible said it's like grass that grows up
[7:48] we're we're starting to see the grass
[7:49] come up right now but we just saw how it
[7:51] all withered away last November December
[7:55] withered away till it's brown dark brown
[7:57] then light brown and then then die
[7:59] breaks off and new life has to come
[8:02] forth help us to see the end of our days
[8:06] this is what this church this is what
[8:07] the Holy Ghost will move you to meditate
[8:09] upon how much time do I have left Oh
[8:11] Glory remember when brother R was
[8:13] leaning on his bed like this and he went
[8:14] beyond the curtain of time what was he
[8:16] meditating on oh there it is brother
[8:17] Jose he said Lord I'm 56 years old and I
[8:21] haven't I'm sorry I'm 50 and I haven't
[8:22] done anything for you yet and the church
[8:26] said he's already won a million Souls
[8:29] and he's just meditating sleeping on his
[8:30] bed Lord I haven't done anything for you
[8:33] and then he says he starts seeing his
[8:34] theophany separate from his physical
[8:36] body and he looked down and see it and
[8:39] what does the voice say keep pressing
[8:42] the reward is great for you Hallelujah
[8:45] Divine love is the only thing that'll
[8:47] get you there hallelujah amen I I didn't
[8:50] catch that till right now praise God
[8:51] Amen see meditating what how much time
[8:54] do I have left in my life what what can
[8:56] I do with the rest of my life how can I
[9:00] serve God in a way that would please him
[9:03] despite Church despite our
[9:05] weaknesses despite our human fra
[9:08] frailties and
[9:10] failures how can I give God the rest of
[9:13] my life Hallelujah and I say this with
[9:16] my honesty of all honesty of my heart it
[9:18] has been the privilege of my life to
[9:21] preach the gospel these 21 years by
[9:23] God's grace if I could go back brother
[9:26] uh brother Chris I would go back and I'd
[9:28] start preaching sooner if I had the
[9:30] choice because there I know the world
[9:33] can never satisfy us we'll never be
[9:36] truly happy the Bible says there's no
[9:39] peace to the
[9:40] wicked no matter how they present it
[9:43] with their red red carpets and all their
[9:45] extravagant uh events and everything and
[9:48] all their medals that they hold and
[9:49] trophies it's all vanity
[9:52] Hallelujah and there's only peace to
[9:55] those who are in Christ Jesus
[9:57] hallelujah it's the privilege of my life
[9:59] to crack open my bible every morning or
[10:01] get on my knees and say God bless this
[10:03] day I don't know how it's going to turn
[10:05] out I don't know what you have in store
[10:07] but help me today hallelujah amen you're
[10:10] my only hope Hallelujah that's what
[10:12] David says you're my only
[10:15] hope he says you made my days in verse
[10:18] five as a hand breath mine age is as
[10:20] nothing before thee verily every man at
[10:23] his best state is altogether
[10:26] vanity surely every man walketh in a
[10:29] vain show we had a Bible study with a
[10:30] couple middle middle schoolers on
[10:32] Thursday and I showed them the verse
[10:33] there in Ecclesiastes chapter 2 where
[10:35] David said I gave myself uh all the
[10:38] permission to build everything I'm sorry
[10:40] Solomon I gave all my permission to
[10:42] build everything to get everything uh to
[10:44] give myself to even even to humor to
[10:47] women uh to riches i g I gave myself
[10:50] license to do everything and he said it
[10:52] all turned out to be
[10:54] vanity and how does a man who's
[10:57] regretted his whole life how does he end
[10:59] his life he ends it with Ecclesiastes
[11:02] chapter 12 and said to keep the fear of
[11:04] the Lord fear God and keep his
[11:07] Commandments for everything we do will
[11:09] come under the Judgment of God
[11:11] hallelujah but remember he'll forgive
[11:13] our mistakes right because there's no
[11:15] condemnation to them that are in Christ
[11:17] Jesus the only word he's going to give
[11:19] us and judge us is going to say Well
[11:21] done brother
[11:22] Nia good and faithful servant just be
[11:25] good amen just be good to people
[11:27] hallelujah amen just be faithful to
[11:30] Christ
[11:32] Hallelujah and this is what God offers a
[11:36] man who will just meditate he'll take
[11:38] time off to meditate and say Lord how
[11:39] much longer do I have I've only got a
[11:41] few more years or how much time do I
[11:44] have I'm frail I'm weak I feel like I
[11:47] can't do it anybody ever feel like that
[11:48] I can't do it by myself I got to have
[11:50] help
[11:52] Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost
[11:54] burned on David's
[11:57] heart verse 7 and now Lord what wait I
[12:01] for what am I waiting
[12:03] for I'm waiting for thee Hallelujah my
[12:07] hope is in thee God is going to have to
[12:10] make a way in the midst of My Crazy Life
[12:14] in the midst of the uncertainty of my
[12:15] life the only hope I have is if God
[12:17] steps in and he makes a way where there
[12:20] seems to be no way amen I I have no
[12:23] hope I see I'm weak I'm frail I can't do
[12:27] it by myself I failed so many times they
[12:29] said David said I could have said the
[12:30] wrong thing so many times I have no hope
[12:33] except God comes and helps me to tame my
[12:35] tongue or to to tame whatever desires or
[12:38] passions I struggle with throughout the
[12:39] day throughout the weeks throughout the
[12:41] years throughout the decades whatever I
[12:43] struggle with my only hope is Jesus
[12:48] Christ deliver me from all my amen
[12:52] Deliver Me From
[12:53] Myself
[12:55] Hallelujah Deliver Me From Myself he
[12:57] didn't even say enemies in this in this
[12:59] scripture Deliver Me From Myself make me
[13:02] not the reproach of the
[13:05] foolish and of course the rebukes in
[13:07] verse 10 remove remove thy stroke so see
[13:09] God was spanking him God was uh God was
[13:13] chastening him training him rebuking him
[13:17] take the rebuke away I'm consumed by the
[13:19] blow of thine hand I feel like I've had
[13:21] enough I feel like I've suffered enough
[13:23] for my mistakes God let uh let the
[13:25] mercies come new in the morning give me
[13:28] a fresh start for for your mercies are
[13:29] new Every Morning how many know Joy
[13:32] comes in the morning praise
[13:34] God and church this is a
[13:36] song it's actually a prayer in verse 12
[13:39] as well hear my prayer oh Lord and give
[13:40] ear unto my cry hold not thy peace and
[13:42] my tears so he was crying he was so
[13:45] concerned about how am I going to make
[13:46] it through he was crying
[13:48] Hallelujah and what's the Bible say God
[13:51] is nigh God is close to all those who
[13:54] are of a broken heart and a contrite
[13:57] spirit when you're crying when you're
[13:59] really sincere with God that's when
[14:01] God's near praise
[14:02] God he's not going to come near to the
[14:04] people say thank God I'm not like the
[14:06] Baptist thank God I'm not like the
[14:08] Lutheran thank God I'm like that message
[14:09] church thank God I'm not like that
[14:10] message church he comes to those who see
[14:12] their own Frailty and realize their only
[14:15] hope is in yielding to the Holy
[14:18] Spirit remember the Bible said it's not
[14:20] wise to judge oneself by other
[14:22] people right Paul said that in
[14:24] Corinthians we preach on that recently
[14:26] well kind of recently
[14:29] and so David gives us
[14:31] this uh testimony that whenever we stop
[14:34] to meditate on God's word it'll start to
[14:36] burn in our hearts that's why sitting
[14:38] down or maybe it's for you whatever is
[14:40] laying down however you read your Bible
[14:42] and talk to the Lord and then just stop
[14:44] and meditate however you do that the
[14:47] spirit of God will come on you and
[14:49] you'll feel his peace in that moment
[14:51] you'll feel his power you'll feel his
[14:53] burning sensation Hallelujah burning out
[14:56] all your worries Hallelujah burning out
[14:58] all your your cares
[15:00] Hallelujah burning that out and saying
[15:03] Lord I'm frail you're my only hope I
[15:05] need your help today amen
[15:09] amen and church if a man after God's Own
[15:12] Heart meditated on what's remaining of
[15:15] his
[15:16] service we should we should too do the
[15:19] same right we too should do the same
[15:21] because we claim to be a bride after the
[15:23] heart of Christ Our husband our
[15:25] spiritual husband the Lord Jesus Christ
[15:28] and remember the Bible says in 2
[15:29] Corinthians 11 1-4 that we're to be a
[15:32] Chase virgin to Christ and they were the
[15:35] Corinthians were when they F when you
[15:37] first get saved and and you're forgiven
[15:39] you're clean as clean can be the word
[15:41] Chase means pure from
[15:44] carnality it means Immaculate ah clean
[15:49] you ever walk into a store and like
[15:50] you're like it's Immaculate in here you
[15:52] ever anybody ever heard that that's why
[15:54] I like going to the Apple Store you know
[15:56] it's Immaculate in here they just or you
[15:59] know Target or wherever you go you know
[16:01] if they keep it clean that's how you are
[16:04] before Christ Hallelujah but see then
[16:06] the enemy fights you with mind battles
[16:08] and we fall short but remember church as
[16:10] soon as we confess our sins he makes us
[16:12] Immaculate again
[16:14] Hallelujah immaculately clean praise God
[16:17] because what is this context about it's
[16:19] about losing mind battles let's go there
[16:22] Second Corinthians 11 because she was uh
[16:25] deceived in her mind so complexes
[16:29] mind Battle 2 Corinthians
[16:35] 11 I'm going to finish verse two I've
[16:38] espoused you to one husband Church you
[16:39] are engaged to Jesus Christ what a
[16:43] privilege Hallelujah you're engaged to
[16:46] the Son of God the king of Heaven
[16:49] Hallelujah the king of the Millennium
[16:51] the king of kings and Lord of lords
[16:54] that's who you're engaged to praise God
[16:57] I know a lot of you were excited when
[16:58] you got engaged the natural but we ought
[16:59] to be a lot more excited for our
[17:01] spiritual engagement praise God
[17:04] hallelujah it's eternal
[17:06] life he says verse three but I fear lest
[17:09] by any means as a serpent beg guiled Eve
[17:12] Temptation deceived through his
[17:15] subtility so your mind should be
[17:16] corrupted from the Simplicity that's in
[17:19] Christ see always keep it simple always
[17:21] keep your Christian walk simple before
[17:23] God right what what was Eve just don't
[17:26] touch it right that that was all Eve had
[17:28] to say or learn don't touch the fruit
[17:31] it's so simple but the deception got in
[17:34] there well you can touch it surely you
[17:35] won't die and you know God knows when
[17:38] you do it you know it'll be a different
[17:39] than what it's actually been said
[17:40] there's a different consequence to what
[17:42] you've been told no church sin it will
[17:44] always lead to
[17:46] death Hallelujah sin will always lead to
[17:50] death so see this is how we keep our
[17:53] spiritual cleanliness this is how we
[17:56] remain spiritually immaculate
[17:59] Hallelujah keep your mind on the
[18:02] Simplicity that's in Christ I love the
[18:04] seven Thunders I love the Seven Seals we
[18:06] know those are deep Hallelujah we know
[18:09] Revelation 10 is deep my wife and I were
[18:11] talking about this that this week
[18:12] there's a lot of scriptures that are
[18:14] pretty deep and there's times we'll go
[18:16] into those praise God but don't lose the
[18:18] fact that the gospel is a simple gospel
[18:21] the good news is simple praise God Jesus
[18:24] Christ died to save Sinners of whom you
[18:27] and I feel like we're the chief of them
[18:29] Hallelujah and then if he died to save
[18:31] us then we're saved praise God and we
[18:34] must keep our sins confessed Hallelujah
[18:37] and keep Jesus Christ as our only
[18:42] hope the word meditate in Webster's
[18:45] Dictionary means to engage in
[18:47] contemplation or
[18:49] reflection so reflect is of course to go
[18:51] back and think about what happened so
[18:54] when you stop to reflect on what
[18:57] happened what happened in my life that's
[19:00] a state of meditation
[19:04] reflection it also means to engage in
[19:06] mental exercise such as uh
[19:09] concentrating for the purpose of
[19:11] reaching a heightened level of spiritual
[19:12] awareness now the world perverts it with
[19:14] yoga and all this positive reinforcement
[19:17] I can speak this I can speak that I can
[19:19] speak that they can't speak nothing
[19:20] except deception praise God nothing but
[19:22] lies I should say they can only speak
[19:24] lies and deception Satan might give them
[19:26] you know Satan gave uh Satan could have
[19:29] gave Jesus all the kingdoms right he can
[19:31] give Satan can reward people praise God
[19:33] they can speak that into existence but
[19:35] it only leads to
[19:36] death but there is truth in the fact
[19:39] that we should meditate on the word of
[19:42] God and raise our spiritual
[19:44] condition if you read your Bible this
[19:46] morning it should have if you prayed
[19:48] this morning if you meditated this
[19:49] morning it should have raised your
[19:50] spiritual condition or maybe did it last
[19:53] night any time you spend with God it's
[19:56] supposed to give you a heightened
[19:57] spirituality so then you can walk away
[20:00] close the book walk away and be ready to
[20:02] take on life's uh challenges or maybe
[20:05] the joys of Life how many enjoy the the
[20:07] good seasons of life it's not all
[20:08] challenges it's not all briers
[20:11] hallelujah it's not all thorns we're to
[20:14] enjoy the good moments as well praise
[20:16] God but approach them with a spiritual
[20:20] mindset so Sinners pervert meditation
[20:23] but Christians are battled by Satan
[20:27] Satan tries to keep us from
[20:30] meditating Satan tries to keep us from
[20:33] meditation uh a third definition of
[20:35] meditation means to focus one's thoughts
[20:38] on to reflect and ponder over I do that
[20:42] often while I'm driving I'm it's been
[20:44] said too you do it while you're in the
[20:45] shower you know when you're just doing
[20:46] like just walking when you're just doing
[20:48] like regular mundane things it might be
[20:50] at work you know if you just got mundane
[20:51] tasks at work you know you can just do
[20:53] something quickly and while you're just
[20:55] doing this kind of uh monotonous work
[20:57] you start meditating see God can come to
[20:59] you wherever you are praise God as
[21:01] Samson pushed that uh uh that grinder as
[21:05] Samson went around the circle grinding
[21:07] again and again he just got down to
[21:08] meditate that was a time for him to
[21:10] meditate I meditate while I'm washing
[21:12] dishes like last night that's a good
[21:14] time of meditation I love I love those
[21:16] moments although I hate washing dishes I
[21:19] hate
[21:20] washing or you might say I hate laundry
[21:23] right we do but the fact is if we can
[21:27] get into some of that and but then bring
[21:29] Christ into it it'll it'll make it a lot
[21:31] better by God's grace I'm not saying
[21:32] make it fun not washing dishes is never
[21:35] going to be
[21:38] fun but I also often find that's a great
[21:41] time to
[21:42] meditate just I got brother brandom
[21:44] singing there you know I put that's my
[21:45] Saturday night routine just put on
[21:46] brother brandom and wash the dishes and
[21:48] think about all the joys of Christian
[21:50] Life and just a great time to
[21:53] meditate the fourth definition uh
[21:56] meditate means to plan or project in
[21:58] your mind to so make a a purpose make an
[22:01] intention I intend to do this tomorrow
[22:03] how many times we leave church and say
[22:05] I'm GNA I intend to do this tomorrow
[22:07] that's a good thing that means you
[22:08] reflected at church now may God help you
[22:11] to carry it out better praise God
[22:14] hallelujah so that's that's what
[22:15] meditation is you have an intent I've
[22:18] thought about the past and I'm intending
[22:21] now to do this so see how meditation
[22:24] should be an important part of every
[22:25] church service Hallelujah we should stop
[22:28] now of course there's going to be times
[22:29] we meditate more than others right we go
[22:32] through in difficult trials as as David
[22:34] was we're going through in times of uh
[22:38] testing Hallelujah when we go through
[22:40] times of Trials we're going to spend a
[22:42] little more time meditating during those
[22:45] times now church as you know there is a
[22:47] difference between prayer and meditation
[22:50] prayer is you talking right or God
[22:53] talking to you which you know for us
[22:55] it's not as much as maybe a prophet of
[22:58] course of course but prayer is when
[23:00] you're thanking God the Bible says that
[23:02] uh we give thanks we get when we praise
[23:05] God when we express praise or
[23:07] Thanksgiving or we make requests as
[23:09] Philippians 4 said make your requests
[23:11] knowto God oh God provide the need oh
[23:14] God forgive me oh God help me here next
[23:16] week oh God minister to that
[23:19] individual that's prayer Hallelujah when
[23:22] you're when you're offering praise
[23:25] confessing your sin giving thanks making
[23:27] requests in to God but remember prayer
[23:29] can be silent too can you pull 1st
[23:31] Samuel
[23:33] 11113 remember Eli thought Hannah was
[23:35] drunk because she was just praying
[23:37] silently and her just lips were
[23:39] moving now Hannah she spake in her heart
[23:42] so see there's times there there's times
[23:45] where we say God listen to my
[23:47] heart listen to my
[23:50] heart only her lips move but her voice
[23:52] was not heard therefore Eli thought
[23:54] she'd been drunk and she was drunk with
[23:56] the Holy Ghost praise God Hallelujah
[23:59] that's right just so just so removed
[24:02] from the natural thing she was just
[24:04] praising God P the Bible said she poured
[24:06] out her soul unto
[24:08] God now meditation knows different
[24:11] meditation is where you're thinking
[24:13] you're reflecting you're pondering about
[24:15] the past or making intentions for the
[24:18] future you know I got spring break
[24:20] coming up this week I got I'm doing a
[24:21] lot of meditation about what I can
[24:22] accomplish you this week a lot of
[24:25] plans now only half of them will
[24:27] probably come to pass
[24:29] but that's an example of you're just
[24:31] thinking deeply and
[24:33] reflecting on something to come now the
[24:37] world will tell you empty your mind
[24:39] right that's what uh some of these
[24:40] religions will tell you empty your mind
[24:42] and and the meditation with Christians
[24:44] is exactly opposite fill your
[24:46] mind with what God has done in the past
[24:49] hallelujah amen fill your mind with what
[24:52] God has already done and what God can do
[24:55] praise God what he may do
[24:59] or even what he has promised to do for
[25:00] example he's promised to never leave you
[25:02] nor forsake you he's promised no weapon
[25:06] that's formed against you shall prosper
[25:09] that's a promise
[25:13] Hallelujah so meditation is actually
[25:15] filling your mind with what God has done
[25:18] what God is doing and what God is going
[25:20] to do praise
[25:22] God most of us don't engage in this as
[25:26] much as we ought to
[25:30] and of course there's overlap how many
[25:31] ever had that in overlap you'll be
[25:33] praying and pretty then and then after
[25:35] you might pause and just think about oh
[25:36] I remember that I remember that that's
[25:38] that's a combination of prayer and
[25:40] meditation so just to kind of give us uh
[25:43] a little a little differentiation
[25:45] between prayer and meditation they
[25:47] should go together
[25:49] Hallelujah they should take
[25:53] place now why do we need it because
[25:55] there's so many things going on in our
[25:57] lives the Bible said in the last times
[26:01] it'll be Troublesome times there's so
[26:03] many troubles in the world there's so
[26:05] many cares there's so many things we
[26:07] care about because we have to have them
[26:09] to live
[26:11] physically right so we need to stop
[26:15] sometimes from uh well we need to stop
[26:17] every day I would say and meditate on
[26:20] the word of God because there's troubles
[26:22] that bring us
[26:23] fear right what does trouble make us
[26:25] feel usually fear h
[26:29] and things that we just can't control
[26:34] Hallelujah sometimes we all I mean
[26:37] uh sometimes we hear about people that
[26:39] are uh not I want to say the right word
[26:42] not a control but something else uh
[26:46] someone who just needs a lot of control
[26:48] I I don't like to use that word f re a k
[26:51] i don't like to use that so much
[26:52] especially not in the house of God but
[26:54] some people who just have they want to
[26:56] have so much control and church God
[26:57] allows us to have some control over our
[26:59] lives but there's so much he doesn't
[27:02] allow us to have control over and so in
[27:04] those moments we need to meditate on God
[27:08] and ask God to help us to Hope in
[27:11] him so we need meditation David needed
[27:14] meditation because he ran things were
[27:16] uncertain his life for years he had all
[27:18] these promises you're going to be king
[27:20] someday you're going to be great and
[27:21] you're going to do all these things and
[27:22] your uh your lineage is going to bring
[27:24] forth the Messiah and he's like how am I
[27:25] even going to survive everything around
[27:27] him was telling him it didn't look very
[27:29] good oh but he's only looking with the
[27:31] natural eyes may God give us spiritual
[27:33] eyesight Hallelujah like B said faith is
[27:37] uh faith is a long-term Vision when you
[27:40] when you're Anointed with faith you see
[27:41] a far ways off and you know God's going
[27:43] to bring me around this Hallelujah like
[27:46] that song set your wings uh set your
[27:48] wings to The Winds of Faith right God
[27:51] God will either uh he either take you
[27:53] through the mountain or around the
[27:54] mountain or over the mountain God's
[27:56] going to bring you through your trial
[27:57] praise God God that's right so we need
[28:00] meditation in our lives and we saw
[28:03] that's when David got the hope of God
[28:06] when he was meditating on the Frailty of
[28:08] his
[28:09] life now if you have your Bibles let's
[28:12] look at there's only church there's only
[28:13] 20 verses that say the word meditation
[28:15] so I was pleasantly surprised this
[28:17] morning we're not going to hit all of
[28:18] them um but I just want you to observe a
[28:21] few important things about the verses on
[28:24] meditation we're not going to go there
[28:26] but in Genesis 2463
[28:28] the first time meditation is mentioned
[28:30] is when the prophet
[28:32] Isaac he goes out to meditate in the
[28:35] field at night time so think about this
[28:38] this is how a prophet ended his day he
[28:40] didn't want to end the day with all the
[28:42] fear about what could happen oh when is
[28:45] my wife going to come oh what when is my
[28:48] dad GNA pass away all these things he
[28:49] could have been wondering right his mom
[28:50] had already passed away he didn't want
[28:52] to end the day with fear in his house so
[28:55] he took a walk in nature and the church
[28:57] said amen he went for a walk at night
[29:00] time now you might go running in the
[29:02] morning that might be or walking in the
[29:04] morning whatever you do like I I met a
[29:06] pastor this weekend he's a trinitarian
[29:07] guy he likes to go running in the
[29:09] morning to clear his mind that's good I
[29:11] like
[29:12] that but the prophet Isaac and I say
[29:15] Prophet because he prophesied numerous
[29:17] things in the scripture he was
[29:19] definitely a prophet Abraham Isaac Jacob
[29:21] Jacob was a prophet as well they had
[29:23] Visions dreams God spoke thus sayith the
[29:25] Lord to them and it happened but he ends
[29:28] his day he closes out his day by
[29:31] spending some time in
[29:33] nature and then meditating just on the
[29:35] things of God at the evening time and
[29:38] when did Rebecca appear at the evening
[29:40] time what are we living in we're living
[29:42] in the spiritual end time it's a type of
[29:44] the Rapture
[29:46] Hallelujah so how does a Godly Man how
[29:49] does a Godly Prophet end the day he goes
[29:51] out in nature and
[29:53] meditates thinks about God now we all
[29:56] need help with that CU all I can think
[29:58] think about is just hitting the bed at
[29:59] the end of the day so I I need some help
[30:01] in my
[30:03] life but that's why we do Bible time at
[30:06] the end of the day so we can try to get
[30:07] our minds meditating on the things of
[30:09] the
[30:09] Lord so the very first example we have
[30:12] is a prophet who's waiting for his bride
[30:14] now that Isaac who does he type Jesus
[30:16] Christ right so we get this idea uh of
[30:19] the Lord Jesus is waiting for us
[30:21] hallelujah and it's she's going the
[30:23] bride's going to come he's going to
[30:24] Rapture her at just the right time
[30:26] praise God Jesus p Jesus always thinks
[30:29] good thoughts right remember Jeremiah 29
[30:31] for I know the thoughts that I think
[30:33] toward you thoughts of Peace thoughts of
[30:36] goodness and not of evil to give you an
[30:39] expected
[30:40] end I appreciate those amens
[30:44] Hallelujah the second example is
[30:47] Joshua in Joshua 1 ver8 you know
[30:50] Joshua's like Lord Moses is dead the
[30:52] prophet's gone how do I get Victory he
[30:55] said meditate on the word of God day and
[30:57] night
[30:59] amen that and I told the brother like I
[31:01] told that Pastor we went over to a
[31:03] pastor's house a trinitarian pastor uh
[31:05] Thursday night and that's why his name
[31:07] is Joshua I said you got a great name
[31:09] brother Joshua that's and that's the
[31:11] only time God ever used the word success
[31:12] in the whole Bible was Joshua if you
[31:15] meditate on the word of God and you keep
[31:16] the commands you'll be a good success
[31:18] how many want to be a success Hallelujah
[31:20] that's what David was wondering how many
[31:22] years do I got left I'm a frail man
[31:24] what's my end going to be like what uh
[31:26] uh if it comes to my fure funeral how's
[31:28] it all going to end what's it all going
[31:29] to be
[31:31] like
[31:34] Hallelujah am I going to know that I was
[31:36] a successful preacher or Pastor are you
[31:39] going to know your successful mother or
[31:40] father or
[31:43] individual we all want to know am I
[31:45] going to be successful and God has the
[31:47] answer yes because you'll meditate on
[31:49] the word of God am you got to you and I
[31:53] have got to keep the word on our
[31:56] minds Hallelujah and keep it on our
[32:00] minds all throughout the day
[32:03] Hallelujah so look look at look at these
[32:05] names so far look at these names of men
[32:07] who had to
[32:09] meditate
[32:10] Isaac the promised son type of Jesus
[32:13] Christ Joshua the greatest military
[32:16] General in the whole Bible other than
[32:18] the Lord because he was following the
[32:20] the Lord of hosts the Lord Jesus Christ
[32:24] and then church the major writer guess
[32:26] who's the major writer meditation David
[32:30] a type of
[32:32] Christ so look at the men here that God
[32:34] uses to be those who which men would
[32:37] take time to go and
[32:39] meditate
[32:40] Isaac Moses I'm sorry
[32:43] Joshua David men that we know we know
[32:47] they're some of the greatest in the Hall
[32:49] of Fame of Faith Hallelujah that's
[32:52] right so the first time David mentions
[32:55] meditation of course is Psalm chapter 1
[32:57] if you have your Bible let's go go to
[32:58] Psalms we're going to just spend some
[32:59] time in Psalms here I'm only 30 minutes
[33:01] into my message and I might have an hour
[33:03] left we'll kind of see how that goes
[33:05] we'll see Psalm chapter 1 very
[33:08] familiar as it ought to
[33:11] be verse one blessed is the man that
[33:14] walketh not in the counsel of the
[33:15] ungodly don't let people don't let
[33:17] people give you the wrong counsel and
[33:19] don't take their counsel take the word
[33:20] of
[33:22] God nor standeth in the way of Sinners
[33:25] nor sth in the seat of the scornful
[33:28] see don't don't don't make fun don't
[33:30] don't don't look at people with scorn
[33:31] look on them with
[33:33] Grace Hallelujah don't scorn people
[33:35] don't look down on them feel compassion
[33:37] for them I know it's hard church I know
[33:38] we've had a lot of bad politicians these
[33:40] last few years but I've had to battle
[33:41] scorn for them but I got to look at them
[33:44] with
[33:48] compassion verse two but his Delight so
[33:51] what is the Delight of the blessed man
[33:53] or the Blessed woman their Delight is in
[33:56] the law of the Lord I just love the word
[34:00] I just love the
[34:01] word and I got to share my testimony
[34:03] with that uh uh trinitarian pastor and
[34:07] it was just nice it was nice to reflect
[34:09] okay I was meditating that's right I
[34:11] just said I said I got saved to the
[34:12] chapel but then when my brother brought
[34:14] the message I told him I said I just
[34:15] fell in love with the word I just
[34:17] couldn't get enough I just wanted to and
[34:20] brother John and I John Graham uh we
[34:22] love the word so much brother bang we we
[34:24] asked brother Craig brother Craig can we
[34:25] take a copy of your notebook he had
[34:27] notebook with all his Bible studies can
[34:29] we make a copy of that I just want to go
[34:30] we going to go copy at the copy machine
[34:32] and so we did we copied his notes so we
[34:35] could just flip through and like oh
[34:38] this it's like treasure after treasure
[34:41] after
[34:42] treasure now we want to have that same
[34:45] love right now that we had back then and
[34:47] see how the enemy is trying to get us
[34:49] away from that you don't got to say Amen
[34:52] because you you're probably saying
[34:53] ouch but see how Satan tries to rob us
[34:56] of our first love
[34:58] just the Delight oh such a delight to
[35:00] hear the word of God Satan tries to make
[35:03] other things look so much more
[35:04] interesting or so maybe this will help
[35:06] me what's going to help you is
[35:08] meditating on the word of God that's the
[35:11] only thing that's going to help you and
[35:13] me I'm talking about
[35:15] myself is that we hope in the Lord and
[35:19] this was all brought about by what the
[35:20] spirit of
[35:21] burning the spirit burning inside of him
[35:24] saying oh God help me forgive me this
[35:27] all came about as he
[35:30] meditated and he realized the importance
[35:32] of remembering God remembering what he's
[35:35] done and then meditating on what he's
[35:37] going to
[35:39] do
[35:44] Hallelujah I think of how our church
[35:45] started you know in the in the homes
[35:47] there in John Graham's home and my home
[35:48] and then that first rental place we had
[35:50] where the ceiling fell through and if
[35:53] you would have told me uh that one day
[35:55] we'd be in a place like this I would
[35:56] have shouted and danced and scream
[35:57] dreamed all around the house praise God
[36:00] CU this is such a nice place compared to
[36:02] where we
[36:03] were you know just thinking about
[36:05] meditating God's going to do great God's
[36:07] going to take care of it eventually
[36:08] praise God I can trust God with my
[36:12] future and like the Bible says godliness
[36:14] with contentment is great gain help me
[36:17] to be content while I'm hoping in you
[36:19] Lord God whatever the current condition
[36:21] is help me to trust in
[36:26] God so David said this is how a blessed
[36:28] man is he meditates in the word of God
[36:32] day and and in his law doth he meditate
[36:34] day and night so see you got to start
[36:37] your day with Christ you got to end your
[36:39] day with Christ meditating on the things
[36:41] of
[36:44] God I mean I've known numerous people
[36:46] that go to bed listening to music or go
[36:48] to bed listening to brother Brenham and
[36:50] that's always been a great help to them
[36:53] Hallelujah so however if if there's ever
[36:55] any change you need to make in your life
[36:57] let's get our advice right here from the
[36:59] scripture from a man who knew how to
[37:01] meditate on God David said I'm doing it
[37:04] day and
[37:07] night and what shall he be like what's a
[37:09] blessed man like he's like a tree
[37:11] planted by the rivers of water that
[37:13] bringeth forth his fruit in his season
[37:15] his Leaf also doth not wither and
[37:17] whatsoever he doeth shall
[37:19] prosper now notice he's always got the
[37:21] fruits the fruits in his or her life
[37:23] they're always available for people to
[37:25] take and enjoy
[37:28] I'm going to go back to Thursday night
[37:29] with that uh trinitarian Pastor it was
[37:31] nice I got into an unexpected debate on
[37:33] the godhead and boy I was happy brother
[37:35] van I was like oh this is what I was
[37:37] born for Hallelujah I was like ask me
[37:39] bro ask
[37:41] me but you know what we got we got to
[37:43] the spot where he said well I believe
[37:44] you're a heretic now if I didn't have
[37:45] the fruits of the spirit I might have
[37:46] got from the table and I've never done
[37:47] this but slam the table and say honey
[37:49] let's go get the kids we're out of
[37:51] here he called me a heretic and I just
[37:54] smiled and said well yeah yeah that's
[37:55] fine I understand that I've been called
[37:56] a heretic a lot and I personally believe
[37:58] that all trinitarians are Heretics but I
[38:00] I believe you can be
[38:02] saved see I had some fruit out there
[38:04] that he could enjoy the the sweetness
[38:06] and the kindness of the Holy Spirit not
[38:08] getting upset well you don't believe it
[38:10] the way I do you're just a blind
[38:12] leosan organization
[38:14] denominational Jezebel
[38:17] whatever no God's people always have
[38:20] fruit that's hanging there that people
[38:21] can
[38:23] enjoy now is there a time to be mad yes
[38:25] Jesus shows us that but said that's
[38:27] actually the Pastor when Jesus took the
[38:28] cord brother R said that's the pastor
[38:30] cleaning out the
[38:31] church so I got a license to be mad
[38:34] sometimes and church so do you the Bible
[38:36] said be angry and sin not and the church
[38:39] said there's a time to be angry and that
[38:42] that can be a fruit of the Holy Spirit
[38:43] hating sin right that's a good fruit of
[38:45] the Holy Spirit hatred for sin that's
[38:47] the fear of the Lord reverence for God
[38:50] but also we want to have such fruits
[38:52] where if people you know condemn us or
[38:53] rebuke us right to our face we can just
[38:55] smile said next question please
[38:59] Hallelujah and then the brother said or
[39:01] the preacher said he woke up the next
[39:03] morning at 4:15 a.m. thinking about me

[44:46] redeemer
[44:47] Hallelujah so he said help me to
[44:49] meditate on the things of God so so
[44:51] often we meditate on all the problems
[44:53] that might
[44:55] happen right so often we meditate even
[44:58] this week church I was woken up and uh
[45:01] all this fear came on me what was it um
[45:03] and I just had to lay there and just ask
[45:05] God to help me not to fear I forget what
[45:07] it was and it was just totally I didn't
[45:09] even expect it I just woke up and and
[45:12] all this fear came on me I just had to
[45:14] wait it out until I could get through it
[45:16] it like just like an attack something
[45:18] like I was going to lose everything you
[45:19] know just one of those feelings just
[45:21] comes on me at times and it hasn't
[45:23] always been this
[45:24] way hasn't always been this way I feel
[45:27] like I've been attacked by the spirit of
[45:28] fear so often these last few years but
[45:30] I've got to battle it I've got to
[45:32] overcome it and I've got to choose to
[45:34] meditate on what God's word says and not
[45:36] the fears of the
[45:38] future I think there's a song fears not
[45:41] my future if I'm not
[45:42] mistaken Psalm 49:3 Psalm
[45:51] 49:3 my mouth shall speak of wisdom and
[45:54] the meditation of my heart shall be of
[45:56] understanding understanding so in other
[45:57] words I'll meditate on the things that I
[46:00] understand see church if we don't
[46:03] meditate on what we understand then it
[46:04] might lead us to our imaginations to get
[46:06] some to imagine something bad going to
[46:09] happen what do I understand about God
[46:12] focus on what focus on that what do we
[46:14] understand about God's
[46:16] character that's what we need to
[46:18] meditate
[46:19] on and church we're going to have a few
[46:22] minutes of meditation at the end of the
[46:23] service okay so just prepare yourself I
[46:26] want everybody to be quiet I want you to
[46:27] Bow your head or what you can stand and
[46:29] raise your hands whatever you want to do
[46:30] but take a we're going to take a few
[46:32] minutes and just meditate on what God
[46:34] has
[46:36] done because if you haven't done it yet
[46:38] today you're missing
[46:39] out you're missing out on the peace that
[46:42] passes all understanding I don't want to
[46:44] miss out on
[46:46] that and that's how you become blessed
[46:49] right blessed is the man who does what
[46:51] meditates on the word of God
[46:59] verse 15 in uh chapter 49 but God will
[47:03] redeem my soul from the power of the
[47:04] Grave for he shall receive
[47:08] me so this was his meditation you know
[47:10] David could list all his problems I've
[47:12] got this problem that problem that
[47:13] problem if I talk to each of you I could
[47:15] say what how's it going you could tell
[47:16] me well this is a problem that's a
[47:18] problem I don't see how that's going to
[47:18] work
[47:20] out and David lists all his problems in
[47:23] some of these chapters but then he ends
[47:24] by saying but God is my hope praise God
[47:29] but God will redeem my
[47:31] soul I might lose everything I might
[47:34] lose my watch and I might lose my nice
[47:36] shoes or I might lose my glasses you
[47:38] might you might lose everything in life
[47:40] but as long as you don't lose your soul
[47:42] Hallelujah that's the most important
[47:47] thing commit your life into the keeper
[47:50] of your
[47:51] soul don't give your soul over to Satan
[47:54] or the pleasures of the world commit
[47:56] your soul unto Jesus
[47:59] Christ
[48:00] Hallelujah Psalm
[48:05] 63 look at the beginning a Psalm of
[48:08] David when he was in the wilderness of
[48:10] Judah this is not a time when it's a
[48:11] good time of life this is a time of uh
[48:15] cap or I'm sorry running from captivity
[48:16] this is a time of running from the law
[48:18] we'd say and he wasn't even
[48:20] guilty this is a time of
[48:23] distress verse one oh God Thou Art my
[48:26] God early will I seek thee my soul
[48:28] thirst is for thee my flesh longth for
[48:30] thee in a dry and thirsty land where no
[48:33] water is so see when you're on the run
[48:36] when you're going through distress
[48:38] that's when you'll really thirst for
[48:40] God right brother man preached that
[48:42] sermon called desperation was right
[48:43] after the token in
[48:45] 63 go uh brother B says it's human
[48:47] nature not to want to be in desperation
[48:49] nobody wants to be desperate so but we
[48:51] got to recognize when God brings us to
[48:53] that moment that's when we got to seek
[48:55] after God
[48:57] amen but said it's against human nature
[48:59] to get desperate unless there unless
[49:00] there are situations that bring you to
[49:03] desperation but he said when God brings
[49:05] that to you call upon God like
[49:12] David Hallelujah to see thy power and
[49:15] thy Glory as he's running from Saul so
[49:18] as I have seen thee in thy Sanctuary
[49:20] because thy loving kindness is better
[49:22] than life he's calling God this loving
[49:25] you're so lovingly kind while he's
[49:27] running from a
[49:29] murderer Hallelujah in other words the
[49:31] loving kind God allowed me to get in
[49:34] this awful situation that I think's
[49:36] awful must not be that awful if the
[49:39] loving kindness of God allowed me to get
[49:41] into it this guy's a murder he killed
[49:43] the priests he's a murderer he killed 80
[49:46] people were innocent and now he's after
[49:48] me and he can still say God help us he
[49:51] can still say God you are so loving and
[49:53] kind your loving kindness is better than
[49:56] my life life because I'm about to lose
[49:58] my life now that's what he thought of
[50:01] course God rescued him but can we say
[50:04] that when we go through difficult times
[50:06] can we stop for a moment and say Lord uh
[50:08] things look awful they look Bleak they
[50:09] look uh tragic but your loving kindness
[50:13] is better than my entire life in other
[50:16] words if I live or die you're still the
[50:18] same loving God you're still kind to me
[50:22] you've been good to me that's one thing
[50:24] I know God has been good to me I don't
[50:27] deserve it you you don't deserve it
[50:29] either we don't deserve it but God has
[50:31] been loving to
[50:33] us so
[50:37] kind So Unworthy but his Mercy has
[50:39] extended to
[50:42] us because your loving kindness is
[50:45] better than life my lips shall praise
[50:49] thee Hallelujah I like verse eight my

[52:58] I'll just share it now I remember the
[53:00] works of the Lord I'll surely remember
[53:03] the wonders of old so brother bang I
[53:04] told the testimony of your dad being
[53:06] healed down there in Junction City
[53:08] because I felt it tied
[53:10] in I felt God healed brother vang's dad
[53:13] in order to Grant him a a season of his
[53:15] life to have a changed heart because
[53:17] that's what they testified of God
[53:19] changed his heart in that
[53:21] season and then he went home and I said
[53:26] I said said that was that was a
[53:28] supernatural move of
[53:30] God and I said and then then I applied
[53:33] it to the man who had just had his life
[53:34] taken from him in front of his
[53:36] children I said this was his time to go
[53:39] but two years before this he repented
[53:42] and I baptize him in the name of the
[53:43] Lord Jesus Christ and he went through
[53:46] two difficult years but the last three
[53:47] months of his life starting in January a
[53:49] new friend came into his
[53:51] life and started giving him hope
[53:54] teaching him the
[53:55] scripture and and and his last text the
[53:58] night before he passed away was he was
[53:59] so excited about what God was going to
[54:01] do in his life uh he felt he was in the
[54:04] perfect will of
[54:06] God and this is something to
[54:09] remember if you love God and if you're
[54:11] chosen before the foundation World God
[54:13] will work it out so you'll be ready to
[54:15] go meet him when it's your time and he's
[54:17] gracious enough to extend your time if
[54:20] you're not ready when it's your
[54:22] time
[54:24] Hallelujah that's how great God is he
[54:27] did it with that woman who drown
[54:28] remember the young mother drown when
[54:29] brother said you owe me an understanding
[54:32] brother B said I shouldn't have said
[54:33] that he said God let me pout it out for
[54:35] three or four months pouted out like a
[54:38] baby God wouldn't answer me god didn't
[54:40] give me any Visions did God didn't get
[54:42] any any dreams so I went to the mother
[54:45] of that yeah I went to the mother of
[54:46] that young mother and she said oh that's
[54:48] right last year she almost drowned at a
[54:50] family function and her husband saved
[54:53] her and then between then between then
[54:56] in the time she actually passed away in
[54:57] the hospital she gave her heart to the
[54:59] Lord and was baptized by brother
[55:02] brandham and then brother BR said oh
[55:04] foolish how foolish I can be how foolish
[55:07] all of us can
[55:09] be but I'll remember what God has
[55:12] done I remember how God of old has been
[55:15] gracious and that he is
[55:18] God even in the midst of tragedy even in
[55:22] the midst of being chased down by a
[55:24] murderer like happened to David and like
[55:27] happened a couple weeks
[55:29] ago even in the midst of that you can
[55:31] see the grace of
[55:34] God that's what we need to meditate upon
[55:36] that God is
[55:42] God Psalm 10433 Psalm
[55:51] 10433 I will sing unto the Lord as long
[55:53] as I live see that's what that's that
[55:55] that's my plan that's brother Austin's
[55:57] plan he's going to keep singing keep
[55:59] making those songs here right Haven

[56:21] meditate on the
[56:23] Lord should be a sweet time oh God

[56:51] pouty uh complaining message believer
[56:54] I'm going to be glad believer I'm going
[56:56] be thankful for what God has done for
[57:00] me I'm sure that's how you want to be as
[57:04] well earlier in the
[57:07] chapter David rehearsed how Lord you
[57:09] sent the you you sent the waters for the
[57:12] Beast the fowl and the
[57:15] cattle and so the David knew if he's
[57:17] done that if he provides for all the
[57:19] beasts out there all the birds we all
[57:21] see those starlings think about that
[57:22] those huge swarms of Starlings God
[57:25] provides enough food for every single
[57:27] one of those
[57:30] starlings you you you would think those
[57:32] a starling like that all that group that
[57:34] would that would just ravish all these
[57:35] fields no there's plenty God has plenty
[57:38] to go around and the church said God's
[57:40] got plenty for you and I if we just
[57:43] trust
[57:44] him we have to trust almighty
[57:47] God he's
[57:49] God so he talks about this and then he
[57:52] says that then I'm going to meditate my
[57:54] meditation of him is going going to be
[58:01] sweet hallelujah how many know God is
[58:03] trustworthy
[58:05] amen Psalm
[58:09] 119 there are six mentions of meditation
[58:13] in Psalm 119 it is the longest chapter
[58:16] in the
[58:18] Bible so let's read
[58:23] those I'm about at an hour here so we're
[58:26] doing okay by God's
[58:28] grace Psalm
[58:34] 119:12 blessed art thou oh Lord teach me
[58:37] thy statutes with my lips have I
[58:40] declared all the judgments of thy mouth
[58:42] I have rejoice in the way of thy
[58:44] testimonies as much as in all riches I
[58:46] love the sermons as much as I appreciate
[58:49] the finances you gave me now I wonder
[58:51] how many can say
[58:53] that Hallelujah
[58:56] I enjoy the word as much as all the
[59:00] financial blessings God gives
[59:02] us I will meditate in thy precepts and
[59:05] have respect unto thy ways I will
[59:09] Delight myself in thy statutes I will
[59:12] not forget God's
[59:15] word I won't forget it as long as I live

[59:21] Bible that I've been working on for over

[59:33] just going back in I'm like oh that's
[59:35] right I forgot about that the Keys of
[59:36] the Kingdom and oh I forgot about that
[59:38] verse and it is so refreshing to just
[59:41] remember what I've already
[59:43] forgotten to I'll say it's so refreshing
[59:46] to remember the Revelation I've
[59:49] forgotten but we still have the promise
[59:51] no matter how much I forget brother
[59:52] Chris I've got the promise the Gates of
[59:55] Hell cannot prevail against my
[59:56] Revelation because it's not mine it's
[59:59] Christ's Revelation that he gave to
[1:00:02] us there is such a consolation there's
[1:00:05] such a refreshment oh that's right
[1:00:07] Nephilim and no man has ever seen God I
[1:00:09] use that this week with my trinitarian
[1:00:15] brother oh Psalm 119 oh I left lost my
[1:00:18] spot there let's go to verse uh
[1:00:21] 23 Psalm 11923 there's my
[1:00:24] hour Prince
[1:00:26] also did sit and speak against me but
[1:00:28] thy servant did meditate on thy statutes
[1:00:33] so when people speak evil about you just
[1:00:35] meditate on the word God will take care
[1:00:37] of it Hallelujah now I was thinking
[1:00:40] about that this week you know my some of
[1:00:42] the my hardest battles in the message

[1:00:46] coming against
[1:00:47] me other people they have you know huge
[1:00:50] financial trials other people have
[1:00:53] health issues big- time health issues

[1:00:57] issues uh some people violence like
[1:01:00] overseas
[1:01:01] Africa uh Congo we talked about that I
[1:01:05] mean some people have different battles
[1:01:07] I just thought well my this has been my
[1:01:08] battle that I've my main battle that
[1:01:10] I've had to fight over the years but
[1:01:12] church we don't get to choose our
[1:01:13] battles brother Ram says whatever God
[1:01:15] commits you to God commits you to some
[1:01:18] type of a certain battle so friends
[1:01:20] let's overcome by God's
[1:01:23] grace there's one thing I know that will
[1:01:25] help us all overcome from the love of
[1:01:26] God
[1:01:28] Amen right it's thus sayith the Lord we
[1:01:31] got to have Divine love if we want to
[1:01:32] make it over to the paradise of
[1:01:36] godah said God May commit you to death
[1:01:38] like John the Baptist uh God May commit
[1:01:41] you to suffering like St Paul where his
[1:01:42] eyes you know he couldn't see and then
[1:01:45] martyrdom he said whatever God commits
[1:01:47] you to it's God's prerogative It's God's
[1:01:49] purpose
[1:01:51] Hallelujah but the proof that God loves
[1:01:53] us is because he said so
[1:02:01] verse sorry 48
[1:02:12] 1948 I want to get my spot I know you're
[1:02:14] there hun I appreciate that Psalm
[1:02:17] 11948 I want to get back
[1:02:21] there okay
[1:02:29] my hands also will I lift up unto thy
[1:02:31] Commandments which I have loved and I
[1:02:34] will meditate in thy statutes first of
[1:02:37] all when was the last time some of us
[1:02:38] raised our hands because of the word was
[1:02:40] so
[1:02:42] good so that's on us we've got to lift
[1:02:45] our hands to God
[1:02:47] hallelujah and I will
[1:02:50] meditate see what you got to you have to
[1:02:52] open your heart and let God show you his
[1:02:53] word and then you'll fall in love with
[1:02:55] it Hallelujah and then when you fall in
[1:02:57] love with God's word it's easy to raise
[1:02:58] your
[1:03:00] hands
[1:03:01] hallelujah praise God glory to
[1:03:06] God 119 verse
[1:03:11] 78 here we see that the proud do not
[1:03:14] meditate on God's
[1:03:15] word let the proud be ashamed for they
[1:03:18] dealt perversely With Me Without a Cause
[1:03:21] but I will meditate in thy precepts see
[1:03:25] when people miss use you they pervert
[1:03:27] their ways before you the pr those are
[1:03:30] the proud
[1:03:31] people even when they mistreat you I'm
[1:03:33] still going to choose to meditate on God
[1:03:36] so see it's the greatest battle ever
[1:03:38] fought the Battle of your mind the
[1:03:39] Battle of your meditation I could say
[1:03:41] like that that's the greatest battle
[1:03:44] what will you meditate on what will you
[1:03:46] focus
[1:03:47] on David focused on God's word that's
[1:03:51] what's going to help us
[1:03:54] overcome verse
[1:03:57] 97 oh how I love thy law it is my
[1:04:00] meditation all the day what are you
[1:04:03] meditating about all day cyber
[1:04:05] trucks a joke
[1:04:11] Chipotle see we got to we got to
[1:04:13] recognize I we have to meditate on the
[1:04:15] word of God if something has come into
[1:04:17] our lives we have to recognize if we
[1:04:19] don't love the word something's come
[1:04:20] into our lives actually brother man
[1:04:22] calls it Idol if you love anything or
[1:04:24] meditate on anything more than God's
[1:04:26] word it is an
[1:04:28] idol the Bible says flee from
[1:04:32] idolatry run from
[1:04:35] it that's verse
[1:04:41] 97 yeah verse 98 uh thou through thy
[1:04:45] Commandments Hast made me wiser than my
[1:04:47] enemies not a pride but not to make us
[1:04:49] prideful for they are ever with me so
[1:04:51] his enemies are always surrounded him
[1:04:53] verse 99 I have more understanding than
[1:04:56] all my teachers for thy testimonies are
[1:04:58] my meditation think of that David David
[1:05:00] was wiser than all of his teachers
[1:05:02] because he just focused on the word of
[1:05:04] God that means sometimes teachers don't
[1:05:05] focus on the word of
[1:05:07] God but church if you focus on the word
[1:05:10] of God you'll be wiser than your
[1:05:12] teachers
[1:05:15] Hallelujah you know just like at school
[1:05:17] they'll try to teach you well it's okay
[1:05:18] for a a man to marry a man or a woman to
[1:05:21] marry a woman like they say no I'm Wiser
[1:05:23] than my teacher that's right right you
[1:05:25] guys are probably experienced that
[1:05:27] you're a lot wiser Hallelujah because
[1:05:29] you've heard the word of
[1:05:33] God verse oh did I read
[1:05:39] 99 yeah all the day meditate all the Day
[1:05:43] psalm 147 I'm sorry it's chapter 119
[1:05:46] verse 147 same chapter I prevented the
[1:05:50] dawning of the morning now prevent is
[1:05:51] different than what it means today it
[1:05:52] means anticipate I anticipated the
[1:05:55] dawning of the morning and I cried I
[1:05:56] hoped in thy word oh God let something
[1:05:59] change this morning see the see the
[1:06:02] desperation God it's been an awful night
[1:06:04] it's been an awful day God made
[1:06:06] something change this morning in my
[1:06:09] life verse 148 my eyes prevent the night
[1:06:13] watches that I may meditate in thy word
[1:06:16] so so he's even looking forward to it my
[1:06:18] eyes anticipate I'm going have to be up
[1:06:20] watching all night or I've got a
[1:06:22] difficult night ahead of me that's okay
[1:06:23] I can choose to meditate on God's word
[1:06:25] all through the night
[1:06:29] Hallelujah see it all depends how you
[1:06:31] choose to invest your time in the midst
[1:06:33] of your trial are you going to invest it
[1:06:34] in meditating on the wrong thing or are
[1:06:36] we going to invest it I'm sorry invest
[1:06:38] it on meditating on the word of God when
[1:06:41] we go through
[1:06:42] trials that's our choice remember the
[1:06:45] pride of our hearts will CH will help us
[1:06:48] well I'm sorry the pride of our hearts
[1:06:49] will keep us from meditating it so if we
[1:06:51] humble ourselves we can meditate on the
[1:06:53] things of God
[1:06:57] Psalm uh okay that's the end of Psalm
[1:06:59] 119 those are all the verses there let's
[1:07:01] we're almost done here Psalm 143 verse 5
[1:07:04] chapter 143 verse
[1:07:17] 5 Psalm 143:5 I remember the days of old
[1:07:22] I meditate on all thy works all all the
[1:07:25] things he's done I Muse on the work of
[1:07:28] thy
[1:07:29] hands of course Muse is another word for
[1:07:32] meditate and Ponder
[1:07:36] consider so see how uh see how Isaac was
[1:07:39] fulfilling this he went out in nature
[1:07:41] and then he could he could see the hand
[1:07:43] of God he could experience God's love
[1:07:45] and mercy right he could see the
[1:07:47] creative power of God and he would just
[1:07:49] meditate on how great God is
[1:07:56] now Isaiah 33: uh 18 is a little
[1:08:00] difficult reading but let's read that
[1:08:02] it's the last time it's used in the New
[1:08:04] Testament as far as
[1:08:07] meditation Isaiah 33:18 I remember the
[1:08:10] oh
[1:08:11] sorry thank you thine heart shall
[1:08:14] meditate Terror where is the Scribe
[1:08:16] where is the receiver where is he that
[1:08:18] counted the towers this is actually a
[1:08:20] positive statement um the commentaries
[1:08:24] you know if you read the whole chapter
[1:08:26] this is basically saying you shall after
[1:08:29] this think of all the alarm and distress
[1:08:32] when the enemy destroyed the city saved
[1:08:34] the king shall reign in magnificence
[1:08:35] over all the nation this is Albert
[1:08:37] Barnes then enjoying peace and
[1:08:39] prosperity you shall recall the days of
[1:08:42] Terror and alarm and then sh and shall
[1:08:44] then ask with gratitude and astonishment
[1:08:46] where are they who cause this alarm
[1:08:49] Hallelujah so after you get after you
[1:08:52] get through a great trial you'll say why
[1:08:53] was I so afraid where's the person that
[1:08:55] brought all this trouble God has given
[1:08:57] me victory over my troubles
[1:08:59] Hallelujah and I'll meditate how did I
[1:09:01] get through that how what happened to my
[1:09:04] enemies God swept my enemies away praise
[1:09:06] God God swept all my problems away
[1:09:11] Hallelujah and I'll meditate on what God
[1:09:14] saved me from
[1:09:19] Hallelujah and there's twice in the
[1:09:21] whole new testament where the word
[1:09:22] meditation is used you probably remember
[1:09:23] this Luke 21:14
[1:09:26] and 1 Timothy 4:1
[1:09:29] 15 been an hour and 10 minutes so I
[1:09:31] will'll finish up here pretty
[1:09:43] soon how many enjoying the word today
[1:09:46] amen we're to love God's precepts I love
[1:09:49] the word I love the scriptures I love it
[1:09:53] because there's there's truth there
[1:09:55] hallelujah it's God's word I'm reminded
[1:09:58] of what God has done and I know he'll do
[1:10:01] something similar again because he's the
[1:10:03] same yesterday today and
[1:10:07] forever settle it therefore in your
[1:10:10] hearts not to meditate before what you
[1:10:12] shall answer this is when you get this
[1:10:13] is when Christians will be persecuted
[1:10:15] and thrown before judges and magistrates
[1:10:17] and this is this is quite a statement
[1:10:20] right because in my mind I want to get
[1:10:21] every everything for a debate I want to
[1:10:23] get it ready to go but Jesus says if
[1:10:25] you're going to be persecuted he said
[1:10:27] specifically don't meditate on that
[1:10:29] don't meditate on your answers just
[1:10:31] meditate on
[1:10:32] God don't meditate on what's going to
[1:10:35] win you the debate what's going to help
[1:10:37] don't meditate on that just keep your
[1:10:38] focus on how good God
[1:10:40] is church that's how it had to been
[1:10:43] isn't that how it had to been for
[1:10:44] Stephen to be able to say Lord hold this
[1:10:46] not to their charge think of that
[1:10:48] because the whole time he would have
[1:10:49] thought man these bunch of Sinners I'm
[1:10:51] his human mind could have thought uh
[1:10:53] they're going to be condemned to hell he
[1:10:55] didn't meditate on it he just let God
[1:10:58] let God give him that one chapter
[1:10:59] remember Acts chapter 7 is like one
[1:11:00] sermon of course he wasn't a preacher
[1:11:02] but it's one it starts out with Abraham
[1:11:03] goes all the way down to Solomon and
[1:11:05] then he says you're Circ you're
[1:11:06] uncircumcised of heart and ear and you
[1:11:08] resist the Holy Ghost then he said Lord
[1:11:11] lay it not to their charge there's no
[1:11:13] way he could have premeditated all
[1:11:15] that Jesus gave him the words to say at
[1:11:19] the right
[1:11:20] time in times when I've been accused or
[1:11:22] whatever more I don't meditate on what
[1:11:24] to say I just let and I you can't right
[1:11:26] you just wait on God and God will give
[1:11:28] you the words to say in that moment
[1:11:30] praise
[1:11:31] God
[1:11:34] hallelujah so when you go through a
[1:11:36] persecution you go when when you're
[1:11:37] placed before your enemies or anything
[1:11:39] like that remember the David said you
[1:11:41] made a table before me in the presence
[1:11:43] of my
[1:11:44] enemies there's going to be times you're
[1:11:45] sitting right across the table from an
[1:11:48] enemy and God ordained that
[1:11:51] table God brought you to that table so
[1:11:54] don't worry about about what you're
[1:11:55] going to say God will give you what to
[1:11:57] say at that time how many want Faith to
[1:12:00] trust in God Amen for when you're right
[1:12:03] before sitting right before your enemy
[1:12:06] God brought this together like Esther I
[1:12:07] always think of Esther a table with hmon
[1:12:10] she didn't have to meditate on what to
[1:12:12] say God gave her what to
[1:12:15] say and God will give you and I what to
[1:12:17] say in the presence of our
[1:12:22] enemies and the last one first
[1:12:26] Timothy
[1:12:28] 4:15 this is for preachers but as we saw
[1:12:31] with David it's really for everybody you
[1:12:34] can apply this to yourself as well
[1:12:37] because if you and I meditate on God's
[1:12:38] word all day we'll be blessed all day
[1:12:40] we'll have success in our lives
[1:12:42] spiritual
[1:12:46] success Paul tells uh Timothy the young
[1:12:49] Pastor meditate upon these things give
[1:12:52] thyself holy to them what reading
[1:12:54] preaching exhortation
[1:12:55] studying that thy profiting may appear
[1:12:58] to all we've all seen brother Brian's
[1:13:01] profiting have we
[1:13:02] not I hope sometime in your life you'll
[1:13:05] think well brother Jesse's growing in
[1:13:07] Grace yeah I could tell he studied and
[1:13:09] prayed or I can God really moved God
[1:13:11] really help me that's been my prayer
[1:13:14] that's what your prayer should be for
[1:13:15] your life too that people as you
[1:13:17] meditate on God people can see they just
[1:13:19] love the Lord so much it's it's so
[1:13:21] refreshing to be around brother so and
[1:13:23] so sister so and so so it's just great
[1:13:26] to be around them because they're
[1:13:28] meditating on the things of God and
[1:13:30] everybody can see they're growing like a
[1:13:31] real Christian should
[1:13:33] grow praise
[1:13:39] God Psalm 119 oh I'm sorry yeah let's go
[1:13:42] back to Psalm 119 I'm almost
[1:13:46] done yeah I'm not going to be able to
[1:13:48] get everything I have definitely have a
[1:13:49] part seven I have a whole another topic
[1:13:52] on the burning um
[1:13:55] Psalm 11959 now brother R preached
[1:13:58] numerous sermons on this I might even
[1:14:00] preach a little series on this as I I
[1:14:02] thought on my ways David said I thought
[1:14:05] of my ways and turn my feet unto thy
[1:14:07] testimony so again when you meditate and
[1:14:10] the spirit of God comes on you it'll
[1:14:12] give you the right direction to
[1:14:15] go see as I thought on as I'm pondered
[1:14:19] and meditated on my ways oh I've got to
[1:14:21] go this way my feet need to walk a
[1:14:23] different direction I've been walking
[1:14:25] the wrong way so now it's time to walk a
[1:14:28] different way how does that happen
[1:14:31] through
[1:14:32] meditation now sometimes God can give us
[1:14:34] a word from somebody but it's got to be
[1:14:35] real to you it's got to be real to me
[1:14:39] and it's real to us when we meditate on
[1:14:41] it and we realize okay this is what's
[1:14:42] happened now here's what needs to
[1:14:45] happen does everybody see that action
[1:14:48] comes after
[1:14:51] meditation so medit in meditation we
[1:14:53] have the spirit of judgment the spirit
[1:14:54] of burning and then action Hallelujah
[1:14:58] just like the a just like the the
[1:15:00] seraphim right they were in action right
[1:15:02] reverent uh the other
[1:15:05] one humble yes humble reverent in action
[1:15:08] so we see the same thing here action
[1:15:10] comes after we meditate the spirit of
[1:15:13] God Burns in our hearts gives us a a
[1:15:15] desire Holiness command to do the
[1:15:18] commands of God then we can step in a
[1:15:20] New
[1:15:23] Direction now look vers 60 I made haste
[1:15:26] and I delayed not to keep the commands
[1:15:30] and I gave that example when we were
[1:15:31] down there in Kentucky Malachi made it
[1:15:33] might have saw it one one young brother
[1:15:34] in particular came up confessed
[1:15:36] pornography but then he also confessed

[1:15:39] stolen thousands of dollars from my dad
[1:15:41] I said you go tell him right now after
[1:15:44] this sermon and he
[1:15:46] did he
[1:15:47] did and the next day I preached on
[1:15:49] Dancing he was the only one with me
[1:15:53] dancing well I guess the pastor danc for
[1:15:55] a little
[1:15:55] bit but see he had a joy now all the
[1:15:58] guilt all the shame was gone and the
[1:16:00] church said amen Church you don't have
[1:16:02] to carry the burdens you don't have to
[1:16:04] carry your burdens from the past you
[1:16:06] just confess them you'll feel brand new
[1:16:09] you'll feel the spirit of burning right
[1:16:11] but first recognize the spirit of
[1:16:13] judgment I stole from my dad or I stole
[1:16:15] and then confess it make haste do do the
[1:16:18] repentance quickly and then you'll your
[1:16:21] feet will walk in A New Path that
[1:16:22] brother danced all over the church and

[1:16:31] spirit of God does it'll make you act
[1:16:33] upon the word right now amen I want to
[1:16:36] keep the word now I don't want to put it
[1:16:37] off I want to do it now praise
[1:16:39] God because God's spirit is burning in
[1:16:41] my heart and life and I know what God's
[1:16:44] called me to
[1:16:45] do may God help us to know what to
[1:16:50] do last verse I read this uh this
[1:16:52] morning I finished Isaiah this morning
[1:16:54] Isa isia
[1:16:56] 661 what a book oh my goodness this is
[1:16:58] just a tremendous book so many promises
[1:17:01] Hallelujah there are Untold promises in
[1:17:04] Isaiah it's hard to
[1:17:08] explain Isaiah
[1:17:11] 66 the last
[1:17:14] chapter thus sayith the Lord verse one
[1:17:17] the heath the heaven is my Throne the
[1:17:18] Earth is my foot stol where is the house
[1:17:20] that ye build unto me and where is the
[1:17:23] place of my rest remember that
[1:17:27] uh God told that to
[1:17:29] Solomon and Steven also quoted that
[1:17:31] about
[1:17:32] Solomon really really where can God rest
[1:17:35] and you know where he can rest in your
[1:17:38] soul the god of Heaven who owns Heaven
[1:17:40] and Earth where does he want to rest he
[1:17:42] wants to rest in your
[1:17:43] soul that's where he wants to rest and
[1:17:46] that's what the Holy Ghost did on the
[1:17:48] day of Pentecost didn't the Bible say
[1:17:49] the fire did what what did it do it
[1:17:51] rested on each of them
[1:17:55] and I'll say this if you've got God's
[1:17:56] fire to rest then you ought to
[1:18:00] rest rest in the promises of
[1:18:07] God verse two for all those things hath
[1:18:12] mine hand made look at all these things
[1:18:14] God has made all the wood here all the
[1:18:18] fibers the metal God God's hand has made
[1:18:21] all these
[1:18:22] things have been sayeth the Lord but to
[1:18:25] this man will I look who's God looking
[1:18:27] to if God if God's foot stol is the
[1:18:30] earth God's Got His Feet God's got his
[1:18:33] feet all propped up there with the foot
[1:18:35] stol where's he looking at he's looking
[1:18:37] at these type of
[1:18:40] people even to this man that's poor and
[1:18:44] a contrite spirit sound like David in
[1:18:45] Psalm 93 I'm nothing I'm frail I'm weak
[1:18:48] who's God looking at the person who
[1:18:50] humbled
[1:18:53] himself and those who tremble at the
[1:18:55] word or they love the word so much
[1:18:58] they'll go obey it right
[1:19:00] now they don't put it off well I'll do
[1:19:02] it later when I this happens or that
[1:19:04] happens I'm going to obey God's word
