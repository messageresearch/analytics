[0:00] series. You know, I preach so hard on
[0:01] Sunday that I've had a sore throat and
[0:03] lost my voice uh all week. So, sometimes
[0:06] I do that. I get too excited. You know,
[0:08] I've noticed church too when we get
[0:10] newcomers uh sometimes newcomers like
[0:12] the sister was pulling really hard,
[0:14] right? So, the more people pull that
[0:17] seems like the more bold I get.
[0:20] And so, uh and then of course when the
[0:22] church is filled up, you got all these
[0:24] people pulling. And so, a lot of times
[0:26] that happens here. So, you can go ahead
[0:28] poll tonight here, but I'm going to try
[0:29] to watch the time by God's grace. Uh,
[0:33] whenever I do that, whenever I preach so
[0:35] loud, I just got to maybe do some
[0:36] teaching the next service to try to get
[0:38] my voice back by God's grace. 2
[0:40] Corinthians 5:1.
[0:43] Now, our title is the theophony body.
[0:45] Now, the word theophony is just a term
[0:47] that we use uh in religion or in
[0:50] Christianity. The actual Bible word is
[0:53] uh the celestial body. So we'll show
[0:55] that again here tonight. But uh the
[0:57] celestial body is the body that's
[0:59] waiting for us if we should die. If we
[1:01] should go to the the body should go to
[1:03] the the physical body would go to the
[1:04] grave. The theophony is the body that's
[1:06] waiting for us in heaven. It's a
[1:08] spiritual body. So 2 Corinthians 5 verse
[1:11] one.
[1:15] Let's read that if we can. Ready? One,
[1:17] two, three. For we know that if our
[1:19] earthly house of this tabernacle were
[1:22] dissolved, we have a building of God and
[1:26] house not made with hands eternal in the
[1:30] heavens. Amen. Let's have one more word
[1:31] of prayer. You have a need on your
[1:32] heart. Let's make an open unto God
[1:34] today. Father God, you see my hands up.
[1:36] Lord, I need you, Lord. As I said, Lord,
[1:38] sometimes I wear myself out. My zeal
[1:39] sometimes eats up my wisdom. And Lord,
[1:42] with a larger crowd and polling, Lord
[1:44] God, I just want to be uh yielded to
[1:46] you, Lord, tonight. I want to be mindful
[1:47] of the time, Lord. Uh so, Father, just
[1:50] take this moment, Lord God. I pray your
[1:52] spirit would just inspire each one of
[1:53] us, Lord. Help me to yield to your
[1:54] spirit. I just pray this will be a
[1:56] blessing and encouragement to others
[1:58] here. Let your word be more clear to us,
[2:00] Lord. Give us more revelation of your
[2:02] word. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name.
[2:04] And the saints said, "Amen." God bless
[2:06] you as you're being seated. Praise God.
[2:07] In case I got some slides here, I'm
[2:09] going to do a little review. Maybe I
[2:11] can't remember the last time I preached
[2:12] on the theophony. So, um I don't I don't
[2:14] remember what I showed yet and what I
[2:16] didn't. So um
[2:19] we'll start uh with uh this quote here.
[2:24] Now as we know uh with God sending us a
[2:27] prophet although God sends us a prophet
[2:30] we still have to take everything he says
[2:32] back to the word of God. Hallelujah.
[2:34] Because the Bible says you can't add one
[2:35] word and you can't take one word away.
[2:38] So as as I've learned, you know, I've
[2:40] learned that through the scripture. I've
[2:41] learned that by listening to brother
[2:42] Brandham. Now when brother Brandham
[2:44] would say, "Thus sayith the Lord,"
[2:45] that's God speaking. But it's going to
[2:46] agree with what's already in the Bible.
[2:49] It's not adding to the Bible. It's not
[2:50] taking away from the Bible. It's
[2:51] agreeing with what the Bible already
[2:53] says. But when there's times where
[2:55] brother man will say something his own
[2:56] human opinion, well, in those cases, we
[2:59] got to go back to the Bible because the
[3:00] Bible tells us that to prove all things.
[3:03] Okay, so that's 1 Thessalonians 5:21. Uh
[3:06] we're not going to read it, I guess not.
[3:07] But here's the quote that's in question
[3:10] uh with this topic.
[3:12] You know, uh brother Ram only said this
[3:14] one time.
[3:15] Okay. Uh, and think about that. In all
[3:17] the years of the recordings, you know,
[3:19] Brother Ram only said one time that we
[3:21] hear from our theophony. So, I'll read
[3:23] this quote. After you recognize the very
[3:26] word of God was eagle food because
[3:28] eagles, Jesus said at the end time where
[3:29] the eagles are, that's where the carcass
[3:32] is at the end time. So Jesus represents
[3:36] believers as eagles eating the fresh
[3:38] meat of the word. Okay. Uh, the very
[3:41] word was eagle food. Then you left the
[3:43] other thing. So as eagles, you know, we
[3:45] we'd say we left uh our previous home or
[3:48] or as Christians, we left the previous
[3:49] move of God, which was Pentecost. We
[3:51] would have left that and come to the
[3:53] fresh revelation. The Bible calls it the
[3:56] present truth. Hallelujah.
[3:59] You have then been formed into the
[4:01] living image of the living God. You have
[4:04] heard, you heard from your theophony, if
[4:06] this earthly bo body be dissolved, we
[4:08] have one waiting.
[4:10] Okay. So, some people read this and they
[4:13] think that when you get saved, you're
[4:15] actually hearing from heaven, it's like
[4:17] your uh your your spiritual body is
[4:20] talking to you. Now, I'm on the opinion
[4:23] that I don't think your theophony
[4:25] actually talks to you. That's what
[4:26] that's my opinion. So, I'm not sure what
[4:28] brother was talking about here. So, I've
[4:31] spent all these years looking for Bible
[4:32] verses.
[4:34] Uh are there any Bible verses that say
[4:36] we actually hear from our theophony?
[4:38] Now, to this point, I haven't found any,
[4:40] and I'm still waiting for someone to
[4:41] give me one, okay? But I'll show you one
[4:43] that's really close at the end. So, I'm
[4:45] going to build I'm going to work my way
[4:47] towards that at the end. So, what I
[4:49] believe now is we actually hear from the
[4:51] Holy Spirit. Okay? But, but there are
[4:55] some just so you know, message believers
[4:56] or preachers that say anytime you hear
[4:58] from God, you're actually hearing from
[4:59] your theophony body that's waiting for
[5:01] you. Okay? So, I don't know about that,
[5:04] but church, the Bible says uh that
[5:06] they're waiting for you in heaven. And
[5:08] so somewhere in heaven,
[5:10] there's a body that looks like Austin
[5:12] when he was 19 years old. It looks just
[5:13] like him and it's waiting for him,
[5:16] right? There's a there's a 19-year-old
[5:18] body of Brother Chris, right? And
[5:19] sisters there, all of us. I can name all
[5:21] of us. There's there's some body there
[5:22] waiting for us. And it looks like we
[5:25] like we look when we're 19 years old,
[5:27] except it's like an angel body. It's a
[5:29] theophony body. Okay. But some people
[5:32] believe that body is actually the one
[5:34] that will uh speak to us just because of
[5:36] this quote. Now again, I don't quite
[5:38] understand the quote, but it's all
[5:40] clear. It's plain to see which Bible
[5:42] verses brother uses, right? 2
[5:44] Corinthians 5:1. Okay? Now, we're to
[5:48] prove everything by the Bible. Okay?
[5:51] And we're to search the scriptures every
[5:53] day to prove what the prophet says, to
[5:56] prove which parts of God and which is
[5:58] not of God. Amen. Because a prophet is
[6:00] still a man, right? He can have his own
[6:03] human ideas, his own mistakes or his own
[6:05] thoughts. Brother Bam told us that
[6:07] plainly. He said, "I've always asked you
[6:08] to be careful which which uh which side
[6:10] you're he which side you're listening
[6:12] to, the human side or the prophetic
[6:14] side." That's in He cares you, you care
[6:17] 1963. Very famous quote for me and maybe
[6:20] for our church. I I mentioned it many
[6:22] times, but that's what he said. You got
[6:24] to be very careful. Make sure uh what
[6:26] you're listening to. Make sure if it's
[6:27] thus say the Lord or if it's just the
[6:29] human ideas. Okay. All right. Now, let's
[6:34] read 2 Corinthians uh again 5 1-5.
[6:40] Now,
[6:42] here's my thought that I want you to see
[6:43] tonight. It seems this this this section
[6:46] seems to only mention us longing for
[6:48] heaven, not actually hearing from our
[6:52] building. It's called the Bible says
[6:54] your your body waiting there. Austin,
[6:56] it's a building, right? Each one of us,
[6:59] nature, haven, you got a building. You
[7:02] got a body
[7:04] that's just waiting for you. It's like
[7:05] an angelic body. Okay? So, 2 Corinthians
[7:09] 5 1-5.
[7:11] For we know that if our earthly house of
[7:13] this tabernacle were dissolved, we have
[7:15] a building of God and house not made
[7:17] with hands, eternal in the heavens. In
[7:19] other words, God created this body for
[7:21] you. Hallelujah. And it's eternal. It's
[7:24] got eternal life. Amen. Hallelujah.
[7:26] Verse two. For in this we grown. Talking
[7:28] about in our bodies now we grown
[7:30] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[7:32] with our house which is from heaven.
[7:35] Isn't that true? Don't you desire a a
[7:37] body that doesn't sin? That's what I
[7:40] want probably more than anything else
[7:41] since I'm already saved. Right? If I'm
[7:43] already saved, what else do I want? I
[7:44] want a body that pleases God all the
[7:46] time. Amen. That's what that verse
[7:48] means. We're groaning. Oh, I just wish I
[7:50] could go a week without sinning.
[7:52] Wouldn't that be wonderful?
[7:54] How about a month or a year? Wouldn't
[7:55] that be just amazing? We're groaning for
[7:58] that. Oh, I wish I could serve God
[7:59] better. I wish I didn't get tired,
[8:02] right? Wish I didn't get worn out. Wish
[8:04] I could just give God all 24 hours I
[8:07] never had to sleep.
[8:09] We're groaning for that, right? We wish,
[8:10] oh, we wish we could just be perfect all
[8:12] the time and serve the Lord. Verse
[8:14] three, if so be that being clothed, we
[8:17] shall not be found naked. Now, the
[8:18] clothing, we don't have time to go
[8:19] there, but the clothing is a white robe.
[8:21] So that body of Austin and Chris, like I
[8:24] said, Malachi, it's standing there. Must
[8:26] be standing there. It's got a white robe
[8:28] on it because the white robe is the
[8:30] righteousness of saints. The white robe
[8:33] represents Jesus's holiness. In other
[8:35] words, so when you believe in Jesus, he
[8:38] took all your sins. He gives you a robe
[8:40] of righteousness. Hallelujah. Amen. All
[8:43] right. So it's a substitution. He died
[8:45] with all your sin on him and you get all
[8:48] his righteousness. Amen. Not some sins,
[8:51] not some iniquities, but what? All
[8:53] iniquities. All. And that's our only
[8:55] hope. None of us could ever make it to
[8:57] heaven on our goodness or our obedience.
[9:00] None of us could. We strive for
[9:02] obedience. We try to be as obedient as
[9:04] possible, but we'll only get to heaven
[9:06] by the righteousness of Jesus. Amen.
[9:09] And all the works we do is because of
[9:12] our appreciation for what Jesus did on
[9:14] the cross.
[9:16] Hallelujah. Amen. And it's motivated by,
[9:19] we talked about it on Sunday night. It's
[9:20] motivated by love. We love God. So that
[9:23] gives us faith. And the faith goes to
[9:25] work. Remember that. Galatians 5:6.
[9:28] Okay. Now, okay. Now, and so the souls
[9:32] of people who die, they get a theophony.
[9:34] And of course, their souls go down to
[9:36] hell. They have a theophony there down
[9:37] there in hell. And it's naked. I don't
[9:39] know what that means. Maybe they got
[9:40] dirty garments on. Maybe they have no
[9:42] garments on. But it's a naked uh
[9:44] theophony that doesn't it doesn't have
[9:45] the robes of righteousness.
[9:48] Okay. Verse four. For we that are in
[9:51] this tabernacle do grow being burdened,
[9:53] not for that we would be unclothed, but
[9:56] clothed upon that mortality might be
[9:59] swallowed up of life. See, doesn't
[10:00] everybody here want to live forever?
[10:02] Don't you want to live eternally? That's
[10:04] what it's saying. We're desiring for
[10:05] this mortality, our humanity, to have
[10:08] immortality.
[10:11] Verse five. Now, he that hath wrought us
[10:13] for the self, same thing as God, who
[10:15] hath also given unto us the earnest of
[10:17] the spirit. The earnest is the down
[10:18] payment, Brother Chris. So, when you
[10:20] bought your car, didn't you put a down
[10:21] payment on it? Yep. That's what the Holy
[10:24] Ghost is. When we get it here, it's like
[10:25] a down payment. Praise God. The rest is
[10:27] coming, right? You pay the down payment,
[10:30] you're going to pay the rest, right?
[10:31] Still you own it. That's how God is. God
[10:34] gives us the Holy Ghost. He's gonna give
[10:36] us every all the Holy Ghost we need
[10:38] until he owns us. Amen. Now, what I mean
[10:41] is until he has uh give us a brand new
[10:43] body. Hallelujah. He already owns us by
[10:45] the blood, but I'm talking about I'm
[10:46] just using as as a parallel. Praise God.
[10:49] Now, okay. Now, just brief briefly
[10:52] review. Remember, there's three kinds of
[10:53] bodies. Have you seen this, Brother
[10:55] Chris? Okay. So, you have the
[10:58] terrestrial body, which is your flesh
[10:59] body. That's what we're in right now.
[11:01] It's called the earthly house of this
[11:02] tabernacle.
[11:04] Now, you also have a celestial body,
[11:06] which is a theophony, waiting there in
[11:07] the seventh dimension. Now, let's read
[11:09] that. Brother Chris, would you get that?
[11:10] Matthew 18:10.
[11:12] This verse says, "Be careful how you
[11:14] treat the children because they have an
[11:16] angel that always stands before the
[11:18] throne of God." Always. Everybody say
[11:20] always. Ready? Always. That means God
[11:23] created it. God put that eternal body.
[11:25] Now, some people think this is a
[11:26] guardian angel. It could be, but in this
[11:28] context, it looks like it's a theophony
[11:30] body. So, go ahead, brother Chris.
[11:42] Amen. Amen. So that's what I believe
[11:45] this uh text means. Jesus says, "Be
[11:47] careful how you treat them because they
[11:49] have a body. They have eternal life."
[11:51] These are inheritors of eternal life.
[11:54] And remember what you ever do to the
[11:55] least of these, my brethren, with
[11:57] heavenly angels or heavenly theophanes.
[11:59] You've done it to the least of these,
[12:00] you've done it unto Christ. Praise God.
[12:03] Amen. Remember,
[12:06] it's called a building of God, a house
[12:07] not made with hands, eternal or a house
[12:10] from heaven, and it cannot eat. 2
[12:12] Corinthians uh 15:40.
[12:15] So, let's read that one. Brother Austin,
[12:16] you want to get that one? You got a
[12:17] Bible, brother? Okay. Can you get uh 1
[12:19] Corinthians 15:40? Now, in this verse,
[12:21] Brother Chris, you're going to see where
[12:22] it calls it. There's two kinds of
[12:24] bodies. There's terrestrial, which is
[12:25] flesh body, like all animals and beasts
[12:28] have, and birds and everything. But then
[12:29] there's celestial. Those are heavenly or
[12:32] angelic bodies. Okay, brother Austin,
[12:35] can you read that, brother?
[12:39] There are also celestial bodies.
[12:47] Amen. Thank you, brother. So, there's
[12:49] two kinds of bodies. There's flesh
[12:50] bodies, then there's spiritual bodies.
[12:53] Okay. Now that that list uh so we know
[12:56] uh we know the third type of body then
[12:59] would be a combination of both right
[13:02] hallelujah. So it's it's the best of
[13:04] both worlds. Praise God. So the third
[13:06] type of body is a glorified body. That's
[13:09] what Jesus resurrected in. Hallelujah.
[13:12] So I think I'll read Acts 3:13. Let I
[13:14] might as well just read it because I'm
[13:15] really close to Matthew Marks.
[13:18] Acts 3:13
[13:20] speaks of how Jesus is glorified. It
[13:22] says uh verse 13, the God of Abraham and
[13:25] Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our
[13:27] fathers hath hath glorified his son
[13:29] Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied
[13:32] him in the presence of Pilate when he
[13:34] was determined to let him go. So he's
[13:35] he's in a glorified body, which is a
[13:38] physical body that has the Holy Ghost
[13:41] swallow it up. So God's spirit swallows
[13:43] up this body and makes it back to your
[13:45] 19 years old or 21, whatever age that
[13:48] would be. And I didn't have time, but I
[13:50] was going to get a picture when I was 19
[13:51] and show it to you all because I said,
[13:52] "That's my glorified body. It's going to
[13:54] look a lot like that." Lydia is actually
[13:56] really close. So that look, let's look
[13:57] at Lydia. That's how her glorified body
[13:59] is going to look right there. She's 20,
[14:00] almost 21 in December. So, she's going
[14:03] to look a lot like that in the
[14:04] resurrection, but it's going to be a
[14:05] glow on it. Praise God. It's going to
[14:07] have a holy glow on it. All right. Now,
[14:10] like I said, I'm not going to spend too
[14:11] much time on this because I want to get
[14:12] to the main uh part of this.
[14:15] Now, brother Ram said, knowing that
[14:16] there's three bodies, that's the secret
[14:19] of our our lives. Brother Ram said, we
[14:22] see here plainly the complete secret of
[14:23] our lives in our journey, our death, and
[14:26] where we go after we die. And
[14:29] predestination is in plain view here.
[14:32] So, we know where we came from. We came
[14:33] from the mind of God, right? We came to
[14:36] the flesh body, then we're going to the
[14:38] theophony body, and then after that, we
[14:40] get a glorified body. So, that's the
[14:42] whole secret of where we came from and
[14:44] where we're going. And the church said,
[14:46] "Amen." Amen. All right. I actually I
[14:48] think I'm pretty doing pretty good on
[14:50] times here. So, let let me go. Uh,
[14:52] brother Bam said this. This is a secret
[14:54] that's now revealed that there's three
[14:56] stages
[14:58] or I'm sorry, there's three three stages
[15:00] to perfection. Okay. So, a lot of these
[15:03] have three stages. A lot of this is
[15:05] review. You get you get the Holy Ghost
[15:06] in three stages. Justification,
[15:08] sanctification, baptism of the Holy
[15:10] Ghost. Uh, your bodies. Now, this is
[15:12] what we're talking about tonight. You
[15:12] have a terrestrial, celestial, then
[15:14] glorified. So you have a flesh body,
[15:16] then you have a theophony or celestial
[15:18] body. Then you get a glorified body.
[15:20] That's the final body you'll be in.
[15:22] Okay? All right. And then the earth, of
[15:25] course, of course, is redeemed in three
[15:26] stages. It's perfected in three stages.
[15:28] Uh babies born. We just saw that with uh
[15:31] are the babies that were born here
[15:32] recently. Water, blood, spirit, and then
[15:34] the bride uh was restored to perfection
[15:37] through three messengers. Okay, I'm
[15:39] going to skip just for time sake. Well,
[15:41] I guess I can show that one. That's
[15:42] pretty good. Uh the gifts are perfected
[15:45] in three. Faith, hope, and charity.
[15:48] Faith, hope, love. The godhead is
[15:50] father, son, holy ghost. And the plant
[15:52] has three stages. That's also a type of
[15:55] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[15:56] Justification, sanctification, and the
[15:58] seed, baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[16:00] the Holy Ghost is called the seed of
[16:02] God. All right. Now, here's a brief
[16:04] summary of the flesh body. Uh it eats,
[16:07] sleeps, drinks. How many remember this
[16:08] picture? I think I showed I don't know
[16:10] when the last time I showed it, but I'll
[16:11] think I'll show it again. Our body eats,
[16:13] sleeps, drinks, touches, and uh this
[16:16] body could feel Jesus's glorified body
[16:19] because he said, "Thomas, touch my
[16:21] hands. Touch my side." Okay. It's a
[16:24] flesh body, though. It's under the
[16:25] corruption and the curse of death. Has
[16:27] sin in our our members.
[16:30] Okay. Whoops. Now, here's the one that
[16:32] we're talking about tonight. This is the
[16:33] theophony or the celestial body. This is
[16:35] an eternal body. It's a spirit-like or
[16:38] angel-like body. It's waiting in heaven.
[16:41] And brother Bam says it's there's no
[16:43] spirit in it as it's in heaven.
[16:46] That's important. Okay? Because that's
[16:48] what it's going to come down to. How do
[16:50] we hear from a body if there's no spirit
[16:52] in it? Because right now we hear from
[16:55] what? The Holy Spirit, right? And so
[16:58] that's why I just lean to this side that
[16:59] I think brother Ram was just giving his
[17:01] opinion. I heard from my theophony or
[17:03] something because I can't find a
[17:04] scripture that says we hear from the
[17:06] theophony. We just read about the
[17:07] theophony and it said we're groaning for
[17:10] it. But Paul never said we hear from it.
[17:13] He said we groan for it. Okay. And then
[17:16] there's here there's another quote from
[17:17] So when you have quotes from brother
[17:18] Brandham on both sides, you got to
[17:20] always got to go back to the Bible and
[17:21] see which one is right. Okay? And
[17:24] remember theophanes can touch other
[17:25] theophonies and theophanes can become
[17:28] visible and invisible to humans
[17:30] because Daniel saw a vision of an angel
[17:32] and the angel touched him. So a
[17:35] theophony, a spirit can touch a flesh
[17:37] body, right?
[17:40] Okay. And then remember theophanes can
[17:43] touch each other, right? Because the
[17:44] angels can wrestle, right? Daniel talks
[17:47] about that as well. Daniel chapter 10
[17:49] talks about that angels wrestled so uh
[17:51] the angel could get uh g Yeah. I'm
[17:53] sorry.
[17:54] No, Michael come by and wrestle the
[17:55] angel that was keeping the other angel
[17:57] away from getting to Daniel. All right.
[18:00] Now, theophony does not eat, sleep, or
[18:02] drink because they're like angel bodies.
[18:06] And then the glorified body, this is
[18:07] what Jesus had after the resurrection.
[18:09] It can be touched by flesh bodies, but
[18:11] it's not a spirit body. It's a glorified
[18:14] flesh body. It can eat food and drink
[18:16] like Jesus did after his resurrection.
[18:18] He had fish and and bread, remember? Uh
[18:21] and then it's needed for the wedding
[18:23] supper, the millennium, and the new
[18:24] city. Okay. Now, here's the most
[18:26] important quote, and that that's in my
[18:28] humble opinion. Imho, maybe I'll say
[18:31] imho. In my humble opinion. So, 1957,
[18:34] brother Ram said it was in the form of
[18:37] what we are now, which is called in the
[18:38] clergy way of speaking it, a theophony.
[18:41] It's a body that doesn't have a spirit
[18:43] in it. Okay? It's a body that's waiting
[18:47] for you Christians.
[18:49] As soon as the life leaves this, you go
[18:52] into that body.
[18:55] When this earthly tabernacle be
[18:56] dissolved, we have one already waiting
[18:58] at the Now, I just caught something real
[19:00] just briefly. The Bible said when the
[19:03] when the poor beggar Lazarus died, the
[19:05] Bible says the angels carried him to the
[19:07] paradise, right? Abraham's bosom. So, it
[19:10] seems like maybe that theophony is
[19:11] waiting right there after you die. after
[19:14] your your physical body dies, your soul
[19:16] and spirit go into the theophony right
[19:17] there because then the angels carried
[19:19] his theophony down there to Abraham's
[19:22] bosom. Yeah, brother Chris.
[19:27] Not yet. Not Not exactly. Yeah. Um not
[19:30] yet. Because the glorified body happens
[19:33] when Jesus raises up your dead body. So
[19:35] like the bodies in the caskets, right?
[19:41] Yes. Yes. Very good. Yes.
[19:46] Yes. So if we die, the physical body
[19:48] goes there. That physical body is
[19:49] waiting for the glorified body or in
[19:51] other words, it's waiting for the Holy
[19:52] Ghost to like energize it and swallow it
[19:55] up. That's the word the Bible uses,
[19:57] swallow. The Holy Spirit is going to
[19:58] swallow up all those ashes and bones or
[20:00] whatever's left, swallow it up, and make
[20:02] a brand new version of us. That's if we
[20:04] go to the grave. Okay? So, if we're
[20:08] alive to the rapture, brother Bham says,
[20:10] uh, the Holy Spirit will swallow up your
[20:12] your living body. That's what we hope we
[20:14] live to see. And the church said,
[20:17] right, we hope we're alive. And then the
[20:19] Bible said, uh, the Holy Ghost will
[20:21] swallow up this body. In other words,
[20:22] give it a glorified body. And then,
[20:25] Brother Ram said, we'll go up to meet
[20:26] Jesus in the air. That's where we'll
[20:28] meet our theophony. Now, I can't prove
[20:29] that by the Bible, but I think brother
[20:31] Ram's just trying to show how all three
[20:33] all three bodies come together for one.
[20:36] Okay.
[20:38] Yes. Very good, brother. Two. Yes. By
[20:40] one spirit. Yes, brother. Good. Very.
[20:42] Yes, brother. Austin.
[20:51] Uh, every everyone will get one. Yes.
[20:53] Yes. By the by the time of the new
[20:55] Jerusalem, everybody will get one
[20:56] because they have to live eternally.
[20:58] Yes. Very good question. Yep. Very good
[20:59] question. Let's give all the questions
[21:00] to the claps. Good. Good questions.
[21:02] Yeah. Yeah. everybody, every even the
[21:03] foolish version, everyone who has
[21:04] eternal life eventually. Now, the
[21:06] foolish version, they won't have it
[21:08] during the millennium because they'll be
[21:09] under the altar. But when when
[21:11] everything's judged, everything's ready
[21:13] to go, then all the believers who are
[21:15] saved will have a glorified body because
[21:17] remember there's tree of life. There's
[21:19] um the kings of the earth are going to
[21:20] bring their glory and honor into the new
[21:21] Jerusalem. So, they're going to be
[21:22] planting and the Ram says it's going to
[21:24] be like a garden of Eden except perfect
[21:26] condition. So, we're going to plant and
[21:29] eat and all kinds of things in glorified
[21:31] bodies. Yes, there will. Because
[21:32] remember they're eternal, right? So
[21:34] that's eternal life. There's eternal
[21:35] life in there. Good. Very good question.
[21:38] Now this is the one that means the most
[21:39] to me because uh if my theophony is
[21:43] waiting there and it looks like I did
[21:44] when I was 19, it doesn't have my spirit
[21:46] and soul in it. So how can it
[21:48] communicate?
[21:51] That's that that that's just my thought
[21:52] there. That's why I don't think I
[21:54] actually hear I don't I don't hear from
[21:56] the Holy Spirit through my theophony. I
[21:58] just hear from the Holy Spirit,
[22:00] right? That that's just what I believe.
[22:02] And remember church, there's only one
[22:04] quote. And let me remind remind you this
[22:05] too. Brother Ram never preached a full
[22:07] sermon on the theophony,
[22:10] right? And there's not two quotes on
[22:11] that say you've heard from your
[22:12] theophony. There's only one quote. So
[22:15] that ought to make us understand. Wow.
[22:16] Brother Bam wasn't he wasn't trying to
[22:18] make a doctrine out of this. I'm going
[22:20] to pull up my notes here so I don't
[22:21] forget. I had a couple of notes I didn't
[22:23] want to forget.
[22:26] Yes.
[22:30] Okay. Now, um I'm going to skip past
[22:32] that just for time sake. Now, here's the
[22:34] order that we go through. For us, we
[22:37] were first thoughts in the mind of God.
[22:39] Ephesians 1:4 says, "You were chosen in
[22:41] Christ before the foundation world." So,
[22:43] you started off in the mind of God and
[22:45] then you skipped the theophony because
[22:46] Jesus went to the which is the spirit
[22:48] form. We went from thought to the flesh
[22:51] body to be tempted and tested, right?
[22:54] And overcome sin. If we die, we go to
[22:57] the theophony body, which is also called
[22:58] a word body or a celestial body, a body
[23:00] with eternal life. And then at the
[23:02] rapture, we get a glorified body. Okay?
[23:07] But Jesus went from the thought, right,
[23:09] he Jes God had a thought, I'm going to
[23:11] have a son who's going to die for our
[23:12] sin sins, right? He's going to raise and
[23:14] he's going to be the savior. He's going
[23:15] to be a an image that they can see. It's
[23:17] going to be me, but in another image,
[23:20] right? So Jesus went from a thought God
[23:23] is going to I'm going to have a son into
[23:26] theophony that was the pillar of fire
[23:27] right the logos at the beginning right
[23:30] because uh which day was the sun created
[23:32] on I always forget that was day three or
[23:34] day two no day day four yes very good
[23:38] the sun was created on the fourth day
[23:40] thank you night and day was the first uh
[23:43] first day right night and day so before
[23:46] the sun was created all the stars how'd
[23:48] you get light by the holy spirit was the
[23:51] Right? So when when Jesus was in his
[23:53] theophony form, that was the light that
[23:55] was the visible light in the uh in the
[23:58] spiritual realm. Okay? And then Jesus
[24:02] became a flesh body
[24:05] uh formed in the virgin Mary. And then
[24:07] after he died, resurrected, then he got
[24:09] the glorified body. Okay? So the the
[24:12] difference is the the the step here with
[24:14] the theophony. Second step for Jesus,
[24:16] third step for us. Okay. How am I doing
[24:19] on time? Okay, pretty good. Now, uh
[24:22] Malachi, you want to read that? Malachi,
[24:24] get Luke 9. Sister Z, would you read
[24:25] tonight? Would that be okay? Would you
[24:26] go to uh 1st Samuel 28 and just do verse
[24:30] 20, sister? Just verse 20. Okay. Now, I
[24:33] made this video yesterday.
[24:35] You You could hear from somebody else's
[24:37] theophony. Now, it's very rare, but you
[24:40] could hear from somebody else's
[24:41] theophony, but I've never found a verse
[24:43] where you hear from your own theophony.
[24:46] Does that make sense?
[24:48] Okay. Okay. So, we want to be uh we want
[24:50] to speak where the Bible speaks. We want
[24:52] to be silent where the Bible's silent,
[24:53] right? We don't want to add to the
[24:54] Bible. We don't want to take away from
[24:56] the Bible. Okay. So, Malachi is going to
[24:58] read here. Jesus hears from two other
[25:01] Theophanes. So, Malachi read 29 30-331.
[25:19] Amen. And the church said, "So Jesus is
[25:22] on Mount Transfiguration. He's he's
[25:24] transfigured. He's in a shining body.
[25:27] And then there's Moses in his theophony
[25:29] and there's Elijah in his theophony. And
[25:31] they're talking to him about going to
[25:33] Jerusalem,
[25:35] right? They're talking about his death.
[25:36] And the Bible said just his decease."
[25:38] So, his death, they only talked about
[25:41] his decease. Now, Jesus knew he'd rise
[25:43] again because he already told that,
[25:44] remember, we we read that on Sunday
[25:45] night. Yeah. In Matthew 16, uh that he'd
[25:49] rise again on the third day. So, Jesus
[25:51] knew he'd rise. But these theophanes
[25:53] come down and they give him more
[25:55] information about his decease or about
[25:57] his passion, the Bible calls it, or the
[25:59] crucifixion. Okay? So, Jesus heard from
[26:02] two Theophanes.
[26:04] All right. Now, sisters, I was going to
[26:05] read uh 1st Samuel 28. Uh, can you read
[26:08] just 20?
[26:22] Amen. Thank you, sister. So, Saul gets
[26:24] so afraid
[26:26] um that he falls down and he just lays
[26:29] there. Now, this is where I believe he
[26:30] repented of his sins, right? Because
[26:33] then David sings a song after he dies
[26:35] and the Bible said Saul and Jonathan
[26:37] were united in death. So this is where I
[26:40] believe he repents of all of his sins
[26:41] because he lays there all night and then
[26:43] he's already told that he's going to be
[26:45] uh killed. Now what's interesting,
[26:47] church, go back to 13. I'm going to read
[26:49] verse 13. And the king said unto her, be
[26:50] not afraid for what seeest thou? And the
[26:52] woman said unto Saul, I saw gods
[26:54] ascending out of the earth. I saw
[26:55] theophanes.
[26:57] So brother Chris, this is one of these
[26:58] amazing Bible stories.
[27:02] King Saul was able to go to a witch and
[27:04] call up Theophanes.
[27:07] God's ascending out of the earth. Now,
[27:10] we only know that we only know Samuel
[27:12] came up, but the Bible says gods. So,
[27:14] some other ones were somehow coming up.
[27:17] I don't know how that I don't know if
[27:18] that's demons. I'm not sure, but gods
[27:20] were judges or rulers of the believers.
[27:22] So, maybe maybe other believers came up.
[27:24] I'm not sure.
[27:26] But then Samuel was a a prophet who had
[27:28] died. He came up and he told Saul what
[27:31] was going to happen to him. Okay. Now go
[27:34] to verse 14. And he said unto her, "What
[27:36] form is he of?" And she said, "An old
[27:39] man cometh up and he's covered with a
[27:40] mantle. And Saul perceived that it was
[27:42] Samuel. And he stooped with his face to
[27:44] the ground and bowed himself." Okay. So
[27:47] here's King Saul seeing Theophanes, but
[27:50] he gets to talk to one of them. Brother
[27:54] Chris,
[27:57] yes, that's a good question. Now, why is
[27:59] that? Because Satan was god of this
[28:02] earth until the cross,
[28:05] right?
[28:07] This this is before the cross. Yeah.
[28:09] This is a thousand years before the
[28:10] cross. David was a thousand years before
[28:12] the cross. So, this is right before
[28:14] David. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Uh and and also
[28:18] now, Satan's called God of this evil
[28:20] age, right? uh in 2 Corinthians 4
[28:22] verse4. But Satan had the keys of death
[28:25] and hell in the Old Testament because he
[28:27] deceived Adam.
[28:30] I'm sorry. He deceived Eve. Sorry, Adam
[28:32] willingly sinned. I'm sorry, I'm getting
[28:33] going a little fast here. He deceived
[28:35] Eve. Adam was not deceived. So, because
[28:37] he conquered Adam and Eve, I'll just say
[28:39] like that. Uh then Satan got the keys to
[28:42] death and hell. So now this witch,
[28:44] because Satan has the keys of death and
[28:46] hell, she has access to these spirits,
[28:48] these souls, these theophanes.
[28:51] So she's able to call them up because
[28:53] Satan has the keys of death and hell.
[28:56] But what did Jesus say after he rose? He
[28:57] said, "I am he that would died and
[28:59] liveth." And he said, "I have the keys
[29:01] of de of death and hell." Amen. Okay. So
[29:05] now nobody can call up uh Theophanes.
[29:08] Nobody can call him up out of the earth
[29:10] because Jesus now has power over that
[29:12] realm.
[29:13] Okay. And now paradise is not in the
[29:16] heart of the earth. Now paradise is
[29:18] above in the we'd say the third heaven
[29:20] or heaven, the heaven of heavens where
[29:23] God's throne is.
[29:25] All right, that's now that's a deep
[29:27] study. This is this these are deep and
[29:28] rich things here by God's grace. But
[29:31] I've been studying on it this week and I
[29:32] thought it'd be nice to give me a little
[29:33] break. I got about 15 minutes here.
[29:36] That's just an amazing story, brother
[29:38] Chris. If you want to read that 1st
[29:39] Samuel 28, amazing story and you got to
[29:42] go to other and and Samuel even
[29:44] prophesies to him. Actually, you know,
[29:46] Sister Z, could you read verse 19?
[29:48] That's I I gave you the wrong one. I
[29:50] want Zur to read 19, brother Chris. And
[29:52] here's where Samuel still prophesies
[29:57] because brother Ram says, "Whatever you
[29:59] are on earth, that's what you'll be in
[30:00] glory." So, he's still a prophet. Even
[30:03] though he's dead, he'll always be a
[30:05] prophet. So, sisters, would you read
[30:06] verse 19?
[30:19] Amen. Let's give our sister two class.
[30:21] Ready? So, so King Saul says, uh, uh,
[30:25] call up Samuel because God won't answer
[30:26] me. So, he he comes up and he says,
[30:28] "Tomorrow you and your sons will be with
[30:30] with me." Well, where was Samuel? He was
[30:32] in the heart of the earth. So, King Saul
[30:34] knows, "I'm going to die tomorrow.
[30:36] sometime tomorrow I'm going to die. So
[30:38] he lays on the ground all night and what
[30:40] I believe he was confessing his sins and
[30:42] then he and Jonathan were united right
[30:44] before they both died.
[30:48] No, Samuel was saved. In the Old
[30:50] Testament, brother, they went to they
[30:52] went to hell where there was remember
[30:53] there was a chasm between the believers
[30:54] and the unbelievers.
[30:59] Uh no, it was a chasm between where the
[31:01] saved were and the and the lost. Heaven
[31:04] is always above, but they couldn't go to
[31:06] heaven because the blood of Jesus Christ
[31:08] had not been shed yet.
[31:10] Their sins were just covered by animal
[31:12] blood. So, they couldn't go to heaven
[31:14] and Satan had the power over them,
[31:17] right? Because uh their sins really
[31:18] weren't covered over or the sins really
[31:21] weren't totally annihilated, we'd say,
[31:24] or paid for. Good question. Yep. Yeah,
[31:28] they weren't paid for really because
[31:29] animal uh and animal blood really
[31:31] couldn't pay for human sins. So, a human
[31:34] had to die to pay for human sins.
[31:37] Yep. Very good, brother. Very good.
[31:38] That's what And that's what Hebrews, the
[31:40] book of Hebrews is all about that,
[31:42] right? The blood of bulls and goats
[31:43] could never take away sins, but the
[31:45] blood of God's son could take away sins.
[31:48] Yep. All right. So, you can hear from
[31:51] someone else's theophony. Now, I never
[31:53] have. I don't know anyone who has. Uh
[31:58] I guess I'll say it like this. Brother
[31:59] Ram got to see theophonies beyond the
[32:01] current of time. But Austin
[32:16] Oh, yeah. Yeah. Brother uh Brother
[32:18] Sanchez.
[32:20] Yep. It was uh Bill. Bill Sanchez. Okay.
[32:23] That's interesting, brother. Yes. Okay.
[32:26] So, uh brother Bill said his wife
[32:29] passed. His wife passed away. We know
[32:31] that. But when Austin and Lena got
[32:32] baptized, he said he felt her theophony
[32:35] was in the room, right? Is that No.
[32:46] Oh, he saw saw at the window. Okay. So,
[32:49] if that was genuine, that would have
[32:51] been the theophony. Yeah. So, he saw the
[32:53] theophony.
[32:55] Okay. Yes. Good. Good memory. Yeah. Good
[32:58] memory. Give me two class. Good memory,
[32:59] brother. I forgot all about that. Amen.
[33:01] Yeah.
[33:10] Yes.
[33:15] Right. Well, these two these two verses
[33:17] prove you can.
[33:20] Yeah. Their body what what death is
[33:23] called sleep because their body is
[33:24] laying in the ground. It's called sleep.
[33:26] But their souls are not sleeping. It's
[33:27] the body that's likened unto sleeping.
[33:30] the physical the terrestrial body, but
[33:33] they're in they're alive. And then Jesus
[33:35] says, uh, God is the God of the living.
[33:37] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are alive.
[33:39] Jesus says so. So, it's the it's the
[33:41] physical body that is likened unto
[33:43] sleeping, but they're just they're more
[33:45] alive now than they ever were before.
[33:47] Praise God. Amen. That's right. Yeah.
[33:50] Once once a believer dies, they're more
[33:52] alive than they've ever been before
[33:54] because they're in an eternal body.
[33:57] Yes. Good question. Give two claps.
[33:58] That's a great one, brother. Great,
[34:00] great, great questions, brother. Good
[34:01] memory there. I forgot about that one.
[34:02] By God's grace. So, he didn't talk to
[34:04] her. He just saw her. Yeah. Very good.
[34:08] And then, Brother Ram went beyond the
[34:09] curtain of time. So, he must have some.
[34:11] So, he must it must have been by vision,
[34:13] but he went over there and he must have
[34:15] entered into his theophony because they
[34:17] were hugging him beyond the curtain of
[34:18] time.
[34:20] In other words, they went to the the the
[34:22] sixth dimension or the place where the
[34:24] maybe uh yeah, it would have been uh
[34:25] sixth dimension by God's grace where the
[34:28] believers go. Okay, now we're down to a
[34:32] couple minutes here. I want to uh close
[34:33] up here. Now, let me uh
[34:36] Yeah, I don't have Yeah, let me just go
[34:38] through this and I'll back up a little
[34:39] bit. All if if if if you read your Bible
[34:43] before hearing brother Ram say you've
[34:44] heard from your theophony everything in
[34:46] the Bible would tell you that you heard
[34:48] from your I'm sorry that you heard from
[34:49] the Holy Spirit not from your theophony.
[34:52] Okay. If you if you just read the Bible
[34:54] and you didn't hear who is this Melzdc
[34:56] like me I would have thought why you
[34:59] just hear from the Holy Spirit right?
[35:01] And so just here are some examples.
[35:02] Jesus said the spirit of truth guides
[35:05] you into all truth.
[35:07] The spirit. Okay. Jesus said, "My sheep
[35:10] hear my voice, not the voice of your
[35:12] theophony." I'm just I'm just giving a
[35:13] contrast here. Okay? So, every everyone
[35:15] know what I'm saying.
[35:18] Uh Jesus said, "Hear what the spirit
[35:20] says to your the churches."
[35:22] Okay? The spirit said to Peter in Acts
[35:25] chapter 10 uh to go to up to the house
[35:27] of Cornelius.
[35:29] Hebrews 10:25 says, "Him that speaks
[35:32] him." Well, what if a woman if a woman
[35:35] has a a female theophony? Then she'd
[35:38] hear from her. Everybody understand
[35:40] that?
[35:42] If you heard from your theophony and
[35:43] you're a female, you'd hear from her.
[35:47] Okay? So, it seems to be pretty cut and
[35:48] dry to me. Like, it pretty easy. But you
[35:51] know what? I'm going to give Brother the
[35:53] benefit of the doubt. I'm just going to
[35:54] leave that up on the shelf. Okay? If I'm
[35:56] wrong, God will correct me because I
[35:58] love Jesus, right? And I'm not speaking
[36:00] against that quote. I'm just saying I
[36:02] got to prove the quote by the Bible.
[36:04] That's a Bible command to prove all
[36:06] things. Okay?
[36:09] And the Bible said, "How should I hear
[36:10] without a preacher?" Well, what if
[36:13] you're not a preacher and you're hearing
[36:15] it from your theophony? Can you hear
[36:17] then?
[36:19] You see, you have to be able to put all
[36:21] the scripture together. All the
[36:23] scriptures got to agree together.
[36:25] Okay?
[36:27] And then faith comes by hearing. That's
[36:29] in the same chapter. You hear by a
[36:30] preacher. Faith comes by hearing the
[36:32] preacher. So the spirit of God is
[36:34] speaking through the the Holy Spirit's
[36:36] speaking through the preacher.
[36:38] Okay? And then the five-fold uh
[36:40] preaching, the five-fold preaching gifts
[36:41] bring us to the unity of the faith and
[36:44] faith comes by hearing the word of God
[36:46] being preached by the Holy Spirit in the
[36:48] preacher. Right? But then uh you can
[36:50] also open your Bible and the uh the
[36:53] spirit can speak to you through the
[36:54] Bible. Right? That happens to most of
[36:56] us, right? like where that's where I got
[36:58] that idea of preaching this series on
[37:00] David or the spirit of burning series.
[37:01] The spirit spoke to me while reading the
[37:03] Bible.
[37:05] Okay. All right. Now, I didn't want to
[37:08] stop there, but I want to back up. Okay.
[37:11] Now, I want to say a couple more things.
[37:13] Um, now some say that we hear from our
[37:15] theophony because its substance is the
[37:17] Holy Ghost. Now, this is a little
[37:19] deeper. So, picture your picture your
[37:21] glorified I'm sorry, picture your
[37:22] theophony over here waiting in heaven.
[37:24] What is it made of? What's it substance?
[37:26] It's the Holy Spirit. It's a holy body.
[37:29] So, some people tell me that, well,
[37:31] because your theophony is composed of a
[37:34] Holy Spirit, it's made of a holy spirit,
[37:36] right? The Holy Spirit made it. Then it
[37:38] can speak to you. That's what some
[37:40] people tell me. Now, to me, that's
[37:42] pushing it a little bit. I don't I can't
[37:44] see that by the Bible, right? Because
[37:46] the Bible calls it a building and a
[37:48] house. And does your house talk to you?
[37:50] Mine doesn't. The mice talk to me, but
[37:54] the house doesn't.
[37:57] And brother said, what's the real part
[37:58] of you? The soul is the real part of
[38:00] you. Right? That's your your theophony
[38:03] is a body. It's waiting for a soul to
[38:06] get there.
[38:07] Okay?
[38:10] So, I can't see this because every
[38:11] believer is hearing from their own
[38:12] theophony rather than the person of the
[38:14] Holy Ghost. Right?
[38:18] That's what I believe. You know, I I
[38:19] believe we're hearing from the Holy
[38:21] Ghost. I'm not hearing from my
[38:22] theophony,
[38:24] right? I'm hearing from the Holy Ghost.
[38:26] That's what I'm that's what I believe
[38:28] because that's what's all those verses
[38:29] say. The Bible says you're hearing from
[38:31] the spirit. The spirit of the spirit,
[38:32] not your theophony. Theophony or
[38:34] celestial body. Right now, this was
[38:37] interesting. Now, here's the closest
[38:39] thing to hearing from your theophony. Go
[38:41] to Revelation 5:5. And I'm getting ready
[38:44] to close here. Okay. Watch the time.
[38:47] Yeah, brother. Also, I announce it. Did
[38:48] you hear me announce it earlier?
[38:49] Remember when you used to get up at 4:30
[38:51] for work and we would always try to
[38:53] shorten our Wednesday night services. So
[38:54] we got to I'm going to try to do that
[38:56] for a little while till Malachi gets a
[38:58] AC accumated.
[39:00] What's it called? Acclimated.
[39:01] Acclimated. Sorry, I forgot the L.
[39:03] Acclimated. Thank you. Yes, sir. Yes,
[39:06] sir. And everyone was very happy for
[39:09] Austin. So, let's be happy for Malachi
[39:11] as well. And uh
[39:14] just be thankful you don't have to get
[39:16] up at 5:30 and then work for 13 hours,
[39:18] right? I'm sorry, 4:30. Right. I'm
[39:20] thankful. I get up with Malachi, but I I
[39:22] wait till 5 o'clock to get up and I pray
[39:23] with him every morning. And uh but uh
[39:25] I'm not I don't get up at 4:30. Then I
[39:27] don't work all day.
[39:29] So Revelation 5:5.
[39:32] Now this very interesting. It's very
[39:34] interesting. Remember in the previous
[39:36] chapter, there's 24 elders up in heaven.
[39:38] They're in their theophanes. There's 24
[39:41] Theophanes and there's Jesus theophony
[39:43] on the throne,
[39:45] right?
[39:46] And John gets to go up to heaven.
[39:51] The spirit said, "Come up hither." And
[39:52] he's taken. So he's either taken there
[39:55] by vision or he's taken there into his
[39:57] theophony. Now I think it's vision
[40:00] because then if it's theophony, now you
[40:02] got two theophies,
[40:04] right? Because one of those 24, it's 12
[40:08] uh sons of Jacob and it's the 12
[40:10] apostles of Jesus.
[40:13] Well, John was one of those 12 apostles
[40:15] of Jesus.
[40:17] And brother Ram said, "No wonder John
[40:19] shouted. He saw his theophony there." In
[40:22] other words, I know I'm going to heaven.
[40:24] Praise God. I've had a vision. In other
[40:26] words, I've had a vision. I've seen that
[40:28] I'm there. Praise God. And brother Ram
[40:30] came back from that uh uh experience
[40:33] beyond the curtain of time in Rejected
[40:35] King 1960. And he says, "I saw you over
[40:37] there." I He said, "I saw some of you
[40:39] over there." What what a consolation.
[40:42] Praise God. What a testimony. Brother
[40:44] Brother could say, "I saw you over
[40:46] there, brother. Brother, sister, I saw
[40:48] you over there. You're going to make
[40:50] it." Amen. And John could say the same
[40:52] thing. I saw myself over there.
[40:56] Now, chapter 5:5,
[40:58] "And one of the elders saith unto me,
[41:01] weep now. Behold, the line of the tribe
[41:02] of Judah, the root of David, hath
[41:04] prevailed to open the book, and to loose
[41:05] the seven seals thereof." One of the
[41:08] elders, which one was it, Brother
[41:09] Austin? Was it John?
[41:12] John talking to John? Now, wouldn't that
[41:15] be strange? Now, see, I couldn't explain
[41:17] that. How can I explain that?
[41:20] So, this is one case where maybe it's
[41:22] possible you had a one in 24 chance
[41:25] to hear from his own theophony.
[41:30] Isn't that something? So, that's the
[41:32] closest one I found. I like, but now
[41:34] church, there's got to be what, two or
[41:36] three witnesses.
[41:38] Okay. Can we hear from other
[41:39] theophonies? Yes. No doubt about it. But
[41:42] can you hear from your own theophony?
[41:44] Well, maybe. That's why I say maybe.
[41:46] It's a possibility that his own
[41:49] theophony talked to him. But we don't
[41:52] know that it was John.
[41:54] Hallelujah. Now, what's interesting if
[41:57] this is true, now let's say it is true.
[41:58] You hear from your own theophony then
[42:00] you have then two parts of you are
[42:02] talking could be talking at the same
[42:04] time. Right? John was talking on earth
[42:07] maybe after this vision.
[42:09] and his theophony was up there
[42:10] worshiping God. Now, wouldn't that be an
[42:13] interesting thing? I'm not saying it is.
[42:15] I think that's far-fetched. I I think
[42:17] that's that's not the right scriptural
[42:19] application. But what if I'm wrong,
[42:23] Brother Chris?
[42:32] Yes. Matthew 27. Yep. Let's go there.
[42:34] Matthew 27:52 and 53. I know it because
[42:36] I was on my video this week and it's
[42:37] fresh on my mind.
[42:47] That's a good question. Now, brother,
[42:49] that now that I thought about it, I do
[42:50] believe they were in their glorified
[42:52] bodies, but I could be wrong. They could
[42:53] have just been in their theophles,
[43:01] right? Well, that's right. That's a good
[43:03] point, too. Yes. Uh
[43:08] yeah, those 12 sons of Jacob could have
[43:11] already been in their glorified bodies.
[43:13] And the reason I say that the Old
[43:14] Testament saints were probably in their
[43:15] glorified body was because Jesus was in
[43:17] his glorified body.
[43:20] And he brought he he led captivity
[43:22] captive. He led all the Old Testament
[43:24] saints out of captivity into a better
[43:27] captivity and eternal captivity being
[43:29] with Jesus for eternity.
[43:33] Okay. So that's why, but I could be
[43:34] wrong too. I mean, those Old Testament
[43:35] saints, they could have been their
[43:36] theophies. But Matthew 27:51, "And
[43:39] behold, the veil of the temple was rent
[43:41] and twain from the top to the bottom,
[43:43] and the earth did quake, and the rocks
[43:44] rent. And the graves were open, and many
[43:47] bodies, now not all." That's what
[43:49] brother says. Look, not all, but that
[43:50] means maybe some foolish version Old
[43:53] Testament saints are still in the heart
[43:54] of the earth, like Saul, like Lot
[43:58] because Lot lost all his reward. And
[44:01] Saul no doubt lost all his reward. God
[44:03] had to snatch the kingdom away from him
[44:06] because he was so rebellious. But he was
[44:07] saved because he was with Samuel.
[44:11] Okay. Many of the bodies of the saints
[44:13] which slept arose the bodies.
[44:16] So that's probably the physical body. If
[44:18] that's the case, then it would have had
[44:19] to been glorified,
[44:21] right? If it's the physical body,
[44:23] because it doesn't say celestial or
[44:24] angel. It doesn't say angel body like we
[44:26] read in Matthew 18:10.
[44:28] And came out of the grave. So it even it
[44:31] connects the body to the grave. So it
[44:32] looks like a glorified body now that I'm
[44:34] thinking about it
[44:37] after his resurrection and went to the
[44:39] holy city and appeared to many. Now here
[44:42] it doesn't say they talked to people.
[44:44] They just appeared to people.
[44:47] So here uh here we see glorified bodies
[44:51] probably of the Old Testament saints. Me
[44:53] many of them appeared and people saw
[44:56] them kind of like kind of like brother
[44:58] Bill saw his wife. Now that would have
[45:00] been theophony right just saw it but
[45:03] then here they actually see there
[45:05] probably probably their glorified
[45:06] bodies.
[45:09] All right now so m Revelation 55 is the
[45:13] closest thing that I found to hearing
[45:15] from your theophony but I think it's
[45:17] still a stretch. Uh John heard one of
[45:19] the elders which could have been his own
[45:21] theophony. So, do we have two active
[45:23] spirits since the elder bowed down in
[45:26] heaven? Right? Because remember, John
[45:28] kept watching and remember what do they
[45:29] do? They fall down. Let's go back to
[45:31] Revelation 5.
[45:35] They uh John is one of those 24 that
[45:38] falls down
[45:40] uh and uh throws his crown at the feet
[45:43] of Jesus.
[45:49] Now, now verse eight, the 24 elders fell
[45:52] down.
[45:56] And where does it say they cast their
[45:58] crowd?
[46:03] Anybody see where they cast their craft?
[46:12] Verse eight says, "And when he had taken
[46:14] the book, the four beasts and four 20
[46:16] elders fell down before the lamb, having
[46:17] every one of them harps and golden vows
[46:19] full of odors, which are the prayers of
[46:20] the saints. And they sung a new song,
[46:22] saying, Thou art worthy to take the
[46:23] book, and open the seals thereof. For
[46:24] thou was slain, and hast redeemed us to
[46:26] God by thy blood out of every kindred
[46:28] and tongue and people and nation, and
[46:30] has made un us unto our God kings and
[46:32] priests, and we shall reign on the
[46:34] earth." Praise God.
[46:39] Oh, it's in chapter 4, right? 410. Thank
[46:42] you, honey. I was I was starting to
[46:43] think, well, maybe it's not in this
[46:44] chapter. Maybe it's in the previous
[46:45] chapter, but I know they threw their
[46:46] crowns down. Verse 10 in chapter 4. And
[46:49] the four and 20 elders fall down before
[46:51] him that sat on the throne and worship
[46:53] him that liveth forever and ever, and
[46:54] cast their crowns before the throne,
[46:56] saying, Thou art worthy, O Lord, to
[46:58] receive glory and honor and power, for
[47:00] thou hast created all things, and for
[47:02] thy pleasure they are and were created.
[47:06] Okay. Now,
[47:08] um, yeah. So, if people believe you hear
[47:12] from your theophony, then they have to
[47:14] throw out this quote where brother says
[47:16] it doesn't have a spirit in it because
[47:18] in order for a theophony to speak, it's
[47:20] got to have a spirit in it because he
[47:22] says that it doesn't have a spirit in
[47:23] it.
[47:25] Right? So, either way, you've got quotes
[47:27] on both sides. So, what do you do when
[47:29] you got quotes on both sides? You got to
[47:30] go back to the scripture.
[47:32] All right?
[47:34] And so what is the best part of all
[47:35] this? The best part of all this is like
[47:37] I read there earlier.
[47:40] The best part of all this is that we
[47:43] know the complete secret in our journey
[47:46] and death and where we go after we die.
[47:48] We don't have to worry where we're
[47:49] going. We've got a house waiting for us
[47:52] in the heavens. Praise God. Let's stand
[47:54] to our feet. Musicians can come. How
[47:56] many minutes was that, Kesha?
[47:59] 48. Praise. Let's all say praise the
[48:01] Lord. Can we? Praise the Lord. So, it's
[48:03] kind of like a Bible study tonight. How
[48:04] many enjoyed that tonight? Amen. It's
[48:06] been on my heart and I thought I'd been
[48:08] studying on it. I thought, well, I'll
[48:09] just take a little break here. I was
[48:11] singing so loud, preaching so hard. My
[48:12] wife's like, "Jesse, you were preaching
[48:14] so hard on Sunday." And Z's like,
[48:16] "You're clapping so hard, Daddy. That
[48:18] hurts my ears." I'm like, "I'm sorry,
[48:20] buddy. I get so excited sometimes."
[48:24] So, I'll try to be careful, please. And
[48:26] this is a very small room. Like, we've
[48:27] had Rod tell us that. Lots of people
[48:29] come in here and like, "Brother Jesse,
[48:30] it's so loud in here.
[48:32] Uh, if we stay here, church, I'm just
[48:34] talking now. I'm talking as a trustee,
[48:35] right? If we stay here, we might have to
[48:37] get those sound panels and just hang
[48:38] them up all across.
[48:41] If we stay here, our contracts up next
[48:44] year. But, you know, since she she gave
[48:46] us that concrete walkway out there, I
[48:47] thought, boy, she's been really good to
[48:49] us. You know why she said that? She
[48:51] said, because we've when we walked in
[48:53] here, this place was filthy. She said
[48:55] she did that because we pay our rent
[48:56] early. I pay early every month. I pay
[49:00] like a week or two early every month.
[49:01] just so it's there. She said, "Because
[49:03] you pay early. You guys keep this place
[49:05] in good condition. I want to do
[49:06] something nice for you." And she said,
[49:08] "And you like me."
[49:11] I said, "Well, how could I not like you?
[49:12] You're the best landlord I ever had. You
[49:15] anytime something happens, she's right
[49:16] on it. Boy, she's just Johnny on the
[49:18] spot." We'd say, "Um, but we're
[49:21] thankful, church. We're thankful."
[49:23] So, I just want to check my notes here.
[49:28] Hallelujah.
[49:32] Oh yeah, there was one more thing. Um,
[49:35] but I'll get to that another time. It's
[49:37] not really that important here. So, I'm
[49:39] at the same spot, church. I'm at the
[49:41] same spot. I I still don't I can't
[49:42] understand that we could actually hear
[49:44] from our theophony since a theophony
[49:46] doesn't have a spirit in it. But either
[49:49] way,
[49:50] the Bible says we hear from the Holy
[49:52] Spirit. How many know that by God's
[49:53] grace? So whether it's the Holy Spirit
[49:55] speaking through my theophony or just
[49:57] the Holy Spirit speaking directly to me,
[49:59] I've heard what the Spirit has said to
[50:01] the church. Hallelujah. And I've
[50:02] repented. I've been baptized. I've been
[50:04] filled with the Holy Ghost. I'm
[50:05] hungering and thirsting for more of
[50:07] God's righteousness. That's why we're
[50:09] here tonight. Praise God. I trust you
[50:11] are blessed tonight. Praise God. Let's
[50:12] bow our heads.
[50:14] Father God, we're thankful, Lord God,
[50:16] for tonight, Lord. I'm trying to be
[50:17] cautious of the time and also my voice,
[50:20] Lord. I certainly wore myself out, Lord,
[50:22] on Sunday.
[50:24] But Lord, it reminds us Lord of Father's
[50:26] Day last Sunday, Lord God. And that you
[50:28] are the greatest father. Greatest is
[50:31] such a
[50:33] just a
[50:35] insufficient word to describe you, oh
[50:37] God almighty.
[50:39] The whole earth is full of your glory,
[50:41] Lord. Lord, we thank you for tonight
[50:43] that the complete mystery of what
[50:45] happens when we die, it's been revealed.
[50:48] We have a house waiting. It's an eternal
[50:51] house. Hallelujah.
[50:55] And Lord, we're groaning for that right
[50:56] now. Boy, I'd love to be in a house,
[50:58] God, where I didn't sin. I'd love to be
[51:00] in a house where I didn't make these
[51:02] mistakes like I make here. I'd love to
[51:05] be in a house where it doesn't get
[51:06] tired, doesn't have to sleep.
[51:10] Who's the voice doesn't get sore and
[51:14] doesn't get a sore throat, and Lord, I'd
[51:16] love to just clap in a in a in a
[51:19] theophony body. What would that be like,
[51:21] dear God? Oh Lord, Lord, we groan for
[51:24] that body so that mortality would be
[51:27] swallowed up of immortality, Lord God.
[51:31] So we thank you, Lord, for the word of
[51:33] God tonight, Lord Jesus. If if there's
[51:36] more revelation on this, and we do hear
[51:37] from our theophony that Lord, then you
[51:39] know, I'll be one of the first, I'll
[51:40] gladly be somebody that could accept it,
[51:43] Lord God.
[51:44] [Music]
[51:45] So Lord, we thank you for your love and
[51:47] your mercy, Lord. But certainly we're
[51:48] hearing what the Holy Spirit has said to
[51:50] the church tonight. Hallelujah.
[51:54] Is to love you with all of our hearts,
[51:55] soul, mind, and strength. Confess all of
[51:58] our sins, Lord. To know that we're
[52:00] totally forgiven. And there is a body
[52:03] waiting for us, Lord God.
[52:06] A building not with or a building not
[52:08] made with man's hands, but knit together
[52:11] with the hands of Almighty God. Those
[52:14] eternal hands, Lord God. We're grateful
[52:16] for that tonight, Lord God. Father, we
[52:19] ask your blessing here as we sing and
[52:21] worship, Lord God.
[52:24] Thank you, God, for helping me to watch
[52:26] the time. And I just pray God that
