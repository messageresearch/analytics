brother comes we'll invite our brother dennis to come minister god's word how many appreciate his sacrifice to come up from south carolina thank god so great to have him here it just feels like he said like no time has passed it just seems like we can just pick up right where we left off and you know of course i talked to him a few weeks ago i had a real good talk there but let's just feed on the word of god tonight and see what the lord has in store uh you know god certainly spoke friday night and this morning and we saw some of the effects uh friday night in our home you know the some of the things that were said blessed our home and our family and we we needed to hear that by god's grace so the lord was really good to us so the lord has really blessed us uh especially use that sermon to help our families so we're grateful for god's grace so let's just sing one more song here and we'll invite our brother to come minister god's word let's sing what a fellowship what a joy divine leaning on the everlasting arms praise god amen oh i'm so glad to be leaning on jesus's arms tonight praise god [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and then there's another song they sing along those lines it says i learn how to lean [Laughter] i wasn't leaning when i first came in he started letting me go through some trials and i learned how to lean praise the lord and depend on him amen god bless you this is our final service for for this time here now so uh i might even call this a sermon net i don't think it's going to be that that long at all i just it's kind of a continuation from this morning uh i'm gonna use a different topic but it's gonna be along the same theme of uh now when i say the same thing going to be dealing with love amen so uh let's pray god just have his way let's bow heavenly father we thank you for all things you've kept us lord you've blessed our hearts father you failed us lord so god we just invite you again lord just to have your way hallelujah but i love that about your prophet's ministry lord his how he depended on you yes and lord his respect for you father god he he waited on you lord god and until you came and moved in your own way and father that's a lesson to us lord we desire that same thing father because we realize that's how you purpose for it to be once we realize that we can do nothing without you all we can do is wait on you so lord help us tonight we pray for those that are not here lord give them strength lord and everything they stand in need of you know all things father hallelujah granted we pray in jesus christ's name we ask you amen amen amen all right uh as an opening scripture let's go to first john chapter four and we're going to start at verse seven first john four starting at verse seven first john four starting at verse seven it says beloved let us love one another for god is for love is of god and everyone that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love in this was manifested the love of god toward us because that god sent his his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we loved god and i i want to emphasize this because it stood out to me as i was reading it yes he says herein is love not that we love god but that he loved us so he loved us when we didn't love him love him he loved us when we couldn't love him see that right yes okay so this is the love that he's talking about he says but but that he loved us and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins so now watch this in light of the emphasis that i just made he says beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another amen in what way even if somebody doesn't love you you'll be able to love them anyway regardless no man has seen god at any time he says if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us amen may the lord bless his word saints she may be seated so uh tonight we want to take a topic of the challenge of love the challenge of love amen how many realize that it's a challenge amen because what god is asking of us is is just so different than the course of the world what we grew up in what we grew up seeing all around us um is contrary of course to the first nature uh but it's it's just it's just quite different um but nonetheless though he's requiring it from us now that goes along what we said this morning because the love of god the bible says is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost right so that's and let me read this real quick because like i don't want to keep you long i'm just going to touch on a few key points that i feel led to and then we'll stop this is from the message of god projecting his love and i believe this he says love should govern the home how many believe that amen he says love is the greatest force that was ever put into the power of man a home that's not disciplined by love is not much of a home yeah and i want to say that a church that's not disciplined not by love is not much of a church praise the lord amen he says if the husband and wife doesn't solemnly love each other they cannot trust each other that's why i think that instead of resting our faith upon some emotion which is all right or some gift which is all right he says like shouting speaking with tongues or with other things that we take for saying that we have the holy spirit when we do this he says those things are all right but if we would come back to the principle love first and this is key we would come back to the principle love first and then those things i think our church would progress a lot faster if we would get god first and god is love he says now love is in two different words two different meanings in the greek he says one of them is filio called filio that's the love that you have for your wife he says agapo is is the love divine love now the love that you have for your wife he says and the love and the love of god is so contrary now i want to stop here for a moment because he's going to say something at the end of this that was it kind of hit me all right because uh we can account anything i'll say it in this way we can account anything to ourselves right we can say i have the love of god right but does that make it so you might want it but if you have it it speaks for itself it'll show itself it don't have to be spoken for and that's what i'm realizing more and more saints is like it really it really it really takes less talk you don't have to say a word you don't have to say nothing about what you have or who you are it'll manifest itself on its own because it's a living word living on the inside of you isn't that right amen amen you don't you don't have to say well uh you know i have the third pull no we'll see it that's right it'll be seen now god have to give he has to give individuals eyes to see right because somebody can look at the word made flesh and then not even see that it's the word made flesh if god allows your eyes to be closed they'll be closed and i believe also we touched upon a few things there with brother branham said god is so he just handles things in such a way until he'll actually cause things to be said and done in such a strange way until it'll cause people to become confused right he said it'll cause people to even leave that's right he said what is he doing he's fitting down the crowd and i believe he gave john 6 as an example jesus sat right there and here they are confused about what he just said eat my flesh drink my blood and they're sitting there reasoning upon that and then he steps to him and says something to make it even worse and he didn't explain nothing right that's right left them right there in their own internal battles over what he said because he know he knew of course because of who he was whoever was ordained to remain they were going to remain because he turned he turned to the disciples and said will you go also and peter he's like where are we going to thou alone has the words of eternal life and guess what saints i feel that same way about this message amen amen amen it's the word of god peter couldn't explain why he felt that way but it was god communicating with that seed that was on the inside of him and because that seed was present it dismissed everything that tried to cause him to think differently watch this though because people can say i have love but then sometimes when you listen to them and when you watch how they respond to things and how they handle people it just raises a little question in there i wonder if it's the real thing watch how he says this he says now the love that you have for your wife and the love that and the love and the love of god is so contrary just listen to this the love you have for your wife if a man would insult her you would kill him on the spot with filial love he says with that kind of a love of filial love he says but with agopo love you pray for his lost soul he says that's the difference then he goes on to say there's two different types of love and i'm almost sure that many of us has been deceived with having familial love and thinking it's a gobble love a love that comes from god it has certain characteristics about it yes praise the lord and that brings me to this next scripture here watch this now because this is love speaking and expressing these particular things to us watch what it says in luke chapter 6 starting at verse 27. amen amen amen how many realize the time that we're in that capstone it's the fullness of christ it's more than just the opening of all the church ages opening of all it's the fullness of christ here to express himself through a bride in these last days amen amen and we were made for this hour amen amen what i'm talking about is within every single one of us right now children is in you right now amen all we have to do is stay within his presence and even he comes in and helps us with that yes sir because we within ourselves we're not disciplined enough like we should be i thought i was going to preach on that brother hey man i've been ministering on the subject here on the hand of the diligent and uh i i was like lord is this the i and it didn't go that way so but nonetheless though we don't have the disciplines that we should and god has ways of pushing us and bringing us yes that's the purpose for trials right the purpose for trials is not to give us a hard time take us through mind battles make us feel oppressed depressed discouraged right no it's to bring us to a closer walk in relationship with christ you ever wonder why why am i going through this that's why he wants you to trust in him more he wants us to have a closer bond a stronger bond watch this verse 27 of luke chapter 6 it says but i say unto you which here he says love your enemies do good to them with which hate you i'm talking about the challenge of love so if he's saying love your enemies and do good to them that hate you we should understand then that god will allow enemies to arise in our lives we should understand that god will cause people or rather allow people to be anointed with spirits that have caused them to hate you but why does that happen many times we get confused because we see i'm reading this right i'm preaching it right but we're not always mindful of things as we should be especially if we haven't been consecrating ourselves or whatever the enemy can come in with a sneak attack and he'll hit us with a little sucker punch and it throw you off guard you get all disoriented you know what i mean like it really catches you off guard and you don't know what's going you got to gather yourself because it was a swift hit you didn't expect a punch from the enemy that you didn't see coming amen but watch god permits those things god will permit people it may even be for no reason at all he'll permit people to actually hate you right yes but what is it for it's for your growth amen yes sir it's for our growth isn't that right but at the time at the time we thinking like that because when somebody is persecuting you or or having a certain feeling as that of hate towards you amen you don't you don't register like that god got to help your mind to come into the right channel of thoughts because outside of that we'll take it as flesh on flesh i don't know why they hate me and if you're not careful it'll lead you into a certain space and place that actually drive the spirit of god away from you that's right so god permits these things our saints as lessons it's the only real lessons we we got it's like he teaches us through life's experiences but it's a challenge see because when somebody is hating you and for whatever the reason might be that's come about man it hurts you can feel like why are you treating me like this why you feel that way to what what did i do to you it leaves you feeling like that yes sir but god is sitting there watching the whole thing and he's letting you go through it yes sir amen he says love your enemies he says do good to them which hate you so it's bad enough that they hate you so now he's requiring us to turn around and do good to right them you know they hate you and here you are driving down the road and you see them broke down you drive back and you drive by that like you don't see him like you look like something interesting on this side of the street no god listen god will permit those kinds of situations put you in a place amen the way his word can be made manifest but when that right love is not in our hearts being shed abroad by the holy ghost we'll have carnal reactions bless them that curse you isn't that something you're being cursed you're being slandered yes and god says bless them all the feelings and the thoughts on the inside of you because of of how they're coming against you or whatever the case might be it's contrary to that but when the love of god is in our hearts since it'll oppress us so much we won't be able to get away from it that's just how you won't be able to get away from it you may respond listen i'm not gonna say that you can't initially have a wrong response that's right that's exactly right but when that love is in there when god is in your soul dwelling in your soul you won't be able to continue like that that's right amen amen he'll even have you go and apologize why because it's a display of royalty yes remember character is not given it's a victory if it's a victory that means there has to be a fight there has to be a challenge there has to be opposition isn't that right that god permits because if he's requiring this character then he's saying i'm allowing these obstacles these challenges these conditions to come about in your life because of the calling i have in your life you ordain to manifest me clearly more than any other age before amen as we come down to verse 31 same chapter he says and as you would that men should do to you do ye also to them likewise so based off of how somebody handles you or deals with you in a given situation if it's in a way that you don't appreciate then god is saying now you turn around and you deal with them in a way that you would appreciate being dealt with it's a challenge you have to be willing to die i say that saints because in my experiences i've seen to where i've seen places where people they're here they've heard many times over as yourselves these same things they know that the bible says that if you don't forgive you won't be forgiven they know that but people sit and harbor feelings and unforgiveness in their hearts and say they know the scripture but you say you know it but you don't act like you know it so i don't think you really know it it hasn't struck you yet because if it really hits you you will you will quickly repent you will quickly go to your knees you will quickly actual forgiveness you will try to make things right if it really is in your heart that you really understand like you say you do that's what i'm talking about is more than just talking yes everybody going oh i love you i love you i'm okay okay okay let it be put to a challenge and that's that it'll show what's on the inside then it'll show what what what's really in there yes verse 32 says for if ye love them which love you he says what thank have you for sinners also love those that love them isn't that something watch this things it goes a little deeper because we have all kinds of oppositions and all kinds of things that rise up against us and in our hearts in our natural way of thinking the best way to to to to deal with certain kinds of trouble is to avoid it so if a person has become troublesome to you then your resort is i can just stay out of their way i ain't got to see him i ain't got to talk to him i ain't got to shake the hand i ain't got to do none of that now it's done right it's solved but in god's sight when i was in boot camp marine corps boot camp we had to go through every obstacle you couldn't run around none of them and it was a challenge yeah the one i had the hardest time with was climbing the road because you had to have a technique with how you use both of your feet together to kind of climb and then be able to hold yourself at a certain point so you can go up and climb some more then you raise your feet up and lock them in together with the rope it'll hold you and you can climb up some more and i just couldn't get that foot action so when i got to the ropes i just use all all arm strength i just go to the top and come down but one time a drill instructor was right there at the base and i got to the obstacle and i was going up and i hit the top he said what did you just do i said i climbed the road he said no huh and he made me sit there and practice that foot technique until i got it how many realize that's how god is he don't let you bypass no obstacles amen if you're meant to go through it you're gonna sit there and learn what it is he wants you to learn until you can pass it successfully ain't no way around it right praise god let's go on down if you do good to them which do good to you what think have you he says for sinners also do even the same you see the calling yeah everybody else is like that but that's not listen that's not how i am so what he's expressing here is exactly how he loved those that didn't love him he's good to those that are not good to him and it's it's not it's not a struggle right you understand it's just a natural flow by naked and if ye lend to them of whom ye hope to receive what think have you but sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again now this is a lesson i learned a long time ago because people don't always pay you back like they're supposed to and versus me getting all twisted up in the night i say okay this is what i'll do i'm gonna let you have whatever i ain't gonna miss cause then i'm gonna handle mine i ain't gonna have no mind battles about you not paying my money back that was i'm like that's my way and that that's helped me for quite some time amen but we ain't talking about that here we're talking about the real thing he's talking about actually having the love of god so he's speaking this to them but he knew full well whomever i'm speaking this to in order for them to manifest that they got to go all the way to pentecost because once they hit there they'll receive the power and the goods to be able to live this word so he was he was teaching them a high standard but he knew as he was teaching them this is only for those that are predestinated amen nobody else will be able to live this kind of a life they'll try but you know how it is when you're trying to do something you get tired you get weary with it and you put it down amen it don't last it fizzles out it sparks then it fizzles right that's the truth that's what i'm talking about now all right he says but love your enemies and do good and land hoping for nothing again and your rewards shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to who isn't that something and the reason why he's presenting this like this saints is because he knows that we come from him so whatever he is like i said it's within us to be that same exact thing it's already in you we just got to lay in his presence praise the lord amen all right i'm about to stop amen i got this one particular thing here i want to leave with you there's no point in just continuing on with the thought because the bulk of what i it ties in with this morning and and it's it's flowing along pretty nicely where the lord is allowing me to hit these key things here so i'm just going with this flow and i feel led to stop so but i just want to kind of leave you with a few nuggets here this right here is from the message of love and this is the part here where he's dealing with the maniac but just listen to how this this plays out he says so the man got real close to me and the people just hushed and he draw back his now this was a an ordained trial it was a challenge amen but the lord had equipped this prophet but it took this to be able to bring it out to display it so it could be an example for you and i today amen and he draws back his great his his great um his great hope oh man and he draws back his great he says hawk and spit all over my face it says he said you snake in the grass i'm going to show you how much of a servant of god you are i'm going to knock you way out in the middle of that audience he says he was well able to keep his threat he says but he didn't know god he says that was the main thing i kept real still never said a thing and my heart and i notice he just got his face just got spit in but under this anointing of love under this agape law of anointing watch where his thoughts were he says and my heart was going out to him with spit dripping down his skin it never even phased him that wasn't an act that wasn't a put on that's something that you got to have it takes you out of a carnal frame of mind it takes you completely out of it it's just the mind of god now here he is with spit dripping down his face he says and my heart was going out to him now you just can't imagine that it's got to be real the people have seen so much put on love till they're sick and tired of it [Music] he says be what you are if you're a christian be one god's grace will make you will make you one he says and the man walked closer to me and i loved him with spit dripping down his face the man walked close to me he said and i loved him and he was threatening brother branham he hated him the enemy of satan was on the inside of him having full control and this wasn't an act he ain't just saying good words for the sake of the audience for the sake of us is going to read it on down the line no he's talking about what was actually happening on the inside of him he was honestly giving a confession look this is what was going on yes he says i he says and i loved him because i knew i knew he didn't mean that that sounds familiar remember calvary remember i believe it was stephen stephen was being hit with stones that was breaking his bones he was dying but look at what came out of his mouth the same thing that came out of the mouth of the one that was hanging on the cross yes amen he asked for their forgiveness let it not be laid to their charge yes how that was by that was that love see brother branham said it's two kinds he said the love that you have for your wife fill your love it'll cause you to kill a man that insults her but under a different kind of love with that same man that same match it'll cause you to pray for his sinful soul amen praise the lord amen he says i thought it's the devil that makes that man say that he's the man who would love his family like i do mine he would he he would like to eat and drink and fellowship but the thing of it is is because the devil has possessed him he's a human being the same as i am those kind of thoughts so he's saying he's saying this but it was something that was just taking control he says and you and you can't do this unless god does it for you and when he got close to me he drew back his arms and he said i'm going to knock you out into the middle of the audience and break every bone in your little body old frail body of yours he says i never even opened my mouth and said a word so it spoke for itself what i just said you understand man amen the only way that we can enter into this like we're supposed to it's just to give ourselves more to god period amen just every day just try to live as close to him as possible allow his grace to work freely in our lives and then it'll just be there when it's supposed to be there you don't try to work yourself into it don't try to become you know just relax because for you you will come right into it amen notice how he says this and i'ma stop with this by the grace of god he says cause we're in the last days where the bible exalted much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves together in heavenly places in christ jesus and love one another this will all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for the other that's right stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sisters say lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up he says because it'll affect him it'll take the christ right out of my life see satan don't want us to be mindful of these kind of things if somebody do something wrong to you he won't he want bitterness to be there i had a situation recently and it was just it's like something's wrong it was a way that a person was talking to me and whatever they never told me nothing was wrong or whatever but it's just when i when i would hear them talk to me or something it was just something about like something ain't right and today i was in a room and i was praying and everything and and and and when they spoke their voice had the tone of wounds in it i can hear wounds i can hear bitterness beyond what the actual words were that they were speaking and certain little slight actions just really it's been it's actually been troubling me in my heart since i've been here so as i'm preaching to you i've been asking god to help me because i can't even think of what i could have done and i'm not going to go into detail about anything but it's just like my heart is a little trouble because you like to get along with people you know what i mean and when somebody begin to handle you in a certain way and you're clueless it's like man what's going on and i i it's something that i'm seeing but at the same time you just kind of like you got to let it ride you know the lord allows things like i said to come up to see your reaction yes yes if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister lord don't let me never let have the root of bitterness springing up it'll affect him it'll take the christ right out of my life that poison assets of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the holy spirit right away from you this is the one this is why the enemy has been working so much in that way he's always done that but he his atmosphere his breeding ground is that of of hatred of confusion of fussing and fighting and division where those things are permitted or being yielded to he's just that's his breeding ground that's his playground this is why so many strange things are taking place and we have to be in a certain place with god because remember it was told to brother branham nothing can make it here without perfect love because that's how the victory is gained the victory that brings about true character is gain amen through that perfect love that comes by the holy ghost and you're going to have challenges you're going to have things face you face to face that you got to deal with right and in order for you to be able to make it there successfully because ain't no failures going there no spiritual failures only spiritual overcomers and how do we overcome saints is through the grace and love of god in our hearts which is connected to the faith praise the lord yeah i can preach it but lord have mercy on me let this thing come alive and brother mcbride so y'all think of me i'll say lord help brother mcbride bless him lord and i'll be doing the same it'll run him from the tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything he says don't you do that he goes on and say just wax he says just white you just wax that much closer and together draw up take take the buckle uh as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle seeing it in a vision just just that buckles on the whole armor of god just pull just pull her on tighten up move close move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and god will bless you see that's his atmosphere amen when he sees that that that in your heart and i'll share this as i close it it really touched me some time ago my son dennis he um that's my oldest son you know i would teach him you know to try to handle things right and you know even if somebody is mean to you not be mean to them and so on and so forth you know he was much younger of course and he came to me one day and he was like you know dad he said um you know uh the kids you know they would make fun of them sometimes you know just kids being kids and make fun of them sometimes but one time one kid punched him in a stomach and he was looking at me telling me about it and he looked at me and he was like dad i you know i didn't hit him back dad i you know i and it's like he was trying to hold to my words amen i was like boy that i was like lord have mercy on me me being a natural father and he is my son trying his best to hold to what his daddy said [Music] in a time like that when he's being treated like that and he preached to me yeah praise the lord yes sir amen so saints be encouraged um we've experienced a lot it's a lot going on but you just got to buckle up because there's more to come amen but for as much as satan begins to express himself god is here to express more of himself amen that's the whole purpose for all of this is to bring that push that bride into her promised land to her positions amen and then once that display of god is made known and revealed and shown forth in the way that he sees fit then we out of here amen yes so let's just keep one another in prayer amen and and that the grace of god and continue to help us and keep us and even though we pray god already knows all these things and he's going to do every bit of it he's watching over us he's keeping us and he'll continue to keep us right but he has us to do these things for our benefit he has us to pray for our benefit because he already knows everything they're going to ask for we ask it but it's our way of taking time to communicate with him yes praise the lord so god bless you saints amen it's been a blessing to be here um to share the thoughts that in my heart i felt i felt god was leading me to share and i'm not doing the ministry no justice at all i believe god wants to do so much more you know when i just want to be able to to be able to surrender myself so he could do that that's my only desire so it's been good to be here to see each one of you again and some for the first time for a lot of the kids amen that's good let's see everybody again so god bless you strengthen you and keep you until we see one another again either here on the other side amen god bless you amen actually let's just stand so i can pray heavenly father we thank you lord it is a challenge lord god but you've equipped us lord to meet the challenge yes father for whatever it is that needs to be brought to life within us father you are here to do it so lord everything will happen in this right time just help us in our hearts to just focus in upon you and again just to be more humble on a day-to-day basis father more than what we have before [Music] looking to you lord god asking that your will be done and not ours because we don't know what's best for us lord many of us should be traveling lord over the next day or so father we pray that you just grant traveling mercies to each one of us lord as it was spoken already lord for sister and the only father in our family lord god we know and believe that you hear our prayers so lord we know that you already got it under control fathers we thank you all ready for what you will do the way you will make foreign [Music] you commit this prayer unto your father jesus christ [Music] is [Music] my
