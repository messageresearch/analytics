[35:55] let's go to Second Kings chapter 13 by
[35:58] the grace of God second Kings chapter
[36:00] 13.
[36:01] I was thinking about this weekend
[36:04] you know what brother Diggs coming in I
[36:05] know he's a evangelist and
[36:08] uh
[36:09] Faith faith-building kind of preacher so
[36:11] I thought I'd preach some Faith tonight
[36:13] by God's grace just try to build your
[36:15] faith by the grace of the Lord
[36:17] you know we like I like to do series I
[36:19] like to teach right from the scripture
[36:21] as brother Ram said that's so important
[36:22] because it gives you a foundation praise
[36:24] God it puts you in position and you know
[36:27] where you're standing with God I'd like
[36:29] to by God's grace just a message on
[36:31] faith here tonight I'd like to just
[36:33] speak this I preach this quite a number
[36:35] of years ago nine years ago and I want
[36:37] to kind of update it uh I preached the
[36:40] arrow of God's Deliverance I'd like to
[36:42] preach that tonight by God's grace the
[36:44] era of God's Deliverance
[36:46] Second Kings 13.
[36:48] verse 14.
[36:51] so listen brother random preach this
[36:53] just a short message that he preached
[36:54] there in 1956
[36:57] this beautiful message
[36:59] and brought the prayer line it was
[37:01] really really sweet message by God's
[37:02] grace
[37:11] Second Kings 13 verse 14.
[37:19] now I'll read by the grace of God why
[37:21] don't we read
[37:25] I'll read 13
[37:27] I'm sorry I read 14 and 15.
[37:31] we'll all read 16 and then I'll read 17
[37:33] it's a little longer there but so you'll
[37:35] just read 16 with me all right so verse
[37:38] 14 says now Elisha was Fallen sick of
[37:41] his sickness where have he died
[37:45] so in this in this case God didn't heal
[37:46] Elisha from that final sickness like
[37:48] with every other person normally right
[37:51] yet he was a prophet of God
[37:53] did twice as many miracles as Elijah
[37:56] and joash the king of Israel came down
[37:58] unto him and wept over his face and said
[38:00] o my father my father The Chariot of
[38:03] Israel and the horsemen thereof
[38:06] and Elisha said unto him take bow and
[38:09] arrows and he took unto him bow and
[38:12] arrows let's read let's read verse 16.
[38:14] ready one two three and he said to the
[38:17] king of Israel put thine hand upon the
[38:20] bow and he put his hand upon it and
[38:24] Elisha put his hands upon the king's
[38:27] hands now I'll read 17 it's a little bit
[38:29] longer there but and he said open the
[38:31] window Eastward and he opened it then
[38:33] Elisha said shoot and he shot and he
[38:36] said the arrow of the Lord's Deliverance
[38:39] and the arrow of deliverance from Syria
[38:42] for Thou shalt Smite the syrians in afec
[38:45] till thou have consumed them Hallelujah
[38:50] how many enjoy the word of God tonight
[38:52] may God has blessing the Ring of his
[38:54] word maybe seated praise God
[39:00] so I'll take this thought and preach
[39:01] this back on September of ninth sorry
[39:05] 2014 not 19.
[39:07] 2014. so it's almost been almost been 10
[39:10] years by God's grace
[39:12] I don't know if anybody was there when I
[39:13] preached it that's here maybe Jose just
[39:15] come in there
[39:16] I'm pretty sure my wife was there
[39:19] you know sometimes I mess with the sick
[39:21] kids
[39:22] so I want to kind of update this I had a
[39:24] few thoughts about that and you know
[39:25] with uh like I said brother Diggs coming
[39:27] in I wanted to kind of reach a message
[39:28] that would just raise your faith by the
[39:30] grace of God it's been raised in my
[39:31] faith
[39:33] um and then you know with sister Naomi
[39:34] traveling and you know just all the
[39:36] pressures that come with travel and I
[39:37] thought it'd be another good reason to
[39:39] preach some Faith by God's grace
[39:41] so we're thankful for God's Amazing
[39:43] Grace
[39:46] this week by God's grace or Saturday I
[39:48] put out that video about the 9th and
[39:50] 10th lie out of Jeffersonville then
[39:52] today I put out the first video about
[39:53] how Jim Jones did not believe brother
[39:55] Ram's message so kind of ended last
[39:57] Wednesday's sermon with that thought and
[40:01] so getting those things out there and
[40:02] there's been a few people that have been
[40:04] thankful you know they had questions
[40:05] about these things and I just thank God
[40:07] that the holy spirit is here to give us
[40:09] answers
[40:10] and uh you know what's really shocking
[40:13] to see which I'm sure you're familiar
[40:14] with most people won't even research to
[40:17] see if what a person's saying is true
[40:20] in other words there's not many fact
[40:21] Checkers out there
[40:23] right but thank God we can check the
[40:26] facts praise God and all the facts go
[40:28] back to the word of God
[40:30] so if you're interested in those those
[40:32] are out there by the grace of God
[40:34] Hallelujah
[40:36] and so let's look at this you know uh
[40:37] we'll background this here a little bit
[40:38] by the grace of the Lord
[40:40] and uh uh I'm not sure how long this
[40:42] will be you know we'll kind of see how
[40:43] it goes so we find in this uh scripture
[40:47] here we're looking at the time of the
[40:49] Prophet Elisha of course we know he
[40:51] followed Elijah and Elisha had a double
[40:54] portion of the Holy Spirit on him by the
[40:58] grace of God and that because that's
[40:59] what he asked for
[41:01] I think it's I think it's wonderful
[41:02] church that you know if a man or woman
[41:04] is truly dedicated to God God will give
[41:07] them the desire of their heart
[41:08] that's all Elisha wanted he just wanted
[41:11] a double portion of what he had
[41:14] and remember church he was willing to
[41:16] sell out ever he was willing to to kill
[41:19] his oxen he was willing to totally in
[41:21] other words totally cut off his own life
[41:24] in order to get that blessing
[41:27] he cut off everything from his past life
[41:29] sold out everything in order to get the
[41:31] desire of his heart
[41:33] praise God
[41:35] now Church there could be no greater
[41:36] desire of anyone's heart than to see
[41:38] your loved one saved in heaven praise
[41:40] God is that right we know that's what a
[41:41] Hattie Wright asked for she could add a
[41:43] million dollars
[41:44] she could have had lots of she could
[41:45] have the health of her family or her
[41:47] parents or her sister Edith who's in a
[41:48] wheelchair but she asked for salvation
[41:51] praise God and God granted to her so we
[41:54] see the most valuable thing any of us
[41:57] could desire tonight would be eternal
[41:59] life
[41:59] because you can have all miracles will
[42:02] be good but the Bible says in First
[42:03] Corinthians 13 you can have all that and
[42:05] if you don't have love it doesn't profit
[42:07] you anything
[42:08] you can cast out Devils you can move
[42:10] mountains you can do all these things
[42:11] but without the love of God it doesn't
[42:13] profit us anything
[42:15] so the thing we should do constantly is
[42:16] look at ourselves and make sure we got
[42:18] the love of God float out of our lives
[42:21] right and that's ministering to others
[42:23] as treating others as we treat ourselves
[42:26] right
[42:27] that's important that's the that's the
[42:29] very heart of Christianity praise God
[42:31] treating others the way you want to be
[42:33] treated Hallelujah
[42:35] but this is what Elisha asked for he
[42:37] asked for a double portion and God gave
[42:39] it to him brother said that the type of
[42:41] Christ and the church
[42:44] now it's not a perfect type like we
[42:46] looked at a few weeks ago right Sunday
[42:47] school girls
[42:49] because does the church have twice as
[42:51] much Holy Ghost as Jesus
[42:53] no so see how the type doesn't work
[42:55] that it's an incomplete type the type
[42:58] that does work is that the bride or the
[43:00] body of Christ does more Works than
[43:02] Jesus
[43:03] right because the bride has
[43:05] more time to do it and it's Jesus in The
[43:08] Bride
[43:10] for two thousand years rather than three
[43:12] and a half
[43:13] praise God
[43:14] but you got to watch your types there
[43:16] right you got to keep your Bible
[43:18] straight Hallelujah I'm supposed to be
[43:20] preaching Faith tonight okay so let me
[43:22] let me preach Faith here I'm trying to
[43:24] get down to these rightly divided I
[43:25] better preach Faith so forgive me
[43:26] anyways joash King joash here now
[43:30] there's a couple of couple ways to say
[43:31] his name
[43:33] uh there's a couple different ways in
[43:35] the scripture because there's Kings and
[43:36] there's Chronicles that write about some
[43:37] of the same events but just to give you
[43:39] an idea it seems here uh that this King
[43:43] was either the fourth or fifth
[43:45] generation after Ahab
[43:48] and uh King joash here was he was on the
[43:51] side of the northern part of Israel
[43:54] not Judah
[43:56] and how many remember how many good
[43:57] kings were on the Northern side anybody
[43:59] remember Lydia got it
[44:01] zero
[44:03] there is no good Kings on the Northern
[44:05] side of Israel
[44:07] right you started with jeroboam right
[44:09] and you go all the way down pretty soon
[44:11] you get Eli zimmery Omri and then Ahab
[44:16] brother Ram said no one seldom the Bible
[44:18] says no one selled out the Lord like
[44:20] Ahab did because of his wife Jezebel
[44:22] right a type of the Jezebel spirit that
[44:24] spirit's on the Roman Catholic Church
[44:27] right now either four because there's
[44:29] some of these names are similar uh the
[44:32] king here in the Days of Elijah was
[44:33] either four or five Kings after Ahab so
[44:37] in other words Church it wasn't getting
[44:38] any better
[44:40] it was getting worse
[44:42] right and then if you count from from
[44:44] this King there's either there's either
[44:47] eight or eight or seven more Kings left
[44:50] before they're all done with in Northern
[44:52] Israel
[44:53] until they're carried off
[44:56] until they fall to Samaria in 722 BC
[45:01] so brother M calls him a lukewarm king
[45:04] or a backslitting king if you listen to
[45:06] that sermon from 1956. he calls him a
[45:09] backslitting king
[45:11] may God help our lives so that no one
[45:14] ever calls us backslidden Hallelujah may
[45:17] we be so sincere before God that we're
[45:19] not called backslidden we won't accept a
[45:21] backseat in life and the church said
[45:24] because it's up to you and I right we
[45:26] get whatever we ask for
[45:28] right we pray to God the Bible said you
[45:30] have not because you asked not
[45:32] so if we don't want to be back soon
[45:34] let's pray Lord let my fire burn
[45:36] brighter amen
[45:38] stir me up on a Wednesday night or a
[45:40] Sunday night or a Sunday morning stir me
[45:42] up Lord don't let me become backstage
[45:44] and praise God
[45:45] you promised you give me the desire of
[45:47] my heart amen is that right
[45:49] so we got to ask with faith believing
[45:51] praise God we've got to ask confessing
[45:53] our faith Hallelujah confessing the word
[45:55] of God also confessing our sins
[45:59] and so we see you know that uh actually
[46:01] you know the scripture records in Second
[46:03] Kings that King joash here or is also
[46:07] name is jehosh is also another way to
[46:09] say his name
[46:11] he was actually uh
[46:14] the Bible said that he tolerated the
[46:16] worship
[46:17] of the golden calves
[46:20] okay so that was the bad thing against
[46:23] him the scripture records he did evil in
[46:25] the sight of the Lord
[46:27] so we find he was backslidden he's a lot
[46:30] like his great great great great
[46:33] predecessor King Ahab
[46:36] and he allowed idol worship a church
[46:39] we've got to be very careful in our
[46:41] lives not to let Idols into our lives
[46:44] whether it's money or whether it's
[46:47] popularity or whether it's a a spouse or
[46:52] a husband
[46:53] right or any anything at all we got to
[46:55] be very careful not to let Idols in
[46:58] Satan's very sly
[47:01] right
[47:02] he's no dummy they call him dumb Devil
[47:04] he's no dumb devil
[47:07] said he's smarter and brother Matt says
[47:09] time goes on he gets more sly
[47:11] because he learns more
[47:13] I got quotes on that I need to preach a
[47:15] sermon on that actually I want to make a
[47:16] video on that the dumb devil video where
[47:18] no one should call him that
[47:21] you don't see you don't even see Jesus
[47:22] doing that you don't see Michael the
[47:23] Archangel doing that he just says the
[47:24] Lord rebuke you Satan
[47:26] right
[47:28] we've got to be very careful not to let
[47:30] certain things become idols
[47:33] right you gotta be very careful because
[47:36] we can all have idols
[47:39] food becomes Idol for a lot of people in
[47:40] America
[47:42] right food so Comfort becomes an idol
[47:45] you'll do anything just to be more
[47:46] comfortable right
[47:48] that becomes an idol
[47:50] and so let's not think well well brother
[47:52] jesser you know Sister so-and-so none of
[47:54] us could ever have Idols it's actually
[47:56] quite the opposite
[47:58] Paul I'm sorry John the Revelator and
[48:01] Paul warn us not to have Idols to flee
[48:04] from idols
[48:06] right
[48:07] in fact the Corinthians you know what
[48:08] their Idols were some of them were
[48:10] preachers
[48:14] one said I'm of I'm a cephas
[48:17] I'm a Peter man
[48:19] I'm of Apollos I'm Apollos man
[48:22] now today it might be I'm a Donnie
[48:24] Reagan man I'm a Ron Spencer man now
[48:26] nobody says I'm a Jesse Smith man so I
[48:28] don't I don't need to put my name in
[48:29] there
[48:32] but people have all kinds if they're not
[48:34] careful they'll make a preacher an idol
[48:36] see if Satan can't get you to go out and
[48:37] and you know make something sinful and
[48:40] Idol cigarette or alcohol or marijuana
[48:42] then he'll try to get you to make a
[48:44] preacher an idol
[48:46] right gotta be very careful in other
[48:48] words whatever that preacher says that's
[48:50] gospel
[48:51] well be careful we want to respect God's
[48:53] service but we also don't want to
[48:54] worship God's servants
[48:57] right
[48:59] so let's not think well I could never be
[49:01] like this King let's try to gain
[49:03] something from this text I mean brother
[49:04] man preach it to the people the people
[49:06] received it and I believe you and I can
[49:08] receive something from it as well praise
[49:09] God
[49:10] now let's go to the scripture I don't
[49:12] know how long I'm going to be I might
[49:13] preach half an hour we'll see
[49:16] we'll see if that's even possible verse
[49:19] 14.
[49:24] I got a little runny nose myself here
[49:26] but Overcoming By God's grace
[49:28] verse 14. now Elisha was falling sick of
[49:32] his sickness whereof he died
[49:35] see God doesn't always heal right some
[49:38] people say God always heals God always
[49:39] heals God always wants to heal this case
[49:41] he didn't when he died God didn't want
[49:43] to heal Elijah actually he wouldn't take
[49:44] him home or you could say he wanted to
[49:46] heal him in a different way
[49:50] take him out of the the this pest house
[49:52] and put him into a theophany body that's
[49:54] a great healing praise God
[49:57] and joash the king of Israel came down
[49:59] unto him and wept over his face and said
[50:01] oh my father o my father the chair to
[50:03] Israel and the horsemen thereof now stop
[50:05] a moment
[50:07] what would it take for you to cry over
[50:09] somebody being sick who would it have to
[50:11] be so you'd cry over them
[50:14] that's when you know you're really that
[50:16] you you really love that person in other
[50:18] words
[50:19] when we've had prayer requests up here
[50:21] when was the last time somebody cried
[50:22] over the prayer request up here no I'm
[50:24] getting kind of serious
[50:26] I'm trying to build your faith too at
[50:28] the same time
[50:30] he comes down here this is a back
[50:32] sitting King
[50:33] he's allowing idolatry
[50:36] which are if you read earlier in the
[50:37] chapter the enemies syrians are coming
[50:39] against him
[50:41] so he's a man under pressure
[50:44] he's a man that feels threatened
[50:48] he's a vaccinating guy in other words
[50:50] they know that the Judah kings are good
[50:52] Kings they serve God but he knows we
[50:55] allow idols
[50:56] but now the pressure's on
[50:59] and he's starting to get real desperate
[51:01] for God
[51:02] sound familiar anybody
[51:04] sometimes we're not as diligent as we
[51:06] should be
[51:08] sometimes we let things come up in our
[51:10] lives that kind of distract us away from
[51:12] the service of the Lord
[51:14] like we should be I mean can we all say
[51:16] Amen to that I can say Amen to that
[51:19] and what is it and God in his Mercy
[51:21] allows us to get a trial
[51:24] like look like
[51:26] like I'll be honest even this you know
[51:28] recent news about uh is the are they
[51:31] going to be able to the the debt ceiling
[51:33] is that going to be able to raise the
[51:34] debt ceiling and I saw a few videos
[51:36] there people are warning oh this is the
[51:38] time of the crash now everything's going
[51:39] to crash now well that that shakes me a
[51:41] little bit I got to pray through that
[51:43] praise God
[51:45] I mean all these things I mean all of us
[51:46] are not immune to those things
[51:49] right and so God in his Mercy
[51:52] uh you know shows there's at least some
[51:54] reverence in this King
[51:56] even though he's fourth or fifth from
[51:58] Ahab he's got some reverence for God
[52:01] right
[52:03] and he hears the prophet of God is dying
[52:06] and like I said who was the last person
[52:09] you cried over when they were dying
[52:12] hopefully hopefully somebody you know
[52:14] you loved but see not everybody we're
[52:16] close to we're not we don't have
[52:17] feelings for everybody but I just want
[52:19] you to see what kind of respect would
[52:21] you have to have for a man or woman
[52:23] dying and you go there and cry over them
[52:28] like I just went to Mike McCloskey's I
[52:29] just wept and cried like a baby just
[52:31] seeing him in pain and he wasn't even
[52:32] dying
[52:34] that shows how much I love him praise
[52:35] God
[52:39] but hear the king
[52:41] he wepts over his face
[52:45] and he said oh my father my father The
[52:47] Chariot of Israel and the horsemen
[52:49] thereof
[52:51] this sound familiar
[52:53] this was spoken right when Elijah was
[52:55] going up to heaven
[52:58] this is
[53:00] so joash is King Josh is repeating what
[53:02] Elijah said or what I'm sorry what
[53:04] Elisha said about Elijah
[53:09] I remember when Perry green died and uh
[53:11] brother
[53:13] Stephen Shelley put that on you Facebook
[53:15] right you remember that brother Jose
[53:18] Peregrine was dying and he put that
[53:20] script he said put those words up there
[53:21] oh my father my father the chair to
[53:23] Israel and the horsemen thereof
[53:25] that's a very respectful thing to say
[53:27] what this is saying
[53:30] this is actually a compliment to the
[53:32] prophet of God
[53:33] this is saying oh my father you're our
[53:36] leader and your presence with us is
[53:38] greater than every Chariot and every
[53:41] military might in other words the power
[53:43] of God that's with you is more important
[53:45] than any natural weapon that we have
[53:47] amen
[53:49] the horses of Israel the chairs thereof
[53:51] that's your that's your military power
[53:54] but this prayer is oh God has taken this
[53:56] man off the scene
[53:59] he's a mighty man of God
[54:01] and he cries out to God he's weeping oh
[54:03] God don't take your Prophet yet God took
[54:05] our prophet in 1965.
[54:08] before any of us were even around right
[54:12] and he is so sincere he weeps over his
[54:16] face the Bible said he weeps over his
[54:18] face I don't know if you take that
[54:19] litter or not
[54:21] but he cries out to God he said this he
[54:23] said in other words I thank you God for
[54:24] this man he's been more important to us
[54:27] than all our weapons and all of our
[54:29] natural military force and brother man
[54:32] in this sermon says he says Church don't
[54:34] you know that the Holy Ghost Field
[54:35] church is more powerful than all the
[54:38] atomic bombs America can produce praise
[54:41] God
[54:46] [Applause]
[54:49] a Praying Church a church that loves the
[54:51] Holy Ghost a church that loves a worship
[54:54] and give God praise and pray pray people
[54:56] or pray with people until they get the
[54:58] Holy Ghost like we just saw in Napoleon
[54:59] praise God a church that does that is
[55:02] most important at keeping this nation
[55:04] protected praise God
[55:07] Hallelujah let's not forget you're
[55:10] highly favored here tonight Church
[55:13] let's not forget that I was testified
[55:15] again to my Barbers tonight all these
[55:16] wonderful testimonies God has done he
[55:18] was telling me a good testimony he had
[55:20] to God provided
[55:22] uh during covet you know The Barbers
[55:24] lost their job right and he's like where
[55:26] am I going to get money and he said one
[55:28] of the last guys that came in or no one
[55:30] of the guys that come in he said this
[55:31] guy was an old man and he he snotted all
[55:34] the time and he couldn't hear so look I
[55:36] was like he was yelling all the time and
[55:38] he was the hardest customer to have
[55:41] he said but when covert hit he has the
[55:44] barber has three kids he said he didn't
[55:45] have any job you know how they shut down
[55:47] for all these I mean everyone was
[55:49] essential workers except McDonald's and
[55:50] Burger King
[55:51] everybody else was essential worker
[55:53] other than those guys yet they let them
[55:55] work
[55:57] but The Barbers were essential although
[55:58] the government said no but anyways this
[56:01] this hard customer
[56:04] uh he calls him up a few weeks after
[56:05] that and said hey do you need any money
[56:07] he's like no he said
[56:09] he said that's fine he said let me give
[56:10] you 500 dollars
[56:12] and so this old man who was the hardest
[56:14] customer
[56:15] uh ever to to deal with gave him 500 the
[56:19] man died two days later
[56:21] so you can ask Josh about that next week
[56:24] and he said he called the wife up and
[56:26] give it back and she's like no he won we
[56:27] talked about it we and we wanted to give
[56:28] it to you as a blessing to you
[56:30] and just a beautiful example of God
[56:32] providing
[56:34] so I got to share my testimonies too
[56:36] that's it oh it's testimony time for
[56:37] he's got it in the barbershop now if
[56:39] only you turn off that rock and roll
[56:40] music we'll be all right
[56:43] but I think it's just a beautiful
[56:44] testimony Church of just remembering how
[56:46] faithful God is to us aren't you glad
[56:48] God's faithful
[56:49] God think about all the time in your
[56:51] life how God has provided for you
[56:54] shows up when you didn't expect it
[56:57] praise God Amen shows up when you when
[56:59] you need it the most praise God that's
[57:01] our God Amen
[57:03] that's what he does that's who he is
[57:04] amen hallelujah he just shows up
[57:09] and he proves himself faithful he proves
[57:11] himself he's worthy to be trusted praise
[57:14] God
[57:15] amen
[57:17] Hallelujah
[57:19] like I was telling this Austin this
[57:21] testimony there's this there's this this
[57:23] church I've been helping overseas for a
[57:25] few years in Uganda I was telling Austin
[57:27] this testimony
[57:28] this woman was asking for money you know
[57:30] uh
[57:32] for for pesticides because our church by
[57:35] God's grace has helped them out uh some
[57:38] of the people are starving so we've
[57:40] we've sent love offerings over there
[57:41] they sent me the pictures and pastors
[57:43] sent me pictures
[57:44] uh to plant just wheat it's because they
[57:46] don't have wheat and the sister said can
[57:48] you send this money for pesticides I'm
[57:49] like sister I don't got it I said I
[57:51] can't have you begging me all the time I
[57:53] said I said but I said you pray and if
[57:55] the Lord sends me money I'll send you
[57:57] that money
[57:58] I said by the end of the day well I got
[58:00] home and I got a check and there was a
[58:02] check in the mail for a thousand dollars
[58:04] so I said okay I'll give you that little
[58:06] I said God heard your prayer sister
[58:08] Hallelujah I didn't send all a thousand
[58:12] but she asked for a certain amount and
[58:14] that's going to feed how many people is
[58:15] that going to feed
[58:16] by God's grace
[58:18] in other words call upon the Lord
[58:20] hallelujah and if it's God's will he'll
[58:23] hear an answer praise God
[58:25] I thought that was a beautiful testimony
[58:27] because I like I didn't even I really
[58:29] didn't expect it I just said you pray
[58:30] sister
[58:31] you know we've worked with her over the
[58:33] years her and these other Saints there
[58:34] in the church there and they constantly
[58:36] have starving people constantly have
[58:38] starving people there's a drought right
[58:40] but I just thought it's a good testimony
[58:42] call on the Lord hallelujah he's
[58:44] faithful praise God his ears are open to
[58:46] his children's cries amen thank God Amen
[58:50] but look at this man look at the king so
[58:53] a bachelor in person knows how to Humble
[58:55] himself and respect the prophet of God
[59:00] and so now we can apply this to
[59:02] ourselves even if we're struggling
[59:04] serving God and we all do
[59:07] yeah don't say you don't don't lie in
[59:08] church
[59:11] we all struggle
[59:13] so now we see a pattern right we see a
[59:15] pattern
[59:16] God's not a respecter of persons so even
[59:19] if somebody that's not where they should
[59:20] be if they'll just humble themselves
[59:24] and res show some respect to God in
[59:26] God's family
[59:27] oh amen praise God hallelujah if you
[59:31] just humble if we just humble ourselves
[59:33] show respect to the prophet of God
[59:35] brother random right of course but he's
[59:37] gone right so we show respect so what do
[59:39] we do brother show respect to the Holy
[59:41] Spirit he says amen
[59:44] in other words pray to Jesus worship
[59:46] Jesus humble yourself talk to Jesus
[59:48] Hallelujah
[59:50] or listen to a tape I mean I told you
[59:52] that one testimonial brother Elijah
[59:53] Gibbs from Connecticut
[59:55] his whole life when we saw his brother
[59:57] last year in Albion I saw his brother at
[59:59] the marriage banquet
[1:00:01] and he confirmed it his brother Elijah
[1:00:03] Gibbs was born with some defect in his
[1:00:05] leg he always walked with a limp but he
[1:00:07] was a preacher
[1:00:09] while listening to brother Branham he'd
[1:00:11] prayed for years God healed my leg the
[1:00:13] doctors couldn't do it he's listening to
[1:00:15] brother Branham in a chair
[1:00:17] brother Adam says something about you
[1:00:19] know healing a person with that same
[1:00:20] thing the Holy Spirit pushes him off his
[1:00:22] chair he falls down now imagine that
[1:00:28] doesn't doesn't very doesn't sound like
[1:00:29] the softest Angel's hands does that one
[1:00:31] sound like himself
[1:00:33] like Elijah Elijah got the angel with
[1:00:35] the softest hands
[1:00:37] let me put you to sleep Elijah
[1:00:40] he got pushed over in the chair and
[1:00:43] laying on the floor when he stood up he
[1:00:45] said his leg was completely made well
[1:00:47] his foot or whatever it was
[1:00:49] he said brother Jesse this message is
[1:00:51] right
[1:00:52] I said thank you I know too amen I
[1:00:55] haven't seen it like that but I know
[1:00:57] it's right
[1:00:58] Hallelujah and he's a wonderful brother
[1:01:00] he's just really good with the scripture
[1:01:02] he likes to rightly divide the word and
[1:01:03] we kind of lovingly debate back and
[1:01:05] forth
[1:01:05] he's a real fine brother I'll tell you
[1:01:07] one of the finest he started many
[1:01:09] churches over there too I shouldn't say
[1:01:10] many but a number of churches there in
[1:01:11] Connecticut
[1:01:14] and so that's the idea show respect to
[1:01:17] the word of God
[1:01:19] Hallelujah
[1:01:21] home in other words humble yourself the
[1:01:23] king could have stayed in church he
[1:01:24] could have stayed in his comfortable
[1:01:25] Palace
[1:01:27] he's going to stay there but he comes
[1:01:30] and sees a dying prophet
[1:01:32] and he gives such a compliment my father
[1:01:35] my father the Chariots of Israel and the
[1:01:38] horsemen thereof oh God in other words
[1:01:41] God please don't take your Prophet off
[1:01:42] the scene
[1:01:43] now for us it can be oh God send your
[1:01:46] spirit once more praise God
[1:01:48] oh God don't forget me in this hour
[1:01:50] trouble Lord we need you to move I need
[1:01:52] you now I need God to show up I need the
[1:01:55] anointing of God hallelujah
[1:01:57] show God some respect praise God
[1:02:01] that's right
[1:02:03] he basically said a lie Elisha was more
[1:02:06] valuable than all the military
[1:02:08] efforts right and all the power of the
[1:02:10] strength of Israel
[1:02:12] that's a good way to respect God LeBron
[1:02:14] says respect his word
[1:02:17] hallelujah respect the word of God
[1:02:21] and his servants
[1:02:23] look at verse 15. and Elisha said to
[1:02:25] them take bow and arrows and he took
[1:02:28] unto him bows and heirs now here here's
[1:02:29] a good lesson let's always obey the word
[1:02:31] of God
[1:02:33] he could have said no Prophet I'm not
[1:02:35] going to do that I'm not going to do
[1:02:36] what the prophet said I'm not going to
[1:02:37] do what the Bible said
[1:02:40] brother random said you want to grow in
[1:02:41] love with God okay what are the two
[1:02:43] things he said you can say it out loud
[1:02:45] read your Bible and
[1:02:47] now how many are doing that
[1:02:49] as consistently as possible because
[1:02:52] we're not legalists here
[1:02:53] but
[1:02:55] how many believe the prophet
[1:02:57] now I've seen that it's a reality as
[1:02:59] I've read my Bible and pray I love Jesus
[1:03:01] more
[1:03:03] how do you know because I keep serving
[1:03:05] him
[1:03:06] I don't walk away from him I don't walk
[1:03:08] away from his people
[1:03:10] hallelujah
[1:03:11] thank God how simple is that
[1:03:15] do what the prophet said Hallelujah obey
[1:03:17] the word of God follow the more in love
[1:03:19] with Jesus and you can't love Jesus
[1:03:21] without loving his people praise God
[1:03:22] brother I said that's the way you know
[1:03:24] people love Jesus because they love
[1:03:26] God's people praise God
[1:03:28] ah thank God bye that's beautiful
[1:03:33] thank God
[1:03:34] he said take the bow and arrows
[1:03:37] and he took unto him bow and arrows
[1:03:40] now you know the white horse rider and
[1:03:43] you know the scriptures too
[1:03:45] the Bible says that Satan strings his
[1:03:47] bow and shoots out lies with arrows
[1:03:50] and we have the shield of faith
[1:03:53] right to extinguish every fiery Dart I
[1:03:55] think I finished with that last week
[1:03:56] didn't I on Wednesday night or the night
[1:03:58] Wednesday before
[1:04:01] so so so arrows are likened unto attacks
[1:04:06] or lies but now that's for the devil but
[1:04:09] now God is going on the offensive here
[1:04:12] God's saying your word is like an arrow
[1:04:15] but really it's God's word in your mouth
[1:04:18] Hallelujah because you and I my words
[1:04:20] won't do nothing we've all tried it
[1:04:21] right
[1:04:22] speak Prosperity speak Prosperity name
[1:04:25] it and claim it that's it's not true
[1:04:27] it's got to be God's thought behind it
[1:04:29] praise God it's name What God Says and
[1:04:32] claim what God Said claim Hallelujah
[1:04:35] name and claim what God Said to name and
[1:04:37] claim right
[1:04:40] so see we're getting some good lessons
[1:04:42] here from this backslidden man who in
[1:04:45] just like Ahab mind just like Abram
[1:04:47] found a moment of sincerity
[1:04:50] he's weeping he's crying I need a
[1:04:52] miracle the walls they say the walls are
[1:04:54] closing in
[1:04:56] I got this nation over here Syria
[1:05:00] there's different ones uh they they name
[1:05:02] them by name later on we'll get to that
[1:05:03] in a moment but I've got pressure here
[1:05:05] things are starting to close them I'm
[1:05:07] feeling trapped uh I better start
[1:05:09] honoring God now yeah it's time to honor
[1:05:11] God now
[1:05:12] it's been time to honor God
[1:05:14] it's always time to honor God hallelujah
[1:05:17] but God works with us despite our
[1:05:19] weaknesses praise God
[1:05:21] amen
[1:05:22] verse 16.
[1:05:25] now look at this here and he said to the
[1:05:27] king of Israel put thine hand upon the
[1:05:29] bow
[1:05:31] and he put his hand upon it and Elijah
[1:05:34] put his hands upon the king's hands
[1:05:37] now this should sound real familiar to
[1:05:39] some Sunday school girls
[1:05:42] shouldn't it
[1:05:44] so the king puts his hands on the bow
[1:05:47] and then Elisha puts his hands on the
[1:05:50] bow
[1:05:52] Hallelujah remember a few uh Sundays ago
[1:05:55] when we did the crossing of the arms
[1:05:57] Hallelujah
[1:06:00] and what Jacob say Jacob said oh Joseph
[1:06:02] said Daddy
[1:06:04] you you know you you blessed the wrong
[1:06:06] one
[1:06:07] you cross your hands and Jacob said I
[1:06:10] didn't do it son God did it
[1:06:12] God crossed my hands
[1:06:15] God to control the hands but now in this
[1:06:17] case the king puts his hand on the bow
[1:06:20] but now the prophet puts his own hand on
[1:06:22] top that represents God's anointing is
[1:06:25] going to be with the king's hands
[1:06:30] strength in the king's hand church and
[1:06:32] you and I have no strength unless God
[1:06:34] puts his strength in our hands praise
[1:06:36] God
[1:06:38] Hallelujah
[1:06:42] just like all those you know just like
[1:06:43] shamgar use what's in your hand
[1:06:48] just like Samson this Jawbone is
[1:06:50] worthless unless God gets in it praise
[1:06:52] God can I say like this our lives and
[1:06:55] our testimonies are worthless unless God
[1:06:57] gets into it Hallelujah come on somebody
[1:06:59] amen
[1:07:01] our days are our routines our Earthly
[1:07:03] habits I mean it's all useless unless
[1:07:06] God steps in and God puts his hand on
[1:07:09] your hand amen
[1:07:11] if God puts his thought in your thought
[1:07:13] if God puts his word in your mouth
[1:07:16] Hallelujah
[1:07:17] now you're going to get somewhere praise
[1:07:19] God
[1:07:19] Hallelujah
[1:07:22] thank the Lord
[1:07:24] so you see the same thing here by the
[1:07:26] grace of the Lord
[1:07:27] same idea God takes control of the hand
[1:07:30] and then God puts his hand on your hand
[1:07:35] Hallelujah
[1:07:36] how many ever felt the grace of God when
[1:07:38] you're feeling distraught you're feeling
[1:07:40] sad you're feeling fearful and then you
[1:07:43] can feel like God's spirit comes upon
[1:07:45] you now you uh you honestly feel better
[1:07:47] now
[1:07:48] oh yeah I love when that happens that's
[1:07:50] like when Simon came that one time and
[1:07:52] nine things nine things were discerned
[1:07:54] in my life you know just times like that
[1:07:56] you come to church you don't feel very
[1:07:58] good but by the end you feel a lot
[1:08:00] better
[1:08:01] why because God put his hand on your
[1:08:03] hand
[1:08:04] oh man I think that God put his Spirit
[1:08:07] on your human Spirit praise God
[1:08:09] and it changes everything
[1:08:12] and now a backsitting king gets to use a
[1:08:16] weapon of offense
[1:08:18] he's cornered the walls are closing in
[1:08:21] but the holy spirit says pick up the bow
[1:08:25] because I'm going to put my strength in
[1:08:27] your hand for it oh Hallelujah church
[1:08:29] when we have trials and we have
[1:08:31] difficult times God will sometimes say
[1:08:33] pick up the word of God
[1:08:36] pick up your phone and play that sermon
[1:08:40] pick up that phone and play that Bible
[1:08:42] app come on somebody like Haven the
[1:08:45] other night right Heyman look uh picks
[1:08:47] up that phone and opens a Bible app and
[1:08:49] the verse of the day is exactly what she
[1:08:51] needed to hear then she shared it with
[1:08:53] our friends amen I love that praise God
[1:08:56] when you go to God God has exactly what
[1:08:59] we need praise God
[1:09:01] amen
[1:09:03] in other words God put your strength in
[1:09:06] my hand praise God put your word in my
[1:09:08] mouth as I'm preaching tonight God speak
[1:09:10] through me praise God I can't help
[1:09:12] anybody I don't want people to leave her
[1:09:13] discouraged and have all these mind
[1:09:15] battles I want everyone to be victorious
[1:09:17] so God put your word in my mouth praise
[1:09:19] God
[1:09:20] Hallelujah don't let me be a failure
[1:09:23] don't let me be uh
[1:09:25] let me don't let me Miss Don't Let Me Be
[1:09:26] In the Flesh don't let me be carnal let
[1:09:28] me be led by the Holy Spirit praise God
[1:09:31] hallelujah praise God where people say
[1:09:33] it was good to be in the house of the
[1:09:35] Lord
[1:09:36] I did have some battles and brother
[1:09:38] Jesse saying about the battles amen
[1:09:40] I did need Victory and we sang about
[1:09:42] having Victory praise God
[1:09:45] amen
[1:09:48] now I closed my Bible so I lost my spot
[1:09:50] there so
[1:09:52] all right yeah I had to bookmark praise
[1:09:54] God
[1:09:55] now we see that verse 16.
[1:09:58] so now the prophet puts his hands on the
[1:10:02] king's hands and now it's different
[1:10:06] now he remember the prophet represented
[1:10:07] the power of God that's why I said oh
[1:10:09] the Chariots of Israel The Horseman
[1:10:11] thereof
[1:10:13] that's our church what's the most
[1:10:15] important thing a nation has is real
[1:10:16] Holy Ghost Field believers
[1:10:19] now we're not going to brag and get into
[1:10:21] the bride Pride debate but it is there
[1:10:23] is some truth to the fact that this
[1:10:25] nation is protected because there's holy
[1:10:26] ghost-filled Saints in this nation
[1:10:29] right
[1:10:30] but don't forget Holy Ghost Field Saints
[1:10:32] still are Martyrs sometimes
[1:10:34] they still got to suffer
[1:10:36] but Jesus said whatever you do to the
[1:10:38] leaves of these my brethren you've done
[1:10:39] it unto me
[1:10:41] the least now church let me be the least
[1:10:43] okay can I be the least Hallelujah I
[1:10:46] mean somebody's the least at least I
[1:10:48] want to be in the the kingdom of God
[1:10:49] praise God
[1:10:51] whatever we do for one another it's as
[1:10:53] if we're doing it for Jesus
[1:10:56] let's be good to each other let's be
[1:10:58] kind to each other let's say nice things
[1:11:00] praise God let's do all we can do
[1:11:02] because when we've done it unto one
[1:11:03] another it's like doing it to Jesus and
[1:11:06] then He blesses us and a great reward
[1:11:08] awaits us hallelujah like we're just
[1:11:10] saying about
[1:11:11] greatly be rewarded for your service
[1:11:13] here
[1:11:14] because the Bible said do it especially
[1:11:16] to the household of faith
[1:11:19] especially
[1:11:21] oh I love that praise God
[1:11:23] now here's where I want to get to this
[1:11:27] verse 17 is kind of where we're getting
[1:11:28] to the the main part of the story right
[1:11:30] because now we know he's back we know
[1:11:32] his situation he's backslidden the walls
[1:11:34] are closing he's under pressure and he
[1:11:36] finally shows some respect to God
[1:11:40] Hallelujah
[1:11:42] think about that
[1:11:44] what would it look like for you and I to
[1:11:46] Humble ourselves and show great respect
[1:11:48] for God
[1:11:50] hallelujah what does that look like
[1:11:52] for him it was crying
[1:11:54] for him it was recognizing wow the
[1:11:56] spirit of God is more powerful than guns
[1:11:59] swords tanks unit chariots
[1:12:03] let's do the equivalent to today
[1:12:06] he's crying because wow this is our most
[1:12:08] important servant of the Lord
[1:12:11] this is this is uh the king being humble
[1:12:15] verse 17.
[1:12:17] now here we get the directions here
[1:12:22] and he said open the window Eastward and
[1:12:24] he opened it
[1:12:27] then Elisha said shoot and he shot
[1:12:30] now brother random uses a few types in
[1:12:32] here the open window
[1:12:34] is opening he says to the Eastward
[1:12:37] and we know Jesus comes from the East
[1:12:39] brother Ram says also the Bible says
[1:12:42] that I have to look up that scripture
[1:12:43] but the Bible says comes out of the East
[1:12:46] so this represents opening your sight
[1:12:49] right opening your vision to the coming
[1:12:51] of the Lord
[1:12:53] right it's like opening yourself to
[1:12:55] receive the Lord to the coming of the
[1:12:57] Lord
[1:12:58] in other words it's like looking to
[1:13:00] Jesus praise God
[1:13:02] so the prophet says look to Jesus
[1:13:05] look to Jesus and let the word of God go
[1:13:10] Hallelujah speak the word of God Moses
[1:13:12] Hallelujah
[1:13:15] speak the word of God and go forward
[1:13:16] praise God
[1:13:18] if you know the word of God you can
[1:13:19] speak the word of God hallelujah if you
[1:13:21] don't know you got to wait till you have
[1:13:23] the word of God
[1:13:25] so he says shoot and he shoots and he
[1:13:28] said the arrow of the Lord's Deliverance
[1:13:30] so this was going to be a symbolic thing
[1:13:32] he shoots one arrow and this represents
[1:13:34] God's Deliverance
[1:13:36] it's just like that stone that went out
[1:13:39] of David's sling that we sing about
[1:13:45] all those motions it's just like the
[1:13:47] Slate the stone the stone represents the
[1:13:50] power of God going out to meet the enemy
[1:13:52] praise God ah
[1:13:54] represents the power of God in other
[1:13:57] words faith in God's word
[1:14:00] is going forth and God's word is going
[1:14:02] to accomplish amen this Arrow will not
[1:14:04] return void amen
[1:14:06] this Stone from David will not return
[1:14:08] void it's going to accomplish what God
[1:14:11] has determined for it oh Hallelujah the
[1:14:14] stone this Arrow it's the Lord's
[1:14:17] deliverance and what word do we get from
[1:14:18] Deliverance salvation
[1:14:21] Arrow salvation the walls are closing in
[1:14:24] the enemy's coming in like a flood but I
[1:14:26] go to the prophet I honor God's word I
[1:14:29] show respect to God's word and God gives
[1:14:31] me a word and God is going to bring
[1:14:33] Salvation to me praise God
[1:14:36] oh it's a beautiful story
[1:14:39] teaches us how to Humble ourselves
[1:14:42] and show respect to God and ask God for
[1:14:45] victory
[1:14:49] now we're going to get into the Freemore
[1:14:50] agency part here pretty soon so
[1:14:52] everybody get ready now
[1:14:54] get ready
[1:14:56] Hallelujah
[1:14:59] because Church in these moments it's
[1:15:01] very difficult sometimes to know you're
[1:15:03] in that moment
[1:15:05] and you'll see what I'm saying here in a
[1:15:07] moment
[1:15:08] you'll see
[1:15:09] because if you remember the story
[1:15:12] the king does good but he doesn't do
[1:15:14] good enough
[1:15:16] I don't want to start any mind battles
[1:15:18] with anybody I never want to do
[1:15:20] but how many want to go all the way with
[1:15:22] the Lord
[1:15:24] I think some of the biggest fears is for
[1:15:27] Christians is that we were not doing
[1:15:28] enough right we talked about that before
[1:15:30] I don't want anyone to feel that way
[1:15:34] but this is a lesson where we can see
[1:15:38] some plain truths here if we need
[1:15:39] Deliverance we've got a call on God
[1:15:42] we've got to show respect to God
[1:15:46] okay but then we get some great insights
[1:15:50] here from the word of God
[1:15:52] and church that's the that's the the
[1:15:54] thing we got to look for uh well the man
[1:15:56] calls it the spur of the moment in that
[1:15:58] moment when you're in the trial in that
[1:16:00] moment when it's difficult you got to
[1:16:02] recognize when God's presence comes and
[1:16:04] you've got to believe for every promise
[1:16:06] of God for your situation
[1:16:09] you'll see what I'm saying here in just
[1:16:10] a moment oh I hope I'm not speaking in
[1:16:12] dark sayings and Mysteries or something
[1:16:13] like that I'm just trying not to get to
[1:16:15] it before I get to it you know I'm sure
[1:16:17] trying to
[1:16:19] slow down a little bit here the heir of
[1:16:22] the Lord's Deliverance he says this is
[1:16:23] the arrow this represents God's
[1:16:25] salvation what a blessing amen
[1:16:27] what a blessing he humbles himself he
[1:16:30] goes to the prophet and the prophet said
[1:16:31] I'm going to give you a sign that God's
[1:16:33] going to deliver you shoot this arrow
[1:16:36] and this is going to be the sign God is
[1:16:38] going to deliver you oh praise God Amen
[1:16:41] Hallelujah God's going to give you an
[1:16:43] arrow of Deliverance
[1:16:45] a sign that you're guaranteed to get the
[1:16:48] victory oh I'm gonna watch on Sunday
[1:16:51] when brother Dixon is here praise God
[1:16:52] I'll be looking for some arrows
[1:16:53] Hallelujah
[1:16:56] some promises of God Amen that was
[1:16:58] striking you can look for him tonight
[1:17:00] too praise God Amen some promises of God
[1:17:03] that speak to your heart and you receive
[1:17:05] them and then you speak God's word and
[1:17:07] you believe it praise God
[1:17:09] in other words what are you talking
[1:17:10] about revelation
[1:17:12] the Simplicity of God I need a
[1:17:14] revelation I'm in a difficult trial I'm
[1:17:17] I'm cornered I need a way of Escape I
[1:17:19] need salvation God give me a revelation
[1:17:22] God give me the word Lord Give Me A Sign
[1:17:24] that you're going to save me praise God
[1:17:27] oh amen
[1:17:30] thank God
[1:17:32] I remember last time brother Dukes came
[1:17:34] it's like he preached the next uh sermon
[1:17:37] on the Joshua series
[1:17:39] I've never had that before
[1:17:41] it's like you just picked up where I
[1:17:42] left off
[1:17:44] how'd you know that oh you're our dad
[1:17:46] our dad told you to preach that that's
[1:17:47] right dad told you to preach out
[1:17:50] Hallelujah that's a real encouragement
[1:17:52] he says the air Lord delivers at verse
[1:17:54] 17 and the Arab deliverance from Syria
[1:17:58] for Thou shalt Smite the syrians in afec
[1:18:01] till thou have consumed them
[1:18:05] so the arrow going out and Landing it
[1:18:07] was smiting the ground right and that
[1:18:09] represents God's word is going to God is
[1:18:11] going to go fight for you it's going to
[1:18:13] Smite the enemy
[1:18:15] it's gonna hit the target amen don't you
[1:18:17] love him God hits the target praise God
[1:18:19] you need God to bring the healing you
[1:18:21] need this amount of money or you need
[1:18:22] that person saved or whatever and God
[1:18:25] hits the target praise God hallelujah
[1:18:28] thank God that's a blessing
[1:18:31] we run to God in our in our human
[1:18:34] Frailty we run to God like oh God I need
[1:18:36] you you know finally
[1:18:38] it's about time
[1:18:41] we run to God in our humility we show
[1:18:43] respect to God we get sincere and God
[1:18:45] gives us a blessing amen I'll say like
[1:18:47] this it's undeserved right but he still
[1:18:49] blesses us because he loves us praise
[1:18:51] God
[1:18:52] amen hallelujah
[1:18:57] says this represents that you're going
[1:18:59] to Smite the enemy what a blessing
[1:19:02] because the enemy was surrounding him
[1:19:04] and he was hearing rumors you're going
[1:19:06] to die by the syrians the syrian's going
[1:19:08] to destroy you they're way too they're
[1:19:09] way too powerful but now this prophet of
[1:19:11] God gave me a word from the Lord
[1:19:14] the church that's what we need we need a
[1:19:16] word from the Bible praise God we need a
[1:19:18] word from the Holy Spirit there's about
[1:19:19] 30 minutes Hallelujah I'm almost done
[1:19:22] we'll see
[1:19:25] look at this he says now the the special
[1:19:28] last line look till thou have consumed
[1:19:31] them now God says through the prophet
[1:19:33] you will consume them Oh Glory they will
[1:19:36] not consume you they won't take your
[1:19:38] life
[1:19:39] you're going to defeat the enemy praise
[1:19:41] God
[1:19:41] you have to worry about wasting away you
[1:19:43] don't have to worry about losing oh I
[1:19:46] like a god who helps me to win praise
[1:19:47] God I hate to lose I would cry if I lost
[1:19:49] a baseball game when I was little I cry
[1:19:51] if I lost a football game when I got
[1:19:52] older but with God we're not losers
[1:19:55] we're winners praise God I'm glad I'm on
[1:19:57] The Winning Side amen thank God
[1:19:59] Hallelujah
[1:20:02] but notice until so the word of God says
[1:20:05] this represents you're saved till you
[1:20:07] consume them praise God
[1:20:10] think about that just like the Red Sea
[1:20:11] no more slaves
[1:20:14] no more slave masters
[1:20:17] no more drugs no more alcohol no more
[1:20:21] cussing no more depression
[1:20:24] no more lesson
[1:20:26] no more fear
[1:20:28] no more pride and the church said no
[1:20:31] more it's all going to be consumed God
[1:20:34] is bringing me the victory why because I
[1:20:36] show respect to his word because he
[1:20:38] loves me I'm actually a part of God's
[1:20:40] family praise God I am Israel and we're
[1:20:43] spiritual Israel Hallelujah
[1:20:46] in one way don't take that too far
[1:20:49] got a lot of people saying they're
[1:20:50] they're actually Israel like they're the
[1:20:52] 144 000 that's what the Jehovah's
[1:20:54] Witnesses
[1:20:55] dude so let's we're not going that far
[1:20:58] we're going the we're the we're the ones
[1:21:00] the Bible said that we serve god with
[1:21:01] the spirit
[1:21:03] with a sincere heart our hearts are
[1:21:05] circumcised
[1:21:07] right that's that's the real script the
[1:21:09] real Jew
[1:21:10] but we're not 144 000.
[1:21:12] now verse 18. and he said take the
[1:21:15] arrows and he took them now here's where
[1:21:17] we're getting real to the important part
[1:21:18] here
[1:21:20] under the king of Israel Smite upon the
[1:21:22] ground now I'm not sure how this
[1:21:23] happened here
[1:21:24] I can't really explain this I looked up
[1:21:26] in the concordance but I couldn't quite
[1:21:28] explain it
[1:21:30] but notice he says so he shot one Arrow
[1:21:32] it's smote the ground and he said take
[1:21:35] the arrows
[1:21:37] and smite them on the ground he smote
[1:21:40] them Thrice and say now one one writer
[1:21:42] said he he went out and got the other
[1:21:44] arrow that he shot and then he come back
[1:21:46] and smited him into the ground
[1:21:49] another one didn't mention it either way
[1:21:50] so I'm not sure how this looked out but
[1:21:53] the point is church this boy the point
[1:21:55] isn't that's not the point
[1:21:57] the point is
[1:21:59] that he took the arrows and he smote the
[1:22:01] ground three times now some people say
[1:22:04] he might have shot three arrows other
[1:22:05] people said he might have shot one arrow
[1:22:07] and then took two arrows and just smote
[1:22:08] him in the ground I'm not sure how it
[1:22:10] worked out
[1:22:12] but the prophet said Smite him upon the
[1:22:15] ground now the prophet just showed him
[1:22:17] this Arrow represents smiting the enemy
[1:22:20] and then he says now you're going to
[1:22:21] totally consume them he says you smite
[1:22:24] him now Smite these on the ground
[1:22:26] and the King got all anointed by the
[1:22:28] Holy Spirit and maybe he threw it down
[1:22:31] like that or maybe he shot number two
[1:22:33] and he shot number three
[1:22:35] he thought praise God I've got
[1:22:37] Deliverance
[1:22:39] hallelujah praise God the prophet told
[1:22:41] me to do this I'm doing this in the name
[1:22:43] of the Lord I'm trusting by faith I'm
[1:22:46] sending my faith out there praise God
[1:22:47] I'm asking the Holy Spirit deliver me
[1:22:49] save me in other words God said this
[1:22:51] three prayers in a row can I say like
[1:22:53] that
[1:22:55] three scriptures spoken three uh three
[1:22:58] prayers spoken
[1:22:59] I'm trusting to God we'll hear these
[1:23:01] prayers and he said praise God
[1:23:04] 's going to deliver me
[1:23:06] that's a pretty good testimony
[1:23:09] pretty good testimony
[1:23:11] verse 19.
[1:23:13] and the man of God was blessed
[1:23:16] no but now we're getting into this free
[1:23:18] more agency thing here
[1:23:21] and the man of God was Wrath with him
[1:23:23] and said thou shouldest have smitten
[1:23:25] five or six times
[1:23:29] then hast thou Smit in Syria
[1:23:32] till thou Hast consumed it whereas now
[1:23:36] Thou shalt Smite Syria but Thrice
[1:23:41] so here we have to read between the
[1:23:43] lines
[1:23:45] what God wanted was for King
[1:23:48] joash
[1:23:50] to take a number of arrows and just keep
[1:23:52] shooting till all the arrows he had just
[1:23:55] keep going you're under that anointing
[1:23:56] just keep speaking the word of God
[1:23:59] right just keep speaking the word of God
[1:24:01] just keep speaking it
[1:24:04] right in other words God wanted to see
[1:24:06] more faith on his part
[1:24:10] God wanted to see him take more arrows
[1:24:12] and shoot him out and Trust for more
[1:24:15] deliverances he only did three though
[1:24:18] right and the prophet said you sit in
[1:24:20] five or six
[1:24:21] now the prophet never told him how many
[1:24:23] to shoot
[1:24:25] but the prophet gets mad because he only
[1:24:27] did three
[1:24:29] isn't that something three is a pretty
[1:24:31] good number in the Bible how many number
[1:24:32] three is a pretty good number father son
[1:24:33] Holy Ghost faith hope charity right
[1:24:36] Peter James John you got a lot of good
[1:24:37] threes in the Bible
[1:24:39] but in this case three wouldn't uh he
[1:24:42] could have done more
[1:24:44] right what is what a striking thing
[1:24:47] he said there's only three
[1:24:49] he said you should have done five or six
[1:24:51] why not four four is the number of
[1:24:52] Deliverance why not four
[1:24:56] but he says you should have did five or
[1:24:58] six
[1:25:01] and the prophet's mad you should have
[1:25:03] had more faith in God
[1:25:07] all right now don't be discouraged now
[1:25:10] go down to verse 25. look at verse 25.
[1:25:16] and joash the son of Joe has took again
[1:25:19] out of the hand of Ben Hader the son of
[1:25:20] hazyah of the Cities which he had taken
[1:25:23] out of the hand of Joe has his father by
[1:25:26] war three times the Jewish beat him and
[1:25:28] recovered the cities of Israel
[1:25:31] now this ought to be encouraging
[1:25:35] right in other words however much Faith
[1:25:38] you have in God that's how much God will
[1:25:40] do for you
[1:25:43] right
[1:25:47] can I say like this the more you draw an
[1:25:49] eye to God the more God will draw an eye
[1:25:52] to you oh Hallelujah
[1:25:54] and the church said
[1:25:56] right because God said you could have
[1:25:58] came five or you could have did five or
[1:26:00] six times smiting
[1:26:02] these arrows represent deliverance and
[1:26:06] so the king said I can believe for three
[1:26:07] deliverances
[1:26:09] now brother man dramatizes it because
[1:26:11] he's a make-believer and brother Adam
[1:26:13] says see I can go to church I can join
[1:26:15] denomination and I can pay tithes and
[1:26:17] offerings that's a brother answer those
[1:26:18] are the three arrows
[1:26:21] in other words they will only only go so
[1:26:23] far with their religion but Brothers
[1:26:25] says believe for more than that brother
[1:26:26] sister believe for Divine Healing amen
[1:26:29] believe for the arrow of the baptism of
[1:26:31] the Holy Ghost believe for the arrow
[1:26:33] that all things are possible to them
[1:26:35] that believe praise God
[1:26:37] oh Hallelujah now what did he move what
[1:26:40] did he lose out on
[1:26:42] total victory
[1:26:45] he got three victories but he missed out
[1:26:48] on total victory
[1:26:51] because a lack of faith a lack of really
[1:26:55] getting into it now think about this
[1:26:56] church let's say he struck it like this
[1:26:58] he did he shot at one and then he did
[1:27:00] two three
[1:27:02] okay let's say like that or maybe it was
[1:27:04] one Smite two Smite three Smite Smite
[1:27:07] Smite smite
[1:27:09] God wanted to do some more instead of
[1:27:13] God wanted him to do
[1:27:19] Church said
[1:27:20] Hallelujah God wanted to do let it go
[1:27:23] let it go let it go let it go God want
[1:27:25] him to keep going
[1:27:27] Hallelujah
[1:27:29] there's sometimes church when the Holy
[1:27:31] Ghost is moving you by your brother just
[1:27:33] clap a few times then other times you
[1:27:35] remember this when the Holy Ghost starts
[1:27:36] moving brother Jasper's not like oh
[1:27:38] hallelujah praise God
[1:27:40] and the church said
[1:27:42] and God starts moving right
[1:27:46] one little clap
[1:27:48] thank you Lord for that sermon
[1:27:50] we're so self-styled and uh starchy
[1:27:53] thank you Lord
[1:27:56] I'll give you three three smites
[1:28:00] it's a great sermon Lord
[1:28:03] and God's like no praise me
[1:28:06] give me more praise God Amen how much
[1:28:09] you want from God Amen
[1:28:11] how much you need
[1:28:13] you're in trouble
[1:28:15] quiet to God don't just do three prayers
[1:28:17] Don't Say the Name of Jesus three times
[1:28:19] say it five times amen
[1:28:22] Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus come
[1:28:26] over sing Jesus amen
[1:28:28] that's what it's saying he's saying cry
[1:28:31] to God more put more into it praise God
[1:28:34] be more desperate however much you pour
[1:28:36] into it that's how much you'll get out
[1:28:38] Hallelujah
[1:28:40] Hallelujah in the moment of trial in the
[1:28:42] moment of tests you got to trust God
[1:28:44] trust his word speak his word praise God
[1:28:49] and you'll get back whatever you put in
[1:28:52] and it's a free moral agency thing he
[1:28:55] didn't say
[1:28:56] how many times to do it he just said you
[1:28:59] you smite it
[1:29:01] in other words now we can go back to the
[1:29:03] sermon from a few weeks ago when the
[1:29:04] Amish were here you speak to the Rock
[1:29:08] what are you going to say The Rock
[1:29:11] you can get mad at the Rock
[1:29:13] right I'm gonna ignore the rock you're
[1:29:15] gonna try to uh
[1:29:17] try to barter with The Rock
[1:29:20] try to make it's okay to make a vow with
[1:29:21] God it's okay
[1:29:23] but we got to speak to him in love we
[1:29:25] got to praise him
[1:29:26] we gotta so thank we gotta thank him for
[1:29:29] all he's done
[1:29:30] we got to Magnify Him we got when every
[1:29:33] time the Holy Ghost well the Bible said
[1:29:34] they either magnified God or they praise
[1:29:37] God or some type of worship when we when
[1:29:39] we want something from God we gotta
[1:29:41] Praise Him First Hallelujah
[1:29:43] back to this Pro that's what this King
[1:29:45] did he come and showed respect he cried
[1:29:47] he said you're so valuable you're such a
[1:29:49] wonderful man of God you're more
[1:29:51] important than all of our natural uh
[1:29:53] blessings your spiritual connection to
[1:29:55] God is the most important thing we have
[1:29:57] and so God said Smite as much as you
[1:29:59] want praise God
[1:30:01] oh my God praise God
[1:30:04] it's just like brothers Hattie right ask
[1:30:06] whatever you want
[1:30:09] Hallelujah
[1:30:11] in other words Smite it not just once
[1:30:14] not just twice but dude despite as much
[1:30:17] as you want in other words give God your
[1:30:19] greatest desire ask God for desire your
[1:30:21] heart and he'll Grant your desire of
[1:30:23] your heart praise God
[1:30:26] the king could only believe in getting
[1:30:27] three cities back well guess what church
[1:30:29] he got him back
[1:30:31] but he could have got more
[1:30:37] oh it's a beautiful story in the
[1:30:38] Beautiful
[1:30:40] Hallelujah
[1:30:44] so the the prophets upset
[1:30:47] because they could have got more Victory
[1:30:49] if the king would have had more faith in
[1:30:52] God
[1:30:54] everybody see that by God's grace
[1:30:57] Hallelujah let me read this quote from
[1:30:59] mother Brown
[1:31:06] brother Brown says
[1:31:08] now
[1:31:09] no matter how mysterious it seems God
[1:31:12] always keeps his word
[1:31:13] no matter how unreasonable it may seem
[1:31:16] to people God keeps his word brother I
[1:31:19] said sometimes it seems like it's
[1:31:21] ridiculous the way that God would go
[1:31:23] around to keep his promise but God
[1:31:25] always keeps his promise
[1:31:30] Church alls he did
[1:31:32] all he did was either Smite he shoot it
[1:31:35] and smite in the ground all he did was
[1:31:36] shoot three arrows
[1:31:38] all he did was just maybe Smite two
[1:31:41] arrows in the ground with his hand and
[1:31:43] that led to three cities three entire
[1:31:46] cities being gained back
[1:31:49] to the people of God everyone said I
[1:31:51] don't care how ridiculous it looks like
[1:31:53] God's Gonna back up his promise
[1:31:56] if God ever promised you something he's
[1:31:58] going to give it to you
[1:32:00] I don't care how ridiculous I don't care
[1:32:02] how long you got to wait if God gives a
[1:32:05] word it's going to come to pass praise
[1:32:07] God
[1:32:08] is that right
[1:32:11] don't don't care how ridiculous it seems
[1:32:14] trust God trust God's word hallelujah
[1:32:17] and I'm not talking I mean yeah I'm
[1:32:19] talking about something you can read in
[1:32:20] the Bible yes but I'm talking about even
[1:32:21] personal Revelations that maybe not are
[1:32:24] found in the Bible but if God gives you
[1:32:26] revelation God is going to keep that
[1:32:28] word praise God
[1:32:30] it might look ridiculous how it happened
[1:32:32] but God's going to keep his word
[1:32:35] that's what brother Adam says that's
[1:32:36] what we can learn from this story how
[1:32:37] many learning tonight
[1:32:39] hopefully a little bit by God's grace I
[1:32:41] know it's not all brand new
[1:32:43] brother random says this the same
[1:32:46] tonight is happening for the Christian
[1:32:48] church so this story the same things
[1:32:50] happened for the church tonight did you
[1:32:51] know that
[1:32:53] good reminder huh
[1:32:56] we have struck the arrow of God's
[1:32:58] Deliverance
[1:32:59] he said it was God sent the arrow
[1:33:02] Deliverance to us the air of Deliverance
[1:33:04] is the holy spirit that's been sent shot
[1:33:06] from the bow of God's love
[1:33:11] Hallelujah when the eternity to Eternity
[1:33:14] was pulled together by the court of love
[1:33:16] God shot the era of Deliverance into the
[1:33:19] church on the day of Pentecost
[1:33:21] Christ was given into her hand the arrow
[1:33:25] of God Deliverance the holy spirit will
[1:33:27] deliver the church out of any kind of
[1:33:29] chaos it could get into
[1:33:31] it
[1:33:32] see the King was in chaos God delivered
[1:33:35] the king if the church gets in chaos God
[1:33:38] will deliver the church praise God
[1:33:40] through the arrow of God's Deliverance
[1:33:45] oh don't you love that
[1:33:51] Hallelujah
[1:33:53] he said that's a backsitting king they
[1:33:56] struck the arrow once and said well
[1:33:57] we'll build a church now look at that he
[1:33:59] says here's the three arrows we'll build
[1:34:01] a church as one Arrow of the king
[1:34:04] he says second we'll teach theology
[1:34:10] well third will teach psychology and
[1:34:13] have an organization
[1:34:15] he's that's about as far as the
[1:34:16] denomination can strike he says
[1:34:19] he said they struck sure on so many
[1:34:22] blessings
[1:34:23] he said but see the church like the king
[1:34:25] had struck short on the baptism of the
[1:34:28] Holy Ghost
[1:34:29] struck short on deliverance from sin
[1:34:32] he said brother when you get that
[1:34:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost it takes that
[1:34:35] old temper out of you it puts you on a
[1:34:37] dress it makes you act like a lady it'll
[1:34:39] make you quit your smoking lying
[1:34:41] stealing everything brother when you got
[1:34:43] the baptism the holy ghost that
[1:34:44] separates you and delivers you from the
[1:34:45] things of the world it makes you love
[1:34:47] God
[1:34:49] it makes you go to church it makes you
[1:34:51] worship Him it makes you tell your
[1:34:53] neighbor about it it makes you live
[1:34:55] above sin
[1:34:57] Hallelujah
[1:35:03] brother man said Jesus Christ is the
[1:35:05] same yesterday today and forever he said
[1:35:07] Strike It Don't Be Afraid God said so
[1:35:09] I'm the Lord thy God that heal thee
[1:35:11] strike it God said so it's the era of
[1:35:14] Deliverance
[1:35:15] oh Hallelujah let's stand to our feet
[1:35:18] musicians can come here
[1:35:20] I didn't preach much over half an hour
[1:35:21] there 45 minutes
[1:35:25] brother Ram says the arrow was given to
[1:35:27] the church but sometimes worldliness
[1:35:29] creeps into our lives
[1:35:32] just acting like the world looking at
[1:35:35] situations and problems like the world
[1:35:36] will look at them rather than look at
[1:35:37] him through God's word
[1:35:41] so in other words every promise of God
[1:35:43] in here is an arrow
[1:35:45] that God wants to use in our lives
[1:35:47] it's an arrow of God's salvation
[1:35:52] Hallelujah
[1:35:58] I feel like there's one more one to read
[1:36:00] or maybe not
[1:36:02] so I want to bring it down to this
[1:36:04] church I want to bring it down to
[1:36:07] the personal life when I preach this I
[1:36:09] remember very distinctly I remember
[1:36:10] preaching this in that Waterloo hole in
[1:36:12] the wall over there
[1:36:14] remember there's a couple of us that
[1:36:15] were there that night
[1:36:16] and I remember
[1:36:18] each of us I know at least me and one
[1:36:21] other person were just shouting out
[1:36:23] arrows unto God it was on a Wednesday
[1:36:25] night just like this it was on the
[1:36:26] Wednesday night
[1:36:30] and I was just preaching saying whatever
[1:36:32] promise is in there strike the promise
[1:36:35] but Ram says strike it
[1:36:37] I'm the Lord thy God the heal thee
[1:36:39] strike it if you believe it
[1:36:41] shoot it out
[1:36:43] now
[1:36:45] let me say this you got to balance that
[1:36:46] and you got to ask what you have need of
[1:36:49] in that hour
[1:36:50] that King wasn't asking for a luxurious
[1:36:52] life he was asking for life itself to be
[1:36:55] delivered from the syrians
[1:36:58] right
[1:36:59] he wasn't asking for selfish things he
[1:37:02] was just asking to be delivered from the
[1:37:04] enemy
[1:37:05] so church we got to recognize what's the
[1:37:07] enemy doing in our lives
[1:37:09] and that's what we need victory over now
[1:37:11] when you recognize the enemy and when
[1:37:13] he's doing that's the area where God can
[1:37:15] give you an arrow to Smite that enemy
[1:37:18] but it's not just every desire of our
[1:37:20] heart
[1:37:21] right because some of those desires may
[1:37:23] change over the years
[1:37:25] the church said
[1:37:31] but it's clear in this in this in this
[1:37:33] text
[1:37:34] he had to ask for what was currently
[1:37:37] bothering him what drove him into the
[1:37:39] prince of the Lord
[1:37:41] so Church we've got to ask ourselves
[1:37:42] that what drives Us in the prince of the
[1:37:44] Lord tonight
[1:37:46] and then in your heart listen and see if
[1:37:49] the holy spirit is telling you to Smite
[1:37:52] something
[1:37:53] to shoot a promise of God into your
[1:37:56] lives
[1:37:58] into the atmosphere of Faith believe the
[1:38:01] promise of God let this let this
[1:38:03] scripture that I speak from my mouth let
[1:38:05] it be a symbol that God's given me
[1:38:07] salvation
[1:38:08] God's going to hear this request
[1:38:12] God's God's arrow is going to hit his
[1:38:14] Target amen ah praise God does God ever
[1:38:17] miss his Target of course not is God
[1:38:20] ever a failure of course not can God's
[1:38:22] word ever fail no Hallelujah
[1:38:25] can God's word return void of course not
[1:38:28] God's word will accomplish all that has
[1:38:30] been accomplished to do praise God Osman
[1:38:32] sent to do
[1:38:33] God's word will accomplish it let's play
[1:38:35] here let's bow our heads here for a word
[1:38:37] of Prayer
[1:38:42] Hallelujah
[1:38:49] church I remember on that night
[1:38:52] one other brother was asking certain
[1:38:54] requests
[1:38:56] for his children to be saved
[1:38:59] you know that night too I remember I was
[1:39:00] asking for my children to be saved

[1:39:31] really zealous I was really jealous if
[1:39:33] you might have been crying

[1:39:42] maybe you don't feel like the walls are
[1:39:43] closing on you but then let's have an
[1:39:45] arrow for somebody else who needs
[1:39:46] prayers

[1:40:01] it's been a struggle and you want Total
