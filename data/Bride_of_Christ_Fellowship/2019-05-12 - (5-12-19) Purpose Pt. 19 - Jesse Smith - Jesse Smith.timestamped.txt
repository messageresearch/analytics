[37:35] like to look at the purpose series this
[37:37] morning I will just have one service
[37:40] today as I was announcing this week Luke
[37:43] chapter 2 hopefully got a chance to talk
[37:48] to your mother if not take this
[37:50] afternoon and make sure you get a chance
[37:52] to speak with your mom there I got to
[37:57] talk to my mom and just had a nice
[37:59] little conversation she said well
[38:01] nobody's invited me to anything this
[38:02] morning you know I said well mom I said
[38:05] I wish I could be there I really wish I
[38:09] could be there but I do a good thank her
[38:11] for all that she's done for me and she's
[38:13] just a tremendous mother and all that
[38:16] she seemed to know so I thank the Lord
[38:18] for that
[38:19] praise God thank God for His mercy and
[38:21] his love I'd like to look at a few
[38:25] scriptures here Luke chapter 2 let's go
[38:33] to verse 17 when they had seen it they
[38:40] made known abroad the saying that was
[38:42] told them concerning this child and all
[38:44] they that heard it wondered at those
[38:46] things which were told them by the
[38:49] shepherds but Mary kept all these things
[38:52] and pondered them in her heart I noticed
[38:58] that this
[38:59] sure says here look at Mary pondering
[39:01] the Word of God in her heart praise God
[39:08] I'd like to also look at a later on in
[39:12] the scripture when Simeon prophesized
[39:17] look what the Bible says here let's go
[39:19] to verse 32 this is what he calls Jesus
[39:22] a light to lighten the Gentiles and the
[39:25] glory of thy people Israel as God's
[39:29] light shine on your heart this morning
[39:31] well then you know this scripture is
[39:33] fulfilled in our lives
[39:34] amen he's shining on the Gentiles today
[39:36] and Joseph and his mother marveled of
[39:39] those things which were spoken to him
[39:40] see she always kept these things in her
[39:42] heart we want to look at Mary a little
[39:43] bit this morning Mary's belief and
[39:45] Simeon blessed them and said unto mary's
[39:47] mother behold this child is set for the
[39:49] fall and rising again of many in Israel
[39:52] and for a sign which shall be spoken
[39:54] against ya a sword shall pierce through
[39:57] the ione so also that the thoughts of
[39:59] many hearts may be revealed amen may God
[40:04] as blessing the rivas word you may be
[40:05] seated there praise the Lord now we're
[40:11] really familiar of course with Mary and
[40:14] a lot of the scriptures here about how
[40:16] they pon actually pondered the Word of
[40:18] God in our heart and I want to look at a
[40:20] lot of those thoughts this morning I
[40:22] want to kind of rehearse the the story
[40:24] of Mary as I listening to
[40:27] Mary's belief yesterday I probably got
[40:28] through it about three times and enjoyed
[40:31] it by the grace of the Lord but before
[40:33] that one I wish all the mothers a
[40:35] happiest mother today let's give them
[40:36] around pause again by God's grace I'll
[40:40] try to catch your mothers with the Rose
[40:42] at the end if I don't I'll send my
[40:44] children after you try to catch it so
[40:47] thank the Lord for His grace and where
[40:50] would we be without mom amen my mom is
[40:53] so special praise God that female
[40:57] attribute of God right God's our Father
[40:59] and our mother
[41:00] we're birthed out of God so it's just
[41:03] amazing that God takes both attributes
[41:05] there so thank the Lord for His mercy so
[41:09] I want to look here to the scripture
[41:12] and I'll just be honest I'm probably
[41:14] gonna I'm always honest but I'm gonna
[41:18] start preaching some of the thoughts I'm
[41:21] gonna preach next Sunday at Toledo so or
[41:23] honestly don't Michigan but Paula
[41:25] Fontaine so I've just been it's kind of
[41:27] overlapping in fact I couldn't sleep
[41:29] last night and I got about 10 or 12
[41:31] thoughts that kind of drop down while I
[41:34] was up till passed I'm trying to go to
[41:36] bed at 10:30 and it's up past midnight
[41:38] thinking on the things of God so I'm
[41:40] starting to see that the direction maybe
[41:44] for next weekend but you will have
[41:46] brother bender odd here so he'll be
[41:47] preaching both services for us so we're
[41:49] looking forward to having both been here
[41:51] I know he's always a blessing and so I
[41:55] just I'll probably kind of mix up some
[41:57] of these thoughts but I hope it'll be a
[41:59] blessing to you by God's grace so uh
[42:02] actually read the wrong text so let's go
[42:05] back to Luke chapter 1 I met Luke I was
[42:08] at Luke 237 like man it doesn't look
[42:10] like the scripture mercy but I didn't
[42:12] have my my notes open so let's go to
[42:14] Luke 1:37 38 now it worked out because
[42:18] it speaks of Mary pondering these things
[42:20] in her heart and that's where we're
[42:23] gonna want to get to Luke 1:37 for with
[42:30] God nothing shall be impossible and Mary
[42:35] said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be
[42:37] it unto me according to thy word and the
[42:40] angel departed from her so I want to
[42:43] just look at these thoughts here and
[42:45] we'll try to be just in the mind of the
[42:48] Lord this morning I'm gonna switch over
[42:50] Lydia so we can put the notes on here
[42:52] and just show the notes that was on our
[42:56] hearts to prepare so thank the Lord for
[43:02] His mercy and thank the Lord for His
[43:04] grace we should appreciate the Lord
[43:07] Jesus so I want to look at a few things
[43:10] here let's look at a few quotes on
[43:12] purpose because the way I kinda was led
[43:15] to this message was through studying
[43:17] yesterday and I was looking up serving
[43:19] your purpose on this earth I've been
[43:20] looking on that the purpose series I
[43:22] believe we're on part 19 that's right
[43:24] part 19
[43:26] and I found this quote about Mary's
[43:28] purpose so brother Branham says like
[43:31] Mary's womb Mary was not the seed and I
[43:34] want to just reference that to you kind
[43:38] of emphasized that today Mary was not
[43:40] this seed but she carried the seed okay
[43:45] in the representation here of the stock
[43:48] so Mary represents the stock brother
[43:50] Branham says she was only a carrier of
[43:53] it like the rest of it but being called
[43:57] and chosen first by God Himself for this
[44:00] purpose
[44:01] now the striking thing that I noticed is
[44:04] that brother Branham throughout this
[44:05] sermon here this is not the one I'll be
[44:07] laboring in but throughout this sermon
[44:09] he said at seven or eight times that
[44:11] Mary was not the word
[44:12] she was the carry of the word and huh me
[44:15] know that your body is not the word your
[44:19] mind isn't even the word the only thing
[44:22] that is the word is your soul amen
[44:26] so that's and so often we just hear your
[44:28] soul is the word yours and that's true
[44:30] and there's so much emphasis on that but
[44:32] if your soul really is the word it'll
[44:35] bring this mind and body into subjection
[44:37] to the word amen
[44:40] that's why Satan in us in us in his
[44:42] spiritual intellection he can admit the
[44:45] word he can believe in God he can
[44:46] believe God's one person not three but
[44:49] his soul you know his being will never
[44:51] be able to be the word right because
[44:54] there's no there's no we'd say
[44:57] manifestation of God in him and like
[45:01] Judas and Balaam and all these ones that
[45:03] were lost
[45:03] there was no seed inside of them and so
[45:07] but you and I believe we're the seed of
[45:09] God and if we are the seed of God then
[45:12] the seed of God will bring everything
[45:14] into subjection to the seed inside of it
[45:17] every thought every action and every
[45:21] desire it'll all be brought into
[45:24] subjection to the Word of God hallelujah
[45:27] and so Abraham says this and he says it
[45:30] over and over again so we'll try to
[45:31] close with that at the end that that
[45:33] we're carriers of the seed of God and
[45:36] you and I can't go we shouldn't go
[45:38] around saying well I'm the word I'm the
[45:40] you are not the word your a portion of
[45:43] the word you are an expression of the
[45:45] word when we Ziff you we say on the word
[45:47] on the word what Satan has tricked us to
[45:49] believe is that we are God we're not God
[45:52] but we're an offspring of God we share
[45:56] his nature but we are not all of his
[45:58] nature only Christ was all of his nature
[46:01] and see that's what Satan's doing today
[46:04] he's trying to get the bride to go one
[46:06] of two directions he knows Satan knows
[46:08] he can't get the bride to go off into
[46:11] the foolish virgin and sin but what he's
[46:13] trying to do is either exalt brother
[46:15] Branham as God or ourselves as God right
[46:19] that's what he's trying to do either one
[46:22] either will exalt brother Branham too
[46:24] high or ourselves too high but the real
[46:27] Christian stays in the
[46:29] middle-of-the-road
[46:29] they're born of the word seat of God and
[46:32] they manifest the word because they
[46:34] bring everything in obedience to the
[46:36] word but they never say I'm all the word
[46:39] or look at me or look how great I am I'm
[46:42] the word noive we look at our care this
[46:45] is just a stalk this this flesh right
[46:48] here just by this just a thin old stock
[46:50] like brother Jose said he said I keep
[46:52] getting thinner every time he hugs me
[46:54] I'm just a thin old stock right this
[46:57] body's gonna die if God Terry's you know
[46:59] I want to live to the rapture but if I
[47:01] don't there'll be a funeral service and
[47:03] the latest stock in the ground but that
[47:05] life inside of me will go back to where
[47:08] it came from
[47:09] amen it'll go back to God the word the
[47:12] full expression of the word but the only
[47:14] way you know that is if I bring this
[47:17] body in this mind and this mouth in the
[47:19] subjection to the word that's the only
[47:22] way you'll know is that I carry the word
[47:24] in my life I carry it to work sorry I
[47:28] character Church a man died I carried
[47:31] the will of God this morning to the
[47:32] house of God and I carried home with me
[47:36] and I manifest the word in my home amen
[47:39] that's the only way you are you and I
[47:41] are carriers and that's God's purpose
[47:44] for Mary
[47:44] that's God's purpose for you that's
[47:46] God's purpose for me that's all of God's
[47:49] purpose for all of us to carry the word
[47:51] there's someone that needs to hear it
[47:53] ain't
[47:54] glory that's right and so there's other
[47:57] quotes I just want to briefly go over it
[48:00] you know Jack Abed brother branham said
[48:02] though Moses was a theologian because he
[48:04] was trained the wisdom of all the
[48:06] learning of Egypt the Egyptians been
[48:09] told by his mother he was called for a
[48:11] purpose so again we see purpose mother
[48:14] connected with purpose right and you
[48:16] would not be here unless your mother
[48:19] chose to carry you full-term right right
[48:22] your mother had added of the purpose she
[48:24] had to know there's a purpose for this
[48:26] whoo this fruit in my in my body there's
[48:29] a purpose for this and I like how Jack
[48:32] Abed caught the spiritual purpose she
[48:35] just didn't catch the physical purpose
[48:36] but she caught the spiritual purpose
[48:39] you're here to bring forth your bring
[48:42] forth Moses and he's going to deliver my
[48:44] people Israel amen
[48:47] I told my mom this morning and I said I
[48:49] said mom I'm sorry I can't be there you
[48:51] know every every holiday I don't get to
[48:53] be with you and he she said something
[48:54] along these lines Jesse that's okay
[48:56] you're called to God's purpose you're
[48:58] called to minister to the people of God
[49:01] amen and I'm thankful that a mother can
[49:04] recognize that that there's certain
[49:07] heartache and and there's certain
[49:09] separation that's hard but it's all done
[49:11] for God's purpose amen and the thing to
[49:14] do is find God's purpose and when you
[49:17] find God's purpose there's peace in
[49:19] knowing God's purpose amen all there are
[49:23] all other avenues where it will cause
[49:26] confusion frustration but God is the
[49:29] author of peace to them who walk in the
[49:31] perfect will of God amen now he says it
[49:35] again here now look he talks about a boy
[49:38] that was healed and look at this he said
[49:40] the young man I don't know who this was
[49:42] but he said the young man there was
[49:43] thrown out of a wreck just recently had
[49:45] a piece of angle iron went plumb through
[49:48] his side sweeping through him and struck
[49:50] the other side like that so this young
[49:52] man had steel or iron go right through
[49:57] his body and come out the other side and
[49:58] brother may have said a dear praying
[50:01] mother God spared him for some purpose
[50:05] why would God let
[50:07] and come through a boy's side and he
[50:09] should have died well God did it because
[50:11] it was going to be a testimony God was
[50:14] going to use the mother to pray for him
[50:16] and then he said since she told me I
[50:18] thought this morning I met him as I come
[50:20] in the hall shook his hands that aren't
[50:21] you the boy and he said yes sir
[50:23] he had a call to the ministry so brother
[50:25] made him show that God spared him
[50:27] because he was called for a purpose he
[50:30] was called to preach the gospel see God
[50:33] be merciful now my brother just a young
[50:35] man sitting with a brown coat may God
[50:37] grant that he will become a flaming
[50:38] light that were at the junction of the
[50:40] road sign to preach the gospel preached
[50:42] the full gospel preached all the Word of
[50:44] God and don't compromise for nothing
[50:46] amen
[50:47] stand right there at the post of duty
[50:49] God will make a great warrior out of
[50:51] them amen so see he had to have a
[50:54] praying mother a mother that would pray
[50:56] say God you've got a purpose for him
[50:58] don't take his life now let him live
[51:00] and then God shows brother man the
[51:02] vision he's going to be a preacher
[51:04] that's his purpose and God used the
[51:07] prayers of a mother and the purpose of
[51:09] Almighty God to work all things out for
[51:11] good because they love the Lord right
[51:15] now look at even brother Bram talks
[51:18] about his purpose in life here he is in
[51:21] Louisville Kentucky he said you know the
[51:23] weakness of man and we know the power of
[51:24] God and I know you'll send your angel
[51:26] the one who separated me from my
[51:28] mother's womb bringing me in this life
[51:30] and has ordained for this purpose so who
[51:33] took what was it them was it the Midwife
[51:36] that took brother Branham out of his
[51:37] mother's womb no he said there was an
[51:40] angel that did that amen

[51:45] angel brought you here hey man how'd you
[51:48] come out of your mother the angel
[51:50] brought you four didn't Paul say when
[51:52] the Lord separated me from my mother's
[51:54] womb there were something spiritual
[51:57] going on but there you were born amen
[52:00] there was something supernatural going
[52:02] on the day you were born God separated

[52:07] something some purpose for the kingdom
[52:09] of God it's time we found it amen
[52:12] if you don't know yet it's time you
[52:15] found it
[52:15] because motives said I stand here
[52:17] tonight ordained for this
[52:19] purpose and he said I'll make this
[52:21] statement boldly before thousands see
[52:23] when you know your purpose you can stand
[52:25] before hundreds 110 20 and you can
[52:28] boldly declare your purpose in life
[52:31] because God showed it to you amen
[52:34] he's never failed me yet he says and I
[52:38] know that you will not fails tonight but
[52:40] you will grant tonight that every
[52:41] secrets in the heart will be told to the
[52:43] people their diseases when we told them
[52:45] the demons that's binding them why were
[52:47] you born brother Branham to expose Satan
[52:50] that's why I was born
[52:52] so the people could see their sins their
[52:55] diseases their complexes their troubles
[52:57] that's why he was born and he said I'm
[53:00] here by the power of the angel bringing
[53:03] me separating me for this purpose that
[53:05] God's people might be set free amen
[53:08] does God want his people free yes he
[53:11] ordained people just for that purpose to
[53:13] set others free amen hallelujah of
[53:16] course he had to be set free first
[53:17] himself amen
[53:18] and then he knew what it's like to be
[53:21] free and then he could be set free
[53:23] hallelujah now look at this look I love

[55:04] there on the pulpit I'll step down and
[55:06] we'll have a we'll say our goodbyes and
[55:07] everything but I'll leave it right there

[55:17] prayer and then shows us the power of

[55:58] God keeps giving you more anointing but
[56:00] whoever said he said the Spirit of God
[56:02] grows inside of you right and so as you
[56:05] receive the word of God it grows and

[1:02:27] the power of God some days I'm trying to
[1:02:29] save and baptize them whatever God's
[1:02:33] will would be we don't know until we get
[1:02:36] here but we stand between the living in
[1:02:38] the dead we stand between demons and
[1:02:40] angels and we must be intercessors for
[1:02:43] the glory of God and the sister can do
[1:02:47] it a sister can stand there and be a
[1:02:49] priest and intercede for others he said
[1:02:55] and I say in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:02:58] Satan I break your powers Hey and leave
[1:03:02] this building in the name of Jesus
[1:03:04] Christ turn every one of them loose come
[1:03:06] out Satan leave them now you cannot look
[1:03:08] at this you can hear the screaming now
[1:03:09] you on the cots and stretchers and the
[1:03:11] chairs rise up you that sick and
[1:03:13] afflicted there they are awake walking
[1:03:14] up the crippled afflicted going heals he
[1:03:17] said stand up and that's where the
[1:03:18] sermon ends
[1:03:19] look at this mighty rebuke but he had to
[1:03:22] raise up the faith of the people and say
[1:03:23] I was born for this I was commissioned
[1:03:26] for as a prophet I'm a king I'm a priest
[1:03:29] I'm a preacher of all these things and
[1:03:31] then it raised the faith of the people
[1:03:33] and then he rebukes Satan and Satan has
[1:03:35] to leave and the cripples walk amen and
[1:03:39] so we need to see if there's no physical
[1:03:41] cripples here then let's have some
[1:03:42] spiritual cripples get their strength
[1:03:44] back amen and live the right kind of
[1:03:47] spiritual life before God hey man glory
[1:03:51] now let's look at a few quotes here now
[1:03:57] before we get to this so I'm gonna start
[1:03:58] getting into my youth message I'm gonna
[1:04:00] preach a morning service there Michigan
[1:04:02] and then the youth of the tri-state
[1:04:04] youth meeting next Sunday night I don't
[1:04:05] know what time that is but I'm gonna
[1:04:07] preach a little bit to them see every
[1:04:13] time we gather church were gathered in
[1:04:14] the name of Jesus Christ and we have to
[1:04:17] see what the Holy Spirit is leading us
[1:04:19] to now I mentioned this a few weeks ago
[1:04:23] when we were preaching on the number 40
[1:04:26] and brother Graham said Jesus went
[1:04:29] through 40 days of temptation right and
[1:04:30] but I said no man could be tempted
[1:04:32] harder than Jesus in fact I read it he
[1:04:34] said he was tempted above any man that
[1:04:36] ever could be tempted and how do you
[1:04:39] overcome by quoting the word policy
[1:04:43] there was quote the word and I was
[1:04:47] telling you how I you know even my
[1:04:49] sister went to the Louisiana camp
[1:04:51] meeting I think sister Wendy went as
[1:04:52] well my sister went there with her
[1:04:55] husband and the children and what a
[1:04:57] wonderful time they had and I always
[1:05:01] listened those and since 2014 they put
[1:05:03] it online I always listened to brother
[1:05:05] Donnie and the brother Ron and different
[1:05:07] ones like that and so I wanted to see
[1:05:09] like what is the word that they're
[1:05:10] hearing down there that they come back
[1:05:12] so powerful and on fire right what's the
[1:05:17] word you know here we're trying to
[1:05:19] rebuke Satan
[1:05:20] we're charge to cast out devils and do
[1:05:22] all these things and we hear about that
[1:05:24] going on there but that should be done
[1:05:26] in every single church service it's
[1:05:27] needed it shouldn't be limited to just
[1:05:30] camp meetings
[1:05:32] or youth meetings so I want to try to
[1:05:34] encourage the youth the next Sunday
[1:05:36] night there in Michigan I want to try to
[1:05:38] encourage them that if they didn't make
[1:05:40] the youth meeting there there's still a
[1:05:42] fountain of youth meeting that's open
[1:05:44] every time the doors are open there's a
[1:05:46] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[1:05:48] Emmanuel's veins amen and sinners
[1:05:51] plunged beneath that flood lose all
[1:05:53] their guilty stains amen there's the
[1:05:56] phone of youth open every service amen
[1:05:59] and you're looking at a preacher who
[1:06:01] never went to Louisiana camp meeting
[1:06:03] right I never went to the Switzerland
[1:06:06] meeting I never went to the Texas
[1:06:08] meeting I never went to the main meeting
[1:06:10] you can name any say Ohio family camp I
[1:06:12] never went to any that but I had been to
[1:06:15] the Fountain of Youth amen hey I didn't
[1:06:18] make it to any youth camp but I made it
[1:06:20] to the Fountain of Youth
[1:06:22] I burned the Christ and confess all my
[1:06:25] sin and say fill me with the Holy Spirit
[1:06:27] any day they met so I've got eternal
[1:06:32] youth a portion of the Lord inside of me
[1:06:36] are you with me
[1:06:38] so one encouraged a youth with that and
[1:06:43] so I listened to all the sermons from
[1:06:46] this Louisiana camp and I just want to
[1:06:49] just remind some of the I just want to
[1:06:51] rehearse you some of the great
[1:06:52] revelations that came out of that but
[1:06:54] also lets you know it's the same thing
[1:06:56] we preach here it's the same thing they
[1:06:59] preach in Lima the same thing they
[1:07:01] preach in Napoleon is that right amen
[1:07:05] the same thing brother Brooks preaches
[1:07:06] in Iowa praise God
[1:07:08] it might come a little different thought
[1:07:11] or a little different Channel but it all
[1:07:12] boils down to one thing having the
[1:07:15] anointing of God on you with the sword
[1:07:17] of the Spirit slay the demon and stand
[1:07:21] victorious just like Christ innately
[1:07:23] it all boils down to that because you
[1:07:26] will never have a harder battle than
[1:07:29] what Christ had after that 40 days of
[1:07:31] temptation will you know it's impossible
[1:07:36] so how did he overcome you overcome by
[1:07:39] the word right this isn't the sermon
[1:07:43] loose him and let him go
[1:07:45] brother Glover preach this and see I
[1:07:49] like how it's the noise of the Holy
[1:07:50] Spirit he said it's time to put your
[1:07:52] shoulder behind our pastors you realize
[1:07:54] your pastor needs you he says I was
[1:07:57] listenin to my glory he said but this is
[1:08:01] an age that doesn't want accountability
[1:08:03] they don't want to be accountable he
[1:08:07] said did you know you can give a pastor
[1:08:09] a breakthrough while he's preaching just
[1:08:11] by getting in the same Holy Spirit as
[1:08:13] the pastor listen do you want to see
[1:08:19] people bound here in their sins bound in
[1:08:21] their frustration bound in their fear
[1:08:23] bound in their discouragement or do want
[1:08:25] to see them set free what do you want to
[1:08:26] see so all's you gotta do is get in the
[1:08:28] Holy Spirit will set people free today
[1:08:30] raise god I mean if that is that simple
[1:08:33] right
[1:08:34] if if I'm in the sphere and you're in
[1:08:38] the spirit and we're all in the Holy
[1:08:39] Spirit what demon can stand before the
[1:08:41] Holy Spirit and he promised if two or
[1:08:44] three so Jesse and his wife and somebody
[1:08:47] else is in church there he is
[1:08:49] right in the midst of them amen glory we
[1:08:53] got a lot more than that this morning
[1:08:55] thank the Lord so his first climax was
[1:09:03] that the stone of Lazarus grave so the
[1:09:05] stone is like an addiction and yet he
[1:09:08] was Lazarus was able to hear the voice
[1:09:10] of the resurrection despite that stone
[1:09:14] being there and he said about 500 young
[1:09:18] people should come out of their graves
[1:09:20] he said Satan I rebuke you I said I
[1:09:23] rebuke you he left he said come up and
[1:09:25] let these young people come forth out of
[1:09:27] the grave so you if people feel like
[1:09:31] they're spiritually dead that stone it's
[1:09:34] like their addiction it's keeping them
[1:09:36] from coming out but the voice of God is
[1:09:38] so powerful if you hear God's voice
[1:09:40] speaking you today then you can come out
[1:09:44] and you can have new life in the name of
[1:09:47] Jesus Christ there's no stone like we
[1:09:50] preached on Easter there's no Roman seal
[1:09:52] there's no Jewish seal there's no seal
[1:09:55] that can keep the Word of God from
[1:09:57] coming to pass
[1:09:59] so that was the first major climax the
[1:10:02] second one he said Lazarus was standing
[1:10:04] before Jesus in grave clothes he has to
[1:10:07] be loose to worship so once you get life
[1:10:11] he says once you're alive and you're out
[1:10:13] from the grave you're serving God he
[1:10:15] said you need to be loose so you can
[1:10:17] worship he says your past is behind you
[1:10:20] your death is behind you and when you've
[1:10:23] been loose like Lazarus grave crows were
[1:10:25] behind him he said every filthy spirit
[1:10:28] is behind you you're free to worship
[1:10:30] he said Lazarus was free to praise God I
[1:10:33] wonder if we could praise God this
[1:10:34] morning
[1:10:35] well you can if your grave clothes are
[1:10:37] behind you right but if you're still
[1:10:41] bound up when your grave clothes bound
[1:10:42] up in your sin your condemnation your
[1:10:44] guilt you can't really worship God I
[1:10:46] mean like that thought good thought fast
[1:10:50] forward to the last service but that
[1:10:52] service was called another paradox and
[1:10:54] it ends with the great climax brother
[1:10:57] man told a story he ends it with Esther
[1:11:00] how Esther had to go before the king and
[1:11:02] the way she lived is that he put the
[1:11:04] scepter out toward remember that
[1:11:06] remember she was going to die she said
[1:11:08] but I'll die if I die die right but let
[1:11:11] me see the scepter right and so after we
[1:11:16] know got the scepter and then the
[1:11:18] brother connected it to a story brother
[1:11:20] ran told in recognizing your danis
[1:11:22] message he said brother man was talking
[1:11:24] about carrying this message to the world
[1:11:26] and he said there's a story one time of
[1:11:29] a king and all of his servants were busy
[1:11:31] so he handed his scepter to the boy and
[1:11:34] said you've got to deliver this message
[1:11:36] take the scepter with you and don't stop
[1:11:39] until you deliver the message and Votan
[1:11:41] said that was the type of him he's got
[1:11:43] the king's scepter
[1:11:44] he's got the Kings word and he's just
[1:11:47] got to he just has to run with the
[1:11:49] message don't stop for anybody just run
[1:11:51] with the word hallelujah and it brought
[1:11:56] up such a worship and revelation is that
[1:11:59] right and the encouraging thing for us
[1:12:02] is to remember if you've got the word
[1:12:04] it's like having the Kings Authority and
[1:12:07] you don't stop to talk to any demon you
[1:12:09] don't stop to compromise you don't stop
[1:12:11] to question the
[1:12:12] you carry the word and you don't stop
[1:12:16] until you get there the trouble is
[1:12:18] people will take up late of the world
[1:12:20] and they can't run like they ought to
[1:12:22] run are you with me so the whole the
[1:12:27] whole climax was this take the word run
[1:12:30] with it lay any sin beside and run the
[1:12:34] race with perseverance now does that
[1:12:36] sound like something we've never heard
[1:12:37] before or is that just a fresh take on a
[1:12:40] true revelation that's true that's just
[1:12:44] a fresh take on the familiar revelation
[1:12:47] we've got to lay every sin aside so the
[1:12:50] young people can be encouraged but that
[1:12:52] same message they're going to get back
[1:12:54] to their local church and they're going
[1:12:55] to need that same message in a different
[1:12:58] channel a different story a different
[1:12:59] scripture but the the battle is all the
[1:13:03] same die to sin and obey the Word of God
[1:13:06] walk in the spirit and do not satisfy
[1:13:09] the lusts of the flesh it's the same
[1:13:12] battle the greatest battle ever fought
[1:13:14] it may come in different channels but
[1:13:16] it's the same story it's obeying the
[1:13:19] Word of God and God will bless you oh
[1:13:21] [Music]
[1:13:24] thank you Lord and I've known two people
[1:13:29] that have gone Louisiana camp-meeting
[1:13:30] shouted screamed danced spoke in tongues
[1:13:33] came both came back saying that the Holy
[1:13:35] Ghost
[1:13:37] one of them lived it for a while but
[1:13:40] then pretty soon bitterness caught their
[1:13:42] heart and they ended up have a little
[1:13:44] family and divorce and now live it with
[1:13:46] another person in adultery Church
[1:13:49] whatever they got there might have been
[1:13:50] a great blessing but that was not the
[1:13:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:53] the baptism the Holy Ghost keeps you
[1:13:56] from sin when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:13:58] you're a new creature in Christ Jesus
[1:14:01] amen
[1:14:02] the old things have passed away adultery
[1:14:06] is passed away but faithful manners are
[1:14:10] faithful a marital faithfulness that is
[1:14:13] the new creature and that's what you
[1:14:15] live because you've got life to do it
[1:14:19] the second one married their own person
[1:14:22] the person beat on her the person did
[1:14:26] drugs molested children did all these
[1:14:30] kind of things and then she herself got
[1:14:32] addicted to cigarettes and and movies
[1:14:34] and hardly go to the house of God and
[1:14:37] yet both came back from a camp me saying
[1:14:40] I'm born again so the reason I'm telling
[1:14:43] you this is not to make people look bad
[1:14:45] or to make you try to figure out who it
[1:14:47] is don't worry about who it is but worry
[1:14:49] about your life be concerned
[1:14:51] am i manifesting the life of Christ am i
[1:14:53] carrying the word or my just carrying a
[1:14:56] temporary anointing we got to carry the
[1:14:58] eternal Word of God it's going to be
[1:15:02] more than just on our flesh and on our
[1:15:03] minds
[1:15:04] it's got to be your nature it's going to
[1:15:06] be a part of you and you've got power to
[1:15:08] overcome every single day amen Larry and
[1:15:14] after after I listened to all those
[1:15:15] sermons I wonder I wonder if my nieces I
[1:15:18] saw him shouting on the tape I wonder if
[1:15:20] they're shouting in the church this
[1:15:20] morning in other words did that shouting
[1:15:25] continue do they still shout at the word
[1:15:28] or is the word you know and you can
[1:15:30] apply to anybody that was there now we
[1:15:35] all go through trials but what I'm
[1:15:37] saying is if you love the word at a
[1:15:39] youth meeting then you should love the
[1:15:41] word at your home church in fact the
[1:15:45] brother said this can I give you one
[1:15:46] word of advice he said when you get home
[1:15:48] and the fire is not there and brother
[1:15:50] Donnie's not running across the pulpit
[1:15:52] he said the God that was with you when
[1:15:54] you got prayed for is the God that will
[1:15:56] be with you when you get home he said at
[1:15:58] home it's time to manifest what you got
[1:16:01] amen I didn't know yeah that's why I'm
[1:16:05] not big on sending out our children to
[1:16:06] camp meetings because I didn't get the
[1:16:08] Holy Ghost at a camp meeting I got it at
[1:16:10] the fountain of youth
[1:16:11] as I said I got in the presence of
[1:16:13] Christ and no one brother Amen says I
[1:16:15] got the Holy Ghost in 2003 no one's had
[1:16:18] to bake me push me encourage me to do
[1:16:21] anything for God well because there's a
[1:16:23] living water inside of me that's pushing
[1:16:26] me
[1:16:28] our YouTube views are approaching 1
[1:16:30] million so in those in the anointing
[1:16:33] God's given me almost 1 million people
[1:16:34] have had a chance to hear this word of
[1:16:36] God amen and I know fewer of you are
[1:16:41] gonna receive it so I'm not expecting
[1:16:43] more testimonies attacks although I wish
[1:16:45] there was mercy but see this is the
[1:16:49] reality of the Word of God I like what
[1:16:56] he said he was preaching on the scepter
[1:16:58] I love what he said he said he said when
[1:17:03] I get to my home church he said when I
[1:17:05] come home and I don't fall asleep
[1:17:08] through the service show them the
[1:17:09] scepter in other words show them this is
[1:17:11] why I don't fall asleep in church
[1:17:12] anymore
[1:17:12] because I've got the Word of God is that
[1:17:16] right that's what he said I could show
[1:17:18] dia he said will they believe me and he
[1:17:22] said if people won't believe you show
[1:17:24] them the word in other words show them
[1:17:26] the Word of God that you're running with
[1:17:27] God purposed me to be a preacher so I've
[1:17:30] been running like a preacher Amen if God
[1:17:33] purpose you to be a mother you run like
[1:17:36] a mother you run with that don't let
[1:17:37] anything hold you down you run with
[1:17:39] God's scepter you run with the way don't
[1:17:42] let anything compromise on anything
[1:17:44] praise God and I think the people I
[1:17:51] think the young people need to hear that
[1:17:52] don't you
[1:17:53] we if we're not careful we make like it
[1:17:56] could be well if I go to this church
[1:17:57] here in Canada or if I go in Tennessee
[1:18:00] it's like I'm going on my spiritual
[1:18:02] Mecca right I got to go on my message
[1:18:06] Mecca if I don't go there I'll never
[1:18:08] I'll never feel as holy as I ought to
[1:18:10] that's a lie
[1:18:13] being in Christ is not being in a
[1:18:15] physical place being in Christ is being
[1:18:18] baptized with the Holy Ghost is that
[1:18:21] right Church don't get me wrong God may
[1:18:23] use a camp-meeting
[1:18:24] God may use that brothers Church that
[1:18:27] new brother bram God may use that but
[1:18:29] the reality of it is is that that is why
[1:18:31] God sent the Holy Ghost so you know what
[1:18:33] the go anyplace you're just gonna die to
[1:18:35] yourself amen and he can meet you
[1:18:38] anytime any
[1:18:40] place anywhere haha that's right
[1:18:46] to see all these major points all the
[1:18:49] dollars just hearing the word dying out
[1:18:52] being free from sin free from this free
[1:18:55] from that temptation and just obeying
[1:18:57] God with the anointing of the Holy Ghost
[1:19:00] that's what all this is about are you
[1:19:03] with me
[1:19:03] last night I'm gonna preach to the youth
[1:19:05] I know what I'm going to preach to the
[1:19:07] congregation it's gonna be the zeal of
[1:19:09] the Lord willing unless he changes it
[1:19:11] the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up
[1:19:14] because I believe I can help their
[1:19:17] church maybe to strengthen their their
[1:19:20] home church and you if you've been here
[1:19:23] even listen to me what the Holy Spirit's
[1:19:25] been giving me it's about it's all about
[1:19:27] us taking advantage of what's happening
[1:19:29] right now not overlooking these services
[1:19:33] not dying and getting cold and back
[1:19:35] siding not missing our time to redeem a
[1:19:38] man this is our time like Jason email me
[1:19:41] he caught that on the sermon I
[1:19:42] appreciate that brother Jason he caught
[1:19:43] it last week
[1:19:44] if we don't redeem it in a certain time
[1:19:46] it's lost if we don't redeem our first
[1:19:51] little it'll be lost we have a space to
[1:19:54] repent and God help us to repent amen
[1:19:58] you got that I appreciate that
[1:20:02] now God is merciful Church God is very
[1:20:05] merciful and that's why we appreciate
[1:20:08] the Lord but there's a point where God
[1:20:12] says okay that's fine then he knows that
[1:20:14] person will never seek it again that's
[1:20:16] why we got to be constantly seeking more
[1:20:18] of the Lord everybody with me now I told
[1:20:22] you I just got to preach that I tried to
[1:20:23] preach it last week about ran out of
[1:20:24] time right here on my notes I had my
[1:20:27] papers all ready to go I just couldn't
[1:20:29] get to it I got to warm up a little bit
[1:20:32] now I'm gonna skip here a little bit so
[1:20:35] I get to the end of this message brother
[1:20:39] branham tells the story of Mary's the
[1:20:41] belief remember she was a carry of the
[1:20:43] word and the church said she was not the
[1:20:45] word when she was a carrier of the word
[1:20:47] and so are you you're a carrier of the
[1:20:51] word your reflects
[1:20:55] benefice but you were not all he talks
[1:20:59] about other spring was rising hi new
[1:21:01] Jayden skies as they she started the
[1:21:03] street that morning with the water pot
[1:21:04] underarm and her little youthful mind
[1:21:06] was thinking of the day before how at
[1:21:08] the synagogue where she and her spouse
[1:21:10] husband had sit and listen to his sermon
[1:21:11] from the rabbi so Mary went to church on
[1:21:15] the Sabbath
[1:21:16] a lot of our friends don't know why and
[1:21:21] how in his talk he had explained to the
[1:21:23] people why they were selling that land
[1:21:24] that had been a promise that God had
[1:21:25] made their father Abraham hundred years
[1:21:27] before they should hurt the land and how
[1:21:29] it went got it made a promise he could
[1:21:30] not go back on that promise and that
[1:21:32] they come through the Red Sea as on dry
[1:21:34] ground and how that before that God had
[1:21:35] taken them on the hands the enemy and
[1:21:37] God loves to take his children out of
[1:21:40] the hands the enemy let me read that
[1:21:43] again I don't know if everybody heard me
[1:21:44] and God loves to deliver the Saints that
[1:21:48] bride of Jesus Christ from the enemy
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:52] he loves it he loves it he's proved it
[1:21:58] in the way he did little Ricky now this
[1:22:00] is a part I don't get to this I don't
[1:22:01] have the courts up here but do you
[1:22:02] remember that story where brother BAM
[1:22:04] said a baby was dying of cancer its head
[1:22:06] was twice the size of its normal size
[1:22:08] and the man gave brother man tithing and
[1:22:10] he said well I'm gonna give it back to
[1:22:12] you because you need it for your medical
[1:22:13] bills and the man said no program said I
[1:22:16] feel led to pray for Ricky he said I
[1:22:18] went there I prayed for Ricky and he
[1:22:19] said he said Satan in the name of Jesus
[1:22:21] Christ I placed the blood of Jesus
[1:22:23] Christ between you Satan and this child
[1:22:26] and then he left
[1:22:28] he just let it go and then at this
[1:22:32] sermon you can hear they bring Ricky up
[1:22:35] on stage a man and he's going in God
[1:22:38] he's seven eight months here or seven
[1:22:40] eight eight eight months old and he's
[1:22:42] good and God and brother man said look
[1:22:44] he proved it there
[1:22:45] and just after a matter of a few days
[1:22:48] the cancer died and it vanished and
[1:22:50] Ricky was brought to the meetings and
[1:22:52] Votan said let's offer God a prayer of
[1:22:55] thanksgiving
[1:22:58] like we did with Jason the Lord answered
[1:23:00] Jason's prayer thank you Lord we don't
[1:23:05] want to be ungrateful like the lepers
[1:23:07] right the nine lepers we want to be
[1:23:09] grateful if God does suffer me I want to
[1:23:11] come and thank him and give him praise
[1:23:13] as they thank you Jesus you provided
[1:23:15] amen
[1:23:16] in every season you've been with me amen
[1:23:19] you've never forsaken me you've never
[1:23:21] left me you always been merciful you've
[1:23:24] always been gracious and you answer my
[1:23:26] prayer he said you took them from the
[1:23:32] hand of the enemy and by great signs and
[1:23:34] wonders and fed them in the wilderness
[1:23:35] for forty years and they came out of
[1:23:37] wareness a 40-year journey not a feeble
[1:23:39] one among them even their clothes and it
[1:23:41] wear her down what a great God that they
[1:23:43] had and neither do our clothes we're
[1:23:47] done I'm talking about the white robe
[1:23:48] that you got I'm talking about the
[1:23:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost that eternal
[1:23:52] life you got that's the seed of God that
[1:23:55] I'm talking about that row doesn't wear
[1:23:58] out amen
[1:24:00] now look they were little they said the
[1:24:03] sermon got ruined by the rabbi and I
[1:24:06] hope you don't leave Church saying well
[1:24:07] the sermon was good until brother Jesse
[1:24:09] ruined it I sure hope that doesn't get
[1:24:12] happen today hey god help me but at the
[1:24:15] end of the message he ruined what he had
[1:24:17] been talking about when he said those
[1:24:19] great days of Jehovah dealing with
[1:24:22] people like that it wasn't necessary no
[1:24:24] more they become settled down in their
[1:24:28] homeland they didn't exactly need
[1:24:29] miracles no more they had good doctors
[1:24:31] for their sickness were just certainly
[1:24:32] all right and they had had a they were
[1:24:34] better off that their they had their
[1:24:36] homes I just didn't need god of miracles
[1:24:38] anymore what a slick devil that was to
[1:24:43] start the sermon really good but then
[1:24:45] close with the wrong idea and Mary
[1:24:48] Joseph resisted there it was a good
[1:24:50] message until he ruined it at the end he
[1:24:53] said God doesn't want to visit the
[1:24:55] message people anymore he only did those
[1:24:57] things in the days of brother Moses I
[1:24:59] mean brother Branham right and he said
[1:25:03] it ruined he said but somehow that
[1:25:05] didn't satisfy the thirst and hunger of
[1:25:06] Jos America you see they were engaged to
[1:25:09] be married soon
[1:25:11] Oh God may God help me not to ruin this
[1:25:14] sermon - today by God's grace to let you
[1:25:17] know that Jesus Christ is here just like
[1:25:20] he is anywhere else this morning and
[1:25:23] he's not a guy that used to do miracles
[1:25:25] he still does miracles you believe that
[1:25:28] you and I can't produce it we can't work
[1:25:31] him up we got to wait till he says so
[1:25:34] and be faithful until he does it might
[1:25:38] be 25 years it doesn't matter how long
[1:25:40] it is you and I just need to be faithful
[1:25:42] standing in faith believing all the Word
[1:25:45] of God crossing on anything that exalts
[1:25:47] itself against the knowledge of God
[1:25:49] stand there like a soldier until God
[1:25:51] comes on the scene as the custom was
[1:26:01] after the service is over why they would
[1:26:05] go home and with her sometimes their
[1:26:07] home for where their home was just over
[1:26:08] the hill where Joseph the carpenter was
[1:26:10] building a special little house you know
[1:26:11] it had to have that special touch to it
[1:26:13] because it was the one he was going to
[1:26:15] bring his little bride to the doors had
[1:26:17] to be just perfect the windows had to be
[1:26:19] plumb for that was where he spent his
[1:26:21] time with his little wife and after the
[1:26:25] new meal they were gone the front porch
[1:26:26] perhaps and look across towards a little
[1:26:28] home and dream at the time when they
[1:26:30] would be together happy living at their
[1:26:31] house and how the roses would be around
[1:26:33] the windows and so forth then on this
[1:26:35] certain Sunday afternoon Joe said this
[1:26:37] seems to be a strange day and Mary said
[1:26:42] you know since I heard the rabbi say
[1:26:44] that this great God that brought us here
[1:26:45] and made us what we are that he doesn't
[1:26:48] have to do the things like first now
[1:26:50] like he did then I've been thinking for
[1:26:52] a long time that if this God was as
[1:26:54] great in the days of our fathers as he
[1:26:56] was the days of our grandfathers then
[1:26:58] wising just the same great God today in
[1:27:01] other words something that preacher said
[1:27:03] stayed with me from yesterday and I God
[1:27:05] I hope that happens today amen
[1:27:07] I hope something good I say today by
[1:27:09] God's leading not mine stays with you
[1:27:12] and you think about it tomorrow
[1:27:14] amen but see this is the kind of
[1:27:17] believer Mary was but he meant she
[1:27:19] ponder she is heard - where she just
[1:27:21] didn't let it go out she pondered these
[1:27:23] things in her heart
[1:27:25] I'm going to go home after church and
[1:27:27] I'm gonna do this this is that but
[1:27:28] Joseph Mary said I'm gonna go home after
[1:27:30] church I'm gonna sit on a little swing
[1:27:32] and we're looking across at our future
[1:27:34] home that's what we need to do is look
[1:27:35] to our future home amen and talk about
[1:27:39] the sermon line that was a wonderful
[1:27:41] message that the Holy Spirit preached
[1:27:43] today it wasn't really density because
[1:27:45] it was discerning my thoughts and the
[1:27:46] word is the discerner of the thoughts
[1:27:47] and tents of the heart amen I like what
[1:27:51] she does next though that's only good
[1:27:55] thinking and she goes back in the house
[1:27:57] and said we'll just read some CNN and
[1:28:02] want some true love stories no he said
[1:28:06] we'll read some of the scriptures
[1:28:09] wouldn't we be closer to God if he read
[1:28:11] the Bible after church amen praise the
[1:28:17] Lord and just wherever God will lead us
[1:28:21] and she picked up the scroll of Isaiah
[1:28:26] just right where God wanted it and she
[1:28:29] goes over to Isaiah 9:6 where it says
[1:28:32] unto us to soar and the son is born unto
[1:28:34] us a child is given and she looks over
[1:28:38] with her lovely soft eyes and said to
[1:28:39] her husband to me Joseph what do you
[1:28:41] think the Prophet was speaking of her
[1:28:43] notice she didn't preach at her husband
[1:28:45] she didn't tell her husband what it was
[1:28:48] all about she said what see what she's
[1:28:50] mean
[1:28:51] she's being submissive like a woman
[1:28:52] should be praise the Lord
[1:28:55] they recognized what other preachers off
[1:28:58] a little bit but let's go to the Word of
[1:28:59] God maybe word of God's got our answer
[1:29:01] amen
[1:29:02] I like that why Mary I believe that he
[1:29:06] would speak of the Messiah that it is to
[1:29:07] come and that's why that we could keep
[1:29:09] our bloodstream clean and don't mix with
[1:29:11] other nations because someday God's
[1:29:12] going to send that Messiah among us huh
[1:29:16] what appropriate scripture to read for
[1:29:18] that occasion this is why we stay holy
[1:29:22] this is why we only marry Christians
[1:29:23] right because we're trying to produce a
[1:29:27] godly generation that's going to take
[1:29:29] the rapture when the Messiah comes for
[1:29:30] the second time we don't yoke ourselves
[1:29:35] unequally we
[1:29:36] they yoke with Christians amen she was
[1:29:41] thinking on this as she went along the
[1:29:44] side of the street real early the Sun
[1:29:46] was rising and she was going out the
[1:29:47] public well to get her daily supply
[1:29:49] water usually the women come just a
[1:29:50] little later to get the water but Mary
[1:29:52] somehow she was led to go early that
[1:29:54] morning when she'd be all by herself
[1:29:57] sometimes you're led to do things just
[1:29:59] all by yourself sometimes you're led to
[1:30:02] do things a little out of ordinary and
[1:30:06] says she walked along thinking on these
[1:30:08] things she felt a strange feeling around
[1:30:11] her and you know it's usually when we're
[1:30:12] thinking about God and keeping our minds
[1:30:14] on God that God comes down to us I
[1:30:16] remember one time you got healed of her
[1:30:18] arm trouble she couldn't lift her arm I
[1:30:19] remember that morning I was going to
[1:30:21] preach on something else and all of a
[1:30:22] sudden the Holy Spirit brought that
[1:30:23] thought the keys to the kingdom
[1:30:24] I'm like well I must be crazy I'm gonna
[1:30:26] change my sermon two hours before church
[1:30:29] so anyways I go preach it she comes up
[1:30:31] for healing and said well it's still
[1:30:33] hurtful she left but when she got home
[1:30:35] she started cooking dinner she said she
[1:30:37] felt the power of God and she raised her
[1:30:39] arm and she was healed right then and
[1:30:40] there sometimes it comes a little
[1:30:44] differently praise God so he got to be
[1:30:46] open to how God might move differently
[1:30:48] but we got to be walking in the spirit
[1:30:50] amen
[1:30:51] thinking about the word that was
[1:30:53] preached thinking about the scripture
[1:30:56] that we read after the church service Oh
[1:30:58] bro Jessie after the sermon I'm done I
[1:31:01] get to go back to my regular life well
[1:31:03] you need to get saved then because when
[1:31:05] you're Christian that's all you want to
[1:31:07] do is meditate on the things of God you
[1:31:10] don't have to separate lives you got one
[1:31:11] life faith there's not two lies there's
[1:31:14] one of that I'm a new creature in Christ
[1:31:16] Jesus I think it's one of the great
[1:31:23] troubles of the people this day we have
[1:31:24] too many other things in our mind even
[1:31:26] when we come to the healing service we
[1:31:27] seem to think well I did not get a
[1:31:29] prayer card tonight or perhaps I'll not
[1:31:31] be prayed for we will never be able to
[1:31:33] accomplish much as long as we keep those
[1:31:35] kind of thoughts this Angeles Temple is
[1:31:39] thirsting for an outbreak of the Holy
[1:31:40] Spirit not only that but the whole
[1:31:43] United States are you are you part of
[1:31:45] United States you should say yes
[1:31:48] speaking
[1:31:49] is speaking of the Christian realm is
[1:31:51] waiting for revival in our time look at
[1:31:54] brother Ram alludes to this is in 1959
[1:31:57] and I believe that God has already let
[1:32:00] it happen so but Ram said the revivals
[1:32:02] already started what the revival of the
[1:32:04] bride Amen he said and we're just so
[1:32:08] pushing it somewhere else
[1:32:10] so Pentecost was pushing it somewhere
[1:32:12] else and if we're not careful message
[1:32:14] churches will push the Holy Ghost
[1:32:15] revival somewhere else oh we don't want
[1:32:18] to draw closer to God we just want to do
[1:32:20] ours we just want to get through life
[1:32:21] and have a easy life in South living we
[1:32:23] got to be hungry and thirsting for
[1:32:25] righteousness until he'll pass over us
[1:32:30] and our time of grace will be gone I
[1:32:32] heard a sermon on that this week it
[1:32:33] really blessed me it was out of James
[1:32:35] where it says what is your life remember
[1:32:39] those words what is your life those four
[1:32:40] words what is your life and James said
[1:32:43] it's like a vapor it's here today gone
[1:32:46] tomorrow
[1:32:47] what is your life it didn't ask what is
[1:32:50] life because we'd say oh that's God's
[1:32:51] Spirit what does he turn alive and it
[1:32:55] has what what is God's - and that's that
[1:32:57] it said what is Jose's life
[1:33:00] what is brother Aaron's life
[1:33:03] what is brother Jesse's life what is
[1:33:07] your life what is your life your life is
[1:33:11] a vapor and it's going to be used as
[1:33:13] short and it's going to be used
[1:33:14] somewhere how we're using the life that
[1:33:17] God gave us what is your life it's to be
[1:33:20] a carrier of the word hey that is to
[1:33:24] serve God's purpose on this earth to
[1:33:26] carry the word what is your life your
[1:33:31] life I'm not talking my my life what's
[1:33:33] your life what is it is it an offering
[1:33:37] unto God is it a selfish thing for
[1:33:39] yourself something trying to save and
[1:33:41] and do something good for yourself or is
[1:33:43] it an offering and sacrifice unto God
[1:33:45] Almighty what is your life I hope you
[1:33:49] don't see it as your life I hope you see
[1:33:51] it as God's life amen what did I do
[1:33:59] Ceri hey Siri turn off no I just turned
[1:34:04] on my series sorry oh mercy there we go
[1:34:10] live it was always you know it was
[1:34:13] always the microphone zapping remember
[1:34:15] that well no one here would remember
[1:34:18] that well others have a mic going off in
[1:34:22] the middle of the service okay let's
[1:34:23] move on from that it kind of meant use
[1:34:25] that shake everybody up and now we got
[1:34:26] our phones blue go he says this see we
[1:34:32] can't fill our minds with these thoughts
[1:34:33] now let's be positive in our thinking
[1:34:37] let's believe that this night this
[1:34:39] revive will break in Angeles temple
[1:34:40] tonight let's believe this is the night
[1:34:42] that God will do exceedingly abundantly
[1:34:44] above all that we could do or think he
[1:34:45] will do tonight don't take no for an
[1:34:48] answer it's when we think of those
[1:34:49] things you create an atmosphere around
[1:34:51] you now we've all heard us a hundred
[1:34:53] times
[1:34:53] you create a atmosphere well who came to
[1:34:57] create an atmosphere this morning I'm
[1:34:58] not going to raise your hands but who
[1:34:59] did who came here and your thought was
[1:35:01] I'm gonna create an atmosphere today God
[1:35:05] is gonna do exceedingly abundantly above
[1:35:07] all we ask your thing or does only
[1:35:11] happen when brother bender odd comes or
[1:35:13] brother cam what what is our what is our
[1:35:19] life what are we thinking of this
[1:35:25] shouldn't just take place at a special
[1:35:27] meeting this should be every time we're
[1:35:29] gathered in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:35:33] you're supposed to create an atmosphere
[1:35:35] here I wish he would close his big
[1:35:40] yapper already is it time to go to
[1:35:43] Panera yet we gotta be careful of our
[1:35:48] attitudes
[1:35:50] we're supposed to be craters we're
[1:35:55] supposed to have
[1:35:55] a portion of God inside of us we're
[1:36:02] supposed to be living for other people
[1:36:09] see like we said with those two those
[1:36:13] two schools making brother branham God
[1:36:15] are making the bride God why could only
[1:36:17] oh we gotta have a big revival for the
[1:36:20] bride and then God will come down all
[1:36:22] the bride's got to be gather together
[1:36:23] special meetings main churches people
[1:36:26] men that knew the prophet of God or just
[1:36:30] play the tape and then the Spirit of God
[1:36:32] see making everything else the
[1:36:34] atmosphere instead of you and I creating
[1:36:36] the atmosphere putting the
[1:36:38] responsibility well let brother man do
[1:36:40] it no we gotta let the big group do it
[1:36:41] you and I have to do it it's yours it's
[1:36:45] my responsibility your responsibility to
[1:36:48] redeem the time and it will always be
[1:36:52] that way when she was thinking on this
[1:36:57] her eyes raised up she thought she saw a
[1:36:59] light I'm gonna skip ahead
[1:37:00] he said well is there something and she
[1:37:02] goes on turns a corner starting up
[1:37:04] towards the public well she drops a
[1:37:05] little hand again imposed a little shawl
[1:37:07] over shoulders and she went about the
[1:37:08] way thing of what does Isaiah 9:6 mean
[1:37:12] if I can say it like this you and I one
[1:37:15] day be walking along by the Amen and
[1:37:17] we'll be thinking about the word what
[1:37:20] does the voice mean what does first
[1:37:22] Thessalonians 4:17 we know what the
[1:37:25] shout means what is the voice me what is
[1:37:28] the voice and then maybe we'll hear a
[1:37:31] voice of cry well here's some shout out
[1:37:35] or some angelic something and pretty
[1:37:37] soon we'll see st. Paul or brother
[1:37:39] branham hey I wonder what the Trump of
[1:37:43] God means and pretty soon was here a
[1:37:45] Trump blowing and our bodies to be
[1:37:48] swallowed up in life and will rise up to
[1:37:50] meet Christ in the air see we've got to
[1:37:52] be meditating upon God's Word and the
[1:37:55] scripture that we need to fulfill that's
[1:38:00] when the Holy Spirit came a virgin shall
[1:38:06] conceive
[1:38:07] and she didn't seem to think I'm the
[1:38:09] virgin it's me God chose me that's the
[1:38:14] purpose of my life God or they need to
[1:38:16] manifest Isaiah 9:6 God ordained me to
[1:38:20] manifest 1st Corinthians 4:17 how do
[1:38:23] they chose me to be in the rapture Amen
[1:38:29] T when God put something on somebody's
[1:38:32] heart he's ready to do something that's
[1:38:34] the reason he's ready to give the
[1:38:35] angelus temple an outbreak of the Spirit
[1:38:36] because it's on your hearts see if we
[1:38:39] want to revive with our church here we
[1:38:40] want to see people healed it's got to be
[1:38:42] on our hearts first and who's going to
[1:38:44] put it on your heart the Holy Spirit but
[1:38:46] you've got to let them put it up in your
[1:38:47] heart as you before you come to church
[1:38:49] and then when you come to church it'll
[1:38:51] be on your heart then you have a burden
[1:38:53] to create an atmosphere so God can move
[1:38:55] here but not only here
[1:38:56] but moving other places move everywhere
[1:38:58] amen
[1:39:00] the third pole and no name use the third
[1:39:02] pole it was out there a couple of times
[1:39:05] it was up here you know speaking the
[1:39:07] word and then bringing back life you
[1:39:09] know from brotherwe but most of it was
[1:39:11] out there so we need to know that God
[1:39:13] can move anywhere so we must be ready at
[1:39:15] all times and seasons instant in season
[1:39:18] out of season that's why we tell those
[1:39:24] young people we we got to be instant see
[1:39:26] a lot of people just get like I said
[1:39:27] those two people they just get ready for
[1:39:29] God at the camp-meeting time but we got
[1:39:31] to be ready for God at all times
[1:39:32] oh boy I'm really gonna be on fire for I
[1:39:35] get back by they men from the camp
[1:39:37] meeting I should be on fire every
[1:39:38] service if now I'm a rebuke to
[1:39:42] Christianity is that right or I'm just
[1:39:46] struggling I need God's mercy I need
[1:39:48] God's deliverance that's right he says
[1:39:56] in wash
[1:39:56] you raise her head again she just
[1:39:57] remember brought her shawl over she
[1:40:01] raised her head again and I just she
[1:40:03] that he said I just love to feel the
[1:40:04] presence of the Holy Spirit
[1:40:06] it just gives that blessed assurance you
[1:40:09] don't always have to see it it's there
[1:40:11] anyhow and as she moved along she raised
[1:40:16] her head and there stood this great
[1:40:17] light before perhaps the same pillar
[1:40:18] fire the LED children of Israel come
[1:40:21] walking from the light came the great
[1:40:22] Archangel Gabriel said Hail Mary hail
[1:40:24] means to stop blessed art thou among
[1:40:26] women hard tell the other woman went to
[1:40:31] the well that morning perhaps thinking
[1:40:33] about the wash and they had to do some
[1:40:34] tasks I'm society in the church they had
[1:40:36] to take care of but Mary was thinking on
[1:40:38] the scriptures was not at Cleophus and
[1:40:41] his friend on the first resurrection
[1:40:43] morning as they were walk thinking on
[1:40:45] the scriptures when Jesus appeared to
[1:40:46] them I hope you came to church thinking
[1:40:50] on Jesus today let me try to close now
[1:40:54] this is I love this I don't you probably
[1:40:55] heard us before I if I had I forgot it
[1:40:57] program said and she saw this great
[1:41:00] angel it started the little version she
[1:41:01] stopped she came closer to her and
[1:41:03] saluted her and gave her a message that
[1:41:06] was a hard message for that child to
[1:41:08] receive for she wasn't nothing but a
[1:41:13] girl she's probably about Lydia's age
[1:41:16] Lydia's 14
[1:41:17] I think remember said she might have
[1:41:18] been 16 Mary might have been 16 years
[1:41:20] old so think about Lydia and God gave
[1:41:25] her something to believe that was more
[1:41:27] outstanding and hard to believe than
[1:41:30] anything he'd ever did look at God God
[1:41:38] had such confidence in a hundred year
[1:41:42] old Abraham that he gave him the hardest
[1:41:44] thing to believe ever no no he gave he
[1:41:47] gave Abraham a hard thing to believe but
[1:41:49] the hardest thing he ever gave anybody
[1:41:51] believed was a 16 year old virgin girl
[1:41:55] that liked to sit after church and talk
[1:41:57] about the word and say well I enjoyed
[1:41:59] that sermon oh I can't wait to get to my
[1:42:01] future home hubby and that going to be
[1:42:03] wonderful
[1:42:04] hey let's read the Bible amen
[1:42:06] Oh God to reveal it to her
[1:42:10] God could reveal the body shake say you
[1:42:12] and I man we just knotted meditate upon
[1:42:14] the Word of God God said I'm going to
[1:42:22] choose some great soldier I'm going to
[1:42:24] choose some great warrior of the faith
[1:42:26] to do something I've never done before
[1:42:29] and he chooses a little girl like Lydia
[1:42:33] he bypassed the preacher the rabbi of
[1:42:35] course he was back slidden already
[1:42:38] preaching dog God could never do
[1:42:40] anything
[1:42:40] God can't move and our church services
[1:42:42] he can only move at Jeffersonville you
[1:42:44] know that you got to play the tape you
[1:42:48] do need to play the tape at your home
[1:42:49] you do you listen to it no he chose he
[1:42:54] bypassed everyone and went to a little
[1:42:57] humble virgin little girl because he
[1:43:01] knew she meditated upon the Word of God
[1:43:06] and here this little woman had to
[1:43:10] believe something that had never
[1:43:11] happened before
[1:43:14] in church let me say like this you might
[1:43:16] be reading that but listen we have to
[1:43:18] believe something that's never happened
[1:43:20] before God's never raptured a large
[1:43:23] group of people off the earth that never
[1:43:26] died before
[1:43:28] he raptured Abraham and Sarah but they'd
[1:43:30] already died so he's doing something
[1:43:33] he's asking you and I to believe
[1:43:35] something that's never happened before
[1:43:37] that we never have to die that we can
[1:43:41] bypass natural death we can bypass
[1:43:43] spiritual death and we can be swallowed
[1:43:45] up in life and have a glorified body
[1:43:47] hallelujah and we never have to taste
[1:43:50] that all because Jesus already tasted
[1:43:53] death for us amen and it wasn't because
[1:43:57] Mary was somebody special it's just that
[1:43:59] she was in the right lineage and her
[1:44:02] character met all God's requirements I'm
[1:44:05] glad I'm in the right lineage where'd
[1:44:06] you come from I came out of Christ amen
[1:44:09] I was chosen in Christ before the
[1:44:11] foundation of the world
[1:44:12] oh thank you Lord and I watch her she
[1:44:17] didn't question that
[1:44:19] she said behold the handmaid of the Lord
[1:44:22] be done to me according to thy word now
[1:44:27] I'm gonna close in just a moment
[1:44:29] Harpreet about an hour and a half here
[1:44:32] but let me get to this I want to look at
[1:44:36] these few thoughts I didn't get a chance
[1:44:37] to develop them all the way but brother
[1:44:41] Adam said each person needs to be
[1:44:43] anointed if we want to see God move yes
[1:44:47] each person has to bring an anointing
[1:44:49] like brother cam said in heavenly places
[1:44:51] create an atmosphere each person has to
[1:44:54] be anointed let me show it to you I
[1:44:58] think I got it way up here at the top
[1:45:01] yeah your dish program says so you say
[1:45:05] let's let the preacher do it this is an
[1:45:07] individual ferret's every one of us the
[1:45:11] preacher might do it himself he might
[1:45:13] praying at his so blessed which I did
[1:45:15] thank the Lord and stay on afternoon
[1:45:18] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:45:20] to walk in the prints of his
[1:45:22] congregation anointed feeling the power
[1:45:24] of God but unless that congregation has
[1:45:28] stayed in the same way see it makes a
[1:45:32] difference he's got to get it the
[1:45:33] congregation under condition but then if
[1:45:36] the congregation is ready to meet the
[1:45:37] Holy Spirit then I'll tell you sinners
[1:45:39] will weep their way to Calvary if we can
[1:45:43] just take it as an individual you're
[1:45:45] just as responsible as any of those
[1:45:46] ministers God's gonna hold you as an
[1:45:48] individual responsible and let me share
[1:45:53] this
[1:45:53] few weeks ago I was laying on my face
[1:45:56] here and I said Lord I'm laying my palms
[1:45:58] like they did on the on the the good
[1:46:01] with a good Sunday well Palm Sunday I
[1:46:03] said as they lay their palms here I'm
[1:46:05] laying my palms here let the King ride
[1:46:08] in and that was the morning that sister
[1:46:10] hua got the Holy Ghost
[1:46:11] she came up for prayer didn't seem like
[1:46:14] she got it we close service I went in
[1:46:16] there is it okay that I tell us I hope
[1:46:17] so cause I already started it's gonna be
[1:46:19] hard to finish it unless you give me
[1:46:20] permission well my daughter Lydia comes
[1:46:24] in there said daddy I want to pray for
[1:46:25] the Holy Ghost I said oh glory well
[1:46:27] something happened when we joined hand
[1:46:29] all four of us join hands one two three
[1:46:32] and Lydia for as that happened you we
[1:46:34] felt it something came in the room and
[1:46:37] our sister started crying shouting and
[1:46:39] praising God and you do something happen
[1:46:42] there amen
[1:46:43] now her life is going to vindicate it
[1:46:45] now just like my life had just like your
[1:46:48] life has been vindicated as well but
[1:46:50] brother said when you get the Holy Ghost
[1:46:52] something has to happen to you amen you
[1:46:56] don't get the Holy Ghost being dead and
[1:46:58] driving stiff and starchy you've got to
[1:47:00] come in and if you get the Holy Spirit
[1:47:02] sinners were weak delayed at Calvary
[1:47:04] outside this sanctified ones will weep
[1:47:06] their way to the baptism of the Holy
[1:47:08] Ghost hey man so you just never know
[1:47:12] which morning it's gonna be so you got
[1:47:14] to be prepared prepared every season you
[1:47:17] got to come prepared anointed every time
[1:47:19] because you don't know whether it's in
[1:47:21] season right I didn't know she was
[1:47:22] seeking the Holy Ghost that way I didn't
[1:47:24] know when a man was seeking the Simon
[1:47:25] and I know when a man was seeking the
[1:47:26] Holy Ghost that week glory but the
[1:47:30] children of God are ready in season and
[1:47:33] out of season no matter what season is
[1:47:35] I'm always in season by the baptism of
[1:47:38] the Holy Ghost
[1:47:39] bori and that's what happened we laid
[1:47:43] our palms down here and the King rode
[1:47:45] into the church thank the Lord that he
[1:47:47] wrote in I said Hosea and save our
[1:47:50] sisters fill them with the Holy Ghost
[1:47:51] Hosea blessed is he that comes in the
[1:47:55] name of the Lord amen hallelujah I'm
[1:48:01] glad to brother
[1:48:02] and I think it was your prayer or our
[1:48:03] faith altogether I think it was
[1:48:04] combining your faith with her faith
[1:48:06] everyone's faith I think it was putting
[1:48:08] all of our faith together that did that
[1:48:09] don't you
[1:48:10] I was think about that yesterday it took
[1:48:12] it when she and I prayed our just faith
[1:48:13] was enough we needed more faith we need
[1:48:15] more power
[1:48:16] hey Laurie amen see it just took more
[1:48:20] than my anointing more than her night it
[1:48:22] took more 90 we all got to believe we
[1:48:25] all need an anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:48:29] Laurie let me try to find a place to
[1:48:34] close here now for most of your requests
[1:48:46] you need a revelation before you can
[1:48:49] when you brood war you can accept it
[1:48:52] right but man tells us and works his
[1:48:54] faith Express you say he said you can
[1:48:56] quote the word all the time for healing
[1:48:58] but you've got a but God has to reveal
[1:49:00] it to you that it's over so if
[1:49:03] everything were so with many many things
[1:49:06] and blessings from God you need a
[1:49:08] revelation first that it's for you
[1:49:09] because Paul said three times give him
[1:49:12] give me my eyesight you memorize like
[1:49:13] God said no so divine healing you need
[1:49:17] to see God to know if it's God's will to
[1:49:19] heal you but let me tell you it is God's
[1:49:22] will to save you and fill you with the
[1:49:25] Holy Ghost do not let the devil tell you
[1:49:28] where I can never get saved children the
[1:49:30] only thing I will tell you that it is
[1:49:32] God's will to save you the Bible said
[1:49:35] God would that all men be saved how do
[1:49:40] new you you know the wonder does God
[1:49:42] want to save me or my serpent seed don't
[1:49:45] have you with the devil don't listen to
[1:49:46] him it is God's will to save you the
[1:49:48] Bible says so it's not saith the Lord
[1:49:51] and it's just up to you whether you
[1:49:53] receive it or not you say well I'm
[1:49:56] saying but I just feel like I'm the
[1:49:58] foolish version
[1:49:59] well guess what it's God's will to make
[1:50:02] you the bride as well oh you don't
[1:50:05] believe that do you okay okay well let's
[1:50:07] go to the Bible there
[1:50:10] nation 2200 you don't believe that oh
[1:50:13] you should it's God's will to give you
[1:50:17] the Holy Ghost well I'm just ordained to
[1:50:19] be a foolish virgin my whole life
[1:50:21] nonsense nonsense God just don't want to
[1:50:25] give it to me
[1:50:26] God wants to give it to you more than
[1:50:28] you wanted amen hallelujah it's God's
[1:50:33] will if that's not the case then Judas
[1:50:37] will be able to say God you wouldn't
[1:50:38] saved me I wanted to be saved I wanted
[1:50:41] to be filled with the Holy Ghost but you
[1:50:42] wouldn't give it to me and God would be
[1:50:43] guilty of his breaking of his own loss
[1:50:46] no God wanted Judas to be saved God
[1:50:49] wanted Judas be filled the Holy Ghost
[1:50:51] but he chose to be the son of perdition
[1:50:53] is that right we know the scripture
[1:50:58] where it says in 1st Timothy that all
[1:50:59] God would that all men be saved well
[1:51:01] guess what revelation 22 has the same
[1:51:03] idea for the baptism of Holy Ghost God
[1:51:06] desires everyone to have the baptism the
[1:51:09] Holy Ghost but only the elect will
[1:51:11] receive it that's right look at verse 6
[1:51:21] 22:16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to
[1:51:24] testify unto you these things in these
[1:51:25] churches I am the root and offspring of
[1:51:27] David and the bright morning star and
[1:51:28] the spirit and the bride say is it the
[1:51:34] brides will or whose will is it it's the
[1:51:37] Holy Spirit's will and the bride's will
[1:51:40] let all the bride members come to this
[1:51:42] fountain of living waters amen and him
[1:51:46] that here they let him that here say
[1:51:48] come and let him there's a thirst they
[1:51:49] come and whosoever will let him take of
[1:51:53] the water of life freely amen God is
[1:51:58] inviting everybody to be a wise virgin
[1:52:00] but only the left only those that God
[1:52:03] predestinated will actually receive it
[1:52:06] so if you're not saved you have a right
[1:52:09] to say it is God's will I don't need a
[1:52:11] revelation to know that God wants to
[1:52:13] save me he already said he wanted to
[1:52:15] save you is that right Church God would
[1:52:19] that oh man well I'm one of those I'm
[1:52:21] all of mankind I'm all God would that I
[1:52:24] be saved
[1:52:24] oh well God doesn't want me to drink of
[1:52:28] the waters of life really the Bible just
[1:52:30] said let whosoever come to the waters of
[1:52:33] life freely are you with me Church let's
[1:52:36] stand to our feet I better stop right
[1:52:38] here you don't need a revelation as far
[1:52:45] as what does God want to fill me with
[1:52:46] the Holy Ghost
[1:52:47] he's already invited you to partake of
[1:52:51] Living Waters
[1:52:53] he's already invited you to the New
[1:52:56] Jerusalem he has to give that invitation
[1:52:59] to everyone is that right if not they
[1:53:04] can say whoa you didn't invite me no the
[1:53:07] spirit and the bride say come come come
[1:53:13] drink of this waters of life it's for
[1:53:15] everybody but because of
[1:53:19] it's for knowledge he can predestiny all
[1:53:22] the events where all the children of God
[1:53:23] will fully come he's going to make sure
[1:53:26] actually he made sure you heard the
[1:53:28] message of the hour
[1:53:29] oz raised in Pentecostal Trinitarian
[1:53:32] unholiness church but God made sure that
[1:53:34] I heard the message to the caller amen
[1:53:36] is he new I wanna come I don't want to
[1:53:39] drink of live not deaf
[1:53:41] I want to partake of eternal life amen I
[1:53:45] want to be a carrier of the word see
[1:53:51] some truce of God are for everyone it's
[1:53:54] God's will that you be saved it's God's
[1:53:57] will that everyone who wants to come can
[1:54:00] come to the baptism Holy Ghost does
[1:54:04] everybody understand so we can't let's
[1:54:07] say and say well it's not for you you
[1:54:09] see God didn't Phil you know God's
[1:54:10] waiting for you to die out that's what
[1:54:12] we're taught acts 5:32 says God gives
[1:54:15] the Holy Ghost to them that disobey Him
[1:54:17] no to those that obey Him
[1:54:20] the trouble is people disobey God they
[1:54:24] say they want to be born again with them
[1:54:25] they disobey the Word of God sorry
[1:54:28] doesn't work that way you can't serve
[1:54:30] two masters you got to serve one or the
[1:54:32] other you want Delilah or you are
[1:54:35] Jehovah where's your new hood we want
[1:54:39] Jesus Christ that's how the musicians
[1:54:43] come I preach about an hour and a half

[1:54:48] brought the anointing let's see you've
[1:54:50] got to do anything here this morning

[1:54:53] you believe that you've already fed on
[1:54:56] the super supernatural spiritual things
[1:54:58] of God let's see if God wants to move
[1:55:00] let me remind the church that sisters
[1:55:03] even sisters even brothers and our
[1:55:05] preachers if you feel led to pray
[1:55:07] somebody follow the leadership of the
[1:55:09] Holy Spirit if you feel led to pray for
[1:55:11] somebody or you got a word for somebody
[1:55:13] you feel free to give it I don't want to
[1:55:17] be a ruining rabbi that ruins the
[1:55:20] service and say well God can't use you
[1:55:22] no God can't use you he can only use me
[1:55:24] that's a nickel a demonic spirit God can
[1:55:29] use a nine-year-old
[1:55:31] or your God can use a 14-year old fat
[1:55:37] got always often chooses the humble who
[1:55:41] are rich in faith man once looked at man
