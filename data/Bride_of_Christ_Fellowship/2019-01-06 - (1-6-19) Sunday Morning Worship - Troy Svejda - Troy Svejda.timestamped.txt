[35:28] the book of second kings chapter four I
[35:32] want to speak a message called making
[35:35] room for the word Amen making room for
[35:39] the word I thought that song was perfect
[35:43] for the message this morning amen second
[35:47] Kings chapter 4 we'll start with the
[35:49] eighth verse and we'll go all the way on
[35:53] down to the 17th 17th verse sir amen and
[36:00] it says and it fell on a day that Elijah
[36:07] passed to shoot him where was a great
[36:12] woman and she constrained him to eat
[36:15] bread and so it was that as oft as he
[36:19] passed by he turned thither tea bread
[36:23] and she said unto her husband behold now
[36:27] I perceive that this is
[36:29] holy man of God which passeth by us
[36:33] continually let us make a little chamber
[36:37] I pray thee on the wall and let us set
[36:40] for him there a bed and a table and a
[36:43] stool and a candlestick and it shall be
[36:46] that when he cometh to us that he shall
[36:49] turn in thither and it fell on a day
[36:52] that he came thither and as he turned
[36:54] into the chamber and he laid there and
[36:57] he said to get haze' his servant call
[37:01] this shunammite woman and when he had
[37:03] called her she stood before him and he
[37:06] said unto him talking to a haze of there
[37:08] and he said unto him say now unto her
[37:11] behold thou has been careful for us with
[37:15] all of this care what is to be done for
[37:18] thee would sow be spoken for to the king
[37:22] or to the captain of the host as she
[37:25] answered I dwell among my Norman people
[37:28] she was content amen amen and and he
[37:32] said what then is to be done for her and
[37:35] go hazy answered and said verily she
[37:38] hath no child and her husband is old and
[37:42] he said call her and when he had called
[37:46] her she stood in the door and he said
[37:49] about this season according to the time
[37:51] of life thou shalt embrace a son and she
[37:55] said nay my lord staff in thy hand and
[37:58] go thy way if it's Nate or she said nay
[38:01] my lord thou man of God do not lie unto
[38:04] thy handmaid and the woman conceived and
[38:06] bare a son at that season that Elijah
[38:09] has said unto her according to the time
[38:12] of life just about a year later she bore
[38:14] a child just like the Prophet had set a
[38:16] man let's just bow our heads in a word
[38:19] of Prayer Heavenly Father thy word is
[38:22] great and mighty and true Lord Lord we
[38:24] just thank you for how how rich it is
[38:26] every little every little bit of it Lord
[38:29] we love Lord and we just love your word
[38:31] father so Lord we just pray father as
[38:33] you have come into this room father
[38:35] we've opened up our hearts unto you
[38:37] father that the Lord let not that I
[38:39] would come and preach your word Lord but
[38:41] that you would come and
[38:42] preach your word through me father and
[38:44] surely we know that we will be blessed
[38:46] Lord by everything that you say to us
[38:48] Lord so we just pray Lord that you'd
[38:50] have the preeminence here this morning
[38:52] take the highest place Lord if there be
[38:55] anything you desire Lord we just want to
[38:57] make room for you in our hearts in the
[38:58] name of Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen
[39:02] hey man god bless you you can be seated
[39:05] Amen you know if you're if you remember
[39:08] I know it's been preached here several
[39:09] times about how the Bible says over in
[39:12] Amos 3:7 that sure surely the Lord will
[39:18] do nothing but he revealeth his secret
[39:22] unto his servants the prophets amen
[39:24] and so the servant his servant Elijah
[39:27] here was a prophet of the Most High God
[39:29] a mana you know prophets are about their
[39:33] father's business amen there our prophet
[39:36] is going you know he a prophet never
[39:38] really knows exactly what he's gonna be
[39:40] doing from day to day but he just goes
[39:43] as the spirit leads him that's how
[39:45] prophets are special built men of God
[39:48] that can hear especially from God and
[39:51] they go and they're always about their
[39:53] father's business and they go and they
[39:56] do whatever their father tells them to
[39:57] do amen so the prophet Elijah here as he
[40:01] was traveling from where he lived
[40:03] continually going about his father's
[40:06] business it always happened that as he
[40:08] was walking down the path that he just
[40:10] happened to walk by this shoot and I
[40:13] might woman's house Amen as she watched
[40:16] him go by constantly back and forth back
[40:19] and forth as she began to realize that
[40:21] this is a man of God amen this is a man
[40:26] of God as she told to her husband and
[40:28] she read to first you know first they
[40:31] say well let's just give make sure he
[40:33] has food upon the journey you know and
[40:35] so they stopped him you know if you if
[40:37] you want anything sire thing we'll give
[40:39] you bread here we gave you a little bit
[40:41] of water and and
[40:42] and then that you can be about on your
[40:44] way amen but after so much time began to
[40:48] pass and they really began to cherish
[40:50] this man of God and began to love this
[40:52] man of God that's the woman said to her
[40:55] husband you know let's just make a
[40:57] little room so that as he's going about
[41:00] his father's business whatever is that
[41:02] the Lord is leading him to do that if he
[41:04] be tired at all or weary at all that
[41:07] he'd have a room here right on her house
[41:09] he could just stop right in here and
[41:11] rest for a while amen
[41:14] and so they they built this little room
[41:18] amen and and what amazes me is okay so
[41:21] they made room for the Prophet amen they
[41:24] built a little place they added on they
[41:26] tore down the wall and they and they and
[41:28] they added on their you know off to the
[41:30] side there of their house and and as
[41:32] they added on there they made it up they
[41:34] fixed up the place just right you know
[41:37] and they put in a little bed in there
[41:38] made it nice and comfortable and we
[41:40] stuffed it with something nice and soft
[41:42] you know and then they put a little
[41:44] stool in there and a table so we could
[41:46] sit there and a little lamp and meditate
[41:48] on the Word of God maybe if you had in
[41:50] the writings of David or the songs or
[41:53] whatever he might have had maybe even
[41:54] something for Moses I don't know if he
[41:56] carried you that with him but but if he
[41:58] did he could have a little lamp sanika
[42:00] laid out on the table there meditate and
[42:02] speak to us his Lord and Savior yell
[42:05] amen and and just a place where the word
[42:08] could be comfortable amen because the
[42:11] word comes to the prophets and now the
[42:13] Prophet had come to their house and they
[42:15] made a place inside their house to where
[42:18] the the prophet of the Most High God
[42:20] could be comfortable could be at home a
[42:23] man could have rest amen what a blessing
[42:26] amen what a blessing the owners Elijah
[42:29] so sure enough it came it fell upon a
[42:32] day that Elijah was walking down the
[42:35] path and and they stopped him they said
[42:38] look we've made this room here just for
[42:41] you a man has been sanctified just for
[42:44] you to to lay here to rest here to have
[42:48] a little bit of rest upon your journey
[42:49] and and so it was that he was a little
[42:52] weary so he he just went right on into
[42:54] the room there
[42:55] and he laid down the Bible says amen and
[42:59] I just think about as the Prophet is
[43:01] laying there he's comfortable he's been
[43:05] fed he's been welcomed amen
[43:08] everything's been set up just right for
[43:10] him and as he is laying there something
[43:14] comes on his mind that maybe this woman
[43:17] has an eat a mint and he wants to be a
[43:22] blessing to this woman that has been so
[43:24] kind to him amen so as he so as he is
[43:28] thinking as he as he as he's laying
[43:32] there and that was in verse 11 of second
[43:35] Kings 4 he says and it fell on a day
[43:37] they came thither and he turned into the
[43:39] chamber and he laid there now as he laid
[43:43] there that thought came upon his mind
[43:45] this woman I haven't eat now I don't
[43:48] believe that thought just came from his
[43:49] own natural beat that thought came from
[43:53] the Most High God himself amen
[43:56] the word came to the Prophet amen and as
[43:59] the word was beginning to have mercy on
[44:02] the Shunammite woman amen what does this
[44:04] woman have she might have an eat what
[44:06] let's let's find out whatever she needs
[44:09] and also the prophets beginning to
[44:10] realize that whatever this woman had
[44:13] need of God was willing to fulfill that
[44:16] need all he had to do was find out what
[44:20] the need was and he knew that his God
[44:22] would fulfill that need that's a
[44:25] powerful thing that woman is in a good
[44:28] place you know when she built that
[44:29] little room I don't think she
[44:31] necessarily knew that all of her needs
[44:33] we met just by building that room she
[44:36] wasn't expecting that type of a payoff
[44:38] for building that room but nevertheless
[44:39] even though she wasn't expecting that
[44:41] payoff that was the payoff that she
[44:44] received amen amen amen pays to make
[44:48] room for the word of God amen so as he's
[44:53] laying there he speaks to a sermon get
[44:55] haze' and tells the sermon get haze' go
[44:57] and call the woman and when the woman
[45:00] and when the woman comes to the door of
[45:02] the room that she had built for him and
[45:04] he's coming there and he starts find out
[45:07] what is to be done free what can I
[45:09] do for you can I can I speak to the king
[45:11] for you can I can I do this or can I do
[45:13] that or or what can we do to make you
[45:16] better
[45:16] and the lady says well I'm content
[45:21] I have everything I have need up just
[45:24] happy to hear to dwell amongst my own
[45:26] people and get hazel and Gaye haze'
[45:29] turns to us to his master the Prophet
[45:33] and says but she has no son amen her
[45:38] husband is growing old they're growing
[45:40] old and she desires a child in her
[45:43] innermost heart and and and and she just
[45:47] wants a child
[45:48] so k Hazen knew what her need was and so
[45:51] he spoke that to the prophet and the
[45:53] Prophet immediately turns to the woman
[45:55] and he says about a year from now in
[45:57] this season you shall bear a son Amen
[46:01] right according to the time of life what
[46:04] a blessing
[46:05] amen and sure enough a year after that
[46:08] when it came on that she bore the son
[46:11] all this because she made room for the
[46:14] Word of God
[46:15] she made room for the prophet of the
[46:18] Most High God Amen that carrier of the
[46:20] word amen they made him comfortable and
[46:23] think about as he was laying there they
[46:27] first say made room for the word the
[46:29] word entered into the chamber and it
[46:31] laid there not before the word the
[46:34] Prophet was the word would have come by
[46:36] he'd eat and then he'd keep on going
[46:38] amen amen but now the Prophet with the
[46:43] word of God has come and doesn't just
[46:45] keep going but he enters into the
[46:47] chamber and stays
[46:49] what a blessing the word has now come to
[46:52] stay has come to live come to dwell come
[46:55] to be there amen and now we're seeing
[46:57] the fruits of the indwelling word of in
[47:01] the lie in the in the chamber that they
[47:04] had built for him the fruits of the word
[47:07] in the chamber what a blessing
[47:10] amen a throne of John chapter one
[47:17] a familiar story but John chapter 1
[47:28] verse 29 speaking about a John the
[47:32] Baptist here I know John the Baptist was
[47:35] a special man he had a special job he
[47:40] had been called to identify God's gift
[47:45] to the earth amen
[47:47] God was sending his gift to the earth
[47:51] which was God's own spirit dwelling in a
[47:56] body of flesh upon the earth and John
[47:59] the Baptist was sent to identify that
[48:03] body of flesh to identify that spirit
[48:06] amen and to make known unto all men that
[48:09] the spirit was coming back to the earth
[48:11] again in a body of flesh the Most High
[48:14] God was coming his son and the body of
[48:17] flesh and to identify him and to prepare
[48:19] a way so that people might recognize him
[48:21] when he came amen so John chapter 1
[48:25] verse 29 it says the next day John seeth
[48:29] Jesus coming unto Him and saith behold
[48:33] the lamb of God which taketh away the
[48:36] sin of the world look John's identifying
[48:38] him amen
[48:39] this is he of whom I said after me come
[48:43] with a man which is preferred before me
[48:45] for he was before me now look John is
[48:48] now identifying this is the same one
[48:49] I've been preaching about this is the
[48:51] same one I've been talking about all
[48:52] this time look I've talked about him
[48:55] I've preached about him I spoken about
[48:56] him but look now he's here amen now he's
[49:00] here verse 31 and I knew him not but
[49:04] that he should be made manifest to
[49:06] Israel therefore am i come to baptizing
[49:09] with water so at one there was a point
[49:11] in time where John Baptist said no Meah
[49:13] didn't know who he was but he was just
[49:15] baptizing with water making and
[49:18] preparing a way for him to come and then
[49:21] verse 32 says and John bare record
[49:23] saying I saw the Spirit descending from
[49:27] heaven like a dove and it abode upon him
[49:31] verse 33 and I knew him not but he now
[49:35] watch this he's gonna say here he that
[49:37] sent me to baptize with water okay the
[49:39] same one that sent John way back the
[49:42] same one that's talked to John that
[49:44] spoke to John and said go and baptize us
[49:47] water go and prepare the way that same
[49:49] one look way looking with that same what
[49:51] voice is gonna say now verse 33 us read
[49:53] that again and I knew him not but he
[49:56] that sent me to baptize with water the
[49:58] same said unto me upon whom now shall
[50:01] see the spirit descending and remaining
[50:04] on him the same is he which baptizeth
[50:08] with the Holy Ghost and I saw and bear
[50:12] record that this is the son of God amen
[50:15] so John the Baptist had received a word
[50:18] where there is an audible voice I don't
[50:20] know or just in his my I don't know how
[50:22] was but son of God have been talking to
[50:25] his prophet John the Baptist and spoke
[50:27] to him and said that the Holy Ghost is
[50:29] gonna come to the earth amen I've sinned
[50:32] I've sit I've sinned a man and when you
[50:34] in this is how you're gonna identify him
[50:37] is that the Holy Ghost is gonna descend
[50:40] down from God out of heaven like a dove
[50:42] amen
[50:43] and and you that you're gonna identify
[50:45] him because you'll see the spirit
[50:46] descending upon him and it's the one
[50:48] that the spirit comes on and remains
[50:50] there that will be the sign unto you
[50:54] that this is the son of God the Lamb of
[50:57] God that has come to take away the sins
[50:59] of the world that was the sign that when
[51:02] the Holy Ghost not just the Holy Ghost
[51:04] came and then kept on going but that the
[51:06] Holy Ghost was gonna come and stay on
[51:08] someone was gonna stay and remain and so
[51:12] John the Baptist he's walking along
[51:14] there and all sudden he sees Jesus
[51:16] Christ for the first time there a men
[51:18] and as he sees Jesus Christ all son he
[51:20] sees the Spirit coming down from God out
[51:23] of heaven he's watching us he's like oh
[51:25] my that's just what the voice told me to
[51:30] watch for let me see let me see if is he
[51:32] is the Holy Spirit gonna stay he's
[51:33] watching that dove come down and and
[51:36] it's lands upon the Lord Jesus and he
[51:38] and all sudden goes right into him and
[51:39] he remains there I was like I know
[51:42] that's him that's him
[51:44] the Lamb of God that it was gonna take
[51:47] away all the sins of the world that's
[51:48] the son of the Most High God that's the
[51:51] one that the Holy Spirit is gonna do
[51:52] well in amen now remember now what's the
[51:55] history of this this mysterious Holy
[51:57] Spirit of God I think about you know a
[52:00] lot of people think that the Holy Spirit
[52:02] is this mysterious you know mystery that
[52:04] we don't know anything about or you know
[52:06] uh you know if like like if the folks
[52:10] that believe the Trinity doctrine you're
[52:12] they they take God they split them up
[52:13] into three pieces you know and they and
[52:15] they take here's Jesus that loves you
[52:18] and here's the father they're not sure
[52:19] you know because judgment comes you know
[52:22] from there and then there's the Holy
[52:23] Spirit and they're just not quite sure
[52:25] you know do you pray unto the Father you
[52:27] know but the Holy Spirit is not quite so
[52:29] mysterious as some might think amen
[52:32] because God is a spirit amen and he is
[52:35] holy amen and remember that Jesus was
[52:39] born of the Holy Ghost of the Holy
[52:41] Spirit now but if you go back to the
[52:43] book of Genesis the Bible says now the
[52:46] earth was theirs one of the first times
[52:48] we hear about the Holy Spirit of God it
[52:51] says the earth was without form
[52:54] it was void yes it was dark there was no
[52:59] land just darkness and water covering
[53:01] the whole earth and the Holy Spirit
[53:03] comes he starts brooding over the face
[53:06] of the waters there is nowhere for him
[53:09] to land right there's nowhere for him to
[53:12] go there's no one for him to dwell in a
[53:15] meant there's nothing he can do there
[53:17] the earth is just useless its form
[53:20] there's no life in it there's nothing as
[53:22] the Holy Spirit is brooding over the
[53:24] earth there in the book of Genesis what
[53:27] begins to happen God the Spirit begins
[53:31] to speaking he says let there be
[53:34] let there be let there be let there be
[53:37] and things start you know landmasses
[53:40] start coming up out of the water and and
[53:42] trees and plants and and I was
[53:44] everything and all sudden and he takes a
[53:46] little garden and he creates it over and
[53:48] eat and you know and all sudden the
[53:50] world is a beautiful place now I was now
[53:54] when the Holy Spirit first came it
[53:56] wasn't like that he first came
[53:58] it wasn't producing anything nothing was
[54:00] alive Amen but God made himself a room
[54:04] on the earth a place to dwell the holy
[54:07] spirit came to the Earth's first it was
[54:09] dark as formless as void and there was
[54:11] no place for him to land so he had to
[54:13] create a place he created a garden
[54:16] called Eden where he can and people that
[54:19] he could commune with they meant and God
[54:21] the spirit God came and communed with
[54:23] his people they meant amen why so now
[54:26] there was room for the people so that's
[54:28] the history of the Holy Ghost amen
[54:32] and now now now think about it because
[54:35] when we read here in John chapter 1
[54:37] there the the same thing that happened
[54:40] to the earth back in the beginning where
[54:42] the earth had become void and formless
[54:44] now the religion of the Jews had done
[54:49] the same thing they become dark without
[54:53] form without void there was no spirit in
[54:55] their religion
[54:56] amen amen there was no room for the Holy
[54:59] Spirit boys spirit could come and brood
[55:01] over the the religion of the Jews but
[55:04] there was no room for the Holy Ghost
[55:05] there there was no room for the spirit
[55:07] there they turned the religion of
[55:09] Jehovah into a dry dead religion and it
[55:13] just forms and and traditions and and
[55:15] all those things and there was no room
[55:18] for the Holy Spirit amen
[55:19] but there had to be a reappearance of
[55:22] the Holy Ghost on the earth amen and
[55:25] there had to be a place for that Holy
[55:26] Spirit to land a man so God God no
[55:32] actually let's let's take let's let's
[55:34] now listen God what'd he do he
[55:37] identified a woman by the name of Mary
[55:40] amen now what why why what was so
[55:45] special about this is there was one
[55:47] place that he could come and he knew a
[55:50] woman that would say be it unto me
[55:53] according to thy word let's turn over to
[55:58] Luke chapter one
[56:06] making room for the Word of God Luke
[56:11] chapter 1 will read from the 26th verse
[56:18] it says and in the sixth month the angel
[56:23] angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a
[56:27] city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[56:30] virgin espoused to a man whose name was
[56:33] Joseph of the house of David and the
[56:36] Virgin's name was Mary and the angel
[56:39] came in unto her and said hail thou were
[56:43] highly favored the Lord is with thee
[56:45] blessed art thou among women and when
[56:49] she saw him she was troubled at his
[56:51] saying and cast into her mind what
[56:54] manner of salutation this should be and
[56:56] the angel said unto her fear not Mary
[56:59] for thou hast found favor with God
[57:02] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[57:05] womb and bring forth a son and shalt
[57:08] call his name Jesus and he shall be
[57:11] great and shall be called the son of the
[57:13] highest and the Lord God shall give unto
[57:16] him the throne of his father David and
[57:18] he shall reign over the house of Jacob
[57:21] forever and of his kingdom there shall
[57:23] be no end amen now if there's no end of
[57:26] his kingdom that means his kingdom still
[57:27] has to be here somewhere amen amen
[57:30] now verse 34 and then then said Mary
[57:32] unto the angel how shall this be seen I
[57:35] know not a man and angels answer to send
[57:37] or the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee
[57:40] and the power of the highest shall
[57:42] overshadow thee therefore shall that
[57:45] holy thing which shall be born of thee
[57:48] shall be called the Son of God so now
[57:52] the Holy Spirit the same Holy Spirit
[57:54] that brooded over the earth in the
[57:55] beginning is now coming and is brooding
[57:58] over Mary amen and what's he gonna do
[58:02] he's gonna create in there a body and so
[58:05] what did Mary have to do first she had
[58:08] to take the audible words of the angel
[58:11] they entered into her ear
[58:15] they went across the field of her mind
[58:18] and as she thought about the word of the
[58:22] angel and thought about it she said
[58:24] that's just right that's just the truth
[58:28] that's just according to the Word of God
[58:30] and she accepted it and she said Lord
[58:33] let it be unto me just like what your
[58:35] word said and right that moment the Word
[58:38] of God fell from her mind down into her
[58:41] heart and fell down into her womb and
[58:43] began to create the body of the Lord
[58:46] Jesus Christ why because a woman made
[58:49] room for the Word of God amen she made
[58:55] room for the Word of God and then the
[58:57] word became manifest in her womb amen as
[59:00] she brought forth a son and named him
[59:04] Jesus and that son was the son of God
[59:08] amen born of the Holy Ghost the Bible
[59:11] says amen now why did the angel leave
[59:19] when he did in verse 38 there it says
[59:24] and Mary said Behold the handmaid of the
[59:27] Lord be it unto me according to thy word
[59:31] and the angel departed from her at that
[59:35] moment the angel left because he knew
[59:37] his work was done as soon as the word
[59:40] was received his work was done amen it
[59:44] was one thing to speak the word the
[59:47] angel spoke the word but then when he
[59:49] watched Mary responded and he knew that
[59:53] she had received the word and as soon as
[59:55] she received the word he knew that's it
[59:57] there we go the words has been received
[1:00:00] the work is done and the angel left
[1:00:02] there was nothing more for him to do his
[1:00:04] goal was to come and bring the word and
[1:00:07] to make sure that the word was received
[1:00:09] the word was received so he left amen
[1:00:12] and now we know what the fruit of that
[1:00:15] word was amen amen amen
[1:00:19] alleluia alleluia
[1:00:25] now let's turn again over to Matthew
[1:00:30] chapter 23 now remember Jesus said I
[1:00:35] come that you might have life and have
[1:00:37] it more abundantly a mint and God has
[1:00:41] life to give amen
[1:00:44] so Matthew chapter 23 let's go further
[1:00:47] into the life of this Lord Jesus the
[1:00:50] Holy Spirit still dwelling in him still
[1:00:53] living it in the same Holy Spirit
[1:00:54] descend upon him like a dove a Holy
[1:00:57] Spirit that that couldn't find a place
[1:00:59] to rest and the religion of the Jews now
[1:01:02] has found a place to rest in the body of
[1:01:04] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:01:07] Matthew chapter 23 oops I turned to the
[1:01:11] wrong book yeah Matthew chapter 23 will
[1:01:19] read the thirty seventh to the 39th
[1:01:23] verse sir Oh
[1:01:34] Denson I'm sorry let's turn
[1:01:41] to mark 11 I meant to go to mark 11 I
[1:01:46] wrote it down long I apologize there we
[1:01:54] go mark 11 will read the first verse
[1:01:55] there then will quote down to the
[1:01:57] seventh verse mark 11:1 says now when
[1:02:07] they came nigh to Jerusalem unto
[1:02:10] Bethpage and Bethany at the Mount of
[1:02:13] Olives he sent forth two of his
[1:02:16] disciples now if you remember this story
[1:02:18] Jesus is coming back into Jerusalem he
[1:02:22] sends his disciples ahead of him and
[1:02:24] tells him there will be a little donkey
[1:02:26] that they are tied up over here you go
[1:02:29] up and grab that donkey Amen if anybody
[1:02:32] asks you why are you taking him remember
[1:02:35] the Lord Jesus said you just tell them
[1:02:37] that the Lord has need of him and bring
[1:02:40] that donkey to me Amen so the disciples
[1:02:43] go and they go into Jerusalem and they
[1:02:45] do exactly what the Lord Jesus asks them
[1:02:47] to do now let's go down to verse 5 amen
[1:02:51] or verse 7 and they brought the colt
[1:02:55] that's a donkey and they brought the
[1:02:57] Colt to Jesus they cast their garments
[1:03:00] on him and he said on him and many
[1:03:03] spread their garments in the way and
[1:03:05] others cut down branches off the trees
[1:03:07] and threw them in the way what's what's
[1:03:10] happening here Jesus is entering into
[1:03:12] Jerusalem amen
[1:03:14] the Holy Spirit is returning to
[1:03:17] Jerusalem amen now remember the temple
[1:03:23] when the Temple of Solomon was dedicated
[1:03:26] the Holy Spirit came down upon the
[1:03:30] temple remember amen now we're in that
[1:03:33] same geographical location and here's
[1:03:36] Jesus with the Holy Ghost residing
[1:03:39] inside of him amen entering back into
[1:03:42] Jerusalem amen
[1:03:43] and many verse a and many spread their
[1:03:46] garments in the way and others cut down
[1:03:48] branches off the trees and strew them in
[1:03:51] the way and they that went before and
[1:03:53] they that follow cry
[1:03:55] saying Hosanna Hosanna blessed is he
[1:03:58] that cometh in the name of the Lord
[1:03:59] blessed be the kingdom of our Father
[1:04:01] David and that cometh in the name of the
[1:04:04] Lord hosanna in the highest
[1:04:06] and Jesus entered into Jerusalem and
[1:04:10] into the temple and when he had looked
[1:04:13] around about upon all things and now the
[1:04:16] evening tide was come and he went out
[1:04:18] unto Bethany with with the twelve now
[1:04:22] look what just happened here Jesus the
[1:04:24] word it's coming back to Jerusalem he
[1:04:27] enters into Jerusalem he enters into the
[1:04:30] very heart of Jerusalem which is the
[1:04:31] temple he looks around at all things the
[1:04:35] Bible says there verse 11 and when he
[1:04:38] had looked around about upon all things
[1:04:41] the evening tyke came and he left he
[1:04:44] went back out to Jerusalem the word came
[1:04:46] went into the temple he looked around
[1:04:48] and he left the word did not stay and
[1:04:51] went back out now back now now it would
[1:04:57] have been a blessing unto the people of
[1:04:58] the temple if the world will come state
[1:05:01] but instead the word went into the
[1:05:04] temple he looked around and he left now
[1:05:06] I remember just two chapters from here
[1:05:10] the disciples and Jesus are walking
[1:05:13] through the temple and they're leaving
[1:05:14] the temple and the disciples were whole
[1:05:16] look at this great building and how
[1:05:18] wonderful this temple is and how
[1:05:20] beautiful has been made and and he and
[1:05:22] Jesus looks at me he says I tell you the
[1:05:24] truth not one stone will be left upon
[1:05:28] another what was he doing is pronounced
[1:05:31] it come he looked at the temple he
[1:05:33] looked at their worship he looked at no
[1:05:35] matter how much they worshipped him they
[1:05:37] waved that palm branches they sung
[1:05:40] Hosanna Hosanna to the highest Amen he
[1:05:43] goes in the temple he looks around and
[1:05:45] he prays his judgment upon that temple
[1:05:47] saying not one stone will be left upon
[1:05:49] another the word came and now the word
[1:05:53] is leaving pronouncing judgment after
[1:05:55] looking around amen amen
[1:05:59] now let's now let's go down now to John
[1:06:03] chapter 20 now remember the Lord does
[1:06:07] the same thing when he comes to us
[1:06:09] he comes we invite him into our heart we
[1:06:12] worship we sing Hosanna Hosanna unto the
[1:06:14] highest we worship Him we praise Him
[1:06:17] they comes into our heart and he looks
[1:06:19] around at all things and to find out if
[1:06:22] we've made room for the word of God or
[1:06:24] not amen John chapter 20 verse 19 it
[1:06:42] says then the same day evening being the
[1:06:56] first day of the week when the doors
[1:06:59] were shut where the disciples were
[1:07:00] assembled for fear of the Jews came
[1:07:03] Jesus and stood in the midst and said
[1:07:06] unto them peace be unto you and when
[1:07:11] they when he had so said he showed them
[1:07:13] his hands and his side and then were the
[1:07:16] disciples glad when they saw the Lord
[1:07:19] now think about it his disciples you
[1:07:22] know Jesus had already been crucified he
[1:07:25] had already died amen and now the
[1:07:29] disciples they've been sad they had
[1:07:31] followed this Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:07:34] three and a half years they knew that he
[1:07:36] was the son of God they knew that the
[1:07:38] Holy Spirit was dwelling on the inside
[1:07:40] of that man they knew that he was the
[1:07:43] son of God the same one that created the
[1:07:45] heavens and the earth he could do
[1:07:47] anything he could speak to this he could
[1:07:49] speak to the trees he could speak to the
[1:07:51] waters he could speak to the wind he
[1:07:54] could speak to the fish they had seen
[1:07:56] him do so many miracles they seemed
[1:07:57] raise the dead they knew that this man
[1:08:00] was the Almighty God in flesh they had
[1:08:04] no doubt about it in their mind they
[1:08:06] knew that this man was the Holy Spirit
[1:08:09] himself in bodily form what a blessing
[1:08:14] to realize that what a position those
[1:08:17] disciples had how would you have liked
[1:08:19] to have been there
[1:08:22] and to have listened to him preached to
[1:08:25] listen to Jesus preach to watch him heal
[1:08:27] the sick wouldn't even love to have been
[1:08:29] there wouldn't you have loved to have
[1:08:31] watched him in action watched him there
[1:08:33] on you know a Mount of Olives or
[1:08:35] preaching the sermon on the mount you
[1:08:36] know and and all those things and and
[1:08:38] just to see him in action to see the
[1:08:40] love that he had for the people and all
[1:08:42] those things because the Holy Spirit is
[1:08:45] what drove him to to behave like that
[1:08:48] all of his actions all of his love all
[1:08:50] of his care all of his compassion that
[1:08:53] he had when he when he raised the dead
[1:08:56] we restore back you know and and all
[1:08:57] those things that he did when he had
[1:08:59] compassion when he loved the people that
[1:09:01] was all because the Holy Spirit had love
[1:09:03] Oh a spirit had compassion and now that
[1:09:06] same depository of the Holy Spirit the
[1:09:10] body of Lord Jesus Christ had been
[1:09:12] rejected by man and upon a cross and he
[1:09:16] hung upon he hung between heaven and
[1:09:18] earth and there they crucified him and
[1:09:22] they were sad they've lost it they've
[1:09:25] lost their their opportunity they've
[1:09:27] lost their chance they've they that the
[1:09:30] Holy Spirit returned back to him again
[1:09:31] but now they lost it but here they see
[1:09:34] Jesus as they were gathered together in
[1:09:37] the room Jesus Christ comes back he
[1:09:38] appears right in the midst of the room
[1:09:40] he shows them the holes in his hands
[1:09:42] they show he shows him the hole in his
[1:09:44] side and they began to realize that
[1:09:46] death cannot stop him the Holy Spirit is
[1:09:50] back with us again amen but now think
[1:09:54] about those now let's keep reading here
[1:09:56] amen verse 20 says and when he had so
[1:09:59] said he showed them his hands and his
[1:10:01] side and then were the disciples glad
[1:10:04] when they saw the Lord
[1:10:05] and then jesus said to them and this
[1:10:08] said Jesus to them again peace be unto
[1:10:10] you even as my father has sent me so
[1:10:13] send I you and when he had said this he
[1:10:17] breathed on them and said unto them
[1:10:19] receive ye the Holy Ghost think about
[1:10:24] that
[1:10:25] people these were not priests these were
[1:10:31] just fisherman laborers
[1:10:35] techmakers and now there they grew up in
[1:10:41] Judaism they've seen all the traditions
[1:10:43] and all the things and all the things
[1:10:46] that God but now the Holy Spirit that
[1:10:48] they always heard about now this God in
[1:10:52] flesh is breathing upon them and telling
[1:10:54] them now I want you to receive the Holy
[1:10:57] Ghost the same way I receive the Holy
[1:10:59] Ghost amen
[1:11:01] and now what does the Holy Ghost do
[1:11:03] remember what happened in the book of
[1:11:04] Acts as they are all gathered in an
[1:11:06] upper room they shut themselves in and
[1:11:09] he told them wait here until you be
[1:11:12] endued with power on high and they go
[1:11:14] into the upper room and they're waiting
[1:11:16] in there they're praying they're
[1:11:18] repenting they're making all things
[1:11:20] right they're worshiping their God there
[1:11:22] they're just rejoicing before the Lord
[1:11:24] and all of a sudden this thing that
[1:11:26] Jesus spoke about comes to pass that the
[1:11:29] Holy Spirit comes into that room like a
[1:11:32] rushing mighty wind and they are all
[1:11:34] filled with the Holy Ghost and the same
[1:11:36] pillar of fire that led the children in
[1:11:39] the will of the children of Israel back
[1:11:41] in the wilderness in Moses day that same
[1:11:43] color of fire reappears again two
[1:11:46] thousand years fourteen hundred years
[1:11:47] later in Jesus's day and splits apart
[1:11:51] into 120 pieces and lands upon their
[1:11:54] head and the same Holy Ghost is now upon
[1:11:58] their heads this is the same pillar of
[1:12:01] fire that they saw upon the temple the
[1:12:02] same pillar fire there was with the
[1:12:04] juice on the Tabernacle in the
[1:12:05] wilderness that same pillar fire that
[1:12:07] was dwelling inside the Lord Jesus
[1:12:09] Christ is now upon their heads amen and
[1:12:13] there were joycie
[1:12:14] and all sudden what happens the same
[1:12:16] thing that mary said let it be unto me
[1:12:18] according to thy word now they are also
[1:12:21] saying unto them let it be unto us
[1:12:24] they've rejoiced important about the
[1:12:25] word and now they're receiving the word
[1:12:27] and the pillar fire drops right down
[1:12:30] into their heart and now they have made
[1:12:32] room for the word of God they've been
[1:12:35] filled with the Holy Ghost amen now it's
[1:12:39] no longer just for profits now longer
[1:12:42] it's no longer just for the ministry but
[1:12:44] now for every true believer can become a
[1:12:48] depository of the
[1:12:49] host the indwelling Holy Spirit amen
[1:12:52] now the whole same Holy Spirit that
[1:12:55] brooded over the dark world amen that
[1:12:58] created a Garden of Eden back then now
[1:13:01] is Bruton over your heart to do the same
[1:13:04] thing the same Holy Spirit that brooded
[1:13:08] over the dark worth in Genesis chapter 1
[1:13:10] has now brooding over your heart to see
[1:13:13] to look upon all things to see if you
[1:13:17] will make room for him to see if you'd
[1:13:21] now think about it when that Shunammite
[1:13:24] woman made room for the Word of God
[1:13:28] and he went in there and he found that
[1:13:30] door and he entered into there well he
[1:13:32] made when that room was made for him
[1:13:34] what'd he do the word came in to that
[1:13:37] room that she built for him and he laid
[1:13:40] down and he rested and as soon as the
[1:13:44] word found a place to rest inside of
[1:13:48] there inside that inner chamber the
[1:13:50] whole sudden the God began speaking to
[1:13:53] that word began speaking God's voice
[1:13:55] came right into the inner chamber and
[1:13:57] said whatever she has need of whatever
[1:14:00] she desires give it to her and so the
[1:14:04] same thing happens to us when we when
[1:14:08] the word comes to our heart he examines
[1:14:10] all things to see what the condition of
[1:14:13] our heart is and if we forsake all and
[1:14:16] we receive him the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:19] amen
[1:14:20] he says whosoever believeth on me amen
[1:14:24] the same shall have everlasting life and
[1:14:26] there is only one form of everlasting
[1:14:28] life that's the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:14:30] Himself a man you know when they taught
[1:14:33] me in Sunday school that Jesus would be
[1:14:36] in my heart I never realized how how
[1:14:39] deep of a saying that was but the same
[1:14:43] Lord Jesus is the same one that created
[1:14:45] the heavens and the earth back in the
[1:14:46] beginning the same one that created the
[1:14:49] heavens on earth and back in the
[1:14:51] beginning has now come to dwell inside
[1:14:53] of my heart and Jesus said to his
[1:14:56] disciples behold all power in heaven and
[1:14:58] earth is given unto me and now this just
[1:15:01] like the father has
[1:15:03] me now I am sending you out into the
[1:15:05] world and then he came in he looked in
[1:15:09] their heart and they made all things
[1:15:11] right and he came and he dwelled in
[1:15:13] their heart the indwelling of the Holy
[1:15:15] Ghost now it's like they're back in the
[1:15:18] Garden of Eden again like it was before
[1:15:19] the fall communing with their Lord and
[1:15:22] Savior it's just sometimes I don't know
[1:15:25] if we realize who is actually trying to
[1:15:28] get into our hearts amen
[1:15:31] now think about it when he went when he
[1:15:33] went into Jerusalem on the donkey he
[1:15:35] went into the temple where he should
[1:15:37] have been welcomed and he couldn't find
[1:15:39] any place to rest amen
[1:15:42] think about when Noah had the dove on
[1:15:44] upon the ark he sent the dove out on the
[1:15:47] Dove went flying over the earth it is
[1:15:49] just like the Holy Spirit brooding in
[1:15:51] the beginning the Dove brooded over the
[1:15:53] the flood waters of Noah's Flood and he
[1:15:55] could not find a place to rest so he
[1:15:57] returned back to the ark amen it's a
[1:16:01] pattern that repeats over and over and
[1:16:03] over and over again in the scripture and
[1:16:05] you know that pattern is still repeating
[1:16:07] over maybe in this room right now this
[1:16:09] morning at the Holy Spirit right now is
[1:16:13] brooding over your heart examining all
[1:16:15] things and tell me you know what is the
[1:16:19] condition of your heart right now is it
[1:16:22] as dark as the world was back in Genesis
[1:16:25] chapter 1 when the Holy Spirit is
[1:16:27] brooding over it is there is there is
[1:16:29] there sin there is there anything there
[1:16:32] have you received the word or not Amen
[1:16:35] because you know we can't just receive
[1:16:36] part of the word we have to receive the
[1:16:38] whole gospel we have to receive every
[1:16:40] part of it we have to be like Mary and
[1:16:42] say Lord whatever it is this may seem
[1:16:45] strange this may seem a little odd I I
[1:16:47] understand what the preacher is saying
[1:16:49] sometimes I understand what it is when
[1:16:51] he says this but do you just spoon the
[1:16:53] we you see the word in action behind the
[1:16:55] pulpit you say yes Lord be it unto me
[1:16:58] according to the Word of God and the
[1:17:00] Holy Spirit brooding upon your heart
[1:17:02] waiting to see if you will make a little
[1:17:05] room for him see if you will make a
[1:17:08] little chamber and then no longer the
[1:17:10] word coming by
[1:17:12] adrià church service and then leaving
[1:17:14] again afterwards but
[1:17:16] now once you've made room for the Holy
[1:17:18] Spirit and he broods over your life he
[1:17:20] comes to stay he comes to live he comes
[1:17:24] to dwell he comes to change you he comes
[1:17:27] to give you power to become a son of God
[1:17:29] and you're no longer a child of mr. mrs.
[1:17:33] whoever it is they gave birth to you but
[1:17:35] now you are a son or a daughter of God
[1:17:38] amen no longer just of the innate and
[1:17:41] the natural nature of your parents but
[1:17:44] now you've been born again of the Living
[1:17:46] Most High God and he the word has come
[1:17:49] to you he's come to live inside your
[1:17:51] heart and he's come to make you a new
[1:17:53] creature in Christ amen did you know
[1:17:56] that we're still living in Bible days
[1:17:59] Bible days are still here on the earth
[1:18:01] and there are still Bible characters
[1:18:04] walking on this earth amen and it's no
[1:18:07] longer just Mary's and Martha's but now
[1:18:10] it's Troy's Jesse's and Wendy's and
[1:18:14] veins amen
[1:18:16] walking on the earth and what is it the
[1:18:19] same Holy Ghost that brooded in the
[1:18:20] beginning the same Holy Ghost that
[1:18:22] brooded over the tabernacle the
[1:18:24] wilderness the same Holy Ghost that
[1:18:26] appeared over Saul was tipple when they
[1:18:27] built it the same Holy Spirit that John
[1:18:29] the Baptist saw upon the Lord Jesus
[1:18:31] Christ the same Holy Spirit that
[1:18:33] appeared in the Upper Room is now in
[1:18:35] this room right now he created the
[1:18:39] heavens and the earth he created you and
[1:18:43] before you know and the Bible says that
[1:18:47] we would all that we would all that
[1:18:51] everybody would fall short of the glory
[1:18:53] of God now what is the glory of God it
[1:18:57] is His Holy Spirit it is his presence it
[1:19:00] is him it is the the gravity of his
[1:19:03] presence is his glory he comes into the
[1:19:05] room his glory goes out because it's his
[1:19:08] presence it makes everything humble
[1:19:10] themselves it makes everything that's
[1:19:11] this presents amen but he said that all
[1:19:14] of us would fall short of that glory in
[1:19:16] Romans three that we would fall short of
[1:19:20] being able to have that glory dwelling
[1:19:22] on the inside of us
[1:19:24] amen why because we were designed our
[1:19:27] heart was designed to have a
[1:19:29] room there there will be a depository of
[1:19:32] the glory of God but we would fall short
[1:19:36] of that but you know God did two things
[1:19:39] before the foundation of the world
[1:19:41] before God created one blade of grass
[1:19:45] before one minute of time for one tree
[1:19:49] one animal one plant God did a couple
[1:19:51] things one thing one thing is that he
[1:19:55] wrote our names upon the Lamb's Book of
[1:19:57] Life amen
[1:20:00] he wrote our names upon Elena's book of
[1:20:03] life and then you know what he did right
[1:20:05] after that he went and he slew a lamb
[1:20:08] the Bible says he's the lairs a lamb
[1:20:10] that was slain from the foundation of
[1:20:12] the world a Sulha lamb for those names
[1:20:15] so it just in case there would be no
[1:20:18] speck of time where if any one of those
[1:20:20] names ever fell short of having the
[1:20:22] glory of God that there would be a blood
[1:20:24] sacrifice for those names now we have
[1:20:27] come we've been born on this earth we've
[1:20:29] manifested the name that God has given
[1:20:30] us amen but if God has written your name
[1:20:33] upon the Lamb's Book of Life amen
[1:20:36] he already has a sacrifice there if you
[1:20:39] have fallen short of his glory some way
[1:20:41] somehow which we all have there is a
[1:20:43] sacrifice there to make all things right
[1:20:45] so that you can make a room so that the
[1:20:48] Holy Ghost so you can be like Adam and
[1:20:50] Eve before the fall walking with God in
[1:20:54] a perfect garden where he come down in
[1:20:57] the cool of the day and walk with you
[1:20:59] and talk with you as you kneel beside
[1:21:01] your bed and pray amen as as you're in
[1:21:04] your kitchen doing the dishes that you
[1:21:06] can talk to him and commune with them
[1:21:07] why because the glory of God has been
[1:21:10] restored back to you amen and he's come
[1:21:13] that you might have life and have it
[1:21:15] more abundantly he's come to live with
[1:21:16] you day in day out day in day out not
[1:21:19] just the word coming by your heart and
[1:21:21] then disappearing again but now the word
[1:21:23] has come to dwell and when he comes to
[1:21:25] dwell and as the word is resting in your
[1:21:28] heart just like Elijah was resting in
[1:21:31] that inner chamber as he's resting there
[1:21:33] amen and as you make room for him amen
[1:21:36] the Lord says whatsoever you desire
[1:21:39] let it'll be unto you Amen let's turn or
[1:21:42] to
[1:21:43] chapter 15 John 14 sorry John 14:13
[1:21:57] listen to what the word says here the
[1:22:00] word himself spoke the three verses I'm
[1:22:02] going to read here John 14:13 John 15:7
[1:22:05] and John 16:23 three chapters in a row
[1:22:09] here John 14:13 says and whatsoever
[1:22:14] let's go to read from verse 12 amen
[1:22:18] verily verily I say unto you he that
[1:22:20] believeth on me the works that I do
[1:22:22] shall he do also and greater works than
[1:22:25] these shall he do because I go unto my
[1:22:28] father and whatsoever he shall I ask him
[1:22:31] my name that will I do that the father
[1:22:33] may be glorified in the son now let's
[1:22:36] read 15-7 says if he abide in me and my
[1:22:42] words abide in you you shall ask what
[1:22:45] you will and it shall be done unto you
[1:22:48] else read chapter 16 verse 23 it says he
[1:22:53] that it says and in that day he shall
[1:23:00] ask me nothing verily verily I say unto
[1:23:02] you whosoever or whatsoever he shall ask
[1:23:06] the Father in my name he will give it to
[1:23:09] you
[1:23:09] hitherto have you asked nothing in my
[1:23:12] name ask and you shall receive that your
[1:23:15] joy might be full and the same one that
[1:23:18] said that is here to live in your heart
[1:23:21] to make that verse come to pass
[1:23:24] amen amen yo Louis three sister verses
[1:23:28] to these verses in the book of Esther we
[1:23:30] won't read them but if you remember in
[1:23:31] the book of Esther if you were writing
[1:23:33] down it's Esther five three
[1:23:35] Esther six why I believe this and Esther
[1:23:38] 72 and it was worthy saying what's what
[1:23:41] do you want was where King as Earth is
[1:23:42] talking to Esther's like what do you
[1:23:44] want whatever you want you just ask I'll
[1:23:46] give it to you up to the half of the
[1:23:48] kingdom there's three verses in Esther
[1:23:51] three verses in John what do you want
[1:23:53] what do you whatever you ask it'll be
[1:23:54] done to you up to the half of the
[1:23:56] kingdom amen now what what Scott's not
[1:23:58] saying ask I've opened up my checkbook
[1:24:02] for you
[1:24:03] amen now we've come here with claim to
[1:24:07] be the bride of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:09] you know when when when my paycheck
[1:24:12] comes to my bank account my wife has the
[1:24:16] checkbook the debit card and the credit
[1:24:17] card amen and you know what I don't have
[1:24:21] to quiz her ask her how she's gonna
[1:24:24] spend it because I know that she is my
[1:24:26] bride and I know that she's faithful
[1:24:28] with the funds that I have and she goes
[1:24:31] about if there is a need in my household
[1:24:34] she goes out and purchases it for the
[1:24:36] needs of the household and she's been
[1:24:39] faithful with my checkbook now the Lord
[1:24:41] Jesus Christ did the same thing right
[1:24:42] here we are the bride of Lord Jesus
[1:24:45] Christ and if there be any needs in the
[1:24:47] kingdom of the Most High God we have the
[1:24:50] ability to purchase that through prayer
[1:24:51] and as the word is resting upon our
[1:24:55] heart and as we begin to have compassion
[1:24:57] on those the same compassion that the
[1:25:00] Lord Jesus had and we enter into his
[1:25:02] compassion and we begin to have
[1:25:03] compassion upon those who are lost
[1:25:05] those that are sick those are out of the
[1:25:08] way those that are depressed depressed
[1:25:11] and we begin to have compassion on those
[1:25:13] we open up the checkbook of God we start
[1:25:15] pleading
[1:25:16] lord have mercy Lord heal Lord save Lord
[1:25:20] deliver why because the word is resting
[1:25:22] upon our hearts amen and we as the Bride
[1:25:25] of Christ know what is bar about our
[1:25:28] father's business seeing to the needs of
[1:25:31] the kingdom a man why because we made
[1:25:34] room for the Word of God Lord let it be
[1:25:38] unto me just according to the Word of
[1:25:40] God amen amen
[1:25:43] and when Mary had said that that's when
[1:25:45] the angel departed because he knew the
[1:25:47] word had left her mind and has sunk down
[1:25:51] into her heart because she had received
[1:25:53] every word of God amen we have to be in
[1:25:57] the same condition we have to be filled
[1:26:00] with the Holy Ghost you know if you ever
[1:26:03] thought about how the descriptions of
[1:26:06] the Holy Ghost of how he fills us about
[1:26:10] said we'd be filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:12] he said that would be baptized with the
[1:26:14] Holy Ghost baptism means immersion a
[1:26:18] meant completely immersed under the
[1:26:21] power of the water amen because you're
[1:26:23] immersed in the water amen now to be
[1:26:26] just like you were baptized with water
[1:26:28] amen the Bible says repent and be
[1:26:31] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:26:33] Christ and you shall receive the gift of
[1:26:35] the Holy Ghost amen so the same the same
[1:26:38] Baptist just as much as you are immersed
[1:26:40] in the water you are now to be immersed
[1:26:42] in all the ills immerse in the Holy
[1:26:46] Ghost filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:26:48] completely immersed why so he can have
[1:26:50] complete control
[1:26:52] Lord Jesus I have given my heart to you
[1:26:56] I have forsaken all I have given all
[1:26:59] unto you lord I pray that you come and
[1:27:01] fill me with your Holy Ghost that I
[1:27:03] might be your child that I might be the
[1:27:06] received the spiritual adoption that I
[1:27:08] might be about my father's business no
[1:27:11] longer about the business of my own
[1:27:13] natural ways but now I've been restored
[1:27:16] back to the Garden of Eden like it was
[1:27:17] before the fall now I am your Adam now I
[1:27:20] am your Eve like I never fell in the
[1:27:22] first place why because God's had lamb
[1:27:25] sacrificed just in case we fell short of
[1:27:28] his glory that we could be restored back

[1:32:42] that you would cover us with the blood
[1:32:45] of the light that we might be forgiven
[1:32:47] of all our sins as we repent of our sins
[1:32:51] Lord and as we are baptized in the name
