[37:50] so god richly bless you buddy
[37:56] thank the lord for his grace let's go to
[37:59] one
[38:03] i think i'd like to read out of three
[38:04] portions of scripture this morning if it
[38:06] would be all right i'll just try to
[38:09] quickly get to the word
[38:13] joshua chapter one we're looking at i
[38:17] think part three
[38:18] of this little series here on the book
[38:20] of joshua
[38:33] i had three or four vindications
[38:35] yesterday when i was studying uh
[38:37] i talked to different people on the
[38:38] phone and
[38:41] talking to different people they kept
[38:42] saying things about being strong and
[38:44] needing god's strength and
[38:46] overcoming fear and so i just knew it
[38:49] was the
[38:50] i feel like this is the right way to go
[38:52] i'm feeling it
[38:53] so it would please the lord this morning
[38:54] to look at this little thought here
[38:58] joshua chapter 1
[39:06] praise god let's look at verse five
[39:08] we'll just read five only want to start
[39:10] with this thought of how god
[39:12] promised to never leave joshua
[39:15] he promised to be there with him
[39:17] faithfully
[39:19] continually so let's read verse five
[39:21] together
[39:22] one two three there shall not any man be
[39:26] able to stand before thee all the days
[39:29] of thy life
[39:30] as i was with moses so will i be with
[39:33] thee
[39:34] i will not fail thee neither for safety
[39:37] i'm sorry nor forsake me go to hebrews
[39:39] 13 verse 5. let's read that
[39:43] so we have the old testament version of
[39:45] god saying i'm never going to leave you
[39:48] and here's the new testament version
[39:50] where god said i'll never leave you of
[39:52] course there's others jesus said i'm
[39:53] with you
[39:54] lo i'm with you alway even to the end of
[39:56] the world
[39:57] but hebrews 13 says jesus is with me i'm
[40:01] glad to know
[40:02] christ is here this morning amen
[40:05] because he promised hebrews 13 5.
[40:13] he's here for many reasons but we'll see
[40:15] in verse five and six
[40:17] i'll just read verse five and six myself
[40:18] let your conversation be without
[40:20] covetousness
[40:21] and be content with such things for he
[40:24] has said i will never leave thee
[40:26] nor forsake thee here's a new testament
[40:28] writer
[40:29] saying god is going to always be with us
[40:32] and never forsake us now let's read
[40:34] verse six together
[40:35] one two three so that we may boldly say
[40:38] the lord is my helper
[40:40] and i will not fear what man shall do
[40:43] unto me so god's presence brings such a
[40:46] confidence that we're not afraid what
[40:48] any man can do
[40:49] to us no man or woman shall be able to
[40:52] stand before us
[40:53] all the days of our life amen let's read
[40:55] one more uh james the next
[40:57] book hebrews james five seven through
[41:00] eight and i
[41:01] sent brother bang a text to get his uh
[41:05] memory verse ready for march by god's
[41:06] grace
[41:08] so we have a couple more services in
[41:09] february we'll move on to march if the
[41:12] lord terry's here
[41:14] james 5 this is our memory verse
[41:17] and as we said may god write this upon
[41:19] the tables of our heart here
[41:22] let's read this psalm three one two
[41:25] three be
[41:26] patient therefore brethren unto the
[41:28] coming of the lord
[41:30] behold the husbandman waiteth for the
[41:32] precious fruit of the earth
[41:34] and have long patience for it until he
[41:38] received the early and latter rain
[41:40] beat your hearts for the thing of the
[41:43] lord draweth not
[41:45] let's have a word of prayer if you have
[41:46] a unspoken need on your heart let's just
[41:48] make it known unto the lord somehow
[41:50] heavenly father we just come again in
[41:52] your presence we're so encouraged by
[41:53] this word
[41:54] already lord god you promised you'd
[41:57] never leave us
[41:58] or first nor forsake us lord and the
[42:00] scripture says
[42:02] men swear by something greater than
[42:04] themselves but lord you couldn't do that
[42:06] you couldn't find anything greater than
[42:07] yourself
[42:08] so you swore by yourself so thank you
[42:11] lord for your unfailing promises
[42:13] from the eternal one from the
[42:14] all-powerful one from the almighty one
[42:17] the almighty god tells us he never
[42:19] leaves us nor forsakes us
[42:20] we thank you for your presence lord god
[42:22] that we feel this morning
[42:24] just speak to us in a special way lord
[42:26] and i pray your holy ghost we'll have
[42:27] preeminence lord bless each and every
[42:29] soul
[42:30] here our visitor brother shang all the
[42:32] saints lord that are here
[42:33] those live streaming god just have your
[42:35] way let your spirit give us the word of
[42:37] life
[42:38] that we're so hungering for in jesus
[42:40] christ's name and the saint said
[42:42] amen god bless you as you're seated
[42:44] there praise god
[42:49] i had to go in my office there because i
[42:50] just want to pull out that uh dictionary
[42:52] real quick i'll probably get to that
[42:53] just a little bit
[42:54] i mentioned that a little bit last year
[42:56] i mentioned that a little bit this year
[42:58] as well for this service here
[43:03] so i think we can switch over here i
[43:05] like to show some quotes
[43:07] i hope this will be okay you know i've
[43:08] been mentioning the last few weeks about
[43:10] um how god told joshua
[43:15] no matter what uh he would never leave
[43:17] him right he would never leave him nor
[43:19] forsake him
[43:20] and and uh we're told brother branham
[43:22] tells us that
[43:23] that no matter when we make mistakes or
[43:26] failures as long as we confess our sins
[43:28] and say we're sorry
[43:30] god will never leave us and so we want
[43:32] to i just want to look at that thought
[43:34] of course that's jordan
[43:35] uh before it would uh or that was that's
[43:37] what it looked like you know kind of
[43:38] when joshua would
[43:40] would walk in there and the waters would
[43:41] move back it was such a mighty river at
[43:43] that time
[43:44] but god god uh broke it of course
[43:46] divided it
[43:48] uh so i want to just briefly review you
[43:50] know the last two services we looked at
[43:52] four apple four different applications
[43:54] to joshua
[43:56] and uh then last week we showed joshua's
[43:59] character before he became the leader
[44:02] i like his character he's just quick to
[44:06] get an army ready the very first thing
[44:07] we hear he's ready to go fight
[44:09] the next day he said get an army ready
[44:11] you're fighting amalek the next day
[44:13] then we see him he just wants to spend
[44:14] time at the house of god
[44:17] just in god's presence and uh seeking
[44:20] god's face
[44:20] it's such a beautiful picture of the
[44:22] believer today that they just want to
[44:24] spend time
[44:24] in god's presence amen and so uh today i
[44:28] want to take a couple of thoughts
[44:29] i want to look at two thoughts that are
[44:30] kind of within this application
[44:33] uh the first application of how crossing
[44:35] jordan for
[44:36] joshua represents us crossing into the
[44:39] new birth
[44:40] or the born-again experience uh the
[44:42] baptism of the holy ghost this third
[44:44] work of grace i want to look at
[44:45] a couple of thoughts going into this
[44:48] this first thought that god never
[44:50] forsakes you despite your failures
[44:53] uh so if you make a mistake god's not
[44:55] gonna leave you forever right
[44:58] of course the bible says after chasing
[44:59] you like a child affect you
[45:01] but he's never gonna leave you right
[45:03] he's never going to forsake you and
[45:05] i'm looking at brother branham's example
[45:06] here and then i want to hope to end by
[45:08] this
[45:09] i hope to end with this understanding
[45:11] your position in the promised land
[45:13] the holy ghost baptism i just kind of
[45:14] want to review a few thoughts
[45:17] on that by god's grace
[45:20] so let's start with this now i want to
[45:22] remember this from uh
[45:23] last week you know god told joshua as i
[45:25] was with moses
[45:27] so will i be with you i will not fail
[45:30] thee
[45:31] nor forsake thee right and he sells and
[45:34] be strong and of courage now
[45:35] brother adam says that uh he said i'm
[45:38] going to skip down here what a
[45:39] consolation
[45:41] must have been to joshua when he heard
[45:43] god say
[45:44] as i was with moses so i'll be with you
[45:46] although if i'm trying and i
[45:47] fail god won't leave me i don't have
[45:51] much confidence in anybody that's
[45:53] too afraid to do anything i'd rather be
[45:57] found a failure
[45:58] than too lazy to try so
[46:02] the the issue is with laziness we we all
[46:04] know we've got something to do
[46:06] but we've all got to overcome the fear
[46:09] uh that satan is bringing at us or the
[46:12] laziness temptation
[46:14] right so we've got to overcome fear and
[46:16] we've got to overcome
[46:18] the lazy spirit amen how many warriors
[46:20] we got here this morning
[46:21] that want to they want to be strong and
[46:24] they want to be
[46:24] active praise god amen they don't want
[46:27] to be sitting on the sideline they want
[46:28] to be out on the front lines amen
[46:30] so we got two things we got to overcome
[46:32] we got to overcome fear
[46:34] and the bible said perfect love casts
[46:36] out all fear
[46:38] so if we're scared of something we got
[46:39] to go back and remember our first love
[46:41] we gotta and that's jesus christ
[46:43] amen hallelujah the love of jesus christ
[46:46] the fact that he loved me
[46:47] first he died for me first he died to
[46:50] save me first
[46:51] and then i recognized that then i love
[46:53] him amen
[46:55] and no man can stand before me or you
[46:57] all the days of our life
[46:59] now i want to bring this up too he said
[47:02] god don't hold you responsible for your
[47:04] mistakes
[47:06] he only holds you responsible for your
[47:08] willful sin
[47:10] okay so i want to just want to just look
[47:11] at this for a moment here because i want
[47:13] to look at the example
[47:14] of william branham here uh but he says
[47:18] and then he quotes a scripture he that
[47:19] sends
[47:22] you the truth but a man that's going to
[47:24] do something
[47:28] right oh i hate the blunder right so do
[47:30] you we hate to blunder but we got to
[47:32] realize
[47:33] we're human we're going to blunder
[47:36] we're going to embarrass ourselves
[47:37] sometimes
[47:39] right we're going to make a blunder
[47:41] we're going to feel like we've disgraced
[47:43] christianity we've disgraced god but he
[47:46] says
[47:47] you're going to fall you're going to
[47:48] make mistakes but if you're really
[47:50] divinely called and god's in your heart
[47:53] you'll rise again amen
[47:56] amen in other words you won't quit
[47:57] praise god amen
[47:59] if you if you really feel god's love in
[48:01] your heart and you know
[48:02] god's called you to do something even if
[48:05] you make a mistake
[48:06] you're going to try again amen amen
[48:08] hallelujah
[48:09] that's why you know some of my sermons
[48:11] may fall to the ground brother shank
[48:12] sleep while i'm preaching and it may
[48:13] and it's my fault many times it may be
[48:15] my fault right but that's not
[48:17] but that doesn't going to stop me from
[48:19] going to pray more it's not going to
[48:20] stop me from going to fast and
[48:22] seek god's face and and live in this
[48:24] bible praise god
[48:25] until it becomes more of a reality to me
[48:27] that my life can be a blessing that the
[48:29] light of christ can reflect off of me
[48:31] and people can see the light of jesus
[48:33] through me praise god
[48:35] amen it's never going to stop me no
[48:36] matter how many mistakes i make we're
[48:38] all going to blunder
[48:39] right everyone's going to fall short
[48:41] you're never going to find a perfect
[48:43] christian
[48:44] the only perfect one is jesus christ
[48:46] amen that's the one we're all
[48:48] following we're all trying to strive to
[48:50] be like jesus
[48:51] but we're all going to stumble but we've
[48:53] all got to learn to take up our cross
[48:55] again
[48:55] follow jesus never give up and give
[48:58] everything we have to the lord
[49:00] amen amen now i want to um
[49:03] look at now here's the scripture that
[49:05] brother graham's quoting
[49:06] now look this is hebrews 10 because this
[49:09] is the covenant
[49:10] of course this is the new the new
[49:11] covenant after the old is vanished away
[49:14] the curse of the law he said the new
[49:16] covenant i'll make with them after those
[49:18] days saith the lord i love this
[49:19] i'll put my laws into their hearts and
[49:22] in their minds will i write them
[49:24] amen church if we got the word on our
[49:27] minds we should be thinking about it
[49:30] right if you if god if you let god write
[49:33] the word on your heart and your mind
[49:35] then it should be on your thoughts all
[49:36] the time
[49:38] right and there are sins and iniquities
[49:40] well i remember no more what a blessing
[49:42] man
[49:43] now where remission of these is
[49:45] remission means sending away
[49:47] right just like you send a letter away
[49:48] or you send something back to the
[49:50] company this doesn't fit
[49:51] i'm going to send it back you remit that
[49:53] you send it away right
[49:55] well that's what the bible says the
[49:56] remission of sins is
[49:58] there's no more offering for sin praise
[50:00] god hallelujah so there's no more
[50:02] uh condemnation to them that are in
[50:04] christ jesus now notice the next verse
[50:07] is now here's where we get to this idea
[50:09] now we're forgiven as long as we confess
[50:11] them but then the bible says we've got
[50:13] to
[50:14] we've got to not forsake the assembling
[50:16] of ourselves together
[50:17] as some is this week i talked to a man
[50:19] in canada
[50:20] and he's uh he doesn't go to church
[50:22] anymore he said i don't see any benefit
[50:23] to it
[50:24] and he said we're gonna he said i'm
[50:25] gonna be ready for the rapture i said no
[50:26] you're not
[50:28] i said you got you have to assemble at
[50:30] church if you want to go in the rapture
[50:32] praise god
[50:32] you've got to because you've got to be
[50:34] with the body jesus christ is the head
[50:36] right
[50:37] this this imagery but you and i are the
[50:40] body
[50:40] amen he's the head the head is in heaven
[50:43] but the body of jesus christ is here on
[50:46] earth and we've got to be a part of that
[50:48] body amen
[50:49] we can't say we're not a part of that
[50:51] body we've got to find our place
[50:53] in the body and we've got to do our job
[50:55] we've got to serve our function
[50:58] we've got to serve our purpose in the
[50:59] body of christ amen
[51:01] we can't be cut off or attached to it or
[51:03] detached from the body
[51:05] we've got to be a part of the body we've
[51:07] got to be feeding the body
[51:08] strengthening the body cleaning the body
[51:11] helping the body amen
[51:12] we've all got a part to play in the body
[51:14] of christ
[51:15] in other words i need you in my life and
[51:18] you need me
[51:18] and your life praise god we need one
[51:21] another in our lives we're going to
[51:22] sharpen each other like
[51:23] like the children i've been seeing right
[51:26] we're going to sharpen one another with
[51:27] the word
[51:28] with testimonies with with scriptures
[51:31] we're going to sharpen one another we're
[51:32] going to build one another up
[51:34] because we're a body and we're growing
[51:35] together and we're growing up the bible
[51:37] said
[51:38] into him praise god amen
[51:42] see we don't forsake god but we exhort
[51:46] or we encourage one another
[51:47] and the more we do it more as you see
[51:50] the day approaching
[51:51] so we should see ourselves gathering
[51:53] more coming to church i preach on that
[51:54] all the time so i'll move on
[51:56] for if we sin willfully after that we
[51:59] receive the knowledge of the truth
[52:01] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[52:03] sin so
[52:04] this is the same chapter as we read
[52:06] earlier right
[52:08] the bible says you're if you write the
[52:10] word of god upon your heart all your
[52:12] sins are remitted
[52:13] but then it says a few verses later but
[52:15] if you purposely sin
[52:17] and do it on purpose and forsake the
[52:19] body of christ
[52:20] there's no more sacrifice for your sin
[52:23] because you've left it you
[52:24] you've left the sacrifice right and we
[52:27] don't want to leave it
[52:28] we want to stay right stay right there
[52:30] with it praise god
[52:31] amen and all that's left for someone
[52:34] that leaves the body of christ and
[52:35] doesn't go to church
[52:36] and and sins willfully they live a life
[52:39] of iniquity
[52:40] the only thing that's left for them is a
[52:42] fearful looking for
[52:44] of judgment and fiery indignation which
[52:47] shall devour the adversaries
[52:49] so in other words the house of god is
[52:51] where you find mercy praise god amen
[52:53] this is where you find god's mercy amen
[52:55] this is where the blood of christ is
[52:57] preached amen
[52:58] this is where you access the blood of
[53:00] jesus christ because the spirit of god
[53:03] is preaching about access to the blood
[53:05] amen amen
[53:06] but if you leave that away and leaving
[53:08] iniquity iniquity is uh
[53:10] knowing the truth but transgressing it
[53:12] on purpose right
[53:14] then all that remains left is judgment
[53:16] thank god for his mercy that we can have
[53:18] today
[53:21] so true
[53:26] now i want to spend a little time on
[53:27] brother brown now i want to i've got
[53:29] this book for brother shang
[53:30] uh because i think i showed it to you
[53:31] guys a few
[53:33] weeks ago i'm sorry months probably
[53:36] about six months
[53:37] ago by this time so i just want to show
[53:40] it uh the reason brother
[53:42] uh shang and everybody watching too i've
[53:44] got numerous questions online too about
[53:45] brother branham
[53:46] we're not worshiping brother branham
[53:48] all's we're saying is that he was a
[53:50] prophet
[53:51] and he spoke in the name of the lord am
[53:54] i
[53:55] my next coming book i got 30 thus saith
[53:57] the lords
[53:58] 30. now guys like t.d jakes and joe
[54:02] osteen
[54:02] they've never spoken thus saith the lord
[54:05] but who speaks thus saith the lord a
[54:08] prophet speaks not saith the lord
[54:10] all you gotta do is open up jeremiah
[54:12] open up ezekiel i think there's about
[54:13] 200 some thus saith the lord's in
[54:15] ezekiel
[54:17] when you're a prophet of god you speak
[54:19] thus saith the lord
[54:21] okay so the reason i want to we're not
[54:23] worshipping brother brandon but we're
[54:24] looking at his example in his life
[54:26] and how he had to under he had to grow
[54:29] in grace
[54:30] he had to he had to grow an
[54:31] understanding uh and this book shows how
[54:35] uh the whole revival from the 1940s and
[54:38] 50s was
[54:39] all started by brother ramsey's ministry
[54:41] of course it was the holy ghost right
[54:43] in the brother band's ministry you know
[54:45] they have his picture in there with the
[54:46] revivals and everything thousands of
[54:48] thousands of people
[54:49] there's the pillar of fire picture 1950
[54:51] the pillar of fire took a picture with
[54:53] god's prophet
[54:54] well the pillar of fire was with another
[54:55] prophet named moses
[54:57] the pillar of fire was with another
[54:59] prophet named paul
[55:01] on the road to damascus so the pillar of
[55:03] fire always
[55:04] accompanies a prophet amen amen so i
[55:07] just want to
[55:07] share that and and brother shang when
[55:09] your dad was sick in the hospital
[55:12] your brother vang took that prayer cloth
[55:14] from brother jose
[55:16] and brother branham prayed for that
[55:18] prayer cloth
[55:19] bang laid that cloth on him your dad
[55:22] when he was in a coma
[55:23] two days later he woke up amen
[55:27] oh there you go because there's not
[55:29] power in the cloth
[55:30] but the cloth represents that god sent
[55:32] his servant amen
[55:35] amen right because the bible said god
[55:37] they took they took aprons that they
[55:39] just laid on paul's body
[55:40] and they took those aprons and they give
[55:42] it to somebody else and they get healed
[55:44] because it represents a servant of god
[55:46] was here praise god amen
[55:48] and if you've got faith in god you'll
[55:50] have faith in his servants amen
[55:53] that's why i want to just look i just
[55:54] want to take a few minutes and look at
[55:56] brother graham's
[55:57] confession how he can he confesses
[56:00] making mistakes
[56:01] but god never left him amen so i just
[56:04] want to encourage you
[56:06] moses made awful mistakes right he
[56:08] didn't circumcise his children
[56:10] and the angel was going to kill him but
[56:11] his wife saved him
[56:13] his wife saved him zapporo saved him
[56:16] because the angel was going to kill him
[56:17] but she went and circumcised gershom and
[56:19] threw the foreskin on the ground
[56:21] they said you've been a bloody husband
[56:23] to me
[56:25] and he made mistakes he smote the rock
[56:27] god said speak to the rock
[56:29] moses smote the rock and god said you
[56:31] glorified yourself
[56:32] you're not going the promised land see
[56:35] prophets are not perfect they're only
[56:36] perfect with thus saith the lord
[56:39] everything else they can be human they
[56:40] can make mistakes but when it's a real
[56:43] prophet of god he'll speak the same
[56:45] lord it will come to pass
[56:48] and that's why i'm using brother
[56:49] graham's example here so i've mentioned
[56:51] this the last two sermons so let's go
[56:53] through this here
[56:54] now this is akron right this is akron
[56:57] this is right down there by the hospital
[56:58] shang's probably familiar with that
[56:59] aren't you brother 59 right you take 59
[57:02] right there
[57:03] you drive right back i did it all the
[57:05] time years ago
[57:07] now brother brahm gives us he gives his
[57:09] teaching in this message as it was with
[57:11] moses
[57:13] motivation to deliver israel but he was
[57:15] given
[57:16] two signs so the people could see oh
[57:19] he had two signs remember his hand and
[57:21] what was the other one the hand and the
[57:24] staff thank you and the staff he had two
[57:27] signs
[57:27] to prove that he was going to take the
[57:29] people to the promised land or he's
[57:31] going to deliver them out of egypt right
[57:34] he was given two signs so the people
[57:36] would believe his commission
[57:39] now in this sermon as i was with moses
[57:42] brother adam said i was given two
[57:43] signs the first poll in the second poll
[57:46] right
[57:48] to get the people to believe the
[57:51] commission was to pray for the sick
[57:53] and he said if you can get them to
[57:54] believe not even cancer will stand
[57:56] before your prayer
[57:57] amen amen praise god
[58:01] so both prophets now that's why he's a
[58:03] brother brother man was a bible prophet
[58:05] so just like moses had two signs brother
[58:07] branham had two signs
[58:10] because he was a bible prophet
[58:13] and the beautiful part is you can we can
[58:15] listen to brother branham's second sign
[58:17] on tape
[58:18] and you can hear him tell people the
[58:20] secrets of the thoughts intents of their
[58:22] heart
[58:23] it's beautiful and it never fails amen
[58:26] hallelujah just like moses's staff never
[58:29] failed amen
[58:31] every time he struck it every time he
[58:33] threw it any time he used that it never
[58:35] failed
[58:36] amen the signs never fail
[58:39] but the signs are only there to raise
[58:41] your faith
[58:42] to possess the commission so you can
[58:46] possess
[58:46] what god has called you to do so i hope
[58:49] this helps by god's grace hope you can
[58:50] see this
[58:51] cause this is the thought now brother
[58:53] graham's his confession is he's gonna
[58:55] say
[58:55] i i labored too much on the signs
[58:59] okay now he's a human right so he got a
[59:02] little imbalance right
[59:03] he was putting too much emphasis on the
[59:05] signs
[59:07] all right but did god ever leave him god
[59:10] never left him
[59:11] amen hallelujah god never left god never
[59:14] said i'm done with you you made a
[59:16] mistake
[59:16] no he just he made a mistake he just
[59:18] overemphasized the gift
[59:20] but then he learns here in 1960 that i
[59:23] can't emphasize the gift
[59:24] i've got to emphasize the commission
[59:26] praise god
[59:27] and i think you'll see what i'm talking
[59:29] about did anybody listen to this message
[59:30] this week as always with moses
[59:32] anybody get a chance lydia did okay
[59:33] praise it amen when did you listen to it
[59:37] okay good good i didn't tell her to do
[59:40] that but good
[59:41] and if you haven't church i would
[59:42] encourage you to listen this message
[59:44] it's only a
[59:45] two hours i think it's two hours and 11
[59:46] minutes i just i go on youtube and i can
[59:49] play a little faster on there
[59:51] i played at one and a half speed so i
[59:54] can listen to a little bit faster
[59:56] because sometimes there's breaks in the
[59:58] action you know you can still catch it
[1:00:00] you can still catch a revelation so i
[1:00:02] want i just want you to see that
[1:00:05] uh that that there you know god gave
[1:00:07] them signs that were pointing to the
[1:00:09] arrival or the possession of the
[1:00:12] commission
[1:00:13] and we've gotta we've gotta make sure we
[1:00:15] don't make we don't put too much
[1:00:16] emphasis on the signs today
[1:00:18] right same thing for us okay so that's
[1:00:22] why i'm using brother bram's example
[1:00:23] because he was a very
[1:00:24] biblical prophet his ministry matches
[1:00:27] that of the bible
[1:00:29] okay now i got a lot to read here but
[1:00:32] i charge you before god the elect angels
[1:00:34] and jesus christ the commission
[1:00:36] was pray for the sick the qu the
[1:00:38] question was insufficient to do it
[1:00:40] brother ram knew he couldn't he couldn't
[1:00:42] do it he couldn't do what the angel was
[1:00:43] asking to on his own
[1:00:45] for this cause you were born this is the
[1:00:47] means of your
[1:00:48] peculiar birth and life he said
[1:00:51] that you are to pray for the sick if
[1:00:53] you'll get them to believe you and be
[1:00:55] sincere when you pray
[1:00:56] nothing shall stand before your prayer
[1:00:58] not even cancer
[1:01:00] how many has read that through the years
[1:01:01] it's all over the world now i said i
[1:01:03] cannot do it i'm insufficient to do it
[1:01:05] they won't believe me i'm poor i have no
[1:01:06] education
[1:01:07] that was me questioning he said moses
[1:01:09] was given two signs to vindicate his
[1:01:11] commission
[1:01:12] so are you not you will you're given two
[1:01:15] signs
[1:01:16] one of them will be your hand so brother
[1:01:19] shang
[1:01:20] brother branham would take people's
[1:01:22] hands i think it was his left hand right
[1:01:24] he would he would hold someone's hand
[1:01:26] and there would be dots that
[1:01:27] would arise on his hands and they would
[1:01:29] be in different patterns
[1:01:31] and depending on the pattern he could
[1:01:32] tell them what the disease was so it was
[1:01:34] tuberculosis there might be like a
[1:01:36] certain number of dots it was cancer
[1:01:38] the dots might be over there he had a
[1:01:40] gift and people saw it everybody could
[1:01:42] see it on his hand
[1:01:43] he had that gift okay
[1:01:46] the other gift he had you'll know the
[1:01:47] very secret of their hearts and their
[1:01:49] minds
[1:01:51] now that's called discernment and i've
[1:01:53] met uh i met a woman brother shang
[1:01:55] where brother branham told her in a
[1:01:57] prayer line you've got tuberculosis
[1:01:58] you're dying
[1:01:59] he said but go weigh yourself next
[1:02:01] monday you're going to gain one pound
[1:02:03] and then go your way yourself the next
[1:02:04] monday you're going to gain another
[1:02:06] pound and you're going to be healed
[1:02:07] and she was so she was dying of
[1:02:10] tuberculosis but brother
[1:02:11] and brother knew her life and told her
[1:02:13] secrets and then told her what to do
[1:02:15] and it came to pass and that's on tape
[1:02:18] it's on tape and her testimony is on
[1:02:20] tape too you can watch it on
[1:02:22] i think it's on youtube and by this
[1:02:24] they'll believe by these two signs now
[1:02:26] remember listen don't you fail to get
[1:02:27] this
[1:02:28] the sign is not the commission the sign
[1:02:30] only points to the commission
[1:02:32] right you get out here on the road and
[1:02:34] see a sign that says five miles of
[1:02:35] jeffersonville that isn't jeffersonville
[1:02:37] that's a sign to show you you're on the
[1:02:38] right road
[1:02:40] so see when brother ram would use his
[1:02:42] gifts that was a sign to show you
[1:02:44] you're on the right road to believe amen
[1:02:48] right but just because the gift operates
[1:02:51] doesn't mean that person is going to
[1:02:53] believe it in other words
[1:02:55] just because god shows you something a
[1:02:57] dream that doesn't mean you're going to
[1:02:58] believe it
[1:02:59] you've still got to believe it amen
[1:03:03] word god's word is laying right here but
[1:03:06] you've still got to believe it amen
[1:03:08] you've got to believe it for yourself
[1:03:10] you've got to take it and possess it and
[1:03:11] say yes
[1:03:12] it's mine i'm not going to doubt it i'm
[1:03:14] going to accept it praise god
[1:03:17] same thing you gotta believe it yourself
[1:03:20] and this poor sick
[1:03:21] crippled world is waiting for
[1:03:22] deliverance so it's waiting for the
[1:03:23] commission
[1:03:24] but they're looking at a signpost have
[1:03:27] mercy the signpost is nothing but a sign
[1:03:29] to prove the commission
[1:03:30] there's a new ministry it's just been
[1:03:31] revealed to me pray for the sake get the
[1:03:33] people to believe you
[1:03:34] god can never leave that but i'm ready
[1:03:36] to leave this mountain i
[1:03:37] want to grow across jordan i want to
[1:03:40] carry the commission
[1:03:41] what are you saying brother brandon it's
[1:03:42] 1960 what are you saying you fail with
[1:03:45] the signpost
[1:03:46] well just hang on he's going to explain
[1:03:48] it
[1:03:49] he puts too much emphasis on the sign
[1:03:52] itself
[1:03:54] okay and then and you can listen to this
[1:03:55] this is nothing new it's been laying
[1:03:57] there on the tapes all these years
[1:03:59] i just think it's a good time for us to
[1:04:01] go over now don't you
[1:04:07] and another woman said now here's
[1:04:08] brother i'm giving a woman to
[1:04:09] discernment
[1:04:10] she said my back i've got back trouble
[1:04:12] they they can't find what it done
[1:04:14] brother branham said you believe me to
[1:04:15] be his prophet she said i do
[1:04:17] now he sees a vision what happened back
[1:04:19] yonder in the early month of june
[1:04:21] they're trying to work on you trying to
[1:04:22] operate for a slip vertebra she had a
[1:04:24] slip vertebra
[1:04:26] it's not so it's a i'm sorry they
[1:04:27] thought it was a subvert
[1:04:29] vertebra it's not it's a pinched nerve
[1:04:31] you got it by lifting the load when you
[1:04:33] work for mcspadden's market
[1:04:35] she said i remember when it was done i
[1:04:37] remember it now that
[1:04:38] doesn't heal her now look here's a woman
[1:04:41] she don't know why she got back trouble
[1:04:42] brother ram sees a vision and said you
[1:04:44] got it when you were lifting something
[1:04:46] but man said that secret doesn't heal
[1:04:48] her it only points to the fact she needs
[1:04:50] to believe
[1:04:51] amen right quit leaning on the signpost
[1:04:55] let's go on to the city let's get away
[1:04:57] from this mountain
[1:04:58] let's get to the city let's cross jordan
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:01] amen praise god there's nothing wrong
[1:05:04] with the gifts
[1:05:05] but we can't lean upon the gift more
[1:05:08] than the promise more than the
[1:05:09] commission praise god
[1:05:12] i hope it'll be clear to you i think
[1:05:13] it'll be clear as we go on brother
[1:05:15] said i've wrung so now he said i failed
[1:05:17] now he says i've
[1:05:19] done wrong that's why i base these
[1:05:21] sermons the way i have
[1:05:23] brother branham preached these sermons
[1:05:24] to show people that he'd made a mistake
[1:05:27] yet god never left him amen hallelujah
[1:05:29] praise god amen
[1:05:31] you can be a true servant of god you can
[1:05:33] be a true man or woman of god
[1:05:34] and make a mistake but god's not going
[1:05:36] to throw you away god wants to teach you
[1:05:38] god wants you to make he wants to make
[1:05:40] you more like jesus
[1:05:41] amen the only way to do that the only
[1:05:44] way to learn obedience is through what
[1:05:46] suffering you got to suffer and say oh
[1:05:50] i failed i'm a i'm a failure i made a
[1:05:52] mistake and what does that make you do
[1:05:53] brother amen it makes you lean on the
[1:05:55] lord more
[1:05:56] right when you make a mistake and you
[1:05:59] embarrass
[1:06:00] jesus or you embarrass the church or you
[1:06:02] make a disgrace
[1:06:03] that makes you say next time i'm going
[1:06:04] to pray more or next time
[1:06:06] i'm not going to speak that until i know
[1:06:07] for sure i'm going to make sure it's
[1:06:09] god's will
[1:06:10] i'm going to lean on the everlasting
[1:06:12] arms amen
[1:06:15] see failures are important for us to
[1:06:17] learn from our mistakes
[1:06:18] so we lean on jesus we trust him more
[1:06:21] we wait on him before we do anything
[1:06:27] he said because he said as i was with
[1:06:28] moses so i'll be with you and when that
[1:06:30] hand come down and pointed that very
[1:06:31] same scripture remember the holy spirit
[1:06:33] came down and pointed to joshua one
[1:06:35] one through nine that was the holy
[1:06:37] spirit time brother ma'am you've got to
[1:06:38] cross over in the third pole
[1:06:42] the first bolt second bowl but you've
[1:06:44] got to cross over in that third pole
[1:06:46] speaking the word all right revealing
[1:06:49] the word amen
[1:06:50] preaching to the eternal loss amen which
[1:06:52] might be fulfilled by us
[1:06:56] for a long time i've wondered because i
[1:06:57] didn't know what the commission was i've
[1:06:59] looked for something supernatural beyond
[1:07:01] that
[1:07:01] god cannot get away from his commission
[1:07:03] god give the commission
[1:07:04] that's what it must remain but all the
[1:07:06] penalties also people like signs they
[1:07:08] like to see it
[1:07:09] the bible said a wicked indulger's
[1:07:11] generation seeks after signs
[1:07:13] but the commission was pray for the sick
[1:07:15] and tens of thousands times thousands
[1:07:17] that i prayed for
[1:07:18] or failed to pray for yeah here it is
[1:07:21] because they all desired the sign they
[1:07:24] all desire
[1:07:25] so what did brother brown fail and he
[1:07:27] didn't pray for enough people
[1:07:29] because he let each person pull out
[1:07:33] the gift of his discernment in the
[1:07:34] prayer line and it sapped his strength
[1:07:37] so much
[1:07:37] after five or six or seven or eight of
[1:07:39] those he couldn't pray for anybody else
[1:07:41] my brother
[1:07:42] said that's where i failed
[1:07:46] now does that help anybody by god's
[1:07:47] grace he says i'm wrong i've failed i'm
[1:07:50] a failure i've done all these things
[1:07:52] yet did god did god discern those people
[1:07:54] yes
[1:07:55] did some people get healed yes but not
[1:07:57] as many people got prayed for
[1:07:59] as god would have liked and you're going
[1:08:01] to see in the quote here the angel lord
[1:08:02] says you've done wrong
[1:08:04] you should have prayed for more you
[1:08:05] cause all this carnal impersonation
[1:08:09] and yet was it still was he still a holy
[1:08:11] ghost-filled saint
[1:08:12] yes yes right confessing his sin filled
[1:08:15] with the holy spirit of god
[1:08:16] no condemnation right in heaven none in
[1:08:19] heaven
[1:08:20] but he had to learn on the earth how to
[1:08:22] operate his gifts the right way
[1:08:26] see not everybody got prayed for that
[1:08:29] should have got prayed for
[1:08:31] now you know church we love brother
[1:08:33] branham here we're not making any him
[1:08:35] look we're just
[1:08:35] we just we're just being honest we're
[1:08:38] just showing him
[1:08:39] as an example that he failed god at
[1:08:41] times but god was with him
[1:08:43] never forsook him and so this is to
[1:08:45] encourage us that if we make a mistake
[1:08:47] and it might be for a long time
[1:08:49] you're going to see the quotes here 12
[1:08:51] or 14 years
[1:08:54] he said but i'm ready to leave this
[1:08:56] mountain i'm ready to
[1:08:59] praise god people can make mistakes
[1:09:03] 10 15 we'll say like this 20 years and
[1:09:06] they might even
[1:09:07] they might even be genuine holy
[1:09:08] ghost-filled saints
[1:09:10] but god is allowing them here to work
[1:09:12] out their own salvation with fear and
[1:09:14] trembling
[1:09:14] so that they'll learn to be a better
[1:09:16] servant of god
[1:09:20] the other day i was trying to work the
[1:09:21] ministry got into the room a man coming
[1:09:23] to the plot
[1:09:23] platform said now brother brandon wait a
[1:09:24] minute my case is different i just got
[1:09:26] to know something now here's an example
[1:09:28] was what brother branham would say a man
[1:09:30] will come up and say pray for me
[1:09:32] and he said i'm not leaving until you
[1:09:33] give me a discernment a vision well
[1:09:36] what's he going to do brother ram said
[1:09:39] he would cater them he would say okay
[1:09:41] i'll wait here until god sends me a
[1:09:42] vision but he should not have done that
[1:09:45] he was what he says later
[1:09:48] i said well doctor the doctor can
[1:09:49] examine you oh no i don't want that i
[1:09:51] want to know right now
[1:09:52] my case is so different look at that
[1:09:55] look how can i say like this look how
[1:09:57] carnal spiritual people can be
[1:10:00] are you with me they're they're so
[1:10:02] carnal they think
[1:10:03] uh they they think they've got to have a
[1:10:05] sign i've got to see a sign poster
[1:10:08] i got to have a signpost now to make
[1:10:09] sure i'm going to arrive at akron
[1:10:12] we shouldn't have to say that right we
[1:10:14] should know we know the way to akron
[1:10:16] we're going to arrive there we don't
[1:10:17] have to have a signpost because he
[1:10:19] already promised me to make it amen
[1:10:22] i've already had promises right i've
[1:10:24] already seen the other signposts
[1:10:26] but see people get so carnal i've got to
[1:10:28] have a sign i've got to feel something
[1:10:30] oh my help us lord i've got to see
[1:10:33] something i've got to feel something
[1:10:34] i've got to
[1:10:35] somebody's got to do something now
[1:10:37] there's nothing wrong if
[1:10:39] you're if we're all gideons not your i'm
[1:10:41] a gideon
[1:10:42] we're all gideons there's all times we
[1:10:45] need a sign
[1:10:45] but we've got to learn by the holy
[1:10:47] spirit at times just to accept the word
[1:10:50] and go forth and believe it amen
[1:10:53] but this man says no i've got you've
[1:10:55] you've got to give me a vision
[1:10:57] he says well i don't want he said uh
[1:11:00] he said well praise the lord that's
[1:11:01] right he said the rest of you come on
[1:11:03] and let me pray for you
[1:11:04] when i did that you know what the next
[1:11:05] one said then the next person just
[1:11:08] didn't want brother man to pray for him
[1:11:09] the next person wanted
[1:11:10] another vision he said because my case
[1:11:13] is just as important as his
[1:11:14] well if he got a vision i want a vision
[1:11:16] too
[1:11:20] he said and then when i got to about six
[1:11:22] or eight of these the meeting
[1:11:23] it like to killed me now brother brahm
[1:11:26] admits in this sermon
[1:11:27] that wasn't god's will god doesn't want
[1:11:30] his servants to be almost dying at the
[1:11:32] paul
[1:11:32] at the platform in other words brother
[1:11:36] should not have set them all up in order
[1:11:37] brother branham should have preached the
[1:11:39] word
[1:11:39] and then just pray for them quickly and
[1:11:42] he says it later
[1:11:43] just pray for them quickly let them pass
[1:11:44] through and then when god would send a
[1:11:46] vision
[1:11:48] then he should have told the vision of
[1:11:49] that person but he just should have made
[1:11:50] sure he prayed for all the people
[1:11:52] if you listen to perfect faith 1963
[1:11:55] you'll see him doing this
[1:11:56] he said it don't have to be a a vision
[1:11:58] every time you just have to believe
[1:12:00] god's word every time amen
[1:12:03] he says just let him pass through the
[1:12:04] prayer line just pray for the sick
[1:12:06] that's the commission
[1:12:07] pray for the sick get them to believe
[1:12:08] and they'll receive the healing if
[1:12:10] they've got genuine faith
[1:12:12] but every person's got to have a sign
[1:12:15] every person's got to have a feeling
[1:12:17] every person's got to have something
[1:12:18] they can touch or feel or something
[1:12:20] supernatural
[1:12:23] rather than just faith
[1:12:27] he said i've always wondered why that
[1:12:28] would do that to me is because
[1:12:30] i was doing it wrong let me say like
[1:12:33] this
[1:12:33] when preachers wear themselves out and
[1:12:36] they almost go crazy or they get a
[1:12:38] mental problem
[1:12:39] it's their fault right
[1:12:42] brother man made that statement he said
[1:12:44] i'd rather wear out than rust out but he
[1:12:46] said the holy spirit told him later
[1:12:48] that's he can't do that because he is
[1:12:50] going to wear himself out
[1:12:52] right so you get like remember that
[1:12:54] quote we showed a few months ago you got
[1:12:55] to take care of god's man amen
[1:12:59] give the man some rest praise god give
[1:13:00] the man a little bit of time to sleep
[1:13:02] right let him sleep in let him get some
[1:13:04] rest let this let the daughter of god
[1:13:05] get some rest amen so brother man was
[1:13:09] he's basically
[1:13:10] hurting himself by letting each person
[1:13:12] pull
[1:13:13] a vision out of him through his gift
[1:13:16] he said that's just the signpost post
[1:13:18] pointing the commission it's not the
[1:13:19] commission
[1:13:20] hundreds have passed over the platform
[1:13:22] without receiving
[1:13:24] anything i just prayed for them
[1:13:27] it's right back on the people if you
[1:13:28] will believe
[1:13:30] see the commission was given
[1:13:34] that's the original the signposts had
[1:13:35] been produced now if you can believe
[1:13:37] that
[1:13:37] if you will believe that god sent me
[1:13:38] into the world to pray for the sick
[1:13:40] people i'll be able to pray the prayer
[1:13:41] faith for you that's the only way it can
[1:13:43] be done god can never get away from his
[1:13:45] commission i
[1:13:46] failed him i've here about 14 years with
[1:13:49] nothing but straight
[1:13:50] discernment i failed him because i
[1:13:53] haven't prayed for more people
[1:13:56] i was using the gift in a way that i
[1:13:57] thought was the right way
[1:13:59] but it wasn't the right way around and
[1:14:01] around the world till tens of thousands
[1:14:03] a million cases i guess
[1:14:04] i asked you one thing did never fail no
[1:14:06] sir if the signpost won't fail how much
[1:14:08] more will the commission never fail
[1:14:11] if the sign that's the minor part if the
[1:14:13] sign point of the city
[1:14:14] if it doesn't fail to tell you the
[1:14:15] city's there how much more will the city
[1:14:17] be there when you come
[1:14:19] there's the commission amen now my
[1:14:21] ministry is changing it's already
[1:14:23] changed
[1:14:24] there will still be discernment they'll
[1:14:25] still carry on just as i feel that god
[1:14:27] wants me to say
[1:14:28] but until then i'll pray and lay hands
[1:14:30] on the sick as he told me
[1:14:31] to do and carry out my commission i
[1:14:33] waited a long time for this
[1:14:34] but i believe now that we're ready to
[1:14:36] take the promised land he's already born
[1:14:38] again
[1:14:39] right but this is the application of his
[1:14:41] ministry
[1:14:42] his ministry's got the crossover amen
[1:14:45] his ministry's calling to the first bowl
[1:14:47] the second full but he's got to get into
[1:14:49] the next phase
[1:14:50] the last phase of his ministry praise
[1:14:52] god
[1:14:54] and just as sure as there will be
[1:14:56] there'll be some rahab waiting
[1:14:57] there'll be someone waiting that'll
[1:14:59] believe it with all their heart maybe we
[1:15:00] looked at that on a few wednesday nights
[1:15:01] ago
[1:15:02] what's the beauty of rahab the beauty of
[1:15:04] rahab is she never saw moses do one
[1:15:06] miracle
[1:15:07] amen hallelujah she never uh she never
[1:15:10] saw the staff
[1:15:11] turn the surface said oh i believe all
[1:15:13] she did was here
[1:15:14] all she did was hear about there's a
[1:15:16] mighty god there's an army rising up
[1:15:18] there's an army coming over here and i
[1:15:21] believe there's a living god
[1:15:22] and she believed all she did was believe
[1:15:25] and the bible said faith comes by
[1:15:27] hearing amen
[1:15:29] that's what god wants us today he just
[1:15:31] wants us to hear the word
[1:15:33] and accept the revelation that god will
[1:15:35] keep his promise amen
[1:15:38] that's why that's what brother i'm
[1:15:39] saying i need some rahabs in my ministry
[1:15:41] not that they got us not somebody i just
[1:15:43] i got to see a vision i got to feel
[1:15:45] something
[1:15:45] i got to hear something just somebody
[1:15:47] that believes god
[1:15:49] and loves god and knows god cannot fail
[1:15:51] amen
[1:15:52] amen hallelujah now
[1:15:55] now look here again i've leaned heavy
[1:15:59] on the signpost myself lord you show me
[1:16:02] about this before i pray for them
[1:16:05] here he is here he is confessing his
[1:16:06] wrongs i'm not going to pray for
[1:16:09] somebody until i know
[1:16:10] more secrets about them that was wrong
[1:16:13] brother graham says that was wrong
[1:16:16] now look what he says now look at this
[1:16:17] church i told you these words right
[1:16:20] because i don't know what i might do how
[1:16:22] cruel that
[1:16:23] was i asked the congregation to forgive
[1:16:26] me
[1:16:27] how cruel a man of god
[1:16:31] how cruel that's what brother branham
[1:16:33] says
[1:16:34] because he would focus too much
[1:16:36] attention on this one person
[1:16:37] when he's going to say it out there
[1:16:39] there was hundreds of sick people
[1:16:41] that needed his prayers but because he
[1:16:43] was misusing his gift and trying to make
[1:16:45] sure
[1:16:46] before i pray i don't know if god's
[1:16:47] gonna hear my prayer the angel told him
[1:16:49] god would hear his prayer right
[1:16:51] the angel had already told him and
[1:16:52] commissioned him if you can get them to
[1:16:54] believe
[1:16:54] nothing will stand before your prayer
[1:16:57] but it's like every service he was just
[1:16:58] trying to trying to get
[1:17:00] everybody to believe instead of focusing
[1:17:02] on the commission
[1:17:03] that if you preach the word and if
[1:17:04] they've heard the word then faith will
[1:17:06] come by hearing the word of god
[1:17:10] amen i hope this isn't shocking anybody
[1:17:11] too bad does anybody feel like they've
[1:17:13] been shocked this morning
[1:17:15] hope evan hope i haven't shocked anybody
[1:17:17] too bad
[1:17:18] how cruel was brother branham now
[1:17:21] according to his words
[1:17:22] from 1948 to 1960 he says how cruel i
[1:17:26] was
[1:17:27] praying for a few people rather than for
[1:17:30] praying
[1:17:31] for hundreds if not thousands more
[1:17:34] now is he forgiven absolutely
[1:17:37] but he made a mistake did god ever leave
[1:17:41] him
[1:17:41] no absolutely not how do you know
[1:17:44] because all the way down to 1965 before
[1:17:46] he passed away
[1:17:47] god was still giving him thus saith the
[1:17:49] lord about marriage and divorce amen
[1:17:51] let's say the lord about who's this
[1:17:52] melchizedek all these
[1:17:54] thus ate the lord and then the monk
[1:17:56] before he died for the amen god healed
[1:17:57] him of that stomach condition
[1:18:00] every seven years it would come back
[1:18:02] every seven years and then finally right
[1:18:04] there in november of 1965
[1:18:06] he said i've seen it god delivered me
[1:18:08] that that raccoon ran out of me or
[1:18:10] whatever it was that squirrel whatever
[1:18:11] it was it ran out of me
[1:18:13] i'm free and god's healing came on the
[1:18:15] wings of a snow white dove
[1:18:17] the holy spirit kept his promise healed
[1:18:20] him never left him
[1:18:21] our god is faithful amen amen god never
[1:18:24] left him
[1:18:26] amen god god he can imagine god healed
[1:18:29] him a month before he died
[1:18:30] he only got to enjoy that healing for a
[1:18:32] month hey amen
[1:18:34] but it wasn't showing it's showing god's
[1:18:36] gonna finish what he started praise god
[1:18:38] i said i'll say like this when he passed
[1:18:40] over he got the rehealing anyway
[1:18:42] he got the real healing he got a new
[1:18:44] theophany hey
[1:18:45] hallelujah a new body amen a glorifies a
[1:18:48] theophany body
[1:18:50] a word body praise god no more pain no
[1:18:53] more suffering that was the real healing
[1:18:54] praise god
[1:18:58] how cruel i was i asked the congregation
[1:19:00] to forgive me the
[1:19:01] congregations of this world that's
[1:19:02] listening on the tape forgive me i was
[1:19:04] wrong
[1:19:04] i should have never carried out like
[1:19:05] that that was his commission that wasn't
[1:19:07] his commission in the first place
[1:19:08] that was a sign pointing the commission
[1:19:10] i should have prayed for the sick
[1:19:12] everywhere instead of just these five
[1:19:14] six or seven or eight on the platform
[1:19:18] now see it's right back to the laps of
[1:19:19] the people see brother he says it see
[1:19:21] god
[1:19:22] wanted everybody just to believe not
[1:19:24] just eight people to believe
[1:19:26] all right does everybody understand that
[1:19:27] by god's grace if he would discern their
[1:19:29] hearts then they would believe well well
[1:19:31] that's good but that's only eight people
[1:19:33] instead of hundreds or thousands of
[1:19:35] people god wanted thousands to believe
[1:19:38] not just eight
[1:19:42] see it's right back in the laps of the
[1:19:44] people if you will believe
[1:19:45] that god commission is to be done here
[1:19:47] it is in the word it's exactly what the
[1:19:49] word
[1:19:49] the commission that i say now here's an
[1:19:51] example
[1:19:53] that he gives in the sermon he gives
[1:19:55] this sermon a crippled girl can you
[1:19:57] imagine this this is what this is why
[1:19:58] brother graham said it was so cruel
[1:20:00] a crippled girl is trying to crawl up to
[1:20:03] the prayer line
[1:20:04] but the ushers keep pushing her back and
[1:20:07] she doesn't get prayed for because
[1:20:09] brother brahm
[1:20:10] prayed for the four or five people or
[1:20:11] six whatever and then he couldn't pray
[1:20:13] for any more
[1:20:14] this is what this is the example so the
[1:20:16] example of him being cruel is
[1:20:18] he didn't get to pray for other sick
[1:20:19] people
[1:20:21] he said uh he said surely there's some
[1:20:24] other way besides this
[1:20:25] and brother moore brother moore was a
[1:20:26] preacher there was a poor little girl
[1:20:28] crawling up to the building crippled
[1:20:30] poor little thing
[1:20:30] trying to get up to where i was i looked
[1:20:32] down at the child and stared
[1:20:34] started crying well they couldn't bring
[1:20:36] her in the line she didn't have a prayer
[1:20:37] card
[1:20:38] not knowing that was the child's last
[1:20:40] night it was her last night at the
[1:20:41] meeting
[1:20:42] to try to get up and get healed and
[1:20:45] brother moore
[1:20:46] and them helped her out to get out of
[1:20:48] the line she was trying to
[1:20:49] can you imagine a little girl trying to
[1:20:50] get through to the line and the ushers
[1:20:52] take her back because you don't have a
[1:20:53] prayer card
[1:20:56] the next day we sat and talked over he
[1:20:58] said brother graham that hurt me
[1:21:00] i said hurt you what do you think it had
[1:21:02] done to me
[1:21:04] so brother moore was sad this little
[1:21:05] crippled girl crawled up here didn't get
[1:21:08] prayed for he said brother
[1:21:09] that hurt me he said it hurt me more
[1:21:13] see a crippled little girl that stuck
[1:21:14] with me that's been about 10 years ago a
[1:21:16] little crippled girl over there in
[1:21:17] illinois late
[1:21:18] little blackhead brown eyes crawling a
[1:21:20] little polio girl trying to get up to
[1:21:21] where i was at
[1:21:22] and the ushers down there had to help
[1:21:23] her and set her back in the seat crawled
[1:21:25] out of
[1:21:26] her seat to help her get up there why
[1:21:28] you can only take so many
[1:21:29] and if i'd cut some of them out put her
[1:21:31] in there without a prayer card others
[1:21:32] would have hurt their feelings or have
[1:21:34] their
[1:21:34] feelings hurt see that's right couldn't
[1:21:36] do it i said surely there's some other
[1:21:38] way
[1:21:38] wish i'd have known then what i know now
[1:21:41] things would be different it sure
[1:21:43] would have been different now let's not
[1:21:46] don't let the brother brand because how
[1:21:48] many people have you neglected to pray
[1:21:49] for
[1:21:50] how many times have you said yeah i'll
[1:21:52] pray for you sure i'll keep that in
[1:21:54] prayer but you don't keep it in prayer
[1:21:56] are you with me church that's not i'm
[1:21:59] not sharing with this with you to get
[1:22:00] upset with brother abraham
[1:22:01] i'm showing you he was a man right he
[1:22:04] was trying
[1:22:04] he was trying to understand the signpost
[1:22:07] and the commission
[1:22:08] and he made mistakes but god never left
[1:22:11] him
[1:22:12] god still loved him god so forgive him
[1:22:14] he was still god's eliezer amen
[1:22:17] to get abroad ready for isaac amen
[1:22:23] and though the thing is that people
[1:22:24] today can we say like this
[1:22:26] haters today you've ever people call
[1:22:28] them haters
[1:22:30] the crit the criticizers today of
[1:22:32] brother branham have no idea what it's
[1:22:33] like to have
[1:22:34] thousands and hundreds of thousands of
[1:22:36] people come into a meeting and
[1:22:37] have faith in your prayers they've never
[1:22:39] even gone to meetings like that
[1:22:41] they have no idea the pressure that's on
[1:22:43] them right the pressure that was on
[1:22:44] brother abraham
[1:22:45] they have no idea so they they they
[1:22:47] criticize and judge brother branham when
[1:22:49] they have no right to do that because
[1:22:50] they've never walked in issues
[1:22:52] they've never sacrificed like him amen
[1:22:54] they've never prayed like him
[1:22:56] they've never labored like him well see
[1:22:58] we understand that we can give him grace
[1:23:00] because god was with him god forgave him
[1:23:02] god helped him
[1:23:04] god answered his prayer god was with him
[1:23:06] god was in
[1:23:08] praise god see he said things would have
[1:23:10] been different if i'd only
[1:23:12] known then what i know now i would have
[1:23:16] not handed out prayer cards
[1:23:17] he just would have prayed and let the
[1:23:18] people just receive it right there
[1:23:22] ah hallelujah
[1:23:25] now let's get back to here now i'm ready
[1:23:28] to go to jordan this morning i'm ready
[1:23:29] to stand my
[1:23:30] commission i've loved people i've
[1:23:32] catered them so look at this
[1:23:34] brother ram was he was catering to the
[1:23:37] people rather than another than the
[1:23:38] commission
[1:23:40] see he felt bad well this brother wants
[1:23:41] a vision and okay i'll let you pull a
[1:23:44] vision out of me
[1:23:45] but he's going to get tired he's going
[1:23:46] to get weak he was catering to the
[1:23:49] people just like church you remember he
[1:23:50] catered to his mother-in-law you
[1:23:52] remember that
[1:23:53] his mother-in-law said don't you take my
[1:23:55] daughter out there with all that trash
[1:23:57] that pentecostal trash and he catered to
[1:23:59] her for a little while
[1:24:00] i don't remember that remember in south
[1:24:02] africa he catered to the ministers
[1:24:04] he said because i love people so he let
[1:24:07] his human love get in the way of the
[1:24:10] love of god
[1:24:11] and the church said we do the same thing
[1:24:16] i'm going to get to something just a
[1:24:17] little bit just something small i'm
[1:24:18] going to get something in a little bit
[1:24:19] here
[1:24:20] brother man was trying to do he was
[1:24:21] trying to for trying to like force them
[1:24:23] to believe that's kind of
[1:24:25] it's kind of like what he was doing just
[1:24:27] like you and i will try to
[1:24:28] force people to get saved right we're
[1:24:30] trying to force them like with my mom
[1:24:32] when we first got saved
[1:24:34] i tried to like force her to believe
[1:24:37] we were yelling out to go back later and
[1:24:38] apologize i was just like mom
[1:24:42] gave me the message i was really
[1:24:44] immature back boy if i'm immature now
[1:24:45] how much more mature was i back then
[1:24:48] i believe i'm more mature than i was but
[1:24:51] you know
[1:24:51] you you want you want to see people
[1:24:53] believe it so bad right
[1:24:54] you just want to like force them that's
[1:24:56] kind of what brother was doing he was
[1:24:57] just he just wanted everybody just to
[1:24:58] believe
[1:24:59] so much that he would give himself of
[1:25:02] his limited energy give himself there
[1:25:04] but other people lacked
[1:25:06] instead of letting god just send the
[1:25:08] vision right that god's in the vision
[1:25:14] he said i love people i've catered them
[1:25:16] he's he's met me vision after vision
[1:25:18] which i don't have time to tell you know
[1:25:19] it's wrote these books
[1:25:20] he's and the angel said you're catering
[1:25:22] too much to the people to walk with me
[1:25:24] you'll walk alone
[1:25:26] you're putting too much emphasis on
[1:25:28] those signs
[1:25:30] praise god
[1:25:33] i didn't know what the rest of it was
[1:25:35] but the hour didn't come i'm sorry the
[1:25:36] hours come the hours come
[1:25:37] when i seen the hand come down to joshua
[1:25:39] as i was with moses i'll be with you i
[1:25:41] believe it this
[1:25:42] morning from henceforth i serve god in
[1:25:44] my commission he wants
[1:25:47] he can show them to me if he does not
[1:25:49] never will i stand before the people
[1:25:51] trying to let their faith pull something
[1:25:53] out of me
[1:25:54] anymore see he was just standing there
[1:25:57] just pull something out of me pull
[1:25:58] something out of me
[1:25:59] just use me just use me instead of
[1:26:01] saying god you use me
[1:26:04] i hope you understand by god's grace
[1:26:07] i'll pray for the sick i'll commit them
[1:26:08] to god
[1:26:08] let them go if they believe the
[1:26:10] commission ah god is just
[1:26:12] as true he's brought me this far just as
[1:26:14] he did to moses
[1:26:15] to joshua so he hasn't did it the same
[1:26:18] praise god
[1:26:19] see if they believe the bible says lay
[1:26:21] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[1:26:23] if they just believe that they'll get
[1:26:26] amen
[1:26:27] right because god heals about 99 of the
[1:26:29] time doesn't he
[1:26:30] every time you get sick did god heal you
[1:26:31] brother shang
[1:26:34] yeah me too 99 of time
[1:26:37] every time i get sick he heals me every
[1:26:39] time
[1:26:40] and god promised to do that so why do we
[1:26:43] need sometimes another sign
[1:26:45] what we shouldn't have to have it right
[1:26:48] well that's what
[1:26:49] that's what brother brown was doing he
[1:26:50] was giving them extra signs leaning on
[1:26:52] the signpost rather than just saying
[1:26:54] keep going
[1:26:54] you're on the road to akron praise god
[1:26:57] you're on the road to your destination
[1:26:59] you will be healed just keep going keep
[1:27:01] marching towards zion amen
[1:27:04] my humble prayers god forgive me let me
[1:27:06] rise and try again help me lord
[1:27:08] let me lead this people and stand the
[1:27:10] word so we can go up to jordan go in the
[1:27:11] promised land where the great ransom
[1:27:13] church of god will be saved and sin no
[1:27:15] more
[1:27:15] that's my desire this morning believe it
[1:27:17] and live believe it healed
[1:27:18] believe it and be healed i speak to you
[1:27:20] in the name of the lord let us pray
[1:27:21] believe it live like this is after the
[1:27:23] prayer
[1:27:24] now look believe and get well i can't
[1:27:26] make no one believe it
[1:27:27] you have to believe it yourself so see
[1:27:29] when brother and was standing there he
[1:27:30] was just like trying to get them to
[1:27:32] believe
[1:27:32] just believe just so he's letting
[1:27:34] himself be the gift be used
[1:27:37] on one person rather than on hundreds if
[1:27:40] not thousands
[1:27:42] see that's what i was saying earlier he
[1:27:43] was just like trying to just force them
[1:27:45] to believe just
[1:27:46] give them every single every single
[1:27:49] uh clue and proof that they're gonna be
[1:27:51] healed
[1:27:52] rather than just letting them believe
[1:27:54] the promise that god had given them
[1:27:56] now i hope you're feeling pretty good
[1:27:58] about your next healing everybody
[1:27:59] feeling pretty good about your next
[1:28:00] healing next time you get sick
[1:28:02] god promised he said by the stripes of
[1:28:05] jesus
[1:28:05] i'm healed praise god and if our faith
[1:28:09] is
[1:28:10] strong enough in the word we won't need
[1:28:12] anything else we'll just need the
[1:28:13] promise amen

[1:30:49] church and

[1:30:53] home church family
[1:30:55] that all this pornography all this lust
[1:30:57] it'll just all flow
[1:30:58] it'll all blow away praise god amen
[1:31:01] if you go to the house of god and start
[1:31:03] loving god's people
[1:31:04] and serving them and having bible
[1:31:06] studies and more church all the time
[1:31:07] all these things are going to fly

[1:31:15] amen
[1:31:17] now it's up to him now if he'll do it i
[1:31:18] gave him a minister's number up there in
[1:31:20] canada
[1:31:21] i said bleed in all caps i said please
[1:31:23] please
[1:31:25] call that brother and get a home church
[1:31:27] you're never going to defeat satan
[1:31:28] without the body of christ
[1:31:31] never you won't do it
[1:31:36] remember you can only be saved so he's
[1:31:37] getting into your personal faith
[1:31:39] you can only be healed by your personal
[1:31:41] faith see the signpost the fact that
[1:31:43] there's a sign doesn't make you healed
[1:31:45] you've got to have personal faith that
[1:31:46] jesus is your healer
[1:31:49] right right you have faith well i have
[1:31:50] faith god did a miracle that's or
[1:31:52] god discerned that's good but you've got
[1:31:54] to have also faith in god's promise that
[1:31:56] you're seeking
[1:32:00] look at this i preached the word for 12
[1:32:02] years you've confirmed that around the
[1:32:03] world
[1:32:04] i've had forgiveness and i know that i
[1:32:05] did not do it willfully it's because i
[1:32:07] thought i was doing right
[1:32:09] 12 years brother johnny 12 14 years he
[1:32:12] was doing it the wrong way
[1:32:14] and yet god still healed people god
[1:32:16] still saved people
[1:32:18] god still strengthened brother branham
[1:32:19] but god eventually corrected his servant
[1:32:22] because every child of god must be
[1:32:24] corrected
[1:32:28] and then george did you know this
[1:32:32] the angel said because you've done this
[1:32:34] he tried to explain
[1:32:35] he tried to show everybody and explain
[1:32:37] the two signs he tried to explain
[1:32:39] dots he tried to explain the discernment
[1:32:41] and because of that
[1:32:42] people started making up their own and
[1:32:45] we got it today we got
[1:32:46] prophets of their imaginations the bible
[1:32:48] says they just make up stories or like
[1:32:50] one story was this guy today
[1:32:51] or on the video said i went into jesus's
[1:32:53] eye and i saw the future
[1:32:55] and all kinds of i can smell demons and
[1:32:58] this one lady's got pink hair on the
[1:32:59] internet she says jesus takes her to
[1:33:01] heaven every day for a daily vision
[1:33:03] oh it's a bunch of nonsense and she cuts
[1:33:05] her hair like a man all kinds of stuff
[1:33:07] that's nonsense but what are they
[1:33:09] they're prophets of their own
[1:33:11] imagination
[1:33:13] see every action we do has a reaction
[1:33:18] and so the prophet made this mistake and
[1:33:20] the angel said you've caused
[1:33:22] many impersonations just then the one
[1:33:25] who'd been talking with me stepped
[1:33:27] around in front of me
[1:33:28] it was him the angel lord he had his
[1:33:29] hands folded
[1:33:31] he looked at me and said just what i
[1:33:32] told you not to do i said yes that's
[1:33:34] right he said you see the first poll was
[1:33:37] when you just used to put your hands out
[1:33:38] to the people tell them what was their
[1:33:39] trouble
[1:33:40] the second poll was when you know the
[1:33:41] secrets of their heart and instead of
[1:33:43] you keeping that to yourself you tried
[1:33:45] to explain
[1:33:45] all about it and tell people what you
[1:33:47] did and said you didn't know
[1:33:49] anything about it yourself how could you
[1:33:50] explain it now look at that isn't that
[1:33:52] something
[1:33:53] the angel said you you can't explain
[1:33:54] supernatural things and yet you're
[1:33:56] trying to explain supernatural things
[1:33:59] right it's just like you and i are
[1:34:00] trying to explain well how did jesus
[1:34:02] raise from the dead
[1:34:03] well here let me try to explain it well
[1:34:05] the spirit went out of his body
[1:34:07] and then uh you know two days later you
[1:34:09] know it kind of came back in through his
[1:34:11] feet and then well no maybe it went
[1:34:12] right into his
[1:34:14] we don't we we weren't there we're not
[1:34:17] the author of life
[1:34:18] jesus is the author of life amen god's
[1:34:21] the one
[1:34:22] we shouldn't try to explain things we
[1:34:23] don't understand
[1:34:25] but what do you say he said i cater to
[1:34:27] the people so much
[1:34:30] oh talk about amazing grace
[1:34:34] he and he caused a big bunch of carnal
[1:34:36] impersonations to rise up
[1:34:38] and you see what you've done i said lord
[1:34:40] i'm sorry oh i'm sorry
[1:34:41] i don't know what to do and just then
[1:34:43] this little
[1:34:45] confused the church everybody had a
[1:34:46] sensation everybody had this right down
[1:34:48] in my heart
[1:34:49] god knows the truth i know it wasn't
[1:34:51] right because he told me so see
[1:34:53] it's a false impersonation it's only
[1:34:55] throw the people off so brother madam
[1:35:00] even says
[1:35:01] he knows what he did he tried to explain
[1:35:03] all the supernatural things
[1:35:05] he said that caused a bunch of people
[1:35:07] with pretend sensation
[1:35:10] have real sensations yes but
[1:35:14] and they weren't right with god and they
[1:35:15] took that and brother ham should not
[1:35:17] have explained it
[1:35:18] they took that and tried to create some
[1:35:22] other
[1:35:22] sensation themselves
[1:35:26] now i'm getting back here now i'm going
[1:35:29] to get back to this and i'm going to
[1:35:30] kind of bring it up to
[1:35:31] a new thought so i'm leaving this
[1:35:32] thought now he said what a consolation
[1:35:34] that must have been to joshua when he
[1:35:36] heard god say as i was with moses so
[1:35:38] will i be with you
[1:35:39] although if i'm trying and i fail god
[1:35:41] won't
[1:35:42] leave me he's going to make mistakes
[1:35:46] if he's really divinely called and god's
[1:35:49] in his heart
[1:35:50] he'll rise again amen
[1:35:53] praise god now let's look at your
[1:35:56] thought
[1:35:56] your your position we're here let me
[1:35:58] just see for a moment
[1:36:00] i've already been an hour so let me uh i
[1:36:02] might save that for next sunday here
[1:36:04] yeah i think i'm gonna say that for next
[1:36:06] sunday let's let's close with this so
[1:36:07] yesterday i just called
[1:36:09] this this brother not in our church i
[1:36:10] just called this brother i felt led to
[1:36:12] call him
[1:36:12] and we talked and as we were talking
[1:36:14] about we talked for an hour and a half
[1:36:16] now usually i don't talk to brothers on
[1:36:17] the phone for an hour and a half
[1:36:19] i'm not really a phone talking kind of
[1:36:20] guy
[1:36:23] i just felt led of the holy spirit and
[1:36:24] as i'm talking the discernment started
[1:36:27] working in my life
[1:36:30] and i started saying how coronavirus has
[1:36:32] exposed the spirit of fear on people
[1:36:34] because now they're so scared
[1:36:36] they won't even go to church and
[1:36:39] god knows i wasn't i wasn't trying i
[1:36:42] knew nothing about this
[1:36:43] and the brother said that's exactly what
[1:36:45] i'm battling
[1:36:47] i haven't gone to church for x and x and
[1:36:49] x number of months
[1:36:50] and so right there i said oh i knew that
[1:36:52] was the holy spirit because it discerned
[1:36:54] his life and i didn't
[1:36:55] i didn't know and if he told me before i
[1:36:58] didn't remember
[1:36:59] because i was just and the scripture
[1:37:00] came to my mind in revelation 21 the
[1:37:03] fearful the abominable
[1:37:05] will not inherit the kingdom of god
[1:37:08] so the discernment started operating in
[1:37:10] my land and did another one but i can't
[1:37:12] remember right now another one
[1:37:13] hmm maybe the holy spirit will bring it
[1:37:15] back to me
[1:37:17] so i told that brother i said now unless
[1:37:19] you've got fear i said the only thing
[1:37:21] you got to do
[1:37:21] you've got to be strong and courageous
[1:37:23] that's all you've got to do
[1:37:25] right god all god told joshua was
[1:37:29] you be strong and courageous praise god
[1:37:33] amen amen
[1:37:35] you can either fear back and be a afraid
[1:37:38] and shy
[1:37:39] and nervous about something you can
[1:37:40] either choose to be shy and afraid
[1:37:42] or you can stand up there and walk and
[1:37:45] face it
[1:37:46] face to face and deal with it and not be
[1:37:48] afraid i say
[1:37:49] let's be strong in the lord amen let's
[1:37:52] be strong in the lord
[1:37:54] no matter the situations that arise in
[1:37:56] our lives we have the promise
[1:37:58] that god is never going to forsake us
[1:38:00] amen god's never going to leave me
[1:38:02] brother amen praise god
[1:38:04] as long as i confess my sin i might make
[1:38:06] a mistake here there i might fall short
[1:38:08] of the glory but god's never going to
[1:38:09] leave me
[1:38:10] because he commissioned me to do my
[1:38:12] commission amen
[1:38:13] amen same thing for you god gave you a
[1:38:16] divine commission
[1:38:17] so you've got to fulfill it praise god
[1:38:19] and he'll never leave you
[1:38:21] or forsake you
[1:38:24] now look at this the lord is talking he
[1:38:26] said
[1:38:27] moses is dead he said be strong
[1:38:30] and of a good courage
[1:38:34] for unto this people you'll divide for
[1:38:36] inheritance the land which i swear to
[1:38:37] their fathers
[1:38:38] only be strong and very courageous that
[1:38:41] you observe to do
[1:38:42] according to all the law which moses my
[1:38:44] servant commanded thee
[1:38:46] don't turn to the right or the left that
[1:38:49] you may be
[1:38:49] prosper wherever thou goes amen
[1:38:56] now look the law will not depart out of
[1:38:59] your mouth in other words always talk
[1:39:01] about god
[1:39:03] right meditate there in day out
[1:39:07] i'm sorry day in and night that thou
[1:39:09] mayest observe to do all that's written
[1:39:11] therein
[1:39:12] for them thou shalt make thy way
[1:39:14] prosperous and thou shalt have good
[1:39:16] success the only time the word success
[1:39:18] is used in the entire bible
[1:39:20] they got a big magazine called success
[1:39:22] you ever seen that and they put all the
[1:39:23] millionaires all the billionaires on
[1:39:25] there
[1:39:26] all the prostitute models all the
[1:39:28] prostitute men that are role models the
[1:39:30] actors
[1:39:30] that's not success that's a lie from
[1:39:33] hell
[1:39:33] that's that's destruction praise god
[1:39:35] that's failure
[1:39:36] but real success is speaking the word
[1:39:39] talking the word thinking about the word
[1:39:41] all the time if you do that you'll
[1:39:43] possess the promise of god
[1:39:45] hey man they gotta put us on the front
[1:39:48] of that success magazine one of these
[1:39:49] days
[1:39:50] put the little church in akron that
[1:39:52] little bride
[1:39:54] yes because she's speaking the word
[1:39:56] she's being strong
[1:39:57] she's meditating in the word she's
[1:39:59] loving the word she's a real success
[1:40:01] amen
[1:40:03] no man or woman no demon can stand
[1:40:05] before that woman all the days of her
[1:40:07] life
[1:40:08] amen because she's in the word all the
[1:40:11] way

[1:41:30] he said i've talked to many pastors no
[1:41:32] one's been able to answer this question
[1:41:34] i was just you know i was before you
[1:41:37] came in i was i was singing uh
[1:41:39] i was singing this song i was looking
[1:41:40] out the window i was singing he careth
[1:41:42] for

[1:42:12] ever been able to answer this
[1:42:14] before he said what was jesus doing
[1:42:16] between the time he was 12 and 30.
[1:42:18] was he out in the desert and hiding out
[1:42:20] and doing all kinds of things i looked
[1:42:21] at him i said
[1:42:22] no the bible said he was a carpenter and
[1:42:24] he was learning to submit to his mother
[1:42:26] and father and growing in favor with god
[1:42:29] and with man

[1:42:33] didn't go out the wilderness i said
[1:42:34] after he got the power of the holy ghost
[1:42:36] and he almost cut me off because he
[1:42:37] stuck that thing back in my mouth
[1:42:39] i was just talking about the power of
[1:42:40] the holy ghost
[1:42:43] and he said oh oh then he moved on to

[1:42:47] see we've got the answer to the devil's
[1:42:49] questions praise god
[1:42:51] we got it i like that because god gave
[1:42:52] me just a few opportunities the same
[1:42:54] words there
[1:42:55] and i got to tell him something that no
[1:42:56] one would have been able to tell him
[1:42:58] ever before
[1:42:59] see because the bible says no man will
[1:43:01] be able to stand before you all the days
[1:43:03] of your life
[1:43:05] that's just just a small testimony it
[1:43:06] made me feel good because it when uh
[1:43:08] they brought the question
[1:43:10] all the other preachers didn't have the
[1:43:11] answer because all the other preachers
[1:43:12] didn't know the message
[1:43:14] but we know the message now joshua he
[1:43:17] takes this message with amen
[1:43:19] and he goes talks to his generals he
[1:43:21] says now he says you
[1:43:22] this is all that god's command us we're
[1:43:24] going to do that
[1:43:27] and then and then the the the officers
[1:43:29] answer back to joshua
[1:43:31] and they say whosoever he that rebel
[1:43:33] against the commandment will not hearken
[1:43:35] unto the words and all thou commands him
[1:43:37] and he shall be put to death
[1:43:38] only be strong and of a good courage
[1:43:43] now if you go reading the bible moses
[1:43:45] told joshua the same thing
[1:43:49] moses before he died he said joshua be
[1:43:52] strong and courageous
[1:43:54] so now let's let's look at the order
[1:43:56] before moses died
[1:43:57] joshua was watching him he served him
[1:43:58] and moses looks at him says joshua
[1:44:00] you only be strong and courageous just
[1:44:03] be strong
[1:44:04] a few weeks later moses dies a few
[1:44:06] months later he dies and then god comes
[1:44:08] himself into vision says
[1:44:10] joshua be strong and courageous haven't
[1:44:12] i commanded you
[1:44:13] be strong and courageous and then he he
[1:44:16] takes that
[1:44:17] and he shares it with the people and the
[1:44:19] people say joshua
[1:44:20] we've only got to be strong and
[1:44:22] courageous amen
[1:44:23] in other words everybody is giving him
[1:44:25] the same message all around
[1:44:27] and brother shang you heard it so many
[1:44:29] times he started believing that praise
[1:44:31] god
[1:44:31] amen that's how we are we hear the word
[1:44:33] preach sunday
[1:44:34] after sunday after wednesday and pretty
[1:44:37] soon we start believing it amen
[1:44:39] amen so much so saints that uh he said
[1:44:42] it again in joshua 10
[1:44:44] he's got he's got those five kings on
[1:44:46] the run they lock him in a cave
[1:44:47] he brings them out and he stands he puts
[1:44:50] these these kings on their
[1:44:51] on their faces and he puts his feet on
[1:44:53] their necks and he says listen all you
[1:44:55] army of israel listen he says
[1:44:59] he said come on here listen to me he put
[1:45:01] and he said put your necks on
[1:45:03] put your feet on there next and he said
[1:45:04] don't be afraid nor be dismayed
[1:45:07] be strong and of good courage for thus
[1:45:09] shall the lord god
[1:45:11] do to all your enemies whom ye fight
[1:45:13] praise god
[1:45:15] he got so filled with the power of god
[1:45:17] he started speaking the power of god
[1:45:20] amen and then he experienced it himself
[1:45:23] he was strong and courageous and now you
[1:45:25] guys watch this this is how you do it
[1:45:27] you've got to put the devil
[1:45:28] under your foot praise god don't let the
[1:45:31] devil put you under
[1:45:32] his foot you got to put the devil under
[1:45:34] your foot praise god
[1:45:37] you've got to conquer the devil you got
[1:45:38] to be strong you've got to be courageous
[1:45:41] you're more than a conqueror in christ
[1:45:42] jesus
[1:45:44] amen so what's the order
[1:45:48] how do you get strong brother jess well
[1:45:50] i got a few things for you this is what
[1:45:52] i'm closing with i know
[1:45:52] i'm about an hour hour 15 minutes that's
[1:45:56] not too bad
[1:45:57] the steps in joshua are this first
[1:45:59] remember that god is faithful
[1:46:02] amen if you want to be strong remember
[1:46:04] first god will not fail you
[1:46:06] amen hallelujah he won't fail you he
[1:46:09] promised
[1:46:10] i'll never leave you nor forsake you the
[1:46:13] second step
[1:46:14] is keep all of god's commands i like
[1:46:16] when naomi said that a few seven days
[1:46:17] ago how do you know you got the holy
[1:46:18] ghost i keep all god's commands
[1:46:22] that's exactly right that's what the
[1:46:23] holy spirit told joshua amen
[1:46:25] you keep all the commands i'll be with
[1:46:27] you
[1:46:28] no one will ever stand before you all
[1:46:30] the days of your life
[1:46:32] and then third thing after you keep them
[1:46:33] just talk about it all the time
[1:46:35] share testimonies texts about how's your
[1:46:37] week been in the lord got any good
[1:46:39] victories in the lord what you've been
[1:46:40] reading this week what you've been
[1:46:41] praying about this week
[1:46:42] stay confessing the word of god stay
[1:46:46] meditating upon the word of god and
[1:46:48] you'll be a success
[1:46:50] oh my one more scripture
[1:46:54] get your bibles to go to second
[1:46:57] corinthians 12
[1:46:58] the last one you have my word last one
[1:47:00] second corinthians 12.
[1:47:03] now behind all of this i hate to you
[1:47:05] know i gave you an order there but
[1:47:06] behind all this let me show you what
[1:47:08] comes first
[1:47:09] behind all this
[1:47:18] second corinthians 12. paul had a met a
[1:47:22] buffeting
[1:47:23] devil sent to him allowed by god god
[1:47:26] allowed this
[1:47:27] to keep him humble and he asked three
[1:47:30] times lord can you take this devil away
[1:47:33] so i can see better and the lord said no
[1:47:35] my grace is sufficient in your weakness
[1:47:38] well how did paul become strong verse 9
[1:47:42] he said to me my grace is sufficient for
[1:47:44] thee for my strength is made
[1:47:46] perfect in weakness
[1:47:50] most gladly therefore will i rather
[1:47:51] glory in my infirmities
[1:47:53] that the power of christ may rest upon
[1:47:56] me therefore i take pleasure and
[1:47:59] infirmities and reproaches and
[1:48:00] necessities and persecutions
[1:48:02] in distresses for christ's sake for when
[1:48:04] i am weak
[1:48:05] then i am strong so what's the what's
[1:48:09] really the first thing that has to
[1:48:10] happen
[1:48:11] the first thing is you got to be humble
[1:48:14] and the church said
[1:48:15] amen oh i want to be strong brother
[1:48:16] jesse i want to be courageous so do i
[1:48:19] but the first thing to do is be humble
[1:48:22] realize i'm in a battle i can't i can't
[1:48:25] i can't win this battle myself i have no
[1:48:27] ability i
[1:48:29] defeat the enemy so lord you are my
[1:48:33] you are gonna give me grace to make make
[1:48:36] it through this battle praise god
[1:48:37] and i'm resting the bible said he's
[1:48:39] resting on the power of god
[1:48:42] that's when you're strong praise god
[1:48:44] when we realize we have no ability of
[1:48:46] ourselves
[1:48:47] so we're just resting on the word of god
[1:48:48] god give me the word to say
[1:48:50] give me the give me the prayer to pray
[1:48:52] i'm resting on your power
[1:48:54] and then you remember god's faithfulness
[1:48:56] then you remember his promise
[1:48:58] then you keep all the commands and then
[1:49:00] you speak the word of god
[1:49:03] upon it let's stand our feet musicians
