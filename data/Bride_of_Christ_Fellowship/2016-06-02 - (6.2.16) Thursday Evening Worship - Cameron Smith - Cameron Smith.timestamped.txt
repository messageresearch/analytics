[45:16] again yeah several months ago and i'll
[45:20] tell you i just love Jesus and then he's
[45:23] worth all the sack of all all of all the
[45:28] shortcomings all the failures tonight
[45:47] I'll be honest with you I flat out to
[45:50] have two other directions I was thinking
[45:52] I was going to go and trying to be spray
[45:55] fearful as possible this morning maybe
[45:58] this afternoon sometime Lord just kind
[46:00] of brought this tomb that he wanted me
[46:01] to preach this and I pray that'll be a
[46:03] blessing to you it's a little bit
[46:06] different of a thought I thank God that
[46:09] the Lord is established a mystery here
[46:11] for 10 years by the grace of God view
[46:22] certainly kind of a privilege to be able
[46:24] to share with the Lord is placed on our
[46:26] hearts so if we were might while we
[46:28] remain standing if we'd like to move to
[46:30] our Bibles here I preached a series own
[46:36] on this at home and I will not do it
[46:39] justice in one service compared to what
[46:42] the tree like Lord is revealed to change
[46:44] through it but I say I have a greater
[46:46] understanding of these things and what I
[46:48] previously have and I thank God for that
[46:51] if you have your bottles are going to
[46:52] read three portions of Scripture
[46:53] Galatians 5 verse 1 then we're going to
[46:58] go to acts 10 24 and then acts 15 or
[47:03] little bit of reading but today yet we
[47:07] sure love the Word of God don't ya yes
[47:10] sir Galatians 5 1 says here stand fast
[47:23] therefore in the Liberty wherewith
[47:26] Christ have made us free and be not
[47:30] entangled again with the yoke of bondage
[47:34] and I are going to deal with one of the
[47:39] the major dissensions in the message of
[47:42] that our let's continue acts 1044
[47:50] says here the next 10 44 while Peter yet
[47:53] spake these words under yeah the Holy
[47:56] Ghost fell on all them which heard the
[47:59] word Amen yes familiar with the Bible
[48:02] what's he talking about he's talking
[48:03] about Jen's house here and then this is
[48:05] our introduction yeah the Holy Spirit
[48:09] again I was here thank you Lord for that
[48:12] 45th verse it says and they of the
[48:16] circumcision which believe were
[48:17] astonished as many as came with Peter
[48:20] because that on the Gentiles also was
[48:24] poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost
[48:28] they heard them speak with tongues and
[48:31] magnify God then Peter answered can any
[48:33] man forbid water that these should not
[48:36] be baptized which have received the Holy
[48:39] Ghost as well as a wee they commanded
[48:43] them to be baptized in the name of the
[48:45] Lord they then prayed they him to Terry
[48:48] certain days I bet they did acts 15
[48:51] verse one that will say a word prayer
[48:53] will I have your seats or it says here
[49:04] in certain men which came down from
[49:06] Judea taught the brother and said except
[49:10] he be circumcised after the manner of
[49:12] Moses he cannot be saved a lot of us
[49:17] that our thoughts we say boys this in
[49:19] the Old Testament here it is in the book
[49:20] of Acts let's say a word of Prayer
[49:22] almost precious Lord Jesus Christ how we
[49:25] love you tonight Lord and God is we
[49:27] believe that you've called us here no
[49:30] there's no coincidences with you Lord
[49:31] the footsteps of the righteous are
[49:34] ordered of God or you have certainly set
[49:37] our straight past them for our feet long
[49:39] and or tonight has become before you
[49:41] lord we're longing to hear from you Lord
[49:44] or you don't need the mind of a camp
[49:46] smith you don't need the mind of anyone
[49:48] here Lord you're looking Oh God for us
[49:50] to find your my lord so in that ideal
[49:53] God we submit ourselves unto you O God
[49:56] we say Lord have your way Lord oh god
[49:58] let me not say one word
[49:59] oh my oh god and lord I pray O God in
[50:02] the desire for an expectation for you to
[50:05] preach I pray that the bride and their
[50:07] seats they find that desire that you
[50:09] might preach oh god through the
[50:11] expectation you play through sample I
[50:13] asked o goddess Freyja special movie or
[50:16] skirts tonight oh God we do have a need
[50:18] of you God in such a dark time oh God
[50:21] thank God there is a light it goes Oh
[50:24] God we're a people that are set aside
[50:27] while the sixth seal is breaking oh God
[50:29] and Lord allow us oh god to see the
[50:32] light of this our stress in a way but
[50:34] it's never expressed oh god we just eat
[50:37] your Lord we're thirsting for your word
[50:39] Lord s I trust oh god you'll find all
[50:41] things in the court it's gone the beauty
[50:43] sit in this room God we trailed audience
[50:45] my it from us God forgive us o God oops
[50:48] aside front of them we're all creatures
[50:50] of God that are saved by grace given
[50:52] that verse you did pray for the glory in
[50:55] Jesus Christ's name and the church says
[50:57] and then makes it if we had a title for
[51:08] this evening sermon just something the
[51:11] Lord has brought me to a little thought
[51:13] on I'm going to entitle this message
[51:15] this even coming into the message of the
[51:19] hour and then by the grace of God will
[51:22] make some sense out of this very quickly
[51:24] here brietta in looking at the idea
[51:27] coming into the message of the hour I
[51:30] love that we live in a day where the
[51:33] message of our of the hour has been
[51:34] preached and we know that Noah had a
[51:37] message of his our bows his head a
[51:40] message in his out and what he was
[51:42] always gone since I'm you couldn't put
[51:45] know us that's his phrase our inmost is
[51:47] Damon forgot in a particular message for
[51:51] every one of those days they never but
[51:53] yet they all want it to Christ
[51:56] oh no never see heart that is three
[52:00] level heart safety that they had to get
[52:02] in here then God stay in hoses he gave
[52:06] that lot oh my god Christ when we look
[52:15] at today we gonna dl found a Mexican
[52:22] more interest if not ocean is Roman
[52:25] again looking at the concept God got us
[52:29] to a place that we will see the word for
[52:32] this outside in a book hey Shay tal he
[52:49] look at the fire she's a pillar of fire
[53:05] yes my sister-in-law she painted that
[53:08] picture of brother Graham with the
[53:10] colored barber head and she she could
[53:12] have most of other brands face off and
[53:13] just put the fire on put the pillar of
[53:15] fire on there yeah I look at that I say
[53:18] that right there is a true
[53:20] interpretation 19 hallelujah yeah what
[53:30] by God's face we have found that this is
[53:33] the truth for now they then looking at
[53:39] her title coming into the message of the
[53:41] hour I'd like to get to a different type
[53:44] of a thought uh extremely different for
[53:48] anniversary needs but yet look at the
[53:52] idea
[54:00] you
