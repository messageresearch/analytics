[0:00] I don't think I've ever uh preached out
[0:01] of this text before so I was really I
[0:03] felt inspired I felt
[0:06] uh uh that the Lord had kind of opened
[0:09] this just this very simple thought up to
[0:11] me
[0:14] um so I want to just look at this
[0:16] thought now it's it's a maybe
[0:18] a pretty powerful title or not maybe but
[0:21] uh communion with Christ or devils and
[0:24] uh so you know we want communion with
[0:26] Christ but you know we do have a lot of
[0:28] Mind battles you know sometimes we uh
[0:30] entertain the wrong thoughts and so uh
[0:33] just want to kind of bring it out in
[0:35] that kind of light that we never we want
[0:37] to see it as such an awful thing right
[0:39] we don't want to uh have communion with
[0:41] the Devils we want to have communion
[0:43] with Christ Alone amen yes so it's a
[0:46] hopefully it's a fresh thought here
[0:48] maybe a a fresh look at this text here 2
[0:51] Corinthians
[0:54] 614 want to greet the live streamers God
[0:56] bless them and I just kind of felt a
[0:58] burden to try to get as many sermons out
[1:00] as I can you know I feel like you know
[1:02] uh if we preach God's word it will never
[1:04] return void amen someone will need to
[1:07] hear this sermon praise God someone
[1:08] maybe in this nation or across the
[1:11] sea um God's word cannot return void so
[1:14] the more we put out there then the more
[1:16] needs that you know God can use us to
[1:18] meet by God's grace so amen very simple
[1:20] but just you know just a fresh reminder
[1:21] to
[1:23] me U Second Corinthians 6:14 we'll read
[1:25] that and then we'll have a word of
[1:26] prayer here let's read that on three 1 2
[1:29] 3 be not unequally Yol together with
[1:34] unbelievers for what Fellowship have
[1:36] rightousness with
[1:38] unrighteousness and what communion have

[3:08] so God always brings us through it you
[3:09] know am and uh very very just thankful
[3:12] to have a place uh especially on a hot
[3:14] day like today I'm I'm thankful to have
[3:15] some air conditioning amen right so
[3:19] we're grateful to be here tonight seem
[3:21] like there's something else I want to
[3:22] say some preliminaries but I can't
[3:24] really think of it
[3:29] I don't really think I can think of oh
[3:31] yeah well I want to pray for brother um
[3:33] Brian Hawkins said his son is battling a
[3:35] lot of the same things he suffers with
[3:37] so I don't know if it's Crohn's disease
[3:39] or something like that so we just want
[3:40] to pray at the end we can pray for
[3:44] him um and we have the communion ready I
[3:46] want to thank my wife for making the
[3:48] communion bread honey thank you for
[3:49] doing that I want to thank
[3:54] uh us the better tasting wine so thanks
[3:58] to every
[4:00] last one was pretty
[4:02] good that last one I got was pretty
[4:04] bitter so thank you
[4:06] for the uh better tasted wine hopefully
[4:09] it's better
[4:10] tasted I think it's the same brand at
[4:13] Jewish wine we appreciate that by God's
[4:15] grace the kosher wine so we'll take a
[4:17] moment I am going to set my watch here
[4:19] this time I remembered I didn't remember
[4:20] you know earlier uh today this
[4:23] morning I'll try to set an hour timer
[4:25] and we'll kind of see how that goes
[4:31] um you know our text here was 2
[4:33] Corinthians 6 14 I don't I don't think
[4:37] I've ever preach out of this text before
[4:39] for communion so hopefully it'll be a
[4:40] fresh look at at this text here tonight
[4:43] I thought I would give you the U the
[4:45] definitions of of communion so you had
[4:47] an idea you know we talk about having
[4:49] communion and we talk about having the
[4:51] Lord's
[4:52] supper and so you know supper is
[4:54] basically you know right right having
[4:55] lunch or having I'm sorry having a meal
[4:58] with someone right so that that the
[4:59] imagery that we get here tonight we're
[5:01] having a meal with the Lord we're
[5:03] sitting down at his table how many
[5:04] grateful that his table is is still we
[5:06] can still sit at it hallelujah amen that
[5:09] God invites us to his table right
[5:11] there's a lot of tables you could be at
[5:13] right a lot of places you could go or
[5:15] we're thankful that we can come to God's
[5:17] table Hallelujah and we can Feast with
[5:20] God Almighty it's quite an invitation to
[5:22] be at the Lord's table
[5:24] Hallelujah and so communion means you
[5:26] know Fellowship
[5:27] Association uh joint participation
[5:30] intercourse talking uh I like that word
[5:34] intimacy you know like when you sit down
[5:35] with someone and start talking with them
[5:37] at a table you know or eating you you
[5:39] you often times get their intimate
[5:41] thoughts you know you get you get uh
[5:43] more personal thoughts they could share
[5:45] with you you know that's why you know
[5:47] when you go out to eat you know I like
[5:49] to sit at I like to sit at the table
[5:51] with my wife so I can talk to about some
[5:52] personal things I don't like to be too
[5:54] close to people you know I don't want
[5:55] them to hear my business or hear my
[5:57] thoughts or my prayer requests or you
[5:59] know personal uh things that I'm
[6:01] thinking about I like to have just that
[6:03] communion there uh that
[6:05] intimacy it's a sign or pledge of
[6:09] Fellowship uh so it means uh jointly you
[6:13] know jointly contributed so jointly
[6:16] means two people you know uh both both
[6:18] people at a fellowship or communion
[6:21] participate brother Brandon says you
[6:23] talk to God God talks back to you right
[6:26] brother calls it two fellows in one ship
[6:31] so we want to see that it's joint
[6:34] participation uh you know I think in our
[6:36] lives I think we would be most uh uh
[6:39] we'd be most battling you know us having
[6:41] communion with God God's always ready to
[6:42] talk to us but it's it's us sometimes we
[6:44] don't make enough time to talk to God
[6:46] the church said right you know with
[6:49] maybe we get battled with prayer or you
[6:50] know listening to enough sermons you
[6:52] know to feel close to God where we're uh
[6:54] really strengthened in the word of God
[6:57] and so you know God is always ready for
[7:00] a word to give us God always wants to
[7:02] give us some participation right he
[7:04] wants to give us a word he wants to God
[7:07] always wants to have some intimacy with
[7:08] us isn't that Wonder so wonderful of God
[7:11] he always wants to pour out his heart to
[7:12] us right he always wants to give us a
[7:14] fresh Vision or a fresh Revelation
[7:17] Hallelujah and so we're uh we're we're
[7:20] we're commanded here by God you know to
[7:22] come together and have uh
[7:25] communion but I you know I just want to
[7:27] remind us of this thought you know there
[7:28] lots of people gathering in churches
[7:30] today and you might have been raising
[7:32] them too that they were having more
[7:34] communion with Devils than they were
[7:35] with the Holy Spirit but now remember
[7:38] Church remember balum could have
[7:39] communion with
[7:40] both right Judas for a while had
[7:43] communion with the right one but then he
[7:44] chose the wrong one at the
[7:45] end right so we want to remember that as
[7:47] well you know people that have gifts of
[7:50] God uh you know they can have communion
[7:52] with God sometimes but then sometimes
[7:54] they have communion with
[7:56] Devils so we have to remember that you
[7:58] know some people uh
[8:00] we we know there's questions on their
[8:01] lives right and then and then God might
[8:03] do something great through them well
[8:04] that that's part of their communion yeah
[8:07] but they have communion with both sides
[8:08] may God help us to just have communion
[8:10] with God's side
[8:14] Hallelujah that's the uh that that's the
[8:17] uh that's the deception of the One World
[8:19] Church that's the deception of this
[8:21] Antichrist move the mother Harlot and
[8:24] her do her daughter churches right they
[8:26] have communion with both at times m you
[8:29] know recently you know heard about all I
[8:31] don't know if you heard about all the
[8:32] Benny hin stuff you know this summer but
[8:34] there was numerous people that said hey
[8:35] I got
[8:36] healed I got healed either listening to
[8:38] him I got healed at one of his uh
[8:41] meetings in fact there's a brother in
[8:43] the message who used to go to those and
[8:45] said they were a lot of those things
[8:46] were real now some of them were false
[8:48] like some of the things that came out
[8:49] this summer people didn't get healed or
[8:52] they pretended healings but then you
[8:54] what's interesting is you have people on
[8:55] the other side saying I got healed in
[8:58] there or or you know they'll say uh
[9:00] Reach Out And Touch the TV screen and
[9:02] God will heal you there's people that
[9:04] actually say they got
[9:07] healed so you know you have to remember
[9:10] that some of these things are genuine
[9:11] right the rain falls on the just and the
[9:13] unjust that's right and so you know they
[9:17] they do create the atmosphere they'll
[9:18] create an atmosphere of worship of
[9:21] expectation and so God can anoint them
[9:23] for that per particular moment but then
[9:25] like as you can see sometimes they'll
[9:27] have videos afterwards where people will
[9:29] do drugs right the same and the Bible
[9:33] said Jesus said don't let both come out
[9:35] don't let corrupt communication come out
[9:36] of a good a a good a sister right I'm
[9:39] sorry a good Fountain right don't let
[9:41] evil Waters and good Waters come out of
[9:43] the same Fountain don't let corrupt
[9:45] fruit and good fruit come out of the
[9:46] same tree amen either make the tree good
[9:48] or make the tree corrupt in other words
[9:50] what is Jesus giving he's giving a
[9:52] warning against living in iniquity
[9:54] workers of
[9:56] iniquity so um
[10:00] you know we're thankful we want to have
[10:02] communion with the Holy Spirit and we we
[10:04] of course we know we want our Doctrine
[10:05] to be God's Doctrine uh the doctrine of
[10:08] the Holy Spirit but remember you know
[10:10] the Bible said expressly that in the
[10:12] latter times some shall depart from the
[10:14] faith giving heed that means they open
[10:16] themselves up they start listening to
[10:19] seducing Spirits it sounds so good right
[10:23] uh but it's actually a doctrine of a
[10:26] devil and see what do they do they speak
[10:28] lies in hypocrisy and that actually
[10:30] means a stage player they're just good
[10:33] actors and
[10:35] actresses right they're lying but it
[10:37] looks like they're telling the truth
[10:38] because they're such good actors y yeah
[10:43] right so what does it always come down
[10:45] to brother ad says it comes down to the
[10:47] word
[10:48] test right you you test you know you
[10:50] never you you know everything by their
[10:52] fruit you you test a tree by its fruit
[10:55] you test a person by the word test when
[10:57] it all comes down to the word what do
[10:58] they say about the word amen what are
[11:00] they living about the word
[11:02] hallelujah and see their conscience is
[11:04] seared with the hot iron they can't feel
[11:07] what we feel right they can't feel the
[11:10] same conviction that you feel you know
[11:11] You' feel conviction I'd never go there
[11:13] I'd never say that I'd never do that
[11:15] they can't feel that because their
[11:16] conscience is sear with the hot iron
[11:19] that's how you know they've opened
[11:21] themselves up to demonic Spirit or they
[11:23] have had communion with
[11:26] Devils right and those are just some of
[11:29] the examples I remember I took you
[11:30] through maybe 15 or 20 uh false
[11:33] doctrines that you know a couple years
[11:35] ago were clearly doctrines of devils and
[11:38] one of them was forbid to marry and it's
[11:40] even these people I believe it's even
[11:42] these churches that are saying don't get
[11:44] married because the Rapture is coming
[11:46] soon right because that'll create some
[11:49] type of uh the Bible said it's better to
[11:51] marry than to
[11:53] burn right if if if a person's burning
[11:56] with passions it's better that they get
[11:58] married married then they battle the
[12:01] spirit of
[12:02] lust is that true so you even got to be
[12:05] watching with those type of Ministries
[12:07] that would do something like that try to
[12:09] forbid marriage when God has commanded
[12:11] those things are good yeah and you know
[12:14] of staining from meats you know like I
[12:16] told you recently you know um that
[12:19] person tried to enter into one of these
[12:20] new message churches and tried to bring
[12:22] back legalism I like how he turned it
[12:24] down Paul said I wouldn't give him a
[12:26] space of one hour I wouldn't even give
[12:27] him one hour to spread their lives in
[12:29] our church that's what we need H that's
[12:32] what we all need we all want to we all
[12:33] want to be able to detect that evil
[12:35] spirit and just stop it as soon as we
[12:36] can not welcome here we're not going to
[12:39] talk about
[12:40] this right so I told the brother I said
[12:42] you know just talk to the church there
[12:44] see if anybody was moved by it if
[12:46] anybody's moved by it we'll come in and
[12:47] preach on it but thankfully nobody was
[12:49] moved by they all they all recognize
[12:51] that evil spirit trying to get back
[12:53] in think about that an evil spirit
[12:56] saying oh just don't eat shrimp just
[12:58] don't eat pork you'll be more holy isn't
[13:01] that such a lying Spirit such a seducing
[13:04] Spirit oh because you because any real
[13:07] believer you want to be more holy so it
[13:10] could it could almost seem like oh maybe
[13:14] that's keeping me from my
[13:15] victory maybe that's keeping me from my
[13:17] prayer answered see how that could be a
[13:20] seducing
[13:22] Spirit you know like uh when we come in
[13:25] the message some of our friends they
[13:26] didn't go to college you know because
[13:29] because uh there was a lot of pressure
[13:31] oh there's a lot of trouble in college
[13:32] well there's a lot of trouble on the job
[13:33] too there's a lot of Temptations in
[13:35] college yes there is there's a lot of
[13:37] Temptations on the job too yes and
[13:39] remember my wife reminded me this you're
[13:41] going to be tempted no matter where you
[13:42] are remember I told you that testimony
[13:45] of a former Amish man he had never
[13:47] watched anything on the internet he
[13:48] never even seen the internet he never
[13:50] even seen an evil movie but he was
[13:52] tempted remember to do I'll say it like
[13:55] this beastly things with
[13:57] animals a man
[14:00] do you remember when I told you that
[14:02] that was a good reminder my wife told me
[14:04] about that story so see and brother B
[14:06] tells it you know but said we got our
[14:08] kids in the in the high school he said I
[14:10] wish I could take them up there on the
[14:11] Indian
[14:12] Reservation he said but no matter where
[14:14] you are the sin is going to come out in
[14:17] the person no matter where you
[14:19] are now you want to set your children up
[14:21] you want to set your family up the best
[14:22] that possibly can but remember Satan's
[14:24] like a roaring lion he's prowling around
[14:28] trying to T people so no matter where
[14:31] you are you're going to have to stand up
[14:32] and battle Satan
[14:35] Hallelujah so just something to keep in
[14:37] mind you know you don't willingly put
[14:38] your family or you don't willingly put
[14:40] your your your your yourself in bad
[14:42] situations but you got to remember no
[14:44] matter how much you try to protect
[14:45] yourself the enemy is going to try to
[14:47] slip in somehow amen so I thought that
[14:50] was a a a very good
[14:53] uh a very good thing oh yeah and that
[14:55] brother told me he said he learned that
[14:57] from other Amish people Al so the honest
[15:00] teenagers would kind of joke around
[15:01] about it so see it just passes down
[15:02] through
[15:04] generations you could be totally free
[15:05] from internet totally free from many
[15:07] magazines or anything like that and the
[15:09] things just pass down because Satan's
[15:11] real but he's a genius at his
[15:14] job and you got to be ready to resist
[15:16] him
[15:18] Hallelujah and turn it
[15:22] down and God created all these creatures
[15:24] Hallelujah to be uh received with
[15:26] Thanksgiving to them that know the truth
[15:28] Hal hallelujah
[15:30] amen now uh I read this a few weeks ago
[15:33] and and Peter just gives a master class
[15:35] now they got something today called
[15:37] master classes you know in other words
[15:39] if you want to learn how to do a a
[15:41] YouTube video you can take a master
[15:42] class on that or uh it's sad to say but
[15:45] even Hillary Clinton did a master
[15:47] class no that's not a master class if
[15:50] you ask
[15:50] me but in other words it's just a fun
[15:53] way to say you know this is the best
[15:54] teaching you can get on a topic right
[15:56] and so I want to go there uh let's go
[15:58] there real quick you know second Peter
[15:59] chapter 2 I I will try to read through
[16:01] this quickly there's over 20 attributes
[16:03] I thought Peter taught a Holy Ghost
[16:05] Master Class on false teachers
[16:12] amen verse one but there were also false
[16:14] prophets also among the people even
[16:17] there should be false teachers among you
[16:18] who privately shall bring IND damnable
[16:20] heresies even denying the Lord and see
[16:22] denying the word because the Lord is the
[16:24] word that brought them and bring I'm
[16:27] sorry that brought them and bring upon
[16:28] call themselves Swift
[16:32] destruction okay so notice they're going
[16:33] to bring in heresies and they're going
[16:35] to deny the
[16:37] word and many shall follow their
[16:39] pernicious ways so see that tells us
[16:41] again few there be that find the narrow
[16:43] road most people that go to church will
[16:45] be in false
[16:47] churches many many will be on the broad
[16:51] path and by reason of whom the way of
[16:54] truth shall be evil spoken of I just saw
[16:56] a good man that he's got I mean he seems
[16:57] like a good man on YouTube but he just
[16:59] called William brandom a false prophet
[17:01] all because and this guy's a really good
[17:03] man he can see Benny Hinson he can see
[17:05] all but he can't see the truth about and
[17:07] uh brother Bram because he said
[17:09] trinitarianism is of the devil what a
[17:11] stumbling stone that is to some
[17:13] people three persons in the god three
[17:15] persons in one God that don't it's God
[17:18] is if God is a god he's one person amen
[17:21] How could a God be three persons it goes
[17:23] against any logical sense at all it's
[17:25] illogical
[17:29] but you know they they but they speak
[17:31] evil of the way of truth because they
[17:34] don't understand the truth y now look
[17:38] through covetousness so see this is what
[17:40] false teachers will do they really want
[17:42] something from you covetousness shall
[17:44] they with Fain now that Fain means
[17:46] pretend yeah or hypocrisy with fake
[17:49] words in other words they're faking
[17:50] they're not really sincere they make
[17:53] merchandise of you so see they just want
[17:55] the people's money so they'll do
[17:56] anything to get your money yeah
[18:00] right whose judgment now of a long time
[18:02] linger not and their damnation
[18:04] slumbereth not for God spare not the
[18:06] angels that sin but cast them down to
[18:07] Hell and deliver them into chains of
[18:08] Darkness to be reserved in the judgment
[18:10] and spare not the old world but save
[18:12] Noah the eighth person a preacher of
[18:13] righteousness bringing in the flood upon
[18:16] the world of the ungodly and turning the
[18:19] cities of sod gomorah into ashes condemn
[18:21] them with an overthrow making them an
[18:23] example unto those that should after
[18:25] live
[18:26] ungodly so see we're seeing Moses I'm
[18:28] sorry Noah preached righteously and all
[18:30] these false teachers are teaching
[18:34] unrighteously all right verse 7 and
[18:36] delivered just lot vexed with the filthy
[18:39] conversation of the wicked now I
[18:42] preached this years ago my wife reminded
[18:43] me of this I preached this years ago at
[18:45] least lot was vexed by the
[18:49] homosexuality right a lot of churches
[18:52] today accept
[18:54] homosexuality so it looks like how could
[18:56] they be saved because a lot was at least
[18:59] tormented by
[19:00] it
[19:02] Hallelujah see Church ought to open up
[19:04] our eyes think about the churches some
[19:06] of our friends and family members are in
[19:07] and we need to keep praying for them by
[19:09] God's grace because at least the
[19:11] sodomite things the sodomite things
[19:13] caused him to be vexed it tormented
[19:20] him for that the righteous man dwelling
[19:22] among them in seeing and hearing Vex his
[19:25] righteous soul from day to day with
[19:26] their unlawful Deeds
[19:29] see the evil things we see evil things
[19:32] we hear it should cause us torment we
[19:34] should not like to be around it and I'm
[19:37] really talking about our phones and our
[19:39] tablets I'm really talking about that
[19:40] that's what's going to try to tempt Us
[19:42] in these days yeah right most of you are
[19:44] not going to go into a bar most of you
[19:46] are aren't going to go into a uh you
[19:49] know whatever a brothel you know
[19:52] something awful like that but what's
[19:55] going to get us is Satan's going to he's
[19:56] going to desensitize us to sin
[20:01] right and so we have to make sure the
[20:04] things that we see if they're wrong they
[20:06] should cause us torment if sin is not
[20:08] causing us torment we've officially
[20:12] backslid Hallelujah because even a
[20:15] righteous man was vexed by this he was
[20:17] tormented by this in other words we
[20:20] can't lose our sensitivity to the Holy
[20:22] Spirit
[20:25] right the Lord knoweth how to deliver
[20:27] the ungodly out of tempt oh we should
[20:30] all say Amen to that the Lord knows how
[20:33] to deliver us out of our Temptations
[20:35] hallelujah amen he'll keep he'll run
[20:37] after us and he'll chase us and he'll
[20:39] he'll chase us down until he brings us
[20:41] Deliverance amen amen that's what he did
[20:43] remember he almost dragged out of Sodom
[20:45] remember Angels almost had to drag him
[20:47] out and God may God help us to live like
[20:50] Abraham so God don't have to drag us out
[20:52] of sin conditions
[20:55] amen he's able to reserve the unjust
[20:58] under the day of judgment to be punished
[20:59] but now here back to the false teachers
[21:01] verse 10 but chiefly them that walk
[21:03] after the Flesh in the lust of
[21:05] uncleanness so lust uncleanness they
[21:07] despise government presumptuous are they
[21:10] self-willed they're not afraid to speak
[21:12] evil the dignities be very careful who
[21:14] you're speaking evil
[21:17] against whereas Angels which are greater
[21:19] in power and might bring not raing
[21:20] accusation against them before the Lord
[21:23] again Jude says this Jude and Peter are
[21:25] so similar in their writings it's almost
[21:26] the same type of setup and format and
[21:29] outline remember even Michael wouldn't
[21:31] rebuke I'm sorry even Michael wouldn't
[21:33] bring a railing accusation against Satan
[21:36] he just said the Lord rebuke thee church
[21:38] that's all you got to do when those
[21:38] demons come just say Satan I rebuke
[21:41] you I rebuke you get thou behind me in
[21:44] the name of Jesus Christ hallelujah how
[21:46] many doing it you doing iten you better
[21:49] do it praise God you better do
[21:52] it look at verse 12 but these As Natural
[21:55] BR beasts made to be taken and destroyed
[21:58] speak the things they understand not and
[21:59] shall utterly perish in their own
[22:02] corruption see they're already
[22:04] corrupting spiritually with all their
[22:06] false doctrines their spiritual lives
[22:07] are already corrupting and they speak
[22:09] against our sisters wearing dresses they
[22:11] speak against our sisters not cutting
[22:13] our hair right they speak against our
[22:16] brothers and uh trying to live a holy
[22:18] life and not wear shorts and things like
[22:20] they speak against the things they don't
[22:21] even understand because if they just
[22:23] read the Bible they'd see it's in the
[22:24] Bible
[22:26] Y and yet they keep going deeper in
[22:29] corruption right their lives more
[22:31] corrupted not more holy not more like
[22:34] Christ but corrupting getting broken
[22:36] down right corruption is breaking down
[22:39] uh less looking like it's Li alive it
[22:41] looks more dead all the
[22:43] time all right verse 13 and shall
[22:45] receive the reward of unrighteousness as
[22:47] they count it pleasured uh to right in
[22:50] the daytime spots they are and blemishes
[22:52] sporting themselves with their own
[22:53] deceiving while they Feast with you so
[22:55] see they they're they're deceived that's
[22:58] why they speak against the way of truth
[22:59] they're
[23:00] deceived verse 14 having eyes full of
[23:03] adultery that's why our brothers got to
[23:05] get control over our
[23:07] eyes
[23:09] right because this is an attribute of
[23:11] false prophets right false teachers this
[23:14] is oh good I've never seen it before
[23:16] this is uh this is what lot lot lot
[23:19] wouldn't let his eyes go there right lot
[23:21] was vexed by this even
[23:24] lot but that means everybody else in
[23:27] Sodom it was okay to see all all this
[23:28] adultery or all this sexual
[23:31] sin that cannot cease from
[23:34] sin church we get tempted you know we
[23:36] get tested all these things but we got
[23:38] to bring an end to habitual
[23:41] sin we should not have habitual sins in
[23:44] our lives right if we are we're starting
[23:46] to commune with evil
[23:48] spirits right just in the mind I'm not
[23:50] talking about the soul I'm talking about
[23:52] the Mind
[23:54] mhm they beguile unstable Souls that's
[23:58] what these false teachers do they
[24:00] deceive unstable Souls they're not
[24:02] stable in the word of God Amen in heart
[24:05] they have exercise with Covetous
[24:08] practices curse children these this are
[24:10] the attributes of the the curse group
[24:12] The Serpent seed right ice full of
[24:14] adultery they can't cease from sinning
[24:16] they deceive and beguile they deceive
[24:19] others which have forsaken the right way
[24:23] and have gone astray following the way
[24:25] of balam the son of Boer who loveed the
[24:27] wages of unrighteousness now now we're
[24:29] reminded of this the reality of false
[24:32] teachers and false churches and all
[24:33] these things they love the pleasures of
[24:35] the world more than they love God Amen
[24:39] Paul said they're lovers of Pleasures
[24:41] more than lovers of God they love
[24:43] communion with evil spirits for their
[24:45] own lust rather than communing with God
[24:48] yeah hallelujah amen but he was rebuked
[24:51] for his iniquity the dumb ass speaking
[24:53] with man's voice for bad The Madness of
[24:56] the Prophet there's proof right there
[24:58] any one who's on that side they're
[25:00] insane because the Bible said
[25:03] Madness so most of these people go to
[25:05] these mega churches where they're
[25:06] allowed to live in sin whether
[25:07] homosexuality adultery fornication they
[25:10] are actually insane spiritually y the
[25:13] Bible says it right there and those
[25:15] preachers they're the most insane of all
[25:17] of them because they're getting rich
[25:18] they made merchandise to the people
[25:21] right
[25:24] right oh it's true
[25:29] verse 17 these are wells without water
[25:31] see these preachers they claim to be
[25:33] Wells but they're not really not getting
[25:34] holy water they're getting unclean water
[25:37] right they're getting corrupted water
[25:38] they're getting sistern water yeah
[25:41] clouds that are carried with a tempest
[25:43] to whom the mid of darkness is reserved
[25:46] forever remember the Bible said the same
[25:47] thing in Jude
[25:50] 1:13 these are I think it was yeah it
[25:53] was Kora balum and Cain they've gone the
[25:55] way of Cain they've gone the way of Kora
[25:56] Kora spoke against the anointed Ministry
[25:58] of that day so watch these people that
[26:01] speak against brother R watch them right
[26:04] now we know if they speak against it
[26:06] they can still be saved if they repent
[26:07] like Saul was against David right but he
[26:10] repents at the end and so God can
[26:12] forgive people that are against brother
[26:13] Brandon as long as they repent of it
[26:15] yeah right
[26:18] right Verse 18 for when they speak great
[26:21] swelling words of vanity right like you
[26:24] see you know like some of these Mega
[26:25] preachers oh we're going to get
[26:26] breakthroughs we're going to go up
[26:27] levels you're get promotions they they
[26:30] talk it's all this Prosperity great
[26:31] swelling words but they never even get
[26:33] closer to God they can't even get the
[26:35] right water
[26:36] baptism they can't even get the right
[26:39] justification right they just lead him
[26:41] through a prayer you know say this 30
[26:43] second prayer oh now you're born again
[26:45] now you're filled with the Holy Ghost
[26:46] welcome to the kingdom of God hey let us
[26:47] send us a text let us know you got saved
[26:49] we're going to we're going to share all
[26:50] our data with everybody just prove how
[26:51] many Souls were're saving they ain't
[26:54] saving nobody right that person don't L
[26:57] lay at the altar till they die die out
[26:58] to their sins I doubt they're even
[27:01] saved we've all seen we've all seen
[27:03] people say well I say a prayer I say a
[27:05] prayer and then they go back and they
[27:06] don't even serve God anymore we seen
[27:08] them Austin invited people come in here
[27:10] and they they love claim to serve God
[27:12] but then they leave out how can they do
[27:13] that because they never had a real
[27:16] conversion right great swelling words
[27:19] they Allure through the lust of the
[27:21] flesh through much uh wantonness I can
[27:24] never say wantonness I can never say
[27:26] that word those who were clean from them
[27:28] who live in ER see they continue to live
[27:31] in their heirs they never get to living
[27:34] in Holiness or living in correction
[27:37] right they live in
[27:40] air remember the preachers let them live
[27:43] in the lust of their flesh they let them
[27:46] they let them live in that in other
[27:47] words they're having communion with
[27:49] Devils yet going to church and yet the
[27:52] whole time brother and sister they say
[27:53] I'm communing with Jesus that's what
[27:54] they say the whole time
[27:59] look at verse 19 while they promis them
[28:01] Liberty right oh I'm so free I'm so free
[28:03] like
[28:04] recently a brother in the message shared
[28:06] one of these guys that left the message
[28:07] got a big podcast he comes out and says
[28:09] now one of my favorite uh musicians now
[28:12] is Guns and Roses they were a very a
[28:14] demonic group you know with Wicked rock
[28:17] and roll and see now now they have so
[28:20] much Liberty that they can let these uh
[28:22] musicians in there that worship and and
[28:25] and get their songs from demons they
[28:27] actually say I got my song from demons
[28:29] and now they got that Liberty they don't
[28:31] have Liberty they're they're they're
[28:34] more and I don't I don't say they came
[28:36] out of good churches they might have
[28:37] come out out of a adulterous Church like
[28:39] a tape worship church but they just they
[28:41] come out of that they just come in
[28:42] different kind of
[28:44] bondage right they just trade name they
[28:46] just trade names on the church building
[28:48] but they're still Bound by sin
[28:49] Hallelujah that's
[28:51] right God help us not to do that
[28:53] Hallelujah they themselves are the
[28:55] Servants of corruption
[28:58] this is the same people that say oh it's
[29:00] okay to celebrate Halloween and I'm
[29:02] going to show my children Dracula movies
[29:03] and all these things yeah same
[29:07] thing right Servants of corruption oh
[29:10] yeah same ones that said it's okay to
[29:12] live a nonbinary life and that's that's
[29:14] like one day I think I'm a man so I'll
[29:16] look for a man or a woman to marry or
[29:18] next day I think I'm a woman I I'll look
[29:19] for a man to or or vice versa I think
[29:21] I'm a woman I'll look for a man or man
[29:23] or woman vice versa I mix it up a little
[29:25] bit but they they say that's okay it's
[29:27] okay to tattoo parlors and all these
[29:29] things and they say they have liberty no
[29:32] they don't have Liberty real Liberty is
[29:34] only through obedience to the word of
[29:36] God amen amen they'll mock me they'll
[29:39] make fun of me they'll make fun of
[29:40] brother Brooks they'll make fun of all
[29:42] these people the Bible said Swift
[29:44] destruction that's what the Bible says
[29:47] hallelujah
[29:49] amen for of whom a man is overcome of
[29:52] the same as he brought into bondage so
[29:54] whatever evil spirit they commune with
[29:56] it brings them into bondage to that
[29:59] right in this case worldliness and I'm
[30:01] going to preach on that again like the
[30:02] the leev of Herod I'm going to preach on
[30:03] that again Lord willing see whatever
[30:07] they let themselves overcome if they
[30:09] entertain worldly Spirits they're going
[30:10] to be a slave to worldly
[30:12] Spirits right and you can put any evil
[30:16] spirit in there and they're a slave to
[30:17] that I'm going to show a few in just a
[30:19] moment just as a reminder for if they
[30:21] have escaped the pollutions of the world
[30:23] through the knowledge of the Lord and
[30:24] Savior Jesus Christ they're again
[30:25] entangled therein so this is the case of
[30:27] some of them some of them may might have
[30:29] come out of false message churches and
[30:31] they might have got free but then as
[30:32] they learn more they're never able to
[30:35] come to the knowledge of the truth as
[30:36] they go to a liberal Church they get
[30:38] tangled right back into a different kind
[30:40] of
[30:41] sin right maybe it was idolatry of
[30:44] brother Braham they come out of that and
[30:46] now they're free from that idolatry but
[30:47] then they go to church that's uh has
[30:49] other idols and now they're now their
[30:51] Idols are
[30:54] worldliness okay everybody see that by
[30:56] God's grace they came out of one but
[30:58] then they go to another and get Bound
[31:01] Again all all bound up all over
[31:06] again the Bible said uh they overcome
[31:09] the latter end is worse with them than
[31:11] the
[31:12] beginning for it been better for them
[31:14] not to known the way of righteousness
[31:15] than after they have known it to turn
[31:17] from the holy commandment delivered unto
[31:19] them but it's happened unto them
[31:21] according to the true proverb the dog is
[31:23] turned to his own vomit again and the s
[31:25] that was washed her wallering in in the
[31:28] m so Peter gives inspired analogies
[31:32] people that go back to sin are like dogs
[31:34] and like pigs right but we're like
[31:37] eagles and Lambs hallelujah hallelujah
[31:40] praise God I know this ain't the maybe
[31:42] the most shouting message like this
[31:43] morning about Grace but I just want to
[31:45] bring this out so you can see these are
[31:47] the attributes of people that commune
[31:48] with demons yet they go to church yeah
[31:51] yet they claim to be prophets or claim
[31:53] to be enlightened they claim to have
[31:54] Liberty but they're actually communing
[31:56] with demons
[32:00] now remember brother Ram said brother
[32:02] said we're in a war right and we know
[32:05] brother R said when we pray when we
[32:07] spend time in prayer it's like setting
[32:09] up a Garrison against the
[32:11] enemy now Garrison is a military Outpost
[32:14] right yeah so you know let's say you
[32:16] live in Jerusalem or you you'll set a
[32:18] Garrison many miles from Jerusalem to
[32:20] protect
[32:21] Jerusalem so if you start to see an
[32:22] enemy come you got a little bit of
[32:24] protection and you got time to send back
[32:26] somebody to the city and say hey the
[32:27] enemy is coming
[32:30] right Hallelujah so a Garrison is like a
[32:33] protection you got an outpost
[32:36] right so friends you we got to remember
[32:39] we got to keep our prayer going so we're
[32:41] protected we know when the enemy's
[32:42] coming around that's right amen remember
[32:46] Jonathan 1st Samuel 13- 14 Jonathan
[32:48] overtook a Garrison it's a beautiful
[32:50] story and uh this were this was his
[32:53] words you know he he did it with an
[32:54] armor bear I forget how many men it
[32:56] might have been 20 or so he defeated
[32:59] he said come let us go over unto the
[33:00] Garrison of these uncircumcised it may
[33:03] be that the Lord will work for us I like
[33:05] that for there is no restraint to the
[33:08] Lord to save by many or few that's right
[33:11] in other words we're going to try to
[33:12] take some land and I believe God's with
[33:14] us it doesn't matter how many's against
[33:17] us as long as God's with us God can
[33:19] deliver us amen so this is an example of
[33:22] getting your prayer life back amen
[33:25] hallelujah amen this is an example of
[33:27] getting your walk with God back amen
[33:30] they'd lost some land but they can take
[33:32] it back as long as God's with them
[33:35] amen is that right church amen you can
[33:39] get like we're talking about getting our
[33:40] first love back we're talking about
[33:41] those type of things for those that need
[33:43] that right Hallelujah and don't be
[33:44] ashamed Church don't be ashamed let's be
[33:46] honest with God hallelujah this is
[33:48] communion with God hallelujah it's not
[33:50] communion with me or communion with
[33:51] somebody else is communion with God amen
[33:54] amen amen amen a Garrison is a military
[33:57] post or
[34:01] position and you know and so I just say
[34:03] it like this you know a Garrison is kind
[34:04] of like a stronghold right it's like a a
[34:06] a it's like a base it's like a military
[34:09] base remember friends we have weapons
[34:12] that are not carnal so it's it's not
[34:14] really your Bible that's going to get it
[34:16] it's you listening to the voice of the
[34:18] Bible right it's you obeying the spirit
[34:21] of the Bible you can I can buy a brand
[34:23] new Bible every year that's not going to
[34:24] give me Victory I got to believe what
[34:26] the Bible says amen
[34:29] hallelujah you got to do more than press
[34:31] play on the tape you got to be more than
[34:33] press play on the sermon on YouTube you
[34:35] actually have to obey what the sermon
[34:36] said hallelujah amen that's our real
[34:39] weapon
[34:41] hallelujah it's mighty through God to
[34:43] the pulling down of strongholds
[34:47] yep so when you actually as I said
[34:50] earlier when you rebuke Satan and you
[34:52] you you resist Satan it actually works
[34:55] mightily amen and the church said am it
[34:59] shouldn't be that big of a fight if you
[35:01] got a mighty weapon and your enem is not
[35:03] as strong as your weapon you ought to be
[35:05] able to win pretty mightily praise God
[35:08] right you ought to be able to get the
[35:10] victory if you got a mighty
[35:12] weapon let's just do a simple example if
[35:15] someone's got a uh someone's got a water
[35:18] gun right we got the water guns out
[35:19] there if someone's got a water gun but
[35:21] you got an
[35:23] AR who's going to win that well you got

[37:41] that's a acceptable attitude to have as
[37:43] a Christian amen amen I'm going to
[37:45] overcome my enemy and I'm going to
[37:48] defeat the enemy praise God I'm going to
[37:49] put Satan under my feet

[38:35] needs come up right so what are we doing
[38:37] we're trying to set up a Garrison a
[38:39] prayer to protect him yes because there
[38:42] you could you could go through a lot of
[38:44] uh bitterness you go through a lot of
[38:46] loneliness and when church when you're
[38:48] lonely you could do a lot of things you
[38:49] wish you wouldn't have done are you
[38:51] hearing
[38:52] me when you're in let me say despair
[38:55] when you're in despair depression you'll
[38:57] do some things you thought you might
[38:58] never do
[39:00] before so what are we doing when we're
[39:02] praying we're setting up a
[39:03] Garrison to protect our brothers and
[39:06] sisters that the enemy can't get to them
[39:08] am hallelujah

[39:26] amen the enemy approaching but I know
[39:29] that the Garrison hold because mothers

[39:34] experience heavenbound peoples on their
[39:37] knees praying oh God give
[39:41] deliverance and father we pray that

[39:57] got to get on our knees sometimes and
[39:58] pray I I should say like this we should
[40:00] get on our knees very
[40:03] Faithfully keep up the Garrison over
[40:05] your life your family your house your
[40:08] church but also those you're praying for
[40:10] as well
[40:12] amen hallelujah and I thought remember I
[40:15] thought of brother Phil remember we had
[40:17] nine pages of of Victory nine pages of
[40:18] Deliverance Nine's a really good number
[40:20] nine fruits of the spirit nine gifts of
[40:23] the Spirit nine months and a new birth
[40:26] Hallelujah nine a really good number so
[40:29] the fact we got nine and remember we
[40:30] just didn't pray for him one time we've
[40:31] been praying for him multiple
[40:33] times I like that so what we're doing
[40:35] we're setting up a Garrison to protect
[40:37] our brother and church we didn't really
[40:39] realize what we're doing right we were
[40:41] praying all those prayers and we just we
[40:42] forget about it right we go Monday well
[40:44] we got to do Monday morning work got to
[40:45] do Tuesday Morning work we forget about
[40:47] all those garrisons thank God God
[40:49] doesn't forget
[40:50] hallelujah thank God he remembers our
[40:52] prayers he collects them hallelujah amen
[40:55] and then the Bible said when he answers
[40:57] them he pours them out Hallelujah glory
[41:01] amen so we got to set up some garrisons
[41:03] for our loved ones that's what we did
[41:05] this morning we had numerous people come
[41:07] up up for prayer for loved ones and so
[41:09] forth Hallelujah that's what we're doing
[41:11] we're setting up garrisons of protection
[41:14] amen Lord protect their lives you know I
[41:17] thought I even thought this and I've
[41:18] heard numerous people say this how many
[41:20] times have I prayed for president
[41:22] Trump and there were people that saying
[41:24] I've heard people just on the newscast
[41:25] they say the only reason he's alive is
[41:27] because God gave him Grace I believe
[41:30] that if a bullet got that close to me I
[41:32] wouldn't give credit to myself I'd give
[41:35] I credit to
[41:36] God see Church even our prayers can have
[41:39] garrisons on other people too right so
[41:42] we want to remember that by God's grace
[41:44] Hallelujah God's God's grace is what
[41:46] spares us hallelujah God's grace gives
[41:48] us another chance amen amen God
[41:50] remembers our prayers now friends don't
[41:52] forget you know um Israel had many
[41:56] enemies before before they crossed the
[41:58] promised land
[41:59] right but then don't forget they had
[42:01] many enemies once they came in the
[42:03] promised land right so what I'm saying
[42:05] is whether you're born again or not you
[42:08] can overcome the enemies and you have an
[42:10] enemy to defeat by God's grace that's
[42:12] right
[42:14] Hallelujah now brother uh William I
[42:17] preaches back in I think
[42:19] 2017 but in Joshua 310 I don't know if I
[42:22] ever shared that with you or not but the
[42:25] Lord just gave me some Grace one time to
[42:26] see
[42:28] it but all these Seven Nations that
[42:30] Joshua was overcome they have spiritual
[42:33] meanings
[42:35] right and uh here here's kind of what
[42:38] they here's kind of where I got their
[42:39] definitions Canaanite the word Canaan
[42:41] means a Trader or Merchant well traders
[42:43] to make money right so Canaanite
[42:45] spiritually represents overcoming the
[42:47] Love of Money yes
[42:50] right hittite the word hittite means a
[42:54] son of Heth and Heth means terror terror
[42:56] is fear
[42:58] so Joshua had to defeat the spirit of
[43:00] fear Joshua had to defeat the Love of
[43:04] Money
[43:06] Glory hivites
[43:08] uh now hi Hittites I had to get that
[43:11] from the uh the the DI the Bible
[43:14] dictionary if I'm not
[43:15] mistaken and it means villagers and so
[43:18] it dealt with worldliness so it means
[43:20] com so when I looked at the definition
[43:23] it was uh worldliness oh yeah and then
[43:26] they were also associated with the
[43:28] gibeonites and so remember uh Israel
[43:30] made league with gibeonites and so God
[43:33] was telling Joshua don't make Leagues
[43:34] with anybody don't make any compromises
[43:36] with anybody amen don't let sin into
[43:38] your life because it's going to come
[43:40] back and hurt
[43:41] you whenever sin you allow to live in
[43:44] your life it's going to hurt you and
[43:45] your family or hurt you and somebody
[43:46] else later on you've got to keep it out
[43:49] of your life amen Allelujah parazite
[43:52] again it means like villager oh yeah
[43:54] Farmers yeah the dictionary says Farmers
[43:56] so what's a farm Farm is earth right
[43:58] carnal Earthly carnal mindedness now I
[44:01] love this one girgashite means clay I
[44:03] just looked it up today and what did say
[44:05] iron and Clay iron Roman Catholic Church
[44:07] clay were the Protestants denominations
[44:09] that's right that's right and didn't
[44:11] didn't Peter battle denominational spear
[44:13] yes I'm not going to eat with the
[44:14] Gentiles very very good that that's an
[44:17] enemy you're going have to battle in
[44:19] this land that's right in this land
[44:21] Hallelujah you must defeat the
[44:25] gites amorites were the Giants so I just
[44:28] I just thought that was like a giant
[44:30] fleshly lus right they were there were
[44:33] giant Hills or mountains right giant
[44:35] mountains you have to overcome so I just
[44:37] called it giant fleshly lust there must
[44:39] have been a reason for that in the
[44:40] dictionary but the last one is jebusites
[44:43] remember the jebusites were the ones
[44:44] that were holding Jerusalem and David
[44:46] had to drive them out because Joshua
[44:48] couldn't Joshua's the tribe of Judah
[44:50] couldn't drive them out they were a
[44:52] stronghold amen they were a complex
[44:56] right brother R had to drive out
[44:58] complexes out of his own
[45:00] life complexes against the people why
[45:02] aren't they uh why aren't they listen
[45:04] what I said why uh I don't want to
[45:06] preach to them maybe I should move away
[45:09] maybe I should leave them in the field
[45:10] all these things see
[45:13] complexes he had to drive them out if he
[45:16] drove them out you can drive them out
[45:18] praise God he never left the field but
[45:21] he was tempted to leave the
[45:22] field Hallelujah you might never love
[45:25] money but you might be tempted to love
[45:27] money so you have to cast down that evil
[45:29] spirit hallelujah amen

[50:52] destroy the Temptation before it
[50:54] destroys your life remember we've seen
[50:56] so many preachers fall this year in the
[50:58] message and out of the message they they
[51:00] took a enemy for granted and destroyed
[51:04] their Ministries destroyed their lives
[51:06] destroys their families and now they're
[51:08] trying to pick up all the pieces in
[51:09] their family and Ministries amen and
[51:11] they'll forever be connected to that
[51:13] failure that's right because they let
[51:16] this sin grow they let this little
[51:18] amalaki grow up brother random says they
[51:21] let this little hivite grow up and
[51:23] become an adult

[51:43] Victory praise
[51:45] God and now just I thought I'd bring
[51:47] this up with evil spirits remember these
[51:49] are exact quotes brother said the spirit
[51:51] of unbelief is the chief of all Devils
[51:54] remember it's either Faith you're saved
[51:55] or unbelief you're lost L that's why
[51:57] that one's the chief demon it gets
[52:00] people to not even believe they can be
[52:01] saved or believe God can even have mercy
[52:03] on them and the Bible said you just got
[52:05] to look to the cross and you'll see the
[52:06] love of God Amen just look to the cross
[52:09] of Jesus Christ you find the love of God
[52:14] Amen brother said a religious demon is
[52:16] the worst demon to actually deal with
[52:18] those are the worst people to talk to
[52:20] are people that have evil spirits and
[52:21] they're religious Spirits in churches
[52:24] right you can't teach them anything
[52:25] about the Bible right
[52:27] right and they call you the devil yet
[52:29] they're the ones filled with the devil I
[52:31] get it all the time online brother said
[52:33] now here's one this this might battle us
[52:35] when we get distressed or nervousness
[52:37] brother B said that's the worst feeling
[52:38] anyone could have is is
[52:42] nervousness so we got to learn to cast
[52:44] down those feelings we have to learn to
[52:46] trust the word and overcome our feelings
[52:48] cast down our feelings I know it's hard
[52:50] but keep stay in the battle you'll get
[52:51] the victory keep fighting the battle
[52:53] amen and brother said fear accompanies
[52:56] doubt he said it's the greatest thing
[52:58] against the church is fear what's going
[53:00] to happen at the election what's going
[53:02] to happen uh to my family what's going
[53:04] to happen to this what's going to happen
[53:05] with my job what's going see and if we
[53:07] don't if we don't stop worried about
[53:09] that that spirit will overtake
[53:12] us it must be cast out it must be
[53:16] overcome
[53:21] Hallelujah now Paul says like this Paul
[53:25] does say that we can come into captivity
[53:28] we can come into uh a snare of the enemy
[53:32] MH right it's usually a mind battle
[53:35] right for us it's going to be a mind
[53:37] battle and this is uh and this this was
[53:41] kind of the main thought I had I never
[53:42] had seen you know 2 Corinthians 6 like
[53:44] this where it said you people have can
[53:46] have communion with Darkness people in
[53:48] the church can have communion with
[53:50] Darkness right I want to preach on First
[53:52] Corinthians remember all the things they
[53:53] had they were suing each other yeah mhm
[53:57] they were babies in the word they
[53:58] couldn't teach anybody nothing they
[53:59] weren't paying attention to Doctrine
[54:01] they're arguing about who who's the
[54:03] favorite preacher
[54:05] yeah they had a man sleeping with his
[54:09] stepmom they had people getting drunk
[54:12] before communion
[54:14] yeah and that was the book of Acts
[54:17] church right because they are a worldly
[54:19] immature
[54:20] Church Hallelujah so see they and then
[54:23] Paul wrote they were having they they
[54:25] were having this fellowship with
[54:30] Darkness so see we have to make sure we
[54:32] don't have fellowship with Darkness we
[54:34] entertain see church we entertain dark
[54:37] thoughts sometimes we got to cast those
[54:39] down yeah because Satan stood up against
[54:43] Israel this is what I thought of and
[54:45] provoked David to number Israel David
[54:47] wasn't purposely having fellowship with
[54:49] Satan but the Bible said he was allured
[54:52] by Satan he started entertaining the
[54:55] thoughts of Satan and church that
[54:57] happens to us
[54:58] too right it happens to us too we get
[55:01] allured because that's the word right
[55:03] there Paul said he Paul said I was
[55:05] brought into captivity to the law of sin
[55:08] which is in my body my
[55:11] members captivity means slavery right
[55:14] you're caught into captivity you get
[55:17] snared in a trap Hallelujah so what is
[55:21] I'm what I'm saying is that sometimes we
[55:22] accept the evil thoughts and we've got
[55:24] to get ourselves out of that trap we're
[55:26] LED away the Bible said we're LED Away
[55:28] by our own lust Hallelujah God doesn't
[55:31] tempt us with any evil he allows us to
[55:34] be
[55:35] tested we have to make sure we have
[55:37] communion with the holy spirit amen and
[55:40] not evil thoughts and evil
[55:46] spirits and I don't expect people to
[55:48] shout over this but I do expect us to be
[55:49] honest about
[55:51] it praise
[55:53] God we're talking about communion with
[55:55] the Holy Spirit
[55:57] intimacy with the Holy Spirit Lord I
[55:59] want the Holy Spirit Lord I want your
[56:00] spirit to rule my life I want to give
[56:03] everything over to the holy spirit so I
[56:04] can have communion with you Lord God
[56:06] Amen
[56:08] Hallelujah he saw this other law and it
[56:11] was a
[56:13] war and sometimes it would bring him
[56:15] into captivity and then he would do
[56:17] things that he hated instead of the
[56:19] things that were right right that's the
[56:22] key there we have to hate our
[56:24] sin we've got to hate it amen and then
[56:29] we can overcome it by the grace of God
[56:31] Amen we've got to hate any sin in our
[56:34] lives I'm almost done you've been a good
[56:36] been as always a good audience I got
[56:38] seven minutes left on my hour there by
[56:40] God's grace I thought it take me about
[56:42] an hour this here remember church I read
[56:44] this this week you have
[56:47] Fellowship that which we have seen and
[56:49] heard declare we onto you that ye may
[56:51] have fellowship with us so John saying
[56:54] we want you have fellowship with us but
[56:55] TR truly our fellowship is with the
[56:58] father and his son Jesus Christ amen so
[57:01] that's how it should be here if Austin
[57:02] and I all of us here I'm trying to use
[57:05] the brothers you know all the brothers
[57:06] amen and I and William and Nia if we all
[57:08] have Fellowship really our fellowship is
[57:10] with the father and the son and that's a
[57:12] fresh Revelation struck me brother
[57:13] William the wheel in the middle of the
[57:15] wheel what is it two wheels it's the the
[57:17] father inside the son I just thought I'd
[57:19] dropped it in there right God's grace
[57:21] it's a fresh Revelation I was just
[57:22] preaching at Kentucky I'm like yeah
[57:23] there it is I've always wondered what is
[57:24] the wheel within the wheel it's
[57:26] God in Christ the Bible said God is in
[57:28] Christ reconciling the world unto
[57:30] himself amen that's right that's what
[57:32] Ezekiel Saw a wheel within the wheel
[57:36] Hallelujah I never seen that till now
[57:38] Hallelujah this last week so that's our
[57:41] fellowship our fellowship is within the
[57:43] is is with the wheel within the
[57:46] wheel and these things we write unto you
[57:48] that your joy may be full see when you
[57:51] hopefully this will help you when you
[57:54] really have fellowship with God you're
[57:56] joyful about being a Christian and the
[57:58] church said amen see that if you lost
[58:00] your joy that means you're probably
[58:02] having fellowship with the wrong
[58:04] thing because the Bible says when you
[58:06] have fellowship with us and God in
[58:08] Christ your joy is full how many felt
[58:11] pry joyful after service this morning I
[58:14] was really joyful amen I'm like I'm
[58:16] going to go buy them some
[58:18] popsicles I'm sorry you weren't here I
[58:20] do
[58:21] apologize remind me I'll get you some
[58:23] next
[58:25] weekend uh
[58:26] um when we see when we have that special
[58:29] communion our joy should be full we
[58:31] should be just full of the joy of the
[58:33] Lord
[58:35] amen verse five this then is the message
[58:39] which we've heard of him and declare
[58:40] unto you that God is light and in him is
[58:43] no Darkness at all remember we shouldn't
[58:46] have fellowship with Darkness right if
[58:48] we say that we have fellowship with him
[58:49] and walk in darkness we lie and we do
[58:52] not the truth that's right okay so
[58:56] fellowship with God is doing the
[58:58] truth and if we're not doing the truth
[59:00] we're not having fellowship with God
[59:03] we're not able to hear God's voice
[59:05] everybody understand because you're
[59:06] talking you you're flirting with like
[59:08] Samson you're flirting with
[59:10] Delah you're flirting you're talking
[59:12] with her you're flirting with evil
[59:14] spirits rather than talking to God I
[59:17] tell you God wants to talk with you all
[59:18] day long how many believe that by God's
[59:23] grace but if we walk in the light as
[59:26] he's in the light see we have to leave
[59:27] the darkness leave that evil spirit
[59:29] behind leave that Temptation behind we
[59:31] got to walk back in the light as he's in
[59:33] the light we have fellowship with one
[59:35] another and the blood of Jesus Christ
[59:37] his son cleanses us from all everybody
[59:39] say all all sin all a l all sin you
[59:46] don't have to worry what about this in
[59:47] my past what about this in my past the
[59:49] Bible said all amen what about that bad
[59:53] week what about that bad month what
[59:54] about that bad year the Bible said all
[59:57] hallelujah amen remember God forgave 16
[1:00:00] years of Israel not building that Temple
[1:00:02] God forgave them and the Bible said they
[1:00:05] prospered through the prophets and what
[1:00:07] they shout when they realized God
[1:00:08] forgave us of 16 years what they shout
[1:00:11] Grace Grace unto it amen that's Grace
[1:00:14] that's what Grace does it erases 16
[1:00:17] years of failes it erases all your past
[1:00:19] it forgets all that and it brings you
[1:00:21] back into God's life Hallelujah heyen 16
[1:00:25] years almost two decades amen MH of
[1:00:28] wasted time God can look past that and
[1:00:30] he just say I'm just giving you Grace
[1:00:32] you don't deserve it I'm giving you
[1:00:34] Grace anyway
[1:00:36] hallelujah thank God Amen if God and if
[1:00:38] God will do that in the blood of bulls
[1:00:39] and ghost surely he'll do in the New
[1:00:41] Testament

[1:00:47] have to get his number like 52 years of
[1:00:50] of walking in sin God will forgive in a
[1:00:52] moment's time then he'll give you joy
[1:00:54] unspeakable full of Glory
[1:00:58] am hallelujah praise God Amen he can say
[1:01:02] to the uttermost church hallelujah amen
[1:01:04] don't give up on God he surely won't
[1:01:06] give up on you I love that song I don't
[1:01:08] like the singer that song but I like
[1:01:09] that song some of you know what I'm
[1:01:11] talking
[1:01:14] about so here we go so what is our most
[1:01:17] intimate Fellowship it's back to our
[1:01:19] text so see I'm did like a circle I
[1:01:20] started here I started second
[1:01:22] Corinthians I left it and I'm coming
[1:01:23] back to Second Corinthians I did a
[1:01:24] little circle sermon here today that
[1:01:25] guys
[1:01:27] I'm closing with what I started with so
[1:01:29] here's the most intimate Fellowship what
[1:01:31] agreement have the temple of God with
[1:01:35] Idols for ye are the Temple of the
[1:01:37] Living God remember anything can be an
[1:01:38] idol right husband wife money car
[1:01:42] riches anything your phone that's going
[1:01:45] to probably be the most one of the most
[1:01:47] powerful Idols in our lives that's true
[1:01:50] for ye are the Temple of the Living God
[1:01:53] as God has said I will dwell in them and
[1:01:58] walk in them that's why brother said
[1:02:00] when Moses came down it's like God
[1:02:02] stepped in his
[1:02:05] sandals God said God said in Exodus 3 I
[1:02:09] come down to deliver the children of
[1:02:11] Israel said God just stepped in Moses's
[1:02:14] sandals Hallelujah because that's what
[1:02:17] the Bible
[1:02:18] says I will dwell with them I'll walk in
[1:02:21] them imagine brother Austin you walk
[1:02:22] into uh where's the story you might walk

[1:03:44] be their God and they shall be my people
[1:03:47] hallelujah
[1:03:49] amen wherefore come out from among them

[1:04:30] most intimate there's my hour Glory
[1:04:33] Hallelujah this is the most intimate
[1:04:36] Fellowship we can have with Christ is
[1:04:38] when we get to the spot I'm not even
[1:04:39] going to touch that I'm not even going
[1:04:41] to look at it I'm not even going to
[1:04:43] think about
[1:04:44] it I'm going to let God Walk In Me Glory
[1:04:48] so God can be my God and that wherever I
[1:04:51] walk that's where God can walk amen amen
[1:04:54] amen
[1:04:55] hallelujah amen that's when I'm walking
[1:04:57] in the light that's when I'm having
[1:04:59] fellowship with Jesus Christ amen
[1:05:02] amen I'll say like this that's when I
[1:05:04] can whisper prayers and talk to God and
[1:05:06] he hears my every prayer amen whether he
[1:05:09] answers it in my time or not but that's
[1:05:11] when I'm having communion I can talk
[1:05:13] with him at Target I can talk with him
[1:05:15] wherever I
[1:05:16] go because I'm not touching the unclean
[1:05:20] thing I'm separated unto the work of God
[1:05:24] I'm joyful in the fellowship of Jesus
[1:05:26] Christ the
[1:05:28] church let's stand to our
[1:05:32] feet musicians can
[1:05:38] come communion with Christ or
[1:05:42] Devils we want communion with Christ
[1:05:45] amen will we battle Devils of course
[1:05:47] that's one of the main points David did
[1:05:49] right Paul said he was brought into
[1:05:50] captivity sometimes he was allured we're
[1:05:53] so easily beset but the T these these
[1:05:55] type of sermons are to remind us how God
[1:05:58] makes us the strongest when we have the
[1:06:00] most pure communion with him amen when
[1:06:03] we're totally sold out
[1:06:05] Samson I'm talking to myself too I'm
[1:06:07] Samson too when we're totally sold out
[1:06:10] sold out we don't even listen to one
[1:06:12] word of
[1:06:13] Delila that's true that's when we have
[1:06:15] the real fellowship and that's when we
[1:06:17] can get Victory and we can do let we say
[1:06:19] like this that's when we can do what God
[1:06:22] has called us to do we can do what we
[1:06:24] were born to to do amen yes born to
[1:06:28] defeat the Philistines that's right

[1:06:33] communion with the Holy Spirit God bless
