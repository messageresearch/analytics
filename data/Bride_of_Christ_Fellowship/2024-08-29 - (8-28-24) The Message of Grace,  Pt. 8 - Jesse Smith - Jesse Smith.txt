========================================

1 Peter 4:10 again I'll just be pulling out some highlights you know out of brother Ram's uh sermon there uh and as far as I understand I listened to it many many times but the save thief on the cross was the last individual brother Braham dealt with remember he dealt with Adam and Eve Noah Abraham Israel as a nation Moses David the saved thief on the cross as far as my counting oh that's seven praise God hallelujah that's a pretty good number uh completion by God's grace first Peter 4:10 and I was looking at some of the quotes you know I want to U I want to look at maybe gifts again tonight brother Ben was ministering on gifts how many you enjoyed that by God's grace I sure appreciated that U and I know we got quiet on some things but that's good that means we're thinking about it right Hallelujah by God's grace some things I got to go study out and some things I want to go think about too so that's good I I like to be challenged I like to learn more Hallelujah like I said that was a wonderful uh beautiful sermon both sermons but Sunday morning really was a blessing to me and I did share sh his sermon with that person but I realized it wasn't last week they sent it it was a whole month ago so to me the months or weeks are just kind of flowing together so I didn't mean to uh misrepresent the truth but I found out okay that was a month ago so uh it's still fitting though and I shared the the sermon with uh the person online 1 Peter 4:10 uh so I want to look at here how the gifts of God if we're faithful with them uh we must be stewards of the grace of God so the gifts that are given to us it's God's grace to us and then we want to be a faithful Steward of it so we look at that here tonight by God's grace because you know I guess in my thinking I've always thought this if I have a gift and let's say it's healing right I've I've sh shared that over the years I've Just Seen different people healed you know like even back in Iowa there well then I would think well if I'm going to double that then I should see double the Miracles but is that always the case is that always the case I mean because at what point does it stop doubling you know if you keep you know if I get a five-fold increase you know on my gift well then if there's one Miracle last year I double it or if I have to increase it by five every year 1 Time 5 is five 5 Time 5 is 25 you understand what I'm saying I'm trying not to look at this Elementary with an elementary mind although I'm an elementary teacher but I'm trying to look at it spiritually and what does God expect of me because remember as Paul got older uh the everybody thought God had left him they like brother man dramatizes it in the present stage of my Ministry he says well well they looked at Paul and said oh he must not have a gift of healing anymore he's in prison or he must have lost he must have lost his gift well actually quite the opposite he was more devoted there in prison to write letters and write the Bible for us so you know you see how there how God can move you out of one gift and maybe bring in another gift by God's grace so I've tried to apply that to my life too I I just want to be faithful with the gifts I want to be a good Steward of the gifts and so uh let's read this here if we can't hear about God's grace okay let's read on three one two three as every man hath received the gift even so Minister the same one to another as good stewards of the manifold grace of God may God add his a blessing to the reading of his word you can be seated I am going to try to watch the time I'm fully exhausted from uh this last year weeks here and then singing just really took it out of me by God's grace and I forgot singing is a gift of healing so if anybody's been blessed by our songs you know maybe people are just pulling on the gifts you know I don't know by God's grace but I'm just happy to to serve the Lord so again that was the reminder you know I'm sorry the little review you know we looked at the Save thief on the cross last week and it went beautifully in my humble opinion went beautifully right into that Sunday message about uh the secret believer you enjoy that by God's grace I hope that that was a real blessing to me and I got a couple testimonies off for that people were really blessed by that so now I want to read just a a quote out of the message of Grace that has really nothing to do with uh these characters but brother man makes a statement uh I've I've recorded I've recorded over four hours with brother cam about Bible versions uh and I have edited one hour I'm waiting on cam to okay it so I can go public with it and again I think people are just going to call me a fanatic you know like they've called me with these other things oh you're a King James version only you're a fanatic well I I got proof I mean if you take one word away what's the Bible say your curse right your name can to be taken out um and so I just want to respect that verse right I want to respect that verse and so most people if they're even message people if they're using Bibles that have you know I'll just say it in the one book cam showed me this author just chose 257 verses like that's not even the whole Bible that's a very small segment and every Bible version had at least 5% of those missing out of just 257 what about the thousands of rest of them and some of those versions had 97% of those verses missing this is a big deal now can people still get saved in NIV of course I I was one of them I was saved my life was changed reading just reading NIV Bible remember I told you my testimony I saw the guy raising his hands I've told you 100 times you you could probably tell better than I can tell it I probably forgot all the details by now uh anybody know what college he went to yeah my wife says yeah Ohio State but you know what did I do when I got home I opened up my NIV Bible what I do I tore down all the evil pictures threw all the way on my CDs my rock and roll and rap and Country CDs and I was reading the NIV Bible I got saved in an NIV Bible but when I started when I learn more oh my we they're missing whole verses and then you know the more the more liberal people get they'll actually change the whole idea and they won't translate word for word they'll translate thought for thought but they got the wrong thought they got the wrong thought about the Greek and so they give you the wrong thought about the Greek right rather than just doing word for word they do thought for thought that's even more dangerous so anyways um so with that in mind all that to background and say this brother man makes this quote it's in paragraph 94 he says uh the Israel Church never come to its full value the grace of God holds us as well so he goes from Israel to us but he wants to get a church that'll obey him a people that'll take his word and say it's the truth regardless of your organization now don't forget let's always bring it to our day brother brandom always brought the message to our day he said let's not keep Pentecostals out of it let's include Pentecostals so let's bring the message churches into it right God wants a message church that will obey him regardless of what message Church you're in Hallelujah right because like I've told I've told you this before any message church that starts a false Doctrine they've now become an a denomination right we see the seven Thunders denomination of Joseph Coleman out of New York um you see Lil's denomination about the Peruan movement that that Peruan means Christ is already here with that so they don't have to fast uh there's you don't have to shout and scream he's already here you don't have to pray you don't have to you don't have to recognize his presence because he's already here that's in Ohio that was in Ohio mind you it's not far from Lima where we were going to church when Chris and I first got into the message and that has permeated churches all around the world okay but that becomes a denomination because it's off the word of God brother R said God wants a people that will not say well I'm just as good as you are I'm Presbyterian I'm Methodist I'm Catholic I'm as good as you are that's not Grace that shows there's something wrong Hallelujah he said but a person regardless that'll read God's word and see that you've got to be born again and filled with the Holy Ghost he says they'll believe that they'll take it by the word they'll take the word exactly what it says hallelujah and what about these people that'll take the quotes above the word of God they'd rather have message books than the Bible right and some of those statements in the message books we love brother BR but some of those statements are not in the Bible so they're actually taking words outside the Bible but brother BR said God wants a people that takes exactly what the Bible says hallelujah then he goes into you know baptism and sprinkling Trinity and all these cutting hair makeup and all these things he says we've been through the church ages and see where they had to do that you know they they had to overcome you know sprinkling because they and Trinity they didn't have the revelation of it in the middle of the church ages right he says but you see God wants somebody that obey him if it's not in the scriptures then it's a man-made Doctrine and not a Bible Doctrine Hallelujah he said so regardless of what the church is how wrong you've been what difference does that make it's how right you can be now God's Grace has shown it to you then walk in it God's grace amen right so if God showed you the truth that's God's grace to you Hallelujah and it's the godhead Revelation it's all the revelations right serpent seed uh predestination Seven Seals seven Church ages the gifts of the holy spirit Divine Healing all these Revelations God has made known to us that's God's grace that we know it Hallelujah so he says walk in it see how right you can be right now amen and then I'm going to read this quote brother Paul Griffin read this quote but he didn't get to read all of it CU he was really pressed for time and I'm glad he didn't because he he had the right he had the right words to say right he had the he had to get us to uh getting our first love back I wonder in our church how many still got their first love I got it amen I got it Hallelujah so I wonder how many got it hopefully everybody has it by God's grace brother's referencing Galatians 1 he says in other words if an angel would come to you from Heaven a bright shining Angel and would stand by boy that would be bait for this day wouldn't it a bright shining Angel come here and stand there and say some things that was contrary to the word and they would say Satan get away from me that's right if he's a bishop whoever he is don't you never believe him if he doesn't speak exactly with that Bible word for word how many how many remember brother Paul saying that yeah does it sound a little bit familiar he was quoting this from Christ is revealed his own word it's August 22nd oh that's pretty close to the day uh 1965 okay so again both these quotes both quotes I read from me message of Grace and God revealing his own word they both say the same thing God wants someone who take the Bible word for word exactly as it says hallelujah so that's why you know when preachers come or anybody comes or even when I preach it's okay if you're quiet think about it if you don't understand something you don't have to say Amen right now what I do is if I don't understand it I'll wait till he says something right right afterwards then I'll say Amen to that but I wasn't saying Amen to what I didn't know because I if I don't know it I don't know it uh you don't know what you don't know we got that was good now brother said now watch him he'll carry you with the Bible now he's talking about God God will make sure you stay in the Bible he'll carry you to a certain place and then hook it right in there when you see the Bible saying one thing he bypasses that watch him right there he's talking about a false teacher he said that's the way Satan done with Eve okay now here's an another quote on God's grace brother Bram says Grace the grace of God has brought forth a shadow brought uh God brought Grace into our lives by his love for us here's something else great can't Grace Can't Do Grace cannot be bought remember Simon the Sorcerer he said I'll pay you money give me that money so I can be a preacher like you and I people can get the Holy Ghost Peter said your money perish with you right but man says you cannot bargain God for God's grace but I'll say it like this let me go the other side but you can make vows to God which is a type of a bargain for uh for your personal requests they're called vows everybody got it you can't bargain for a gift that's not yours but you can make a promise to God you can make a vow to God for something you're Desiring Hallelujah and remember even if it's something you desire even if it's the permissive will of God God may give it to you even if it isn't his perfect will and you'll you probably suffer for it like Hezekiah right Hezekiah oh he threw himself on the wall remember such a beautiful story he said Lord you know the Integrity of my heart but in the Integrity of his heart he got a little moved by emotion and he prayed and he and God gave him the permissive will will but then his sons got killed he had two sons remember he didn't have any sons to passing on to but the sons died they were awful men the Bible says they did not serve the Lord their God like Hezekiah did right and then he failed with the Babylonian visitors remember the princes that visit him he showed them all that and what they do they went back and then here come here come Nebuchadnezzar to ransack it so what does it teach us we should seek the perfect will of God first before our desires right remember balam failed with it too bam said can I go God God said no he goes back well let me let me try again if there's money involved I'll go ask God again if I can make a little money in this I'll do it God said fine go so thus sayith the Lord change in one day thus say the Lord was don't go thus sayth the Lord go in other words thus sayi the Lord I'm giving you the permissive will of God I didn't change my mind about the first word right but I'm giving you what you want okay so see how you have to rightly divide this quote you can't bargain for Grace if it doesn't belong to you in other words you can't you can't have a gift that that's not yours and you can't bargain to be saved even Esau tried to get it with tears but what does it show it showed he was what he had when he was bargaining for it it was worldly sorrow it wasn't Godly sorrow amen cuz he look he never cleaned up his life afterwards he had he a polygamist if I'm not mistaken uh the Bible never says he repents of some of these murders he did and all these things like that so it was just a worldly sorrow well no wonder he couldn't bargain he was trying to bargain well if I say if I cry enough maybe I'll get it back no you can't bargain like those things Hallelujah you can't bargain with worldly sorrow you got to be really truly sorrowful Hallelujah where you want to repent of that and and make up for your amends uh I'm sorry make amends for your sins Amen brother said that's something else you cannot buy Grace it's from a sovereign one yes sir you cannot bargain for it you can say well God I'll do so and so if you'll do so and so regarding to Salvation he's talking about salvation I'll read you the scripture uh put up uh where's Romans uh 9:16 H let's we have to look at the context of the verse brother's referring to you cannot say God I'll do this if you do this God won't do that you can't pull anything out of God think about that now all these preachers are saying you can pull your healing out of God well what about the woman with the blood issue how she touched it out she pulled out virtue out of God well that's referring to Divine Healing that's not referring to Salvation look at the con you got to look at the context okay what is what is so then it is not of him that runneth nor of him that I'm sorry willth nor of him that runneth but God that showeth Mercy he's talking about the vessels of honor and dishonor Paul's talking about salvation and predestination if you're a vessel of Honor you can't be nothing but a vessel of Honor that ought make somebody say Amen that bring smile on somebody's face tonight if you are always a vessel of Honor in God's mind then you'll always be that Hallelujah if you were that before the foundation word if your name was on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world there's nothing that can take it off amen nothing but if you're a vessel of Dishonor like Esau like Judas SC scariot then you're going to sell out the gospel then you're really not going to repent but church if you really repented it shows you've got something you've got some honor in your heart hallelujah hallelujah praise God so this is the verse my Manon God gives it to you by his grace oh he says oh oh my not he that willth or him that rth but God that's showing Mercy that's right so it's like Simon the Sorcerer we don't know if he was saved or not but it looks like he was a vessel of Dishonor he repented got baptized but then he tries to buy it and Peter says uh you're surely you're close to perishing he said pray for me and uh and Peter probably prayed for him we were not told the end of the story we don't know hopefully he got saved hopefully you know he just lived a Christian Life right because he would not he wasn't called to pray for people for the baptism of the Holy Ghost he would not have asked for that if he was called to do it he would not have asked to pay for it with that if he was called to do that right so we we see this here you can beg and plead for God to answer your prayers that's good uh that that's fine but you can't you can't force God to do something you can't make a wager with God like with money right that's so we see that that's what brother Ram is saying here uh you you can't do that you can't bargain for Grace but you can make a vow to God right look at uh uh the great example uh the mother uh Samuel's mom I can't think of her Hannah I can't think of her name Hannah she made a vow she said God if you give me a son I'll give him back to you and she gave him back imagine giving a four or fiveyear old baby and you give him away and you never see him again that's quite a thing but she kept her promise that's why God honored her like she did like he did because he knew she was sincere made a promise to God hallelujah and so church that we're told that brother BR tells us that you can't bargain for certain things with God they're either predestinated salvation and Gifts you're either predestinated or you're not so all you can say is God uh uh and we're going to get to that next all say is God just show me what's in my life show me what your plan is for my life amen don't give me the permissive will give me the permiss the perfect will of God and give me a heart to receive it and wait for it amen because all gifts come in perfect time and season they all come at the perfect time and the perfect season what was uh brother Ben saying about gifts remember he was saying something about oh yeah brother brother Ben even brought it down to it's not even our gift it's God's Gift God gave gifts unto men There It Is God gave gifts unto men the preaching gifts and that's every gift including the the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit and then remember core and daythan they thought they had a gift to do something and they were trying to get to a gift that they didn't have that was preached Us by Brother McBride right there were they wanted they wanted their Ministry see how see how this was all tied together with brother uh McBride and and brother uh Ben I'm I'm tired tonight forgive me wake up brother wake up wake up uh so we can see how it's all tied together and then uh brother Bram brings this out you can't bargain a gift out of God you can't even bargain salvation out of God you just come you come God's provided way you take God's word brother man said uh you're not saved because of your Works he said you're saved because you met God's conditions God said repent and you repent now you're saved amen hallelujah you came God's provided way Hallelujah not by your works by him that willth or him that runneth but it's God that shows Mercy Hallelujah now let's get into gifts again just a little review because seemed like God was speaking to brother Dennis on it I'm sorry brother yeah brother Dennis and brother Ben my goodness gracious I'm probably trying to go too fast people brother man said people lay on their faces this is in uh the message of Grace and some men come to me I believe I seen one of the boys back here in the building today a Methodist boy just come in he received the Holy Spirit and them boys come to me and said now brother ramam now that we have been G I'm sorry now that we have been saved and received the Holy Ghost shall we go to seeking gifts and I said don't do it don't do it how many heard that quote before I've heard it for years people say don't worry about the don't worry about about the gifts but I preach this verse put up 1 Corinthians 1231 because people have misunderstood the context of brother Ram's quotes they do this many times they do this many many times because church this is what I found if people say they got the Holy Ghost then they stop seeking God and their life their life gets uh it gets cold on God but what does the Bible say I'm sorry this is not the sorry it's not 31 uh put up uh I got maybe I it down is it 141 yeah it's 141 sorry I better go back to my Bible my studying today I must have typed the wrong one had a good day though by God's grace really good day oh yeah yeah yeah that was right 12:31 yeah put up 12:31 then we'll go back to this one yeah I had I said it wrong but yeah earnestly covet the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way this is what I've seen people tell me they have the Holy Ghost or we we hear people say that Holy Ghost and if they don't go seeking gifts they're going to get cold on God that's going to open them up to a lot of Mind battles because you stop seeking God you know when you remember back when you're seeking the Holy Ghost what do you do it's all about prayer and everything's on God everything and people lose that when they get an experience I'm talking to our young ones too because we've had some good experiences last year was a year of experiences wasn't it that was awesome awesome but you can't stop because if you stop seeking God you're going to get cold on God Amen you're going to lose the fear of the Lord which I might preach on Sunday because I've been studying on backsliding because somebody asked me on the internet if you can you make a video on backs sliding I'm like yeah I'll start studying on that I'm like my goodness I was hoping to preach it tonight but there's no way I want to get to it tonight I got too many notes it ain't going to happen tonight no never But but so so brother says oh don't do it don't don't seek gifts but they don't read the rest of the quote not surprised most people don't right most people don't read the rest of the quote but what does Paul say covet earnestly that means covet like in the good way like my I want to see God use Malachi I want to God see God you sister Zur I want to see God you sister Naomi and sister Christen and I want to I I want I want to see God use their gifts that's what it means I want God to use them why so we all get edified amen amen so we can see God's Among Us a we're just not here on a social Gathering God's here amen like we seen with brother McBride and brother Dennis I mean all the brothers brother Ben all the brothers brother Paul brother Aaron I'm just not I'm just bringing them up because they're the most ones on my mind most recently but see covet these he's talking to people that have all kinds of gifts he said but covet the best gifts earnestly and yet show I unto you a more excellent way now go to 141 how could brother Ram say don't seek gifts don't seek gifts but the bble says it because people don't read the rest of the quote follow after charity and desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy see we should desire them everybody say desire ready desire you should come to church and desire boy I hope somebody has a Word of Wisdom tonight I hope somebody has a a word of knowledge tonight I hope somebody gets divinely healed tonight amen right that's just three of them there's six more I hope God give somebody the gift of faith like brother Ben said he he said when they were having that Bible study remember he said somebody was sick and he said who's got to get the faith go lay hands on them and pray for him because God might God might anoint that person's faith and God might move upon that person's faith and heal them right and the least at the least just come up for prayer you know have the preacher pray for you at the least you know if you have a need call on God you never know when God's going to move like that Danny guy with you know he could barely walk out there I didn't know I didn't feel I don't remember feeling anything when I prayed for him but God didn't move right away God moved uh uh 30 minutes after service when he's in the car and he felt the numbness leave he said I'm Healed she said praise the Lord that's what we need to do praise the Lord amen hallelujah so follow after charity desire spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy uh can you put up verse 39 in that same chapter yeah wherefore Brethren covet to prophesy God tell us the future is this the time of the squeeze we should desire that right like I've told you before I want to know if I'm going to be raptured or if I'm going to live to the Rapture or if I'll die I'd like to know that but I need to seek that more that's just one example I can easily bring up like we should desire some prophecy a dream to tell us what's going to happen next amen or a preacher to come in and prophesy through the sermon man it's a reality it happens and forbid not to speak with tongues I just gave you three Amen in the mouth of how many witnesses should every word be established to I just gave you three they're just in the same two chapters right 12 and 14 now let me read the rest of that quote so now people can understand why it's so misunderstood brother man said don't do it don't don't do it he said God gives his gifts sovereignly gifts and callings are without repentance Romans 12 I'm sorry Romans 11 sorry my fault now look brother man says the first thing you know you go to seeking something and say God you just make me a preacher oh now I understand what brother Ram's saying he said when people start seeking God for gifts he said they basically say God this is the gift I want give me the gift I want that's what was going on because they were all saying you got to speak in tongues and the church said oh so now now I understand brother R okay now I see what the Bible says brother Ram's not in disagreement with the Bible brother Ram's just saying the mood of that day was make me this make me this how many times you seen on these uh YouTube videos somebody made me an apostle somebody made me a pastor somebody made me a prophet and they never prophesied one time amen they never traveled overseas one time to a nation that didn't have Christians and actually uh made a convert and started a church they never did it one time they don't even know what they're talking about they're going through what brother BR was warning the people about praise God and now let's keep reading let's keep listening to brother Brandon he's God you just make me a preacher you just do this to me and what are you going to be a big stuffed shirt so prly say God let me speak in tongues and God might let you do it because remember gifts can just fall on people just for one a few times right they can do that and you just have that gift right uh like brother Ben said he's seen all nine gifts of the holy spirit in his life but I'm sure there are some more than others in the church that right I mean God doesn't promise how many times he's going to use you in that gift but if go but Glory if you're a yielded vessel he can use you for it for that moment amen hallelujah for that moment Hallelujah a big stuffed shirt that's all you'll go to some man's theology in some organization like Pentecostal speaking in tongues and there you'll pillow yourself down in canker well I'm a prophet or I'm a preacher when you really weren't you said God make me it we got a lot of preachers acting like they're preachers and they ain't preachers now ain't not the good word but they're not preachers amen why cuz they get off the word of God he said let God do the calling see so in brother's day he said all these people seeking things but they were they were claiming things or trying to pull things out of God brother said just let God do the calling God will call you God will sanctify you God will give you what he what he'll I'm sorry what he has need to give you you can't bargain for Grace amen he's still in that thought you can't bargain say God make me a preacher make me a millionaire that's how these people get millionaires they sell their souls to the devil I just seen another video on all these people Katy Perry Bob Dylan uh Kanye West said he sold his soul for the devil To Be A Millionaire or whatever billionaire whatever they are they sell their souls out see because they want to be something that God's not called them to do thank God we've given our souls to Jesus Christ Hallelujah right we didn't sell our souls but we accepted his love in our Souls amen we gave ourselves over to him Jesus is the one who sold himself into sin hallelujah amen he's the one that took all your sins all my sins on him he's the one that made his soul an offering for sin Hallelujah and our souls can now be born again hallelujah amen can't bargain for Grace you can't be sold it can't be bargain for nor can it be bought can't be traded for you can't say well now Lord I'll just go join this great big Baptist Church or some big I'll just say message church now he says Methodist but I'll say message or this big Pentecostal church or this big nazarine church I'll do this if you'll just do this for me see remember some people are called to be rich and some people are called to be what poor it's not your choice it's God's choice see talking about money and influence oh give me this gift so I can be a big guy give me this gift so I can be a big woman somewhere well what about if God needs a little Outpost in akan Ohio with maybe 20 people there would you be willing to do that servant of God yes sir yes Lord yes Lord whatever you have for me I'm nobody you save me I didn't save myself I don't care what my life uh I don't care my my net worth as long as I have the worth of Jesus Christ blood amen that's that's only not worth I'm counting amen how many uh Heavenly possessions do we have well at least we know we have eternal life hallelujah amen we got a uh we got a theophany waiting over there a house Eternal not made with hands waiting in the heavens hallelujah how valuable is that church can any can anybody put a a a a net a net value on that praise God or net worth who can put a net worth on a on a theophany body ah it's without number it's without money or cost amen hallelujah brother said it can't be bargained no sir all that the father has given me will come to me and no man can come to me except my father calls him first remember you can you can have all the gifts without the love of God let's go to 1 Corinthians uh 13:1 just as a familiar reading I got yeah I got at least half hour I can preach by God's grace now the word profit means to be useful or have an advantage 1 Corinthians 13:1 do I speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity I become as a a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol just a noise maker noise maker noise maker noise maker right so think most churches are like this they just make noise they don't have the real love of God to believe the word of God Jesus said if you love me what you do keep the commands not take words out of the Bible you keep all the words in the Bible amen like brother said you do exactly what the word says word for word that's what God's looking for a church that'll take the word of God word by word exactly with the word praise God two you're so good and though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries which we do I I still want to preach a sermon on this we understand all the Mysteries if it's called a mystery we know what it is because there's only 12 of them it's pretty easy there's only 12 that are actually called Mysteries and we know all of them so this is speaking directly to us even if you understand all the 12 New Testament Mysteries or some people say 11 whatever you want to say I didn't say thus say the Lord and all knowledge and so you see understand that's understand you understand everything in the Bible everything in the message which is the word of God that's being revealed today it's not just every word on the tape it's the scriptures being fulfilled today praise God I got 30 verses on that and I have all Faith so I could remove all the mountains of my life I can just speak to every obstacle whether it's building a church or getting over the government or or speaking to fig trees or whatever it is I can speak to storms if I can do all that and I don't have charity I'm nothing right and charity is in the Greek it means affection or benevolence which is well-meaning or kindness amen you just want the well or you just want good for everybody else you don't want to fight against people divide people uh uh pit people against each other you just want the best for everybody oh Hallelujah that's charity amen so let's ask ourselves that as a message church I'm probably getting into my sermon then what I want to preach you know kind of preaching it again or preaching it early so I can understand all the Mysteries as message people but is my heart for all the other message people and non- message people is my heart is my heart saying I want the best for them or do I wish they would receive judgments of God that should give us a good idea if we got the love of God now don't get me wrong there are times where you know Paul Paul said that Alexander he'll get what God's got for him you he's going to be judged there are times where God can reveal to you that's not some talk about maybe so much but in most cases we got we have to think we want the best for people boy I sure hope they get forgiveness I sure up they get over this depression I sure up they get over this uh lust I sure up they get over this greed and the church said like you want the best for people that's charity well-meaning it's also called a love Feast so see you have you provide food everybody come on in and eat you just you just want to help people you just want to be good to people people amen hallelujah it means dear love dear love kindness affection right all right so we can see that so it it it doesn't profit us verse three yeah the word Prophet must be in verse three is it and though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give uh my body to be burned now remember even this year Church there was a Democrat guy who burned his body right there uh by the Supreme Court if I'm not mistaken cuz he was upset about some ruling they had about President Trump he burned his body for the Democratic party but the Bible said if he didn't do in love it doesn't profit him anything see that people people think this will this this shows my real love but that's not real love and have not charity it doesn't profit me anything did that guy want the best for Donald Trump you don't have to answer that do he want the best for Joe Biden let's bring it to let's bring it down home who you want the best for Camala Harris Let's Move On brother says see you just if you if you say God make me this and God I'm gonna pull this out of you uh I'm gonna force you to give me this gift or whatever you know they don't say Force but make make me speak in tongues or make me a preacher or whatever make me a prophet but said you just become a member of that big church that's all you won't be saved Grace has to save you amen our talent doesn't save us our talents that we have cannot earn Grace by talents right Judas was talented in other words gifted he could cast out Devils heal the sick raise the dead read Matthew 10 if you haven't lately he could do all those things but he lost salvation because you're not saved by gifts you're saved by grace amen hallelujah you have to accept God's grace for your life Hallelujah if God made me a preacher that don't show his grace has been with me no no it's his grace alone that saved me not because I preach the gospel I'm saved no not because you speak with tongues you're saved no not because you preach not even saved just because you preach you're not saved because you speak with tongues you're not saved because you do any of these things 1 Corinthians 13 proves so though I speak with tongue of men and angels though I understand all the mysteries of God a preacher though I do all this and have no I'm sorry have faith to move mountains I am nothing until charity comes in which is love love is Grace gra the grace of God does it all amen I love this message it's a great sermon here by God's grace this a this a masterpiece if we ever heard one amen the the message of Grace it's only a short sermon it's only uh it's only like an hour I got the numbers down here later it's only like an hour and 40 I think and then he prays for like 30 minutes afterwards he said God's grace cannot be bargained for Talent cannot be bargained for it's Sovereign Grace nothing and he quotes he quotes A Hymn nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling and the church said see not not God you make me this no I just come to the I just come I just come to Jesus clinging to the cross I don't come saying make me a big somebody make me Rich make me famous make me part of a big church make me popular uh no just come and take hold of the cross of Jesus Amen Hallelujah and and take up your cross and someday you'll lay it aside and you'll receive a crown someday I'll receive a crown you'll receive a crown by God's grace brother said wait uh naked wounded I just come to him as I am just as I Am Without One Plea but that thy blood was shed for me and that thou bids me come to thee Oh Lamb of God I come he quotes the P the I'm sorry the hymn now let's briefly go through this nine gifts briefly the word of wisdom now I got these in my book in the 12 New Testament Mysteries book it's been a while since we went over this is basically sound advice and it's discretion And Timely decision making Jesus said wisdom is Justified of her children so a gift of wisdom will be manifested by the results if you gave somebody a Word of Wisdom you'll see what happens they'll come back and say that was the right thing to do at the right time Jesus gave a word of wisdom about paying taxes to Caesar but also giving money to God that was the right thing at the right time produce the right results right Rome didn't come down and kill you because you didn't pay your uh pay your taxes the wise virgin prepared extra oil in the case of the bridegroom carried while the foolish virgin neglected it that was wisdom because it's very timely look if you don't got the oil you're missing the the bridegroom's coming timely wisdom prepare oil because there's a there's a time you have to be ready at the right time Paul shared that his belief in the resurrection in front of the divided angry Jewish Council saved his life and in Acts 23 it was the right word of wisdom at the right time saved his life he had to have it there or they were going to the Mob was going to kill him remember that Word of Wisdom he brought up this issue and divided the crowd and then he could get out amen hallelujah now I and then I give examples from our church a minister said I gave him a Word of Wisdom on how to handle extracurricular activities of his children because another preacher wrongly accused him of being a bad father and that brother called me up and said you gave me the word of wisdom brother Jesse I need that word at that time because I've been accused of being an unfit father another brother said I gave him a word of wisdom to continue in his ministry when he was he said he came to that church that I still remember that morning too I came to his church and I preached and he said that morning he decided I'm not going to preach anymore and my whole sermon was on being diligent with your gifts I remember I looked right at him I I remember I looked right at him and I said brother you keep preaching God's word something long time I said you keep investing God will bless it Hallelujah and he repented he said I a word of wisdom right after that Hallelujah now I wish I had some more of those amen right I I wish I could just double them all the time right but see it's not the right thought on gifts it means we're more yielded for it right and then God can use us in the future that's what it means you Faithfully invest in it and God can use it in the future now the word of knowledge is um understanding when you understand something now the ones we know tongu interpretation those are going to be really easy to talk about um but the understanding Jesus calls understanding a key of knowledge I'm sorry yeah he calls knowledge a key of understanding and a key a word of knowledge helps you enter into something you didn't you couldn't see before right so when you have knowledge you can enter into something now I see it and it's got to be the Bible knowledge right it won't be something outside the Bible it's got to be in the Bible so Peter and Philip gave scriptural knowledge they cited Joel to 28 and Isaiah 53 allowing 3,000 souls to get saved and baptized and the Ethiopian unic to enter in the door of Salvation amen he gave them the key the scriptures this is talking about Jesus this is talking about Joel praise God Amen and now they could enter into the baptism of the Holy Ghost or enter into salvation they could enter into something praise God Amen now I also believe that brother Dennis and brother uh Ben and even brother Paul and brother Aaron gave us some of these words of understanding and discernment judging Spirits right because what they what what did brother denst preach on Spirits right I still remember the titles I don't know why this is a special weekend the perfect man tame in the tongue Spirit of a tail Bearer Spirit of resentment I've never heard a preacher take titles of evil spirits never in 20 24 years in the message I've never heard that that was so Discerning right I mean right he fasted all week prayed all week he he didn't even fellowship with us on Saturday so he could bring the word he wanted to be so consecrated to God hallelujah Acts 19 Paul opened the door of baptism to the 12 Ephesian Believers see they needed a a word of know they needed knowledge they need to know there is a holy ghost and a new baptism amen our lord Jesus Christ baptism and when he did that what happened the Holy Ghost fell right on them after they were baptized they entered into something by understanding the word hallelujah like I told you uh did I write it yeah yeah when I was trying to overcome tobacco I couldn't overcome it until I saw 1 Corinthians 6:12 which says I will not be brought under the power of any and that verse was a key to me I oh now I understand now I don't have to keep chewing tobacco I'm under the power of it but I don't have to be praise God and now I could enter into my deliverance and I've been in this room ever since I like this room I'm not going I'm not leaving this room I like this room it's a clean room amen it's a nice room it's a cheaper room too by God's grace sure was a cleaner room I know that I'm sure my wife appreciates that too Hallelujah and then I said my wife gave me a word of knowledge I shared with a struggling brother now you know this brother Brian Hawkins about whether he could be both a preacher and a deacon and when I gave that verse it said him free he cried on the phone I still remember him crying on the phone and he's free been free ever since he entered into that freedom through a scripture word of knowledge faith is a substance it's an inner substance it's power it's God's desire and power to move obstacles problems sicknesses adversaries sometimes called mountains metaphorically okay Jesus said the Roman cian's Faith was a great faith it moved the mountain for his servants healing Paul and a crippled man in elisher both had faith for healing causing Paul to L loudly command the man to walk for the first time Faith God's will I know God's will I have a revelation of God's will it's going to move this Mountain's going to move now or it could even be this Mountain's gonna move tomorrow or you know something something powerful right it's Faith it's G to happen right that's you have faith you you have the Revelation you have uh the substance you know because you have the substance you know what's going to happen praise God all right okay this was about Jose and I Jose when we went to pray for that that couple and his family Jose said God heard your prayer and you're going to have a child and I was really nervous in that moment but God God didn't give me that faith God gave Jose that Faith uh the next November that baby was born on my birthday that was Faith he pronounced it right there and I was like I'm really nervous brother Jose Ro crying he's got his acoustic guitar playing I was kind of nervous but God brought it to pass one morning I spoke to that uh mountain of baress and not many days after that I got the text saying we're pregnant and then then they had the baby and then she I said I met her out there in in in robex uh by the by the dog coffee shop there in fairon what is it the the Sleepy Dog Coffee Shop I can't remember the name of that what is it nervous dog we're right there I'm right before school I run into her and she said I just had a dream about you that you prayed for us again and we had a child well we I prayed for her and then she had twins all right praise God whatever Hallelujah I'm just I don't know why in your dreams and what just God's grace I don't know I don't know I me I I remember I went to house to a Bible study I and I people even laughed at me that I said uh that we have mind battles we can cast down spirits and and uh the devil gets in your mind people were people were laughing at me in that Bible study I just took it like a took it like a saint I'm like well I'll tell her later I'll share the verse later I just sat there and got laughed at and rebuked well we see who's laughing now I'm I'm laughing I'm laughing Joy now right God has h their prayers amen hallelujah oh yeah and that one time uh there was a critical couple in this church I stood by their chair on a Saturday a it was after a brother had preached that we can command evil spirits it might have been Brian Hawkins I don't know one of these brothers I I was praying right here on a Saturday and that came to me I thought well I'm going to rebuke that evil spirit I rebuke I went right to their chairs right back there I rebuke that chair in the name of Jesus Christ I command that Spirit to leave 11 days later they left I said it's going to go in the name of Jesus Christ I had Faith to speak it and God backed it up and then one of them repented to me about for five things they did against me God's God's word is always right and then Cam's hunting trip cam told that brother you speak whatever you want he said I want an eight point buck he got it the next day that's Faith Cam said it hasn't happened since cam he keeps he keeps reminding of us though you you don't know what's going to happen you's got to be led by the Holy Spirit now I know for sure cam was really seeking God during that time CU I don't think think he was married yet yeah he wasn't married yet cam was in the word all the time preaching studying he was staying the word of God and God led him to speak that and the brother called him up and said hey brother cam he said uh how you enjoying that eighto buck he said it's it's wonderful brother cam Hallelujah I like that now guess a healing remember uh Saul's mental torment was cast out by David's music that's why music's important right if You' ever been uh delivered from music that's the healing in our our musicians Ministries that's the gift of healing you ever got joy ever got Victory ever got peace through the song that's the gift of healing you can also be healed naturally I wonder how many times my wife has help me with this because figs were used to heal boils in Ezekiel I'm sorry in 2 Kings 20:7 and Isaiah 38:21 sometimes there's a natural healing through uh you know God's plans Jesus said said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's a way for healing two women I prayed for that said they couldn't move their arms after I prayed for them uh said they could brother Jim told me about one of them and then the sister that was here always can never remember her name Tanya thank you I know I can never remember she's like brother Jesse I love your preaching but I just want to keep cutting my hair she said I like having short hair she said I know it's the word of God but I just want to have short hair I said well sister just pray about it and we see what happen is that is that something they know it people know it Church know you know that was really sweet of her to drive all that but you know comes down it comes down to the word you love the word or don't you love the word okay you you know most of these um get some Miracles is something that happens immediately casting out demons is called a miracle in Mark 83839 I've seen that at least seven I think six times I always get that number mixed up um Jesus caused a lame man to walk and leap by the hand of Peter and John in Acts three handkerchiefs that are given out and healing comes uh that's Acts 19 11 through2 that's called a miracle a special Miracle the Bible calls that my mother was healed of cancer when my dad rebuked the the spirit there she still alive today uh praying for that sick woman in Guyana I prayed for her and the the um the kidney stone instantly left as she sat back there and held her baby and praised the Lord and she come up so happy crying weeping after the service prophecy is foretelling the future brother brandom says if there's no prophet in the land he said God will give you prophecies through dreams right dreams and also just a word from the Lord like I believe the Lord is going to do this I believe this is and you don't have to say thus sayth the Lord you can say this is from the Lord and then if it comes to pass it's a prophecy now for us most time it's going to be a dream all right Jesus for told Peter's three denials agabus prophesied of a famine and don't forget we're coming up on another election in 2020 all those preachers said Trump was going to win with thus sayi the Lord and they all missed it Liars false prophets now I'm going to listen to him hopefully I'm gonna listen to him in the next few months here and I know exactly what they say probably be the opposite now probably right probably because God might I mean they got a 50% chance right a clock's right at least twice a day my wife says clocks r at least twice a day right it' be it'd be a good deception too J it'd be a good deception for that uh last day deception the Antichrist remember they're all going to unite through music remember uh remember uh Shad M abedo what was it music they're all going to have the same Christian music right they're all G that's how they're all that's they're already uniting that way right maybe I should say that maybe I'll hold the that Brandon Lake thing my brother went to a Brandon Lake and Phil Wickam concert and my brother said Brandon Lake was Pro LGB whatever QT whatever that scares me so we got to pray got to pray for people like that that's if you accept that the Bible says you have a reprobate mind that means a rejected mind now can God deliver of course we we remember we had uh MJ come he got delivered I don't know why he stopped I I keep texting him he never text me back probably change his number but we have to be mindful of those things mindful uh Philip had four virgin daughters who prophesied and in 2013 a pastor friend of mine to foretold the passing of the way of numerous preachers he said there'll be many uh well-known preachers in the message passed away that year I think there was four of the biggest names in the message Joseph Coleman Lonnie Jenkins couple others I can't remember now might have been Perry green might have been some of the biggest names of the message that year died and then my wife and I have we believe have had prophetic dreams that came to pass almost exactly or uh spiritually symbolically like I told you about the guy uh about tennis and games and then I told him about it and then I it was a spiritual dream with symbol spiritual symbolism but then naturally he's there on Facebook playing tennis with his shirt off his wife is sexy dressed after leaving the message like look like wearing a bikini and left the message and I told him Advance it's going to happen my wife told his sister are you're going to cut your hair and wear your pants or was it just pants shorts shirts she laughed about it said oh I'll never wear shorts few years later she's wearing shorts and really in almost insane almost insane see it just takes we just got to stay true to the Holy Spirit I'll say like this you got to have the courage to tell somebody when you have a dream like I've told people dreams that I was shaking when I told them now they haven't come to pass yet so I don't know if they're right or not but I dream of a precious brother doing something really awful I had to tell him I I don't know I hope it don't come to pass but I prayed about it I fast about it wait on the Lord see that's a spirit of what Spirit of Prophecy right and if you don't know just say I don't know this is just what happened I'm just saying it humbly now Discerning of spirits that's judging where the where the word comes from is it from God or from Satan that's that's what discernment is Salon used discernment to reveal the good intentions of the real mother of the baby when another woman falsely claimed it to be the mother right he he judged the spirits he gave a word and that word judged which side they were on Jesus discerned Nathaniel's guess Spirit and the woman at the Well's sexual immorality with six men Jesus discerned that go get your husband I don't have any I know how many you had six right the one you're living with now is I'm sorry you had five the one you're living with now not not your husband see he he discerned it he judged it Peter exercised discernment by by revealing anan's secret lie and Simon the sorcerer's Wicked heart condition Peter discerned that Paul says Sinners will recognize God's spirit is in a local church when the secrets are revealed through the gifts of Prophecy interpretation and discernment amen glory amen when we have these preachers come in and it discerns a situation or discerns something going on church we can say the spirit of God is here amen hallelujah that's how I know that's that's how I'll just say like that's how I can keep coming back to church and being a pastor of a small church because I know God's spirit is with me because those that come against me not every time but almost every time their Folly is exposed that's why sometimes I'll tell you about it so you know right and then I'll tell you all the good things too amen the hard things aren't always the fun things to talk about but it proves it judges which side you're on praise God Amen it judges the spirit of truth because that's the Holy Ghost Hallelujah Spirit of Truth like I said you know how many miracles do you need uh until you have enough until you have enough Supernatural how how many do you need see what you need is the spirit of Truth and then God will give you as many miracles as he wants you to have praise God but if you don't have the spirit of truth then you just got gifts and you might be lost you might not be saved because if you're saved you'll obey the word of God hallelujah and you'll stand with the spirit of truth I didn't mean to preach like this this God I think it's 8 o'clock so I'm about done by okay and then we've had dreams in our church that discern certain situations very helpful and then other other other dreams uh and Discerning people's Spirits right we've had other things like that I'm not going to get into that one too much of now diverse kind of tongues and interpretation those are the nine gifts so is that a good review by God's grace just review brother brother Ben talked about it now Church you don't worry about you don't worry about well do I have enough gifts has God used me enough in my gifts that you don't worry about that may God help us not to worry about that you just have to say God I want to be a yielded yielded vessel I want to be a vessel of Honor so you can use me at the right time and season am it's not everyday's Miracles not everyday's mountain tops there's a lot of valleys we got to walk through right like I told the church uh since 2018 we had a season of peace right was that six years that's a pretty good season I'll take six years of peace and love and happiness and God's love and joy and everybody dancing and shouting and praising God I'll take that amen any day praise God but then sometimes Trials Come sometimes tests come how Hallelujah and so you got to stand on what you got to stand on this word for word that's the test but said give that person the word test so in other words we got to go through the word test too I got to pass the word test I got to take all my life life situations back to the word hallelujah you got it amen everybody got it good everybody got that I know you got it I'm just happy because to God's grace amen okay let me see I'm going look at my notes anything to close on here I think I got to most of it yeah it just worked out perfectly I had all this I had all this backsliding sermon but I'm going to save that for Sunday by God's grace now brother R preaches he he does an altar call he tells that story of the King's son that I shared last week he closes with that he's done preaching at an hour 27 um but there's still 48 minutes left so he does the altar call he sings for 13 minutes and then for the last last 26 minutes he talks about Jesus's discernment in Luke I'm sorry in John 1 with with Nathaniel in John 4 with um the woman at the well and he's getting the people ready because he's going to do discernment back at the Brandon Tabernacle he hadn't done it there for a while and so he's teaching the people again about how discernment Works Hallelujah and he he goes to how Jesus the high priest of our confession the woman at the well story who touched me story in other words you're you're LED God will lead you to pull that gift out or got to lead you to get that blessing right God let God gave her the Revelation and it led her to go touch Jesus she already had the Revelation amen see that and what is that that's a gift of faith there it is there it is the woman had a gift of faith she had faith if I can just touch him I'll be healed praise God like Johnny if I can just come up for prayer brother Jesse can rebuke that demon and the swelling it'll get better and it did hallelujah it's a revelation gift of faith and then at the 2 hour and six minute Mark brother brother said I only want strangers to pull on the gift for discernment and he says I'm stalling because I'm waiting for him because it's a different anointing than preaching discernment was a different anointing and that and that at the two hour and seven minute mark one minute before it's over he says the angel is here the angel of the Lord is here then he starts Discerning people talk about a great service amen you just heard the message of Grace amen alter call there's people that got saved and brother R said now he said you that that are saved uh he said stand up shake your hand he said everybody go and shake their hands and tell them you'll be praying for him and you want to see him back in the church glory amen hallelujah and then he preaches for 30 uh some more minutes it says now the Angel's here he's here to discern he starts Discerning people people get healed how many thankful for God's grace brother Ram had an angel just like Moses had an angel commissioned by an Angel and Paul had an angel that angel was commissioned to be with them because they were messengers of the Covenant amen hallelujah how was brother a messenger of the Covenant God was restoring the faith of that Covenant Revelation 1070 come down with a rainbow rainbow represents Covenant God's restoring the promises of the New Testament Covenant at the end time he's restoring the New Testament Faith he's finishing the mystery of God he's turning our hearts back to the apostolic fathers amen let's stand to our feet Malachi can come and or L sorry hallelujah how many appreciate God for his grace I hope something was said tonight as I as just before I came out here I felt that was the direction God wanted me to go with gifts because we had it preached to us this last weekend don't put pressure on yourself for a certain gift but yes it's a good idea to seek God for a gift right covet earnestly the best gifts pray God send us a prophecy God give us a a discernment God give us a a a healing those things are good to seek after we just don't want to say God I have to have this I have to be this type of person with this much money I have to be I have to be this go to this big church or something like that just be thankful that God saved you praise God and just be open to saying God make me whatever you want me to be no matter how famous or how little I am you know and I hear these famous messages preachers they say it's not all easy all the time the more influence you have also the more responsibility you have right I think we understand by God's grace how many understand let's bow our hearts here as we pray oh just a wonderful atmosphere I appreciate everybody having a good atmosphere and pulling on the word of God nobody fell asleep tonight nobody's uh giving me smirks nobody's uh nobody's staring me down with Angry Eyes like I've had sometimes in the past so I appreciate that and that's when God's spirit can really move just in the Simplicity Jesus said if two or three are there there I am in the midst Jesus Christ is here tonight I believe with all my heart father God we thank you for today Lord God thank you for this opportunity Lord we trust in God our savior the one who will never fail us Lord God lord I've been here at the post of Duty 18 years I've never seen you fail me Lord nothing could ever fail Lord if you're behind it Lord God usually Lord I just got to wait for your time and season there are times I failed you Lord so I know I've always asked forgiveness for that Lord God but I know you have never failed Hallelujah Lord help our hearts to be so humble tonight that we don't try to get the gift that we want or get the certain social status or financial status that we want help us to covet the best gifts and help us to covet the perfect will of God lord and now remember godliness with contentment is a great victory in our lives character is not a gift Glory character is a victory and power without character is satanic gifts without the right character could be satanic like balum we can clearly see with balum yes his gifts operated but the gifts also led him into this position of teaching false things the doctrine of balum to the Israelites to get them to commit fornication so so Lord you'd have to punish them his gifts help let him lead him astray Lord God oh Lord God help us Lord Jesus to never make ourselves a stuff sh to try to exalt ourselves into some ministry that's not ours Lord God but help us also Lord to covet the best gifts as the scripture tells us we know your prophet pointed us to the word of God he wasn't perfect but in his major doctrines and many minor doctrines Lord he pointed us directly to the word of God which I'm thankful for Lord God I always be thankful for it my life is based upon that Lord God the prophet of God pointing us back to the scripture fulfilling Revelation 10:7 Luke 17:30 ma Matthew 17:11 Hallelujah glory to God really Joel 223 through 26 Lord God Amos 3:7 Lord God Deuteronomy 29:29 these Mysteries

made True To Me Lord God it's been proven to me over and over and again Lord God that you never left me you never forsake me if anybody leaves anybody it's me leaving you because of my own sin Lord my own failure sometimes you never left me Lord God you never left anyone in this church Lord God because you said I'll never leave you never You'll Never Take Your Eye Off us you'll never take your hand of Mercy from us Lord God nothing can separate us from your love dear God thank you for such matchless love Lord God we love you tonight Lord God thank you for this message that your Prophet preached
