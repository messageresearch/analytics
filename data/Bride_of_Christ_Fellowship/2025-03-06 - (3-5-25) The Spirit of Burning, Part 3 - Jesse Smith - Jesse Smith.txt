TRANSCRIPT
========================================
of burning tonight luk 2413 Luke 24:13 so part three on the spirit of burning so I had most of all these uh scriptures and quotes ready to preach that first Sunday when I preached on it but I didn't get hardly anywhere where I wanted to uh but now you're starting to see the and I'm starting to see it too I'm starting to see the thoughts of the Lord opening up here as we look at these three examples so far we looked at Isaiah and Jeremiah tonight we'll look at Copus and his friend here by God's grace Jeremiah 24:13 Hallelujah so I'll read 13 and 14 then we can all read 15 together here the Bible says and behold two of them went that same day to a village called emus which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs or about seven miles and they talked together of all these things which had happened verse 15 if we could read that on three one two three and it came to pass that while they communed together and reason Jesus himself Drew near and went with them amen uh if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God here we'll have one more word of prayer father God we love you we know that you've made us your friend you've called us you've chosen us before the foundation of the world you've ordained us to hear the truth to be your bride to be the wise virgin Lord God we know all these scriptures we know all these stories we're so thankful Lord you've called us to be the elect the chosen Lord God we're so grateful for that Lord God we see how this message is a higher calling as our brother talked to us Lord on Sunday and preach to us Lord God it's the high calling of God in Christ Jesus so we're grateful Lord God and we ask Lord that the spirit of burning would be here tonight Lord to help those who need it Lord God I'm sure each one of us would say we need it Lord God so you saw the hands that were up I pray You' minister to all the saints Lord look past my my my frailties Lord and my tiredness I pray and I pray just the Holy Spirit would have prants here tonight let this word Lord speak to us for there's only real really one preacher that's you the Lord Jesus may your spirit have full preeminence in this service and we'll be happy when we leave this place in Jesus Christ's name the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated Hallelujah so we'll start a timer here by God's grace so looking at part three here of the spirit of burning we may have a part four we'll kind of see how it goes by God's grace but in part one we looked at the how the spirit of burning comes after the spirit of judgment and uh Isaiah first judge himself unclean he said I'm a man of unclean uh lips and I dwell amongst a people of unclean lips and I think we could all say that uh we're people that dwell amongst people of unclean thoughts right we all have unclean thoughts at times we all have unclean actions right we all have unclean words at times we're people that dwell amongst each other right we're the ones that need the Holiness of God hallelujah when when Peter said be holy he wasn't saying uh you're going to be perfect but he said walk in the spirit right and if the if you're walking in the spirit you won't obey the things of the flesh right as Paul said as well so uh we know the spirit of God does that for us the spirit of God brings judgment helps us see where we are in our current walk with God and then if we're not where we should be the spirit of judgment helps us to confess our sins and then the spirit of burning comes and gives us an experience to make us clean to wash us how many like when you feel washed after you leave church how about in your home when you have a good prayer time in your home when you feel clean right or a good fellowship or a good worship time in your home or you're reading your Bible and something really strikes you and helps you uh that's what the spirit of burning does it gives you a in in this case it gave him a start to his ministry and as we looked at Jeremiah it gave him the grace to continue his ministry when he felt like quitting in the darkest of his hours and maybe some of us have been there before where you felt like quitting and no longer talking about God no longer witnessing and yet God would in his grace would come by and give you the strength to keep going Hallelujah it's just the love of God isn't it church it's just the love of God this could be of course justification and sanctification but we know despite our most difficult struggles God's spirit will keep us from leaving the truth hallelujah like Jeremiah and brother brandham Hallelujah God will keep us from leaving the truth so the spirit of God put Jeremiah into service um I'm sorry Isaiah sorry the spirit of one of these minutes I'm going to snap out of this here the the spirit of burning put Isaiah into service started his ministry and then the spirit of burning kept Jeremiah in service kept him from quitting uh and he was able of course to cry out to God and tonight we'll look at Copus and his friend and I want you to think what does the spirit of God uh the spirit of burning help them do and then I'll give you my thoughts at the end now I'm just doing my best to say this I don't have a quote or thus sayth the Lord but I'm trying to understand this all right so Luke we read Luke 24 13 and 14 uh this was on the same day of course of the Lord's Resurrection brother Bram said that was the greatest day in human history when with Jesus conquered death Hell In The Grave hallelujah we're coming up on it by God's grace and brother Ram said The woman there the women received the greatest message that could ever be given and that was he's not dead He's Alive Hallelujah he is risen just as he said No Greater message in the world than that Hallelujah so we know Jesus Christ is alive today how many know he's alive amen hallelujah they were given the greatest message that could ever be given they left Jerusalem there in verse 13 to go to a little village called EMAs and history says it wasn't that great of a village um one time in history it wasn't long after this that uh the ruler there I forget I don't know the exact ruler but he gave AAS over just as a village he gave it over just to the soldiers occupy so it was so small that uh a number of soldiers could fill up that Village wasn't a very special place we'd say uh so three score furlongs or about seven miles 11 kilometers um and if you're if you're walking at a speed of 3 miles per hour which is the average walking speed on a normal Road you get there in about two to 2 and half hours but looking at how they were talking as we see here in the scripture they're talking about all the events of the past weekend right the uh the Last Supper they're talking about uh the arrest the trial uh the crucifixion uh the quiet Saturday and then the resurrection and all this all these events happening that morning of the Resurrection they prob weren't walking very fast I don't know about you but when you go for a walk when I go for a a walk with my wife there in the park and we're talking about something real serious we don't walk too fast right and so uh they so it's it's estimated they could have been talking from two to three hours maybe a little more somewhere wrong along that uh amount of time so that gives you an idea about how long they were talking and what how long Jesus preach to them praise God so I love that Jesus came out of the uh the shadow somewhere and starts preaching to them praise God now Copus if you're not familiar he's the father of uh St James and it's James the Lesser as far as I know there's at least three James that's a good name Vang picked out for brother or Little James there by God's grace it's a really great Bible name so cleff is is the father of James the Lesser he's the Lesser known James the other James was more well known James and John the sons of thunder right their mother went up to Jesus and said can my son sit on the right and left hand and then all the disciples look at them why you tell your mom to do that you know why why you think you're better than us why you got to act like you're a better somebody better than us but but I'll say like this at least they had a desire to be by Jesus's side right so there there's some good in that they just needed the Holy Ghost to clean out their desires amen hallelujah but this was the Lesser James this wasn't even the James uh that wrote the book of James that was another James a different James so there's at least three very uh prominent men named James in the early church there's probably more but as far as my studies In My Memory uh that's uh that's what we're finding here so this Copus would have known his son James left everything that he had known and followed Jesus for three and a half years and so I don't we don't know how often Copus saw his son the James the ler but if he did he would have heard the most amazing Stories Hallelujah so many stories you couldn't even write books to fill up the whole earth about about these stories he had he saw all the stories he saw Jesus walk on water the dead raised and funerals broken up Hallelujah Lazarus come forth he saw all the greatest Miracles right no which Miracles no one can even reproduce today right there's never been someone raised from the dead on the third day Hallelujah after the third day there never been done Jesus did the greatest Miracles because he was God in flesh Hallelujah and so uh Copus here he walking with a friend we don't know who it is there's lots of debate who it is I have no idea uh who it was but Copus as the father of one of the disciples would have known and uh a lot about Jesus and uh so they they start upon their Journey they're in a great St state of confusion we're going to see it later they're in a great state of sadness you would think on uh you would think on the greatest day ever that they'd have the greatest emotions but that was going to come a few hours later by the grace of God hallelujah I love how God likes to keep us in suspense sometimes Hallelujah God church God only gives us what we have need of at the right time when we need it he won't give us anything before that it'll always be at just the right time in fact as we'll see here God withheld so much from them because God's trying to get them to believe him Hallelujah so see God will only reveal things to us when we need it Hallelujah and yes he wants us to seek after it but there's also a time where yes God will give us things when we seek it but then God will also withhold things until the right moment when we need needed the most kind of like the spirit of burning praise God and Jeremiah when we need it the most it has it just has to be withheld until the very moment of desperation God likes to see his children cry out like little CH little children Hallelujah right like our little babies cry out when they're little ones and whe it can be annoying but but it's it's their way to uh it's their way to get what they have need of and brother said God loves to hear you cry out like a little baby might not always sound the best right but when you're in a moment of desperation cry out to God God loves to hear you cry out to him Hallelujah now Luke 24:15 they now as they're walking it comes to pass while they commune together now commune just means to talk in the Greek now reason though they're communing and reasoning the word reason in the Greek is different it's investigate and question things so they're playing every uh scenario in their minds and well you saw this I saw that and then I heard this I heard that I heard Jesus say that and remember when he said that and they're just going through every scenario trying to understand what had actually happened over this uh we'd say Monumental weekend Hallelujah and so they spend uh a certain amount of time here walking before Jesus steps out and in verse 15 I love it the Bible says while they commune and so see Church even in the midst of your questions and even in the midst of you're trying to figure out your life even in the midst of being sad and maybe disappointed with your walk with God even in the midst of that even while you're you're you're struggling that's when Jesus comes to you he doesn't leave you alone in your questions he comes to answer your questions Hallelujah see I'm preaching to you right see I'm just telling you what he does that's what he does hallelujah I'm not telling you how he does it I'm just telling you he does it Hallelujah he comes to you when you're discouraged when you're talking and and you're not talking in faith like you you should right I'm saying we we are guilty of this come on where's your faith brother sister where's your faith see we're not always made to live on the mountain all the time that and church I'll tell you it'll help you appreciate the mountain tops more you'll enjoy when you go through a few valleys go through a through a few struggles questioning your faith wondering can you go on wondering how this is going to work out how could God be in this and you'll see then God will step out right into your very life Hallelujah glory to God Amen when you think he's furthest away and wondering and sad and discouraged that's when he'll show up in a powerful way Hallelujah that's that's right Hallelujah sometimes when you least expect it that's when he'll show up and of course this was least expected Jesus had died right and they all all they know is that they're leaving Jerusalem for whatever reason we don't even know why uh but they've left and then in verse 15 Jesus steps out I love this Jesus himself draws here that's how it is for you Jesus himself he sends the Holy Spirit to you hallelujah oh what a blessing amen he don't send a second Spirit or third third Spirit he sends the Holy Spirit to you Hallelujah verse 16 but their eyes were Holden that they should not know now why were their eyes holding because God didn't want them to know God wanted to give them an experience with the spirit of burning Hallelujah because they're in a sad they're in a defeated condition they're questioning everything oh did I was it my fault was it your fault well why didn't you stand up why didn't my son stand up why why did my son it was only John so even yes so even now James the Lesser James the Lesser wasn't at the cross either and he could have been beating up himself up oh my son was such a coward he could have been what kind of father am I you know I'm just kind of breaking into this you know just some of the Dynamics of this story didn't I raise my son the right way and how did this happen we believed him to be the Resto we're going to get to get to it in a little bit we believed he was going to restore Israel and now he's dead I'll just say there's a lot of sad talk going on Church don't give up on God during the sad times just keep talking about him because that's what they did they didn't let the sadness make them stop talking about Jesus uh or get you know or or just just say get I'm done with it I'm never going to talk about it again I'm leaving this thing no they just kept talking about Jesus and that's when Jesus came to them verse 17 so see church it's okay to investigate things in your mind try to question things figure things out it's okay God knows we're just human and God's purposely withholding from you to help I say like this adjust your character or form your character to be more Christlike to trust him like I'm telling that brother who's getting sued this is all so that you will trust him more right because none of us want to go through that none of us would volunteer for that but God's allowed it and everything works together for his good Hallelujah and so this is a moment here to learn to trust in God to watch God to wait on God how many times did Israel have to wait on God till God finally came upon the scene Hallelujah and so we must learn the same thing wait on God right and then as we wait our strength is renewed Hallelujah that's what the Bible said in the book of Isaiah I love I love this how Jesus talks here verse 17 and he said to them what manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad so they're sad walking it's not fast-paced walking it's sad walking for seven miles why you walking so sad sometimes my wife will notice if I'm discouraged or something I drive real slow on the road she's like why don't you speed up a little bit you're you know she says real nice right are you thinking deep about something oh yeah yeah let me break out of this let me get back to driving 55 again I'm driving like 45 down the highway I'm how's this going to work out and I love how Jesus comes out Jesus knows what they're thinking about Jesus knows what you're thinking about Hallelujah is that right he knows but then he wants the fellowship and I say like this he wants to hear our testimony he wants to hear us uh display our faith Hallelujah so he gives them a chance to share with him how they feel that's what prayer is all about it's just your chance to tell God how you feel about things like brother R said talk to God just like he's your friend if you could talk to somebody and just tell them what how things are going and you could really just sit down and have a cup of coffee or whatever just just quiet everything down what would you say to that best friend of yours or that Mentor that's how you talk to God just so simply because he's a he's a friend he's a he's a father he's a he's a savior Hallelujah he's our Lord our our ruler our husband all these titles that we give him hallelujah we're going to married land we're going to BU the land hallelujah we're going to the land of the married which is us we're married to Christ Glory Verse 18 and one of them whose name was Copus answered said unto him art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and Hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days so I like it he's asked a question and then he answers with the question don't you know what's been going on so obviously this whole event of Jesus crucifixion had been noised abroad just like the day of Pentecost right it been noised abroad uh the the man who was this young Prophet was thought to be a messiah had been crucified and it was a surprise right it was it was a shock it was a surprise they weren't expecting that Jesus had kept numerous feasts right even when he was 12 he went up to the Feast of Pentecost he all the Jews kept the feast but this was so unexpected uh within one week remember uh the uh from from the Palm Sunday when they're praising him as as son of David as they're as they're praising him Hosanna save us they're saying save us save us little did they know he'd save them by shedding his blood Hallelujah they wanted Jesus to save them from the Roman government but Jesus said I'm going to save you some from something better than that I'm going to save you from all your wretched sins Hallelujah that's right right so one week ago they're saying save us save us from from Rome and a week later now he's arrested beaten Scourge and he dies and sheds his blood in the most uh despicable human death of all time no one has ever been beaten like that no one ever could be beaten like that the Bible said he was less didn't he look like a man remember his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth couldn't get any uh perspiration even in his mouth he said I'm he said I'm less than a man I'm like a worm aluah that's how much he died for us aren't you glad he died for us hallelujah my goodness and so Copus asked the Lord Jesus aren't you aware of these things and then in verse 19 and then he said to them Jesus says what things he knows what the things are but he lets them testify God wants to hear you testify God wants to hear your voice and the church said God wants you to tell him what's on your heart what why are you so sad what are the hard things in life God wants you to tell him about it in prayer hallelujah or it could be in Fellowship too right this don't have to be prayer this can be Fellowship right how many know when you have a good Fellowship you feel like the spirit of God comes right there maybe you start crying or maybe you start praising God or maybe you just feel the sacredness that you don't Fe all the time that's what happened to them they're talking about all the events questioning but they're sad they're wondering how could this happen Jesus comes along Hallelujah he says what things verse 19 they said unto him concerning Jesus J of Nazareth which was a prophet now here it is I like I like their testimony he was a prophet Mighty in deed and word before God and all the people church let me tell you he said the right thing Hallelujah that's what you want to do you want to say the right thing Hallelujah he didn't say well he's a weak Prophet you know he's weak because he got crucified no no no they they recognize the spirit of God was on him Hallelujah the Bible said how God anointed Jesus Christ uh to heal them all that were sick he know anointed him with the Holy Ghost in John 10:38 Hallelujah and he did good going about healing all that were sick and Afflicted Hallelujah and this is the what they remember of the Lord Jesus his mighty power and his mighty words Hallelujah that's what we know about Jesus he's Mighty EMP power Mighty in words hallelujah oh that's right glory to God Amen and he did it before God and all the people in other words he did it before the invisible Spirit uh father and he does it before all the people people verse 20 and how the chief priests and the other rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him so we know he is mighty but then he was condemned and crucified verse 21 now I like this right here again we Jesus allows them to express their faith what did they believe about Jesus he was mighty in word mighty in deed and they trusted him in verse 21 they were trusting that it would been he which should have redeemed Israel and beside all this today is the third day since these things were done now look they got a good testimony Jesus is powerful Jesus has powerful words powerful Miracles how many know he's a miracle working God hallelujah amen put your situation in his hands one time and watch God move on the scene Hallelujah that's right amen and what does he say they said he's Mighty and we trusted him to redeem Israel now church I'm going to break into this later but they were trusting for the Millennium but it was 2,000 years or more off in the future they thought oh here's the Messiah it's in other words it's Millennial time but see they were blinded the Jews were blinded to the age of the Gentiles Hallelujah so that's what's happening here they think it's Millennium time well I remember I remember when I preached on the Millennium last last summer it was such a time of rejoicing for me like I can't wait for this time this is going to be the time of our lives Eternal lives amen we can travel like thoughts Hallelujah we can rule over cities we can bring uh the the people of the world into subjection you can build houses you can plant Vineyards and no one's going to break in no one's going to destroy anything and you never got to pay any rent either or mortgage it's just yours and and you don't you have to argue or fuss for it it's given to you by God it's your inheritance hallelujah what a time and this is what they're thinking of course they're seeing the Miracles well no doubt the millenniums coming in no doubt Jerusalem is going to be the uh the center of all worship and every nation is going to flow in here that's what they're thinking Millennium time but God thinking bride time I'm gonna get a bride through seven Church ages I'm gonna get a gentile bride because this Jewish bride is goingon to turn away and reject me so I've got to go to the people that had no laws I've got to give them laws I've got to go people that have no promises and he had to come to you and I to give us promises Hallelujah we were far off church but the blood of Jesus Christ has brought us nigh unto Christ hallelujah amen man they're they're like it's Millennium time and we're just like it's just time for us to get saved hallelujah it's time for us to come into the kingdom Hallelujah and to experience the the plan of God the word of God uh the kingdom of God in the spiritual sense first Hallelujah yeah they're waiting for Jesus to redeem Israel but in the political way not the not the religious way by sins forgiveness of sins Hallelujah that's right now how many trusting in Jesus to redeem the bride that's where we are today Hallelujah that's where we're at today we're trusting in Jesus to redeem the bride to help her escape the tribulation and to meet Christ in the air that's what we're trusting in Christ for today Hallelujah and that's what brother said brother said he said this Act exact word he said slug he said the church will just slug around who's seen a slug lately slow or fast Haven Victoria slow or fast slow there's one call brother said the church WIll slug along going back from meeting to meeting until the time of persecution uh we say the squeeze that'll bring the church together he said for the Rapture Hallelujah now our life is not sluggish but sometimes it feels like a sluggish we're not like slugs but sometimes it feel life is going slower why we go through this season why we go through that season you know i' I've been watching different revivals around the message they're starting to cool down just like happened to us just like happened to when my wife first life came in it was all Revival all the time long Services Mali Lydia sleeping as the services go past midnight and everything Casa sleeping you know we we've been through those long meetings the times of great times and Revival we go through Seasons God's training us God's testing us God's making our faith grow Hallelujah God's teaching us to serve him whether we're on the mountain or in the valley Hallelujah that's the kind of Faith he wants he wants us to have real real Faith no matter what we see or what we go through he doesn't want us to walk by sight he wants us to walk by faith Hallelujah walk by what is unseen Hallelujah not by what is seen we go through the seasons of Life verse 22 yay in certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the supper so they astonished us yet they're still sad because they hadn't seen Jesus so see look your testimony can only do so much for somebody but you should still always give your testimony right see there the women said he's alive I seen him right a Mary Magdalene I saw him but still it couldn't lift those men too high those big old Burly Men full of Faith couldn't believe a little woman shame up he Jesus calls them fools later they're fools they should have believed the sisters right now we don't get too many amens on that right because our sisters don't want to feel like they're against the brothers yeah yeah yeah amen amen praise you brother no it's just humbling for us because we all know that uh no matter what situation we would have been in we would have probably failed and we would have fell short too praise God because we see our daily shortcomings in our lives every day I need a help from the Lord to overcome every day I need to stir myself up and don't be foolish be wise today Hallelujah renew your mind think about the right things do the right things be faithful focus on God hallelujah verse 23 and when they found not his body they came saying that the that they had also seen a vision of angels which is said he was alive well this brother said he had a dream right this sister said she had a dream and well that brother had a vision and sister says she has a vision but I haven't had it and see Church there's nothing wrong with that if you're elect God will help you believe God's going to come to you to help you believe all that the father has given me will come to me Hallelujah the great Shepherd he leaves the 99 and he goes to get the one that's lost Hallelujah Glory if you're a child of God God's going to come find you he's going to speak to you he's going to prove that he's God to you Hallelujah because he did it for them that's right see Church sometime in your life Jesus is going to show you that he's the resurrected Christ you might have already had it our sister Naomi said she got the holy ghost at 13 what a tremendous testimony 13 knowing 13 that sets you up for a good life doesn't it sister as sooner the better get the Holy Ghost some of our little ones right claim they got the holy ghost at young age what a blessing the sooner the better Hallelujah but the point is everybody has to have a real experience where resurrection power is made known to you praise God and you're going to strive the rest of your life to live under that by the grace of God dying daily right like our brother even said Die daily like Paul on Sunday die every day live under the inspiration that he's alive he's resurrected he's real Hallelujah my life is in his hands he's here he cares for me he loves me he wants to fellowship with me Hallelujah GL well they had Visions they've had dreams Lord where's mine you just wait you just keep talking about Jesus Hallelujah keep fellowshipping about Jesus that's what they did they just went about whether they're leaving Jerusalem I don't know what happened here you know I if I'm not mistaken they're still under I think the Feast of unleavened bread was seven days if I'm not mistaken I have to look it up but they were still under the feast so they were leaving Jerusalem in the time of the feast so that gives us some more clues I have to go search that out but that kind of struck me now I thought they kept unleavened bread for seven days brother Chris I don't know that's why I'd have to look it up um now three times a year all the men had to come to the feast okay um that was uh I'm not if I'm not mistaken it was the uh Passover and then weeks uh and then Tabernacles so it was like it was like uh say March or April and then May and then October so for our for our way of thinking three times a year they had to come so I don't know how long they stayed though I don't know how long they had to stay they had to come and give sacrifices and pay their ties and everything like that um so that that' be a good that'd be a good study we can go look on that more by God's grace great question brother now look the the women had seen him they they said they saw Visions they had all these experiences but they hadn't had an experience with God yet verse 24 and certain of them which were with us went to the supplier and found it even so as the women had said but him they saw not okay so here's here's what they're sharing with Jesus we trusted him he's a mighty man of God power and word but then he was crucified and the women came but uh in other words they're just women right they're just women now look at verse 25 look at the words of our savior sometimes we think Jesus is so tender and sweet and he is but he also has a direct side too he's we I we like to call him gentle Jesus and maybe he said this very gently but look what our savior calls people who are discouraged sad and can't they can't even see they can't even believe other people's testimonies about him look what Jesus would call them now how would you feel if Jesus called you some of these words oh that's right he does yes he does remember the Holy Spirit told Brother B take your lying hands off that baby when when he had lied to the IRS and he tried to pray for the child the holy spirit said go make it right see God don't God doesn't play with sin is that right and here so if Jesus calls them this then it should have been enough for them to believe right because think about it church we believe yet none of us have seen Jesus I mean talking I'm talking about the resurrected body and then Jesus said blessed are you who haven't seen but still believe Hallelujah he said you're more blessed if you believe without sing Hallelujah Hallelujah I told you this before but I've had two people in the message mess uh one of them is from Al in Pennsylvania come up to me and say brother Jesse uh he said you're more blessed than I am I can always use you but thanks man you can get me back later at sparring okay but he said say brother Jack from Pennsylvania he says brother Jesse you're more blessed than I I'm like no brother no you got to be in brother Ram's meeting I'm like oh no no he actually saw brother Ram do prayer lines I'm like no brother no no you know I'm trying to hum myself he's my Elder too I'm like he's like 90 I'm like at that time I was probably 35 my brother no brother it's so blessed to have you and look how many years you've been married you've been faithful he's like no brother I got scripture brother Jesse and now now the guy's preaching to the preacher they love to do that brother Austin sister Lena they love to preach to the preacher I get a lot when I go other places they want to start preaching at me after I preach to them for four hours he says no I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you the scripture brother Jessie he takes me to John where Jesus says those exact words he said more blessed are the those who believe yet haven't seen and also I could say was yeah you're right brother Jack you're right he's like see I told you they always want to tell preachers because we don't know it all church but God knows it all Hallelujah but that is the truth you're more blessed to believe if you haven't had some Supernatural experience but God knows we need them sometimes you got to have one experience you got to have a Salvation at least and then at least that SP of judgment Spirit of burning and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that that's what you want you want at least three by God's grace Hallelujah remember even history even history says that Martin Luther had one powerful experience of justification and then Wesley was like we got a new they actually called it a new experience it's sanctification of heart and life and they were preaching like man you can go farther with God you can you you can actually get you can overcome your cigarettes or cigars like Martin Luther you can actually overcome they're like Glory it's Revival it was another experience with God and then zeusa Street came and that was uh speaking in tongues and the gifts but then they like oh no don't marry the the rapture's coming too soon see they got off on these little things but now the Holy Ghost is here and said you can be justified Sanctified you can have the gifts and you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can live all the word of God hallelujah what a blessing praise God and they were saying tongues of the heavens tongues of the heavens and we've seen people I've seen people my whole life in personate tongues tongues are not the evidence Hallelujah may God just give us a tongue to praise the Lord hallelujah just give me I say just give me a tongue of men to praise the Lord I don't have to have the tongue of angels although it'd be nice to speak in the tongue of angels but I just want to have a tongue that will give God praise Hallelujah Glory I'm not feeling so tired anymore that's usually what happens then my wife says like you're getting up in Heavenly places I'm like yeah I know that it's hard to come down once I'm in Heavenly places so look how Jesus talks to his beloved and then he said to them they look they've just poured out their hearts and it's in a sad way like oh you know the the women told us and we we didn't know what to believe and Jesus says oh fools that's a nice dinner that's a nice Walkin conversation right there right oh fools and slow of heart you're slow to believe all that the prophets have spoken so see they were only looking at those prophets like Isaiah 2 and Isaiah 11 about the Millennium they're only looking at those certain verses in there they're missing all the other ones church that's how we are we sometimes we only focus on so many scriptures how many know there's a lot of Bible verses there's over 100,000 Bible verses last time I looked a 100,000 some and so they're only focusing on a few there about the Millennium and oh the messiah's going to come restore Israel but that was over 2,000 years in the future and Jesus said oh fools you're slow of heart why does it take you so long to believe God's word and I'm preaching up myself tonight brother Jesse why does it take you so long to believe God's word because I'm just like these guys I'm a man just like Copus I'm a Daddy just like Copus right see Church you know honestly you know I mean you and I having faith for the rapture what kind of faith is that going to have to be to literally change our bodies now it's given by God right but right we have to have rapturing faith it's going to be anointing and if you had that Faith you'd be raptured right now you you why would you wait till tomorrow you'd be raptured right now if you had that Faith but we don't have that faith yet and so it's hard to imagine my what kind of faith is that going to have to have when there's going to be rumors about the government uh being able to persecute Christians and everything what kind of faith is that going to have to have it's going to be an amazing anointing and while now it may seem hard to understand or hard to to kind of feel that like brother R said it'll be ready when you get there it'll be waiting for you that latter rain will be there for you praise God because you want it because there's a deep call there's got to be a deep to respond praise God glory if you want to be ready for the Rapture there'll be a lad rain ready for you when the Rapture comes hallelujah how many want to be ready it'll be there just like uh you know when the when the sisters bring forth children the strength is there to bring forth the child it's there hallelujah it's going to be there it's provided at just the right time and season right or you going to manhood or whatever you do get go into marriage wherever you do the the grace that is needed it'll be given to you when you get there Hallelujah so Jesus said oh fools now in One Way Church he's right because they don't have the Holy Ghost yet they're foolish virgins oh fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken Jesus rebukes them for not believing the women right he does it later as well he does it when he gets there later on that evening when he comes to them all he rebukes them all he upgrades them for the hardness of their hearts and church sometimes we're just so slow to believe so so sometimes we just linger in unbelief like uncertainty is God going to help me can God do this is is God on my side is am I God's friend sometimes we linger so long in that and we got a sad attitude on top of that does that sound familiar to anybody I preached on a few weeks ago or yeah months self-pity sometimes we get into self-pity oh my life so hard why do I got to go through this why me why not you you got to go through something would you rather go through some other things I mean why not us we're the children of God God wants to see God wants to prove to the devil that we we've got real Faith Hallelujah so to go through the trials and just cling to the word just hold on as as much as you can but I like what brother man said do as much as you can and they said when you don't have anymore God will do the rest I love that quote I need to find that quote do all that you can for Jesus and then when you feel like you can do no more he'll take care of the rest Hallelujah now what does he take him to verse 26 ought not Christ to have suffered the things and to enter into his glory now Church here's the beautiful part of this this is what they missed about the Messiah they read all the verses about the Messiah reigning and bringing every nation into subjection but they missed the scriptures about the suffering servant the suffering Messiah they thought it was all glory all Dominion all power all tearing down strongholds and they missed the part about the Messiah having to suffer and die so what does Jesus do he says you're foolish you're slow to believe you haven't believed all the word of God you've missed this part about the Messiah suffering that's the part we don't like to think about either Church look at that I mean do we like to think about suffering in a persec or suffering in a squeeze does anybody like to think about that no same thing we're still human like they are right we're on the same level we're humans we battle things and we don't uh we don't often think outside to other scriptures we just think about the things we're currently going through but if we keep focusing on Christ if we keep talking about Jesus in the right time and season Jesus will speak what we need to hear and I love this at verse 27 and beginning at Moses and all the prophets so he starts in Genesis and all the prophets so Genesis Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy Joshua Judges Ruth Samuel second Samuel Kings Kings Chronicles and Chronicles as Nehemiah Esther all the way down job and Psalms and Proverbs Ecclesiastes Song of Solomon Isaiah Jeremiah Lamentations Ezekiel Daniel Hosea Joel and Amos oadi Jonah Micah naham habac Zephaniah haii and Zachariah Malachi I think I quoted most of the Old Testament right there he Jesus starts at Genesis and he starts preaching look he's supposed to suffer look at the Messiah you missed it here it is here it is look what the Bible says here and church as they're walking they start realizing my oh now I see I missed it I didn't read that and now the words of the Bible are jumping out to them and now they can see what they missed God help us to see what we miss hallelujah amen the god of Heaven has to come down and preach an entire sermon of every prophet in the entire Old Testament to get these people to believe of what his true commission was to suffer and die for their sins but they wanted to skip ahead to the Millennium Brothers who needs the Gentiles oh those they'll all come up they'll be our slaves and God's like no I'm going to make them my bride H we were the Beggars but now we're royalty they look down on the Gentiles they're just a bunch of Gentiles yeah yeah they'll come up and worship but Jesus like no no I'm G actually make them my bride amen praise God they missed all that but we see it by the grace of God talk about a sermon I love that song uh the preacher of preachers began to preach on this walk Hallelujah this was the preacher brother Chris of all preachers nobody could preach like this man and he preaches while they're walking on a two and a half or three hour long walk he starts saying look at the scripture here and then Moses said this and look what Isaiah said and then all these hundred years later look what Ezekiel said and then look at Malachi Malachi said this look at all these things that have come to pass oh you talk about little uh a a little pep in their step I imagine by the end they're walking pretty feeling pretty good my Hallelujah I never seen it like this before oh now the Bible makes sense brother Chris I I missed I left out that whole entire part I didn't even realize that this is what God is doing in this hour oh God's getting a bride ready while the US raises up out the Beast out the land God's getting a bride ready Hallelujah that will meet Christ in the air that'll miss the Judgment of the tribulation she be raptured in a moment and Twink of an eye she shall not see death she shall not see wrath because she's the Bride of Jesus Christ amen oh my that's what God's doing now he's getting a bride ready to be snatched away to Heaven harpazo remember harpazo I always remember my harpazo sermon snatch away I looked at every time the Bible said harpazo that's what Jesus is doing right now getting a br ready to be snatched away from this Earth not to trust in Donald Trump or JD Vance or Elon Musk but to trust in the Risen Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's right talk about a preacher God Of Heaven comes out and preaches them every Prophet every verse about Jesus having to suffer verse 28 and they drew nigh unto the village wither they went so they finally come to Emmas after two and a half three hours and made as though he would have gone further now I love this part but I want to look back here uh this is a beautiful part of the the story now look Jesus he makes as though he's going to move on I love this Jesus acts like he's going to leave him Church isn't that something he acts like he's going to leave him in other words he's giving them a test he's saying do you want me to stay or are you okay with me leaving and how we know he gives us the same test in our lives he'll give us the same test do you want to keep enjoying the word do you want to hear more of the word do you want to keep that sweet spirit with us or are we okay with that spirit leaving us in other words G do we want to grieve the Holy Spirit or do you want to say Jesus stay with me tomorrow I want to feel this way tomorrow morning too I don't want to just feel this like on Sunday and Wednesday I'm going to feel it on Thursday morning and the church said that's usually the hardest morning of the week for me I don't know about you but tomorrow morning is usually the hardest morning so he kind of just plays like he's acting isn't that what brother R said isn't that what an actor does he just changes his mask God in morphe well now they don't even know it's Jesus right there're just he's some preacher that my he can preach the house down he preaches and I start feeling fire burn up in my heart I I go from sad to on fire Glory Hallelujah when this guy preaches man I I I'm discouraged and by the end I'm shouting the victory I'm ready to move on with God hallelujah and he's like all right see you guys later been a nice Fellowship thanks for having me fools I don't mind walking with foolish people all right have a good night fools and he acts like okay I'll see you later and what does verse 29 show so this is the test of the believer verse 29 but they constrained him in other words They begged him oh oh sir sir please please please please stay with us this is so wonderful I've never heard preaching like this I got to have some more of this I love when we first come in the message that's how we felt we're willing to drive three hours across the state just for one Bible study oh you know why because our hearts were burning Hallelujah God was opening the scriptures to us hallelujah it's not hard to do that it's not hard to drive uh three hours one way to church when your heart's burning with the fire of God hallelujah like every week was like a brand new sermon a brand new masterpiece on a new topic we never heard before oh I didn't know that about the Seven Seals I didn't know that about rapturing faith I didn't know that about the latter rain it's just it's a it's a fresh Revelation it's just continually unfolding all the time but God's testing them do you want more of this or do you want to go back to your sad life that's what he wants to know tonight do you want more of God's revelation more of revealing of the word or do you want to go back to your sadness and your defeat how many you want to go on with God hallelujah so brother says you better beg Jesus to stay in your life now I preached this one time I love this story I don't tell it much but I was preaching in albian one time and a mother a young mother had children I remember she's watching me during the whole service sometimes there's some somebody's under the spirit they're just watching me the whole time I'm like okay God's going to do something with that person you know I know something's going to happen at in the service it's like when that woman got healed with the kidney cancer or not kidney kidney Stone not kidney cancer kidney stone and when sister Marie got healed of the bleeding uh the blood issue just watching me that the whole time like this person's pulling so much on the word of God well anyways in Pennsylvania and I ended the sermon with this and I said I was just I was reading a quote where brother R said I I don't have the quote tonight but brother R said you got to beg Jesus to stay with you in your life you don't want to him to leave you you don't want him to to forsake not forsake but you you don't want to uh to lose his anointing and I just preached it you got to beg Jesus if you want Jesus in your life you got to plead with him to stay with you you got to be tired of having him out of your life you got to beg him and pray and plead to stay in your life it's a test Hallelujah and I saw that woman give her husband the baby I'm not going to say her name she got a pretty good name that's that's the clue I'll give pretty good first name I know that she handed the baby to her husband come up here we put pray for her and she laid at the altar she screamed and cried and after service she come up her face was all red and swollen there's tears all over her face now I'm probably dramatizing as I always do exaggerating but she's like brother Jesse I needed that I had feeling so far from God all the cares of my children all the cares of my husband the jobs and we're talking about moving and where's the income going to come from and all these the children crying screaming she said I felt so far from God she said but when you preach that that's exactly what I heard brother brandom say the same thing and I need to cry out to God and she said now I'm back with God hallelujah she met Jesus at the altar Hallelujah and she said I don't want to go on in this motherhood or this I don't want to go on as this wife that doesn't have the anointing of God on me let me have his anointing Hallelujah let me have Jesus how many Want Jesus wow so in other words brother bam said you must constrain Jesus to stay with you don't get distracted in other things keep Jesus on your heart and mind and church this just wasn't one time you think oh this just one time Jesus did this multiple times he would act like he's leaving just to see if they wanted to stay and brother R said we we shouldn't get to a spot where where where we stop clapping brother said Jesus loves clapping other you start clapping and praising God brother it's like inviting Jesus back into your life he wants to see if you really want to worship God you want to worship God and praise God well then act like it amen ask him to be in your service anoint me while we sing anoint me while we pray Lord I want you here I don't want to see you go I don't want cold Services I want the spirit of God to flow in my life Hallelujah that's what I'm saying you got to say Amen you got to read your Bible you got to pray got to try to witness you got to try to worship try to get out of your old like our just human uh common stiff starchy condition and we got to inv invite Jesus back in our lives Hallelujah that's right church that is right it's not easy for me to preach like this I'm tired I'm trying to keep Jesus in my life right you know how easy it could be so many times I'm so tired I could just stand here and preach and just not raise my voice I've been tempted many times to do that but I can't do that I can't let myself get cold I got to let Jesus into my life into my gift does that make sense you've all I've seen message preachers stand like this and read quotes brother said this brother said that said this Bible says this Bible says that and by the end you're like okay is this guy even alive or is that an AI generated image there something like that see I I could do that now there's nothing wrong if that's your anointing but we want to give all that we have have we done what we could do that's the question that was preached to us in other words I got to give myself over to the thoughts that God sends to me and preach with conviction right preach with passion with sincerity praise God he just didn't do this one time he did it another time Mark 6:48 and when he saw them toiling and roaring now look in both cases these disciples are in bad condition the first case they're sad discouraged and he calls them fools and he wants to see if they want to keep him around Church do we want to keep Jesus around that's the question or do you want to trud along through life in sadness in this case they're toiling Jesus lets them get in a toiling awful difficult part of life and then he comes around to see if they want to invite him into their situation and the church said glory to God glory to God Amen as we go through toils of life amen Jesus is going to come by his service and see if you'll invite him into your life Hallelujah invite him into your pain invite him into your questions invite him into your investigations or you're wondering invite him into your sadness that's why he's coming that's why he allowed it praise God so you invite him into your situation he just wants to see do you want him as a part of your life in this situation you know sometimes we say why did we go through this why do I got to go through this well it'd be different if you let Jesus into it you might feel different it might not be so hard and God helped me too I'm I'm preaching to myself tonight he saw them toiling and roaring uh God allowed that God allowed them to have that storm God allowed storms in your life for the wind was contrary to them oh everything finances were contrary the kids were contrary to them your job was contrary to you your friends were contrary to you and about the Fourth Watch of the night so let's see the Fourth Watch First Watch would have been uh six to n second watch 9 to midnight oh the Fourth Watch would have been 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. so from 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m. brother Chris has worked third shift recently so he knows what it feels like at 3 a.m. but they're toiling now they're not just driving's toiling too but this is real toiling so I appreciate a hardworking man on who work all night I appreciate a third shift person that's that's a tough life but these guys are toiling with ores about the fourth so it's about 3:00 am so maybe it's 2:30 a.m. about 4:00 a.m. maybe it's 10:00 to 3: he comes unto them walks on the sea and he's acting like he's going to pass by and don't inv don't you want Jesus help you out do we want to carry this cross alone all by ourselves or do want Jesus to give us strength to do it God it's he acts like he's going to walk by oh yeah you guys enjoying that tough life okay go ahead I'll just I'll keep going if you want me to and he he's just testing them don't you want to don't you want to invite me in oh because you know what he's always doing he's always knocking at the hearts door the leot toan message right behold I stand in the door knock I just seen it there if any will open the door I'll come in and up with him and he with me Hallelujah I'm going to pay for this tomorrow I'm going to pay for it I can tell already glory to God I better I better close here hallelujah he's passing by and he's act like he's going to pass him he's acting like he don't care but he's actually testing do you care the fact he's passing by proves he cares but he wants to see do you care will you bring Jes Jesus into your toil or you just want him to keep walking by well uh just go ahead and pass me by sa we ought to sing pass me not oh gentle savior don't don't pass by Jesus Come into my toiling come into my sadness come into my questions about how is this how is this even scriptural H how how how does this work what what just happened this last weekend invite him into that and church don't you know what will he do if he ever comes you what will he do I point you to the word of God because that's what he did on the road to emus he started preaching him a sermon the god of Heaven amen preaches a scriptural sermon to try to encourage the sad and here he acts like he's going to pass by him on the boat when they saw him walking on the sea they supposed been a spirit and cried out for they all saw him and were troubled and immediately talked with them and say to them be of good cheer it is I be not afraid now there's a parallel passage in Matthew 14:25 and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea see so this proves the fact he comes by your toiling proves he's going out to you and it proves he wants you to invite him into your life that's the reason that's the reason he's out there that's the reason you feel the presence of God that's the reason you hear somebody preach about Jesus or you're here tonight the reason you're here is because he's coming to you you praise God and he wants to he wants you to invite him into your life and listen to his word what he has to say let's stand to our feet or else I'm never going to close here go I never got to my verse did I verse 32 I'm going to close with that one now they're already at the house and they said to one another did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us by the way while he opened to us the scripture Hallelujah haven't been an hour yet I'm at 55 minutes surprising but see here's the other kind of a burning now what did I call this Burning let me look at my notes what did the exact word so Isaiah had the burning to put you into service Jeremiah had the burning to keep you in service keep you from quitting Copus and his friend had the burning to revive their service in the season of doubt what's going on here what what I'm leaving Jerusalem what we thought this was going to happen we thought it was going to be a great restoration a great Redemption we thought this so here now the spirit of God comes to revive the fire in their souls how many know he wants to do that tonight if you feel your fires going down or you got questions or you're sad or you're uncertain or you're toiling and life is difficult he's here tonight Church he's the same yesterday he's the same yesterday today forever Hallelujah he's the same so if there's anyone here tonight who's under these type of situations he's here to revive you to keep you in the service of the Lord musicians can come let's bow our heads here Jesus cares when we're sad he cares that's why he came to them Jesus cares when we're confused Jesus cares when we're exhausted we're toiling and it feels like we're getting nowhere in life Jesus cares that's why he's here tonight Hallelujah Lord I love that scripture that I just read there Lord Jesus went unto them Lord it always goes back to your love it always goes back to your care for us Lord as we [Music] pray Lord in our own human Minds we can get so confused we can feel like such fools we can do food foolish things we can be cowards like some of those men felt like after the res after the crucifixion we can be so confused about Prophecy in the Bible and what God's doing in our lives we can be so worn out by the toils of life but Lord in those moments you come by our way and you just want to hear us in invite you into our lives you knock again brother so and so can I come in can I come into your life can I come into this situation sister so and so can I come in would you eat with me would you spend some time with me Lord how loving you are Lord God how gracious you are Lord God to come
