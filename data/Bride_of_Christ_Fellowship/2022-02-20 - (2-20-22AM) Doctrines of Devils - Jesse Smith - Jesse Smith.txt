TRANSCRIPT
========================================
first timothy four verse one i'd like to uh preach on doctrines of devils this morning we've you know spent seven sermons looking at the true doctrine the doctrine of the lord jesus christ we'd say revealed to paul and so i want to look at doctrines of devils it's a quite extensive subject so i don't think i'll be able to finish it this morning unless i preach about three hours so i don't think i'm gonna preach three hours though so uh it's a it's a really extensive subject and uh wednesday night i ended the live stream so i could show some examples from around the message about doctrine so i'll review that today because i don't want anybody to miss out when you're working on wednesday night you know and um but there's certain things i don't i don't want it to go public as you know as all churches do that mostly you know but i'll share that lord winning at the end of this sermon this this morning first timothy 4 verse 1 if you have your bibles and we'll break this down lord willing we'll just go through this slowly and see we've already seen how the holy ghost brings doctrine now here we'll see how satan brings in false doctrine first timothy 4 verse 1. let's just read verse one together okay verse one let's begin on three one two three now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving he to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils let's have a word of prayer let's bow our heads here and ask god to minister heavenly father you are worthy hallelujah you're worthy of all praise we say thank you jesus hallelujah you're worthy worthy is a lamb that was slain we know all heaven says holy holy holy without ceasing lord god you are so holy you are so worthy lord god we in our humble little insignificant lives lord it would seem to the world lord god and we humble ourselves this morning lord in our humble little way we just come before you and we ask that the spirit of god the holy ghost the spirit of christ would come and anoint us oh god for this service to hear lord to preach to receive to testify hallelujah to prophesy whatever you'd have to be done today lord god teach us and instruct us the lord god correct us lord whenever we have need of today we ask that your holy ghost will do it lord god for lord you said the spirit will guide us into all truth so lord we're looking for truth today you said you'd provide all of our needs you said you never leave us nor forsake us so hallelujah we expect lord god we we're trusting in your promise to give us what we have need of today on our earthly journey and so we give you all the praise and we ask for your spirit in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god i do have uh some notes so i'd like to share those here you know lord willing uh you know today we'll preach on doctrines of devils this morning rather and then this afternoon for the sunday school we'll probably start teaching on the denominational spirit because it goes so closely with this i like the children to know why we're not a denomination that's the sermon brother amen came in on and we'll go through that and break that down my wife and i were talking we hope we hope all the children had a good week of honor and mom and dad this week by god's grace you know spent about an hour and a half on that last sunday so hopefully that was a blessing and if we need more let me know we'll do more bible studies on that we'll just drill right into uh them know by the power of the holy spirit you know so we're thankful for god's amazing grace um you know i'll just share this briefly you know uh i preached six marriage banquets you know and that the last one brother cams when they had me come over there a few years ago i shared um i shared what i felt was the most important part of parenting and i the scriptures in proverbs uh or ecclesiastes i can't remember right now but the point was a mother or father whoever's there when the child disobeys they've got to do a uh they've got to do correction right there um i think the bible i think it's ecclesiastes that scripture comes from you don't want to delay correction you want correction to happen quickly and so i said if any compliment goes i could give to my wife i would give that to her where she's able to have those conversations with the children right there right when they make the mistake or shortly after you know whenever life allows it right and i said that's what's formed the character of my children and i think you would say the same with your parents how did you learn to behave it was through the correction right because if it's not corrected it grows worse and worse and worse right so that's what we see in this generation you know we see a generation disobedient to parents unthankful unholy right why is that well because they're not corrected in love they've got to be corrected in love and brother ram now we don't do this all the time but brother brahm said when you correct them first tell them all the good they're doing tell them all the good things they do right encourage them say thank you for and of course we don't do that all the time but at some point you need to tell your children that you know thank you for doing this and thank you for taking out the trash thank you for cleaning your room thanks for picking up the toys but then you need to bring the correction and uh the sooner it is the better but it must be done in love praise god like the bible said fathers do not bring your children to wrath well of course that would apply to mothers too mothers don't bring your children to wrath don't be so harsh with them that they get angry and they want to fight back or something like that you know so it's the spirit of christ it's the love of god you know manifesting in our lives and we're grateful for that praise god now with time i just thought you know we would go there and uh i wanted to pray a little bit before service we got here a little later so i just want to pray a little extra i hope that's okay this is the house of prayer praise god so thank you for your patience so i wanted to read this as a text so let's pick up where we where we stopped our text when satan brings in a false doctrine he speaks a lie in hypocrisy so the preachers will be hypocrites and we'll look we'll break this down slowly the preachers will be hypocrites and because it's because their conscience which is their their spiritual stop light don't do this or go stop go precaution you know they they forget they just blow right through that that warning their their conscience becomes seared with the hot iron in other words their stop light lost its power right or whatever you could say the power went out there's no conscience there to stop them because they've silenced their conscience so satan anoints them to be hypocrites and they don't have a conscience of right and wrong uh they their their conscience is they don't have the feeling of right and wrong anymore and then paul gives two examples which we'll break down here in a moment these were two that were combating the ephesian church and i remember paul warned them he said for three years i warned you with tears so he writes this letter after he left he would not go back again right uh he left and timothy was there pastoring or i'm sorry doing evangelistic work in ephesus and he brought word to paul in prison and said they're having these troubles and so paul and that's how it wasn't with the colossian church as we looked at last sunday a messenger would always go you know a preacher would go there for paul come back and tell paul how are they they were doing well two of the false doctrines that it incorporated into the ephesian church war where preachers shouldn't marry right that was one of them and paul says that's a doctrine of the devil and another one was you can't eat meat or you abstain from meats paul calls that a doctrine of the devil think about that a holy ghost-filled church with signs miracles and wonders how is satan going to slow them down he's going to give them false commands right satan's going to deceive them with false commands coming from hypocrites but the holy spirit and paul knew there was believers there that would detect that lie amen hallelujah no doubt each group you know there's usually three kinds of believers in every group now we're hoping we're the exception amen uh we but we've seen over the years where you know we're not always but hopefully we'll get to the spot where we are by the grace of god hallelujah we're all true believers amen but uh paul paul no doubt paul said in the letter there to show them uh because god created listen god created both of these to be received with thanksgiving the mayor's union and also meets they're both to be received with thanksgiving and so the holy spirit anointed paul to get word you know from timothy okay and so timothy would sit right there as timothy wrote it out or that sometimes they'd have another man right off the scripture and uh from his words and he would send he would send back this word you know to to ephesus and they would read the letter you know they would read it before the people can you imagine if you're the guilty preacher and they just read this for paul and paul's talking about you you imagine the sunday before you just said you brothers you preachers can't marry and now let's read a letter from paul and all the ministers are sitting there and everybody would turn and look at the minister you just preached it last week and paul said it's the devil see but that that's that's the correction of the holy ghost praise god amen hallelujah thank god amen thank god that there's an absolute thank god that we have the word of god today amen to detect these doctrines of demons and church they try to get in here right they've tried to get in here over the years they try no every church satan is constantly trying to battle churches to get into them but we've got to hold up a standard against him amen we've got to get the standard out and fly the flag and say we're not letting the enemy come in we're driving the enemy out praise god we're not giving the enemy any ground amen we've possessed all these grounds we've taken this spiritual land footstep by footstep by possession by possession and we're not giving it up praise god we're not giving any place to the devil this is god's land amen and we're more than conquerors and we're protecting the land we're keeping the land and in fact we're possessing more land amen hallelujah amen do not let the devil drive you off the land god has given to you is he never trying to the devil is trying to draw the look look at me look at it look at him there he's trying to convince the preachers he's trying to influence the ministers right and then the sisters and then here now this one affects every woman in the church the meats because they're the cooks so see how he's trying to infiltrate he'll go through the preachers the women the family everybody's open season with with satan all right let's go hedge about you satan is going to try to impact and try to uh hinder you frustrate you but never be discouraged praise god because god is faithful amen he promised i will never leave you i'll never forsake you and if you are going through a test then it shows god has confidence in you that you'll overcome and pass that test amen and learn something coming out of it praise god hallelujah because we all need to learn how many need to learn more about god hallelujah we all need to grow in the knowledge and revelation of jesus christ praise god now i put this just up here for uh sister faith is she here today i didn't see her see okay well god bless your faith i'm sure she can hear me can you right through the walls you know uh i just put it up here you know just as a brief uh review of the ministry of william branham you know i'm recently recently made a video about brother branham's human side and how we welcome correction and and uh this is what we really need to understand in this day that brother branham was a human he had a divine side which was the prophetic ministry and also the preaching and teaching ministry but he also had a human side okay and just as a review for uh sister faith there you know he lived from 1909 to 65. uh he had a worldwide healing and discernment ministry which was so powerful that all the pentecostal historians count him as the man who started the current revival the healing revival that is still going around the world praise god now satan has infiltrated that i'm going to preach a whole sermon on that lord willing about there's a false uh there's a false anointing that gets on denominational people i haven't seen it too much in the message but you see it all over the mainstream churches like the word of faith churches you know like the kenneth copeland's and the uh uh the bethel's and the hill songs uh and a lot of it and they talk about healings and they may have healings but when when they're when they get impartations it looks like the devil rather than the holy ghost so i'm going to preach a whole sermon on that and just show you it's probably one of those private sermons you know because i don't i don't mean to make people bad or make people look bad but but they're the ones that are exposing themselves making themselves look bad and the bible said we got to rebuke them that sin before all but anyways satan in other words satan has a copycat he's impersonating the real healing that comes through believers amen he's doing so so now his time has gone on he's impersonated healing and when satan's anointing comes on him they get in pain god's holy spirit is not going to give you pain it's not gonna hurt you you're not gonna be screaming like you're in pain you're gonna be screaming like you're getting victory amen there's a different kind of scream amen there's a scream of victory there's a scream of deliverance but it's not a scream of pain and of agony right of being tormented it's not a scream of torment and so we thank god that we have the real holy spirit here today praise god amen but brother man spoke with thus ate the lord many times but i have at least there's over 30 that apply to us that apply to doctrine and uh prophecy there's over 30 for doctrine and prophecy he fulfilled numerous prophecies revelation 10 7 you know malachi 4 5 and 6. matthew 17 11 luke 17 30. fulfill many prophecies in the ministry of brother branham he fulfilled the bible mysteries revelation 10 7 the mystery of god finish and he's turned our hearts back back to the apostolic fathers that's why we love paul so much is because god sent a prophet like paul brother branham to point us back to the bible amen that's why we love him brother abraham so much because he point us back to the word of god that's why we love paul so much amen all these men of god martin luther john wesley because they point us back to the word of god hallelujah amen now here's now here's where uh here's the human side right the human side of brother ram he was fully human though so he had so much supernatural so much bible truth but he was also human and some people stumbled by the fact he died from injuries in a car accident which it doesn't matter how god takes you home god takes people home in many different ways and we don't get to choose that right most of the time some people do you know with suicide which is very awful it's a sin no doubt but it's not uh it's not the the last sin that's not the unpardonable sin uh but it just you know people look at that and they think oh i was a prophet but you see if you look it down through the ages people died from different all kinds of different things and uh you know we should just pray god help me to go when it's my time to go right like we don't want to be like hezekiah right and say well gloria give me more time and then fail god right and waste your god gave him 15 more years well he wasted that 15 years and he had alliance with babylon we don't want to live we'd rather go home when god wants us to go home but you know uh the first major we'd say falling away from the message came in the 77 because brother madam just made he made a human prediction he thought that the end time would come before 77. and there's three reasons he said 1977. he said first because no uh democracy had lasted 200 years so our our nation started in 1776 well what's what's 1776 plus 200. it's 1976. so he saw that in history and he's but he also said if it does it'll break all history so he also knew that you know it could go beyond that but he just had never seen that in history also he calculated the number of years abra from abraham to christ was 1 954 years so when he calculated that after uh you know the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost he saw he thought well the gentiles will have that same amount of time if the jews had this amount of time the gentiles will have that amount of time of course that was a human understanding it was his human guess now remember he never made the prediction with in the name of the lord he constantly said this is not god this is just my opinion based upon dates so see why you know see why a date setting you know it's it's a desire it's a fine desire to want to know when he's going to come but do you see how it's not it's not it's not thus saith the lord right this is not thus saith the lord and that's why i don't really want to get into date setting you know what i mean i don't i don't want to get into that because then people actually feel like maybe it is the spirit of god but it isn't unless it's god and then also brother brahm calculated how many jubilees have there been since the first jubilee in in leviticus 25 verse 8. i was listening to it this week that's why i'm kind of familiar with these uh from daniel's 70th week and brother ram said 1977 will be the anniversary of the 70th jubilee right so he just thought well that must be significant so there's three reasons i think it'll be 77. okay and he never said it was not saint or well it came and went well many people fell away during that time well that's because they weren't they were looking more at brother branham as a man rather than looking at the word in other words they saw the supernatural but they really weren't interested in the word of god right because the word of god never predicted that and so forth now since 77 many cults have risen up but we should understand that because satan is battling the message of the hour church martin luther said at the end of his life he said i don't even think one tenth of the people we've seen saved are still serving god today not even a tenth can you imagine think about the people we baptized brother bang over the years i would say i hope a tenth have i would think maybe a little over a tenth have been have stayed you know i hope you know think about it think about otis and tammy remember i mean devon you know look i mean think about this you know how many people we baptize that's just how it is people see the move of god and they want a part of it but if they don't uh make their ground a good ground then the enemy's gonna come and snatch that away or he's gonna raise up you know he's gonna raise up uh weeds and it's gonna choke out the real word of god oh my but thank god that we can have good and honest hearts lord lord help us god may you help us lord to have good and honest hearts to keep all the weeds out of our lives amen that we can stand here and say there is a true seed and i do have good ground and this seed is going to produce fruit hallelujah amen well just like there's 33 000 denominations right just like that it's the same thing satan comes in there when people have a desire and if they're not sturdy and strong and solid on the word of god they're going to be deceived so they're going to fall away we'll let them fall away i mean that's their choice you can't force somebody to come to church again force anybody let them fall away let jesus say let the blind lead the blind amen yes give them warnings but after a while you can't warn them the rest of your life you give them warnings as you're filled out of the holy spirit and you let them choose their own path you let them love what they want to love but as for me and my house we will love the lord amen this is the prophecy this had to happen and this didn't happen just in brother ramsey it's been happening in every day like we said with martin luther he saw it falling away a mighty man like that a tremendous man of god yet he had his faults and failures he had a lot of fault he kept the same denominational kind of setup as the roman catholic church um he was anti-semitic so he was against the jews because he thought they crucified christ so some of his writings encouraged people to burn down jewish synagogues that was a big stain on his that was a big stain on his life but church how many know that we're all going to have saints on our lives i'm not excusing sin i'm just saying none of us are above sin nobody's perfect here today i like that like they joked did you hang up your angel wings over there on the on the coat rack did you did you leave him over there no you don't have any angel wings yeah you're not perfect you know you're you when i we fall short you're never going to find anybody who is perfect outside of jesus christ but that's the beauty of it because he gets all the glory he's the sustainer of our lives he's the keeper of our lives he's the redeemer of our lives amen there's got to be one redeemer one lamb amen there's got to be one man amen who can breathe if one man led to all this death adam there's got to be what's why he alone gets all the glory amen hallelujah every age has had falling away every age so we're we're not we're not exempt from that we're going to have to battle that and then some of the greater followings away was with a 2001 here i stand article that exalted uh voice of god to this place where they said the most important job today is making tapes that's that's a lie the most important job today is preaching and living the word of god hallelujah because jesus said go and teach all nations he didn't say go and make tape say man he said go and do that he said preach the gospel amen it's preaching and living i say living for you and i because for all of you you're not all preachers you don't have to be you probably don't want to wish to be a preacher it's not it's not always the easiest thing but you know your job's not so easy either we all got hard jobs amen but i say it that's why i say it preach and live it amen because all of us are involved you got to receive the preaching and you have to receive the life of christ you have to live a life worthy of the gospel well that that move in 2001 really started getting people exalting uh brother joseph and the the jeffersonville movement which i still try to correct him i never hear back from him anymore so i'll just keep trying because that's what a christian does amen and then of course 2012 the believe the sign movement this it brought out all these human mistakes of brother branham now some of them some of the concerns are very legitimate that's why i preach it to you i preached the prove the prove all things series remember that a couple years ago uh some of them are concerns but some of them are just so uh i'd say uh unimportant you know so unimportant uh and it's a lot of these are based on assumptions and not waiting on the lord and this is caused now like like i've heard from a sister who has a sister in who lives in florida who's from brazil she said brazil churches are falling away from the message by the droves or by the scores you know uh because of the influence of believe the sign and of course i debated them you know two years ago and so forth but uh it's as if people were taught wrong because to me how could i ever fall away from the lord jesus christ water baptism i could ever fall away from the fact that god never calls himself three persons how can i fall see i can't fall away from that because i'm founded i'm standing on a rock amen the message is the rock of the word praise god see the reason they can fall away because they were built on sand there it is amen their lives have been on sand man-made ideas or worshiping brother branham or exalting brother ram too high and not showing the human side of it their lives were built on sand so when the storms come when the floods come they fail amen their house was was was destroyed but when the storm comes on us those of us who stand on the rock our houses are built on the rock our houses stand amen we can stand in the storm amen because we're not founded on sand humanity we're we're founded on the solid rock the eternal rock and that rock was christ amen that's why we stand amen that's why they can't blow or blow us away because we're not we're not founded on a man's system we're founded on the revelation of jesus christ amen it's exactly right hallelujah it's a great following way but let them fall hallelujah god knows how to direct his word amen every week brother bang i get numerous emails your video helped me here this helped me hear this i got one this week that said i was i was struggling and i listened to your sermon last week and now i'm saying the message that's what i want to do praise god i'm not responsible uh for where the word goes i'm just responsible for scattering the seed amen so are you that's all we got to do we just got to scatter the seed amen and god will take that seed and he'll fall in all those places glory i think of the sower right right right right amen he just goes like he just throws him out in the field like you know he don't place him well i'll do one right here i'll do one right here he just he just scatters a seed he just scatters it because he knows there's a law of god amen and when he throws it out there the winds of the holy ghost will take those seeds and they'll land and he knows god god is great enough to honor those seeds hallelujah amen he don't even water it himself i mean he'd be good a little bit you know as a as a farmer as a if you have a home garden you water your seeds and things like that but the main water comes from god he knows god is responsible and god's laws will go to the word church aren't you glad god's law watered your seed hallelujah thank you jesus so church we're desiring to stay in the middle of the road now i was going a little slower than i thought so um but here brother adam says this i want to just show you this here about doctrines of devils it's from the church age book now look not some cases in every case a false prophet is one who's outside the word that's why i love joseph branham but i've told him brother you got 11 mistakes outside the word of god and i told all his followers contact me i said when are you going to repent of those they won't repent of them they double down and the list just keeps growing see a real prophet is not off the word they're on the word see antichrist means anti-word or opponent of the word that's what the word adversary means an opponent so anyone who's antichrist is opposing the revelation of the bible they might even be holding the bible but if they oppose what the bible says they're antichrist so false prophets pervert the word giving it a meeting that fits their own devilish ends now what's the devilish end i would say of worshipping the tapes what's worshiping brother branham it's idolatry of william branham instead of jesus christ getting the worship now william branham gets it or a tape gets it or a cd can you imagine that or an sd card gets the worship instead of christ that to me that's the end of it and also some men get richer while others get poorer that's right money women popularity some people are getting really rich through this it's a devilish end brother ram says false prophets go off the word they make false prophecies like they say thus saith the lord they said uh we're in the perfect will of god playing tapes and limiting the five-fold ministry that's impossible i challenge that statement on the authority of ephesians chapter four amen that says the fivefold ministry will bring us to a unity of faith it'll bring us to perfection amen until we all come in the measure of the stature of the person of christ amen i challenge that by the holy spirit praise god amen because a false prophet takes you away from the word not to the word see so i don't know what their ends are but that to me it looks like popularity money that's what it looks like to me have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by what fear now it's different we have to have the fear of god and you should brother bam said i fear my wife i fear the congregation i don't want to live in a way that causes them to stumble so i would say i feel brother i fear brother bang today because i don't want to fail him i don't want him to think less of me as a christian so that's not the fear we're talking about here this is a false prophet fear is like if you don't listen to me you're lost it's the same idea if your name's not on our book for membership if you don't join our church you're going to hell that's a lie see they're lying on purpose watch they can get your money or they can have influence over you so they can have power that's what that's what those devils want is power over people the only one who has power over you is the holy ghost praise god that's the only one who has power over us yes i have influence and yes i'm supposed to rule the house of god but really i rule by the holy ghost and if i'm ruling by the holy ghost and the holy ghost is ruling your life it's not me it's the holy ghost inside of you praise god and what i preach should align with the word of god that the holy ghost has already wrote praise god amen so you can say when when i'm preaching you can say amen to it because you know it's in the word see they bind themselves you've got to follow me right and i'll just share it like this that jeffersonville movement has just been repeating over and over how the rapture is so close the rapture is so close and i would just think that god would let the rapture go longer because of that because the last 20 years i've been the message everybody's predicting how soon it is and look what god keeps doing oh it's going to be 2013. no it's going to be this it's going to be that going to be and it's going to be 2018. 2019. i just heard another preacher just i i watched a video from him this week somebody sent me a sermon about 1977 and he said it was gonna be 2019. now it's 2022. and he says if i'm wrong i'll come here and apologize i don't know if he did but now but now he's saying it's 2026 now i'm like can you guys just stop with it would you please stop getting everybody's this prediction making see they all think they're prophets but they're not you can't think yourself a prophet you can't make yourself a prophet you're born to prophet amen you look at their churches they're dead nobody wants to worship you you've got to rebuke them just to say amen if god's in your heart and you've on the if you've got the fire of god in your heart it's a joy to say amen it's a joy to raise your hands it's a joy to worship and sing to god because you've got the love of god inside of you how could you not worship god amen how could you not love the word of god praise god hallelujah by their fruits they're known the fruit of fear and the fruit of spiritual deadness and lukewarmness these false prophets say if you don't do what i say or if you leave then you're going to be destroyed got to follow the false prophet now he goes on to say this is the end of this quote i believe he said there are false prophets for a true prophet will always lead one to the word and bind the people to jesus christ and he won't tell the people to fear him or what he says but to fear what the word says notice how these people like judas are out for money they get you to sell all that you have and give it to them in their schemes they spend more time on offerings than the word those who attempt to operate gifts will make use of a gift which has a margin of error in it and then ask for money and neglect the word of god and call it god and people will go to them and bear with them and support them and believe them not knowing it is the way of death that's how you know it's off the word that's why i've reached out to joseph branham i've reached out to billy paul branham i've reached out to that other brother who preached 24 false things and none of them can receive it they all just double down on their false doctrines what can i do i can just say the blind will lead the blind and just show christian love and just pray for them that's all i can do now i just want you to see this here the antichrist look at this the opponent of the word the one who's fighting against the word refuses the true bride doctrine so this is how we know this is how we know the antichrist they're going to refuse the doctrine for the bride of jesus christ they won't receive the real revelation of the holy spirit they refuse it in other words they're saying i'm not going to learn that i don't want to learn that i want what i'm going to learn what i want to learn i don't want to learn what the bride's going to learn oh but we're the bride of christ and we learn what our husband wants us to know praise god we can be taught amen we can understand we can grow in revelation because we're being taught by the holy spirit the spirit of the bridegroom so therefore the antichrist takes his own bride now and builds her up under a creed of his own takes his own bride and makes her a denomination and many messed churches have become denominated because they gather what they believe and they can't receive any more revelation she gives birth to other denominations as quoted in this holy scripture give birth to daughters roman catholic church luther methodist baptist pentecostal now it's message a lot of them do not message churches are denominations and she don't be just becomes like her mother natural look at this worldly denominational opposing the spiritual bride the word i like that brother makes it look like the bride is the word well she is the word she's the manifestation of the word amen hallelujah now i just want to just review these briefly the bible says we get all the doctrine of christ and no other doctrine of christ does everybody hear that you get all the doctrine of christ and no other doctrine now there's going to be errors where we'll say well we don't know about this like we're talking about we don't know about this i don't know about you know i can't say thus saith the lord on this you know but in other words we get all the doctrine that pertains to life and godliness there it is amen in other words all godly living we have all the doctrine for godly living hallelujah now here's i'm just going to just go through these quickly jesus said the holy ghost shall teach you some things no he's going to give you doctrine on all things the holy ghost and he's going to guide you or lead you here's the area of your life you need to learn how to do this oh hallelujah he's going to guide us you ever had a guide before they walk you to places that's what the holy ghost is he walks through this area of life and said you need to learn how to do better in this area of your life now you got a choice you're going to follow the guide you're going to let them you're going to follow them or just let them walk on and say well i'm saying here i'm not i can't learn nothing i don't want to learn that you've got to be led we got to be led by the holy spirit we're the sons of god we're the daughters of god if we're led by the holy spirit guided into more truth these are promises this is this is the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost so for me i can learn to be a better preacher more humble i can learn to be a better father to my children i can learn to be a better pastor amen to the saints i can learn to be a better husband to my wife i can learn that when the holy ghost guides me to that i can be taught how to do better like here's one i just recently learned my wife and i had to talk one time and and uh so i actually did it this morning i said honey how can i help you on sunday morning it's a pressure pack morning getting eight kids ready to leave by 8 50 a.m i said how can i help and she said well could you get zion dress why i got him dressed this morning that's something i can learn i can learn to help out my family or or i could be you know no it's going to be my way or the highway fear me i'm the husband you know i'm the pastor fear me you see it's just simple errors like this can we learn to do better can we learn how to serve others amen we're not let me remind you church let me remind myself you're not here to be served you are here to serve others amen i don't know america wants to sit down like we like sitting on a table come serve me waitress that's not christianity at all that's not christianity you are the waiters amen you're the waitresses amen we're to serve others praise god jesus said the greatest among you is the servant so i look out at our church i say who's the servant that's where we all should be you can have a church of all servants everybody just stays in their place serving the lord and trying to serve other people they had they had on the day of pentecost church if they had it then we're going to have it too because god is bringing us back to the pentecost amen the fullness of pentecost will be in the bride that's thus saith joel 2 23-26 amen that's thus saith the lord not for me but from the prophet of god you have to learn how to serve each other and don't feel bad if somebody don't learn yet have patience with them have patience pray for them brother austin you have a question buddy many ways uh i got in my book it's chapter 11 in my book there's many ways uh people in the bible help with clothing food prayer teaching fellowship encouragement like there was men that came and visited paul and he said you refreshed me so but to do that you have to sacrifice some of your time so it's it's always so simple god is so simple so you just look and you you have to like but also you got to listen to people in the church you know how they doing and ask them questions and that will show you how you can help them like i always try to listen like who needs money because i can help them out i got all this ties sitting here it's not a lot but i got a little bit extra i can i can help people out i just try to listen well how can i who needs it you know who can now people are so humble here they don't ask for help all the time which is okay that's how i am too you know i don't think i've ever asked any of you for a penny and i'll probably not go unless i lose my job or something like that you know and even then i have a hard time doing that but the idea is you look and look for needs in this congregation you know look for needs and how could i help uh now trustees will they've been voted to take care of this so you can look outside this because you're not a trustee uh look outside that and then look to the homes of the people look to the lives of the people how can i be a help to them does that help so we have to do it you know we have to realize we got seven days a week we got jobs first second shift i hardly see these guys you know i already see but how can we do it on a saturday or after our work or something like that we have to look for ways to serve other people okay does that help the greatest look at the life of jesus he just served everybody all the time you know he let the little children come sit on his lap and talk about the kingdom of god you know he would heal people he'd pray for people he'd sit and teach him all day right he'd teach them in the synagogue he teach them on the mount of olives he was just there helping the people praise god good good good question so it's all doctrine and no other paul says though we so he puts himself in there if paul or an angel preached any other gospel than you to you than what you've already preached let him be cursed so there's a curse for changing the doctrine of jesus christ amen as we said before so say i now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received let him be accursed and this don't always represent like cursings like demon possession or something like that like that kind of a curse it can be other simple curses upon people's lives like it could be with their finances they could be cursing their finances they could be cursed in their health right just a constant struggle they could be cursed in their families they could be cursed uh with addictions there's all remember that's the deuteronomy 28 it goes through all the curses i've preached on that we have to revisit it but it looks like all these cursings you're going to have can be in your own body right it could be hemorrhoids you know it could be all kinds of things it could be lack of sleep and sleep deprivate deprivation we've talked about that could be that there's lots of different ways the forms the curse comes into it could be spiritual blindness it could be spiritual blindness and taking the mark of the beast that could be a curse it could be dying early because of disobedience right there's many forms the curse comes into but remember this god is rich in mercy he gives warning after warning after warning after warning and when he gets to the spot he god knows they're not going to repent then he sends a curse on their lives and in paul's day it was dead death many of the people in the corinthian church brother died because they didn't treat other people in the church right he says many are sick and weakly among you because they don't discern the lord's body they don't treat the saints the right way so they're under a curse praise god paul says i beseech you and them at ephesus and i charge you preach no other doctrine so see we got one doctrine we got all the doctrine and there's no other doctrine amen he said don't give heed to fables and i look endless sometimes we get like these questions that you'll never get to the end right it just didn't go on and on i can't answer this and so like like to me like that's the flat earth but i enjoy talking about don't get around but to me like how am i ever going to get to the end of this i don't know you know how about how am i ever gonna i'd have to get in a ship and fly up in the air how am i gonna do that so to me like if i if i for me if i studied on that endlessly i'd like i i would never come to the end right and if we're not careful you know conspiracy theories like this or remember when everybody thought obama was the antichrist you remember that brother and they're like oh this the rapture is going to be in obama's presidency and then trump pence you know all the trumpets are going to blow in trump's presidency i mean it's just all this stuff you know they're just trying to distract it's endless step like you're never going to get to the end of this you can't really prove that because you have no thus saith the lord yeah obama act like the antichrist but the pope act like him more he acts more like the antichrist so see that's why we got to get down to doctrine in other words what do i need to do now praise god what can i know right now what can i understand right now what can i do and nail down right now and know that i'm doing god's will and god is pleased with me that's doctrine amen but not these endless fables and genealogies and all this kind of stuff now there are right questions and i can't wait brother bang to find out the answer was i right all these years or was i wrong about the earth because the bible makes it sound like it's flat you know but there's verses that make it sound like it's round but it's something we talk about like we can laugh about and one day we'll get the answer that's for sure how did joshua make the sun stand still how in the world do you make how do you do that well he had to make the earth stand still if the earth is rotating well is the earth rotating all the i mean it's endless i don't all i can say is what the bible says amen right like paul like paul's testimony did they hear the voice or did they not hear the voice there's a big debate on that i shared a debate with you last week was it 430 years israel was in egypt or 400. there's a debate on that nobody can really appear even the uh even the study scholars can't prove it there's just questions that god is going to leave unanswered so we got to be humble not to go down endless gender gene analogies fables think in other words don't focus on things we can't understand focus on the things we can't understand like marriage or food or man-made creeds right that's what we can understand and if i'm wrong god help me i'm just trying to you know give you some examples endless genealogies no no look what do they minister to people they just make people have more questions rather than focusing on the doctrine the things you can't understand so listen it's okay to have questions but that can be a deception of the devil too with too many questions in other words all those how many people feel like you have lots of questions all the time well you have to learn to shut down your mind at some point you gotta say lord give me the anointing of power hallelujah love and a sound mind there's some people that they don't have questions their mind must be a little slower which is okay you know god has a variety some people they just can never shut off the questions what about this what about that what about that what about well pretty soon if you don't bring that under subjection if you don't bring that that that uh part of your character under the character of christ you're gonna be going after endless things endless like there's so many websites now you can spend all your time and there's no end to websites there's no end to youtube or rumble videos i mean they just keep going when are you ever going to be satisfied you're not going to be in your human sense you have to ask the holy spirit give me grace and understanding to focus on what's most important amen i got 80 i got 70 years on this world make god help me to make the most of it amen like the bible said apply our hearts to wisdom that god would teach us to number our days amen i got one shot to make a rapture amen and i'm going to spend my time on what i know is right because i know if i live the doctrine i know the doctrine of the rapture will be fulfilled in me oh amen if i live the doctrine i know i'll be ready for the doctrine of the rapture glory so see it's okay that was wendy's you know this is a funny testament about sister wendy she's that kind of person where she has all kinds of questions and brother she would tell i think she told her testimony a few years ago she had just so many questions for brother brooks and brother craig she just wore them out she's like he's like we don't have all the answers sister and she had to learn to bring that question asking under subjection praise god so see i mean it's it's different personalities right she's just a very inquisitive person right other people could care less now the the danger on that side is just believe everything on the tops we need the leadership of the holy sermon of the holy spirit to judge between what is the holy spirit what is not the holy spirit and help me to follow the holy spirit amen now see all doctrine and no other doctrine whoever abides or continues in the doctrine of christ you have the invisible father and the son but if you transgress it like judas and you don't if you don't live in the doctrine of christ you're not born again that's why doctrine gets really serious what do you teach about the holy ghost what do you teach about the godhead what do you teach about alcohol that's really important what do you teach about i mean you just name the doctrines i'm going to name some here a little bit it's very important because if you don't if you can't be taught by the holy ghost you don't have the holy ghost if there come any under you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither been in god's speed don't let the jehovah's witnesses don't let the mormons in your house i only let them in one time and they left and they left without answering me and they never came back yeah they weren't ready for me but it was the holy ghost it wasn't me i'm not exhausted myself but they weren't ready for the holy ghost and they said they'd give back to me and they didn't and i told them i sat across that table in chicago falls i said if you love me you'll answer my question well guess what they don't love me that's why because they don't have the love of christ and that goes to all these men or all these people that you know criticized me or whatever or whatever more if you love me you come correct me with love and you wouldn't do it publicly trying to shame me you'd do it privately in love this week brother i had a very prominent preacher come up against me on my video about ministers marriage requirements he's probably the most famous evangelist right now in the message he threw out three comments and they're all quotes from brother branham and he didn't try to give any scripture now look at this that can everybody see this there's no scripture saying where i'm wrong he couldn't find any scripture and brother brahm said the holy ghost will always point you to the tapes though he said the holy ghost will only point you to the scripture i didn't tell you see what they want a quote war instead of a real sincere open look at the mirror of the holy scriptures amen that's what they want they want to quote war and i said i try to say dear brother with all the love in my heart i try to be real kind i said you're just bringing quotes you're not bringing the word of god what about all these other quotes and then this last quote you know i laid it out i'm not gonna i'm not gonna read it to you but on my on this last quote he said i'm one of those who stand with brother branham and i thought well look how prideful that is he don't give any bible answers he's point and he's exalting himself and that's the big i think sister naomi and beatrice would agree with me the biggest sin amongst message people is pride they think they know it all they can't be taught anything right pride puffs puffs up well i'll split the church and i'll do this you know all that all that pride they might be living holy they might not have adultery they might have not fornication they might not have lust of that they might have not rich things but they've got their pride and they can't be taught nothing they know all about it and i was just so shocked and i wasn't surprised though but i was shocked that a prominent minister would try to rebuke me with quotes well i said well what about the quotes that you're forgetting about over here where brother brown does say it's okay what about those and he used the same quote that voice of god uses there's a quote when roller ram says so i say in the name of jesus christ he says don't you add to those tapes brother is not talking about worshiping every word on the tape he said he said he was saying it like moses moses said i call heaven earth to witness against you of the commands that i've spoken unto you there it is amen so the bible commands on the tapes yes we must honor those in other words when the tapes point us back to the bible yes don't add to the word don't take away from the word but they're the message side that's falling away they're exalting every word on the tape and they don't even know it that's because they're blind to the word but we've got eyes that we can see amen i thought that was so strange a five-fold preacher using the same quote joseph branham uses to justify his worship of the tape and i said that's exactly and his wife put a post years ago on facebook and i screenshot it i still got it on my phone today and she said uh don't don't question anything in the message just believe all the message so see the most famous evangelists today probably their family and their their marriage has the spirit of idolatry worshiping the tapes but they're so accepted all over and you know some of our beliefs might not be but that's okay as long as i got bible for mine i'm happy praise god you want to see that i'll show it to you praise god now i didn't mean to say that but now let's finally get this after all those minutes here we go now i can only get to the i had to lay that groundwork everybody okay with that i delayed that groundwork so you could see now as we look at doctrines of devils see how the devil brings these in all right in the end times now i just want to show this to austelina uh there's something called a lexicon and that has all the meanings of the hebrew words from the bible now the lexicon is not perfect like i clicked on devil yesterday you see what doctrines of devils devil means the ones it can mean so it means like a spirit too it means like the one supreme being like almighty god because they used like spirit can mean devil or devil's a spirit so see the lexicon isn't always right lexicon also says god's a trinity of persons and that so see you got to be careful with lexicon too but it does give many helpful definitions right original meanings from the the aramaic or the greek or the hebrew so i just want to show the word depart here brother austin and lena it means to draw away to fall away and you've got to have to sift through these to see which one fits the context of the revelation of the scripture it means to withdraw to remove to excite to revolt against the truth so when the bible says some will revolt or deport depart from the faith they'll revolt against the truth they won't want the truth anymore they'll stand off they'll go away they'll depart from anyone they'll desert or withdraw from the faith so the bible says they're gonna depart or withdraw or fight against the faith why because they gave heed to a seducing demon seducing means deceptive demon i'll tell you church it's get it's getting more and more close i listened to a sermon yesterday for one of those guys doing their impartation he preached so much truth but then that manifestation i i caught a couple of lies in there he said oh if you just do it this way you're going to churches grow bigger and bigger and bigger that's the opposite of jesus that's the opposite of saint paul who got smaller and smaller and smaller and fewer and fewer and fewer as they went along so you can always catch there was so much truth in there so much truth what he was saying but then there's little lies in there see it's getting so close to see the very elected if it were possible but it will not deceive us because we pray we got the holy ghost we fast amen we believe the word of god we preach the truth we're humble we can be corrected by the holy spirit now here's breaking it down so what do they do they turn they hold on to they get addicted to they give heed to a misleading an imposter teaching from a devil they the devil get preaches something about they teach them to do something and they grab a hold on that and they won't let it go this is how doctrines of demons get into the churches they but they first have to let go of the truth in order to grab the lie and they hold on to that they get addicted to that in church these are two examples from the early church two examples from the early church can you imagine i i'll try to explain it here by god's grace remember the holy ghost said people would depart from the faith in the latter or end times this means that people were in the faith once but decided to abandon the faith jesus said people can fall away or can believe for a while before rejecting their belief because fall away means you depart how we know that i don't know all these people say once saved always say have they read their bible lately jesus said you can believe for a while but then fall away from it you can actually have the anointing of the holy spirit for a while but then later reject that anointing and depart and leave christianity but if you're born again you'll never leave amen i'll say this and if you're a real faithful faithful foolish virgin you'll never leave either because they get saved too they get saved too but they just never get the wisdom of god to redeem the time see jesus christ said you can believe for a while but then fall away depart revolt against the faith yes yes yes yes sir wow that's that's very humble brother very humble i would say i did too brother because when i i told in my testimony i was trying to serve god until fifth grade and then i heard amy grant she crossed over into the world and that spirit of seduction just took me away and i was trying to get girlfriends in fifth grade brother van i'm trying to get girlfriends i was sixth grade that that's the spirit of lust he was trying to take me down the wrong road but thank god for the protection of the holy spirit brother i say we all you know we've all probably done this sometime time in our very young life not now you know but in our young life we all we all fall short of god's glory now though every day every day we fall short some some area of our lives good question great question just as a person can give or easily receive god's gifts like faith you can all say about to don't throw away your confidence confidence is an anointing amen may god give us the anointing amen for the rapture how many want to be confident that you'll go in the rapture amen that's an anointing amen don't throw that away if god brings you don't throw it away don't look at anything else just look at the word amen hallelujah see that's why some days people give me up i'm going to rapture the next day they're like oh man they cast it away they had the anointing when they let something deceive them in that case if they're depressed it's a spirit of heaviness the bible calls it they let this demon depression come upon them and whisper in their ear and pretty soon they get anointed with that depression and now i don't have any confidence for the rapture i'm a failure well of course you are that's why you need a savior and that's why you need this grace every day praise god brother man said i'm always a failure amen he said there's only one that's not a failure and that's the lord jesus christ amen hallelujah look at it after the seals i'm always a failure glory none of us uh none of us will ever be perfect amen but we're all pointing to the perfect one amen glory now the just shall live by faith not feelings and the church said you're gonna have feelings brother i've had a woman come up to me last two years ago she'd been serving god 50 years brother she came up and said i don't even feel like i'm saved well i said check your life at some point you must have got a complex and i think that's what it was she didn't tell me but she was weeping and crying and she got he's sick and god did america in her life i mean it's amazing so she's back in the house of god today and beautiful testimony but that's why we don't live by feelings because god may take his god may take his hedge from over you like job and you won't feel nothing you'll feel nothing supernatural like you let brother amen get sick right he cried out but amen that's a good example that's sisterhood god let them get sick and they don't feel nothing they pray they pray they sing gratitude and they say oh they don't feel nothing but they know there's faith in a prayer cloth amen they know the gospel is right amen they just hang there just stay with god even though you don't feel it they chose not to live by sight they live by faith amen hallelujah and they didn't cast away their confidence in christ amen look where they are today they're in the house of god a good example but see we're tempted to what draw back and the bible says if you draw back if you leave the faith god has no pleasure in you but we are not amen our church is not of those drawer backers we're of the followers honors we're the keeper honors amen we're the rugged soldiers that keep their confidence we keep moving on with jesus christ amen we believe unto what the saving of the soul until the soul gets a new body a new body to live in amen a glorified body or if the rapture be glorified in theophany we keep believing to the saving to the end that our soul gets a new body a glorified body did you know faith can be thrown away faith can also also be stomped upon so i just showed you throw away throw in your confidence what is confidence just faith in the word right so you can throw away people can throw away their faith they can also stomp and smash on the blood of jesus christ the bible says it and it gets a sore punishment when you stomp on it and you curse against it and you speak against it blast him against it it's a sore punishment it for those who have trod and underfoot the son of god that means to tread down to trample on they look they're rude to preachers my they're read they're rude to you because you're a representative of jesus christ on this earth when they speak evil you're the rude that's why you better pray for those that persecute you pray for them pray for them who despitefully use you when they insult you that's trampling down the message that you're bringing you're bringing the message of jesus christ insulting they treat you with insulting neglect see they should come to church they should listen to you but they neglect it the bible said there's sore punishment for them see because what they're living the opposite they're living despite they're living against the spirit of grace how many living by grace today amen grace and peace be unto you amen we saw that last sunday amen god's favor upon you and may his peace be upon you but they don't want god's grace they don't want god's gifts they'd rather have the love of the world they'd rather have doctrines of devils pretty stern message today by god the great side i knew studying yesterday this is gonna be a good sermon i feel it i start feeling that anointing come around here and oh my it's gonna be a good one god help me now finishing that verse for every creature of god is good and nothing to be refused if it be received with thanksgiving for it is sanctified by the word of god in prayer if thou put the brethren now he's talking to timothy in remembrance of these things thou shalt be a good minister of jesus christ nourish up in the words of faith and of good doctrine whereunto thou hast attained now search somewhere i want to before i get into this i i had more about the marriage and the food so i'm skipping down here oh yeah yeah i'm sorry i'm gonna skip past this oh man i gotta skip this i got some good illustrations i hope it'll help austin lina and faith but let me skip down here yeah so i'm going to bring this through here's the attributes of doctrines of devils i'll try to go quickly through here so what do these lying preachers do they impersonate the truth and they teach demonic desires because the holy ghost does not desire these lies and what do they do they lie as hypocrites they do not practice what they preach so watch a preacher watch my life if i don't live what i preach then you come talk to me because i'm doing everything i can to live what i preach that's why i lay at the altar that's why i lay in my closet that's why i humble myself and repent every day because i'm trying to live what i preach and their consciences their right and wrong morality of right and wrong it's burned and it's branded and allows them to lie they've got so used to lying like our current administration the white house they get so used to lying they can lie at a drop of a hat even when caught in a lie they'll make another lie to protect their lie now of course every administration has liars i'm not i'm just saying it's so obvious now that so obvious now this is preachers preachers will lie from the pulpit and give people doctrines of devils so here's the two examples these are clear doctrines of devils now this is a scripture read god created both of these acts marriage and meat eating to be a blessing but satan turned them into sin and these are examples of catholic legalism and they say and they still to this day mandate catholic priests cannot marry and they don't eat meat around easter time it's a command if you don't do it you're not a good catholic and did you know church before i move on the catholics said at the council of trump that any protestant who doesn't accept catholic doctrine is accursed and they've never repented of it so don't believe all this that the catholic church and the lutheran are back together i showed that video that's a lie from hell when those councils meet together they have the authority of the pope those things never change so see those catholic priests they lie and say we've got unity they're lying amen they just lie right through their teeth they're liars like devils like serpents amen he's the father of lies amen so every catholic that's honest today and knows history knows that no protestant is blessed in the catholic mind so if they say it they're lying to you they don't mean god bless you they mean god curse you so don't believe them believe the word i just gotta lay that in there there so you just so you see that stuff sorry i'm not sorry sorry not sorry i guess i'm not sorry i just don't mean to be so rough that's what i'm saying they forbid to marry abstain from meats notice satan targeted sexuality and food it's the same today but to me it's the opposite to me it's well they were saying preachers kept marrying now now the church is saying you can marry whoever you want same devil trying to bring a mandated lie upon the church and now it's oh you don't have to fast you can eat whatever you want there's no restraint you can drink social drinking you can drink wine at the you can drink beer at the restaurant that's a lie see so what it's the same devil but just a little different spin on their false doctrine and the church said because as it was in the days of noah so will be in the days of the son of man that's what jesus said so by the austin elena however it was in the days of noah and sodom that's how it's going to be at the end time and what was it they were just eating and drinking marin they weren't even concerned about the wrath about the destruction they weren't concerned about noah and getting in the ark they just overeating and drinking and all drunkenness you know marriages all these worldly things in other words caught up in the spirit of it and of course lot was homosexuality they ate bought drinks so planted and then fire and brimstone reigned the day lot went out of sodom even thus shall be in the day when the son of man is revealed so that's what works we're expecting more of those conditions praise god and notice paul links meat and sexuality together because meat eating of course is uh taking the mouth right and the bible says the bible likens eating to sexuality it's a symbol of sexuality right proverbs 30 verse 20 an adulterous woman eateth and wipeth her mouth and saying i've done no evil so eating is a symbolism of sexuality and paul connects these in first corinthians 6 12. meets for the belly belly for the meats he said now god is not the body is not for fornication but for the lord and the lord the body interesting what you eat is very connected uh to your your sexuality as well whether you're abstinent or pure right and then paul said enemies of the cross will overeat because their god is their belly they worship themselves they worship any way they can get more food or any way they can get more money they worship that that becomes their god okay now it's all deeper here but here i want to bring this in should a saved wife in the message or christian refuse herself to her husband if he's a sinner no sir by the way said no sir that's your husband you'll drive him farther away from god than ever by doing that right that's right brother sister you married him he's yours you're hit you're his so the devil at the beginning said you're pre you preachers in ephesus you're not as spiritually mature if you marry a wife and look they could have used some of paul's words in first corinthians seven where paul said if you're married then you know you're you care about the things of your your wife more than things of the lord see how this how slick the devil is tried to make him feel you're not as much of a preacher if you marry but then brother branham says there's most men right most men that don't have the gift of celibacy it's a gift most men it will drive you crazy if you don't have that outlet in your life for the passion god put the passion in there right so they can be fruitful and multiply but look the devil tries to deceive these earthly you're not as much of a man as paul look at that wow the devil said that you'd preach it's from these preachers you shouldn't be married if you're a real preacher because then you can be devoted like paul was you're you're a prophet but brother brahm says if you forbid your husband that sisters you drive him further from god so see how see how a man is connected with god and his sexuality see if a man doesn't have that outlet he he's more attempt to be or he's more likely to be tempted away from god see how close that is connected church that's why our sisters got to be mindful of that that's why our brothers got to be mindful of their sister's needs too praise god but the devil said if you're real spiritual you wouldn't be married at all paul said you devil you imagine paul reading that i said you bunch i wonder who if timothy read that i said you bunch of devil preachers don't you know a man don't have that outlet he's gonna go crazy unless he has that gift that's why the bible said let every man have a wife right to avoid what fornication in other words a normal man is going to sleep around if he because he's got that passion in his heart so let him get married let him get married church i'm preaching you doctrines of devils today a doctrine of the devil you can't marry now it's oh you can marry whoever you want same devil same lie but we marry who god leads us to mary praise god and then we stay faithful to our promise we keep our vows hallelujah jesus christ said oh after jesus you said you know you can't divorce for any reason he told his disciples you know what they said they said who he they said who can receive this what kind of man can receive this think about that even his own disciples so see under sanctification brothers you don't have the real revelation of marriage and divorce that's why these churches out there without the holy ghost they'll let people marry divorce adultery all these things because even jesus own disciples are like oh this is harsh can't divorce our wives anymore of course they didn't but when jesus cut off that ability to do that what happened they said who can receive this and jesus said all men cannot receive the same saving them whom it is given yeah the disciples said well maybe none of us should marry he said it's only for those who it's given to he said some men were born from their womb never to marry a wife he said others were made that way by men the teaching of men just convinced them never get married he said others were made others eunuchs decided that because they loved the kingdom of god so much he said whoever's able to receive it let him receive it paul said i would that all men now look they could use this the the ephesian false preachers could say look paul said i wish every he wished everybody was like him and yet those brothers had those passions in them and they had to decide there and they didn't realize it was a devil trying to trick them trying to thank god after if they got delivered they could get married again they got thank god for that but that was a devil trying to deceive them about their marriage he said i say to the unmarried and widows it is good for them if they abide even as i they could have said see it's good for you why can't you be a real man of god you preachers and not mary that's the devil telling him that that's why you gotta have the holy spirit and take everything back to the word of god well you could say well hey preacher peter had a wife and he walked on water right and jesus even healed his mother-in-law so what's wrong with preachers having wives and he even had the keys of the kingdom brother hallelujah praise god amen see so unbalanced what are they doing they're straining out a net and swallowing a camel i'm preaching hard today help me lord see concerning marriage and meat eating the devils teach abstinence and yet priests rape the victims that shows they're hypocrites they're lying in hypocrisy the nuns do it too they rape little girls it's all over the news a couple years ago it's in my book the devils teach absence from meat yet they eat fish and jesus said anybody got any meat here and they hand them a fish fish is meat and they say if you don't stop eating meat you're not observing the reason you're good enough you devil easter ain't about what i eat naturally it's what i eat spiritually i didn't praise god amen it's about my spiritual diet you devil it's not about my natural diet paul took time enough church to show these people they had doctrines of devils and related to their diet and their sexuality all right uh let's see we started started preaching okay so uh give me 15 minutes here i'm a set timer thank you for your patience uh has anybody anyone been blessed by the word today okay good i'd like to hear that but if it's quiet i'd close up shop okay guys have a good good service let's let's close and sing in the area praise god thank god uh i think um yeah let me go do this anointing part i think this will help austin alina you know i always want to be mindful and the children too so children you guys are ready to pay attention your children okay i can go over this tonight again if you want let me go i made some visuals i thought it would be help to you yeah just here so i just want to understand the anointing on the human spirit a little more uh we showed this last a couple months ago but also i don't know if you're here i don't think you were so everybody has a soul right but in your mind you have these five channels to your mind the bible says don't give a place in your mind to the devil here's what happens we let old memory come up well i remember when brother jesse did that man he just i can't believe that now every time i think about brother jesse i'm upset about brother jesse because the devil bring back a bad memory well what if brother jesse said he's sorry you don't let the devil build it back what if brother jesse didn't say sorry come talk to me about it praise god don't let the devil build up a castle to attack me in your mind or anybody your mom dad grandma anybody right and the holy ghost is to pull down those strongholds amen those complexes see now here um i don't know why i put the cigarette smoke on there i had a cigarette i don't know oh i could i think i was showing my life you know yeah yeah that's what i was showing i'm sorry i forgot to switch over no no no okay there it is i don't know what happened there maybe i didn't look at it long enough so i was telling by the austin that after i got saved i would have i'm sorry before i was saved this is what i had i had all these evil imaginations especially sexual temptations or you know desires to go to the pros and the football to get rich you know i had all the i had all these i had all these complexes demon thoughts and then what'd that lead to my addiction to cigarettes and tobacco and drinking alcohol and all kinds of right and so the holy ghost comes to pull down all those it comes to clear out the land amen like the holy ghost tell jeremiah he said you pull down those strongholds you root them up and then you plant the word of god there amen hallelujah you clear the land start afresh and build something that glorifies god amen build a life build a thought life build a prayer life that honors jesus christ amen build that hallelujah you're going to build that in one day as you guys know you're going to build that one day you got to develop habits it takes time staining the word keeping your mind on the word of god praying more often it takes time hallelujah here's why i want to show here let me see if i got any uh no i don't okay so you have a soul and then you here's here's those five realms again now like here's what i said here many times we can be saved in our soul like you if you have the holy ghost today you have the holy ghost here that yellow represents the holy ghost but you can also have complexes in your mind so you can have the holy anointing here and i look yours all these other anointings of god can be on these but you got one memory that's really keep holding you back that's just like brother branham right with uh critical spirits pride so in our minds we can have good anointing and then the wrong anointing right now here's another one now as you become a christian now i was asking a good question about this when you get saved you get that anointing of faith in your mind right now you got faith you got trust in god then as you keep going on you get virtue where's virtue yeah that's right she looks i see i love they smile every time they hear their voice you got the nature of god there you go i love those bible names you know you keep going on then you get the knowledge of god that's what i was saying with uh uh different people i i don't want to call it names there but they can have they can all have all this public testimony but they can't understand that god didn't call women to preach they don't have that now they don't have that understanding they can't understand that tongues are not the evidence of the holy ghost you know right like at the church brother like i'm glad they spoke in tongues but pretty soon they're not gonna i mean you can't speak in tongues every time you have a battle you know because god god sends the tongues you don't you don't command that's the trouble they got they try to command the tongues you can't do that you can't you don't hold god in your pocket like okay well now i'm gonna do a gift now no you wait till god gives you the gift you're waiting say god give me the give me the tongue or give me the revelation give me the wisdom yes lord okay now i got it here you go but it's not like well i keep it in my pocket i can use it whatever i want that's the lie that satan tells them and so then they start then they start fake speaking in tongues just the same as they do fake healings and all kinds anything you receive it's by grace god's grace to you but see they can have they can have faith in virtue but not knowledge right then we get anointed for temperance we can control our bodies our sexual and other passions of the bodies right uh then we get patience to wait on the lord see god keeps filling your mind with all this anointing amen and the church said then you get broadly kindness am i now you're just your mind is all anointed with the things of god and then after that then you get the baptism of the holy ghost praise god there's your soul and then the fire of god here i got one more click to do okay no oh yeah then the bible says yeah see this is this is the anointing it comes add to your faith virtue add the anointings see you go from glory to glory you become a better christian all the time you receive more of god's anointing amen and then one of these days one of these great days the holy ghost fire comes into your soul amen jesus said john baptized you with water he said but i'm coming to baptize you with the holy ghost and with fire amen hallelujah and the pentecostals most times got strange fire which is a demon fire that's right i'm gonna show that to you because they they got the wrong doctrine they got all this and then they act like they're in pain that ain't the holy ghost that is not i've never seen that that's not the holy ghost yes the holy ghost will make you pass out yes the holy ghost will make you shake but not in pain like a devil does because satan comes to torment you satan comes to steal kill and destroy and the way to know is watch their life afterwards and all these people have the fruits of ecumenicalism one world religion love the pope okay to divorce and marry and remarry okay to fake speaking in tongues it's a lie they're fruit by their fruits amen jesus said by their fruits you'll know them thank god that we have good fruit here amen our fruit is incorruptible amen but their fruit is corruptable you're a holy tree so thank god abide in the branch abide in the vine branches and bring forth the fruit of christ amen now here again you have your i focus on these two parts here uh yeah so let me go back there yeah so you so just we don't have to spend as much time on the flesh right now maybe we will at a later time but it's uh we would have to differentiate between the human spirit and the soul now remember church you can be saved yet anointed with the evil spirit so let me i just want to show this again so australia can get that one so you guys got it peter repented and followed jesus in mark 1. in john 4 he was already baptizing others proving he's already saved because how can he baptize people to get saved if he hasn't done it himself in matthew 11 he went out and preached to cities with all the power to heal every manner of sickness and disease in matthew 14 he walks on water uh now luke 9 should have been up here with matthew 11. so i'm sorry but otherwise he got all the power and then he walked on water two chapters later mark in matthew 16 brother austin jesus said i've got to go suffer and be killed and i'm skipping down here peter took him and said lord be it far from you to die this will not be done unto you in other words peter said you're not gonna you have to go to the cross no one's gonna kill you we're gonna have we're gonna have our whole lifetimes with this mighty miracle ministry see peter was leaning on the flesh of jesus right but jesus turned to peter and said get thee behind me satan he said it to peter who had already walked on water he'd already baptized he'd seen all manner of miracles he was baptizing others and i never find jesus apologizing for this he said thou art an offense unto me he's not talking to peter he's talking to satan who's influencing peter for thou lovest not savers not the things that are of god but the things that be amen remember jesus later later when he the night he was arrested he said simon i prayed for you satan has desired to have you see how satan was trying to get into peter's life he was trying to get into the man who had the keys to the kingdom he was trying to get him to do false doctrines right doctrines of devils see satan wants to sift you as weed he wants to shake up your life and just blow away your life and blow all your hopes away but i prayed for you that's your faith doesn't fail amen church let's pray for one another amen pray that the other person's faith doesn't fail pray that their faith prevails amen we also have to pray for one another praise god let brother van gaan let brother austin say unless all our brothers love our sisters stand god help their faith to stand in the trial amen and even though he denied christ three times he never forsook christ he never sold out christ like judas did you can have some real bad failures and jesus is still going to forgive you hallelujah you can have satan himself anointing you but if you repent jesus is still going to forgive you that's the love of god so what did peter have peter had faith i'm just giving an illustration here brother i could you know i'm i'm not saying this is exactly right but he at least had faith to preach right he at least had virtue to preach publicly but then he look look he let the dev he had this reasoning well lord you're doing all these things no you that's not of god for you to go to die on the cross he built up a complex from satan in his mind he reads and said you've only been ministering three and a half years or maybe three years at this point we have the rest of our lives you're not going to go die what do you mean talking about die we just got we're just getting started you don't have to die and jesus said get behind me satan he realized it wasn't peter was peter a predestinated seed absolutely but he got the other good anointing but he didn't have enough of it and he got the bad anointing in one area of his mind so i hope that's helpful by god's grace he didn't lose all this right he still had this but in one channel he got a complex he got a demonic thought from satan now churchill we're humble if we're humble we can all say sometimes we take thoughts from demons amen i just trust we have a real honest church today praise god uh let me look at this section this might be a long section one two okay i already looked at those okay the next section okay yeah let me um boy this is a long one here okay yeah to help me lord i should probably be praying during this time help me jesus help me to find the right place help me lord i sort of need your grace i don't want to go too long here um okay i got three minutes okay yeah three minutes okay so yeah let me just finish this up here i'll i'll just start this next section okay um let's look at more doctrines of devil so i'm going to skip ahead here i need to that's what i need to learn how to do a pray you know about the direction okay so i'll just go three minutes on this i'll stop the live stream i have you stand and i'll show you those visuals i shared on wednesday so you can because we have to start digging into those and see how much of this is of the devil these message doctrines now eventually i'll preach on them publicly but i'm just like in this early stage of studying these because you have to be able to classify them well if this is a false doctrine which devil is this right and you have to find examples of that in the bible right it's like the no fasting one well you can find that the bible said they'll have gluttony you know we can find okay that's this but what spirit what demon is that is that pride which one is that i believe it's idolatry because you're making yourself your whole focus you're loving your there it is you're loving yourself more than god you're giving your body more than what it needs because you love your body more than you love god okay so that's what i'm saying it takes each one you gotta look at it and say is this the devil or not what is this is this era of christian liberty remember every ever christian liberty it doesn't make you more like god if you do it or doesn't make you less like god it's just an area of liberty like jewelry it says now of course everyone can be taken too far wine drinking that can be taken too far holy days feast days all that can be taken so far but which ones are devils okay and i've already preached them that are you know like making every word by the way i'm saying making him infallible okay so okay actually i didn't even yeah i must have skipped that too so here we can clearly see doctrines of devils in the bible mandatory celibacy mandatory vegetarian diet it's okay if you're vegetarian just save the steak for me okay if you ever go out i'll eat the steak you just set off on the side uh the rapture is passed paul said that eats like a canker that's such a demonic see because it makes them give up well what is there to look forward to see that's why we got to always be looking for the rapture praise god it will the bible says it overthrows people's faith well what is there to live for there's no hope but our hope is jesus christ returning amen and each generation must have that hope amen they must have that hope within them or else they'll give up and say oh it's all going to it's all going to communism it's all going to russia it's all going to the democrats or whatever you know whatever there's no hope for the future oh yeah they say the lord returned in 1963 cloud so there's no fasting needed that's a brother told me boy he's had trouble since then five they turned the grace of god into lawlessness the bible said men of men of corrupt ends their end is corruption their end is destruction men who are ordained to death in hell turn grace into lawlessness you can live however you want and you're still going to have grace that's lawlessness that's lashiviousness that's a doctrine of hell now these will all be preached in a deceptive way right they're demon-inspired they'll be preached by hypocrites that don't live what they preach because their consciences are numb and they cannot feel the conviction of the holy ghost like that one guy with fasting i looked at him and he's way overweight he's probably 50 pounds overweight well don't you know you're going to get heart disease from that don't you know you're going to get cancer don't you know you're going to get diabetes and they're going to blame it on the devil but you did it it wasn't well i guess it was a devil one since like they fouled the devil's worship of himself they accepted the devil's anointing to be their own god but then they blamed the devil like the devil made me do it no you wanted to do it praise god my 15 minutes are up so let's stand to our feet you can stop the livestream there hun god bless everybody my musicians can come i just want to show well you know actually stay there so you can so you can see that i think the kids so maokai and lydia you've already seen it so i just want to give a few examples god bless the livestream
