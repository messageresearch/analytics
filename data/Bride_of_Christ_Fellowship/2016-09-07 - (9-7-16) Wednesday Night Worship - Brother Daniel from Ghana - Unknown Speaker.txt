Zachariah he asks a career know what not what is he he said no my lord I don't know that we can God yes that in this anytime we know what it is Alleluia he realized that he said he saw the southern lungs much stunning with two beliefs three stunning side-by-side one for the left side and one other on the right side and we know that prophets say that these people live trees are stunning for the old tests on and a new testament and what that olive tree does he produces oil amen okay because that the priests in the temple they always need oil to be put into her into that plum forgot Allah can be dead without the aisle they love cannot pen name n so the initial that at all times the put oil into the last that is why that the angel showed Zachariah about the tupolev trees and a prophecy that

Paul put it is it also pointed to be a light unto the Gentiles right yesterday I was a party our glory oh can we just read a scripture quick yes I think it's an octa our tech team after 13 and out in relief from this for football yes her worried when after detecting oh sorry mm-hmm yes actually 30 verse 44 is it and another birthday came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God but when the Jews saw the multitude they they were filled with envy and spec against those things which were spoken by porta dos por was produced something that seem contrary to the Jewish belief yes but they did it know that Paul has meant a pillar of fire on the way to Damascus worry and now say that the tender he studied previously he has through all of them away right now it is what the Holy Spirit tells him to that is what he does yeah so did not understood him and gay where Phil would envy contradict him and blasphemy yes whatever Polebridge to contradict it yes and back on track victim

what a wonderful scripts are about there is a God say that about part able to be a light unto the Gentiles power gonna get a sausage right but because the Jews themselves did not you know to not take the revelation of Christ through Paul was given to death is it no the loss that I should come to the Gentiles because they are nothing alike on today right so Paul well the first man to take that light yes and got into the darkness of the judge else we to leave the sons and daughters of God back to God yeah that was a local today the dead idea if you reject all know rejected the light of God
