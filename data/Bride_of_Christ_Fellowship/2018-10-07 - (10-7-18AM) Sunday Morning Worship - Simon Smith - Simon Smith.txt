right minds today how many's ready to push on just want to get into the Word of God you want to always be mindful the unrecognized presence of Jesus Christ and as we continue every day in our lives we go closer and closer to understanding God to get a real taste and feel of them you know if you're really honest with yourself and sincere every moment every day you should examine yourselves with one another now yours know one another but yourselves way every action every thought every detail very mindful of the things we think and say and do and Mota's objectives those sort of things so we want to go right into the Word of God I don't have a gift like brother Isaiah Brooks brother cam Smith brother Jesse Smith these pastors are loved singing in the spirit and our people are blessed by the the ministry of song and they have all those things well I kind of see myself if I if I had to explain myself I see maybe a brother Jesse up here preaching then I'm the guy in the back just trying to jump over his shoulders I get him that's right that's right that's really cams preach and I'm like behind him like that's exactly it so back up by the grace of God and I'm feeling more and more comfortable in this little helping position just help my brothers out and what an honor it is to have warrior brethren in the flesh and spiritual that we can just help it really is an honor really is an honor so if we could by the grace of God I want to go into a little topic turn to Ezekiel 9 1 I do have a little PowerPoint broken by the grace of God hopefully this will be a blessing it may go a certain way I've taught on him before brother side why do you keep hitting these things why Noah keeps saying it's gonna rain 120 years if it's gonna rain it's gonna rain the rain is coming I see the clouds prepare yourselves come into the ark repent and be baptized the name Jesus Christ he keeps opening things he's been dealing with me now for almost eight months or nine months on the on the on the name and things that I was nature and last weekend I was with our precious brother sayest there and his daughter and son-in-law here and granddaughter and he was oh he's a real warrior aged learned a lot I said very little as little as I could around him and I just wanted to glean it was the time for gleaning time to talk time to shut up and I'm trying to find the right time for that so let's read these things almost set you down by the grace of God Ezekiel 9 1 he cried also in my mine ears with a loud voice saying calls them that have charged over the city to draw near every man with his destroying weapon in hand ice power heads Lord we want to be so reverent orde we love you so much Lord and we're not trying to do any cut up Lord or jokes or anything Lord we want to be sincere and reverent Lord and Lord you just guide this service Lord just Oh topic or to spend on my heart and this was placed here Lord and I just want to get this out by the grace of God and we prepare it to be a blessing where we love you Lord and we thank you for an opportunity Lord to come speak Lord to minister to your children Lord this is your bride Lord the rest have come and gone they're sleeping now they're resting over there over beyond the curtain of time Lord but Lord you still have this little bit right here this last capstone peek of a bride Lord just waiting here Lord and we're in the greatest our Lord er the greatest temptation the greatest deceptions and Lord God we are in desperate need of you we love you so much Lord and Lord we thank you for loving us even more than we can imagine Lord for you to keep her Lord you're the keeper we love you Lord bless the seal service Lord take control this little little guy up here Lord and all those in the seats there a named Jesus Christ a man you may have your seats bring greetings back from my pastor but I am we're pressing on there in Napoleon like we always do like you guys are pressing on here and I was when I heard brother Jesse long long time ago he was coming to Akron and then he God took football away from him and a coach said brother looks like you're playing for a different team now he's a yep yes I am and the Lord set up shop here is is the son I want you to pastor here in Akron Akron means what pinnacle or the high peak or Amen so there's something to it and I always like one thing that way stuck with me as sister Wendy said you know he he lives what he preaches and she said I can respect that so any home let's get into this by the grace of God Ezekiel 9 1 he that cried also in mine ears with a loud voice saying calls them that have charged over the city to draw near even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand and this morning like to teach on an urgent inkhorn writer saints of God that Ezekiel one is a very powerful section of Scripture we know judgment is to strike the destroying angels are prepped they're ready I got to talk and listen to brother science there or any science and he said brother do you realize he said that first whoa he says with the first world war he says in the destroying angels the four winds he said were right there he says the world was supposed to be destroyed right then but then in that time the war stopped at a miraculous time on the eleventh day eleventh month eleventh eleventh hour' showing what we're crossing now over into the into the midnight hour he said and look how far and what it was this year or was it last year the hundredth year anniversary of World War one the ending or however and look how the mercies of God are now he told mote Noah he says build that Ark he says and God let that he let him preach for a hundred and twenty years just waiting for everyone to hear the word of God he says and now he's in the World War two he says look we've had a hundred years now to bring this word in about 50 or 60 to bring this message the real light not a man-made light not a denomination or light not something that has a lot of questions in it but saints of God something solid we can point back to the Word of God and say this is exactly it amen so an urgent in corner writer let's read just a little bit a portion of this hope is all right Sunday morning stretch your arms a little bit maybe wave them like this if you're feeling a little tired or brother Malachi yes absolutely yes we're could get that get that blood flowing I got little arms or little eagle wings here my little eagle and legs absolutely why don't come chicken legs I call me go legs you gotta get that blood flowing get that oxygen pumping in there keep keep that natural disease out it will keep the spiritual disease out as well Ezekiel 19 says behold six men came from the way of the higher gate which live towards the north notice the north is there right we've taught on the east gate extensively one time we came here but not we're gonna deal with the north gate he says and which lieth towards the north and every man a slaughtering weapon is handed and one among them was clothed with linen with old with the writer's inkhorn by his side and they went in and stood by the brazen altar he says in the glory of God of Israel was gone up from the chair where he was to the threshold of the house and he called to the man clothed in linen which had the inkhorn riders he says the writers inkhorn by his side and now he says and the Lord said unto me go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem now he's dealing with now with the city of Jerusalem right this is God's city this is the this is the City of David and what the man that had a heart after God's own heart he says set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for the abominations that's done in the midst thereof so he says he says of the cities as there's some people that's know what's going on in the city there's some people who are aware of lost people of situations and things that are not right going on in this city and he says he says the ones that are crying out against these things he says mark them in their forehead right he says enter the others now that was a commission to the what though the in corn rider he says mark that mark those in this city right he says he says but everyone else there was not marked he says and to the others he said in mine hear hearing he says go ye after him through the city and smite let not your eyes spare neither have me pity look at the grace of God once again we know everything's election everything is predestination now look what he says here in the seal of them of the Christ 1955 he says I want to ask you something if that angel came to the city which was the Holy Ghost he says dressed in white like to his purity if that angel came to the city tonight and went through the Pentecostal churches where no world he find amend that sighs and cries he says he says embeds all night in prayer he says for the abominations have done in the city he says who would he mark he's not talking about there back in his eq9 he's talking about right now because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and if he's gonna bring a judgement back there in Ezekiel and he brought one bullet all the way back and no his Danny warned and he warned and he warned he says and if there's the greatest judgment that what has never been compared upon the face you earth is about ready to strike in this world when he do it again absolutely he would yes why cuz he's a righteous God he's a just God he's a loving God but he's also a God that don't play games he says who would II Marquis it was going to find out who's got the Holy Ghost pretty soon he says sighing and crying I thought a long time ago back home a little study on the two filters he says and these two filters you have to get through these two filters and one was I thought the first filter was what communion because if you take that communion unworthily and what if you failed to take communities and you actually get sick spiritually and you could affect your natural body and die and thus the last filters the rapture the proving grounds getting in the presence of God real serious he says why be we become so grazed and so indifferent have a little-bitty prayer he says and maybe when we get up he says oh god bless me and Mary's and Martha tell the rest of the family rest and then do the best they can and the men and women are sitting in the street and already saying we get we got thrown these little prayers we have at night and say O Lord save my momma save my daddy safe to save this but what about the man you just saw yesterday on in entering in the bar the ortho or the Banda building that has all the nakedness in there or or whatever what about these people who meet on the street Saints we have to cry for what those last Souls he's talking about soil travail not just the ones we love but who does love how many sons of God without blessed to have a family like yours oh we have multiple your actually brother believes this message I got to I got three brothers that believe this message how many of us some people don't have that to go on he says no burden for the loss just let them go anyway as long as they can cross the light a little bit and help our cause out fix up our denomination or message church or whatever it be the biggest and get more people in their churches that we just beget just satisfied brother he says that's good old castor oil he's but I'll fix you up saints of God we need a real soul travail absolutely witness to your co-workers witness to the ones on the street when you go and I like how brother Micah home does it whenever he's anywhere he always says and he asked the people how you doing and he's always hoping for a response he says but much like our doing sir they says well how you doing easy he always says blessed and highly favored why because he's poor not a little fishing lure their little bigs it's all she's identifying since I'm a Christians and what about you and he's waiting for response absolutely blessed and highly favored because only a Christian would say that hey man this is now questions and answers notice that was back in 55 now we're going post seals he says the exact same thing he says now what now this is question the answers he says he says now let me give you a little twister here in moaña I'd say how many has the Holy Ghost the lion today how many has the Holy Spirit absolutely living and breathing and pumping his energy in and out of you absolutely he's leading and guiding you how many's got the Holy Ghost oh my he says he said alright I'll see if you have the Bible said that they they had the Holy Ghost sighed and cried day and night for the abominations done in the city god helps pieces now how many hands would go up after this we know ourselves better than anyone outside of Christ oh my goodness are we concerned about cares in our own life or are we concerned about others god help us how many you can't rest at night so full of joy the power of God and so sad for the people that's lost that day and I knew weep and cry from the abominations you sees is what would that be in that city how many is it that's in the church that the Bible said that he said the Holy Spirit was the evidence amen all right pretties gone once again here he says he says that and then he brings that about the sighing and crying he works it into Ezekiel 9 again alright he said he said that obviously represented the Holy Ghost right and now let's continue on he says that's the reason in this day that we're coming and we're coming right into a minute he says here in the New Testament where there'll be a seal of God is the Holy Ghost he says and out that he says is the slaughter saints of god this is not coming down just to a spiritual thing this is coming down to a physical life and death it's not just spiritual as well even though that's the most important thing but it's also coming down to a martyrdom if we fail to receive the baptism the Holy Ghost absolutely and of course dealing with Ezekiel 9 you have to throw the scripture in at least I felt - he says you know if any man suffers Christian let him not be ashamed but him glory to God on this behalf he says for the time has come the judgment must begin at the house of God absolutely where did God start he says when they brought this he says he started what in the house of God in that city absolutely he said ISA Honea he says in at first begin at us and if it first began at us why shall the end of them that obey not the gospel of God and if the righteous scared Li scarcely be saved he says where shall the ungodly in the sinner appear right we're at a very difficult all our here a serious sobering out we're 400 years from when it should have been destroyed according the message the hour but we want to get to the go deeper and examine things okay want to examine this the very best I could by the grace of God I'm not captain examination I'm not I've been trained by the CIA CIA or the FBI but I just we just do little Bible studies okay but we want to go into the Word of God and see what it says we want to see what the message of the hour holds everything we wanted to know them every kind of nugget we can poll by the grace of God did I find them all no but we were doing our best in Ecclesiastes ten ten twenties as cursed out the King no not in your thought and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber he says why he says he says be careful what you say be careful what you think he says for a little birdie he says a little bird he says in the air will carry that voice and that wish that hath wings shall tell the matter right in other words all the Bible says what our sins will find us out absolutely and Luke 12 verse 1 in the meantime when they were gathered together in an innumerable multitude people and so mentions the throne at one upon another he began to say the disciples first of all beware ye the leaven of the Pharisees which is which is hypocrisy for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed neither hear that shall not be known the entire plan of Satan was not only prophesied of in the Book of Revelations but then here in this day the entire book of Revelation is broke out and what the Holy Ghost he said it being opened up every single thing that we need to know absolutely in the barn Jesus even said he said the very elect shall not be deceived absolutely why because what we eat we know first of all we know we have to have the Holy Ghost and we have him he you can sit here in the center a preacher and this and this but what is the Holy Ghost II many Amen absolutely sure way my words absolutely I want to be in the right to if they if you hear something wrong with me absolutely brother Jesse corrected me the last time and I corrected it a big last service that was here 20 how now verse 3 therefore what so we have spoken and darkness shall be heard in the light and that's what she has spoken the ear and closet shall be proclaimed upon the housetops saints absolutely and also now any Elijah's ministry the king of syria was going to do a war and he was won in a fight and he said we're going to sneak up on israel and do all these things oh my good god has sent a prophet in Israel I told him exactly what they was plated and they were befuddled how do these guys know then in the second King six and twelve but what a serpent said on him not even my Lord my king but Elisha the Prophet that is in the land tell it the king of Israel the words of our speakers in that bedchamber praise be to God I'll tell you what we need the gift of prophecy in the church once again as far as minor prophets brought give people who have the gift or the gift of prophecy honor absolute interpretation absolutely and God can you also use your pastor to speak forth absolutely Amen God will always warn his children but now Ezekiel 9 1 he said it's time to mark why cuz destruction is coming now why is destruction coming there must be sin in the camp there must be things that's going to be done wrong absolutely there must be the things of God that he said in the into the hands of men must be out of cater and God is going to bring a judgment now and he's he he oh 9 he's lining up his six boys and he says go in there in slay off but he says the one that's kind of heart like me that doesn't what that is actually concerned a for soul just has a little soaps for male he says mark them there has another cup action for someone who did not heard the things we've heard that compassion about Jesus Christ and his saving power and I would change your life atoning blood that spirit that lives within us absolutely - now let's back let's go back here by the grace of God now why was judgment coming because of the chapter before Ezekiel 9 is judgment time Markham's sealed with the Holy Ghost and the reason is is because if you go back to the chapter before something is take place something is revealed Ezekiel 8 3 now God dealing with his prophet he says and he put forth the form of a hand and took me by a lack of my head and the spirit lifted me up between Earth and heaven and brought me into visions of God oh my goodness in that word Jesus Christ was that he was in between Earth in the heaven and brought me into the visions of God to Egypt no he did not go to a heathen country to not go in today to those worship worshiping astronauts or anything like that of that nature he goes what's right in my own house right to my own City he says and brought me into the visions of God to Jerusalem to the door of the inner gate that looketh toward the north saints of God what is the north the north is the Eagles age it's our age absolutely remember the four beasts the lion the ox the man in the eagle the eagle is on the north side on Dan side as we taught on Wednesday night right this is the north side this is our age absolutely because remember this types our age as well he says in the door the innermost gate that look toward the north where is the seat of the image of jealousy this is outside of the church is an image placed here outside of the church when someone comes to church they wants you to see this first don't worry about what's going on inside yet guys let's let's just set this out here we're gonna set this image here and just just stare at that for a while okay that's the most important thing yes where was the seed of the image of jealousy which provoked a--the to jealousy who was perused who was jealous Jesus Christ God Almighty but in his own church they had an idol set up before all to see yes and behold the glory of God of Israel was there according to the vision that I saw in the plain now I wonder what this I looked in I searched I there was nothing but let me let me bring a little something a little thought from the Word of God in numbers in 20 and verse 7 and the Lord said unto Moses saying take the round gathered all the assembly together he's a down Aaron thy brother and speaking to the rack before their eyes knows what did speak to it right he said they shall give forth his water and thou shalt bring them to the water of the rock so thou shalt give the congregation and of the Beast to drink he says and the Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he was commanded right now look at verse 10 and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock and he sends them here now he rebels must we fetch you water out of this rock didn't Moses have anything to do with this this move was a sole individual move by the Holy Ghost himself by God himself and now Moses is what he says he says now I've got to do this for you guys don't I I guess I'm gonna have to go out here and dig into the Word of God and feed you this world I guess no it must be the leadership of the whole you kinda can't take credit for one thing I've done because it's that oxygen that he made that I have to breathe to live absolutely I can't I can't take your trailer could afford anything but what he's presented before me I want to accept it Lord give me the air to accept it in number 10 verse 10 he says must we fetch you water out of this rock and Moses left of his hand and when his rod with his rod he smote the rock twice and the water came up bundling though in the congregation drank and the beasts drank also and the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because ye believe me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of the Lord he did not put credit where credit was due he did not say God is going to give you water and he disobeyed the Word of God what he disobeyed the would have got in front of all of Israel he did not honor God he was not obey obedient to the commandments of God right and why is it so important I'm just hitting us now look look at this this is powerful to me in Exodus 16 15 and when the children reso saw it they said one to another it is a manna now remember that was almost 4,000 years ago Moses smote the rock spoke to this and spoke to that one God did all kinds of thing but now when God comes down again look at the condition of the people and when the mother and the children saw they said unto one another in his manner for lie they wished not what it was now look up Moses his own confession Moses said unto them this is the bread which to which I have given you to eat no he says this is the bread which God give you so notice Moses the majority was ministries is always pointing to God he said Jesus Christ this fella did this the Javad did this joven did that Peter doughnuts montez's testimony but after three thousand two thousand years later however the sisters timetable was set up look when we get into this the first coming of Jesus Christ in John 6 verse 28 and they said to him what shall we do that we might work the works of God sincere honest he says and jesus answered them this is the work of God that you believe on me whom he has sent and they said it therefore unto Him what sign show us now that we may see and believe me what does our work and look what the cooking of the confessions of the people our fathers did eat manna in the desert look they're quoting the scripture as is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat what's wrong with that scripture absolutely nothing but look at Christ's discernment this is God and God Almighty only he could know what that's the Messiah gift you can know the thoughts and intents of the heart when they said he when they said he what did they mean when they said he oh and I oh he gave them and you are thinking of God to the clean hearted pure and thought but Christ's God and flesh with that gift on him is now discerning the very thoughts and intents of these people and does he let it slide who did they lift up did they have an image they lift it up a little too high God in flesh said what and Jesus said to him verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven he straight it up right there boys you lifted up the prophet a little too high you know brother Branham did this in brother Branham did he who gave him that gift divisions who given that variability to discern the Word of God and catch the mind of God God gave hey let me tell you something when Jesus Christ went down hell he took captivity captive and rolled him up and he said he was ine when the Bible say he gave gifts unto men why was that gift that he had that was from gharlane praise be to God yeah he gave gifts unto men well brother he's I'm from this brother here's a tremendous preacher he can just preach the lights out listen who gave him that gift if we lifted people up too high is there an image of jealousy outside the message of the hour if you could take it or look at it in a whole same setting sighing and crying for the abominations done in sitting Moses gave you not that bread from heaven he says but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven not only did said hold on boys easily let me tell you I'm gonna correct this and make it plain and God didn't speak he let the flesh speak he's a boy back me up so I got it my father did this oh my I wonder if God wants you to speak sometime does he have to speak every time through you or is he waiting for you to back up his word someone uses the date someone uses the name of our Lord in vain and no one says anything about it at work on the job in the grocery store women cuts just as bad as men now swear absolutely Kersten call cursing anyhow let's continue on by the grace of God so there was an image of jealousy and what if that was the profit or a profit or something like that nature you think you ate five we're gonna go down now he's coming he brings this profit now to the house of God when outside the house of God was that image right and verse 5 then he said unto me son of man lift up thine eyes now the way towards the north oma he said I lived in my eyes way towards the northern being and behold northward at the gate was the altar this image of jealousy in the entry right and he sees the image God says identify this he says I see it he says then he saith unto me there furthermore unto me son of man cease without what they do to doubt what they do even the great abominations at the house of Israel committeth here that I should go far off from my sanctuary look he's outside of Laodicea it was so filthy there he was on the outside trying to get word of God is perfect it was type after type after type line upon line here a little there little precept upon precept he says that I should go off from my sanctuary he couldn't even live in his own house and saints of God are we keeping our own houses clean a week is the presence of God dwelling can you feel him when you go to work when you wake up when you pray do you feel him is he there in your house his house he purchased it but turned me again and thou shalt see greater greater than this greater than an image outside the house of God he's gonna take you inside it's gonna take you inside say God's gentleman and when he's not a judge when his judgement time he senses he says it's forcing let me show you something I'm gonna break this down right now I'm gonna show y'all this evil my easy q85 notice he's focusing on the north he's poking is focusing on the north now looking questions answered 59 now as I just got to be basing up this that Lucifer in heaven tried to exalt himself and even be just a little higher than his boss through Jesus Christ he's any betrayed Michael and made himself a greater Kingdom in the North saying member it's the same spirit Saints we battle the same exact spirits the same spirit that was on Herod is still here today the same spirit that was on Pilate is still here today this exact same spirit that was on Judas is here today all those spirits of disease and saints of God let's just let's just do the addition there's a hundred what 200 million extra demons released a pull of the bride in this thing oh my stuff we've never even seen before you see the insanity you go back 50 years and let bring someone in from that time to here they beg what is going on with these people always don't know if they're boys and girls are not they're girls oh my goodness confusion in the midst major confusion well I was born this way but whatever the reasoning has gone off the charts into insanity unfeeling realities of living out his rubber sin didn't begin on earth didn't begin in to heaven when loose were taken at main him he says I want a denomination make a great big thing went on to the north country and set up a bigger thing that Michael had and was kicked out of heaven now God is about ready to run these people in the ground setting up that image in the North everything runs everything runs true everything runs true absolutely now let's continue on look at what was the heart of satan isaiah 14 we've all been through these things i know some of this might be reviewed verse 12 for thou art fallen from the heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how thou are cut down to the ground he cut what that tree of now is evil down just like just like a Christmas tree he says thou did weaken it's the nation's for thou hast said in thine heart what I was sent into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the sides of the east north or west he goes he goes all the way cesare back to the north his main goal is not to be the top dog he wanted to be the best he wanted to be God but the you know the positions now available he says I will be most like the Most High God right now we know the Old Testament Tabernacle was set up in the wilderness with badger skins and those kinds of things absolutely but now as in the time of Ezekiel they had Solomon's Temple and I've been rebuilt or however he says and this is kinda I'm sorry for the it's not real sharp here this is just kind of overview but this is why there was a Northside this is Ezekiel's temple there was an extra near entrance to the east and from the south and then this is obviously the the inner court and the holy place and the holiest of Holies right there so he could actually go from the north thank God in our age we can go to the north from the north and we can enter in them but we have to enter we shouldn't go obviously through the east gate and hit these baptism the altar and further into God right so that's exactly how it was set up that's why so the north that's why they give it a little bit better picture here by the grace of God this is how I was actually set up in as far as beauty you have all these entrances here and there's the north side and that image was set on the north side right here's another image of the hope hope you guys can grasp this go online check it out east east north and south all those right there and that image was set right above there right now is Ezekiel's temple to plan the plant the floor plan for Ezekiel's temple but now was it so bad that there was an image sent in Idol set in front of this north gate was that bad enough and God brought the Prophet to the house of God and he brought me to the door of the court and when I looked behold a hole in the wall they had completely sealed the worshipers out there not leading them to the Holy Ghost they're not getting into salvation they had not healed the sick the lame the halt spiritually naturally they have not got him there so he's looking well jump let's skip that one and then he said unto me son of man dig now in the wall and when I had digged in the wall behold a door they had masonry in front of the wall this thing is not no one is getting in here remember they all the prophets right here just just listen to the Prophet I mean I mean we believe the message right and there's a couple stories that always keep with me one was brother Jesse here brother Jesse went we got an invitation he went down to preach in North Carolina and he preached the service and down there they said they said brother that was the best service we had in 30 years sighing and crying for repentance for what couple hours brother 30 minutes solid they said was the best service day in 30 years and a man went up to brother Jesse he said brother Jesse and I asked for Jesse phone I could share this lesson I talked to my if you wanted to okay the man will have to brother Jesse said brother you have the voice he says you have the delivery and you have the word he says but you're not getting in they'll never let you in why'd they say that Tim [Music] now we're dealing with the door the church is closed Ezekiel eight nine and I would not have taught this because I needed I just needed one thing to click I just needed to understand one thing and then the rest would flow so I searched and looked and by the grace of God is it's in the message of the hour zq 8 9 and he said unto me darling and behold I he says you found the door you don't through this masonry you're not there these bricks down your construction tradesman he said now you know he's they open that door or walk in and tell me what you see first thing you see and he said to me go in and behold the wicked abominations that they do here go in and see okay look at the outward signs man there's something wrong in here Bo as we enter in now to the sanctuary to God's house what is wrong and so I went in and saw and behold every form of creeping thing and a bomb little beasts and all the idols of the house of Israel portrayed around upon the wall roundabout interesting this this is what he saw you know what he saw was the exact same thing that God created in Genesis 1 and God said on what the sixth day let the key let the earth bring forth living creature after his kind animal creeping thing and the beasts of the earth after his kind that was so and God made the beasts the earth after his kind in the kalam and everything that creepeth upon the earth after his kind he's bringing things these are natural things now I watched some videos on animals and on insects you know what their entire purposes to stay alive and they must consume one another to stay alive they set traps they hunt it it is and it is the animal nature they want to conquer because they have to fill their own bellies it's all them if two if a lion and tiger standing next to each other and let's say they're friends and an antelope runs there do you think that lines like you know tiger that's that's that's you know III yesterday you can have that one go get it it's every man for themselves yes that's the nature of this day the things that come out of this day I'm not talking up there when God creates his children I'm talking about earthly things carnal things fleshly things right now it also jumps now back to the New Testament revelation and so Rome is one for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousness and ungodly and righteous of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness he says because that there may be known of God is manifest in them for God has issued it unto them right he said now think about think about what guy what what what Paul is revealing here he's revealing something here for the invisible things of him from the creation the role are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and it's God who knows God is showing them his Godhead there's one God what through nature and that is what the SU and that proves there's one God we taught that here before correct he says not only is he one God he says but he has he all his power look at creation and tell me you're an atheist really let's just talk about that let's reason amongst ourselves okay I met a quite a few because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God just like Moses did they're just like those people and he gave them bread teeth they glorified a man instead he says neither we're thankful but became vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools Jesus and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man so there's an image of laughter both men anyone going back to Revelation 13 ecumenical World Council of Churches an image to her man does everything so not always a just man it's men it is a system he says corruptible men to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things well brother this is all fine and dandy what the prophets say we're gonna get to that by the grace of God he says now with the nicolin-san doctrine and that brother jess sister Lydia Malachi someone some brains he says mo mo dog nation amalgamation thank you praise be to God that's why you have little big brothers absolutely he says algum ation with the Michael Arrington doctrine and the alga nation of Christianity which had to look that up Automation is the Uniting he said the uniting of Christianity was Babylonian ISM he says the net results had to be wet Ezekiel saw in chapter 8 10 once we found this quote now now I know now it starts to open up what is the problem before judgment hits the first thing we're not talking about the route we're talking about the first thing and he also goes what the revelations 18 he says and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the Great is fallen is fallen to become the habitation of devils and a hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful thing hateful bird I'm sorry he says for every nation have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication absolutely he says and this was in the house of God and they didn't want anyone to find out what was in there so they sealed it all up and said hey you know we have an image just look at this guy for a little bit just keep your focus right there don't worry about what's going on in the inside behind the scenes right everybody okay so we saw these things we know it's Nicoletta nism right now look look what look what he ate look now look what he sees after that and they stood before them seventy men of the Ancients of the house of Israel and in the midst thereof stood jazz a jazz nya the son of chiffon or chiffon chiffon or hutch whatever with every man his censer in his hand and thick clouds of incense went up look they were praying they're worshipping God but what does he see he sees a group of men and then he said in him then he then said he unto me son of man hast thou seen what the angels of the house of Israel do in the dark notice its darkness what we're in Laodicea I wonder if this was a flash of light I was it takes to to see something in the dark as a flash of light and if the Holy Ghost is leading Ezekiel through this I'm guessing there's light there he says every man in the chambers of his imaginary and they said for they said the Lord has seen if not the Lord has forsaken the earth right and noticed one of them was given a name was actually named out he made a name among himself hmm interesting we'll skip this now let's continue on everybody remember that quote the sickest body that I know of here today is the bond the so-called body of Jesus Christ the sickest body people use preachers use this continually continuing to tuning right let's go to the root well starting way back there in the first church the people got to thinking and reasoning how to improve on God how to make services better how to make things better for his children and the deeds of the Nicolaitans began showing themselves then a group formed like 70 men there they drifted away from the pattern of the world outward all's it takes is just one word change in that little leaven leavens the whole lump he that let go further than one point of the law is guilty of all Eve just changed one word that'll do it he says and when this what Satan centered group was formed it began to hate and to fight the true believers insisting that the aliens were the Church of God why does God hate groups forming cliques and all these things amongst Ministers amongst people in the churches he says it destroys he's as a bridge hatred if sister hos brother Jose brother Jose and and my wife formed this group and they're like brother Simon you don't need to you don't need to talk with us well that may hurts my feelings that probably my feelings a little bit I say well how come they're buddies I'm not and then he says it destroys he says it way it creates bitterness the root of bitterness that files many so we're looking at these rings right the sickest body the sickest body and if they're still saying the Church of God is still sick the sickness is still there there is no strength in it now let's go here Church age book when the church allows herself to move away from the original like Adam and Eve death set in there is no stress no strength in her she has become a monstrosity the minute the church moved toward form and ceremony tours Watts a priesthood by organizing the ministers into a group and that decided leadership apart from the Holy Spirit and his word that very moment death entered in and she started to get sick I wasn't a farmer I wasn't raised a farmer but I know if you want poisoning IV out of your garden you have to pull it by the roots one time I was over my brother's house and he's got these little trees and pawpaw trees I said I like to have some of them my guard what I do I said I'm not an experienced green thumb man I'm a plumber I want that treat I've ripped her right out of the ground the roots shown as a dart through the back of my truck embarrassing pray for me by the time I got home though with the leaves raw when virgin to die why because I pulled it by the roots I should take it by the roots but left on dirt and mud I'm ever learning but I'm coming to the glory of God we're coming back one to the power God what our hearts will be turning back to the hearts of one of our hollers absolutely we will produce another book X absolutely praise be to God we're learning we're learning but now we need to implement we need to understand what we've been taught and action there's a certain man come to a certain church he said we have this problem this problem I had this problem this business there's a little messed up and he knows every quote he's got every quote he's like well this this is it but he does not know how to apply it he's got so many problems it'll make your head spin you are completely helpless you're going I can't fix this but he knows every quote when are we going to apply the Word of God and not just apply it but wait and have faith in it why because he's the restorer amen we no man can do these things it takes God for everything Jesus even said he says he said you can do nothing without me amen praise be to God that's the truth any man yes now this is a powerful quote power house quote every time I read it I'm just singing he says now Christ is the head of this Christ is the head of his Masonic Kingdom he's the king he's the king there is no other daughter Gabrus I mean there's no Savior beside me he said there's none other but me and you cannot organize the kingdom of God which Christ is the head you try to put wheat sure if a minister tries to put his hands into influencing this pastor or this brother or if I'm over off of land he tries to influence a pastor this way or this way you better be careful he says you cannot dominate a kingdom which rice is the head or Solari denominate he says because Christ is king and you cannot take the intellectuals of a man and make an organization to which God will govern in other words a man wants to make the church well ok sister brother you can sing okay now we're gonna be my song later and I want you to back up because you guys this now let me see okay now you have really good teaching ability you're gonna be better to let the gifts manifest themselves amen gifts and callings without Prince even but every gift will find their place as a pastor's brother but Jesse would it be a pastor you sits back as individuals come in he has to watch them kissed away their actions we have to see what they do did they automatically start witnessing and started teaching Bible studies are they said man brother Jesse yeah I can sing a little bit and uh if you want me to you know do a song I could and Jesse has to wash these things and wait for the timing everything must hit just because what the rest of the body is in need of these things we are dependent on the leadership of the Holy Ghost amen and there's there's the man right there brother Jesse he must be on these things and the he and he is he says he says you cannot take the nuptials a man and make an organization which Christ will govern therefore any companies any people's any groups of a man that tries to organize the kingdom of God is going contrary to the king he says he says in if they're going contrary to the king it would be against the king oh my this is a full house quote write this one down studies put it over a computer put it on your wall amen he says salvors god it's over it's against the king it would be Antichrist that's pretty rough he's of off I just had a little more voice somebody had it he says we made that clear it is a Antichrist and if you'll hear me a few minutes I'll prove that an antichrist spirit tries to take a people call them from organization organization organizing together which will which never was the will of God every local assembly is sovereign of itself God in God's mind he has a specific duty and purpose for brother Jesse's ministry and for this local assembly and what is it to be lights can you save a soul can you anyone no but the Bible says you can win them he that winneth Souls is wise amen reproduce yourselves she do amen amen allegory says it's that dominating spirit that makes the people think that we are the bride we're the message of the hour there's no prettier what's that saying that they send a bride pride no humility the greatest honor to sit with Christ on his throne we must walk and try softly man number one of the needs and acquaintance was organizing in two groups number two but within I I have chickens all my free-range chickens and the third age third age revealed by the spirit of prophecy that the worldly church would adopt he says Nicolaitans as a doctrine this the separation of a clergy from the laity grew from the from the biblical truth the ours shepherds of local flax ruling the flock by the word to the deeds of the Nicolaitans wherein the clergy set themselves and ranks one over the other so once these groups are formed all these ministers or whoever even the laity well okay I really like you I'm gonna fellowship more with him than for the Robert because I like him more you know in a pastor well he's a better preacher but John Graham's a better preacher than my brother Malachi so I'm gonna invite you more and I'm just going to hold you in the back brother you stay right there in the computer these are rankings and what were to treat each one equal and the pastor must now be in prayer who do I invite the preach not have anyone in mind nah Lord you you put you place that brother's heart rate that boats name on my heart and leave me who-who Lord who's Lord I'm tired here I need someone to come and fill a place who do you want me who do you want to speak who do you want to feed my sheep leadership but they rank one another I was a wee I forgot to spend a couple a day here with sister Connie and got to watch and view her life a man who he was able to share these things and we're talking and how we could go to big meetings and if you nee if you if you could look at the names there and you could discern who's gonna get what day and who's gonna preach to services out of the five and I mean we're not disturb when you have enough December for that and there's an there's an issue he's decide themselves and ranks over one the other which unscriptural forma formula then evolved into a priesthood that place the clergy between man and God trying well brother all as everyone is everyone in service eat no no no I'm not saying that at all it's a spirit sad to say the true vine was not exactly immune to this doctrine oh so true ordained sons of God who are ministers where the Holy Ghost can be influenced by this absolutely the Prophet said that Polycarp was one of them he was a nickel 18 that's why I rhiness was chosen to be the man he says by that I do not mean that the true vine did ever establish and then declares an idea has a doctrine they never established it as a doctrine far from it but that little one of death kept sucking at the True Vine hoping that it might fall even within the true church man of God who are called as overseers or pastors we're holding that title to mean a little more than just a local responsibility groups rankings and why are pastors out of their pulpit more than they are in it why are they traveling everywhere listen is trying to do the work of the evangelists trying to do the work of the missionary though the apostle the prophet I'm not talking about a pastor going once or twice a year somewhere I'm talking when they are exerting themselves in putting their influence everywhere well I care about the bride and stay at home I've got a lot of quotes on this a lot of Scripture it was not clear it was not the clear understanding of Paul and exists in the church at that time for Paul said and they glorified God in their forgotten me no matter what authority Paul had he kept the people looking to God from who is all authority but the clergy was always looking to divine leadership plus human and thus giving honor where honor was not due and he gave us manna from heaven Jesus said that was my father with nickel a dozen establish apostolic succession placed ministers vote pastors voted in I just heard of another issue that had come up and it won exactly textbook Bible just like this from his own words now let's continue on let's just read a scripture Zechariah 11 verse 15 and the Lord said to be taken to thee yet the instruments of a foolish Shepherd for lo I will raise up a Shepherd of the land which shall not visit those that be call off look there's no there's no soul travail these were not marked by what the in-court rider he said they did not care about even their own flock what is true religion to want to visit the widows and what to be a father to the fatherless a man a man brings me to God do something through someone who really neither the needs to help a man not a mercy just basic simple things like that give him a call do something absolutely we shall not visit those that we call off neither shall seek the young nor heal that which is broken or feed and I would stand as still as they shall eat the flesh of laughing their tailor their claws with pieces full of shepherd go to the Shepherd that leaveth the flock the sword shall be by his arm upon his arm I'm sorry and upon his right eye his eye for his arm shall be cleaned right up and his right eye shall be utterly darkened pastures traveling too much maybe I love this now in this now where we will break down this is Bible this is the word of God we're dealing with spirits we're deal with the Holy Ghost we're dealing with the Antichrist spirit right so everything that we're seeing in the natural it should be what textbook Bible this took place at our church right here now in this I declared you I praise you that you come that together for the better he says but for the worse for first of all when he come together in the church I hear that they be divisions among you what a group swarm divisions one of those Nicholas isn't it cause divisions among you and I partly believe it but notice what comes next heresies if you see something like this then something false we just heard a man preaching he said Jesus had two to adoptions he was adopted when he was baptized by John the Baptist and he was doctored on Mount Transfiguration that's not true adoption took place on a mild Transfiguration but why are they saying these where were these thoughts coming from but just if there's anything I say raw you correct me absolutely bring me in the word show me in the word if I'm wrong absolutely I'll make it right for there must also be heresies among you that they which are approved may be manifest um the God allows these things to show who the true ministers are absolutely and one who can stick with the lawyer absolutely stick with what the baptism of the Holy Ghost the leadership of him a man yes sure brother Jesse he's out ministering overseas there he went on that trip in other words what we're dealing with his text book Bible everything you see everything you've seen the scripture will happen exactly as it is written he was praying for a demon-possessed woman and he said that woman started biting his hand and brother Jesse did he move his hand like this said well this lady is too far it's too much he said he kept his hand on the lady's head right there started praying rebuking a demon in the name of Jesus Christ while biting his hand and boom she ran out a roll or she fell as she was dead and Jesse said textbook Bible exactly you hold to the Word of God if you see this watcher keep your eyes on it because they don't manifest if it's that way good or bad now look what he says now moving in now we saw the first thing they saw these these creeping things we saw this as a group of 70 ministers right amen he says now look what he says here is a program a program is church age he says now you just can't have it Nicol Anton setup in the church and not have this other doctrine come in to because if the Antichrist spirit is there what's it going to do it's going to move further and further and grow stronger and bigger and creep in into the crevices it's going to manifest more and what's he talking about the doctrine of Balaam all right now I'm bringing this forth as a teacher that is your pastor you that is that is who have to if there's anything I say you take it to the to the pastor and if I'm wrong he will correct it by the grace of God now Ezekiel 8 13 and he said to me yet yet be again turn thee yet again and see how greater abominations of this worse than worse than groups worse than NIC elations then he brought me to the door of the gate of the Lord's house which was towards the north and behold there sat women weeping for Tammuz so here we are now there's women weeping for Tomas right the Saturnalia which means son stop is the long week program of sorry pagan festival has a program of the west of the winter solstice which began in December 17th as was seen to be rising further to the south and the thought of visit dying and by December 25th the ancient world solstice he says it could be recognized at the beginning that turned northwards again it was said to be the reborn and therefore is proclaimed as the birthday of the Sun god deity all the known Sun deities were born on December 25th Krishna Osiris so Horus Hercules Dionysus or whatever Bacchus Tomasz even they claimed Christ behind all pagan deity worship stands Satan himself he accepts honor in whatever name he wished we wish to call him bail Moloch Venus Odin you name it Dagon I'm wrong whatever male or female he says it matters not he wants worship and he wants glory he says the most important day in the life of any saint worshipper is their annual birthday for roughly four thousand years the soleus has been been by proxy the day of satan's birthday celebration because he has desired the original s-tronic religious pattern and deceived all mankind to worst to them to worship the Sun right now let's continue on here by the grace of God so Balaam here began to commit God Israel to commit fornication and he goes in to bail poor and all these things you know how Balaam was paid and this and that and the and the prophesied he said he could not get Israel to sin so he had to he had to pull a trick on him and he invited them into this worship right into this festival into this holiday and he now the Prophet is dealing with Balaam and Israel committing fornication he says do you know that physical fornication is the same spirit that lies with the organization organized religion I said the spirit of or occasion in the spirit of organization and all fornicators will have a place and like a fire that is what God thinks of organization yes sir the horner daughters will be in the lake of fire correct absolutely now let's jump down now as these work with bayon look when he jumps down - he's dealing with the same mode and now in this part here he says notice now notice that constant Constantine gave special feasts and the people they were all pagan feasts with new names taken from the church as it was some Christian rights were taken and abused with pagan ceremonies he took this worship of the Sun God and changed it to what the Esso and God instead of celebrating December 24 bring on December 21st which is when they used to celebrate the Feast of the Sun God but they put it now - December 21st 25th and called it the Sun God's birthday he says but will you know he was born in April he says he was born in April when life comes forth not in December and they took the Feast of Astaroth or s tyre or whatever and called it the Easter celebration when Chris Christian is supposed to celebrate the death and resurrection the Lord actually was a pagan feasts - this guy returned bless you now this we just hid that there by the grace of God let's see here he says then still crisp and and still worship Christmas he says and it's Santa Claus and all these oh mercy still pagan feasts added to it that's they that's just all there you are invited you invited Balaam when you invite Christmas in your house they have you have the doctrine of Balaam among you there it is Oh God just reveal it father see the birthday from April until so-and-so he says now I want to follow he says I want to follow the Morningstar Christ I want to follow any and find any find my Jesus to stay I want to get away from all this year Christmas tinsel on things because some day is going to burn with unquenchable fire and all those who are in tolerating with it will be burnt with it very dangerous things there's more quotes but we'll continue on so in other words these women in this inner court were celebrating what pagan feast days or pagan days and when I first come into messages in 2002 2001 there at the end my pastor Brooks was militant against Christmas and that's how I've held my standard by the grace of God now but that's let your pastor lead and guide you on that now let's continue on Ezekiel 8 verse 15 going now further into this house of God what else is wrong then said he unto me hast thou seen this O son of man turned the yet again and see thou greater abominations in this you mean he gets worse I mean something greater can beyond this thing he said so and he brought me to the inner Court of the old house and behold at the door of the temple the Lord behold between the porch and the altar were 25 men what another group a more devious group a more sinister group oh my goodness my more deceptive a group with their backs towards the temple of the Lord and their faces towards the east and they worship the Sun towards the east my goodness who is a master this question at this time who was running the house of God Sun worshipers I'm gonna I'm gonna tell a story here a certain pastor I know was he was he's a he's a minister he's a pastor and a man that come into his assembly brand-new Christian got saved baptized and named Jesus Christ Doug coming in he started you know budding up and made friends with the pastors today brother and hey can we hang out sometime oh that's really brought you spent a lot of time with this pastor driving around with him you know and this and that and the pastor told me I heard that the pastor said he says one day they're in a car together riding and the man kept trying to tell him to do a certain thing said brother so-and-so you need to do this because I think the people will be blessed I really think you need to start doing this maybe change this this this and the brothers kept saying no brother I'm I'm doing it I'm doing it this way because of a reason this is the way I run the show here the Lord has put this on my heart I'm running this way and he kept he said he's like kept on going it this and this and this and this he said you need to change this he said all of a sudden Holy Ghost said this is a Jesuit and he turned to him and said you're a Jesuit priest aren't you the man said turn over turn and pull over the car and let me out the pastor turn over the car turn the car over to the road let him out he got out and he never saw the man again in the message of the hour brother Mike's mcklusky his wife his wife sister Netanya got married there and when she was younger they sat under a certain minister and the minister her pastor told her the story that a group of men had come and met with him a group of men had come and met and said we want to make you one of the biggest names in the in this the message we're gonna give you all the big meetings we're gonna do this this this we're gonna make you a big name he says but we just want you to hold a little bit off on preaching on this and and preaching on that and what do you think we have a deal and I pastor said get out of my church Versailles your conspiracy theorist now the Bible said so the Bible says what the Catholic Church has infiltrated the message the our 50 years preaching this word of God where is a book of Acts church where is a church that that has all nine spiritual gifts operating something's still not right have our hearts been fully turned back to there it's coming it is coming he says what he says I will restore saith the Lord you can't stop God no one can stop the Holy Ghost and God just allows these things that happen why because what there's a there's a quote he said you can't beat your type you can't beat who you are if there's superseded amongst is because there was service eating eating in the true Church of God were Adam and Eve and the Holy Ghost we're just rang and a service snuck in you can't beat that type they have to be here and they can't stop you you will overcome you are overcomers God is worthy yeah I'll get it straightened out he was saying that what do you what do you think he has a descent for with a shout voice and Trump as a lion and if you look at lions when they roar is to show their property to let the other ones know he's here and he might be a little jealous because it was revealed in action as he says he's a lot of new name ease that name is what jealousy he says it's just what he's a jealous God absolutely even st. Paul he called the minor parties as I'm jealous for you with a godly jealousy yes praise be to God amen hallelujah yes Sun worshipers in the temple controlling everything who worship that Sun Catholics the highest form of spirituality there is as the Prophet said worshipping that Sun God enough amen let's tan Saints and to make the spiritual application with it you know what the bishop said the bishop said we have a right to do this because he is the son the SU n of righteousness look they're pulling from a scripture malachi wat for one and two uh well they got a loophole like they did on Father Son Holy Ghost in Matthew 20 19 sure they got a loophole they have some kind of spiritual application you see but the Bible said in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word be established but you see those little things has come so they can pick into that and be like that God knowed it before the foundation of the world where they got it the scriptural application God put these little things in here to stumble yes so the false can come in and say look I'm gonna pull the scripture here look it's okay I found this scripture on it one scripture maybe even two but Saints running we run things from Genesis to revelations because that's what sons of God do we think what he said what eat the whole book yes but you know those little things has come to where they can pick it up and to be that God knowed it before the foundation the world where they got described became because he is the S Oh n of God we'll just take that little pagan sons s UN's birthday and make it
