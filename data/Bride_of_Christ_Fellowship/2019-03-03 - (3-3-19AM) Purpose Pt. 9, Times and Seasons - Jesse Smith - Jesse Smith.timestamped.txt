[34:06] the glory at the conclusion of this
[34:07] service in Jesus Christ's name the
[34:10] church said Amen god bless you just
[34:12] being seated praise God so I do have a
[34:17] some slides there by God's grace to
[34:19] misquotes I'd like to share I don't have
[34:22] this thought done what I'd like to do is
[34:26] I'd like to go through all 14 pairs and
[34:29] show Bible examples but I just have a
[34:31] few to show this morning because I
[34:34] spending other time as you'll see how
[34:35] spending majority of time on other
[34:37] scriptures so would like to look at this
[34:40] thought I haven't had many subtitles for
[34:43] the this series but this is part nine
[34:44] times and seasons that just one look at
[34:46] times and seasons I'm a feeling letter
[34:48] Lord to look at these thoughts I want to
[34:50] start it today and then hopefully or
[34:52] willing be able to preach it on
[34:53] Wednesday as well by God's grace also if
[34:58] I remember at the conclusion of this
[34:59] service I'd like to just give everybody
[35:00] an update on you know some of the saints
[35:03] that aren't here anymore like brother
[35:04] Jason and Benjamin Austin and Tanya and
[35:07] Connie so I'd like to give her an update
[35:09] and you know of course well we'll turn
[35:10] off the livestream and so for like that
[35:12] just want to give an update on things by
[35:15] the grace of the Lord and I appreciate
[35:17] your prayers I appreciate everybody's
[35:18] concern for the Saints amen and we're
[35:21] just thankful for God's mercy and let's
[35:24] just keep praying for each and every
[35:25] person praise God let's never give up
[35:27] let's never give up praying Jesus said
[35:30] he's looking for a woman that will knock
[35:31] at the end time and still have faith to
[35:33] believe so we must not faint
[35:35] we must keep praying by the grace of the
[35:38] Lord so let's look at this thought here
[35:40] we did our text this morning I want to
[35:43] start off with this thought from
[35:44] Wednesday as preached on Revelation 12
[35:46] the Bible defines is the seams
[35:49] to find time as a year and times as more
[35:54] than one year but in this scripture it
[35:56] means two years because half a time was
[36:00] six months so this was the amount of
[36:02] time that the woman Israel brother Ram
[36:04] said revelation 12 deals only with
[36:07] Israel not the bride so she would be fed
[36:10] in the wilderness after Christ ascended
[36:12] to heaven God would cut off the Jew the
[36:15] Jew would be taken off in the wilderness
[36:16] where she'd be fed for three and a half
[36:18] years and then the Bible says you know
[36:22] 1260 days she'll be fed and then the
[36:24] Bible says she's nourished for a time
[36:27] times and half a time so just giving us
[36:33] a few definitions now I haven't studied
[36:36] the word time all the way through the
[36:37] Bible I imagine that's a pretty big
[36:39] study so it'd take me like a day or two
[36:40] to get through that but it's apparent
[36:44] though in this scripture that time
[36:46] represents a year and then times
[36:49] represents two years and a half a time
[36:52] represent six months now as I'm just
[36:55] thinking about this the Holy Spirit you
[36:57] know ministering in my thoughts here I'm
[36:59] turning to Genesis 18 because the
[37:03] scripture just kind of came to my mind
[37:05] and I like to just reference that
[37:08] Genesis 18 where God was visiting
[37:12] Abraham and Sarah in the tent yeah
[37:15] Genesis 18 14 so I don't have this on
[37:17] the slide of just kind of coming to me
[37:19] here is there anything too hard for the
[37:22] Lord at the time appointed I'll return
[37:25] unto thee according to the time of life
[37:28] and Sarah shall have a son when did God
[37:32] visit her the next year in the 25th year
[37:36] because Abraham was a hundred years old
[37:38] when Isaac was born so there was the
[37:41] time of life praise the Lord so the next
[37:44] year in other words I'll visit you the
[37:45] next year according to time of life and
[37:48] if you know Genesis 21 the Bible said
[37:51] verse 1 the Lord visited Sara as he had
[37:53] said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he
[37:56] had spoken oh God always does that he
[37:59] always does as he says and he always
[38:00] does what he spoken amen
[38:02] the thing to do is be able to hear what
[38:04] he's saying but the sphere of the church
[38:06] can because the church can hear what the
[38:08] Spirit is saying to the churches glory
[38:11] so I just that just kind of came to me
[38:14] there that God visited in the time of
[38:16] life the time appointed the right year
[38:19] praise the Lord
[38:20] so I would look at now months now from
[38:24] what I understand through Scripture
[38:26] seasons seem to be like months so a time
[38:30] is bigger time is like a year times
[38:32] maybe more than one year but then a
[38:35] season of course is a small amount of
[38:38] time in a person's life now that's what
[38:40] just from what I've seen I have searched
[38:42] season all the way through the Bible so
[38:43] that seems to fit through the Bible and
[38:46] we'll be showing some examples here but
[38:48] I want to start with months this thought
[38:50] on months how even months can be a
[38:52] season because there was a purpose in
[38:55] job's months it seemed like job was just
[38:59] struggling for months when he was going
[39:02] through his great tests according to the
[39:04] book of Job so let's read a few
[39:06] scriptures
[39:07] remember job his purpose not at least in
[39:11] part because you know a life can have
[39:12] many purposes right but job is
[39:15] remembered according to James job is
[39:18] remembered for one thing that's patience
[39:21] because the Bible said we count them
[39:23] happy which endure you have heard of the
[39:25] patience of Job and I've seen the end of
[39:28] the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful
[39:30] and of tender mercy so Joe one of his
[39:34] great purposes of existence was to
[39:37] manifest God's patience praise God and
[39:42] so when God had Jobe in his mind he like
[39:44] oh I could I'm gonna use job as a
[39:46] testimony he's gonna manifest my
[39:48] patience praise God brother Branham said
[39:51] that Joseph of the Old Testament was
[39:54] gonna manifest perfection because he was
[39:57] a perfect except for the lie that he
[39:59] told about the shepherds amen
[40:02] if you listen to the mighty conquer
[40:04] David 455 that's the brother Branham
[40:06] says Abraham represented justification
[40:08] right each one represented something I
[40:12] like to have a I'm gonna use an
[40:15] attribute of mine as faith
[40:16] I'm a news Abraham for faith and brother
[40:19] Adam said that each person represented a
[40:21] portion of God until Christ came and he
[40:24] represented all of it amen amen
[40:27] he was the fullness of the word the
[40:30] fullness of the attributes of God but
[40:33] Jove in God's mind I'm gonna use this
[40:36] man for patience and the Bible says this
[40:41] after this we read to verse 8 and please
[40:44] ask these three but 17s that I had said
[40:46] in my heart God shall judge the
[40:48] righteous and the wicked for there is a
[40:50] time there for every purpose and every
[40:55] work so in Joseph's life there was a
[40:57] certain time of his life for the purpose
[41:01] of patience now from what I've read it
[41:04] seems like job went through this
[41:06] struggle in the 70th year of his life
[41:08] because the Bible said after he came out
[41:10] of this trial God doubled everything and
[41:13] then he lived to be a hundred and forty
[41:15] God doubled his cattle got double his
[41:17] money gotten two doubled everything so
[41:19] it seems like he was 70 years old so in
[41:22] that middle point in his life God lets
[41:24] them go through these months of trial
[41:26] and tests and persecution that's unheard
[41:28] of that you and I don't even want to go
[41:31] through that do we right we know that's
[41:35] why Jesus pray lead us not into
[41:37] temptation right that's that's why
[41:39] that's in the Lord's Prayer because God
[41:41] allowed Satan to test him in this major
[41:44] manner this this extreme manner of
[41:47] losing family and finances and and then
[41:50] health he lost everything except God's
[41:54] grace amen
[41:56] that's all yeah he's lost everything
[41:58] except the integrity of his heart amen
[42:01] not to sin and not to say anything evil
[42:03] against God so see there was a time for
[42:06] job's life to produce patience have you
[42:09] come to that place yet have you come to
[42:13] the place yet where you feel like I
[42:15] can't wait any longer
[42:17] but God saying okay wait another month
[42:19] god I can't wait another week God said
[42:22] wait another year right think about that
[42:28] there's tie
[42:30] a purpose for everything under our lives
[42:32] and there's a purpose and a time for it
[42:35] and when we get to art when we think
[42:38] this is the end of our our strength God
[42:40] said wait a little longer you know you
[42:43] can't get bigger muscles unless you
[42:44] stretch and rip those muscles right
[42:46] that's the only way you're going to get
[42:48] bigger muscles if we want faith muscles
[42:50] we got to go through bigger tests right
[42:52] because God knows we can handle it God
[42:55] knows we can get through it God knows
[42:57] you can handle a couple more reps to get
[42:59] a little stronger in faith right God
[43:02] knows God will allow you to be pushed
[43:04] God allow you to go through the fires
[43:06] God allow you to be tested in order to
[43:08] produce the purpose of character in your
[43:11] life there's a time for every work under
[43:18] heaven job says this so I am made to
[43:23] possess months of a Nina so at the
[43:26] beginning of this this discussion he
[43:28] causes this vanity was that vanity
[43:30] Church let me ask was a vanity was this
[43:33] useless for job to go through this no
[43:35] because four thousand years later James
[43:37] says remember the patience of Job amen
[43:40] how many people brother bang do you
[43:43] think will walk up to job on that day
[43:45] and say thank you Joe for your testimony
[43:47] amen all right but see when he's going
[43:51] through it it seems like life is in vain
[43:54] this is just useless this is just awful
[43:57] what is my life why am I being tested
[44:00] like this why does it seem like
[44:01] everything's falling apart
[44:03] Jobe said that he said these are months
[44:05] of vanity this just like doesn't make
[44:08] any sense but yet it made all the sense
[44:10] in the mind of God oh god help us say
[44:15] amen don't be too scared Church in the
[44:19] midst of trials that's the time to shout
[44:21] the praise of God Amen that I'm going
[44:24] through this too shall pass I'll go
[44:26] through this season I'll come out better
[44:28] on the other side amen
[44:32] Jobe said which we all would say right
[44:35] we'd all say if you couldn't sleep at
[44:37] night you'd probably say that just like
[44:38] Joe I've only had a couple sleepless
[44:41] nights they've been pretty awful nights
[44:43] but Joe many nights couldn't sleep
[44:46] scratching the boils all the pain he's
[44:49] going through he says these are months
[44:52] of vanity later chapter 14 he said
[44:58] seeing his days there determines the
[45:00] number of his months are with thee so he
[45:03] knows so Joe was trying to work through
[45:05] this battle of months I'm Billy these
[45:08] are money's are awful months but I know
[45:10] God has a number determined praise God I
[45:15] heard a good I just heard something
[45:17] encouraging this week I liked it if you
[45:20] knew like if you knew your your answer
[45:23] to your prayer was in one more week
[45:24] because you hold on another week if you
[45:28] knew it was next month that someone in
[45:31] your family was going to get saved or
[45:32] cover the message would you be able to
[45:33] hold on faith for them of course if you
[45:36] knew but the point is we don't know and
[45:39] so since we don't know we've got to just
[45:43] stand on faith with faith means
[45:45] assurance or a revelation of God's will
[45:47] we've just got to stand on the faith
[45:49] that God's given us because we don't
[45:51] know when it's come to pass we've got to
[45:53] keep believing that it will come to pass
[45:56] so Joe's working through his mind it's
[45:59] in his heart you know my god I know
[46:00] you've determined a certain number of
[46:02] months for me to go through this amen we
[46:05] can say the same thing today praise God
[46:07] this trial is only going to us a certain
[46:09] number of months and God will be pitiful
[46:12] at the end gotta be merciful and God
[46:14] will bring me out of this trial see he's
[46:18] dealing with months we don't know how
[46:20] many months but he's using months he's
[46:23] not using years he's using months now he
[46:29] said
[46:30] the variant cuz memory Allah who comes
[46:31] pretty soon straightens him out he's
[46:34] getting toward the ends of his of his
[46:36] talk and he said he continued as parable
[46:39] o that I whereas in the months past as
[46:44] in the days when God preserved me he
[46:47] didn't realize it but God was preserving
[46:48] him there - right when his candles
[46:54] shined upon my head and when his by his
[46:56] lie I walked through the darkness see he
[47:00] was longing although just a few months
[47:02] ago life was so great I was on the
[47:04] mountaintop a few months ago why am I in
[47:06] the valley or if life could just be
[47:09] easier don't we all say that church we
[47:14] have so many similarities the joke all
[47:16] right
[47:17] as far as approaching trials now
[47:21] thankfully we haven't had to go to the
[47:23] extreme tests that he's gone through
[47:24] although we know some people have who've
[47:25] lost loved ones and in dramatic ways or
[47:28] disastrous ways we know that but still
[47:32] the point I'm trying to make is that it
[47:35] was months that he had to endure months
[47:38] and these months of testing producing
[47:41] his testimony where we could say look at
[47:44] the patience of Job now look I love this
[47:50] now it's God's turn to talk to Joe about
[47:53] months so don't keep saying all these
[47:55] hard months I wish it was like the old
[47:57] months and God says let me tell you
[47:59] about months Joe he said do you know at
[48:02] the time when the wild goats on the rock
[48:04] bring forth or can you mark when the
[48:07] kinds new calves see all those mountain
[48:12] goats and all these animals at jobs open
[48:14] up jobs living in nice little city down
[48:16] there and earn right God's like what do
[48:20] you know about the what what do you know
[48:21] about the months of the animals up there
[48:22] do you know when the when the right
[48:24] months are when they when they bring
[48:25] forth when they have babies can you tell
[48:27] me those months can you number the
[48:30] months that they fulfill how many months
[48:32] does a goat live up in the mountains job
[48:35] got the idea on that
[48:40] about the hinds the gazelle and the deer
[48:41] ha how many months do they live see
[48:47] God's not just like this pattycake kind
[48:49] of baby baby cake kind of person is he
[48:52] he's merciful but he's also he also
[48:57] knows what he's doing praise God and he
[49:01] knows speaking a job like this will
[49:04] produce what God wanted which was him to
[49:07] rent his clothes and repent in dust and
[49:09] ashes and say God you know more than I
[49:12] do I said things I should not have said
[49:15] praise God
[49:17] all these hardwoods all these hard
[49:19] months and god said tell me the number
[49:21] of months job oh god is so great they
[49:26] men church we gotta be careful what
[49:29] comes out of our mouths god help us amen
[49:31] God help all of us we start complaining
[49:35] about months God's gonna ask us what do
[49:37] you know about months right so I think
[49:42] it's beautiful how God knows how to
[49:45] Humble us remember this whole time I
[49:49] forget how many questions I think it was
[49:51] 61 God asked Joe God didn't tell Joe one
[49:54] answer to his question God asks him
[49:56] questions and God said where were you
[50:00] when I formed the where were you and I
[50:02] laid the foundations earth and all the
[50:03] sons of God the Angels shouted for joy
[50:05] where were you at ceases sometimes
[50:08] godness that when they give us the
[50:10] answers he just wants to bring us to a
[50:12] place of humility because memmer through
[50:17] suffering produces what suffering
[50:18] produces what church pride or obedience
[50:20] he is suffering always produces
[50:24] obedience that's what God wanted look
[50:28] with job so I look at David said I love
[50:30] this my times are in thy hand the years
[50:35] right time is a year times or more than
[50:38] one David said my times are in thy hand
[50:41] deliver me from the hand of my enemies
[50:43] and from them that persecute me so he's
[50:45] running from Saul and he says my times
[50:47] my years I've been running for years but
[50:50] my years are in your hands
[50:53] can you imagine running from your own
[50:56] father law in the hand of God right
[51:01] it's in God's it's in God's here it's
[51:04] not outside
[51:05] God hasn't forgotten you you're in the
[51:07] very hand of God
[51:10] you're not cast out God by God rejected
[51:13] by God you are in the hand of God we all
[51:19] need that perspective don't we I'm in
[51:21] the hand of God when I'm running from
[51:23] trial to trying to escape the floods
[51:26] that come in the enemy that comes in
[51:28] like a flood the Giants in our lives
[51:31] right the enemies that come up about us
[51:35] we're still in the hand of God to make
[51:40] your faces shine upon that servant save
[51:42] me for thy Mercy's sake Church I'm
[51:45] thankful to know my years are in God's
[51:47] hands God's the one that's allowed me to
[51:50] live this long if he gives me some more
[51:52] years thank the Lord all my years are in
[51:54] God's hands I love this now we must
[52:00] understand what the years are calling us
[52:05] to do now it's easy to see in a few
[52:08] examples but let me read this first
[52:10] like speaking of like fathers and
[52:13] mothers like you're the years that
[52:14] you're raising children right so I don't
[52:17] forget that that's why I said I don't
[52:19] wanna forget that but let's read us and
[52:20] of the half a tribe of manasseh 18,000
[52:23] which were expressed by name to come and
[52:25] make David King
[52:28] imagine having 18,000 people behind you
[52:30] they have all these political rallies
[52:32] you know make this person president make
[52:35] this was just one tribe right this is
[52:37] I'm sorry this is just a half tribe all
[52:39] these people trying to make David King
[52:41] and have a children of Issachar which
[52:44] were men
[52:45] I like this that had understanding of
[52:47] the times of the years to know what
[52:51] Israel out to do that's what we need
[52:53] today we need men and women who know
[52:54] what God wants them to do right now in
[52:57] these times these years of their life
[53:00] don't waste these years these are
[53:03] precious years amen
[53:06] we should say God gave me understanding
[53:08] for these years to know what we ought to
[53:12] do the heads of them were 200 and other
[53:16] brethren were at their commandment they
[53:19] knew what to do the Bible said that
[53:22] David was King and had run over the
[53:24] house of Judah 7 years and 6 months so
[53:28] in these last few years remember David
[53:30] ruled over Hebron first for 7 years not
[53:32] all Israel had run so those last few
[53:35] years the men of Issachar started saying
[53:38] he's going to be king over all of Israel
[53:41] that's what Samuel Samuel anointed him
[53:44] and he's going to be king over at all so
[53:46] these men knew the word of the hour
[53:49] going
[53:50] they knew the message they knew the
[53:52] leader for the hour praise God and they
[53:56] said we're making ready we're going to
[53:57] get everybody gathered around ready we
[54:00] know what God wants to be done right now
[54:02] God wants to make David king over all of
[54:05] Israel and so they gathered support and
[54:08] they support it with all they could they
[54:10] did everything in their power to bring
[54:13] to pass God's leadership for that hour
[54:16] amen
[54:17] because David's purpose of his life the
[54:20] Bible said was to be ruler over my
[54:22] people Israel not just have rod but all
[54:25] Israel Amen I like that and may God help
[54:29] us to apply that to our lives a little
[54:31] bit that all of us can see what is
[54:34] what's happening today the move is on
[54:37] who the bride the moves out on the
[54:40] Prophet program said that move is on the
[54:42] bride and she only moves when she's got
[54:45] thus saith the Lord like Amen read in
[54:47] the church age book this week because we
[54:48] were talking about that and the bride
[54:50] early moves with thus saith the Lord to
[54:54] see the move is on us and we are
[54:57] supposed to make Christ king we're
[54:59] supposed to make the Christ King the
[55:01] king of our lives amen
[55:03] because we know Jesus Christ is coming
[55:06] into power amen
[55:07] so anything we can do to put Christ more
[55:11] at the forefront of our lives is what we
[55:14] should be doing like we said some of
[55:18] these
[55:20] some of these are more obvious than
[55:22] others so yeah later on in the same
[55:25] chapter about the meta mystic are these
[55:27] men of war that could keep rank see they
[55:29] could keep their place they could they
[55:30] just sit together in heavenly places and
[55:32] not get out of rank and came with a
[55:34] perfect heart to have run to make David
[55:36] king over Israel and all the rest of
[55:38] Israel were one heart to make David King
[55:43] now Church you and I can see that
[55:45] there's times of our lives where God's
[55:48] called us and we know what mean we must
[55:50] do if we have young children like I do
[55:52] and vagin we've got young children
[55:54] youngsters Naomi then we should know
[55:58] what we ought to do we ought to train up
[56:00] our children in the fear of God we ought
[56:04] to live such a godly life in front of
[56:06] them we ought to just fill them with
[56:08] love and fill them with teaching and
[56:09] model what it means to be a Christian
[56:12] praise God now that's an easy time and
[56:16] season for us to see that we should not
[56:18] put that off that should be at the very
[56:20] forefront of our duties as families they
[56:24] men now if you're single than or you're
[56:27] married without children then you have
[56:28] to seek God - what to do in that air
[56:30] that season of your life what is God
[56:33] what ought you do in that time praise
[56:35] God so see that's just one example that
[56:42] could easily think of what's your
[56:44] younger or middle-aged or getting older
[56:46] there's different seasons of life and
[56:49] you must do what God has called you to
[56:51] do what you ought to do in that stage of
[56:54] life amen now there's just a few general
[56:59] scriptures on time I'd like to look at
[57:04] the Bible said wherefore he saith awake
[57:06] thou that sleepest and arise from the
[57:08] dead in Christ shall give thee light
[57:10] how many awake in Christ how many got
[57:12] the light of Christ I'm not sleeping I'm
[57:14] awake in Christ I've got his light see
[57:17] them that ye walk circumspectly so if
[57:20] you are awake and the light of Christ
[57:22] has waken you up you're supposed to walk
[57:25] circumspectly which is accurately
[57:28] diligently or exactly so it's kind
[57:31] like a example of target practice right
[57:34] you're supposed to your life should be
[57:37] accurately aims in some direction we
[57:41] should know our purpose and this one I
[57:43] believe that God is going to bring us
[57:45] too we should know our gifts as I said
[57:47] the beginning of this series we should
[57:48] know our gifts so we know or what God
[57:51] has called us to do what's the purpose
[57:53] of my life what do I need to invest in
[57:56] so that God can manifest his Spirit in
[57:59] my life if my life is living for others
[58:03] and I've got gifts that are for others
[58:05] how can I accurately align my life so
[58:09] God can get the most out of the gifts
[58:11] he's placed in my life I just wander
[58:15] from pillar to post and wonder from
[58:17] service the service week to week month
[58:18] to month year to year season the season
[58:21] not just wandering around but but be
[58:23] very accurate I know what God wants me
[58:26] to do right now praise the Lord see we
[58:32] need to walk accurately not missing the
[58:35] mark sinner is the word that means
[58:36] missing the mark right in the Latin if
[58:38] I'm not mistaken means to miss the mark
[58:42] is that right Latin oh great go thank
[58:45] you I knew it was a foreign language
[58:49] seaso fools now see this is where
[58:52] foolish virgin and wise virgin teaching
[58:54] comes in really simply wise Christians
[58:57] will walk very accurately and diligently
[58:59] in their direction God's called them to
[59:01] go in though no they'll be very accurate
[59:04] God wants me to do this right now
[59:05] God wants me to do that now I'm going to
[59:09] be able to touch myself pretty soon the
[59:10] book the book goes on presale on Friday
[59:12] then it gets the next Friday goes on
[59:14] sale so I'm gonna be able to see the
[59:16] effects now from though that book if
[59:18] this was the accurate time in season
[59:20] four that and I hope I could go back
[59:21] here and say it was I believe it was is
[59:24] this something I've never done before so
[59:26] strange and so seems out so outside of
[59:28] my natural thinking it seemed to be led
[59:30] by the Holy Spirit but see accurately
[59:33] doing exactly what God would have me to
[59:35] do redeeming the time now redeem means
[59:38] to make wise for a sacred use
[59:43] because days are evil how many can say
[59:45] amen to that these days that we live
[59:48] amongst our evil their evil days Evil's
[59:51] all around us but Paul said redeem that
[59:53] time buy it back make a sacred use of it
[59:56] make sure you use those days wisely so
[1:00:00] there's another word there's another way
[1:00:02] time is used is just all your time not
[1:00:04] just a year but all your time now you
[1:00:09] know look he just kind of goes on I want
[1:00:10] to just read this because this kind of
[1:00:12] ties with the men of Issachar wherefore
[1:00:14] you be not unwise but understanding what
[1:00:17] the will of the Lord is so the men of
[1:00:19] Issachar had understanding to know what
[1:00:21] to do Paul says the same thing wise
[1:00:23] Christians have understanding they know
[1:00:26] what to do they know God's will God's
[1:00:30] will was to make David King and that
[1:00:32] after that seventh year in had brought
[1:00:33] God's will was to make him King
[1:00:35] they caught the inspiration we're gonna
[1:00:37] make him King right they understood this
[1:00:39] is what we're supposed to do god help us
[1:00:41] to see what God is doing right now amen
[1:00:49] verse 18 a be not drunk with wine
[1:00:51] wherein is excess but be filled with the
[1:00:54] spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms
[1:00:57] and hymns and spiritual songs singing
[1:00:59] and making melody in your heart to Lord
[1:01:01] so if you and I do these things we'll
[1:01:04] definitely be able to say that we
[1:01:05] understand God's will if we're filled
[1:01:07] with the spirit constantly speaking in
[1:01:10] worship and Thanksgiving so always
[1:01:13] having a song on your heart always
[1:01:14] singing the songs of God and always
[1:01:16] giving thanks the Bible said give thanks
[1:01:18] always for all things you mean even this
[1:01:22] even these months of patience give
[1:01:24] thanks yes even these months and years
[1:01:27] of patience you've got to give God
[1:01:28] thanks in the midst of those months for
[1:01:31] all things under God and the father in
[1:01:33] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:36] hallelujah
[1:01:39] now collage
[1:01:41] is like a mini letter of Ephesians how
[1:01:44] many knew that it's almost like Paul
[1:01:45] Paul wrote both from prison and it's
[1:01:47] almost like he wrote the Ephesian one
[1:01:49] and it's almost like before he sent it
[1:01:51] out he just wrote a shorter version of
[1:01:53] it and sent it out to the city of chaos
[1:01:55] it's almost has so many similarities
[1:01:59] walking wisdom toward them that are
[1:02:02] without redeeming the time let your
[1:02:04] speech be always with grace seasoned
[1:02:06] with salt that you may know how you
[1:02:07] ought to answer every man so your whole
[1:02:12] walk is in wisdom and wisdom the
[1:02:14] beginning of it is fearing God so
[1:02:17] churches just that simple more today I'm
[1:02:19] going to walk in your will and know what
[1:02:21] I'm walking in the fear of God I don't
[1:02:23] want to do my will today my brother cam
[1:02:25] said that we should pray and say God put
[1:02:27] me in your path I've been praying that
[1:02:29] this week put me in your path amen
[1:02:32] so that's how wisdom begins fearing God
[1:02:36] and say God put me in your path today
[1:02:38] put me in your path for this year or
[1:02:40] this month put me in your path help me
[1:02:42] to catch the time and season and
[1:02:45] understand what I'm supposed to do for
[1:02:47] God hallelujah let's move now to some
[1:02:51] seasoned scriptures here this was pretty
[1:02:54] good thought from the scripture and the
[1:02:57] captain of the guard charged joseph with
[1:02:59] them and he served them and they
[1:03:00] continued a season in ward
[1:03:03] so these Butler and Baker the two men
[1:03:05] they continued a season in the war now
[1:03:09] Joseph was in jail two years right we
[1:03:11] went through that a couple weeks ago but
[1:03:13] now they just continue a season that's
[1:03:16] why it seems like it was months and they
[1:03:19] dream to dream both of them each man his
[1:03:21] dream in one night each man according to
[1:03:23] interpretation of the dream the butler
[1:03:25] and the Baker the King which were bound
[1:03:26] in prison now that's interesting this
[1:03:30] season was within the two-year period
[1:03:32] but Joseph was set there at the season
[1:03:36] of life and death so Joseph played a
[1:03:39] crucial part in the season of someone
[1:03:42] else's life amen glory you know I think
[1:03:48] about when my
[1:03:49] coach just died a few or last month I
[1:03:51] had people text me and say God had you
[1:03:53] there at the right time in season to let
[1:03:55] everybody know that he actually believed
[1:03:57] in Jesus cuz he never let anybody know
[1:03:59] and the people could have hope and
[1:04:02] instead of bitterness and mourning in
[1:04:04] their heart that they don't know if he
[1:04:05] served God but I got it on tape I got to
[1:04:07] ask him I said are you trusting in Jesus
[1:04:09] Christ for your salvation and he said
[1:04:11] yes I am I had to be there at the season
[1:04:14] of his life the very end of his life to
[1:04:17] be there to give people assurance that
[1:04:19] he tried to serve God and read the Bible
[1:04:21] 25 times that's that's pretty faithful
[1:04:23] as far as I'm concerned that looks like
[1:04:26] the fear of God to me but it's so Joseph
[1:04:29] was there at a season of his life you
[1:04:32] know over the course of this church
[1:04:33] we've had different brothers move in
[1:04:35] like young brothers that aren't married
[1:04:36] and then God you know they were going to
[1:04:38] college like one of the brothers name
[1:04:40] was Peter he's out in Arizona now but
[1:04:41] but he was just here for a year maybe a
[1:04:44] couple of months year and months and
[1:04:45] then it's like God after college God
[1:04:48] gave him a job and sent out to Arizona
[1:04:49] and now he's got a wife and children
[1:04:50] well when he left he said he said
[1:04:52] brother Jesse thank you that you were
[1:04:54] there this season of my life this church
[1:04:58] was such a blessing at this season of my
[1:05:00] life a church that's how it is with
[1:05:03] people who come and go it's already half
[1:05:05] our mercy we we don't know what God's
[1:05:12] doing and even like this list Simon in
[1:05:14] order then the service we don't know
[1:05:15] what God's doing God may be using us to
[1:05:19] be a light for people for a very small
[1:05:22] season of their life but we've got to be
[1:05:24] the ones who stand on God's Word amen
[1:05:27] Joseph just fed them the word he just
[1:05:30] fed them the revelation of their dream
[1:05:32] for that little season and then they
[1:05:33] were good they both forgot about him but
[1:05:35] God didn't forget about it amen
[1:05:38] hallelujah people will use you like
[1:05:42] jesus said people will use you for your
[1:05:44] spiritual gifts or for what you can do
[1:05:46] for their life but don't mind if they
[1:05:48] forget you because you know God will
[1:05:50] never forget his children your engrave
[1:05:52] in the palm of his hands amen hallelujah
[1:05:56] amen just for a few seasons a few season
[1:06:02] your important
[1:06:03] somebody and all of a sudden see you
[1:06:05] later
[1:06:06] I'd say as hard as a pastor I've been
[1:06:08] through I've been through a machine I've
[1:06:10] got many a tear many seasons you try to
[1:06:15] get everything you can to people see you
[1:06:19] later
[1:06:21] you know how it is with friends - yeah
[1:06:24] but our responsibility is not to get
[1:06:27] disheartened Joseph's got this heart
[1:06:29] right but God was still with him amen we
[1:06:31] may guess get disheartened but joy comes
[1:06:34] in the morning a new season comes amen
[1:06:38] we just got to continue faithful stay
[1:06:41] faithful think about the my battles he
[1:06:44] had Wow
[1:06:46] God you know I've been in here almost
[1:06:48] two years I - people come in I felt the
[1:06:51] Friends of God God moves supernaturally
[1:06:53] and yet they forget about me I'm still
[1:06:55] here hunk is God even with me anymore
[1:06:58] think about the battle Church
[1:07:01] supernaturally visions in jail
[1:07:04] Supernatural revelations and then they
[1:07:07] forget about you thank God he never
[1:07:12] forgets about his children huh
[1:07:15] striking isn't it you're just striking
[1:07:17] these are really striking things
[1:07:19] remember I've been saying this
[1:07:21] repeatedly about I just want to show it
[1:07:22] to you David would not remove the are
[1:07:24] Coloradan unto him in the City of David
[1:07:26] but David carried it aside in the house
[1:07:27] of obed-edom heed I'm sorry obed-edom
[1:07:33] the get tight and the article or
[1:07:35] continue the house of obed-edom the get
[1:07:38] tight three months and the Lord bless
[1:07:39] obed-edom and all of his house now I
[1:07:42] need to study out I did study out
[1:07:44] seasons I need to study all the quotes
[1:07:45] on times and seasons and this one I was
[1:07:47] sharing earlier David felt led of the
[1:07:50] Lord but BAM said you have to have the
[1:07:52] time seasoned person the word and
[1:07:55] there's one more I can't marry always oh
[1:07:57] the prophet yeah so David only missed on
[1:08:01] one of those the word he only missed on
[1:08:03] the word everything else was right
[1:08:06] there's a prophet there it was who is
[1:08:07] everything else he forgot to put the ark
[1:08:09] upon the shoulders and said he put it on
[1:08:12] a new car and it caused death right a
[1:08:15] man that were
[1:08:16] just trying to be kind so I like to
[1:08:18] protect God's our key reaches out and
[1:08:20] death strikes and programs said death
[1:08:22] will strike when we try to do things
[1:08:24] without consulting God's Word
[1:08:26] oh god help us to consult your Lord
[1:08:28] today men before we do anything consult
[1:08:32] the Word of God amen
[1:08:35] but as I said I don't I'm not down on
[1:08:38] David he only missed it by three months
[1:08:41] right that's pretty good that's pretty
[1:08:45] close he was in other words he was in
[1:08:47] the channel the Holy Spirit and that's
[1:08:49] what we want to be we want to be in the
[1:08:50] channel of the Holy Spirit to bring the
[1:08:54] word the ark back to God's God's
[1:08:59] Jerusalem amen you back to the capital
[1:09:01] city amen bring God's Ark back to where
[1:09:04] it should be in Jerusalem so three
[1:09:08] months month see it's again it's months
[1:09:11] a season of his life
[1:09:13] and in that season whoever had that Ark
[1:09:15] you were blessed if you stayed true that
[1:09:17] word if word was in your house you'll be
[1:09:20] blessed amen
[1:09:21] that's so true now this is just
[1:09:25] interesting one and let the children
[1:09:27] Israel also be or keep the Passover at
[1:09:29] his appointed season so that we're
[1:09:32] coming up on that right we're coming up
[1:09:33] on Passover it was in a appointed season
[1:09:38] there's a time so it was like a like
[1:09:41] this one little month of the year right
[1:09:42] where that Passover and unleavened bread
[1:09:45] and then firstfruits in the 14th day of
[1:09:49] this month so here we have season here
[1:09:51] we have a season but in the season we
[1:09:53] have a month that's even he shot out
[1:09:59] keep it in his appointed season
[1:10:01] according to all the rights of according
[1:10:03] to all the ceremonies there ye shall
[1:10:04] keep it the Passover was kept in a month
[1:10:07] in a season all right now let's look at
[1:10:13] a few
[1:10:13] scriptures about all seasons so see
[1:10:15] Church there's some things that will not
[1:10:17] be seasonal there's some things that you
[1:10:20] and I we we can say okay this is just a
[1:10:23] season but there's some things that
[1:10:24] aren't some things we don't we can't say
[1:10:29] all that I'm not ready this isn't the
[1:10:30] season there's some things we can't how
[1:10:32] many can say amen to that there's some
[1:10:34] things in the scripture you and I can't
[1:10:36] say well I can't do it's not the right
[1:10:38] season is there some things we've got to
[1:10:42] be instant in season and out of the
[1:10:44] season and that's judging evil and doing
[1:10:49] good look with God remember Jethro Tull
[1:10:53] Moses and Moses chose able men of all
[1:10:56] Israel made them heads are the people
[1:10:58] rulers of thousands rulers of 100 0:52
[1:11:00] rows of tens and they judge the people
[1:11:02] at all seasons because you have all
[1:11:07] these problems you have all these
[1:11:09] troubles and struggles in the church you
[1:11:13] can't say well I'm just going to judge
[1:11:14] in the in the spring that's the only
[1:11:16] time I'm gonna make these things run
[1:11:17] right well I'll just take summer when I
[1:11:20] have free time and that's what I'll deal
[1:11:22] with all these problems no God was
[1:11:25] moving Moses to see that all problems
[1:11:28] must be del immediately not time and
[1:11:32] season we must try to deal with them
[1:11:33] immediately like the Bible said don't
[1:11:37] let the Sun the Sun things took place at
[1:11:42] all seasons and that's dealing with sin
[1:11:47] like if I hurt vang or if I heard you
[1:11:49] know Aaron or somebody
[1:11:50] I shouldn't say well I know I hurt them
[1:11:52] but I'll wait a few months and we'll see
[1:11:55] how how it feels then maybe they'll
[1:11:57] forget about it maybe we'll just kind of
[1:11:59] brush it under the rug we can't do that
[1:12:02] with sin because sin is a seed as well a
[1:12:04] seed of discrepancy right and that sin
[1:12:08] if it's not rooted up if you don't say
[1:12:10] sorry if I don't repent say sorry it's
[1:12:12] only going to grow it'll become a root
[1:12:17] of bitterness Paul said don't let Paul
[1:12:20] so don't take any root of bitters
[1:12:21] he said uproot the root of bitterness
[1:12:23] and he said be rooted and grounded in
[1:12:26] amen oh yeah that's the kind of roots we
[1:12:30] need a brighter Christ Fellowship which
[1:12:32] I believe are here I really do believe
[1:12:34] they're here I really do and if some
[1:12:38] don't see it well I wish they look a
[1:12:39] little harder right because if I've done
[1:12:43] any wrong please let me know right so
[1:12:45] that's you that's how you feel - Paul
[1:12:51] said I charge thee Timothy before God
[1:12:53] and the Lord Jesus Christ think about
[1:12:55] that he's just a lowly preacher he's not
[1:12:57] a prophet to the aged but a prophet
[1:12:59] charges the low preacher I'm charging
[1:13:02] you I'm giving you a commission in the
[1:13:03] prends of Jesus Christ who shall judge
[1:13:06] the quick and the dead is appearing in
[1:13:08] his kingdom preach the word amen don't
[1:13:12] just read mine just don't read my eyes
[1:13:13] right just don't play tapes you preach
[1:13:16] the word
[1:13:17] that's God's bad or not that's something
[1:13:19] we've been talking about it's just the
[1:13:22] struggle the hour you know it's the wave
[1:13:24] of it's the wind of doctrine going
[1:13:26] through right now preach the word be
[1:13:28] instant that means ready in season out
[1:13:32] of season and it's true brother amen
[1:13:35] there's times there season I feel like I
[1:13:36] feel like preaching and then there's
[1:13:38] other seasons I don't really feel like
[1:13:39] preaching maybe I'm sick maybe I'm
[1:13:42] exhausted maybe I have in mind battles
[1:13:45] maybe I'm hurt maybe somebody broke my
[1:13:47] heart and I don't really feel like
[1:13:48] preaching praise God so there sighs we
[1:13:55] don't feel like it there's times if you
[1:13:57] have a gift which you all do there's
[1:13:59] times you won't feel like using your
[1:14:00] gift there's times you won't feel like
[1:14:02] investing in your gift hey it's true
[1:14:07] it's like that for everybody
[1:14:09] but with these with with gifts and with
[1:14:11] the word and knowing that God is going
[1:14:14] to judge us by what we do with our gifts
[1:14:16] Paul said don't don't stop just keep
[1:14:19] preaching be ready in your season and
[1:14:22] odyssey's and just be ready all the time
[1:14:24] because you know Jesus Christ could come
[1:14:26] back any time
[1:14:28] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:14:32] longsuffering so people don't listen
[1:14:36] right away just keep being
[1:14:37] long-suffering with them right
[1:14:40] if people would obey and they still want
[1:14:43] to come to church just let them keep
[1:14:44] coming to church now unless there's you
[1:14:47] know fornicating and then they won't
[1:14:48] confess it then get that 11 out of the
[1:14:50] church but they're just learning how to
[1:14:53] obey the Lord and are living as clean as
[1:14:55] they can they just can't get victory
[1:14:57] whatever reason be long-suffering with
[1:15:00] them and doctrine that's what we're
[1:15:05] doing today for time will come when they
[1:15:06] will not endure sound doctrine and isn't
[1:15:09] that what we got today I can put the
[1:15:12] scripture like I did on Facebook I can
[1:15:14] put that scripture that thighs our
[1:15:16] nakedness and the scripture literally
[1:15:18] says I'm gonna uncover your thighs your
[1:15:20] nakedness and some of those people that
[1:15:22] see that post today are still gonna wear
[1:15:24] shorts tomorrow or whatever it heats up
[1:15:27] like we're living in a time they won't
[1:15:30] even endure something so solid something
[1:15:33] so clear right jesus said father only
[1:15:38] goes ten days later Peter says Lord
[1:15:40] Jesus Christ and all five examples in
[1:15:42] the book of Acts our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:44] it's so clear but they can't endure
[1:15:46] sound doctrine thank God that Jesus said
[1:15:48] blessed are your eyes where they see
[1:15:50] rested on your ears for they hear be so
[1:15:55] be ready be solid constantly be ready
[1:16:00] with the Word of God
[1:16:01] so you cos there's gonna come a time all
[1:16:04] they want as preachers that will give
[1:16:05] them their lusts the Bible said we don't
[1:16:11] with these cases with sin it's not a
[1:16:13] choice well I can kind of let down my
[1:16:15] guard a little bit you know I'm not
[1:16:17] really in the season of temptation no
[1:16:18] sir you know ma'am we are always in the
[1:16:20] season of temptation we must always be
[1:16:23] ready to fight off Satan now let's get
[1:16:30] times and seasons here I'm gonna set my
[1:16:36] timer for 15 minutes okay
[1:16:37] that'll give me that be good okay now we
[1:16:41] read this in our text and I'm just gonna
[1:16:42] skip through this cuz we already read
[1:16:44] this but did you notice Church now this
[1:16:47] is something I stuff to study but this
[1:16:49] is so striking to me there what I'm
[1:16:51] saying is that this is I feel like I've
[1:16:53] hit a
[1:16:54] a vein in the earth of gold and I just
[1:16:56] found out just the first gold nugget but
[1:16:59] if there's gold here and there's got to
[1:17:00] be gold under there that's what I felt
[1:17:03] like today so I'm not going to get as
[1:17:04] deep today because I'm not ready to go
[1:17:06] deep but I still felt led to preach this
[1:17:08] now these are both opposite and I'm
[1:17:12] going to explain this in a minute born
[1:17:15] and die or both opposites but they can
[1:17:17] also be complementary which means they
[1:17:20] can happen at different times or they
[1:17:23] can happen at the same time now but I'll
[1:17:27] lose you on this
[1:17:29] they're both opposites you know you like
[1:17:32] program born 1909 died 1965 right we can
[1:17:36] all see that opposites but spiritually
[1:17:40] many times they happen right at the same
[1:17:42] time so here's a man as an example
[1:17:48] brother Graham died in 1909 these are
[1:17:52] now these are opposites planting and
[1:17:54] pluck up here's opposites you and I we
[1:17:56] plant in the spring if we do any
[1:17:58] vegetables or fruits whatever do but in
[1:18:00] the fall you got to pluck it up and take
[1:18:03] all those dead ones and burn them or
[1:18:04] whatever you do use them for compost
[1:18:06] they're not at the same time there are
[1:18:09] opposite times ones when it's getting
[1:18:11] warmer you plant and the other when it's
[1:18:14] getting colder you pluck up those are
[1:18:18] opposites right so what I need it I need
[1:18:21] more time to go through all these you
[1:18:22] know kind of show more examples I just
[1:18:24] need more time
[1:18:26] now here let's look at that spiritual
[1:18:29] you say born and die can happen at the
[1:18:32] same time yes
[1:18:33] brother Ram said once you die out fully
[1:18:36] he'll come in fully amen I know yeah
[1:18:40] they're so close together if you want to
[1:18:42] be bored you got to die amen so see now
[1:18:46] we can start seeing some spiritual
[1:18:48] meaning here is this a season of my life
[1:18:51] physically to die it's a season for
[1:18:54] geneviève to be born right and this baby
[1:18:58] the new baby bang bang Junior
[1:19:01] not speak anything about it but there's
[1:19:06] a time to be born and a time to die
[1:19:09] well spiritually there's a season where
[1:19:12] your your longing to die and be born
[1:19:15] again amen die out because Jesus said
[1:19:19] the scene must rot and die and then it
[1:19:21] brings much for a man so this is where
[1:19:26] you and I can look at these fourteen
[1:19:28] seasons and start thinking mind where
[1:19:31] are we at right now where are we right
[1:19:34] now if if that's your desire to know
[1:19:40] where you are I for one I have for one
[1:19:42] would like to know her him now where he
[1:19:47] get to this one this is so striking that
[1:19:48] I just I was I was just really struck by
[1:19:51] that yesterday so spiritually there's a
[1:19:55] time to be born and die it isn't it
[1:19:57] interesting you get fill with the Holy
[1:19:59] Ghost that's the first thing and now
[1:20:00] you're ready to live through the seasons
[1:20:01] of life isn't that striking isn't that
[1:20:04] striking and then peace like dying you
[1:20:08] die in peace right and you go off to
[1:20:10] meet Jesus amen glory and all the
[1:20:14] brothers run up and say my precious
[1:20:16] brother and they hug you now not maybe
[1:20:20] not millions for me but maybe there'll
[1:20:21] be like 50 run up and say my precious
[1:20:23] brother
[1:20:25] couple people that knew me in heaven
[1:20:27] because they're so few today interesting
[1:20:33] now spiritually think about that there's
[1:20:36] time to plant and pluck up spiritually
[1:20:40] let me go to I got another slide on that
[1:20:42] one yeah let's go this one so
[1:20:45] spiritually there's a time to get and
[1:20:48] lose this happens at the same time when
[1:20:50] you lose your life jesus said you find
[1:20:53] it amen oh I love that
[1:20:56] you see these have great spiritual
[1:21:00] applications to a stake this is a season
[1:21:02] of our life jesus said let a man go to
[1:21:08] the plow and look back and they go out
[1:21:10] maybe I should not have done this
[1:21:12] right there's a certain season where
[1:21:16] you've got to just say I've sold out I'm
[1:21:18] not looking back I'm pressing on I work
[1:21:21] that 11th hour
[1:21:23] I'll finish this 11th hour and I'll get
[1:21:25] my penny and I work till Jesus comes I'm
[1:21:28] not looking back
[1:21:30] I've lost my life that I might gain my
[1:21:33] life thank you Lord amen that we can
[1:21:39] find our true life on this earth and
[1:21:44] then when you are real Holy Ghost real
[1:21:46] Christian you won't live your own life
[1:21:47] you'll live the life that Christ has
[1:21:49] chosen for you and then I love this one
[1:21:57] 13 love and hate Jesus had you got to
[1:22:00] hate your family in order to love him
[1:22:02] see now that
[1:22:10] you
[1:22:38] say they love righteousness at the same
[1:22:40] time at the same time I just as men take
[1:22:45] I hate the sin and then I love Jesus so
[1:22:48] much my glory times and seasons there's
[1:22:54] a purpose for all these seasons under
[1:22:56] heaven there's a purpose for all these
[1:22:58] in our spiritual life now I'd like to
[1:23:04] know that one refrain from embracing I
[1:23:06] liked it kind of now I can see in the
[1:23:07] natural a little bit but I'd kind of
[1:23:13] like to know on that one too by God's
[1:23:14] grace so like I said I'm study on that
[1:23:18] more let me here's the one that was so
[1:23:21] striking to me the last one is a time of
[1:23:24] war and a time of peace it's the last
[1:23:26] number fourteen of the the pairs and
[1:23:29] Psalm 37 this is beautiful
[1:23:31] says mark the perfect man and behold the
[1:23:36] upright for the end of that man is peace
[1:23:41] isn't that amazing I just about blew me
[1:23:44] off my chair and I was studying
[1:23:45] yesterday peace is the last season is
[1:23:51] the last time and the Bible's at the end
[1:23:54] of that righteous man is peace praise
[1:23:59] God
[1:24:00] that's beautiful the beginning is being
[1:24:04] born by the Holy Ghost dying itself and
[1:24:07] the end of that Holy Ghost filled
[1:24:09] believer is peace in Christ glory your
[1:24:13] warring against Satan all the way up to
[1:24:15] death amen jesus said be faithful not
[1:24:18] until unto death amen
[1:24:21] right so it's time for you to die you
[1:24:24] say okay God take me now
[1:24:26] I'm ready to die because I fought a good
[1:24:28] fight I finished the core saying that
[1:24:30] I'm ready for eternal peace I don't know
[1:24:33] amen
[1:24:35] the end of that man will be peace so the
[1:24:39] last season of a Christians life will be
[1:24:41] such peace in God they won't feel any
[1:24:45] any hard feelings it won't feel any
[1:24:48] farness from God or I just feel closer
[1:24:50] to the Lord I just
[1:24:52] he may come any moment I may take my
[1:24:54] last breath any moment
[1:24:56] I feel the peace of God in my heart I'm
[1:24:58] singing I worship it I'm just thankful
[1:25:01] for everything the peace of God what a
[1:25:07] season to be in praise God what a season
[1:25:11] god help us
[1:25:14] now remember also I want to bring out
[1:25:16] here
[1:25:16] the fruit of the Spirit is these nine
[1:25:19] fruits we know that remember number nine
[1:25:21] is the number of finality or maturity
[1:25:23] and so fruit is the final purpose of a
[1:25:29] plant right through is the final purpose
[1:25:32] and one of those fruits is peace I
[1:25:36] forgot to highlight it I want to
[1:25:37] highlight that give me a moment let me
[1:25:39] highlight that so then I got it for next
[1:25:40] time all right peace so the end of that
[1:25:48] man is peace and that fits perfectly
[1:25:51] with the fruit of the Spirit the purpose
[1:25:53] the the maturity of a Christian will be
[1:25:56] peace at the end that's what he'll
[1:25:57] mature too she'll mature to be a very
[1:26:00] peaceful person enjoy a season of peace
[1:26:03] with God amen now look at this but his
[1:26:09] delight is in the law of the Lord and in
[1:26:11] his law doth he meditate day and night
[1:26:14] now let's look at meditate real quick it
[1:26:16] means to muse or to devise it means to
[1:26:21] imagine the law of God look at that and
[1:26:28] if a man of God or a woman of God
[1:26:30] meditates and delights in the Word of
[1:26:33] God they'll be like a tree planted by
[1:26:35] rivers of water that brings forth his
[1:26:38] fruit in his season so people wonder oh
[1:26:43] I don't have that why don't I feel the
[1:26:44] fruits of God in my life well there's a
[1:26:46] prerequisite to fruit you got to
[1:26:48] meditate in the Word of God in other
[1:26:51] words you got to let yourself be planted
[1:26:53] and you really got to take time
[1:26:55] meditating praying reading the Word of
[1:26:57] God you just have to give quiet yourself
[1:27:00] down make time people say there's not
[1:27:02] time you've got to make time for God
[1:27:05] amen
[1:27:06] that's where and after that after
[1:27:10] meditating and remaining in it being
[1:27:12] planted in the word then you bring forth
[1:27:16] the fruit in the season then you
[1:27:21] manifest love for these last few months
[1:27:24] I've never felt such love in my life
[1:27:26] these last few months I've never had
[1:27:28] such joy in my life these last few
[1:27:31] months this last season of my life I've
[1:27:34] never felt such peace or long-suffering
[1:27:36] or gentleness I've never felt such
[1:27:38] goodness or I've never seen such faith
[1:27:40] in my life these last few months I felt
[1:27:45] such meekness in my heart I've been so
[1:27:48] God has given me such temperate
[1:27:49] self-control I used to struggle with
[1:27:51] this other thing these last few months
[1:27:53] I've had victory over brother that's the
[1:27:55] kind of testimonies that really bless
[1:27:57] your heart because those are more than
[1:27:59] just a short little anointing that
[1:28:02] lasted a while and then you know you're
[1:28:03] discouraged you're upset but these are
[1:28:05] fruits that took time and seasons and
[1:28:09] the rest the Word of God being planted
[1:28:12] being faithful amen day in day out that
[1:28:16] produces this fruit of the Spirit this
[1:28:21] daily meditation this this month long
[1:28:23] this season long meditation how many
[1:28:25] want to meditate on God's Word oh it's
[1:28:27] the sweetest times in my life is when
[1:28:29] you meditate on God's Word and the Bible
[1:28:34] said be still know that I'm God like
[1:28:36] that's God commands us to do that sit
[1:28:38] still get planted and just soak it in
[1:28:42] soak it in and after that will come some
[1:28:46] fruit out of that so see it's
[1:28:48] prerequisite
[1:28:53] now here's another interesting scripture
[1:28:55] but the wisdom about law and wisdom at
[1:28:59] the beginning is first pure then
[1:29:00] peaceable then gentle and easy to be
[1:29:02] intreated full of mercy and good fruits
[1:29:04] without partiality without hypocrisy
[1:29:06] since what God's wisdom is like I think
[1:29:08] there's 7 fold description there 1 2 3 4
[1:29:12] 5 yep 6 7 no 8 8 okay so a wisdom has an
[1:29:18] Eightfold manifestation I already
[1:29:21] preached on that I just could remember
[1:29:22] which number was and the fruit of
[1:29:24] righteousness is sown in peace of then
[1:29:27] that make peace amen so this is sown in
[1:29:34] peace so it's planted in peace so you've
[1:29:36] got to take see you got to take God's
[1:29:38] Word in your heart when you're
[1:29:40] meditating when you're calm right when
[1:29:43] you're just you're just gonna be I'm
[1:29:44] just gonna be here for a while Lord just
[1:29:46] plant something in my heart amen it's
[1:29:49] planted in peace of them that make peace
[1:29:54] now let me see how much I mean I gotta
[1:29:57] stop here in just a moment but let me
[1:29:58] see where a good place to stop would be
[1:30:01] yeah let me I'll go a few more I'll just
[1:30:05] go a couple more here okay Daniel now
[1:30:08] you who members this then Daniel went in
[1:30:11] and desire to the king that they would
[1:30:12] give him the time and that he would show
[1:30:14] the king the interpretation now that
[1:30:15] time was just a few days in that case
[1:30:17] Daniel hazard and said blessed be the
[1:30:19] name of God for ever and ever for wisdom
[1:30:21] and my are his and he changes the times
[1:30:25] and the seasons he removeth kings and
[1:30:30] setteth up kings he giveth wisdom unto
[1:30:34] the wise and knowledge to them that no
[1:30:37] understanding I think we can all see
[1:30:41] with the last election that things were
[1:30:43] changing a little bit like we all saw in
[1:30:46] 2004 and 2008 with Barack Obama
[1:30:49] we all saw things changing and enough
[1:30:52] for the worse right
[1:30:55] because George W Bush and Bill Clinton
[1:30:57] all were on record saying marriage is
[1:30:59] between one man one woman and then the
[1:31:01] seasons changed
[1:31:03] and here comes Obama in the second term
[1:31:06] and now he says marriage can be between
[1:31:08] a man and a man a woman a woman they
[1:31:11] took a change of season because they're
[1:31:14] both on record they even had a special
[1:31:16] it's like a marriage Act I forget what
[1:31:18] it is but George W Bush signed it I
[1:31:19] remember it because that's what I was he
[1:31:22] was the first person I voted for so see
[1:31:25] it's but God is behind all of that God
[1:31:29] is changing that as well God's allowing
[1:31:32] it right in order to produce and fulfill
[1:31:34] prophecy amen
[1:31:35] because Jesus said as it was in the days
[1:31:37] of lot so shall be in the coming of the
[1:31:40] Son of Man so God's allowing that God's
[1:31:44] allowing these seasons and times to
[1:31:46] change he removes bush brings up Obama
[1:31:51] removes Obama sets up Trump who's next
[1:31:54] Sanders Trump again who knows oh I just
[1:32:00] pray for the best most godly person
[1:32:02] that's what I'm praying for
[1:32:03] get rid of abortion my goodness it's God
[1:32:08] changes these he gives wisdom the wise
[1:32:11] and knowledge him their understanding
[1:32:12] that's that's what Daniel says God is
[1:32:14] the one who changes these things and he
[1:32:17] changes the times and seasons yeah I
[1:32:21] think I read that one already yeah oh
[1:32:22] yeah had that twice that's strange okay
[1:32:25] now let's stay on our feet I'm gonna
[1:32:27] close with this did you know right after
[1:32:29] Jesus raised from the dead he was seen
[1:32:32] forty days one of the last questions his
[1:32:34] disciples asked us was about times and
[1:32:37] seasons so see Church of you if you're
[1:32:43] gonna be a Holy Ghost field saint or if
[1:32:44] you are one you're always interested in
[1:32:46] the times and seasons praise the Lord so
[1:32:51] I asked earlier who wants to know what
[1:32:52] times and seasons I hope your hands if
[1:32:54] your hands gonna be up I hope your heart
[1:32:55] was saying me me I want to know because
[1:32:59] the very imagine having just a few
[1:33:00] minutes with Christ what would he ask
[1:33:01] him here's what they asked him Lord wilt
[1:33:05] thou at this time restore the Kingdom of
[1:33:07] Israel is
[1:33:08] the time is this the time of the
[1:33:12] millennium in other words that they were
[1:33:13] and that's what they were asking because
[1:33:14] the millennium Jerusalem's the center
[1:33:16] again right but man said they'll build a
[1:33:18] temple in Jerusalem before the heavenly
[1:33:21] one comes a thousand years later right
[1:33:24] so see this is what they're wondering
[1:33:27] this is what the soon-to-be they weren't
[1:33:28] Holy Ghost feel yet but these soon-to-be
[1:33:30] Holy Ghost filled believers were
[1:33:32] wondering when is this millennium gonna
[1:33:34] set in when will the kingdom of Christ
[1:33:36] come and Israel be restored to her glory
[1:33:41] that's what you and I asked Lord when is
[1:33:43] the rapture coming when is this
[1:33:47] when is this millennium gonna send it
[1:33:48] Lord I'm so tired I just want I love the
[1:33:51] earth but I want to live on this earth
[1:33:52] when there's no more world systems when
[1:33:54] it's Christ's system amen
[1:33:56] when it's the day of the Lord not the
[1:33:58] day a man the day of the Lord or when is
[1:34:01] it your coming that's what we ask - so
[1:34:07] one of the last questions is this is
[1:34:08] this the time when is the time and think
[1:34:12] about it often do you pray that Lord is
[1:34:13] this the time to do healing is this the
[1:34:15] time to save a soul is this a time for
[1:34:17] revival don't we pray that all the time
[1:34:19] see Christians are concerned with the
[1:34:22] time because we want to make the right
[1:34:23] use of God's time and we don't want to
[1:34:26] miss God's timing and he said to them
[1:34:33] it's not for you it's not for you to
[1:34:38] know the times and seasons which the
[1:34:41] father has put in his own power is that
[1:34:46] just like God sometimes I'll answer give
[1:34:49] you the answer other times no how many
[1:34:53] times have you prayed something with
[1:34:54] with all sincerity you might have fast
[1:34:56] and you might have prayed you might have
[1:34:58] not ate in that day or a day days on end
[1:35:01] but the answer still comes back not
[1:35:04] right now
[1:35:05] not now so did they get up upset with
[1:35:10] Jesus and leave the church no did they
[1:35:13] kick dust autumn and see why can't you
[1:35:15] tell me of course not
[1:35:17] well can you do when you love Jesus what
[1:35:20] can you do just say okay all right just
[1:35:23] say Amen so beat Jesus said it is not
[1:35:27] for you to know the times or the seasons
[1:35:29] which the father has put in his own
[1:35:32] power but ye shall receive power he said
[1:35:35] but let me tell you about power not for
[1:35:40] you to know the times and see the
[1:35:42] millennium we're just getting into the
[1:35:43] feast of weeks we're just getting the
[1:35:45] Pentecost I don't know yeah you're a
[1:35:48] little ahead of the seasons amen let me
[1:35:51] tell you what season you're in god help
[1:35:55] us to see that season be a season of
[1:35:58] power
[1:35:58] Holy Ghost power amen glory and you'll
[1:36:03] be a witness then you'll be a witness in
[1:36:05] Akron glory you'll be witnessing copley
[1:36:07] you'll be witness in Akron unto the
[1:36:09] uttermost parts of the earth amen
[1:36:14] so Jesus knew it wouldn't be best for
[1:36:16] them to know it's better that you don't
[1:36:20] know when the millennium is gonna happen
[1:36:23] I'm gonna save that to where my prophet
[1:36:26] preaches the future home thank you lord
[1:36:36] I'm gonna save that for about 2,000
[1:36:38] years later when that seventh angel he
[1:36:40] finishes the mystery of God not for use
[1:36:50] for them down the road and Laodicea
[1:36:51] praise the Lord thank you Lord amen
[1:36:58] he said I believe with all of my heart
[1:37:00] were living in the last days I there's
[1:37:03] not too much would break this now look
[1:37:06] how humble program is and my reputation
[1:37:08] may be wrong of the scripture that Jesus
[1:37:11] could not come tonight I believe that
[1:37:13] that little I believe that what little
[1:37:15] is left to be fulfilled could be
[1:37:17] fulfilled before daylight in the morning
[1:37:19] and I'd see and I may be wrong there the
[1:37:22] time without fulfilling but it's at hand
[1:37:24] I believe that and
[1:37:25] or Paul believed that John believed that
[1:37:27] Pollock are believed that Iranians
[1:37:28] believe that Martin believed that all
[1:37:30] the rest of them believe it so in other
[1:37:32] words every Holy Ghost filled Christian
[1:37:34] thought that Jesus was going to come in
[1:37:35] their lifetime every one of them oh it's
[1:37:40] got to be today it's got to be not the
[1:37:43] days of lot you know remember Martin
[1:37:46] Luther spoke out against homosexuality
[1:37:47] in his day it was it was going on in
[1:37:49] that day he could have said my it's just
[1:37:52] like lot Lots day all this homosexuality
[1:37:55] see but everyone believed it was their
[1:37:58] day program tells us why God does that
[1:38:04] what if God were two children told John
[1:38:07] the Revelator now it's going to be two
[1:38:09] thousand years before my coming John
[1:38:14] would have come back
[1:38:15] told the church now he would have left
[1:38:16] so happy to talk to Jesus that he would
[1:38:18] have come back like this brother man
[1:38:20] said well guess we might as well eat and
[1:38:25] drink and be merry
[1:38:26] because there ain't gonna be because
[1:38:29] there's gonna be lots of generations
[1:38:33] Jesus isn't coming back for 2,000 years
[1:38:37] see so see the church would be loose not
[1:38:43] walking circumspectly not accurately
[1:38:46] walking according to the commands of God
[1:38:50] there would have been no on the mark
[1:38:52] make sure my life is right with God I've
[1:38:55] got all this sin out of my life that's
[1:38:58] what Jesus wants us to do and after all
[1:39:03] it's your anticipations if you fall
[1:39:05] asleep in the watch that you wake up
[1:39:07] with some God want you to wake up with
[1:39:09] the same anticipation so see whatever
[1:39:12] your character is whatever your
[1:39:13] character is that's what you're taking
[1:39:14] with you well part of your character is
[1:39:16] your anticipation for Christ's coming
[1:39:19] because mother ham says if you die with
[1:39:22] that anticipation you'll raise with it
[1:39:26] yes because it ain't gonna hinder one
[1:39:29] thing you're gonna be right there and
[1:39:31] time anyhow see what I mean when Saint
[1:39:33] Maarten awakes in the resurrection st.
[1:39:35] Paul all the rest of them it'll be just
[1:39:37] as fresh as if they were right in the
[1:39:40] back that's right Church battling right
[1:39:45] away because they went down under those
[1:39:48] same anticipations I've fought a good
[1:39:50] fight I'm fighting against Rome Paul
[1:39:52] could say I'm fighting against all this
[1:39:54] evil and the mystery of iniquity I'm
[1:39:56] fighting against all this he went down
[1:39:58] that way and so he'll raise up that same
[1:40:01] way amen
[1:40:02] hallelujah he said they went now with
[1:40:06] their same anticipations looking for his
[1:40:09] coming
[1:40:09] they'll come a scream come up higher a
[1:40:12] bride and up will come the whole church
[1:40:16] you see so see it doesn't matter let's
[1:40:20] get the Lord Rama vows amen it doesn't
[1:40:23] matter the time in season
[1:40:26] Laurey it doesn't matter Malik I'm a man
[1:40:31] once you come and you have a song but
[1:40:32] let me know if not I could think of one
[1:40:35] here I had one on my heart but how many
[1:40:38] appreciate God's Word today the very
[1:40:41] last thing they asked Jesus in flesh one
[1:40:45] of the times and seasons what is this
[1:40:46] millennium gonna roll in and you said
