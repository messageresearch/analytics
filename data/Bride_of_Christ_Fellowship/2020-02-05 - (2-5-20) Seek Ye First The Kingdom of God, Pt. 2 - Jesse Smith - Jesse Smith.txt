revelation 3:20 let's read that together on 3s the Lord to write it on our hearts the flesh and tables of our hearts 1 2 3 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me praise the Lord let's read one more text here for our subject tonight Matthew chapter 6 let's go back there Matthew chapter 6 I'd like to kind of go back to the New Year's Eve topic of seek ye first the kingdom of God I want to preach maybe one more message on that this week I've been awful busy at work there's been a lot of grading and a lot of work to do there so I haven't had as much time to get into the approve all things topics but Lord willing next Wednesday maybe or the Sunday after we'll be able to get through back to that Matthew chapter 6 verse 33 Matthew 6:33 praise God let's read verse 33 together on three one two three but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you praise God they God has blessed in rivas work you may be seated praise God God's grace would like to look at this thought on seek you first the kingdom of God and hope is it on okay so that means the batteries are out so forgive me let me switch the batteries real quick good we in the House of Lords night with all the Saints praise done right now should be on now okay thank you Thank You faithful Jaden oh he's good at correcting in there and getting me on that getting a receiver on so let's look at C key first part two I wanna you know I never really dealt into the Greek meanings here so I want to kind of look at this and then tie in some other thoughts about seeking God first and just kind of one I'll put them together here tonight if I can by God's grace I like to try to do that so I have five I have five views on my Billy Paul Joseph video I only gave it out to three people so you know to Jose Jose want to watch it I give out to Billy Paul and Joseph Brennan and voice of God so haven't heard back from anybody yet but I imagine I sent the letters on Saturday so Saturday Saturday Monday Tuesday Wednesday so I'm sure they arrived by now I sent paper letters as well so hopefully there'll be a blessing and help to our brothers and the whole movement over there if not I did my part that's why I preach it so hard the way I do cuz I believe it's right and if I was wrong oh and I say on the video please correct me if I'm wrong cuz I want to be corrected but RAM said I always have time to be corrected so that's how we want to have that same attitude you want to be corrected if if we're wrong by the grace of the Lord now let's look here let's stay in Matthew 6 and we'll look to the scriptures here to guide us here I want to begin back at verse 25 Matthew 6:25 to kind of get the context of this again very familiar maybe to us but in 25 Jesus starts speaking about natural needs and so I want to look at that look at the natural needs and I'm just looking up real quick there's one - there's only three times in chapter 6 Jesus says the word kingdom so I want to just get to that in just a moment but in verse 25 jesus begins dealing with anxieties we go through as humans right these are anxieties and Jesus is telling us to trust in the father's care right we are going to suffer anxieties and human-human times of questioning and uncertainty but Jesus is telling us the cure there is a definite cure from having anxiety and Jesus tells us it right here because verse 25 he said therefore I saying to you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what ye shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body than raiment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth them are you not much better than they which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature so who is ever worried about these things and ever got that got what they needed Jesus said nobody's ever done that you cannot add anything to yourself and why taking thought for the raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you O ye of little faith therefore take no Thought saying what shall we eat what shall we drink or wherewithal we be clothed now he keeps naming these same three food drink and clothing he's naming those three over and over again food liquid water right and then clothing and he he starts dealing now he says why and then in verse 31 why do you why take no thought don't worry so much about these verse 32 for all these things for after all these things do the Gentiles seek so we should be able to look at any sinner who doesn't know Jesus Christ a Gentile and we can see their lives are gonna focus on those three things right food drink and clothing that's there we're gonna be their main focus now behind all that of course to get those things that need money so behind all that many times is seeking after money and it's not sin to have money it's just sin to love money right there's a lot of money is the root of all evil so we look at sinners and we see that many times seeking after these natural things he says for your heavenly Father knoweth that you have need of all these things now in our MRR in armed immature prayers you know we made we may utter something like this like Lord don't you know I need this have you ever ever uttered that immature prayer Lord do you no good like like no you know David did many times right and another ones too but you know they have an excuse they couldn't get the Holy Ghost if we got the Holy Ghost we should be solid praise God right but but there's times you know when we we may pray with sin in maturity or maybe so we're in a moment of battle of the trial moment of weakness and we Lord don't you know what I'm going through it and of course the Heavenly Father knows what we're going through if anybody knows jesus knows amen for you is tempted in all points like as we are tempted but Jesus tells us here your father knows that all these things that you need so the cure for anxiety is in the next verse the one of our text and it is to trust in the father's care by seeking the kingdom of God first he says but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you so Jesus says there's one cure for every anxiety and that is seek God and seek to obtain his righteousness if we seek God and we partake of his righteousness then Jesus says everything else will be added to you and we should have Saints here today that say Amen I'm a witness that's right hallelujah verse 34 take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof so our thoughts should not even be worrying so much about tomorrow right seeking tomorrow's food tomorrow's water tomorrow's clothes our mind should not be so much on seeking those until first we've sought God for His righteousness so that's the that's the cure for any anxiety or or any troubling in our lives is we have to first seek God's kingdom and then his righteousness and then he promised I'll take care of everything else if you can just focus on my kingdom focus on receiving from me I'll take care of everything else that seemed like a wonderful deal to you Church you just he said you just focus on one thing and I'll take care of everything else amen what a deal praise God what a great meal amen you take care of the one I'll take care of the three praise God because again he can't force anybody to be safe he can't force anybody to come after him we know we did not seek him he sought us first praise God we know that but yet with our free more agency I keep coming back to this in my studies with the three more agencies giving us the freedom to choose and we must take advantage of that freedom he said seek ye first the kingdom of God now this is a beautiful scripture now I want to bring in here earlier in the chapter so if you go back to verse 1 Matthew 6:1 Jesus is continuing the Sermon on the Mount where he is being being the lawgiver right he is the anti-type of moses moses i'm just read last week Moses went up to the mountain he was in the face of God he came down his face was so bright right he brings a new law he asked the veil his face to talk to his brethren he can't even talk to his brothers unless he bails his speech but once he leaves his brothers he can take the veil off he could go back up to God and be in God's presence amen and then when he first brought the law down Joshua was like I hear the noise but it's it's not the sound of worship it's not the sound of war and Lois is like that's the sound of demon worship you know that's the sound of idolatry right that's a sound of parties and laughter and drunkenness and whatever Ravalli it would be and so we get so mad he throws down the stones right he throws down the stones and showing that the laws broken before they can even get it praise God humanity breaks the law before they can even receive it under the Old Testament without a change of heart there's no need for the law right but what we need is a changed heart ain't it and then we got a new heart then God can write the law upon our hearts amen and once the laws on our hearts we don't need the the stone law so much we don't know we thank God for the paper love it but it's not so much about the paper law as it is about the law of the spirit that guides us every day praise God thank the Lord and so that's what we were seeing in Moses he was a type of the true lawgiver who was going to come down and yet find us in idolatry but he wasn't going to get upset he was to give us mercy because Jesus was full of grace and truth they met he was full of grace Moses thought so much she wasn't full of grace like Christ was but Christ was full of grace while we were yet sinners he died Christ for the righteous right the righteous for the unrighteous amen and so Jesus is the anti-type he comes not just out of the Friends of God he comes out of the throne of God amen amen he's then come out of you know mouths I'm out sign that he came out of heaven praise God amen he left it let this heavenly throne praise God and church huh me know Jesus was veiled from the presence of God just as Moses had to be veiled Jesus was veiled what was it the logos the Holy Spirit was veiled behind human flesh hallelujah amen ha ha thank the Lord and so he comes down bringing the real law we've seen a few weeks ago with brother Troy even preach on it and I preach on it where Jesus cries eyes that anyone who's thirsty come and then a drink of the waters of life there is the lawgiver offering the Word of God the law to report into the hearts of hungry and thirsty souls that's our gracious Lord hallelujah and I'm outside a gives us the Beatitudes and then he tells us we're salt of the earth light of the earth we're cities let your light shine and then Jesus gives a new law and verse 17 a new relation to the law in chapter 6 I'm sorry chapter 5 rather and then he gives new light on marriage and divorce right greater revelation in chapter 5 31 and how to deal with men in later verses and then he closes chapter 5 by saying be thee therefore perfect even as your father which in heaven is perfect praise God so if Jesus has programs in the Hebrew series if Jesus asks us to be perfect he's got to make a way for us to be perfect and member that's what Paul wrote in Ephesians he said I wish that all the Saints could comprehend the height and the depth and the breadth and the length of God's love amen Oh leaving just kind of catch a glint of that tonight how much God really loves us amen oh my that was Paul's great riding there to the Gentiles and Ephesus if you could just comprehend with the Saints the depths of God's love and Paul said who could separate us from the love of Christ amen so see we're perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ were forgiven and made perfect right like we know a job how in and in heaven job was perfect by the blood but on earth he still he still fell short but God looked at him as a perfect man praise God God looked at him as a servant right Moses lied twice you know he lied to the two kings he lied about Abraham's Arab sorry Sarah not meanness his wife and yet God had the kings as for forgiveness because God saw Abraham in his finished condition in his perfect condition praise God as a father of faith amen God saw the condition of Abraham as he would be willing to sacrifice even his son Isaac in order to honor God and God considered him righteous even before he did that because God looks at us as our finished condition amen oh yes the love of God God's love considers us perfect and then Chapter six now he begins with alms which are private gifts of charity to people he tells us we should give alms and then he get breaks in the prayer and verse 5 when you pray don't be as the hypocrites that love to stand the synagogues he tells us how to pray go in the closet seek the Lord you're not heard by the number of words that you pray and then in verse eight he breaks into teaching us how to pray and this is where he mentions the kingdom in the chapter so we often remember you know Matthew 6:33 seek ye first the kingdom of God but Jesus actually mentioned the kingdom earlier in the chapter praise God and he tells us to pray for the kingdom so let's read at Matthew 6 verse 9 after this manner therefore pray ye our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as it is in heaven hallelujah give us this day our daily bread forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil in other words lead us not into a joke type of situation but deliver us from that evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen so notice jesus' prayer about the kingdom we are to pray let the kingdom of God come that's what we just saying about that lift Oh gates see the kingdom it is here now let it come now praise God let the kingdom come now that's what he says let your kingdom come and then he says as we pray for thine is the kingdom it's your kingdom we're just playing a part in the kingdom program to just humbles himself and says I'm just one little pebble on the beach of the kingdom right if the kingdom is a beach he said he's a little pebble now I think he's bigger than just a little pebble but the point is that we're all playing a part in God's kingdom so those three times in the one chapter Jesus mentions the kingdom of God we're to pray for it now you probably remember this hopefully maybe Kingdom means Dominion or rule so he said let your Dominion come let your rule come right so we're to pray let your rule come we're the praying that God let your rule dominate our lives can say like that let your rules let your spirit dominate our lives and let it not just stop with our lives then it spread to others lives now this is quite a this is a two-fold statement I believe I'm sorry two-fold application because he says let us seek you first the kingdom of God now you're supposed to seek the kingdom the rule of God right in your old life but also in the lives of others this has to be an inward seeking for God to rule more of your life because Luke 17:21 says the behold the kingdom of God is within you so he says seek ye first the kingdom the Dominion of God and Jesus says the Dominion of God is inside of you so we're all pressured to get the food the drink and the clothes and Jesus says don't seek that so much he said seek to be ruled by my Holy Spirit and if you let yourself be ruled if you constantly get your eyes on Lord take more rulership of my life help me to submit to you and by doing that he said if you just take care of that and let my kingdom come into your life I'll take care of the natural things you just take care of the spiritual kingdom you be concerned about the rules the Holy Spirit in your life and your family in your church and they'll take care of all the natural things that's the promise of God that's just as that's just a bunch of promise as John 3:16 hey Lord how many like John 3:16 Laurie it's just a bunch of promise as acts 2:38 hallelujah very man if we seek the rule of the Holy Spirit Jesus will add every natural thing that we need now let me go back to the word seek this is a beautiful word on this way I want to read the Greek to it like I said I want to spend a few minutes on the Greek here tonight by God's grace the word seek is zto now has a different Hebrew pronunciation I'm no Hebrew scholar but it means to seek for to aim at aim you know I had a everybody had to aim today right I had to aim at work I had to get the reading test grade that was my kind of aim I had to teach a little lesson on math had to do teach a little riding lesson I how to aim right and everything all these all the arguing going around all the upset children at each other and all the water spilling and all that was distracting from my aim right and I had to battle to keep that aim right that's I'm seeking I was seeking to accomplish all these things gotta help that guy he missed a spelling test last week she missed the reading test I gotta aim I all these aims aiming for all that to get all that done but there's so many other things that could distract from that and so even today at work you so think about your day what was your aim put on the table right get to school done and get at the hair comb and get the hair brush and everything there's all these aims to get it to get everything accomplished which is good we ought to do all that but the word seek here for the kingdom of God means that aim for to strive after to require demand and Octus word to crave to crave or desire so in other words Jesus saying aim first for my kingdom let that be your first aim the first one I look you got other aims right later for Brett gotta aim for breakfast you gotta aim for lunch you gotta aim for supper gotta aim for Wednesday night Church but the first aim of the day praise god no first I must be the kingdom the rule of God's Lord amen crave the first craving of the day or the first striving the thing you're gonna first try to strive to get is for the kingdom of God Jesus saying crave my kingdom praise God now where does the craving come from memmer brother Han tells us he brother Adam tells us you and I live in the control tower right I'm sorry in the in the mine we live in our minds right with it right here this our consciousness right our human spirit this is where we most often live everyone else that we live in the mind but we get we get desires from our body right you get desires waves messages from your body I'm thirsty thirsty give me water give me coca-cola got ignore that one oh you gotta gotta feed me I'm hungry you get all these messages from the flesh so we're here right in the middle our consciousness is in the middle okay I got messages from my flesh I need to feed it I need to do this I need to get at the red I can get it to sleep get some aspirin I get some get some medicine you have all these messages from your flesh but also church my man says you got you got a messages from your soul praise God amen so my man said you got desires from your flesh and you got desires from your soul but your mind is here in the middle your human spirit and you've got the meat you got to respond to both the needs I hope that helps you by God's grace jesus said seek ye first now where does the seeking come from the seeking must start in the mind it starts in the mind that's why the Bible said transform the renewing of my you be transformed by the renewing of your mind and that's why the Bible the first bet the first part of the armor is the belt the belt of truth right so we got to get our thoughts as soon as we get up we got to get our thoughts focus on the truth and get ready for battle right even if we're tired and don't feel like it if not Church you're gonna lose the battle and the church said if you don't give that mind settled on truth right away you are gonna get whipped in the battle Satan knows that he's right is he evil demons watch us do we get up right away and we get ready for battle through getting our mind right and that looks different for me as far as like my wife my wife has to get up with the children so her getting her mind right looks different than me I'm all alone I don't have children crawling all over me like my wife does you know in the mornings which is all happy things you know most of time but you know my alarm goes off at 5:00 and 5:30 or 6:00 whenever I sleep in you huh uh and I'm just all by myself but I've still got to make the decision in my mind to set it on truth I got to get it ready for truth to decide what's true to do the true thing do what's right and then I've got messages from my body saying I'm thirsty and thirsty thirsty or I'm hungry or whatever I've got messages there and I've got messages from the soul that's saying I'm longing for fellowship amen hallelujah the soul is craving fellowship with God is because their soul is your nature but in your mind right we got the decision do we got it take care of the flesh go take care of the kids I got to do all that - I give sunny toast to Victoria in the morning you know got to do that if I can and that but my soul is crying out and so is yours your soul is crying out for God now you seek he said seek first the kingdom of God now that means the amen and let me just say like this you know for me that's very simple for me the aim is I used to get the drinks you don't get they go right to read and write or write to prayer prayers the first thing I do now for moms it'll be different for moms right especially if you got children and you guys if everybody gets up at the same time right they the children get up at the same time the aim then is if they're all around us right the aims of mom is to meet their needs with the aim that you're gonna manifest God's love to them and eventually get the family Bible time right aim to get to the scripture or your family prayer life for my mom that's what it was she would come around and spray us you know to wake us up with water or vinegar you know she'd spray us up as teenagers and the whole thing was to get us to the door so we could gather on the door and pray before we all ran off to high school you know that was the thing that was our morning seeking God first day it helped in just one prayer we didn't read the Bible we just prayed and it was such a blessing upon my life it laid such a foundation in my life well that's the best my mom could do as a single mom you know and so a little it looks different you know for moms and dads and but this the aim is the same the aim is that the rule of the Holy Spirit will will have preeminence in our home it's the same for everybody so however it looks you know it may it may vary in how it looks but the aim and the striving for has to be the same well pointing to that let's say you have a late morning there's there's I've had mornings where I got up too late and I couldn't read the Bible pray well my aim then for rest today was once I get a free moment at lunch I'm just gonna skip lunch I'm gonna read my Bible and pray uh after work I'll get home out and have some study time and pray my aim will see so we're clearly aiming for we're aiming for fellowship with God but Jesus tells us if we can if we can use wisdom first seek the kingdom of God the rule of God seek that aim for that and that's that's how we interact with our children that's how I treat my children when they come in usually Victoria's the first in the morning right coming to my office she's rubbing her eyes now I know I got to take her right to the restroom and then take her up and get some food and I kind of know the routine now but my desire my ain't asked me to love her and be patient with her because there's some been some mornings I don't feel like I'm tired I don't feel like helping her out too much that's not a good aim Lord forgive me for that I don't want that kind of aim but the aim should be to manifest Christ's love right to let that rule my life so seeking aiming for first the rule of the Holy Spirit so mothers that's how to look for the moms I look for the dads to look that way in the morning because it's got to be first not last right you didn't say seek last he said seek first so our minds as we wake up should be first set we should be sure to aim them at manifesting obedience to the Word of God just to put it simple live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God that sounds sensible tonight that sounds everybody agree with that does that sound sensible that's our first he said seek first rather than just being worried about the food and and the water and the cereal and whatever and then clothes and which we all need that Jesus said first seek the kingdom the rule of the Holy Spirit and everything else will be added unto you now with sisters many times to it it's for dads too but we're sisters with children especially you know in our church we have you know mothers with young children there there there's walk with God will be constant prayer in their hearts now it should be dads too so like you know for like you know my wife she don't have time to go in the prayer closet like I do so she reads on her Bible on her bed and has her time with the Lord there on the bed and I'm sure maybe other places too sometimes at the breakfast table so the thing is the Bible says pray without ceasing so we take that aim where we're striving for that we're striving for that fellowship with God and as we go through about our day we're constantly praying asking God for help asking God for wisdom asking God for race to guide every event of the day that's our first aim is to let the kingdom of God rule our lives now I found it's not the kingdom of God rule in my life if I wake up and spend 30 minutes on Facebook that's not the rule of God and I've been guilty of that a couple times I've God to forgive me so I show off my phone at night now and I just use my watch to wake up I've been guilty because I'm tired I don't feel like reading the Bible I don't feel like praying and I'm just tired I'm lazy and it's a and it's a thing I repent for I'm say I'm sorry that's not aiming for the kingdom of God and we're all guilty at times I imagine but the idea is to say Lord change my heart let me be stronger next time search me know my heart know my ways right and empower me to be stronger next time and I've had that experience too thank God God gives us grace to overcome so see where does this seeking come from it comes from well it starts in the mind and then it's got a yield over it say all the truth is I've got a surrender I've got to seek God first and I've got to feed the soul man and so by doing that then we where we let the desires of the soul rule the rest of the morning or the day right the rest of the morning that's what the Bible says I read this to you at one time I don't think I've read it much since a case you can you put up Isaiah 26 say I've only read it one time I think I was on new years not gonna read it again just to kind of look at the scripture again see because you have desires in your flesh we all understand those we have this but we also have desires in our soul but it's the mind that has to cast down any imagination that exalts itself against the Word of God and we've got to meet the desires of the soul so Isaiah 26 verse 8 says yay in the way of thy judgments O Lord have we waited for thee the desire of our soul is to thy name and to the remembrance of thee so where's the desire come from the soul you've got to meet the flesh desires and the soul desires but what does it the mind the mind verse 9 with my soul have I desired the in the night what brought you to church the desire of your soul hey I think I didn't my physical body didn't feel like coming I got a headache I'm tired I just feel like I maybe I didn't get enough sleep this week my flesh didn't feel like coming but my sole desire fellowship with God my soul desires to worship and sing and praise God and lift my hands and exalt his name and to intercede for sinners praise God and to pray for the sick my soul desires that but I've got to choose to let the desires of my soul be met and so do you you've got to seek that first gotta seek to meet the desires of the soul first alright now the reason many don't seek God first is because their souls not right with God so either they're not born again or they're not even saved right the only way someone would not seek God with their soul is if they're not born again or they're not even saved in most cases jesus said a few there be that find the kingdom in most cases most church members aren't born again I'm talking about over worldwide right and so they're not born again so their soul doesn't desire God on Wednesday night or Sunday night you see what I'm saying or Friday night we have Friday night service their souls don't desire that they'd rather do something else they just rather do that because their soul is not being fed they starve this soul and their mind they're choosing are the needs of the flesh they're aiming at the flesh rather than aiming at the soul praise God but church all's we got to do we make a mistake all the others say Lord I'm sorry forgive me create in me a clean heart amen and renew a right spirit in my mind because I chose I may have chosen the wrong a desire may have chosen as of hours of the flesh the food the money so that you have money though the water and the clothes but Lord I'm asking you to change my mind that I'll choose the desire of the soul to have fellowship with God I hope it's making sense tonight by God's grace Jesus says aim first for my Dominion and we meet we know that means the soul right because I want to make a point here Church you and I can all look at we say like this foolish virgins now I say that a nice way I'm not saying that mean way but some of them have more devoted seeking than maybe we do right like let's look at a cat let's look at a real sincere Catholic priest okay the Catholic priest is not married doesn't have children running around but yeah they get up in the morning and they memorize the Greek and the Hebrew the Latin they were they memorize the Latin prayers right of saints dead Saints that they're gonna pray to later that day they got up early and they're seeking something right but it's not the Word of the hour right it's not if it's seeking maybe prayers to Mary they're saying Hail Marys so they have their devotion down but they're not seeking the real kingdom of God there it is Amen that's right how do they view looks like this they're seeking the Catholic Kingdom or the Baptist kingdom rather than the holy ghost kingdom amen never understand and they might put us to shame even in seeking God and I hope not too much I hope we're dedicated to God but the point is what I want to make is that that separates the wise version from the the foolish virgin the foolish version is not seeking the true baptism of the Holy Ghost they're seeking an organization or they're seeking to win their argument or they're seeking another the church to get more money their motivation is on this the word and living a righteous life and living all the Word of God but that should be our desire is to manifest all the Word of God that separates us because you know what you know why some of those Catholic priests do that and those Baptist ministers know why they do that because if they don't they're not going to get their food right they're gonna lose their paychecks they're not getting their food their water their clothes because their denomination is gonna keep them out they're gonna boot about the door oh you're not gonna preach our Creed see yeah so see a lot of their sinking is really seeking based upon creed and organization and financial pressure rather than seeking the true kingdom of God Church let me ask you is there going to be one abomination in God's kingdom no well then then why do Catholics allow homosexuals to come to their churches why did why are Baptists and Lutheran's the presbytery why are they allowing it it's a proof that they're not seeking the real kingdom of God amen hallelujah see when we are seeking the kingdom of God we're seeking the real rule and Dominion of the kingdom of God God's rule of his will of his word of the true Bible apostolic truth amen that's the kingdom we're believing in that's the kingdom we're seeking hallelujah thank the Lord so see ultimately those type of false or we'd say not false but I'll see like churches without the real baptism holy ghost they're not really dominated by the kingdom of God but it's dominated by actually their natural food drink and clothes because they're doing it for a paycheck many of them not all many of them so jesus said aim to be dominated by the spiritual things he said Christ righteousness in your soul aim to be dominated by that praise God now he seek ye first the kingdom and his righteousness don't forget that and right what is righteousness church it means this integrity virtue purity of life rightness correctness of thinking feeling and acting praise God so seek first my kingdom my Dominion my rule and his righteousness his integrity his virtue his purity amen how many more virtue in their life how he needs more power to you that's right how many more purity in their lives amen this is what Jesus say seek my rule my kingdom and my righteousness see so everyday Church we have to wake up no matter where we're at in life and say Lord I need more purity I need more virtue he said I did he said I need more correct thinking amen I need more correct actions and I'm seeking it praise God I'm aiming for that that's my goal for the day not to watch reruns on Disney Plus or Netflix you know that's not my aim for the day my aim for the day is to be more pure to seek the rule of the kingdom of God and the integrity of Christ's righteousness now for me that looks like I go my prayer cause I ask God to forgive my sins and I worship Him I love him I praise Him ask him to make me a pure heart give me the word for your people for tonight was when I was praying this morning Lord you know I needed help me I'm nothing you know I try to I try to seek His righteousness and as I studied that the word try to let it open itself up that I can see it and then I can try to present it to you praise God that's how it looks like to me so see we first our first aim is to strive to be in early ruled by the integrity and purity and virtue of Jesus Christ he says get that first if you can first get that the Dominion or rule of my spirit and my integrity and my purity I'll add all your other physical needs just aim for that that's your first aim now it's not your second it's our first aim praise God praise the Lord thank you Jesus and this is called as you know giving God preeminence cautions 1:18 that in all things he might have the preeminence praise God let me cross off what I got here so we pray for the kingdom could pray without ceasing for the kingdom we saw how wise versus foolish I want to go bit deeper here now remember there's only two kinds of Christian let's go a little bit deeper on the wise and foolish virgins the Bible says in proverbs 4 7 but you Paul an application proverbs 4 7 wisdom is the principal thing therefore get wisdom with all thy getting get wit get understanding that's proverbs 4 7 so Solomon says the main thing to do is get the wisdom of God right which wisdom is defined as let me pull it up here where did I put it oh yeah there is skillful or shrewdness so the main thing to get is the ability to make the right decision at the right time Amen hallelujah Southern said get that get the ability or cuz I say like this get the leading of the Holy Spirit to make the right choice amen and housing his secret every day seek him first I love that coal program did he said seek God first pray every day before you make a decision say father shall I do this I got I got the paper hanging there in my office I'm sure the children have seen it voice of God sent it out years ago I love that quote he said God may not speak of audible voice but he'll answer you somehow praise God like even the last time I bought that car a couple weeks ago intro is here I just prayed Lord just work it out you know I don't know so his flight was delayed three hours and that allowed me to go get the car and during that three hours he got time to study and preach the message on Saturday night I just worked I was worried I was trying to but you know I'm trying to worry figure out how this is gonna work out I didn't even worry about it anymore I just went prayed about in the morning I said Lord you allow it work work it out by God's grace I want to be in service night I want to worship you but I got this business I got to take care of and it proved to me again that if I see God first everything else should be added unto me just in a simple way like that a simple way of before the day I've got all this house is gonna work out my main thing is to seek God first God give me the purity now out of it okay not in the car I would have been ok I would have been but you know the Lord no I wanted to I want to get these things done these business deals and everything I want to pick him up on time I don't wanna be late everything just worked out and I found that in my life I got to put the first things first put God first seek his kingdom his purity first and then everything else falls right into place like a Tetris puzzle praise God hey amen wisdom is the principal thing making the the right decision at the right time that's the most important thing that's what Solomon says and the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom we know that now Paul's the one that said redeem the time you said it twice and this is our wise and foolish version text in Ephesians 5:14 wherefore he saith awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead in Christ shall give thee light verse 15 see them that you walk circumspectly remember that means exactly not as fool's but as wise redeem at the time because the days are evil wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is Paul says it again well Colossians 4:5 please occasionally now here Paul says you need to be wise among sinners look what he says here in Colossians 4:5 so you need to be able to make wise choices among sinners whether it's family members friends co-workers fellow students walk in wisdom skillfulness toward them that are without redeeming the time so make use of the time when you're around sinners right yeah let you look at verse 6 let your speech be always with grace seasoned with salt that you may know how you ought to answer every man so obviously it's very important thing about our time is how we handle our conversations because he says let your speech have grace in it we shouldn't be condemning everybody although in our hearts we know what's going to happen to people that break the word we know what's going to happen but we shouldn't be condemning them right away we should be showing grace to people to all of your time and my time is precious Paul says the wise walk exactly they know exactly what they're gonna do throughout the day by the leadership of the Holy Spirit I'm not saying every little thing but I'm saying seeking God my first aim is to seek God that's that's how I'm gonna walk each day so wise Christians daily seek God's kingdom first that inward ruling power of the Holy Spirit and wise Christians start their days seeking furnishings won't make the best use of their time they'll seek natural needs first before seeking spiritual needs of Jesus's kingdom they're gonna seek you know the kingdom of their their company rather than kingdom of God first right they're gonna seek the kingdom of best buy or whatever company they worked for or the kingdom of the government they're gonna seek those kingdoms first before seeking the kingdom of Christ that's right I believe that so see when we and I want to get to this seeking God in the morning now when you seek God in the morning it keeps your soul aimed at Christ and his kingdom because it just starts start your day the right way like remembered God told Cain if you don't do the right way sin lies at the door if you don't get your highlight if you don't get sins confess before you walk out that door you're gonna you're gonna suffer the consequences of not getting it right that's what God told Cain is gonna be right there at the door as you know if you don't make this right and worship the right way if you don't get your your if you don't see God's first amen if you don't put the right sacrifice there if you don't obey God's Word sins gonna be right there that's gonna torment you praise God it's gonna be right there at the door I'm gonna run in trouble right away we've got to put God's kingdom first so see getting up having a morning a morning time with the Lord morning fellowship keeps your soul right where it needs to be where your mind makes a choice I'm gonna seek God I'm gonna give this soul its desire I'm gonna feed that desire I'm gonna give that fellowship with God and that will have all my other desires met because I've been on both sides yeah I'm a morning person I like the morning but I there's been times where I here's what I found I'm either in a hurry I'm either in a hurry to do my Bible time and then go to work or I'm in a hurry to eat and then go to work so I always want to be in a hurry to eat so now in other words I'm gonna take care of my spiritual needs first and I want to give God more time so I'm kind of crunched for time getting dressed and combing my hair and shuffling down the orange and apple and yogurt or whatever I eat in the morning know what i mean i i'd rather give God my best time and then me rushing oh I better hurry but I got no I gotta go to work I rather be rushed for work than be rushed on God because I've had to deal with that over the years I've got to keep my soul aimed at Christ and his kingdom the purity of my heart strive to have integrity of Jesus Christ like there was a you know this week and I felt LED years ago I felt led to stand up at my door my classroom and before the kids come in I shake every one of their hands I get down say I say salutations how are you today I say packing her by and you know and we had a woman older woman visit our school and she saw me doing that I said come on and she says oh no I this this is she said this is outstanding and then the principal told me later she walked out of the school crying talking about me how I sit there and shake their hand because I learned years ago if you want to teach their mind you got to first contact their heart so the first thing all my fingers greet the teacher that's the first thing they do is they go I just I didn't even realize it so now I have an order of morning routine the first thing is greet the teacher that's like us we got to greet Jesus amen the first thing in the morning is great the Lord and tell you I love you Jesus amen but that really blessed me this week that woman she's an older woman but she walked out and she lot walked out crying because she never saw a teacher care so much about the kids to greet them at the door and just welcomed them to school and that's how we should be with the Lord every morning praise God we should seek God and say Lord good morning thank you for another night thanks for another arrest I'm here to seek you Lord and I thank you I want to be in your presence I don't love you teach me to walk in your Commandments that's a little testimony I had this week and I didn't you know I don't I do that every morning I don't put on you know I don't try to impress people I just do that every morning so wisdom and your morning routine your morning time with the Lord is your opportunity to seek the most important thing which is wisdom skillful decisions the right decision at the right time another word another way to say is the perfect will of God it gives you the chance to decide on the perfect will of God and church is redeeming the time for sure now go if you would now to Revelation 3:16 I'm gonna try to close here in about ten minutes er now here's what I want to say for our church and you know just Christians in general if we don't have that morning time which I know a lot of our friends say oh I mean friends like in the world oh I'm not a morning person or something like that yeah that's fine we might not have to be the morning person but once once we get up we have to aim at the kingdom of God I don't care if you're not a morning person or not where no matter what time we get up we got to start aiming at the kingdom of God we got to set our I got to set our arrow right on the the target of God's kingdom that's got to be our aim for the day no matter what time we get up see so in Revelation 3 the great road man said this is the greatest rebuke in the Bible you know he said that in the church age book he said this is the greatest rebuke in the Bible so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth NEX scripture here's why for 6:17 verse 17 because they'll say as I'm rich increased with Goods and right here don't need nothing they don't need anything they don't need to aim they don't have a need for the spiritual things of God they've got their natural if they've got their food water clothes they're rich increases they don't have need of nothing and they don't even know spiritually they're wretched miserable poor blind and naked leave that up there for a little bit Lydia leave it up there so the reason the reason I think many people that say they're Christians or maybe in the message or whatever the reason they don't seek God in the morning is because they're lukewarm because the lukewarm person says I don't really have a need to seek God I don't really need to aim at God I've got enough religion I get enough preaching do you if you did you'd want more there's God amen because it's seeking first the kingdom of God and His righteousness his purity his integrity and then everything else will be added unto you this is the reason many people don't seek God in the morning because they're lukewarm then their minds maybe they've just gotten such a bad habit that they can't even they can't even hear the soul is not they're not even listening to desires the soul saying give me fellowship with God give me pleasure but they they they quench that so many times that certainly they don't even hear anymore let's get up get their coffee or get their McDonald's and run to work I'll run to school right or run to Netflix or whatever they do right they can't even hear the soul and Jesus says if you don't have an EVE you're not meeting the needs of the kingdom then you're rich and in your wretched miserable I'm poor and don't even know it and then they can the mouthpiece of God no wonder they can't witness no wonder they can't lift anybody's spirits because their views them out they're no longer the mouthpiece of God they don't speak God's Word see they don't need it in other words they've quenched the voice of the desire of the soul they only hear the desires of the flesh you need this you need that get that get the coffee stop and get the Dunkin donut stopping at the bagel that's all they hear they don't hit that they stop listening to you they can't even hear the soul crying out for fellowship with God anymore and it's the greatest rebuke in the Bible my now church do you remember next verse I think you remember don't you it says but call me said and buy me gold what is gold time-tested faith Peter said your faith tested is more precious and gold so when we come to Christ we're asking for time-tested faith he said come get my white raiment which is Christ righteous character and the I saw that anoints the eyes that you can see the kingdom of God there it is Amen you can see it you're not blind but you see the kingdom of God but they need ice out because they can't see the kingdom of God they don't even know what it looks like for the Holy Ghost to rule your morning life or your whole day they don't even know what it looks like so which one are you and I associated with what is our church you know what we have to ask ourselves that question are we are we have the group that our first thing in the morning after you know regular things is seeking God aiming for the kingdom of God do we cut more real in our lives or are we seeking after natural things because it's only what Jesus said it's only one of the other he said the Gentiles are seeking the natural things but my servants in my kingdom they have to seek my kingdom first and I'm gonna here just a moment now Jesus promise if you seek him you'll find him Luke 11:10 says for every one that asked receives and he that seeks finds and to him that knocketh it shall be opened hallelujah jesus said many will seek but it'll be too late that's after the rapture they're gonna they're gonna seek and say open unto us may be seeking at the wrong time and Jesus said it's too late you did not redeem the time when you had the chance got some scratch in here as I mentioned on Sunday the whole Old Testament shows the type in shadow Aaron God told Aaron a morning sacrifice and an evening sacrifice Exodus 30 verse 7 says and Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning and when he dresses the lamps he shall burn incense upon it amen sweet fiery incense glory to God help us all amen sweet fiery prayers prayers from the heart Amen that are burning with desire god save my dad saved my mom I think that was my prayer Easter day God Lord do a miracle for Mark de Lucia we should have burning prayers coming up before God and it's it's foreshadowed in the Old Testament morning and evening David I'm sorry Daniel morning prayers noon prayers evening prayers and that that kind of devotion that kind of fellowship with God allowed him to see angels when he was older he actually fellowship with angels because he had the morning evening was a morning noon and evening prayer life I don't know we're not gay I know prophets are most likely to see angels I'm saying our communion with God would be so much better if we seek God seek his kingdom first and everything else will take care of itself David a man after God's own heart in Psalms 5 verse 3 said my voice shout out here in the morning O Lord in morning where I direct my prayer unto thee and will look up Psalm 63 1 a psalm of David when he was in the wilderness of Judah Oh God my god early will I seek thee my soul thirsts for thee my flesh longing for the dry and thirsty land where no water is Psalm 63 - to see thy power thy glory so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary my heart is fixed O God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise or wake up my glory awake psaltery and harp I myself will awake early I will praise thee O Lord among the people I will sing unto thee among the nations your David a man after God's own heart he said Lord I'll make sure I'm gonna get up early you're gonna hear my voice in the morning I'm gonna praise in the morning I'm gonna get up early so I can spend that time with you my soul longs for it praise God you know Jesus got up real early we know that right after the revival services of the healing services and mark 1:35 the very next scripture after he heals the multitudes mark 1:35 says in the morning rising up a great while before day he went out and departed into a solitary place and there prayed if Jesus Christ the Son of God without a sinful nature had to go pray to get his mind right before the day I think we need to do that too don't you and we do it as we said we do it through our role in life whether father mother child teenager teenagers you guys you have to learn that in your life the early alert the more blessings you'll see because of it that's the secret secret is that fellowship with the Lord seek God first that's the secret see God first everything else to take care of it Jesus got up early and he went to a loan place a solitary place and there he prayed look at proverbs 8:17 I love that this is wisdom lady wisdom I love them that love me and those that seek me early shall find me so Jesus Jesus says the same thing wisdom says a thousand years before wisdom said if you seek me early you'll find me jesus said everyone that seeks shall find every one that knocks shall open wax is the same spirit praise God hey man how they live yeah same spirit all right let's say into our feet here I think I want to stop right there now there's a few more directions that may go next time like I said I wonder study more on the prove all things but it's gonna take hours and hours so some of those topics I'm new to I don't really have any background in those so I didn't have enough time to study those but I hope this was a blessing how many want to see God's kingdom first how many want to aim for the virtue and the integrity of Jesus Christ ruling their life how do you want to aim for that that's my musicians you can come up here let's sing that seek ye first the kingdom of God as we pray here tonight to me this is the difference between a wise and a foolish virgin I could be wrong but someone who's so on fire for God are some of that so thirst for God that as soon as they wake up oh yes I got a I got to feed the desire of the soul the soul is crying out for fellowship I got to give that prayer time with God even as I'm helping the children I can do that even as I'm getting the breakfast ready I can do that I can say yes Laura I can turn on a sermon I can turn on music I can get my mind my soul having fellowship with God [Music] don't you think Jesus wants to hear moms and dads sing in the kitchen in the morning they might be flipping pancakes like a Casey does it might be flipping eggs like a Casey those two and Lydia used to but they can sing while they're doing it and they'll feed their soul and talk with the Lord children even do that the Bible says pray without ceasing I was my family I was our church to develop that desire first thing get the mind right okay what's true what's true today what's the truth I need to feed my soul I need to have fellowship with God seek that first aim for that give my family praying get my family fed get my family ready for worship and everything else will be added unto me lest I want a prayer and Heavenly Father you're a gracious God you love us so much do you I just want to turn there my Bible Lord pardon me as I'm praying I just want to turn there my Bible because your prophet Paul wrote that all of us could try to be rooted and grounded in love that him here it is heshes 318 that we may be able to comprehend with All Saints what is the breadth the length and the depth and height and to know the love of Christ which passes all knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God praise the Lord all we want to be so rooted and grounded in your truth and your love dear God that we can begin to understand how great your love is knowing how much you love us makes us for the fellowship with you is if anybody love me that much to die for me surely they want what's best for you surely they can direct my life better than I can thank God they can help me in my life and a worthy cause not just food and water and clothes no god but something greater than that the purity of heart the integrity the honesty of a Christian the virtue the strength of a Christian the moral strength of a Holy Ghost they'd say dear God lord I pray for the church I pray for myself my family God that we will learn the secret first all the days of our life to you it wasn't a suggestion Lord it was a command you said seek ye first the kingdom of God the rules are only spirit the inward rule and your righteousness your purity of heart and everything else will be added compass in the morning Lord to see you Father whether it's through breakfast take the children get dressed Lord whatever is prayer closet going to school then it's learner seated for its top right because one thing we know you love us so great Lord God nothing could separate us from your love and as we fellowship with you we love you more and we want to share your love with other people thank you lord so I prayed for Billy Paul and Joseph again Lord I've spent all those hours because they love I pray they've responded maybe helped by those votes we stood since four there's the love of God in my heart feel just to help our brothers don't know we're aiming for your kingdom we want to hit the target not do one achieve this rapture will achieve this fellowship with God this wisdom we want to be wise on this earth and help us now in Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] by [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
