[8:35] okay let's then I'm just gonna try to
[8:37] preach 30 minutes tonight I'm really
[8:39] gonna try so let's go to Ecclesiastes
[8:41] chapter three verse fourteen I like to
[8:43] go there I spent most of my studying
[8:47] time yesterday on this morning's message
[8:50] and so didn't quite to go as I didn't
[8:54] get to go as deep as I wanted to in the
[8:55] numerology study so I'm gonna save that
[8:57] for Wednesday hopefully
[8:58] study on that but let's go to
[9:00] Ecclesiastes 3 verse 14 and 15 I like to
[9:07] preach part 16 and this is called God
[9:09] require that which is passed I want to
[9:11] just briefly preach through these
[9:13] chapters here this has been such a
[9:16] blessing to me preaching through
[9:18] proverbs and Ecclesiastes it's been so
[9:20] wonderful I feel like God's given me a
[9:25] great revelation on the Kuip type of
[9:28] attitude that we should have what wisdom
[9:30] looks like today and how we can overcome
[9:33] despair as we preach on last time how we
[9:37] can overcome the discouragements of life
[9:39] Solomon was so over over overcome with
[9:43] despair so discouraged and yet he had
[9:45] everything physically he could possibly
[9:47] want and so it's been just been a great
[9:49] time of Revelation to see that we can
[9:52] have the joy and love of Jesus Christ
[9:54] and be just as happy now amen with
[9:56] having very little we should be so
[9:58] joyous so let's read please ask these
[10:01] three 14 and 15
[10:05] and I'll set my timer here let's just go
[10:08] about half an hour and then hopefully by
[10:10] that time faith is face should be risen
[10:12] then we have six prayer requests yeah
[10:16] six
[10:17] let me read those before you read our
[10:20] text Jerry the gentlemen they're at
[10:23] giant ego he wants prayer he's gonna try
[10:26] to get Sundays off so he don't have to
[10:27] work on Sundays anymore cuz he already
[10:29] should have them off also I want to see
[10:31] my friend Seth save he's the one whose
[10:33] dad is God is healing his dad at the
[10:34] hospital Tonya said she had high trouble
[10:37] that's why she didn't come today she had
[10:38] I trouble so she even sent me a text
[10:40] saying I know God's a healer so let's
[10:42] just pray ask God to man that's a good
[10:44] that's a good confession let's pray to
[10:46] God will manifest his healing power to
[10:48] Tonya and then brother bill is in a
[10:51] campground where it's all flooded out so
[10:52] it's prayer that God will take away the
[10:55] flood waters and then Karen said pray
[11:00] for brother Norris when you burn when
[11:02] Keith Randolph was here I went up for
[11:04] prayer I stood in for brother Loras and
[11:06] Karen said she noticed a change the day
[11:09] after so we're still wanting more change
[11:12] but she said she said I want to give you
[11:14] a less timoni so I know I felt let the
[11:17] Lord that time to go up to her prayer
[11:19] for him that was a real encouragement
[11:21] but we love our brother and our sister
[11:24] so let's pray for him when we're done
[11:25] and then Christopher Jose said he's
[11:27] happy he had fevers all last night and
[11:31] today so let's I told him we'd pray for
[11:33] them so let's preach a little bit like I
[11:35] said 30 minutes and then we'll we'll
[11:37] close the prayer maybe we'll call
[11:39] everybody up here for prayer just cut so
[11:40] it kind of gets us out of the mold you
[11:41] know and we can raise our faith up here
[11:43] together please ask these three 14 and
[11:48] 15
[11:49] I'll read 14 then we'll read 15 together
[11:52] verse 14 I know that whatsoever God
[11:56] doeth it shall be forever nothing can be
[12:01] put to it nor anything taken from it and
[12:04] God do with it that men should fear
[12:06] before him let's read verse 15 ready one
[12:10] two three that which hath been is now
[12:14] and that which is to be hath all
[12:17] ready been and God requires that which
[12:20] is passed let's have a word of Prayer
[12:22] let's just pray here father we love you
[12:25] Lord we love to sing your praises we
[12:27] love to worship you and father we just
[12:29] asked Lord it through the reading of
[12:30] this word you anoint this word God and
[12:32] Lord just continue to open up proverbs
[12:34] and Ecclesiastes Lord it's truly been a
[12:36] lord a transforming book for me Lord
[12:39] just to see your power Lord and the sea
[12:43] Lord the attitude we should have Lord
[12:45] towards our life and how blessed we are
[12:47] through the blood of Jesus Christ pour
[12:50] Solomon Lord he was a godly wonderful
[12:52] man buddy he lived before that atonement
[12:55] Lord and because of that Lord he he went
[12:58] through these things but Lord on this
[12:59] side now we can see how Lord you left
[13:02] your peace you said if I if I leave if I
[13:06] go away I'll leave my peace I'll leave
[13:08] my joy and Lord we know there is no
[13:11] greater joy than that joy of Christ
[13:13] Jesus so lord help us to learn from this
[13:15] help us to walk pleasing to you and
[13:18] anoint us here tonight as we want to
[13:20] pray as well the closing in Jesus
[13:22] Christ's name never said Amen see there
[13:26] for you Scott okay so I like to just
[13:30] preach a real shotgun message here just
[13:34] real I think that's the right word let's
[13:36] preach it kind of quick here by God's
[13:37] grace I preached chapters one two and
[13:40] part of three so I want to I want to
[13:42] preach three and four if I can tonight
[13:44] on this half-hour so let's go to chapter
[13:49] 3 verse 1 verses 1 to 8 are pretty
[13:57] familiar and I think it's just good to
[13:59] read over this to everything there is a
[14:02] season and a time to every purpose under
[14:04] the heaven a time to be born and a time
[14:08] to die a time to plant and a time to
[14:12] pluck up that which is planted a time to
[14:15] kill and a time to heal a time to break
[14:19] down and a time to build up a time to
[14:23] weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn
[14:27] and a time to dance
[14:30] to cast away stones and a time to gather
[14:32] stones together a time to embrace and a
[14:36] time to refrain from embracing a time to
[14:40] get and a time to lose a time to keep
[14:44] and a time to cast away verse 7 a time
[14:47] to Rend and a time to sew a time to keep
[14:51] silence and a time to speak a time to
[14:56] love the time to hate a time of war and
[15:00] a time of peace amen
[15:05] so we know brother branham said this to
[15:10] do God a service first it must be it's
[15:12] time to do it
[15:13] the very first thing if we're ever gonna
[15:16] do God a service we've got to have the
[15:18] timing of the Lord amen so that's why
[15:21] this text is so critical to us before we
[15:24] do anything we should say Lord is this
[15:26] the time is this the right time to do
[15:29] this is this the time to do that I think
[15:32] we can all apply it to our lives you
[15:34] know what some of these things say is
[15:35] this the time for me to be married or
[15:37] this time for me to have children or
[15:39] this time for me to have this job or is
[15:41] this a time for us to start a church you
[15:43] know all these things in my life that
[15:44] I've seen God has directed the timing of
[15:47] it and we've always pray lord if it be
[15:50] your will let it be that let thy will be
[15:52] done not my will because we know it'll
[15:55] be done correctly if it's done in God's
[15:58] time praise God because remember David
[16:02] did everything when he tried to do God a
[16:05] service bringing the ARCA to Jerusalem
[16:07] he did everything right except he didn't
[16:09] consult the Word of God the timing was
[16:11] right the worship was right everything
[16:13] was right except he didn't consult the
[16:15] word he didn't consult the Prophet
[16:16] that's the only thing he missed
[16:17] everything else was good because
[16:19] remember three months later he did
[16:21] everything the same and it just went
[16:23] smoothly and perfectly and it was a
[16:25] great rejoicing revival time for Israel
[16:28] he just missed one thing the word it was
[16:31] the right time and so church that's so
[16:33] that's why prayer so important prayer
[16:35] will lead us to the right time prayer
[16:37] will use the right time and if we really
[16:39] devote ourselves to prayer and put a
[16:41] situation up before God in prayer
[16:44] and we try not to push it try not to
[16:46] make it happen then we know God will do
[16:48] it in his time God knows we're human God
[16:51] knows we're not prophets God knows all
[16:53] these things and we've just got to trust
[16:55] God Lord you know I'm not a prophet you
[16:57] know I don't see your visions you know I
[16:59] don't hear voices so you've got to
[17:01] direct me give me give me trust give me
[17:04] confidence that you will direct
[17:05] everything in your time amen and then we
[17:09] do our part by waiting upon him for his
[17:11] time and then looking to the word look
[17:13] to the word judge everything by the word
[17:15] like we were talking earlier you know at
[17:17] lunch like how could these things happen
[17:18] in jeffersonville how could these things
[17:20] happen the thing is they're not looking
[17:22] to the word we've got to look to the
[17:24] word because the pattern will never
[17:26] change that's what our text was for
[17:27] tonight and I want to make sure we just
[17:30] revisit that again okay so first it must
[17:34] be his time it must be the season you
[17:36] know I think of my friend who just died
[17:38] at 42 years old this must have been the
[17:39] season for him to die he's 42 there's a
[17:43] time a season to be born and a season to
[17:45] die so no doubt God must have give him
[17:48] some type of I don't you know I've been
[17:49] hurting testimonies come out about that
[17:51] but there must have been some type of
[17:52] warning because there's a season and
[17:54] just like now we can see the season for
[17:56] fall is almost on in fact Haven said
[17:58] this morning daddy it's almost winter
[17:59] time you know I'm like oh no not winter
[18:02] time I don't think about snow but you
[18:06] know God so just as obvious as this is
[18:09] that winters on its way so it is with
[18:11] our lives God has to give us a sign for
[18:15] all these things a time to die a time to
[18:17] plant a time to pluck up a time to kill
[18:19] time to heal break down and build up all
[18:21] these things God has to make it simple
[18:24] for us because we know he's revealed in
[18:26] simplicity God's not the author of
[18:28] confusion praise God he's the author of
[18:30] understanding Amen so I just want to
[18:33] make sure I emphasize that first it must
[18:36] be his time so we must wait on the Lord
[18:38] if that's the very first thing we must
[18:40] wait upon the Lord for his timing now
[18:43] verse 9 and 10 now he breaks off from
[18:46] that thought so he lays that thought in
[18:48] there and then he goes to the next
[18:50] thought the next thought is what profit
[18:52] is there in his labor so we can see
[18:54] right now Solomon's still pretty
[18:55] pessimistic he's still pretty disc
[18:58] remember in Chapter two he was really
[18:59] discouraged he said I hate life a man
[19:03] who had unlimited women unlimited money
[19:07] unlimited power and he said I hate life
[19:09] my can you imagine that that shows how
[19:12] sin takes you further than you want to
[19:14] go that shows you how sin is only
[19:16] pleasurable for a season amen
[19:19] if all the women and all the money and
[19:21] all the riches if all that wouldn't
[19:23] satisfy it shows you that the Bible's
[19:26] true praise God only the joy of the Lord
[19:28] satisfies yes I'm so joyful tonight amen
[19:32] glory that we can have access to the
[19:35] presence of God amen
[19:36] to the joy of the Lord verse 9 what
[19:39] profit has he that labor in that wherein
[19:42] he lay birth I've seen the travail which
[19:45] God has given to the sons of men to be
[19:47] exercised in it oh yeah in verse 11 he
[19:50] goes back to this so see verse 11 he
[19:53] says he have made everything beautiful
[19:54] in his time also he hath set the world
[19:56] in their heart so that no man can find
[19:58] out the work that God maketh from the
[20:00] beginning to the end this is an odd
[20:02] scripture doesn't seem very odd to you
[20:05] he said God has set the world or this
[20:07] means the desire for eternity if you
[20:10] look in the Hebrew it's a long duration
[20:12] always ancient time perpetual old God
[20:17] has set the desire for eternity in our
[20:20] hearts and so this means that we are us
[20:23] we are a human spirit
[20:25] we are a supernatural creature living a
[20:27] natural experience see God set it in our
[20:30] hearts there's something supernatural in
[20:31] us but we can't find can't quite find
[20:33] everything out yet because our bodies
[20:35] haven't been changed but when our bodies
[20:37] are changed then shall we know even as
[20:39] we are known let me say like this church
[20:41] you are known in the mind of God you are
[20:44] known and when you get that new body
[20:46] then you will know just as you are known
[20:48] by him amen
[20:50] but see this is man man desires this he
[20:54] desires
[20:54] this realization there's something he
[20:58] wants and he just wants to feel that
[21:00] eternity he desires to know eternal
[21:03] things but he can't find it out here on
[21:05] this side and Solomon got discouraged
[21:07] verse 12
[21:10] for I know that there is no good in them
[21:13] for a man to rejoice and to do good in
[21:16] his life and also that every man should
[21:17] eat and drink and enjoy the good of all
[21:19] of us labor it is the gift of God praise
[21:23] the Lord so see God's gifts are simple
[21:28] things as enjoying life eating and drink
[21:30] and the fact that we get to go and
[21:32] fellowship between services or eat when
[21:34] we have Carians that's a gift of God
[21:36] because like my friend who passed away
[21:38] I'm sure all I like another meal with
[21:40] him it's been years since I had one and
[21:43] brother BAM said I would give you a
[21:45] hundred million dollars push a button
[21:47] for one hour to talk with my dad who has
[21:49] already passed member that quote I'd pay
[21:51] a hundred million he said I wouldn't
[21:52] even be what do you me a question I'll
[21:54] give a 100 million dollars so I can
[21:55] press the button and talk to my dad for
[21:57] one hour see it's the time that we have
[22:00] with people that's the real value that's
[22:03] the real value and so this is what
[22:05] Solomon is learning through the course
[22:08] of his life now I forgot to read this
[22:10] too I just wrote down some things God
[22:11] makes everything beautiful Jesus's death
[22:13] and Beryl did not seem beautiful but God
[22:16] made it beautiful in his time hallelujah
[22:20] Moses is life as a murderer and as a
[22:23] runaway slave did not appear beautiful
[22:25] but God made a beautiful in his time
[22:28] Joseph was in prison thirteen years it
[22:30] didn't seem very beautiful but God
[22:32] raised him up to the right hand of
[22:33] Pharaoh God makes everything beautiful
[22:35] in his time amen and you could go
[22:38] through more examples but those are the
[22:39] ones that just kind of come to my heart
[22:41] God makes everything beautiful in his
[22:43] time praise God even memory even all
[22:47] those slain Jews that were slain by
[22:50] Stalin and Hitler they're all crying out
[22:52] loora loora won't you avenge us and he
[22:54] says I'll avenge you he said but your
[22:56] your brethren must also be killed he
[22:59] said but I'll give you a white robe amen
[23:02] they were not listen Church they
[23:04] rejected him on this earth they said
[23:06] Jesus Christ he's not the Messiah he
[23:09] read they rejected God but God made even
[23:11] that beautiful in his own time he said
[23:14] because you were blinded you didn't know
[23:15] I'll make it beautiful my time
[23:17] I'll give you white robes and then I'll
[23:19] not only that I'll bend your blood right
[23:22] the mother harlot I'll then
[23:24] your blood upon the earth that's exactly
[23:26] right or that Antichrist spirit that was
[23:28] behind it so see this is true God makes
[23:30] everything beautiful in its time now
[23:33] verse 14 and 15 was our text brother
[23:36] Branham calls this room everybody call
[23:37] this who would have thought and in
[23:40] Ecclesiastes 3 God places the keystone
[23:43] of the entire Bible the cornerstone of
[23:47] the entire Bible is in Ecclesiastes
[23:50] chapter 3 along with Hebrews 13:8 the
[23:55] very keystone of the Bible well what's
[23:57] the foundation of the Bible brother
[23:59] Jesse where's of that Ecclesiastes 3 14
[24:02] and 15 and Hebrews 13:8 that's the
[24:05] problem Aaron tells us of the church age
[24:06] book the very key stone in the midst of
[24:09] all this backsliding of Psalm and God
[24:11] gives him the key stone and this is the
[24:12] key stone I know whatsoever God doeth it
[24:15] shall be forever amen in the midst of
[24:19] his backsliding in the midst of his his
[24:21] trials in his hating life in the midst
[24:23] of his sinful condition God gives them a
[24:25] revelation that whatever God does it's
[24:27] forever you can't add anything to it nor
[24:30] do you take anything from it whatever
[24:32] God does he said men should fear before
[24:35] God amen the very key stone the very
[24:38] foundation of the Bible that Jesus
[24:40] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[24:43] forever and that's that's why this
[24:44] morning's message was so important you
[24:46] can't add to the message you can't add
[24:50] to what the Prophet said you can't add
[24:51] to the Bible if you do you break the
[24:53] keystone of the Bible you take the
[24:56] Keystone away so we cannot add we or we
[24:59] can't add or take anything away we've
[25:01] got to leave it just as it is because
[25:03] God requires that which is passed that's
[25:06] verse 15 that which hath been is now and
[25:09] that which is to be hath already been
[25:12] and God require that which is passed
[25:14] amen God is requiring us to go back God
[25:18] is requiring what he did on the day of
[25:20] Pentecost guys requiring that today amen
[25:23] Alleluia now here's how brother Branham
[25:25] says it the key given me of the Lord
[25:28] whereby I was able to determine the
[25:30] messenger for each age is a most
[25:32] scripture one in fact it might be called
[25:34] the keystone of the Bible here it is
[25:37] is the revelation that God never changes
[25:40] and that his ways are as unchangeable as
[25:43] he is amen praise God hallelujah
[25:47] he said then unchanging God with
[25:49] unchanging ways what he did at the first
[25:52] he will have to keep on doing until it
[25:55] is done for the last time there will
[25:57] never be a change
[25:59] he says apply that to the church ages
[26:00] the kind of man that God chose for the
[26:03] first age and how God manifested in that
[26:05] man's ministry would be the example for
[26:08] all their ages what God did in the first
[26:10] church age is what he wants to do in all
[26:12] other ages amen
[26:14] see God wants us to have our first love
[26:16] Amen that's what God did in the
[26:18] beginning
[26:18] the fusion church age God wants us to
[26:21] keep our first love keep our fire
[26:23] burning be real Christians let the
[26:24] example God requires what is past he
[26:27] requires it today amen so that's the
[26:32] very keystone of the Bible's right there
[26:35] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 praise God amen
[26:38] that's beautiful now verse 16 and 17 he
[26:41] says God shall judge all and moreover I
[26:44] saw under the Sun the place of judgment
[26:46] that wickedness was there and that the
[26:47] place of righteousness that iniquity was
[26:49] there and I said in my heart God shall
[26:52] judge the righteous and the wicked for
[26:53] there's a time there for every purpose
[26:56] and for every work praise God see so we
[27:01] must confess all of our knick wa t
[27:02] because unconfessed iniquity will be
[27:04] there on the day of judgment God is
[27:07] gonna judge everybody all people we know
[27:09] that Solomon is aware of that just says
[27:11] that Keystone was there that whatever
[27:13] God does forever God has always judged
[27:16] right he's always judged sin he's always
[27:18] offered mercy he's always offered
[27:20] forgiveness and we must make sure we
[27:21] confess all unrighteousness all iniquity
[27:23] and we must appear before God with no
[27:26] sin
[27:27] Alleluia because he shall judge all
[27:29] remember brother and says now is our
[27:32] tribulation time right now is our
[27:35] purgatory is that right Church now is
[27:37] the time where you're uncomfortable
[27:38] right now it's the time where you feel
[27:40] like you're being burnt up and you feel
[27:42] like you're being going through two hard
[27:44] trials and now is our purgatory we must
[27:45] suffer now that will rain later amen
[27:48] glory verse 18 through 21
[27:51] I said in my heart concerning the estate
[27:54] the sons of men that God might manifest
[27:56] them and that they might see that they
[27:58] themselves are beasts Solomon prayed
[28:01] that God show them they're a bunch of
[28:03] beasts but for that which we fought the
[28:08] sons of men befalleth beasts even one
[28:10] thing befall of them as the one diet so
[28:13] diet the other yay they all have one
[28:15] breath so that a man hath no preeminence
[28:17] above a beast for all his vanity now of
[28:20] course and you know he's got he's a
[28:21] little he's a little pessimistic here as
[28:23] well but he's letting them know they all
[28:25] have one thing in common man and beast
[28:27] the one thing in common is death verse
[28:31] 20 all go into one place all are of the
[28:33] dust and all turn to dust again who note
[28:37] the spirit of man that goeth upward and
[28:39] the spirit of the Beast that goeth
[28:40] downward to the earth now Church if you
[28:43] know the message this is a little off
[28:44] right where did spirits go after they
[28:47] died in the Old Testament down did they
[28:50] didn't they go down to Paradise then
[28:52] they go to Abraham's bosom didn't they
[28:55] go down so see that this was just his
[28:57] thinking well believers must go up and
[28:59] sinners must go down right so see he's a
[29:03] little off he's a little off there
[29:05] because the spirits of good men went to
[29:07] Abraham's bosom now after Jesus rose now
[29:11] he might worry we could say he had a
[29:12] revelation of the future because it now
[29:15] after Jesus rose he rose first and then
[29:18] he come back down and then Jesus
[29:19] descended and he brought up captivity
[29:21] and led them captive is that right and
[29:23] now Church of UK if you watch the
[29:25] message to not only do righteous men go
[29:27] up but also their animals go up because
[29:32] where did fritzsche
[29:32] where did frits go brother man's dog
[29:35] right
[29:36] where did Prince's horse go where did
[29:38] that spirit go see so he's saying all
[29:42] these animal spirits go down humans go
[29:44] up but in reality after the cross all
[29:46] believers go up and the animals they
[29:48] loved must go up as well unless that was
[29:52] just a special gift for brother Branham
[29:53] which it could be but is that
[29:55] interesting he sees okay ant men go up
[29:57] humans go down but in all reality that
[29:59] time humans went down
[30:01] perhaps beasts went down but now since
[30:03] the blood of Jesus Christ now
[30:05] can go aren't you glad we can go up
[30:06] prairies god I'm glad that we don't have
[30:08] to go down to Abraham's bosom and glance
[30:10] over and see people suffering yeah we're
[30:13] we're cut from that now by the blood of
[30:15] Jesus Christ amen thank God for that so
[30:20] see he's still wrestling with this man
[30:22] versus beast man has no preeminence over
[30:25] the animal but God of course gives us a
[30:27] further revelation praise God
[30:30] verse 22 wherefore I perceive that
[30:33] there's nothing better than that a man
[30:35] should rejoice in his own works for that
[30:38] is his portion or who shall bring him to
[30:41] see which shall be after him so he says
[30:44] your portion is to rejoice in your works
[30:46] we do not know what will be after us so
[30:49] rejoice and what God has given you right
[30:51] now we can't worry about the future
[30:53] we can't fret about the future well what
[30:56] happens when I'm not the pastor here
[30:57] anymore is it is it gonna go on we
[30:59] shouldn't worry about that it's all in
[31:01] God's hands amen there's nothing better
[31:04] to just rejoice and what God is doing
[31:05] right now to see this so this is a good
[31:08] scripture for that quote brother Bram
[31:09] tells us write man always rejoice to
[31:11] what God did and what he's gonna do but
[31:14] they're missing what he's doing right
[31:15] now amen god help us to see what he's
[31:17] doing right now and rejoice and God's
[31:19] works going on right now
[31:21] amen beautiful alright chapter four I
[31:26] got 12 minutes so I think I can get
[31:27] through chapter four we'll see and I
[31:32] want to close with these numerous prayer
[31:34] requests verses 1 through 3 solomon sees
[31:37] the oppression that's in jerusalem that
[31:40] isn't this interesting he's the king and
[31:42] he can't even stop oppression now one of
[31:45] that's because of his sins or I wonder
[31:47] what why that why this is but he's the
[31:49] king and he can't even stop oppression
[31:50] in the world so I returned and
[31:53] considered all the oppressions that are
[31:54] done under the Sun and behold the tears
[31:57] of such as were oppressed and they had
[31:59] no comforter and on the side of their
[32:01] oppressors there was power but they had
[32:03] no comforter wherefore I praise the Dead
[32:06] which are already dead more than the
[32:08] living which were yet alive yay better
[32:10] is he than both day which hath not yet
[32:13] been who hath not seen the evil work
[32:16] that is done on
[32:18] the Sun Sol Solomon sees political
[32:21] oppression so I don't know it was it was
[32:22] in his country or another country he
[32:25] sees political oppression and then he
[32:27] praises the dead since they did not have
[32:29] to live through the depression that's
[32:34] kind of a kind of a we'd say a
[32:35] backslidden thought right he's gonna
[32:37] he's a little bit back said here he's
[32:39] praising the dead or I'm glad the people
[32:41] died and don't have to go through this
[32:43] but later on God gives us a little
[32:45] revelation on this maybe I just thought
[32:47] of that maybe if I can find it real
[32:49] quick oh that was in Proverbs I'm not
[32:52] sure where that's at there's a scripture
[32:54] in Proverbs where it tells us don't fret
[32:56] too much about the oppressed because God
[32:58] is there judge in other words God will
[33:00] fight for all those who are oppressed
[33:02] but Solomon gets so discouraged he
[33:04] starts to oh and be better to be dead
[33:06] than be alive
[33:07] and so he gets so depressed and he gets
[33:08] so down and we see that's political
[33:12] oppression now look at verse 4 through 6
[33:15] again I considered all travail on every
[33:18] right work that for this a man is envied
[33:21] of his neighbor this is also vanity and
[33:23] vexation once you say amen to that and
[33:26] being your neighbor trying to be like
[33:28] the Joneses
[33:30] that's all that's vanity The Fool folded
[33:33] his hands together and eateth his own
[33:35] flesh betters and handful with quietness
[33:38] then both the hands full with travail
[33:40] and vexation of spirit amen
[33:43] so see quietness is better than laziness
[33:46] or overwork just a quiet sweet human
[33:49] humble peaceful atmosphere how many want
[33:51] a peaceful atmosphere in your home it's
[33:53] more valuable than laziness sitting
[33:55] around do nothing and also overwork
[33:57] we've got to find the middle of the road
[33:59] praise God Lord give me peace the midst
[34:01] of all these things help me to say no to
[34:03] people this this week I was my wife was
[34:05] really proud of me my principal asked me
[34:07] to take something on I said no I can't
[34:08] do it she was so proud of me that I said
[34:10] no I was actually kind of proud of
[34:12] myself
[34:13] uh-huh you're getting little wisdom
[34:15] there brother Jesse but see this is
[34:18] peacefulness rather than add burden add
[34:20] burden add burden being able to say no
[34:23] and help me just have peace help me at
[34:25] peace Solomon sees the value in peace
[34:28] verse seven and eight to be alone as so
[34:32] his sword travail verse seven and eight
[34:35] then I returned earned i'm stay there
[34:37] and I saw vanity under the Sun there is
[34:39] one alone and there is not a second yeh
[34:41] he has neither child nor brother so see
[34:46] like a only child yet is there no end of
[34:49] all his labor neither is his eye
[34:53] satisfied with riches neither saith he
[34:56] for whom do I labor and breed my soul of
[34:59] good this also is vanity yay
[35:01] it is sort or veil so see Solomon saw
[35:05] people they didn't have children they
[35:07] didn't have grandchildren they didn't
[35:08] have brothers sisters and alls they did
[35:10] was overworked themselves and he said
[35:11] that what I want to waste what a waste
[35:14] of your life to just live there I just
[35:15] work work work work work without any
[35:18] pleasure life without any joy in life
[35:20] see so see where they missing their
[35:22] missing love here work all this work
[35:25] work without love and enjoying time he
[35:27] said it's all vanity so see we can't get
[35:30] over balance how many brothers have I
[35:31] talked to over the years that tell me
[35:34] their biggest problem is overwork and
[35:35] they never do nothing to change it
[35:38] have you ever spared that brother
[35:39] William I've my this it's crazy in
[35:42] America in fact we had a brother here
[35:44] who visited from Columbus remember that
[35:47] he's from Ghana remember you remember
[35:48] that brother okay he said boy I came to
[35:50] America they have such great revelation
[35:52] he said we had such a good time in the
[35:53] Lord he said but then the company start
[35:55] working me to death so he said the word
[35:58] here's powerful the revelation is
[36:00] powerful but then the political and
[36:03] economic works you to death he said and
[36:06] he said he's not where he should be
[36:07] spiritually because he's being worked to
[36:08] death I heard a lot of amens on that one
[36:12] amen brother Jesse they work you to
[36:15] death
[36:15] like like they're trying to get me to do
[36:17] something else this week take on someone
[36:19] else do more do more do more
[36:21] I can't do everything I must choose to
[36:23] do what God's calling me to do amen amen
[36:26] but see he sees us here's a man all he
[36:30] does his work he has no one to work for
[36:31] it's vanity he's all overworked wasting
[36:34] his life
[36:36] look at verse nine two are better than
[36:40] one because they have a good reward for
[36:43] their labor let's read verse
[36:46] 10:4 if they fall the one will lift up
[36:47] his fella but woe to him that is alone
[36:49] when he falls for he hath not another to
[36:52] help him up
[36:53] verse 11 again have to lie together then
[36:57] they have heat but how can one be warm
[36:59] alone verse 12 and if one prevail
[37:02] against him two shall withstand him and
[37:04] a three for cold the cord is not quickly
[37:07] broken amen
[37:09] so Solomon sees how two are better than
[37:11] one he says in most cases because two
[37:14] can withstand in opposition but he says
[37:17] I like this he said three for cord is
[37:19] not quickly broken there's power and 3
[37:21] right 3 is the number of perfection amen
[37:24] and this is used at weddings a
[37:25] three-fold cord is not quickly broken
[37:28] but I want to balance that out too
[37:31] because here Solomon's making an
[37:32] observation but remember Daniels stood
[37:35] alone on numerous occasions he was all
[37:38] alone in the lion's den but church he
[37:41] wasn't alone hey man hallelujah he was
[37:45] alone but he wasn't he had an angel with
[37:48] him hallelujah yes he was alone
[37:52] interpreting at Belshazzar's feast when
[37:55] he interpreted the handwriting on the
[37:56] wall all the other guys died but he
[37:58] didn't die because he wasn't alone God
[38:01] was with him amen
[38:03] Jesus told brother Branham in 1960 he
[38:06] had to walk with him to walk with him
[38:09] he'd have to walk alone in other words
[38:11] without the influence from organizations
[38:13] brother Brahim still had fellowship with
[38:14] brother Neville all the brothers around
[38:16] the tabernacle Higginbottom all the
[38:18] brothers brother cons all the brothers
[38:19] you can name all those names he still
[38:21] went hunting all the time with them but
[38:22] see he had to live alone he had to be
[38:24] separate from the influence that any
[38:26] influence that wasn't from the Lord
[38:28] Jesus Christ he stood on fellowship he
[38:31] still travel TCI fellowship with Billy
[38:32] Paul he travel with him all the time all
[38:34] around the world but it says he wasn't
[38:37] saying well you can't fellowship with
[38:38] anybody he was saying you can only be
[38:40] influenced by the Holy Spirit amen
[38:44] and so church
[38:46] but I want to apply this to or better
[38:48] than one because you even if you're
[38:50] alone even if whoever's alone you still
[38:53] walk with the Holy Spirit because you're
[38:56] never really alone praise God that's
[38:59] right
[38:59] honestly think about it you're either
[39:01] you're either with Devils or you're with
[39:03] the Holy Spirit even if people separate
[39:06] themselves from all the humans they
[39:07] either got a bunch of Devils around them
[39:08] or they got the Holy Ghost around them I
[39:10] mean they're no one's ever really alone
[39:13] so see Solomon's just looking at the
[39:15] natural and he's not focusing on the
[39:18] spiritual of course it wasn't open at
[39:20] that point st. Paul was single as whole
[39:22] life and he said yet there's a crown of
[39:25] righteousness waiting for him praise God
[39:27] because he wasn't alone two are better
[39:29] than one
[39:30] hallelujah Jesus stood alone he never
[39:33] married but no one could live a better
[39:35] life than Jesus Christ so again we see
[39:38] two are better than one the body of
[39:40] Jesus had the Eternal Spirit of the
[39:42] Father amen he was never alone except on
[39:45] the cross right the only time he was
[39:48] alone was on the cross he did it for you
[39:50] and I thank God so again these are the
[39:54] opinions of Solomon these are not thus
[39:56] saith the Lord statements these are
[39:59] observations you and I are never alone
[40:01] we are always standing with Christ
[40:03] hallelujah now interesting now in verses
[40:08] 9 through 12 this is all about
[40:10] friendship or marriage isn't it I want
[40:13] you to notice this is a good I found
[40:14] this from the commentary this commentary
[40:17] named Holman
[40:18] he said notice friendship was never
[40:20] called vanity in Ecclesiastes all these
[40:24] other things are called vanity work line
[40:26] women all these all these superficial
[40:29] things are called vanity but friendship
[40:31] has never called vanity that's because
[40:33] friendship is eternal praise the Lord I
[40:37] think it was Jose sent me text Oh today
[40:39] he said I said I appreciate your
[40:40] friendship he said he said brother our
[40:42] friendship is eternal I said you're
[40:45] right about that
[40:46] brother Brooke sent me a text this week
[40:48] and said I love you he said it's a
[40:50] eternal love friendship has never called
[40:54] vanity in the cleese yesyes because it
[40:57] is eternal
[40:59] man when you have a crap friend that's a
[41:02] Christian that friendship always be a
[41:03] eternal friendship it'll never end our
[41:07] friendship will never end brother bang I
[41:09] hope you don't want to end it hope I
[41:12] meant a good friend to you it'll never
[41:15] end you never end because it's eternal
[41:18] it's not vain it's not vanity there's
[41:20] value behind it because it's the love of
[41:22] God two are better than one
[41:25] and thank God Christ is always with us
[41:28] you see the Bible is even accurate with
[41:30] that friendship cannot be vain it's not
[41:32] vain there's always lasting value
[41:34] anything I can do for you or anything
[41:36] you can do for me is it there's an
[41:38] eternal blessing attached to that
[41:39] there's some there's some reward you'll
[41:41] get if even giving a glass of cold water
[41:45] in the name of an apostle not even the
[41:48] name of Jesus well I just give this to
[41:50] you because you know you follow brother
[41:51] branham's message that gets a reward I
[41:55] don't know if it gets eternal life but
[41:56] Jesus said it gets the report but jesus
[41:59] said when you've done it unto one of the
[42:00] least of these my brother and then
[42:02] you've done it unto me to see friendship
[42:05] is eternal how many want more friends
[42:09] now I want more friends because
[42:11] hopefully if they're good to me they can
[42:12] if they don't believe the way I do maybe
[42:14] God will give me turn of life amen
[42:15] because friendship is very very valuable
[42:19] it's not vanity extremely valuable I'm
[42:23] perfect I got one minute left for my
[42:25] half-hour sermon verse 13 through 16
[42:29] this closes chapter 4 I love the Bible
[42:32] this Bible was so powerful right for out
[42:36] of prison I'm sorry verse 13 better is a
[42:39] poor and a wise child than an old and
[42:42] foolish king who will no more be
[42:45] admonished and we see that this morning
[42:46] if somebody's got to evil spirit on them
[42:49] and they can't humble themselves it'd be
[42:51] better to just be a poor old or poor
[42:53] little child than be an old king who
[42:55] can't be corrected by the Word of God
[42:58] because this guy's he got all the
[43:00] resources but he's never gonna do
[43:01] nothing for God because got the evil
[43:02] spirit on him man verse 14 for out of
[43:09] prison he cometh to reign
[43:10] whereas also he that is born in his
[43:13] kingdom
[43:13] B cometh poor I considered all the
[43:17] living which walk under the Sun with a
[43:19] second child that shall stand up instead
[43:22] there is no end of all the people even
[43:25] of all that had been before them they
[43:28] also that come after shall not rejoice
[43:31] in him surely this is also vanity and
[43:34] vexation of spirit
[43:36] praise God let's say into our feet here
[43:38] I'm gonna stop right there it'd be
[43:41] better to be a poor little child with
[43:44] wisdom because you have a future you
[43:47] have at least a possibility to reign you
[43:50] can actually grow you can actually do
[43:51] something right but an old king who
[43:54] can't be corrected he's stubborn he's
[43:56] got a evil spirit on him he'll be an
[43:58] awful ruler and he'll make his kingdom
[44:00] poor he'll drive his kingdom right into
[44:03] the ground just like pastors I get a get
[44:05] a complex they can drive their church
[44:07] right down to the ground right we've all
[44:10] seen it I don't want to do that if you
[44:13] see a complex on me please let me know I
[44:15] don't want to I don't want to be the
[44:16] spot where I can't be taught and I can't
[44:18] learn any more I don't want to drive
[44:20] this into the ground I want to drive us
[44:22] up to heaven praise God I'm gonna ride
[44:25] the Holy Spirit I want to ride it like
[44:27] brother man said I'm riding it I'm
[44:28] riding it I want to ride it all up to
[44:30] heaven praise God an old king or a
[44:34] person who can't be corrected doesn't
[44:36] pay attention to warning signs I'll
[44:39] never see God warning him but even
[44:42] though a youthful king is successful for
[44:44] a time and pleases the crowd he to
[44:46] eventually get old lose touch and be
[44:48] abandoned political power and popularity
[44:51] are fleeting right we see it all the
[44:53] time with politics oh they're all happy
[44:55] for Obama and they're all happy for
[44:57] Trump well tell me what's really changed
[44:58] has anybody ever got closer to Jesus
[45:01] probably not they keep breaking the word
[45:03] to keep great more laws or doing more
[45:05] evil to see those things are all
[45:07] fleeting it's the person who can be
[45:09] corrected in the wisdom of God because
[45:11] remember wisdom is more valuable than
[45:13] anything else we can possibly imagine
[45:16] just the wisdom what is the what is the
[45:18] Bible choice what kind of person do I
[45:21] want to be what kind of friends should I
[45:23] be what choice should I make now what
[45:25] choice should I make there when we
[45:26] choose wizz
[45:27] it's more valuable than any financial
[45:29] blessing we could have the wisdom of God
[45:31] now I want you come here praise the Lord
