this week yeah amen i told him i said i want to call you up but i want to hear how you raise your teenagers and all these i said i just want all your advice brother i appreciate man of god like that so we're looking forward to brother brian preaching today i was just remembering how god has used brother brian in such wonderful ways here um helping us and two wonderful testimonies was when he prayed for sister mary ellen now she left the message now but before she left she could hardly walk she came in one service she fell in her tailbone and she came up for prayer brother brian prayed for her and she said as soon as she sat down she was instantly healed so that was a great move of god through our brother brian and then uh there's been numerous but the one time uh there was a brother there's one of our deacons a while ago was kind of against me and brother brian said that he come he was while he was preaching he just stopped and told that deacon he said do what you've got to do and then the next wednesday he resigned and left the church and i've had so much peace since then and i thank the lord for that it was such a it was such a move of the holy spirit it was it reminded me of jesus not not an evil way and i pray for this this man i love this man they reminded me of jesus when he told judas you got to do what you got to do so um it just was so led of the holy spirit and i thank the lord for a spirit-led man praise god how many appreciate that a man who's led by the holy spirit i remember brother remember when brother bryan went around praying for everybody around the whole church and uh you said that was such a strengthening uh for you brother just have somebody come and lay hands on you you know and i just remember that that was such a wonderful time in the lord so i appreciate brother brian uh being led of the holy spirit i've always loved this brother so we thank the lord because it's all god's grace amen they that are led by the spirit of god are the sons of god amen so let's remember these prayer requests brother brian said please pray for his son david he's going through some difficult training and then you know overcoming the influences in the marines is that right sister the marines praise god let's remember david he's preached here before and i surely enjoyed his preaching and let's remember him that god would give him overcoming grace also brother brian said there's a sister having surgery in the message he didn't know where but it was one uh test or one request that jim had passed on so let's remember a sister having surgery we don't need to know the details we just need to know the solution and that's jesus christ is the solution praise god um but brian also said that the dumbar family lost uh someone recently so let's remember the dunbar family that god will comfort their hearts but amen had a serious unspoken request let's remember that the god of mercy will minister to that need praise god any other needs anybody have any special needs they like to be remembered in prayer here today yes darling oh that's right yeah there's a house right down our road and uh it would half of it burn down yeah total loss so but everybody was saved alive so thank god for that let's remember that family it was electrical fire and we were just thanking the lord because we had our elect uh electric totally rewrite rewired a couple years ago and the electrician said this could have your house could have burned down so we're thankful for god's grace but we're thankful let's pray for that family any other needs on the hearts people nature [Music] that's right what was your name candace oh the girl with cancer right is it in the school district teacher's friend's girl okay that's so sweet of you honey i want to pray

precious brother again as you have so many times needed by the holy spirit father will give you all the praise and the glory in jesus christ's name saint [Music] to the lord here [Music] [Music] i wanted to give just a short testimony before i know 2020 was a hard year for a lot of people um it was really really hard for me and i know jesse's talked about how it was such a blessing for him it was for me but not in the same ways i never felt so weak in myself as i did last year the usual 20 20 things that were just hard for everybody but it was the hardest pregnancy i've had out of the eight just physically and mentally i just felt like i couldn't mother my children the way i used to and just i felt so weak and then just dealing with a lot of fear and anxiety like i never had before i don't tend to be a fearful or anxious person but it just hit me so hard but i just want to thank the lord because though that year was really hard he gave me a lot of help and deliverance through just the sermons preached here like um the job series that brother jesse was preaching like it meant a lot to me and um when brother cam was here last and he preached about being in goshen i got so much deliverance from all that fear and anxiety that i've been having and any time it starts to creep back on i just say no i'm in goshen i can see what's going on in egypt but i'm in goshen and and now with the joshua areas just seeing that um and how that's applied to me in this last year and now coming into a new year and just feeling a new sense of of peace and i just want to thank the lord um because he used the those trials of last year just to show me how weak i am on my own and how ignorant of it i had become like joe was um jesse had preached that knit i was like oh that's what this last year was i just had become ignorant of the extent of my own weakness and god showed it to me and i just can say that i am nothing on my own there is nothing good in me that means so much more to me now than it did before this trial um and it's just given me a renewed love for the lord and so i wanted to share that because it's been on my heart for a long time and so this song really means a lot to me i'll try to get through it without crying [Music] what gift of grace is jesus my redeemer there is no more for heaven now to give he is my joy my righteousness and freedom my steadfast love my deep and boundless peace to this i hope my hope is [Music] oh how strange and divine i can't see mommy is mine yet but through christ in me [Music] the night i is not forsaken for by my side the savior he will stay i labor on [Music] foreign [Music] through the deepest valley he will lead [Music] but through christ in [Music] the future the price it has [Music] has been defeated [Music] [Music] all the chains are released [Music] [Music] in me with every breath i long to follow jesus and day by day i know he will renew until i stand with joy [Music] [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] me [Music] through christ in me hallelujah [Music] no [Applause] kingdoms rise [Music] kid [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] all is [Music] oh my god [Music] [Applause] [Music] in [Music] me [Music] is [Music] me oh my god [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] glory oh my gosh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] but i long to rise [Music] is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] is [Music] is i will be alone [Music] coming in [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] me [Music] how many want to be drawn closer to the cross of christ amen that's where i want to stand as well praise god we're invited our brother to come preach uh he has the liberty of the holy spirit to preach what he feels led to minister how am i looking forward to the word amen i am i've been looking forward to it all week praise god my brother brian's coming all right he's coming i get a little rest and i can feed on the word i'm looking forward to it by god's grace sure love our brother praise god let's sing at the cross [Music] me [Music] so [Music] do [Music] oh [Music] down [Music] are you happy today praise the lord praise the lord thank the lord for that cross and everything that he's done for us all the long suffering he has no just just the patience he has with his children amen so uh i just want to thank you musicians appreciate y'all uh it truly is a wonderful gift uh brother amen you've come a long way brother brother malachi oh my goodness y'all have come a long way you've really really grown and man it's it's wonderful to hear and uh just pray that it follows suits spiritually through the through the growing of the word amen uh i do want to i have a little sticky note to remind me because i always forget stuff uh i just want to greet everybody from the home church uh brother jim my daughter shy everybody sends their greetings to you and uh i do want to thank brother jesse for inviting me thank you for the nice words uh not worthy of them all but uh just appreciate coming and and being here to minister to you all so if you would let's just get right into the word i'll turn to first samuel chapter eight and verse four and as usual i'm nervous as all get out but the uh it's not as bad as i'm kind of concerned because it's not as bad as usual so i don't know either i'm in the will of the lord or i don't know the nervousness just isn't as bad as it usually is maybe i'm just comfortable here so first samuel chapter eight and verse four it says uh then all the elders of israel gathered to gather themselves together and came to samuel unto rhema and said unto him behold thou art old and thy sons walk not in thy ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations but the thing displeased samuel he kind of took it a little personal but the and and very much so because he's he's seeing a change uh take place that he's that he's not happy with uh but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and samuel prayed unto the lord and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that i should not reign over them and i if i have a title i'd like to title or just speak on the rejected king this morning amen is it okay to preach on jesus i know it's okay to preach on jesus here so let's look to the lord in prayer most gracious heavenly father we just thank you for all that you do for us we thank you for another day that you've given us may we rejoice and be glad in it father no the lord we just thank you for your word we thank you for the time the privilege to be able to come behind the sacred desk and minister your word one more time but father i just pray that you would help me to get out of the way to let your word come forth oh god for there's nothing good in me but lord you're all good there's nothing uh there's nothing about you that isn't good and and you're the one that we want to lean on today and every day every hour and uh just again i thank you for the patience that you have for us we we thank you for the long suffering for we make many mistakes where we have that human element that gets in our way all the time and uh lord we just pray that you would forgive us of every sin every iniquity o god that would be displeasing unto you and uh that we can come forth and have a confidence to receive what we have need of from you today those that would be sick and afflicted we pray that you would touch them in their bodies as you as you have touched me in my body so many times on god i know that thou art healer and i know that you were more than able to to touch those situations oh god and lord i'm about to turn into a baby i just thank you so much for for your healing hand that you've placed upon me and my family and the different ones that's that's close to me and i just thank you for that lord i know that you're more than able to meet the needs so father help me guide me guard my lips i wouldn't speak anything contrary but lord made may be a blessing to your people that for that's always been my desire that's that's a that's a whole thing that that i want to do is just just to be a blessing to the people and uh lord we just uh ask all things in the name of jesus christ amen maybe see thank you very much i'm just going to go ahead and get comfortable in the saddle here kind of hard to fight with a jacket on i say that because brother jim says that often but uh we see here with samuel that he's he's uh he was sulking a little bit uh and and as i said rightly so uh because he knew what they were asking and he didn't think that they really knew what they were asking so he was he was kind of sulking that heaven i've been here i've been here with you all these years uh have i deceived you out of uh have i deceived you out of money have i deceived you out of any cattle or anything like that have i not prophesied have i not spoken everything unto the lord of what he said unto me to do that i have prophesied and it's come to pass so why do you want a king you have god to rule over you so he's seeing that they're changing from the spiritual over to the natural they're giving up on the supernatural they're giving up on the spiritual and they're wanting to take on the natural things so you want a worldly ruler you're going to live by his rules you're under his authority now jesus taught us that render unto caesar what a caesar and render unto god what is god so be careful what you asked for and he's trying to tell the people the the jews that be careful what you're asking for i don't think you understand what you're asking for because once you get this king do you not know what he's going to do to you he's going to take all your people because they have to of course it's going to create a lot of jobs but you know we could kind of see that in something like that in this day hey we need jobs we need people to get paid for but they're going to take the people the king is going to take the people because they need um people to make the armor and the swords and all that for the for the warriors they they need uh food for the army so the confectionaries are going to need cooks they're going to need maids they're going to need all these things and they're going to put them in as servants and they're going to take the people from your families and so he's trying to try to have them reconsider their thought but the lord said don't worry about that they're not rejecting you samuel it's me that they're rejecting if they if that's what they want i'm going to give them what they want they're going to pay for it later amen so so out of their stubbornness of their heart they rejected him once again you know we see all through from the time of moses and and even from the beginning of time that he was rejected over and over all the way to to revelation it's just rejection after rejection after rejection but he has a mind of mercy to con to take them back eventually when they repent for it amen but they they still have that rejection and sometimes we do that because brother branham taught us that you know in order to believe the devil's lie you've got to step over god's word to believe the devil's lie is that right so we have a rejection when we do the things that we want to do and and you have that little voice incentive don't do that you shouldn't be doing that you know you you need to go over here just stay away from that you know that that's that conscious that we got to thank god for that we have that amen but see i'm i'm sure that uh kind of if you go back and read a little bit i think it might be the first and second verse it's talking about the how the suns were were taken taking advantage of the people uh they were deceiving so the people were probably tired of of seeing that is this the legacy of samuel that we're going to have to rule over us when samuel dies you know we want something else so i can kind of see where where where they're thinking about the the future but their mind mind was on something carnal a what man was going to rule over us not realizing that it was the spirit of god in samuel that was rolling over them it wasn't samuel that was doing the ruling but it was the spirit within sin how easily we overlook those things because we look through it through a carnal mind and not a spiritual mind see sometimes as ministers we we might feel that well the people just aren't listening to me i just wasted my time with these people you know we ought not to think like that i hope we don't think like that i don't think like that but uh usually it's the other way but you know some people get to why do i even bother to preach nobody's listening to me they're turning away but if i can only preach like so and so if i could get the people excited see people we just want the entertainment value sometimes and that's what we look forward to and and some of the ministers you know brother daryl ward i i think highly of the brother he's got a lot of stuff in him he's just a wonderful minister and he blesses my heart but he's charismatic he gets people excited you get jumping and shouting but i've been in a couple where there weren't there wasn't so much jumping and shouting were we still blessed absolutely we were still blessed so it doesn't have to come that way every single service amen it's what you get from the lord it's what you put into the service is what you're going to get out of the service amen it's not the man it's it's you pulling on the gift of the man it's not the man coming forth amen but it's what you pull from it so you can convince you you just can't convince a man when he's got his mind made up you cannot convince a man otherwise so when they had their mind made up samuel god just said you know what they've got their mind made up give it to him samuel give it to him but you know only if i could preach like so and so you know but sometimes i i don't even i don't even think i'm that good enough to preach you know i'm not that great great of a minister but and i struggled with that so many some for so many years i struggled with that oh if i can only preach like so-and-so and just get the people excited because i wanted the people to get so blessed but i had to finally had to come to terms with that i think i said it here and i think it was when brother darrell ward was preaching and right in the middle of his sermon it had nothing to do with what he was preaching on he just came out and said you can't preach like so and so you have to do it according to your gift and wow that just hit me like a ton of bricks and i think it was shortly after that and brother andy's saying a song about uh how all the people how god's people want to be around the table but nobody wants to go out and work in the field and and that it was all around that time i think and that's when i i was ordained as a minister i just said forget it you know what i'm just going to go with it and uh if the lord's going to keep blessing it then the lord's going to bless it so kind of a side note but getting back to the ministers and the charismatic you know we look for that as an entertainment value because it might help us keep us awake i don't know uh because of somebody's monotone they're just speaking reading reading your stories and it just kind of allows you to sleep uh heat for me it just puts if if it's real warm it just about puts me to sleep you know uh it's it's nothing of the nothing of the preacher because i'm enjoying what the preacher saying so if you fall asleep i understand you know some people were just tired if you work all week you know i understand but i've heard some great speakers that you know so preach some marvelous messages that don't even serve the lord anymore so it's not in the it's not in the charisma of the man so we cannot look at man so we have to look at the spirit and the motive of what's being preached amen see i'm i'm just putting myself as a target now you're going to critique the whole thing you should you should be paying attention to what i'm saying yeah no but when people don't want to hear the word they're not rejecting us they're they're rejecting the lord just as samuel said or just as god told samuel they're not rejecting you they're rejecting me and some people just can't they just don't want to hear the word but some people some people in the message they want to give a denominational uh person at the time of day oh oh you go to you go to the denominational church i'm kind of done with this conversation because i i know where that's got to lead you and i don't agree with you and they just cut them out you know and they just they just consider it well it's us for no more you know you know but i'd rather be in a house meeting with with the lord blessing and the gifts working then then you know with with the uh the gifts of god in operation and then in the finest building you know and packed full with dead people and a dead servant say man but you know there are some people that they just wouldn't recognize the word if you loaded it in a double barrel shotgun and gave them a good old pentecostal holy ghost blast with the shotgun they still won't see it you know uh it's it's just it's just the way it is uh some people can see it some people cannot some people who are ordained to to eternal life and some people are ordained to uh eternal death eternal separation but you know but we want to be where the spirit is for where the spirit is there is liberty right so that's my desire but we want to be like other people something you know and it's okay to have an influence of other people and try to be uh like somebody else you know brother brandon talked about uh you have a neighbor that paints her house well all of a sudden you just go through the neighborhood they're going to paint their their their porch steps the same color as the neighbors porch steps and you know trying to be like the joneses and he he thought about if or he talked about if there was a a woman that wore a certain hat the church uh that you just watch about a week later if it's available if they can find another hat that's exactly like like it or uh closely resembles it they're gonna be wearing the same type of hat he said you just watch and because people just want to be like other people uh in some cases so they i mean like i said it's okay to pattern ourselves after people it's okay to have an influence of somebody else as long as it's a righteous person somebody that loves the word somebody that's dedicated and loyal to the word of god right man that's who we should pattern ourselves after is uh to be like jesus is is the one that we ought to be like you know we have these fads in this day uh and it's always been that way uh like brother brandon was talking about the hat uh i remember back when i was younger do you remember the exercise clothes you know the polyester uh exercise clothes you know everybody with sport those you know the exercise pants uh you know it was just nice to wear i used to like them i got into that too but now they have these goofy things called skinny jeans i don't even know what that is i mean they got to hold them up somebody's got to hold them up for them so they could jump into things i don't even know how they get them on those are some goofy looking clothes i don't know and they've got these daisy dukes daisy dukes have been around for a long time if you don't know what daisy dukes is it's a term after dukes of hazard uh the woman's name is daisy and she wore some real short shorts and you know that that's still popular in this day you see these girls wearing these short shorts and they hardly cover anything that a pair of underwear would cover more than what they got on you know those those real short shorts you know it's it it's just a it's just the way that it is do you ever notice that if you watch weather or the news or something like that they got men dressed to the hilt you know suit suit jacket you know tie and everything and here they got a woman in a skimpy dress now tell me that this isn't a sex age everything's directed toward the woman the woman the woman see they're rejecting god and now who's who's the god it's a goddess now because it's a woman they're always putting a woman on a platform you drive by a billboard what's on it it's some sexual relation to a woman sitting on that billboard because that's what they want your focus to be on right because that type of thing sells right it's perversion it draws to a man's desire which has drawn so many men away and and all this pornography in this day and that's what it is it's a scaled-down uh form of pornography when you when they're posting these women in bikinis on there it's a it's a slimmed-down form of pornography that's absolutely what it is it's a nakedness and people might be watching i don't know they might uh whatever i like to look at that stuff well that just shows that there's something wrong with you you got to get your heart right but we have all these fads that are going on and like i said we ought to pattern ourselves after somebody that's righteous so pattern ourselves after the word of god amen so where did the term christian come from everybody here i'm sure knows it's it's a term christ like that's why they were called christian you go to you go to uh florida and the people that are uh that live in florida are called what floridians right people that live in pennsylvania were pennsylvanians uh people that live in ohio ohioans so if we're in christ we ought to be christian right amen so um but we are the ones that ought to be different we pray before we eat we go to church to hear the word before we do anything else we put it we set it as a precedence we have it first before sports or anything else dancing dance class ballet or or whatever it might be gymnastics we put the word of god first we go to church first and you ever notice when you do when we we try to have our boys into sports and and i think hope hope and shy they played softball for a little bit why is it that they always have to have it all wednesday and then they want to start having everything on sunday but that's what makes us different is that we don't go into those things we put god first because we want to hear the word of god amen we don't want to pattern ourselves after the world is that right so uh like i said we pray before we eat we go to church to hear the word uh it's set as a precedence we forgive people when they do the unthinkables all right and we pray for people even if they're not our friends even if they've despisedly despitefully used us in some way we still pray for them if they ask how many people have come to you you're not real friends with them but they know you're christian and and they don't want to they don't want to be a christian because it's boring but have a have a hard time in their house one time who are they going to come to hey uh would you pray for me and my family what i i thought you didn't believe in god now you're asking for prayer they know where to go to so you keep on doing what you're doing amen because they you're being salty they see something in your life and that's the only avenue that they know to go because they can't do they can't find anything else that works amen but we try to be compassionate where others think that you should leave it alone because uh they feel that uh they deserve what they're going through they shouldn't have done what they did but how many mistakes do we make amen and then we plead to god in prayer oh lord god forgive me i didn't mean to do that but some people that's just good enough oh lord forgive me because i drank this and and so on and so and i did this and that and then turn right around and go back and do the same thing the next day or the next week or the next month oh my god but we are called out people we're peculiar we're a holy nation not a country not a nation as a country but as a united people that's what makes a nation is a people are united that's what makes a nation so uh a royal priesthood like that slave man that held his head high you know when the the the the auction was going on and and i i hate to bring this up because i don't like slavery but i i like how uh it came up of how brother branham talked about it that uh he came to this man and there was something different about that man and he asked if he if they fed him any different well he said no we don't feed him any different well do you treat him any different does he have different quarters or and you know do you just pacify him or do you do you nurture him nope we don't do anything different but he acts that way because he found or he knows that he is the son of a king amen so we ought to conduct ourselves in the same way knowing that we are the son of a king or a daughter of a king amen but we are not to be of the world or look like the world or smell like the world or even act like the world we were to be christian christ-like you know i can't even put you i think of the three hebrew children that went into the fiery furnace you know their their clothes weren't weren't uh burnt their hair wasn't singed there wasn't anything that was even wrong and even to the fine detail that it says they didn't even smell like smoke i can't i'm telling you brother sister i can't even load my wood stuff i can't even open the door and look in to see if it's okay without smelling like smoke i don't have to be in there it's just in the presence of the smoke so if they were in the fire and they couldn't even smell like smoke there was a presence in there amen there had to have been something there to even keep the keep the smell off of them oh we accept god's word his spirit his love and his chastening oh my those he loves he chastens how many likes to be chasing oh i don't like that whooping when it comes but i thank you lord for the correction you know because it puts you right back on track amen but we're not like cain who loved the creation more than the creator see cain rejected god's word when god plainly told him to if he did as abel did that he would do well is that right he said if you do what abel did then you're doing fine but if you don't sin lies at the doors all right so he gave him the choice he told him what the ultimatum was he told him what the outcome was going to be but cain still rejected his word and went the way that he wanted it to go is that right and then he went on to kill him because we know he was of a different kind he we know he was of a different breed is that right and it was jealousy that drove him to it he refused to do what was right he rejected what was right right he didn't want to be compared to abel because abel was a humble man and cain didn't want to be that he wanted to be the cool guy well i'm going to do something different you know it's just too boring to be on the straight and narrow path you know i want some excitement in my life but we know that he wasn't of god is that right we know that abel could accept uh what god had for the direction we know that abel was pleasing in the sight of god rebellion uh as we're told i i think it's in samuel or somewhere around there rebellion is as witchcraft now you might you might not get you get your candles together or whatever all your rocks or whatever it might be and and you might not be in or casting all these spells and and thinking about that but it's likened unto witchcraft when you are rebellious it's just like you're doing that same thing now is there one sin greater than the other no there is not one sin greater than the other sin is black sin is sin and that's it oh my give me a second i'm getting old and i'm getting out of shape round is a shape as a friend of mine at work says you know her co-worker he says round is a shape i'm in shape he's just funny but he can accept this condition we're all like you need to change your lifestyle you know this is bad for you and then he asked for help one time you know he he asked for help hey if you see me eating this knock it out of my hand so there was a fellow co-worker that obliged him so lo and behold somebody had donuts the next morning here he had a doughnut grabbed one on his merry way pow what'd you do that for you asked for help i'm giving it to you so you better be careful what you asked for you know if you really want help then accept the help that somebody's giving you amen but praise the lord i've been healed like i was saying i've been healed several times several times you know there for a little while i was going through some struggles you know what was that down to 130 135 pounds i think somewhere around there and i'm usually at 165 that's where i like to be i like to be at my optimum weight and praise god the other day i weighed myself i was 165 pounds i weighed myself this morning 164 pounds so i'm back up to my optimum weight so i know that god is a healer and that's one of the things that they say uh it goes right along with crohn's you see crohn's patients you know that uh you know they go through it because they they don't have an appetite so they lose a lot of weight and that's one of the things with with crohn's patients and i feel bad for those crohn's patients and uh i'm not one of them and uh i just thank god that i think of my brother too because uh you know he's been he's been battling cancer since 2010 and uh it started off with uh colorectal cancer and he's been battling it and i remember i went down and i got to that was the first time i got to pray with my brother i took a bible down for him we prayed over a cloth i gave him the cloth matter of fact i think it was off a dress shirt that i had because i was so pressed that i i just ripped the pocket off my shirt because i didn't have anything else and uh and i took it down to him and i got to pray with him and uh my my sister-in-law was telling us uh when they were up when when david was up they got to visit with him too and uh i'm trying not to get emotional but uh i was so happy that my brother came up to to see us i was just so happy but uh he's he's not skinny like me where he used to be skinnier than me um and he's over 202 he's what 212 i think something sorry brother uh kind of giving away his personal stuff but uh usually you don't see that in in cancer patients usually you see them very skinny and uh and because they're fighting you know their body is just fighting but my sister-in-law she told us i was so determined that my husband was not going to look like these these other cancer patients i'm going to do something different she fit like three scoops of ice cream every night so he's kind of on the other end of the spectrum which which is a good thing i'd rather see weight on him than than being skinny but i i just believe god is still working and working in his life amen i've not given up on him as long as there's still breath in his body i'm not giving up on him amen so i just thank the lord i just think it's all the prayers that's keeping him because he still works he still works full-time you know i think i've said it here before uh but he went in and saw the doctor well how many hours a week are you working you know uh 10 12 15 hours a week no 40 hours a week that's unheard of nobody works 40 hours a week you know nobody nobody works that much when they're undergoing uh chemotherapy radiation and all that stuff you know this is this is unbelievable well that's my god that's all i got to say that's all i have to say about that is that that's my god that i believe he's helping my brother and he's going to heal and i just believe that i so believe that but you know people say well it's hard how can you do that but you know uh be following the way of the lord it's a hard thing to do you know because people look at us at us differently you know people well that's so boring following all these rules and all that and then while you follow rules too you know if if you're walking freely you you're you've got to be following some rules too because if you weren't following them you'd be in jail but that's not why we follow the rules we follow the rules because we know that's what pleases god and we want to do what's pleasing unto him amen or you say well it's hard no the way of a transgressor is hard jesus said take my yoke upon you for my yoke is easy and my burden is light amen and we he said you shall find rest to your souls amen but when we yield to him we are not blinded by the things of the world we we don't become distracted amen kind of like samson now samson he took a different approach he got distracted because he was he was distracted by women and remember when i said a little bit ago that women is a distraction now women are up there put up there for mental worship amen so the the same it was a very weakness for samson because he was so focused on women right that's what took his heart from the lord be careful brothers yes be careful sisters that is not a man or a woman that's taking you away from the presence of the lord don't reject god over a human human being amen i see we know that we were taught that samsa gave god his muscles he gave him the gift that that god gave him he gave it to him in return as far as the muscles the strength as long as he didn't cut his hair as long as he followed that one thing he was good to go but he did not give god his heart all right amen i see look at samson when he was captured what did they do they took his eye out right they took his eyes out both of them why so he couldn't see his way for his escape he couldn't find his way he wouldn't be able to find his way out of there unless he was led by somebody amen didn't remember he even had to be be asked to be led to the two pillars that held up the building now nahash uh now see this seems to be a thing with the with the enemy nahash oh i can't remember where it is and uh i was with king david anyways but he wanted to take out the right right eye out of the metal oh this was right yeah it was right it was in samuel because it was right before uh saul took was was put in as king uh now nahash he wanted to take out the right eye the men of israel because it was a treaty he says you know what i'm going to do this because he wanted to embarrass israel he said you know what i want to pluck out the right eye of all your men of israel because he wanted to embarrass him as i said but now see that's what the enemy is trying to do is put the right eye out of god's people you notice you do you know what the right eye uh indicates the right that's the one that's spiritual now so you remember me talking about uh raising up a standard about how uh in in military uh the person that has a the the person that has has the authority the higher ranking individual walks on the right even our nation's flag it's on its own right which is a place of honor in the place of authority and jesus christ was raised up onto the right hand of the father is that right so right the right side shows authority it shows honor so it's spiritual this has ought to be our our spiritual eye ought to be the one that has the authority not the left eye to lead us astray man but our spiritual life ought to be leading us into the truth is that right but if he could put the spiritual sight out of your eye where you see the natural things and not the spiritual things he's got you whip right there long as you have churches and big places and find intellectual dressed people and so forth as long as your eye looks on looks on that and don't see the spiritual side the enemy's got you under his control because you don't know where you're going amen see we can get on board with things so easily that we become blinded to the way that is right not the way this seems to be right that's what the devil does is he blinds the people from seeing the way to their freedom he blinds them from it but you know he can only deceive the elect if possible see if the devil can't keep you from seeing a truth he will push you overboard with it see we got these little pet doctrines that that go around it it's nothing new they've had it way back when it's been going for years see the spirit doesn't die it's a it's a continual spirit that we have to continue to fight amen let's see we like i said we've got these doctrines uh they start with truth the basis is built upon truth but they go on and they're pushed overboard with that truth so much that all they see is that one part of the doctrine putting a period on what they believe and they say it's us born no more and they leave off the rest of the blessings of god amen they can't go in any further they stop it right there because of that one doctrine that one little thing that they keep as pets and if you'd preached under his hair well you didn't have church if you don't preach peruser here well you didn't have well what about the rest of the bible you're right it's truth but go on to perfection it's growing it's going on to profession which is maturity you don't stop at the age of 13 at the start of puberty no you go on to become a man you go on to become a woman a full mature being amen you don't stop right here well look at well i'm going to embarrass myself well look at that i'm starting to become a man i've got a hair there i started puberty well i'm going to stop right there i'm a man now no you've got some growing and learning to do to become a man trust me amen amen praise the lord but the rejected king now notice when temptation came with joseph in the house of potiphar right he was in the privacy of the room it was just him and potter for his wife now they probably could have done whatever she wanted to do and nobody probably would have ever found out but he didn't just sit try to convince her the one time or the you know just one time oh okay you know i tried to convince you but you know i'll give him this one time nope what did he do it went to it's so far detailed that he said he ran and he ran so fast that she tried to get a hold of him that she got a hold of his coat right and that's what she used against him but when that temptation comes it's not the temptation that sin it's when you give in to the temptation that becomes sin you're stepping over the word of god to believe the devil's lie because you're blinded in one eye that spiritual eye has been plucked yes sir that you don't know where you're going [Laughter] amen you don't know you're not paying attention to the right path you know the there's a straight and narrow path that we not need to follow and for broad is the way to that leads to destruction when you go to the right or when you go to the left when you say well i don't need to follow and i can just step over this guard at this line right here and i'll be okay like brother brandon said we ought not to push the limits just to see how far we can go we just need to stay as far away from it as possible so the the further side from the right and the further side from the left is right in the center amen right in the middle of the road is all right so as long as we stay center we stay focused on god we don't reject him we don't refuse him when he comes in and says do such and such for so-and-so what don't you know what he done did to me last week i got an art against that brother well if you got that art in there you ought to take care of that amen and take care of that art and get it out of there it ought not to be there amen amen but joseph was of the supernatural right that right and he was rejected by his brothers because he was of the supernatural the natural cannot deal with the supernatural right it's jealousy just as we saw with cain and abel we see the jealousy there the same thing we see it's the same kindred spirit that that with joseph his brothers they could not handle him because he was a dreamer they didn't like the dreams that he was having not knowing that it was actually going to come to pass and they were going to have to get humbled that it was going to come to pass amen that all they know is they wanted to get rid of joseph they rejected him as a brother and they sold him into slavery it was better than killing him but he was in god's hands because god saw further down the road than what man can see amen so just because you're going through a little bit of troubles don't worry god might have something for you later down the road amen it's just a little while hold on a little bit longer joy comes in the morning is that right it might get dark and bleak right now but morning cometh amen and i'm looking forward to that morning time morning's coming don't you worry amen praise god the natural mind doesn't understand the spiritual the carnal mind is enmity against god is that right that's what we're taught in the scripture but it's so hard for for so much of us that we look through the carnal mind that we can't see the spiritual things happening so then it becomes with the with the right eye that we can't see the spiritual things that we don't believe that god is with us anymore because we don't see the miracles well what's your spiritual life like amen you've gone off to the right you've gone off to the left what is it whichever way it is but you fell off from the center you've taken your eye off first corinthians 3 and chapter 3 and verse 3 it says for you are ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying in strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men for while once said i am of paul and another i am of apollos are you not carnal because you're saying oh i'm of jesse smith i'm of jim schumacher i'm a cam smith i'm a donny reagan i'm i'm of jason watkins it's not the man that it that blesses your soul amen it's the word of god that comes forth that sets you free so we've got to get out of that carnology and get into the spirituality and get our mind focused on christ amen who then is paul who then is jesse who then is brian we are nothing and you ask us and we're gonna tell you that because like i said at the beginning i don't even think i should be i don't even think i'm worthy to be here but for some reason god still put something in my heart a minute the pastors keep calling me to come administer for them amen i don't know what i'm doing i'm just being honest with you but who then is paul and who is apollos you ever think that these men felt the same way that we do brother that i am so insufficient i don't even know but i just feel something in my heart i don't know what you have need of but something in my heart i had no idea what i was going to preach usually i get ready and you know i have thoughts and i'll get something but this came yesterday and i was praying and lord i don't know what to preach and then yeah i think it was yesterday i was trying to get to studying monday that or excuse me friday night and distraction came after distraction i'm trying to so i'm trying to go through things i'm reading things and then i i think it was yesterday morning well okay i just felt the leading so i pray this blesses you i pray this is something that you need because i have no idea and i love it like that i don't even tell my family what i preach i don't let the song leader at home i don't i don't let brother jim know what i'm preaching but when it comes forth that somebody sings a song that's directly related to the message and you get done preaching and somebody says i absolutely needed that uh we were just talking about this yesterday it's the holy spirit that i want to get addicted to that i want i i want the holy spirit to lead me amen i don't know what your problems are i don't know what you're thinking about i don't know what your discussions are behind the door oh my you just go back to the old testament where the prophet kept saying uh coming forth and telling the king hey they're planning on doing this well who's in our secret chambers who's the spying here telling them what they're doing it was the holy ghost amen so i pray that the holy ghost is moving this morning speaking to your heart amen because i have no idea so who then is paul and who is apollos but ministers by whom ye believed even as the lord gave to every man i have planted apollos watered see and it just goes to show that we need one another one ministry needs the other ministry meets the other ministry to make the whole ministry amen but god gave the increase what you mean paul and apollos and jesse and cam and all these different brothers that matt leitner and the different ones it wasn't them that gave the increase no we're just vessels in god's hand to be used amen we are his mouthpiece and the same thing for you it's not limited to just ministers it also goes to you amen but god gives an increase you yield to him your gifts amen he will increase it amen so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that watereth but god that giveth the increase now he that planteth and he that watereth are one they move as one we have to be in the right in the same mind one mind one accord preaching the same thing not different things not the not the desires of our heart of what we want to preach bringing out our pet doctrines or whatever but it's as of a whole to bless the whole body of christ it works together as one and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor yes the different ministers are going to receive their own reward for whatever you know there's time that has to be put into to studying time to be uh to be praying and not talking to to uh the whole congregation hey what's growing and so-and-so i'm going through right now hey what's sister sue going through right now oh did you hear about this did you hear about that no it's getting in prayer and that's a start but entrusting and believing that god is going to take that situation under control amen and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor see it's not the man but the spirit in the man sometimes it's hard for people to to distinguish the difference between the two because they love to hear the man preach so much and uh oh man they bring this this much so uh i love the way they preach it i love the way brother jesse preaches i love his teaching i love the way our pastor preaches i love the way that uh brother wayne lost the preachers my goodness that that man is a machine gun preacher he says pow and it's done you know i don't know where he gets the energy oh my goodness i'd be so out of breath i'd probably pass out on the floor with that brother the way that brother preaches but oh my but see everyone you take a little bit here and there here a little there little precept upon precept line upon line it all works together for the good of one amen now who do you think you are [Laughter] amen praise god i lost my place where was i all right give me a second i'm 46 now and i don't exercise that's a terrible thing isn't it along with that weight i've kind of gained a little bit a little bit of girth i was teasing my wife so you're doing the laundry wrong something i don't know what you're doing right because my pants don't fit i think it was something with i knew she wasn't going to shrink leather that much but my belt it wasn't fitting right either so i knew it'd have to be me but i just thank god i just thank him amen because that means me gaining weight that means i'm doing well by god's grace but getting back under the carnality our carnality is what gets in the way is that right because it's a human element that gets in the way that when we have disagreement that we separate from each other is that right because our pet doctrines we don't see eye to eye on certain things but but brother branham says that out of the rejected king he says this he says but they didn't want it that way they wanted a king they wanted to be like the rest of the world and when the pentecostal church the holy spirit first fell about 50 something years ago if they would have just let it alone and let god add to the church see god give it the increase but when man tries to do something they just muddle everything up so if they just left it alone and let god give the increase that and let god enter the church daily such as would be saved just like it was in the day and day in the first pentecost it would have been like it was in the apostolic age but we had to draw fences oh my god excuse me he says we had to be like the rest of them we had to if a methodist was a denomination then we we must be one too and here comes somebody alone said jesus is coming on a white cloud and no no he's coming on a white horse all right we'll just separate i'll get me a group and you get your group over here there you are you just drove drew the line somewhere and you separated yourselves over your carnality over one pet doctrine that just kept you from the rest of the blessings of god amen what difference does it make if he's he's coming anyhow and i love this thought that he has right here he's coming anyhow and it don't matter how he's coming the thing is is are you ready to go with him when he comes that's the main thing it doesn't matter how he comes what form he comes in let's just be ready to go amen but they'll split hairs on on any little bitty thing and form another organization and that's just the way the world did it and the rejected king they rejected him over a pet doctrine over carnality amen and that's what we think what we've got today is people rejecting the king persecution is happening again over in foreign pastors and and parishioners are like are being put to death and in prison is that right you see this happening more and more i had to hear a story almost every single day about over in a foreign country somewhere that there's a pastor here that's been been slayed oh they cut they they beheaded him or whatever it was or they put him in prison and when they put him in prison they don't treat him very well but i'm seeing the persecution happen more and more over there so here i'm i don't know if this is a squeeze or not but it's it's even coming onto our own soil amen i see it in our own country and it upsets me to where i know it's supposed to happen they're picking our constitution apart you know they got a group out there called the freedom from religion well i hate to type well i'd love to tell you this we gotta we got something in our constitution that says freedom of religion not freedom from religion that's a whole that's a wonderful thing about freedom is if you have a choice or you have that choice to say oh i want that or no i don't want that that's a wonderful thing about freedom isn't it well guess what they're starting to trample on that constitution they're starting to start picking it apart do i like it nope i don't like it at all but i know it's supposed to happen i know it's supposed to come but that doesn't mean i stopped signing crying over over the abominations of the world amen i know it's coming and about enrages me when i see it happen now see it's just the time that we're living in it's supposed to happen right it's the time lunacy reigns among us this is eight brother branham told us how many years ago that it was going to be it was a psychotic age we know these people are losing their minds you look at what they want to do what what crazy person was allowed to do that who passed that you know it's crazy they're thinking of what they're doing yes sir but then i remember this one little thought how brother branham said that yo honey that's just the way it is in this country they're they're americans yes we're american by birth in this country but we have another land we're from another world amen i get to thinking this world is not my home [Laughter] i have a home and a land whose builder and maker is god amen it was not made by natural hands but with the carnality of man give me another thing i have a treadmill that broke that's on the back of my trailer so donations welcome just just kidding i'm just kidding i need to get outside more well praise god the carnality of how people look at man you know moses was a portion of god and it's funny how that works because they didn't look as as as moses uh as god you know they they kind of rejected moses but there was a time on uh when he when he came down after the the the the ten commandments where he was bailed and they said let moses talk to us and not god now see moses had a portion of being god and he said that aaron shall be your mouthpiece is that right aaron should be your prophet and he said moses you shall be as god you shall be god so when you speak it's just like me speaking amen so but they wanted moses to speak to them because they knew that it was more merciful for moses to speak to them because there was judgment in god's mouth ready to judge the people is that right so when he came down he had that veil on his face that there was so much there was something about him that they couldn't even look upon his face that they had to put a veil on his face now as as i was saying that moses was a portion of god he was he was accepted when everything was all convenient and everything was uh going nice and smooth he was accepted but as soon as as soon as they saw the egyptians coming this soldier's coming moses what did you do to us there was a little bit of hardship coming their way and they could accept moses as long as everything was on a flowery bed of ease but hold on you're going to go through a time of famine you're going to go through a time of of abundance so just hold on stay with your pastor you might go through some hard times but stay with it put it in prayer amen you're gonna go through some hard times as a christian yeah but hold on it's just for a little while don't come to church just because you see the blessings of god raining down and then when you see a dry spell not come to church you come to church anyhow because you love god amen that's what was so hard at brother branham's age is that they wanted they were flocking just to see the miracles happen but when it came time for the word to come forth it started dropping off you know when the seriousness comes it's going to show i've said this for a while have communion night see who shows up it's going to be a minimal show unless you have a lot of people that really have a desire to get closer to god but when it comes time for a vote brother i'm telling you the place is packed out because they want to have a say in it it's true i've seen it wow soon as soon as communion time comes it's scarce you hardly have anybody's show guess we ought to be careful what kind of spirit we have huh you can only hide it for so long it's going to show forth and like i said as soon as the vote comes place is packed out because oh you're not going to have a say it here without my vote it's that carnality oh my yep that's a hard thing to say it's a hard thing for me to say but it's true yes sir yes sir oh my if some people saw that saw me say that statement online i don't know we probably won't be friends but that's okay i'll stand by what i said amen yo and i don't take away from those that if they're not right and they're still working things in their life sometimes people just don't show but you'll see the habitual ones that they make it a point that they don't show let me separate that right now because some people might be going things going through things and uh just because they show don't show up one night in community oh we know what that spirit that brothers of well he might be working some things out or sister you know he or she might be working some things out and it's better for him to stay home than it is to come and partake unworthily right because your heart has to be right before you partake of communion service so don't take one circumstance or if somebody doesn't show up you know you've got to pray for them you've got to a a a terry one for another is that right you've got to pray one for another they might be going through something that's where you oh lord help help them to come to communion i want to see them here my desire is to see them here help them make right whatever is there amen we all go through some dry times we all do right we all do yes sir i don't even know what time it is i thought this was going to be short david was another type of of christ is that right yeah through kingship david was another one that was was rejected yeah there was one time that a man you know uh not exactly like me but i i don't like to see where my government's going i don't like to see where the leader's going so this man he didn't like how how the government was going he didn't like how david was leading things and he made it known and he spat on king david is that right so there was a guard there and said how dare that man come and spit on my king he wanted to take the head off of him is that right to defend his king that's how much he felt uh to defend his king but david said no no no don't do that he said god told him to do that oh my god but that was a show of rejection that was a show of exactly what was going to happen to christ through his walk to calvary they spat on him they pulled his beard they did all kinds of stuff they rejected that king on that day and you know david even in his own household and it still types christ even in his own household he was rejected absalom wanted to take the kingdom the kingship from from david is that right so we know that even with jesus well i think it's in zechariah 18 or something like that where it says uh that through the suffering uh where did you get this and it was typed as jesus as jesus being rejected in his own house suffering wounds from the house of his friends amen i think it's in zechariah and uh where did you get those wounds how did you get like this it was in the house of my friends you know if you were friends with the world you're an enemy of god but jesus said i no longer call you servants but i call you friends so let's not give the wounds in his hands but in the house of his friends amen i think of those times and you know i was thinking of this a topic anyway of a message you know or just a thought is it worth another blow because you know and this is off my notes but you know i i think it was when brother brandon was he was in that casino or whatever and he saw that that uh law enforcement officer with that woman and they were just cutting up and carrying on and he was saying how lord can you put up with this stank of sin and uh and then he went into the into the room off to himself and the lord showed him in a vision of what he does of the sin that that brother branham did and he said what happens is your sin just goes and it's like a bumper and it's just and it's just another blow another blow and i just can't help think of uh uh when we do our faults and our failures and and then i just picture christ on the cross whenever we sin it's just another blow upon christ it says that's another slap on him on his face and or his walk to calvary however you want to picture it it's just another blow on christ the one that died for us it's just another blow onto the one that saved us it's just another blow under the one that redeemed us amen how rich and mercy he must be to continually forgive us every single day of our lives and every minute how much how many mistakes do you make but we continue on we pick up to carry on the fight amen but it's something that we can think about oh if i do this what's it going to do to him is this going to be something worthy is this going to be something that's going to be edifying to my brother or my sister is it going to be another blow on christ that saved me is it going to be another blow on that bumper oh my goodness oh praise god jews would always turn to other gods is that right to idols they would always do that and it was always in the time that that things are going good and they got bored of of of of going to worship or whatever going to the temple of god or worship whatever it might have been but it seemed like they always turned to an idol and then they got rebuked for it and then they were forgiven for it and then they were put right back on track and it's just like us we make mistakes don't follow after idols just because things are quiet doesn't mean that god cease to exist in the old testament they set things aside because they were supposed to teach their children is that right they were supposed to tell them the tales of what happened in their day this is what the lord has done for us for us this is how he delivered us and we have all these things to teach the children but when the time came for the children to grow up they didn't understand those stories those they no they heard of it oh that was just fables that are told that our parents told us uh so that we would obey them or whatever it might be but it's because they didn't have the experience they couldn't go off or their parents experience they had to find out from their own experience amen amen and god's existence isn't contingent on what we say or not god exists no matter what we say amen i've got our clubs here i'm gonna come too close give me a second you know just because god doesn't answer your prayer the way you wanted him to answer that prayer doesn't mean he didn't hear you his ways are above our ways is that right it doesn't mean that we have to have a temper tantrum and throw a fit because that shows what kind of spirit we we have on us it shows that we really don't have the faith in god you know like i said he his ways are above our ways he sees something in the future that he has planned for us so it just might not be time yet everything comes in its own time there's a time to reap and there's a time to sow there's a time to gather stones there's a time to cast away stones is that right so it's all in god's timing amen brother bran says this he says and when you die remember it doesn't change your spirit it only changes your dwelling place and whatever type of spirit you've got in you that's the place it will go to and sin could never enter heaven is that right he says well you say well i confess mine every night we got a prayer book and when we go to church we confess all of our sins and turn right back around and do them again turn right back the next day god forgive me for drinking forgive me for committing adultery forgive me for lying forgive me for stealing and turn right back and do the same thing forgive me for getting drunk last week i didn't mean to drink that much turn right back and drink it again see that's what i call a a bull and goat repentance amen that was old-time repentance where they could and they could go bring their offering they'd be forgiven of what they did and then the next day they'd be right back to what they were doing amen it wasn't the remission of sins where christ came when he came when he was sacrificed it was for the remission of our sins that took away the very desire of our sins so when you come with repentance don't let it be if a bull and goat repentance but let it be a full christ like repentance amen amen let it be that born-again repentance that born-again experience amen he says when you want to live worldly all week then come to church and act all righteous you reject the king he is a lord over your life it's just a constant rejection that shows that something hasn't changed inside you're trying to paint the outside kind of whitewash it but it what needs to be done is the blood of christ and washed white instead of white washed that's what the world needs today amen see he's to reject the king and let him not be rejected in our own lives so we have to be careful amen so in closing i think see see as he was saying see people want him as as their savior but they don't want him as their lord they don't want him ruling over their love their lives when he comes in uh he'll govern you and control you and a lot of people don't want that they just want to go on their merry way with anyone or without anyone meddling in their own lives now see not everyone can see him is that right so only people only some people would accept jesus ministry while others rejected him even while they were supposedly looking for the same thing now brother bran says he says but in the old testament in genesis 1 in the beginning god the word is used elohim elohim means the self-existing one right we know that you're taught that right so what a difference a word elohim is so our word god elohim means a self-existing one we cannot be self-existing we cannot be almighty we cannot be omnipotent we cannot be omnipresent we cannot be on audition the that elohim expresses all of that we cannot be that all right the tree that you make got a god out of or the building it's not self-existing so god in the beginning was life the eternal one in him was attributes and those attributes became words and the word became flesh jesus was the redeemer and to redeem means to bring back amen if he has to bring it back it had to be somewhere to be brought back amen so you see all people will never be able to say it because ah people wasn't in the beginning in god's thoughts look at the priest when they saw him express himself exactly with the word he was he they called him videos above that showed where their nature was is that right it was in the modern thought of that day but the little old prostitute that he met at the gate expressed his messiah messianic sign by telling her what she had done but why she said sir i perceive perceive that you are a prophet we know the messiah when he comes he will tell us all these things now see she recognized him as the messiah not as bees above not everybody can see the same thing it is ordained to life amen the anointed one because he met the scripture qualifications even though the priests and the prostitute they were looking for the same exact thing the coming of the messiah but one recognized this coming even when they were supposed to recognize it the priest couldn't see it even though they were knowledgeable in the scripture so it doesn't matter how much you know it's how much your relationship is with him amen it's how much you let him in your heart it's how much you let him live in your life amen don't you see she said we know that when the messiah cometh he will do these things now god might have had to interbreed this and then to get the certain thing out of a bell like the molder but he but when jesus turned said i am he that speaks with you he made himself known to the prostitute because of what she said i perceived that thou art a prophet and he disclosed of who he was amen i am he that speaks with you there is no such thing no such expression as bl's above she didn't call him bl's above but she recognized the truth there was something inside of her that recognized that truth now there are some people there little doctor says there wasn't anything there they didn't you don't have that seed down inside of you but i tell you there has to be something in there that recognizes the truth yes we were born and sinned and shaped in iniquity and come to the world speaking lie but there's something inside of you yes you forgot there was a spiritual amnesia you forgotten from what you where you came from the experience that you had with god before you forgot that but when you recognize the truth then you were born again your nature changed but to be redeemed there had to be something in here way back that had experience with him it was in the thoughts of god's mind amen amen after that she left her water pot ran into the city and said come see a man who told me the things that i have done isn't this the very messiah amen now what did this putting the old scripture with the experience that jesus was giving to her what did it do it made the messiah now see when those came that's exactly oh my goodness it made him the messiah because it came to show for it came to pass the manifestation was coming to pass amen see there was there's a prophecy here that has to before it becomes an actual prophecy all the events have to come up to lead to that prophecy for it to come to pass then you can call it a prophecy if not it's just words that are sitting there it becomes idle until it comes to pass amen christ couldn't become the redeemer until he had to until he came to the cross is that right he had to go through that to become and to be called the redeemer and did you notice her sins were forgiven because at the beginning she was redeemable because she was in god's thinking at the beginning so it's it's redeemed her or brought her back when she seen the express scripture manifested of jehovah of what he was and what he is amen stand your feet with me this morning or this afternoon jesus was trading here excuse me jesus was rejected another time this was before he went to the cross is that right we know it by barabbas and you you know i had a thought when i was reading and uh you know sometimes when i get a thought there's a minister that comes and preaches that thought you know because i was thinking along those lines and then lo and behold brother daryl ward comes and preaches barabbas and uh and i just think i love how that works because god's working on on the ends you know and i just felt that i was right on the same line but you know you put yourself in barabbas's position because that is you that is you yeah well what do you mean because i was traded he took my sins upon him is that right and he gave me his righteousness amen so taking that place reject not your king amen hallelujah and i want to close with this scripture first samuel 12 and verse 20. and samuel said unto the people fear not you have done all this wickedness see you you've done wickedness in your life yes you've been born again and then you still do wickedness unfortunately our flesh falls into wickedness yes sir yes sir but pay attention to what he says this is after he after he told them that yeah you wanted a king you're turning your back on god that you want a natural king i'll give you that desire okay you did wrong in that recognize that you did wrong because afterwards oh man we shouldn't have done that they recognized we shouldn't have done that but what he says he says yet turn not aside from following the lord oh my god that's mercy that's mercy he says yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your heart all your heart and turn ye not aside for then should ye go following after vain things see as i said they were habitual in the following after idols and they were it was over and over and it was the same cycle they would be up up on the mountain with god they'd get down in the valley and they'd turn away from god and then they'd get back with god and his graces and then and it was just a rollercoaster don't follow after idol saints we're taught that even in the new testament it's not just an old testament thing but it's a new testament thing also for we're told follow not after idols so this is the same thing coming uh what samuel says he says for then should you not go after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver we have one one deliverer is that right there's nothing else like when when that person comes to you for prayer they know that there's one deliverer they're they're coming to you to preparate to that one deliverer they know that you can't save who they're praying for they know that you can't save them they recognize that there is a higher power but for some reason they cannot submit to that higher power which cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain for the lord will not forsake his people for his great name sake did not jesus say that he is not and no one can pluck one out of my hands amen for his name sake amen because it hath pleased the lord to make you his people amen amen most grace is heavenly father i just thank you for your meeting with us here today lord god help us as we go for our daily walk that we would not turn aside to the things that look pretty in this world and we know that brother branham taught that even even others that we're told and we're cautioned that sin is pretty sin is something that that makes a man desire to want to go to it but lord may the desire of the holy spirit be a stronger desire that we would cleave unto the holy spirit that we would cleave unto the things that are righteous that we would meditate upon your word that we would meditate upon those as those that are good those say those things that that give us peace oh god may we meditate upon those things oh god help us to put off unrighteousness and help us to put on your righteousness today excuse me help it yes help us to put off unrighteousness and to put on your righteousness oh god help us to just look to you and be renewed in our minds day by day by day i don't know how other people pray but i know when i get up in the morning that i want to pray every single day lord forgive me of my sins forgive me of my iniquities lord renew me in my mind help me give me a refreshing of your holy spirit help me guide me through the day that's my prayer almost every morning lord you know what i say unto you you know what i ask of you every single day but lord god i can without you i can do nothing lord god i need you every step of the way your father so father i pray that you will be upon my brothers and sisters in their ears shot today that they would just the lord they might have made mistakes they might have had that we all have our faults we all have our failures but lord god may they not dwell in those faults and their failures but may they raise up for a new day may they not just look under upon upon those those idols and just sit there in those mistakes but may they look upon you to know that they are forgiven to help them to pick up and to continue on through the day and every day oh god i thank you so much oh god it seems to be that that's so much of a hindrance in this day that people just think that their sin is in the way and it's too much for you to remove but we know that our sin is thrown in the sea of forgetfulness when it's put under the blood it's blooded out and it's there no more that we can tell the accuser of the brethren that what he his accusations are false oh my help us in this day oh god help us to not reject you in your word but may we cleave to you more as a as we see the day approaching of our time for departure oh god reload i'm looking for a rapture and lord help us to get ready help us on god in jesus christ's name did you pray amen thank you o god without him i can do nothing he said so himself he foreign do nothing when i need money he supplies the funds amen there was one time when when they had to they owed the tax and they had to pay the tax what happened jesus made it to where there was a coin in the fish's mouth he supplied their need to pay that tax amen when i need a when i need a consolation he's my comforter when i'm hungry he's the bread of life did he not feed the multitude of five thousand and then there was a multitude of 7 000 with with five lows and two fish and then it was excuse me four thousand i think is what it was and it was seven feet or seven cloves of bread and then just a few how specific it gets it says a few little fishes that fed a multitude so when i'm hungry he can supply my food amen oh my when i'm lost he is my shepherd when i'm in want he supplies my every need amen is he not jehovah amen when i am thirsty he is the well of living water that never shall run dry in darkness he is a lamp but to my feet and a light unto my path when i wanted to give up on life he is life everlasting amen when i am dead in my sins when i was dead in my sins he is the resurrection amen amen praise god do you love it is he your king does he reign in your life do you let him reign in your life you know there are times that we get down let me just say i give up i can't continue anymore there's that something inside you that says i am here in my channel if you just call out to me i am here i am your comforter that's what i'm here for cry unto me my child let me know your problems don't hold them up i know he knows him already he wants to hear you cry out to him he wants to know that he's your lord of your life amen he wants to know that he's got to hear you say that amen i've got to hear my wife say i love you because the relationship becomes stealth we don't talk to one another if she doesn't hear that i say i love her she thinks something is wrong and if there's something wrong we've got to make that wrong right amen if you want to have that in your marriage amen if you want to have that is it not the same with our lord and christ our king is he not our husband don't shut him out let him come in let him meddle in your life because he you need him meddling in your life [Music] we know the spirit that we would be of if we rejected his chastening is that right when he says come to me my child make it right with me and if you refuse that that just shows what spirit you've got on you and you need that spirit lifted off you so you can get closer to him once again and you've got to have that relationship rekindled in your life amen praise the lord i don't even know what song you're [Music] saying [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] i know [Music] yes [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you for your your attention and uh just just being here and helping me preach the word amen so just thank the lord brother jesse if you want to come sing that song again [Music] [Music] mercy [Music] me [Music] nice [Music] how many years [Music] i just kind of felt like this was directed at all of us [Music] and things like that i thought that was more like adults you know and these idols though i think the young people are so often tempted with idols to make something instead of following the king the king's commands i just want to give a chance if you've rejected a king's commandment you just have to come and say say you're sorry they're from your seat can you do something it's gonna help you it's gonna strengthen you it's gonna protect you the livestream
