[0:14] spirit of truth so we will have true

[0:21] many churches with false doctrine we
[0:22] will hold the true doctrine of the faith

[2:56] seated praise god
[3:04] again it's gonna be in the house of lord
[3:05] today and thankful to have saints here
[3:08] and what a privilege to have two
[3:09] visitors jason and mario god bless you
[3:11] gentlemen
[3:12] so we'll start there in our scriptures
[3:14] with first timothy one verse four i
[3:15] usually show uh scriptures and quotes
[3:17] and
[3:18] and historical things and images you
[3:20] know it's just i think it's for me it's
[3:22] easier to learn you know when i have
[3:24] visuals i'm i guess a visual learner
[3:27] some people learn by working with their
[3:28] hands you know so they gotta write and
[3:29] draw and
[3:30] um so uh we'll just
[3:34] take what the holy spirit can give us
[3:35] today receive it be thankful with it
[3:38] and trust the lord to guide us more into
[3:40] all truth
[3:41] praise god so we looked at part four on
[3:44] wednesday we'll look at part 5 here
[3:46] today by the grace of god now we've
[3:49] looked at so far we've looked at three
[3:51] doctrines i'm sorry yes six doctrines of
[3:53] devils rather
[3:55] straight from the bible
[3:57] so paul said mandatory celibacy so
[4:00] when when a church forbids preachers
[4:03] from marrying that's a devil telling
[4:05] them to do that
[4:06] right the second one we looked at was uh
[4:08] it's mandatory vegetarian diet you can't
[4:11] eat meat any church that would mandate
[4:12] that that's a devilish doctrine
[4:15] right so see how satan likes to get into
[4:16] your diet he likes to get into your uh
[4:19] you know your uh
[4:20] your sexuality and he likes to pervert
[4:23] that right and he can pervert it in any
[4:24] way right whether it's celibacy or the
[4:26] opposite side whoredoms we'd say
[4:29] uh then of course he can pervert this
[4:30] and he can make it where you can eat
[4:32] anything and that's okay you can eat
[4:34] until you're uh until you're really
[4:36] unhealthy right and addicted to food
[4:38] well that's from the devil as well right
[4:40] so that's a doctrine of a devil as well
[4:42] saying the rapture's already passed
[4:44] that's a doctrine of a devil
[4:46] right
[4:47] some believe you know and and but some
[4:48] believe even around our kind of our
[4:50] sister churches that that we're living
[4:52] in the millennium but there's no quote
[4:55] you know as we said there's no quote for
[4:57] certain things and and so i'm not going
[4:59] to spend much time on that i've dealt
[5:00] with that in the past but i want to kind
[5:02] of move on and try to get to this
[5:03] thought here today
[5:05] uh
[5:06] the doctrine of the doubt another one a
[5:07] doctrine of a devil is there's no need
[5:09] to fast there's no need to
[5:11] give up food in order to be more
[5:12] spiritual there's no need for that
[5:14] that's that's a lie right
[5:16] uh the bible says that jesus says when
[5:18] the son of man is gone when the
[5:21] bridegroom is gone then my followers
[5:23] will fast
[5:24] so believers today people everyone in
[5:26] our church should fast sometime
[5:28] you should give up a meal and instead
[5:30] spend that time eating eating the word
[5:32] of god
[5:34] right praying
[5:35] uh
[5:36] studying listening to the scripture
[5:39] in other words having a spiritual meal
[5:41] rather than a natural meal
[5:43] that's that's scripture and if not
[5:44] people will worship their bellies the
[5:46] bible said they can worship their own
[5:47] bellies right so a person becomes an
[5:50] idol that they make themselves an idol
[5:52] right
[5:53] so that's a doctrine of a devil no need
[5:55] for fasting
[5:56] another doctrine of a devil is once
[5:59] saved you're always saved or everyone
[6:00] will go to heaven that's a doctrine of a
[6:02] devil because the bible said evil men
[6:04] crept in and they take they turn grace
[6:07] into lawlessness
[6:09] in other words oh you can do whatever
[6:10] you want it doesn't matter there's no
[6:12] there's no consequences to your actions
[6:14] if you said one prayer one time you're
[6:16] automatically saved forever and you can
[6:18] never lose that salvation well those
[6:20] people who never read it as uh exodus
[6:22] right those people never read uh
[6:23] revelation 3 verse 5 where jesus says i
[6:26] will blot out names if they don't
[6:28] overcome but we want to be the
[6:30] overcomers today praise god
[6:32] and last sunday we looked at this one
[6:34] where uh the liars will say god always
[6:37] wants you healthy and god always wants
[6:39] you wealthy
[6:40] right that's called the prosperity
[6:42] gospel and it does creep into the
[6:43] message it does creep in amongst our
[6:45] ranks
[6:46] uh but the bible says
[6:48] these are great swelling words of vanity
[6:51] they sound good
[6:52] they seem so people will clap and
[6:55] they'll enjoy it
[6:56] but behind it is is a falseness behind
[7:00] it is a reality like when you really
[7:02] live your life you're going to find
[7:03] sometimes god doesn't make you wealthy
[7:06] you're going to find sometimes god
[7:07] doesn't always heal you when you want to
[7:08] be healed
[7:10] you find that and you find in the bible
[7:11] god has chosen the poor of this world
[7:14] amen god chooses many times poor people
[7:17] in order to show that they're rich in
[7:19] faith amen
[7:20] hallelujah usually usually not always
[7:23] but usually the more money people get
[7:24] the less spiritual they are
[7:27] because they trust in uncertain riches
[7:29] rather than the living god amen
[7:31] so we should look at our lives and and
[7:34] we should no matter how much money we
[7:35] should get if we get more money that
[7:37] means there's more god wants us to give
[7:38] away praise god
[7:40] hallelujah amen or provide for your
[7:42] children amen or provide for a need that
[7:45] you know of
[7:47] get a car if you need one praise god now
[7:48] you can go to church amen
[7:50] or get a car so you can go help the poor
[7:53] feed the poor something like that
[7:55] there's a purpose for a car but it's not
[7:57] to be worshipped like we were just
[7:59] driving to church today and some some
[8:00] mustang drove out in front of us and its
[8:02] license plate said uh
[8:04] said goaded like this this car was a
[8:06] goat like the greatest of all time
[8:08] that person is truly worshiping their
[8:10] car right
[8:11] and it's got like camouflage on it it
[8:13] looks like it's just you know that's a
[8:15] worship i mean that money could have
[8:17] been better spent just buying a humble
[8:19] car and then helping out a poor person
[8:22] right or helping out a church
[8:24] you know but they're calling their car
[8:25] the greatest of all time
[8:28] that kind of goes with what we're going
[8:29] to preach today too
[8:30] how uh
[8:31] there's a lie saying we're the greatest
[8:33] believers of all time that's going
[8:34] around today that's a lie we don't want
[8:36] to make ourselves greater than anybody
[8:38] we just want to we want to make
[8:39] ourselves more humble praise god
[8:42] now and then we showed last week how
[8:44] paul even paul says jesus heal me and
[8:46] jesus said i'm not going to heal you
[8:47] this time
[8:48] he said my grace is sufficient for you
[8:50] this time
[8:52] i need to keep you humble so i'm not
[8:54] going to heal you this time
[8:55] so that proves it's not always god's
[8:57] will to make you healthy or wealthy how
[9:00] many would how many would still serve
[9:01] god even if he doesn't make you healthy
[9:03] or wealthy
[9:04] it's kind of like that a marriage vow
[9:05] right for richer or poor
[9:07] from from
[9:08] from from richer or poor from good
[9:11] health to bad health in other words i'm
[9:13] married to christ amen christ is our
[9:15] husband and we serve him no matter what
[9:17] he allows to come to pass we believe him
[9:19] we trust him and we know the greatest
[9:21] gift he could give us is not health or
[9:23] wealth but forgiveness of sins amen amen
[9:26] hallelujah
[9:27] the greatest gift he could give us was
[9:29] to wipe away all of our sins think about
[9:31] it all of our lives all of our lustful
[9:33] thoughts all of our evil actions all of
[9:35] our our stealing all of our blessing the
[9:38] greatest gift he could give us is to
[9:39] remember that no more and wash it away
[9:42] through the blood of the sacrifice
[9:44] amen that's the greatest gift we could
[9:46] be given today hallelujah
[9:49] god might make you healthy he might make
[9:50] you wealthy praise god
[9:53] but that is not always a sign that god
[9:55] is with you not always
[9:58] and that's a doctrine of a devil so
[9:59] again there's a lot of churches around
[10:01] us you know that they use great swelling
[10:04] words
[10:04] the bible and peter said this peter
[10:06] foretold this as a prophet when they
[10:08] shall speak great swelling words of
[10:10] vanity
[10:12] so the words just these claims are such
[10:14] big claims but they're empty claims in
[10:17] other words the bible really doesn't
[10:19] support their claim
[10:22] it's an empty vain promise it's a big
[10:25] promise like god's going to always make
[10:26] you healthy god's always going to make
[10:28] you wealthy that's a big big fat promise
[10:31] right a big huge promise
[10:33] right and it but it's a lie it's it's
[10:35] not the reality of the word of god
[10:38] and so what are they doing they're
[10:40] they're uh deceiving people through the
[10:42] lusts of the flesh right because your
[10:44] flesh wants cars your flesh wants money
[10:47] right your flesh wants to be healthy all
[10:49] the time your flesh doesn't like to be
[10:51] sick
[10:53] right but they use these great swelling
[10:55] lies
[10:56] in order to lure people in with these
[10:58] great big swelling lies
[11:01] and through much uh wantedness i believe
[11:03] that's laziness i'm not mistaken
[11:05] those that were clean escaped from them
[11:08] who live in air
[11:10] okay so they're luring them
[11:12] in now and they promised them liberty
[11:15] which is freedom they promised them
[11:17] freedom oh you're going to be healthy
[11:19] so wealthy and uh
[11:22] but yet the the bible says they
[11:23] themselves are servants of corruption so
[11:26] in other words look at the preacher's
[11:28] life
[11:29] and look and see what does the preacher
[11:30] serve does he serve himself or does he
[11:33] serve the lord jesus christ
[11:35] amen that's how you test these preachers
[11:37] whether on tv or on your podcast or on
[11:40] youtube or wherever they are test them
[11:43] by their fruit look at their life how do
[11:45] they live their life praise god
[11:47] amen and through that you'll know if
[11:50] they're preaching the truth or not
[11:51] hallelujah
[11:53] because they themselves many times many
[11:55] times these people that make these big
[11:56] swelling words they're servants to some
[11:58] form of corruption
[12:00] whether it's uh you know sexual
[12:02] immorality or money greed for money or
[12:05] greed for popularity
[12:07] praise god and for us we don't care you
[12:09] know we put these sermons on youtube but
[12:11] i don't care if they have five views or
[12:13] 500 as long as the right person hears
[12:16] the word that sets them free amen
[12:18] hallelujah it's not about the numbers
[12:20] it's not about the popularity it's about
[12:22] god's predestined word finding a place
[12:25] it can fall upon amen
[12:27] hallelujah it's about god directing his
[12:30] word amen
[12:31] that's why we do it that's why brother
[12:32] rahm loved uh now brother brown for our
[12:34] visitors brother brown was a prophet
[12:36] in the 20th century who died he died
[12:39] about 56 years ago
[12:41] okay but that's why brother ram liked
[12:43] brother neville's radio program
[12:46] because he said he said what a great
[12:48] message i heard brother neville preach
[12:50] he was the pastor of branham tabernacle
[12:52] he said that's a message i think
[12:53] everybody needs to hear
[12:55] he said a very fitting message for the
[12:57] day that we're living in praise god
[13:00] see brother man new you know and every
[13:02] any real person honest knows any honest
[13:04] person knows just preach the word and
[13:07] god will direct that word in other words
[13:08] don't be afraid to preach the word don't
[13:10] be afraid to share what god has done for
[13:12] you testify and if you're not a preacher
[13:14] testify about what god has done amen
[13:17] don't be afraid god will direct it it'll
[13:19] reach the right person somebody will
[13:21] hear that it'll be a blessing to them
[13:23] it'll help somebody and that's why we're
[13:25] here to spread god's word to spread the
[13:27] seed of god and god's word will produce
[13:29] of its own kind amen
[13:31] hallelujah that's why we're here to
[13:34] spread the truth to be the light to be
[13:37] the saul all these different
[13:38] illustrations we're the salt of the
[13:40] earth we're the light of the earth amen
[13:41] we're the true seed of the earth amen
[13:43] hallelujah
[13:45] we produce the fruit of the holy spirit
[13:47] praise god we're here so people can see
[13:49] real fruit that's a real christian life
[13:51] hallelujah
[13:53] amen
[13:54] thank god that there's real believers
[13:57] today thank god you're one of them
[13:58] hallelujah thank god i'm one of them
[14:00] even thank god that we can you live a
[14:03] real christian life hallelujah
[14:05] and not be a so-called christian life
[14:08] with great lying words of vanity
[14:12] and that's what i you know
[14:15] i i
[14:16] have to examine myself do i make
[14:17] promises yes i promise you if you repent
[14:20] you'll be forgiven
[14:23] if you repent and get baptized in the
[14:25] name of lord jesus christ that's my
[14:27] promise you shall receive the gift of
[14:29] the holy ghost but that's upon condition
[14:31] praise god
[14:32] that's upon the fact that you meet the
[14:34] conditions of the word of god hallelujah
[14:37] and the best part is we've seen people
[14:38] receive it amen
[14:41] we've seen god back up it's not really
[14:43] our promises but we're promising you
[14:45] that god will keep his word and your
[14:47] your individual walk may be a little
[14:48] different there's variations but we all
[14:50] must come the same way through
[14:52] repentance justification sanctification
[14:55] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[14:58] amen
[15:00] so thank god that we make promises from
[15:02] the word and god keeps his promises
[15:05] hallelujah
[15:07] now there's a great i believe this
[15:11] i believe there's a great doctrine
[15:13] that's deceiving
[15:16] and uh let me i just want to say this
[15:18] really uh cautiously yeah
[15:22] i believe there's a doctrine of a devil
[15:24] that presumes everybody say presumes
[15:27] that means that you make an assumption
[15:29] that brother branham and his followers
[15:31] are the greatest of all time let me say
[15:33] this brother brown may be the greatest
[15:35] preacher of all time he may be but that
[15:37] is not up to us to decide that's up to
[15:39] christ
[15:41] and if i could be a little more specific
[15:42] that's up to the father amen who will
[15:44] show christ
[15:45] amen
[15:47] he could be but i just believe
[15:49] i'm never going to ever tell you you are
[15:51] the greatest people of all time i'm
[15:53] never gonna say that
[15:54] because i don't believe we have a
[15:55] scriptural place for that
[15:57] according to these verses now for our
[15:59] visitors uh uh jason and mario let me
[16:01] just i just put a few together up here
[16:03] uh once i knew you guys were here um i
[16:06] just want to introduce you a little bit
[16:07] to the ministry of william branham he
[16:09] died in 1965 right but we believe he was
[16:12] the last messenger to the church so if
[16:14] you study church history paul was like
[16:16] the first major prophet to the church he
[16:19] wrote most of the new testament
[16:21] right now after him a couple hundred
[16:24] years was iranius a mighty man of god
[16:26] and all these i mean we preached sermons
[16:27] on these guys lives these guys lives
[16:29] were totally supernatural
[16:31] right now we're not worshiping these
[16:32] guys but we're just recognizing they had
[16:34] real faith in christ
[16:37] right paul iranius a martin a powerful
[16:40] man he was saint patrick's uncle st
[16:43] patrick was not a catholic although some
[16:44] people will tell you that he was not a
[16:46] catholic
[16:47] in fact we believe the roman catholic
[16:48] church is the archenemy of the church
[16:51] we believe that now we still love the
[16:52] people inside the church we love them
[16:55] but we're trying to tell them come out
[16:57] come out of that false religious system
[16:59] and so he was of course mighty man of
[17:01] god columba mighty missionary in fact uh
[17:04] during the dark ages it was because of
[17:06] his work that the gospel could go on
[17:09] because satan had such a grasp on
[17:11] humanity where uh the dark ages they
[17:13] didn't have you know education they
[17:15] didn't and the worst part was they
[17:16] didn't have the bible amen many people
[17:18] didn't have the bible but through his
[17:20] work
[17:21] god kept
[17:22] the the truth alive during the dark ages
[17:25] and then you brothers probably know
[17:26] martin luther during the reformation
[17:29] he brought up the great revelation that
[17:31] just shall live by faith
[17:33] now yes he had all these guys had the
[17:34] baptism of the holy ghost but there each
[17:36] one had a main message that they had to
[17:38] preach
[17:39] right paul's was
[17:41] his gospel from jesus christ to give us
[17:43] the bible and every man will be judged
[17:45] by what paul wrote in the bible that's
[17:47] what jesus said hallelujah
[17:49] now 100 years after him or so maybe 100
[17:52] well almost 200 maybe was john wesley
[17:54] and he preached sanctification that's
[17:56] where the methodist church comes out of
[17:57] that
[17:58] okay mighty man of god preacher he was
[18:00] 88 years old and he he had as much
[18:03] strength when he was 88 as he did at 20
[18:05] praise god that's what his testimony was
[18:08] and then brother branham came uh after
[18:10] the zuzu street revival of 1906 and he
[18:13] came and had just a mighty mighty
[18:16] ministry that's his second wife his
[18:17] first wife died and so he married again
[18:19] that sister mita
[18:21] um but it's just a video i made uh but
[18:23] it's just a picture of a nice nice
[18:24] close-up picture by the way and his wife
[18:26] there
[18:26] and he was human of course he was human
[18:28] you know he's just like all of us right
[18:30] but a prophetic gift
[18:32] okay i just want to show this picture
[18:33] real quick so brother here's brother
[18:34] brown just a real small five foot three
[18:36] man right but what what made him special
[18:38] was that they would bring up strangers
[18:40] to him and he he would say well wait a
[18:42] moment here and he would lean back and
[18:44] then he would see visions and then tell
[18:46] the people what he saw in the visions
[18:48] and they would every time they would say
[18:49] that's right that's exactly and they
[18:50] would weep and cry or praise god this
[18:52] man wanted the holy ghost phil revival
[18:54] and brother man said uh he said you're
[18:55] up here you're not for yourself he said
[18:57] you're not sick he said you want an
[18:59] old-fashioned holy ghost revival the man
[19:00] goes like this he goes oh hallelujah
[19:03] amen
[19:05] and that's called discernment of spirit
[19:08] that was brother bam's gift he had a
[19:09] gift of discernment
[19:11] and that's the ability to know the
[19:13] thoughts and secrets of the heart jesus
[19:15] christ had that same gift in fact every
[19:17] prophet had that gift
[19:19] elijah knew what was going on in the
[19:21] king of syria's bed chambers amen
[19:23] because the lord showed him what was
[19:24] going on
[19:27] jesus had that gift he told that woman
[19:28] at the well uh yeah the man you're
[19:30] living with now is not your husband
[19:32] you've had five other ones and she said
[19:34] i perceive you're a prophet
[19:37] see because she knew only a prophet
[19:39] knows these things because a prophet has
[19:41] a gift to know that amen
[19:45] now he had a worldwide undeniable
[19:48] healing and discernment ministry started
[19:51] in 1946 if i'm not mistaken i could be
[19:53] wrong by one year on that
[19:55] it started a worldwide revival
[19:58] healing
[19:59] and he spoke over 30 thus saith the lord
[20:01] times and anyone that reads the bible
[20:03] knows a prophet will say in the name of
[20:05] the lord or this is thus saith the lord
[20:08] amen
[20:09] so he and then he has numerous fulfilled
[20:11] prophecies as a son of man
[20:15] and he also fulfilled the bible
[20:16] mysteries according to revelation 10
[20:18] verse 7 and according to malachi 4 verse
[20:21] 6 he turned the hearts of us back to the
[20:24] bible
[20:25] in other words brother brahm just he
[20:26] lived he pointed here he died but we're
[20:28] still looking here amen
[20:30] hallelujah amen thank god
[20:33] we thank god for the the ministry of
[20:35] brother iran we thank god for iranians
[20:36] and and all these men of god luther
[20:39] wesley we thank god but they've all done
[20:40] one thing they've all pointed to jesus
[20:42] christ amen
[20:44] hallelujah they did not point to
[20:46] themselves they pointed to christ amen
[20:49] hallelujah
[20:50] now
[20:51] i've not met this woman i think she's
[20:53] still alive but i did meet this woman in
[20:55] other words in 1953 this woman met
[20:57] brother branham she was 26 years old
[20:59] it's on tape
[21:00] we got it on tape
[21:02] and brother man said you're not from
[21:04] here he says you're from a wooded area
[21:06] he said it's denver colorado and the
[21:08] reason you're here he said you have a
[21:10] female trouble you can't have a baby he
[21:12] said thus saith the lord go home you're
[21:14] gonna have a baby
[21:17] but it took 10 years
[21:19] that's the part people don't realize
[21:21] sometimes god will speak something to
[21:22] you but it's going to take a while
[21:25] just trust in the lord amen trust in the
[21:27] lord with all your heart lean not upon
[21:29] your own understanding
[21:30] in all your ways acknowledge him and he
[21:32] will direct thy past amen
[21:35] she's a worldwide famous preacher now
[21:37] brother ram didn't even believe in women
[21:38] preachers
[21:39] but he prayed for her anyway because he
[21:41] loved he loved god
[21:42] he loved all god's all god's creation
[21:46] right and that's on tape you can listen
[21:47] we listened that yesterday didn't we no
[21:49] we listened to it on saturday yeah you
[21:51] malachi and i listen to it on saturday
[21:53] now this sister passed away in 2013. but
[21:56] this was on tape as well in 1955 brother
[21:58] ram said you've got tuberculosis she had
[22:00] tuberculosis she only had three kids at
[22:02] that time
[22:04] and he said you're dying
[22:05] he said uh in the name of jesus christ i
[22:08] rebuked satan he said and you're healed
[22:11] he said i charge satan to leave you in
[22:13] jesus christ's name he said to let you
[22:15] know i told you the truth he said go
[22:17] weigh yourself monday
[22:18] and then the next monday and you'll see
[22:20] what i've told you is the truth
[22:22] hallelujah
[22:23] and that's exactly what happened she
[22:25] went from skinny and dying like a just
[22:27] like a a bunch of bones with skin on him
[22:30] like a thin woman she went that to a
[22:31] healthy woman had four more kids amen i
[22:34] think when she died she had 30
[22:36] grandchildren and 50 great-grandchildren
[22:38] if i'm not mistaken amen
[22:41] and i met her but she said i always say
[22:43] this because it made me happy she said
[22:44] you preached just like brother branham
[22:47] now she could have been being nice or
[22:49] something like that but it just
[22:50] encouraged me hey man
[22:51] and her family went to brother brown's
[22:53] church for
[22:54] many years at least five years they went
[22:56] to brother church because they lived you
[22:57] know north carolina but they would then
[22:59] they drive up to jeffersonville
[23:02] now he was fully human though brother
[23:03] branham he died by a car accident now we
[23:07] don't know why but he died by a car
[23:09] accident died he had injuries and he
[23:10] died a few days after the car accident
[23:13] uh many cults have risen up but that's
[23:15] scriptural
[23:16] and i'm not i'm just going to move on
[23:18] past that because i went through that
[23:19] and that's a pretty good introduction i
[23:21] want the brothers to see the
[23:22] uh
[23:23] those supernatural powerful things
[23:25] praise god and now we'll get to the word
[23:26] of god here a little more
[23:28] all right so that's a good start there
[23:29] by god's grace now
[23:32] okay not for far enough here we go
[23:35] okay so we went through uh
[23:37] those six that's those these are
[23:39] doctrines of devils that we've looked at
[23:42] and preached on
[23:43] now uh
[23:47] the the seventh one is
[23:48] the i believe it's i believe it's of the
[23:50] devil
[23:52] to just assume without any bible proof
[23:54] or authority that brother brahm is the
[23:56] greatest person that ever lived outside
[23:58] of jesus and you and we are greater than
[24:01] every other person that ever lived in
[24:02] the history of the world i believe
[24:03] that's i believe that's a sin
[24:07] because i don't have there's no bible
[24:09] evidence for that
[24:12] now i want to just show this too and
[24:13] then the eighth one maybe we'll get to
[24:14] this today
[24:16] but some people say rapturing faith is
[24:18] literally on the the sermon recordings
[24:21] of brother branham literally but it's
[24:23] not it's it's it's in heaven praise god
[24:26] and let me just get to this rook briefly
[24:28] where was enoch's rapturing faith was it
[24:30] on a piece of stone
[24:33] or was it in heaven praise god let me
[24:35] just give you that one how about
[24:36] elijah's faith was that on plastic
[24:38] somewhere was that on a stone somewhere
[24:40] was that on paper somewhere it's going
[24:42] to be the same faith brother van amen
[24:44] the same faith that took up enoch and
[24:46] elijah is one day going to take up the
[24:49] bride of jesus christ amen it's not a
[24:51] different faith it's the same rapturing
[24:53] faith hallelujah
[24:55] and i'll say it like this it'll be a
[24:57] gift from god
[24:58] amen
[25:00] as long as you're born again as long as
[25:02] you've repented and sanctified filled
[25:03] with the holy ghost god will bring you
[25:05] to it because it's about god fulfilling
[25:07] his word amen it's about god's word not
[25:10] coming to not not not being void but
[25:13] god's word must be fulfilled in his time
[25:16] and season hallelujah
[25:21] now here's why i i read this recently
[25:24] and uh
[25:26] of a false church
[25:29] said it's the greatest age of all time
[25:31] not even i don't even know how you can
[25:32] prove that
[25:34] i don't even i can't even say it's the
[25:35] greatest age of all time how can we say
[25:37] our age is greater than paul's age
[25:40] like my wife my wife brought that quote
[25:41] to me brother man was talking about the
[25:42] four anointings remember the four
[25:44] anointings on the church and brother
[25:45] brown even said it how can you do
[25:47] anything except god the anointing god
[25:49] gives you
[25:51] we have the ego anointing but it's not
[25:53] that we earned it it's just god ordained
[25:55] there has to become an ego anointing
[25:57] that watches and prays amen hallelujah
[26:00] that watches and prays and that
[26:02] anointing of the holy ghost will take us
[26:04] up in the rapture hallelujah because
[26:06] eagles fly high amen and the bride of
[26:09] christ will fly high to meet christ in
[26:11] the air
[26:13] but how is that any good does the bible
[26:15] ever say that's the greater anointing
[26:16] than the line anointing
[26:18] i don't think so
[26:20] does it does the bible ever say the ox
[26:22] anointing is any less
[26:24] than the line anointing
[26:26] or is it the same holy spirit just with
[26:28] different attributes to meet the
[26:29] challenge of the hour
[26:31] that's a loud thing amen
[26:34] hallelujah
[26:35] and they want to say brother ram is the
[26:37] greatest messenger of all time but
[26:38] there's no evidence for that
[26:41] i found another quote yesterday from the
[26:42] same website where it said brother ram
[26:44] was the greatest
[26:46] prophet of all time
[26:47] of all time
[26:50] now to me that's a presumption
[26:53] and the proof of that and then then it
[26:54] says and then that that pastor is
[26:56] telling their church you're the greatest
[26:58] christians of all time can you imagine
[26:59] that that's what we ended with on uh
[27:01] wednesday night remember we went through
[27:03] hebrews 11.
[27:04] brother brahm said judge your testimony
[27:07] next to theirs
[27:08] they were cut with saws and divided
[27:11] put your testimony up to theirs
[27:14] they wandered around in goat skins and
[27:17] sheepskins
[27:19] put your testimony up to theirs
[27:21] i mean
[27:23] church if we're honest we'll feel about
[27:24] this big next to theirs
[27:26] now don't forget this too there's a
[27:28] spiritual reality though to the new
[27:30] testament because jesus said he that's
[27:32] least in the kingdom is still greater
[27:34] than john the baptist
[27:36] he said john the baptist was greater
[27:37] than all the prophets before him well
[27:39] there we go right there there's mine
[27:41] he said but still he's least in the
[27:43] kingdom
[27:45] now that's something right there that's
[27:47] quicken to me right there okay
[27:48] hallelujah
[27:50] okay
[27:52] so how how could you and i be greater
[27:55] than john the baptist it's not by our
[27:57] works
[27:58] but it's by the season that god is
[28:00] working in the only way we can be
[28:03] greater is if there's a greater
[28:04] sacrifice to cover our sins and that is
[28:07] that's the reason why anyone anyone in
[28:10] the new testament will be greater
[28:11] because we're not under bulls and goats
[28:14] and all these sacrifices we're under the
[28:16] lamb of god jesus christ
[28:19] it's a better covenant with better
[28:21] promises amen
[28:23] in other words like compare yourself
[28:25] with david david's through a giant we've
[28:27] never done that but david fell to
[28:29] adultery and if you and i don't fall to
[28:31] that then we slay the giant of adultery
[28:34] amen
[28:35] and that's something he couldn't do
[28:37] because he didn't have the power amen he
[28:39] didn't have the access to it but we have
[28:41] access to more power because we have the
[28:43] life of jesus christ here amen
[28:46] hallelujah
[28:52] now just with that thought now
[28:54] i could see how you might say brother
[28:56] branham would be the greatest of the
[28:57] prophets because if john was the
[28:59] greatest
[29:00] at the end of the of the covenant maybe
[29:03] brother branham would be the greatest
[29:04] but i personally don't feel i have the
[29:06] authority to say that
[29:08] you know why
[29:10] because jesus christ himself wouldn't
[29:12] say who was the greatest
[29:14] and if you can say who's greatest and
[29:16] jesus can't well now you've just made
[29:17] yourself greater than jesus
[29:20] they asked remember that mother came up
[29:21] and said jesus can james sit on one side
[29:24] and can john sit on the other side i
[29:25] love you jesus you know i'm sure she was
[29:27] a happy mom you know she really wanted
[29:29] her children to be
[29:30] really really uh uh honored you know she
[29:32] loved her children
[29:34] but jesus said you shall and drink in
[29:36] need of my cup and be baptized with the
[29:37] baptism i'm baptized with but to sit on
[29:40] my right hand think about that sitting
[29:41] right next to jesus and on my left is
[29:43] not mine to give
[29:46] so jesus says this is not my
[29:48] responsibility i can't say who's the
[29:50] greatest and who's not
[29:52] he said but it shall be given to them
[29:54] for who is prepared of my father and the
[29:56] church said
[29:58] amen
[30:00] now if you go to revelation
[30:03] chapter 4 there's one throne jesus sits
[30:06] on it and there's 24 thrones around it
[30:09] and we know who those are
[30:12] those are the 12
[30:14] original sons of jacob and the 12
[30:16] apostles minus judas and we believe paul
[30:19] was placed in there because he said i
[30:20] was one born out of season
[30:24] and he said i labored more than all of
[30:25] them but the grace of god not me but the
[30:28] grace of god that was in me
[30:30] okay
[30:31] so just looking at that picture
[30:34] we could say the greatest of any of them
[30:36] would probably be the apostles because
[30:38] jesus told the apostles you will rule
[30:40] over the 12 tribes of israel
[30:43] now we're getting there now we're
[30:44] getting down there amen
[30:46] hallelujah
[30:48] is that helpful by god's grace
[30:50] hope that's a help by the grace of the
[30:52] lord
[30:53] but to presume and say that you know
[30:56] and jesus didn't tell us
[30:58] that we can get pretty close to the spot
[31:01] of it
[31:02] but if jesus didn't tell us we can't
[31:04] exalt ourselves above jesus and and make
[31:07] it seem like we know something and this
[31:08] man believes he's a prophet we're saying
[31:10] that brother adam's the greatest of all
[31:11] time and that the people is the greatest
[31:13] of all time
[31:15] he exalts himself as a prophet
[31:18] so we see we have to be very careful
[31:20] what we believe amen
[31:24] now let me tell you this
[31:26] we dare not
[31:28] everybody say dare not
[31:30] don't even try it
[31:32] paul said dare not make ourselves of
[31:34] that number or compare ourselves with
[31:36] some that commend themselves so paul
[31:38] noticed in court there were some people
[31:40] that just commended and complimented
[31:41] themselves he says they're comparing
[31:44] themselves among themselves making one
[31:46] better one less
[31:48] he said therefore they are not wise
[31:51] isn't that doesn't that sound like jesus
[31:52] disciples they're arguing who's i'm the
[31:55] greatest one no no i'm the greatest one
[31:56] no no no i'm the greatest one come on
[31:58] i'm peter i you know i'm not saying he
[32:00] was arguing that but some of them were
[32:03] paul says don't you dare
[32:06] start saying well i know brother
[32:08] so-and-so is greater than sister
[32:10] so-and-so
[32:11] he said don't you because uh this person
[32:14] did this and that he said don't compare
[32:16] yourselves to nobody but christ
[32:19] because paul says it becomes a boasting
[32:21] see they're bragging
[32:23] it's pride amen
[32:27] and to say that we're greater
[32:29] than other ages i think that's a brag i
[32:32] think that's a boast
[32:33] because even jesus wouldn't say who was
[32:35] the who's the greatest ones
[32:37] he said that's up to the father
[32:41] he said but according to the measure of
[32:42] the rule which god has distributed us a
[32:44] measure to reach even unto you so we
[32:46] don't dare to do this he said it's
[32:48] foolish so that reminds us that's a
[32:49] foolish virgin thing to do
[32:52] and just like you know recently i told
[32:54] you about this certain preachers in the
[32:56] message they're wonderful brothers i
[32:57] personally believe they're born again
[32:59] but they go around calling themselves
[33:01] generals
[33:02] like i'm a general in god's army where
[33:04] the bible ever say to go around and tell
[33:06] you call yourself a general
[33:08] right here it says don't compare
[33:09] yourselves
[33:11] and i got i've made i caught video of
[33:13] them saying we and they're also in the
[33:15] background and the preacher says these
[33:17] are the most powerful preachers on earth
[33:19] well how do they know that
[33:21] see that
[33:22] i just feel like don't you get the sense
[33:24] that many times people just if they're
[33:26] not careful if they can't get tempted by
[33:28] the devil with lust of the flesh less of
[33:29] the eyes he's probably going to get him
[33:31] with the pride of life
[33:33] if they don't remain humble because
[33:35] those are the three areas you can be
[33:37] tested in
[33:38] lust of the eyes lust of the flesh and
[33:41] pride of life
[33:44] and the very man that said that one of
[33:45] the very men that said that i'm a
[33:46] general he actually called himself a
[33:48] general i'm coming in to save pray for
[33:49] somebody so they'll not die that very
[33:52] person died two days later and he had
[33:54] said god's going to heal him
[33:56] now they didn't say they'll say the lord
[33:58] but look at the pride of that look at
[34:00] the look at the presumption that's what
[34:02] we're getting to today amen
[34:03] presuming people presuming they're
[34:05] general people presuming they're great
[34:07] presuming that they're they're comparing
[34:09] we should not be caring about who's
[34:11] greater we should be caring about those
[34:12] that are sick and don't have food and
[34:14] help them out amen
[34:16] that's what we should care about praise
[34:17] god amen just you know i got two bags
[34:20] out there for you buddy i brought those
[34:21] bags
[34:22] and for anybody else too anybody else
[34:23] too
[34:25] see they're worrying about who's greater
[34:28] rather than worrying about who needs
[34:30] today where are the needs today who can
[34:31] i help out who can i serve today amen
[34:35] they want to be rulers instead of
[34:36] servants amen hallelujah
[34:40] that's the truth hallelujah i'm getting
[34:43] some fiery indignation amen
[34:45] that's true
[34:47] they want to be served rather than serve
[34:50] others
[34:52] amen now there's eight verses on this
[34:54] we're not going to take the time but if
[34:55] you want them let me know i can
[34:57] screenshot this sometimes jose asked me
[34:58] for the notes i could send this to your
[35:00] brother
[35:01] there's one two three four
[35:03] five six seven eight scriptures that say
[35:05] we are not to compare ourselves with one
[35:08] another because that becomes prideful
[35:13] we're to look at ourselves humbly
[35:15] and say well i'm a sinner saved by grace
[35:17] yes i'm more than a conqueror when
[35:18] anointing is on me but let me see how
[35:20] humble i can be instead of how prideful
[35:21] i can be
[35:23] praise god
[35:25] it's all over the bible paul wrote it on
[35:26] numerous gate paul wrote it one that we
[35:28] read two three
[35:30] four
[35:31] four times paul wrote about it and
[35:33] solomon an otherwise man with a gift of
[35:34] discernment there wrote it two three
[35:36] times as well
[35:37] luke wrote about it and joe wrote about
[35:38] it
[35:41] let's not worry about who's the greatest
[35:42] let's worry about jesus christ amen
[35:46] let's focus that he's the greatest
[35:48] see i believe that's the spirit of pride
[35:50] that gets into churches because they're
[35:52] they're not learning anything new so
[35:53] they got to bring up all this old stuff
[35:54] you know
[35:55] and then and try to pridefully exalt
[35:57] themselves one above another
[36:01] that's just my that's the way i can
[36:02] understand it now notice paul paul was i
[36:05] believe paul was likely one of the
[36:06] greatest
[36:08] if not the greatest
[36:11] because his gospel was the judgment
[36:13] standard
[36:15] yet he considered himself the least
[36:18] and that's how you know a real humble
[36:19] person no matter what responsibility
[36:21] what gifts they have what testimonies
[36:23] they'll always consider themselves as
[36:25] nothing
[36:27] and the church said amen
[36:30] paul
[36:31] paul raised the dead he had thrown a
[36:33] viper in the fire and he still says i am
[36:36] the least of all of them
[36:38] he now looks he said i'm one of them so
[36:40] don't don't deny your office god gave
[36:42] you amen hallelujah
[36:44] don't deny the gifts you got be faithful
[36:46] with them amen
[36:48] but say i'm the least of all of them
[36:51] hallelujah
[36:52] now why did he why did he why do you
[36:54] think this because at one time before he
[36:56] was saved he persecuted the church of
[36:58] god
[36:59] so he looked at his past and said my
[37:00] past has made me the least
[37:03] but the bible also says he that's
[37:04] forgiven much loveth much amen
[37:08] hallelujah
[37:09] so to me i believe paul was being very
[37:10] humble
[37:11] and i believe because of that humility
[37:13] god will exalt him high
[37:15] he's at least one of the top 12
[37:17] that's in my at least my humble opinion
[37:18] right now
[37:19] but then also i know we have thrones but
[37:21] then also the stars in his hand that's
[37:23] the seven church age messenger so how
[37:24] does that work do they get thrones i
[37:26] don't know i didn't see seven thrones in
[37:28] the bible but we could learn more and
[37:30] there may be there'll definitely be some
[37:31] surprises when we get there praise god
[37:34] so see i'm not we're just we just don't
[37:36] want to presume and we don't want to get
[37:38] a prideful spirit upon us we want a
[37:40] humble spirit upon us
[37:43] amen
[37:45] but by the grace of god i am what i am
[37:48] his grace was bestowed upon me was not
[37:50] in vain amen but i labored more
[37:52] abundantly than they all yet not i but
[37:54] the grace of god
[37:56] that was given to me we must have holy
[37:58] ghost humility
[38:02] um and i i need to say that i'm the
[38:04] least of the preachers in the message
[38:05] i'm the very least
[38:07] i want to believe that and i want to act
[38:09] like that i want to i want to be humble
[38:11] like that
[38:13] i still want to recognize the gifts he
[38:14] given me and that i want to say the
[38:16] gifts he give me i want to labor in
[38:17] those gifts i want to be faithful with
[38:19] those gifts
[38:20] and then i'll leave everything up to him
[38:21] because it don't matter who's the
[38:22] greatest i just want to be faithful with
[38:24] what he gave me praise god
[38:28] now here's one something i got an email
[38:30] on wednesday night someone was streaming
[38:31] the service not from our church but
[38:33] another church
[38:34] and they said that's really important
[38:35] that you preach that we have to preach
[38:37] against cult behaviors
[38:40] because really a cult is just a
[38:41] denomination really when you think about
[38:43] it
[38:44] right everybody hears caught and they go
[38:46] ugh but really that's all it is this is
[38:47] domination
[38:49] right we are not a cult
[38:51] we're the body of jesus christ
[38:53] hallelujah now the world will no doubt
[38:55] the world will always look at real
[38:56] believers and call them a cult
[38:58] they call paul a sect of the nazarenes
[39:01] right they called paul a cult leader
[39:03] so sinners will always call us cult
[39:04] leaders but that's not true what the way
[39:07] they call heresy is the way we worship
[39:09] but it's not heresy it's the right way
[39:11] amen
[39:13] now here's four behaviors of a cult and
[39:16] we're gonna look at each one of them
[39:17] there's the reference that might make
[39:18] you laugh but that's where i got it from
[39:19] the reference
[39:22] the people that we debated a couple
[39:24] years ago which they're nice people fine
[39:25] people i'm still making a video for them
[39:27] i just haven't got to there's just so
[39:28] much there's just so much to do so
[39:29] little time but summer's coming by god's
[39:32] grace someone's coming i don't think
[39:33] they're gonna expand the school year
[39:34] into the summer i hope not by god's
[39:36] grace
[39:37] uh let's look at the first two one
[39:40] one nature of a cult is to make them
[39:43] close-minded
[39:44] they're not interested in a rational
[39:47] evaluation of the facts in other words
[39:48] they won't look at any facts they're
[39:49] just going to believe what they want to
[39:50] believe what they've been taught
[39:52] the church let me say this jesus was not
[39:55] afraid of questions
[39:58] he wasn't afraid to hear other people's
[40:00] opinions amen
[40:02] why because he had the truth
[40:04] amen like i heard that brother say it's
[40:06] right he said if you have gold you're
[40:08] not afraid to put that in the fire amen
[40:11] because you know that'll only refine it
[40:12] more amen
[40:14] hallelujah
[40:16] we're not afraid to test our beliefs i'm
[40:17] not afraid to get an email or call or
[40:19] anyone to stand by i've already said
[40:21] that come stand by me with the bible
[40:23] show me where i'm wrong amen and if i'm
[40:25] wrong i'll say praise the lord that'll
[40:26] help me be a little more gold-like
[40:29] that'll purify my gold purity or my my
[40:31] percentage of gold amen hallelujah
[40:36] but a cult says don't listen to anything
[40:38] except what we say
[40:41] that's not what jesus said
[40:42] remember jesus even told them they were
[40:44] under the law jesus said you that been
[40:45] healed he said now go obey moses's
[40:47] commands and go offer your sacrifice
[40:51] remember jesus said go do what the
[40:53] pharisees tell you to do that's in the
[40:54] word he said but don't be like unto them
[40:56] hypocrites
[41:00] so we're not afraid of questions
[41:03] now church will i have all the answers
[41:04] no don't ever think of it because i'm
[41:06] not god
[41:07] but we'll wait upon the lord we'll pray
[41:09] about it we'll search the scripture
[41:10] scripture we'll give you the best answer
[41:11] we can by the grace of god
[41:16] we have the holy spirit of truth
[41:20] not afraid of any question we o the
[41:22] bible says prove all things
[41:24] so i preached here what we've had our
[41:26] church almost 16 years
[41:28] we've tried to prove everything we
[41:29] believe by the word of god and the
[41:30] church members said amen
[41:33] we devoted our lives to that praise god
[41:36] peter said always have an answer for the
[41:38] hope that you have within us always but
[41:41] see cults they don't want to give
[41:42] answers they don't they can't take any
[41:43] questions that make them nervous
[41:46] see we're not a cult
[41:48] hallelujah the bible says search they
[41:51] search the scriptures daily in acts 17
[41:53] 11. and church we can read other sources
[41:56] like a quote will tell you don't listen
[41:57] to anything like a cult today would say
[41:59] don't listen to anything except joseph
[42:01] smith that's what the mormons would say
[42:03] now for people like us they say don't
[42:04] listen to anything but brother branham
[42:06] but brother ham never told us to do that
[42:08] the bible doesn't tell us to do that
[42:11] hallelujah
[42:12] the bible tells preachers study yourself
[42:14] to prove unto god a workman that needeth
[42:17] not be ashamed rightly dividing the word
[42:20] of truth amen
[42:22] that means a preacher is going to read
[42:23] things that some things that don't have
[42:24] truth in it so they got to rightly
[42:26] divide it they got to take the truth out
[42:27] and leave what's not the truth amen and
[42:29] we almost do that every day praise god
[42:34] like when i wrote my book about the
[42:36] seven church ages i used a man named
[42:38] broadband edmond broadbent he's a
[42:40] wonderful historian i use his work
[42:43] but what if i said i can't read anything
[42:44] but the message well i would have left i
[42:46] would have missed out on a lot of great
[42:47] historical facts
[42:50] right
[42:52] remember that time you heard on the
[42:53] radio brother remember how they helped
[42:54] you see
[42:55] that's what i love about god
[42:57] if you're just looking for truth god
[42:58] will send it to you some in some way
[43:00] it makes you love god more amen
[43:03] now of course we know most preachers
[43:05] that don't follow william branham yeah
[43:06] they're not going to have all the truth
[43:08] but they can still have some truth to
[43:09] help us out
[43:10] and i don't encourage i don't encourage
[43:12] you to listen to other preachers outside
[43:13] the message very much i would say very
[43:15] rarely
[43:16] because you got to be careful what
[43:17] they're trying to draw you into like
[43:19] like the bible just said remember they
[43:20] allure you
[43:22] but just hearing one sermon isn't going
[43:24] to kill you
[43:25] right unless you worship unless there's
[43:27] a deception on there and you worship
[43:28] that you've got to be careful but if you
[43:30] have the holy ghost you might just
[43:32] listen a little bit but then you get
[43:33] back to what's right amen
[43:35] might have to answer a question but then
[43:37] get right back to the truth amen listen
[43:38] to your pastor listen to god's prophet
[43:40] amen
[43:41] listen to men that you know really
[43:43] believe the word of god hallelujah
[43:46] we're not scared of things outside the
[43:48] bible
[43:50] i can learn i've learned many things
[43:51] from outside the bible but i've always
[43:53] brought it back and saw yeah that agrees
[43:55] with what the bible says
[43:57] amen
[43:58] here's the second thing blind obedience
[44:00] to authority the dogma of leader or
[44:03] founder is supreme
[44:06] now
[44:08] in other words the the lie about this is
[44:10] i believe everything on the tapes and i
[44:12] everything brother ram said i believe it
[44:13] that's such a lie
[44:15] that's blind following that's it's a lie
[44:18] it's dishonest
[44:19] and they know it
[44:21] they're lying through their teeth
[44:24] but we prove all things by the bible in
[44:26] other words the bible the holy ghost is
[44:28] our authority as he points us to the
[44:30] bible amen
[44:33] we're not blindly just following
[44:34] everything brother brahm said brother
[44:36] brahma said prove what i said in the
[44:38] bible he said if you have a teaching
[44:39] it's got to go from genesis all the way
[44:41] to revelation then you know it's the
[44:43] truth amen
[44:45] we follow brother iran's teachings
[44:46] because their bible
[44:48] not his human opinions hopes wishes etc
[44:51] the word only is infallible
[44:54] which includes bible teaching and thus
[44:55] ate the lord declarations
[44:57] praise god
[44:59] now if you if you find something in
[45:01] brotherham's sermons and doesn't make
[45:02] sense that you just want to set it on
[45:03] the shelf that's fine
[45:05] right and if you want to take his
[45:07] opinion that's fine too
[45:09] what we're saying is don't exalt
[45:10] everything don't worship a man worship
[45:13] no man worship christ only amen
[45:17] see it's such a delicate balance but
[45:18] anybody that knows uh
[45:21] truth anybody that has an honest and
[45:22] good heart will understand what i'm
[45:24] saying praise god
[45:25] if you have an honest and good heart
[45:29] hallelujah
[45:31] a cult brings you into fear and brings
[45:33] you to slavery but real religion makes
[45:35] you free from that
[45:38] real holy ghost religion makes you free
[45:40] in christ jesus amen
[45:42] you don't live by fear what's the
[45:44] preacher going to say what's my brother
[45:45] gonna say what's the message you don't
[45:47] live by fear you live by faith amen
[45:50] hallelujah
[45:51] and you're honest if you made a mistake
[45:53] i i care what they say if i make a
[45:54] mistake i'll repent but if i'm right i
[45:57] don't care if i get criticized i'll
[45:58] overcome amen
[46:00] a soft answer will turn away wrath
[46:04] hallelujah
[46:06] glory
[46:10] now i'm going to file it from wednesday
[46:11] faith had a really good question
[46:13] uh we were talking
[46:14] we're talking about how we follow
[46:16] brother man's message well
[46:17] the the real and this scripture came to
[46:20] me yesterday when i was studying sister
[46:21] faith so this is just for you
[46:22] from the lord amen
[46:25] we follow the faith of believers
[46:28] and that's what the bible says
[46:31] in other words we follow their obedience
[46:33] to the word of god
[46:35] we don't follow all their sins
[46:38] we don't follow all their hopes and
[46:39] opinions and ideas we follow their faith
[46:43] glory
[46:44] faith is assurance
[46:45] faith is a revelation
[46:47] of the will of god
[46:49] so when we say we follow brother abraham
[46:51] we follow the faith that he point us to
[46:54] the word of god amen just like paul said
[46:57] follow me as i follow christ amen
[47:01] that's what the bible says the lord is
[47:02] my helper i will not fear what man shall
[47:04] do to me remember them which have the
[47:06] rule over you so he's talking about
[47:07] preachers because preachers rule by the
[47:09] word the word rules
[47:10] not a man but the word
[47:13] who have spoken unto you the word of god
[47:14] see anyone who speaks the word of god to
[47:16] you that word is ruling over your life
[47:18] and the bible said whose faith follow so
[47:21] if you're a part of this church you
[47:23] should look at my faith
[47:24] and see well i see the good things he
[47:26] does i'm going to follow that don't
[47:27] follow the bad things i do
[47:29] because you're going to find yourself in
[47:30] a bad place
[47:31] learn from my mistakes because i'm going
[47:33] to make mistakes
[47:34] but see where you see look where you see
[47:36] the holy spirit moving in my life
[47:39] and then follow that and i'll say it
[47:40] like this follow your brothers and
[47:41] sisters faith too
[47:43] but god has given us leaders and the
[47:45] bible says follow their faith
[47:47] considering the end of their
[47:48] conversation look at what is the final
[47:50] product of their life the final product
[47:52] of their life should be holiness
[47:54] righteousness a love for god a love for
[47:57] truth follow that faith that produces
[47:59] peace amen amen
[48:02] hallelujah
[48:03] and what does he say after this that's
[48:05] jesus christ this pattern is jesus
[48:07] christ the same yesterday today and
[48:10] forever
[48:12] follow the faith of the saints who live
[48:14] the gospel before you
[48:19] now here's three and four i i had to uh
[48:21] shrink down one and two or else that
[48:23] list just evaporates or whatever happens
[48:25] and it goes back to one and two
[48:27] uh as you know if you work with word
[48:28] documents
[48:30] uh the third one is
[48:32] colts control every detail of your life
[48:36] it's dictated by the preacher
[48:40] now that's wrong
[48:41] the bible preaches to us
[48:43] to seek god first so everybody should be
[48:45] putting god first in their lives
[48:48] and then the holy ghost will give us
[48:50] wisdom that orders all the rest of the
[48:53] events of our lives
[48:54] and decisions
[48:56] like there was a
[48:59] there's a brother a good brother
[49:01] a preacher he's alive today he said
[49:03] there was a man in his church one time
[49:05] he said brother a preacher so-and-so if
[49:06] you could just follow me around all day
[49:08] he said i could live a victorious life i
[49:10] wouldn't go to the cigarettes i wouldn't
[49:11] go to the alcohol i wouldn't go to the
[49:13] women
[49:14] and he said that would do you no good
[49:16] because then i would be your strength he
[49:18] said what you need is to repent get
[49:20] baptized and fill with the holy ghost so
[49:22] the holy ghost not follows you around
[49:23] but leads you around ahead
[49:26] hallelujah because he said the holy
[49:28] ghost will lead you and guide you into
[49:30] all truth amen
[49:32] i guess the testament was the brother
[49:33] did get the holy ghost
[49:34] and he didn't need the pastor to follow
[49:36] him around all day
[49:39] that's why the holy ghost was sent to us
[49:41] to lead us amen
[49:43] now if you have a question church i'll
[49:44] give you the best wisdom but the
[49:46] decision is up to you
[49:48] right
[49:48] i'll give you my best thought but
[49:50] ultimately you're responsible for your
[49:52] decisions
[49:53] i'm responsible for telling you the
[49:54] truth but you and i and i myself i'm
[49:57] responsible for the decisions i make
[50:00] i'm not going to give you selfish
[50:01] mandates like some examples there's this
[50:03] pastor in minnesota and i'm not going to
[50:04] call his name although he's a really
[50:05] wicked man but he he he's told people
[50:08] that are married divorced and i mean you
[50:10] can marry that one and you can marry
[50:11] that one he said don't buy this car he
[50:13] said go buy that car i mean that's just
[50:14] too much that's just overboard
[50:16] way overboard oh the one guy he said oh
[50:19] never have youtube i never have it now
[50:21] if you're struggling with youtube get
[50:22] rid of it but he says you can never do
[50:24] youtube he mandates all these details in
[50:26] people's lives that's a cult
[50:29] that's not the holy spirit leader that's
[50:31] a man leading
[50:33] and those people will never move on with
[50:34] god until they repent and get the holy
[50:37] ghost and really have a leader now
[50:39] someone to direct them so that they can
[50:41] say wow god is really guiding my life
[50:43] he's guiding me to holiness hallelujah
[50:49] and the fourth and final
[50:50] was they despise people outside their
[50:53] church
[50:55] this is why we got to love our enemies
[50:56] amen
[50:58] they have no tolerance for any belief
[51:00] system other than their own
[51:04] now church we got to realize jesus said
[51:05] there's two kinds of christians
[51:08] wise and foolish both are saved
[51:11] and we must love and respect our enemies
[51:14] as well
[51:16] praise god
[51:17] and just so people know they asked
[51:18] brother branham what will people do that
[51:21] don't believe the way you preach
[51:23] do they have to believe the way you
[51:25] preach
[51:26] will they be saved he said yes they'll
[51:28] be saved if they believe the lord
[51:31] how simple why can't people wrap their
[51:33] mind around this quote why do they go to
[51:34] other quotes and twist them
[51:36] brother man says you don't have to
[51:38] follow me to be saved
[51:42] now he said if they if they disagree and
[51:44] say i don't believe christ is the word i
[51:47] don't believe that's right i don't
[51:48] believe the baptism holy ghost well that
[51:49] shows where they're headed for the
[51:51] tribulation period
[51:53] so look brother says you don't need me
[51:54] to be saved but if you reject the
[51:56] promise of the bible it shows your head
[51:58] and you're not going to be born again
[52:00] you're going to be going to the
[52:00] tribulation period in other words he's
[52:02] saying i'm pointing you to be born again
[52:05] i'm pointing you
[52:06] to have the kingdom of god live inside
[52:08] you amen
[52:12] but those who can accept the word in its
[52:14] fullness not me preaching it
[52:16] preaching it because the bible says so
[52:20] those who accept that is free because
[52:22] the word's already been judged
[52:27] i'm just gonna say thank you jesus amen
[52:29] i gotta give a little worship and praise
[52:31] there hallelujah
[52:34] now see i'm just going to say this again
[52:36] jesus taught publicly every day he
[52:38] didn't hide his beliefs
[52:41] i'm not afraid of the critics i'm going
[52:42] to everybody's going to have them
[52:44] right if you try to do anything for god
[52:46] satan's gonna try to either hinder you
[52:48] or criticize you
[52:50] and it's gonna look like you're a
[52:51] failure but if god told you to do it do
[52:54] it praise god
[52:55] eventually you'll get the fruit that you
[52:57] desire to see
[53:02] see the only way to escape criticism is
[53:05] to do nothing
[53:08] we're all going to be fallible we're all
[53:10] going to make mistakes and the devil is
[53:11] going to accuse you no matter what
[53:12] whether you do it or not you're going to
[53:13] be accused that's what i've learned i've
[53:15] learned from jesus jesus wasn't scared
[53:16] i'm not going to be scared of what i
[53:17] believe
[53:18] if i make a mistake guess what god's
[53:20] going to forgive me
[53:21] he's going to try me again
[53:23] brother rand wasn't saying oh don't give
[53:25] anybody the tapes because i made a
[53:26] mistake there did he say that no
[53:29] he let the tapes go out even though he
[53:30] knew he made mistakes on some of them
[53:34] because anybody who has the holy ghost
[53:35] will be humble enough to recognize that
[53:38] that all people fall short of god's
[53:40] glory
[53:41] and every person is doing their best to
[53:43] serve god and although we fall short
[53:45] sometimes we get off the narrow road god
[53:46] will bring us right back to the middle
[53:51] all right now i feel you're kind of
[53:52] getting tired so let me try to see if i
[53:53] can close here that's okay everybody
[53:55] gets tired i get tired too
[53:58] give me 15 minutes here
[54:00] brother said
[54:02] god in spite of all the failure moses
[54:04] had done still had his hand on him
[54:07] and he called him to go do his service
[54:09] called him to his commission i preached
[54:11] this a while ago right
[54:12] and what a consolation that must have
[54:14] been to joshua when he heard say heard
[54:15] god say as i was with moses so i'll be
[54:18] with you
[54:20] although if i'm trying and i fail god
[54:22] will not leave me
[54:25] hallelujah
[54:27] i never have much confidence in no
[54:28] anybody that's too afraid to do anything
[54:31] i would rather be found a failure than
[54:33] too lazy to try
[54:35] but the bible says when you're in christ
[54:36] he's going to finish what he started in
[54:38] your life and you are more than a
[54:40] conqueror
[54:41] hallelujah you're more than in other
[54:43] words you're promised to get the victory
[54:45] amen
[54:46] as long as you don't sell out the sin
[54:48] and
[54:48] and
[54:50] lose all your reward as long as you keep
[54:51] pressing on and keep asking god to give
[54:53] you strength you cannot fail amen it's
[54:55] impossible for you to fail because god's
[54:57] in you amen
[54:59] hallelujah
[55:01] if you're really born again
[55:04] god will not leave you and the church
[55:06] said
[55:07] let's all say that god will not leave me
[55:09] ready god will not say it loud already
[55:12] god will not leave me amen it's
[55:14] impossible amen
[55:16] you're purchased by his blood amen
[55:18] you're a son or daughter
[55:20] you're adopted into the family you're
[55:22] not outside you're inside amen
[55:25] just like i could not get rid of my
[55:27] children how could i deny any of them
[55:30] haven't asked me for markers with
[55:31] animals on them yesterday i said yes get
[55:32] him you're my daughter amen
[55:34] well can i get something too careful yes
[55:36] adam you're my daughter amen i cannot i
[55:39] can't but help but give my children what
[55:41] they ask how much more of the heavenly
[55:43] father amen
[55:45] glory
[55:49] now sometimes great guys get together
[55:52] and you hear them say great so and so
[55:57] there's no great one he said don't
[56:00] never
[56:01] do that now listen church
[56:05] please
[56:05] i've got to be careful that too
[56:07] i've had brothers come in call me a
[56:09] mighty man of god if i'm not careful
[56:11] i'll let that become a prideful thing
[56:15] what i'm saying is i'm not i'm not i'm
[56:17] immune to this i've got to watch myself
[56:19] too
[56:22] don't never say well that's a great
[56:23] general so-and-so he's the most powerful
[56:26] preacher on earth he has no power except
[56:28] god gave it to him but the fact is he
[56:31] could lose that power if he breaks the
[56:32] word of god
[56:34] right
[56:35] like a balaam or a judas
[56:40] so he said no don't never do that we're
[56:42] getting to this great thing right
[56:43] brother ham's the greatest of all time
[56:44] well they're presuming
[56:45] they don't they don't know that
[56:47] the bible doesn't say that
[56:49] we have some clues
[56:51] but you got there's a whole lot of other
[56:53] clues too
[56:54] like the 24
[56:56] seats and everything he said there's
[56:58] only great one one great one and that's
[57:01] god
[57:02] we're brothers and sisters now i just
[57:04] thought this was so fitting i don't care
[57:05] if you're pastoring a church that's got
[57:07] five people in it
[57:09] that don't make you little
[57:11] that makes you a brother
[57:14] see if you're true to god's word
[57:16] don't care what how
[57:18] you don't get little god don't have
[57:20] little big children he just has children
[57:22] they're all the same
[57:25] in other words god looks at all children
[57:26] all the same now yes there will be
[57:27] rewards the people who really invest in
[57:29] their gifts they'll have a hundred full
[57:30] reward
[57:32] the people that invest in a 60 full
[57:33] weight they'll have a 60 full reward but
[57:35] in god's eyes they're all my children
[57:38] and they shouldn't argue about who's
[57:39] great down here they should try to go to
[57:41] the lost and hurting and they should try
[57:43] to help the people serve the people
[57:46] the gentiles jesus said the gentiles
[57:48] want to lord over people
[57:50] and be lords and generals and rulers and
[57:52] kings right natural kings
[57:55] the preachers
[57:57] he said they're all the same
[58:00] he talks about the doctrine of the
[58:02] nicolaitans right in the first church
[58:03] age what it do he said it's not a holy
[58:06] man or a holy hill it's a holy god a
[58:08] holy god among the people church he's
[58:10] with you just as he is with me
[58:13] if you've got the holy ghost he's just
[58:15] as you with just as much with you as he
[58:17] is with me praise god
[58:20] the lady has part of it we are children
[58:23] there's no great ones among us how can
[58:25] you have faith when you desire respects
[58:26] one from another
[58:28] we're all one in christ jesus there's no
[58:30] big man little man we're all the same
[58:31] we're the children of one father and
[58:34] we're his children so let god determine
[58:36] who's the greatest among us
[58:38] let's not go to where jesus where we
[58:40] know more than jesus and we know who's
[58:41] going to be sitting at the right hand or
[58:42] left hand
[58:44] why another jesus if he was here he'd
[58:45] say why are we arguing about who's the
[58:46] greatest
[58:48] just do something just finish the great
[58:49] commission
[58:51] remember the poor remember that paul the
[58:53] last thing paul said to peter he said
[58:54] just remember the poor brother that's
[58:56] what he said
[58:57] always remember the poor
[58:59] now we have the poor with us always
[59:00] right we're always gonna have the point
[59:01] with us
[59:04] but we learn when we're around poor
[59:06] people we see how humble we should be
[59:07] right
[59:10] that's why he said
[59:11] never forget the poor
[59:14] but people are arguing well i'm a
[59:15] greater general i'm a more powerful
[59:16] preacher than you that's really what
[59:17] they're saying although they're not
[59:18] saying it that's really what they think
[59:21] let's invite this brother he's the most
[59:22] powerful preacher
[59:25] he might have a great anointing
[59:27] but we should not exalt one man above
[59:29] another we should follow the leadership
[59:30] of the holy spirit
[59:34] now this is a lengthy one but just bear
[59:35] with me
[59:36] he says now the spirit of elijah on john
[59:38] would make john act like elijah the
[59:41] spirit of god upon you will make you act
[59:42] like who
[59:44] jesus who should you and i want to act
[59:46] like the lord jesus
[59:49] now there's where you find the holy
[59:50] spirit see that's what the holy spirit
[59:52] does it makes you
[59:54] meek
[59:55] makes you
[59:56] humble
[59:59] forgiving
[1:00:01] how can i tell you i have the holy
[1:00:02] spirit of jesus christ you're meek
[1:00:04] holy forgiving
[1:00:06] glory church glory
[1:00:08] can i get it amen can somebody say amen
[1:00:10] to this quote
[1:00:11] meek
[1:00:12] humble and forgiving
[1:00:17] that's how i can tell you have the
[1:00:19] spirit of jesus christ on you
[1:00:22] not prideful
[1:00:23] exalted and the greatest among everybody
[1:00:27] it's meek humble forgiving
[1:00:32] could they pull the whiskers from your
[1:00:34] face now sisters that's they they have
[1:00:35] to pull your hair right
[1:00:37] brothers they'll pull the whiskers from
[1:00:39] like austin's a great beard there that's
[1:00:40] great beer bud good beer good beer
[1:00:42] i don't use that word great too much
[1:00:45] there's nothing great but god right
[1:00:47] see could they pull your beard and like
[1:00:50] jesus he said spit in your face
[1:00:53] and you have the power to call legion of
[1:00:54] angels could you do that for the love of
[1:00:56] the people that was spitting in your
[1:00:57] face could you do it
[1:00:58] if somebody just walked up to you and
[1:01:00] said hey you hypocrite smack you on one
[1:01:01] side of the face could you pray for
[1:01:03] their forgiveness
[1:01:07] now that's where
[1:01:09] that's the test whether you got the holy
[1:01:11] spirit or in other words god is going to
[1:01:14] test you by letting people come against
[1:01:16] you
[1:01:17] and that's going to show you if you've
[1:01:19] got the holy ghost or not
[1:01:22] because jesus had to be tested they
[1:01:24] smacked him on the face they ripped out
[1:01:25] his beard they spit in his face and he
[1:01:27] said father forgive them they don't even
[1:01:29] know what they're doing they're blind
[1:01:32] and that proved he had the holy spirit
[1:01:33] inside of him
[1:01:37] so how do i know i have the holy spirit
[1:01:38] because i'm meek
[1:01:40] humble i'm forgiving
[1:01:48] when somebody says something evil
[1:01:49] against someone sometime that claims to
[1:01:52] have the holy spirit right some people
[1:01:53] say they have the holy spirit still
[1:01:54] speak evil
[1:01:56] if you say i'll get even with her if it
[1:01:58] takes me my last day can you imagine
[1:02:00] people live like that
[1:02:02] like brother says that donkey will wait
[1:02:03] till the very moment he'll wait years
[1:02:05] just to kick you
[1:02:07] right
[1:02:07] it just
[1:02:08] doesn't want to work you force it to
[1:02:10] work it's going to wait for that one
[1:02:11] time you're not looking that's going to
[1:02:12] going to kick you
[1:02:14] just to get back at you wait their whole
[1:02:15] life just to get back at you
[1:02:19] it's like we'll see like we talked about
[1:02:20] that yesterday people are waiting on the
[1:02:21] tech they're waiting for something that
[1:02:23] they can try to accuse you of when
[1:02:25] you're not even wrong but they're just
[1:02:26] waiting to accuse you of something
[1:02:29] and it doesn't matter if you're on
[1:02:30] facebook they'd accuse you on facebook
[1:02:32] if you're on youtube they to to accuse
[1:02:33] you on youtube if you were live with
[1:02:34] them they'd accuse you right there in
[1:02:36] the house it doesn't matter because they
[1:02:37] got this wrong spirit about them
[1:02:40] that's not the spirit of christ on them
[1:02:42] that's an antichrist spirit
[1:02:45] that's
[1:02:46] right now there's where you check about
[1:02:50] your holy spirit every say my holy
[1:02:51] spirit ready my holy spirit you've got
[1:02:53] your holy spirit
[1:02:55] hallelujah that's the check whether you
[1:02:57] got it or not
[1:03:00] blessed are you and men shall say all
[1:03:02] manner of evil against you falsely for
[1:03:04] my name's sake
[1:03:06] but you but you go get even with them no
[1:03:10] rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so
[1:03:13] persecuted they the prophets which were
[1:03:15] before you
[1:03:17] hallelujah
[1:03:22] let's see how many do i have here okay
[1:03:24] when someone says something evil about
[1:03:26] you and so you said say something good
[1:03:27] about them
[1:03:29] if you can't say something good about
[1:03:30] them then don't say nothing that's where
[1:03:31] i need help too we all need help with
[1:03:33] that
[1:03:34] just let it go now let me balance it out
[1:03:36] i believe too if someone says something
[1:03:38] against you you should probably go talk
[1:03:39] to them about it
[1:03:41] because the bible says don't let the sun
[1:03:43] go down upon your wrath
[1:03:45] jesus said if you go to the altar of the
[1:03:46] worship but you remember you got
[1:03:47] something against somebody he said leave
[1:03:49] your altar or leave your worship there
[1:03:50] at the altar go make it right then come
[1:03:51] back and worship
[1:03:54] so see that there's a balance to this
[1:03:56] too and then when you get to yourself
[1:03:57] pray for them
[1:03:59] if there's one thing in my life that
[1:04:00] helps me to understand that the holy
[1:04:01] spirit came into me down there that day
[1:04:03] has been that i was hot-headed fiery
[1:04:06] irish on both sides
[1:04:08] and i could always no i could never eat
[1:04:10] hardly any at all my mouth was always
[1:04:11] mashed up where somebody was punching he
[1:04:12] was getting fights so
[1:04:14] he's getting punched all the time
[1:04:17] now i'm going to this he said but
[1:04:18] something happened that old power that o
[1:04:21] william branham died and someone else
[1:04:23] came in hallelujah it makes me feel
[1:04:26] sorry for my enemy
[1:04:28] when anyone does anything to wrong me i
[1:04:30] never pray against them i pray for them
[1:04:34] and that's where the holy spirit gave me
[1:04:36] the test the other night in new england
[1:04:37] remember there was a couple making love
[1:04:38] down there on the front row and the holy
[1:04:40] spirit said whatever you say will happen
[1:04:41] brother didn't judge them he said god
[1:04:43] forgive you of that
[1:04:45] right
[1:04:47] he says forgive your enemies these are
[1:04:49] the spirits that make you evil watch
[1:04:52] them
[1:04:52] spirits in other words watch them
[1:04:55] doctrines of devils
[1:04:57] that you're greater than anybody so
[1:04:58] since you're greater you can call fire
[1:05:00] down from heaven you can close them you
[1:05:02] can do anything you can do anything you
[1:05:03] want no you can't do anything you want
[1:05:05] don't never think that i love that jesus
[1:05:07] said i can do nothing except the father
[1:05:09] shows me amen where's the scripture
[1:05:11] where are the people quoting that quote
[1:05:13] amen
[1:05:14] they're missing that quote jesus said i
[1:05:16] can't do anything except the father
[1:05:18] shows me first may we wait and until we
[1:05:20] know god has shown us something and then
[1:05:22] we can speak it
[1:05:24] and then we can pray for somebody
[1:05:27] but wait till the father shows us
[1:05:29] something first
[1:05:33] see spirits make people evil watch them
[1:05:37] spirits
[1:05:39] watch those evil spirits
[1:05:42] okay go to luke 4 real quick luke 4.
[1:05:46] luke chapter 4. i was just reading this
[1:05:47] this is my daily reading i just thought
[1:05:49] it was beautiful
[1:05:52] i got three minutes okay
[1:05:56] luke chapter six please luke chapter six
[1:06:00] i just wanna look at more scriptures a
[1:06:02] few more scriptures about greatness we
[1:06:04] don't compare ourselves to one another
[1:06:05] we compare ourselves to christ
[1:06:08] we in other words we judge ourselves by
[1:06:10] the standard of the word of god
[1:06:13] now i was i know there's at least two so
[1:06:15] this is kind of how i use my uh um
[1:06:19] my concordance
[1:06:21] oh look see all the times the word great
[1:06:22] is used i know you can't see that sorry
[1:06:24] in luke chapter six so chapter five
[1:06:27] once twice
[1:06:29] three times
[1:06:31] three times okay four times but only
[1:06:32] three apply to greatness okay
[1:06:35] okay so the first one is luke 6 23
[1:06:40] but we have to read 22 to get the
[1:06:42] context
[1:06:46] now you have to look at the screen i'll
[1:06:48] just read to you blessed are ye when men
[1:06:50] shall hate you when they shall separate
[1:06:52] you from their company they won't
[1:06:53] fellowship with you anymore and shall
[1:06:55] reproach you and cast out your name as
[1:06:58] evil for the son of man's sake
[1:07:02] rejoice in that day and leap for joy for
[1:07:03] behold your reward is great in heaven
[1:07:07] in other words church you can earn a
[1:07:08] great reward just by standing on the
[1:07:10] truth
[1:07:11] you don't have to travel the seven seas
[1:07:13] although god may call you there
[1:07:15] you have to build you don't have to
[1:07:16] build an orphanage
[1:07:17] right you have to fast
[1:07:20] every other day
[1:07:21] you can just stand on the truth and if
[1:07:22] you stand on the truth
[1:07:24] and you just you won't move from the
[1:07:25] truth you know god's word is true and
[1:07:27] love your enemies god said there's a
[1:07:28] great reward for you in heaven
[1:07:31] see god jesus makes it so simple where
[1:07:33] all of us can earn a reward not that
[1:07:35] we're trying to earn a reward but we
[1:07:36] want to stay true to him and he'll
[1:07:37] reward us if we're faithful we just want
[1:07:39] to love him amen
[1:07:41] well this ought to make you love jesus
[1:07:42] more that he makes it so simple that
[1:07:44] each of you can receive a great reward
[1:07:48] just stand on the truth let them speak
[1:07:50] evil let them not call you anymore or
[1:07:52] text you or fellowship with you anymore
[1:07:53] let them go but love jesus and rejoice
[1:07:56] and know that i've stood with the son of
[1:07:58] man who is the word of god
[1:08:06] verse 35 he says it again
[1:08:09] here's where your
[1:08:11] your wallet is connected to earthly i'm
[1:08:13] sorry heavenly treasures love your
[1:08:15] enemies do good and lend them money
[1:08:17] hoping that you don't get paid back
[1:08:20] if somebody's constantly asking you to
[1:08:22] pay them back they sure don't have the
[1:08:23] spirit of christ
[1:08:24] and you know what i'm talking about
[1:08:28] now if they need it back that's
[1:08:29] different
[1:08:31] but really
[1:08:34] really they should just be thankful that
[1:08:35] they were able to give if they had the
[1:08:36] real spirit of christ if they had the
[1:08:38] spirit of christ that would say i don't
[1:08:39] even want it back
[1:08:43] and i found it's just better to lend and
[1:08:45] not ask for it back
[1:08:47] and just never just get away from that
[1:08:49] even one back
[1:08:50] and the church said
[1:08:53] i like that
[1:08:54] anybody see any man on that
[1:08:56] anybody believe that it's just me okay
[1:08:57] it's okay if it's just me it's okay i'm
[1:08:59] just preaching the revelation of my
[1:09:00] heart you know just follow my faith you
[1:09:01] know
[1:09:04] he said
[1:09:06] lend and hope you get nothing back and
[1:09:08] your rewards shall be small
[1:09:11] your reward shall be great
[1:09:14] and in heaven you should be called here
[1:09:16] are the children
[1:09:18] of the highest
[1:09:20] how you use your wallet
[1:09:23] will either make you great in the
[1:09:24] kingdom of god or maybe put you out of
[1:09:26] the kingdom of god
[1:09:29] now look both of these so far is this
[1:09:31] only limited for preachers to get great
[1:09:33] rewards or can anybody get it
[1:09:35] i hope you say anybody
[1:09:38] anybody can get these things anybody
[1:09:41] can earn great rewards in heaven
[1:09:43] anybody
[1:09:46] standing on the truth
[1:09:49] lend the money and say you don't have to
[1:09:51] pay me back
[1:09:52] because you know in your mind you can
[1:09:53] think god's going to pay me back
[1:09:56] daddy's going to pay me back
[1:09:59] he will church
[1:10:00] he will
[1:10:08] and that's it right just those two
[1:10:11] one two yep just those two
[1:10:14] talking about great rewards how many
[1:10:15] enjoy that message praise god let's
[1:10:17] stand to our feet i'll just share one
[1:10:18] thing musicians can come that's my 15
[1:10:19] minutes that's about an hour maybe a
[1:10:21] little more i appreciate our visitors
[1:10:23] being very patient with me now sometimes
[1:10:25] guys i preach two hours you know
[1:10:27] so i'm gonna tell you guys
[1:10:29] you're very patient
[1:10:30] [Laughter]
[1:10:32] hallelujah i'm glad you can see that in
[1:10:33] your lives you know i just feel like
[1:10:35] though too if the holy spirit's speaking
[1:10:36] it don't really matter like you won't
[1:10:37] feel that full hour and a half for you
[1:10:39] because you're just you're tuned in
[1:10:41] you're listening
[1:10:42] and he said kind of god just makes your
[1:10:43] body forget you know you can feel a
[1:10:45] little bit tired but as long as that
[1:10:46] anointing of the holy ghost is there
[1:10:47] you're just your mind's on it
[1:10:50] and the time just
[1:10:51] flows by
[1:10:52] how did that just be an hour and a half
[1:10:54] how is that just an hour
[1:10:56] because we've entered up into heavenly
[1:10:58] places we ended up into a spiritual
[1:11:00] realm
[1:11:01] of understanding the word of god that's
[1:11:03] called revelation amen the spirit of
[1:11:05] knowledge and revelation in christ jesus
[1:11:10] but let me just i feel like there's
[1:11:12] maybe a one or two more i want to
[1:11:14] show here
[1:11:18] yeah another way people get rewards is
[1:11:20] if jesus told his disciples when you
[1:11:23] leave your house in other words when
[1:11:24] you're a missionary you leave your house
[1:11:26] your brothers your sisters your father
[1:11:28] mother wife children or lands for my
[1:11:30] sake you'll receive a hundredfold now so
[1:11:33] the greatest reward i can find in the
[1:11:34] bible is this one it's for a missionary
[1:11:38] so could brother branham yes brother man
[1:11:40] left his family numerous times for
[1:11:41] months on end to go preach the gospel
[1:11:44] could he have the greatest he could
[1:11:46] but you've also got to consider
[1:11:47] everybody else in the new testament
[1:11:54] there's a couple others i just want to
[1:11:55] show i hope this is okay i just want to
[1:11:57] show a few more i don't have time to get
[1:11:58] to all these notes and then i didn't
[1:11:59] have a whole lot of time as i wanted
[1:12:01] this morning
[1:12:03] i didn't get to the you know
[1:12:05] rapturing faith literally on the tapes
[1:12:06] but lord we'll get to that later
[1:12:10] i just felt like there was maybe one or
[1:12:12] two more things i wanted to say
[1:12:22] yeah let me read these on wednesday we
[1:12:25] read this
[1:12:30] play that spirit of living god fall
[1:12:31] fresh on me let's just do that one
[1:12:33] because how many need a fresh anointing
[1:12:34] of humility what do you say humility
[1:12:38] forgiveness was the other one
[1:12:41] big just thank you
[1:12:42] see you guys listening
[1:12:44] thankful for you thank you
[1:12:46] you're never better than preacher
[1:12:51] let's ask for a fresh anointing
[1:12:53] those three
[1:12:55] but here's what we read
[1:12:56] read wednesday
[1:12:58] read hebrews 11 those last six or eight
[1:13:00] verses they wandered in deserts they
[1:13:02] wore sheepskins ghostkins they were
[1:13:04] destined they had no food no money
[1:13:05] afflicted tormented
[1:13:07] how will our testimony stand up against
[1:13:09] theirs in the judgment
[1:13:11] let me just ask that now he knew the
[1:13:13] scripture those in the kingdom are
[1:13:14] greater than those in the old testament
[1:13:16] but then he says compare yourself to
[1:13:18] them
[1:13:20] how's your testimony going to stand
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:25] he said we're here to pray for mercy for
[1:13:27] those who are need all around the world
[1:13:29] in the mission fields now look he says
[1:13:31] we're in a big lovely building we're
[1:13:32] thankful for this nice dress warm
[1:13:34] well-fed people everybody well fed today
[1:13:37] amen
[1:13:39] but to think out in the mission fields
[1:13:40] there's men of god that don't have shoes
[1:13:42] on
[1:13:43] who was telling me jose was born he
[1:13:44] didn't have any shoes was that right

[1:13:56] to be able to get the new iphone

[1:14:07] shoes
[1:14:09] see how we need to see how we need a
[1:14:11] fresh anointing right
[1:14:14] oh god help me help all of us praise god
[1:14:18] without a pair of shoes on eating one
[1:14:20] plate of rice a week
[1:14:22] preaching the gospel
[1:14:23] oh god i pray for those men oh god i
[1:14:26] pray that you'll help them gallant men
[1:14:28] what will we do as we read the bible
[1:14:30] they wandered around in deserts
[1:14:31] sheepskins goat skins destitute of all
[1:14:33] these things who the world was not even
[1:14:35] worthy of what's our testimony going to
[1:14:37] be up beside them at that day so about
[1:14:40] preachers today
[1:14:42] they get one meal a week on christ
[1:14:46] what is our testimony
[1:14:51] father god we pray you'll shake us with
[1:14:53] your word bring us to ourselves that we
[1:14:55] might be lively stones fit in the
[1:14:56] tabernacle of god
[1:14:59] i pray that we'll go away singing
[1:15:01] melodies in our heart because of thy
[1:15:03] presence
[1:15:05] [Music]
[1:15:11] you
