========================================

probably something contagious so we don't want to spread people just want to be cautious about that Revelation 2 Verse 6 Revelation 2 Verse 6 I was kind of feeling then you know to study on this topic I like to preach on overcoming the Deeds of the nians I like toach that you know Cam and Simon spent a lot of time on that and then I got a questiona had a question about it so I thought I'll just preach out it I've already been studying on it to make a video about it I'd like to make a video on this topic just try to make it as simple as possible um so I'd like to preach on that I want to preach on the positive element of it that we overcome these deeds and doctrines basically it's just overcoming the Antichrist Spirit which we do every day hallelujah how many Overcomers we got out there praise God Amen Hallelujah so it's be little bit review you know maybe hopefully a few new things will be shared with you you know uh hope you'll be blessed um I just want to you I got an email for brother William Brother William sent Jose a text and then sent me a greeting through Jose so I email brother William and he said says these nice things and then he says thank you for raising all those little children that were born in the church to the glory of God and he says he says I urge you therefore he said to endure all things for the sake of these children that they also May obtain the Salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory amen that next he says I'm trusting God to grant me permission to visit you people again the face of our Lord Jesus Christ shine upon you all Shalom he says I thought I'd in that reading there nice to think of our brother Hallelujah thankful for God's grace Hallelujah so Revelation 26 and7 I thought it was very fitting you know these two verses go together you know it's just really striking to think about this Jesus hates Deeds of the Nick hates it but he loves worship you he loves your Praises he loves your prayers amen but he hates you know U he hates false doctrines is basically what the scripture says but then he tells us that we can overcome and we're thankful that we're Overcomers today as I studying this topic I was so blessed to see that we are not partaking these false doctrines we're thankful for the grace of God and the fact that we have pure doctrines proves that we have both the father and the son yes that's what the scripture says how many grateful to have Jesus I have him and he has me am Hallelujah I am my beloved my beloved is mine Jesus Is Mine amen Jesus is yours Hallelujah Jesus is fine hallelujah thank the Lord let's read that together if we can on three one two three but this this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nians which I also hate he that have ear let him hear what the spirit sayth unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of may God has blessing to read of his word you may be seated now darling I was just going to ask you we need to get home for the turkey or anything like that do I need to watch my time okay we were talking the other day how I might need to get or watch my time so I can get

Maybe cute hugs or something like that cooking up uh so yeah I'll try to I just try maybe preach an hour we kind of see how that goes I preach till hour and 5 minutes so anyway it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight and love you all and wish you a wonderful Thanksgiving hope everybody has a great time in the Lord I'm looking forward a few days off me take a couple naps by God's grace they had a good time the youth had a good time at the service on Sunday night got home about 12:05 I waited up for them so they had a good Fellowship afterwards all said they really like the sermon brother preached from what I understand it was really good preaching God's gra brother Sanger from Pennsylvania so I don't know him but maybe I'll pray about having him out here sometime so I want to look at overcoming the Deeds of niol I have uh some quotes and I actually took a nap yesterday so I stayed up a little later to study so I had a nice a lot of time to kind of get my thoughts ready like I said I've already been studying and thinking on this you know as I go through about my week and everything like that I just kind of when I think of a thought I just kind of em email myself the thoughts so my email inbox has all my thoughts for all the sermons and I can just them off there and kind of put them in these slides and uh just present it hopefully in a clear simple way hopefully it's uh very clear for you to understand by God's grace so I want to make this as clear as possible overcoming uh the Deeds of nians basically just means overcoming any false Antichrist teachings that's basically the the simplistic or the simplistic way to say it we read our text you know here's a simple summary this is from my 2021 book I wrote this but in the Ephesian age Jesus says he and the true V hate the Deeds of the nians and you'll see why in a little bit you'll see why I think I have uh n or 12 or 13 examples of Deeds of nickolus and then remember I'm going to review those nine doctrines of devils that I preached last year remember those I've show nine doctrines of devils um so you see why Jesus hates these things because they they take away from his glory they take away from his leadership okay remember we're not in that group so we're not going to we're not going to feel discouraged tonight we're going to be encouraged Hallelujah and Jesus has kept us from these things Hallelujah remember he keeps us from the evil one he keeps us from falling Hallelujah he keeps us in his nail scarred hand hallelujah we're in his grip tonight hallelujah amen so U the word Deeds is defined as Acts or undertaking so any act in the in a church any undertaking somebody takes up by the Antichrist spirit is a deed of a niad all right so one time you know I told you about this story you know somebody left our church and they said well I'm going to come up and I'm going to come back brother Jesse and I'm going to said he said I'm going to take that mic and I'm going to tell people that the rapture's already happened and you don't need to tithe and I said no you're not don't come to church if you're going to do that well that was if he would have said that and spread that he would have been spreading a deed of a nician because it's Antichrist it's anti Antichrist to say you don't have to pay ties and offerings that's Antichrist right I wasn't about to let him do that okay that's just common sense you know but I can let the Antichrist Spirit speak to us and we can absolutely help it right so any undertaking of Satan is a as a deed of a nician and they they often start as common just undetected Traditions or deeds that people do but they later advance and they become official Universal doctrines as we see in the uh pergan Church age and of course in the uh Ephesus for I'm sorry I forgot now saman I forgot sorry Ephesus subna peros thra sorry I got a little sickness I'm bound myself here so pardon me um but in the first church age Satan deceived lots of immature Believers with seemingly harmless Deeds as we'll see you know some people might say oh it's okay if they do that you know that's just their Liberty but if it's of Satan it's actually not a liberty it's a sin if it's of Satan so there's a difference between a liberty and then a deenul they're not the same Liberties are things that don't make us more holy don't make us less holy but Deeds of nicians make us sinful and I'll show you the examples here as we get this but I just want to put a clear understanding There Brother Marlin God bless you sir good to see you here tonight Hallelujah God bless you and also from my book I wrote now that's just the D's now the word nitin uh it either refers to a heretical group who found a man named Nicholas but I only found one resource on that or is a general term meaning to uh the Antichrist Spirit kind of like Jezebel right Jezebel in the New Testament wasn't a woman named Jezebel it was a spirit that was like the Jezebel from the Old Testament so either Nicholas was a real man in the first church age that conquered the leoty or it's just naming the Antichrist spirit that was working amongst the people we don't know for sure brother says he doesn't know for sure in the church age book but the word Nicholas means Victor of the people and that's where brother R gets the idea of of Conquering the Ley defeating the Ley all right and so I wrote in my book that Satan would get victory over the people through religious leaders who would be legalizing sinful deeds in churches so it would be preachers that legalize sin oh it's okay if you do that but in the whole scheme of themes it wasn't okay it was sin okay um but remember the progression of sin is always so deceptive yeah first first that people are tempted and they're drawn away by their own lust and they're enticed by it so tempted enticed and then lust is conceived and it brings forth sin and then sin ultimately leads to death so this is the four-step process of sin okay I'm sure you're familiar with it now another summary from me we basically overcome the Antichrist false doctrines remember the the Deeds are the first step of false religion right the Deeds are the first step the second step is where it actually becomes a Doctrine an official teaching in a church okay but we overcome all this by the anointing of the Holy Ghost which in our age has the attribute of a flying eagle so we're supposed to be able to fly up in spiritual places right Heavenly places that's why I always forget what time it is when I'm preaching that's why I always want to sing another song they just fly up in Heavenly places right just I just way I look at the Bible says we're seated in Heavenly places right so once we finally get to our seat it's hard to leave that spot hallelujah amen but we overcome the Antichrist by that anointing and that anointing it discerns good and evil in our daily lives and we choose to do the good amen remember all of our doctrines and our Traditions Traditions aren't bad as long as they don't break the word of God that's what the Bible says in two places it's okay to have Traditions remember because Traditions are they're just a shadow of Christ any tradition you have is just a shadow of Christ like brother BR putting up a Christmas tree brother BR wasn't sinning when he put up a Christmas tree the tree reminded him of Christ because Christ is a tree amen hallelujah but if you put up that tree thinking about Santa Claus well yeah that's a sin that's giving sa Satan or uh that's worshiping an idol right something that's not even real it's a lie and God's not into lies amen when the brother ra set up his tree you know and he was worshiping Jesus and you know uh you know enjoying just some family time and excited to you know worship and give his present or children gifts there's nothing wrong with that it's just a liberty it's just a tradition but the reality is that Christ is here today as the real Christmas present praise you get the Christmas present on Thanksgiving night hallelujah thank you Lord hallelujah that's the Holy Ghost praise God Amen thank you Jesus so you see there it's okay to have Traditions as long as they don't cont God's word Paul says that twice you can have a tradition by the word or you can have a tradition just by a spoken word or just a say and that's in uh uh 2 Thessalonians 2:15 we looked at that a few weeks ago so for us we got to keep Galatians 51 stand fast in the Liberty where with Christ has made us free and do not be entangled again with the Lo yoke of bondage yes I wrote the I typed the wrong word that should be again not against now in context Paul was telling them don't go back to circumcision you left that don't go back into that now for us it's don't go back into any Creed of man amen or any Tradition now those of us that were in denominations know that now even our saints that were raised in mess churches they might have had some doctrines that were maybe off the word they don't they don't want to go into that I don't know if they did but if they did they would know I wouldn't know we weren't there at their churches but I know in the mess of churches I I was in I can I can see a couple Traditions that I didn't agree with that maybe we're off the word of God right I could I could see that and so we want you know we're not perfect here we Pro I'm sure we have some faults at some point no doubt but we got to just keep our spiritual eyes open we got to keep that eye s so we can see our lives praise God Satan doesn't blind us right we don't want to be blinded to sin we want to recognize sin we want to confess it and we want a clean church before God Amen amen so we must stand fast in the liberty and not be entangled in legalism all right now the origin of course is what Jesus said basically you know he says he says You must keep your first love right amen and he says if you don't you're fall you're going to fall uh he says but keep your first love do your first Works always try to live your life like you just gotten the messag amen amen you just got saved try to keep that same fervency that same love for godj Lord Jesus and we know in Ephesus they did it I think they lasted I forget how many years they lasted 30 or 50 years and then God Jesus took all the churches out of Ephesus and destroyed the city right now it's rebuilt today but the old part from the Bible days that's that's all in Ruins you can visit some of the places there you know it's but they're in Ruins so in other words they didn't repent all the way so Jesus removed all the candlesticks Jesus removed all the Believers out of Ephesus and that's what God would do to churches today Message Church church if they don't repent God will take the real Believers out of there and he leave them in their Creeds and and dogmas that's right right they'll say just say what the tapes say or they say brother Ram already brother Ram is is Jesus they'll baptize in brother Ram's name or they're looking for brother Ram to return so they can have Rapture in faith you need the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost will give you Rapture in [Music] faith and so then after Jesus gives that warning he says but then he says I hate these deeds in nius I hate false doctrines in other words that's quite statement we don't want to do anything that Jesus hates we want to do things Jesus loves Jesus hates Antichrist teachings and because they're actually spiritual adultery right because spiritual adultery is any false Doctrine brother R tells us it's loving sin and then someone has left the first love if they have a deed of nickol they've left the word and this is no longer good enough now I got to have some lust of the flesh lust of some pride of life I got to have some part of worship that I want to have part of worship all right and so uh I'm just again uh summarizing here now I've already read that I just that that's a repeat up there now remember it's important to notice Jesus explains the evil progression of the Deeds the Deeds they're just they're just Traditions they mature to false doctrines where then the preachers they got all their scriptures to teach that their that their false doctrines right okay brother R said when it becomes a Doctrine it becomes an unbending way the preacher say either my way or the highway that's right with the false Doctrine now it's okay to say it's God's way or the highway that's okay to say God's word is the way if you don't want like that you can go you can leave the Highway of Holiness amen it's God's way or the leave the highway I'll say it like that the third step is bism which is uniting with false Believers right what did balum do balum led the Israelites to B peor where they had adulteries right where they had idolatrous religion they had a feast of Bor so it's basically Fellowship uh false Fellowship of false Unity with unbelievers and the last step is Jezebel religion right which is called the depths of Satan so there's four steps right to the depths of satanic religion and we know the Catholic church is the depths of Satan amen right so picture that you know the Catholic church is the depths of that okay so what's the step before that maybe other denominations that aren't as as quite as deep in sin as the Roman cathic cic Church Hallelujah now I I made this a few weeks ago I never shared it so hopefully this is helpful hopefully you can see some similarities here now the four horse riders are the white red black and pale of the first four seals and the church said amen amen the meaning is that the white one is deception it's the de and nicadan but it's defeated by the lion anointing the red is a spiritual kill but is actually a natural kill in the church ages it's the actual false Doctrine so the Deeds the Deeds change in doctrines defeated by the ox anointing but the black the black uh writer captures the wealth with the false Unity that's the doctrine of balum and that's defeated by the man anointed okay the last one is the pale horse rider that's total spiritual death it's Jezebel religion and that's defeated by the Flying Eagle anointing praise God okay that that that that's how that's how it's played out this was foreshadowed though in the Old Testament brother tells that because there was four forms of the same bug this is the same writer in four forms right it's the same bug in four different forms yes right right it's the same form for the same writer what's his name death but what's Jesus name life hallelujah what do you got and brother let me get back to this in in that in that reward of the Overcomer in the first church age brother Rand said if you overcome I'm giving you the tree of life and brother said the reason the reward is life is because the Antichrist Spirit came in by death the deeds and doctrines and all that was eventually death so so Jesus so the church CH if you stay away from the Deeds if you stay away from the Antichrist Spirit you get the tree of life Hallelujah if you stay away from Death I'll give you life that's what we got today eternal life hallelujah amen glor beautiful oh I love those rewards of the of the church ages it ties in perfectly with the church ages so remember the white hor rider was prefigured by the canker well thank you sister God bless you got a reward in the name of Jesus did you give it to me in the name of Jesus you got a reward you could have given any name of any disciple sister you could have said brother amen sister who thank you sister I actually need that tonight it's one of the few times I need water brother Rand said so see Satan now this is important for us Satan's going to try to come in as a white horse or as a Kang room to try to eat away our joy right it's the fruit he's going to try to take away the fruit the love the joy the peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Temperance Satan's if you're a holy ghost filled Saint wherever you are he's going to try to eat away on your fruits just like he's going to try to inject a a a deed a tradition in our church but we got to cast it down yes I say like we got to keep cast it down because we have cast him down amen hallelujah second though he tries to be a caterpillar he he grows up to the caterpillar he eats all the fellowship and the leaves so we got to make sure we stay in Fellowship now my best day to Fellowship is Saturday or Sunday so if you want more fellowship with me let's do those days so I got to work five days a week you know so that if you want fellowship with me that's going to how it's going to have to work by God's grace just and then you got your schedule too so we got to make it work that's why I say stay all day Sunday let's eat together let's do whatever we can let's Fellowship amen let's have that time together we just got to find ways to Fellowship amen but be encouraged too we have more services than almost every other church that I know of me Church most M churches are just down in two Services a week a week well we got three every week praise God hallelujah so be encouraged We Gather a lot a lot more than others by God's grace not to make us more holy or anything like that as far as it doesn't make us more holy we want to be more holy but we're trying to obey Jesus and gather more as we see that day approaching yes amen now the Third thir thing the Antichrist Spirit does he eats the doctrine of the bar now that's I don't understand how that's Doctrine but then you know they they get doctrines there so there's a little bit of a lap over I can't explain everything this is what brother taught in the restoration of the brid tree if you listen to that okay but he said then the locus is the mature form of that bug and that eats up the Salvation it eats the life of the the plant right the pul the life okay so does that help a little bit by God's grace remember cam had a good visual up there I took a picture that with my like I want to keep that amen I didn't actually apply that you know cams I forgot to actually look at cams first but uh you you get the idea of it praise God sure I'm sure you get the idea so for us Satan's going to try to get it he's going to try to fight Us by having me or some preacher or what somebody try to inject uh a tradition that's not based upon the word of God but we've got to overcome that by God's grace am now brother mainly teaches this on about six pages in the church age book from 9 1 to 96 and I'm just going to I'm going to summarize this brother R said holy ghost leadership gets replaced by man's leadership with the Deeds of nickolus uh what happens is the priesthood now becomes more holy and stands above the Ley so let me remind you I'm no more holy than you are if you see anything good in me well it's just because I'm trying to yield to God and I constantly have to do a be a public servant for Christ which means I got to constantly repent hum myself but I hope you're doing the same praise God Amen I believe you are but if I look holy it's all because of God's grace in my life I'm trying to repent of my sins I'm trying to serve God I don't want to be a hypocrite right I understand I got to be judged more harsh than other people here so I want to live my life close to Christ as I can hallelujah amen but I'm not above you now I have I have more responsibility as far as you know with a church but each one of us have to answer to God the Bible say every every one of you man or woman child whatever you will answer you'll stand before the Judgment seat of Christ am to receive of the good things that you've done for Christ hallelujah amen but Antichrist starts putting the preachers up above too high yes we're only above by responsibility but remember really brother man said the the the minister is supposed to be the servant the lowest of all that's why I try to I'm not saying this as a joke that's why I try to scrub those toilets I'm not trying to say that as a joke that's why I do because I got to remember I'm the servant of all I should be the servant of all if not I'm in the wrong place the person leading the church should be the humble most humble servant of all and if not it's time for me to repent at the altar right Jesus said make them your your servant your minister brother manam said the J and nians will TI them right back to the old aonic priesthood so it takes them back to legalism which reminds me of some certain Minister's marriage requirements right and I have a video on this and I've got rejected by this I got a lot of slack for this but I know brother Randon mentioned in the marriage and divorce sermon that ministers should marry virgins but to me that was just brother Ram's opinion because it's not in the New Testament brother Ram told us if you can't take it Genesis of Revelation it's not a Bible doctr right right so we're just doing what brother said now some preachers of the message make that such a uh a major doctrine that they hurt people with it especially sisters right especially sisters and like I said there's double standards if you remember when I preached on that I mean it's people people sent me comments like how could people not see what you preach brother Jesse this is this is so clear from the scripture but to me that's just one manifestation actually I didn't put that on the list that could be on the list of one of the Deeds of nickeles if people make this in unbending way right and brother Adam uses he Hebrews 13:7 uh that we need Holy Ghost L leadership we need the same leadership that was in the book of Acts where the preachers and everybody's led by the holy spirit amen hallelujah that's why I try to be I try to be led by the Holy Spirit I try to pray God send me the people at the right time help Lord send me messages to preach I always put on my reminders pray for inspiration to preach to the people I don't want to preach from my thoughts I want to preach from God's thoughts hallelujah amen amen amen another summary from this section of the book brother he starts listing examples of the Deeds of nians that became false doctrines the first one is Apostolic succession this mainly applies to the Roman Catholic Church in other words they believe all their popes go all the way down to Peter that's a lie right you see that that's why the pope can walk around and say I've got appos Sol sucession you know of course he doesn't walk like this I'm just kind of dramatizing He Walks Like This holding his staff and he says I'm a descendant of Peter no you're not Peter never took gold like that he said Silver and Gold Have I None Peter had a wife Hallelujah you're not you're not a successor of Peter furthest from the thing um but that's what that's what it came into and then church membership as long as you're a church member you're saved nonsense you're saved when you have faith in the blood of Jesus Christ yes we should get a church but the church can't save you the church can point you to the one that does save you that's Jesus amen now this is mostly seen in the Roman Catholic church but there's a few message churches though that I feel like they have a version of apostolic succession since they're Pastor new brother Brandon they're more closer to God than we are I don't believe that your life proves your life proves how close you are to Christ right I I want to be close to brother BR but really brother Bram was trying to be close to Christ Hallelujah and that's who whether I knew brother Ram or not I mean eventually we're get this spot of time goes on no one knew brother ROM and then what are we lost no to know brother random is not life to know Christ is life so I guess we're blasting Antichrist Spirit tonight the third one is brother R said they the Roman Catholic Church made acts 2:4 brother R said can you imagine if acts 2:4 said and on the day of Pentecost they were all filled with the Holy Ghost when the priest put a wafer on their tongues have you seen a Catholic service before they go up there I go up there and the the the priest puts a wafer on their tongue I've got the Holy Ghost out that's what they believe they believe as long as I got that wine as long as that's in my body I'm Anointed with the Holy Ghost what a bunch of nonsense as long as I'm singing his Praises I've got the Holy Ghost as long as I confess my sin I'm filled with the Holy Ghost AM Hallelujah that's what the Bible says be filled with the spirit don't be drunk online but be filled with the spirit talk to yourselves in pongs and hyms and spiritual Psalms amen glory thank you Jesus thank you Jesus now to me the message version is that is just believe brother brandom and you're born again that's the same thing same thing is saying put this wafer and you got the Holy Ghost the same thing is you you believe in brother BR you're filled with the Holy Ghost that's a lie fourth brother R said they made water baptism pouring instead of immersion now today it's baptize the name of William Brandon which is heresy which is blasphemy yes that's blasphemy to baptized in the name of William Brandon we only baptized in the name of Jesus Christ yes amen hallelujah I got a man that said uh I made a video on that he said no William brandham is my God I said what question mark question mark I said repent of your blasphemy amen you are deceived by brother Brandon himself said I'm Not Jesus Christ right I'm not even I'm a sinner saved by grace he said I'm not fit to live he said i't say that be humble I said repent sir and then brother uses this verse Paul warned them for three years remember wolves are going to come in not sparing the fly so how are they going to get in they were going to get in and deceive people they said draw people after their own selves pull them out of the true church with their deeds and nicadan with their Antichrist teachings I'm going to get to the list here in just a moment thank you for your patience the fifth one the priests are holier than the le le Nici means conquer the L Paul said all Lees should have the leading of the Holy Ghost some message people don't have a Ministry like the pastor in other words everybody I I look at my life like I got to constantly Minister you should have that same view and that's why I want everybody to grow into that now amen's got it built in he's are him and I we already got it built in Casa Mali Lydia they already got it build in but they can have more I can have more we all can have more Ministries but youve got to look at it just like I look at it I I've got to preach I got to pray I got to feed the people people of God you got to look at the same way you have an important part for every service praise God Amen that's what brother R says brother R said it's essential that you do it now how many believe brother brand it's essential that you look at your ministry like it's just as important as brother Jesse's Ministry amen hallelujah see as we mature we're going to get to that everybody's going to see that more and more we'll get to that by the grace of God and I love this verse brother R say how is it brotherr how is it when you come to church when you come together every one of you got a song Everybody's Got a song to sing everybody's got a Doctrine Hallelujah Glory everyone's got a tongue everyone has a revelation at least we should have that one praise God everyone hath an interpretation let all things be done to edify in other words you should come to church saying I Lord this blessed me maybe I can share with somebody at church right right like a quote like a song like a scripture right think think of something you know that will bless other people like one example when Zur you know she texted me that video about the Barbie well that out of that came a sermon and that blessed a lot of people remember that I preached on the Lord Lord God of Lords I'm Lord yeah Lord God of gods that was a good that was a good thing she had a little she had a revelation she had a a teaching she wanted to share that was good I like that Hallelujah so see we got to be led by the Holy Spirit you know God doesn't just want us to hear here here God wants us to share amen right that's just the recent one I thought of so thank you sister thanks for that water too by get drink now here's that quote brother rson he's talking about brother Neville Pastor uh Collins and Hickerson were brothers that could do tongues interpretation he said now their tongues interpretation that's not brother Neville's Ministry that's your Ministry to the brothers Neville I'm sorry Hickerson and Collins I'm giving this as an example then you Brethren should be just as interested in getting your ministry in the place of the house of God as the pastor is interested in getting in his because it's just essential that you do it there is no better feeling for me than to hear people say oh I just needed to hear that sermon brother Jesse I like when they say it when guest preachers come but I like when you say it when I preached you so that I haven't missed a too much that I prayed I I've sought God I studied I've done my part or the Holy Ghost Falls while we're worshiping and God uses my gift I love that praise God Amen but it's essential it's essential and I believe as the Rapture is nearing each and every person is going to realize the importance of your gift yes Hallelujah and so you either pray at home for the gift or or you'll pray here when you get to the gift or pray after you know the thing is pray the thing is realize you got a Ministry nobody can do what you can do only you can do it praise God H and we need that praise God I need your gift you need my gift we need one another praise God amen amen amen and you know Church honestly these last few months when people come up for prayer I just asked the Lord over here Lord who should I call up should I call up anybody to pray because I'm looking out there and I'm think well Lord who's got faith maybe that faith that would help my faith like who was sick on Jose I almost called up some people to pray for him but some people were busy you know I like well I'm starting to do that I'm trying to think who who can I look out during the service and I feel like they've got faith anointed that they'll pray the prayer Faith hallelujah amen I want to feel led to do that praise God I want you to use your gifts as well right each person has a gift each person has a Ministry remember Satan's job is to say oh only the preacher can do this only the now only the preacher can preach but other than that you can do everything else hallelujah amen Satan's job is to conquer the lady make the preacher he's the only holy one and you know me I'm I'm not holy the only holy thing in me is the Holy Ghost there only a part of me that's holy just like you amen I'm no better than anybody I've got my gifts I got to be faithful to my gifts you've got be faithful to your gifts amen six brother in the same six pages brother BR the sixth thing is the Vicor of Christ which is the pope seventh is Purgatory eighth is mass now a lot of these things don't pertain to us as messy believers the ninth is the Roman Catholic Church started paying money to get out of hell these are these are the examples brother bam gives of the Deeds that turned into doctrines of the nians now he also taught on this on the last uh chapter re uh chapter 10 is called the resume of the church ages and he kind of reviews and hits the highlights of the entire book um and then he gives a little more detail 10th now this is interesting brother Ram said when they got the Deeds of nicadan the clergy set themselves in ranks over one another so these preachers said well we're a little bit better than these preachers and these preachers are a little bit better than other preachers that reminds me of some goat debates they had last year that's what they're saying they're saying they're greater than other people so see to me that's what it is the goat debate is a manifestation listen of the Deeds of nicolus that's my thought it's not a Doctrine yet as I emailed the brothers I said give me the scriptures they didn't have any scriptures the only scripture was uh the only scripture was John the Baptist with Grace in the Old Testament so they're presuming brother brandom is the greatest and then if we preach brother Brams then we're the greatest preachers ever we preach his ministry but was they do they actually have literal scripture that says that no to see how Sly that Antichrist spirit is and but I have the scripture anybody who argues how great they are does not have the Holy Ghost I got scripture for that Hallelujah Jesus's own disciples before they the Holy Ghost I'm greater no I'm greater no you're greater I'm greater 11 these are quotes from Brother R within the true church men whom God had called as overseers were holding that title to mean a little more than just local responsibility so this is rare in my opinion but it only happens when p p P try to Pastor more than one Church see I was having my typos last night sorry not more than on church but one church or they travel too much while still taking tithes right let's say you're gone three months how can you take a tithe when you're gone three months you didn't feed those sheep for three months how can you naturally they a Shepherd if he's gone three months he can't drink the milk of his sheep right or whatever goats whatever he can't enjoy the tithing right he ain't there so see it's just off the work but they're rare cases right but this is what happens now where we would see it is where a pastor tries to have more than one congregation where he could P like that's what that's what the denominations do I'm just going to say the name Grace Church that's what they do they'll have one group and then they'll have all their satellite churches out there well that's not scriptural every church should have a sovereign Church Sovereign Pastor Right One Pastor shouldn't LED over six or seven other congregations of pastors right that's denominational that's too much Authority that gives that man too much power right Hallelujah but remember church now look Solomon said it's the little foxes that spoil the the the bride tree can I say like that and then Jesus said the Pharisees Sadducees they they paid tithes on the mint of the Anis and the cumin but they omitted the weigher matters of the law judgment mercy and Faith these ought you have done but not leave the other undone so see churches can let either little sins ruin their congregations or big sins right so either one we've got to be diligent with big things we got to be diligent with little things too and not to become micromanagers I'm not trying to micromanage your life not to become CR criticized and everything we got to have Liberty amen but I believe the Holy Ghost will show us if we're off the word in anything especially if I'm up here asking God to show me my faults and my wrongs I'm begging God God I've done wrong please show me right same same thing for you if you're asking God to cleanse my heart and keep me pure don't you think God's going to do it amen don't you think God's going to wash you in the waters of the word certainly certainly it's already 7:30 wow now I want to read this quote here this just encouraged me woman is a little thing it's a small thing in the Bible right it's a modesty thing right it's a it's a h ship thing it's an honor thing right women must honor their husbands or honor their their fathers right until they're married well says if you catch it in these little minor doctrines you'll catch the major doctrines amen hallelujah if you're faithful in the little things he'll make you ruler over many things amen amen that's right he said like Gideon separating these men there's thousands and thousands but God said that's too many separate them again he gave them another test and separated them again again and on down so he had a little handful he said that's the group I want you to do the job that's exactly what happened Pentecostal women going back and forth sitting there hearing it knowing by the word that's wrong you think they'll cope with it no sir every year when I pass by there's more Bob haired than there was when I started said what's that got to do you ought to someone said why brother R people regard you as a prophet now I don't say I was a prophet nobody hears me say that but yet he did say under the anointing so see he something he doesn't remember sometimes what he said under the anointing because some the Holy Ghost takes over for him the son of man anointing takes over Hallelujah that's right he says why don't you teach people to receive the Holy Ghost and how to get this and great good great spiritual gifts and help the church how can I teach them algebra when they won't even learn their ABCs that's right you do the little things get down here at the bottom and brush it off and start off right amen hallelujah like a simple illustration brother Irvin last when I was there two weeks ago he showed me the pictures of the house when they moved in that house that house was an absolute dumpster fire it was covered in Vines and trees inside trash was everywhere that's the grossest looking thing I've ever seen they said they found uh brother irban found four S foot long snakes living in there just inside the house it took them four months to clean that house now why am I saying that because they left the Amish communities and said we feel led to come down here now you go in their house today it's SP and span you wouldn't see even an old snake skin you wouldn't even see the dust off a snake's belly so clean what happened they got down I love I love it God Did It God's doing in the spiritual what he's already done in the natural there Hallelujah they had to brush it down for four months and clean up and get all the me you and the mold and the trash out they to burn all this up get down to the very bottom that's what we do as Christians get down to the very Basics just start right just learn how to repent just learn how to be saved and then build on that praise God get these little things right get the first thing right get the foundation right then you can build on that praise God clean out the Bottom clean it all all the way down to the bottom amen build your foundation on a rock of God's word amen amen hallelujah don't take any person's guess for it you take the word of God for it amen hallelujah always believe Christ that's the ABCs that I know always believe Christ now remember this verse there's six foundational uh teachings that most churches fail on just the second one so here's a list I'm sorry they fail on the first one most churches fail on the first of the elementary doctrines they never repent of their fornication their adultery right their addictions uh their cursing their blasphemy they never even repent of that how are they going to go anywhere with God if you never go to the first step oh but church if we can if we can look at our lives and honestly say God has already built those into our lives then we know we're maturing as we've been preaching on maturity amen we know we're moving on to perfection the fivefold ministry is perfecting us hallelujah amen remember that so this is basically justification sanctification repenting from all dead works this is Faith towards God not towards denomination not towards your mom your dad your grandma the pastor it's Faith towards God hallelujah amen amen doctrine of baptisms that's the water baptism that's the Holy Ghost baptism I got a new one this week it's also the baptism of suffering Jesus said Jesus said I have a baptized a bapt say I'm going to be baptized with and he said I'm straightened until it's accomplished that means distressed so see there's there's something that we can learn there I learned that this week that's right there is a baptism of suffering in other words some people's lives are swallowed up in suffering and you look at their lives and say why do they suffer that why did Paul get whipped five times you know 39 stres why he had to go through the suffering he had to go through the baptism of fire some people have to go through that some people lose loved ones unexpectedly some people lose things and you wonder why they got to suffer so hard it's a baptism they got to go through God ordained their life for that right God ordered all the steps of the righteous then laying on of hands right you don't lay somebody uh you don't anoint somebody real soon right after they got saved they need time to prove themselves but also you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover the resurrection of the Dead Z and I were texted about this and there's two resurrections right the resurrection is the rapture that's called the first resurrection the second Resurrection is the white Throne judgment yes but most people don't know there's two resurrections everybody thinks well we're all going to live through the Millennium no we're not many people are going to miss out of the Millennium right they'll they'll still have eternal life they'll still be saved under the altar they're going to miss out on on that great time think about that judging judging Nations for a thousand years my goodness that's that's going to be quite a thing we don't want to miss that church we don't want to miss that right judging Nations building houses inhabiting them for a thousand years amen judging cities ruling a city for a thousand years you how many times we drive down to barbon We complain about the potholes in barbon I tell you when we get some cities we're going to do it right not just once every 10 years we'll do it right that's just a small example right but the Bible said in those days when you if you're a judge of that City or if you're the ruler of that City the Bible said there will be a sound and you command everybody to go to the house of the Lord for worship Hallelujah and All Nations shall flow into that worship hallelujah amen you say City it's time time to go up and worship Our Savior follow me I've got a ride of ir too his the bigger one of course he's the great man of God he's the great God in flesh hallelujah we're just his servants but he's rewarding us for sacrifices made here if you suffer with him here you'll reign with him there praise God Amen but don't forget this remember to get to that you got to be mature remember read we preached on this a few weeks ago might have been last week no two weeks ago two Wednesdays ago be therefore perfect be mature as your heavenly fathers mature so judging everything in your life now not illegalism I doing good or am I doing evil each day is this evil for my life or is this good for my life right that's maturity now I wrote about the deeds in my uh book there four pages 428 429 now I I I found more examples as I studied the same history books brother brandom did holidays that's him that's kind of a a stinger for some people you know Christmas really is a stinger for a lot of people but holidays can be Deeds of nickolus okay if it's taken into excess like like like right with Santa Claus or people buying gifts they can't even afford don't put yourself in debt to give out a gift right right don't do that don't don't be pressured into that don't put yourself in a bad position you know because that brother said that's the spirit of commercialism that's not the spirit of Christ right you're caught up well this person gave me this I got to give it back just give him a hug back if you can't afford it just draw a little picture WR a thank you no I love you and I'll be praying for you they'd rather have your prayers than you know you getting in debt right idolatry they actually built actual Idols in these temples when poar went back to Rome in 155 ad the Eucharist water baptism that's a repeat and clergy of BU lady that's a repeat now when polycarp he was a student of St John when he went back to Rome to see what it's like he actually went there knowing they were entrenched in idolatry but when he went back what did he witness he watched them all like candles they go up to a statue of Peter and they bow down to Peter that's in role and brother said this is a doctrine of the nicadan now I believe that it probably already advanced at that point to Jezebel religion because Jud Jezebel religion is not ashamed of Idols Jezebel wasn't ashamed to have a church of Idols neither is the Roman Catholic Church all right okay so another one I saw was transubstantiation we're turning that the the the wafer and the the wine we're turning that into body and blood of Jesus that's a lie that church has had some issues with some other things too especially with vows and marriage they they let their children break vows they're already engaged but they break the vow let them marry this one and that one that doesn't sound like the Bible to me but see even you would think well how could that be in a mess of church well how could it how could it not Satan's F fighting them that hard right and they if they give into Satan if they love those Spirits R said then they they can't get delivered from those Spirits because they love that they love politics I'll say like this they love having their own way rather than the Holy Ghost having his way our prayer should be holy ghost have your way tonight amen I'm forgetting my opinions I'm forgetting my thoughts I don't want my way Holy Ghost have your way now this is review from last year so I don't know if sisters or if you were here when I preach this but I want to show it to you um would have been good for Lena to be I don't know yeah she was here yeah yeah she was here that's right so these are examples I gave last year eight ex doctrines of devils I believe some of them are clear in the scripture some of them are uh message Traditions from churches that have fallen to the Antichrist spirit so these are Deeds that became doctrines now the first one remember the Bible said there seducing Spirits doctrines of devils when people leave the book of Acts all they can get is doctrines of devils yes yes true the first one this is a this is in the Bible Paul called it preachers that said you have to to be single to be a preacher Paul said that's of the devil the second when they say you can't eat meat on Friday yet they'll eat fish on Friday Paul said that's a doctrine of Hell remember he said the kingdom of God is not in meat and drink but it's Joy righteousness and peace in the Holy Ghost amen that's the meat for the Holy Ghost brother it's not in fish or thank you Lord beef or whatever more ham is a pork it's not in that that's not the kingdom of God it's the Holy Ghost attributes hallelujah amen peace joy and righteousness he said that's a doctrine of the devil another one is the raptures already happened that's of the devil Paul said it no fasting that's of the devil right that's what the Bible says look it up it's Philippians 3:19 their God becomes their belly think about that they worship they worship their belly and say okay I hear your ground now I'm running over to McDonald's for the fourth time today or fourth time this week they worship their own belly I got to feed you more I got to feed you more or Chipotle for the fourth time today it don't matter the it's not the the restaurant is not I mean it could be the problem restaurant restaurant is not always a problem the restaurant is a the lust of the flesh that's the problem amen worshiping their own bellies and doing it for money right trying to get the money from the preachers the preachers trying to get the money and they serve their own belly that's a doctrine of a devil turning Grace into lawlessness or once saved always saved everyone will go to heaven right that's from Hell God always wants you Healthy and Wealthy that's from hell and the church said amen preach on that one hard enough make presuming and just presuming and preaching it like his Doctrine and exalting brother brandom and his followers as the greatest of all time and they never say except for Jesus they never say that that's a doctrine of a devil in my opinion nobody God does not share his glory with anybody right and the person Jesus called the greatest didn't consider himself the greatest so how can these preachers that consider consider themselves the greatest how can they be the greatest if they consider themselves the greatest it doesn't fit the pattern right they say rapturing faith is literally on the tapes rapturing faith is an anointing from Heaven praise God Amen it's not literally on the tape it's preached about on the tape but it's not on the tape it's not a possession of the tape it's God's possession amen amen see it's a worshiping the tape it's a demon getting your attention off Christ yes worshiping a man worshiping a machine brother said God never ordained for machines to preach the gospel Glory amen hallelujah or Angels or the wind or animals he said men men that were washed in the blood of Jesus filled with the spirit of God Amen that's who God ordained to preach Not Angels right also making a tradition out of brother's like well brother Ram did this one time I can do it and what they do is they just make an excuse to enjoy sin the example I showed you was with movies right brother R supposedly watched a few movies we don't know how much of the movies he watched so some brothers preaching and said well now I have this license I can watch whatever I want that's a lie from hell right that's a doctrine of a devil that's straining at a knat swallowing a camel well brother Adam said he did this and that but then you added your own interpretation you swallowed a camel you took on all this sin now I believe this this is my this is my opinion but I I got a little bit of scripture for it but I'm not going to say it's a doctor Holy Ghost filled Saints can only go so far on this four step attacks from Satan the Deeds the doctrines bism Jezebel I believe a holy ghost filed Christian can only go to that first step that's what I believe I don't believe a holy ghost filed Christian can preach a false Doctrine and make it the unbending way I don't believe that okay that's my own opinion now could they be saved yeah but they' be foolish virgin that's what I believe like think of all these nice think about all these nice Pentecostal people that speak in tongues they tongu the evens yet they'll go over and they'll make they'll make tremendous sacrifices to try to win souls and save Souls they'll do missionary work and some of them are so sincere right and they're not rich they're not making money Baptist even Baptist I've seen Baptists go to Kenya uh they they sacrifice you don't think God going to honor that God's going to honor that right but they got some false doctrines right like no dancing they say no shouting no screaming no speaking in tongues that's what the Baptists say that's a Doctrine that's a false Doctrine that's a doctrine of the nians all right now now you brother just you say how can you say that because they're ignorant of it they don't even realize what they're doing now some of you weren't in Domination some of you were but listen I was in denomination I was baptized follow in the Holy Ghost I didn't even know what I was doing I thought I was right with it amen some of these people they're just ignorant of it they do not understand did you understand the right baptism when you were in the CMA I'm startor pointing at you ones I know her denomination no you don't even you don't even know you're trying your best to serve God some of these people they're they're preaching doctrines of nians and they don't even realize what they're doing right because it ain't the time and season for a gift right now here's my doctrinal proof Peter and Galatians 2 I use this illustration all the time you're probably like falling asleep brother why you going to use a different illustration but it's so critical for us because he's a holy ghost filed man and he separates himself from fellowship so look like the bugs start eating some of those leaves there right interesting Holy Ghost F man he has a deed of anul right that's a that's a false it's a false teaching he taught all the Jews think about he taught all the Jews in the church don't eat with the don't eat with the Smiths he taught every don't eat it with them they're unclean now they might have some sickness in their house that's not what he was talking about he was talking about Gentiles are just dirty people Jews are normally cleaner people see but but he got corrected praise God yes and brother said polycarp was a mighty man of God he the Roman Catholic Church said either we're going to kill you or your town and polycarp at 95 years old gave himself up to be burned at the steak that's a man of God right there he said don't kill these children don't kill the he said take me and then they burned him alive that's a real man of God but brother said he leaned a little bit he wasn't militant against nanism um brother R said he used the word Bishop a little too freely and he let the he let the pastors have too much influence over other churches that they were not pastoring so brother Ram said that's what history says about polycarp but see he can still be a holy ghost filed man of God what is like brother said what is your and my testimony going to be to his right what is it going to right we have an easy life you know nobody hates us we get some few bad comments or people don't want to hang out with us anymore but we're not being burned the steak with the Gospel of Jesus Christ that's why I always want to humble myself what is my testimony just helping to be something God me have some testimony praise God have to beat myself up or I'm not trying to beat you up I'm just saying let's respect these Saints who have gone on before us praise God hallelujah amen not call ourselves the greatest all time we never do I'm just preaching to the audience there these people that some of them hopefully some of them can be convinced to leave the tape Church movement or these preacher movement that exalt the preachers as the greatest of all time they could leave that so I believe based on these examples a holy ghost F Christian can only do the deed step they'll never go into the false Doctrine that's what I believe but I'm not saying I'm right I'm just saying those are the examples I can find okay now I put a video out about this today it was pretty well received I forgot about this I shared this with Simon and cam Simon and cam like to preach on the deeds and the uh uh the doctrines of nicadan which it could be helpful it's helped me but here's a quote brother R was preaching in 1951 out in Arizona and you're going to you're going to listen to me read his quote brother Ram wasn't planning on prophesying but the Holy Ghost comes on him and he prophesies right there about the Rapture Hallelujah and his his scripture is Solomon taking all these stones from around the world and bringing them to one place and they all fit perfectly amen that's his that's his prophecy about the Rapture that's what God's going to do before the Rapture remember where did all those stones got to be cut they weren't cut in Jerusalem they were cut out in their native lands Hallelujah so where are we going to get cut the Rapture no sir we're going to get cut way before the Rapture way before this body comes together God will cut us in a amen he'll cut us in Alan he'll cut us in Sheffield he'll cut us in Iowa he's going to cut us and then bring us together at that great Gathering Place of the building of God the meeting in the air praise God beautiful am when Solomon built the temple they was cut out from all over the world when they come back together there wasn't a buzz or a saw nor the sound of a hammer every block no matter if this one might have been cut like Oneness or Tess or greess or the finess whatever it was when they come together they went dovetail one with the other now I believe this could even mean denominational people could get saved Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost right before the Rapture hey if God did it with Samson God could do it with other people too right God does quick work sometimes right amen right like think about uh the Ephesians they were Justified Sanctified they just needed to know there was the Holy Ghost and as soon as Paul laid hands on them the Holy Ghost fell on them praise God hallelujah they just need that one extra key to unlock that last door amen amen hallelujah there wasn't any arguing there wasn't any buzzing once the stones all came together amen I love this mad as people wasn't any arguing wasn't any fussing they just went together made the temple of God that's right I believe that God is cutting out everywhere Born Again children of God and going to bring them together Glory I may not live to see it but I hope I do of course he didn't live to see it but I hope we live to see it but someday now here's where he prophesy you remember there's young people sitting here someday these denominational barriers look what he says what what kind of barriers denominational barriers that struck me I mean I've heard this quote for years I made a video of it 13 10 years ago but he said one day these denominational bears that we have and Fanatics you ever hear some Fanatics around the message sometimes they call us Fanatics I'm a fanatic for Jesus I'm a fanatic for everywhere in that Bible praise God hallelujah there are some Fanatics around the message someday those barriers now to me those Den if he's talking about denominational that's got to be a deed denominational barriers that they scooped around and separated people you ever seen people uh you know Naomi and be I talk about time preachers that will separate a church they'll split a church over something small brother says someday people that have separated people some someday those Bears will be taken away and God will bring his church together oh and take it hold just as certain as anything what's the example Solomon all those stones were cut out and then shipped right to Jerusalem so Solomon could place him in there with his uh anointed men that had the Holy Ghost anointed you're place here your Ephesus your samna your pergamos your thy your Sardis your Philadelphian here we are all these L SE of stones coming together for the rure amen I'm glad I put right next to you brother I put right next to you brother martin we're all put there together ready for this body to be finished and then the spirit of God will fall hallelujah amen Oh Glory Hallelujah they're going to come that's prophecy remember that I spoke that in the name of the Lord Lord now you can put that down on on the book now that was is true that's thus say the Lord God is going to break down denominational bearers now to me now I put in my that's my idea I think he means these and nicadan because Peter had some and he was a holy ghost filled saint but look how God broke it down most of us we don't want God to break us down like Peter got broke down right right we want God to break us down at home when no one's around right we don't want the preacher to come up and blast you did it you did we don't like that so much but Peter had to suffer through it to me it don't matter as long as I'm a stone amen I just want to be there praise God Amen what Lord whatever you got to break down in my life just break it down I want to be part of that Temple hallelujah amen amen I don't want to be left in the tribulation I want to go up to heaven as the body of Christ as a portion of that body of Jesus Christen well Raam said look I didn't know I was going to say that that's right that God will bring a church together you can depend on that as long as you argue and fuss with one another you're in kindergarten see I don't argue and fuss with people but I do reason with them like Paul did I don't argue and fuss God will keep you there until you learn enough to get out of it that's all amen well praise the Lord all right that's right get out have faith step out on the word of God and look now I give some examples from the Bible some more examples the disciples said we seen one casting out devils and we forbid him there starts your denomination again I yes in other words anybody says you don't belong to my message Church you're not a part of it that's a devil that's the Antichrist Spirit you don't belong to our group you ain't a holy ghost filled Christian that's the devil that says it right said forbid him not amen be one with him that's all go join up if they won't join up don't forbid him go on that's the way to do it yes and right about 8 o' so pretty good timing there by God's grace H I'm just happy my voice about going out too I done preach my voice out again remember brother uh preached invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ he preached it right around Thanksgiving brother R said talk about a Thanksgiving brother Brown preaches a sermon called The Invisible Union of the Bride of Jesus Christ and at the end he says this doesn't might not sound like a Thanksgiving message to you he said but he said talk about Thanksgiving he said I'm more thankful for that than anything I know so this tonight overcoming the Deeds of nicas might not sound like a Thanksgiving message but I'm more thankful to overcome the Deeds of nickan than anything else I know other words I'm so thankful to overcome the Antichrist spirit that I can just be pleasing to the Holy Spirit God talk about Thanksgiving Hallelujah Glory hallelujah thank you Jesus talk about it next year here's the quote says he the bridegroom took away your shame amen and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life amen that's what the Bible said see everything I preach up here that's what the Bible says amen amen these people try to tell me brother didn't preach the Bible I said you have not listened enough you have not read my book and you probably won't well I just had another preacher say this weekend bless his heart he might be listening but he said well your book's too long I don't have time to read it now to me when I will I'll listen to their stuff I'll study their stuff when they won't study mine that shows me they're really not interested in the truth if you really cared about my soul you try to correct me because that's what love does love is corrective the church said amen not one of them sister be I've offered the famous guys that left the message I've offered the non famous guys not a one of them will even open up my book to see what's inside of it because they're scared of it and these people that watch my videos I just enough these people watch my videos and they send Clips to these people that left the message and say oh this pastor doesn't know what he's talking about what that's because they take me out of context if they would take all the Bible verses I preach if they would take all the Bible verses and quotes and put them together they would know and they would see they're probably going to use this clip sometime they would see that they're wrong they're off the word and brother Ram was a genuine prophet of God I've got over 900 pages on it my two books when are they going to really honestly read research these things I'll be waiting in my inbox to get an email from them amen but I got a strange feeling girls they're not going to email me about it they're just going to make videos about me and make fun of me do whatever you want I'd Rather Have Jesus amen am I know what I believe Glory I've got scriptures to back up with I believe they say brother R never preached a Doctrine he only taught you know his stories what a bunch of nonsense right how about this one is he using stories here to try to get you to understand you're the bride of Christ he's using Bible verses amen he's using Micah 7:19 he's using Ephesians 5:24 he's using Romans 51 he's using Romans 7:3 church and if you believe that word then you are the Bride of Jesus Christ amen because that's what the bride does she believes all the word she's washing all the word of God your smile proves you're washing the word brother your love to say Amen proves you're washing the word of God am Hallelujah your first husband that you're married to the world the anointed badroom which for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the word by the church no this church can't wash you right I can't wash you only Christ can wash you we're not washed by the church now you get you get some good baths here when the Holy Ghost is here but there's no man or preacher or song leader nobody can wash you except Christ amen amen that do sound right does it you're Washed by the Water of the church that don't sound right you might find that in the almanac but that's not in God's Bible by the washing of the water of the word in the word you're standing completely Justified that means righteous as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now he said you're standing if you're standing on God's word how many standing on God words every amen jot title where you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from those Shucks and see these people that leave the message where they go to the Shucks that's where they go they don't believe the word
