[2:47] slides
[2:48] here and we'll try to present uh the
[2:52] beginning of the the book here by God's
[2:54] grace
[3:00] did everybody see the self-driving cars
[3:01] yet did everybody see that this week
[3:03] okay virtue saw it good virtue
[3:07] Hallelujah yeah I watched another video
[3:08] on yesterday I went to elon's uh X
[3:11] website and saw some videos and pretty
[3:13] amazing uh but uh yeah he said end of
[3:18] 2026 early 2027 but usually they're a
[3:20] couple years off so uh we'll see how the
[3:23] Lord leads uh but really inspiring so
[3:26] we're looking at uh the first uh
[3:28] Corinthians here part one you read our
[3:30] text and remember my purpose in doing
[3:32] this is Brother BR went beyond the
[3:34] curtain of time and uh the voice said
[3:38] Jesus will come someday and he'll come
[3:39] to you first and you'll be
[3:41] judged remember the Bible said judgment
[3:44] begins at the house of God hallelujah
[3:46] these are people are your converts that
[3:48] you've LED I said you mean by being a
[3:50] leader he'll judge me yes does every
[3:52] leader have to be judged like that yes I
[3:54] said what about Paul he'll be have to be
[3:56] judged with his well I said if his group
[3:59] goes in so will mine cuz I preach
[4:01] exactly the same word that's it I said
[4:03] where he baptized in jesus' name I did
[4:05] too and millions screamed out all at
[4:07] once were resting on that hallelujah how
[4:10] many resting on the same word hallelujah
[4:12] amen I love I love we can read you know
[4:14] Acts 19 and Paul baptized him in the
[4:15] name of the Lord Jesus Hallelujah and
[4:18] Paul said you'll be uh he'll be judged
[4:19] by Christ we'll all be judged by the
[4:21] word that he gave him and I thought my
[4:24] if I'd only knew this before I come here
[4:26] I would make I would make people come
[4:27] here they can't afford to miss this why
[4:29] look at here
[4:31] and the Bible said in that day God shall
[4:32] judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ
[4:35] according to Paul's gospel
[4:38] Hallelujah uh so resting on Paul's
[4:40] gospel we need to know what he said in
[4:41] all his letters for he wrote the whole
[4:43] counsel of God and brother Ram told us
[4:45] and souls that are in prison that's got
[4:47] to come for it's thus sayith the Lord
[4:49] Malachi the 4th chapter just before the
[4:52] coming of the great and terrible day of
[4:54] the Lord I'll send you Elijah kind of
[4:55] backgrounding here what will he do turn
[4:57] the hearts of the children back to the
[4:59] doctrine of the fathers back to the
[5:01] Bible out of these denominational
[5:02] difference and come back to the Bible
[5:04] back to God that's what he would do
[5:06] notice what a great time we're living
[5:07] how many living in a great time
[5:08] Hallelujah remember Church brother Ram
[5:10] preached entire books of the Bible and
[5:13] he probably he would have done it a lot
[5:14] more if he would have been a pastor his
[5:16] entire Ministry but of course he was a
[5:17] prophet the holy spirit said do the work
[5:19] of an evangelist and he was a pastor of
[5:21] course for a short period of time uh by
[5:23] God's grace but he preached the entire
[5:25] Book of Job he said the book of Hebrews
[5:27] and the Book of Revelation right so here
[5:30] in 1955 he said uh he preached about a
[5:33] year and a half to get through the Book
[5:34] of Job and he had job on the ash Heap
[5:37] for six or eight weeks I've never done
[5:40] that to you right I've never uh stayed
[5:43] on one verse for eight weeks have I one
[5:45] verse said six or eight weeks now he's
[5:47] probably exaggerating he often would
[5:48] admit he exaggerated but he spent a lot
[5:51] of time just on being on ash Heep
[5:54] Hallelujah and then the woman would ask
[5:55] brother when are you ever going to get
[5:56] Joba off the ash Heep right so so
[5:59] sisters will come up dear brother
[6:01] brandom when you ever going to preach
[6:03] something different now thankfully no
[6:05] one's ever done that to me I try to move
[6:08] on from one thing to the other right I
[6:09] try to I try to keep moving with fresh
[6:11] thoughts but it was ordained and brother
[6:12] R had a good uh he had a good repentance
[6:14] and altar call when he finally got job
[6:16] off the ash sheep but anyways look at
[6:18] that a year and a half right a year and
[6:20] a
[6:21] half and then from August uh to
[6:24] September 57 he preached 10 sermons on
[6:26] Hebrews 1-7 he never finished that uh
[6:28] but he talked about it here and then uh
[6:32] he said um he said we used to have great
[6:34] classes we'd run them maybe a series of
[6:36] subjects for a complete year start in
[6:37] the book of Genesis and tie the Bible
[6:40] together start in the book of Exodus run
[6:41] it Daniel and maybe the Book of
[6:43] Revelation just take the entire book
[6:45] from place to
[6:47] place okay so brother Braham had a
[6:49] desire to do this he said at the
[6:50] Tabernacle he would do that when he was
[6:52] a pastor before 47 when he he left the
[6:54] Tabernacle and went to take his gift to
[6:56] all the nations Hallelujah then in 195 6
[6:59] he said uh The Book of Revelations he
[7:02] said I taken once almost a year and a
[7:04] half to go through it slowly each night
[7:07] teaching on just the Book of Revelation
[7:09] and comparing it with the rest of the
[7:10] Bible and the ages and so forth that
[7:12] have been passed on so I hope I hope uh
[7:15] if you would have lived in brother Ram's
[7:16] time you would enjoyed a year and a half
[7:18] on the Book of Revelations Hallelujah
[7:20] would you enjoyed the Book of Job for a
[7:21] year and a half Hallelujah a whole year
[7:23] and a half really yeah you could
[7:25] definitely do it by God's grace and so
[7:27] you know through that inspiration of
[7:28] course me just w
[7:30] I I wanted to preach what Paul preached
[7:32] right because that's what we're resting
[7:33] on so so me doing that I preach through
[7:35] these in yellow and so I'm going to
[7:37] start this one now and hopefully you
[7:39] know just hopefully I'll maybe just go
[7:41] straight down here now I felt really
[7:42] compelled to go up to Romans after
[7:44] Colossians and I think God Vindicated
[7:46] that that was a great blessing going
[7:47] through that
[7:48] series um and I started back in 2016
[7:51] looking at uh Galatians I only preached
[7:53] five parts on that then 24 on Ephesians
[7:56] 17 on Philippians 10 on Colossians and
[7:59] 30 one on
[8:00] Romans just you know how longwinded
[8:02] preachers are you know they just keep
[8:03] going longer and longer all the time now
[8:06] on the timeline of Paul's Ministry now
[8:08] in Corinthians it says around 54 to 57
[8:13] ad so about 10 years before Paul passed
[8:16] away uh while he was in Ephesus he had a
[8:19] three-year stay in Ephesus that's the
[8:21] longest we know that he ever stayed
[8:22] somewhere and he said I taught you the
[8:24] whole counsil of God in three years but
[8:26] it was during that time he probably
[8:28] wrote to the city of Corinth um just so
[8:31] you have a kind of an idea that was his
[8:33] third missionary journey okay now some
[8:35] some people like as I showed you before
[8:37] there's different timelines we don't
[8:39] have like a certain date on a letter you
[8:41] know Paul wrote this we don't even have
[8:42] any dates so uh they're just doing their
[8:44] best you know here here again they say
[8:46] about about the same timeline 56 55 54
[8:49] you know Paul wrote Corinthians from
[8:51] Ephesus so a lot of scholars believe on
[8:53] this just so you have an idea of uh when
[8:56] he wrote his books you know the scholars
[8:58] believe he wrote Galatians first ver and
[8:59] then Thessalonians Corinthians this
[9:02] would have been his you know third or
[9:03] fourth letter here uh by the grace of
[9:05] God of course we know second Timothy was
[9:06] his last letter now uh the city of uh
[9:09] Corinth during Paul's life was quite a
[9:11] place um it was uh I'm just going to
[9:15] read off of some history here it was a
[9:17] significant cultural religious and
[9:19] commercial hub in the Roman Empire now
[9:22] here's Paul's last trip remember to Rome
[9:24] I showed you this when he went to Rome
[9:25] to die well Corinth is right there okay
[9:29] so it's modern day Greece uh I think
[9:31] this is turkey modern day and of course
[9:33] Italy um so Paul of course would have
[9:36] wrote to here now they said he wrote
[9:38] while he was here which would have been
[9:39] a nice short way to a short trip to get
[9:41] the letter there that would have been a
[9:42] short travel right uh in Paul's day but
[9:46] you know it's an important you know it's
[9:47] right by the Sea right Corinth is pretty
[9:49] close to the Sea and so it's a very
[9:51] important uh uh Hub we'd say for the
[9:53] Roman Empire it was a Cosmopolitan City
[9:56] there was a lot of trade that happened
[9:58] in Corinth
[10:00] uh because it was near the water it had
[10:03] uh religious pluralism now I'm reading
[10:05] some big words here from history okay so
[10:07] pluralism means lots of religions okay
[10:10] and it had Pagan worship they had a
[10:11] variety of Gods like
[10:13] Aphrodite Apollo and posidon this is
[10:16] according to historians here and this is
[10:19] apparent because Paul had to deal with
[10:21] all the idol worship and the meats that
[10:22] were sacrifice to Idol he had to tell
[10:24] them you know we're Believers we know
[10:26] you know we know this meat didn't come
[10:27] from an idol he said but don't eat eat
[10:29] it uh if there's a weak Christian around
[10:32] but he says if no one's around he said
[10:33] you can eat it because it's not going to
[10:34] bother you you know it doesn't come from
[10:35] these Gods but it was a something they
[10:37] had to deal with right all the
[10:40] idolatry uh and then Pagan feast and so
[10:43] forth it was a place now here's a really
[10:46] interesting thought a place of moral
[10:48] decadence which means moral uh
[10:50] wickedness it had a reputation for
[10:53] wickedness Indulgence particularly in
[10:55] sexual immorality drunkenness and
[10:57] general excess
[11:00] the word uh there's a Greek
[11:02] word uh it's called Uh coren I can't
[11:06] even pronounce it but it's a it means to
[11:08] act like a Corinthian and it was a slang
[11:10] term meaning to engage in SE sexual
[11:12] morality so they had a certain word that
[11:15] they would use oh you're acting like a
[11:17] Corinthian kind of like you're a hippie
[11:18] remember the well we weren't alive but
[11:21] uh you know you ever heard about the
[11:22] hippies you know hippies were known to
[11:24] be into drugs right sexual morality so
[11:27] long hair on the guys and uh sex clothes
[11:30] on the girls right so some people say oh
[11:33] the older generation say you're acting
[11:34] like a hippie well that was kind of like
[11:36] a negative thing to say right it was all
[11:38] evil well that's what this this word
[11:40] Corinthia I'll just say it like that
[11:42] they had a word oh you're just a
[11:44] Corinthian or today you heard me say
[11:46] I'll say like they're just a heathen
[11:48] right like that's kind of what they they
[11:51] the Corinthians were so wicked they had
[11:53] a name about them that was just uh
[11:56] negative this was a very evil place to
[11:59] live live right and we can see this must
[12:01] have been a young church cuz as we read
[12:04] the book they had a lot of trouble right
[12:07] and this slang term was oh you're acting
[12:08] like a gri kind like you're acting like
[12:10] a heathen you're acting like a a a
[12:12] hippie or something like that we know
[12:15] today what's a negative okay what's a
[12:17] more negative word like uh like for uh
[12:21] woke yeah you're acting woke that's evil
[12:24] word that's an evil group uh I'm not
[12:28] sure any other words anybody know any
[12:29] other
[12:31] words sodomite yeah yeah you're act like
[12:34] sodomite very good thank you very good
[12:37] so they had their own slang terms it was
[12:39] seen as a city of loose morals and this
[12:41] is why Paul had to emphasize sexual
[12:43] Purity so many times and live against
[12:46] the
[12:47] culture and then of course it was
[12:49] economic and social stratification just
[12:51] like all the other letters uh right like
[12:53] the Book of James now James was writing
[12:54] to chist or to to to Christian Jews all
[12:58] over turkey and so forth for uh but
[13:00] remember remember in 1 Corinthians 11
[13:02] there were people getting drunk at the
[13:04] Lord's table because they had so much
[13:06] money see church that's why I told you
[13:08] be encouraged nobody got drunk when we
[13:09] were here on
[13:11] Sunday I say we're a mature
[13:13] Church you might might not feel like
[13:15] that but you are if you really look at
[13:18] your life compare it to the book of
[13:20] Corinthians compare it to the Ephesians
[13:22] you're a mature Christian by God's grace
[13:24] now we all want more of God but thank
[13:26] God we don't have drunkards at Communion
[13:30] as far as I know I'm going to get to
[13:31] this a little later far as I know in our
[13:32] church we've never had any sex sexual
[13:33] immorality as far as I know God has been
[13:36] gracious to
[13:37] us a lot of mess churches have we
[13:41] haven't I consider that God's grace on
[13:44] our
[13:45] lives
[13:47] Hallelujah and the remember the
[13:49] wealthier members of the church were uh
[13:51] they wouldn't let the poor eat or eat
[13:54] when they had their communion Feast on
[13:56] the night they'd take communion they
[13:58] would say oh no you're not rich enough
[14:00] uh Haven you're not rich enough you you
[14:01] can't eat with us think about that they
[14:03] outside the church they' have all this
[14:05] food and they would keep people out no
[14:07] you're not rich enough you're you're not
[14:08] good enough to be uh to come eat with us
[14:10] before communion time church we have
[14:13] such a loving Church Hallelujah we have
[14:16] we have such loving hearts here right
[14:19] when when did you ever see me forbid
[14:20] anybody to take
[14:22] communion brother emailed me about that
[14:24] last week communion brother R said Is An
[14:26] Open communion he said anyone who's
[14:28] confessing faith in Christ can have
[14:30] communion that's what he said Hallelujah
[14:34] and yet some people will they'll go to
[14:35] some extremes and oh no unless you've
[14:37] been baptized the Lord Jesus Christ
[14:39] which that's the way to be baptized but
[14:41] they'll in other words they'll keep
[14:41] denominational people out I have a quote
[14:43] brother R says let the Baptist take it
[14:45] let the Presbyterian let the Lutheran if
[14:46] you want the quote see me after service
[14:48] I'll get it for you because I emailed it
[14:49] to the brother brother baham said we
[14:52] don't he said there's one place where we
[14:53] all have something in common that's at
[14:55] the cross of Jesus
[14:56] hallelujah amen and and then there was a
[14:59] lot of philosophy uh because of the
[15:01] wealthy people and because uh it was in
[15:03] Greece right you had the leftover wisdom
[15:06] of the stoics and sofism right stoicism
[15:10] and sofism so had all these uh they were
[15:13] all influenced by uh the these eloquent
[15:17] men not like me I'm not eloquent I
[15:19] stutter I spit I forget things I I make
[15:23] a fool of myself every week but these
[15:26] but the Corinthians were used to these
[15:28] great orators the such wonderful
[15:31] speakers and Paul had to battle against
[15:33] that he said it's not with the wisdom of
[15:35] words but it's in the power of the Holy
[15:37] Ghost Amen in other words power of the
[15:39] Holy Ghost not to get drunk power of the
[15:42] Holy Ghost to live sexually pure
[15:44] Hallelujah that's the power of God Amen
[15:47] Hallelujah but this is what they had to
[15:49] deal with and then divisions and
[15:52] factionism right we'll get to that later
[15:54] in uh chapter uh one I believe it is I'm
[15:56] not mistaken they get right into it and
[15:59] then they had they were just overboard
[16:00] on spiritual gifts just overboard on
[16:02] Sensations that's what brother Ram
[16:04] labors the most when he preaches one
[16:05] sermon on the book of Corinthians he
[16:07] preaches one sermon April 14th 57 he
[16:11] preached one sermon on the book of
[16:12] Corinthians of course he mentions it all
[16:14] throughout his ministry but that was the
[16:16] point he was making he said so many
[16:18] people are so focused on a sensation or
[16:20] a feeling that they're missing the real
[16:23] he calls it the anchor of the
[16:26] Gospel I'll let you guess what the
[16:28] anchor of the gospel is for a few
[16:29] minutes then I'll show I'll share it
[16:31] with you and I'll give you a clue it's
[16:33] in 1 Corinthians
[16:34] 13 anybody know the anchor now children
[16:37] what's the
[16:38] anchor Jesus but what about Jesus 1
[16:41] Corinthians
[16:43] 13 it's the chapter
[16:45] about keep think okay keep thinking hold
[16:48] it right there then then you'll you'll
[16:49] get at the end yeah look it up in your
[16:51] Bible do some work there yeah he spent
[16:54] some time on uh
[16:57] gifts and and so we here we have a we
[17:00] have a good kind of background into the
[17:02] The church here now this is of course
[17:04] modern map I think it's modern I I typed
[17:06] in map modern so we have turkey we have
[17:08] Greece and then Italy just so you can
[17:10] see and here's of course Israel so
[17:12] remember Paul made that trip but just an
[17:14] idea there's Corinth really small there
[17:16] just to have an idea I I church I don't
[17:19] I don't travel around the world I need
[17:20] to go back and look at maps all the time
[17:21] I can't remember where places are I just
[17:24] I can't I can't do it I'm not a world
[17:26] Traveler
[17:28] now brother R preached only one sermon
[17:30] on the book of Corinthians he called a
[17:32] Sunday school he was actually he
[17:34] actually said I'm going to preach 15
[17:35] minutes guess how many minutes he
[17:37] preached
[17:39] 69 he said sorry I just went a little
[17:41] over the minutes uh while the kids were
[17:43] coming out of Sunday school so he was
[17:45] only supposed to preach to Sunday school
[17:47] before brother Neville preached and he
[17:49] said I'll do 15 minutes and he did an
[17:51] hour and 10 minutes but that's our
[17:54] Prophet right there that's my brother
[17:55] right there so if you want to listen to
[17:57] it it's a tremendous message I mean I
[17:59] when I I've listened to it three or four
[18:00] times uh the last few weeks and there's
[18:02] so many good quotes that come out of
[18:04] here so uh it's right before it's right
[18:06] after Easter right and then it was
[18:07] heading into Revival services so he
[18:09] preached this to get them ready for
[18:11] Revival and he says I'm just preaching a
[18:13] Sunday school so if you haven't listened
[18:15] to that you'll be really blessed again
[18:17] it's not too long you I mean you'll be
[18:18] able to remember a lot of it by God's
[18:20] grace okay I forgot to set my Tim but
[18:22] let me do half an hour from here I'm I'm
[18:24] I'm not trying to preach too long Sunday
[18:25] really wore me out I had to song Lead
[18:27] and preach and I was just worn out by
[18:29] the end so uh I'm going to try to get
[18:32] some rest here tonight by God's grace so
[18:34] I love as you know I love CI Scofield's
[18:36] Bible it's been my Bible since 2009 and
[18:39] uh I like his outlines now I read word I
[18:41] reword these a little bit to make them
[18:43] fit on the screen okay so I I just so
[18:45] you know if you go look in your Scopia
[18:47] Bible they'll be slightly reworded but
[18:49] the same divisions I got the same
[18:51] divisions so tonight we're just looking
[18:53] at the the introduction the believer
[18:54] standing in Grace and then uh it goes
[18:57] through the carnal state of the
[18:58] Corinthians then he rebukes immorality
[19:00] especially sexual I should have put
[19:01] sexual immorality um and then he looks
[19:04] at the sanctity of the body the human
[19:06] body and the sanctity of marriage and
[19:08] then he looks at Christian Liberties and
[19:10] looks at headship that's the hair right
[19:12] and the Lord's Supper we preached that
[19:14] on Sunday and spiritual gifts and
[19:17] charity uh then he ends with
[19:20] resurrections he says every man in their
[19:22] own order see God has an order to the
[19:24] resurrections now children what what's
[19:26] the secret what's the anchor love let's
[19:29] all it St together ready love love is
[19:31] the anchor for the Christian it's not
[19:34] the dream it's not a prophecy it's not a
[19:37] feeling it's not a crying it's not tears
[19:38] brother man said it's not shouting or
[19:39] jumping he said love is your
[19:42] anchor Hallelujah now he saids we need
[19:44] all those things he said we we love all
[19:47] those things but your anchor what's
[19:49] going to hold you in your darkest hour
[19:51] knowing the love of God he says the love
[19:53] of Christ brother says that and then he
[19:56] gives closing instructions and greetings
[19:58] in chapter 16 now Scofield's theme
[20:01] instead of typing this out I just I just
[20:03] did a screenshot okay so the writer is
[20:05] the Apostle Paul his relation to the
[20:07] church at cor is set forth in Acts 18 so
[20:10] probably next or Sunday we'll probably
[20:11] preach on that acts 18 to look at the
[20:13] origin of the church it's a supernatural
[20:15] origin uh I always believe our our
[20:18] church started with a supernatural
[20:19] origin too by God's grace I believe that
[20:22] by the grace of
[20:23] God
[20:25] hallelujah uh yeah cuz I mean the the
[20:27] way the way the message got here was
[20:29] Simon up on bookto Avenue uh basically
[20:32] tied me down till I listen to the
[20:33] serpent seat amen so that's how this
[20:35] church started with the Ser sermon
[20:37] serpent seat on bookle Avenue in
[20:40] 2001 uh now the day is around 59 ad it's
[20:44] at the close of Paul's three-year
[20:46] residence in Ephesus the theme is
[20:48] Christian conduct in other words uh
[20:51] Behavior Christian
[20:52] Behavior even the tremendous revelation
[20:54] of the truth concerning Resurrection is
[20:56] made be upon that theme so other words
[20:58] scoffield saying even the idea about
[21:01] resurrections proves we should live holy
[21:04] right now that we know about the
[21:07] resurrections let's make sure our
[21:08] Behavior honors
[21:10] Christ see so no matter how many
[21:12] experiences people have no matter how
[21:14] many miracles you have you got to live
[21:16] right
[21:17] Hallelujah that's right he says the
[21:19] occasion of the epistle was a letter of
[21:22] inquiry from Corinth concerning marriage
[21:24] and the use of meats offered to Idols
[21:27] okay so that was the real reason of it
[21:29] they had questions about marriage and
[21:31] about Meats offered to Idols but the
[21:34] apostle was much more exercised by
[21:36] reports of the deepening divisions and
[21:38] increasing contentions of the church and
[21:40] of a case of incest in which had not
[21:43] been judged that was the man sleeping
[21:44] with his stepmom the factions were not
[21:47] due to heresies but due to the carnality
[21:49] of the Restless Corinthians and to their
[21:51] Greek admiration of wisdom and
[21:53] eloquence the abomination of human
[21:55] leadership in the things of God is here
[21:57] rebuked minor disorders were due to
[22:00] vanity yielding to a childish Delight in
[22:02] tongues and the sign gifts rather than
[22:04] to sober
[22:06] instruction Paul defends his apostleship
[22:08] because it involved the authority of the
[22:10] doctrine revealed through him origin
[22:12] analysis of Corinthians is not possible
[22:14] okay then he just gives the outline
[22:15] that's the outline where I got
[22:17] mine okay now Simon preached months ago
[22:20] it's been a while now um do I have the
[22:23] picture do anybody remember when Simon
[22:26] uh where is it
[22:29] where is it oh there remember when Simon
[22:30] gave a he can kind of gave an
[22:31] illustration like this remember that on
[22:33] his PowerPoint he showed uh there's
[22:35] seven Gentile letters that Paul wrote so
[22:39] Corinth uh Rome Thessalonian colassi
[22:43] Philippi Ephesus and galatia while while
[22:45] he let left that up there I was
[22:47] scratching down this as fast as I could
[22:48] so that's my really fast Chicken Scratch
[22:51] there so because a pent cost and the
[22:54] book of Acts uh it brought seven letters
[22:57] here uh so this kind of inspired me to
[23:00] look at this and then it reminded me
[23:01] that uh these churches battled leav
[23:03] every Church battles leev so that's what
[23:05] I want to look at
[23:06] tonight just a little briefly here the
[23:09] leev of the churches now my reference is
[23:11] Kevin oconor he was a Pentecostal
[23:13] preacher I don't know if he's passed on
[23:14] yet if he's still alive he's very old uh
[23:16] brother Brooks gave me a book years ago
[23:18] when I first started preaching he gave
[23:19] me this book called The Feast of Israel
[23:20] it's a phenomenal book uh and I always
[23:23] thank brother Brooks for giving me that
[23:24] book it really grounded me in a lot of
[23:25] Bible teachings of course brother BR
[23:27] taught all them as well but Kevin oconor
[23:30] was Pentecostal had a lot of agreement
[23:31] with brother brandom now I didn't have
[23:33] time to write all these but I could
[23:35] easily show them to you I'll probably
[23:36] preach a whole sermon on this but the
[23:38] Bible gives lots of different kinds of
[23:39] Leaven now leaven is unconfessed sin
[23:42] that's
[23:43] growing right and Lydia and I were
[23:46] talking and we remember we talked about
[23:48] the story
[23:49] arc uh Lydia said that's Lydia said
[23:52] that's very related to the statement
[23:53] brother Brandon made you can never stay
[23:55] the same you're either rising or falling
[23:57] in your life so I hope today if you felt
[24:00] like you're Fallen I hope this service
[24:01] makes you
[24:02] rise I'm not talking about leev Rising
[24:05] I'm talking about unle Rising by God's
[24:08] grace I'm not even sure if that's
[24:09] possible no it's not okay thank you
[24:12] H always looked at my better half right
[24:14] there for any any
[24:17] wisdom so we got to rise spiritually
[24:19] Hallelujah but Jesus or yeah uh Jesus
[24:22] said Herod had leav and it was
[24:24] worldliness and sensuality remember he
[24:27] obeyed a lot of what John the Baptist
[24:29] said but he had both lives like we
[24:32] looked at on Sunday like remember like
[24:33] those Assyrians on Sunday or the uh uh
[24:36] the Samaritans on Sunday they feared God
[24:38] a little bit but they also worshiped
[24:40] their Idols that's what Herod did Herod
[24:43] honored John the Baptist right he even
[24:45] went to hear him preach but then he also
[24:47] liked dancing
[24:49] girls right he liked dancing young girls
[24:53] but yet he honored the prophet of God
[24:56] see that's 11 that was confess sin in
[24:59] his life and what it lead to he stopped
[25:00] hearing the prophet's voice right and if
[25:03] people don't cut off their sexual sin
[25:05] it's going to help it's going to make
[25:06] them stop listening to brother random
[25:08] right or the fivefold ministry
[25:10] today all right uh next Jesus talked
[25:13] about the leav of the Pharisees and the
[25:15] Sadducees the leev of the Sadducees
[25:17] Jesus said was false Doctrine the leev
[25:20] of the Pharisees was
[25:22] hypocrisy so saying something you do but
[25:25] you don't do it right I think this one
[25:28] is probably something we battle as just
[25:30] all of us as Believers right we all
[25:32] brother R said because we know the
[25:33] message we have way more responsibility
[25:35] but we always don't live up to our
[25:37] responsibilities and brother brand will
[25:39] say we're a million miles below our
[25:40] privileges but church not always are we
[25:42] a million miles below our P
[25:44] privileges right but sometimes we are
[25:47] because we're struggling we got some l
[25:49] in our lives all it takes is a little
[25:51] prayer meeting amen that's all it takes
[25:53] Hallelujah and we can get back to our
[25:55] privileges Hallelujah I believe it with
[25:57] all my heart amen hallelujah it takes
[26:01] the repentance and the spirit of God and
[26:04] so that's 11 the Jesus says that plainly
[26:07] hypocrisy is leaven now the leaven in
[26:10] Corinth was probably sexual morality we
[26:12] see that in chapter 5 but also carnality
[26:15] just carnal you know they wanted to feel
[26:18] something they wanted to speak in
[26:19] tongues so much and prophesy so much uh
[26:22] where Paul had to limitate just three
[26:25] guys just
[26:26] three so how many were going on you know
[26:29] and how many of them were just general
[26:31] oh the Lord's coming soon well we all
[26:32] believe the Lord's coming soon but said
[26:35] we all know he's coming soon we don't
[26:36] need a prophecy to tell us that right a
[26:38] I'm talking about a general
[26:42] prophecy now we preached through gal
[26:44] their Le their legalism was their Leon
[26:48] remember they were trying to bring back
[26:49] in you got to be circumcised to be saved
[26:51] and Paul said how who has Bewitched you
[26:55] you started in the spirit and now you're
[26:56] going back to the law
[26:58] who's Bewitched you he said we need to
[27:00] have another prayer meeting to make sure
[27:02] you're born again hallelujah amen now
[27:05] Ephesus didn't seem to have any problems
[27:08] but Paul told him you know walk in the
[27:09] spirit in chapter four uh neither get
[27:12] place to the devil he helped him on
[27:14] marriage you know in chapter 5 but he
[27:16] doesn't really ball anything
[27:17] specifically out colassi they battle
[27:20] mysticism in Chapter 2 he said don't
[27:21] give into Angel worship remember that
[27:24] and he said don't give into will worship
[27:26] so worshiping according to your will
[27:28] instead of God's will so those are
[27:30] things the Colossians battled in
[27:33] Philippi they battled division remember
[27:35] Paul called out two women remember Paul
[27:36] called them out two women in the last
[27:38] chapter he called them out for all their
[27:41] division all their arguing and fighting
[27:43] Paul had to call them
[27:44] out high-tempered
[27:46] women right I'm sure Corinth had a lot
[27:49] of high-tempered men for
[27:53] sure but remember they also battled
[27:55] anxiety in Philippians so he said I've
[27:58] learned no matter what state I'm in to
[28:00] be content he had to share that with him
[28:03] remember they were a poor church he
[28:05] talked about it later in second
[28:06] Corinthians that the Philippians sent
[28:08] relief to Paul when other churches
[28:09] didn't and yet they were a poor church
[28:12] so they battled sometimes do we have
[28:14] enough can we trust God oh we're going
[28:16] through fearful times and the church
[28:18] said we're going through strange times
[28:20] and the church said just strange
[28:24] times but they uh they were helped by
[28:27] Paul's letter
[28:28] now Thessalonians were really something
[28:31] they battled laziness Paul said they
[28:33] were busy bodies going from house to
[28:35] house and that's where he said if you
[28:36] don't work you shouldn't eat remember
[28:39] that if you don't provide for your own
[28:41] you're worse than an Infidel you didn't
[28:44] have that in other churches right that
[28:46] was kind of there in thessalonica and
[28:48] then he said they gossiped so uh he had
[28:51] to kind of rebuke him on that he said
[28:53] going from house to house and everything
[28:54] like
[28:55] that all right now I'm going to share a
[28:58] little bit about this I was hoping my
[28:59] wife would be in here good timing Darter
[29:02] um you I'm not going to say the name but
[29:05] I just I'll share you know because I was
[29:07] a deacon at the first message church
[29:08] that I was in I was a preacher for a few
[29:09] years and I sat on many of meetings you
[29:12] know dealing with people I should say
[29:13] many but few said maybe five or 10 not
[29:15] many but and so I knew about some of the
[29:18] Le in in in the church that I was in as
[29:21] a as a as a message preacher in in the
[29:24] first church I was in greed was an issue
[29:27] so so uh the pastor wasn't getting all
[29:29] the ties because of the leadership the
[29:31] leadership was keeping some of the money
[29:33] back and that made it harder on the
[29:35] pastor now I wasn't I wasn't the pastor
[29:37] there but most of you know who the
[29:38] pastor was um but I knew about that and
[29:41] there's nothing I could do because
[29:43] really in the side of the state the
[29:44] trustees are the leaders so the trustees
[29:47] controlled it the trustees were breaking
[29:49] the word of God Pastor should get all
[29:51] the ties unless he elects not to like
[29:55] I'm not going to name names but we know
[29:57] we've had pastors preach for us and
[29:58] their ties are so big they don't want to
[30:00] pay taxes on all those so they just get
[30:02] a small portion of
[30:03] those okay I'm not going to call names
[30:06] but this brother says he likes to listen
[30:07] to my sermons after he preaches on
[30:09] Wednesday night so if that pastor's
[30:11] listen send me a text brother love you
[30:13] brother he's a good man he's oh he's one
[30:15] of the finest one of the finest guys in
[30:17] SHO leather you probably know who I'm
[30:18] talking
[30:19] about also uh I sat in numerous meetings
[30:22] about this worldliness was a big part of
[30:25] the home church people were having TVs
[30:28] now everybody's almost got a TV but is
[30:31] it a problem that's the
[30:34] question mine's not Hallelujah I honor
[30:37] God by God's grace am I perfect no
[30:39] nobody is right but it doesn't hurt my
[30:41] walk with God
[30:43] hallelujah uh there was people watching
[30:45] movies especially the young people were
[30:47] watching movies they were sneaking over
[30:49] to other people's houses staying
[30:50] overnight watching movies while the
[30:53] parents were away some of the parents
[30:55] even let their oh I I should have put
[30:57] dating in here
[30:59] yeah some of the message children were
[31:00] let their children doing
[31:04] dating and laying down and sleeping on
[31:07] couches dating that's fornication as far
[31:10] as I'm
[31:12] concerned I couldn't believe it and I
[31:14] was like remember I told you I thought I
[31:16] was amongst
[31:17] Angels like what I I had really fiery
[31:21] Zeal brother Austin kind of not as much
[31:22] as I do now I had a lot more Zeal back
[31:24] then so I was really stirred up you know
[31:26] I was I'd preach pretty hard I'd preach
[31:29] till I couldn't
[31:30] talk I'd clap till I'd bleed on my
[31:33] hands but you know over time God kind of
[31:35] tones you down a little bit and a little
[31:37] more
[31:39] patient more
[31:41] kind um and you know I was in meetings
[31:43] where the pastor would ask us to preach
[31:45] against well not preach against but tell
[31:47] the sisters please don't wear the high
[31:49] heels please don't wear the tight
[31:51] dresses I had to preach on that a couple
[31:53] of times but normally it was another
[31:55] preacher who was well reses in the
[31:57] church I was just a young preacher you
[31:58] know I didn't have as much respect as
[32:00] the other
[32:01] brothers um and of course dating yes and
[32:04] then there was competition now this was
[32:05] shared with me afterwards now this has
[32:07] all been made right so th it was it I
[32:10] was amongst the ministry there but I was
[32:11] only there on Sunday because I liveed
[32:13] three hours away you know I'd only come
[32:14] on Sunday but I wasn't there on
[32:16] Wednesdays but Wednesdays there was
[32:18] competition you know amongst some other
[32:19] other
[32:21] preachers uh they would try to and and
[32:23] this is something they've confessed to
[32:25] me and they've they've forgiven each
[32:27] other and it's all made right again so
[32:28] that's why I know I can share this but
[32:30] they would try to preach deeper messages
[32:32] than the
[32:33] other and uh and was kind of like a
[32:36] competition but God has straightened
[32:39] that out and now all is well by God's
[32:42] grace right and so there was competition
[32:45] well um I got more amens than you
[32:48] did or how about this one I got more
[32:50] people at the altar than you
[32:53] did in a message
[32:56] church now remember other message
[32:58] churches in Corinthians had sleeping
[33:00] around they' argue well I go I go I went
[33:03] to Apollo's church now I got baptized by
[33:06] Peter I got baptized by Paul I got
[33:08] baptized by brother
[33:09] bradam and Paul's like what does that
[33:12] matter he said men are we're all just
[33:15] the same it's God who gives the increase
[33:17] amen Paul's like I'm glad I only
[33:18] baptized one of you like one of your
[33:19] families because you would have said I
[33:21] baptized you in my name these I mean
[33:24] what what I'm saying is message people
[33:25] can be carnal and the church said amen
[33:29] but see if we're born again we should be
[33:31] more mature praise God which I believe
[33:33] we are Hallelujah I hope this is an
[33:35] encouraging message here tonight
[33:36] am right because I I've tried to tell
[33:39] you for years I believe we're a mature
[33:40] Church yes we want more signs Miracles
[33:43] and wonders who does it praise God but
[33:45] we can't tell God God uh now it's time
[33:47] to do some Miracles God I'm going to
[33:48] take you out of my pocket now you need
[33:49] to do
[33:51] something no I'm I'm God's pen right
[33:54] God's going to take me out when he wants
[33:55] to use me praise God Hallelujah like
[33:59] brother R said dream me a dream brother
[34:00] Austin write me a song brother Austin
[34:02] now write me a song now he's not going
[34:04] to be able to do it right you know
[34:07] neither could I when I give a testimony
[34:10] cast out a devil brother Jesse I can't
[34:11] until somebody comes in here who has a
[34:12] devil who wants to be free from
[34:15] it because each time church when I've
[34:17] done it I've had to ask them do you want
[34:18] to be free and some of them some of them
[34:20] were just staring straight ahead and
[34:21] said yes I want to be free and that's
[34:23] when I plead the blood over this
[34:25] daughter usually it's a daughter but it
[34:26] was a Man Too this daughter of God lord
[34:29] uh your blood covers this she wants to
[34:31] be free let I I I said Satan I come
[34:34] against you with the blood of Jesus
[34:35] Christ that's when she go to fighting
[34:36] and screaming or something like that one
[34:38] time she bit my AR one of the woman bit
[34:40] my arm but didn't draw blood by God's
[34:43] grace so uh you know every church has
[34:48] leav so you know we've had leev at bride
[34:50] of ch's Fellowship right over the years
[34:53] so here's some examples you know brother
[34:55] uh just recently brother Griffin said he
[34:58] felt some uh he said he felt the Lord
[35:00] told him some of us had left our first
[35:02] love that's
[35:04] Le right and remember what is the first
[35:06] love it's a fervent desire to please him
[35:10] it's a passion to know his word and a
[35:12] reaching out in the
[35:14] spirit so at some point I mean lots of
[35:17] people were up here but you know could
[35:19] have been something else might not have
[35:20] been something like that but he said
[35:22] felt like the Lord told him to say that
[35:24] when he was out in the woods one day
[35:26] Hallelujah brother McBride come in here
[35:29] fasted and prayed all weekend and said
[35:31] he felt led to preach on the spirit of a
[35:32] tail
[35:33] Bearer gossip and slander now this is
[35:36] kind of like Corinth right the spirit of
[35:39] resentment jealousy and self-recognition
[35:41] that's what brother McBride said I went
[35:44] back and listened to it over the last
[35:45] few months I've listened to him again
[35:47] again and brother bod in the evening
[35:48] service remember the morning he preached
[35:50] that good Hebrews message remember that
[35:51] that was all that was glorious son I was
[35:53] I was in Heavenly places I'm I'm eating
[35:55] at the king's table I told him that too
[35:58] and I told you this I said I always told
[36:01] brother Ben I told him this I said
[36:02] brother you're one of my favorite
[36:03] preachers I said but don't let it go to
[36:04] your
[36:05] head I just told him that and I won't
[36:09] tell that to brother McBride because I I
[36:10] kind of slipped and told Brother B I
[36:12] didn't mean to so I had to say brother
[36:13] don't take don't let it go to your head
[36:15] you know because they're just so humble
[36:17] they just yield to the Holy Spirit and
[36:19] so many times over the years B the rod
[36:21] and God has us use each one of these men
[36:22] just to discern situations in my life
[36:25] and other people's lives it's been so
[36:26] wonderful see it but in the evening he
[36:29] preached staying in your position in the
[36:31] body of Christ right staying in your
[36:33] position he felt led and so with my
[36:36] observations and like I I shared a few
[36:38] weeks ago you know over these years 18
[36:39] years as a pastor the main Spirits I
[36:42] battled is carnality and critical
[36:43] Spirits that's what I battled like
[36:45] people that have left or accused me of
[36:47] things uh that's what I felt like but
[36:50] like I said we're not battling sexual
[36:52] sin thank God for that now let's keep it
[36:54] that way and the church said amen let's
[36:56] keep it that way you're body is the
[36:58] Temple of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[37:00] especially you young ladies and young
[37:01] men coming up your body is the Temple of
[37:04] Jesus Christ Hallelujah you keep it pure
[37:06] amen Jesus died to purchase that Temple
[37:09] amen it's not your body it's God's body
[37:11] Hallelujah keep it pure by God's grace
[37:15] Hallelujah you know and a few years ago
[37:17] I had a a preacher who left now even
[37:19] when he was here I invited him to preach
[37:21] he turned it down and uh after I
[37:24] preached that interracial me message
[37:26] interracial sermon message back in 2015
[37:29] he's like oh you're going to turn into a
[37:30] believe the sign person and I said no
[37:33] I'm not I said I just believe all the
[37:35] all I just balanced these quotes from
[37:37] brother brandom out and I said you're
[37:39] the and he wouldn't even come talk to me
[37:40] face to face after after all we did for
[37:42] him and all these things wouldn't even
[37:44] say come say goodbye to my
[37:46] face it just and then he went and
[37:49] repeated that with o numerous other
[37:51] churches the same disrespect so I saw
[37:54] it's a pattern of disrespect it's an
[37:56] evil spirit
[37:58] I I I got quotes and I still stand here
[38:00] I stand to be corrected I'm waiting for
[38:02] somebody to correct me Hallelujah
[38:04] because it's God's revelation Hallelujah
[38:05] God always had interracial marriages
[38:07] down through the Bible when God ordains
[38:09] it it's led by God then God's pleased
[38:11] with it
[38:12] Hallelujah people just don't understand
[38:14] they just don't understand things and
[38:16] then of course you know I've been
[38:17] accused on things like with how I handle
[38:19] the finances and things like that you
[38:21] know it's a good thing brother brandom
[38:23] and the Bible say the pastor is the
[38:25] highest Authority in the local church
[38:28] it's a good thing
[38:30] Hallelujah because the pastor labors the
[38:33] most with the people stays with the
[38:35] people the preacher get the the
[38:37] Evangelist gets to
[38:39] leave I get when I when I get invited I
[38:41] get to go in there they haven't heard me
[38:43] preach for years and man I preach the
[38:45] house down because they're excited to
[38:48] see me they haven't heard me for a while
[38:49] they're under
[38:53] expectation there's a reason brother man
[38:55] and the Bible say the pastor has he said
[38:58] supreme authority in the local
[39:00] church you need two or three witnesses
[39:03] that will publicly say the pastor sin
[39:05] brother BR said it's like brother
[39:07] Neville he said if you want to get
[39:08] brother Neville out you need two or
[39:09] three Witnesses saying I saw him getting
[39:10] drunk in public and you got to have
[39:13] proof you have to have more proof than
[39:15] what you'd have at the at the actual
[39:17] courtroom in a civil case to remove a
[39:20] real pastor of God hallelujah that's how
[39:23] serious it is and people have criticized
[39:26] me about things like that and don't and
[39:28] then now like I told you one time and
[39:30] then later once somebody left they got
[39:32] they went to another Pastor said the
[39:33] same thing to the pastor and then that
[39:34] person came back and apologized to
[39:38] me because they didn't know they hadn't
[39:40] been the message very long and didn't
[39:41] know and yet they criticize me right so
[39:44] see uh it's just this critical spirit so
[39:47] you know we don't battle drunkenness
[39:48] thank God I've never seen any of you
[39:49] drunk only in the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[39:51] by God's grace let's keep it that way
[39:54] Hallelujah
[39:56] right but think about all the things we
[39:58] could battle but we got to battle
[40:00] something I got to battle something
[40:02] Hallelujah you got to battle something
[40:04] amen but no matter what we battle we're
[40:07] more than conquerors in Christ Jesus
[40:09] Hallelujah I'm going to only be 10
[40:11] minutes longer can you believe that
[40:13] okay now what's the solution to 11 well
[40:16] we know the purging now let's go to 1
[40:18] Corinthians 5 I'm not even going to
[40:19] start chapter 1 because I wanted to do
[40:21] this background kind of what I felt led
[40:23] to preach
[40:24] on 1 Corinthians chapter 5
[40:29] uh verse 7 1 Corinthians 5:7 I don't
[40:33] have it up here so I'm sorry you just
[40:34] got to read out your Bible be good to
[40:35] you turn the Bible I love you know I
[40:37] love preaching these uh out of these
[40:39] Bible sermons here these books because
[40:42] it applies directly to our church we can
[40:44] look at our church I love it it's like a
[40:45] mirror right we can like the Bible said
[40:48] look in the mirror of the word and see
[40:49] where do I fit in here how is this like
[40:51] my life how many like that by God's
[40:53] grace I love that I love seeing wow
[40:55] Corinthians struggle with this but we
[40:57] don't struggle with
[40:58] that or wow uh well they did have some
[41:01] divisions they did have some carnality
[41:02] well we battle with that sometimes I
[41:04] mean we're all human right I love it I
[41:07] love it it's like looking into the
[41:08] mirror and I see oh yeah I see myself in
[41:11] God's word I'm a Child of God we are
[41:13] real church we are a book of Acts Church
[41:15] Hallelujah there's a latter of rain to
[41:17] come but thank God for the rain we've
[41:19] received Hallelujah and church I say
[41:21] this you can always have more rain when
[41:22] you want more
[41:23] Hallelujah brother B said the the
[41:25] congregation and the pastor we both
[41:27] control the service if people want to
[41:30] hear from God they got to pull on the
[41:31] gift I've got to youi and myself and we
[41:33] can all benefit from the spirit of God
[41:35] hallelujah it it's it's up to you and I
[41:37] we it's both of us we have to work
[41:39] together if we want a refreshing from
[41:41] the times of the Lord hallelujah
[41:43] refreshing from the presence of the Lord
[41:45] hallelujah I'm willing to get in the
[41:47] spirit if you are
[41:49] Hallelujah I know I'm going to pay for
[41:50] it tomorrow though Hallelujah but that's
[41:53] okay with me I'll just suffer with it
[41:55] you know as always verse seven Purge out
[41:57] therefore the old leaven that you may be
[41:59] a new lump as you are unleavened for
[42:01] even Christ Our Passover sacrificed for
[42:03] us so how do we get the leaven back I'm
[42:05] sorry how do we get the leavon out you
[42:06] got to purge it out just like you'd
[42:08] clean out your kitchen right you get all
[42:10] I'm gonna get all the leaven or I'm GNA
[42:11] get out all the a Sourdough I'm goingon
[42:13] to get out whatever it is you know I'm
[42:15] gonna get all that out of out the
[42:16] kitchen you got to just wipe right you
[42:17] got to sit down wipe it get your uh get
[42:19] your cloth wipe it down get it out same
[42:22] thing in the spiritual if we got sin in
[42:24] our life let's take the uh the rag of
[42:26] the Holy spear right and wipe it off the
[42:29] Waters of the spear Wash It Away let's
[42:31] wash it away under the blood of Jesus
[42:33] Christ Hallelujah Purge it out get it
[42:36] out in this case he's talking about get
[42:39] that man who's committing sexual sin
[42:41] don't let him come to
[42:43] church right that's what it's talking
[42:45] about here don't let him come to church
[42:47] give him over to Satan for the
[42:49] destruction of the flesh because he
[42:50] keeps doing sexual sin and he's puff
[42:52] he's proud about it and not and not
[42:54] humiliated by it anyone that's prideful
[42:57] over sexual sin Paul said give them over
[42:59] to
[43:00] Satan now no now Church you know he had
[43:03] to have follow Jesus's three-step
[43:05] Command right so somebody would have
[43:07] went to him said you need to confess
[43:08] your sexual sin no way and then then he
[43:11] would have brought somebody else you
[43:12] need to confess your sexual sin stop it
[43:15] no way right and so this would have been
[43:17] the third step right Paul wouldn't break
[43:19] Jesus's
[43:20] commands Hallelujah so see they went
[43:22] face to face they went one to one and
[43:23] then they went two to one and then they
[43:25] presented the church and and so Paul
[43:27] hears about it he said kick that guy out
[43:29] of the
[43:30] church let the de let him give him over
[43:32] to the devil and watch what the devil
[43:34] will do to somebody you ever seen that
[43:37] watch what the devil would do I tell you
[43:39] there's been I don't know why it is
[43:40] there's so many people at Cam's church
[43:41] and I hope it's okay that I say this
[43:43] there's so many people I and I've been a
[43:45] part of it to help them or baptize them
[43:47] or there's so many people we've seen
[43:48] come in and they've forsaken the message
[43:50] that Cam and Simon were preaching I'm
[43:52] talking about the Bible not just our own
[43:54] human thoughts you we all have our own
[43:55] human opinions on things but the Bible
[43:58] and some of them have gone to jail some
[43:59] of them I mean I mean really they've
[44:01] been giv over to Satan because they have
[44:05] uh I don't even think cam put them out
[44:06] from under the blood but it's they're
[44:09] leaving the protection of God's word
[44:12] giving themselves over into Satan's
[44:14] hands they've left the protection and
[44:17] they've been been snared by
[44:19] Satan and I've seen just awful
[44:22] things but what can you do all you can
[44:24] do is warn them they heard it church as
[44:27] soon as we're here we're responsible for
[44:29] it praise God hallelujah that's why I
[44:31] appreciate our church amen you hear the
[44:33] word of God you obey it Hallelujah might
[44:36] wrestle with it for a few weeks but
[44:37] you're going to get it Hallelujah me too
[44:41] I mean I don't receive everything
[44:42] perfectly all right away you know I'm
[44:44] I'm human too I have a time and season
[44:46] where God gives me victories and
[44:48] overcoming but that's how you purge it
[44:50] out verse eight therefore let us keep
[44:52] the feast not with old leaven neither
[44:53] with a leaven of malice so see when
[44:55] someone comes to church and they've got
[44:57] anger malice against people and
[44:58] wickedness and sin he said that's
[45:02] insincerity that's it that's coming to
[45:04] church insincere when you're upset with
[45:06] someone or you have sinned unconfessed
[45:08] in your life that's not sincere worship
[45:10] and then Jesus can't help you because
[45:12] you got to Worship in spirit and in
[45:15] truth so this guy was coming to church
[45:17] he was insincere he probably walking
[45:19] there he' probably laughing and joking
[45:21] too much uh and everybody knew oh he's
[45:23] been sleeping with he's been sleeping
[45:24] around everybody knew about it and the
[45:26] Bible said the church knew and they
[45:27] didn't mourn about it so people in the
[45:29] church knew this guy was a dirty dude
[45:32] say like that he's a dirt he's a
[45:35] Corinthian Corinthian I I'll just say it
[45:37] like that he was just like the others
[45:39] but he was coming to
[45:40] church all right uh but with the
[45:42] unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
[45:44] so he wasn't sincere in his worship and
[45:46] he wasn't living the truth he was living
[45:49] in sexual
[45:50] morality so see if we want leevan out of
[45:52] our Lives we got to be sincere right we
[45:54] got to be more sincere and we got to
[45:56] obey the truth truth that's why I love
[45:58] what the angel told Brother B you must
[46:00] be more sincere remember to bind the
[46:01] mamba snake he said you got to be more
[46:04] sincere to bind him right more
[46:07] sincere that means no playing around no
[46:09] joking right no no messing around if you
[46:12] will get down to business with God God
[46:14] will get down to business with you
[46:15] Hallelujah and me too that's what I'm
[46:16] talking about each one of us so that's
[46:19] how we get the Le now that's the
[46:20] solution to all of our leaven and I tell
[46:22] you each time I've been attacked you
[46:23] know that's what it goes back to it goes
[46:26] back to that uh you know like even with
[46:28] the brother that the preachers that left
[46:29] and everything like that you know uh it
[46:31] always forces me to pray right and be
[46:33] sincere yes I lose a little bit of
[46:35] Sleepover but what it does it brings
[46:37] back the sincerity
[46:40] right any anyone been through any
[46:43] difficult trials lately what does it do
[46:45] it shakes you up right it makes you get
[46:46] your sincerity back what is that doing
[46:48] it's getting the leav out of your life
[46:50] aren't you glad God gets a Le out of
[46:52] your life aren't you glad God doesn't
[46:54] let us grow into some type of an immoral
[46:56] Church a disgrace did you hear about
[46:58] that message Church what a disgrace and
[47:00] they they just they love it they enjoy
[47:02] oh God help us to love Holiness
[47:04] Hallelujah help us to be the Oddball
[47:06] church or the strict church or whatever
[47:07] whatever people want to say praise God
[47:09] just keep our lives pure keep our lives
[47:11] holy like Jesus is
[47:13] Holy like I told a brother from South
[47:15] Africa a good brother boy I found a real
[47:16] connection with him he he said the Lord
[47:18] told me to email you and ask this
[47:20] question he said and thank you for the
[47:22] answer the question was uh
[47:27] the question was uh people in South
[47:29] Africa were telling him oh you can't
[47:31] send out two by two brother Ram said you
[47:33] only got to go out one at a time and
[47:35] he's like brother Jesse what do you
[47:36] think about that I said I said first of
[47:38] all brother Rams never said thus say the
[47:40] Lord with any of that second of all the
[47:42] Holy Ghost sent Paul and Barnabas two by
[47:45] two and that was after Pentecost
[47:48] Hallelujah that was the church ages and
[47:50] I said either Jesus Christ is the same
[47:52] yesterday today and forever or not and
[47:54] he said he was saying the reason he did
[47:56] that cu because he got more results he
[47:58] got more people saved when he had two
[47:59] people rather than one person so I said
[48:02] brother the proof is in the pudding and
[48:04] then he text me back right away this
[48:05] morning email back and said I know the
[48:07] Lord told me I I knew the Lord told me
[48:08] to email you thank you that Set Me
[48:10] Free and he said what about when you're
[48:12] shun by all the he said all the popular
[48:14] preachers in South America or South
[48:16] Africa I said join the
[48:19] group I said I don't even care what they
[48:22] say now I've been more sympathetic to
[48:23] them I've been watching them as far as
[48:25] the goat preachers I really believe
[48:27] they're born again they just got some
[48:29] pride because if they don't have all the
[48:31] sin the sexual sin like the Corinthian
[48:33] Church if they're not getting drunk at
[48:34] the Lord's table they're probably born
[48:35] again so I've been a little more gentle
[48:37] with them now at first I was like man
[48:40] this is crazy how can they say they're
[48:41] the greatest of all time but God has a
[48:43] way of humbling
[48:45] people we just got to make sure we don't
[48:47] exalt ourselves right we just got to
[48:49] make sure brother Austin I got the moat
[48:50] out of my eye
[48:51] first before I go looking at somebody
[48:53] else's eye so I've been a little more
[48:56] gracious I've been listen of course I
[48:57] listen to all most of their sermons not
[48:58] all but listen to a lot of their
[49:01] sermons so I'm trying to close I told
[49:03] you I'd be closing in a few minutes here
[49:06] Glory so the solution to leaven boils
[49:09] down to charity good job girls had to
[49:13] look that one up that's good you only to
[49:14] look it up one time
[49:15] Hallelujah six times as I've listened to
[49:18] uh brother R numerous times now preached
[49:21] this sermon from 1957 he uses the word
[49:23] anchor so if you listen to it he's all
[49:25] talking about how the the Corinthians
[49:27] love to speak in tongues they love to
[49:28] prophesy uh they love Miracles they
[49:32] loved all these feelings they loveed
[49:33] being associated with this bigname
[49:35] preacher the bigname preacher there they
[49:37] love getting drunk at the Lord's table
[49:39] you know there was all about senses and
[49:40] emotions and feelings and brother Ram
[49:43] says six times he said you got to have
[49:45] an
[49:46] anchor he said a lot of these people
[49:48] weren't anchored that's why they could
[49:49] commit sexual sin that's why they could
[49:51] argue about the greatest
[49:54] preachers right they weren't anchored
[49:56] that's why they could get drunk at the
[49:58] Lord's
[49:59] table right but said he said and we need
[50:03] to learn that we need to Anchor in our
[50:05] lives that's what we need an anchor so
[50:08] when the winds are blowing that's kind
[50:10] been talking about the double-mindedness
[50:11] right when the winds are blowing you can
[50:13] throw an anchor down and said I'm not
[50:14] going to be moved Satan's not going to
[50:16] move me from where I'm standing
[50:17] Hallelujah am I'm going to be solid in
[50:19] the word of God
[50:23] hallelujah so let's read through these
[50:25] quotes and I'll finish up here
[50:28] I thought it might be done by eight but
[50:29] I don't think so now brother R said they
[50:31] depended too much on little Sensations
[50:33] little things like that well praise the
[50:34] Lord I had a revelation come to me I had
[50:36] a Psalm I had a
[50:38] prophecy Paul said all these things will
[50:40] fail see every one of them now look at
[50:42] this quote they're not just to be
[50:44] trusted too
[50:46] much isn't that
[50:48] something you would think if you had a
[50:50] dream or you had a vision or you had a
[50:52] prophecy you think oh I can lay my soul
[50:54] on that well brother says take take some
[50:56] take some advice from the Corinthian
[50:58] Church
[50:59] here just be real careful right like
[51:03] remember I told Austin he got that nice
[51:04] testimony the guy said your voice will
[51:05] go worldwide but remember I said be real
[51:07] careful with
[51:08] that right because you he may find out
[51:11] later something about this guy well he
[51:12] already falsely prophesied there you
[51:14] know you never know I've had different
[51:16] people like even when Brother Ray told
[51:17] me that word of the Lord I had I said
[51:19] okay let me go test it brother I would
[51:21] not have received it unless it passed
[51:23] the
[51:24] test right but even that he says see
[51:29] just don't trust in those too much so we
[51:31] need the gifts we we we love the gifts
[51:34] but don't put too much don't
[51:35] overemphasize the
[51:37] gifts because now he's talking about
[51:39] these Corinthians right Paul said all
[51:42] these will fail see every one of them
[51:44] they're just not to be trusted too much
[51:46] but but what he's trying to get here to
[51:48] the church was that anchor where we have
[51:51] an anchor in Christ and we don't trust
[51:53] upon Sensations we don't trust upon
[51:55] Revelations we don't trust on these
[51:57] things only We Trust Christ it's by
[52:00] faith that we move out
[52:01] there
[52:04] Hallelujah now he's talking about like
[52:06] maybe a false Revelation here right
[52:08] because any Revelation I just preach on
[52:09] Revelations brother Irving just preached
[52:11] on Revelation the Gates of Hell cannot
[52:13] Prevail against a revelation Hallelujah
[52:15] see what we're saying but anything
[52:17] that's questionable like if if it's a
[52:19] questionable Revelation or if it's just
[52:21] a
[52:23] feeling right if it's just you just had
[52:26] a good emot or just had some
[52:29] emotion you can't really fully trust in
[52:32] that uh if it goes against the word of
[52:34] God you don't trust it at all
[52:37] right we notice Paul Could Teach the
[52:40] Ephesians there how before the
[52:41] foundation World they were predestined
[52:43] on the adoption of the sons of God the
[52:45] Corinthians didn't know anything about
[52:46] that now look they didn't know nothing
[52:47] about before the foundation of world all
[52:48] they knew was
[52:49] gifts feelings and preachers and
[52:52] eloquence and drunkenness you know and
[52:55] these are things they knew about they
[52:57] didn't know I was chosen before the
[52:58] foundation world that that means I
[53:00] should live a higher life if God chose
[53:03] me I come from the mind of Christ I
[53:05] better live like
[53:06] Christ they had to have they had to have
[53:09] a little feeling or something a little
[53:11] sensation right one this way other and
[53:13] they depended on that he couldn't teach
[53:15] them the Deep things so I think it's a
[53:17] great thing when you got a people you
[53:18] can teach deep things and brother Jesse
[53:20] said amen hallelujah I've teach I've
[53:22] taught it as deep as I know it
[53:24] Hallelujah and some of you have ask me
[53:27] questions deeper than I
[53:28] know
[53:30] girls Right girls I don't know some of
[53:33] the answers to your deep
[53:34] questions but God knows Hallelujah and
[53:37] the Holy Spirit can wind these truths
[53:39] and anchor in the people's hearts so
[53:41] they know where they're standing where
[53:42] are you standing I'm standing in Christ
[53:45] Hallelujah I'm not standing in myself
[53:47] I'm not standing in my knowledge or my
[53:48] ability to study the Bible I'm standing
[53:50] in the blood of Jesus and the spirit of
[53:52] God hallelujah standing in that I thank
[53:55] God for every blessing every gift every
[53:56] feeling every emotion I thank God for it
[53:58] but my stance is in the word of God my
[54:01] stance is in the Holy Spirit
[54:04] Hallelujah sensation or no sensation
[54:07] prophecy or no prophecy whatever it
[54:09] might be I remember I was discouraged as
[54:11] a young preacher I was out there in the
[54:13] vegetable we're out there in the
[54:14] vegetable at my home church and a sister
[54:16] Karen sister Karen uh Sanders said thus
[54:19] sayi the Lord and would prophesied over
[54:21] young preacher and I was I was honestly
[54:23] sad she prophesied over him and she said
[54:26] thus say the Lord you'll travel to many
[54:27] places to preach this message and I was
[54:30] kind of sad I don't know if I told my
[54:31] wife that but I was like I wish somebody
[54:33] would prophesy about
[54:34] me when am I going to get a
[54:38] prophecy I don't feel bad anymore
[54:40] because that brother done left the
[54:43] message goes to baptist church now and
[54:46] then he didn't even know he texted Simon
[54:48] he didn't even know how to defeat uh the
[54:50] argument tongues are the evidence of the
[54:51] Holy Ghost I'm like he was in a message
[54:54] church for 20 years and he don't know
[54:55] how to defeat that by the Bible
[54:56] that proves he was never into the Bible
[54:59] he was into popularity or money or
[55:00] something else like that but I was
[55:03] always discouraged sister Lena how come
[55:04] I never got a prophecy and brother said
[55:06] prophecy or no prophecy be anchored in
[55:09] Christ hallelujah amen
[55:13] hallelujah God's already given me enough
[55:15] indications well I probably got some
[55:17] indications right after that because
[55:18] remember I prayed and fasted God just
[55:20] speak through me when the first time I
[55:21] preach in Lima God filled the altar
[55:23] twice the first two sermons everyone's
[55:26] at the the altar weeping and crying
[55:27] getting victories so that was God's
[55:28] Vindication to me he's Vindicated of
[55:30] course many other times see but whether
[55:33] you get a feeling or prophecy or
[55:34] whatever it may be you must be anchored
[55:37] the word of God must be anchored in your
[55:40] heart and all these Sensations those
[55:43] Corinthians had not one of them was the
[55:44] evidence they were saved not one of them
[55:46] is the evidence that they were saved not
[55:48] if you could shout not if you could
[55:50] prophesy not if you could heal the sick
[55:51] if you could speak with tongues if you
[55:52] could interpret tongues if you had
[55:54] wisdom if you had knowledge none of
[55:55] those mean you're saved not one of them
[55:58] you could have every one of them Paul
[55:59] said in 1 Corinthians 13 and be lost I'm
[56:01] nothing but when you got love you got
[56:04] the anchor
[56:05] Hallelujah glory to God Amen Hallelujah
[56:08] I love to shout with all them I love to
[56:10] dance with the best of them Hallelujah
[56:11] sometimes I wish I could just do some
[56:13] more dancing sometimes amen girls I'm
[56:15] still waiting on your songs to dance
[56:16] Hallelujah we'll take out this row we'll
[56:18] dance and I like I said I dance almost
[56:20] every every week at bible Club I love to
[56:22] dance and praise God but that doesn't
[56:24] prove I'm saved what proves I'm saved is
[56:26] there's love in my soul Hallelujah
[56:28] that's the only thing and brother labors
[56:31] on this six times you need the every all
[56:33] of us need the anchor of God's love
[56:35] Hallelujah
[56:39] am and years later now he's talking
[56:41] about after his first wife and Sharon
[56:44] Rose died he was so discouraged Mr Eiser
[56:46] walks up the road he knows he's a
[56:47] preacher he says Billy what does Christ
[56:50] mean to you now you've lost your wife
[56:51] and you've lost your
[56:53] daughter what does he mean now what a
[56:58] test what a test you've been to two
[57:00] funerals do you love Christ now or not
[57:03] your sweet beautiful young bride she's
[57:05] in the
[57:06] grave my father was gone my brother was
[57:08] gone my wife was gone my baby was gone I
[57:10] said what does he mean I said Mr Eiser
[57:13] he means more than life to
[57:17] me just freshly left a funeral something
[57:20] has happened within me glory amen glory
[57:23] so no matter what happens outside of you
[57:24] you can overcome it as as long as you've
[57:26] got somebody inside of you
[57:29] Hallelujah
[57:30] Glory no matter what happens on the
[57:32] outside as long as I've got Christ in me
[57:35] he's the hope of Glory
[57:37] Hallelujah he's the hope that I'll go to
[57:39] heaven
[57:42] hallelujah it's just become more than I
[57:44] am myself Glory hallelujah
[57:48] amen we look at ourselves we we have
[57:50] nothing of ourselves anything good that
[57:52] comes out of our Lives must be Jesus
[57:54] hallelujah amen
[57:56] it's just something that happened it
[57:58] wasn't because I was religious it's just
[58:00] something that God through the grace of
[58:02] God did for
[58:04] me and I thought though he would slay me
[58:07] I trust him just the same and I I said
[58:09] this on Sunday remember and if I was in
[58:11] hell and there was such a thing as love
[58:13] in hell I'd still love him how could
[58:17] there be love in hell but he said I
[58:18] don't know he said but if I was there
[58:20] I'd still love Jesus in the
[58:23] Flames that's all it's something in here
[58:25] he's right it's something in here now
[58:28] how how many can I want to hear some
[58:29] amens after this I deserve every
[58:31] punishment that I ever
[58:33] got amen you and I do the same but it's
[58:38] that anchor that something that anchor
[58:40] of love of God that holds in the human
[58:43] heart other things become
[58:46] secondary the love of God is the primary
[58:49] thing in our lives nothing is greater
[58:51] than the love of
[58:54] God right we're going to with that in
[58:56] just a moment but brother it's a lot
[58:58] more than intellectuals remember I was
[59:00] using Claude as my
[59:03] example remember uh brother B said oh he
[59:06] said people would would plead with young
[59:07] people at the altar oh your dad's de
[59:09] dead in Heaven don't you want to be with
[59:10] him you need to get saved and work on
[59:12] their intellects and their emotions to
[59:14] try to get them to get saved brother
[59:16] said you're not getting them saved they
[59:18] have to love Jesus Christ themselves
[59:21] Hallelujah you don't get saved to get
[59:23] something you get saved to get forgiven
[59:25] Hallelujah
[59:28] he said it's a genuine birth not just a
[59:30] mental conception or emotional work but
[59:32] a birth an experience something that
[59:34] goes Plumb down deep into your heart and
[59:36] changes the innermost being that makes
[59:38] you do the things you would not have
[59:40] done in other words it makes you love
[59:42] those who are
[59:44] unlovable it makes you act different
[59:46] than you ever thought you would act and
[59:48] when situations arise it's your anchor
[59:51] you don't have to wonder will I make it
[59:55] oh no it isn't whether I'll make it it's
[59:57] already made for
[59:59] me will I make it but said it's already
[1:00:02] made Hallelujah I love that
[1:00:05] quote Christ in me has made it
[1:00:08] himself so I don't I don't have to make
[1:00:11] it because the Maker's already inside of
[1:00:13] me
[1:00:14] Hallelujah I don't have to make it he
[1:00:17] already made it for
[1:00:18] me and he's inside of me Glory how do I
[1:00:21] know because he's changed me from the
[1:00:22] inside
[1:00:23] out I'm a new person
[1:00:27] oh no he says and I trust in his anchor
[1:00:30] alone what a wonderful thing what a
[1:00:33] wonderful thing not to trust that you
[1:00:34] shouted not to trust that I danced
[1:00:36] around the church or I laid at the altar
[1:00:38] and I cried brother says alligator tears
[1:00:40] in this story like you could just cry
[1:00:42] for 10 days it doesn't matter like
[1:00:44] that's not why we're saved we're saved
[1:00:46] because we've confessed our sins we've
[1:00:48] been baptized and we're trusting in the
[1:00:50] blood of Jesus Christ to forgive our
[1:00:52] sins that's the gospel hallelujah amen
[1:00:55] that's the good news
[1:00:57] and because he loved us we love him in
[1:01:00] return and the love of Christ and I just
[1:01:03] I told the the the uh the the the middle
[1:01:06] schoolers this week Jesus I'm sorry
[1:01:09] Peter on the day of Pentecost said the
[1:01:10] love of God is shed abroad in your
[1:01:12] hearts so when you really get saved
[1:01:14] God's love is poured into your
[1:01:16] heart you just love people hallelujah
[1:01:20] you might struggle sometimes but overall
[1:01:22] you love people they might get on your
[1:01:24] nerves sometimes
[1:01:27] you pray for
[1:01:28] them sometimes they get on all of our
[1:01:30] nerves right we got to pray for them
[1:01:32] we're human we'll still battle those
[1:01:34] effects I'm almost done and at this
[1:01:37] coming revival may we just be so full of
[1:01:39] your charm Lord
[1:01:41] charm anybody ever prayed for charm
[1:01:45] lately oh Lord Make Me A Charming
[1:01:47] preacher that's the wrong
[1:01:50] charm he talk about the charm of Christ
[1:01:53] the car the character the Holiness the
[1:01:55] sweetness is the humility of
[1:01:57] Christ Lord fill me with your charm Lord
[1:02:01] until many will come in and be saved the
[1:02:03] little Community here where we've tried
[1:02:05] so hard the LA the first Revival now in
[1:02:07] 10 years that I've held now I pray that
[1:02:08] you'll give us that real real spirit in
[1:02:10] our hearts and may anchor there for
[1:02:12] eternity we had a good Revival with
[1:02:13] brother McBride right three days in a
[1:02:14] row prayed what we prayed two and a half
[1:02:16] hours 30 minutes a day up to that
[1:02:18] Revival stiring up our hearts Grant it
[1:02:21] Lord make us to examine ourselves we
[1:02:23] married people by the way we treat our
[1:02:27] wives huh so you can you can examine
[1:02:30] Yourself by the way you treat the people
[1:02:31] in your house absolutely that's the best
[1:02:35] examination and the church said
[1:02:38] everybody everybody behind me on that
[1:02:41] one how true we are or how true our
[1:02:44] wives is to us and maybe we just get in
[1:02:46] our hearts this morning how we'd think
[1:02:48] if something like that happened in our
[1:02:49] home and then may we turn our affection
[1:02:52] toward you and say oh God be merciful to
[1:02:54] me now let's stand our feet I'm going to
[1:02:57] close with uh 1 Corinthians
[1:02:59] 13 just such a beautiful chapter Malachi
[1:03:02] can come uh Lydia if you want
[1:03:08] to I will go through Lord willing I will
[1:03:10] preach every one of these words and then
[1:03:13] uh explain
[1:03:14] them because that would be a great
[1:03:16] review for me but let's just read it
[1:03:18] over and ask God to speak to our hearts
[1:03:23] here though I speak with tongues of men
[1:03:25] and of angels and have not charity I'm
[1:03:27] become as a sounding brass or tinkling
[1:03:30] symbol when I was raised I saw growing
[1:03:32] up I saw so many people speak in tongues
[1:03:34] but if they don't have love it was just
[1:03:36] make it was just noise just noise I saw
[1:03:40] so many people speak in
[1:03:42] tongues right and then I question did
[1:03:44] they have the love of
[1:03:46] God but thank thank God I mean I'm
[1:03:48] thankful if it's a real genuine tongue
[1:03:49] thank God for that but you got to have
[1:03:51] love with it and though I have the gift
[1:03:54] of Prophecy and understand all mystery
[1:03:55] now I love that because I believe we
[1:03:57] understand all the Mysteries that are
[1:03:58] called Bible Mysteries and all knowledge
[1:04:00] but even though I have all that I have
[1:04:02] all faith I could move remove mountains
[1:04:05] and have not charity I'm still
[1:04:08] nothing I've had uh you know people
[1:04:10] email me and say wow brother Jesse one
[1:04:12] thing I love about online is you're so
[1:04:14] kind in your comments now not all the
[1:04:16] time sometimes I feel a real rebuke
[1:04:18] Spirit come on me I try to rebuke some
[1:04:20] people sometimes but um but this is
[1:04:24] Sister Sister sent me a voice voice
[1:04:25] message last year and said I know you uh
[1:04:28] you have God in you because you're so
[1:04:30] kind you have love for all these people
[1:04:32] that are unkind to you and I do pray for
[1:04:34] them I don't pray hours for them but I
[1:04:36] you know if they write an evil comment
[1:04:37] I'll just pray right there God help them
[1:04:39] be merciful to them open their hearts so
[1:04:41] they don't go to hell they say such
[1:04:44] awful things they blashe the Holy
[1:04:47] Ghost and though I bestow all my goods
[1:04:50] to feed the poor and though I give my
[1:04:51] body to be burned and have not charity
[1:04:53] it doesn't profit
[1:04:57] anything so Church what is your anchor
[1:04:59] you need to suffer long see why it's so
[1:05:01] important to suffer long church that
[1:05:03] proves you're
[1:05:04] anchored oh God hasn't answered my
[1:05:06] prayer keep suffering that proves you
[1:05:09] got God's
[1:05:10] anchor Hallelujah is that is that what
[1:05:13] the Bible says or no It's Kind even when
[1:05:16] you don't feel like being kind be kind
[1:05:19] because that's the
[1:05:20] anchor charity envies not so don't envy
[1:05:23] people for what they got or or what you
[1:05:25] want be happy for
[1:05:28] them charity vaunteth not itself it's
[1:05:32] not puffed up it doesn't want its own
[1:05:35] way it does not behave itself unseemly
[1:05:39] it doesn't seek its own way it's not
[1:05:42] easily provoked and it doesn't think
[1:05:45] evil we're getting to some real maturity
[1:05:48] right
[1:05:49] here we're getting some real deepness
[1:05:51] right here this is the anchor this Paul
[1:05:54] knew this is what they need needed the
[1:05:55] Holy Ghost directed him to write this
[1:05:57] this is what he
[1:06:05] needed love does not behave okay I
[1:06:07] already read that okay I love this one
[1:06:09] love does not rejoice in iniquity see
[1:06:12] remember remember the workers of
[1:06:13] iniquity they rejoice in iniquity that's
[1:06:15] why they keep doing it but love of God
[1:06:18] does not rejoice in
[1:06:20] iniquity it rejoices in the
[1:06:24] truth and charity can bear all things it
[1:06:28] can put up with people no matter what
[1:06:29] they say it can put up with them and
[1:06:30] still love
[1:06:32] them it can believe all things right it
[1:06:34] can hope all things it can endure all
[1:06:37] things and the church
[1:06:39] said how many feel challenged to show
[1:06:41] some more love out there tonight let's
[1:06:43] bow our heads here just sing that little
[1:06:45] course I love him I love him because he
[1:06:47] first loved
[1:06:49] me I kind of felt inspired here to
[1:06:51] preach this here tonight hope it was a
[1:06:53] blessing by God's grace
[1:06:59] Hallelujah father God we just come to
[1:07:01] you tonight Lord God I preached your
[1:07:02] word Lord God I'm just a vessel I'm just
[1:07:05] a little pen you can take out and use
[1:07:06] whatever you want Lord God I'm
[1:07:10] nothing paos watered Paul planted but
[1:07:13] God gives the increase Lord you're the
[1:07:15] only one who can give an increase
[1:07:16] tonight Lord
[1:07:17] God we thank you Lord for your love and
[1:07:19] your compassion your kindness towards us
