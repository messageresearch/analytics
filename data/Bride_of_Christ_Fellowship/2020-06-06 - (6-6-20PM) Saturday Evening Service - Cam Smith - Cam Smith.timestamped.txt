[35:34] Betsy's been a real saint of God her and
[35:37] Dustin or such pillars and brother cams
[35:40] church there and I just love them so
[35:43] much then look at their wonderful
[35:44] children my goodness love all of you god
[35:47] bless ya like you got two sets you know
[35:49] too old or too young I just want to say
[35:53] a few words before brother cam comes you
[35:54] know not everybody is aware of it
[35:58] brother Brooks is the the pastor that we
[36:02] first sat under so brother
[36:04] called God called us to his church and
[36:07] there was three at least three there's
[36:09] more churches than that in the area but
[36:10] of all the churches God took us to
[36:14] brother Brooks his church and the reason
[36:16] was because they believed in the real
[36:18] Holy Ghost yeah I'm not saying anything
[36:21] against the other churches but you know
[36:22] by their fruits they're known and and we
[36:27] are so grateful brother Brooks he
[36:29] protected us brother Brooks never told
[36:31] us to go to these other you know we
[36:33] didn't need youth meetings all those
[36:35] those gonna be good but we didn't need
[36:36] those because we had the Holy Ghost
[36:37] medium clay and I didn't need it because
[36:43] I got the Holy Ghost you know the day
[36:44] after I was married the day after he
[36:46] married me I got them all to go and
[36:47] there was like four or five people that
[36:49] said they got the Holy Ghost that day
[36:52] and so God chose a special vessel it was
[36:56] brother Brooks to be like our spiritual
[36:59] father and teach us and then I sat under
[37:02] him as a deacon for a year and a half
[37:03] and then we felt led to start this
[37:04] church 14 years ago this weekend brother
[37:06] it was the first weekend in June of 2006
[37:10] brother Brooks oversaw that then he
[37:12] ordained me a pastor here we're just
[37:14] we're just continuing the same gospel
[37:16] brother Brooks preaches this is the same
[37:19] one for the Branham preached yeah amen
[37:22] which is the same one all for age which
[37:24] is the same one Jesus preached a man yes
[37:27] it all goes back to Jesus and we're just
[37:30] a continuation of that and brother
[37:33] Brooks I said as I said he baptized me
[37:34] he married me my wife he yeah he
[37:39] ordained I'm sorry he ordained me he
[37:42] dedicated Lydia he's just been so
[37:44] instrumental in my walk with the Lord
[37:46] God chose him of all the people to do
[37:49] that so thank you brother Brooks really
[37:51] love you thank God for coming by I
[37:53] appreciate that
[37:54] 14 years can you believe it so we're so
[38:00] thankful and then before brother cam
[38:02] ministers a lot of people don't know but
[38:03] I was a ranked sinner until I stepped in
[38:06] Cam's car and listened to his Christian
[38:08] music Christian music is where I left
[38:11] god I've been fifth grade I bought an
[38:13] Amy Grant CD heart and motion I'll never
[38:15] forget it that's where I was I was
[38:18] memorizing Scripture by the dust and I
[38:19] was going to word of life with Eric Frye
[38:23] I was I was on fire for God in my little
[38:25] way you know but then as soon as I
[38:27] bought that I started falling away I got
[38:29] with the custer's and the you know the
[38:31] smokers and evil and then when cam let
[38:34] me borrow his car to go see my wife my
[38:37] first year of college I started liking
[38:39] this Christian music I'm like what has
[38:40] he gotten here this is pretty good and
[38:42] then it was three months after that that
[38:44] I got saved so just like Abraham
[38:47] wherever you leave God that's we got to
[38:49] go back and find it so I left God with
[38:51] music and God used cam to bring me back
[38:54] to Christ through music and then in 2010
[38:58] I hadn't seen any miracles than the
[39:00] message I saw I've already been
[39:01] pastoring for years really I hadn't
[39:03] really seen any miracles in my ministry
[39:04] and cam came and preached just once more
[39:07] Lord and after that John Graham and I
[39:09] started praying I think we pray 45
[39:10] minutes one night after service on a
[39:12] Sunday night and we started seeing
[39:14] miracle after miracle after miracle
[39:15] after miracle amen so I see how God used
[39:19] brother cam to point me to the
[39:21] supernatural now brother Brooks of
[39:23] course too but I needed that you know I
[39:26] needed cam to come in and priests and I
[39:28] men probably wet that service and God
[39:30] just did something real in my life and
[39:32] really pointed my eyes to the
[39:34] supernatural power of Jesus Christ so I
[39:37] just want to tell you and I would have
[39:38] made a great mistake in my book if you
[39:40] enjoyed my book you have a lot of credit
[39:42] to brother km ultimately it's the Holy
[39:44] Spirit but you know God gives you use
[39:46] man I was gonna make an awful mistake in
[39:48] chapter 5 on earrings I was gonna make
[39:51] an awful mistake but cams like Oh Jesse
[39:53] you're this this this this this he's
[39:55] right mmm and so God used him more than
[39:58] anybody else to help me with that book
[40:00] so I just want to make sure you know
[40:02] what a blessing you know God has used
[40:04] brother Brooks and brother cam these
[40:06] brothers have been so instrumental in
[40:08] establishing our church and keeping us
[40:11] going and so I just want to give them
[40:13] credit and thank the Lord for how God's
[40:16] used them okay that's my five minutes
[40:18] yes and praise God let's stand here and
[40:20] praise God this saying I worship you
[40:23] letting that course again every man
[40:25] wonder inaudible songs reason you're
[40:28] here
[40:32] [Music]
[40:55] [Music]
[41:02] [Applause]
[41:03] [Music]
[41:10] [Music]
[42:07] and everyone is working effectually to
[42:11] further the ministry of Jesus Christ on
[42:13] this arm amen so something especially
[42:17] these preacher brothers here they've
[42:18] just been more than amazing to me and
[42:20] I'm not even going to try to compare
[42:22] with that type of exhortation to the
[42:27] right but a husband by God's grace we
[42:30] just appreciate all these brothers and
[42:32] every one of you have been you've been
[42:34] friends you've been brothers and sisters
[42:36] and you know it's like they said to
[42:38] Christ they said you're your mother and
[42:40] your brother call for you and he said
[42:42] who is my mother my brother says they
[42:45] that do the will of my faith so I call
[42:49] you family and so it's a it's quite a
[42:52] pleasure tonight to see everybody in the
[42:56] house of God and especially a brother
[42:57] Dustin's sister that's he that's that's
[42:59] my deacon at home and say what he can
[43:01] save the day sometimes and I need a cup
[43:03] of coffee and already gone cuz brother
[43:15] Jesse said wife wake up in the morning I
[43:17] bought went out a little bit early so we
[43:20] do appreciate the that that little save
[43:23] there and it's just it's just good and I
[43:26] say this with all humility brothers
[43:27] sister we all should be whatever we can
[43:30] spend for the Lord we want to give them
[43:33] and if you have energy given your energy
[43:35] you can talk give them you're talking
[43:37] and if you can worship give them your
[43:40] everything that you are may it be given
[43:42] to him amen so we're going to get into
[43:45] the Word of God now Psalm 65 verse 4
[43:48] appreciates at home I had to change the
[43:51] whole Asher and before we come I said I
[43:56] said there's there's a couple sermons on
[44:00] the boat Pete and repeat Peter announced
[44:08] boat who's left
[44:10] he said repeat already God so he was
[44:14] trying to figure it out I had to put
[44:15] that together for me so for home this is
[44:18] a repeat for them but I've spent almost
[44:21] a dozen sermons working with this and I
[44:24] love what and brother Brooks is at that
[44:26] place we're coming back to the fullness
[44:29] of an Eden experience it may not be
[44:32] fully manifested at this point in time
[44:34] but the word was delivered 50 out some
[44:37] years ago to show us exactly how to get
[44:41] there and how to allow the Holy Spirit
[44:45] to take over our being amen so with that
[44:49] being stated let's go to Psalm 65 for
[44:51] then we're gonna go to Exodus after that
[44:53] 28 I believe got a lot to say and I'm
[44:57] gonna try to say it really quick I'm
[44:58] gonna try to bunch everything together
[44:59] try to give it to you this has been an
[45:01] amazing help to me but tonight tonight I
[45:04] want to make some sense of some things
[45:05] especially I I'll tell you what the
[45:08] reason I live is the worship you that's
[45:10] all and perfectly once again confirms
[45:13] where we're going brother thank you for
[45:14] being led of the Holy Spirit and we
[45:18] really really really need to give God
[45:20] more yeah he deserves so much more so we
[45:25] have to look at where we're at and judge
[45:28] accordingly and then see what we can
[45:30] offer our Savior and all she wants is
[45:32] you so God let it be so Psalm 65 4 it
[45:37] says blessed is the man whom thou
[45:38] chooses so notice this and cause us to
[45:42] approach unto thee all right so you're
[45:46] if you're here tonight what did he do he
[45:48] chose you to be here and now he didn't
[45:52] just
[45:52] choose you to be here now he actually
[45:54] has what he has made a move to cause you
[45:58] to approach unto him not into a preacher
[46:01] not into a church a bunch of group of
[46:03] people he has caused you to approach
[46:06] unto him Amen that he may dwell in thy
[46:10] courts we shall be satisfied with the
[46:13] goodness of thy house even of thy holy
[46:18] temple

[49:08] you like you deserve to be treated so
[49:10] we're asking Oh God tonight that may we
[49:12] from our heart to give you a sacrifice
[49:14] of praise and Lord surely Oh God be
[49:17] found in our minutes we love you worship
[49:18] you and praise your holy name Lord Jesus
[49:20] Christ and shirt stays together a and
[49:22] they seated the mantle mile a little
[49:29] foundation down and by the grace of God
[49:31] we will get right to this as a blessing
[49:33] at home I know be a blessing to you just
[49:35] trusting so but we have to realize that
[49:39] exactly with the Garden of Eden it was a
[49:41] special place and Eden was so special
[49:45] because even as your prophet said he
[49:47] said he said God would walk down in the
[49:49] cool of the evening amen who said he'd
[49:51] set Adam and Eve a senator in his lap
[49:56] there's a it was a place of fellowship
[49:59] it was a place where where God's
[50:01] creation could actually be intimate with
[50:03] him amen and they could feel the love of
[50:06] God in income encompassing them amen and
[50:09] making them realize that they were
[50:12] chosen they were special they were
[50:14] called of God to actually
[50:17] please him amen they were his children
[50:19] hallelujah and this is all in like
[50:23] manner where we'll be going tonight
[50:26] entrance into the Holies of Holies and
[50:30] our topic tonight will be dressed for
[50:33] service amen so a lot of us tonight Amen
[50:36] you got your high on you got two nice
[50:40] dress on then the cuties got through
[50:42] Sunday stuff on it's just it's just
[50:44] something amen but notice where we're
[50:47] going we're talking about entering into
[50:49] the Holies of Holies they met and by the
[50:52] grace of God we want to take the manner
[50:55] which we feel the spirits pressing us
[50:57] and then go in to dress for service all
[51:01] right now remember in the book of Peter
[51:03] here in 1st Peter 2:5 it says ye also as
[51:07] lively stones are built up a spiritual
[51:11] house an holy priesthood to offer up
[51:13] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[51:17] and by our God by Jesus Christ amen so
[51:21] we understand when in the Book of
[51:23] Revelations 1 where it actually said
[51:25] that you are now he has made you priests
[51:27] and kings unto our God in it that God
[51:31] actually by giving you the baptism of
[51:33] the Holy Ghost he has now called you to
[51:36] be a priest unto Him in don't think
[51:39] about this while you're sitting in the
[51:40] seat right here you are not here to be
[51:43] entertained you are not here to be
[51:45] amused you are actually here to do
[51:47] service unto our God so in the commonly
[51:52] Rossio we have the idea that what we
[51:55] love entertainment we love things that
[51:57] bring us pleasure but brother/sister we
[51:59] the greatest thing that Chicago how our
[52:02] heart is how we can entertain our
[52:04] guardian and then remember he made you
[52:08] body spirit and soul and each matter of
[52:12] that but has her brother work with last
[52:14] week there's a hunger there but what in
[52:17] fulfilling that hunger we are able then
[52:20] to please God through that ever
[52:23] hallelujah please go through your body
[52:25] what do you gotta do you gotta worship
[52:27] him a little bit amen
[52:28] you want to please go through your
[52:29] spirit amen well you know what you gotta
[52:31] feed yourself with the wired in it I'll
[52:34] even let that berth forth some praise
[52:36] from your life amen
[52:37] and of course if you want to hit it on
[52:39] the soul level get the baptism of the
[52:41] Holy Ghost amen and one out of your
[52:44] belly shall flow rivers of living water
[52:46] even so notice and this is always the
[52:51] fun time because we say hope already had
[52:53] a long run today getting awful tired
[52:56] amen poor sister Julie's having to wake
[52:58] up brother came in the morning and by
[53:01] the grace of God the Bible still states
[53:03] that you will have to offer up spiritual
[53:07] sacrifices he men that is the fruit of
[53:10] your lips giving praise unto God even
[53:12] alright now notice listener I'm gonna
[53:15] take a little dip with this because it's
[53:17] so easy for us to sit there and say
[53:20] glory to God I'm a priest under God and
[53:22] I'm a priest
[53:23] and I want you to see what Christ was in
[53:25] fulfilment in Hebrews 4:14 he says he
[53:28] says seeing then that we have a great
[53:30] high priest like that that's
[53:33] Christ there amen he says that is passed
[53:35] into the heavens Jesus the Son of God
[53:38] let us hold fast our profession in it
[53:43] alright God put something on your heart
[53:45] amen god it's going to give you your
[53:46] family hold it right there it won't
[53:49] fasten it don't ever bring a false
[53:53] testimony by that you hold right on to
[53:57] the professor you say yes God it's gonna
[53:59] happen no matter how many people say
[54:01] you're crazy or how crazy they look you
[54:03] stand right there I'm holding a
[54:06] spiritual sacrifice that God is going to
[54:09] do it amen
[54:10] now notice she says we have not a high
[54:12] priest which cannot be touched with the
[54:14] feeling of our infirmities but was in
[54:16] all points tempted like as we are yet
[54:19] without sin oh what a great high priest
[54:24] we have amen
[54:25] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[54:29] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[54:33] and find grace to help
[54:35] in time of need amen notice now the
[54:39] thought here because now he's saying
[54:41] that Christ is what at the throne
[54:44] working as a high priest amen and look
[54:47] at what it is we see now the scripture
[54:50] tells us in Hebrews that now we can
[54:52] boldly come to the throne of grace amen
[54:57] so that actually states that they're in
[54:59] heaven where this is that God made a way
[55:02] that you can approach them in your
[55:05] prayer can reach very good faith can
[55:08] reach them not to come boldly in that
[55:13] word gold means without fear even don't
[55:16] fear God is going to hear my prayer amen
[55:21] which is concerning me because now look
[55:31] at what the scripture of course did when
[55:34] Jesus Christ died the scripture says
[55:37] there in Matthew 27 50 says Jesus when
[55:42] he had cried again with a loud voice
[55:44] yielded up the ghost and behold as you
[55:48] see the picture the veil of the temple
[55:50] was rent in twain from the top to the
[55:54] bottom and the earth did quake and the
[55:58] rocks rent him and hey when God comes
[56:00] down to tear something it's gonna make
[56:03] the rocks rent and it's going to make
[56:05] the earth quake amen but notice what
[56:08] this was this was the temple in the
[56:11] first scene and tight by the tabernacle
[56:14] and now it's coming to the place where
[56:16] Christ bag and lot that the very veil
[56:20] that separated man from the full
[56:22] presence of God which was the Garden of
[56:25] Eden the Holies of Holies amen
[56:27] that place was now right opening now why
[56:32] was it ran open remember there was only
[56:34] one that could go in once a year and
[56:37] that was the high priest it was the high
[56:40] priest hallelujah but now there's
[56:44] nothing that would only allow the high
[56:48] priests
[56:54] all right brother enter into the holiest
[57:02] by the blood of Jesus to enter the
[57:10] holiest of my new and living way which
[57:27] he hath consecrated for us through the
[57:29] veil that is to say his flesh and having
[57:33] a high priest over the house of God let
[57:35] us draw near with a true heart in full
[57:38] assurance of faith having our hearts
[57:40] sprinkled from an evil conscience and
[57:42] our bodies washed with pure water
[57:45] now I'm gonna I want to take this right
[57:47] now and I wanna I want to turn the
[57:48] direction a little bit all right because
[57:50] I want you to see this because we have
[57:52] over and over seeing Christ is the high
[57:54] priest he's standing there but I want
[57:57] you to see what he is assuring you to do
[58:00] on a night where once the veil was set
[58:03] so that if you had walked in there you
[58:05] would die now the veil has been torn so
[58:09] that you can go in maybe that was done
[58:12] 2,000 years ago that wasn't done tonight
[58:14] that was done two thousand years ago
[58:17] what do you think the book of Acts heals
[58:19] the book of Acts was the opening of the
[58:22] word for the church to go into the
[58:24] Holies of Holies but notice now the
[58:29] great high priest is calling you into
[58:32] the holiest of all yes let's look at
[58:36] this a prophet said some things that
[58:38] just it makes your mind go question
[58:42] answers 59 says God lives in their heart
[58:45] and they are peculiar people a royal
[58:49] priesthood offering spiritual sacrifice
[58:52] that's the fruits of their lips giving
[58:54] praise to God whether they feel like it
[58:58] or not so notice you're supposed to give
[59:01] praise to God
[59:02] you like it or not you say brother
[59:05] what's wrong with the message frankly we
[59:08] do not worship God very well and then
[59:10] that's one thing how do you know the
[59:12] things yourself only then let's think
[59:14] about that hey it's coming at home
[59:17] brother sister hey no do you realize
[59:21] that it is the god of this evil age
[59:24] right now yes who is now trying to be
[59:28] your God you say I'm in the message now
[59:34] let's think about this I'm gonna make a
[59:36] statement I'm gonna run yeah I told you
[59:37] let the Holy Spirit oh I must say you
[59:39] say God think about the god of this evil
[59:44] age he is now oh my phone broke yeah god
[59:52] you're gonna see this when the high
[59:54] priest went into the holiest of Holies
[59:56] he had on the Urim and Thummim
[59:59] it was the breastplate it was sitting
[1:00:01] right there yeah say why you holding
[1:00:03] this there cuz Satan has one too it was
[1:00:09] God's will by the Urim and Thummim that
[1:00:14] all they would have to do is ask him and
[1:00:16] he would tell them to go out or to come
[1:00:18] in he said David you go here you go
[1:00:21] there but now look at what Satan is now
[1:00:24] put in your hands now I want you to see
[1:00:28] this we say Oh YouTube Facebook all
[1:00:31] these things how do they make so much
[1:00:33] money they have found by the technology
[1:00:36] of the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:00:39] evil that was they can manipulate you by
[1:00:43] something on you I'm gonna give you
[1:00:46] something in the minute here because
[1:00:47] you're supposed to have something on
[1:00:49] YouTube and now it's the cell phone
[1:00:53] remember just like that Holy Ghost it's
[1:00:55] got a buzzer this has got a buzzer and

[1:01:15] tell you this operation so you just
[1:01:16] texting you can't Amen but I'll tell you
[1:01:18] this but now by the one by the reason of
[1:01:22] greed they have found that they have the
[1:01:25] complete ability to manipulate you to
[1:01:28] become your God
[1:01:31] that's why recently at all and he say
[1:01:33] conspiratorial hey man I'm on there
[1:01:36] right now I'm glory to God hallelujah
[1:01:37] you're exposed amen but we find that
[1:01:40] watch now if you start talking about it
[1:01:44] they'll put it right in front of the
[1:01:46] other I just talked about that why is it
[1:01:52] right we talked about we thought my
[1:01:55] insurance next you know I lose my phone
[1:01:57] insurance is it they're trying to
[1:02:00] manipulate you you get on YouTube and

[1:02:08] you you say I need to pray oh look at
[1:02:11] the next YouTube video I guess I'm on
[1:02:13] that and so what now Satan has become
[1:02:18] your God yeah it might not be filthy
[1:02:22] filthy stock in my be yeah if it is you
[1:02:25] beg your rid of it yeah but he's
[1:02:28] controlling he's holding his bondage
[1:02:31] that's why that's why these people they
[1:02:32] say they say that the addiction to a
[1:02:34] form is like a heroin Otis God himself
[1:02:45] he what he knows everything about you
[1:02:49] hallelujah in that way go look at the
[1:02:51] counterfeit see yes now he's watching

[1:02:57] devil now God is looking at your every
[1:03:01] move he said I'm going to anoint this to
[1:03:04] righteousness

[1:03:14] and the black dog says oh wait a minute
[1:03:17] what about this what about this what
[1:03:18] about this
[1:03:19] so now you have two forces yes notice
[1:03:23] how Satan uses technology to become your
[1:03:26] God a man it gets you hooked on what
[1:03:30] hallelujah if he can't get you hooked on
[1:03:31] YouTube ill get you hooked on shopping
[1:03:33] amen oh yeah then he gave you that don't
[1:03:35] look at your search and everything that
[1:03:37] you're interested in don't lead you that
[1:03:40] route until you find out you have more
[1:03:44] interest something because God wants to
[1:03:50] be holding a God and he wants to do to
[1:04:03] you that's greater than what this could
[1:04:06] give you hallelujah is greater than the
[1:04:10] satisfaction that this tiny little box
[1:04:13] gets you but notice where Christ wants
[1:04:17] your eyes on the bloody footprints all
[1:04:24] of a sudden now this thing wants your
[1:04:25] eyes right and it takes you everywhere
[1:04:28] you go now if you're really if you
[1:04:31] really want the devil to get a little
[1:04:33] hand on you thank you but all you got to
[1:04:37] do is look at your screen time line up
[1:04:40] the Bible time the message time right
[1:04:43] with the rest of your time and you'll
[1:04:45] find out who is really manipulating you
[1:04:49] to be your God
[1:04:58] oh it's because you're a priest and here
[1:05:04] a priest you can't do the priestly
[1:05:06] sacrifices if you're not in a certain
[1:05:09] state amen right yes all right now look
[1:05:12] all right let's continue
[1:05:16] he said let's skip one no all right
[1:05:20] let's go here so whether if he at times
[1:05:23] I do not see him said the songwriter I
[1:05:25] trust and give him praise say well I go
[1:05:29] to church and I praise the Lord if I
[1:05:31] felt like it well now a priest is the
[1:05:34] make a sacrifice and you the
[1:05:37] congregation and you the congregation
[1:05:40] are high priests of God and we know I
[1:05:54] know for a fact brother Branham when he
[1:05:56] talked about the high priest there's
[1:05:57] only one hybrid and that is Jesus Christ
[1:06:01] but I don't want you to miss this why
[1:06:04] would the Prophet be anointed and call
[1:06:06] the congregation High Priest you we just
[1:06:10] showed you that because right there when
[1:06:13] that veil was torn now it allowed every
[1:06:17] single one of you enter into the Holy of
[1:06:22] Holies and wait a minute I thought the
[1:06:25] high priest was the only one can go in
[1:06:27] but don't you share they make driving
[1:06:32] away for you to go in there then another
[1:06:37] person he said every year once a year he
[1:06:40] said how the people who looked at Aaron
[1:06:42] and how they must have envied him the
[1:06:45] envies over brother sister hey there's
[1:06:50] no longer dictated so one man here
[1:06:53] one man going is a high priest now the
[1:06:56] whole congregation can go into the
[1:07:00] Holies of Holies
[1:07:03] hallelujah you go down and say well if I
[1:07:10] felt like it I'd go over and testify to
[1:07:13] somebody well do it anyhow that's a
[1:07:17] priest that's a high priest under God
[1:07:20] if you're a high priest brother it's
[1:07:23] burning in your heart whether you feel
[1:07:27] like doing it or not okay that ain't
[1:07:30] just for tonight brother sister every
[1:07:33] service you come here every morning you
[1:07:35] wake up you are a high priest to go into
[1:07:40] the Holies of Holies they then
[1:07:43] hallelujah remember there's three
[1:07:47] elements that you could have when you
[1:07:49] went into the Holies of Holies within
[1:07:51] the Holy of Holies
[1:07:52] you had the manna Aaron's rod and the
[1:07:56] Ten Commandments your prophet said that
[1:07:58] manner he said you can have that every
[1:08:01] day but I'll tell you what if it's open
[1:08:04] you can have it all every day and ride
[1:08:09] how do you put it in there and overnight
[1:08:11] it buts forth and gives life the Ten
[1:08:16] Commandments the very word of God made
[1:08:18] manifest this is what I love and you say
[1:08:21] oh god I love your words like we read
[1:08:24] this morning oh how do you hear your
[1:08:25] commandment now so what's burning in
[1:08:33] your heart right now don't worry those
[1:08:37] glands they make sweat you know back in
[1:08:47] the old day these revival days everybody
[1:08:49] was also can well everybody was
[1:08:53] worshipping everybody was loving God
[1:08:55] everyone realized they had a part to
[1:08:57] play in the house of God and that's
[1:09:00] where we're going here now notice he
[1:09:02] said he said it's burning your heart
[1:09:05] whether you like you feel like you
[1:09:06] they're not go do it anyhow because
[1:09:08] you've got to make a sacrifice something
[1:09:10] that's hard to do you say brother cam
[1:09:14] it's hard to Amen and I absolutely it
[1:09:16] might be you're tired you've been
[1:09:17] sitting in the word all day you know the
[1:09:34] church gets together in unity there's a
[1:09:37] sound like a Russian he just wants the
[1:09:42] church for any of your spiritual
[1:09:55] priesthood a wrong people giving praise
[1:09:58] to God because God lives in this heart
[1:10:02] is that he is 58 he said beggar has mean
[1:10:06] ought to know that somebody's alive
[1:10:09] around here and it's known by the walk
[1:10:12] you do to holy holy holy unto the Lord
[1:10:16] the noise gives praise and glory we're a
[1:10:19] high priests offering spiritual
[1:10:22] sacrifice the fruits of our lips giving
[1:10:26] praise to his name that's what we are
[1:10:29] the fruit of our lips giving praise to
[1:10:33] all right
[1:10:34] so what do we have here we got a whole
[1:10:37] group of high priests well what makes
[1:10:40] you a high priest because we're in the
[1:10:41] Holies of Holies right now the new you
[1:10:47] now remember when God did sign in the
[1:10:49] tabernacle remember when God gave it to
[1:10:52] Moses on Mount Sinai to the actual
[1:10:54] conception in the first month was
[1:10:56] actually nine months perfectly perfectly
[1:11:01] nine months typing lot no whenever this
[1:11:05] Tabernacle was formed so that man would
[1:11:09] go and worship to it
[1:11:12] but the original Tabernacle the women
[1:11:15] could not go in the chorus the men could
[1:11:20] only go into the outer court
[1:11:23] remember when David said he said he said
[1:11:26] uh he said I'd rather be a doorkeeper in
[1:11:30] the house of the wicked he said that
[1:11:36] because he was it was normal could only
[1:12:16] enter body so that was the very soul of
[1:12:25] God the bride is called to be united to
[1:12:28] it and that alone was for the high
[1:12:32] priest Jesus very minute hallelujah so
[1:12:47] notice here that what God's design is
[1:12:51] God's design is for you to enter in and
[1:12:55] here in the way doesn't want you here
[1:12:56] now he's gonna take what you have to
[1:12:58] give him if you like being at that state
[1:12:59] hey there's why there's a separation for
[1:13:02] you go in that's right right but what
[1:13:05] God wants he wants you're Adi he wants
[1:13:07] your spirit he wants your soul he wants
[1:13:09] everything that you are to be in the
[1:13:12] very heart content of gum right here
[1:13:16] where the Shekinah glory was looming
[1:13:19] above the mercy seat
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:22] but I want you to see this so okay we're
[1:13:26] called to be high priests well I want
[1:13:29] you to see this because Aaron he
[1:13:31] couldn't just walk in say guard it God
[1:13:33] it's a great stuff coming on in maybe
[1:13:35] then people might do that and go into
[1:13:37] the Holies of Holies
[1:13:39] if he would have done that it would have
[1:13:40] been a strange fire God like maybe
[1:13:43] having two by two and then he would have
[1:13:44] died just like them so God had to set up
[1:13:51] requirements of how the high priest went
[1:13:54] into the Holies of Holies no I got a
[1:13:57] sermon for all these they remember but
[1:13:58] I'm gonna just kind of him because I
[1:14:00] want to go somewhere in heaven it's
[1:14:01] first off they said my qualifications
[1:14:04] that the high priest had to be washed up
[1:14:09] into the water I've been baptized so a
[1:14:16] high priest has to be baptized but
[1:14:21] notice they couldn't just be baptized
[1:14:24] obviously I have scriptures and servants
[1:14:25] for all this but but you you study
[1:14:27] doubting them washed but notice and
[1:14:30] anointed so once they were completely
[1:14:33] cleaned out
[1:14:39] then they could look at him and see that
[1:14:41] he was perfectly washed clean how about
[1:14:44] water washing in the water the words
[1:14:54] remember they wouldn't take our songs
[1:14:56] 133 and they said how blessed it is that
[1:15:00] brother and well in unity it's like the
[1:15:02] oil that was poured upon areas for and
[1:15:05] rain down his beard down into the hem of
[1:15:09] His garment David so next his entire
[1:15:12] being would have to be one you don't
[1:15:18] have to be anointed you'd have to get
[1:15:20] the Holy Ghost you said I want to go
[1:15:22] into Holies of Holies
[1:15:23] you better get baptized you make a field
[1:15:26] of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:29] and that's what the high priest would
[1:15:32] have to do once a year well that of
[1:15:34] course is the red heifer for the waters
[1:15:36] of separation wonderful church and that
[1:15:39] water separation was done behind the
[1:15:41] cake it made a way so on so that the
[1:15:44] unbeliever could be cleaned and
[1:15:46] thoroughly purse good works amen but
[1:15:48] once I don't have it on here but on the
[1:15:51] the feast day of atonement excuse me
[1:15:54] then they would have the sacrificial
[1:15:56] goat and the state goat and laws they
[1:15:59] would have to do also the water
[1:16:01] separation on certain days but it was
[1:16:04] that state go he would be set free with
[1:16:07] all the sins of Israel Emporium amen but
[1:16:10] you see that sacrificial goat he had to
[1:16:12] be slain and what they would do is they
[1:16:15] would have the high priest take that
[1:16:17] blood and you would have to sprinkle all
[1:16:19] the he'd have to sprinkle the altar
[1:16:21] seven times he'd have to go into the
[1:16:24] into the holy place and sprinkle of
[1:16:26] seven times and then you have to take it
[1:16:28] to the mercy seat the very heart of God
[1:16:31] and sprinkle it seven times even so that
[1:16:34] High Priest he had to have before the
[1:16:53] people he watched that I preached he
[1:16:57] sprinkled every single one of those
[1:16:59] cores showing that seven church ages you
[1:17:04] can go into the Holies of Holies here
[1:17:12] remember
[1:17:13] the whole purpose Aaron was even going
[1:17:16] in the hosel horse was to apply the
[1:17:18] blood to the mercy seat so the whole
[1:17:20] population will receive mercy
[1:17:24] so what washed anointed you better take
[1:17:28] blood in with you but he also had to
[1:17:31] have incense he had to have a censor
[1:17:36] hallelujah they still do that in
[1:17:39] Catholicism
[1:17:41] it's just they're just trying to hold on
[1:17:42] to an ironic system yeah that one's done
[1:17:45] and gone now but there's still a
[1:17:47] priesthood around in the scripture says
[1:17:52] let my prayer be brought forth as
[1:17:54] incense so what God wants your prayers
[1:17:57] are you better get them always always
[1:18:00] you know God has all these parts every
[1:18:04] single one of them was a requirement of
[1:18:06] a high priest to go in say well I don't
[1:18:08] even pray
[1:18:09] well you better pray because that's part
[1:18:12] of entering into the Holies of Holies
[1:18:16] and now let's get to this thought here
[1:18:21] we'll close on this one how about it
[1:18:25] and the last one we want to touch is
[1:18:29] dressed for service so we rented the
[1:18:34] beginning in Exodus 20:8 how God's
[1:18:37] design was that that the priesthood
[1:18:39] would have garments for glory and for
[1:18:44] beauty so they just couldn't be washed
[1:18:48] may the anointing take blood but they
[1:18:51] had to wear particular garments of
[1:18:54] course the high priests in particular he
[1:18:57] had to wear certain garments in order to
[1:18:59] go into the Holies of Holies amen
[1:19:04] now let's look at what your prophet said
[1:19:06] he said now the high priest before he
[1:19:09] could go into that holiest of holy the
[1:19:12] first thing he had to have on a certain
[1:19:15] main garment
[1:19:18] it couldn't be made by anyone had to be
[1:19:22] made by holy oh I better have my wife I
[1:19:28] think this might be a different note
[1:19:32] that showed that our garments here it is
[1:19:35] just happen to come to me then brother
[1:19:37] if you're only wearing a church garment
[1:19:42] what kind of garment did you enter here
[1:19:44] tonight well a church garbage or a holy
[1:19:47] garment let's look at this the message
[1:19:50] can be a church a denomination for you
[1:19:53] it can
[1:19:53] a place where hey we believe this but
[1:19:56] that's not what gods after gods after
[1:19:59] you he says if you're only wearing a
[1:20:08] church garment you better get rid of the
[1:20:09] thing you can't go behind the holiest of
[1:20:13] Holies you'll never get into the holy
[1:20:16] communion with God you have to wear this
[1:20:20] specific guard yeah the garment that the
[1:20:24] high priest wore in there had to be made
[1:20:27] out of a holy hand to select the goods
[1:20:30] ordained of God there it is so if you
[1:20:32] join church and did your alright you're
[1:20:35] wrong
[1:20:37] seeing it has to be a God selected robe
[1:20:41] and our self righteous rags won't stand
[1:20:45] in his presence amen our righteousness
[1:20:49] is as filthy rats you cannot go in on
[1:20:53] your own righteousness so notice if your
[1:20:57] righteousness is filthy rags it don't
[1:20:59] matter who you things gonna make you a
[1:21:00] nice tire whatever you have to have the
[1:21:08] Holy Spirit which is the robe of God
[1:21:12] that dresses up the believer to go
[1:21:15] behind the holiest of holy hallelujah so
[1:21:20] the road that takes you in is the robe
[1:21:22] of God
[1:21:23] it's the garment of praise he said oh
[1:21:29] that's good I like that that was a new
[1:21:32] one never swallowed one like that before
[1:21:34] but that's here just that kind that's
[1:21:36] the real vitamin C it takes the holy
[1:21:38] s--t
[1:21:39] so now we see what we see every single
[1:21:43] element is the Holy Ghost your incense
[1:21:47] ooh what kind of prayers God want from
[1:21:49] you in them he said in Romans 8 he said
[1:21:53] that the Holy Ghost will bring forth
[1:21:55] moanings and groanings because we know
[1:21:57] not what to pray for how do we hear
[1:22:00] you're the one who showed me that
[1:22:01] brother Brooks he showed me that one
[1:22:07] it wasn't like groaning about never
[1:22:10] hearing scripture said oh glory to God I
[1:22:12] get it
[1:22:14] thank you brother blinks in 326 for my
[1:22:21] all right amen for ye are all the
[1:22:23] children of God by faith in Christ Jesus
[1:22:26] for as many of you have been baptized
[1:22:29] into Christ have put on Christ there is
[1:22:40] neither one in Christ so it depends what
[1:23:11] you're putting on yes what are you
[1:23:12] putting on a knife there's about 50
[1:23:23] servings here
[1:23:26] there's your Urim and Thummim your
[1:23:28] prophet said that was a Urim and Thummim
[1:23:30] and when when they go and ask they said
[1:23:32] they said the those gemstones would
[1:23:34] provide a rainbow that goes back and
[1:23:36] forth well see they get so specific that
[1:23:39] God would tell David and Ziggler he said
[1:23:40] go ye shall surely recover all lost
[1:23:45] everything all they had to do was
[1:23:47] approach the euro manna now think about
[1:23:51] that they had access to that Urim and
[1:23:53] Thummim the whole time but they were so
[1:23:55] back slid they never used it gave it was
[1:23:59] the one that used it David
[1:24:10] you see when you get to the book of Acts
[1:24:13] you see Philip the Holy Ghost said you
[1:24:14] go out into the wilderness
[1:24:16] the same experience return back amen
[1:24:21] so the the Urim and Thummim was only
[1:24:23] which hallelujah which is a
[1:24:26] representation of Holy Ghost it means
[1:24:27] the light of perfection which a lot of
[1:24:31] perfection Jesus Christ it was only a
[1:24:37] type of what the Holy Ghost would do for
[1:24:38] the church hey Anderson sorry man
[1:24:45] this high priest and we want to of
[1:24:47] course focus on the dressed for service
[1:24:50] he had to be dressed
[1:24:52] oh how how particular this garment was
[1:24:54] from all the rest and we got to get
[1:24:56] going a men huh so nobody's got to ride
[1:24:59] away of approach the fest get a little
[1:25:00] reading do hold on he says notice when
[1:25:02] you come in separation making confession
[1:25:05] so we got new would you come to know I
[1:25:07] confessed God forgive me any other wrong
[1:25:09] between now and then amen he says all
[1:25:13] right you can have fellowship with them
[1:25:15] you can come in then under the blood you
[1:25:18] can fellowship with him he said you can
[1:25:20] fellowship with them under the blood
[1:25:22] that's the purple that's true enough but
[1:25:23] to fellowship with God you'll have to go
[1:25:27] into the presence of God so the question
[1:25:30] is do we want to know God it's so easy
[1:25:34] for us and that's why that's why when
[1:25:36] people are spiritual it's so easy for
[1:25:38] everyone to cling to her it's okay love
[1:25:40] them but did you realize that God made
[1:25:44] each one of us to have communion with
[1:25:46] him in one shape way or form he will
[1:25:48] speak to you your father said that they
[1:25:51] might speak like he's speaking to me but
[1:25:52] he'll say have some way of quite
[1:25:54] speaking to you what we had a church
[1:25:57] move in life at very many I'll tell you
[1:25:59] it is in the mix now but to fellowship
[1:26:04] with God you have to go into the
[1:26:06] presence of God and that is into the
[1:26:07] Shekinah glory and one man once a year
[1:26:10] was dress it to go in this Shekinah
[1:26:12] glory where he fellowship with God face
[1:26:14] to face why it was so glorious in there
[1:26:16] one here he left his rider bloomed out
[1:26:19] blossom in the presence of the Shekinah
[1:26:20] glory
[1:26:21] oh yeah you want to blossom remember
[1:26:25] that almond branch and what it bought it
[1:26:28] that where flowers blossom and then it
[1:26:32] gave fruit all in one night three works
[1:26:34] of grapes take some time to get the Holy
[1:26:42] Ghost no go in Mary man sit there a
[1:26:44] little bit a 5-10 minutes hallelujah so
[1:26:55] brother sister you say brother brother
[1:26:58] branham once a year yes watch how he had
[1:27:00] to be dressed he had to be dressed in a
[1:27:04] certain garment made by certain hands
[1:27:06] only hands he had to walk such a way so
[1:27:14] the high priest didn't just have to do
[1:27:15] all that he had to walk in a special as
[1:27:21] far as I see that was that was your
[1:27:23] prophets revelation and I know he was in
[1:27:25] the Shekinah man notice he said he had
[1:27:29] to walk such a way on his garment he had
[1:27:32] a pomegranate and a bell and every time
[1:27:35] he moved his leg moving like that it
[1:27:37] played holy holy holy unto the Lord now
[1:27:43] stop for a second I'm just gonna break
[1:27:45] it out and I'm gonna give it to you do
[1:27:48] you realize that no where is it stated
[1:27:51] that it was holy holy unto the Lord that
[1:27:54] walk it can only be confirmed in this
[1:27:59] resource right the picture of heaven
[1:28:01] amen in Isaiah 6 when he went into the
[1:28:07] throne of God with the cherubim or the
[1:28:09] seraphim's
[1:28:10] net wings and what constantly in the
[1:28:14] presence of God himself the Saracens had
[1:28:17] to say holy holy holy holy holy holy
[1:28:23] bazooms the four guards in Scripture
[1:28:28] then they had four faces recognition of
[1:28:33] the of the difference
[1:28:34] upon those seven days and then to watch
[1:28:37] a guard god in his presence they had you
[1:28:41] constantly say holy holy holy what's
[1:28:46] your profit trying to tell you don't you
[1:28:49] see he's flying open the way back for
[1:28:53] the fellowship of the holy of holies you
[1:28:58] realize how deep this message is yes you
[1:29:01] realize what this means this message is
[1:29:06] so complex it is birthing us into the
[1:29:12] very marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:29:14] see it around the throne remember what
[1:29:16] was revelations for come up hither and
[1:29:18] John was caught up to the throne where
[1:29:21] they are doing this what's the picture
[1:29:23] we see their rapture then to the
[1:29:27] presence of God holy holy holy is
[1:29:55] providing us the way through the Holies
[1:29:58] of home because the holy sub Holies was
[1:30:01] the very type of the throne of God
[1:30:03] remember what was the what was the what
[1:30:07] was the tabernacle it was only a picture
[1:30:09] of the pattern that they'd seen he said
[1:30:18] what's he doing now why you see what
[1:30:19] he's doing your processes what's he
[1:30:22] doing he's approaching the Shekinah
[1:30:24] glory for fellowship with God himself
[1:30:28] carrying before you a blood oh I want to
[1:30:32] know God then first you have to see that
[1:30:35] you're a high brace you have to see that
[1:30:37] you're called to go you have to see what
[1:30:40] God requires well God won't talk to him
[1:30:42] oh we haven't been baptized
[1:30:44] well no but God won't talk to me God's
[1:30:46] got to force me
[1:30:47] don't you see that God can't break his
[1:30:49] pattern
[1:30:50] if you won't if you won't obey a simple
[1:30:53] word in in Acts 2:36 through to 39 that
[1:30:55] says repent and be baptized in the name
[1:30:57] of Jesus Christ remission ever since you
[1:30:58] shall receive to give the Holy Ghost
[1:30:59] house God gonna take you farther but
[1:31:04] when you can say oh yes Lord I see it I
[1:31:08] believe it I want to go in though so
[1:31:12] notice it's the approach for foolish oh
[1:31:16] god I wish I could have the voice of an
[1:31:20] angel now realize that sure edit I
[1:31:28] couldn't make that syncing notice the
[1:31:32] whole crime is hard was that this would
[1:31:35] sink into you continuing he said he
[1:31:41] didn't go for saying I am a presbyterian
[1:31:43] I'm a Memphis I'm a Pentecostal really
[1:31:46] cam could he add something I'm a message
[1:31:48] believer oh it was playing holy holy
[1:31:53] holy unto the Lord holy holy holy
[1:31:55] packing the lot but I went before him
[1:31:57] realizing an innocent victim died and
[1:31:59] remember he was anointed with precious
[1:32:01] an aura that the Bible said how sweet it
[1:32:03] is that brothers dwell together in unity
[1:32:06] it's like the anointing upon Aaron's
[1:32:07] head that ran all the way to him through
[1:32:09] his garment he was completely covered
[1:32:11] with a sweet-smelling savour of the Lord
[1:32:14] all notice what addressing how God see
[1:32:18] now you can see how he calls your high
[1:32:20] priests and this is why this is the
[1:32:21] whole picture God would like to get his
[1:32:25] church in that condition
[1:32:28] it didn't say get religious tea in that
[1:32:30] condition and brother Brooks and brother
[1:32:32] can't hate their preachers hey he wants
[1:32:34] every see I'm up on the church all the
[1:32:37] time I said I said I'll study 8 to 10 or
[1:32:40] even more hours if I got time just try
[1:32:42] and pray and try to get the sermon right
[1:32:44] and if the only responsibility that the
[1:32:49] laity feels like they have to do is to
[1:32:52] wake up and try to get to church on time
[1:32:54] if you think that is the correct service
[1:32:57] work now you're back at a Nicolaitans
[1:33:00] spirit trying to make your
[1:33:01] on a high priest in your just a calm
[1:33:06] this message of him to say that you are
[1:33:10] a high priest when the Prophet was what
[1:33:15] when he was preaching these things God
[1:33:18] began to what setup that type of a
[1:33:21] communing with the people in such a way
[1:33:23] that they would have to meet an hour
[1:33:25] before service with all the gifts to get
[1:33:28] a message that would go to the church
[1:33:34] hallelujah
[1:33:35] but I like that because you know it's
[1:33:38] always man's design to be seen yes yes
[1:33:43] you look how the Prophet said that okay
[1:33:44] you come an hour before 6:00
[1:33:45] oh you mean I got a sacrifice that much
[1:33:47] more you coming out early can you bring
[1:33:53] your gifts you have the gift of wisdom
[1:33:54] there you have all that there yeah and
[1:34:00] they said well nobody's gonna see it in
[1:34:03] church nobody's gonna see my gift
[1:34:06] Yeah right yeah it don't matter
[1:34:11] you're a - if God calls you to do that
[1:34:16] ya know that's the greatest thing he can
[1:34:18] do no yeah cuz you know how it is
[1:34:21] anybody wants to be a preacher everybody
[1:34:24] it's like trying to do God a service
[1:34:25] without being as well all over again
[1:34:26] yeah
[1:34:27] because of the church sets dead yeah
[1:34:30] right waiting on anointed brothers to
[1:34:32] preach waiting on the next revival
[1:34:34] serves the next can't mean waiting on
[1:34:36] all these things instead of realized
[1:34:39] that God
[1:34:45] [Applause]
[1:35:37] let's continue we're gonna move just a
[1:35:40] minute here I started real late I think
[1:35:43] it's too late for this hold on Jesus
[1:35:53] suffered without the gate that he might
[1:35:54] sanctify the people with his own blood
[1:35:56] then still don't stop this is keeping
[1:35:59] this isn't one quote then don't stop
[1:36:02] you've not come take that blood upon
[1:36:06] your heart enter in with the anointing
[1:36:09] of the Spirit upon you
[1:36:10] oh my packing the blood walking holy
[1:36:13] holy holy unto the Lord you know if he
[1:36:16] didn't make that noise in behind the
[1:36:19] curtain look at this the people didn't
[1:36:26] know whether he was dead or alive
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:31] I'm telling you brother sister I'll say
[1:36:34] it right now it is an absolute doctrine
[1:36:36] of the devil that we sit cold formal
[1:36:39] that's right anybody happy
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:16] hallelujah hi never seen a parent with a
[1:37:18] child in a little Johnny or tommy
[1:37:21] whoever it is running out on the street
[1:37:22] and they say because they love that
[1:37:30] child nation yes primarily to see this
[1:38:30] he says that's the only way they could
[1:38:33] tell whether he was still living in that
[1:38:35] great glory is because while he was
[1:38:38] inside they could hear a noise notice
[1:38:42] this
[1:38:43] I wonder what's happened to the church
[1:38:48] something went wrong somewhere that's
[1:38:52] the only way they could tell he was
[1:38:55] alive because some noise going on and
[1:38:57] people's are free
[1:38:59] of noise what's our problem versus we're
[1:39:02] afraid of noise I that's the reason why
[1:39:05] most of us can't we can get the Holy
[1:39:07] Ghost because here's the thing ya really
[1:39:11] Jesse he sold that thing in me so hard
[1:39:12] I'll never ever ever ever forget but he
[1:39:15] showed right through the scripture all
[1:39:16] the way that the Holy Ghost is something
[1:39:18] you see and it's something you notice he
[1:40:15] says it's a sign that we're still alive
[1:40:19] now wait a minute I'm trying to sing
[1:40:22] because what's he actually talking about
[1:40:25] he's talking about the garment this is
[1:40:30] beautiful this is beautiful you're gonna
[1:40:32] love it it's the order it shows that
[1:40:35] there's still a living spirit within us
[1:40:38] so now notice when noise is coming from
[1:40:41] you it's not a sign that you're a
[1:40:45] fanatic it could be yeah and what Satan
[1:40:49] will do everything he can to make you
[1:40:51] afraid but if there's a Living God why
[1:40:58] is that because remember it's not even
[1:41:02] you that's worship it's the God with any
[1:41:04] anointing we're not
[1:41:08] all right let's go a little bit further
[1:41:10] a glorious noise unto the Lord now let's
[1:41:16] notice Exodus 28 31 it says and thou
[1:41:19] shalt make the robe of the ether all of
[1:41:21] blue and there shall be a hole in the
[1:41:25] top in the midst thereof it shall have a
[1:41:27] binding of woven work round about the
[1:41:29] whole of it as or the hole of a
[1:41:31] Habersham that it might be not rent ok
[1:41:35] so God didn't want that that roll that
[1:41:37] Ethan he did not want that road to be
[1:41:40] torn at all he want to mention nice and
[1:41:42] strong no matter what was going on it's
[1:41:47] gonna be all right and beneath upon the
[1:41:51] hem of it shalt thou shalt make
[1:41:53] pomegranates of blue and a purple and
[1:41:56] have started round about the hem thereof
[1:41:59] and boughs of gold between them round
[1:42:03] about motifs of golden bell and a
[1:42:07] pomegranate a golden bell and a
[1:42:09] pomegranate upon the hem of the robe
[1:42:11] around the mouth and it shall be upon
[1:42:13] Aaron to minister and a sound shall be
[1:42:16] heard when he goeth in unto the holy
[1:42:19] place before the Lord when he cometh out
[1:42:21] that he died not I want you to see this
[1:42:23] because when you look at the tabernacle
[1:42:26] there was no chorus of Levite singers
[1:42:30] it's not found in the Old Testament that
[1:42:34] didn't come into the temple when David
[1:42:37] was anointed that being praised for the
[1:42:38] whole congregation but I want you to see
[1:42:41] this because when this was sold to Aaron
[1:42:43] the only knowledge was actually coming
[1:42:47] from the garnish Aaron didn't have to
[1:42:54] say a thing the garment spoke right from
[1:42:58] on him
[1:42:59] oh I want to go in the hallways of
[1:43:05] holies me not at a place you bind the
[1:43:09] Holy Spirit breathe not the Holy Spirit
[1:43:12] what about your seal to the day of your
[1:43:14] Redemption
[1:43:15] God wants to rush it from you you've got
[1:43:24] to be what he wants you to let him
[1:43:26] worship later remember was the Feast of
[1:43:30] Pentecost it was the feast of worship it
[1:43:33] was the feast of fruits but one of the
[1:43:35] grants was you had to worship if a
[1:43:37] strangers in your course he has to
[1:43:39] worship everybody worship because you've
[1:43:42] come under the Jubilee look at this
[1:43:49] bells in pomegranates
[1:43:54] this was the noisemaker that was on
[1:43:59] Aaron it wasn't Aaron himself in any
[1:44:02] form it was the Holy Ghost Dog yeah
[1:44:08] God could perfectly worship just fine
[1:44:12] without Aaron's help also Aaron had to
[1:44:16] do is what we still know that I'm God if
[1:44:22] you get this garment on you it might use
[1:44:25] your mouth now it might use your hands
[1:44:28] it might use your feet how do you
[1:44:31] remember you're probably talking about
[1:44:32] dancing in the spirit remember he got
[1:44:36] one day seen him dancing and getting
[1:44:37] into it it has any say lon he started to
[1:44:39] spice them and then he said the Holy
[1:44:44] Spirit said he said well if you had
[1:44:46] victory like she would can you be doing
[1:44:48] the same thing he said he said oh my
[1:44:51] think of it like that
[1:44:53] and whatever thing he said he said the
[1:44:56] next thing he said he says Methodist's
[1:44:58] foot started packing listen next thing
[1:45:03] you know he's not dancing to the floor
[1:45:04] he got the victory
[1:45:07] [Applause]
[1:45:20] [Applause]
[1:45:21] [Laughter]
[1:45:25] I see brother and he had a quote he said
[1:45:28] he said I've seen him dancing Spiritist
[1:45:30] I'd never see him get out of the order
[1:45:34] so wait so when's the last time you seen
[1:45:36] dancing spear yeah
[1:45:37] oh I wonder where the victories that we
[1:45:43] don't have a revelation of a victory
[1:45:44] right how can the seals be broke how
[1:45:49] could how can all these things be loose
[1:45:50] to us and Satan is so hard in our hearts
[1:45:53] and hard in our mind that we can't even
[1:45:58] see this is what we don't get if we
[1:46:05] don't if we don't enter in like a high
[1:46:06] priest remember if the high priest
[1:46:08] didn't go in there the sins of the
[1:46:09] people would not remain so then they
[1:46:12] would be under sin yes remember Court in
[1:46:14] Jewish history it was actually the day
[1:46:17] of atonement I think I've said this here
[1:46:18] before but on the day of atonement one
[1:46:20] time they had they had they released the
[1:46:23] scapegoat and the scapegoat actually
[1:46:25] came back after that so the Jews had to
[1:46:29] start a tradition of walking the
[1:46:32] scapegoat to a cliff and shoving it off
[1:46:35] to its death because they thought it was
[1:46:38] a bad omen when the state goat came back
[1:46:42] it was but you know what it was even
[1:46:45] more it was the grace of God showing
[1:46:48] them that they were not right with him
[1:46:51] and then we can't figure out why the
[1:46:54] Euro could ensue
[1:46:56] they couldn't figure out whether there's
[1:46:57] no supernatural they can't and there's
[1:46:58] nothing of God moving because the
[1:47:02] approach is wrong right so if God called
[1:47:06] everyone he'd be a high priest and got
[1:47:07] dead services what's wrong
[1:47:08] there's no supernatural moving in our
[1:47:11] myths hey if we got a no listen to so
[1:47:13] does this brother that sister for a
[1:47:15] pagina a testimony that we tell
[1:47:16] everybody about there ought to be a
[1:47:18] testimony
[1:47:21] [Applause]
[1:47:37] [Music]
[1:47:40] so notice this noisemaker bells and
[1:47:44] pomegranates bells and pomegranates look
[1:47:50] at this look at this pomegranate I want
[1:47:55] you to notice color the color is black
[1:47:58] it's the color of blood the inside of a
[1:48:01] pomegranate and notice there's times
[1:48:04] remember hey we all know Congress oh how
[1:48:06] tasty they are hmm oh what a mess every
[1:48:13] one of these things you got to break out
[1:48:14] of there now look at this Jewish
[1:48:17] tradition teaches that the pomegranate
[1:48:20] is the symbol of righteousness because
[1:48:22] it is said to have 613 seeds which
[1:48:25] corresponds with the 613 mitzvot
[1:48:29] or commandments of the Torah it is
[1:48:34] customary to eat the pomegranates on
[1:48:36] Rosh Hashanah that's good enough for now
[1:48:38] so now notice we live in a pomegranate
[1:48:42] boughs and it's actually the Jews
[1:48:45] counted out the seeds of course I mean
[1:48:46] hey hey you close your eyes Park there
[1:48:48] they know them they know what word it is
[1:48:49] they count out the seeds of a
[1:48:51] pomegranate and they said oh I cannot
[1:48:54] believe it there's 613 just like the 613
[1:48:57] laws it was counted out you know the
[1:49:01] revelation is each one of these laws is
[1:49:05] in a seed form and it's covered with red
[1:49:10] and you break it out
[1:49:17] some a little harder to get out than the
[1:49:20] old gypsy amen
[1:49:26] but I want you to see this because it
[1:49:30] would be these bells that would ring
[1:49:32] against the pomegranate so notice we
[1:49:37] can't it was a golden bath deity and
[1:49:41] notice the Bell made noise so he was
[1:49:44] ringing for the sound of praise so
[1:49:48] notice the noise it was deity ringing
[1:49:54] out a noise against the full
[1:49:56] commandments of God so when he walked in
[1:50:00] a specific way and through the holdings
[1:50:03] of holdings that probably goes Gromit
[1:50:07] would ring out the sound of 613
[1:50:13] commandments being with I'm gonna take
[1:50:41] the word for and I know this when Jesus
[1:50:44] Christ lived a sinless life he covered
[1:50:47] all 613
[1:50:49] [Applause]
[1:51:10] hallelujah so notice how true this
[1:51:16] revelation sits for us now
[1:51:18] yes so now even according this message
[1:51:21] God called you to go in yes he doesn't
[1:51:24] require you to be the righteousness in
[1:51:27] any aspect he only wants your life to
[1:51:32] ring for holy holy holy
[1:51:34] and as you walk in a specific way those
[1:51:37] bells ring out the melody of the perfect
[1:51:40] life of the world it didn't matter if
[1:51:43] Aaron was a sinner and in matter of
[1:51:45] Aaron failed before he come in or when
[1:51:47] he went out he got under the Holy Ghost
[1:51:50] of every single one of those tokens and
[1:51:57] then he went in he showed him that he
[1:52:00] was Saints don't miss it at your home
[1:52:41] Church don't care where you from who
[1:52:43] you're from you guys do because it
[1:52:48] doesn't matter people are gonna think
[1:52:49] you're crazy there is such a delusion
[1:52:51] over the church by office that they
[1:52:53] think any formal worship we look like
[1:52:55] Methodists the people the message look
[1:52:56] like Memphis they look like Baptists
[1:52:58] they look like all these denominations
[1:52:59] we look exactly the same way that's why
[1:53:02] everybody's getting form and program
[1:53:04] hallelujah hey I can't meet a couple
[1:53:07] years ago they were trying to figure out
[1:53:09] this brother came in and he brought a
[1:53:10] 32-page worksheet about how to know a
[1:53:13] gift of spirit you have message camps
[1:53:22] you wanna know how we're gonna know what
[1:53:24] kind of gift we have yeah you're getting
[1:53:27] the holy so holy and you get in there
[1:53:30] sit like Aaron's rod don't worry he'll
[1:53:33] show it but you see what it is you've
[1:53:36] done the same thing they live on a glare
[1:53:39] for another day but they don't enter
[1:53:40] into the promised word they were given
[1:53:43] this word says go in look at this he
[1:53:50] said oh he said the high priest was here
[1:53:52] went in one time a year with a blood
[1:53:54] before him and worship and she kind of
[1:53:56] going all anointed anointed walking he
[1:53:58] had garments on that had a pomegranate
[1:54:00] in the belly and a walk with that in
[1:54:02] such a step that he played holy holy
[1:54:03] holy in the Lord holy olio in the Lord
[1:54:05] he said packing the black performers
[1:54:07] what a beautiful picture of the church
[1:54:09] today look at this walking into and you
[1:54:16] know the reason he made them bells the
[1:54:19] people on the outside didn't know
[1:54:21] whether he was alive or not unless he
[1:54:23] was making some noise now look at this
[1:54:25] look at this
[1:54:26] I'm telling you brother dead church that
[1:54:34] don't make any noise see I'm sick and
[1:54:39] tired of all this Pentecostal brother
[1:54:41] cam I'm sick and tired of all of it I'm
[1:54:45] a high priest you're high priest
[1:54:52] it ain't me making a noise yeah it's my
[1:54:55] god and I'm guilty too
[1:54:57] [Applause]
[1:54:59] you know the thing if you like the
[1:55:01] worship you get around a big stagnant
[1:55:03] bunch of people you kind of feel a
[1:55:04] constraint what why is that feeling a
[1:55:08] constraint coming to you is that
[1:55:10] constraining you or is it coentrão Holy
[1:55:11] Ghost it's a pressure on you to
[1:55:15] constrain the holy gun
[1:55:19] so what do you give into well they might
[1:55:22] think I'm crazy Bay they might not
[1:55:23] welcome me back
[1:55:24] oh no not if you're spiritual priest
[1:55:27] right you're gonna worship God
[1:55:34] [Applause]

[1:55:56] make a rapture oh god help God is every
[1:56:02] everywhere you find God you find a lot
[1:56:04] of noise exactly right when Jesus went
[1:56:06] to Jerusalem they broke down poems then
[1:56:09] gallium the Galleon peasants begin to
[1:56:10] sing Hosanna to him that cometh the name
[1:56:13] of Lord some of those Pharisees said oh
[1:56:14] that makes chills go up my back that's
[1:56:17] sacrilegious oh don't you do make them
[1:56:19] hold their peace
[1:56:20] Jesus said they hold their peace the
[1:56:22] rocks will cry off something has to take
[1:56:25] place when Christ comes in look at this
[1:56:28] is not a picture of today Luke nineteen
[1:56:31] thirty seven and we come back even out
[1:56:33] the descent of the Mount of Olives the
[1:56:35] whole monster disciples began to rejoice
[1:56:37] and praise got no notice with a loud
[1:56:41] voice for all the mighty works they that
[1:56:47] they had seen they just don't see enough
[1:56:49] mighty works well if you've seen one you

[1:58:15] that if these should hold their peace
[1:58:18] the stones would immediately cry out see
[1:58:22] the scripture and Peter God had lively
[1:58:25] stones those were never meant to be
[1:58:29] rocks they were meant to be his church
[1:58:33] because he is a rock and his church
[1:58:51] Allah tries to hold back worship I don't
[1:58:58] care if I looked like that Holy Roller I
[1:58:59] don't care I don't care if I'm call it

[2:01:35] Pole that but they can't even love God
[2:01:37] enough to worship right cuz they be let
[2:01:39] get creeds and formal jump bound them
[2:01:41] all down and then we can't figure out
[2:01:44] it's just a big intellectualism of junk

[2:06:31] the rocks with crowd and even see
[2:06:33] something is going to cry out when he's
[2:06:35] around say oh yeah you look at good
[2:06:38] services absolutely because it shows
[2:06:40] God's there but that's not the proof
[2:06:43] that God's there look at the word that's
[2:06:46] where Pentecost went rolled they went
[2:06:47] for the noise and left out the word but
[2:06:50] this message came to give the word so
[2:06:54] that the noise would be in unison with
[2:06:56] the word
[2:06:59] rock this world tells you that it's the
[2:07:02] holy ghost that burst the noise anyway
[2:07:14] so he starts on my errand again when
[2:07:17] Erin's wedding she kind of before
[2:07:18] there's Pat he had to be anointed yet
[2:07:20] garments had a pomegranate bell and
[2:07:21] that's the only way that they knew there
[2:07:23] was still I would heard a noise and when
[2:07:25] I think that that's the only way that
[2:07:27] God knows whether we're alive or not
[2:07:30] notice not your brother sister God
[2:07:32] himself so the only way that God Himself
[2:07:37] will know you're alive is by those bells
[2:07:40] and pomegranates when you hear a little
[2:07:46] noise you take anything that's so dead
[2:07:48] that something happened to it to you so
[2:07:51] they had to tell whether he was alive or
[2:07:53] not
[2:07:53] by the noise that was made Oh our our
[2:08:02] dead church yeah I think God's got this
[2:08:07] little nugget hidden over there
[2:08:13] I say God Who am I you show me these
[2:08:15] things
[2:08:16] who might you show us these things we
[2:08:19] just want to be your people or failures
[2:08:21] at best but we love you going we can't
[2:08:24] serve you I hate me we're glad that we
[2:08:25] can get a Holy Ghost and please you in
[2:08:27] it we're glad you get a Holy Ghost where
[2:08:30] the song is to take blessing is the man
[2:08:32] who God will not impute iniquity voice
[2:08:43] [Applause]
[2:08:50] so now he's talking about Aaron again I
[2:08:52] might jump down to he's he's approaching
[2:08:57] the Shekinah glory the real fellowship
[2:08:59] you want real fellowship with God that's
[2:09:01] where it is yeah hallelujah now you see
[2:09:04] he had the mothership roaster you
[2:10:20] letting the devil tell you that you
[2:10:22] don't have a good voice you can let the
[2:10:24] devil tell you that you can't worship
[2:10:26] you worship before the foundation of the
[2:10:29] world
[2:10:29] it don't matter what your voice sounds
[2:10:31] like he gave it to you he gave it to you
[2:10:34] because it pleases him where's all this
[2:10:42] stuff coming from oma songs 55:16
[2:10:49] as for me I will call upon God most on
[2:10:51] and the Lord shall save me evening
[2:10:54] morning noon will I pray and cry aloud
[2:10:59] and he shall hear my mama sometimes
[2:11:09] 80112 the chief physician if that's all
[2:11:11] the base have sing aloud under God our
[2:11:14] strength make a joyful noise unto the
[2:11:17] God of Jacob take a song and bring
[2:11:21] hither a timbrel the pleasant Harbor
[2:11:27] with the psaltery say God don't like
[2:11:31] beat he loves it it's just his beat
[2:11:36] maybe the devil's beat is God's being we
[2:11:40] have to have this sermon under the Holy
[2:11:41] Ghost yes one 32:16 I will also close
[2:11:45] her priests with salvation see the
[2:11:49] spiritual go and they're safe shall
[2:11:52] shout aloud for joy oh I'm safe shout
[2:11:57] for joy such as for preached it's for
[2:12:00] saints there I'll make the horn of David
[2:12:05] the bud
[2:12:05] I have ordained a lamp from my anointed
[2:12:09] hallelujah
[2:12:11] now let's bring to a little bit more of
[2:12:13] a point we're almost done he says we've
[2:12:16] got nothing
[2:12:17] thirsting for life just like brother
[2:12:20] Jesse preacher Church thirsty we've got
[2:12:22] nothing to be sad about we've got all to
[2:12:24] be happy about you have nothing to be
[2:12:26] sad about right now nothing nothing no
[2:12:33] wonder the people get noisy it's enough
[2:12:37] to make them noisy I kindly kindly like
[2:12:42] a little noise it's a sign of life he
[2:12:45] reading that quote ha are they you know
[2:12:47] anything I can prove scientifically and
[2:12:49] it hasn't got a little noise about it
[2:12:51] it's dead so if your religion don't get
[2:12:53] a little noisy you better bury it and
[2:12:55] get one that's got something so what he
[2:12:58] talks about Aaron in the palm green bell
[2:12:59] yet then jumping now underlined he says
[2:13:02] so his long
[2:13:02] you can still see people that's gotten
[2:13:05] of God in their heart to say Amen and
[2:13:09] the church says let's change the
[2:13:15] location if they got enough gone the
[2:13:21] heart say Amen in church in the presence
[2:13:24] of their boss or their neighbor so you
[2:13:31] can say brother Candace sense all about
[2:13:32] church but know you are temple you are
[2:13:35] the temple the Holy Ghost so wherever
[2:13:38] you feel that hole is the holy jump on
[2:13:40] you just can't help it the praise God or
[2:13:43] their neighbor whoever it might be it
[2:13:46] shows that God still lives life what is
[2:13:48] better than life what Stan Psalms 34
[2:13:58] verse 1 a psalm of David when he changed
[2:14:01] his behavior before Abimelech who drove
[2:14:03] away has something worship like that in
[2:14:09] front of people that were running out to
[2:14:10] change the behavior in front of them
[2:14:12] they don't like that I'm running out of
[2:14:14] there I will bless the Lord at all times
[2:14:19] his praise shall continually be in my my
[2:14:29] quiet
[2:14:30] no the scripture says in your mouth well
[2:14:37] I like fish and I like hunting I like I
[2:14:39] like walking I like racing I like all
[2:14:42] this yeah we can talk about all that
[2:14:43] stuff but what should be the chief sound
[2:14:47] coming from our mind the praise of the
[2:14:50] heart continually coming for my soul
[2:14:53] shall make her boast in the Lord the
[2:14:56] humble shall hear it here there out and
[2:14:59] be glad don't worry true believers gonna
[2:15:02] rejoice when you worship o magnify the
[2:15:06] Lord with me and let us exalt his name
[2:15:08] together
[2:15:11] I sought the Lord and he heard me and
[2:15:13] delivered me from all my fears so that
[2:15:18] High Priest when and where right there
[2:15:20] right for the mercy seat so when you go
[2:15:24] into that Holies of Holies you can pull
[2:15:26] from all those three sources of God God
[2:15:29] has three attributes that you can pull
[2:15:31] right from him in that hole is the
[2:15:33] hallways about our Dane through the door
[2:15:37] your prophet said that's the land of
[2:15:39] adoption yes a bunch of holy rollers you
[2:15:54] might not have ever worshipped like you
[2:15:58] think now maybe you should have don't
[2:16:00] worry about nothing mother sister right
[2:16:02] the first thing you do is you just love
[2:16:04] to hop right you love God and say God I
[2:16:07] want to you see the secret to all is
[2:16:10] yielding as long as we let people bring
[2:16:14] to our faults what receiving the Holy
[2:16:16] Ghost is your prophet said every new
[2:16:17] birth is a mess
[2:16:18] it's a mess it's gonna be messy yeah you
[2:16:22] ain't gonna get the holy go and say
[2:16:24] glory to God because when the Holy Ghost
[2:16:31] came in to Solomon's Temple with 120
[2:16:35] trumpeters it's so filled the place that
[2:16:38] the preacher could even preach they
[2:16:42] couldn't even stand administer God fill
[2:16:46] that place and the Upper Room it turned
[2:16:48] a bunch of cowards into a bunch of loud
[2:16:51] mouths that look like drunkards they
[2:16:53] jumped out of windows
[2:16:56] you mean we're coming back to that yes
[2:17:02] yes well play the girls look great
[2:17:12] we don't have to be afraid the only
[2:17:14] thing you have to be afraid of
[2:17:17] is it afraid that you will you to the
[2:17:20] wrong the wrong voice you say who I feel
[2:17:25] like worshiping oh I feel like getting
[2:17:26] loud what if I get too loud what if I
[2:17:27] get to allow remember as a brother
[2:17:29] Graham sister-in-law are gone and all
[2:17:31] whoever it was and they want to worship
[2:17:33] [Music]
[2:17:40] he's like she's like that I'd be wrong
[2:17:43] so yeah you should worship don't think
[2:18:00] the devil yeah chance you have to
[2:18:01] service you might keep it on right so
[2:18:07] what do we need your high priest you
[2:18:14] need to be washed
[2:18:15] you need to be anointed he already
[2:18:19] provided us a seven sprinkled blood you
[2:18:22] just carry that token right in what yeah
[2:18:23] you have to apply the token with your
[2:18:25] prayer the prayers your incense and then
[2:18:29] you gotta wear the garment God spent all
[2:18:36] that time sewing back to you because he
[2:18:39] wants you in the Garden of Eden and
[2:18:42] watch your back this message call us
[2:18:45] back charge it's our time but I know
[2:18:52] it's not the only problem we have we got
[2:18:55] we got that cellphone God who runs that
[2:18:58] self home you know as a serpent come up
[2:19:02] with that thing getting on there that's
[2:19:04] why it's got a big apple on it with a
[2:19:05] bite out of it oh that has nothing to do
[2:19:08] with the Garden of Eden Yeah right
[2:19:12] who who believes that because Tim Cook
[2:19:19] whoever has had this great idea about
[2:19:21] buying an Apple trust me it all has a
[2:19:27] purpose and look at what it's doing to
[2:19:29] us if you need to separate separate
[2:19:32] missus rapture don't miss your calling

[3:12:45] I love you
[3:12:51] and I live my vol.2
[3:13:00] were share you oh my so read your take
[3:13:15] my key hit one you he may it be a sweet
[3:13:29] sweet ha you know somebody just thought
[3:13:38] that I was trying to uh sure these
[3:13:40] people into a Pentecostal experience by
[3:13:42] telling them what to do I didn't tell
[3:13:44] them to say Jesus Jesus Jesus I didn't
[3:13:47] tell them to say lordy lordy Lord
[3:13:49] I was instructing them see that's the
[3:13:52] difference between the Pentecostal
[3:13:53] experience and that's the difference
[3:13:55] because if you pay attention to what
[3:13:57] brother Brandon was saying he even
[3:13:59] called a Pentecostal man is that right
[3:14:04] God in simplicity after the seals and he
[3:14:09] called a Pentecostal man who knew how to
[3:14:12] lead people into the Holy Spirit mi a
[3:14:15] high priest or not hallelujah come on
[3:14:22] from out it not only am i a pastor but
[3:14:27] God has made me a priest
[3:14:29] Anke hallelujah and the prophet of God
[3:14:34] said that the New Testament preaches our
[3:14:37] prophets so what we're doing tonight if
[3:14:41] I didn't know what I was doing do you
[3:14:43] really think I would play with God
[3:14:46] do you think that you're worth it
[3:14:49] nothing is worth my soul but I cry out
[3:14:53] for souls because I have experienced so
[3:14:56] many dead folks so many people in
[3:15:00] message don't even have the Holy Ghost
[3:15:02] and they think they got it they do they
[3:15:09] may be sanctified I'm not saying that
[3:15:11] I'm not saying then that I justified but
[3:15:14] when you go into the hole in the hole
[3:15:17] it's something has to change
[3:15:20] hallelujah you share a brother Brooks
[3:15:23] let me say something to you
[3:15:24] you've got to realize this Aaron's rod
[3:15:28] we never knew what it was a male tree
[3:15:33] cannot bring forth blossoms and birds
[3:15:36] and fruit it was the female tree that's
[3:15:41] dick was female come on come on you may
[3:15:48] not see it the way I see it but it was
[3:15:51] the stick that Aaron's rod the same rock
[3:15:54] that Moses hey somebody help me here but
[3:16:01] it was a mystery hallelujah the pride is
[3:16:08] being restored somebody help me here
[3:16:12] because she's going there hiding the
[3:16:14] veil she got there
[3:16:17] she was taken back there by a priest oh
[3:16:23] my god but while the limb of the rock
[3:16:28] was in that presence something
[3:16:31] supernatural happened right now we are
[3:16:33] in the presence of the Lord you may be
[3:16:36] dead but you have an opportunity tonight
[3:16:38] to not only blossom blue but bear
[3:16:43] almonds tonight the fruit is in you
[3:16:47] arrogant put it in yellow Moses didn't
[3:16:50] put it in you it was already there it's
[3:16:54] a seed of God think about putting you
[3:16:56] that DNA up teaser
[3:16:59] Christ hallelujah I'm not here to preach
[3:17:03] but I love souls
[3:17:06] I love souls I love souls keep thinking
[3:17:11] to me became crazy however you won't
