[45:22] there's a time the hops in their time
[45:24] though we don't want it's the signature
[45:26] speed
[45:27] speeding up is like just felt like I got
[45:29] preached on Sunday and here those
[45:30] already Wednesday things are just moving
[45:33] half of it back I looked at Malcolm
[45:40] today and even since last week there's
[45:43] young rich revelations three you won't
[45:51] I've seen the door and God where do we
[45:54] find Christ right here he is outside of
[45:57] the seventh Richard he's not allowed in
[46:01] the churches our Lord and Savior so good
[46:05] he's he's walked just been in the midst
[46:08] of the seven church ages all the way
[46:10] through time and here we find him on the
[46:12] outside trying to look in he's trying to
[46:16] get in right he said at the door and
[46:18] he's knock it is a proper talk he said
[46:21] many men in the preachers tried to
[46:24] incorporate this that he's knocking at
[46:25] the door of his heart of your heart you
[46:27] know he's just come on in and be my
[46:30] saying you know this is to the churches
[46:33] correcting all these things he says have
[46:35] any man and I like how the property says
[46:38] if any man he's as well hear my voice
[46:40] and open aura with I will come to into
[46:44] you know and we know by him and man it
[46:48] is an individual call this is an
[46:51] individual affair make your calling many
[46:56] are called but few are chosen
[46:58] they got calling and out of that shoot
[47:01] sure
[47:01] amen thanks God I just had a roof leak
[47:06] spring up my house brand-new roof about
[47:10] seven eight years old I think it already
[47:14] started to leave and God only showed me
[47:17] things from nature you know he's
[47:19] speaking to me and I'm thinking Lord why
[47:20] we're starting now and so I jump on the
[47:23] message search engine last night I typed
[47:27] in the leak and sure enough I come to a
[47:29] boat he said
[47:33] so I feel like my queer little hip has
[47:35] been down I muscled back to making a
[47:38] mint
[47:41] yes sir yes sir here he says never seem
[47:48] to change he says I stand the door and
[47:51] not he says and being pushed out or out
[47:54] stand he says then trying to back in
[47:56] cross back and knocks at the door this
[47:58] is the most striking record he says in
[48:01] the New Testament this thing's you
[48:03] strike our hearts and Graceland fresh
[48:06] wide open he says I think there's
[48:08] nothing could be more satyr than this to
[48:11] see the savior of the world took out of
[48:13] his own church right it's like demon run
[48:17] out of his room oh Christ run out of
[48:20] even-even inclusive on his own church on
[48:23] his own sermon on Matt and Luke for he
[48:25] was right out there trying to throw him
[48:27] down the hill headlock he says he says
[48:30] and I think there is nothing could be
[48:32] more striking even more sadder than this
[48:34] to see the savior of the world took out
[48:36] of his own church the Laodicean Amy
[48:40] after he done told them what they had
[48:43] did their richness richest richness and
[48:46] everything no other age kick them out
[48:48] but this ain't right he says and
[48:51] everything and what they were how they
[48:53] were lukewarm and so forth and they
[48:55] needed hat he didn't have to skew them
[48:58] out he says they had beauty don't look
[49:03] after leave but they so he says and here
[49:09] was all that still knocking at the door
[49:12] the unveiling was to do is a foreign art
[49:27] himself into you and make a man says he
[49:36] says how lukewarm they weren't so forth
[49:38] it didn't he didn't dispute about he had
[49:41] answered him out and here was all that
[49:44] so knock at door
[49:45] for what he says the very ones that
[49:48] killed him at Calvary he was trying to
[49:50] save her soul the one who killed him
[49:52] afresh after the Prophet brought an
[49:54] indictment this generation he's still
[49:56] tried to get it back in yes-mo says it's
[50:02] the most pathetic picture I've ever seen
[50:06] in my life or ever thought oh yes
[50:12] there's many things that the Prophet
[50:15] says about in the book of Revelation
[50:16] there's many scenes here the promises
[50:18] are some of the most important scenes
[50:20] when the land would it take the movies
[50:22] of the most sublime thing here we see
[50:25] Christ the most pathetic thing right
[50:27] here and then remember the reward he
[50:29] says but him to overcome it
[50:31] he says he says now that is the greatest
[50:37] [Applause]
[50:43] [Music]
[50:56] and we will overcome early thank you
[51:02] praise God
[51:10] revelations 1 verse 10 move on this I
[51:15] don't know how long so we will see how
[51:17] it goes but a good portion this has
[51:20] opened up but there's another portion
[51:21] like it's like a separate eye like a
[51:24] separate secret portion here this is not
[51:26] open praying it's going to what it does
[51:34] it will show some things in Revelations
[51:37] 110 days I was in the spirit on the
[51:39] Lord's Day and heard behind me a great
[51:43] voice as of a trumpet
[51:45] right now I'm see now we know these
[51:47] things we thought this thing for the
[51:48] gesture pastors as far these things
[51:50] before how we have to be in the spirit
[51:52] on the Lord's Day John would have never
[51:54] gotten this revelation
[51:57] he not been worshipping in carrying of
[52:00] carrying a ha out and carrying around in
[52:03] the island and getting a spear speaking
[52:05] he comes and running and jumping in the
[52:07] presence of Jehovah and God now comes
[52:09] down Jesus Christ comes down and gives
[52:12] the very revelation to him and he was in
[52:14] the spirit I yes of something tremendous
[52:18] now he says he said look he says any
[52:19] hard me a great voice as a sound of
[52:21] trumpet can anyone get that message on
[52:23] your cell phones today yeah presidential
[52:27] er presidential or to say no no action
[52:47] is what takes number that give every
[52:55] cell phone we're just thinking of
[53:05] ranking down anyway show Trump some
[53:10] penance all those things everything
[53:12] everything business because what it when
[53:15] I when that hit I go what is this it
[53:18] felt like my heart jumped like it didn't
[53:20] tank left that's how it affected me and
[53:24] personally I've meant something extra
[53:26] first thing to me because it came in
[53:28] 2:18 p.m. on my phone something's very
[53:32] significant took place this year don't
[53:35] agree for me now a voice like a trumpet
[53:45] revelation 1:10 and I heard behind me a
[53:47] great voice as but something John was in
[53:49] the spirit when he was he saw the great
[53:52] and wonderful day of our Lord Jesus and
[53:53] all his power the future was about to
[53:56] unfold or God was about to teach him
[53:59] John did not say it was a trumpet he
[54:01] says it was like a trumpet but now when
[54:04] a trumpet is blown and has an urgency
[54:06] about it
[54:08] oh that urgency would not think that my
[54:10] cellphone okay why are they because it
[54:15] was a test which means they're going to
[54:17] use this which means all right which
[54:21] means it's coming to the worst hints of
[54:23] God if you study your Bibles
[54:26] things got weird re surmount Philistines
[54:29] are amongst right he says he blows it it
[54:36] is like the heroine of Kings messenger
[54:37] coming to his people he grows on a
[54:39] trumpet he says is an urgent law the
[54:43] people gathering to listen
[54:45] Israel was always assembled by the
[54:47] sounding of a trumpet something
[54:49] important was in hand he doesn't listen
[54:51] to it so this voice and the same urgency
[54:53] of us did the trumpet clear and strong
[54:56] it was he says starving and awaiting oh
[54:59] that we might hear the voice of God and
[55:01] trumpet this thing any man for it is the
[55:04] gospel trumpet sounding forth the word
[55:07] of prophecy to make us aware of and
[55:09] prepare for what is coming upon a lot of
[55:15] time or subject of the oil and the wine
[55:20] or the healing prescription amen now we
[55:23] know that the healing prescription let
[55:32] me read this though we have all the wine
[55:42] charity or a board of the Holy Ghost
[55:44] you know we or that person is right if
[55:47] we're going to the Spirit of God we are
[55:49] not abyss and on Matthew 25 he says he
[55:52] says and I know you not right right
[55:56] he says how we think need this in this
[55:58] great hour that was all the hopes of
[56:00] mortal life has finished atomic bombs he
[56:04] says are living in hangars hydrogen
[56:06] bombs sickness diseases he says germ
[56:09] warfare he says I just I woke up I
[56:13] dropped the word today nice the Sun was
[56:15] coming up and there was chemtrails
[56:17] beautiful man's cloud look beautiful too
[56:27] we are protected Oh God everything that
[56:32] way though and the Bible said the man
[56:33] would actually rise hid their flesh like
[56:36] this thing but the angel was given a
[56:40] commission he says don't you touch any
[56:43] of those he says don't come here those
[56:45] who has the oil makes check yourself
[57:01] over every day he's saying I'm an alpha
[57:08] omega the first language he says what
[57:10] thou see us he says write in a book was
[57:18] John obedient yes sir absolutely we can
[57:21] read from it tonight right the
[57:24] revelation of God was now given to the
[57:26] angel and then the angel showed it to
[57:29] John and then John ruined all down they
[57:34] ran very calm
[57:37] yes sir he says write in a book and sit
[57:40] down to the seven churches which are in
[57:42] Asia right we all know these things was
[57:44] just rehashing a building foundation
[57:46] this is under Ephesus the smyrna for
[57:49] forgiveness and Avatara and under
[57:51] smartisan to Philadelphia today I want
[57:53] to see all right sorry agent no and now
[57:56] remember he heard this voice of a
[57:58] trumpet
[57:59] now Beverly said then John was weeping
[58:01] and he said they said don't worry John
[58:03] he says he says the lies a tribe of
[58:06] Judah has prevailed but when how they
[58:08] said it was a line but when they write
[58:12] it was like it was two full person you
[58:15] were part of his person right but now
[58:17] what John hears this trumpet and he
[58:19] knows is the very voice of God he says
[58:23] my turn to see the voices fake the in
[58:25] turn I saw seven golden roses here's the
[58:28] voice and it said I'm Alpha Omega but
[58:30] now look what he's looking back
[58:36] demanda the boys came out pieces now
[58:44] Jesus and if you want to get a beautiful
[58:46] picture of that lamp read about it in
[58:48] Zechariah 401 he says he says and the
[58:51] angel that talked to me came again and
[58:53] way to me as a man that has waked out of
[58:56] his sleep place shortly and started not
[59:00] today but he's in soon and setting to
[59:02] them watch he is down and I said I have
[59:05] looked at the old a candlestick of all
[59:07] full and it's about you understand that
[59:12] candlestick was not made out of wood he
[1:00:04] says this is so I look at all the
[1:00:09] candles to the Mogul
[1:00:11] and a bull was on top of it with the
[1:00:13] seven lamps there on right and six pipes
[1:00:16] to the Son of Man which are upon the top
[1:00:18] there and two out trees by it
[1:00:20] there's I'll see on this side on this
[1:00:22] side of the gold lamps right he says and
[1:00:25] on one of the right side the other on
[1:00:26] the left side he says so he said he said
[1:00:28] and the angel said what are these my
[1:00:30] lord
[1:00:31] he says saying what are these my lord
[1:00:32] then the angel that talked me saying no
[1:00:35] it's now not with these be and I said no
[1:00:38] my lord then he answered say to me this
[1:00:40] is the word of the Lord of this room for
[1:00:42] saying not by my my power but by my
[1:00:45] spirit saith a men
[1:00:49] so that that lamp stand was absolutely
[1:00:52] worthless unless the oil was in there
[1:00:57] that's the only way they can produce
[1:01:00] light otherwise you just - give it to a
[1:01:03] junk store absolutely because it was not
[1:01:05] producing light like a shoe and it
[1:01:07] needed that on our lives our producers
[1:01:11] should be like sup here he says and
[1:01:15] notice she says stop my power but by my
[1:01:18] spirit he says here is another lamp of
[1:01:21] pure gold
[1:01:22] he's burning brightly because can honey
[1:01:25] of oil which is getting from the two
[1:01:27] olive trees which stand on either side
[1:01:29] what does he say these olive trees are
[1:01:30] he says the two trees represent the old
[1:01:33] and the new testament of course the oil
[1:01:35] type refines the holy yes wall of God
[1:01:41] that was God was in the old and all the
[1:01:56] cloud would go and they carry the
[1:02:00] tabernacle here the table there what
[1:02:02] about for 40 years and that they have to
[1:02:04] carry that that's right even knowing
[1:02:14] seven Church as much as saying this is
[1:02:29] what it means to the church means that
[1:02:31] the church cannot accomplish anything by
[1:02:33] its own if we see if you want to topless
[1:02:41] anything for God it must be be the
[1:02:44] leader track leadership of the holy God
[1:02:46] and I want to go witness this person if
[1:02:56] I'm not letting the Holy Ghost
[1:02:58] nothing will actually bear fruit do we
[1:03:02] know or worthy
[1:03:03] because our works will be burned yes
[1:03:06] right good are very actions in our life
[1:03:10] what to do if they're not led by the
[1:03:12] Holy Ghost
[1:03:13] they'll be burnt if they have to hope
[1:03:15] that's right but the Bible says no
[1:03:21] footsteps of the righteous look how
[1:03:35] helpless we are without in John 5 verse
[1:03:39] 19 then answer Jesus said to Calipari I
[1:03:42] sense you the son can do nothing of
[1:03:44] himself even the pure Holy One God and
[1:03:48] flesh could not do anything without the
[1:03:51] father's leadership but what he sees the
[1:03:54] father do but what things sort of they
[1:03:57] do is they'll also do it the son
[1:03:59] likewise John 5:3 I am my own self can
[1:04:02] do nothing absolutely even the perfect
[1:04:05] one Jesus Christ could not do one thing
[1:04:08] without what the Holy yeah absolutely
[1:04:11] thank I just built this foundation
[1:04:14] moving by the grace of God in
[1:04:17] Revelations one in 20 after he sees the
[1:04:21] candlesticks he says and the mystery of
[1:04:23] the Seven Stars your thoughts Faust in
[1:04:25] my right hand and the Seven golden
[1:04:26] candlesticks he said in other words
[1:04:29] these aren't mysteries right he said the
[1:04:31] seven stars are the angels of the seven
[1:04:32] churches and the seven candlesticks
[1:04:34] which thou sawest are the seven churches
[1:04:36] correct true
[1:04:37] so now we know after a four thousand
[1:04:40] years what those actually represent
[1:04:46] let's move on here he's now in a
[1:04:48] time-tested faith I could get the eight
[1:04:50] he says now we know that no man can move
[1:04:55] a mountain just by speaking to it right
[1:05:00] Amanda and move or do anything just fine
[1:05:03] spoken word you speak you want this you
[1:05:08] want that Lord what about this you speak
[1:05:11] the word the only thing to do that was
[1:05:13] deity
[1:05:16] so then if the mountain is the force in
[1:05:18] our objective is right he says in our
[1:05:20] motive is right there isn't a speaking
[1:05:23] any remember what fiber secures go for
[1:05:28] the books caught that stroke and he was
[1:05:31] one side open all good he was he
[1:05:34] couldn't hardly walk you couldn't hardly
[1:05:35] speak and he got down on my knees
[1:05:37] ignored so if you want something if you
[1:05:51] have a very desire in your heart you
[1:05:54] check your motive objective why do I
[1:05:56] want this right well this Lord is this
[1:05:59] going to increase your kingdom when they
[1:06:01] say he says Jesus said I'm about my
[1:06:04] father's business is this gonna make
[1:06:05] your business bill and when there is
[1:06:29] your father's business Lord I want to
[1:06:32] open this door because of speedy Morris
[1:06:46] DeeDee speaking has to move I truly
[1:06:49] believe the church is on the brink of
[1:06:50] one of the greatest our boys have ever
[1:06:52] had this right on the brink of that what
[1:06:56] was that
[1:06:56] sermon this year by that one pastor
[1:07:00] Texas Jesus Christ came toward a dream
[1:07:03] and he said I'm going to fish today
[1:07:07] revival or movement as hard as 72 72
[1:07:10] years ago she started going back to
[1:07:13] history he's waking up waking up a woman
[1:07:30] you will not need one so we're right at
[1:07:34] the combination of time the the cup of
[1:07:38] the am right is full they say to God
[1:07:40] these people cannot get any more wicked
[1:07:43] wicked or middle the only way they'll
[1:07:45] get more wicked or more evil is if the
[1:07:49] Spirit of God is finding pull the bride
[1:07:51] and the Spirit of God is pull off the
[1:07:52] earth then all and the only thing up on
[1:07:57] the only reason we have servant of peace
[1:07:58] prosperity intersection or comfort right
[1:08:10] that's it
[1:08:11] what's the brightest bar what Satan that
[1:08:14] was going down yes and death right right
[1:08:20] amen like he says here in adoption 1960
[1:08:32] he says so emphasis he's dealing now
[1:08:35] with the book of Ephesians or the city
[1:08:39] of Ephesus receptive of Ephesians two so
[1:08:42] absences here sucks
[1:08:44] Plus like dying or positionally you
[1:08:46] notice Joshua after crossing over the
[1:08:48] land and tasted land then he divided the
[1:08:51] land at from here - is here and one here
[1:08:54] dad here Benjamin here and he's dividing
[1:08:56] the land and now he's typing the book of
[1:08:59] Joshua the book of had a perfect time
[1:09:03] he's everything here and he said what
[1:09:06] knows about the book of each of these is
[1:09:07] to mature church it is the one that can
[1:09:11] handle the deeper things and he'll to
[1:09:13] handle the revelations now diversity the
[1:09:16] one the second greatest mystery given to
[1:09:19] us in the binding was right there two
[1:09:21] peaches five between the Christ amen
[1:09:29] notice oh this just burns our hearts he
[1:09:31] says eternal super mothers giving birth
[1:09:34] to those children she spoke out the very
[1:09:35] place in her labor pains where they were
[1:09:38] position in the promise then who oh he
[1:09:40] says it's a great study and
[1:09:41] that's what she calls out every minute
[1:09:44] she labored was this any place to speak
[1:09:46] were setting oil all those things right
[1:09:48] so we continue to hit this he says and
[1:09:50] Josh were not knowing this but by
[1:09:52] inspiration led of the Holy Spirit after
[1:09:58] being in the promised land gave each man
[1:10:00] his promise exactly what the Holy Spirit
[1:10:03] promised through the earth back down now
[1:10:09] as the as as all these they the twelve
[1:10:12] tribes had went into the Promised Land
[1:10:15] there was many enemies there many things
[1:10:18] they have overcome and subdued he says
[1:10:20] and as it was tying now to give the land
[1:10:23] gladness in Joshua not knowing this but
[1:10:28] by inspiration letter the Holy Ghost
[1:10:31] after being ordered say in the Holy
[1:10:34] Ghost this is after being in the
[1:10:36] promised land he each man has promised
[1:10:39] exactly what the Holy Spirit promised
[1:10:41] back to the earth back from there all
[1:10:46] the placing was ordained fiercely by the
[1:10:49] Baptist amen
[1:10:52] the emphasis now we find the same thing
[1:10:54] the Old Testament I think this book of
[1:10:56] Joshua he says the book of emphasis of
[1:11:02] the Old Testament so be renamed the book
[1:11:04] of Joshua this is the book of Ephesus of
[1:11:07] the Old Testament the book of Ephesians
[1:11:15] of the Old Testament because pieces
[1:11:17] would be a good thing to call the title
[1:11:19] this book
[1:11:21] see how much he said in their equal man
[1:11:24] they're exactly the same
[1:11:25] he says why he is twice like she just
[1:11:28] his first wife's I didn't see this Paul
[1:11:31] must them he said they're exactly the
[1:11:37] same just the lack of the other he says
[1:11:41] would be good thing he says to title
[1:11:44] this book of Joshua because it's
[1:11:46] certainly fitting that be sold fitting
[1:11:50] to type Ephesians to Joshua
[1:11:56] look at st. Paul's revelations in
[1:11:59] Ephesians 2 I would say Paul know these
[1:12:03] things
[1:12:04] I said 3 scriptures issues let's jump
[1:12:08] jump the reasons 3 these are three verse
[1:12:11] 2 if you have heard of this but
[1:12:13] dispensation the grace was give me two
[1:12:15] you heard how that by revelation he made
[1:12:18] known to be the mystery as I wrote a for
[1:12:20] a few words whereby would you agreed you
[1:12:22] may understand my knowledge the mystery
[1:12:24] of Christ
[1:12:25] break it down mystery you think he's got
[1:12:26] some revelation here I think yeah this
[1:12:29] is which in other ages so now by the
[1:12:35] evil eye psyche they will say he's a God
[1:12:38] there was this this represented this
[1:12:46] this was this this agent this going back
[1:12:48] to the David saw a solid and all those
[1:12:51] we're gonna kind of agent right yes he
[1:12:54] says which in other ages not known unto
[1:12:56] the sons of man but has now revealed to
[1:12:58] his holy apostles and prophets by the
[1:13:00] spirit so I had to give up in the spirit
[1:13:05] yes like it'll be nice to verse 6 he
[1:13:16] says and made us sit together in
[1:13:18] heavenly places in Christ Jesus right
[1:13:22] that in the ages to honey notice how did
[1:13:30] st. Paul know this that there was more
[1:13:35] ain't no he just said um next chapter he
[1:13:37] says there's ages but before they said
[1:13:40] oh good good I think you've got the
[1:13:44] increase he goes they thought it was the
[1:13:56] end time they thought he was coming
[1:13:58] right then but he says putting the ages
[1:14:05] yes Ephesians 3 verse 21
[1:14:10] water Jesus for this 321 he says under
[1:14:21] hippie the glory of the church in the
[1:14:23] church by Jesus Christ throughout all
[1:14:25] ages world without end amen
[1:14:30] I would Paul know there was ages to come
[1:14:34] he said he was in the spirit right I
[1:14:41] probably broke down Paul singer the
[1:14:43] other last time one last time those here
[1:14:45] he wrote seven letters to seven churches
[1:14:47] yeah before joy you know to do that he
[1:14:54] also had the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:14:57] just like time and he talked about what
[1:15:01] ages to come you know what the answer
[1:15:04] lies right here second Corinthians
[1:15:06] twelve this morning
[1:15:10] here's how he knew this - yes Amen yeah
[1:15:16] second Corinthians 12 verse one he says
[1:15:22] it is not expedient for me doubtless to
[1:15:25] glory I will come to visions and
[1:15:28] revelations of the Lord he says I do a
[1:15:31] man look how humble this man is a
[1:15:33] prophet in third person he says whether
[1:15:51] in the body I cannot tell or whether out
[1:15:54] of the body I cannot shout Noah such a
[1:15:56] one caught up into the third heaven what
[1:16:01] did he see he was in the spirit catching
[1:16:06] these revelations just like God he says
[1:16:09] and I knew such a man whether in the
[1:16:11] body or out of body I cannot tell he
[1:16:14] says God knoweth how that he caught was
[1:16:17] caught up
[1:16:32] he was he saw all these mystery
[1:18:01] yeah
[1:18:17] one thing I like gone 21 then Peter
[1:18:24] turns us about she's the disciple whom
[1:18:26] Jesus loved following which will also
[1:18:28] lead on his breast at sufferance ignored
[1:18:30] what is he that betrayeth which is he
[1:18:32] that betrayeth II Peter seeing he am
[1:18:34] saith the Lord Jesus Lord what shall
[1:18:38] this man do jesus answered him if I will
[1:18:43] that he tarry till i come wasn't did
[1:18:44] they follow now me I Jesus said he said
[1:18:51] he will see that coming Laurie says
[1:18:52] he'll not pass he says until he sees he
[1:18:55] will tarry till i think of god that's a
[1:18:59] direct prophecy of the bright we will be
[1:19:03] here 20 that's right
[1:19:07] price was already setting the stage for
[1:19:12] st. Paul first Thessalonians okay he
[1:19:14] says what he says that the seven
[1:19:25] churches support the candlestick why
[1:19:27] it's so important in in Matthew 13 and
[1:19:30] your pastors in a wonderful video on
[1:19:32] this he says that there are seven
[1:19:35] parables right which is actually in four
[1:19:39] represents what the seven churches in
[1:19:46] Matthew 13 it has the best description
[1:19:49] of all those parents but if you go to
[1:19:52] the Book of Ruth as and Jesus is going
[1:19:57] through the seventh or the own or
[1:19:59] through the parables well look what
[1:20:01] takes place before he starts going
[1:20:03] through these parables in Luke 8 verse 4
[1:20:09] pieces and when there was much people
[1:20:11] gathered
[1:20:11] together and were come out of every city
[1:20:15] he's he's faked by a parallel what he
[1:20:19] sees in type they represented the seven
[1:20:22] pair of the seven cities Gentile
[1:20:26] churches because then he goes into these
[1:20:29] things they came out of what in other
[1:20:31] words every Church age heard these 7
[1:20:34] parables because it was written down
[1:20:35] because they were to read these things
[1:20:38] he said they crowd up every city now
[1:20:40] does that is this kind of lined up look
[1:20:43] at their cities then in Luke 1st chapter
[1:20:45] 8 verse 16 now he goes what he's no man
[1:20:49] when he has like the candle comes it
[1:20:51] with the best which was right to the
[1:20:52] camps he started he was cities it's the
[1:20:54] parable that goes right to the
[1:20:55] candlestick right he says according to
[1:20:59] read it says no decay no secrets they
[1:21:01] have they may enter may season life
[1:21:03] right
[1:21:04] but now as he's going through these
[1:21:06] parables in Matthew 13 after the seventh
[1:21:09] parable in verse 51 Jesus said have you
[1:21:12] understood all these things remember
[1:21:14] Jesus went through all the parables
[1:21:16] right he only explained two of them
[1:21:18] he left the other five uninterpreted in
[1:21:23] Scripture right right now at the end of
[1:21:25] Matthew 13 Jesus the disciples have you
[1:21:30] understood all these things and they
[1:21:33] said to him in verse 15 where they are
[1:21:44] so they said yes Lord I'm gonna be
[1:21:48] proved that can we prove that those
[1:21:49] disciples understood everything jesus
[1:21:52] said to them in the Feres I scripture
[1:21:55] absolutely in mark chapter 4 verse 33
[1:22:01] and many such parables fakey the word
[1:22:03] out of them and as they were able to
[1:22:06] hear it he says but without a parable
[1:22:08] about it he said he says family fake-out
[1:22:11] unto them and when they were alone he
[1:22:13] expounded all things yes sounds like an
[1:22:17] exposition was given to them i was like
[1:22:22] they understood things these parables
[1:22:24] that when
[1:22:25] besides not only did he break down in
[1:22:27] tears and heat and the sword to see what
[1:22:30] he broke down every one of those could
[1:22:35] they lie to Christ and have not call it
[1:22:36] out every time someone Peter spoke
[1:22:38] something crazy to Christ he spoke it
[1:22:40] out
[1:22:41] he said the understanding a men broke it
[1:22:47] down now
[1:22:50] absolutely and disciples came and said
[1:22:55] there why speakest Allan two parables
[1:22:57] and he said because it is given unto you
[1:22:59] to know the mysteries of the kingdom but
[1:23:03] to them it is not given these mysteries
[1:23:07] this word of God is so precious that God
[1:23:10] gave that to us any sentence holding for
[1:23:13] specified the a man horn now here's that
[1:23:18] you're going to go into this no study
[1:23:19] here trying to build a little foundation
[1:23:20] in visions of God I want to show this
[1:23:23] here by the grace of God we have to keep
[1:23:28] our spiritual thinking camps in so
[1:23:30] before I go in this I go through moments
[1:23:31] - there's 28 if you can catch the
[1:23:34] revelation here if you get into the
[1:23:35] spine set yours it's going to boat by
[1:23:37] the grace of God I'm gonna bring this
[1:23:38] out
[1:23:39] Romans tumors 28 or he is not a Jew
[1:23:42] which is one outwardly he says neither
[1:23:46] is that circumcision which is the hour
[1:23:48] of rest but he is a Jew which is one
[1:23:51] inwardly right the circumcision
[1:23:55] and circumcision is that of the heart in
[1:23:57] the spirit and not of the letter things
[1:24:00] about how many Jews we have everything
[1:24:02] amen all right here we've got our
[1:24:24] spiritual Israel unlike a higher grade
[1:24:27] up yes sir whose praise is not a man but
[1:24:32] a dog correct yes I want to show you
[1:24:35] this hidden right here let's go to
[1:24:38] Joshua
[1:24:39] remember Joshua Pellicer pieces right
[1:24:42] one of the same spiritual revelations
[1:24:47] lot of things st. Paul saw that are the
[1:24:50] Old Testament a lot of things that st.
[1:24:51] John saw the Old Testament but here's
[1:24:54] the shadow a type of it yes Joshua 18
[1:24:57] and the whole congregation of the
[1:25:01] trailer is are assembled together at
[1:25:03] Shiloh which is tranquil appease and set
[1:25:06] up the tabernacle of the congregation
[1:25:08] there and the land was suit subdued
[1:25:10] before them remember for years they
[1:25:14] walked in the movie tired weary they had
[1:25:18] to let the old fighters die out that
[1:25:21] manna was sent to what to try to examine
[1:25:24] to move them yes saints of God the same
[1:25:28] thing has happened to this message
[1:25:29] they've sat under the Word of God from
[1:25:32] what all these years and this manna is
[1:25:35] proving out this revelation is proving
[1:25:37] out we had a division of the church and
[1:25:53] the Bible says he falls he said that
[1:25:56] whether there's divisions don't be Paris
[1:25:59] right he says and whether it be Harris
[1:26:02] he says he says there's gonna move on to
[1:26:05] that further down the road further in
[1:26:08] the spirit more more into that
[1:26:10] Antichrist spirit so wherever there's a
[1:26:13] division if I'm separating is this
[1:26:15] person will be a heresy vines up this
[1:26:17] principle is excellent fight that's
[1:26:20] right that's right they came down
[1:26:22] exactly exactly just like that okay now
[1:26:28] look at verse 2 and they remained among
[1:26:34] the children is no seven tribes would
[1:26:38] not get receive their we're going to do
[1:26:43] now they cross over into the promised
[1:26:46] land
[1:26:46] this is what a type of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:49] which is a type of the
[1:26:52] changes absolutely yes yes you think
[1:26:57] when they first went in the promised
[1:26:58] land that they that they got it no it
[1:27:01] was starting at Ephesus look at the
[1:27:04] power at the beginning but Lyon
[1:27:08] anointing was on Peter and Paul
[1:27:11] emanating distinct or the devil's
[1:27:13] Kingdom up look at Joshua right at the
[1:27:15] beginning he told the Sun to standstill
[1:27:17] Jericho fell right away but as they
[1:27:20] continue about things dropped off but at
[1:27:26] the time when they could take the land
[1:27:28] seven tribes of the children of Israel
[1:27:30] and not yet to see their Hareton saints
[1:27:33] of God and I can't wear cheatin date
[1:27:35] seven changes all right right seven
[1:28:05] tribes not receive their inheritance
[1:28:07] verse three in Joshua or type foot for
[1:28:09] the grandson of type of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:13] senator how are you we got ourselves
[1:28:42] we're living so far beyond our under our
[1:28:47] privileges right when's the last time
[1:28:50] you spoke and something took place I'm
[1:28:54] working at a big theater when about a
[1:28:57] year ago and a bird had flown down the
[1:29:00] other spheres have high ceilings a bird
[1:29:02] was flying around he couldn't get out
[1:29:03] they flew around for almost two or three
[1:29:06] and finally I was brought up to the to
[1:29:07] the to the Pope to the stage area and
[1:29:11] that burden flown down now under the
[1:29:13] stage area it goes straight up for about
[1:29:15] 80 feet because they had all the stuff
[1:29:16] for the theater curtains and things you
[1:29:18] can drop and props and all those things
[1:29:20] and the burger was way up there and I
[1:29:22] said bird all you got to do is fly down
[1:29:25] and go through that overhead door right
[1:29:26] there and it wasn't two minutes hey my
[1:29:32] motive objective was to save the birds
[1:29:33] life thank you lord
[1:29:42] first for give you up from what you
[1:29:46] three men or each tribe
[1:29:49] you said 21 men out each I'm seven and I
[1:29:52] will send them and they shall rise and
[1:29:54] go through the land and describe and
[1:29:56] according to the inheritance of them and
[1:29:59] they shall come unto me again this is
[1:30:02] Old Testament type show and they shall
[1:30:04] divide it into seven arms he says he
[1:30:15] says Judah show abided their coos on the
[1:30:17] south and on the coast and the house of
[1:30:19] Joseph shall find the coos on the north
[1:30:21] he shall therefore describe the land
[1:30:25] into seven parts and bring the
[1:30:27] description hither to me and I make a
[1:30:31] splash for you here before the Lord of
[1:30:34] thought right he said it was a Levites
[1:30:36] have no part of the priesthood of the
[1:30:38] Lord is their inheritance breeze begun
[1:30:40] and he's our portion as well that's
[1:30:42] right because the process of what the
[1:30:44] Levites were televised he says he and
[1:30:47] GAD and Reuben and half the tribe of
[1:30:50] manasseh have received their inheritance
[1:30:52] beyond Jordan on the east which Moses
[1:30:54] and servant of Lord entered and the men
[1:30:56] arose and went away three men from each
[1:30:59] tribe and Joshua charged them and they
[1:31:03] went into the land saying go and walk
[1:31:05] through this land walk through these
[1:31:08] seven Church ages he says and describe
[1:31:13] it and come up to me again that I may
[1:31:14] cast knives before you in the Lord
[1:31:16] November everyone the Prophet said he's
[1:31:18] a Joshua he says
[1:31:19] no way he's this with the divine
[1:31:21] inspiration right
[1:31:24] and it was a Holy Ghost he had the
[1:31:26] signified it was the signification of
[1:31:28] the prophecy it was a prophecy Attic of
[1:31:30] the past yes verse 9 and the men went
[1:31:36] past to the land and described it by our
[1:31:45] Pergamus of my thyroid Sardis
[1:31:48] Philadelphia legacy and described by
[1:31:54] cities into seven parts in a whoa oh my
[1:31:58] what if this was prophesied because
[1:32:01] remember these were described they were
[1:32:05] broke down specifically in detail what
[1:32:08] hill this is and where that River flows
[1:32:10] here in the and the bluffs over here
[1:32:13] that flats over here on the mountain
[1:32:14] over there and this over here that
[1:32:16] cities here that broke it down into
[1:32:18] seven cities into a book it came again
[1:32:20] unto Joshua to the hose China when that
[1:32:25] book came up all right now it's time to
[1:32:30] place you hey who's gonna get of those
[1:32:38] I've been trying right that's right
[1:32:40] let's go there let's go to Josh one
[1:32:50] Enterprise a lot of nuggets in here I
[1:32:54] haven't gotten that football last 1:18
[1:33:05] he starts dividing up Benjamin comes up
[1:33:10] to the first Lots in verse 11 but all
[1:33:14] these have names and their names have
[1:33:15] meetings but I couldn't put together yet
[1:33:18] something then now in verse 19 he starts
[1:33:24] the second law came to Simeon and on and
[1:33:27] on and on and on down and notice
[1:33:31] Joshua 19 verse 40 and the seventh lot
[1:33:40] came out for the drive of the children
[1:33:42] of Dan according to their families a
[1:33:44] member of three men from each tribe were
[1:33:47] sent right yes
[1:33:49] remember this is seven cities in among
[1:33:51] correct how many people wrote
[1:33:55] revelations came from God the angel John
[1:34:02] Wayne how many put people wrote this
[1:34:06] because Christ the angel yeah yeah he
[1:34:20] says now look at the importance of the
[1:34:22] book the revelation of Jesus Christ 1960
[1:34:24] this morning I am starting the first
[1:34:25] chapter revelation the book of
[1:34:26] Revelation and Revelation is set of
[1:34:29] three parts the first three chapters
[1:34:30] what we dealing with these these eight
[1:34:32] days when one church age will take us a
[1:34:34] month but what have to hit the high
[1:34:36] places we call it so Abby's preaching
[1:34:39] these the church age is 1960 says he's
[1:34:42] only hitting the high places he says
[1:34:45] every call it when you get the book
[1:34:48] it'll be written out in more detail
[1:34:51] right very detailed and specific written
[1:34:56] book right yes just by reading
[1:34:58] revelations two and three what are
[1:35:00] specifically the deeds in it later
[1:35:02] can you name them there are three major
[1:35:05] routes of God and with these are deeds
[1:35:12] doctor and indeed the doctor regulations
[1:35:15] was spoken up but the brief
[1:35:19] or unspoken actions there's three of
[1:35:23] them they were laid by acting well it
[1:35:26] does maybe something but how we gonna
[1:35:30] know if we didn't have boss right he
[1:35:35] doesn't even really break it out in the
[1:35:37] surface what the specific three outward
[1:35:42] visual manifestations are movements of
[1:35:46] nikolaeva
[1:35:50] Amen or absolutely
[1:35:53] what else was revealed in here and not
[1:35:57] in the sermon Matthew 13 and you're this
[1:36:01] man 13 verse 24 thrown off Nuggets by
[1:36:11] the grace of God Matthew 13 yes Matthew
[1:36:17] 13:24
[1:36:19] another parent will be put forth of them
[1:36:21] saying the kingdom of heaven is like in
[1:36:23] the man which sowed good seed in his
[1:36:24] field right verse 25 but while men slept
[1:36:32] hey my first one the message I wrote
[1:36:35] this down some fairy when I first won
[1:36:38] the message there to teach me the
[1:36:39] message it said okay teach me serpent
[1:36:42] seed said when men slept okay obviously
[1:36:45] well this could have been the instance
[1:36:47] this serpent that's snuck into
[1:36:50] but Adam asleep well you're on the side
[1:36:55] and that's what gave the sermon space
[1:36:58] that's what if my hard times come and
[1:37:02] that just doesn't make sense right now
[1:37:05] the Bible was written specifically for
[1:37:07] the safe but wow man
[1:37:10] what man a man this isn't now in the
[1:37:16] beginning of the church's book when the
[1:37:18] profits going through the original sin
[1:37:21] he's dealing with the original sin and
[1:37:23] he hits Matthew 13 he says and he's
[1:37:26] reading this parable and he said this is
[1:37:28] a perfect description according what
[1:37:30] took place he says
[1:37:32] right Genesis 3 but as I'm reading
[1:37:40] further the church's book there's always
[1:37:42] these little nuggets yeah cuz it says
[1:37:45] man but wow man snack Adam no what's the
[1:37:52] titles but how does he start every
[1:37:54] parallel Kingdom of Heaven the kingdom
[1:37:59] of heaven
[1:38:00] yes the King I have what was what was
[1:38:04] John's message gotta come up with poppin
[1:38:06] locust eat honey don't you thought he
[1:38:09] said he said behold the Lord the King
[1:38:12] right I'm gonna set up the bruising jobs
[1:38:15] off the sea Jesus picks up the exact
[1:38:17] same message he says the kingdom of
[1:38:19] heaven is at hand
[1:38:20] then as he sent as 12 as I belong to my
[1:38:22] duty says the kingdom of heaven is at
[1:38:24] hand he said later on he says what the
[1:38:27] kingdom the kingdom of heaven is the
[1:38:32] Holy Ghost yes
[1:38:34] amen the kingdom of heaven now let me
[1:38:37] read the resume
[1:38:43] yes sure I found this well that's fun
[1:38:47] what does that mean he says now please
[1:38:51] just be careful actually this would have
[1:38:53] happy 13 Matthew 13 Matthew 13 and we'll
[1:39:01] go to verse hope this is okay yes 36 but
[1:39:12] let's go to verse 30
[1:39:13] let's go 36 and we'll show you what is
[1:39:19] centered
[1:39:20] let's say and I'll show you the
[1:39:22] provinces misnomer he said then Jesus
[1:39:25] sent the multitudes away and went to the
[1:39:27] house and his light was keeping him
[1:39:28] saying declare unto us the parable of
[1:39:30] the tares of the field what he's
[1:39:31] expounding these things right and he
[1:39:33] answered some of them
[1:39:34] Jesus shows the good seed is the son of
[1:39:37] man he's hopeful he says the field is a
[1:39:39] worm right the kingdom of heaven is
[1:39:45] likened unto
[1:39:46] you know what heaven is like unto you
[1:39:47] but look what he says in the resume now
[1:39:50] please let us be careful here this
[1:39:52] message to the Angel of the Church was
[1:39:54] an emphasis is not a message to the
[1:39:56] actual local competing church it is a
[1:39:59] message to the aged and at that age
[1:40:01] handed he's doing what emphasis he says
[1:40:07] and in that age the age of the message
[1:40:10] that he's had the seed of truth in that
[1:40:13] aged Ephesian age had the seed of truth
[1:40:15] and the seed of error exactly set forth
[1:40:19] according to the parallel movie to tears
[1:40:21] right and then he says something so
[1:40:23] spectacular the church ages is the fee
[1:40:30] yes a man does now he switches the word
[1:40:33] world that Christ said he said it's
[1:40:35] actually changes you and as I read that
[1:40:40] I said what did he say at the revelation
[1:40:46] go put wild mountain slept found Ben's
[1:40:50] neck while men slept then the evil Kenan
[1:40:57] yes yes and a nice as a fire come up to
[1:41:00] Palm to Peter comes in.they Paul ganda
[1:41:31] divine one has so much done right is
[1:41:35] anyone and would pull him into the seas
[1:41:37] and I perceived the James ball Peter and
[1:41:40] John were the pillars in truth they run
[1:41:45] this show they had the power of God just
[1:41:49] like Christ
[1:41:59] James was killed always slain right and
[1:42:04] Paul said I after my departing he says
[1:42:08] grievious wolves will come
[1:42:10] Peter said keep these things and
[1:42:12] remember Jesus because I'm about ready
[1:42:14] to go off the scene they're warning that
[1:42:17] when they pass on bad things are coming
[1:42:19] they're coming in the wolves are coming
[1:42:21] and the prophets uneasy that these are
[1:42:23] the glades in these is there's Paul's
[1:42:25] previous school
[1:42:27] all right good when to mend the pillars
[1:42:32] of the church when they started to hang
[1:42:38] on what other wonderful but I was down
[1:43:13] in a certain state a pastor come up here
[1:43:16] he said he went back to them he went
[1:43:20] back to the parallels Matthew 13 he said
[1:43:23] that mustard seed mustard seed he said
[1:43:28] you get that much receiving your face
[1:43:29] they're growing a tree there's actually
[1:43:38] three parts three times he actually
[1:43:40] breaks it down in here they are 70
[1:43:43] senator - and 38 paint them put that on
[1:43:47] that precious number that's 238 he's two
[1:43:51] and 38 and then on 363 he says now the
[1:43:54] moment ago that falls on came into pole
[1:43:57] for Jason and this danger proven mature
[1:44:00] and ripen that that is correct this evil
[1:44:03] spirit of church politically will be
[1:44:05] anybody will be revealing the mustard
[1:44:07] seed that grew into extreme were loud
[1:44:09] we're we're large the fowls of
[1:44:12] the air and her head and her head will
[1:44:15] be Antichrist mr. Griffin only family
[1:44:19] what is this what is the mystery mystery
[1:44:21] uh mustard sequencing the real funny
[1:44:24] find you couldn't confidently get the
[1:44:26] highlights while men slept the mustard
[1:44:33] seed hungry that's right mean something
[1:44:42] we want to stick to them we want to know
[1:44:43] all of the words but the best the best
[1:44:46] of God will reveal to us that's what
[1:44:51] wanna Joshua Joshua 19 and 40 is and the
[1:45:08] 7th Black team up off the tribe of the
[1:45:10] Church of Dan according to their
[1:45:11] families right notice the seventh was
[1:45:15] Dan and if you look at the other seven
[1:45:18] tribes all of the beasts are not knowing
[1:45:37] place these men these are the place
[1:45:39] these tribes where where he was but now
[1:45:58] even though it's Dan it is they equal
[1:46:03] symbol he's on the north side right but
[1:46:06] the Genesis verse 49 ad Jacob's dying
[1:46:12] look how he blessings then ordained
[1:46:20] there's a very powerful thought here
[1:46:24] look how he blesses
[1:46:27] Dennis's 49:16 day and jumpy at one of
[1:46:36] the spies of Israel be a judge but now
[1:46:40] on the side of her 17 days shall be a
[1:46:43] serpent on the way an ad on the path
[1:46:47] that bite at the heels horses heels so
[1:46:50] that his rider will fall back though
[1:46:53] he's a judge and the sermon because of
[1:46:56] twofold nature right thank God verse 18
[1:47:03] says I have waited for thy salvation
[1:47:12] so he said shows he's a judge what that
[1:47:14] he's a serpent correct now and the
[1:47:17] resume the church agency said from our
[1:47:18] studies we have already learned that
[1:47:20] much of the revelation is totally
[1:47:23] misunderstood because why we have not
[1:47:25] formally known that the church spoken of
[1:47:28] and spoken to in this book
[1:47:32] revelations one two or three Jesus does
[1:47:36] not refer to the pure ecclesia the elect
[1:47:39] the body of Christ the bride he says but
[1:47:41] a space for the entire body of people
[1:47:44] who call themselves Christians whether
[1:47:46] they be true or merely not speaking for
[1:47:49] both sets right everyone who claims to
[1:47:52] be a Christian Atlantis yet is in
[1:47:54] Revelation 3 that's right brother yes
[1:47:56] sir
[1:47:56] rich increased with Goods heavy to
[1:47:58] nothing and what even the bride is
[1:48:01] called the dependable he's my brother
[1:48:03] yes sir right so it seemed notice Dan
[1:48:06] he's a type of Laodicean Church age he's
[1:48:08] the seventh but there's two with him
[1:48:19] Lori the shrine Jesus the true the two
[1:48:24] mites are mortified by it
[1:48:25] motivated by two kinds of spirits what
[1:48:28] has a Holy Spirit while the others of
[1:48:29] the Spirit
[1:48:40] 19 verse 47 and the coast now here's
[1:48:47] where I can only go we can only go so
[1:48:49] far I move ahead here because there's a
[1:48:52] whole another section it's a revelation
[1:48:56] because God specifically Sebastian yeah
[1:49:04] you gotta wait up put on the show it's a
[1:49:06] big now in Joshua 1947 and the ghosts of
[1:49:20] the children dan went out to little
[1:49:24] their inheritance was to they didn't get
[1:49:28] all of their here it was too little well
[1:49:32] then now let's say that part why was it
[1:49:36] too little in judges 134 don't you
[1:49:54] wanted verse 34 and the amorite or the
[1:50:01] children dan into the mountain well they
[1:50:03] would not suffer them to come down to
[1:50:05] the back the Emirates still run the show
[1:50:09] over that area and then one of that was
[1:50:13] their inheritance but because they were
[1:50:14] not able to subdue and defeat the
[1:50:17] ammonites em rights which is your pastor
[1:50:20] broke down through the scripture is what
[1:50:21] the lust of the flesh the fresh kicks
[1:50:25] huh so when Laodicea the very desires of
[1:50:27] your flesh will overcome you and you'll
[1:50:30] not be able to get in my goodness priest
[1:50:33] was gonna defeat of nothing he says and
[1:50:35] they were giants historian cities with
[1:50:38] giants this is a deal of the fight
[1:50:44] against in the back to giant Joshua 1947
[1:50:48] and the coast of the children Dan
[1:50:52] without too little for them there
[1:50:54] or that sure of danwon up to fight
[1:50:55] against fashion which is the highest of
[1:51:00] all the Seas I believe is the Hyatt one
[1:51:03] of the highest and the Norden of the
[1:51:04] cities in Israel are they to go okay so
[1:51:08] one of the fight against nation can took
[1:51:10] it and smote it with the edge of the
