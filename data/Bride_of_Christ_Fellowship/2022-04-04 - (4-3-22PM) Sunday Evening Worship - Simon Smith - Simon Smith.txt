[Applause] [Music] praise god everything went red praise god [Music] maybe seated here let's take a few prayer requests as at this moment we have the same request we don't have anything new um i do want to give a further announcement on this morning uh with the columbus meetings the brother uh sarah serge sergei okay i keep saying sarah j that's not sarah j it's sergey he also invited me to preach um chris i'm sorry christmas easter morning forgive me give me a moment here settled my mind down a little bit after all that shouting and praising god um so anyways but it's tentative so that's why i didn't say anything on the text now i got brother simon he he would tentatively cover for me on easter morning if i preach in columbus on easter morning but it's tentative because they they share a church with a baptist church they're they're a small message church he said we have from 10 to 15 people so they have a very small church down there we thought we had a small brother and we were small at the beginning but we've grown out of that by god's grace but um very small church so it's tentative so at this time it's just a saturday night you're all welcome down to come saturday night but i have brother simon as my backup here on easter morning uh if there's if he indeed wants me to if they can get that church and rent out that church for the the sunday morning but the baptist pastor would have to give up this the service so i doubt it but i do have brother simon on standby so that's just one announcement okay so it's going to be a very busy week and i'll probably cancel that wednesday service before the good friday so let's see that would be the 13th so april 13th i'll cancel the wednesday night service we can have good friday service all together the church we'll take communion on friday night saturday night we'd be in columbus and then i may or may not be in columbus on saturday morning but i'll definitely be here saturday afternoon because i sent out those uh postcards and i gave we have they sent us some extra ones so i gave some to austin and um but they meant if you like some ones that give out let me know like we have we i think we got like 10 extra ones or something like that uh because we have sent out 5 000 and maybe somebody will come you know last time we sent out 2 500 and two people came so maybe we'll send out five thousand maybe five people will come so i don't know the all the math behind that it's all about god's calling right we heard that this morning it's all god's calling come and see many are called if you were chosen but just want to give the people a chance so that would be the only announcement i believe by god's grace anybody else have a uh any other new requests tonight or any song specials tonight virtue do you have requests okay thank you i'm sorry making noise with this unspoken for virtue yes definitely pray for that anyone else have a request or a song special all right well let's bow our heads here we'll take that before the lord let's remember the sick we prayed for five sick people this morning let's remember them in prayer as well also bang bang vang your family lost your great-grandmother

enjoyed this morning let's thank the lord for that praise god what a beautiful message these messages keep getting better and better all the time gooder and gooder all the time no really it is a reality it is a reality brother brian hawkins was here last week just a phenomenal day and today is fixing up to be the same amen just we just thank god for the holy spirit for like brother amen i'm talking about just humble men humble men that's we want to be humble christians so let's sing humble thyself in the sight of the lord as our brother comes i want to humble themselves and say lord let your will be done not my will be done hallelujah let's sing this song and we'll worship the lord as our brother comes to minister god's word as jesus said the meek shall inherit the earth praise god the meek the humble [Music] humble thyself in the sight of the lord [Music] humble thyself in the love of the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] of the lord [Music] he will lift you up [Music] [Applause] [Music] humble thyself in the love of the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] you up up into heaven [Music] and he will lift higher and he lifts you up in the rapture [Music] second service it's second service is kind of rough sometimes can't be brother bang's oldest or bang's boy there kicking up i mean that's sometimes how i feel trying to get up to work i don't want to go i just want to do what i want to do you got to fight past that so um anyhow all's well here we just want to be a blessing to the bride of jesus christ and i've been in your seat shoes many many times and it's like every second shift second second second services sometimes that sleepy spirit now i got i got a gift i might sleep anytime almost anywhere any situation of college we had uh the dorms we had fire alarms and this that i'd sleep right through them that r.a would have to go in there and wake me up and say you're gonna die i'm like i didn't even know the place is on fire well i didn't hear anything i'm gone so um let's turn to matthew 25. now if you start feeling tired just stand up and just wave your arms a little bit and just just do what you got to do and do the little circles this way big circles and little calisthenics and bodily exercise profit little but it profits a little bit even especially at service you know so sometimes i'm struggling on a wednesday i just got done working and i'm getting older now i can't work like i used to and i get tired you know sometimes if i get an opportunity i'll take a nap after work for 45 minutes you know half an hour an hour or whatever let's get tired and that that seems to help but wednesday night at service there i'll stand in the back you know and not sit beside my wife and she just has to take it and she's okay with it so uh let's get into the word of god here in matthew 25 uh verse one matthew 25 verse 1 says then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and then let's turn to revelations 3 and 19. revelations 3 and 19. now notice what the bible says here as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold i stand at the door and knock if any man hear my voice and open the door i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me so say a word of prayer dearly father lord jesus so we come before your humble lord reverent lord and you know we're so grateful lord for your word lord we thank you for this revelation and we thank you for your long-suffering lord not only just to the world lord but to us lord for the bible says even the righteous are scarcely saved god lord your bride there's so few that make it lord there's so few are going to make it into the rapture god and lord god is we see time dwelling down lord your prophet said though that it would come down to a razor's edge honing god lord that's how few there would be lord just little sets of believers lord here and there and oh god we know there's a separation coming even within the message lord uh for things are going to happen lord lord god we certainly love you lord bless the people god lord maybe humble ourselves god lord as the song said lord you know we want to lift you up god lord higher and higher lord god our lord jesus lord just anoint us all lord hear god lord and we rebuke any tiredness god lord in the name of jesus christ or even upon myself god over the lord may we find that holy ghost got that anointing that gives us strength and energy and power lord and the spirit's always willing lord uh but the body is the weak and lord we certainly love you bless the people god in the name of jesus christ amen you may have your seats here so uh as far as like picking and choosing a a topic here you know i just had like really two in my satchel i brought two messages with me my satchel that was it so i'm not captain inspiration i i just can't pick up a thought and just close everything down and go but i just i'm a teacher uh maybe i guess if i would have to describe myself i have to study it i have to look at it i have to uh see how how much time has given me how to place things and and those sort of things as well and uh first service there at the end brother uh um man i'm missing you missing your name yeah austin there it is ah thank you sorry like i said i forget why i taught it pretty thoroughly and now i have vindicated what i've taught [Laughter] i battle the old memory so brother austin ah now your witness is to see how see how rough that is [Laughter] well that's high you're 44 no i've been like that since i was born [Laughter] yeah that's uh i got issues but one day that spirit realm that memory is going to be just fine and we'll know all things that will always know them so i'm looking for i'll tell you why everybody's like oh i want to do this and i'll do that in the millennium i just want to be able to remember stuff i mean that would be fantastic and never forget it and just always be there that be right on tip of my tongue it'll just fly off and i'm like memory amazing so uh anyhow uh brother austin here i wanna i wanna i wanna bring this little quote here for you by god's grace you know just encouragement and and the prophet god said he says i can go on record for this tonight he says if any people will take the right mental attitude towards any divine promise what's the greatest divine promise to receive the baptism of the holy ghost if you've been baptized in his precious name he says if you he says yeah that will god will ever made and claim it as yours so you just gotta go keep con confessing it claiming it believing it and say i've already got it i've already got the promise i've did what was required the bible says uh that god gives those uh the holy ghost to those that obey him amen absolutely he will god will bring it to pass if you take the right mental right attitude towards it knowing that if god said it so the promise is yours and it's your personal property the very minute you receive it that way so listen it's like a know that you know that you're going to receive it uh if i was short on money or uh uh or however or needed this or i lack that or however if i just look in the word of god said and the jesus christ is the is the healer he's a great physician once i catch the revelation that scripture by his stripes are healed i've already got it i know i'm healed it's going to come so um he says if the very many receive that way then it has to come to pass so it's it's coming so as we read in the scripture there i want to emphasize notice here where uh this is very very familiar we've all been looked at these scriptures many many times wise and foolish virgin and this is really at this point maybe some of us still battle you know while i'm a judas or this or that you know and we've got the castes of aside right now we are interested in one thing that's becoming the bride of christ we can't even let that enter into our minds judas no no we have received the word of god we love it we we're trying to live by the very best we can i'll tell you if there's one person that knows me it's my wife knows my weaknesses my sometimes i cut up some sometimes i cut up more than sometimes and then she knows everything about me uh failures weaknesses i mean she just knows it all so i can't i can't put a show on in front of her she knows me she knows if i'm up here speaking truth or not or however and those sort of things uh about my life her life our life uh those sort of things so here uh we want to go into these things as far as uh uh the wise and foolish um and just show you here now we we we then we of course we brought this scripture here and um now notice here he god is addressing that church a jesus he says uh he said there there i know that works and he had a heart hole he's dealing with the lukewarmness he's doing he's dealing with he says because thou sayest i am rich and increased with goods and need of nothing he's going into the condition of the church and then he shows you the uh uh the he gives you the symptoms of the problem and then he gives you the the problem to the solution or the solution to the problem is like counseling to buy me gold tried in the fire and he shows you how to get fixed up he shows you he says come to me he says i'll fix you up and this and this and this and and i'm going to deal with you i'm going to get you in position and then he says he says uh and and he says in this age all he brings forth is rebuke and chastisement that's how because if we sit the longer we sit in luxury in the ease of this the weaker we get if i don't eat at 10 a.m in the morning i'm gonna get cranky if i don't have my paycheck sitting right there on a wednesday afternoon before i go to work if i'm it's not there i am that's it i'm gonna call my boss if i don't have this certain thing kind of way happen at this certain time moment then i'm gonna i'm gonna voice my opinion and everything has to be our way or my way and it's gotta work out this way saints of god we need to ask and lay before the lord said lord what is your will for our lives right amen sure so he brings all this rep repentance uh rebuke chastisement then now notice he says he's at the door now of the church he's at this church age and the bible says he's knocking but notice one thing he says i behold i stand the door and knock if any man hear my voice so we have to recognize that voice okay so uh i guess this afternoon here we want to get into this and i would like to teach on this the difference between a wife uh and a virgin or a clean living sister i'll say like that it's like this a difference between a wife and a virgin absolutely so let me say it like this i kind of started out this way maybe at home and i can only like really pick on one sister here and that's lydia sister lydia how old are you now sister 17 years old now i i'm looking at sister lydia i'm looking to the right of her looking to the left of her and i see no man i don't see a man there i don't see a husband tells me and i have previous knowledge of this as well but she's not married [Laughter] and she's not courting anyone no one's courting her i'll say like that that i know of my dress is gonna be jess is probably gonna be staring me down with those laser eyes right now as i'm speaking these things okay and mama too maybe we'll see mama eagles feathers are a little roughing up and that's okay because i'm in control right now so we're gonna use we're gonna we're gonna talk about sister lydia today for tonight a little bit okay is that all right now it's sister lydia's life right now she's 17 years old and she's been brought up by wonderful parents that have taught her the word of god and if there is a group of parents that have taught the word of god it would be these two very few have went this far and have been this diligent they've exceeded my own mother of course my mom was by herself which is quite a bit rougher but nonetheless they've done a fantastic job reading the bible i believe brother jesse has read the bible with them once twice maybe a couple times going through it at night going through those things and however so sister lydia has been raised up in the admonition of the lord of course sister keisha is right next that as well sure um coming up as well right behind her uh and right now she's at a point where she's looking forward to 18. she's looking forward to 19 20. and as your as their parents are maybe praying that the god would withhold a husband for a little time when they gather some time with her as she gets older and get to go from parents to friends almost you know it's got to because it's got a transition to something like that lydia may land a fantastic job somewhere instead of sorting apples she'll be sorting applications she'll be sorting stocks and bonds she'll be sorting uh tax returns who knows what she's going to be doing and she'll maybe she'll make a little extra money and and if she would make choices uh and right choices financial decisions and really uh plan her life to continue on and be prosperous even without maybe let's say a husband uh she would now have decisions she could make she would have opportunities now as she's been raised up in the admonition of the lord and she no doubt will continue in that way because we see that she loves the lord she she's faithful to church she's playing piano she's doing those things she i believe that she has a relationship with jesus christ and she wants to read his word she wants to pray she wants to continue on and no doubt deep within her heart and even maybe as is pressing his way out she desires a godly husband okay so but until that moment takes place she is on she she actually has a free wheel okay so as she gets older let's say she makes a little money she gets her her car going uh uh as most younger sister have the beater honda or the beater foreign car or something like some kind of a beater car with a i just drove emma's car the other day and the handle doesn't hardly work the other one's missing it and then she hit something and the the side windshield mirrors off and emma jane i remember those beater car days and at that point where she's unmarried she's free to do what she will she could technically call on her cell phone and call up emma jane salmi and ali pick up one of her sisters and say hey let's go on a little road trip for a day or two and then they'll get in the car and they'll ride and they they can go and see sights they could literally pack up those sisters and they could take a little trip and if they wanted to hit a gas station and get some snacks they could get some snacks if they wanted to eat over a cracker barrel they could eat a cracker barrel and then they could drive to let's say a big uh a meeting in in a message a good sermon you know a three-day sermon they could go there they'd get a hotel and the three three four sisters could uh could stay together they could have a good time and laugh and talk till midnight and all those sort of things they because they would be free yes sir and as they would go to the service they could hear the preaching and they could they say amen and praise god and those sort of things at the end of the service there would be like the little time where they would fellowship and go to eat crumpets and and sip on teas and coffees and all that after a service maybe a saturday night you know how they have where they little dainties to eat or whatever and and the sisters will be standing there and there'd be a group of brothers over there and the sister would be giggling and laughing to themselves and however and the brothers would be over there talking okay now i'm just bringing this as an example okay and let's say one man or a group of brothers get the courage which is very highly unlikely but let's say a young group of brothers gets some courage and goes up to that group of sisters and they say well hello sister god bless you and there's like four or five brothers right there young man hot wives and each one of those brothers young men shake sister lina's hand said god bless you god bless you sister god bless you sister god bless you sister now when she first hear those voices neither one of them rings a bell they're brand new that man's voice that young man's voice doesn't mean any more to me than that other man's voice over there and there's beginning four or five brothers could shake her hand and not one of their voices rings anything there's no meaning to them right okay and then later on let's say she meets someone else and he wants to quarter and brother jesse does the checklist five port five-point interview process with multiple visitations multiple spy cameras all kinds of things going on here calls in the uncle for reinforcements not trying to report just and then let's say they continue on and they court for months and months his voice becomes very familiar now they could not be even engaged yet and as they're just courting sister lydia can still go around and take emma jane salmi and occasion the other sisters they can go off here and there and they can just travel and do whatever they want to do within their means yes and if lydia is still court being courted and she'd be at these other services and young men would come up and say well hello sister that's she would recognize right now that's not the voice of the one quoting her right amen now let's continue on here now in first corinthians 6 and 17 but he that is joined unto the lord is one spirit notice what he the prophet the prophet god hear he says he says he says flee fornication every sin that a man doeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which you have of god and ye are not of your own so here if you have been bought by the holy ghost this temple this very body we live in is not even our own but it's been purchased it's been now it now and and there was the the one that's bought it now wants to live in it is i purchased that house i purchased this temple and i want to live in it because now it's mine i have rice to it now would you yield your rights to let him come and live within his own temple the one to be purchased absolutely we want to do that lord god help me lord to yield and to make sure this temple is fit and worthy to be lived in by the god almighty amen absolutely he requires he wants you not he doesn't want to you to produce the word he wants you to believe the word that was brought to you amen absolutely now he says for you borrow the price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are gods absolutely and now uh dealing with our young sister here she has kept herself and and she lives accordingly and she's done her very best uh from what her her was it her sister or her brother i can't remember his acacia or brother uh malachi said that her work environment's kinda rough welcome to the real world it's not easy when you hear swear words all day filth all day long that's all i hear every other i mean literally it's that bad every other word now is literally i mean let's be honest but even through that filth she is keeping herself clean amen sure now in romans 6 he says he says let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body they shall not obey it in the lust thereof neither yield you neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteous unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead in your memories are instruments of righteousness god for sin shall not have dominion over you if you're not under the law but under grace right now so here's scriptures dealing with how we're to keep our vessels how we're to keep our lifestyles clean and pure and and those sort of things absolutely sure but now notice if we go back to matthew 25 you see the wise and foolish virgins now remember they're both called virgin because what they are clean living they've been not they have uh uh kept themselves from the the i was like this the uh from committing spiritual adultery spiritual fornication those sort of things they are actually virgins they kept themselves what to the word of god they lived according to what the word of god and so much so that god himself even called them pure even called them clean that was his witness that was his discernment of these two sets of people they were both clean absolutely sure he says uh he says neither ye yield as yourselves as instruments and rises under sin but yield yourselves into god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under law but under grace absolutely so what if we yield sin shall not have dominion over you now notice i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice both sets wise and foolish were doing this they yielded their bodies as living sacrifice holy acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service it's a reasonable in other words we owe this to god it's reasonable it's without a shadow of a doubt there's no question on how we're to keep ourselves and how to live do we fail absolutely sure but we've got to do why because god look at all that jesus christ did for us literally he has done it all if i could i mean i i am so ashamed of my failures uh i mean i'll say this for the amount of revelation we have for the amount of understanding that's been given to us in this day and then still to see myself fail and fail and continue to falter and to to come up short it's so hard i i and you just kind of want to be rough on yourself you know not like to the catholic mode but just like come on inside you want to encourage yourself get your god spanks me i speak myself [Laughter] oh my he says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god absolutely sure now let's continue on here now part of this study here um just seeing a couple things pop up uh you know saint paul said in corinthians he says he says i've heard rumors of this and i've heard from the house of chloe this is going on okay he's heard these things and he said i'm pretty sure they're true so i've heard some things coming through the old grapevine in the message there as you would maybe once say and i wanted to maybe address these things all right so now notice i love this in first thessalonians verse let's say this verse 16. he says rejoice evermore pray without ceasing and in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesying prove all things hold fast to that which is good abstain from the appearance of evil and the very god of peace sanctify you wholly he says and and i pray notice he says i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless under the coming of the lord jesus christ and that's exactly right there the condition what of wise foolish or why isn't forced virgins except obviously the first virgin didn't have the soul realm correctly uh but the rest the body and the salt the body and the spirit were right on they have kept themselves kept the spiritual round clean keeping these thoughts getting all these these black birds from landing and planting and building nests up here and you know the battles amen absolutely it's not easy he says faithful he says it is that uh faithful is he that called you who also will do it brethren pray for us greet all the brethren with the holy kiss i charge you by the lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren so here this was commanded to this this this study right here or this this uh letter to be read to them why it was that important that they had to know these things to keep themselves prove all things pray without ceasing all those things then of course what's else is written i mean in the uh the rapture's in there too as well so he said so these things were what for our edification for what our knowledge for our revelation sure and it was it was made plain absolutely great plainness of speech right here yeah sure now let's continue on here he says now i would have you i would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried cared for the things that belong to the lord how he may play how many how he may please the lord so notice saint paul is is dealing with these he's dealing with the married and he's dealing with the unmarried so we want to find the difference here now notice he's dealing with the he's dealing with i'll say this natural life right now notice he says to the unmarried to the unmarried right now sister lydia can give herself to fasting is it hard to fast when she sees all those apple pies and those peach pies probably not but after a couple more months she'll probably be sick of them it won't be any any issue fasting in front of it and then what she can give herself to attention lord she's like dad give me the church keys i'm going to go a little early and pray at the altar oh my and then she might get here she says pray but let me enter into the presence of the lord first and get the tambourine and play the piano and bring the presence of god down say send me a minstrel let me get the presence of god then i'm in the presence of god there now notice she's single she can do these things there's no headship over outside her father well keep that always but then then of course uh but as far as having a husband she doesn't her only voice right now is her papa and so then she then the the presence of god is there then she kneels down the altar and starts praying and just praising god and preparing this place for service and she can do that as a single sister and she can do that continually as long as she be single but notice how the bible says in verse 33 but he that is married cares for the things that are of the world right brothers we've got to make some money we have to be faithful to our job we have a profession we have to provide now that we're married we have to provide for the wife she's got to eat she needs a new skirt she wants new uh uh what does my wife just bought some more bed sheets because ours are cheap and they're already bad so she wants new beds she say yeah go ahead buy them she bought them absolutely but now we i have to come well this is this is coming up this is we got to we got a plan we got to deal with the world we got to get everything the natural consumes us a lot of times right uh and that's how how he may please his wife correct amen and now the married sisters now they're bringing up children they're caring about bills and they're they're caring about this say hi what are we what are we fixing for supper what are we there's cares of the life of our sister lydia if she gets on her own she gets off work she stops grab some chick-fil-a or some chipotle real fast cause why is she single why not goes grabs her chick-fil-a eats it at home boom she's done now she can do whatever she wants if she wants to start painting a class she can start doing painting classes if she wants to do his arts and crafts if she wants to start an etsy shop she can do whatever she wants right sure i don't notice here but i would have you without carefulness no no absolutely now notice in verse 34 he says now there is a difference between a wife he says and a virgin the unmarried woman careth for the things of the lord that she may be holy both in body and spirit but she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband right now notice saint paul is dealing with this in the natural realm as far as looking at the natural life but i want you to think this morning or this afternoon i'll say it like that think of this in the spiritual yes amen think of this in the spiritual those that have the holy ghost we are now consumed on how we will please the lord jesus christ those that are without the holy ghost they can still serve the lord but now notice they are they they don't have a real headship that's right okay notice they still care for the lord but notice that lord is not a husband yet there's a difference very good amen there's a big difference i heard i heard a minister preach one time he said he says the name of god is the lord jesus christ some people just want jesus jehovah's savior some just want to be saved and then live any kind of life they want but when jesus the savior jehovah lord becomes your savior he wants to be lord as well and what is that lord that's moving now into what a a romantic headship he wants to be you want your husband absolutely and then he wants that then they want the christ the anointing to be with it as well he want all that he is he is the lord he is your savior he is the anointing he is your all-in-all amen sure sure absolutely so what's the one difference really and unto the woman he said i will greatly multiply thy sorrow thy conception and sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband notice god had to place it that when a sister gets married what her desire will be to her husband amen sure now notice he's dealing with what one of his godly seed sure and he shall what rule over thee so i'll say this when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost there is a spiritual connection that takes place and that spiritual connection that takes place makes you want and has it gives you the desire to serve the lord jesus christ amen amen and i told the the our home church there if you've ever watched elon musk you know who elon musk is he's that uh super smart uh car slash space slash doing everything guy right solar plant oh roof guy right does it all i mean he like does everything and if you ever watch one of his interviews like elon and they'll just ask him like a random question elon what do you think about forests and if you watch any questions he'll be like this and he'll take about 10 or 15 seconds 20. he won't say anything and then boom he gives his answer and people wonder why does he why elon why do you do that he said every question asked i want to answer it and base my answer on whether this will get me to mars faster or not he can ask you can ask about anything but his whole focus is getting to people on mars so if he answers this way will this impact or change my way or my my whole goal is to get to mars will this i want to answer this the way so this this goal right here gets done faster good so his whole mind is because he's like pretty much married to mars okay now if we could get that way in the christian faith [Applause] good so brother vang you're gonna have another child brother bangs can sit there like this and in his mind she'll be like is this going to help me get in the rapture or not well one more child hinder me from making this rapture you know i'm saying just an incarnate way but anyway we are in our decisions in life is this because each one of us has decisions every day we get asked this we got there comes a situation how do i react to this the main focus is this going to help me the way i react is is this going to help me make the rapture or not is this going to hinder my spiritual life or not is this going to keep the anointing away from me or not yeah absolutely why because you're married and you want to please your husband amen see that that is the mindset of a married woman sometimes i'll be working at like 1 30 and i'm just jammed i'm just hanging off a piece of piper in a liftlessness and my wife's calling me i'm like come on and she was like hey what do we want for eating time like i'm like why now i keep thinking and i'm thinking she needs to know okay i'm thinking wow she has no idea what i'm doing right now but she so cares she wants things to be just right when i get home so that very small tiny i would consider tiny decision or tiny action compared to where i'm at 30 foot in the air hanging off this and trying to weld and that was that's a big thing for her yes amen because she wants to know what i what would make me happy and i've always got to keep that in mind [Laughter] what is sweet honey over there [Laughter] brother has been there yeah that's right sisters all as well hey man absolutely so you see what i'm saying i mean single sister you want to stand here remember call your husband's at 3 35 [Laughter] as soon as i get off work unless it's emergency now now notice the headship a married holy ghost child woman to christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind of god doctrine by the slight of men and cunning crafts whereby they lie away to deceive but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him all things which is the head even christ so who if we are baptized with the holy ghost are we the body of jesus christ absolutely are we then now the now who is our if we are the body who's the head jesus christ where's the thoughts coming where's the thinking come from christ now remember it's like this how much connection would there be if i could take my head off well i'll say like this you would wonder if i said in my mouth which is connecting my head which is my head i'm going to move my left arm and i go like this he's like man this guy's got major issues because the head wants to move the left arm and here my right arm moves it shows there's what a disconnect something's not exactly wired correctly it's not having the right signal sent but the body's missing the signals of what the head's desiring amen see so then it's especially like that in the spiritual yes when god wants something to take place and he's tries to convey the message and gets that signal down to the body is the body reacting correctly or is that signal being jammed somewhere is that signal not reaching the body because the body should be doing the very will of jesus christ if it's the head amen if we have that connection with god we should be doing exactly what he wants god help us absolutely sure now notice here in ephesians 5 and 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own sends husbands to the lord for the husband is the head of the wife now notice even as christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body once again christ is the head of the body absolutely the natural wives have natural husbands and the wife must react and do things accordingly sure and notice no man ever yet hateth his own flesh he says but nourishes it and cherishes that it even as the lord the church he says for we are members of his body look at we are direct we are one we are one with christ if we have the baptism holy ghost we're just coming brother if we are one we are connected with christ absolutely we are one but then now as this thing takes place we've got to get in tune with the connection or the moving of or the mind of christ he says we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh now notice this is a great mystery by but i speak concerning christ and the church now notice how powerful is it now notice he says remember in corinthians there it says he says uh the virgin is concerned about how he she pleases the lord and while the married one is concerned about how she pleases her husband and if you look here a beautiful example this is in first peter three and six and it talks about how he's dealing with holy women and sisters of this and sisters that notice even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord see so even your husband can become lord to you and absolutely that's exactly what it is the the virgin knows them as christ as lord but the wife knows him as lord and husband absolutely whose daughters you are he says as long as you do well and be and are not afraid with any amazement now there's a couple things i want to because i i've heard some things through the grapevine and now notice this in hosea 11 10 they shall walk after the lord he shall roar like a lion when he shall roar then the children shall tremble from the west what's the interpretation is brother i don't know all i know is the lions roaring and lions roar for certain things sometimes for hunger sometimes to show territory and this time looks like for judgment for thus saith the lord for thus hath the lord spoken unto me like as the lion and the young lion roaring on his prey notice he's coming to get he's going to destroy he says when a multitude of shepherds is called forth against him he will not be afraid of their voices see there is pastors coming that are going to dis discredit god almighty nora base himself from the noise there there's there are some pastors that's going to blast christ they're saying he's not coming and we can do whatever we want and debase god and god says there's coming to a point where he's going to say that's enough and now notice he says nor basis of self from the noise of them so shall the lord of hosts come down to fight from mount zion who is zion we are the bride is zion absolutely see so he's going to what there's going to be people coming to fight god in other words they're fighting the bride but when you fight the bride you're fighting god he says for lo i begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name and should be uh utterly unpunished shall ye shall not be unpunished for i call upon a sword upon all the inhabitants of the land or the earth sorry saith the lord of hosts therefore prophesy thou against them all these words and say unto them the lord shall roar from on high and utter his voice from his holy habitation he shall mightily roar out his habitation upon his habitation he shall give a shout as they that tread the graves against all the inhabitants of the earth sounds like the coming of the lord and notice he's roaring out he's bringing forth notice it's the lion of the tribe of judah he's coming to destroy now notice here in verse 14 12 let them give glory unto the lord and declare his praise in the islands the lord shall go forth as a mighty man he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war he's going to stir up jealousy why did why let me say this why the pharisees said she wanted to kill jesus christ when he came the first time of jealousy because god was blessing his works he was god was performing works through jesus christ god was performing all these works he was performing all these works in in his original church science ones are miracles that were untold he was performing these and what they the devil got jealous and anointed his children to start destroying that's right right but notice this time god's going to do it again i wonder if this has to do with the greater works that last anointing that anointing comes down upon his bride and she does the greater works exploits the bible says and what the entire world or those that can see it will become jealous and he shall cry a roar he shall prevail against his enemies he says i have long time holding my peace i have been still and refrain myself now while i cry like a travailing woman i would destroy and devour once he's done playing games so now notice and here's where i'm kind of wondering about i'm worried i'm a little concerned about the message believers we've got to because we know the seven thunders are coming as far as the classes clarity and what they will produce but notice this is the voice of jesus christ will they be able to recognize what these are if this is the voice of christ then his wife will be able to discern these and call them out for what they are and it will move them into action so notice here read verse one and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven so here's christ coming down clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the sun and his feet pillars of fire and he held in his little hand an open book and he set his right foot upon the scene his left put a foot upon the earth and notice this angel this christ this is the the anointed one cried with a loud voice as when a son a lion roarth and when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices when he cried seven thunders under the voices and when the seven thunders and other voices i was about to write but now notice what takes place the one that was descending blasts them out but notice a voice from heaven says unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders under and write them out notice the father says hold back the son of god's the blasting is out and yet it's not time he says write them now seal those things up which the seventh one is under and write them out not and the angel which i which i saw stand upon the scene upon the earth lifted up his hands in heaven square by those things and moving on now so notice there's two voices right there there's the voice of the son of god and then the voice from heaven and then now notice in verse seven there's another voice but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he declared unto his servants the prophets right yes sure and now notice and the voice which i heard from heaven directly after this we're supposed to hear another voice from heaven spake unto me again and said go take that little book which is open in the hand of angel what this book had the seven seals ripped off of it and now that book is delivered down and what the the holy ghost tells them go take this book right so now they've taken this book and now he's supposed to eat it and now he's supposed to not only eat it but then what prophesy again correct but to do all those things they have to be able to recognize the voice you know my pastor brother cam just got a book in the mail that said the seven thunders were the seven church ages or something of that fact and guess what he had quotes he had quotes but does that ring true through the scripture is that what the spirit is trying to say through that or is that the prophet just saying it in a kind of a cloudy kind of way or was he thinking something else was he not quite clear on what he was trying to say right or maybe the prophet was just presuming right or just guessing he did a lot of that sure yeah absolutely so now moving on here and i was thinking of these things uh and i kept thinking it just blows me away the the level of deception and and i know i focus on this a lot because i don't want to be deceived and now i'm going to go like am i going to go every night i'm going to be like am i going to try and work no i'm going to be like lord but my mind is focused on it's like lord show me what i need to see and i have to put faith in what i have asked of him that he is going to reveal everything we need so we will not be deceived but it's going to be by the holy ghost the holy ghost is going to drop these revelations he's going to show you certain quotes that have never been touched before he's going to show you things that have never been brought this way in the scripture he's going to show you types in the old testament that are going to ring true absolutely that's why these seals are so important you can you can see it all the way through let me say this i was talking brother randy he said brother you can see that first the four horse riders are writing revelations 4. i'm sorry genesis 4 we see cain go up with his false worship which was a false doctrine abel had the right one because there's twins there's the white horse rider trying to show abel who went up the worship first came trying to show abel how to worship abel says abel goes and worships this way brings the lamb slays the blood and the blood is indicated that's the first word right what's the next horse rider the red horse rider who kills who kane then kills abel right there's your tourist writers what's the what's the black horse rider it is a a blackness but it's also a famine and notice the judgment that comes on cane upon the ground fruits will not grow any more on the ground for you anymore there's what a family right there black horse rider now it's the pale horse is what we know the name of the pale horse it's death and the bible says what god gave cain a mark spiritual death and then he what he then and the brother man said what he said this was his fatal mistake he left the presence of god there's your four horse riders right there in genesis 4. what because now the seals are opened and we can see them and trace them absolutely amen sure but reign is a revelator now and i kept thinking about these false now notice dealing with the false now how do they get so anointed right because there's anointed ones you see him i mean beth just visited upc church anointed holy ghost falls over there but they still believe in tongues is the evidence of the holy ghost they can't get past it that's an absolute to them now notice what he says he says the same holy spirit that anoints the church that gives them desire to save souls that gives them power to perform miracles notice what the holy ghost does the holy ghost what makes you want to win souls it wants to do and show that jesus christ is alive but notice he says it falls on the just the unjust just the same as the just the very same spirit he says now you can't make it any other way understand matthew 24 24 he said there shall fall rise false christ false anointing to us anointed with the genuine thing but be false prophets of it false teachers of it right what would make a man want to be a false teacher of something that's truth the anointing he can have in his heart a belief a false belief but because he can the presence of god will fall down on him he believes he's correct because he's seeing results we're seeing the moving of the spirit he's seeing what signs wonders and miracles and what the people are catching fire and yet he's teaching something false i kept thinking lord how does this really really work what would make a man want to be a false preacher that's something of something that's true now we can get down to the mark of the beast a few minutes and you'll see its denomination remember that seed line is all i'll say like this i taught this a while back in at home this nature we battle you know this guy simon smith this thing is full of problems it gets think think of this in your mind adam and eve in the garden adam and eve just happy everything is wonderful and let's say like this adam and eve were walking and a big wind because the prince of the power of the air is there a big wind lord tornado comes into the garden of eden and eve's like what is this head what is this adam's like no fear he's like peace be still and the tornado subsides do you think adam went stupid wind there was nothing haughty about adam his nature now notice there's two natures here we're dealing with two natures there's the natures of the sons and daughters of god and there's the natures of the serpent seed animal nature though they're falling watch animal nature you know what i don't like being unhappy because that was not my original nature adam and eve walk in the garden and they haven't went this path in the garden a little bit and a tree had grown up past and blocked one of the the pathway kinda and it's in their way and eve's like adam how are we gonna get past this thing how are we gonna get the best tree adam goes tree be plucked up and move over there and boom the tree sucks up tippy toes on his roots like a ballerina sucks back in the ground up here right adam and eve go through the little path and this and that do you think adam went i've never liked that tree that tree had it out for me i knew it did last time i went through here that tree was giving me a bad eye there was absolutely no evil thought against that tree ever and you think adam said i'm gonna watch i'm gonna keep my eye on that tree from now on that was not his nature see all these things you're battling you're battling serpent nature let me prove it to you in genesis 4 as soon as cain left the garden we see kane what building cities creating civilization then we see a man take two wives polygamy in a lust problem right then we see what people building uh working with metal and all those sort of things and then we see the same man who had plugged me he went into what he became a serial killer he killed two men look at all this things look at what these animal nature did it produced all this wickedness good very good let's get out of that genealogy genesis 5 and we look through and this is the generations of adam and adam begot seth and seth was a warmonger doesn't say that that's right you don't see anything negative in that seed line it was that pure still this thing we're battling here is serpent nature bitterness evil thoughts you name it that paul saint paul said would not inherit the kingdom of god that is serpent well now we're stuck with this nature that's why jesus had to send the holy ghost because we're stuck with it now we it's not it's not christ's fault did he set the stage for it he's at the stage four but we he gave us free moral agency and he allowed adam and eve to fall into this and now that it was their choice we're stuck with it but god gave a way out and that is what be those that are led by the spear are the sons and daughters of god amen and if you live by the spirit and walk by the spirit you'll not fulfill the lust of the flesh amen sure so now let's continue on here hope that was all right now now the prophet of god breaks this down pretty easy as dealing with the the the false anointed and you know how simply he taught it he taught it with the orange tree and he was down in florida there or whatever and he went over this man's house whatever there's this tree and it had tangelos it had lemons it had grapefruit and then it had oranges and brother bran was like what kind of tree is this what's going on here and he started asking question after question he said look at this he says oh i guess it was in arizona he says he had a citrus farm and he had a tree there that was on or and it was an orange tree and yet it was bearing grapefruits lemons tangerines tangerines and i forget how many different fruits on that tree and brother man says what kind of tree is that this is a tremendous teaching in a moment of the holy ghost for the prophet and he said the tree itself is an orange tree the brotherhood rams confounded what why does it got grape grapefruits and lemons on it and this man gave a tremendous statement he said they're grafted into it this is brand new to brother graham he's like what he said they're grafted into it i said why is it god he says well i see he says i said now next year when the the tree comes forth another crop of fruit he says which they were all ripe and about the same time i said then will it bring forth all together oranges so now he had a question he said he's seeing all these different fruits all these different branches in the same tree and he says now like okay all these fruits are going to go because they pass the tree is going to be bare they said but now when life comes back in the spring are all these gonna have oranges on it and the man said no sir every grafted branch will bring forth of its kind you mean the lamb and vine will bring forth the lemon out of the orange tree he said yes sir do you see why we're seeing what we're seeing in the message whatever someone is is what they will produce when i was a pentecostal i was trying to witness to bring people in to be a assemblies of god because that's that's what i was i was part of that branch at the time i'd say like that and a baptist when he witnesses to you he's gonna try and make you a baptist and i just met an american baptist it's another whole branch i never heard of it before it's called the american baptist and i got to witness to him and he was like i don't know about that once we get over there we'll figure it all out i'm sure i'm like no i'm telling you i can shoot he's like well from my teaching i've studied i've studied a lot but it's probably not what you're saying but okay all right that's what that branch says he says will the will the grapefruit bring forth grapefruit out of the orange tree he said yes sir that's the nature of the branch that's grafted into it i said praise be to god what he said the great the guy is like what do you mean he says one more question the prophet the prophet is spiritual here he's looking at things like evan the revelation is breaking and he says one more question now will that oris tree ever bring forth oranges again he says when it puts forth another branch hey man why do you think we're seeing so much division in this message i'm going to tell you how this works at least from what my best understanding the message has went out into the world the gospel net and it's called this and it's called that and god allows their eyes to let them see the good word and taste it of the spirit and all those things they come in and if they are not from the original spoken word in genesis 1 if they were not a son of god originally and they entered they and they grabbed themselves in with the message and start taking message principles which is gospel and catch the revelation and they have a gift of faith and they pray and fast and as the angel will tell the prophet if you'd be more sincere you'll see greater things so something false can come in and copy the exact same technology i'll say like that spiritual technology on how to bring the spirit down no notice balaam said let me get in the spirit first let me let's worship correctly let's get into the worship first he knew the proper approach to bringing god down but because he was the wrong kind of a branch still incorporated because the bible said jesus will not not he'd not turn anyone away anyone that wants to give god glory anyone wants to serve god god is going to let him serve him but it depends on what they are is what they'll bring forth that's why we're seeing so many deeds interesting stuff and that holy ghost is still going to anoint them good and bad because what they've grabbed they've they're they're pulling from this they still believe the same promises i'm healed and yet not even not even orange tree i can do this and i can do that i can speak to the mountain it's still not orange because what they've caught the concepts they caught the revelation of it saint paul said though i know all mysteries they'll have all faith and move mountains and do this and that he says if you were not sealed with the if you're not married to the ones he says it'll profit you nothing amen sure right wow i'm already an hour i'm sorry no and here's here's what i'm i want to hit some things here now uh i want to touch touch this real quick dealing with here one little change this and this uh and i was dealing with false apostles here in the first church age um but we're going to skip that i want to do this so here the prophet says what is the new birth then you'd say well brother branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you amen see not to join a church you shook a shook a hand you've done something different you set a creed you promise to live by a code of rules but christ the bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anyone says what takes place it's christ it's jesus christ pastor priest whatever it might be it's christ in you that is the revelation that the church was built upon absolutely now notice and i'm going to hit something here because this was recently mentioned to a brother in our assembly but i'm going to read this quote here first by god's grace now notice what is it it's christ being revealed he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself see that's god's purpose for jesus christ was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his own laws and fulfill his law by death and christ god died in flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the word of god now that's the headship believes what the body will believe the word of god if they if the head has been connected to the body it literally only now that body's head is the head and that's christ and the thought that's going this body and this has been said is the scripture and the revelation of what this is yes and why are people so the quotes are the absolute the message of the absolute what is the message where's the clarity on that maybe we could do it i'm sure jess or brother jose's even got that figured out already now notice believe only in the word of god and not swap it like eve did for intellectual conceptions of man you see that's christ's idea that's god's ideal he says what the new birth reveals this you know what i like doing i like going the message software and say uh new birth reveals or the new birth does this the new birth does that what does the new birth do it points to god almighty it points to his word if the bible in the holy ghost are not your absolute have you been born again i'll say it like that yes sure now notice then the body bride must follow the hand why because she's married for it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery it's impossible not for it to go oh how it's part of god's mystery how god revealed himself here and raise it up by the word so he reveals the church and raises up by the same word it's a part of his threefold mystery now notice as the head was took from the grave as the head christ was took from the grave so must the body follow him back to eden where the head the family head of the family the man the bridegroom the bride being the body of the bridegroom must follow the follow the bride because that's the hand sure wherever christ is is where the body will follow that's why he's a rapture because of the if the headship comes down he's looking for his body his bride and then when the headship goes up the body goes with him sure and the head head is revealed and come back with eternal life and the head must follow that because it is husband and wife again amen and as long as you're pregnant with the same word which is his body took his body become in him and you took the word not a creed the word oh my sure now notice therefore the body those born again those in the bride cannot recognize he said don't fail this the body therefore cannot recognize any other headship than the word because the head is connected with the body and the head is the word it's the same word one headship therefore denominations holy fathers and everything else is dead dung i'll say this organization there is one headship that's christ the body recognizes one thing the word absolutely now i'm going to share this real quick with you guys i know it's where a second shift or second shift second service and i'm already getting a little long here okay now now notice this dealing with the deeds of nicotines you know how these deeds and the doctrine started it first become a saying okay in other words a minister would say such and such and this man right here would hear it and be like and he would start repeating it and then another man would hear and starts repeating it so something was just said to our brother in our church and the brother was talking to another brother and they said well our church teaches this and the brother said well that's probably because they they are addicted to pornography you know why because that laity member heard a minister say that so in other words if you disagree with something a another minister or a big-name minister or however if you disagree with some of his beliefs it's probably because you have a pornography issue and that saying now is going out into the message because it was just said to one of our brothers in the church these guys have gifts beyond profit level or just as profit level do they or are they starting a saying to demonize things you see where this thing's going i i was just blown away when this brother told me this and then it becomes a doctrine didn't they didn't they not say jesus was beelzebub he said thou has to devil and jesus said i don't have a devil you have a devil but notice who throws the first stone see sure now i want to rehash this real quick because i taught this already here once but i want to rehash this and i want if there's anything in this this little study here at the end i want you to remember this because remember there's a difference between a virgin and the bride and the married and the married will only the married this is her absolute right and we've hit this before i'm gonna show it to you okay remember this brother van can can you read this one and two go ahead and read that out loud thank you brother so these men these pharisees and sadducees are watching christ they're watching jesus and they're his disciples and they notice one thing why are they not washing their hands before they eat remember this before they eat bread why don't they wash their hands why is this in the bible why is this god anointed matthew to record this in the scripture why remember this thank you brother because of this was going on at that time at that time of christ's appearance the words of the scribes this was the saying this was the mentality this was the anointing of their spirit on that day the words of the scribes are lovely beyond the words of the law for the words of the law are weighty and light there's some deep things and there's some but all the words of the scribes are all weighty was pastored so and so when brother so-and-so preached this and this and this i'm like yeah wasn't the word you should have heard him say listen i'm like yeah but isn't the word i have to try every word anyone's i have to i have to try my own sermons i have to teach my own bible studies i have to try it by the word of god my own thoughts right now there's two men who had great schools at that time in the time of christ or just before hillel and shamiyah the two heads of their famous schools and other ancient doctors from whom were delivered by one to another certain rules and laws of their own devisings which had no foundations in the world of god or the word of god so there's two great men who had teaching schools in the jewish era pre-christ or however and they started making their own doctrines 20 years ago behind the pulpit this was a no-no you know my pastor but i can before he's a minute before he's even ministering he went to work one day worked a 10-hour day and we lived an hour and 10 minutes away from church in lima but the cam got in his car probably dressed while he drove which he could do i couldn't do that putting on the tie just driving like you know he gets down there and they call him the lead songs he's like okay brother and he's going up and he's prepping to sing and a brother comes back there and says brother what's what's this right here kim's like what do you mean he goes don't you know you got a bad spirit if you don't shave before you sing songs kim's like i just worked a 10 hour day i drove an hour and 10 minutes i got dressed and you're worried about this i didn't have time to shave you know he didn't say that but what they're making up these doctrines they're saying he had a bad spirit because he had facial hair because he didn't have time to shave before service and yet he drove sacrificed all this to drive down there to lead songs to enter into worship because he's got a voice but they demonize it now everybody in the message is growing a beard preaching and our god almighty jesus christ came down with a beard absolutely yeah amen certain rules and laws of their own devising which had no foundation in the word of god and of these scribes and pharisees were more tenacious than of the scriptures they would hold faster to these main man man-made doctrines than to the word of god watch watch what's coming in the message i'm worried i'm a little nervous know then that the words of the scribes are more lovely than the words of the law now notice this other guy says if a man does not read he only transgresses the an affirmative but if he transgresses the words of the school of this big man he is guilty of death you see anything outside of the word of god brings forth death it doesn't matter because he hath broken down a hedge and his servant shall bite him puts a curse on him if you do not follow this man's teachings on how he's this or this and however this and this he says he says not only are you worthy of death there's a curse coming something's going to bite you and puts it on the people and they believe it he says the words of law having them both prohibition and permission some of them light some of the heavy but the words of the scribes are all them heavy sure my weightier are the words of the elders in the words of the prophets my goodness sure notice my son attended the words of the scribes more than to the words of the law for in the words of law are affirmatives of negatives but the words of the scribes everyone that transgressed the words of the scribes is guilty of death so now they're going as far farther than that and notice it comes down to this whoever eats bread without washing your hands is if you lay with a makes it completely equal you become a whoremonger if you didn't wash your hands they're putting an evil spirit on you they're judging you by something that they have made a doctrine he that blesses food with defiled hands is guilty of death whosoever does not wash his hands as as is as as is fitting although he is punished above he is punished below they've already put him in hell didn't wash your hands obviously you're a serpent seed you can't even be saved carry on this was the condition of what laodicea in the old testament laodicea our age in the old testament what more is coming and to fright people in observant to this tradition they talk of shibta a sort of an evil spirit that hurts such as eat as eat without washing their hands in other words if you do not wash your hands an evil spirit called this guy is going to get you they say he sits upon their hands and upon their bread and leaves something behind which is very dangerous it just becomes from one insanity to the next now notice this isn't the true church of god this is not moloch's temple or the philistine temple or dagon's temple this is in the the very god of jerusalem's temple his teachers his ministers and it is recorded to the praise of our akbar this guy this man that he chose rather to die notice how this false doctrine was so instilled that he would rather die than to transgress this tradition for being in prison and in want of water what little he had he washed his hands with it instead of drinking it and he died because of dehydration because he would rather hold to a tradition he would die the natural death eliezer ben what's his name was excommuted for excommunicated for despising the tradition concerning washing of hands and when he died the sanhedrin sent and put a great stone upon his coffin to show that he had died in this excommunication and then they stoned his coffin for not washing his hands before he ate amen now let's stay on the stand i mean i'm an hour and 20. god have mercy you guys are pray for me you guys are great god bless you stan let's go like this a little bit are we okay all right there you go amen praise the lord let's just finish here right here what is the difference between a virgin and a wife he said what was left over don't let us stay till morning to come into another age burn it with fire be destroyed that age you're living in the message of this age he says what is this message of this age got to do it's got to be brought out of the scriptures and vindicated and proved by god that it's god doing so then you either receive it receive that or reject it he said that's eternal life the leadership of the holy ghost leading his church do you know when he preaches this is the second sermon before the prophet left the second service before the second the last sermon that god would allow this man to preach the prophet of the hour and he said this message has to be vindicated through the scriptures and you know what who's going to get us there are the quotes going to get us there did you know there was a speaking in tongues and interpretation in this sermon and i listened to part of it guess what this interpretation was the second last sermon this is an evil hour this is an evil day and thou shalt not be deceived listen push play and obey don't say that holy ghost does not say that holy ghost says study every message know it by the back of your hand look at every quote my prophet said he does not say that notice what the holy ghost says and thou shalt be led by my spirit and be conformed to my word and be and behold i will keep thee and preserve thee and shall keep thee true and i shall revive thee unto the day of light of my coming r it is all the working of the holy spirit amen all right one last one last scripture here i was gonna actually dramatize this but we're not gonna do this eliezer comes down finds the great rebecca right at least come on girl let's go mama mama and brother like no she's staying 10 more days hey ladies come on man i'm already blessed let me go let my people go and finally say well let rebecca come and say what she wants to say what's her choice she says i'm going elijah's like right on let's go they all get up on their camels start rolling and eliezer from the time they leave to the time they get there is telling her about isaac you know isaac's isaac's three persons she's like really i'm marrying three and he's like yeah the next day ellie easter's like no isaac's one person what you just said the other day that no he's one she's like okay he's a nice guy he's a nice guy then eliza starts breaking other things you know ellie easier is like you know when you become pregnant and and you receive his seed you know it's two different things and she's like huh and then right before they get done off these camels elusive is like okay when you get pregnant you've actually received the seed it's one of the same she's like that's what i thought okay praise the lord and so she's hearing all these things and she's like well he's a really really good brother really great guy i'm so great so grateful that isaac abraham would send him to me to get him but at the end of the ride but at the end of the ride after all this talk about isaac and this and this and this in verse 64 rebecca lifted up her eyes and when she saw isaac she lighted off the camel she jumped off the camel and she said unto a servant what man is this that walketh in the field to meet us and the servant said it is my master therefore she took a veil and covered herself yes when she first got on the ride to go to meet isaac did she veil herself before eliezer no why what does the veil prove the veil proves that she's moving now into headship a woman cannot do what she wants the bible says a woman is a byproduct of man she's not even in the original creation or that's exactly right she was took from the man she was a man with both feminists now no listen did you notice when rebecca was went to meet isaac when she jumped off the camel she veiled her face why she was coming to her head they don't know it they have to do it anyhow did you notice a woman when she gets married she puts a veil over her face why she's coming to her head and the church the church being the bride should veil herself to any creed cover her headship to any creed she's coming to her head the word christ is the word and he is the head amen one last here notice what john the baptist said he that is the bride he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom who's that brother branham who's that john the baptist who's that eliezer the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice that my joy therefore is fulfilled amen praise be to god brother branham is not our head christ jesus christ is our head the holy ghost is our headship amen so that is the difference that is the difference a married woman those of the holy ghost can recognize the voice of the holy ghost speaking amen amen the foolish virgin may be able to recognize it maybe not distinguish it yes but one thing for certain that bride knows her husband knows who he is knows his actions knows his nature knows his word and what that husband even alerts her of things god loves it that we're finite he loves it that we don't know everything why because when we hear something there should be a little ringer going and that's him saying honey no no no wrong man wrong word absolutely amen let's just bow our heads amen sorry my goodness i'm like brother cam i'm sorry that's powerheads dearly father lord jesus lord we love you we thank you for your grace and mercy lord what a long-suffering bride you have here lord just let this little man hear lord try to expound what you gave him lord god and
