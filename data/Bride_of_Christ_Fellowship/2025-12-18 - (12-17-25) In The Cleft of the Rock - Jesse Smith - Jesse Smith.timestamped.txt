[0:00] Trying to watch the time here by God's
[0:01] grace 30.
[0:11] Exodus 33:21.
[0:16] You know, I I preached on uh Moses
[0:21] uh being in the cliff of the rock in the
[0:24] Corinthians series, but I never felt
[0:26] like I got down to the bottom of it of
[0:28] it. Um, so tonight I'm going to look at
[0:30] that. Tonight I'd like to preach on In
[0:32] the Clif of the Rock tonight by God's
[0:34] grace. Psalm 33:21.
[0:38] I'll read 21 and 22. Then we can all
[0:40] read 23.
[0:46] The Bible declares, "And the Lord said,
[0:48] Behold, there is a place by me, and thou
[0:50] shalt stand upon a rock. And it shall
[0:54] come to pass while my glory passeth by
[0:56] that I will put thee in a clift of the
[1:00] rock and will cover thee with my hand
[1:03] while I pass by. Let's read verse 23.
[1:05] Ready? One, two, three. And I will take
[1:08] away mine hand, and thou shalt see my
[1:11] back parts, but my face shall not be
[1:14] seen. May God add the blessing to the
[1:17] word. You may be seated by God's grace.
[1:23] So in case I have a few slides here by
[1:24] God's grace. So I just you know want to
[1:27] give a background here before we get to
[1:29] the main part of this in the cleft of
[1:30] the rock. We kind of had this in my
[1:33] notes for a number of weeks here. Just
[1:34] kind of waiting for the right time
[1:35] Chris.
[1:37] Yeah. Yeah.
[1:51] has two. Yeah, you're right. Has two
[1:52] applications because the Bible says
[1:54] we're going to see it now. We look in
[1:55] the face of Jesus Christ. So, the Bible
[1:57] says that in 2 Corinthians 6, but
[1:59] there's another element to it where no
[2:01] man can live in God's presence, right?
[2:04] So, there's there's an element where no
[2:06] human mortal can stand the full power
[2:08] and glory of God. There's two points to
[2:11] that. Yeah. It Yeah, it was showing how
[2:13] we were going to see in in Christ, we
[2:15] were going to see all of God. But then
[2:17] there's another element. Nobody can see
[2:18] God and live. That's still true today.
[2:21] Give two claps. That's a good question.
[2:22] That's a good question. Great question.
[2:24] But excellent. Now, um I'm gonna just
[2:26] background Exodus 33. U you know, up to
[2:29] this point, think of up to this point of
[2:31] Moses's life, he's seen God's power.
[2:34] This I kind of labored on this a little
[2:36] bit when I preached it because he seen
[2:38] the plagues, all the plagues on Egypt.
[2:40] He saw the Red Sea parted.
[2:42] He saw God's authority because he saw
[2:44] God take his finger and write the tables
[2:47] of stone. And then Moses threw them down
[2:49] and broke them because he was so upset
[2:52] with the people. But he saw that he saw
[2:54] God's provision. He saw mana uh fall
[2:57] from heaven. He saw water come out of a
[2:59] rock. He saw God's holiness. He saw the
[3:02] pillar of fire start out before them and
[3:04] then it shifted to the back. Right? He
[3:06] saw they all saw it go. And then he saw
[3:09] God's mercy constantly forgiving Israel.
[3:12] He stood in the gap. Him and Aaron stood
[3:13] in the gap, right? Uh numerous times.
[3:16] But now he wants to know who God truly
[3:18] is, not just what he does. Hallelujah.
[3:22] And so we get this revelation. No matter
[3:24] what miracles we've seen,
[3:27] the workers of iniquity have seen the
[3:29] miracles.
[3:31] &gt;&gt; So in other words, lots of people can
[3:33] see miracles and they still go unchanged
[3:35] in their hearts,
[3:37] &gt;&gt; in their works, because they're workers
[3:39] of iniquity. They just do iniquity
[3:41] disobedience every day. But the real
[3:44] believer, they appreciate all that God
[3:46] does, his power, his word, his
[3:48] authority, his acts, but they also want
[3:50] to know his heart as well.
[3:52] &gt;&gt; And so that's what we see in Moses.
[3:54] Moses had seen everything a man could
[3:57] see. Brother Ram said he spoke uh
[3:59] invisible things into existence, right?
[4:02] But Ram said uh even Jesus didn't do
[4:04] that, right? So God let Moses do these
[4:07] great and mighty works. Now, of course,
[4:09] Moses never raised somebody from the
[4:11] dead like Jesus. So remember, Moses was
[4:13] a type of Christ. Uh Moses said, "God
[4:16] will raise up a prophet likened unto
[4:18] me." And of course, nobody can do
[4:19] greater works than Jesus Christ. But it
[4:21] was Jesus and Moses. Hallelujah.
[4:23] Creating all things. But just to kind of
[4:26] go quickly here, the law was given in
[4:28] Exodus 20-23.
[4:30] Moses partially see God's glory in
[4:33] chapter 24 because he goes up on the
[4:35] mount. He comes down and his face is
[4:36] glowing. So he gets to see partial
[4:39] amounts of God's glory.
[4:42] And then he gives instructions for the
[4:44] tabernacle. I think this is beautiful.
[4:45] God gives his law. And then God says, "I
[4:48] want to live amongst you." Don't you
[4:50] think that's beautiful? He calls them
[4:52] out of Egypt. He says, "Now that you're
[4:53] out here, now you're a priesthood. I
[4:55] want to live with you." Hal and church.
[4:57] God wants to live with you, too. Amen.
[5:00] Hallelujah. Amen. Thank God. And now he
[5:02] tabernacles in us. Amen. Hallelujah.
[5:04] Amazing grace. Amazing grace. And then
[5:08] Israel makes one of their biggest
[5:09] mistakes ever. they uh make a golden
[5:11] calf uh even before the prophet can
[5:14] return with the tables of stone and
[5:16] that's when Moses throws down the tables
[5:19] of stone. Moses intercedes, right? So
[5:22] God doesn't destroy Israel. And that's
[5:24] where we pick up here by God's grace. In
[5:26] verse 12, Moses said unto the people,
[5:28] see that thou sayest unto me, bring up
[5:31] this people, and thou hast not let me
[5:33] know whom thou wil send with me. So
[5:36] Moses says, you've called me out, but
[5:38] you haven't told me who's going with me.
[5:41] Yet hast thou said, I know thee by name,
[5:44] and thou hast found grace in my sight.
[5:47] So you told me you know my name and but
[5:49] I still don't know who's going to go
[5:50] with me. You told me all these things,
[5:52] but I don't know who's going with me.
[5:54] Now therefore, I pray thee, if I found
[5:56] grace in thy sight, show me now thy way,
[5:59] that I may know thee, that I may find
[6:01] grace in thy sight, and consider that
[6:04] this nation is thy people. Hallelujah.
[6:08] And God said, I love what God answers.
[6:10] See, church, if you ask God for
[6:11] something sincere, God will give it to
[6:13] you.
[6:15] Now look, Moses doesn't ask for more
[6:16] miracles, does he? He's seen the
[6:19] miracles. He wants to know who's going
[6:21] with me, God, because I'm going for you.
[6:23] And I need to know that you're going
[6:24] with me or somebody's going with me.
[6:26] Praise God.
[6:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want this mighty God who I've
[6:29] seen all his mighty acts of miracles. I
[6:31] want to know which way is he going,
[6:33] which way does he want me to go, and
[6:34] who's going to go with me? And God
[6:37] answered so sweetly. He said, "My
[6:39] presence shall go with thee, and I will
[6:41] give thee rest." Hallelujah. What a
[6:44] promise. Amen. Hallelujah. God's called
[6:46] me out of Egypt, church. God's called
[6:48] you out of Egypt. God's brought you
[6:50] through the Red Seas of water baptism.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; You've seen God do great things, which
[6:54] are great and mighty things. But we also
[6:57] want God to go with us along the way.
[6:59] Hallelujah.
[7:01] &gt;&gt; So, what a promise. My presence will go
[7:03] with you. And and the Bible says Jesus
[7:06] said, "I'm sending the Holy Ghost." So,
[7:07] my presence, the comforter, will be with
[7:09] you always. So God's comfort is promised
[7:12] to be with us as well. And he said unto
[7:15] him, "If thy presence go not with me," I
[7:17] love these words, "Carry us up, not
[7:20] hence. If you don't go with me, I don't
[7:23] want to go."
[7:24] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, if you don't help me be a
[7:26] pastor, I don't want to be a pastor or
[7:28] father or husband or any teacher,
[7:30] whatever it is. Lord, I only want to do
[7:32] it if you're with me. Praise God.
[7:34] &gt;&gt; If you ask that kind of request, God
[7:36] will be with you. Amen.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; In other words, I don't want to go
[7:39] anywhere. I don't want to do anything. I
[7:41] don't want to make any decisions unless
[7:43] I know God's in that decision.
[7:45] &gt;&gt; For where and shall it be known here
[7:47] that I and thy people have found grace.
[7:49] How's it going to be known? Is it not in
[7:51] that thou goest with us? The only way
[7:54] that this is going to be worth anything
[7:56] is if you go with us. That's the only
[7:58] way we're going to know that we're in
[7:59] the right path is if you show yourself
[8:02] among us.
[8:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[8:03] &gt;&gt; So shall we be separated, I thy people,
[8:05] from all the people that are upon the
[8:07] face of the earth. We're, in other
[8:09] words, we're a small little message
[8:10] group. But as long as you're with us,
[8:11] God, then we're happy being just a small
[8:14] group. Hallelujah. We're just a real
[8:16] small humble little flock. Amen. But as
[8:18] long as God's here, that's all that
[8:20] matters. Hallelujah.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; We know he's not in the Jezebel
[8:23] religion, the Jezebel systems, we know
[8:24] he's not in them. So, he's got to be
[8:26] somewhere. God, be with us. Hallelujah.
[8:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then the Lord said unto Moses,
[8:31] "I will do this thing also that thou
[8:33] hast spoken, for thou hast found grace
[8:36] in my sight, and I know thee by name."
[8:39] Church, God knows your name. God knows
[8:41] the hairs of your head. Hallelujah.
[8:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:44] &gt;&gt; He knows you're rising up and you're
[8:45] laying down. And the thoughts you think
[8:47] are far off before you even get to those
[8:50] thoughts,
[8:51] &gt;&gt; as we saw last week by God's grace.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he said, 'I beseech, in
[8:55] other words, I beg you. I plead with
[8:57] you, show me thy glory. Wasn't the
[8:59] plagues enough glory? Wasn't the Red Sea
[9:02] enough glory? Wasn't the finger of God
[9:04] enough glory? But Moses knows there's
[9:06] something greater than those miracles.
[9:09] Oh my. Hallelujah. Lord, show me
[9:11] something that's greater than the
[9:13] miracles. See, church, if there's a deep
[9:15] call in your soul, there's got to be a
[9:17] deep to respond out somewhere.
[9:19] Hallelujah.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[9:20] &gt;&gt; Somewhere God's got to answer. If
[9:22] there's more of God, there's got to be
[9:24] more of God to be had.
[9:27] &gt;&gt; And so what does God say when he asked
[9:29] for his glory to be seen? I'll make all
[9:32] my goodness. This is the goodness of
[9:34] God. The glory of God is his character
[9:38] as we preached on. And I'll proclaim the
[9:40] name of the Lord before thee. So what is
[9:42] God's glory? His name, his goodness, his
[9:45] character. And I'll be gracious to whom
[9:48] I'll be gracious. and will show mercy um
[9:50] on whom I will show mercy. If God has
[9:53] showed you mercy, you ought to realize
[9:55] that he knows your name. You're a child
[9:58] of God. He's called you out of your
[9:59] sinful lifestyle. And God is going to go
[10:02] with you on this journey.
[10:04] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Thou can not see my face,
[10:07] for there shall no man see me and live."
[10:09] That's the shikina glory, brother.
[10:11] That's the all the power of God. Whereas
[10:12] John almost fell down as dead. That's
[10:14] the power we're talking about.
[10:17] Now remember church, don't forget this.
[10:18] We'll get to this in a moment. It was
[10:20] death for God to pass by Moses in the
[10:23] fullness of his power. Any man would die
[10:26] in the fullness of his power.
[10:28] And the Lord said, "Behold, there's a
[10:30] place by me." Aren't you glad?
[10:32] Hallelujah, church. And thou shalt stand
[10:34] upon a rock. Aren't you glad God's got a
[10:37] place beside him? Amen.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; Remember, John had that place. John
[10:41] leaned upon his bosom. The one whom
[10:43] Jesus loved. [laughter] Hallelujah.
[10:45] Amen. Hallelujah,
[10:47] &gt;&gt; church. We're the one that Jesus loves.
[10:49] Hallelujah.
[10:50] &gt;&gt; We're in a place beside him because we
[10:52] know his heart. We know his word. We've
[10:55] got thus sayaith the Lord.
[10:57] &gt;&gt; Not thus sayith the Catholic Church.
[10:59] &gt;&gt; Or thus sayith the p the Pentecostal
[11:01] church, Jose, right, brother? We got
[11:03] thus sayaith the Lord Jesus Christ.
[11:07] &gt;&gt; So don't see yourself as far away.
[11:09] You've got a place right by God.
[11:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[11:15] and you got a place to stand. And it
[11:18] shall come to pass while my glory passes
[11:20] by that I'll put thee in a cleft of the
[11:22] rock and I will cover thee with my hand
[11:25] while I pass by. Right? Going to cover
[11:27] with his hand. And I will take away my
[11:30] hand, and thou shalt see my back
[11:32] theophony parts,
[11:34] but my face shall not be seen,
[11:38] for no man will see God's face and live.
[11:41] Chapter 34. And the Lord said unto
[11:43] Moses, "He the two tables of stone like
[11:45] unto the first." In other words, do that
[11:47] again because you ruined them.
[11:50] You got to learn this lesson.
[11:53] So he the stones. And I'll write upon
[11:56] these tables the words that were in the
[11:58] first tables which thou breakest. Moses,
[12:00] you broke them. So you got to you got to
[12:03] make up for it and you got to do it
[12:04] again. Church. Any lesson you don't
[12:06] learn, you're going to have to keep
[12:07] going through that lesson until you
[12:09] learn it.
[12:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God's going to make you go
[12:12] through that again. Look, he break it.
[12:14] He threw it down. And God said, "You're
[12:16] going to do it again."
[12:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; But isn't he isn't he still going to see
[12:22] God's glory? Yes. See, we're God's still
[12:25] going to show us his glory, but he's
[12:26] still got to teach us to obey the word
[12:28] of God.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And learn from our mistakes.
[12:33] Don't make the same mistake if you can
[12:35] help it.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; I like this. When are you going to do
[12:38] it, Moses? When are you going to make up
[12:39] for this? You better get ready in the
[12:40] morning.
[12:42] David said, "You'll hear my voice when?"
[12:44] In the morning. Early in the morning,
[12:46] I'll seek you. Seek. Get up early. Pray.
[12:48] Read your Bible. Get on your knees. Go
[12:49] in your prayer closet. And be ready in
[12:51] the morning and come up in the morning
[12:52] under Mount Si. And present thyself. My
[12:55] does that sound familiar? Romans 12.
[12:56] Present yourselves a living sacrifice
[12:58] unto God. And the church said,
[13:01] "Hallelujah. In the morning, and that's
[13:04] when I'll transform your mind." Oh,
[13:05] there it is. Amen. I didn't really see
[13:06] it till now. Hallelujah. God's going to
[13:08] transform Moses's mind. Hallelujah. So
[13:11] he can know the GLORY OF GOD. HE HAS TO
[13:13] SEE God's glory. God said, "Get up
[13:14] early. I'll show you my glory."
[13:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:19] And then present yourself to me in the
[13:21] top of the mountain. I'm going to give
[13:23] you a mountaintop experience. How many
[13:25] want a mountaintop experience?
[13:27] Hallelujah. And no man should come up
[13:29] with thee. In other words, in other
[13:31] words, it's just you and I, God. Don't
[13:34] bring your brother Aaron.
[13:37] Just you. You want to see me, you come
[13:40] in the morning. Now that was preaching
[13:42] right there. Amen. And no man should
[13:44] come up with thee, neither let any man
[13:45] be seen throughout all the mount.
[13:47] Neither let the flocks nor the herds
[13:49] feed before that mount. Just you and me,
[13:52] Moses. And he h heed two tables of stone
[13:55] like in the first. He had to go back and
[13:57] do the first works.
[14:01] And Moses rose up early in the morning
[14:02] and went up unto Mount Si as the Lord
[14:05] commanded him. and he took in his hand
[14:06] two tables of stone. Now, I showed that
[14:08] picture last time, but I realized with
[14:10] that one, he can't see God in that one,
[14:12] right? Because looks like his I can't
[14:14] see his face. So, he must be facing
[14:15] towards the inside of the rock. So, I
[14:18] like the picture, but then I realized he
[14:19] looks like he's not even facing, you
[14:21] know what I mean? Like he he's facing
[14:23] the wrong way. So, I found a better one.
[14:26] I like that one.
[14:28] He said, "I'm going to cover you." I
[14:30] like it because he covers you with his
[14:31] hand. Now, Moses probably didn't have
[14:32] that long a hair. He was a man. Okay.
[14:36] He was not under a Nazarite vow as far
[14:37] as I know. I bet he had a big beard
[14:40] though like Jose.
[14:43] And the Lord descended in the cloud and
[14:46] stood with him there and proclaimed the
[14:48] name of the Lord. This is exactly what
[14:52] Moses asked for. If you delight yourself
[14:54] in the Lord, God will give you the
[14:56] desires of your heart. Amen. You want to
[14:59] SEE GOD'S GLORY? GET up in the morning.
[15:01] Hallelujah. Seek God. Present yourself
[15:03] before God. Make a sacrifice and God
[15:05] will show you his glory.
[15:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'll show you his fame, his
[15:10] reputation, his glory. Now, this is a
[15:13] repeat slide that I used last time. What
[15:15] follows will tell us mo tell Moses why
[15:18] God is famous. The Lord passed by and
[15:20] said, "The Lord, the Lord, God, merciful
[15:24] and gracious, long-suffering and
[15:26] abundant and goodness is truth." So,
[15:28] this is beyond miracles.
[15:31] This is beyond plagues. This means more
[15:34] to Moses than the parting of the Red
[15:36] Sea. Was knowing God's character,
[15:41] keeping mercy for thousands. And Moses
[15:43] was going to need mercy. He already
[15:44] already was a murderer.
[15:46] Forgiving iniquity. There's the murder.
[15:49] And transgression and sin, and that by
[15:51] no means he'll clear the guilty,
[15:53] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[15:55] upon the children, and upon the
[15:56] children's children, unto the third and
[15:58] to the fourth generations. So, there's
[16:01] 11 attributes. We saw right with the the
[16:03] the series on on the book of First
[16:06] Corinthians. There's 11 attributes God
[16:08] lists here. Now, I could there could be
[16:10] off one or the other. I might have
[16:11] combined them or split them up too too
[16:12] much, but I'm not making a doctrine. I'm
[16:14] just showing. There's lots of attributes
[16:16] God lists here. This is God's glory.
[16:20] Moses said, "Show it to me." God said,
[16:22] "Here you go." Now, what are you looking
[16:25] for? WHAT KIND OF GLORY are you looking
[16:27] for? Hallelujah. If you're A CHILD OF
[16:29] GOD, THIS IS ENOUGH. HALLELUJAH. IF
[16:32] YOU'RE A CHILD OF GOD, THIS IS GOD'S
[16:34] GLORY. HALLELUJAH.
[16:36] &gt;&gt; That God is merciful to me when I don't
[16:39] deserve it, Brother Patrick.
[16:41] God is gracious to me, Brother Claude,
[16:43] when I don't deserve it. He's
[16:46] long-suffering with me. He's abundant in
[16:49] goodness to you and I. He gives us the
[16:51] truth,
[16:53] and he keeps mercy not just for us, but
[16:55] thousands of us. He forgives all my
[16:58] iniquities. He heals all my diseases.
[17:01] Hallelujah. If I can quote David. He
[17:03] forgives my transgressions. My sins.
[17:05] Three types of sins. Iniquity,
[17:07] transgression, sin.
[17:09] And that no means will clear the guilty.
[17:11] So we saw the overlap in the blue. We
[17:14] saw the overlap. These are the same
[17:15] attributes Paul picks up and said, "This
[17:18] is love, and God is love, and the
[17:21] greatest gift of all is love."
[17:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:26] Amen.
[17:27] This is God's love. So we see Paul
[17:30] echoing some of these important
[17:32] attributes of God where if we understand
[17:35] this, if we see this, we've seen God's
[17:38] glory.
[17:40] Hallelujah.
[17:42] So Exodus chapters 20 through33, it goes
[17:46] from God's power to God's presence
[17:49] because God said, "I'm gonna come stand
[17:50] right by you on the rock.
[17:53] Me, I'm coming. You're gonna stand by
[17:56] me." It moves from his law to his love.
[18:00] He forgives all of our iniquities. Amen.
[18:02] Hallelujah. It moves from his acts to
[18:05] his attributes. Who God is.
[18:08] This is what God is like. He asks, Moses
[18:11] asks to see God's glory because the
[18:13] miracles can be seen from a distance,
[18:15] but his glory is only revealed to one
[18:18] man. Oh, church. His glory is only
[18:20] REVEALED TO ONE CHURCH. THAT'S THE BRIDE
[18:22] OF CHRIST. HALLELUJAH.
[18:24] THEY'RE NOT DENOMINATIONS ARE NOT SEEING
[18:26] GOD'S GLORY. THEY DON'T SEE THE GLORY of
[18:28] the seven seals and the revelation of
[18:30] THE WHOLE BIBLE TIED PERFECTLY TOGETHER.
[18:33] THEY DON'T SEE THAT. Only one church
[18:35] SEES IT, THE BRIDE OF Jesus Christ.
[18:38] &gt;&gt; I know cuz I used to not be in the bride
[18:40] of Christ and now I am. Praise God. And
[18:42] I say, we didn't see IT DENOMINATIONS,
[18:44] BUT NOW WE SEE GOD'S GLORY.
[18:47] &gt;&gt; Like I showed you with that uh what like
[18:49] I posted that video last week. They're
[18:51] all arguing about uh Kurt Cameron and
[18:53] and hell's not eternal. And these people
[18:55] are so blind they can't even see that
[18:58] when you give someone eternal
[19:00] punishment, you're giving them eternal
[19:02] life. They're so blind. And I'm not
[19:03] being harsh. I'm just saying they're not
[19:06] getting God's secrets.
[19:08] Those people are not they're not up by
[19:10] God on the rock. They're not up there
[19:12] standing or leaning upon the bosom of
[19:14] Jesus. They're leaning on their creeds.
[19:17] Church, does everybody see that?
[19:19] That's just one example. What about
[19:21] women preachers and women cutting hair
[19:23] and speaking in tongues as the evidence?
[19:25] Look, ALL THESE THINGS, CHURCH, I'M
[19:26] TRYING TO TELL YOU, THEY'RE NOT IN THE
[19:28] BOSOM OF JESUS. YOU'RE IN THE BOSOM of
[19:30] Jesus.
[19:33] &gt;&gt; It's not to exalt us. I would never do
[19:35] that. It's not to make you prideful.
[19:36] It's to make you humble
[19:39] &gt;&gt; to realize you've got God's glory. Now
[19:41] live in it.
[19:44] If you want to see it, you know how to
[19:45] do it. Present yourself before the Lord
[19:46] like Moses. And Moses made haste and
[19:49] bowed his head toward the earth and
[19:51] worshiped. Did it make him prideful? Did
[19:52] he say, "I'm the greatest prophet of ALL
[19:54] TIME. I KNOW GOD'S GLORY." NO, it made
[19:57] him humble and he bowed his face to the
[19:59] ground. I asked for God's glory. He
[20:02] showed me his glory. God is merciful.
[20:05] God is long-suffering with me.
[20:06] Hallelujah. God's God's attributes are
[20:10] on full display.
[20:12] And he said, 'If I now have found grace
[20:14] in thy sight, oh Lord. Let my Lord, I
[20:16] pray thee, go among us. So you've met
[20:20] me, now go among us as well. For it is a
[20:24] stiff necked people. This church is
[20:25] stiff necked. I'm not talking about us.
[20:28] I don't think we are. As I show with the
[20:29] Corinthians, all those 10 sins, we don't
[20:31] have any of them as far as I know. Now,
[20:33] we've we've got sins, but none of those.
[20:37] and pardon our iniquity and our sin and
[20:39] take us for thine inheritance. Lord, we
[20:43] want to be your inheritance.
[20:46] Hallelujah. We want to be your wife.
[20:48] Hallelujah.
[20:49] &gt;&gt; We want to be your people. We want your
[20:52] name. We want your ring. Hallelujah. We
[20:55] want to be the true bride of Jesus
[20:57] Christ. Make us your own. Hallelujah.
[21:00] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Behold, I'll make a
[21:01] covenant before all the people. I will
[21:03] do marvels such as has not been done in
[21:05] all the earth, nor in any nation. And
[21:07] all the people among which art which
[21:09] thou art shall see the work of the Lord,
[21:12] for it is a terrible thing that I will
[21:14] do with thee. Church, may everybody see
[21:16] the work of God in your life.
[21:20] Isn't that what we want, church? What
[21:22] could be more beneficial than that? That
[21:24] than than people saying, "Wow, God is
[21:26] really working in Malachi's life.
[21:29] God is. Wow, bro. God is work really
[21:31] working in brother Jose's life. I could
[21:33] put all your names in there, but what
[21:35] greater thing could there be than for
[21:36] people to look at you and say, "Wow,
[21:38] God's with that person.
[21:41] &gt;&gt; God's with them. They know God more than
[21:44] I do."
[21:46] He said, "I'm going to make a covenant."
[21:48] Now, look at the covenant. Observe the
[21:51] commands. Drive out your sin.
[21:53] Hallelujah. Drive out your sins. Don't
[21:55] live amongst it. Drive it out.
[21:58] Don't let sin stay there. Get rid of it.
[22:01] Take heed to thyself. In other words,
[22:03] look at look at your own life lest you
[22:05] make a covenant with sin.
[22:08] Look at your life. The Bible Paul told
[22:10] Timothy, "Examine yourself, right? Look
[22:12] at yourself. Take heed to thyself under
[22:14] the doctrine because if you preach and
[22:16] they get saved, you get saved also."
[22:19] Then he said, "But ye shall destroy
[22:21] their altars. Destroy any sin that
[22:23] causes you to stumble. Destroy it. Get
[22:26] rid of it." and observe God's word.
[22:29] &gt;&gt; This is the reaction. Just knowing God's
[22:32] glory. What did you expect?
[22:35] &gt;&gt; What did we expect? Do we expect to
[22:37] memorize the Bible? Was that what Moses
[22:38] expected to do? No. He just wants to
[22:40] live the Bible. Amen. He just wants to
[22:43] to to hate sin and love righteousness.
[22:47] And that will be enough for Moses.
[22:48] Hallelujah.
[22:50] &gt;&gt; Lord, just forgive ALL MY SIN. STAY WITH
[22:52] US. Stay with your people. Let people
[22:54] see your work in my life and help me not
[22:57] to love sin. Help me to hate sin and
[22:59] drive it out of my life.
[23:02] &gt;&gt; For thou shalt worship no other god.
[23:05] For the Lord whose name is jealous, I
[23:07] love that. Is a jealous God. There's
[23:08] seven letters in that name, too. It's
[23:10] interesting. Seven. It's completion.
[23:14] He's a jealous God. His name is jealous.
[23:17] So church, tomorrow when you pray, say,
[23:19] "Dear heavenly father, jealous father."
[23:23] that we're under the law, right? Under
[23:25] the law. But the Bible says that in the
[23:27] New Testament as well. I think it's in
[23:28] the book of James. The spirit uh lusts
[23:31] against uh Yeah. I have to look it up.
[23:34] Yeah. Uh give me a second here.
[23:38] You find it before I do. Let me know.
[23:45] Hebrews and James.
[23:48] Hopefully I can find it here by God's
[23:49] grace. But the Bible says that
[23:54] There it is. Yep. James 4:5. Hallelujah.
[23:56] Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Do you think
[23:58] that the scripture saith in vain, the
[24:00] spirit that dwelleth in us lustth to
[24:03] envy? The spirit of God envies us or is
[24:06] grieved or wants our worship when we
[24:08] give it to something else. And the
[24:10] church said,
[24:12] &gt;&gt; God is still jealous in the New
[24:13] Testament, but it's holy. It's not like
[24:15] our jealousy.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; That could be wrong. God's always right.
[24:20] Lest thou make a covenant with
[24:21] inhabitants. They go whoring after other
[24:24] gods and sacrifice on their gods. They
[24:27] sacrifice their time for these gods.
[24:30] And you take daughters. Then you start
[24:32] intermaring with unbelievers.
[24:35] They shall make no molten gods. Don't
[24:38] let any idol come up in your life. Keep
[24:40] yourself free from idols, little
[24:42] children. That's what Paul said and John
[24:44] said. Keep yourself from idols. Now,
[24:48] here's where I want to get to.
[24:50] Let's look at the types in the cleft of
[24:52] the rock because this is as soon as I
[24:54] shook somebody's hand after I preach it.
[24:56] That scripture came to my mind. Your
[24:58] life is hid with God in Christ Jesus. It
[25:00] might have been Jose who said it.
[25:02] Somebody said it. I was like,
[25:04] I didn't even preach that. What's wrong
[25:06] with me? I'm a preacher.
[25:09] How could I not preach that? The rock
[25:12] symbolizes Christ
[25:15] because Christ is strong. Christ is
[25:18] solid. Christ is unmovable. Christ is
[25:20] steadfast. Christ is your safety, your
[25:22] stability, and your life.
[25:26] &gt;&gt; The Bible said they all drank of the
[25:27] same spiritual drink and the drank of
[25:29] the spiritual rock that followed them.
[25:31] And that rock was Christ. The Lord is my
[25:34] rock and my fortress and my deliverer.
[25:36] So Moses goes to hide out in Christ.
[25:40] And the church said, "Where are you
[25:42] hiding today?" Amen. I'M HIDING IN
[25:45] CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. I GOT NOWHERE ELSE
[25:48] TO HIDE.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO HIDE ANYWHERE ELSE.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; I want to hide one place. But Patrick,
[25:54] that's in Christ.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go hide in the caves.
[25:58] That's the wrong place to hide. I don't
[25:59] want to go hide under the uh well, the
[26:02] the islands like Mark Zuckerberg's
[26:03] building that thing. Well, he already
[26:05] built it. His underground layer to
[26:07] escape the atomic bombs. I'm sorry. You
[26:09] won't escape. Praise God. The waters
[26:11] will cover all the islands. You won't
[26:13] escape. There enough air you can keep
[26:15] under there. Hallelujah. You won't
[26:17] escape.
[26:18] That rock symbolizes Christ. When Moses
[26:21] was hid by God in the rock, it
[26:22] symbolized being hidden in Christ, the
[26:24] true rock of salvation. The cleft was a
[26:27] split or opening and that points to
[26:30] Christ's pierced side
[26:32] because salvation flows out of Christ.
[26:36] Hallelujah. Isaiah 53:12 says, "Jesus
[26:39] poured out his soul into death and he
[26:42] bare the sin of many." church. He lifted
[26:45] up all your sin and he carried it away.
[26:48] Do you think he had trouble carrying
[26:49] your sin? No, he didn't. Because he's
[26:51] God. Amen. You think the strongest and
[26:54] then the greatest person in the universe
[26:56] had trouble with your sin? He carried it
[26:58] away. The Bible said,
[27:00] &gt;&gt; the Bible didn't say he he couldn't
[27:01] carry Malachi sin away and Jesse sin
[27:04] away. The Bible didn't say that. The
[27:05] Bible said HE LIFTED IT UP and he
[27:07] carried it away.
[27:08] &gt;&gt; He carried it away from you and I so
[27:10] your sin doesn't live WITH YOU. SO DON'T
[27:13] LET IT LIVE WITH YOU.
[27:15] &gt;&gt; You carried it away.
[27:18] To be in the cliff means you're
[27:20] sheltered within Jesus, the wounded
[27:23] savior.
[27:25] You're protected from the consuming
[27:27] judgments of God. Everybody see the
[27:29] type. Now why I didn't preach this
[27:32] earlier? Must have just been God holding
[27:34] it with from me.
[27:36] Now the hand represents protection. I'll
[27:39] cover thee with my hand. It represents
[27:41] mercy because he would have died unless
[27:44] God put his hand there.
[27:46] The Bible said in the shadow of his
[27:48] hand, he's hid me. The shadow of his
[27:51] hand. Amen. Hallelujah. And I love this.
[27:53] FOR YOU ARE DEAD AND YOUR LIFE IS HID
[27:56] WITH CHRIST IN GOD. AMEN. I AM HIDDEN.
[28:00] JUST LIKE MOSES WAS HIDDEN IN THE ROCK,
[28:03] YOU ARE HIDDEN IN CHRIST. AND THAT'S IN
[28:05] GOD AS WELL. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. I got two
[28:09] LAYERS OF PROTECTION, BROTHER CHRIS. I
[28:11] GOT CHRIST AND THEN I'M ALSO IN GOD. SO,
[28:15] HOW CAN ANY DEVIL GET ME? AMEN. IF I'M
[28:18] HID IN CHRIST AND GOD'S AND AND THE
[28:20] FATHER, CHRIST'S OWN OWN FATHER.
[28:22] HALLELUJAH.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; IF I IF I'M IN THE SUN, I'M ALSO THE
[28:26] FATHER. THE DEVIL CAN'T TOUCH ME BECAUSE
[28:28] JESUS SAID, "SATAN, YOU HAVE NO PART IN
[28:30] ME." OH, THERE IT IS. AMEN.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[28:35] SEE, salvation is not just seeing God's
[28:37] miracles. It's being protected by God.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Hidden in God
[28:44] while all the glory passes by. You can
[28:46] only survive his presence when you're
[28:48] hidden in Christ. Just like John.
[28:52] The back parts symbolize partial
[28:54] revelation.
[28:56] You'll see my back parts, but my face
[28:58] shall not be seen. This shows the law
[29:01] was a partial revelation. Like brother
[29:03] Chris was saying, the Old Testament was
[29:05] a partial revelation of God, but not the
[29:07] full revelation.
[29:10] Right? Moses only saw what came after
[29:13] God passed. Right? After God passed,
[29:15] then he saw the backside, his theophony.
[29:18] Just as the law and prophets
[29:20] foreshadowed Christ from behind and they
[29:23] revealed a glimpse of what was to come
[29:26] because the law was a shadow of good
[29:28] things to come.
[29:33] See, but Jesus Christ here, brother
[29:34] Chris, uh gives us the full revelation
[29:37] of God's grace and truth.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Remember the Bible said the blood of
[29:42] animals just covered over sin. Ah, it's
[29:46] a partial realization of forgiveness,
[29:48] but the blood of Jesus Christ fully
[29:51] annihilates sin.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It totally SEPARATES US FROM
[29:56] ALL of our doesn't cover over. It
[29:58] carries it away.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It extinguishes it. It
[30:03] annihilates it. It's no more. It's not
[30:06] just hiding it. IT'S COMPLETELY DONE
[30:08] AWAY WITH. HALLELUJAH.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; No man has seen God in any time. the
[30:13] only begotten son. He hath declared him.
[30:16] The Bible said he was full of grace and
[30:18] truth and all the fullness of the
[30:20] Godhead dwelt in him bodily.
[30:23] Only in Christ can the full face of God
[30:25] be seen. Second Corinthians 4, we preach
[30:28] not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord
[30:30] and ourselves your servants for Christ's
[30:32] sake. We are all to serve one another
[30:35] for Christ's sake. For God who command
[30:38] the light to shine out of darkness has
[30:40] shined in our hearts to give the light
[30:42] of the knowledge of glory of God where
[30:45] in the face of Jesus Christ. Now I can't
[30:48] even hardly understand that verse.
[30:51] Alls I know is God's word has shined
[30:54] into our hearts and given me light and
[30:57] I'm in the face of Jesus Christ. I have
[31:01] to be because I'm hidden in him. If I'm
[31:04] in him, I got to be somewhere close to
[31:05] his face. If I if I'm in Jesus.
[31:08] Hallelujah.
[31:10] So the Bible says if you've got God's
[31:12] light, how many got God's light shine in
[31:14] your heart?
[31:15] &gt;&gt; All the darkness is scattered.
[31:18] Hallelujah.
[31:19] Now I'm in the face of Jesus Christ.
[31:23] Remember the shoe bread? Remember in the
[31:24] Old Testament, shoebre means bread of
[31:26] his face.
[31:29] And when you're feasting on the bread of
[31:30] God, it's like you're eating before his
[31:32] face because his face, his presence is
[31:34] in the holiest of holies. But the Bible
[31:36] considers it as you're eating the bread
[31:39] of life. Those 12 New Testament
[31:40] mysteries.
[31:42] Glory.
[31:44] When you're eating those, YOU'RE IN THE
[31:46] FACE of God Almighty in his presence.
[31:51] I was hoping to get a few more amens on
[31:52] that.
[31:54] Maybe you guys haven't read the book,
[31:58] but we have THIS TREASURE. WHERE'S YOUR
[31:59] TREASURE AT, brother Patrick? Where's
[32:01] your treasure? Show me your treasure
[32:02] card. You got a treasure card on your
[32:04] phone or app or something? No, no, no.
[32:06] It's not in a physical thing. It's in
[32:09] your tabernacle.
[32:11] The treasure of God. Where is it at?
[32:13] It's in your temple. It's in your human
[32:15] spirit. It's in your soul. BECAUSE THE
[32:17] POWER IS not of you. The power is of
[32:20] God.
[32:22] &gt;&gt; And I actually copy and pasted some
[32:24] extra stuff there. I got some trouble
[32:26] with my uh my software. But just notice,
[32:30] Brother Ram goes through this. I'm not
[32:32] going to go through it all, but brother
[32:33] said there's a difference between
[32:34] partial and real. Jesus said, "I'm the
[32:38] true bread." Because the mana was just
[32:40] partial bread. Jesus is the true bread.
[32:43] Now, church, which one would you rather
[32:44] have tonight? The the the honey the
[32:47] honey uh cakes of mana or would you
[32:49] rather have the word of Jesus Christ?
[32:52] That's a good answer. And that's the
[32:55] real bread.
[32:56] Now, we'd love to see God rain down some
[32:58] mana from heaven. Would that be pretty
[33:00] powerful? But really, you got the real
[33:03] thing.
[33:04] I just said you got the real bread of
[33:06] God. You ain't got to go gather food
[33:08] outside your house tomorrow to go get
[33:10] the wafers that are like angel's bread.
[33:13] You just got to open up your Bible and
[33:15] pray. Hallelujah. You just got to lift
[33:17] your voice to God and you've already got
[33:19] the real bread.
[33:21] Not false, not not a not a partial or
[33:22] false bread. You got the real bread. I
[33:25] got the real bread. Jesus is the true
[33:27] vine.
[33:29] &gt;&gt; Not a partial vine, but the true vine.
[33:32] If you're truly attached to him, you're
[33:34] getting the true life of God.
[33:37] Oh my.
[33:39] And he's the true light. We all got cell
[33:42] phones. We all got our flashlights.
[33:46] That's a partial light. But the Bible
[33:48] says if you've got the Holy Ghost in
[33:49] you, you've got the real light of God.
[33:52] How much brighter are you than this?
[33:55] This is just a natural. It's a partial
[33:58] light. I can kind of cover it. But your
[34:01] light is the real light.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; The the life of Jesus, the spirit of
[34:06] Jesus Christ is much greater than this.
[34:09] You don't got the partial church. We got
[34:10] the real.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; How many appreciate God reminding this?
[34:17] The cliff symbolizes that you're hidden
[34:19] from judgment because God said you die.
[34:23] He said if He said if I pass by. So the
[34:26] rack is a safe place. I love that God
[34:29] gives you a safe place. Jesus is your
[34:31] safe place.
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Do you remember co all these crazy
[34:34] people to run to their safe place? I
[34:36] need a safe place in the corner with a
[34:39] pillow or something like that. Church,
[34:40] we got way better than that. We've got a
[34:42] real safe place. We've got a rock. We've
[34:45] got Jesus. Hallelujah.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; And the Bible said there's no
[34:49] condemnation if you're in the rock.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; How many in the rock? Your life is hid
[34:56] with Christ in God in the rock.
[34:59] Hallelujah. And the Bible said he shall
[35:02] be a hiding place. God is your hiding
[35:05] place. Hallelujah.
[35:07] You hide in Jesus so the judgment
[35:10] doesn't kill you.
[35:12] That's why, church, just keep confessing
[35:15] your sin because God can't kill you as
[35:18] long as you're in the rock. Amen. As
[35:20] long as you're in Christ, GOD'S JUDGMENT
[35:23] CAN'T GET to you because no judgment
[35:25] comes in God's rock.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; Now, this was a foreshadowing.
[35:34] The back parts, God showed his back
[35:36] parts to Moses. Humanity could only see
[35:39] a partial revelation until Christ came
[35:41] because the word was made flesh and
[35:43] dwelt among us. We beheld his glories.
[35:46] There's the glory.
[35:48] He that has seen me, Jesus said, has
[35:51] seen the father. So, we didn't just see
[35:53] the backside, brother, because we saw
[35:55] the face of God in Christ Jesus. The
[35:58] character of God.
[36:03] Moses had a glimpse. But the greatest
[36:06] revelation came in Jesus Christ. You
[36:09] want to know how God would talk to you
[36:10] in a situation? Go read Matthew, Mark,
[36:12] Luke, and John. Because you probably got
[36:15] one of those concerns in there, right?
[36:17] Sickness, money, inheritance, right?
[36:20] Paying taxes.
[36:22] Probably got all these things in there.
[36:24] Jesus would tell you exactly what God
[36:25] would say
[36:27] because he was the fullness of the
[36:29] Godhead bodily.
[36:30] I love this. the the cleft or that
[36:33] broken part in the rock. It represents
[36:35] the crucifixion.
[36:38] It represents the wounded Christ. The
[36:41] rock was broken. The rock was smitten.
[36:44] And so Moses had to hide inside the
[36:47] wound. And the Bible said he was wounded
[36:50] for our transgressions. And with his
[36:52] stripes, you were healed already.
[36:56] &gt;&gt; The Bible said a fountain would be open
[36:58] in the house of David. Hallelujah. for
[37:00] healing. Out of his pierced side it
[37:02] flowed blood and water. Hallelujah. And
[37:05] where we and from that we get cleansing
[37:08] and shelter and life because water is
[37:10] life. So blood is forgiveness and water
[37:14] is life. Amen. You're forgiven and
[37:17] YOU'VE GOT ETERNAL LIFE TODAY.
[37:19] HALLELUJAH.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Because blood and water flowed out of
[37:22] this wounded rock. You just got to hide
[37:24] in there. just stay in there
[37:28] &gt;&gt; because Satan can't get in there. Ram
[37:30] said if he does, he'll be your brother.
[37:31] Right. But Cam preached that quote.
[37:33] That's a good quote from the seals.
[37:36] The passing glory symbolized the
[37:38] resurrection and Pentecost.
[37:42] See that God's glory at Pentecost came
[37:45] to dwell within the believers rather
[37:47] than destroying them.
[37:50] The same glory would have consumed Moses
[37:52] now, but now it dwells indwells God's
[37:55] people because they're in Christ. Oh
[37:57] yeah, there it is. But we are with the
[37:58] open face beholding as in a glass the
[38:01] glory of the Lord. Brother Chris, we
[38:03] behold God's glory. As we read the word,
[38:06] as we pray, we pray and we we experience
[38:10] the presence of God. And that's like
[38:12] we're looking in the face of God.
[38:16] Hallelujah.
[38:20] Also, this hidden in the rock also
[38:23] foreshadows your security. Neither shall
[38:25] any man pluck them out of my hand. Who
[38:27] took Moses out of that clutch of the
[38:29] rock? Did anybody take him out? It's a
[38:30] trick question. No, nobody can take them
[38:33] out. Nobody can take you out of Christ
[38:35] either.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; Who's going to take you out? Just go
[38:39] alone with Jesus. Nobody. If you don't
[38:41] take anybody along, nobody can take you
[38:42] out. Amen.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Just you and get along with Jesus.
[38:45] Hallelujah. Get low with Jesus and stay
[38:47] in Jesus. Hallelujah.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Nobody can take you out. There's no high
[38:52] school teacher that can take you out.
[38:53] Patrick,
[38:54] &gt;&gt; there's no soccer coach, brother Claude,
[38:56] that can take you out. Hallelujah.
[38:59] There's no uh uh keyboard warrior on
[39:02] YouTube who can take me out.
[39:05] Hallelujah. Or Facebook, whatever you
[39:06] want to say. They can't take you out
[39:09] because I am hidden in Christ. They
[39:12] don't see me because I'm hidden.
[39:15] And church, I'll say IT LIKE THIS. GOD
[39:17] DON'T SEE YOUR SINS EITHER BECAUSE
[39:19] YOU'RE HIDDEN IN CHRIST AS WELL.
[39:20] HALLELUJAH.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. But man said he just hears your
[39:24] voice.
[39:26] Because you are hidden in Christ and
[39:28] Christ is in God.
[39:32] So just as Moses was hidden and
[39:34] protected, you're preserved by God's own
[39:37] power
[39:38] &gt;&gt; through faith.
[39:40] Nobody can pull me out of the rock,
[39:43] brother Patrick, because nobody put me
[39:45] in the rock except God. God put me in.
[39:48] Ain't nobody going to get me out.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Eight's not really a good word, but you
[39:52] understand.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; Now, church, look, this happened before.
[39:56] God passed by many times. The destroying
[39:59] angel passed by and God spared the
[40:01] people. Oh, hallelujah. As long as
[40:04] you've got blood, as long as you have
[40:06] blood and you're hidden in THE HOUSE,
[40:08] THE DEATH ANGEL CAN'T TOUCH YOU.
[40:10] HALLELUJAH. OH MY. As long as YOU'RE
[40:13] HIDDEN IN CHRIST, JUDGMENT CAN'T STRIKE
[40:15] YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE HIDDEN in Jesus
[40:17] Christ.
[40:19] &gt;&gt; Elijah was in the cave, right? He was h
[40:21] in the cave. God passed by. There was
[40:23] thunderings, lightnings, earthquakes,
[40:26] all these shocking things and thunders
[40:28] and all these things. And that WAS GOD
[40:30] PASSING BY. But God said, "You're not
[40:32] going to know me in that. You're going
[40:34] to know me in the stills." You got it.
[40:37] I'm seeing what you remember.
[40:40] And that's what Moses had. Moses had the
[40:42] still small experience. He had that
[40:44] one-on-one with God. So, see, even
[40:47] Elijah, that was a another type of what
[40:50] God was going to do in Christ. He was
[40:52] going to hide us in Christ and speak to
[40:55] us oneon-one.
[40:57] Boy, I could get another sermon out of
[40:58] that. One-on-one with God. I could go to
[41:00] Jacob and how he wrestled with the angel
[41:02] one onone. Elijah one-on-one. Moses
[41:05] one-on-one with God.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; That's what God wants, church. You and
[41:08] him with fellowship.
[41:13] Isaiah 3:15 says, "The Lord will defend
[41:15] Israel by passing over."
[41:18] And then, of course, Moses is in the
[41:20] cliff of the rock as God passes by and
[41:22] he protects him with his hand.
[41:25] So in other words, Moses hitting the
[41:27] cliff is a living prophecy of salvation.
[41:31] Church, you are hidden from judgment.
[41:33] You're covered by his grace and you're
[41:35] allowed to see God's glory only through
[41:38] the rock who is Jesus. Oh my goodness
[41:40] gracious. Hallelujah. What a what a what
[41:44] a story for us. What an illustration for
[41:46] us to see how God looks at us. We're
[41:50] hidden in Christ.
[41:52] And I got one final one from brother
[41:55] Brandon. I like this. So I'm almost
[41:57] ready to close, saints. Give me I got
[41:58] about three three slides of quotes. How
[42:00] many ready for this last quote here?
[42:03] &gt;&gt; As far as I planned, that's the only
[42:04] one. God might have a different plan.
[42:07] Now, Brother Ram's preaching as the
[42:09] eagle stirs her nest. And brother Ram
[42:11] said as the eagle stirs up her nest from
[42:13] Psalms. It is a time when the eagle
[42:15] thinks that her little ones has matured
[42:17] enough. She's got to stir her nest.
[42:20] In other words, the mother sees the the
[42:23] eagles are in the nest and they're
[42:24] mature enough. It's time for them to
[42:26] leave the nest.
[42:28] So, what does brother Ram say she does?
[42:30] And you can see this. They got these on
[42:31] YouTube. You can see it, too. And God
[42:33] does the same thing in his church. When
[42:36] we get got all settled down on
[42:38] something, then God stirs the nest
[42:40] again. He brought Martin Luther from
[42:42] Catholicism. They got so starchy that he
[42:45] stirred the nest and sent Wesley in.
[42:48] He sent Wesley in like a mother eagle to
[42:50] stir up the nest. That's what brother
[42:52] Ram come to me. Come to stir up the
[42:53] churches. How many got stirred up?
[42:57] &gt;&gt; I did. I started loving going to church
[42:58] after brother I heard brother preach.
[43:00] Amen. I started wanting to start a
[43:02] church after I heard brother Brandon
[43:04] preach.
[43:06] Amen. Then Wesley's now not Wesley but
[43:09] the followers got so starchy he served
[43:11] the nest and sent Pentecost in. It's
[43:12] nesting time again because we got so
[43:15] settled down. Amen. Church, if you've
[43:17] got lazy in your life or tired in your
[43:19] life or worn out in your life, let me
[43:21] say this. It's nest stirring time.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:26] &gt;&gt; Stir the nest. Wake up. SEE THE GLORY OF
[43:29] GOD. GET IN GOD'S PRESENCE. GET IN THE
[43:31] CLEFT OF THE ROCK. HALLELUJAH.
[43:34] &gt;&gt; Put yourself in Christ because you can
[43:37] do it. God said you could.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Get back in Christ. Don't get back in
[43:43] idols of the world. Get back in the
[43:45] word.
[43:49] Now, here's the here's the one I I
[43:50] hadn't really prepared for this one. Oh,
[43:52] yeah. Brother said, "This old mother
[43:54] eagle flies into the nest one day.
[43:56] Unexpected the little eagleist as she
[43:58] comes in." So, they're not expecting her
[44:00] to do what she's going to do. So, mama
[44:01] comes in. Babies don't know what's going
[44:03] to happen. They're just like, "Hey,
[44:04] mama, you going to feed me today? I'm
[44:06] ready to eat. Do everything for me. Take
[44:08] care of me." God said, "No, it's going
[44:11] to change. It's all going to change
[44:13] today." Church, how many know your life
[44:15] can change like that?
[44:18] God, one day everything's going fine.
[44:19] Next day everything's different.
[44:24] Oh, how I've laid and watched them and
[44:26] we wept like a baby with my bot
[44:28] binoculars trained on them. My horse
[44:29] tied off somewhere. Watch them. And
[44:31] she'll fly into the nest and she'll take
[44:33] those great wings and she'll give them a
[44:34] great shower of wind. [laughter]
[44:37] It shakes every loose feather out of
[44:39] them because she's fixing to give them
[44:41] their first little solo flight. And you
[44:44] can't have loose feathers when you're
[44:45] flying solo for the Lord.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Your life, your life can't be loose if
[44:50] you're going to go out and fly and do
[44:52] something for the Lord.
[44:54] &gt;&gt; Can't have things hanging on you that
[44:56] don't belong there.
[44:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What a beautiful type.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; She flies in and they have a a mighty
[45:05] rushing winds. I'm familiar, anybody,
[45:06] with Acts chapter 2. They never felt it
[45:09] before because they were born in the
[45:11] cliff of the rock. Why? They're eagles.
[45:14] But God changes it. He give them
[45:16] something new. Church, pray for God.
[45:18] God, SHOW ME SOMETHING NEW. SHOW ME your
[45:20] glory.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:24] As the church was born in the cliff of
[45:25] the rock, we cannot be satisfied there.
[45:28] It's not good enough just to be born
[45:29] again. God stirs up the nest sometimes.
[45:32] Now, it is good enough in one way,
[45:33] right? But, brother, I'm saying get to
[45:35] your gifts. Get to your ministry. Find
[45:37] what God's called you to do. Fly where
[45:40] God's called you to fly.
[45:42] Don't live a comfortable life not doing
[45:44] what you SHOULD DO. BE MATURE. Go fly
[45:47] and do where God wants you to go and do
[45:49] and help people. Be a BLESSING TO
[45:50] PEOPLE. SHOW CHARITY TO PEOPLE.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; God stirs up the nest sometimes, comes
[45:58] in like a rushing mighty wind like he
[46:01] did on the day of Pentecost and all the
[46:03] old worldly loose feathers fly out. He
[46:06] sends a Pentecostal revival and shakes
[46:09] up the nest.
[46:11] Hey, and then he gives a certain SCREAM
[46:14] LIKE, "THUS SAYAITH THE LORD from
[46:17] brother Abraham." HALLELUJAH. THUS
[46:19] SAYITH THE BIBLE.
[46:22] OH, all the little eagles know something
[46:23] is fixing to happen then. They're
[46:25] eagles. Oh, mama's acting different
[46:27] today. Oh my. Brother Jesse's acting
[46:29] different today. The spirit of God is
[46:31] acting different today in service. God's
[46:33] fixing to do something. Praise God.
[46:36] &gt;&gt; That's what the mother eagle is showing
[46:38] the children. That's the reason When you
[46:41] see a shaking time come, eagles are
[46:43] ready for a blessing. The church is
[46:46] ready for something. The true church of
[46:48] God, when they see a shaking time
[46:50] coming, how many want to see God shake
[46:52] something in your life?
[46:53] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Musicians can
[46:55] come. I told you I only had three left
[46:56] by God's grace.
[46:59] Let's thank the Lord. Amen. Hallelujah.
[47:01] Amen. [applause]
[47:04] So my question is for you. Where are you
[47:07] hiding today?
[47:09] Are you hiding in fear?
[47:11] Are you hiding in worldly pleasures?
[47:16] Are you hiding in regret? Living in the
[47:18] past?
[47:21] Are you hiding in fear for the future?
[47:23] Where are you hiding? I suggest that you
[47:25] and I find the right hiding place
[47:27] tonight.
[47:29] There's only one hiding place that's
[47:31] that's worth hiding.
[47:33] Remember, all the rich men are going to
[47:34] go in the mountains and caves, say,
[47:36] "Follow us. Follow us." and that God
[47:37] won't let them die because they need to
[47:39] be tormented for all the wickedness that
[47:41] they've done. But God is giving us a
[47:44] spiritual hiding place that is the true
[47:47] hiding place.
[47:49] Not a partial, a true.
[47:53] Let's make sure we're in the true hiding
[47:55] place tonight. Let's bow our heads.
[47:59] Father, we thank you for tonight, Lord
[48:01] God. Hallelujah. The devil can't get to
[48:03] us because we're in Christ and on top of
[48:06] that we're in the father. We have a
[48:09] double blessing, a double anointing.
[48:11] Amen. A double protection. Hallelujah.
[48:14] Thank you, Jesus. The only way Satan
[48:17] could come in there if he becomes our
[48:18] brother. Like that quote says, Lord, we
[48:21] know Satan won't come through there.
[48:22] He's destined to be destroyed and never
[48:24] more shall he be.
[48:27] Hell was created for the devil and his
[48:29] angels,
[48:31] but heaven was created for the bride of
[48:33] Jesus Christ and the servants of God.
[48:36] Thank you, Lord God. Father, I pray,
[48:38] Lord, if people are hiding in the wrong
[48:40] place today, may they not hide out
[48:43] [music] on a computer or a cell phone or
[48:46] in a movie theater
[48:48] or in a romance book or something or
[48:50] some type of a dirty magazine or
[48:52] something. May they not hide there. May
[48:54] they find Christ as their hiding place
[48:57] today,
[49:01] Lord Jesus.
[49:03] There's one place we need to be, Lord
[49:05] God. Lord, we want to be like Moses and
[49:09] present ourselves before you
[49:13] and we want to come near to you. We want
[49:15] to see your glory, Lord God, in our
[49:17] lives.
[49:19] Hallelujah. Lord, I pray for your
[49:21] people. I pray for me. I pray God that
[49:23] we would draw close to you to see your
[49:27] glory in our lives, Lord God. Grant it,
[49:29] Lord Jesus. You're holy. Hallelujah.
[49:32] You're longsuffering. You're merciful.
[49:34] You forgive our iniquities, Lord God.
[49:36] Our sins, our transgressions.
[49:40] You are the truth.
[49:43] You're gracious.
[49:46] That is your glory. How you're so good
[49:48] to us,
[49:50] Lord. We appreciate signs, miracles, and
[49:52] wonders. I want to see more of them,
[49:53] too. But God, may we realize tonight
[49:56] there's only one hiding place, and that
[49:59] is in Jesus Christ who takes away all of
[50:02] our sin, forgives all of our iniquity,
[50:05] heals our all our diseases, Lord God.
[50:08] And I pray as that quote said, "Stir up
[50:11] your people, Lord. Lord, if we're born
[50:13] the cleft of the rock, there comes a
[50:15] time we got to go flying out. Every
[50:17] eagle has to go fly
[50:20] and find their ministry, find what
[50:21] they're called to do, find their gifts.
[50:24] The nest in the rock is a special place.
[50:26] It's where we're born according to
[50:27] brother Brandham's [music] story, Lord
[50:29] God. But Lord, then the eagle serves a
[50:31] nest and it's time to go out and do
[50:33] something for the Lord.
[50:35] Now, maybe Lord is just fasting and
[50:37] praying so devils can be cast out.
[50:40] Maybe it's a gift of knowledge. Maybe
[50:42] it's tongues and interpretation, [music]
[50:44] Lord God.
[50:46] Lord, we want to be consecrated. We want
[50:48] to be shut in in Christ [music] the
[50:50] rock.
[50:53] And you'll come stand by us, Lord God.
[50:55] Hallelujah.
[50:57] Show us your glory tonight, I pray.
[51:00] Grant it, Lord. You hear our humble
[51:02] [music] prayers. Hear our requests,
[51:03] Lord. We pray in Jesus Christ's name.
[51:06] And the church said,
