[18:04] little more with job
[18:06] but job chapter one verse one
[18:09] there was a man in the land of us whose
[18:12] name was job and that man was perfect
[18:14] and upright and one that feared god and
[18:16] eschewed evil
[18:19] i want to skip down
[18:23] to verse 8 and the lord said unto satan
[18:27] hast thou considered my servant job
[18:29] that there is none like him in the earth
[18:35] a perfect and upright man one that
[18:38] feareth god

[22:49] tuesday morning i was sitting and
[22:51] working on the book
[22:53] um and uh i got a text from mothercam i
[22:56] thought huh
[22:57] nice to hear from camp he said are you
[22:59] preaching tomorrow night
[23:00] i said no sir i said we're uh we're
[23:03] having service on friday instead
[23:05] he said would you like to preach for me
[23:06] tomorrow i said well let me text my wife
[23:09] and previously you know my wife and i
[23:11] were talking i wanted to go see my dad
[23:13] over break
[23:14] uh to tell him about the curses and
[23:16] blessings i was preaching on
[23:18] and i told him about i told him when i
[23:20] felt i was under the spirit and i cursed
[23:22] that spirit of depression on him
[23:24] in jesus christ's name many a few weeks
[23:27] ago many
[23:28] weeks ago and by now i told him about it
[23:30] yesterday
[23:33] but i was telling my wife i said over a
[23:34] break one of those days i want to go see
[23:36] my dad and tell him about blessings and
[23:38] curses
[23:38] and so you know cam didn't know that cam
[23:40] just said the holy spirit put me on his
[23:41] heart
[23:43] and so i said and he said well if it's
[23:45] of god it'll be on working on both ends
[23:48] well i i was working on my end because i
[23:51] was gonna come back
[23:51] and see my dad so i talked to my wife
[23:53] and she's like yeah that'd be great
[23:54] let's go see cam
[23:56] um so on wednesday you know we left what
[23:59] yeah
[24:00] we left wednesday yeah got there got to
[24:04] see my mom a little bit i didn't get a
[24:05] chance to talk to her about the letter
[24:07] because we never got any private time
[24:09] but anyways you know i get you you
[24:11] recall i wrote her the letter
[24:13] and uh about her repenting and the dream
[24:15] she had
[24:16] coming to me for help and she told my
[24:19] sister she wasn't
[24:21] uh ready to make it right yet although
[24:24] she said my letter was true
[24:26] um so anyways i passed it all day preach
[24:29] wednesday night well the camp said that
[24:31] a great move of the holy spirit
[24:32] he said he hasn't seen that many people
[24:33] come forward for prayer in a while so i
[24:35] felt
[24:35] i felt very thankful the holy spirit
[24:37] could meet people's needs
[24:38] the cam told me brothers were calling
[24:40] themselves driving on the way home
[24:41] talking about the word of god and
[24:43] everything for half an hour just talking
[24:45] about the sermon now when was the last
[24:46] time you did that
[24:48] i just thought what a blessing the holy
[24:49] spirit really moved there so i thank the
[24:51] lord for that
[24:52] well then that morning the next morning
[24:54] thursday cam and i were just
[24:55] fellowshipping
[24:56] and then i went over to see my dad uh
[24:58] and i just waited on the holy spirit you
[25:00] know he's i let him preach a little bit
[25:02] you know he likes to preach and his side
[25:03] of the story
[25:05] and i just waited for my time and then i
[25:08] started telling him i said dad you won't
[25:09] know what's wrong
[25:10] you're under a curse and he looked at me
[25:12] he stopped me and said you're right
[25:14] the lord just showed me that two nights
[25:16] ago
[25:17] and i said you're cursed because you
[25:19] have so much hatred in your heart
[25:22] i said your dad cursed you the marine
[25:23] corps cursed you
[25:25] i said all these workers have cursed you
[25:26] and i said dad the only way to be free
[25:28] is to forgive them and you know i went
[25:31] on i told him everything i've told you
[25:33] i that's that's the best conversation
[25:35] i've ever had with my dad in 40 years
[25:38] the best conversation i've ever had
[25:39] finally i had to go i said let me pray
[25:41] for you
[25:42] and i said i bless you dad i said
[25:44] there's power of life in the tongue
[25:45] i bless you in the name of jesus christ
[25:48] and i curse that spirit that's on you
[25:50] it's gonna leave i said satan get behind
[25:52] him
[25:53] and he looked at me and the first time
[25:54] he's ever said this he said thank you
[25:56] brother for praying for me
[25:59] he called me brother he's never called
[26:01] me brother before
[26:03] and i said dad i bless you when i was
[26:05] leaving i said dad i bless you in jesus
[26:06] christ's name again he said i already
[26:08] feel it
[26:09] and he was i was crying you know he was
[26:11] crying it was really
[26:12] a special thing now i don't know how
[26:14] long it will take him
[26:15] to get out of that and to go forgive
[26:19] those
[26:19] people make it right but i've never i
[26:22] just never experienced such a leadership
[26:23] of the lord going from you know
[26:25] cams to the brother my dad's and then
[26:27] just seeing how god directed everything
[26:29] everything was just led to the lord like
[26:30] that so i believe i'm walking under the
[26:32] leadership of the holy spirit
[26:34] they that are led of the spirit are the
[26:35] sons of god amen
[26:37] so i'm very thankful to be a son of god
[26:39] tonight praise god
[26:40] uh so just so that's just a real brief
[26:42] testimony i said dad i said you had your
[26:44] experience in 1983 when i was three
[26:46] years old
[26:47] where the holy ghost met him in the
[26:48] prayer closet and he said it swept into
[26:50] the room
[26:51] it made him run up to his bed and when
[26:53] he landed on the bed the holy spirit
[26:54] smacked his feet it went through his
[26:56] chest
[26:57] his whole body he felt like he never
[26:58] smoked a cigarette in his life
[27:00] but then the day after he went in the
[27:02] closet and said i don't need you anymore
[27:03] god i got my job back and he said that's
[27:05] where he made his mistake
[27:07] so i said dad you know what you got to
[27:08] do you got to go back in the prayer
[27:10] closet
[27:11] so we'll see but i said 40 years from
[27:13] 1983 is 2023.
[27:17] israel had to wait 40 years until they
[27:19] could go in the promised land
[27:21] so i said dad i don't know if it's next
[27:22] year or the year after
[27:25] i said one of these years our family's
[27:27] going to be restored i said you're going
[27:28] to take the promised land
[27:31] that's my belief anyway that's what i
[27:32] feel that of the lord i didn't i'm not
[27:34] speaking with thus saith the lord but
[27:35] that's what i feel
[27:36] because i believe god has shown me these
[27:38] things i preach these things
[27:40] and i'm trusting god to do it that
[27:41] that's my hope i never said that's
[27:43] thus saith the lord but that is my hope
[27:46] and it's beautiful just to see god
[27:47] vindicate
[27:48] it with brother cam and then with uh you
[27:50] know
[27:51] my dad himself so i thank the lord for
[27:53] that and please just read if you think
[27:54] of it just remember him in prayer church
[27:57] that god will finish the work he started
[28:00] you can switch over here i do have a few
[28:01] quotes here would like to
[28:02] share tonight just thought i'd share
[28:04] that testimony
[28:06] and to me that is a great testimony
[28:08] praise god to me that is a great
[28:09] testimony
[28:10] let me lock this in here because i'm
[28:11] having trouble
[28:13] is it not going over
[28:16] maybe oh i think i probably got the
[28:17] wrong cord here
[28:22] no here let me switch ones and it should
[28:24] be the regular one which it which one is
[28:25] the regular one the tv
[28:28] pc okay there we go thank you
[28:33] sorry about that all right so let's look
[28:35] here to the word of god tonight you love
[28:37] the lord tonight
[28:38] amen hallelujah i love him with all my
[28:40] heart praise god
[28:41] let's look at job here tonight and my
[28:42] thought for tonight was this is what the
[28:44] saints really like just this idea of
[28:47] perf perfection in heaven we're perfect
[28:49] in heaven but we're still
[28:51] imperfect on earth so let's look at this
[28:54] thought here and uh
[28:55] by god's grace we'll minister here and
[28:58] and that's how we want to uh start 2021
[29:01] right we want to remember
[29:02] god has made us perfect in heaven while
[29:04] we battle our imperfections on earth
[29:06] so i don't want to forget that praise
[29:07] god so uh we look open up this book what
[29:10] a beautiful book
[29:11] job is um and you know we start with the
[29:14] heavenly courtroom
[29:16] you know heaven is such an amazing place
[29:18] we looked at it last week remember we
[29:19] looked at last week there's a there's
[29:21] the all there's all the courts that
[29:22] moses built right
[29:23] you have the outer court you have the
[29:25] sea of glass and the outer cart
[29:28] israel stands on that after the 144 000
[29:30] are sealed with the holy ghost
[29:32] they stand on that in heaven then closer
[29:35] in the holy place
[29:36] you have the altar of incense in heaven
[29:38] the souls under the altar
[29:40] are the jews right so thus saith the
[29:42] lord brother ram said the fifth seal
[29:43] the souls are the altar of the jews you

[30:32] and jesus sits there on the throne
[30:34] making intercession for you and i praise
[30:36] god
[30:37] but we know in heaven you know we know
[30:38] also that there is a
[30:40] uh there is constant activity remember
[30:44] it goes really fast in heaven
[30:45] really slow on earth the bible says
[30:48] there's a day when the sons of god
[30:50] come to present themselves before the
[30:51] lord and
[30:53] satan comes among them so notice
[30:56] god has a certain time period where
[30:58] every demon
[30:59] has to come and report before him
[31:03] he's in control of everything praise god
[31:06] he's in control of heaven and i'll say
[31:08] like this he's in control of
[31:09] earth he's in control of this bride he's
[31:12] in control of your life as well amen
[31:14] nothing gets by god because he's in full
[31:17] control
[31:18] of every activity praise god remember
[31:20] that satan couldn't even touch job
[31:22] he couldn't even he couldn't even get
[31:24] through any heads the hedge was so
[31:25] strong
[31:26] he couldn't even get any close why
[31:28] because god was protecting him let me
[31:30] say
[31:30] thank you jesus for protecting me in
[31:32] 2020 amen
[31:35] oh yeah i got the hedge went down a
[31:37] little bit i got a little coronavirus
[31:38] but then the hedge came back
[31:40] thank you for that praise god amen
[31:43] uh you know the bible says he's he's my
[31:46] god that heals all my diseases
[31:48] praise god so see that he let the hedge
[31:51] back
[31:51] satan come in for a little bit but then
[31:53] he kicks satan out and the hedge is set
[31:55] up again praise god
[31:56] i've been sick since then that was
[31:58] november praise god i haven't been sick
[32:00] since then see god
[32:01] sets a hedge about his people but every
[32:05] demon in the heavenly realm
[32:08] has to come and present themselves
[32:10] before god and god said to satan god
[32:13] kind of uh challenges satan he says
[32:15] whence cometh thou
[32:17] and satan answered the lord and said
[32:18] from going to and fro in the earth
[32:20] and from walking up and down it so
[32:24] god or jesus asks every demon what
[32:26] you're doing
[32:28] what are you doing right because they
[32:31] have to answer
[32:32] praise god they believe in the lord and
[32:34] they tremble can you imagine the bible
[32:35] said they'll tremble there in the
[32:36] friends of god
[32:38] he said what are you doing devil he says
[32:40] i'm just walking around the earth and
[32:42] i'm just seeking whom i may devour right
[32:45] that's what he does
[32:46] right and he can't lie in that presence
[32:49] amen
[32:50] he can lie to you he can lie to me but
[32:52] he can't lie in that presence amen
[32:54] hallelujah
[32:58] and so god commands him and tells him
[33:00] what are you doing
[33:02] you must tell me of course he knows too
[33:04] and that isn't that funny
[33:06] he also knows already he knows what
[33:08] they've been doing because he knows all
[33:09] things
[33:10] amen and so we know the story
[33:13] but i want to uh remember the bible said
[33:16] be sober be
[33:17] vigilant because your adversary the
[33:19] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[33:21] sinking whom he may devour so peter
[33:23] plainly says
[33:24] god knows what satan's doing all the
[33:26] time but we don't
[33:29] right we don't always know so
[33:32] i don't want you to get too relaxed
[33:33] tonight i want you to be happy
[33:36] i want you to rejoice but i want you to
[33:37] leave out of here sober
[33:39] and vigilant amen because god knows
[33:42] what's going on
[33:43] and god won't let anything happen to us
[33:45] without his permission
[33:47] but at the same time we are told uh that
[33:50] we must be careful
[33:51] on the earth because there's lions
[33:53] waiting around corners
[33:55] waiting to devour us praise god
[34:00] we we're not here without an enemy now
[34:03] i'll tell you like this many times god
[34:04] gives us peace right we've had such a
[34:06] season of peace we talked about that
[34:07] really man do we
[34:08] we since god has driven away some of
[34:10] these contrary spirits out of our church
[34:12] we have had such a season of peace and
[34:14] that's scriptural asa
[34:16] had 10 years of peace because he he
[34:18] broke down every idol
[34:19] he cleaned out the house of god he drove
[34:21] out every demon out of the kingdom
[34:23] praise god
[34:24] and the bible said he didn't fight one
[34:25] battle for 10 years
[34:27] amen think about us how we can have
[34:29] seasons of peace praise god
[34:31] we drive out every demon power we pray
[34:33] it out
[34:34] we preach it out praise god and god
[34:36] gives us peace
[34:38] but we must remember we're still in the
[34:40] battle
[34:44] the bible said as a roaring lion satan's
[34:46] there walking about
[34:47] seeking who whom he may devour see satan
[34:50] wasn't lying to god that's exactly what
[34:51] he
[34:51] does go around the earth trying to get
[34:53] brother amen trying to get me and trying
[34:55] to get
[34:56] different ones of us right he's seeking
[34:58] him he's waiting like he's
[34:59] pouncing he's getting ready to pounce
[35:01] right but i thank god many times when he
[35:03] tries to pounce for the amen he hits
[35:04] that invisible wall
[35:06] that hedge of protection amen he can't
[35:09] go beyond that hallelujah thank god amen
[35:13] he couldn't get naomi right right with
[35:15] the the coven
[35:17] amen the hedge of protection hallelujah
[35:20] thank god see they try to get it they
[35:23] try to bring fear right they try to
[35:25] bring
[35:25] discouragement he tries to bring all
[35:27] these things church
[35:28] but if god says stop the devil has to
[35:31] stop amen
[35:32] hallelujah see he's trying to devour or
[35:36] consume
[35:37] our fruits of the spirit right he's
[35:40] trying to spoil the house
[35:42] and all the blessings in the house but
[35:45] the bible said resist him steadfast that
[35:48] means oppose him
[35:49] right stand against him fight against
[35:52] him praise god
[35:53] resist him steadfast in the faith praise
[35:55] god what is faith a revelation
[35:58] resistant with revelation amen god see
[36:01] god revealed to me this god told me this
[36:03] so you're wrong devil praise god
[36:05] the word of god says this so you're
[36:07] wrong i'm resisting you with the word of
[36:10] god
[36:12] and we remember the same afflictions are
[36:14] accomplished in your brethren all around
[36:15] the world
[36:16] i'm not the only preacher battling
[36:17] things right preachers all around the
[36:20] world are battling what i battle
[36:22] little churches big churches right
[36:25] it doesn't matter right there's some
[36:26] there's another little preacher you know
[36:28] little church preacher who's bound the
[36:30] same things i am satan's trying to
[36:32] devour him
[36:33] the same way he's trying to devour me
[36:35] but the same god that protects him
[36:36] delivers him the same guy that will
[36:38] deliver me
[36:40] he'll protect me see remember we're not
[36:43] the only ones
[36:44] we're not to have a pity party although
[36:47] i was called pitiful last week
[36:49] i'm not having a pity party praise god
[36:52] remember believe the sign people call or
[36:53] no i'm sorry joseph people call me a
[36:55] beautiful human being last week oh my
[36:58] although they say i'm pitiful uh i'm
[37:02] not i'm trusting in the lord jesus
[37:03] christ amen
[37:05] i don't i don't i don't want to pity
[37:07] myself i want to be thankful in
[37:08] everything
[37:09] and the peace of god that passes all
[37:11] understanding will protect my heart and
[37:13] mind
[37:14] through christ jesus i don't feel sorry
[37:17] for myself we have so much to be
[37:18] thankful for praise god
[37:20] we just must we just must continually
[37:22] hunger and thirst for righteousness i
[37:24] want to be more like jesus
[37:26] i don't need more like the book of acts
[37:27] church i want to see god win souls
[37:29] because he that's wise win souls amen
[37:32] god give us some wisdom more wisdom
[37:34] praise god
[37:35] to win souls even though there's less
[37:36] and less but being saved the church is
[37:38] getting
[37:38] smaller and fewer and fewer god has to
[37:41] shorten the days so that
[37:43] some elect might be saved help us to
[37:45] find some of those a couple of those one
[37:46] of those
[37:47] however there are many are left let's
[37:49] ask god to give us wisdom to find them
[37:55] and then in job 2 again there's a day
[37:57] when the son of sons of god came to
[37:59] present themselves before the lord and
[38:00] satan came among them
[38:01] to present himself before the lord see
[38:04] when god says all the devil's got to
[38:05] come back
[38:06] they got to come back right they've got
[38:08] to come on the day god says it
[38:10] and the lord said once cometh thou satan
[38:12] answered the lord going
[38:14] to and fro in the earth walking up and
[38:17] down it
[38:18] now i just heard a preacher say this
[38:21] this week if you want to listen to the
[38:22] sermon i'll let you listen to it
[38:23] it's a great a great sermon but i want
[38:26] you to notice
[38:27] how did god vindicate job to the devil
[38:30] was it by signs wonders and miracles
[38:32] look at all the miracles job did
[38:35] no because anybody can do that workers
[38:37] of iniquity can do that
[38:38] where's bang bang oh i'm sorry you must
[38:40] be out there i should have said that one
[38:41] thing
[38:42] i was saying i want to talk to thank you
[38:44] so bang and i talked to a preacher right
[38:46] and this preacher went to pentecostal
[38:48] churches and they have gifts
[38:49] where that preacher can just lay his
[38:51] hand on someone's forehead and they fall
[38:53] out and they get healed
[38:55] that's beyond any gift i've had right as
[38:56] far as like maybe i prayed for a few
[38:58] people like that and they passed out and
[39:00] healed them
[39:01] but not many i guess this guy just does
[39:02] it like automatically
[39:04] that's a great gift of god the bible
[39:07] said there's man there's one spirit
[39:08] there's many gifts there's many
[39:10] different operations of the gift
[39:12] praise god and that brother will have to
[39:15] answer
[39:16] not just for the gift but for the
[39:18] doctrine as well and that's where i feel
[39:20] real safe right there
[39:22] praise god i'm i'm telling the sisters
[39:24] to dress holy not cut your hair
[39:26] the men not to cuss and stay faithful to
[39:28] your wives right
[39:29] get the holy ghost live have temperance
[39:31] godliness patience and all these things
[39:33] don't smoke don't become a
[39:34] drug addict you know thank god don't put
[39:37] sinful things before your eyes amen
[39:40] so i'm thankful that our doctrine is
[39:41] right because i i i'll thank the lord
[39:44] for that
[39:45] but i want you to notice god vindicates
[39:48] job to satan
[39:50] because he has integrity and he's
[39:52] obedient to the word of god the same
[39:55] thing for you and i
[39:56] church let me tell you it's a greater
[39:59] miracle
[40:00] that you hate evil than if you could
[40:02] raise a physically dead person
[40:04] amen praise god it's a greater miracle
[40:08] if you can
[40:09] turn down sin on your phone or sit at
[40:12] the moving theater right
[40:13] or sin in your mind it's a greater
[40:15] miracle to turn down that
[40:17] it'll move devils faster praise god
[40:20] than any dead person you could raise
[40:22] from the dead because that's what god
[40:24] says that's his proof that job is the
[40:26] most holy man
[40:27] because he hates evil he loves me he
[40:30] worships me
[40:30] and so the vindication is a pure heart
[40:33] that loves holiness and hates sin
[40:38] praise god so what should be the
[40:41] vindication that that brother's a real
[40:43] preacher
[40:44] he preaches against sin and he lives a
[40:46] godly life
[40:47] now we will have these signs following
[40:49] us from time to time praise god thank
[40:50] god for that
[40:52] these signs will follow them that
[40:53] believe praise the lord
[40:55] but god when he vindicates someone to
[40:57] satan he says
[40:58] look how he hates you amen
[41:02] praise god amen he says
[41:05] satan will try to accuse me this is what
[41:06] i believe i hope is happening in heaven
[41:08] right now
[41:09] if not just a few moments ago well jesse
[41:11] did this just nope
[41:12] jesse is under the blood and jesse hates
[41:15] your temptations
[41:17] he's tired of it and he wants to go come
[41:19] to home to heaven when he's ready and
[41:21] done
[41:22] he wants a new body praise god where he
[41:24] don't have that sin nature in him
[41:26] anymore
[41:27] he hates evil he loves righteousness
[41:31] so god said to satan has you have you
[41:32] considered my servant job
[41:34] that there's none like him in the earth
[41:36] let me volunteer
[41:37] job for a test because mother
[41:40] said job was tested right and that's
[41:44] that's
[41:44] that's clear the bible says uh we're all
[41:47] tested like
[41:48] silver in the furnace remember seven
[41:51] times
[41:52] it must be passed through seven times
[41:53] and then it's made perfect
[41:55] we're all likened unto a medal that has
[41:58] to go through the fire
[41:59] the fiery trials of your faith
[42:03] is more precious than gold that
[42:05] perisheth
[42:06] amen life is a test life is a proving
[42:10] grounds
[42:10] amen to prove that we truly love jesus
[42:14] he's number one in our lives and our
[42:16] hearts are pure before god almighty
[42:18] that's what life is it's a test of our
[42:20] purity
[42:22] praise god have you seen
[42:26] job a message believer like him in the
[42:28] earth a perfect message believer
[42:30] upright one that fears god and hates
[42:32] evil
[42:34] and he holds fast as integrity now at
[42:36] this point he'd only lost his children
[42:38] well i should say only but you know he
[42:40] lost ten children can you imagine that
[42:42] seven boys three girls
[42:45] he lost all ten children he lost some
[42:48] servants right
[42:48] he lost all of his 401k which was five
[42:52] million dollars i worked it out one time
[42:54] he lost five million dollars he lost all
[42:56] of his children all he had left
[42:58] was his wife that's all he had left
[43:02] i'm sorry there was one servant that
[43:03] came back right with the news
[43:05] so he lost many servants remember the
[43:07] sabians came and the
[43:08] chao deans come in and destroyed
[43:10] everything took all of his took
[43:12] everything
[43:13] and so still after that what'd he say he
[43:15] said the lord gives and the lord takes
[43:17] away
[43:18] blessed be the name of the lord amen
[43:22] so he feared god and still he holds fast
[43:26] his integrity remember his wife said
[43:28] curse god and die
[43:29] he said speaketh like a foolish woman
[43:32] i'll speak us like a foolish virgin
[43:34] right although thou movest me against
[43:36] him to destroy him
[43:38] without cause
[43:42] so we see here is just a a tremendous
[43:44] picture
[43:45] now i want you to notice as we go along
[43:46] here job is strong at the beginning
[43:50] like a lot of us oh we got something bad
[43:53] happen right away oh that's the devil
[43:55] oh devil i'm going to overcome it i'm
[43:57] going to be healed right
[43:59] or oh god's going to change the
[44:00] situation but give it a few days
[44:03] give it a few weeks jobs turn into
[44:06] months the bible actually says
[44:09] months he said oh if i could go back to
[44:12] the months
[44:13] where my children sat at my feet and the
[44:16] glory of god was upon my head
[44:18] like oil and all the men came rushing to
[44:22] me and were silent
[44:23] until i spoke oh if i could just go back
[44:27] in
[44:27] all these months most of our months
[44:30] search
[44:30] are pretty good right when was the last
[44:33] time you had a huge trial that lasted
[44:35] months
[44:36] months i was sick two weeks maybe
[44:40] and just the fever just lasted one one
[44:41] or two three days whatever
[44:43] i cannot remember but months
[44:48] january february march april may just
[44:51] months
[44:51] almost a year
[44:55] and so he starts off strong like we do
[44:59] but then satan knows how to work and
[45:02] wear us down
[45:05] he knows how to just keep throwing
[45:06] things at us so pretty soon we our
[45:08] our arms get tired to hold up the shield
[45:10] right
[45:11] all right we get tired of it pretty soon
[45:14] church we just lay down right
[45:18] lay down i can't fight anymore and
[45:20] that's when the evil confession starts
[45:23] that's when the doubts start right
[45:25] because we're no longer chopping them
[45:26] away
[45:28] then we start saying maybe i did
[45:30] something wrong
[45:32] maybe i'm not saved maybe that person's
[45:35] not saved you know or whatever
[45:37] you know we start saying things we would
[45:40] not have uttered before
[45:41] maybe god doesn't love me
[45:44] maybe god doesn't care maybe there is no
[45:47] god for some people
[45:49] see but right away the lord gives the
[45:52] lord takes away i go to the house of god
[45:53] worship praise god
[45:55] but give it a few months give it a few
[45:58] months
[45:58] or give it a few years give it a few
[46:02] years
[46:04] this is what i want to do i want to be
[46:07] so strong
[46:07] in my spiritual exercise that i can
[46:10] battle the devil for a couple weeks or
[46:12] months or years at a time praise god
[46:14] praise god jesus was
[46:17] praise god amen 40 days without eden yet
[46:21] spiritually it was
[46:22] his body was weak but spiritually he was
[46:24] exercising that whole time
[46:25] and when satan offered the kingdom
[46:27] without going to the cross he was able
[46:29] to say no
[46:30] it is written thou shalt not worship
[46:32] allah shall only worship the lord thy
[46:34] god amen
[46:36] and he's almost sagging he's so tired
[46:38] he's almost staggering
[46:39] and then finally when satan leaves he
[46:41] goes down and the angels come and
[46:42] minister to him
[46:44] but spiritually he was so strong all he
[46:46] could say was it's written
[46:47] it's written it's written i will not
[46:50] defile my mind i will not define my body
[46:52] see
[46:52] he was strong in the face god help us to
[46:55] be strong in the faith
[46:58] no matter the trial that comes will be
[47:00] strong we'll be able to battle the devil
[47:03] and drive him off
[47:06] paul was strong right at the end he was
[47:07] in the prison but he said he said oh
[47:09] death where
[47:10] is your sting amen oh great where is
[47:12] your victory he said
[47:14] he said i know i fought the fight i
[47:17] finished
[47:17] my faith i've kept the course and i know
[47:20] there's a crown of righteousness
[47:21] awaiting for me
[47:22] and not just me but all those that love
[47:25] god's appearing
[47:26] amen praise god
[47:30] the spirit that's why we gotta read our
[47:31] bible and pray every day it's spiritual
[47:32] muscle building
[47:34] i'm amazed my brother got he got some
[47:36] pretty big muscles
[47:37] but that's because he works out for two
[47:38] hours a day
[47:40] that's pretty good that's pretty great
[47:42] you know my little brother i'm saying
[47:43] you know
[47:45] it takes two hours a day now if those
[47:46] natural muscles take two hours a day
[47:49] how much spiritual muscles are we gonna
[47:50] get if we're working out
[47:52] how long are we working out how long do
[47:55] we
[47:55] really listen to the sermon how long do
[47:58] we really pray or read our bible praise
[48:00] god see
[48:00] we want to be strong and the bible
[48:02] actually says that exercise
[48:04] exercise yourself more into godliness
[48:07] right the bible says that paul says that
[48:09] exercise he said god
[48:11] he said bodily exercise prophets a
[48:13] little he said but spiritual exercise
[48:15] profiteth both now for this world and in
[48:18] the world to come
[48:20] so god help us to be spiritually
[48:22] exercising
[48:23] some people are so weak spiritually and
[48:25] naturally they come to church and they
[48:26] just sleep the whole time
[48:29] see they've they've overworked their
[48:30] body and they're so they've overworked
[48:32] their body
[48:33] all they can do is come here and sleep
[48:34] in the presence of god
[48:36] i appreciate that they have peace enough
[48:38] to sleep here i appreciate that
[48:40] right i appreciate they're not being
[48:42] tormented by devils here right
[48:44] but the fact is that when the preaching
[48:46] of the word is life
[48:49] it's spiritual life it's god's waters
[48:51] flowing out and they're so
[48:53] they're so weak spiritually they can't
[48:55] even come up to the well
[48:56] and take a drink because you've got to
[48:58] pull on the word of god in other words
[49:00] you've got to come up and you've got to
[49:01] take a drink cup
[49:02] and you got a drink praise god i can't
[49:05] do it for you nobody can do it for you
[49:07] you've got a pole you've got to pull on
[49:08] the well praise god
[49:10] and i'll just use the illustration
[49:11] praise god you've got to pull in the
[49:13] water
[49:14] and then you've got to drink because so
[49:15] so many people are so weak and tired
[49:17] physically spiritually not exercising at
[49:20] home spiritually speaking
[49:22] that they come to the house of god and
[49:23] they're too weak to receive anything
[49:25] from god
[49:27] god have mercy but there will be no
[49:30] excuses on that day church
[49:32] we've had the message on our phones
[49:34] we've got message books we got bibles
[49:36] everywhere
[49:36] the now the bible will read it to you
[49:38] praise god
[49:40] you know you got to read it yourself and
[49:42] they'll dramatize it like with the right
[49:44] voice a male or female have music behind
[49:46] it and all the
[49:48] sound effects we got no excuses in this
[49:51] hour
[49:53] so when people are that weak it shows
[49:54] they're not exercising spiritually at
[49:55] home
[49:57] see now i spent a long time on that
[49:59] slide but anyway
[50:01] i just want you to see if god loved
[50:04] daniel surely he loved job
[50:08] daniel all's daniel did was fast and
[50:10] pray he said god i just wonder
[50:12] i want to understand prophecy where we
[50:13] are in the things of god
[50:15] so i'm going to fast and pray for that
[50:17] and the angel came and said
[50:19] i'm come to show thee for thou art
[50:21] greatly beloved
[50:22] amen praise god right daniel
[50:26] the devils are trying to accuse daniel
[50:27] the dead the devils in heaven
[50:29] actually uh anointed those men to try to
[50:31] put daniel in the lines then
[50:33] it was they had to get permission from
[50:35] god but the angel comes out and says
[50:38] listen daniel
[50:39] you you know i've we've heard your
[50:41] prayers heaven loves you
[50:43] so heaven is gonna send your answer but
[50:45] it had to get through all that heavenly
[50:47] uh that heavenly realm there's much
[50:50] battles going on there in the heavenly
[50:51] realm
[50:52] heaven loves you keep praying i'm going
[50:54] to send the answer keep believing
[50:56] heaven's going to win this war praise
[50:58] god
[51:00] oh don't be discouraged church if god
[51:03] loved daniel surely he loved job
[51:05] surely he loves you twice more he says
[51:08] it
[51:08] he says it three times as a vindication
[51:11] that heaven loves daniel
[51:15] he said oh man a man greatly beloved
[51:17] understand the words that i speak now
[51:19] unto thee
[51:20] verse 19 oh man greatly beloved
[51:24] fear not so see what the holy spirit's
[51:26] saying heaven loves you
[51:27] understand heaven loves you be strong
[51:30] don't be afraid
[51:31] see that's what love does love tells you
[51:34] don't be afraid
[51:35] love tells you understand this i want
[51:37] you to know this
[51:38] love is is meets all the law love
[51:41] fulfills every commandment praise god
[51:43] love drives out fear loves gives
[51:45] strength love meets every need if we
[51:47] just love god
[51:48] and realize how much he loves us
[51:54] i just thought that was beautiful now
[51:55] you remember the scripture the bible
[51:56] said twice
[51:57] paul calls us dearly beloved here but
[51:59] then he tells us in first corinthians as
[52:01] well
[52:02] therefore my dear brother dearly beloved
[52:04] and long form my joy and crown
[52:05] stand fast in the lord my dearly beloved
[52:08] and i'm not going to really deal with
[52:09] the bickering part of that
[52:10] but again just showing how you and i are
[52:12] dearly beloved heaven loves us
[52:14] praise god heaven loves you and we gotta
[52:18] and we have to stay in more contact with
[52:19] heaven
[52:20] through prayer right prayer without
[52:22] ceasing through worship
[52:24] stay in contact with the heavenly wisdom
[52:28] of god
[52:30] so that means remember your favorite so
[52:31] i'm going to skip past that now
[52:33] getting back to this remember satan is
[52:36] accusing us before god
[52:38] day and night so remember it goes so
[52:40] fast there
[52:41] their days go way way faster than ours
[52:43] right wait wait
[52:44] way faster so satan comes the bible said
[52:47] day and night he and his demons just
[52:48] accuse us
[52:49] before god all the time the bible said
[52:52] the jews overcame him by the blood of
[52:54] the lamb now this is the jews in the
[52:55] heart in the future 144
[52:56] 000 and by the word of their testimony
[52:59] and love not their lives unto death
[53:03] all right so the only way to overcome
[53:06] all satan's accusations is to constantly
[53:09] apply the blood to your life
[53:11] jesus forgive me jesus i'm trusting you
[53:14] that you're forgiving me now
[53:15] i'm confessing my sins it's that simple
[53:18] right sometimes we make it so hard
[53:20] and i think if we made it simpler we'd
[53:22] be happier
[53:24] right we wouldn't all be down and
[53:25] discouraged about god because you know
[53:28] as soon as you confess and you mean it
[53:29] he forgives you
[53:32] i'm overcoming by the blood not by my
[53:34] works i'm overcoming
[53:36] i'm overcoming by the blood amen
[53:39] because the blood washes away all of our
[53:41] sins praise god
[53:44] so day and night in heaven
[53:47] demons constantly coming to accuse us
[53:51] but we overcome by the blood of the lamb
[53:54] praise god
[53:55] our testimony has to be unforgiven i
[53:57] confess that that's under the blood
[53:59] thank god we can say that church
[54:02] i put that under the blood and if you
[54:03] have it now is the time to put under the
[54:05] blood
[54:06] praise god now remember church i want to
[54:10] just show this that
[54:10] the demons behind the human kingdoms
[54:12] remember when jesus was born
[54:14] his tale uh satan drew a third part of
[54:17] the
[54:18] the the demons out of heaven right and
[54:21] cast him to the earth
[54:22] uh the dragon stood before the woman
[54:24] which is mary which was ready to be
[54:26] delivered for to devour her child as
[54:27] soon as it was born
[54:28] so it was satan and all of his demons
[54:30] that anointed herod
[54:32] uh to kill all those babies right
[54:36] in other words the battle from heaven
[54:38] came down to earth
[54:39] praise god and we are on the side of the
[54:42] heavenly kingdom praise god
[54:45] right and so we can recognize satan's
[54:47] kingdom by its
[54:48] attributes murder false accusation
[54:51] right all these attributes
[54:55] and so we we are and remember our battle
[54:58] is not against flesh and blood
[55:00] but spiritual wickedness in high places
[55:04] that's right so let's remember that
[55:06] praise god even that's why we can have
[55:08] mercy on our enemies
[55:09] because we know that human it really
[55:11] it's really not
[55:12] there it wasn't their initial thought it
[55:14] was satan's initial thought
[55:16] right it was satan's initial plan it's
[55:19] satan's kingdom we're fighting against
[55:21] and it's god's kingdom that can overcome
[55:23] satan's kingdom
[55:25] amen now just notice this here
[55:30] notice satan's power was behind pharaoh
[55:33] in the days of moses
[55:34] because god said i'm going to pass
[55:36] through egypt smite on the first board
[55:38] and against all the gods that's the
[55:40] demons
[55:42] of egypt i will execute judgment
[55:46] how is he going to do that by killing
[55:47] the firstborn of all these
[55:48] demon-possessed people
[55:50] right how is god going to execute
[55:53] judgment on their gods
[55:55] by making their servants sad
[55:58] right they're taking their firstborn
[56:01] that's how god was going to do it
[56:02] that's how closely sinners are connected
[56:05] to satan's kingdom
[56:06] but what about us we're so closely
[56:08] connected to god's kingdom amen
[56:11] hallelujah see satan's motivating
[56:15] the agenda today right the one world
[56:18] government the vaccines and all these
[56:20] things
[56:21] it's motivating all that one world money
[56:24] one world rome
[56:25] i showed you last week how the pope said
[56:27] it's okay to get the vaccine and the
[56:28] pope says
[56:30] they got to bring all the big companies
[56:31] together and figure out ways to get
[56:32] everybody jobs and money and prosperity
[56:35] the pope satan's behind that
[56:38] see we know that because he's behind all
[56:40] these human kingdoms
[56:44] now you remember this in zechariah
[56:47] satan's
[56:48] uh i'm sorry he showed zechariah joshua
[56:50] the high priest standing before the
[56:51] angel lord
[56:52] satan standing at his right hand to
[56:53] resist him
[56:55] and the lord said to say remember we're
[56:56] still in this heavenly courthouse right
[56:59] the lord said the lord rebuked these
[57:00] saints even the lord had chosen
[57:02] jerusalem rebuked thee is not this a
[57:05] bran plucked out of the fire
[57:07] so like this god called job a perfect
[57:09] man he calls
[57:10] joshua the high priest he's a firebrand
[57:14] amen he's like a stick that keeps the
[57:16] fire going
[57:17] he's that's how hot he is it's like he's
[57:19] living in that fire oh god help us to
[57:21] live in the holy ghost amen
[57:24] but now if you read on he had dirty
[57:27] garments on
[57:28] but i like god because god sees you what
[57:30] you're going to become
[57:32] not what you are right now praise god
[57:34] right
[57:35] he saw david as a king of israel
[57:39] when he's out there singing to the sheep
[57:42] lord is my shepherd he's singing the
[57:45] sheep
[57:46] but god sees him as a mighty king on the
[57:48] throne
[57:49] hallelujah that's what god sees us god
[57:53] sees us differently
[57:54] than we see ourselves amen
[58:00] so we got to remember that god sees us
[58:03] as our potential as
[58:05] his foreknowledge of what we're going to
[58:07] become
[58:09] that's why i don't feel bad when someone
[58:10] calls me a prayer warrior because i
[58:12] really know i'm maybe not yet
[58:13] but i'm going to be praise god i didn't
[58:16] hear you
[58:17] right i may not or someone says oh
[58:20] you're this or that
[58:21] and i know it ain't true right i'm a
[58:24] human
[58:25] but i see well compared to other people
[58:28] in other churches i may be
[58:29] praise god right so we got to take what
[58:33] god's word says about us
[58:34] that god which started a work in us will
[58:37] be faithful to complete it
[58:41] god's gonna finish what he started in
[58:44] your life
[58:47] i could say amen to that for 2020 praise
[58:49] god it's your 20 21 sorry i'm nearby
[58:52] see because remember now look at the
[58:53] heavenly courtroom here paul says the
[58:55] jews
[58:56] judge themselves unworthy of everlasting
[58:58] life because they despise the lamb's
[59:00] testimony
[59:01] always let jesus testimony be on your
[59:03] lips jesus loves me
[59:05] jesus died for me jesus filled me with
[59:07] the holy ghost
[59:08] jesus forgives me praise god jesus heals
[59:11] me praise god
[59:12] amen see if we deny the testimony here
[59:16] it denies it in heaven
[59:19] and then say in has a he has rights to
[59:21] say this person
[59:22] this person does deserve an accusation
[59:25] but as long as we keep our testimony
[59:27] here i am faithful
[59:29] i am a holy ghost field saying i am a
[59:31] prayer warrior
[59:33] praise god i do love the bible i spend
[59:36] time with god amen
[59:39] all these truths praise god we must have
[59:41] the testimony right
[59:43] we must have the testimony of the blood
[59:45] of the lamb god's making me more
[59:46] diligent
[59:47] god's making me a more loving parent
[59:49] god's making me a more faithful worker
[59:51] on the job amen
[59:53] god's helping me understand my gifts
[59:55] praise god amen
[59:57] see judge ourselves by the blood of the
[1:00:00] lamb
[1:00:03] we overcome him by the lamb's testimony
[1:00:06] jesus is working on me
[1:00:07] he's not done with me yet he gave me a
[1:00:10] great 20 20 by god's grace
[1:00:12] he's going to give me an awesome 2021
[1:00:15] praise god
[1:00:16] a year where i can escape evil and have
[1:00:19] more integrity praise god
[1:00:23] he's going to make my character more
[1:00:24] like christ this year
[1:00:29] remember he's the high priest of your
[1:00:31] profession
[1:00:32] he can only do what you profess
[1:00:36] so what are we professing for 2021 what
[1:00:39] are we professing tonight
[1:00:40] god's gonna restore my family god's
[1:00:43] gonna help me win
[1:00:44] souls praise god god's gonna do signs
[1:00:47] miracles and wonders
[1:00:49] that's my testimony by the blood of who
[1:00:51] the blood of jesus now once you remember
[1:00:56] heaven's
[1:00:57] courtroom the bible says my little
[1:00:59] children
[1:01:00] i don't want you to sin if any man said
[1:01:02] we have a advocate
[1:01:04] with the father jesus christ the
[1:01:06] righteous
[1:01:07] so jesus is our lawyer praise god
[1:01:10] oh nobody can argue a case like him
[1:01:12] praise god no one's got
[1:01:14] knowledge like he does no one's got
[1:01:16] legal knowledge like he does
[1:01:18] because he was there praise god at the
[1:01:20] beginning praise god hallelujah
[1:01:22] he was the year and he founded the he
[1:01:24] founded the foundations of the earth
[1:01:26] praise god
[1:01:27] before the angels was there he was there
[1:01:30] praise god
[1:01:32] he knows all things and he's the
[1:01:35] propitiation he's the mercy seat for our
[1:01:37] sins
[1:01:38] he's the covering for our sins the
[1:01:40] protection
[1:01:41] he's our heads hallelujah
[1:01:44] and the sins of the whole world so see
[1:01:47] an advocate is like a judge a pleader a
[1:01:49] counsel for defense a legal assistant
[1:01:52] an advocate it's okay if you don't got
[1:01:53] the bible memorized jesus does
[1:01:56] which have you got the ohio revised code
[1:01:58] memorized
[1:01:59] if someone took you to court could you
[1:02:01] defend yourself absolutely not
[1:02:03] i say have mercy judge let me get on my
[1:02:06] phone i'll try to find a quick revised
[1:02:07] code real quick here
[1:02:09] oh but if you hired a an attorney
[1:02:12] oh i could just relax because the
[1:02:14] attorney is going to speak for me
[1:02:16] jesus speaks for you the bible said his
[1:02:19] bread
[1:02:19] speaks greater things than that of abel
[1:02:21] praise god not vengeance but mercy
[1:02:24] forgiveness power strength hallelujah
[1:02:27] his spirit is speaking for us tonight
[1:02:30] amen let the lawyer speak
[1:02:35] mr jesse smith what do you got to say
[1:02:37] for yourself you're accused of all this
[1:02:40] jesus go ahead praise god
[1:02:43] represent me said your honor
[1:02:46] he's speeding my case today oh the honor
[1:02:48] the judge is the same one as the
[1:02:50] the lawyer it's the same one praise god
[1:02:53] just a different manifestation
[1:02:56] hallelujah
[1:02:58] see he's pleading our case tonight
[1:02:59] arguably glad jesus pleads our case
[1:03:03] i have representation in heaven right
[1:03:08] now there's heavenly counsel just real
[1:03:09] briefly on this god is so humble look
[1:03:12] god is so humble he shares his power and
[1:03:14] it makes it look like
[1:03:16] he wants people's opinions now see if
[1:03:19] you can't take an opinion from somebody
[1:03:21] it shows you a lot of pride in your life
[1:03:23] because even god i said church even god
[1:03:27] can humble himself and take somebody's
[1:03:28] opinion now he knows what's the best
[1:03:31] we don't know the best but you can't
[1:03:33] take an opinion from your husband or a
[1:03:34] wife
[1:03:35] if you can't take opinion from the
[1:03:36] pastor you are in a prideful position
[1:03:38] for sure
[1:03:39] because god is so humble he says uh
[1:03:41] who'd like to go down there and
[1:03:43] how could i uh make ahab fall ramos
[1:03:46] gillian how how could i do that now he
[1:03:47] knows how
[1:03:49] but he's so humble he says who would
[1:03:50] like to go before us
[1:03:52] anybody got any good ideas out there
[1:03:54] this one says this this one has that
[1:03:56] and pretty soon a lying spirit comes up
[1:03:58] he says i'll go
[1:03:59] and god says okay i like that one right
[1:04:01] there
[1:04:03] look he's so humble so not only does he
[1:04:06] hear arguments
[1:04:07] court cases and evidence and all these
[1:04:09] things now he does he does that
[1:04:11] but he also he takes uh people's
[1:04:13] comments and the angel's
[1:04:14] ideas right because he's so he's so
[1:04:17] magnificent he's so humble
[1:04:19] see because all these angels are spirits
[1:04:21] they're ministers of flaming fire
[1:04:23] they're all servants to him
[1:04:24] they've all got to report to him they've
[1:04:26] all got to obey him praise god
[1:04:29] they're all limited although they're
[1:04:31] powerful they're all limited by almighty
[1:04:33] god
[1:04:37] now i want you to catch this church this
[1:04:40] thought came to me today
[1:04:41] paul caught the mind of the heavenly
[1:04:44] counsel of god for this brother who was
[1:04:46] sleeping with his stepmom
[1:04:49] right because satan cannot touch a hair
[1:04:51] of someone's head
[1:04:53] until god says it's okay this was a
[1:04:56] brother this was someone who was
[1:04:57] baptized
[1:04:58] in the name of the lord jesus christ but
[1:05:00] paul catches the mind i must have been
[1:05:02] an angel come and tell
[1:05:03] them amen praise god an angel must have
[1:05:06] come told go ahead and give this guy
[1:05:08] over to the satan let satan destroy his
[1:05:11] body
[1:05:12] that his soul might be saved in other
[1:05:15] words
[1:05:15] paul realized god said take the hedge
[1:05:17] off this man
[1:05:19] he won't repent of his sexual immorality
[1:05:22] take the hedge off him now we know he
[1:05:23] came back by god's grace
[1:05:26] right if you read second corinthians he
[1:05:27] said i'm sorry i made you he said i'm
[1:05:28] not really i'm sorry i made you
[1:05:30] sorrowful
[1:05:30] because it brought you to repentance so
[1:05:33] god removed the hedge
[1:05:36] right and let satan just go after him a
[1:05:37] little bit he says oh forgive me forgive
[1:05:39] me i'm so sorry
[1:05:40] he remourned he repented he said i'll
[1:05:42] never do it again i'll never sleep with
[1:05:43] my stepmother again
[1:05:45] and they welcomed him back in the church
[1:05:48] and then god said okay
[1:05:49] i'm putting the hedge back down on him
[1:05:51] now that's a god of love right
[1:05:53] amen that's a god i want to serve
[1:05:56] praise the lord you see sometimes church
[1:05:59] ministers or brothers or sisters will
[1:06:01] get the mind of god
[1:06:02] about what's going on in heaven
[1:06:05] right oh this person needs put out from
[1:06:07] under the blood
[1:06:09] that's a heavenly decision because now
[1:06:11] satan has free reign there's no more
[1:06:13] hedge on them
[1:06:14] we have to ask for the mind of christ in
[1:06:15] this hour
[1:06:20] i just thought i'd share that with you
[1:06:21] now i'm going to try to finish up here
[1:06:22] with this just a little bit more on
[1:06:24] job's life
[1:06:25] everybody love the lord
[1:06:30] now what struck me about job is a few
[1:06:32] things i like to share
[1:06:34] and here's what a brother said on that
[1:06:35] sermon i was listening he lives in north
[1:06:37] carolina he had some good points
[1:06:39] he said job was the ultimate christian
[1:06:41] businessman
[1:06:45] i thought that was such a good idea
[1:06:46] because he had all those goats you know
[1:06:47] the cattle and the sheep
[1:06:49] five million dollars worth he was such
[1:06:52] he was such a great businessman
[1:06:54] and in other words everything invested
[1:06:56] in huge gains
[1:06:58] he went to the stock market with a
[1:06:59] thousand he got a hundred thousand back
[1:07:02] he hit the jackpot and he kept doing it
[1:07:04] till he had five million dollars now
[1:07:05] that's wisdom right there
[1:07:07] financial wisdom but god bless
[1:07:09] everything he did
[1:07:10] everything he tried god blessed it
[1:07:14] god said he was the most holy man on the
[1:07:17] earth
[1:07:18] what a testimony there's none
[1:07:22] like job church i don't know about you
[1:07:24] but that's how we should want to be
[1:07:27] lord let me be the most holy person i
[1:07:30] can possibly be
[1:07:32] for your glory that's what paul says
[1:07:34] paul says don't run the race like you're
[1:07:35] going to lose
[1:07:36] he said run it like you're going to win
[1:07:39] praise god
[1:07:41] that means if i see myself slacking i
[1:07:43] see other people more spiritual
[1:07:45] or they're not stumbling over this but i
[1:07:46] am then we need to run harder praise
[1:07:48] you need to lay aside that weight and
[1:07:50] get some spiritual exercise going praise
[1:07:52] god
[1:07:54] see so in god's in god's sight he's now
[1:07:58] look at this
[1:07:58] in god's sight he has a he has a way to
[1:08:01] judge and place people by
[1:08:02] by how much they love god how much they
[1:08:04] hate evil and he knows who's
[1:08:06] number one on the spot oh that's what
[1:08:09] jesus
[1:08:10] that's a remember uh john and andrew's
[1:08:13] mom said oh we
[1:08:14] can can my son sit on your right hand
[1:08:16] left hand see there's a place for
[1:08:18] somebody there
[1:08:19] god knows who's gonna be on that right
[1:08:21] hand god knows who's gonna be in the
[1:08:23] left hand because god's keeping track of
[1:08:25] those who hate evil
[1:08:26] who love holiness praise god and that's
[1:08:29] how you
[1:08:30] gain that seat it's a reward
[1:08:33] of course the most humble people will be
[1:08:36] there
[1:08:38] but god looked at all the old testament
[1:08:39] saints he said there's job he's the high
[1:08:41] he's number one
[1:08:42] he's about he's more spiritual than all
[1:08:45] of them
[1:08:46] he doesn't let anything come on his
[1:08:48] phone he don't look at anything on his
[1:08:49] phone that shouldn't be on there praise
[1:08:52] god
[1:08:53] he doesn't gossip one thing about his
[1:08:55] sister brother not one
[1:08:57] and little little thing he did he went
[1:08:59] repented of it
[1:09:01] right because he's he's still a sinner
[1:09:02] saved by grace
[1:09:04] so god has a ranking a system in heaven
[1:09:06] like the bible said
[1:09:07] cornelius's prayers are recorded in
[1:09:10] heaven
[1:09:11] there's vials there's bowls there's
[1:09:14] bowls i shouldn't preach on this because
[1:09:15] i'll get
[1:09:16] spit in there but there's bowls that are
[1:09:18] filled up with prayers and almsgiving
[1:09:21] and god knows which one has the most
[1:09:25] right but if they do it god knows though
[1:09:28] if they do it just to be seen of men
[1:09:30] there's no heavenly it doesn't get
[1:09:32] filled up in heaven
[1:09:34] it's those that do it in secret that the
[1:09:36] lord rewards openly
[1:09:40] so what do you consider the most
[1:09:42] spiritual person today just like job
[1:09:45] he fears god he's perfect he's upright
[1:09:48] and he hates evil
[1:09:50] the most perfect man you could think of
[1:09:53] we look at arnold schwarzenegger he's
[1:09:55] like oh that's the perfect man that's
[1:09:56] not the permanent man
[1:09:58] he might be perfectly symmetrical in his
[1:10:00] muscles where he was
[1:10:02] but that's nothing it's whose heart is
[1:10:04] right before god
[1:10:06] whose life speaks of jesus jesus
[1:10:10] jesus jesus you know
[1:10:14] he's the most prosperous man he had the
[1:10:16] most beautiful family
[1:10:18] right he had loving servants he's a man
[1:10:21] of worship i love this that's what the
[1:10:22] one of the
[1:10:23] things the preacher said he didn't take
[1:10:24] his salvation of his children for
[1:10:26] granted he was so spiritual
[1:10:28] he didn't just say well you know my
[1:10:30] children are all older and moved out and
[1:10:32] i'm sure they're serving god he didn't
[1:10:34] he didn't
[1:10:35] you know they didn't have cell phones
[1:10:36] they couldn't talk and see how they're
[1:10:38] doing right
[1:10:38] so he said since i don't know i'm going
[1:10:41] to go to church more and i'm going to
[1:10:42] give more sacrifices i'm going to pray
[1:10:44] more for my children
[1:10:45] just in case they backslide
[1:10:49] i'm not going to take it for granted
[1:10:50] what i taught them in other words i'm
[1:10:52] not going to stop
[1:10:53] caring for my children i'm not going to
[1:10:55] stop praying for my dad or mom
[1:10:57] i'm going to keep praying offering
[1:10:59] spiritual sacrifices unto god
[1:11:01] because because if they backslide
[1:11:03] they'll have prayers there before the
[1:11:04] throne of god
[1:11:05] asking for mercy amen hallelujah
[1:11:09] what made him so holy
[1:11:12] he had eternal life he was living for
[1:11:15] others
[1:11:18] on his day off in his free time he made
[1:11:21] extra prayers for his children
[1:11:23] god help us to do that church that's why
[1:11:26] people get backside and call on god they
[1:11:27] stop doing any sacrifices to god
[1:11:30] they just get lazy and they just come to
[1:11:31] church and then god is just gonna
[1:11:33] keep blessing them if they just come to
[1:11:34] church well you gotta do more you gotta
[1:11:36] sacrifice
[1:11:37] more than just come to church you gotta
[1:11:38] exercise more than just in church
[1:11:41] praise god
[1:11:44] and i know i preach a hard sanctified
[1:11:46] holy ghost-filled message but that's how
[1:11:48] i want to live praise god amen
[1:11:49] i'm not perfect but that's how i want to
[1:11:51] live hallelujah
[1:11:54] now job's battle
[1:11:57] was with himself and then with a bunch
[1:12:01] of carnal believers
[1:12:03] a bunch of message believers that wanted
[1:12:05] to degrade him and accuse him
[1:12:08] and even even his sweet lovely wife she
[1:12:10] was she was carnal
[1:12:12] she got in the flesh and said just curse
[1:12:14] god and get it over just
[1:12:15] die and say there's no god i remember
[1:12:18] god had mercy on her she and eventually
[1:12:20] had 10 more children after that my
[1:12:22] brother
[1:12:22] makes it say that god brought those 10
[1:12:23] back from the dead it might be
[1:12:25] but i think when i read it it looks like
[1:12:26] he had just had 10 or 10 10 new ones
[1:12:29] that's what it looks like to me but i
[1:12:30] don't it could have been a miracle too
[1:12:32] that'd been quite a miracle
[1:12:34] but our god is great our god could have
[1:12:35] done that
[1:12:37] was he his battle battle was with met
[1:12:40] with people that used to trust him
[1:12:41] around the message
[1:12:42] but when he went through trials they all
[1:12:44] attacked him like see you're wrong
[1:12:45] you're wrong you're wrong you're wrong
[1:12:48] it's your fault you got secret sin that
[1:12:50] was the thing right
[1:12:52] you're hiding something the reason
[1:12:53] you're suffering is because you're
[1:12:55] hiding something
[1:12:56] but what did god say god said he's
[1:12:58] perfect praise god
[1:13:00] amen praise god see see church you and i
[1:13:03] should know
[1:13:04] the condition of our hearts if our
[1:13:05] hearts condemn us not amen
[1:13:08] even if other people condemn us we
[1:13:10] should be able to know the condition of
[1:13:12] our heart
[1:13:12] whether that's true or false and if it's
[1:13:14] false then say god give us strength i
[1:13:16] know i'm in the right help me to endure
[1:13:18] the fire
[1:13:20] then i'll come forth stronger and more
[1:13:23] pure help me to endure the fire
[1:13:25] praise god i'll say i just stand with me
[1:13:27] in the fire
[1:13:29] like shadrach meshach and abednego jesus
[1:13:31] come stand with me it's getting kind of
[1:13:33] hot
[1:13:33] all right come stand with me in the fire
[1:13:36] hallelujah
[1:13:39] george that's many times with our
[1:13:40] battles with carnal believers
[1:13:42] people that say they believe the message
[1:13:45] people that used to look up to us but
[1:13:46] now they criticize us
[1:13:49] they used to consider you a very
[1:13:50] spiritual and you might have been the
[1:13:52] messengers longer than them but now
[1:13:54] they criticize you well job had to stand
[1:13:56] before job had to stand up against that
[1:13:57] and so will we sometimes
[1:14:00] but don't be discouraged let your love
[1:14:02] for holiness let
[1:14:03] let your let let your character speak
[1:14:05] praise god
[1:14:07] don't argue back don't fuss let your
[1:14:09] character speak louder than your words
[1:14:12] now church just get your bible here
[1:14:13] let's just read this real quick job was
[1:14:15] such
[1:14:16] a sanctified saint go to job 29 here
[1:14:23] i'm not even sure how long i've been

[1:14:56] how job is
[1:14:57] he wasn't even living for himself really
[1:14:59] he was living for others
[1:15:01] 29 12 because i delivered the poor that
[1:15:05] cried and the fatherless and him that
[1:15:06] had none to help him
[1:15:08] so this is a guy that helped out the
[1:15:09] kids who had no dad
[1:15:11] people that would cry for food he'd go
[1:15:13] help him out
[1:15:15] verse 13 the blessing of him that was
[1:15:18] ready to perish came up
[1:15:19] upon me and i caused the widow's heart
[1:15:21] to sing for joy so widows that had no
[1:15:23] husband they had no
[1:15:24] food no money he would bring food and
[1:15:25] they'd shout hallelujah
[1:15:27] praise yahweh thank you jehovah jairo
[1:15:31] praise god
[1:15:32] he'd seen that he'd seen people rejoice
[1:15:36] oh god used me to help a poor person
[1:15:38] hallelujah thank you jesus
[1:15:40] this wasn't some make-believer church
[1:15:42] this is a man of god
[1:15:47] see now go down to uh let's do the next
[1:15:49] one here 31 chapter 31
[1:15:52] 24 25. see job talks you know this is
[1:15:56] i can't get through all of it but job
[1:15:57] talks here
[1:15:59] he's listening to his three friends uh
[1:16:02] and he says one more thing before elihu
[1:16:04] comes out
[1:16:06] barbara said that's a perfect type of
[1:16:09] christ
[1:16:10] elijah is a perfect type of christ
[1:16:14] 31 24 he says if i have made gold my
[1:16:19] hope or
[1:16:20] have said to mine gold thou art my
[1:16:21] confidence if i rejoice because my
[1:16:23] health was great and because my hand had
[1:16:25] gotten much
[1:16:30] now look at that even though he had five
[1:16:32] million dollars he didn't like rejoice
[1:16:33] when he saw that on his bank account i
[1:16:35] got five million
[1:16:36] we might take a screenshot i got that
[1:16:38] much money
[1:16:40] i can't believe it joe he's just like
[1:16:43] well praise the lord
[1:16:45] i'll keep doing what i'm doing i'll keep
[1:16:47] helping the widow i'll keep helping the
[1:16:49] poor
[1:16:49] i'll keep feeding this man i'll feed the
[1:16:51] poor
[1:16:53] god love this man job he said look he's
[1:16:55] a perfect man
[1:16:58] he didn't let his he linda let his bank
[1:17:00] account become his
[1:17:02] confidence he let jesus be his
[1:17:04] confidence we'll say like that
[1:17:06] for us verse 30
[1:17:09] now verse 29 if i rejoice at the
[1:17:12] destruction of him that hated me
[1:17:13] or lifted up myself when i when evil
[1:17:16] found him he even loved his enemies
[1:17:18] he felt sorry when his enemies had hard
[1:17:21] times
[1:17:23] he didn't curse his enemies praise god
[1:17:25] he blessed those
[1:17:26] who cursed him praise god it's a real
[1:17:30] man of god
[1:17:32] and verse 30 uh no that was it right
[1:17:37] yeah he loved it yeah verse 32. that's
[1:17:38] right
[1:17:40] the stranger did not lodge in the street
[1:17:42] but i opened my door so wow he had like
[1:17:44] a hotel in his house
[1:17:47] he didn't let the stranger go sleep on
[1:17:48] the street he took that money church and
[1:17:51] he used it he built himself a little
[1:17:52] hotel
[1:17:54] whenever somebody needs it they can have
[1:17:56] a hotel
[1:17:58] just giving you some idea is this a
[1:18:00] godly man or not
[1:18:02] godly man he overcame essential mind
[1:18:05] battles about
[1:18:06] pretty women look at verse chapter 31
[1:18:08] verse 1
[1:18:09] i made a covenant with mine eyes why
[1:18:11] then should i look what should i think
[1:18:12] upon and made
[1:18:14] look at verses nine and ten if my heart
[1:18:16] have deceived me by a woman
[1:18:17] or if i've laid weight at my neighbor's
[1:18:19] door
[1:18:20] see if i was flirting with the
[1:18:21] neighbor's wife then let my wife
[1:18:24] grind another and let others bow down
[1:18:27] upon her he said that i haven't done any
[1:18:30] of this
[1:18:31] i kept my mind right i kept my mind on
[1:18:33] god not on my money
[1:18:34] that's what the world does they put
[1:18:36] their mind on their money and their
[1:18:37] money on their mind right
[1:18:40] see this man was full of god's love
[1:18:43] this man was dedicated to the scripture
[1:18:45] this man loved holiness praise god this
[1:18:47] man was blessed
[1:18:48] this man was fruitful this man was
[1:18:50] prosperous
[1:18:53] he was sanctified but memory could not
[1:18:55] be filled to the holy ghost saints
[1:18:56] he must have been so up there right he
[1:18:58] must be right at the border line of
[1:18:59] brotherly kindness
[1:19:00] like almost ready to get to the top of
[1:19:02] that cup
[1:19:04] he was so close up there look at this do
[1:19:06] you see any fault in him
[1:19:07] not much this is the kind of
[1:19:11] man that god looks down and says that's
[1:19:14] a man
[1:19:15] that's a perfect man now don't raise
[1:19:18] your hands but how many think they could
[1:19:19] live closer to god after hearing that
[1:19:23] now i want to um i think i'll get back
[1:19:25] to this one here
[1:19:31] let's go down a little bit here this is
[1:19:32] uh i preached this recently but uh
[1:19:35] see now we know god saw job as
[1:19:39] perfect but it's possible remember
[1:19:41] brother branson said it's possible
[1:19:43] job's sin helped cause this trial
[1:19:47] right it's possible because what did job
[1:19:50] say
[1:19:51] job said in chapter three this is after
[1:19:52] he said the lord gives the lord takes
[1:19:53] away
[1:19:54] this is when he starts having mind
[1:19:55] battles
[1:19:57] this is when he starts cursing the very
[1:19:59] day he was born
[1:20:00] oh i wish my birthday was off the
[1:20:01] calendar
[1:20:03] i don't like when people celebrate my
[1:20:04] birthday but it's nice to see that i had
[1:20:06] a birthday praise god
[1:20:08] and i like to tell people tell me they
[1:20:09] love me who doesn't like to hear that
[1:20:10] but
[1:20:11] but job's like i cursed that calendar
[1:20:14] wish i never would have been born and he
[1:20:17] said the thing which i greatly feared is
[1:20:19] come upon me and that which i was afraid
[1:20:21] of has come unto me
[1:20:22] i was not in safety neither had i rest
[1:20:24] neither was i quiet yet
[1:20:25] trouble came look at this church
[1:20:29] job was faithful with all these things
[1:20:30] but in the back of his mind
[1:20:32] he had a battle with fear that he was
[1:20:35] going to lose everything
[1:20:37] so see part of his motivation was i
[1:20:39] better fear god because i might lose it
[1:20:40] all
[1:20:42] i'm scared i'm scared everything i work
[1:20:44] for i might lose it
[1:20:46] he was scared how many can relate to
[1:20:48] that
[1:20:49] oh look what god's given me god give me
[1:20:51] this home god give me this car god give
[1:20:52] me this family
[1:20:53] i don't want to lose it i can say amen
[1:20:55] to that i don't want to lose it
[1:20:58] but job said i greatly fear not this is
[1:21:00] not a little fear problem church
[1:21:03] this was a big fear problem are you with
[1:21:06] me tonight
[1:21:09] this is his own words i had a great
[1:21:12] fear mind battle and yet the god said
[1:21:16] god looks down and says
[1:21:17] that's a perfect man see god doesn't
[1:21:19] hold against your mind battles raise god
[1:21:21] hallelujah you now listen you'll have to
[1:21:23] suffer the consequences of your
[1:21:25] mind battles if you lose them right just
[1:21:29] like here
[1:21:30] you might have to suffer some
[1:21:31] consequences but heaven still sees you
[1:21:33] as perfect
[1:21:34] why because you're under the blood
[1:21:38] why was joe perfect because he was under
[1:21:40] the blood sacrifice
[1:21:43] brother ram said he met god's
[1:21:45] requirement
[1:21:46] amen what was god's requirement to bring
[1:21:48] a lamb praise god
[1:21:50] to bring a buddha to cover your sins and
[1:21:53] when he did that
[1:21:54] although he had the mind battle and it
[1:21:55] may have caused it god
[1:21:57] forgave him and said he's a perfect man
[1:21:59] he's trusting in my covenant
[1:22:01] he's keeping my words he's putting his
[1:22:03] sins under the blood let's do the same
[1:22:05] thing tonight praise god
[1:22:09] he wasn't perfect by his works although
[1:22:10] he had some really good works
[1:22:13] i'd put his life up against any brother
[1:22:15] i know in the message
[1:22:17] look at that list i just read who do you
[1:22:20] know that's done that
[1:22:21] well hopefully you don't because they
[1:22:22] kept it in secret right right
[1:22:27] i think i told you when simon was here
[1:22:28] simon i'd say would probably be the
[1:22:29] closest one
[1:22:30] that i know because i have the most
[1:22:31] contact with him i don't have the most
[1:22:32] contact with all of you
[1:22:34] you do things in secret but i have a lot
[1:22:35] of i have a lot of friends that know
[1:22:37] simon
[1:22:39] and then i hear some things he does so
[1:22:41] to me i'm not trying to exalt people but
[1:22:43] just understand like sometimes your
[1:22:45] works are done in secret but sometimes
[1:22:47] you can't hide them
[1:22:49] and you're like a city on a hill that
[1:22:50] cannot be hidden
[1:22:52] so church if you're really doing good
[1:22:54] all the time people are going to see it
[1:22:55] sometimes
[1:22:59] if that widow shot him for joy said
[1:23:01] hallelujah thank you joe
[1:23:03] don't you think the neighbors would have
[1:23:04] heard it
[1:23:06] i made the widow to joy and shout and
[1:23:08] praise the lord i got food and
[1:23:10] oh i got all these things and she shouts
[1:23:12] for joy
[1:23:14] somebody there's a lot echo in here i
[1:23:17] hope heaven's not going to
[1:23:18] i hope i'm echoing heaven praise god
[1:23:21] amen that's what i hope by god's grace
[1:23:23] that the lord wants me to say these
[1:23:25] things i hope you're being blessed
[1:23:26] tonight by god's grace
[1:23:28] see he didn't have a little fear problem
[1:23:30] church he had a great fear problem same
[1:23:31] thing we all battle
[1:23:33] right same thing we're all about them
[1:23:36] fear
[1:23:37] great fear and remember what brother
[1:23:39] brown said brother brahm said
[1:23:41] if he would what hap what brought his
[1:23:43] test brother bam said fear brought it
[1:23:46] we make it seem like job never sinned he
[1:23:48] did sin he had a fear problem
[1:23:51] right and it's possible this fear
[1:23:54] that he didn't take care of
[1:23:58] caused this to come upon him
[1:24:01] but let me say this did god deliver him
[1:24:02] from his fear yes
[1:24:05] absolutely did god overcome his fear
[1:24:08] problem
[1:24:10] oh yeah is god going to help you
[1:24:12] overcome your pride problem
[1:24:16] is god going to help you overcome your
[1:24:17] lust problem
[1:24:19] is god going to help you overcome your
[1:24:20] doubt problem your unbelief problem
[1:24:22] absolutely praise god if you're a child
[1:24:25] of god he will perfect
[1:24:26] that which concerneth you that's what
[1:24:29] david wrote david said i know
[1:24:30] god is going to perfect all these things
[1:24:33] that concern me
[1:24:34] in other words everything in my life
[1:24:35] everything that's concerning me god is
[1:24:37] going to use that
[1:24:38] to help me love it more and bring me
[1:24:40] into a perfection of a believer
[1:24:42] to help me reach my god-given potential
[1:24:47] he'll perfect that which concerns me
[1:24:51] see his fear brought it on him he was
[1:24:53] scared it was going to happen and it did
[1:24:54] happen
[1:24:57] see what i mean so see we can't exact
[1:25:00] job and say he never sinned he had to
[1:25:02] have sinned because he's under the blood
[1:25:03] of bulls and goats
[1:25:08] he says if you're afraid when you come
[1:25:09] into the prayer line he says it won't
[1:25:10] happen
[1:25:12] right so we got to have faith he said if
[1:25:14] you have a fear your disease is going to
[1:25:15] leave you it won't leave you
[1:25:17] if you have faith it will and the church
[1:25:19] said
[1:25:22] now let me go back here
[1:25:25] let me go back a little bit and i'm
[1:25:27] gonna close with this i set a timer i
[1:25:28] got
[1:25:29] uh four minutes can you bear with me
[1:25:30] four more minutes
[1:25:33] thank you
[1:25:36] now i'll probably preach on this maybe a
[1:25:38] little more sunday by god's grace but
[1:25:40] i just want to hit these uh main
[1:25:41] highlights here
[1:25:43] now this is what the saints really
[1:25:45] rejoiced over in uh
[1:25:47] uh napoleon maybe i preached it here
[1:25:50] before but
[1:25:50] i just want to remind you church that
[1:25:52] your soul is perfect in heaven
[1:25:56] heaven sees you as perfect right because
[1:25:58] it sees you
[1:25:59] as a complete person right
[1:26:02] it sees your finished state like joshua
[1:26:05] the high priest
[1:26:06] like job praise god god sees you as your
[1:26:09] completed product
[1:26:11] right right but we will battle
[1:26:15] imperfect flesh and mind on the earth
[1:26:18] right
[1:26:19] now look in the same letter look at this
[1:26:20] brother bank that struck me today i
[1:26:22] didn't see this before
[1:26:23] in the same letter he says if we confess
[1:26:25] our sins we're forgiven right we're
[1:26:26] familiar with that
[1:26:27] if we say we've not sinned we make him a
[1:26:29] liar
[1:26:30] so john starts off the book by saying if
[1:26:32] you don't if you if you don't admit your
[1:26:34] sin you're a liar
[1:26:36] but then in chapter 3
[1:26:39] he says whoever's born of god does not
[1:26:42] commit sin
[1:26:43] for his seed remains him and he cannot
[1:26:45] sin
[1:26:46] well which one is it am i a sinner or i
[1:26:48] do not sin
[1:26:49] it's bold praise god amen i sin in my
[1:26:53] flesh and mine
[1:26:54] but in my soul i cannot sin because
[1:26:56] god's nature
[1:26:58] lives in my soul my soul is god's nature
[1:27:01] it's a part of god amen
[1:27:04] that's why god could look down at job
[1:27:06] and say he's a perfect man
[1:27:08] yet he had fear problems right yet he
[1:27:11] worried about the future what's going to
[1:27:13] happen am i going to lose my job am i
[1:27:14] going to lose my kids
[1:27:15] which is normal
[1:27:18] but god could look and say satan ever
[1:27:20] seen a perfect man like that
[1:27:22] he's looking at his son see god's got
[1:27:23] confidence in your church
[1:27:25] god's got confidence you you're going to
[1:27:27] overcome satan hey come on somebody
[1:27:29] break up
[1:27:30] put on the armor of god and you overcome
[1:27:32] satan hallelujah
[1:27:34] put all the armor of god you overcome
[1:27:37] him he's got confidence
[1:27:39] because he he's the one that made all
[1:27:41] those weapons and armor pieces praise
[1:27:43] god
[1:27:45] he gave you just what you needed to
[1:27:46] overcome satan praise god
[1:27:48] you are not just partial conqueror
[1:27:50] you're more than a conqueror praise god
[1:27:53] hallelujah come on somebody we ought to
[1:27:55] be rejoicing in here tonight
[1:27:57] praise god he give you the armor give
[1:27:59] you the sword they give you the word
[1:28:01] he gives you a perfect soul that's
[1:28:02] always right before god
[1:28:04] we ought to rejoice in that praise god
[1:28:07] thank you jesus christ praise god
[1:28:09] hallelujah

[1:34:59] praise god to teach him lessons to teach
