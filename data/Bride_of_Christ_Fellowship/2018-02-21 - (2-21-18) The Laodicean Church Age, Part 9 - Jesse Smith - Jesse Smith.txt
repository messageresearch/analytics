Lord we commit our lives in your hands in Jesus Christ name the church said amen let's take our Bibles here let's go to Revelation chapter 3 verse 19 and we might get to verse 20 tonight by God's grace in revelation 3:19 this is part nine of the latest in church age I just want to make sure I cover everything in the church age book that really sticks out plus the sermon series from the prophets so we're just going to be real diligent about that so it's three revelation 3:19 let's read verse 19 and I'll read verse 20 so let's begin with verse 19 on three one two three as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent now read verse 20 behold I stand at the door and knock If any man so now he's calling to the individual If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and sup with him and he with me may God add the blessings the reading of his word may be seated by God's grace god bless you animalic I can switch over I do have some slides here elected share here so this is part nine like I said part 56 of this series we're familiar with a lot of these things here now just so you know I've been praying about and studying on these future series I'm building up some thoughts on these the one I just was four new to me this week I spent about four or five hours on Monday morning studying on that one here at the church because I had Monday off for President's Day so I want to look at a series on wisdom with proverbs and Ecclesiastes I like to look at the life of Christ because brother Graham said the bride's ministry must match Jesus's earthly ministry perfectly before the coming of the Lord before the rapture we look at a series on prayer I've talked about that leadership I've been looking at that some thoughts on that and then the believe the sign rebuttals I'd like to go over that too I also want to finish this series we've been working on church ages I'm trying to finish that one and I've had a leading to go back and finish the David series I left off after part 21 after Bathsheba I'd like to pick up there and kind of show kind of like the effects of the whirlwind like we looked at a few weeks ago and then I want to finish the book of Revelation I'm not sure where I left off on that and the Paul's Gospels I'm still in Ephesians and I'm waiting for a Sunday when I know everybody's going to be here except that the portion whereas in Ephesians 4 right at the fivefold ministry and I want to bring that message again except update it that message about should pastors preach or play tapes I want to bring that message again except I want to update it I want to show you exactly the things that people have said around this camp that you know they they say they believe every word brother Branham says but yet they want to cut off pastor so I want to show you some of the updaters I found five or six quotes maybe seven and it's just shocking to hear some of the things they say but anyways I want to bring that as well but I'm waiting on that waiting till you know everybody will be back from maybe winter and different you know all the weather problems you know I'm kind of waiting on that to preach that so just giving you a little insight where I've been studying lately I'm really excited about the wisdom series that I do want to get their prayers well some series on that but just want to update you on that now I want to continue from last Wednesday on this zeal and fervent look looking at these scriptures here and remember they're almost synonymous these two words are very similar they both deal with boiling up okay so we get this thought from be zealous therefore and repent so this will help us understand what does it mean to repent with zeal what does it mean and it means zeal means to desire earnestly to strive after to be heated to boil with Envy hatred of course we're not done evil that we're not doing the evil side of jealous we're doing the good side to pursue good so when you're really zealous for God you want to pursue doing the right thing with a lot of emotion with a lot of faithfulness you're boiling with I'm gonna do this and nothing is going to stop me that's real zeal for God so when you're zealous to repent you are going to show everybody you're gonna prove to the devil especially that you're not going to follow that sin next time you're free from that sin amen that's real zeal to repent that's what we need in our church that's what all of us need everybody the message everybody that's a Christian needs that because that's the that's the burden of our age now fervent of is very similar to boil with heat boiling anger so for us it's boiling love our love is boiling over hopefully you feel that tonight zeal for what is good you're just bubbling over with wanting to do good tonight hopefully that's how you feel because that's real fervency by the grace of the Lord you just you're but I just can't wait to do something well the RAM said that's one way you know you're laying your names on the Lamb's Book of Life when you see what's in the word you can't wait to do it he said I said that in the first seal he said that's one good sign that your name is on the Lamb's Book of Life you can't wait to do something for the Lord amen now we looked at some scriptures last Wednesday we looked at Phineas how he was zealous for God and God rewarded his family with the priesthood because he stopped the plague by throwing the spear through the belly of the the Israelite leader who was who was leading the charge with his immorality he was like the leader causing others to stumble we looked at G who last week he said watch my zeal remember and what he did is he killed all the Bayla mite worshippers he killed all a hab sons and all all their offspring he said watch my zeal and he had zeal for a while but then of his life he lost the zeal so that anointing left him now our zeal shouldn't be like that our zeal should be continual anointing because his life wasn't much better than he said the previous king the Bible said he was just he had a zeal for a little while but he let that anointing leave him instead of staying faithful to the Word of God sorry we looked at Jesus's zeal briefly for the house of God to clean out the house of God we should always have that zeal when we see anybody walking here instead of going up and telling them oh you shouldn't done that you should get on your knees and pray for them you should bow your head in your heart and say Lord this is a visitor minister to them by your Holy Spirit bring them to repentance you should pray this discern their hearts that they'll know God is amongst us amen if we know sit in somebody's life we ought to go to them individually right we know something's wrong with the pastor you need to talk to the pastor individually you know something's wrong with a deacon got talk to the Deacon individually right you know something's wrong with the sister of the piano player you need to go talk to them individually it's just as you're just as responsible as me or anyone else we're all responsible to keep the house of God clean and then we saw God zeal in Isaiah 6 that God was going to bring the Millennium to pass guardzilla do this if the government of the Messiah would be brought to the earth it's God's seal it's God's boiling love that's gonna bring the rapture the tribulation and then the Millennium God zeal is going to do that his love for his word and his promises and then I think we know we we looked at how Paul said be zealous but be zealous for the gifts that benefit the most people so our our biggest prayers are the the most boiling prayers we have is say God send a prophecy to the church send a prophecy so the church knows the future and so not just sister Connie knows her brother Jose knows but everybody in the church knows that's what we should be zealous for we should pray for those type of things it doesn't happen very much like we said we know it doesn't happen a whole lot I've only had a few in the whole years I've served the Lord of prophecies of different things that would happen just a few but we should pray for that our zeal should be invested in Lord bless all your people with the gifts of the Holy Spirit benefit everybody don't let just be the pastor the song leader or the sister who gets in the spirit of the brother gets in the spirit dance of the Spirit let it touch everybody praise God and then we saw this this is a zeal all of us can have Epirus had a zeal for the Church of the Colossians he constantly pray for them Paul said Paul said I've heard his prayers this man had a zeal he kept lifting up the church in prayer and I hope you have a zeal to pray for our church amen that's what we should have I have that I know I have of that I have that in fact you know when I was here Monday I was fasting and I was praying I was seeking God about that dream I had about brother remember that I finally had time to fast and pray about that on Monday I was seeking the Lord Lord show me the dream said I haven't sought you I feel like I have but if I haven't I'm and I laid here on my face and cried and prayed that God would show me so I'm still waiting on the Lord but I'm gonna take that dream and I'm gonna I'm gonna act on that dream my faith is gonna act upon the word that's been revealed to me so see we got to have a zeal we got to have if to show God that you mean business and then we ended last week by showing how our zeal has stirred up when we see disobedience and others when you see somebody smoking or here's somebody cussing or you see somebody you know doing something evil it should give you a zeal it should make you boil up in your love to do what's right for God amen that's why that's what Dave that's what David said David said seeing my enemies discount your word made me zealous for the Lord amen so see instead of you know if you see churches that don't honor the word anymore instead of self get upset with them let it be a motivation for you to do what's right for the Lord don't just stand there and criticize and say oh brother did you hear what this church did don't talk like that just give it more get let it give you more zeal so that you serve God better and maybe pray for them definitely definitely pray for them now let's continue this is all new I haven't gone over these now let's go to second with Ian 7-eleven let's go this this is familiar but let's read it again because we're on this topic of zeal if we need zeal to repent in this hour we better know what zeal looks like and that's how you get to know it by looking at the scripture st. Corinthians 7-eleven now if preach over and over again not a whole sermon on it but verse 10 it talks about godly sorrow worketh repentance to salvation not to be repented of so see you won't repent of that salvation once you're really saved you won't repent of that you'll keep that you don't you don't leave that you keep that salvation but the sorrow of the world works death separation death is separation it works separation from God for behold the self same thing that you sorrowed after a godly sort what carefulness it wrought in you yeh what clearing of yourselves yeh what Anglin yeh what fear yeh what the Hemet desire yeh what zeal yeh what revenge in all things you have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter now I preach this a few times over the last few months but just a reminder this shows what you must have if you really repented you must have a zeal and a revenge that you're going to get revenge on the devil the devil has tricked you you've fallen off the path but you've got spiritual revenge in your heart that you're gonna show him that's the last time he's gonna tempt you with that it actually cause you to fall the next time you're gonna cast it down in the name of Jesus amen that's real zeal but if somebody keeps compromising on this over and they keep falling they haven't got real repentance they haven't got really godly sorrow they haven't got real zeal for God yet and I had a brother called me up he left a voicemail he said brother Jesse's and I said you're one person I know and this is so strange he left me a message last night and he didn't even know I was preaching on zeal you don't even listen to my sermons he said if there's one person that got zeal brother Jesse he said it's you I know that's that's encouraging I'll go and preach on zeal that's a that's a good confirmation so see if we've done something wrong we have to make sure next time I'll be so strong spiritually Satan will be so far under my feet that I won't even turn to look twice at the temptation I won't even think twice about it because I'm walking in victory amen hallelujah now here this is a good thought for all of us zeal is good as long as it's channeled or invest in the good thing that's Galatians 4:18 let's go there Galatians 4:18 because we look at misguided zeal here at the end of this page but just remember Galatians 4:18 because I've said the quote hundreds of times here brother Branham said we can't let our zeal eat up our wisdom so we must have zeal in the right channel it must be at the right time the right season and Galatians 4 just literally states this which is really nice to read here now he's talking about how the Jews are having zeal for circumcision but Paul says it's good to have zeal for something that's good and not for legalism look at verse 17 they sell ously affect you but not well to see there there's some people that will be really zealous for something but they're off the word yeah they would exclude you that you might affect them so they're so zealous they'll kick you out of their fellowship if you don't do what they do right or follow their doctrines but it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing and not only when I am present with you what we could we could all use a lesson from that couldn't we we shouldn't just be zealous for God when we have a guest preacher here right that's what Paul say he said you just don't want to be zealous when I'm around you want to be zealous for Christ all the time you shouldn't be zealous just a church you should be zealous for God at home to your love of God should boil up all the time praise the Lord that's what he's saying here now just when the preachers around the prophets around or a deacon or whoever's around you at we should be zealous all the time for Christ amen I don't know I don't know how to but I can't get enough of it I stick my earbuds in on the drive and I listen all the time something about God some about Jesus if I can't I'm really tired I put this morning I put our music to lift me up so I'm really tired I know if I'm gonna get lifted up it's usually gonna be through song that's why God gave us songs to lift up our spirits is that right but if I'm rested rested put me on a good sermon there let me hear the preacher let me hear a mystery and the Word of God but if I'm tired like this morning put on that snappy gospel music amen all the time see in a good thing we must be zealous for good things not for wrong things now I'm going to skip that skip down and hit this since we're talking about a good thing I think it'd be better order if we go down here since we're closed the Galatians let's just go to Philippians turn a few pages to Philippians three six there now this is Paul's testimony you know he's talking about he was circumcised the eighth day he's going through all his fleshly requirements or I guess fleshly resume of what kind of a Pharisee he was and he said in verse six concerning zeal I persecuted the church touching the righteousness law blameless so no one kept legally the legalistic part law more than Paul no one was more zealous for the Word of God the Old Testament than Paul right and no one was more zealous than him because he persecuted the church he would drag people to jail that's how zealous he was now should we drag people to church physically no we'll get the cops caught on us but he had the government behind him he had Rome behind him he had letters to take Christians capture them take him to jail that's how zealous he was but this is what I'm pregnant for in my life because my grandfather at his funeral a couple years ago a preacher came up a Spanish preacher because my grandpa spoke Spanish he was Spanish least spanish-speaking I don't know we don't even know what our actual lineage is whether it's Mexican Spanish a Portugal we don't even know Native American it's hard to know anyways this preacher comes up he's an old man he's got gray hair and he said I want to tell you about Romero that's my grandpa's name Romero Garza he said when he said when I was a sinner I worked at the same factory as Romero my grandfather and he said Romero would come and chase me down every day at work and say aren't you gonna serve Jesus he said I got so tired of it that when I saw him coming he said he would jump in a trashcan like those big trash dump dumpsters and he would hide in there and sometimes my grandpa wouldn't see him he said but one time my grandpa did see him jump in the trash can so he peeked in the trash can those big dumps like we have out there those big dumpsters he said what are you gonna serve Jesus and that's zeal Church that that's the kind of zeal I want let's pray for that at the end of service how many would pray for me would pray for yourself that's what honestly that's what I want now I want to go to jail I don't like I don't get that I don't want the cops called on me but I do want to pursue people more with the Word of God and he stood there crying and he's thanking God I'm so glad Romero came after in other words chased me like a shepherd would as a sheep and now that man's been a pastor 40 years I don't know if he's still alive he's been a pastor 40 years there I think it was in Delta or Wauseon and all and look so see it wasn't my grandfather that was trying to do it it was Christ in my grandfather you see that it was the bird in other words my grandfather caught the heart of God and then he pursued after somebody else with the heart of God Simon said when he first heard the message he said the heart of God placed him after two people he said his my dad and me he said I knew Jesse would receive it and I never heard the message he said but God put the heart God put his heart on Simon's heart too bad for those two people first and what if I was me my dad recognized it but he you know he turned it out he's not living it yet but see that was God's heart right on my dad's heart now who wants somebody on their heart from God's heart that see that's what we need zeal we need to pray for that because this is Paul Paul said I would I would persecute him I would drag into jail well see we can't drag people to church but we should surely try to encourage people to come to church we should try to do so ours eel should move us to do something to invite the neighbor right invite somebody might your co-worker invite somebody we should have some zeal to try to win somebody to Christ program said if you don't have a zeal to win a soul to the Lord he said you're not right with God he said that's the main thing try to win souls and I don't care if they go denomination or not they can still be saved in nomination until that marks laid down right the official mark before the rapture they can still be saved that's right that's exactly right we'd have to pray they don't take them the spiritual mark right that they would be a foolish virgins so the misguided his zeal paused zeal but it was misguided but he was living everything that he knew and so we should have a seal to live everything that we know like I was talking about that janitor at our school he don't work there anymore I begged him I the last time was a couple of weeks ago I was begging him in the hallway come on you told me we've we got to sit down and talk about your soul he's like no I can't do that I'm like you told me you I said we prayed for you in this room that you would come out of a coma and come back to work and you did and you told me we could pray for your soul he and he just walks away you know but see I'm just there beg in there trying to win us try to have zeal to win a soul we must do whatever we can to win a soul for God now I go to Romans tend to again hear the juice we'll see again Jews had zeal but brother man said it was the wrong zeal of course the Bible says that to Romans 10 - lets go to verse 1 I love this brethren my heart's desire what's your heart's desire tonight church is it to see people saved I hope it is I know Amen so with that my desires just go to see the Hmong people saved I know he's told me that before I know Jose he told me that about his and I know Adams told me how many people he wants to see saved his family our heart's desire is to see somebody saved and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be millionaires that they might be famous but they might all the natural blessings know that they might have a spiritual blessing of salvation this is a prophet who's filled with the Holy Ghost his heart's desire is to see people saved for I bear them record that they have a zeal of God but not according to the knowledge other words the revelation of Christ as Messiah knowledge is understanding they don't have the understanding that Jesus is the Christ amen all right so that's misguided zeal we have to watch out for that in our lives that we don't get misguided zeal we've got a channel the zeal of God the right way now let's go to Ezekiel file I just I think some of these were just really good I couldn't pass them up and I think they're just a blessing to see what zeal really looks like and church every single person in here should leave here tonight saying god I need more zeal if we can't apply this to our lives we're not honest with ourselves we need more zeal to serve the Lord brother Branham prayed for I'll show you the quotes he prayed for we should pray for that stir up my zeal like that you've said give us more boldness we all need that ezekiel 5:13 thus shall mine anger be accomplished my fury to rest upon them and i will be comforted and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal when I have accomplished my fury in them so this is people that are being judged God no no God zeal when everything falls apart when they see their lives falling apart and the destructions of God all around them then they'll see God zeal I'd rather see God zeal in my life right now in grace right I don't want to see God zeal and judgment I want to see God zeal and grace like Jesus like clean out our church Lord amen if we our church needs cleaned up get the whip out we want to see God zeal and mercy and grace amen not in judge we're not in fury or wrath but we want to see you in mercy so I just want you to what does this what like with Phineas what causes God to slay people it's his zeal that does that remember the man in the book of Acts he was glorifying himself well I forget was named King he was a king I don't matter what his name was but the Bible said he called himself God and the Bible said God smote him right there remember that and the Bible said worms ate him up I think it's acts 18 let's go there I can look real quick I think it's go to acts 18 there's times God just pours out his zeal I think it's 18 X I'm sorry it's acts 12 23 xjassx 12 23 there you go so see god of the old testament is still the same God in the New Testament now we know God's long-suffering in the New Testament but God still slays people trying to think of any recent examples I'm not sure if I can think of any where people recognize it to be I'm thinking about in the news where people recognize it be the hand of God I can't think of any right now acts 12 23 this is the death of Herod okay yeah Herod that's right yeah the people gave a shout verse 22 and the people gave a shout saying is the voice of a god and not a man and immediately the angel Lord smote him because he gave not God the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost that's a New Testament God amen that's our God who killed Ananias and Sapphira God did not Peter Peter didn't murder anybody God did that what did that God zeal praise God in that in this case his boiling anger if they lied to God's face right and if here if they if they glorify themselves rather than giving God glory there's times God will smite them dead that's exactly right so that makes just want to fear the Lord for the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom amen now let's look at God's zeal to defend Hezekiah this is a beautiful story I'm just gonna read because it's a long chapter let's just read second Kings 1931 and then I'll read matthew henry's summary of the chapter second Kings 1931 and Malachi can you read that buddy when you get that second Kings 1931 I got a remember so zealous tonight I'm forgetting to let other people use their voice I'm gonna wear myself out brother Branham said it's not wise he said it's no way it's not a lot of wisdom if I ever asked me voice after service so I'm the same way so forgive me Lord second Kings 1931 all right so who's gonna protect the remnant the zeal of God God's boiling love in this case God's boiling judgement is gonna drive out I'm not sure how to say this guy's name it's a Senate cherub but then his love for God's people is gonna protect a remnant of believers a small group of believers amen so here's the here's the summary Jerusalem's great distress we read up in the foregoing tractor and left it besieged and salted threatened terrified and just ready to be swallowed up by the Syrian army so in other words Israel's battling the Assyrians but in this chapter we have an account of its glorious deliverance not by sword or bow but by prayer and prophecy and by the hand of an angel Hezekiah and great concern sent to the prophet Isaiah to desire his prayers and receive from him and answer a peace see God loves that God loves when someone's in distress and they reach out to the man of God of the hour prays to the heart which was in that case the prophet Isaiah amen they reach out God loves that humility pray for me brother so-and-so pray for me sister so-and-so Simon Reese I don't know if it probably okay if I share this with you because he told me numerous times he said he was really worn out he was doing a lot of side jobs helping out people there plumbing and he said he called up sister Karen you know sanders from lima he said sister Karen can you seek God and see you know she's given words of the Lord before to Lisa Graham and also to brother Brooks I've seen it come to pass it works it worked every time and he said can you give me a word for my life and he said she called him back I think the next day or something and said thus saith the Lord if you don't take a rest and rush your body you're gonna pay for it you're gonna be punished so Simon has taken that as a thus saith the Lord he's turning down jobs just to get his physical strength back I like that I like when you have confidence in somebody's prayers if you ask them to pray you know God's gonna answer their prayer that's that's wonderful that's beautiful and so God love this about Hezekiah Hezekiah says well I know there's one man that can talk to God it's Isaiah Isaiah what's God's word for our lives we're surrounded by the Syrians what's your will Lord and he said peace God's gonna give them peace so Sennacherib's sent a letter to Hezekiah to fright him into surrender some of you probably member that Hezekiah thereupon by a very solemn prayer recommended his case to God the righteous judge and begged help from him so God by Isaiah sent him a very comfortable message assuring him of deliverance the army of the Syrians it was all cut off by an angel and sent a cherub himself was slain by his own sons and so God glorified himself and saved his people amen why did God have zeal to save the small remnant because they humble themselves and they prayed and they asked God for a word instead of trying to him no let's get our let's get our military forces let's flex our muscles and show him what we got boys instead of that he got humble and he prayed and he said man of God pray and we need the word of the Lord we know the word is more powerful than our own weapons amen we need a prophecy we need the voice of the Holy Spirit we need to hear from God and because he humbled himself like that the zeal of God drove out his enemies amen how many want God zeal to drive out your enemies this is what happened here I'm surrounded by enemies I have no other options I'm looking to you God and God zeal save his people amen here's just a few quotes on zeal Graham said what we need today is a missionary minded God sent Holy Ghost born revival that'll have the zeal of God to push out into the jungles yonder and do something for God instead of build big fine churches and try to outshine the neighbor what do we have more zeal for to send brother Simon or to send a missionary or to build a church what do we have more zeal for a real zeal of God will fulfill the great commission of Christ that's right here's what I hear says prayer for zeal so this is what we should pray for at the end of the service here he says oh Christ of God receive these poor people into your kingdom someday I must stand yonder at the throne of God and give an account for my ministry give an account for these things that you permitted me to do Lord in the midst of the people to declare the resurrection of the Lord Jesus God I must answer for that Oh God burn zeal down into my heart more and more and wisdom that I might know how to lead the people to the Lord Jesus hey man and that beautiful church burn it down into my heart Lord more Oh can you say Amen give me more and more zeal so give me that desire to do it and then give me wisdom to channel that desire I love that a man that's beautiful church what a prayer burn it into my heart in other words if you get burnt are you gonna feel the burning are you gonna feel the fire your soul you will if it's the zeal of God you'll feel the burning desire I've just got to do this nothing's gonna stop me from doing this for my Jesus that's right more and more with wisdom of God that's our prayer for tonight amen let me summertime here so I don't wear myself out all right now I already went over this one I don't I think I put an extra scripture in there now let's go through Furman so let got your Bibles maybe we'll have some other people read who feel comfortable I know how the young people is that okay Elijah Rebekah Lydia's okay I don't Malachi read for us remember fervent is very similar it's this boiling boiling stew bubbling up love it's kind like that stream brother Brad talked about why you boil all the time something behind me is pushing me see that's as ELA something behind me is making me bubble out with love for Jesus there's something behind me doing it you see that that's the same idea about the little stream or Creek it's boiling it's moving me to do this like I said on Sunday or announcer last Wednesday nobody had to ask me to write that book for tea right now it's 44,000 words no one had to beg me no one had to wake me up early to say it's time to work on that book or time to get up in time it's time to get up and pray and read your Bible no one should have to do that to you now you might have beat your flesh into it every now and then are you ready to tell that flesh to shut up and you're a liar and get behind me Satan in the huh you have to curse it you know area or whatever you have to do you might to cast it down and cast down the reasonings but behind all of that should be a zeal for God you should want to do the will of God that's for somebody who's born again now because you've got the zeal of God no one had to beg me to make the videos that we made no one has to beg me to come here preach and pray it and serve God or love my wife no one has to beg me to do that the zeal of God makes me want to do it amen now I got numerous scriptures here but I want to just say this know at the top lukewarm all it is is just a toned down version of being firm it because fervent is boiling lukewarm is tepid it's medium it's kind of hot but it's not boiling oh god help us amen oh god help us help us Jesus amen you know what I'm talking about it's kind of war you kind of joy it but there's a time when you really enjoyed it amen we need to really enjoy the Word of God that's right amen see so we got a check we got a checkup we gotta be honest with ourselves and my boiling and the love of God or my own lukewarm mode I just got a halfway simmer medium rod I don't want that I want to be boiling for Jesus amen they ain't going to come out right les you're boiling like with my spaghetti I can make two things eggs and spaghetti that spaghetti is not going to come out right if it's lukewarm it's got to be boiling it's got to be bouncing off it's got to be spilling out then you toss in the pasta that's all I know about cooking that's that's all I know right there it's got to be born if it ain't moyen it don't have enough heat to make it loose and flexible that's what we need we didn't need more flexible in the spirit praise God the great praise the Lord raise our hands and pray for others and have a zeal to win a soul praise God to be moved by the Holy Spirit we don't want a tone now inversion we're gonna have to battle to be more fervent we're have to crucify the flesh to be fervent Amen like act like I said after Sunday sermon with brother Simon I just had one sermon but it gave me so much zeal I came here and laid before the Lord praying and crying and asking God pleading with God to fulfills word these things they don't have to be they don't have to be trained it's just the love of God in our hearts it's the zeal of God in our hearts now let's go to acts 18 24 and 25 I'm just trying to think of those examples from my own life where I know it's God and you know your life as well you know when it's God acts 18 24 and 25 how about Lydia can you read this one acts 18 24 and 25 look at Apollo's he was a smooth-talking fervent boiling preacher who had the Word of God practically memorized right he was mighty in the scripture he could stand there and quote scripture after Scripture and mily convinced him he was boiling up and yet he wasn't even born again at this point right he was fervent he was boiling and he could talk and never miss a beat never miss quoted scripture moo moo-moo-moo-moo he was a mighty man of God and an equivalent Percilla Polhemus I sure liked his fervency but he needs to know the baptism of the Holy Ghost AHS he knew was the baptism of John he there's more he can grow and look how he humbled himself and you know the story he eventually becomes a real Holy Ghost field preacher so much so that in the Corinthian church some said I'm of Apollo's Apollo's was my spiritual father oh I'm appalled Paulus - I'm a Peter Peter was my father well I'm with Jesus and some thing they got so caught up on the man's personality they forgot about Christ amen but see it's easy to see how people would love Apollo's fervency don't you I would I wish I was more like Apollo's in that way more eloquent I didn't misquote words and my wife laughs at me every year every week we'll go home and say Jessie you said this the certain wrong way and I thought oh boy forgive me I hope the people just laugh at me and pray for me I can learn the words better but the point is as Simon said a little bit about Sunday I want to go over it doesn't matter if the preachers fast or slow the preachers got to be right with the word I don't know when I first came to the message I went to both Samuel Browning's church he seemed like he was preaching so fast we're just going over my head but everything he was saying was right and I walked over there many times brother Adam I'm like I don't even I didn't get much out of that but there'd be like one time each service he talked about water baptism not stand up and say everything else about you know thunders and seals and all the church ages I'm like I don't know much about that but when he said water baptism Gloria I said I'm in same head so it seemed like he was going were too fast but he wasn't for the people who were seasoned for it and then you'll go hear a preacher who's real slow takes his time and you're like come on hurry up spit it out that's when we get in our flesh right but see Apollo's was a fast preacher eloquent every word was right on he was beautiful mining the scripture keeps pulling out Scripture don't you have to look at his notes just to could quote the scripture and point you to the Word of God just laying it all out and some people were blessed by that but then other people would be more blessed with a slow preacher it doesn't really matter which one you have you got matters which one God has sent for you because whatever God has sent for you that's what you need whatever God has sent for you and you just have to humble yourself and just accept what God has sent for you because the Bible said God has given every man a preacher the Bible says that literally now if you hear a false doctrine if they like Simon Says Simon Says sometimes he's seen preachers have preached so fast they'll slip in a false doctrine now if you hear that church or if he's a real slow preacher and he slips in a false doctrine which would probably be easier to hear that if he's going slow you think so your job is not to talk bad about the preacher your job is to go correct the preacher let me say it again if a preacher makes a mistake going too fast or he's too slow it's not your job to say something bad about that preacher it's your job to go correct that preacher and the church said see that that's where you know you're still in the flesh if you can pick up people's faults like Simon was saying that's true if you have to we should have to serve as the Holy Spirit during the sermon if you're so spiritual and you pick up mistakes then it's your job to correct it but it shows you're not very spiritual if you talk bad about the preacher afterwards and don't go correct him and the church said right that's truly what it comes down to if you're so smart and and mature that you can catch them but you don't go correct the person then you're not very mature you deceive yourself because that's what brother Branham said no man said he said you brothers are duty-bound into Christ if I make a mistake come to me privately he said I don't care if it's the janitor in the back or he said if it's the trustee you're duty-bound to correct me so see whether you're fast or slow whether you're really fervent mind just boiling over all the time or if you're just a real slow preacher hallelujah Saints you know thank bless the Lord hallelujah I'm trying to get some a southern draw guess but you understand whether your firm really fervent and eloquent fast or if you're really slow God holds all the preachers the same standard be absolutely pure to the Word of God that's a that's the standard for preachers and I just want to put that in there because Simon had a good point about that I agree there's some preachers they preach so fast if they're not careful they'll get off on the word all right they'll say something they should not have said well then it's your job it's my job to go correct them all right and that is real maturity when you can go face-to-face and correct somebody that's real maturity I think those are the most mature Christians when someone makes a mistake you go talk to them privately now you're doing what Jesus said because most people like to go like I said Facebook the Facebook rather than face-to-face that just struck me with years ago that's right most people like to do the easy way instead of going face-to-face so let's be real Christians now let's go to Romans 12:11 this is beautiful right here everyone should have a level of boiling in their heart no matter what you're called to do or they're working to school like some people work in a factory like some people work in an office like some people work in a nursing home like some people wherever you're called to work everybody should have some level of bubbling to do their work you should be happy to do your work because god bless you the job he gave you the strength the Bible said the work the work of a man's hands is the gift of God God gave you a gift when he gave you a job right when he gave you the intelligence to do your job God gave you a gift and we should do it with zeal all right Romans 12:11 like it's always encouraging to me when parents like I just got an email today thank you for all you do they said you go another text I've got you go above and beyond all these other teachers they say with all you do that makes me feel good like they can feel my zeal to be a good teacher that's encouraging I want to hear that and so this is what we're talking about the Bible said it be fervent in all your business so Romans 12 I'm sorry I'm getting there yeah let's go to 10 though lies you can you read 10 and 11 Romans 12:10 11 thank you sir and the church said did you pay your bills on time or send him a few days late I'll get to that later what do you think you should do do you pay him on time don't be slothful don't be lazy right who likes it lazy workers they might like a lazy worker we have any owners business owners in here I don't think so well I'm a preacher do I like a lazy deacon no we got a good deacon by God's grace do you want a lazy pastor who won't do his work the right way won't study the word won't help you when you need help you want a lazy pass or sits around and everybody everybody who sits around the fellowship and everybody served me Amen go get me a glass of water Jose go get me another cupola or another plate of lasagna who wants a lazy leader nobody wants lazier and Paul said no Christian should be slothful in their business if you tell somebody you're gonna pay them you tell someone you're gonna do something for them do it be fervent about it the Bible commands us not to be lazy amen we should be brother BAM said he said should a Christian work and pay tithes and brother BAM said the one person that will work and pay their ties is a Christian that's the one person that will praise God that's the lesson I've learned I've tried to help out so many people and they sit back and they can't find a job for weeks and weeks shame on them and I have God's had to show me that that if they're not more fervent about it then they're not even interested in really and getting help they're just they want a handout god's had to show me that and I've had to learn the hard way I've helped our people then I realized now I should not have helped but I've had to learn that because the heart of me see somebody struggling and I just want to help but I found the people you help the least are the ones that love God the most amen right and that true and brother man there's a quote on it brother BAM was talking and I think it's in he cares that you care if I'm not mistaken and brother Branson was helping somebody out the brother looked at him and said brother branham he said be careful he said you help him today said you'll be packing them tomorrow on your back I thought my that's right see there's some people that would just lean on you now I've had a lot of people lean on me the last few years but part of it's my fault I've learned that now and here's the example here's what it was just a few nights ago that struck me when I came out of college and I realized my wife was pregnant we already married two year before my senior year when I realized Lydia was in in utero and Lydia was coming I didn't have a job I just graduated college I got on my knees in my bedroom and I told you this before about doubt again because it's right what I'm talking about I cried on my bed I was only 1 in my bedroom my memory was right in there an acronym I can show you the house where it was I was crying I was saying god I'd rather die than not be able to provide for this baby and it was so sad my wife had a job and I didn't I just graduated from college a few days ago I didn't have a job so I begged God I begged God for maybe half hour and you know how maybe was 20 minute prayer I don't know how long it was but I was desperate I'd said rather die then not have a job that same day I called Bueller's and wodsworth said can I have my job back in groceries and they said I guess we give you 15 hours I said I'll take 15 hours amen because the Bible said we should be fervent in our business we should be not slothful not lazy well bless God I'll sit around and I'll just enjoy the dr. pepper I'll just enjoy a easy life and God will send me a job no you go get a job that's what I learned and that's what I've got I've got to apply that to other people now I've got learned that if they're not desperate for help and they're not doing everything they can do if they will humble themselves and go work at Burger King or they won't go work at Walmart then how much do they really want a job how much do they really want help because the Bible said we're not slothful we're not lazy in other words I will find a source of income somehow that's right like I said this is what Christians should be serving the Lord fervent in spirit oh I'm ready that means you're mine my mind is ready to do something for God I want to serve the Lord I don't do something for Jesus and then also I want to be the best teacher I can be I want to teach these children I want to help them to memorize their facts 1 through 10 oh you want to be fervent about you want to have zeal about it here's a beautiful one James 5:16 let's go there talk about fervent prayer all right James 5:16 now I think the context is here Elijah if I'm not mistaken James 5:16 right yeah cuz in verse 16 says confess your faults one to another and pray for another that you may be healed I got 10 minutes here so bear with me the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much in other words we've got to pray with a boiling kind of desire like other words God this desire is just bubbling up in me we've got to pray we've got to feel the bubbling of love I say like that we got to feel the bubbling of desperation and who's the example as soon as he says this who does he give the example of Elijah look at verse 17 the Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are and yet he prayed earnestly that it might not rain earnestly so now we get a look into Elijah's life how did he pray when he said Lord may not rain for three-and-a-half years how did he pray was it like Lord if you got Time Lord if you got a few minutes can you just you know can you keep the rain off let me I'll go back to work now did he just take a little five-minute break and say Lord this has really helped me out this isn't really improved to Ahab that I'm a man of God could you let it not rain for three and a half years you think that's how you pray church I imagine you found a prayer closet or something like that he fervently prayed it was boiling love it was just boiled up he really prayed and and I heard a preacher preach on this this week on YouTube I found a good sermon on this and he used Elijah and as the example and he said a man is only as strong a man is only as good as his prayer life and this is the example that he used Elijah who just wasn't some half-hearted prayer he prayed with all his heart he was boiling up he was bubbling up God please close the heavens so Ahab will know that judgments of God are on him and God honored his prayer the fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much the times in Columbus when I seen people healed brother Clements wife it was two people that had babies in the until 2015 Hosea was there at one of them and we were both praying fervently brother remember that you felt the presence of the Lord and you kind of I think even before told them that God heard their prayer that night didn't you yep he foretold him as the spirit of prophecy the spirit of Jesus Christ is spirit of prophecy he told that couple God heard your prayers and nine months later the baby was born on my birthday God has a sense of humor honey but we didn't pray like oh I wonder if God will do this fervently with tears we pre sang songs before we pray we read the Bible we did a little just a short little Bible study about Abraham and Sarah and those things and that one time I pray for the teacher and I sigh I rebuked that mountain of yeah I can't marry the word fertility yep the mountain of infertility thank you i rebuked it in prayer in the name of Jesus Christ I was praying fervently it wasn't a half-hearted prayer Church we need to pray with fervency this is the example God gives we must pray earnestly because the fervent prayer of a righteous man prevails much and the church said a man glory see we need we need more fervency now not to brag and boast and say look how much emotion I got that's not it people can tell if you don't live the life people can tell viewers putting on emotion but when you've got Rios anointing you don't care what anybody says Amen because God is anointing you God put that boiling in you for a purpose it's exactly right hallelujah now I got a couple more in a more close here that's what I say ten minutes yeah I got eight minutes on here so bear with me so remember that that fervent that boiling is like the burning incense right because incense is likened unto prayer when you got those those spices and you got those herbs we'd say you know whatever substance they are when you burn that I always saw the incense sticks my friends always an incense stick so I I got the wrong picture I don't have the Israelite picture they just burnt the incense sticks and lit it like a like a firework look like a firework or something like that but the point is prayer needs to burn in our hearts praise the Lord we got to feel it when we're praying for somebody we need to feel it Lord like I want to feel what sister so-and-so what brother so-and-so I was going for I want to feel that when I pray that's a fervent prayer amen we need fervent prayers that's how he lied you prayed and God answered Elijah's prayer hallelujah that's the word of the Lord Churchill assed two times fervent is only used seven times New Testament seven times so it's a word that means boiling but zeal is used more often so let's go laps on first Peter - lets go - first Peter - it's right after James that works out good right in chronological order first Peter 1:22 all right now this something that we all want to see don't we Rebecca can you read that I think it's your turn honey would you read that first Peter 1:22 thanks Lydia amen in other words don't have pretend love love people like you really love them that's why I tell everybody if anyone ever needs help here just please let me know if you want to talk to me on the phone just let me know if you were to meet me at Panera if you want to meet me at the church let me know I'll do everything I can to help you out because I don't want to love you pretend I want to love you with a fervent heart and I hope you want to love everybody in here with the fervent heart with the boiling love I'm just bubbling over can't wait to love my brother and sister in the Lord that's real fervent love right there that's what Christians should have remember they should know we're Christians by our boiling up fervent bubbling over love for one for another that's right that's what Jesus Christ said 1st Peter 4:8 we'll close right there I believe yeah cuz the next one yeah I just gave two examples of zealous repents well let's look at first Peter 4:8 and then I think after this when we're ready for verse 20 of chapter three behold I stand at the door knock amen I love going through like this it's so it's so comforting to know that we're preaching just what brother Branham preached went as he preached the word cuz he wasn't perfect by the gram you know he's a man but as he wrote it in the assault in the word taught it we teach the same thing 1st Peter 4:8 I love this above all things my let's all read this one together ready first Peter 4:8 on three one two three and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sin praise God if there's one thing Bride of Christ fellowship needs it's that we need to love each other better we need to love each other more and if someone's not loving you you've got to let them know you got to let them know now the time when you do the the sooner the better usually unless you got a leading the Lord to wait on it but there's somebody you can't love in this church you need to talk to them and tell them why you're having a hard time loving them because one thing above all we should have the Bible said is love fervent love one for another praise God you believe that we should just be like a beehive of love right now let me just visit buzzing all over each other you know like a beehive as a program said a church is like a beehive of activity loving each other helping each other right that's what real fervent Christians do they love one another now I'll say like this one of the greatest ways you can show me you love me is praying for me and coming to church every time that's one of the greatest ways you can show me that you love me praise the Lord that means so much to me and you just let me know how can I love you better just let me know one time Zura told me that when we should have these little meetings we call them personal interviews and and I asked her and at Panera at Congo Falls I said sir what can I do better for you how can I serve you better as a Christian she's a brother Jesse she said you ask me that all the time she said you need to be or she said I need to be asking you what I can do for you better I said thank you that's very nice compliment but the point is we need to love each other more that's the whole point of this fervently at work we need to be the most fervent workers at church we should be fervently trying to seize anyway help today who's not here could I call them after church can I see my wife does a good job of that I'm sure some of you do too brother so-and-so or sister so-and-so why aren't you here she's good with the sisters I tried to text the brothers every time they're not here because you love them we want to fervently care about them if one person loves you in Akron it should be somebody here if not please let me peace let me know if someone if you're not feeling loved here please let me know we're the ones that should love out of anybody in this whole city of Akron we should have a loved one for another let's say into our feet by God's grace fervent we can be a fervent preacher we want to do that we want to be a fervent in business whatever job we have school where we are business we want to be fervent in that but most of we want to be fervent prayers but most of all we want to be firm at loving one another and those adding it to this here but I'm just gonna just mention it yes sound special Oh wonderful praise the Lord sounds good hallelujah love that thanks for loving us that way brother we appreciate that but if there's two easy examples to see fervent repentance it's Nineveh because they they rent their their clothes where they rent their garments and they sat in sackcloth and ashes forgive us right they even they even made their animals if I'm not mistaken fast or something like that they even they even they were made of their animals humble themselves how can the animal humble themselves they were so sincere in other words everybody in our home needs to be aware that we're repenting before God and God will honor instead of burning them up God honor them by forgiving them anytime we can fervently repent fervently say we're sorry God looks down and said that's my boy that's my daughter they're just they're just the way they need to be god loves someone who's fervent whatever they do have an encouragement be enthused have have zeal have emotion have strength whatever you do do with all your heart for the Lord how many know the Bible says that whatever you do do it with all your might and then Zacchaeus he was so zealous he said anyone that I stole from I'm paying him back fourfold anyone I've stolen from I'm gonna make sure I pay them back times four see he was willing to go face to face then knock on the door and they say oh are you gonna take my money again no I'm giving you money back and I'm giving you four times the interest that's a real repentance right there that's real zeal all right that's real carefulness that's real revenge against the devil nah amen glory amen god bless you Church what's up you have a song on your heart brother okay [Music] fill the pot with my mind just fast you know exactly you with tall or pin the spirits grow is deep with it must be God here in my soul cuz I feel hey let's just raise our hands can we I feel I hear the and I know his spirits move yes give my by all he speaks to me through the word and I agree lord please come and take

of overflowing anxieties in this age of pressure I just believe every one Lord needs more fervency I know I do everyone needs more zeal to serve the Lord Lord I remember your prophet prayed that

burning fire of God the call from the altar Lord may it touch our live but me and also touch our hearts to your God that we can feel that boiling bubbling over power desire of the Holy Spirit to want

every heart Lord God burn at the burn be felt by our hearts dear God and your prophet said more and more amen hallelujah Jesus that the Holy Spirit have free course may we open our hearts in our lives may we open our minds to be fervent in our spirit that we can think instantly we would wake up about hearing the court of the day reading our Bibles pray helping somebody instead of dreading the next day Oh God forgive us of going to other things Lord for comfort instead of going to you maybe we feel your fervent desire may the heart of God come into our hearts dear God like my grandpa's testimony Lord give me a doozy like that four souls Lord God Lord you've seen how I've begged that man to come to church and meet with him lord I begged him cut nor give us a zeal Lord to beg people to come to church we can't drag them physically but Lord give us a zeal to compel people to come to church to your God forgive us Lord if we have if we lost that desire if somehow we we've seen something in life that's more important than that but there really isn't because we seek ye first the kingdom of God and everything else is added unto us Lord God the trouble is we're seeking other things lord help us to seek the kingdom of God the Holy Ghost Salvation the Word of God thank you lord let's not be lazy let's be the best workers we can be give us wisdom to rest Lord as I know I'm guilty of sometimes
