[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] me [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] is [Music] out of here and then maybe seated just for a moment by god's grace i feel like i need to greet the church it's a pleasure to be here uh greetings from living waters tabernacle and uh it's always a pleasure to come back and be a part of what i call some of the greatest teaching of my life uh as far as the ministry is concerned uh when i come here for a couple years and i got the the eat of the good word that the holy spirit was preaching through other jesse so a phenomenal gift a phenomenal brother there and uh i'm so glad that uh in the company of a phenomenal man like that there's phenomenal saints that are gathered around him uh so with all that uh we we sure love and appreciate everyone if that time we sure like to go through and talk about it but uh anyway uh never enough time of the day enough time in the day to preach let alone uh talk about each other so uh but uh we we appreciate all his sacrifices labor love uh just uh book writing putting videos out all those things to uh do his best to uh put forth the kingdom there so we appreciate uh all that and uh i told my wife that uh when he got here i said i'm gonna love on you because you drove all the way to akron for me this morning so i could study uh so she's a an amazing uh woman there and uh i know this uh that uh when the bible said help me to ximena helped me right and uh that right there is a real deal help help me damien and any husband uh appreciate your wife like that uh you realize what uh what that woman is to you uh you realize after a while you couldn't do it without her right and uh you know i'm so glad about that and the further that the mystery goes into jesus christ and you find out that you're his bride you see uh the abilities and the expectations that he has placed in us as his church amen and that we would be able to please him in such a way as that amen so sure lover and uh for those who weren't aware we are expecting number five uh they said you're going after uh i trust it's a girl because brielle has been praying for two years for a girl every night lord can you give mommy a girl so uh with that being spoke we uh sure love the lord appreciate all his blessings that he's given to us and i'm glad and i know that you're feeling like-minded that we're living so close to the coming of the lord uh we're living in unprecedented times in american history and we're beginning to see things unfold in a very quick way you know the prophet talked about that he said don't expect it to just get bad he said but expect it to get increasingly rapidly bad worse and worse right and we're finally moving into those stages right now uh where things are really taking a turn all right but this morning uh if we could uh i know i missed about four things i'm supposed to talk about uh but uh greetings to every single one you can see brother johnny and then with jose and the stephen and situation say yeah glory to god brother bang you know pretty nice it's pretty nice he's sitting right in front of me today you don't mind being right in front of the words i appreciate that brotherly manchester hua and uh god bless uh everyone else saying my lord bless you all and sister naomi's not here jake but uh praise the lord for that and uh if we have uh let's go ahead and stand for the reading of the word if we can let's get right into this i i don't wanna i know we got two services i don't want to be too long here but uh when i left here uh i believe it was in june when we were here with brother brooks uh lord put this on my heart to speak to you and uh i just uh got it around knowing i was coming and uh just last day or so and uh we just trust it'll be a blessing to you and uh how many are glad that the the word of god is it's actually you know christ is that word amen so you know you can't always get all that out of a quote because the quote's not the absolute right but uh when you look at the word of god you see that there's always a a picture uh that is brought before us and uh by god's grace uh we're so glad about that because uh the more you look into the word of god the more you find that that is a supernatural book amen so if you have your bibles it's not lining up here but uh uh let's go to uh matthew 25 verse 1. matthew 25 1 read this little portion here and uh always so uh put before us here as far as uh we always talk about this is one of the most important uh passages uh that we see of course because uh this is concerning us right at the coming of the lord i'm sorry i'm not sure why it's not just give us a second here we'll get things dialed in here let me try that try that one hdmi yep gotta love technology it lord put a blessing on that we will be all right matthew 25 we'll keep trying we'll keep going verse one it says here it says then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins uh which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom five of them were wise and five were foolish uh they that were wise took their lamps and took no oil with them uh but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps can you put a claim on that and say that's me that's you amen that's how we got to look at this all right it says and while the bridegroom terried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him then all those virgins arose and trim their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps are gone out but the wise answered saying not so uh lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and and they that were ready uh went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut afterwards came also the other virgins saying lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the son of man cometh amen let's go ahead and bow our heads for a word of prayer and we'll get right into this here lord jesus our precious husband oh god as the wife is making herself ready lord we come as humbly as we can before you today lord realizing that we're getting ready to fulfill this prophecy that you set within your word oh god lord you have now been in the process of positioning the wise and the foolish on the earth oh god we know of course it's been in every age oh god uh within the vine lord but yet uh this morning we want to maybe look at this picture that you have given us in the scripture and uh to be able to uh maybe just uh show that it is a genesis revelation uh uh move oh god that's hero god and that your word can just really not just uh lean on a quotation which is a great commentary but actually tie things in with the word of god lord and we know no man can do that oh god under his own power so we ask this morning oh god you'd open your words of life to us today oh god and may we see oh god the truth of your word oh god may it open up to us in a new and revealing way o god that we might have more faith in what we are where we are and oh god what we need to make ready for lord we're just asking now that you'd surely anoint me oh god give me strength i'm just a man uh mercy just that's what i need oh god mercy and i know we're all claiming that this morning lord but yet uh you look oh god not at the outside not at the stature but oh god you look at the heart lord so we ask oh god you look at our hungry hearts this morning with the wonderful worship that's been given to thee lord and lord surely o god minister unto us by your holy spirit in the name of jesus christ the church says together amen you may be seated amen we got a power point i don't know if we'll get onto it here but this morning we want to uh we want to work with the idea the idea of the five wise virgins we'll keep on trying with this just makes it easier to follow the scriptures maybe but uh we didn't have a powerpoint before so god knows you really don't need it because i show you a picture some people like things more visually amen but this morning we're just going to work with this idea if we can if something gets turned on it gets turned on if not that's fine but we want to work with the five wise virgins right we've of course heard these parables so many times and we realize that matthew 25 is is a phenomenal portion of scripture that's been given to us and the reason why is that matthew 25 and of course it works with the idea of the coming of the lord right amen and you know that's important to us because that is the age in which we live amen we have endured the church the bride church has endured seven church ages and now we're in the last of the seventh right amen and what makes that so great is now we're coming to uh the culmination of all these things that has been prophesied right and uh due uh to the giving out of the finishing of the mysteries according to the seventh angel by the holy ghost uh we realize that the mysteries they are finished amen and what now they have been brought to us that we might have a fuller and a sure picture of what to expect in the moments before the coming of the lord amen i don't know about you but with all the calamity that's going on politically right now uh aren't you glad amen that you don't have to get caught up in the confusion but you can look at the prophesied word of god amen take a hold on that word amen and just stand and believe it amen because it will surely come to pass amen we don't have oh i hope it goes that way we have a thus saith the lord that this bible is true and what what makes it so awesome about this and all you know they can go against the the prophet all they want but you know what when it comes down to it has there ever been a prophet that has gave so many types to tie everything in right at the end time they don't want to talk about that they don't want to talk about the doctrines what they might just say well this says it's wrong but you know what they can't take it genesis to revelation and that right there is proof amen that they don't have what they say they got amen but this is a revelation and remember it's a revelation given to the bride amen now let's begin to look at this uh i want to work with the wise and the foolish versions but i want to focus on the whys this morning because really when we look at it we focus so much on the foolish right so many times we well it's like a scarecrow in our midst oh i hope i'm not foolish version oh i hope i'm not judas and brother sister we can get behind these uh beyond these things amen we can believe the word for what it says and what why don't you identify yourself with that word amen because remember even today it's not your sacrifice it's the sacrifice that jesus christ made 2 000 years ago amen now notice of course when we're working with the wise and the foolish uh we know these things but what one had oil and the other one didn't right the other one ran out amen and over seven church ages as your prophet said he said that uh while they all slept he said that actually meant that they were what they were actually dying right but what now we're coming to the point where it's time to wake up trim the lamps get ready go ye out to meet him amen but notice this i want to begin to work in this direction because i got a lot to say in a short amount of time and i got everything playing here so i know how long i've been amen but notice i want to begin to work with this there's a wise virgin and a foolish version all right according to webster's 18 28 it says wise it says uh properly having knowledge now this is interesting when you look at the nine uh gifts of the spirit which one of your prophets says the first one wisdom don't matter if you got prophecies they don't matter if you got tongues it don't matter if you have all those things because if you don't have wisdom of the spirit you will not be able to bring it forth successfully hallelujah because what is wisdom it's having knowledge but it says having the power of discerning and judging correctly so you want to be a wise virgin you have to you have to be able to discern and judge correctly amen amen that means you gotta watch all things the bible says he that spiritual judgeth all things right and notice uh or of discriminating between what is true and what is false amen there ought to be something ringing out of your heart when you hear the truth of the word preached amen hallelujah if the holy ghost is in you you just can't help but get excited about the word amen it might make one jump it might make one smile amen there's got to be something coming up amen because the holy ghost will bubble up in you amen hallelujah amen it's not shiny glistening like hollywood but the gospel glows amen it's something within amen that reflects the light from the word amen now notice so to be a wise virgin means that you can see the difference between good and bad and judged correctly all right and notice it says in hebrews 5 13 it says for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe well should we just stay right there just drinking milk that's not why he's virgin the wise virgin can go beyond that anybody can say jesus died on a cross and he resurrected amen but this word goes a lot deeper than that amen it's a lot deeper than the common phrase everybody will say oh god loves me god loves him god loves everybody well he didn't love esau i wonder if he likes the rest of his seed come on but the bible says strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age amen the meat of the word amen see these things can be so commonplace oh wise virgin glory to god we're good but the bible says that strong meat belongs to the person that's full age even those who by reason of use hallelujah you will have to use amen notice of who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil amen the bride of jesus christ in a time of maturity can discern between good and evil which is what that is a wise virgin right now i'm going to get to this uh uh lord help us here uh i'm going to stop i want to stop here i'm going to make this a short because like i said we want to say oh well let's preach all about the fools we got to make sure when you've got to make sure you're not full force let's dig through this real good and we never want to focus on the wise and then if we do we say oh glory to god we're the bride we're the word amen we got the word what is the word the word is a quickening spirit amen he takes you from being dead and makes you alive amen he is not just truth he is spirit and truth right so let's take a little quick stop at foolish virgin now notice this is not my definition this is webster's all right and i go by 1828 when they're still using christian principles to bring definitions foolish it means void of understanding or sound judgment what does that mean that means you can't tell the difference between true and false isn't that something because who's ultimately going to make you do that remember to deceive the elected if it was possible so you have to be wise all right and notice they're foolish they're void of understanding it's not judgment they can't tell if this is right that's wrong whatever it is right but notice this weakened intellect applied to general character notice uh the second definition is unwise i didn't define that they define that so you have a wise virgin and then a foolish but the very word foolish means unwise are they acting without judgment or discretion all right now notice when your prophet actually went through and i'm just going to go through this uh really quickly here but the reasons why the foolish missed the rapture were they christians yes they were virgins they were chased living a holy life right so what was it your prophet said he said they didn't go all the way to receive the holy ghost or the oil only they thought well you know what if i go to church i got the holy ghost oh i believe god sent a prophet i got the holy ghost right even some people have just left the message they they say well well the problem is is is that that he said that the evidence of the holy of being baptized with the holy ghost was to be with the word all the way and you know their issue with that they they want without understanding they say that that is what completely biased towards just believing god sent a prophet but that's not what it is to be with the word all the way is to believe everything the bible says amen hallelujah so if that was if that goes back to the book of acts then you believe every single thing that's ever been promised to the church amen they are yea and amen in him amen remember the bible says he is able to do uh above all that you can ask or think amen there's a god in this room right now that can do anything beyond your imagination oh my oh god let us get tapped into that power amen you'll only get it by yielding within the ministration of the holy ghost in you remember it's the stature of a perfect man seven that's how's the guy's looking at back there i said brother jesse ham said it yet to him but it's in my mind i said you got to give me a give me a copy of that poster back there who did that somebody did amazing on that oh i should have known that sister wendy i should have known that god forgive me because on there it says his faith his knowledge hallelujah it's his divine love amen it's his patience amen it's his god in his brother kindness right it's all him and what we can do to get away from ourselves they didn't go all the way with the holy ghost he said they were blinded by false teachers he said they loved god but didn't get an opportunity to hear the word right what we find out that they weren't prayed up oh my that's what he said he said you go pray up when they ask for oil remember there's a season they come and ask the lies for oil what's their answer here let me give you what i got you can't they got to go buy their own they go buy from them that sell right and what lastly they couldn't yield to god this couldn't do it right yes now let's continue read you one quote and we're going to go revelations chapter 4 61 279 who did daniel see coming with tens of thousands times ten thousands the saints the books were opened sinners another book was open which was the book of life the sleeping virgin oh my can't you see that the sleeping church them that went out to meet the bridegroom and let the oil go out of their lamp never entered into this what didn't they enter into they never let christ take control so he could work miracles and speak with tongues and do wonders and things to prove that he lived in his church you see we try to say oh it's not the supernatural but that supernatural actually shows that god is there i want you to see this because it's not just ordained for brother jesse it's ordained to what these signs shall follow them that believe amen that means it's your revival amen that means it's it's your god that will leave you amen it's not no longer a nation church amen this is an individual church amen and what he is the the head and we are the body and you are a member in particular amen so what is it the foolish just couldn't let god control him i think i'm going to control myself today oh i don't know about you i'm already convicted because where we're going if you've got that true revelation something inside of you should cry out just like jesus christ i do nothing except the lord show me first amen that's coming to the position of what christ called you to be all right now let's do this because the bible is perfect all right in my next slide if you see it here it says virgins defined in the bible with a nice little picture in it there you go hallelujah so do you realize that i don't have to define it webster don't have to define it the bible itself will define it [Music] all right let's look matthew 7 24 he says therefore i'm unplugged if you want to try it can can she go through the scriptures and time and jump them so i'm off now i'm offline matthew 7 24 we'll probably need it because i got to go quick matthew 7 24 says therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them i will liken him unto a wise man who the person that will hear the sayings and do it they're not just hearers of the word only but they're doers of the word that's a wise virgin amen which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine you see it doesn't matter if you hear it that's the difference between wise and foolish hearing it and doing it see it don't matter if you sit in a message church amen it don't matter that you that you say oh oh i listened to a tape this morning that's got nothing to do with it you have to be a hearer of that word and what yield yourself to allow that word to live through you amen not a legalism but in nature that takes you over amen and you can cry out and say i am a new creation in christ amen hallelujah everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man wise foolish which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it hallelujah your house is going to stand or it's not did you build on a rocker do you build on sand hallelujah you gotta have the rock notice ephesians 5 15 i'm gonna go through these quick see then that you walk circumspectly well that's why we don't use the king james the words are too difficult not as fools but as wise so notice now we have wise and foolish coming in again and what's the difference circumspectly redeeming the time i remember brother jesse priest's series about redeeming the time it's good stuff can't remember that long ago i'm over 40 now because the days are evil you see the more that the days are evil the more you need to redeem the time amen redeem means to buy back amen don't worry about what you failed to do amen make good with what you have left amen hallelujah that's why the bible and your prophet tied it in and said we've got to be 11th hour workers amen hallelujah remember all the rest of them say they didn't have to do as much as us but they get the same pay that is the blessing given to those who can work in this dark hour amen oh my that is grace amen turned into the rapture of the church amen so notice wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the lord is see the foolish don't know what the will of the lord is we just left that passage but right above uh the rock and the sand and the builders was what those that would prophesy and do many mighty works but they never did his will hallelujah i'm going to be the wise virgin i believe i am the wise virgin well the difference you better be circumspect and what does that mean serious bentley means cautiously with watchfulness every way hey don't dwell don't dwell on these politics and things so much that that it makes you so nervous that you can't move the holy spirit gives you rest remember your prophet said he said don't pay attention to the things that are going on out there he said but get in goshen while there's still time remember when abraham was on the on the back side of the desert in the wilderness there he didn't uh he didn't subscribe to the sodom and gomorrah times he stayed out in the in the wilderness with god and commune with him but you know what that is our example because we are abraham's face seed amen just trust in god he'll provide amen watch from this every way with attention to guard against surprise or danger how are you gonna do that oh i better stock up i better be a prepper the only thing you ought to be prepping to see how much oil you can get in that land hallelujah filth fill the fill the lamp fill the vessel amen let my cup run us over amen and remember he can't hurt the oil in the wine so if you want it you can get it amen you want the holy ghost today get it amen you can't come lay on the scene and get it you have to come with all you are every cyber laying it down amen and he will walk he'll turn you into a wise version we'll get to it a minute here so what always just pay attention be ready watch your signs don't get too involved will you stay right there and make sure that you're watching this right here because here's the thing shouldn't this also meet what's going on out there yeah well wait a minute if the terror comes to fruit and that brings what and that brings the antichrist because they're all gathered up united together as one to bring him forth right right then what notice they're joining us one for an antichrist you're joining us one for what to meet him in the air amen hallelujah but notice that change it takes place in you you're not the watch oh brother jesse god is changing him amen and surely he's taking him higher but you know what you should be able not just to look at him but you should what sit in the field of the word he's eating well he's ministering it to you and you should see the great change it's bringing in your life right there's nothing that sounds better than when a pastor would hear from this church i have grown so much from the ministry of this church i remember absolutely i say oh god it must been you and it was notice again proverbs 10 verse 8. so notice the bible is very clear about this i'm going to go direction with this but i want you to see that the bible does there's there's many times where it says why is foolish why is foolish why is foolish well why does it do that see because you don't have to just lean upon a quote you can take it right back to the word of god and see what is what what god says about you and what you shouldn't be and what you should be right proverbs 10 8 it says the wise in heart will receive commandments all right but a praying fool shall fall all right so what a wise man will receive now notice he's not giving commandments he's receiving it he's always what up for the hearing of the word but notice a praying fool shall fall that word pray means to talk much without weight or too little purpose that's why the bible says we should be slow to speak and quick to hear hallelujah because when we begin to over emphasize ourselves like we are the oracle like we are the pure steward right which of course in christ we are but when it becomes so much about what we think and what we know and what we can memorize right then you miss what god is really trying to do because remember it's not how high we can get it's how low remember he said if that church can humble itself god will do some great things with that third poll amen humble myself so if i notice a praying fool that means all they do is talk they never talk about nothing but they talk all right now you might talk too much maybe i'll talk enough but the thing is let the holy ghost talk amen let the holy ghost leave you amen because no matter if you're on this extreme or that extreme or in the middle you just let god be gone and focus your attention to say what we have the mind of christ so lord what do you want me to say who do you want me to say to how can i help this sincerely bless this enemy what can i do and god will do it proverbs 12 15. [Music] the way of a fool proverbs 12 15 the way of a fool is right in his own eyes right how many people you talked to they said nope that's not what i believe you can share in the scriptures one time i was in a discourse with someone talking about uh they're all about i mean the only thing that matters to them is the nephilim there's giants they're hiding in caves right now they're getting ready to come out and i wrote a 12-page essay because they didn't want to sit down so i wrote a 12-page essay tying in the king james bible and tying it and showing it doesn't mean that and they got done and they said they said well we know it's not in the scripture but we still believe it anyway [Music] by the scripture there were giants but it didn't come by by satan's angels creating themselves flesh right i've had i've had that and talking to people they say well well god god could a good good allow the donkey to talk he can give his angels flesh that's god but one thing that satan is not is a creator he can't create that let alone the angels are not male and female so that's a lot of creatine the devil's got to do but trust me there were giants that's right but you know what the bigger issue is today there's intellectual giants hallelujah amen the way of a fool is right in his own eyes but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise he did that you know how all these are coming back to not how much you can say but how much you can receive and being humble enough to receive something when i first started in the pipe fitting trade 20 years ago they they told us they said they said never think that you're so smart that someone can't teach you something because in the piping trays there's a million ways to run a pipe he said they said it could be uh he said they said it could be the laziest guy but they said you know what the thing about a lazy guy is they're always looking for an easier way [Laughter] and they come up with amazing ideas i kid you're not i still use a lot of them and they're right they said it doesn't matter if they're absolutely dumb as far as uh they're not smart he said sometimes they have the fastest best ways that you can do things because they just take it simply they don't over complicate nothing but they said never get to a place that you think you know it all glory all right who would have thought they'd be able to tie that in with the piping traits they sure did right with the word amen let's go again proverbs 26 4. one more on this we're going to go one more slide proverbs 26 4 you've seen this yes now what you see is every i'm just bring it right through the word you call it a teaching teaching preaching whatever you want to call it but catch what it is because there's a very very clear separation even biblically between the wise and the foolish proverbs 26 4 it says answer not a fool according to his folly lest thou be also be like unto him so when you're talking to a fool notice it says don't answer him according to his folly he'll get you trying to go a certain way all right so they so a lot of people think this is a contradiction fifth verse it says but answer a fool according to his folly lest he be wise in his own conceit so the one scripture says answer them not and this one says answer all right so remember a fool is always praying he's always running his mouth off about a lot of things a lot of times you don't even know he's talking about yes sir the bible but notice it's it's not uh uh it's not a contradiction in the fourth verse it says don't answer them according to his folly so remember this is written to the lies not to the fool so what when you when a fool tries to get you in a direction let the holy ghost take you and make sure that watch that you answer them but don't answer to the insanity of the direction he's trying to take you because if you do now you're going to make him wise when you're supposed to be wise so notice we just talked about praying and so forth but the wise gives answers too but what do they give answers according to to what true and false judgments right amen amen discernment right yes sometimes sometimes just listen to somebody talk to you you get by discernment you get the actual direction of their issue and their need and their problems and how to change the subject to be where it needs to be oh help us lord proverbs 28 26 it says here it says he that trusteth in his hardest is wicked deceitful above all things i want to trust that i don't trust the word amen amen so notice uh but whoso walketh wisely he shall be delivered amen right so don't trust you yourself trust in him amen in all things amen believe in him we're coming to a place that you're going to have to amen proverbs 29 11 a fool uttereth all his mind but a wise man keepeth it until afterwards a lot of talking a lot of listening there are places that my mind goes that i don't want you to hear about right that's wisdom because not every thought i have is exactly right or maybe it's some some way out direction and everybody will look at you like [Music] sometimes a fool will prove himself by his words that's right yes sir that's why sometimes we got to let our words be few amen talk along the word all right so notice this we've got all these things are why isn't foolish why is the food we're getting ready to change the direction after this you know james 1 5. this to me is one of the most powerful promises to the modern day church and and and it's pretty obvious why because this right here goes right along with your nature change okay notice when you see this if any of you lack wisdom if you're a wise virgin you're gonna have wisdom but if you lack wisdom let him ask of god that give it to all men liberally a true liberal and a brain is not and it shall be given him amen so you might not have any wisdom at all any any ability to what now notice to not say too much or not say thing wisely but what all you have to do is ask god you realize this is god changing your mind from the way it was and putting you into a condition amen where you can be giving grace to the hearer amen you can be giving direction what very simply and sincerely amen to help the individual hallelujah amen six verse it says but let him ask in faith you have to believe that god can change the way you think you have to believe that god can want take some control of your mind that discernment can take control now think about this what was strong meat given to those who can discern right hallelujah amen see we should be a discerning church hallelujah we gotta discern the two spirits of the framework of the church that's invincibility that's where we're at hallelujah we've got to be able to see whether it's in the word or not lead be led by the holy ghost amen notice for he that nothing wavering for he that waver there's like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed yeah get anything not gonna be stable you're gonna be a mess all the time wise foolish all right hallelujah aren't you glad that the bible shows you how to be wise now did you know in the scripture let's move in our bibles to numbers 26 52. when we come to the old testament we come to a place that we find that the scripture actually it shows us that there's actually types and one of the types that they give us is actually working with the wise virgin all right numbers 26 52. i want to go through this it's just how the lord showed it to me numbers 26 52. i want you to see this so now moses taking the church remember he's taking them to a land flowing with milk and honey right it's a great place to be hallelujah your prophet typed in two ways he said he said in one aspect it was receiving the holy ghost he said another is actually coming to the promised land of eternal life all right but notice numbers 26 52 it says in the lord speak unto moses saying unto these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according to the number of names to many thou shalt give the more inheritance and the few thou shalt give the less inheritance all right to everyone shall his inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of him notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot according to the names of their of the tribes of their fathers they shall inherit according to the lot shall possession thereof be divided or by between many and few amen so here they were coming out of egypt and god's shaking in the canaan's land and the purpose of going to that land is to receive inheritance in that land amen there is a positional placement remember even as what moses led them to the land the prophet trump them out of egypt and what the their redemption is two parts to come out but to go in amen and what god would raise joshua type of the holy ghost and he would lead the church in amen notice it wasn't just moses that would place them by the word it was joshua that would see them in that land and then place them positionally there all right all right so we're making a turn here and noticing that the scripture is very clear the reason god is sending them to israel that whole land is to positionally place them where they will want they will be exactly what god made them to be in that land amen amen amen they were supposed to be free in that land they were supposed to prosper in that land they were supposed to be happy there amen they were supposed to be what hallelujah the gates of the enemies were promised to be possessed amen that's your promise now america the devil can't hold you amen sometimes you just gotta stand up and say hallelujah i'm free amen it's like i'm saying that jesus christ at whom the son has set free is free indeed amen he set you free he filled you with the holy ghost he called you to the gospel amen it's his promise not mine amen and i'm so glad because his promise is what 100 positive it will happen amen this is the place of dwelling that israel is called to be in type it was set there so you and i could see it all right we focus o glory to god look at moses oh the word prophet oh brother branham and so forth then we'll look at joshua taking the last oh hallelujah it's past to the holy ghost holy also take us in the land that's right amen we believe those things yes we can focus on caleb's oh glory to god that was a dog right there glory gentile dog amen even the dogs eat the crumbs of fall from the masters table hallelujah did you realize that when it came to the syrophoenician woman jesus told her no that's right i got nothing to do with you yes but she answered that beautiful statement is that even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table and then she told him no or he told her no amen and jesus would respond to her that way and instead of her getting mad at jesus you see sometimes god ain't telling you no amen but god knows that you have a faith to stay with it it's his promise amen jesus said i have not seen so much faith in all israel amen hallelujah so just because it don't happen doesn't mean it's not just it looks like god said no amen all you got to do your prophet said you gotta be a crumb hunter amen hallelujah just keep looking on that ground for some crumbs amen how do you say glad because today it's no longer israel at the time now it's the gentile church he says i call you no more servants but i call you sons amen hallelujah the whole purpose that they were to go into the land was inheritance to be positionally placed there let's look at this now numbers 27 verse ones numbers 27 verse 1. we come to this story about these daughters and this is so perfect scripture i just love it i know you'll be blessed numbers 27 1 it says then came the daughters of salafat the son of hefor the son of gilead the son of mecca the son of manasseh of the families of manasseh the son of joseph and these are the names of his daughters now count them with me mala noah haglab milka tirsa five daughters now what do these daughters want what do these virgins want i wonder second verse it says and they stood before moses and before eliezer the priest and before the princes of all the congregation by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation saying our father died in the wilderness oh aren't you glad and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the lord in the company of korah but died in his own sin and had no sons why should the name of our father be done away from among his family because he hath no son give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father so now here these these wise virgins now notice this is not happening by chance this is 100 predestined by god this the word always was amen it might have been living out but that in that dimension the word had already been brought forth amen that's eternity yes so notice these five virgins if i call them five wise virgins they come approaching moses yes and they want to not they're interested in one thing the posterity or the continuation of their father's name because he was the one that died in the wilderness of his own sins aren't you glad that jesus christ died for your sins amen he took your sins so that you could become the righteousness of god amen hallelujah i hope you feel the holy ghost here because he is here amen that means all things are possible amen hallelujah if you believe it all things are possible amen now notice this this father he died in the wilderness but notice he did not gather in the company of unbelief but he stayed right with the word amen amen what i only do that which pleases the father yes sir yes sir there's no rebellion hallelujah now notice let's begin to look at this that name zalafa hat it means in definition firstborn the name means firstborn praise god the father's name was the firstborn colossians 1 13 says who have delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible god the firstborn of every creature you know those names have meanings your prophet talked about that they mean something roger don't name him ricky don't name him elvis for by him or all things created that are in heaven that are on earth uh visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist see it's not that just the son of man just came he was the logos just taking on flesh god and flesh he is the head of the body the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead then that in all things he might have the preeminence so this is ahead notice these five wise virgins what they want is what the name of their father cannot be removed from the inheritance in the land hallelujah so they could have been ephraim and dan and all them and what even the tribe of manasseh but they looked and for some reason something rose up in them hallelujah see jesus only has five virgins that's the bride he's after notice they wanted what they wanted to be recognized in the land notice they were fighting for what to just be an they were fighting to be a joint heir to everything his name promised them oh hallelujah ephesians 1 10 it says that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one thing one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are in earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the council of his own will see that it was god's desire what through jesus christ who give you inheritance and what is it that we should be to the praise of his glory [Music] these persians were going to be the praise to his glory who first trusted in christ and whom he also trusted after that he heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession unto the praise of his glory amen so getting in that land what they're the earnest of their inheritance right that's the baptism of holy ghost we should be there right now now we are fighting for what positional placement in that land so notice if you're the wise virgin now you always were the wise virgin but what you recognized that your father's name had posterity and that it had to remain amen it wasn't three persons it was one person amen hallelujah and what that name is all powerful the firstborn of creation amen now let's look at this so when did numbers 26 happen it actually happened before they actually went into the land they were talking to moses i want you to see that this wise virgin these wise virgins they believed that israel was going to have possession we're ten spies didn't belief when they looked at the land say that land's two the people are two greats too many we're grasshoppers go back to giants oh no they looked at that land and what they seen enough of the message of their hour to say i believe that we are going to possess this land see what i'm saying once moses was off the scene they weren't quitting they weren't going to start judging his signs to see whether he was the true prophet hallelujah they it didn't matter it didn't matter that they heard that moses was a murderer they didn't go back in the archives and try to prove everything and try to find a thought with the word hallelujah but they received the message and they realized that moses was not perfect amen but they believed the word sign that came through that prophet amen that prophet said they will take the land amen therefore they believed amen hallelujah so notice this is beforehand they're crying out for these things you see they didn't just believe that israel is going to do it they believe that as israel walked through it they were walking right with them amen hallelujah so notice what they do though was it something easy they had to do even before israel had went for these people are complaining about manna these people complain about quail they're complaining about everything you can think of and these five versions they're just glad to be part of the company [Laughter] hallelujah they've seen enough when they've seen a pillar of fire by not in the cloud by day when they've seen the red sea open up when they've seen the manna fall amen when they see the quail come when they see the rock split open and give them water they knew amen that the message was right amen they could put their trust in god amen hallelujah but notice what they did they actually had to appeal they had to come with boldness and that's something what's revelations 10 say they had to go and say give me the book glory they had to come and cry out they had to take a step of boldness to receive inheritance remember women were like property then women were not esteemed remember that's why their lineages are rarely in there outside of tight form well whether you can see it that's why these daughters are here you see people look at them say it's an insignificant no it's a type of the bride amen if you want to make a rapture you got to go to christ amen amen hallelujah this message will lead you there but you're not just drawing to the messenger now notice they went to moses but they weren't going to moses because he was god they were going there because they knew that through him the word was going to come forth amen it's too late to turn back brother sister don't let the devil tell you nothing it's right amen amen that's why i dig this way brother says this is why god lets me do this i love it i ain't worried about no cloud the cloud isn't the one thing holding me it didn't say that the seventh angel you know it by the cloud say you didn't say you know about a municipal bridge it said you know it by the finishing of the mysteries amen if you're not looking at the mysteries you don't have the right revelation amen and those mysteries must be joined to the word amen don't you think god ordained a seventh seventh angel to be a seventh grader educated and everybody wants a perfect theologian really who's seventh grade here anybody anybody got a bunch of children here by eighth grader malcolm okay malachi come up here and tell me the whole mystery of god brother [Music] you think you might mess up a couple times maybe once or twice maybe once or twice but what is it they can't look through the veil of humanity they can't figure it out and what you notice what they do they intellectualize everything and then they miss faith yes sir yes sir you don't think that with all these you know four failed prophecies supposedly and whatever you don't think that the devil's trying to do everything he can behind the scenes to to to change the change what that is no the devil can't do that huh so he comes in the church every single time and tries to destroy your atmosphere tries to destroy your healing tries to destroy your faith from rising up and he's not going to try to discredit the seventh angel messenger that's insanity when he tried to take him out all those times [Music] but you see what it is they don't get it right and what they end up doing they end up what they end up moving their intellectualism above what the promise word is yeah yes sir it doesn't sound good so notice they had to go through moses in order to get the word of the lord they have a problem with that they came boldly in their season knowing where the word come from right yes that's why that's why rapturing faith is in this message is that the message but the message isn't just quotes the message is christ himself amen amen it's the word of god amen that's why we do this because we can see it in the word of god now notice it was the prophet that would give them their inheritance from the lord go beyond the curtain of time you can see the preview of the bride you can see what the seals are let's continue numbers 27 verse 5. i just hit one hour let me give me a little bit i got i got a little bit more to go a couple more i hope you can see this yeah beautiful see you see how this is it's perfect perfect i'm not in there yet but you're gonna get more excited because the word of god is that rich i'm not rich you're not rich he's rich he's the giver of all good things amen he is the one that led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men amen the one the only the lord of creation lord jesus christ amen he came love you and died for you so you can watch you can live out the son of god administration in the fullness of the stature of christ so what the word prophet do and moses brought their cause before the lord see moses didn't say aye you're women yep sorry sorry no go no go you're just property the lord came to moses amen all right moses brought up the cause before the lord and the lord spake unto moses saying the daughters of zelophehad speak right they deserve an inheritance thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them so the inheritance of the father the fullness of what he had was to pass to his daughters the wise virgins why do you think brother sister we read that quote and he said they never got so yielded so that christ could control them so that he could completely live through them in supernatural wonders in the word right why is that don't you realize that's the down payment of your inheritance hallelujah but god just doesn't stop there by giving you the holy ghost he takes you all the way through those seven virtues right to the place that i mean just like we have when when when they when god told brother brandon pick up your pen and write yes because you become so much like him that you're in his very image hallelujah yes sir the new race a powerhouse amen the manifestations of the sons and daughters of god amen amen so notice god tells them yeah they get the inheritance you know manessa one of the bigger tribes notice and thou shalt speak unto the children of israel saying if a man died have no son then he shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter and if he have no daughter then ye shall give his inheritance to the brother if you have no brethren then you shall give his inheritance unto his father's brother let's move on okay so just laying down the law that that watch god is showing that what if that man died and he was in the cause of the lord what he would have the father's inheritance [Music] well notice the type because it's really all about the five wise virgins so according to numbers 26 33 reading it again it says the names of the daughters of zelapa had were mala noah milka and turza now look what these names mean mala means infirmity but it has a double meaning of pardon amen so they in another uh uh translation of it they said disease disease and then pardon me mala the first one the second one is noah which means consolation or comfort and also rest so it goes from disease to pardon to consolation rest then hoga means his festival or it dance like you're living in the feast of pentecost oh my milka means queen hallelujah seems like it's naming out some characteristics of the wise version beautiful i like this one tirsa tirsa means benevolent and pleasing pleasing you know what enoch means pleasing so these five wise virgins even their names correspond to the wise virgins hallelujah notice so in numbers 36 for time's sake let's let's skip this part here but number 36 numbers 36 it they have a portion from 36 1 to 7 where the tribe of manasseh comes forth now that they've heard about these daughters and they want to know hey where's this inheritance going to pass from it ought to stay in our tribe so once again the lord has to command that the inheritance stays in the family of manasseh now remember menasha is joseph's child all right and in genesis 41 51 it says and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god he say it said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house so they had to stay in the family of manasseh which was the family where what the name actually means to forget all the toil and all of the father's house remember it was joseph that was what betrayed by the family and these five daughters you stay there i'm talking about the five wise virgins forget about how the denominations treat you if you stay in the your positional placement in this land it will make you forget all the troubles you've had to go through hallelujah get out of the dam [Laughter] hallelujah get out of there to sin come back to the fullness of christ amen or you in the rest of christ where you can forget all the toil all right i want you to see this very quickly joshua 17 1. we're going to close pretty quick here joshua 17 1 of course what is joshua that's when they take the land joshua 17 is what now positional placement i want you to show this because it's not like these daughters these wise virgins came before and just stopped but just like we had a caleb caleb came after he fought and he came to joshua he said okay i'm 85 years old give me my mountain where are the giants at give them to me i'll take them amen but what he boldly came and what he showed that he was enthusiastic and he was what he was putting the push on he wanted his inheritance amen joshua 17 1 and there was also a lot for the tribe of manasseh where he was the firstborn of joseph once again the firstborn joseph who joseph the type of christ for mackerel the firstborn of manasseh the father gilead because he was a man of war therefore he had gilead and deshaun let's move down third verse third verse says zelapha had the son of hebrew the son of god the son of macarthur the son of manasseh had no sons but daughters and these are the names of his daughters mala and noah milka and tirzah and they came near before eliezer the priest and before joshua the son of nun and before the princes saying the lord commanded moses we didn't forget the lord commanded moses to give us an inheritance among our brother therefore according to the commandment of the lord he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their father and there fell ten portions to manasseh beside the land of gilead and michonne which were on the other side of jordan amen so what did they do did they just let it go no everybody else has got the holy ghost everybody else's they came just like caleb he said moses promised where's it at let's do it i'm ready for my inheritance hallelujah but brother sister even look at it because the five daughters they didn't even have to fight the whole of israel fought the battle and all they wanted they had such a positional placement through their father all they had to do was to walk in the land with the church amen and they had positional placement amen hallelujah that's why the bible says he that's entered in has ceased from his labor amen hallelujah i hope you feel free brother sister you have an inheritance it's powerful amen it's loving it's last amen god promised you your inheritance if you have a different holy ghost you need to get the right revelation of it amen amen hallelujah make these little pentecostals run around look at that hallelujah amen that was perfected praise through these little sucklings [Music] now notice let's skip that let's go there galatians 4 4 almost done but when the fullness of time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons what's that positional placement and because your sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying abba father wherefore thou art no more a servant you're not just a woman but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ just making a statement there yes sir [Music] one more portion let's see if i can find it where'd it go [Music] one second lori thank you jesus got moved let's go back to numbers numbers 26. i want you to see this one more one more thing here number's 26. i got deleted out of my slide somehow but lord brought it back so i know you got to hear it so numbers 26 let me see maybe one second here we're in the right place so give me a sec give me a second yes sir hallelujah okay okay okay okay where'd it go where'd it go where to go okay here we go uh number 27. number's 27 here uh 12 first i want you to see this number 27 12 this is this is beautiful let me see this so this is just finishing the commandment to the daughters of zelophehad yes look at the next scripture and the lord said unto moses uh 12 verse please get thee up into this mount of baron and see the land which i have given unto the children of israel and when thou has seen it thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people as aaron thy brother was gathered for ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of sin and the strife of the congregation to sit by me at the water before their eyes that it that is the water of meriban kadesh in the wilderness of zinn what just happened here let's stand what just happened here the very last word from the lord that come to moses concerning the people right before he died was to give the understanding and revelation of the inheritance of the five daughters the whole cause right before the death of the prophet it finished the instruction for the inheritance of the five wise daughters of zalapa head so you see you don't need any new instruction it's already been given through the angel well wait a minute what was the purpose of the seventh angel [Music] the whole purpose of the seventh angel was to give the full instruction to the wise virgin [Music] [Music] oh i hope you can see that god loves you why do you think all these came things come down at the end of the message all these wonderful revelations about the trail of the
