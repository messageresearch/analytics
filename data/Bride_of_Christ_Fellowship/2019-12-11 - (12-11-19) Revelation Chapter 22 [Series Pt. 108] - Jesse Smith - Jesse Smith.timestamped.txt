[35:20] that one verse let's just do that we'll
[35:22] try to conserve time tonight by God's
[35:24] grace let's all read revelation 22 verse
[35:26] 1 let's read that together let's begin
[35:28] on three one two three and he showed me
[35:31] a pure river of water of life clear as
[35:36] crystal proceeding out of the throne of
[35:41] God and of the lamb they got as busing
[35:44] Torinos word may be seated tonight my
[35:46] country it's good to be in house
[35:58] Lord tonight praise God and good to see
[36:00] the Saints here Lord willing we'll try
[36:03] to look at revelation 22 I think this is
[36:07] part one hundred and eight so I look
[36:09] back and when I saw when I started this
[36:10] series and it was on August 21st 2016 so
[36:15] over three years ago so I've kind of
[36:17] stretched it you know of course I did a
[36:18] lot of series in the in the in-between
[36:20] but I've just tried to keep coming back
[36:22] to Revelation so like I can I can have a
[36:25] part of my testimony I preached the
[36:26] whole book of Revelation to you and the
[36:28] Bible says blessed is he then here's the
[36:31] word of God amen
[36:32] blessed is he who hears the word reads
[36:35] it but more blessed is he who keeps the
[36:37] Word of God
[36:38] thank the Lord a lot of people here a
[36:40] lot of churches hear it but it's more
[36:42] blessed to keep the Word of God to do
[36:44] the Word of God praise the Lord now I
[36:48] want to just start here with a few of
[36:49] the highlights here look at the themes
[36:52] here tonight there's three main themes
[36:56] that I see here of course there could be
[36:58] more but the first one is the the throne
[37:01] of the New Jerusalem the chapter begins
[37:04] with the throne and then it gets next
[37:07] into the supreme deity of Jesus Christ
[37:10] and then I feel like the the last and
[37:14] third theme if I could say there's three
[37:17] themes perhaps would be Christ's
[37:20] invitations his warnings and his
[37:22] blessings we see that in chapter 22 so
[37:27] let's look at those a little bit tonight
[37:28] by God's grace I got a lot of thoughts
[37:29] and more willing we'll just see how the
[37:31] Lord guides it so let's look at the
[37:36] throne first praise God quite a picture
[37:38] here of the throne it's described in
[37:41] verses the first six verses and we see a
[37:45] pure river of water of life proceeding
[37:49] out of the throne of God and of the Tree
[37:52] of Life and we'll look a little bit more
[37:55] at the trees here in just a moment we
[37:58] see or the tree rather and we see leaves
[38:00] on the tree have a purpose then we see
[38:03] the servants of God who look at and
[38:07] behold the Lambs face and serve Him
[38:10] and we see how the lamb gives light to
[38:13] everyone under this unending rain praise
[38:17] God of the New Jerusalem that's the
[38:19] first theme is the throne of God
[38:22] next is the supreme deity of Jesus
[38:25] Christ a major theme of the this final
[38:29] chapter doctor I don't know if you'd
[38:31] ever noticed this but I love this
[38:33] thought I don't know how this came to me
[38:34] maybe it was in the church age book I
[38:35] don't remember but it's beautiful
[38:37] Christ ends this book by reminding the
[38:42] readers of his titles from the opening
[38:45] chapters so in verse in Revelation
[38:51] chapter 22 verse 13 he said I am Alpha
[38:55] and Omega the beginning and the end and
[38:58] the first and the last praise God in
[39:01] verse 16 he said I'm the root and
[39:04] offspring of David and the bright and
[39:07] Morning Star hallelujah so he called
[39:11] himself Alpha and Omega in chapter 1
[39:13] verse 8 when John Psalm he called
[39:16] himself the beginning in the end in
[39:18] chapter 1 verse 8 he called himself the
[39:20] first and the last in chapter 1 verse 11
[39:22] he called him that he was called the
[39:25] root and offspring of David in chapter 5
[39:27] verse 5 and the church age book he was
[39:29] called the bright and Morning Star as a
[39:31] reward to the overcomer in Revelation
[39:35] 228 what is Christ trying to do he's
[39:39] trying to close the book by further
[39:43] Revere further proving that he is God
[39:47] that he is supreme deity not a second
[39:50] person not a third but the only person
[39:53] praise God and it's a beautiful picture
[39:57] because remember the word revelation
[39:59] means unveiling it means appearing it
[40:04] means manifesting it means the closure
[40:07] disclosure rather so it's the book of
[40:11] unveiling and so he starts the book by
[40:14] unveiling who he is he teaches on the
[40:17] great drama of the end times the whole
[40:20] church ages the last two thousand years
[40:21] of history and then
[40:23] ends by revisiting the fact that he is
[40:27] the first in the last he's the Alpha and
[40:29] Omega the beginning in the end and if I
[40:32] can quote Isaiah he was the everlasting
[40:34] father the mighty God the Prince of
[40:37] Peace praise God
[40:38] he's the all and all he sees the all of
[40:40] it he's the Amen praise God this is the
[40:44] great second theme is the supreme deity
[40:46] of Jesus Christ he wants the reader and
[40:50] I hope you're reading this on your own
[40:51] sometime soon praise God if you haven't
[40:53] lately hallelujah
[40:55] he's he's trying to convince the reader
[40:57] that he is the the one and only image of
[41:02] the invisible God and not just part of
[41:04] God not 1/3 of God but the fullness of
[41:07] the Godhead bodily dwells in him
[41:09] according to Colossians 2 verse 9 amen
[41:12] what a theme he starts off the book with
[41:16] supreme deity and he ends the book with
[41:18] supreme deity praise God the third theme
[41:21] is the invitation he gives the warnings
[41:26] and the blessings now numerous times in
[41:31] the chapter you'll see the scripture
[41:34] inviting the believer to come to Christ
[41:39] in verse 17 the spear and the bride say
[41:42] come let him that under here say come
[41:45] that him that is athirst come and
[41:48] whosoever will let him take the water of
[41:50] life freely praise God then he says
[41:55] surely I come quickly so he's saying
[41:58] come to me but he's letting you know I'm
[42:00] coming to you quickly amen
[42:02] to all those who come to me I'm coming
[42:05] to you praise God and then John says
[42:08] even so come Lord Jesus praise God it's
[42:12] the great invitation we looked at it a
[42:14] few weeks ago and the Bible says that he
[42:17] said whosoever will write verse 17 and
[42:21] whosoever will let him take of the water
[42:23] of life freely and we know it's not
[42:26] natural water because if natural water
[42:28] could give eternal life you wouldn't
[42:30] have need of the Holy Spirit praise God
[42:32] so it's speaking of spiritual water it's
[42:35] speaking of the Holy Spirit
[42:36] he's God amen so he invites all
[42:40] whosoever will let him come
[42:43] now of course his predestination and his
[42:45] foreknowledge knows who will come but he
[42:48] still must invite because we don't know
[42:50] so it gives us the Commission and it
[42:53] gives us the duty to responsibility to
[42:55] tell our neighbour about Jesus we have
[42:57] to because we don't know if they know
[43:00] him or not praise God it gives us it
[43:03] gives us ganas it gives us something to
[43:05] do
[43:05] pray God it gives us a ministry so that
[43:09] we can say we worked for the Lord we
[43:12] worked with the Lord we didn't work
[43:13] against him we didn't neglect our
[43:15] calling we worked for the Lord day man
[43:21] this great universal invitation oh it's
[43:25] so it's so wide open praise God every
[43:28] person has this great opportunity to
[43:30] come to Jesus Christ for waters of life
[43:34] but he also in the myths of the
[43:37] invitations
[43:38] he gives numerous warnings he warns us
[43:42] three times that he's coming quickly
[43:43] because three is perfection praise God
[43:45] verse seven behold I come quickly
[43:48] red-letter words next verse 12 and
[43:54] behold I come quickly did you catch it
[43:56] and then verse twenty surely I come
[44:01] quickly
[44:01] aha church it ought to put us on our
[44:05] spiritual toes praise God I behold I
[44:08] come quickly behold I come quickly
[44:10] surely I come quickly can he can he make
[44:15] it any more plain praise God
[44:17] now that word quickly if you look in the
[44:19] Greek I got a little definition on it it
[44:22] can mean quickly like in a short amount
[44:25] of time it can mean soon but it doesn't
[44:29] have to one of the definitions means
[44:35] without delay or soon or one of them is
[44:38] suddenly and we can see after 2000 or
[44:45] 2001 'only not to us we think suddenly
[44:49] is right now or next
[44:50] week or tomorrow but it applies both
[44:53] ways it's suddenly in God's time but
[44:57] it's suddenly as far as the rapture will
[45:00] be a sudden secret going away praise God
[45:03] so when he said behold I come quickly
[45:06] he means suddenly like a thief in the
[45:08] night praise God behold I come quickly I
[45:12] come like a thief in the night to snatch
[45:14] away my bride I preach at the middle
[45:18] school on Wednesday and the kids were
[45:19] like what he's going to come like a
[45:21] thief in the night and it's the first I
[45:23] could actually see in their eyes
[45:24] the revelation struck them that they
[45:26] realized the rapture comes before the
[45:28] tribulation
[45:29] you know these twelve and
[45:31] thirteen-year-olds and they just they're
[45:34] looking at me like all scared because I
[45:35] was saying like he comes like a thief in
[45:37] the night I said there's a thief kind of
[45:38] knock 8:00 p.m. and say hey I'll be back
[45:40] at midnight be waiting up for me have
[45:42] some hot chocolate ready for me no a
[45:45] thief's gonna night he's going to wait
[45:46] till you leave and you're on vacation or
[45:48] he's gonna wait to you're going he know
[45:50] he watches your move and then he's gonna
[45:52] sneak in suddenly without warning and
[45:55] Jesus said I'm coming back that way
[45:57] Church let us not get complacent with
[46:00] that let us let us hear that and let us
[46:03] act upon that let us be ready for the
[46:05] coming of the Lord he has to say it
[46:07] three times Saints
[46:09] behold I come quickly behold I come
[46:11] quickly surely I come quickly oh my what
[46:17] a gracious Lord no one be able to say on
[46:20] that day well Lord you didn't tell me
[46:21] you were coming quickly because it'll be
[46:23] your right there three times in the last
[46:25] book of the Bible praise God
[46:26] the last chapter of the Bible constantly
[46:31] warning repeatedly warning that I come
[46:34] quickly I come suddenly but he also
[46:37] gives multiple blessings praise God
[46:40] look at verse seven we all I come
[46:42] quickly blessed is he that keepeth the
[46:44] sayings of the prophecy of this book see
[46:49] it's more than just hearing it if I go
[46:50] back to chapter one I believe it's verse
[46:52] three if I'm not mistaken blessed is he
[46:54] that readeth and they that hear the
[46:56] words of the prophecy and keep those
[46:58] things which are written therein for the
[47:01] time is at hand
[47:03] see our time is so fleeting that the
[47:06] Bible is true by saying the time of the
[47:09] coming of the Lord is at hand because we
[47:11] don't know when our time is gonna end
[47:13] we've got to be ready at all times
[47:15] praise God blessed is he who keep the
[47:20] sayings of the book verse 12 I like what
[47:24] he says behold I come quickly and this
[47:26] is such an encouragement and my reward
[47:29] is with me to give every man according
[47:33] as his work shall be raised god amen
[47:37] that'll make you happy if you're doing
[47:39] all you can for Christ because we know
[47:42] you know your works are all day to get
[47:44] dedicated toward him you're all the
[47:47] money you have is for the kingdom of God
[47:49] or take care of your family or to help
[47:51] out pay your tithes and offerings how
[47:53] about the missionary and give people
[47:55] Bibles or give people money you know all
[47:57] your works are doing something to help
[48:00] other people praise God so he says I'm
[48:04] coming with my reward praise God and so
[48:10] these are the great themes we see of the
[48:12] chapter now there's more to that but I
[48:14] want to move on now let's look at some
[48:16] symbols and key revelations here and
[48:19] when I wrote this I think two years ago
[48:22] these were just some of the main
[48:22] thoughts as I prayed and studying and
[48:24] meditating on these were some of the
[48:26] main thoughts that kind of came to me as
[48:28] I was writing this so there's our the
[48:31] the symbol of The Tree of Life the
[48:33] servants at the throne the four still
[48:37] conditions the spirit and the bride and
[48:39] a warning to keep from adding or taking
[48:42] away from the book praise God now let's
[48:46] look at the Tree of Life
[48:47] look at verse two here in the midst of
[48:51] the street of it and on either side of
[48:53] the river was there the Tree of Life now
[48:56] I don't understand that either side of
[48:58] the river The Tree of Life I don't kind
[49:02] understand that I don't know if the
[49:04] roots are above-ground and the roots go
[49:06] down on both sides of the river I'm not
[49:08] even sure Church if it's a literal tree
[49:11] because both man of the church age book
[49:13] says the Tree of Life was Jesus and the
[49:16] tree
[49:16] nouns good evil was Satan so I'm not
[49:19] even sure it is a tree but we look at
[49:23] the tree and the bottom here we see the
[49:25] Tree of Life returning to the earth it
[49:30] could be the body of Christ and be near
[49:33] the throat of God so you find the Tree
[49:35] of Life near God's throne on either side
[49:39] of the river
[49:40] either symbolically or literally in
[49:42] Genesis chapter 2 and 3 The Tree of Life
[49:44] was in the midst of the garden because
[49:48] the sin of Adam and Eve the husband and
[49:50] wife had caused them to be denied access
[49:52] to the Tree of Life but now in the New
[49:55] Jerusalem the pure sinless holy
[49:58] conditions of the original Garden of
[50:00] Eden have been restored God's great plan
[50:03] of redemption has been completed and as
[50:06] he first gained preeminence in his son
[50:07] Jesus Christ then he gained preeminence
[50:10] to the Gentile bride of Jesus Christ the
[50:12] second purpose of God and now God has
[50:15] again a sinless husband and wife Jesus
[50:18] Christ and his wife back in perfect
[50:21] fellowship in an eternal Eden with the
[50:24] Tree of Life again hey Larry
[50:27] so the the Bible ends with uh we'd say a
[50:32] better we say a renewed image of the
[50:35] first beginning of Genesis praise God a
[50:38] husband and wife with the Tree of Life
[50:40] that's how we started but Satan got into
[50:43] it with adultery but here at the end of
[50:45] the world we have a husband and a wife
[50:47] and there's only going to be holiness
[50:49] and purity and faithfulness amen
[50:51] with the Tree of Life oh my this whole
[50:55] Redemption stories about a husband and
[50:58] wife why do they keep selling all these
[50:59] movie tickets all these romance video
[51:03] movies is because everybody loves a good
[51:05] love story and there's no better love
[51:07] story than of Christ in the church amen
[51:09] hallelujah so we see it back in perfect
[51:15] fellowship again is a tree of life and a
[51:18] physical tree I don't know to me I would
[51:20] think it's a symbolic but the Bible says
[51:23] that this tree of life bears twelve
[51:25] manner of fruits and yielded
[51:29] through every month and the leaves of
[51:32] the tree were for the healing of the
[51:33] nation so I'm not sure why there's 12
[51:35] other than you know God had twelve
[51:39] tribes of Israel so perhaps God will
[51:41] would divide the whole earth into 12
[51:43] sections and then each each apostle the
[51:47] Bible said will judge the 12 tribes of
[51:49] Israel
[51:49] perhaps that's it Amen I don't know
[51:52] because usually we know there's nine
[51:53] fruits of the spirit right but here
[51:55] there's 12 fruits and therefore the
[52:00] healing of the nation's the Bible says
[52:02] and verse 3 there shall be no more curse
[52:05] but the throne of God and of the lamb
[52:08] shall be in it and his servants shall
[52:11] serve them now notice it's so beautiful
[52:15] church the Bible calls it one throne not
[52:19] two Thrones one throne right and so we
[52:23] see it's they called the throne of the
[52:24] Lamb and the throne of God praise God
[52:27] because God is the invisible and the
[52:30] lamb is the visible brother Graham said
[52:33] he'll sit at that top of the pyramid and
[52:35] he said the father will hover over the
[52:38] son as a pillar of fire but the body
[52:41] will be the son but the pillar of fire
[52:43] will be the father amen praise God man
[52:49] so it's no two Thrones it's one throne
[52:53] the revelation of the Godhead the image
[52:57] of the invisible God Jesus Christ the
[53:01] program said that is the final resting
[53:03] place of the Heavenly Father's Spirit is
[53:06] the body of Jesus Christ now now we see
[53:14] the servants at the throne now this
[53:17] seems to refer to all the born-again
[53:18] Holy Ghost filled believers which would
[53:21] include the New Testament church and I
[53:23] believe also the 144,000 Jewish remnant
[53:26] because Daniel saw them in Daniel 7
[53:29] verse 10 praise God in Revelation 14
[53:34] verse 4 the 144,000 were called servants
[53:38] of God and the Bible said they were
[53:39] sealed in their foreheads
[53:42] and boy Darrin tells us who serves the
[53:46] husband but his wife praise God
[53:50] so we see Christ and his wife and the
[53:54] 144,000 those who are sealed with the
[53:57] Holy Ghost around the throne of God the
[54:02] Bible said that they have the right to
[54:05] live and reign forever and ever look at
[54:07] verse 5 and there shall be no night
[54:09] there and they need no candle neither
[54:13] light of the Sun for the Lord God giveth
[54:16] them light and they shall reign Church
[54:19] forever and ever praise God amen ah if
[54:23] we just thought were gonna reign for a
[54:24] thousand years we got news for you the
[54:27] reign of the believer is eternal praise
[54:29] God because God trusts you if God can
[54:33] trust you right now with eternal life
[54:35] praise God
[54:36] then he can trust you with that same
[54:38] life ruling over his creation for all
[54:41] eternity so see the responsibility never
[54:43] stops God children God's children born
[54:46] again don't run away from responsibility
[54:48] they accept it and they stand up in it
[54:51] and they reign with the Spirit of Christ
[54:54] but you see somebody that runs from
[54:57] their ministry or runs from their
[54:58] calling in life they're not born again
[55:00] yet because John's talking about people
[55:03] that are born again that live and reign
[55:06] with Christ for a thousand years and
[55:08] then the future home they reign
[55:10] eternally oh my thank the Lord see why
[55:15] it's so important as I've been preaching
[55:16] on your purpose to find your purpose in
[55:18] life because it's all time programs that
[55:20] whatever you are here you will be there
[55:23] you'll not be something new over there
[55:25] you'll be the same thing you were here
[55:27] so god help us to find what we're to do
[55:29] reign for Christ in that position under
[55:33] that office and that will be the same
[55:35] thing over there praise God amen
[55:39] beautiful I forgot about that that's a
[55:43] blessing my verse five I forgot about
[55:44] that
[55:45] whew reign forever and ever what a
[55:48] promise and that fulfills the promise
[55:52] that John said we'd be kings and pray
[55:55] and rain on the earth in Revelation 1 6
[55:58] at revelation 5:5
[56:00] ye are kings and priests unto God he
[56:05] said we shall reign with him on the
[56:06] earth
[56:07] praise God the next key revelation is
[56:12] the four spiritual conditions in
[56:14] revelation 22 11 he that is unjust let
[56:19] him be unjust still he which is filthy
[56:21] let him be filthy still and he that's
[56:24] righteous let him be righteous still and
[56:26] he that's holy let him be holy still see
[56:31] you'll find as we find out through the
[56:33] Bible everybody ends up in one of these
[56:35] four spiritual conditions to are saved
[56:38] and to her lost there's two that are
[56:43] worthy of eternal life the wise and the
[56:45] foolish version there's two that are
[56:47] worthy of the second death that make
[56:49] believer in the unbeliever this is all
[56:55] through the scripture Jesus tells the
[56:57] parable on the four kinds of grounds
[56:59] that's the seed falls on there's not
[57:01] three there's not two there's not one
[57:03] there's four kinds of hearts in Matthew
[57:06] chapter 13 2nd Timothy chapter 2 verse
[57:11] 20 says there's four kinds of vessels
[57:13] that God has gold silver those are the
[57:16] same or would an earth are the lost
[57:23] praise God I would say and we know
[57:28] church at the Jesus's crucifixion there
[57:30] wasn't really three crosses there was
[57:31] four right Jesus and the same thief and
[57:36] then Judas and then the lost thief
[57:38] there's always these four it's a great
[57:42] revelation that we have to recognize and
[57:44] we have to make sure that our lives are
[57:46] not our lives are beyond righteous see
[57:50] it's righteous to say Jesus Christ died
[57:53] for my sins I'm a sinner I repent
[57:56] forgive me my sins that's righteous but
[57:58] it's something else to say I want to be
[57:59] holy to let the Holy Ghost live inside
[58:02] of me praise God to dwell in my soul and
[58:05] have pre evidence and rulership over
[58:08] every area of my life that my life is
[58:11] more than righteous its holy praise God
[58:13] that's what a lot of churches don't have
[58:15] today holiness they don't want address
[58:17] holy they don't want to live holy right
[58:19] they don't want to talk holy they don't
[58:21] look at holy things but you and I should
[58:23] be holy rollers praise God amen
[58:26] we should be our names on the roll in
[58:28] heaven we should be holy rollers Amen
[58:30] our names on the roll praise God
[58:34] thank the Lord like I always remember
[58:38] what brother died he said he said oh
[58:39] yeah I like he said I believe in rock
[58:41] and roll he said Jesus is my rock and my
[58:44] name is on the roll in heaven that's
[58:47] never left me all these years I love
[58:48] that see the Bible still picks it up
[58:54] that whatever we are here will continue
[58:58] to be it for the rest of eternity praise
[58:59] God oh my I wish you make sure every day
[59:03] as we were saying on Sunday morning the
[59:05] Holy Spirit saying prove it make your
[59:08] calling election short prove it prove
[59:10] which side you're on he that's on the
[59:12] Lord's side
[59:13] let him come on the Lord's side praise
[59:15] God prove it make it sure that the
[59:20] devil's know which side you're on praise
[59:22] God let the Angels know which side
[59:24] you're on let your family know which
[59:25] side you're on prove it to everybody
[59:27] praise God live according to the
[59:29] dictates of your heart and if the Word
[59:31] of God is written on your heart you'll
[59:33] certainly live the Word of God
[59:35] thank the Lord Oh hallelujah
[59:39] praise the Lord now with a blessing
[59:44] great revelation it's laid right here at
[59:47] the end of the Bible the four types of
[59:50] conditions you can be in this last one
[59:56] here but I got a couple more the
[59:59] invitation
[1:00:00] yes the spirit and the bride say come
[1:00:03] and take of the water of life this is a
[1:00:06] key revelation because it shows God will
[1:00:09] always use men who are filled with the
[1:00:11] Holy Ghost to save other men praise God
[1:00:15] it's not the spirit only saying come
[1:00:18] it's the spirit and the bride saying
[1:00:20] come it's not the Spirit and just the
[1:00:23] Prophet saying come if the spirit and
[1:00:26] the bride because the Prophet is part of
[1:00:28] the bride well this can be more
[1:00:31] important church as we get closer to the
[1:00:32] end it's gonna be more important that
[1:00:34] you and I are the voice of God when we
[1:00:38] speak God's Word like brother a witness
[1:00:40] and that man named Michael that's the
[1:00:42] voice of God if Ray is speaking God's
[1:00:45] Word then he's God's voice to that man
[1:00:47] and who else
[1:00:50] Halas are your friends and family going
[1:00:52] to hear except you and i open our mouths
[1:00:54] and let God's Word flow out praise God
[1:01:00] the Holy Spirit always has and always
[1:01:03] will speak through the bride the New
[1:01:04] Testament church the Spirit does this we
[1:01:08] know through the five preaching gifts
[1:01:10] although they try to change it today we
[1:01:12] know in Jefferson middle they're
[1:01:13] changing they're getting rid of the four
[1:01:15] and calling all the other four tape boys
[1:01:17] I'm sorry they're calling the other
[1:01:19] three tape boys they got the Prophet
[1:01:22] brother RAM they got their pastor Brett
[1:01:24] rogram son and they make all the other
[1:01:26] three the tape boys they're all tape
[1:01:30] boys because nobody else is supposed to
[1:01:32] preach and see what they've done is
[1:01:34] they've cut off the Word of God who
[1:01:36] wants a hand that only has two fingers
[1:01:38] anybody want a hand that has two fingers
[1:01:39] huh no I don't so see to take one word
[1:01:44] away is to have your name taken out of
[1:01:47] the book of life and may God be merciful
[1:01:50] that Souls can find repentance and
[1:01:53] believe the truth or I'll trust by like
[1:01:56] I'll say like this that did it in
[1:01:58] ignorance if they never repent of it
[1:02:00] that they did it in ignorance that God
[1:02:01] can have mercy on them that's right see
[1:02:07] it's the spirit and the bride the bride
[1:02:09] is the mouthpiece of God on earth
[1:02:13] if you want to be ready for the second
[1:02:15] coming you must submit to the pattern
[1:02:18] Christ left for us praise God Jesus
[1:02:21] Christ the same yesterday today and
[1:02:23] forever amen
[1:02:27] so we see that clearly the spirit and
[1:02:30] the bride say come if you got him in
[1:02:33] here let me pull this quote up here I
[1:02:35] think I read it a few weeks ago maybe I
[1:02:39] didn't program said on numerous
[1:02:43] occasions that anyone can be a voice of
[1:02:48] God so Brad never said I'm the only one
[1:02:51] that can be God's voice but I've never
[1:02:54] said that
[1:02:55] now we know he is the prophetic voice of
[1:02:57] this age and the church said he's the
[1:03:00] voice the seventh angels voice but that
[1:03:04] doesn't delete or do away with
[1:03:05] revelation 22:17 right because they're
[1:03:10] still because if that voice is gone
[1:03:12] there still needs to be a bride's voice
[1:03:15] amen
[1:03:16] because God always has a witness he said
[1:03:18] I'll never leave myself without a living
[1:03:20] witness praise God that's right and
[1:03:24] brother a voice makes it plain he said I
[1:03:27] was only a voice that he used to say it
[1:03:29] uh it wasn't what I knew it's what I
[1:03:32] surrendered myself to that he spoke
[1:03:34] through he said that's not my voice it's
[1:03:36] my voice but not me using it
[1:03:38] he said that voice is speaking then was
[1:03:41] not my voice it was my voice but I
[1:03:44] wasn't operating it but I said listen my
[1:03:48] dad says I'm not his gift
[1:03:51] the Spirit is his gift raised God see
[1:03:56] many groups today worship the body or
[1:03:58] the flesh above the man and he says I'm
[1:04:00] not his gift
[1:04:02] the Spirit is his gift this is not my
[1:04:04] voice it just picks up my voice so
[1:04:09] whenever program says they'll say the
[1:04:11] Lord it's really not him it's God just
[1:04:13] borrowing the voice brother Ram is not
[1:04:15] the gift right but the Holy Spirit is
[1:04:18] the gift that we are still hearing today
[1:04:20] praise God
[1:04:21] hey bad that's right
[1:04:24] so true same thing with Elijah you say
[1:04:29] oh yeah Elijah was God's voice yes no
[1:04:31] doubt about it
[1:04:32] but it wasn't God's voice when he said
[1:04:33] he's in the cave he said I'm the only
[1:04:35] one left and God said I've got seven
[1:04:37] thousand was that God's voice I'm the
[1:04:41] only believer left all right which I
[1:04:43] would have been there two out of men
[1:04:44] saying the same thing you so would you
[1:04:46] right if somebody threatened us and we
[1:04:48] got in the flesh but God had to correct
[1:04:51] him see God one of them stay wrong God
[1:04:53] had to correct him and say you're not
[1:04:55] the only one there's seven thousand and
[1:04:57] having bowed the knee now look what
[1:05:02] brother Aaron says in the church age
[1:05:03] book three quotes the church is no
[1:05:06] longer the mouthpiece of God's being of
[1:05:07] denominational God will confound her is
[1:05:11] a false church system through the
[1:05:13] Prophet and the bride for the voice of
[1:05:16] God will be in her see who's God's voice
[1:05:20] in you next quote oh gods he said Oh God
[1:05:28] still has a voice for the people of the
[1:05:30] world even he is yes he has given a
[1:05:32] voice to the bride that voice is in the
[1:05:35] bride as we have said praise God amen
[1:05:42] you know let's just use simonez exam
[1:05:44] when Simon goes to Thailand and gives
[1:05:46] them perhaps perhaps sister Beatrice
[1:05:48] perhaps that's their only chance some of
[1:05:50] them be able to hear the voice of God
[1:05:52] right by the rain most people may get
[1:05:55] one chance to hear God's voice when
[1:05:57] Simon does a little Bible study and
[1:05:59] they've got a choice am I going to hear
[1:06:01] the voice of God or am I not gonna hear
[1:06:03] the voice of God
[1:06:04] because jesus said the end will not come
[1:06:07] until every nation has had the gospel
[1:06:10] preached unto them should we know
[1:06:14] brother Craig would go to Japan we know
[1:06:17] the different brothers go you know down
[1:06:18] to Central America and do great works
[1:06:20] down there they are God's voice God is
[1:06:24] speaking he's giving them a chance he's
[1:06:27] inviting them he's saying come drink of
[1:06:30] the waters of life freely he says it
[1:06:33] over and over come to Christ
[1:06:37] Jesus this is my favorite one right here
[1:06:40] because this this nips all those false
[1:06:42] jeffersonville doctrines that nip some
[1:06:44] right away but if said the spirit and
[1:06:47] the prophet and the bride will be saying
[1:06:50] the same thing and what they say will
[1:06:53] have already been said in the word
[1:06:57] praise God ain't it
[1:06:59] I love it because it makes me rejoice
[1:07:01] when I say what's in the Bible I know
[1:07:03] God's talking through me praise God when
[1:07:06] I turn down the false and I go away from
[1:07:09] my idea and I just preach God's Word
[1:07:11] that I know that God I can leave here I
[1:07:13] out here tonight and say thank the Lord
[1:07:15] God's voice spoke it wasn't mine
[1:07:18] he just borrowed my voice amen I'm not
[1:07:21] God's gift the Holy Spirit is God's gift
[1:07:23] amen and when he speaks the words of the
[1:07:27] believer it's God's voice and they've
[1:07:30] got to receive it remember that poem
[1:07:35] said the force the fourth seal in that
[1:07:37] preeminent preliminary part before he
[1:07:40] taught on the fourth seal the the the
[1:07:42] pale horse rider remember what he said
[1:07:45] but never said if people shout or jump
[1:07:47] during the song service or speak in
[1:07:49] tongues or scream or dance that's fine
[1:07:51] he said as long as they live right he
[1:07:56] said but that's not actually when life
[1:07:58] comes but man said life comes while the
[1:08:01] word is being preached they then see
[1:08:06] that's that's the sad part Church many
[1:08:08] times I see people more excited about
[1:08:10] worship than they are about the word but
[1:08:13] the reality of it is more life should
[1:08:16] flow to us as we hear the word and say
[1:08:19] amen to the word a life of God should
[1:08:21] come to us through that if we're really
[1:08:23] pulling on the Word of God amen you say
[1:08:26] show me a scripture for that I would
[1:08:28] love to show you scripture for that amen
[1:08:30] let's go to Acts chapter 10 well they
[1:08:34] have said it over and over life comes
[1:08:35] through the word yes you get refreshed
[1:08:37] when the song service is going on and
[1:08:39] you come in here discourage you're
[1:08:41] depressed sore tired and then real
[1:08:43] brother amen sings just the right song
[1:08:44] yeah that moves all the demons
[1:08:47] but now you still need anointing praise
[1:08:50] God I better have said that life life
[1:08:54] only comes through the word Amen he said
[1:08:57] the word is actually the thing that
[1:08:59] brings life the most happy you should be
[1:09:03] is during the preaching of the word amen
[1:09:05] at least that's how I feel amen I'm sure
[1:09:08] you do too
[1:09:09] acts 10:44 whoever said life the actual
[1:09:13] life comes while the preaching of the
[1:09:15] word is happening
[1:09:16] remember that Cobra I read to you last
[1:09:18] year program said he said if the
[1:09:22] preaching of God won't pep you up
[1:09:23] nothing will
[1:09:25] if God's Word doesn't move you then
[1:09:30] you're not going to be moved because
[1:09:32] Jesus said my words are spear and death
[1:09:35] no he said my words are spirit and life
[1:09:39] amen
[1:09:40] oh it's so important to just say amen
[1:09:42] and thank the Lord for the word and
[1:09:44] praise Him and worship Him well the word
[1:09:47] is being preached because the world only
[1:09:50] has live female acts 10:44 that's many
[1:09:56] times as we find out we find out who has
[1:09:58] the Holy Ghost or not like I said if
[1:10:01] people don't have it they only get
[1:10:02] excited - maybe during the songs or they
[1:10:04] only get excited during fellowships but
[1:10:06] those who got the Holy Ghost get filled
[1:10:08] with life as the word is being preached
[1:10:11] ah prove it brothers yes how does life
[1:10:20] come through the word right here while
[1:10:22] Peter yet spake these words the Holy
[1:10:25] Ghost filled up on all which sang the
[1:10:28] songs no I quote that right no it's all
[1:10:33] them that heard the word amen because
[1:10:37] light comes through God's will amen
[1:10:41] that's how life comes it's actually
[1:10:44] sitting there and receiving it something
[1:10:47] that would cause you to maybe fall down
[1:10:49] and cry and praise the Lord or rise up
[1:10:51] and say thank you it fell while he was
[1:10:54] preaching the word because life only
[1:10:56] comes through the word
[1:11:00] are they little yeah so the spirit and
[1:11:05] the profit and the bride will all be
[1:11:07] saying the same thing and what they're
[1:11:09] saying has already been said in the word
[1:11:11] I don't know how dark it's gonna get I
[1:11:18] don't know how many people are going to
[1:11:19] fall away or how small our churches
[1:11:21] gonna have to be or all these messy
[1:11:23] churches but one thing I know is that I
[1:11:25] find life and God's Word and will stay
[1:11:28] alive through the preaching of God's
[1:11:30] Word well them did not say the most
[1:11:35] important thing is someone who can push
[1:11:36] play on a tape he did not say that he
[1:11:39] said the most important thing of this
[1:11:41] day he said is a man a preacher who can
[1:11:44] rightly divide the word of truth amen
[1:11:48] the most important gift that this day is
[1:11:51] a man who can yield to the Holy Spirit
[1:11:53] to preach truth because the Holy Spirit
[1:11:56] is truth amen it is the Spirit of Truth
[1:11:59] the Holy Ghost will live the Holy Ghost
[1:12:02] Oh strewth amen
[1:12:03] and when you receive that truth to your
[1:12:06] situation when your struggle with
[1:12:07] different things that truth actually
[1:12:09] brings life amen and now you can walk
[1:12:12] out and face your giant or face your
[1:12:14] enemies with life because you're
[1:12:16] empowered through the life of God the
[1:12:18] Word of God amen
[1:12:20] hallelujah yes the songs will cast out
[1:12:23] devils and thank the Lord for that but
[1:12:26] now the house is just emptied out now
[1:12:28] it's got to be filled praise God amen
[1:12:32] glory I wanted to say that little later
[1:12:38] to preach about you just couldn't get
[1:12:40] away from it so maybe I'll preach again
[1:12:42] Sunday I wanted amen and bang to hear
[1:12:45] that you know all the saints and Karen
[1:12:47] and I want all of them to hear that life
[1:12:49] only comes through the word so we must
[1:12:53] we must be especially listening during
[1:12:56] the preaching of the word even if we've
[1:12:58] heard it before
[1:12:59] we must keep pulling on a pony because
[1:13:01] maybe we got to create an atmosphere for
[1:13:03] those who haven't heard it before or
[1:13:06] maybe we need another a greater
[1:13:09] understanding of that praise now who
[1:13:11] doesn't need more of God who doesn't
[1:13:13] more understanding praise God who
[1:13:15] doesn't need a fresh reality of the day
[1:13:18] of Pentecost and praying that it'll
[1:13:20] strike in your family praise God or to
[1:13:23] strike in your home a man or to strike
[1:13:26] on the job who doesn't need more of that
[1:13:28] praise God amen
[1:13:30] Bushman lawson's we had a baptism here
[1:13:32] who was the last of the bed got baptized
[1:13:33] was it Karras
[1:13:34] it's been too long praise God may God
[1:13:37] give us a baptism amen so no pressure on
[1:13:41] Victoria but she's three years old no
[1:13:43] she's four no pressure but what I'm
[1:13:46] saying is that we should long to see
[1:13:48] people saying we should learn to see
[1:13:51] people come to Jesus Christ because he's
[1:13:53] saying come because I'm coming quickly
[1:14:00] now listen I got too close to program
[1:14:02] says every person can be the voice of
[1:14:04] God and yet today people Jeffersonville
[1:14:09] will say there's only one voice of God
[1:14:10] you're not the voice of God brother
[1:14:11] Jesse you're not the true fivefold
[1:14:13] ministry until until you play a tape huh
[1:14:17] I thought they'd believe everything on
[1:14:19] the tapes but apparently they don't they
[1:14:22] only believe what they want to believe
[1:14:24] this is from 1957 believed from the
[1:14:26] heart I've seen it work and to think
[1:14:29] that if if you'll get into that contact
[1:14:32] with God it becomes till it isn't your
[1:14:35] voice anymore it's not your song anymore
[1:14:38] it becomes God saw and God's voice you
[1:14:42] are just a vine or a branch he's the
[1:14:45] vine who's God's voice you are when you
[1:14:50] can think God's thoughts and meditate on
[1:14:53] them and then speak God's Word
[1:14:55] now you're God's voice he said here's
[1:15:01] the next one church 1961 serves me would
[1:15:04] see Jesus God speaks through him he's
[1:15:07] normal his own but he's God's voice
[1:15:10] through the human lips and every
[1:15:13] believer in him tonight is likewise
[1:15:16] possessed so possessed so completely
[1:15:19] given over till his words become like
[1:15:22] the words of Christ every believer when
[1:15:28] they're so possessed with God's Spirit
[1:15:30] they become God's lips to them hear a
[1:15:33] praise God not just some believers not
[1:15:36] just brothers not just sisters but every
[1:15:39] believer when that possessed with the
[1:15:41] Holy Spirit become God's voice to
[1:15:43] somebody else not were they ever gonna
[1:15:48] do with those quotes well they'll never
[1:15:49] play those tapes so the people won't
[1:15:51] know they're you're exactly off the hair
[1:15:53] is that right
[1:15:54] they won't see they'll say what they
[1:15:59] want to say nope
[1:16:02] helps you I'm building that on
[1:16:04] revelation 22:17 the spirit and the
[1:16:07] bride say come and what they have
[1:16:11] already say will be set in the Word of
[1:16:13] God already praise God all right now the
[1:16:21] warnings about the contents of the book
[1:16:24] are a key revelation showing that God
[1:16:27] demands respect accountability and
[1:16:30] reverence for every word of God
[1:16:33] jesus said we live by every word that
[1:16:36] proceeds out of the mouth of God
[1:16:37] a revelation 22:18 and 19 says anyone
[1:16:41] who adds to the book of Revelation where
[1:16:43] plagues add to them anyone who takes
[1:16:45] away from the book of Revelation will
[1:16:47] have his part out of the book of life
[1:16:48] and the holy city mine is that right
[1:16:52] holy city oh mercy Lord that proves they
[1:16:56] won't even have a part in the holy city
[1:16:58] anyone who adds I've never seen it like
[1:17:01] that before
[1:17:01] anyone who adds or takes away loses the
[1:17:04] opportunity to be a bride member and to
[1:17:07] be in the holy city wow that just
[1:17:11] discounts a lot of preachers right there
[1:17:13] right discounts a lot of church members
[1:17:15] right there when they add to the word or
[1:17:19] they take away from the word usually
[1:17:21] it's take away like they take away the
[1:17:23] part about women having long hair or
[1:17:25] take away the part about men having
[1:17:27] short hair they take that away and the
[1:17:30] Bible said if they take away his part
[1:17:33] will be taken out a book of life and out
[1:17:35] of the holy city what a striking
[1:17:40] statement but see a real preachers like
[1:17:45] Paul in acts 20 20 verse 27 I don't read
[1:17:48] that because I'm gonna mess it up if I
[1:17:50] don't
[1:17:56] verse 27 here's a real preacher now look
[1:18:00] what Paul says for I have not shunned to
[1:18:04] declare unto you all the counsel of God
[1:18:07] amen Paul was in the when he went
[1:18:10] to those churches Paul laid down the
[1:18:13] whole thing he preached the cross
[1:18:16] repentance he preached justification
[1:18:18] sanctification baptism only ghosts he
[1:18:21] preached the whole Council of God he
[1:18:23] didn't leave anything out because he
[1:18:25] knew if he took away from it his part
[1:18:27] would be taken out he knew if he added
[1:18:30] to it the plagues will be add to him so
[1:18:32] he preached the whole thing and God help
[1:18:35] us to do the same thing praise God
[1:18:36] that's my desire to preach the whole
[1:18:39] thing preach the whole book of
[1:18:41] Revelation praise God almost done race
[1:18:44] God to preach the whole Bible praise God
[1:18:47] all the revelations all the counsel of
[1:18:49] Jesus Christ to this legacy in church
[1:18:52] age I must preach the whole counsel and
[1:18:54] not take anything away now if Sir prett
[1:19:04] added one word in Genesis 3:4 now that's
[1:19:07] a big word not not makes everything
[1:19:10] contrary it's a big word though one word
[1:19:12] with a big word
[1:19:13] remember proverbs 30 verse 5 and 6 tells
[1:19:16] us the same thing every word of God is
[1:19:19] pure
[1:19:20] he's a shield unto them that put their
[1:19:23] trust in him add now not unto his words
[1:19:28] lest he reprove thee and thou be found a
[1:19:32] liar see Church that's why the Bible
[1:19:35] said all the liars will have their place
[1:19:38] in the lake of fire
[1:19:40] that's why the Bible said Liars will not
[1:19:43] enter into that City
[1:19:45] God hates Liars because they're taking
[1:19:49] away from his truth God just wants his
[1:19:52] people to know what's right praise God
[1:19:54] to know the truth he said all Liars will
[1:19:59] miss eternal life think about that
[1:20:04] these preachers that are adding to his
[1:20:05] words or saying things the Bible doesn't
[1:20:07] say God will have the Bible laying there
[1:20:11] and of course their lives will be a book
[1:20:13] and the things and then there the lives
[1:20:15] the book of their lives will be added to
[1:20:17] the things that were in the book and
[1:20:19] Jesus will have to tell them you lied to
[1:20:21] the people I don't want to lie to
[1:20:23] anybody here tonight I want everybody
[1:20:26] here tonight to know the truth because
[1:20:27] the truth will make you free from the
[1:20:29] world of sin that's right don't add to
[1:20:34] his words he'll call you a liar if you
[1:20:37] add to his words or take them away yes
[1:20:40] they Adhan say oh yeah women can preach
[1:20:43] they add to the Word of God oh see
[1:20:45] Deborah was a Deborah prophesied sahel
[1:20:48] all women can preach now that's adding
[1:20:50] she was a judge not a priestess you're
[1:20:53] adding to the Word of God now if you do
[1:20:57] it ignorant Lee the Bible said God is
[1:20:59] merciful he winks at ignorance but they
[1:21:01] do it on purpose and they know what the
[1:21:02] Bible says then they're guilty of being
[1:21:04] a liar and God won't let them inherit
[1:21:07] the things of God because they lied to
[1:21:10] the people praise God thank God for the
[1:21:16] Spirit of Truth hallelujah my thank the
[1:21:19] Lord now the timing of this I'm moving
[1:21:24] on now to the timing the timing is
[1:21:25] chronological because it's the New
[1:21:29] Jerusalem is the first five verses at
[1:21:31] the beginning of verse six until the end
[1:21:34] of the book there's a break in the
[1:21:35] visions of the New Jerusalem and we're
[1:21:37] given repeated warnings and blessings
[1:21:40] and then we see three times Jesus says
[1:21:43] behold I come quickly
[1:21:45] I just want to go
[1:21:49] further for tonight I don't want to go
[1:21:51] too far because I got a whole lot more I
[1:21:53] could say here there will be so many
[1:21:58] liars
[1:21:59] look what the Bible says God is so
[1:22:03] worthy of your love how many believe
[1:22:05] that tonight
[1:22:06] the Bible says God is a jealous God if
[1:22:10] you don't love him the Bible said he's
[1:22:12] jealous that you don't love him because
[1:22:14] he gives you all these things he gives
[1:22:17] you life he gives you food and health
[1:22:19] and a body that so it works so
[1:22:21] marvelously right he's given us so much
[1:22:25] that if we don't love him he becomes
[1:22:27] jealous and look did you know that Paul
[1:22:31] pronounced this curse upon anyone that
[1:22:33] doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ did
[1:22:35] you know Paul put a curse on them 1st
[1:22:39] corinthians 16:22 he pulled up their
[1:22:41] acacia we already know Galatians 1
[1:22:51] he said if you changed the gospel he
[1:22:53] says your curse but here he says if
[1:22:56] people can't get in their hearts to love
[1:23:00] Jesus Christ they're cursed now we don't
[1:23:04] know how long that curse will last if
[1:23:06] it's just temporary maybe they'll get
[1:23:07] saved within their life like the thief
[1:23:09] on the cross right we know there's
[1:23:11] generational curses right remember
[1:23:14] remember David had three years of famine
[1:23:16] because of Saul's sins remember that
[1:23:17] David didn't do it
[1:23:19] we had to suffer with the curses of the
[1:23:22] previous generation many times whether a
[1:23:25] will suffer in life because of the sins
[1:23:27] of the previous generations yeah no
[1:23:31] doubt about that
[1:23:31] it's right through the scripture I was
[1:23:33] studying on that I kind of got away from
[1:23:35] it because I want to finish this but I
[1:23:36] want to get to that I want to get the
[1:23:37] generational curses and I was reading on
[1:23:39] that a little bit Maya there's so many
[1:23:41] things that we don't understand even
[1:23:44] brother Branham suffered a little bit
[1:23:46] he said because his dad was a moonshiner
[1:23:48] because he was in the alcohol everybody
[1:23:51] mistreated him and he had a bad name the
[1:23:54] brand name was a bad name because of his
[1:23:55] dad look at this
[1:24:02] first corinthians 16:22 If any man love
[1:24:04] not the Lord Jesus Christ let him be
[1:24:07] anathema maranatha first corinthians
[1:24:14] 16:22 anathema means a religious band
[1:24:18] executed accursed if any man doesn't
[1:24:23] love Jesus Christ let him be executed
[1:24:26] let him be a curse and Maranatha means
[1:24:29] our Lord has come it also means
[1:24:32] approaching divine judgment anyone that
[1:24:36] doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ your
[1:24:38] curse because there's an approaching
[1:24:41] divine judgment he deserves our love
[1:24:44] tonight we should be happy to come to
[1:24:45] church amen
[1:24:47] I know this guy doesn't like it but you
[1:24:49] got to keep slapping this guy say wake
[1:24:52] up a man wake up obey the soul obey the
[1:24:55] nature that's inside this body praise
[1:24:58] God because this body's under the curse
[1:25:01] praise God but see when you love Jesus
[1:25:04] Christ your souls not under the curse
[1:25:06] your soul is blessed amen your soul is
[1:25:09] fast weary praise God but anyway that
[1:25:13] does it love the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:25:15] cursed excommunicated and divine
[1:25:20] judgment comes upon him
[1:25:21] maranatha our Lord is coming in divine
[1:25:24] judgment and it's at the end of the book
[1:25:27] he closes the Corinthian work with this
[1:25:30] and this was the book remember this is
[1:25:33] the book of the man that slept with his
[1:25:34] stepmother said deliver that man there
[1:25:38] Satan that his soul might be saved this
[1:25:42] guy didn't play around
[1:25:44] Paul the play
[1:25:46] if they don't love Jesus Christ let him
[1:25:48] be cursed now look at this my look at
[1:25:50] verse 30 23 first he gives the warning
[1:25:53] of cursing but then he says verse 23 the
[1:25:56] grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with
[1:25:58] you I don't want the curse I love Jesus
[1:26:03] Christ so I get his grace amen
[1:26:05] I don't get his judgment I get his grace
[1:26:08] cuz I love him amen
[1:26:10] I love him because I keep his word amen
[1:26:13] he's in love with me is he that keepeth
[1:26:16] my commandments praise God amen
[1:26:20] hallelujah
[1:26:22] verse 24 my love be with you all in
[1:26:27] Christ Jesus he magic church the
[1:26:31] Corinthian could feel Paul's love they
[1:26:33] read his letter and they can feel Paul
[1:26:35] loves us why cuz he's trying to
[1:26:37] straighten them out he's trying to get
[1:26:40] them to obey Christ in everything he's
[1:26:43] trying to get their gift straightened
[1:26:45] out he's trying to get their their sex
[1:26:47] life straightened out their personal
[1:26:49] lives he's trying to get the whole
[1:26:51] church cleaned up and rebuking them but
[1:26:56] he says the grace of Christ be with you
[1:26:58] and my love is with you in Christ Jesus
[1:27:01] that's how you know somebody loves you
[1:27:03] they're able to correct you praise God
[1:27:06] they know if they've got to then they'll
[1:27:08] have to correct you at some point my see
[1:27:16] churches
[1:27:16] it's really not it's really not rocket
[1:27:19] science I mean either you love the
[1:27:21] things of the world or you love the Lord
[1:27:22] Jesus Christ it's what the other if you
[1:27:25] don't love Jesus Christ all that awaits
[1:27:27] is a curse that's what the Bible says
[1:27:31] that's why there'll be a lot of liars go
[1:27:34] to hell cuz they say I love Jesus Lord
[1:27:36] Lord have we not prophesied have we not
[1:27:38] done all these things he said I never
[1:27:39] knew your love you gave your love to
[1:27:43] everything else except me

[1:27:49] slave in this addiction you're a worker
[1:27:51] of iniquity you never loved me to begin
[1:27:54] with but who gets to heaven those who do
[1:27:58] the will of my father praise God those
[1:28:02] who did what father said are the ones
[1:28:04] that love me praise God not the ones who
[1:28:07] ran away from what the word says and the
[1:28:10] Bible says when people leave the church
[1:28:11] the Bible said they separate themselves
[1:28:13] not having the Holy Spirit you'll find
[1:28:17] the Holy Ghost filled Saint he'll always
[1:28:18] be with the Saints she always be over
[1:28:21] the Saints why because she got the same
[1:28:23] spirit if someone separates themselves
[1:28:26] they don't have the Holy Spirit very
[1:28:28] easy very easy to see praise God yeah we
[1:28:33] know those pretenders that hang around

[1:30:55] they never did in the first place bunch
[1:30:58] of liars and yet they can live
[1:31:00] physically pure their whole life but
[1:31:02] they lie and never love Jesus Christ
[1:31:05] there be liars
[1:31:06] they'll be cursed because they love the
[1:31:09] things of the world more than they love
[1:31:10] Christ that's right
[1:31:16] it was funny you know this is not I'm
[1:31:20] not you know I was get my haircut on
[1:31:23] Monday and I was having nice little
[1:31:25] conversation with the barber you know
[1:31:26] she's the owner there's a bunch of
[1:31:28] people there she's like going to get
[1:31:30] your Christmas tree up I said no we
[1:31:34] don't set one up I said we just do like
[1:31:35] a little nativity scene you know got one
[1:31:37] for the adults and one for the children
[1:31:39] just like you know no toys that the kids
[1:31:40] come in and boy the conversation really
[1:31:42] changed right there and I felt like you
[1:31:46] know now I've stopped preaching before
[1:31:48] trees not gonna send you to hell unless
[1:31:50] you worship the tree right because I
[1:31:54] doubters will not inherit the kingdom of
[1:31:55] God but even bro bran put up a tree so
[1:31:59] but for me church for me I can see right
[1:32:03] as soon as you start going a little bit
[1:32:05] against the grain of people everything
[1:32:07] changes you find out if they really love
[1:32:10] you or not so see we ought to be able to
[1:32:12] disagree with people and still think
[1:32:14] highly of them and still love them
[1:32:16] because we love Christ and we can love
[1:32:19] those who are lovable but we can also
[1:32:21] love those who are unlovable I caught
[1:32:25] that this week my soon as I said that
[1:32:27] was something against the great Oh
[1:32:28] conversation ends right now but you can
[1:32:34] still be kind you can still be sweet and
[1:32:38] I know if they're saying have a great
[1:32:39] week I'll see you next week for the
[1:32:40] haircut I'll see you in two weeks before
[1:32:43] Christmas with a haircut if they let me
[1:32:46] back in now Majan see it love it's

[1:32:56] wife I said I got to come up with a
[1:32:57] saying about Merry Christmas where I can
[1:32:59] say the name of Jesus and so I've done
[1:33:01] it three or four times this year people
[1:33:02] say Merry Christmas and I'll make sure I
[1:33:04] say yeah Merry Christmas thank God that
[1:33:06] he sent His Son Jesus Christ I say that
[1:33:07] and I kind of watch their face and see
[1:33:09] what they're gonna say so they're like
[1:33:13] covering like a man could speak that
[1:33:17] name Jesus you'll find out what's in
[1:33:19] their heart do they love it or do they
[1:33:21] not love it it's a good time the year to
[1:33:25] pull up that name of Jesus
[1:33:27] oh my what does it call that what does
[1:33:32] it all come down to it comes all down to
[1:33:35] love thank God that we love Jesus Christ
[1:33:39] what a blessing to love the Lord amen
[1:33:41] now looking at my notes here I want to
[1:33:46] make sure I get everything here yeah let
[1:33:50] me just find one more thing to close
[1:33:51] with by God's grace I'll preach one more
[1:33:53] message on revelation 22 yeah let's go
[1:34:01] to the last words
[1:34:04] revelation 22 I just thought this was an
[1:34:07] inspired thought what were the last
[1:34:13] words Jesus Christ recorded in Scripture
[1:34:17] you remember program said this is the
[1:34:18] only book in the Bible that Jesus Christ
[1:34:20] actually wrote how many memory said that
[1:34:22] because he told John write this write
[1:34:25] that write this write that write this in
[1:34:27] a book sending out to the people don't
[1:34:29] hold on to it
[1:34:30] send it out but Ram said the book of
[1:34:33] Revelation he said is the most official
[1:34:35] book of the Bible because Jesus Christ
[1:34:39] is the one who commissioned it to be
[1:34:41] written down a man himself
[1:34:46] and what's his last words Church in
[1:34:48] verse 20 he which testifies of these
[1:34:52] things saith surely I come quickly amen
[1:34:58] even so come Lord Jesus what beautiful
[1:35:04] words to end this letter the last words
[1:35:08] we'd read the last red letter words
[1:35:11] would be a promise truly how come
[1:35:15] suddenly truly I'll come quickly those
[1:35:22] are some beautiful words Church
[1:35:28] we have some other last words I remember
[1:35:32] the last words of Stephen who was the
[1:35:34] martyr the first martyr what were his
[1:35:37] last words he said I see heaven opened
[1:35:42] and I see Jesus Christ standing at the
[1:35:44] right hand of the Father
[1:35:46] Great God he said Father forgive them
[1:35:49] they don't know what they're doing
[1:35:51] laid out their sins to their charge and
[1:35:53] the Bible said he closed his eyes and
[1:35:55] went to sleep and the Bible said they
[1:35:57] threw stones at him and he died a man
[1:36:00] such notable last words what is he
[1:36:03] speaking expressing the desire of
[1:36:05] forgiveness the desire for salvation and
[1:36:08] it's very last words he testifies
[1:36:11] there's a God in heaven his name is
[1:36:13] Jesus and he's standing at the right for
[1:36:16] a right handed off road and he's here to
[1:36:18] forgive sins amen hallelujah what last
[1:36:22] what amazing last words those are church
[1:36:26] wonder what our last words will be
[1:36:28] praise God you know some of the last
[1:36:33] words I heard my coach remember my coach

[1:36:47] Christ for salvation and I recorded on
[1:36:49] my phone I know maybe I should not have
[1:36:50] done that but I did it anyway because I
[1:36:52] wanted to proof I wanted to see what it
[1:36:54] would this man say what are his last
[1:36:55] words to me gonna be I said are you
[1:36:58] trusting in Jesus Christ for your

[1:37:05] the blood of Jesus Christ he said yes

[1:40:10] after him praise God so God placed this
[1:40:14] thirst in every soul not the flesh not
[1:40:18] the spirit but the soul God placed a
[1:40:22] thirst brother Ram calls it a holy
[1:40:24] thirst God puts a holy thirst in every
[1:40:28] soul to have God satisfy that thirst and
[1:40:32] so Jesus ends the book the last book of
[1:40:36] the Bible by inviting the souls not the
[1:40:41] flesh not the spirit he invites the
[1:40:44] Souls come to me if you're thirsty and
[1:40:47] I'll give you the waters of life didn't
[1:40:50] the Bible say the Word of God is a
[1:40:52] discerner of the thoughts and hence of
[1:40:54] the heart and it divides asunder the
[1:40:55] soul and the spirit what does Jesus
[1:40:59] Christ the word during this last chapter
[1:41:00] he divides the flesh from the spirit and
[1:41:04] speaks right to the soul he said if
[1:41:06] you're thirsty for spiritual water if
[1:41:08] you want life come to me and I'll give
[1:41:11] you life he said whosoever will let him
[1:41:16] come
[1:41:16] whoever's thirsty for a change life let
[1:41:19] him come unto me but they have said if
[1:41:21] he had it made you like that for that
[1:41:24] holy thirst there would be an excuse at
[1:41:27] the judgment bar you'd say I never did
[1:41:30] thirst for God but there's no excuse you
[1:41:33] do he said you might make it your wife
[1:41:38] you might make it your car you might
[1:41:39] make something else you might go to
[1:41:41] church to try to satisfy it I have
[1:41:42] nothing against going to church but that
[1:41:44] isn't the satisfaction it's to find God
[1:41:47] the Living God the God of heaven into
[1:41:49] your soul that satisfies the Lord you're
[1:41:53] enforcing that you long for the man said
[1:41:58] he made you so you could thirst for him
[1:42:01] for his fellowship let's stand to our
[1:42:05] feet
[1:42:05] the last quote Paul said thanks be to
[1:42:09] God who gives us the victory through our
[1:42:11] Lord Jesus Christ that's the experience
[1:42:13] brother that satisfies that holy thirst
[1:42:16] that's in you it satisfies it you don't
[1:42:20] have to do anything else about it yes he
[1:42:22] said it cleanses you the holy thirst
[1:42:27] every soul has a holy thirst to it
[1:42:29] brother Ray that's that's just astounded
[1:42:32] me these last few months see I always
[1:42:34] thought the soul was either faith or
[1:42:35] unbelief but there's more to it than
[1:42:37] that because every even every unbelief
[1:42:40] soul still has a holy thirst to know God
[1:42:43] even though they're denying and not
[1:42:45] believing they wrote and said they still
[1:42:47] have a holy thirst or else they can say
[1:42:50] I have an excuse of the day of judgment
[1:42:52] and this last chapter is all about come
[1:42:55] quench that thirst you want to feel free
[1:42:58] you want to feel satisfied you want to
[1:43:00] feel forgiven you want to feel justified
[1:43:03] come and have some of this water
[1:43:05] hey come on we said over and over he
[1:43:08] begs them it's Christ begging them come
[1:43:11] knocking on their door knocking on the
[1:43:14] hearts door come let me in and sup with
[1:43:17] me and the spear and the bride say come
[1:43:22] him that year say come let him that is
[1:43:25] athirst come and whosoever will let him
[1:43:28] take the water of life freely Church do
[1:43:32] you realize what you're saying when you
[1:43:33] say come to church you're actually
[1:43:34] saying come take the waters of life when
[1:43:36] you say do you want to come to church
[1:43:38] because you know this judgment begins in
[1:43:42] your car no judgment begins at the house
[1:43:44] of God so when you said you want to come
[1:43:47] to church you're really saying this come
[1:43:49] for the waters of life because this is
[1:43:53] where God's Word pours forth yeah
[1:43:56] program should always stay where the
[1:43:58] Spirit of God is being poured out he
[1:44:00] said stay there day and night friends
[1:44:03] gonna be there tonight amen
[1:44:05] I feel pulled it out upon me praise God
[1:44:08] because I love Jesus Christ and I'd pass
[1:44:11] them the curse I bear into the blessing
[1:44:14] place guy hey man I see the curses
[1:44:18] forgiven me sister Beatrice I see the
[1:44:20] curses leave my life amen and I see the
[1:44:23] blessings of Christ rest upon my family
[1:44:26] my church this people praise God those
[1:44:29] that love Christ we see the blessings of
[1:44:31] God upon them Hunterdon they're not
[1:44:35] addicts to slave they're not they're not
[1:44:37] down to the depths of depression or or a
[1:44:39] suicidal tendencies you know or addicted
[1:44:43] to alcohol or addicted to marijuana or
[1:44:45] addicted to pornography no we're resting
[1:44:49] from those things glory hey man when
[1:44:53] you've entered in this rest you've
[1:44:55] seized from your old works praise God
[1:44:57] like Hebrews four says I've entered in
[1:45:01] the period of rest I'm not working
[1:45:03] trying to get to heaven I'm resting
[1:45:05] knowing that heavens already inside of
[1:45:07] me

[1:45:14] children praise God
[1:45:16] what notable last words surely I come
[1:45:22] quickly and like how John answers that
[1:45:24] he says Amen so be it yes even so come
[1:45:30] Lord Jesus you know just play uh play
[1:45:34] something soft there play uh keep your
[1:45:37] mind you know what do we do I want to
[1:45:38] keep your mind state on me you know
[1:45:42] church I was kind of impressed by this
[1:45:43] chapter I thought my something just said
[1:45:46] I just start looking on what about
[1:45:48] driverless cars how close are we I went
[1:45:50] watched a video on YouTube about
[1:45:52] driverless cars now they had said back
[1:45:57] in twenty sixteen I got the article that
[1:45:59] they wanted them done by 2020 if they
[1:46:03] just said they did an interview with the
[1:46:04] head CEOs and now they're pushing them
[1:46:07] back a few more years they said you'll
[1:46:10] probably never be able to own one
[1:46:12] because right now they're about four
[1:46:14] hundred thousand to build for what
[1:46:16] but they'll be like a service like a
[1:46:18] subscription service like everything
[1:46:20] subscription service now you got to
[1:46:23] subscribe to the carwash now I got to
[1:46:25] subscribe to the carwash now just
[1:46:27] because you get a better deal you guys
[1:46:29] subscribe to Microsoft Office you guys
[1:46:32] subscribe to everything the church we've
[1:46:37] never been closer to seeing that fifth
[1:46:40] vision come to pass but RAM said it'll
[1:46:43] head up technology will head up in a
[1:46:46] driverless vehicle they said that's thus
[1:46:49] saith the Lord in questions the answer
[1:46:51] 64 he said we don't got the roads for
[1:46:53] yet well now we got the roads for we
[1:46:54] don't got the vehicle yet I thought mine
[1:47:00] were just getting closer and closer all
[1:47:01] the time I showed you that video of
[1:47:05] Donald Trump 28 religious heads came to
[1:47:09] it said we've never seen such unity of
[1:47:11] the churches with the government we know
[1:47:16] it I'm not trying to scare anybody but
[1:47:18] we know it we're closer than we've ever
[1:47:19] been and that just proves what he said
[1:47:22] surely i completely heathens thirsty
