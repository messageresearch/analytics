[0:00] I preached last night in Columbus
[0:02] got home about 11 20 last night
[0:05] had a really good nice little service
[0:07] there
[0:10] so I'm a little worn out this is the
[0:12] fifth time preaching in seven days so my
[0:13] voice is a little teeny bit hoarse but
[0:16] it's a joy to preach the gospel we're so
[0:18] thankful for the Lord Jesus Christ all
[0:20] of his blessings all of his goodness
[0:22] Genesis 24 verse 6.
[0:24] the Saints have been really encouraged
[0:26] down there in Junction City and brother
[0:27] Irvin was telling me last night he's
[0:29] like brother I can't believe all the
[0:30] things I've heard just since March
[0:33] so in March he came in the message March
[0:35] April May June just four months he said
[0:37] our minds are just blown he said we our
[0:40] whole lives we knew nothing of this
[0:42] he says now it's just like every Service
[0:44] is like an explosion of Revelation
[0:47] Church they drove two and a half hours
[0:50] I'm sorry they didn't interacted they
[0:52] drove a whole hour last night for the
[0:54] service and then right back to their
[0:55] house and then they're having service at
[0:56] his house this morning so
[0:58] uh just wonderful keep those little
[1:00] babes in Christ in prayer Hallelujah
[1:02] if they're really really growing right
[1:03] now they're really enjoying the word of
[1:05] God
[1:05] Hallelujah Genesis 24 verse 6.
[1:10] I'd like to preach on Ellie easer the
[1:12] model servant just a it's a good message
[1:14] about brother Brandon's Ministry for us
[1:17] and how important it was for us to kind
[1:20] of ministered on that last night
[1:22] by the grace of God and the people
[1:23] really enjoyed it
[1:25] you know each service goes a little
[1:26] different depending on the needs of the
[1:28] people
[1:29] I had a brother he's got to be in his
[1:31] 40s and maybe 50s and he'd come up and
[1:33] he doesn't speak English so he had an
[1:34] interpreter and he told me he said I
[1:36] really enjoyed the message tonight
[1:37] especially as you minister to the young
[1:39] people our young people really need to
[1:41] experience with God
[1:43] he said I just he said I just want to
[1:45] thank you he said I hope you'll come
[1:46] back many times
[1:48] well if the Lord keeps my car going I'll
[1:50] probably do that
[1:51] but it was really great that people
[1:53] really people really enjoyed the word of
[1:55] God we all did it was it's a beautiful
[1:57] time I told Austin's testimony about
[1:59] being healed from the migraine last
[2:00] weekend
[2:01] other testimonies from the Saints so
[2:03] people really blessed Genesis 24 verse 6
[2:08] and 7. I'd like to preach on Eliezer the
[2:10] model servant
[2:13] verse 6 says and Abraham said unto him
[2:15] beware thou that thou bring not my son
[2:18] thither again
[2:21] let's read verse seven together one two
[2:23] three the Lord God Of Heaven which took
[2:26] me from my father's house and from the
[2:29] land of my Kindred and which spake unto
[2:32] me and that swear unto me saying unto
[2:36] thy seed will I give this land he shall
[2:40] send his Angel before thee and thou
[2:43] shalt take a wife unto my son from
[2:46] things let's have one more word of
[2:47] prayer here
[2:48] let's bow our heads here father God we
[2:50] thank you for today Lord let your
[2:51] kingdom come today let your will be done
[2:52] on Earth as it is in heaven we thank you
[2:55] Heavenly Father you have been perfect on
[2:57] our lives Lord God yes you've allowed us
[2:59] to go through trials but they've taught
[3:01] us so many lessons Lord God as I found
[3:03] in my humble short little insignificant
[3:05] life Lord everything I went through
[3:07] there was a purpose behind it Lord God
[3:09] and you spared me much worse things God
[3:12] you've been so gracious Lord God even in
[3:14] my sins you haven't punished me Lord
[3:16] like I would deserve as the Bible says
[3:18] in the Book of Psalms Lord even in my
[3:20] failures my mistakes you've been so kind
[3:22] and so gracious so I just want to thank
[3:24] you Heavenly Father for another day
[3:26] today to be in your house and Lord we
[3:28] thank you God for the loving fathers and
[3:30] the fathers that we all had Lord
[3:32] ultimately you're the great father and
[3:34] we just want to give you thanks and
[3:35] praise speak to us here today through
[3:37] your word as you did last night there
[3:39] father I pray you just be gracious to us
[3:41] let us hear your truth and accept it
[3:43] believe it and speak it act upon it Lord
[3:46] in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints
[3:48] said amen God bless you as you're being
[3:49] seated praise God
[3:52] I just have one picture I like to show
[3:53] here you know by God's grace
[3:58] and get this going here let's see
[4:03] does that work okay I'm just going to
[4:05] leave that up there for a little while
[4:06] this picture is in that book I gave
[4:08] everybody uh the message companion I
[4:10] just gave one to Nina and Austin and one
[4:12] to Zur just that's just a tremendous
[4:15] book if you haven't read that I really
[4:16] would encourage you to read that uh
[4:18] Marcus Beckers I think he's from Germany
[4:20] and he has a great grasp on the message
[4:22] he keeps a good balance he doesn't go
[4:24] fanaticism with any you know dreams from
[4:26] other Branham or Benny Visions he
[4:27] doesn't take anything to a fanatical
[4:28] level
[4:30] and uh
[4:32] so this is the text we're working with
[4:33] if you've got your Bible let's just read
[4:34] through this chapter here parts of this
[4:37] chapter if you're not familiar with the
[4:39] story
[4:40] Genesis chapter 24.
[4:43] um
[4:45] I kind of felt like I should preach this
[4:47] since I didn't preach it at our church
[4:49] so I thought I don't wanna leave you
[4:51] guys out if there's anything that you
[4:52] might be blessed by the people really
[4:54] blessed last night even Sergey got up
[4:56] and said the Lord truly spoke to my
[4:57] heart tonight and I thank the Lord for
[4:59] his word so chapter 24 is of course and
[5:02] this is kind of some semi from here
[5:04] we've been looking at Abraham
[5:05] and this is a uh Abraham sending Ellie
[5:09] easer to get a bride for Isaac
[5:12] so this is the picture of Ellie easer
[5:14] now of course in the store I think he
[5:15] had 10 camels if not more camels
[5:18] but in this story Abraham was getting
[5:20] old Sarah had passed away I believe if
[5:23] I'm not mistaken yes she passed away in
[5:25] the previous chapter
[5:27] Abraham had already been tested you know
[5:29] with offering up Isaac that was back in
[5:31] chapter 22. and so now Abraham's getting
[5:34] old and and God had blessed him in all
[5:36] things and I can say God's blessed me in
[5:37] all things too praise God hallelujah I
[5:40] trust you can say the same by the grace
[5:43] of the Lord
[5:45] and uh I just want you to me you know we
[5:47] can
[5:48] maybe just kind of summarize this a
[5:50] little bit but he speaks to Abraham I'm
[5:53] sorry he speaks to LA azer and uh makes
[5:56] him promise that he'll go get a a bride
[5:59] for his son Isaac
[6:03] and uh of course this makes Eleazar very
[6:07] nervous you know he asks questions like
[6:08] what if she won't come
[6:10] over then he's like then Abraham's like
[6:12] well then you're free from The Vow
[6:14] but he said swear to me Abraham made him
[6:17] swear swear to me you'll get a bride
[6:18] from my kindred and my family
[6:22] a church in those days you know there
[6:23] was different customs and in this case
[6:25] if you look at verse 2
[6:28] if I'm not mistaken yeah he said put I
[6:31] pray thee thy hand under my thigh now
[6:33] this is a little bit uh maybe
[6:35] embarrassing to think about but he
[6:37] hell the azer had to put his hand under
[6:39] the thigh of Abraham and promise that
[6:41] was how you promised in those days
[6:43] now just so you know
[6:45] there's been a lot Satan's really used
[6:47] that verse to create some evil things
[6:51] going down the realm of homosexuality
[6:53] within churches it happened over there
[6:55] at Ernest angley's Church
[6:58] just let you know I wasn't far away it's
[6:59] up in Cuyahoga Falls that was one of the
[7:01] verses that these people when they come
[7:03] out and they got interviewed
[7:04] it's just like Satan he'll take
[7:06] something that's good something that's
[7:07] holy and he'll pervert it
[7:09] so the preachers would use that verse to
[7:12] start touching men inappropriately
[7:14] it's the same devil that would say oh
[7:16] David and Jonathan had a love that was
[7:18] greater than a woman the same devil that
[7:19] makes that homosexuality is the same
[7:21] devil that misuses this
[7:22] I just want to be I want you to be aware
[7:24] Church you know with pure Minds God
[7:26] gives us pure hearts thank God for that
[7:29] but when people have evil motives and
[7:31] objectives they'll take anything like
[7:33] something like this something holy and
[7:35] sacred like this they'll take this and
[7:37] they'll use it for their lust of the
[7:39] flesh
[7:40] church one way we know we're with Christ
[7:42] Jesus is that he leads us away from sin
[7:44] into righteousness
[7:46] that's one way for sure we know God is
[7:49] with us hallelujah he's not leading us
[7:51] into sin he's leading us into Holiness
[7:54] he's leading us into a Godly life so I'm
[7:56] thankful for a church where we can have
[7:57] the Holy Spirit here praise God and
[7:59] guide us into more Holiness Hallelujah
[8:03] amen
[8:05] and of course uh you know he goes off
[8:07] and uh and he goes on the trip and I
[8:10] love verse 7 though and he said and he
[8:12] shall send his Angel before thee
[8:16] so Abraham says that angel is going to
[8:18] go before you Eliezer amen hallelujah is
[8:22] that is that beautiful how God sent an
[8:24] angel before Moses
[8:27] anytime God wants to make sure something
[8:29] gets accomplished he sends an angel to
[8:31] do it amen praise God
[8:34] this case it's beautiful because
[8:36] the type of brother Branham
[8:39] Hallelujah God sent his faithful model
[8:41] servant brother Branham to go get a
[8:44] bride before his son Isaac her son Jesus
[8:47] amen praise God I'm going to prove that
[8:50] by the Bible that's a total Bible truth
[8:52] amen
[8:53] but brother random had an angel and he'd
[8:55] always tell the people and angels with
[8:56] me and they could sense brother man
[8:58] could sense when the angel was standing
[8:59] at his side ready to do the sermon lines
[9:02] praise God hallelujah I'm gonna tell him
[9:04] the thoughts and and intents and secrets
[9:06] of his heart it's just beautiful but
[9:08] Church don't forget that you have a
[9:10] guardian angel as well
[9:12] Psalm 34 verse 7 and the angel of the
[9:14] Lord and campeth round about all them
[9:17] that fear Him and delivereth them
[9:20] think about any time in life where
[9:22] you've been delivered from Death
[9:23] delivered from destruction delivered
[9:25] from Evil delivered from abuse anytime
[9:28] you've been delivered it was your angel
[9:30] that did it praise God
[9:31] God sent his Holy Angel
[9:34] to keep you you know from dying you know
[9:36] when I almost drowned there I remember I
[9:38] was looking up I looking at the sun and
[9:39] said this is this is the end of me I was
[9:41] thinking of maybe nine or ten years old
[9:42] and all of a sudden my cousin reached
[9:44] down there Adam or Matt and reached down
[9:46] there and just pulled me up with his big
[9:47] strong teenage arms you know he pulled
[9:50] out little Jesse and I was I was dead
[9:51] but what was that it was the angel just
[9:54] moved him to do it praise God hallelujah
[9:57] or the time I was driving I was with my
[9:59] friend my friend Jason was driving we're
[10:00] driving a football practice out at
[10:02] Goodyear
[10:03] and he was saying he said I'm going to
[10:05] be a car driver I'm going to be a race
[10:07] car driver and he went 90 miles per hour
[10:08] and I'm like grabbing my seat like this
[10:10] dude's crazy oh God and he forgot her
[10:12] exit and then he tried to exit real fast
[10:14] we spun out it was we were probably
[10:16] going 70 80 miles per hour we spun out
[10:18] across four lanes the exit lane and then
[10:20] the three Highway Lanes I thought this
[10:22] is it I'm done
[10:24] I'm dead and we came about five inches
[10:28] away from the concrete barrier between
[10:30] the highways and as soon as we stopped I
[10:32] saw all these 18 wheelers fly by
[10:35] and I thought Jesus just saved my life I
[10:37] wasn't even saved yet I would have went
[10:39] probably went to hell had I died right
[10:40] there but what was it the angel of the
[10:42] Lord encamps around all them that feared
[10:44] God
[10:46] too many people had prayed too many
[10:48] prayers amen and God had a four-dained
[10:51] plan for my life praise God just like
[10:52] he's got a plan for your life amen
[10:55] there's a reason Satan couldn't take it
[10:56] there's a reason
[10:58] awful things that happened it was the
[11:00] angel of the Lord God had a mission for
[11:02] you praise God hallelujah God sent you
[11:04] to Akron Hallelujah God sent you here
[11:06] hallelujah with the mission to glorify
[11:08] God hallelujah and ultimately I believe
[11:11] for all of us to save some Souls
[11:13] Hallelujah we don't know how many but
[11:15] the Bible said the wise will try to win
[11:17] souls
[11:18] so may the Lord help us to try to win
[11:19] Soul so we get some beautiful thoughts
[11:21] in here
[11:23] now you're you're uh you're a good Bible
[11:26] reading church so we don't have to read
[11:28] it but Ephesians 5 verse 23 says uh that
[11:32] uh the the Christ loves uh I'm sorry
[11:35] that we ought to love husbands all love
[11:36] their wives as Christ loves the church
[11:39] so a husband and wife is symbolic of
[11:42] Christ and the church Hallelujah but I
[11:45] do want to read second Corinthians 11
[11:46] verse two so if you have your Bibles go
[11:48] to Second Corinthians 11 verse two I
[11:49] want to read that this may be a a
[11:52] thought for you
[11:56] and really I'll just say like this
[11:57] church really in every Church age
[11:59] Eliezer type the church age messenger
[12:03] not just brother Branham
[12:05] but everyone because of second
[12:07] Corinthians 11 verse 2.
[12:10] amen you want to read that since you got
[12:12] it buddy good thank you
[12:14] yeah second Corinthians 11 verse two no
[12:16] you're fine
[12:17] sorry about a second my phone second
[12:32] amen thank you brother
[12:34] now this is the Corinthian Church
[12:37] right so somehow when Paul preached the
[12:40] gospel
[12:41] he preached them Acts 2 38 right he
[12:44] would have you got to repent be baptized
[12:46] in the name of Jesus Christ you receive
[12:47] the Holy Ghost
[12:49] and all those that accepted when they
[12:51] when they confess their sins they are
[12:53] baptized it's as if Paul
[12:56] if I can get off my ring here
[12:59] it's as if Paul put a wedding band of
[13:02] engagement on their finger
[13:05] right and and so we see that and God
[13:08] sent a man to do that Glory Hallelujah a
[13:11] man so that's why this type works for
[13:13] brother random it works for Paul
[13:16] right it works for every every preacher
[13:19] every Church age messenger he's sent to
[13:21] preach and when they accept Jesus Christ
[13:23] the preacher engages them now you're
[13:26] engaged to Jesus Christ hallelujah amen
[13:29] oh it's beautiful it's it's completely
[13:31] bible-based but a lot of people don't
[13:33] miss it or a lot of people miss that
[13:34] because they don't have the message of
[13:35] the hour praise God
[13:37] and brother Adam said Paul will present
[13:39] his group that all those that got saved
[13:42] think of all the people that got saved
[13:43] millions of people that got saved under
[13:44] Paul's Ministry Paul will present them
[13:46] as a virgin to Christ amen hallelujah my
[13:50] brother random will present us as a
[13:53] chaste version of Christ Hallelujah
[13:55] oh it's so true
[13:57] and remember church I mean that's even
[13:59] scriptural since you're there let's go
[14:00] to Hebrews 13. even I even your pastor
[14:04] wherever Church even if you leave this
[14:05] church wherever you go to God bless you
[14:07] wherever you would go you know
[14:08] but your pastor's got to answer for your
[14:11] life as well
[14:13] right just like a father has to answer
[14:15] for his family a mother has to answer
[14:17] for her children
[14:19] so there's accountability under the the
[14:21] groups that that you're saved under and
[14:24] it's completely scriptural nobody can
[14:26] tell you this ain't the Bible it's the
[14:27] Bible
[14:29] Hebrews 11 uh
[14:31] I'm sorry Hebrews 13 sorry Hebrews 13
[14:33] 7-8
[14:35] and then there's another verse there too
[14:37] verse 7 says remember them which have
[14:40] the rule over you who have spoken unto
[14:41] you the word of God whose Faith follow
[14:43] considering the end of their
[14:44] conversation so any preacher must be an
[14:47] example to the people if not he's not
[14:49] fit to be a preacher
[14:51] and he doesn't rule by his own thoughts
[14:53] he Rules by the word of God the doctrine
[14:56] that I preach the doctrine that we
[14:57] preach here it rules all of our lives in
[14:59] my life included
[15:01] even in my own marriage I've always told
[15:03] my wife I said I never want to ask you
[15:04] to do something I'm not willing to do
[15:06] that's always been our agreement since
[15:08] the beginning and Wednesday is our 20th
[15:11] anniversary by God's grace so we made it
[15:13] 20 years courted or dated five years
[15:15] because we didn't know better so 25
[15:17] years huh it's hard to believe but 20
[15:19] years of marriage
[15:21] and then the Bible says
[15:23] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday it's
[15:25] saying forever
[15:27] so in context this has always been this
[15:29] way
[15:30] you have a Godly leader and then he
[15:32] Rules by the word of God he leads by the
[15:34] word of God everybody follows and that's
[15:36] the way Jesus has always done it praise
[15:38] God
[15:39] now go down to verse 17 is the one that
[15:42] I was getting to obey them that have the
[15:44] rule over you and submit yourselves for
[15:46] they watch for your soul see the
[15:47] preachers are supposed to watch for your
[15:49] soul make sure your soul is headed
[15:51] toward heaven
[15:52] right a preacher can't make anyone say
[15:54] right a preacher can't uh cause anyone
[15:57] to go to hell either I mean I mean you
[15:59] it's all the every individual has a
[16:02] choice
[16:02] but a preacher can watch over and say
[16:05] yeah I don't I'm concerned about the
[16:07] direction you've chosen
[16:09] and you really need to make sure your
[16:10] soul is right with God
[16:12] right
[16:13] as they that must give account okay so
[16:16] preachers must give an account that they
[16:18] may do it with joy and not with grief
[16:21] for that is unprofitable for you
[16:24] so this really tells us amazing things
[16:26] about uh uh the the Judgment seat of
[16:28] Christ and also the white Throne
[16:30] judgment
[16:31] each one of us have to stand there and
[16:34] for our own individual faith
[16:36] and then you know we we got to get some
[16:39] other verses where uh the Bible said
[16:41] we'll have conversations going through
[16:43] our judgment now hopefully by God's
[16:44] grace ours is only for rewards that's
[16:47] what we're believing because the blood
[16:48] of Jesus Christ forgives us all of our
[16:50] sins like we've been laboring on Amen
[16:52] amen so in other words we won't have to
[16:53] have disagreements with the Lord we'll
[16:55] agree with everything Jesus says amen
[16:57] amen but for maybe the foolish virgin or
[17:00] maybe the uh uh the goats whatever we'd
[17:03] say
[17:05] they're gonna they're gonna argue like
[17:08] like Matthew 25 says when did we see you
[17:11] uh or when we see you in prison and we
[17:13] never visited you when did we when did
[17:15] we see you hungry we never gave you food
[17:17] and he says and they'll say when you did
[17:19] it not to the least of these my brethren
[17:21] you did it not unto me
[17:24] right and then part of it Jesus will say
[17:26] uh why didn't you cross Jerusalem he'll
[17:28] tell the Pharisees why don't you cross
[17:29] Jerusalem to hear me preach
[17:32] and they'll say it was we were we were
[17:34] too too far in our denomination and
[17:36] Jesus will say Queen of Sheba queen of
[17:38] South rise up in judgment
[17:39] and she'll say I cross the entire desert
[17:41] to hear a lesser preacher and you had a
[17:43] greater preacher the greatest preacher
[17:45] the only preacher amen the real preacher
[17:48] close to you and you didn't do it and
[17:49] Jesus will say you're condemned
[17:52] because you didn't do it but here the
[17:54] Bible says this preachers have to give
[17:56] an account so at some point I don't know
[17:58] how it works during this process the
[18:00] pastors will have to give account with
[18:01] the church
[18:03] let's say brother let's say
[18:05] servant my servant brother Jesse or
[18:07] whatever brother cam
[18:09] brother Jim Shoemake
[18:11] given a cow of your flock
[18:14] and the Bible said the preachers want to
[18:16] do it with joy so how do you enjoy it
[18:19] the Bible said obey the word and submit
[18:21] to the word of God hallelujah
[18:23] just obey the word of God
[18:25] right that's what the Bible says and the
[18:28] preacher will give an account Hallelujah
[18:30] so I thought I'd start with that you can
[18:31] see a couple good verses there uh
[18:34] I just want you to see the power of
[18:36] prayer go to verse let's go back to
[18:38] Genesis 24 verse 12.
[18:41] Eliezer is very nervous I mean Abraham
[18:44] makes him swear
[18:46] don't bring back a heathen woman don't
[18:48] bring back any other woman from any
[18:49] other Nation it's got to be from my
[18:50] people
[18:53] so he stops with his camels and then in
[18:55] verse 12 he prays and he said oh Lord
[18:57] God of my master Abraham I pray thee
[18:59] send me good speed this day and show
[19:01] kindness unto my master Abraham
[19:04] and behold I stand Here by the well
[19:06] water and the daughters of the men of
[19:09] the City come out to draw now church if
[19:10] you read on he don't even know that he's
[19:12] amongst Abraham's family
[19:14] he just went as far as he could and he
[19:16] just thought well I'll just stop here
[19:17] and water the canvas everybody's tired
[19:19] isn't that awesome how God works out
[19:20] situations even when you're tired
[19:24] even when you don't feel like it even
[19:25] when you feel like you're you're Wit's
[19:27] End God still works everything out
[19:28] praise God
[19:30] oh my he's so faithful God Is So
[19:32] merciful in other words God is going to
[19:33] accomplish his purpose in your life amen
[19:37] and then he says Lord you know in verse
[19:38] 14 let it come to pass that the the
[19:41] damsel to whom I shall say let down thy
[19:43] picture I pray thee that I may drink and
[19:45] she shall say drink and I will give thy
[19:48] camel's drink also let the saying be she
[19:50] that thou has appointed for thy servant
[19:52] Isaac and thereby shall I know that thou
[19:54] shalt has shown me kindness unto my
[19:57] master and that's exactly what happens
[19:59] now look God honors this sacrifice look
[20:02] at this sacrifice I forget how many
[20:03] miles he traveled
[20:04] Ellie Asia travels all these miles he's
[20:06] under this obligation and then he's so
[20:09] desperate he just prays he said God I
[20:11] give you praise you're the god of my
[20:12] master Let It Be Lord Let It Be Your
[20:15] Will that the first one I talked to let
[20:17] her be the one that will water the camos
[20:20] and that will be my sign
[20:22] because they like this Gideon there's
[20:24] nothing wrong with asking for a sign
[20:25] Gideon amen hallelujah
[20:28] if you're in if if you're in the Lord's
[20:30] uh uh if you're in the Lord's will if
[20:32] you're doing the Lord's plan if you're
[20:34] keeping the word of God I'll say this
[20:35] and if you're in desperation ask God for
[20:37] a sign God will give it to you praise
[20:39] God
[20:40] if it's his will
[20:42] if you're in desperation you've made
[20:43] great sacrifice say God Give Me A Sign
[20:45] so I can keep my promise to you so I can
[20:48] keep your word so I can do what's right
[20:50] he didn't want to make a mistake church
[20:51] we don't want to make a mistake either
[20:53] praise God
[20:54] we want to do what's right Hallelujah
[20:57] I just want to show that with the power
[20:59] of Prayer
[21:01] okay now I'm not going to read all
[21:02] through the rest of this but you know
[21:03] the story Abraham after after Rebecca
[21:06] Waters the cameras I look she was really
[21:07] quick to serve
[21:09] now that's a good lesson for all of our
[21:10] people
[21:12] be quick to serve he didn't have to ask
[21:14] her can you water the camels she just
[21:16] watered the camels if I'm not mistaken
[21:18] she's willing that's a lot of water for
[21:20] 10 camels Church
[21:22] that's a lot of buckets you're carrying
[21:24] there that's a lot of water
[21:26] but she was willing to do it she was a
[21:29] faithful servant the Bible said she was
[21:30] already a Shepherd I believe I'm not not
[21:31] mistaken she's already in a humble a
[21:34] humble position and she just found being
[21:37] humble is a good thing
[21:39] right that's where God will find you
[21:41] that's where you'll find the answer to
[21:43] your question no doubt she wondered who
[21:45] am I going to marry oh all these
[21:46] questions in life but she found the
[21:48] answer by being a servant praise God
[21:50] Amen That's How we'll find the answer
[21:52] that's how we'll find God's will for our
[21:54] lives is serving other people praise God
[21:57] amen that's how you find God's Will by
[21:58] serving others
[22:01] and you know the story as soon as as
[22:03] soon as she she does that he's like
[22:04] Hallelujah he gets out the bracelets and
[22:07] the earrings now we've gone through that
[22:08] at our church we've preached on that
[22:09] many times I believe earrings were
[22:11] honestly earrings were just like tokens
[22:13] of like just like giving you jewels or
[22:15] just get like giving you money
[22:17] that's what I believe by God's grace now
[22:19] there was that one time the Bible said
[22:20] it hung on her face so we don't know how
[22:22] the earrings the Bible they hang on her
[22:23] face so I don't know if they're hanging
[22:25] earrings or what but we know that's Old
[22:26] Testament praise God
[22:28] hallelujah and we know that she'd have
[22:30] holes in her ears or anything like that
[22:31] because God told Moses that's a sign
[22:33] that you're a slave permanently
[22:35] so God would not ask them to cut their
[22:36] ears and have earrings so a different
[22:38] kind of like a maybe like a ceremonial
[22:40] earrings
[22:41] but she gets all those jewels and she
[22:42] runs back and said Dad look at these and
[22:45] and he's like what happened look go tell
[22:47] me about this man let me go talk I'm
[22:48] just kind of paraphrase it and and Eliza
[22:51] goes there and he tells the story how he
[22:54] prayed and Abraham and he said oh I'm
[22:56] Abraham's a nephew I remember him uncle
[22:58] or something like that some some family
[23:00] relation with Abraham I can't remember
[23:01] the Laban was his brother
[23:04] nephew okay amen thank you so some
[23:07] family relation I forget who laban's uh
[23:09] how the relation was
[23:11] but then uh labor said yes oh this is so
[23:13] wonderful uh Rebecca can go
[23:16] is like let's not wait too long I got to
[23:19] get her back as soon as possible
[23:21] right and then laban's like well I don't
[23:22] know about that and and they said let's
[23:24] let the woman decide does she want to
[23:26] stay with her family or does she want to
[23:28] go get married hallelujah oh my God and
[23:31] brother Anderson said that's like the
[23:32] Christian the Christian doesn't want to
[23:34] uh we kind of wait around the Christian
[23:37] wants to make the journey to go meet
[23:39] Christ Jesus hallelujah amen do you want
[23:42] to hang around and say with the worldly
[23:44] family she wants to go be United to
[23:46] Christ amen
[23:47] she wants to go with Ali easer back to
[23:50] Isaac amen we want to follow brother
[23:52] Ram's preaching until we see Jesus amen
[23:55] is that right David that's all I've been
[23:57] doing these last 19 years amen I just
[24:00] been following Brothers message because
[24:01] it's taking me to Jesus hallelujah oh
[24:04] hallelujah thank God
[24:06] so above them you know uh there's
[24:08] numerous sermons where he preaches on
[24:10] this
[24:12] but he just shows you know the urgency
[24:14] Ellie Easter one to he wanted to keep
[24:16] his promise
[24:17] and so he got he got he got her ready
[24:19] and brought Rebecca
[24:22] and then the Bible said in verse 63
[24:23] you're familiar with this likely 24-63.
[24:27] just to keep this the
[24:29] chapter it's a long chapter compared to
[24:32] some other chapters
[24:34] but as they're approaching the South
[24:36] Country verse 63 and Isaac went out to
[24:38] meditate in the field at the even tide
[24:40] and he lifted up his eyes and saw and
[24:42] behold the camels were coming
[24:43] and Rebecca lifted up her eyes and when
[24:46] she saw Isaac she lighted off the camel
[24:49] okay so this is we'd say love at first
[24:52] sight
[24:53] Hallelujah is that what you had with me
[24:56] honey did you love me at first sight
[24:59] of course
[25:01] but here's love at first sight this what
[25:05] this marriage was ordained from the
[25:07] foundation of the world Amen
[25:09] Hallelujah
[25:10] and brother Ram uses this end of the
[25:12] story to show the rapture
[25:14] Isaac's not in his house when he meets
[25:17] Rebecca he's out in the field and we
[25:19] don't meet Jesus in heaven we meet Jesus
[25:22] in the air praise God right it's a
[25:25] beautiful type of the Rapture praise God
[25:26] so brother and we know Brothers Ministry
[25:28] the word of God
[25:30] is going to take us to Christ it's
[25:33] uniting us to Christ and brothers says
[25:36] it's the camels that took that that took
[25:38] her to meet her husband
[25:40] and brother brother Adam says the camel
[25:42] is the power the Beast or the power and
[25:45] brothers says the power of us is the
[25:47] Holy Ghost amen
[25:49] and all you gotta do is water the camel
[25:51] water the Holy Ghost say I love you
[25:53] Jesus I love your spirit this word is
[25:55] true I believe the Bible I'll obey the
[25:58] Bible I'll let the Bible carry me to
[26:00] meet Jesus amen
[26:02] Hallelujah just gotta water it
[26:05] in other words just gotta ride it amen
[26:07] for 20 years my wife and I have ridden
[26:10] the power of the Holy Spirit praise God
[26:12] keep our family together keep our church
[26:14] together amen we're riding that power
[26:16] every faithful believer does the same
[26:18] They Ride The Power of Jesus Christ
[26:20] Hallelujah
[26:22] amen it's a beautiful type
[26:26] now verse 65. for she had said unto the
[26:30] servant what man is this that walketh in
[26:32] the field to meet us and the servant
[26:34] said it is my master
[26:37] therefore she took a veil and covered
[26:38] herself that's the last thing Eliezer
[26:40] says hallelujah
[26:43] to Rebecca this is your master
[26:45] so she takes a bail and cover herself in
[26:48] other words that's showing that Isaac
[26:49] was now her headship when she were like
[26:51] when you wear the veil there sister Nina
[26:53] we're excited for that when you were at
[26:55] that Bell that means I have no headship
[26:57] I'm coming under that I have no hatch
[26:59] above my own I'm coming out of the
[27:00] headship of my husband
[27:02] so that's why I was a custom see I think
[27:04] that's why the earrings are accustomed
[27:05] the jewels and the veil these are all
[27:08] Customs we don't find these in the New
[27:09] Testament right they're just customs of
[27:12] these early Saints
[27:14] and so she puts the veil on and then she
[27:17] goes up to meet her husband love at
[27:18] first sight
[27:21] Hallelujah
[27:23] verse 66 and the servant told Isaac all
[27:25] things
[27:26] that he had done hallelujah oh that's
[27:28] good right there the prophet tells Jesus
[27:31] here's all the things I kept your word I
[27:33] appreciate your word amen I traveled
[27:35] around the world brother Jose seven
[27:36] times amen I preached the revelation of
[27:39] Seven Seals and marriage and divorce
[27:40] anointed ones of the end times trying to
[27:42] do God of service without doing his will
[27:44] we could go on and on and on I did all
[27:46] that you told me to do praise God and
[27:48] this is she this is the bride Hallelujah
[27:50] and here's your husband praise God
[27:53] hallelujah thank God
[27:55] and Isaac brought her into her mother
[27:58] Sarah's tent and took Rebecca and she
[28:01] became his wife so they consummated the
[28:03] marriage and he loved her and Isaac was
[28:05] comforted after his mother's death
[28:07] isn't that beautiful Isaac loved his his
[28:10] new wife
[28:12] now look and they didn't even know each
[28:13] other five minutes before they had the
[28:14] wedding
[28:15] or maybe five maybe five minutes maybe
[28:17] an hour I don't know
[28:19] but they barely knew but they knew God
[28:21] was in this
[28:23] and all the trials as you can read on
[28:25] all the trials God brought him through
[28:27] all the other tests all their trials
[28:29] but what was that Isaac loved her and
[28:31] church that's what matters in this story
[28:32] Jesus loves us
[28:35] we know all of our love sometimes is
[28:37] failing it's inconsistent sometimes we
[28:39] fall short but the Bible records that
[28:41] Isaac loved her oh and the bar records
[28:44] that Jesus loves you praise God Jesus
[28:47] Loves Me Hallelujah he's Jesus is the
[28:50] one the Father Abraham father God is the
[28:52] one who sent the servant God sent
[28:54] brother Branham to get us a Hallelujah
[28:56] God said the word of God through
[28:57] Brotherhood so that we believe it and we
[28:59] be drawn to Jesus Christ
[29:03] like I asked that brother like I told
[29:05] you we had a brother recently a preacher
[29:06] leave the message but before he left I
[29:08] said brother what other group on Earth
[29:10] do you know
[29:11] that is qualified to take a Rapture they
[29:14] live the right life they believe all the
[29:16] word of God I said is there another
[29:18] group
[29:19] that could be make the Rapture outside
[29:20] of the message people he said no
[29:23] I said well that's good enough for me
[29:24] then he's like well I still think
[29:27] brother Brown was a certain certain
[29:28] thing I said that's fine you can believe
[29:30] whatever you want
[29:31] but you witnessed to it even though you
[29:34] witnessed to it you've left it but I'm
[29:36] staying with it because it's the Bible
[29:37] word of God hallelujah
[29:39] the truth of the Bible see what Satan's
[29:41] done he's trying to get everybody's eyes
[29:43] off of Jesus he's trying to get all
[29:45] their eyes off the Bible and get it on
[29:46] brother Branham
[29:49] Well church what if everybody stared at
[29:51] you and examined your life over the last
[29:53] 20 years
[29:55] and heard all your goods but all your
[29:58] bads too
[29:59] how many people do you think would want
[30:00] to follow you
[30:02] yeah
[30:04] I think I think we'd be disappointed
[30:05] with ourselves wouldn't we
[30:07] especially when his brother didn't have
[30:09] the Revelation on these things until the
[30:11] last three years of his life on some of
[30:13] these topics like the Seven Seals
[30:16] you know and the godhead and all these
[30:18] things that are so they're obvious to us
[30:19] now because it's been all these years
[30:22] the Holy Spirit just made it plain more
[30:24] as time goes on we just get more and
[30:25] more truth hallelujah but we got to be
[30:28] like we got to be like Rebecca thank God
[30:30] for Ellie easier he's not perfect
[30:32] but he was God's servant hallelujah amen
[30:35] and Eliezer told me about Isaac amen and
[30:38] Eleazar brought me to Christ amen is
[30:41] that right for the amen hallelujah is
[30:43] that right amen is that right brother
[30:44] Austin no other services have we been a
[30:46] part of where we felt the prince of
[30:48] Jesus Christ except in this message
[30:50] Hallelujah
[30:51] that is my honest and goodness testimony
[30:54] I was raised in church we went to
[30:55] Revival Services every year uh Monday
[30:58] through Sunday it was a whole week long
[30:59] but I never felt the prince of Jesus
[31:01] Christ like I did when I come to this
[31:03] revelation of God's word
[31:05] amen and I can it continues to be that
[31:07] way praise God
[31:09] it continues to be that way Hallelujah
[31:11] like William and I two years ago I went
[31:13] to all those churches and
[31:14] where are some good churches right
[31:15] Jose's family goes to one of those
[31:16] churches there's some good services but
[31:19] it wasn't the sweetness and the Holiness
[31:21] and the sincerity and the truth like we
[31:23] enjoy under this word of God
[31:25] that's exactly right praise God sorry
[31:28] I'm spitting forgive me guys
[31:29] I need to take out the row again or
[31:30] something like that
[31:33] but that's not that's God to honest
[31:35] truth
[31:37] now the reason I wanted to preach this
[31:38] yesterday last night to the Columbus
[31:39] people I was reading that book and I
[31:41] just I came over this story so let me
[31:44] read this story brother random is uh
[31:46] preaching in a shame 1965. he just got
[31:49] back brother uh from the Africa trip it
[31:52] was a disappointment to him he thought
[31:53] he's gonna be able to preach but the
[31:54] government would not allow it because
[31:55] they thought it would raise up communism
[31:57] all those people being gathered together
[32:00] you know the story
[32:01] but he's having this mind battle uh
[32:04] afterwards and he kept having dreams of
[32:06] he was a disappointment to his public
[32:08] utility job and then he had a dream he
[32:10] was a disappointment to God
[32:12] and he asked God for a dream and vision
[32:14] and he said I thought I wonder why God
[32:16] would bring me to the desert where
[32:17] there's nothing but scorpions and Gila
[32:18] monsters
[32:22] he said so I prayed for a vision and
[32:23] Mita just got me a Bible
[32:26] he says I went out and got the Bible
[32:27] said Lord in the days gone by you had a
[32:29] yerman thumb them
[32:31] he says but Lord it used to be when a
[32:33] dreamer Dreamed a Dream they took down
[32:34] the urum and told it and the urum them
[32:36] and flashed the lights back a supreme
[32:38] I'm sorry Supernatural light the dream
[32:40] was true I said but that priesthood and
[32:42] the eurom thumb is done away with that's
[32:43] a good quote for The Minister's marriage
[32:45] requirements I never thought about that
[32:47] um
[32:49] your Bible brother says your Bible is a
[32:52] eurom thumb now Lord may I never do this
[32:55] again but I've asked you and prayed to
[32:57] you to give me a vision speak to me
[32:58] about why I'm Dreaming these dreams what
[33:00] have I done if I've harmed if I've done
[33:02] anything to any person in the world let
[33:03] me know I'll go make it right what a
[33:05] prayer
[33:08] when you're having mind valves you're
[33:09] having bad dreams brother
[33:11] or your tormented sister by awful dreams
[33:14] go to God In Prayer say Lord I've done
[33:16] anything wrong I don't care who it is
[33:18] I'll go apologize that's a sincere heart
[33:20] right there praise God right in other
[33:22] words you don't want to have secrets in
[33:23] your life you want your whole life
[33:25] cleaned out
[33:26] I love that prayer
[33:28] he said Lord your urine and thumb is now
[33:30] the Bible
[33:32] and we're all we're all priests unto God
[33:34] are we not
[33:36] see each one of us should Envision
[33:37] ourselves walking around like this all
[33:39] the time and we if we have questions in
[33:41] our life we should be able to stop and
[33:42] say Lord you're you're the Bible All My
[33:45] Heart Lord please show me is this right
[33:47] or wrong and Church in that moment we
[33:49] can wait for the light to flash
[33:52] remember there's 12 Stones and if light
[33:54] flashed on the stones that was thus
[33:55] saith the Lord that's right
[33:57] and so we should do that in our lives
[33:59] Lord I want to examine My Life by the
[34:01] word of God lord is this right for me to
[34:03] do should I do this
[34:05] and then see if the light flashes
[34:08] see if God says this is right or see if
[34:10] this is wrong
[34:11] and then obey what the Bible says how
[34:13] many like to do that by God's grace
[34:15] brother Brown did that at 56 years old
[34:18] amen he was still doing that at 56.
[34:20] Hallelujah
[34:22] what a blessing see this is uh this was
[34:25] this is a model servant that's why I use
[34:26] that title the model servant when I when
[34:29] we have mind battles when we have
[34:30] struggles when we go through difficult
[34:32] times in life let's go to the Bible for
[34:34] our answers praise God
[34:37] not the Facebook like the Amish they
[34:39] just got on Facebook and I said that's
[34:40] okay you would just watch that now that
[34:43] can become a trap right
[34:45] not go to YouTube or run more not go to
[34:47] that for answers go to the Bible for
[34:49] answers no I'm not saying I'm not saying
[34:50] God can't use a sermon on rumble or
[34:52] YouTube that's fine but I'm just saying
[34:54] like we got to make sure we go to God In
[34:56] Prayer Hallelujah
[34:59] and then Brothers said surely there's
[35:00] something in this word from Genesis
[35:02] Revelation some character in there that
[35:04] you dealt with would be the same basis
[35:07] that would be my question in other words
[35:09] why am I out here why am I out here in
[35:10] the wilderness
[35:11] there's another quote late earlier where
[35:13] brother man said I feel like you haven't
[35:15] moved me for five years
[35:17] so that was the church ages it was when
[35:19] in 1960 was five years before this this
[35:21] was 1965.
[35:23] church have you ever you ever felt like
[35:25] it's been five years since God moved on
[35:27] my life
[35:28] has anybody ever thought that before
[35:31] so this is what he's going through wow
[35:33] five years I don't feel like I've really
[35:34] gotten any and look he'd preached the
[35:35] Seven Seals in the midst he'd already
[35:37] preached marriage in divorce but we all
[35:39] go through my battles church that's why
[35:41] I love this story amen
[35:43] someone who has so much Supernatural
[35:45] someone who uh who's human I mean he has
[35:47] so many testimonies but yet he's human
[35:49] and he goes through trials but he shows
[35:51] us the model way to solve any problem
[35:52] pray ask God for dreams ask God's
[35:55] provisions and then and everything go
[35:56] back to the word of God hallelujah
[35:59] and everything go back to the word of
[36:06] the word he says where I where I've done
[36:08] something wrong something you want me to
[36:10] do let me see some character in The
[36:12] Bible like that he said I just opened my
[36:14] eyes and I said I let the Bible fall
[36:15] open so I'm gonna try to do it here I
[36:17] gotta look though
[36:21] I'm trying to get to Genesis 24.
[36:24] somehow brother's Bible
[36:29] anyways it fell open like that and he
[36:30] said I closed my eyes
[36:32] and put my finger on the scripture and
[36:34] it was Genesis 24 verse 7. LA easer
[36:38] Abraham's faithful servant the model
[36:40] servant of the Bible
[36:42] ah
[36:44] being sent to hunt the bride for Isaac
[36:48] chills run over me I think chill's about
[36:50] ready to run over me too amen thank God
[36:53] Amen Hallelujah there's one time I did
[36:55] that in my life when I when I I didn't
[36:56] know if I should be the pastor of this
[36:58] church or not I remember I was upstairs
[36:59] Lydia might have been in the bathroom
[37:00] they might have had their towels they
[37:02] got done with the bath I was reading my
[37:03] Bible there
[37:04] I said Lord should I take this church or
[37:06] not should I be a pastor you know Tim
[37:08] Myers moved away should we have a church
[37:10] I just said I opened up the Bible I
[37:12] didn't put my finger I just opened the
[37:13] Bible
[37:14] and you probably remember this
[37:16] and it went to is it first Timothy
[37:19] four
[37:20] or second Timothy 4.
[37:22] First Timothy 4 First Timothy 4.
[37:27] First Timothy 4 12. I just closed my
[37:30] eyes I said Lord should I take this open
[37:31] up the Bible and it says let no man
[37:33] despise your youth I was a 25 year old
[37:36] preacher I've only been preaching two
[37:38] years
[37:39] be thou an example of the Believers in
[37:41] word and conversation and charity in
[37:44] spirit and faith and purity
[37:47] and didn't we read earlier in Hebrews 13
[37:49] the preachers must be the examples
[37:52] so when that happened at Austin I knew I
[37:53] was called the pastor
[37:55] and now we now we got the we got the
[37:57] benefit of hindsight's 2020. we just
[38:00] passed our 17th year anniversary has
[38:02] brother Jesse been the example for 17
[38:04] years I believe I have by God's grace a
[38:07] model servant I mean I'm trying to by
[38:09] God's grace I'm not perfect
[38:10] but I want to be as close to the Bible
[38:12] as I can amen
[38:14] so I know what brother Rand went through
[38:16] because I had to go through the same
[38:17] thing and I haven't done it since I'm
[38:19] not telling you every night oh God
[38:20] should I buy this or should I do that
[38:21] should I do where should I wear tomorrow
[38:26] wear something holy praise God that's
[38:27] what you should wear
[38:29] I'm talking in a moment of desperation
[38:31] I said God should I be that and my eyes
[38:34] directly and I already highlighted that
[38:35] First Corinthians 4 12 and I said that's
[38:37] exactly right and that's what I desire
[38:39] to be
[38:40] and I've had numerous people come in
[38:42] pray even guest preachers and say
[38:43] brother Jesse has an excellent spirit
[38:45] and uh and then recently like I told you
[38:48] people come from all over and say
[38:50] there's the real love of God here now
[38:52] brother Brown said he said give me a
[38:54] choice of either all the gifts or love
[38:56] he said and I'll take the love of God
[38:58] because the love will produce the gifts
[39:01] praise God
[39:02] so that's just from my experience that's
[39:03] how my life relates to that and chills
[39:06] run over me when I when I saw that first
[39:08] Timothy 4 12. chills run over me said he
[39:11] said that's the rest that's right in
[39:13] line with the rest of my message pulling
[39:15] out the bride
[39:17] he said just a perfect message back to
[39:19] the word he said go get that bride
[39:21] that's a duty that's what I'm here for
[39:23] that's what I'm trying to do is call out
[39:25] a bride
[39:27] so God spoke to brother Branham Through
[39:29] the Bible in his moment of desperation
[39:32] in this moment of feeling lonely in this
[39:35] moment of feeling I haven't done nothing
[39:36] for five years God spoke Through the
[39:38] Bible and brother random said oh I can
[39:40] identify I'm getting a bride ready for
[39:42] Jesus Christ and you and I are that
[39:44] bride hallelujah amen I believe it I
[39:48] know it with all my heart I'm that bride
[39:50] hallelujah amen I'm Rebecca praise God I
[39:53] want to see Jesus amen hallelujah I want
[39:55] to go meet Embrace God and I know all
[39:58] the other preachers brother Austin I've
[39:59] been around to say wow now all these
[40:01] other preachers are not leading us
[40:02] really to Christ a lot of them are
[40:03] leading us to money and prosperity
[40:06] other ones are leading people to lust of
[40:08] the Flesh and pride of life
[40:10] right they're leading them the wrong way
[40:12] but this message leads us to Jesus
[40:15] Christ
[40:16] at home in my office I got that sign I
[40:18] got it from Brother cam we don't change
[40:20] the message the message changes us
[40:24] the message changed me to a dancing
[40:25] pastor
[40:27] before I was real stiff and starchy
[40:30] but nah the message if the Bible says it
[40:33] I believe it that settles it praise God
[40:36] and now when it's a season of Dance I
[40:38] can dance and praise God hallelujah if
[40:40] it's a seasonal mourning we can mourn
[40:42] and weep and cry
[40:45] for losses in the family or losses we
[40:47] can mourn
[40:48] over things but when it's time to
[40:50] Rejoice Let's Dance a child has
[40:52] graduated amen
[40:54] glory amen the faith and the faithful
[40:56] servant praise God
[40:58] you can recognize times of dance and
[41:00] Times of mourning the message changes us
[41:05] the message is changing me
[41:07] I trust the message is changing you
[41:11] Hallelujah
[41:13] now later in the same sermon brother Ram
[41:15] says these thoughts I want to just
[41:17] briefly go over these real quick here
[41:19] brother Brown said any spirit that would
[41:21] tell you you're saved and give you a
[41:23] glorious feeling that would shout and
[41:25] scream and then that Spirit denies the
[41:27] word of God how can that be the Holy
[41:29] Spirit
[41:30] so now we're talking about Pentecostals
[41:32] or anyone who has emotion but they deny
[41:35] the word of God not us because we
[41:37] shouldn't be deniers we should be
[41:38] obeyers
[41:40] obeyers of the word
[41:42] that the spirit of God must punctuate
[41:45] every promise of God with an amen if it
[41:48] isn't then you haven't met God you met a
[41:51] deceiving Spirit and the world's full of
[41:53] it today
[41:55] and then he goes to say how can a spirit
[41:57] be on a man the holy spirit that wrote
[41:59] this Bible then turn around and deny and
[42:02] say that's not right that was for some
[42:03] other day
[42:04] right Hallelujah
[42:08] so I want to just say brother Brown
[42:10] found his answer to his question in the
[42:12] Bible he found it by pointing to the
[42:14] scripture and we can do the same
[42:17] when we have questions in our lives or
[42:19] troubles in our lives we've got to point
[42:21] to the verse that's going to give us the
[42:22] victory
[42:24] as we've been showing with Abraham amen
[42:26] Abraham believe God Abraham called it
[42:29] not as though it was praise God
[42:31] he called it as though it was and
[42:34] Eleazar only pointed Rebecca to Isaac
[42:37] and Abraham that's all he talks about I
[42:39] got to get you back for Isaac I got to
[42:41] get you ready for Isaac
[42:42] I got to get you ready for Abraham I got
[42:44] to keep my promise to Abraham praise God
[42:47] he was there he was only pointing to the
[42:49] father and son that's all we do is point
[42:51] to God Almighty Hallelujah
[42:54] he didn't point to himself
[42:58] brother Brandon said his seven sealed
[42:59] sermons I preach this on Thursday at the
[43:01] Amish Junction City people
[43:03] program said those Seven Seals
[43:06] he says if I ever preach anything in a
[43:09] sermon inspired it was the tapes of the
[43:12] Seven Seals
[43:14] he says if you ever heard anything
[43:15] that's really as I can say it's thus
[43:17] saith the Lord get those so if you want
[43:19] to hear from God and you haven't
[43:20] listened to brother Brown lately play
[43:22] The Seven Seals
[43:24] Hallelujah
[43:25] or I like I also I like the questions
[43:27] and answers 64. those are some powerful
[43:30] I listened to those a couple months ago
[43:33] yesterday I was listening to souls that
[43:34] are in prison oh and ashamed ashamed
[43:36] 1965.
[43:38] now even when brother man was preaching
[43:40] the greatest sermons he ever was a part
[43:42] of the seventh seal he said I am hoping
[43:44] and trusting you people realize I'm
[43:45] trying to put this grace on Jesus Christ
[43:47] who's the author of all of it and the
[43:50] own yeah the author of of all of it
[43:53] he says always bear in mind you be a gem
[43:57] in the crown of Jesus Christ
[44:00] imagine you are a gem in Jesus's crown
[44:04] Hallelujah you're one of those shiny
[44:07] gems
[44:10] we want to be gems in the crown of Jesus
[44:13] Christ we don't never want to put a man
[44:15] in you forget anything about me I'm your
[44:17] brother I'm a sinner saved by grace not
[44:19] fit to live that's exactly the truth I
[44:21] ain't saying that to be humble that's
[44:23] facts there's nothing in me not one
[44:25] sound thing at all but by the grace of
[44:27] God God has let my poor dimming eyes
[44:29] look beyond the curtain of time and see
[44:31] those things Beyond Yonder amen
[44:34] hallelujah I love the humility of
[44:36] Eleazar
[44:38] I love the humility of brother Brown did
[44:40] you ever hear this story brother and
[44:41] told about the cult
[44:43] who was on the Jewish farm did anybody
[44:44] anyone remember that story
[44:46] okay bear with me let me tell this story
[44:48] you'll like to start but I said I
[44:49] remember her little story
[44:51] it's a fiction story so it's a made-up
[44:53] story under the law the Jews
[44:57] uh one of the Jews had an old mother
[44:59] horse who had a little cult and he was a
[45:02] mule you know his ears broke down his
[45:04] knees knocked so can you imagine a knee
[45:06] knocking mule just walking out there
[45:09] little mule ears hung down
[45:12] not very handsome yet
[45:14] he says and oh a cross-eyed horrible
[45:17] looking mule so can I do a cross side
[45:18] there
[45:19] look at this it just looks like a
[45:21] Misfit animal
[45:23] said well if that mule could look at
[45:25] himself and say oh my when the master
[45:27] comes out he'll kill me he wouldn't feed
[45:29] me I'm not worthy so look at me what a
[45:32] horrible looking mess I am
[45:34] but if the mother could speak the mother
[45:35] horse
[45:38] he would say to the little fellow she'd
[45:40] say wait a minute honey you can live
[45:42] because you're my first and you have a
[45:44] Birthright
[45:46] now when the master comes out and sees
[45:48] you and you're all in your condition he
[45:50] has to go and get a lamb without a
[45:52] blemish on it and kill it so that the
[45:54] crippled up looking mule could live
[45:57] but I said you see the priest never seen
[45:59] the mule he saw the lamb it wasn't
[46:02] whether the mule was perfect it had to
[46:04] be a perfect lamb
[46:06] so the mule said I'm not worthy to live
[46:08] I I'm not worthy I'm nothing my life's a
[46:11] messed up I'm a misfit look at me I got
[46:13] I got cross-eyed eyes I walk with my
[46:16] knees knocking I'm not fit to be
[46:18] anything
[46:19] but the mother says this Jewish man he
[46:22] sacrifices Lambs not mules
[46:25] and brothers said oh I hope you can see
[46:27] it it isn't whether you're good enough
[46:29] to be a Christian or not it's whether he
[46:31] was good enough
[46:33] if God accepted Jesus and Jesus blood
[46:36] makes an atonement God doesn't see you
[46:38] he sees the little lamb praise God
[46:42] he said then that little mule could
[46:44] stick his tail up in the air and snort
[46:46] and run and jump over the field having a
[46:48] good time can you picture that meal
[46:51] having a good time I don't have to die
[46:53] something's died for me Hallelujah
[46:58] Glory
[47:00] he said he's going to live He's not
[47:03] going to die
[47:04] he says but one perfect one had to die
[47:07] for the imperfect one he said that was
[47:10] me William Branham no good not fit to
[47:12] live worthy to go to hell
[47:15] born in a sinful family raised a sinner
[47:18] no good at all not one sound part about
[47:20] me that's right but one day I accepted
[47:22] Jesus God when God looked down on Christ
[47:25] and Christ took my place then God don't
[47:28] see me he sees the perfect one
[47:30] then as long as I'm in him then I'm
[47:34] perfected not in myself not my
[47:37] perfection I don't have any you don't
[47:39] have any but it's his perfection
[47:42] oh you like that story amen I love that
[47:46] but that makes himself like a a
[47:48] cross-eyed knock-kneed uh little horse
[47:50] little cult
[47:53] but we're saved by the lamb the lamb
[47:55] without blemish
[47:57] and so then you can jump around the
[47:58] Barnyard with your tail flopping all
[48:00] around I'm saved I'm saved by the grace
[48:03] of God
[48:05] I'm saved by that
[48:06] Hallelujah
[48:08] that's our program looked at himself not
[48:10] like I'm some great person
[48:13] now this is what I read last night
[48:14] brother man said man can't heal you he
[48:16] can only point you to Christ
[48:18] he said again I only Point people to
[48:20] Jesus Christ
[48:22] I do not claim to be a Healer I cannot
[48:25] hear heal anyone we only point you to
[48:27] the person that's already healed you
[48:29] the church has no salvation it can only
[48:32] point you to Jesus Christ who is the
[48:34] only salvation these are all quotes I'm
[48:37] just going like fast like a machine gun
[48:39] or ar
[48:42] Bill Graham said he's praised for the
[48:43] people may they look away from me this
[48:45] Mortal clay of a servant may they look
[48:48] to him whose omniscient not the
[48:50] messenger but the message Granite Lord
[48:52] that's where we point we point to Jesus
[48:54] Christ the son of God grant that Jesus
[48:56] will be so real to everyone here today
[48:58] even to the little children where's the
[49:00] little children out there
[49:02] we want Jesus Christ to be so real to
[49:04] all of you even you Jed
[49:07] you're next to be baptized one of these
[49:09] days
[49:10] Hallelujah
[49:13] may he be so real even the little
[49:14] children that he'll become the absolute
[49:16] of the entire congregation we ask in
[49:19] Jesus name amen
[49:22] now I've shared that with Jefferson Bill
[49:24] voice of God numerous times and they
[49:26] just don't even respond if brother
[49:28] Graham said Jesus Christ is his absolute
[49:30] that's good enough for me praise God
[49:33] like this guy he's a real nice guy from
[49:35] Australia real nice guy he probably
[49:36] listened to me God bless the brother
[49:38] but you know he has he said that
[49:40] Evangelical told him if I understand
[49:42] this right he said the Evangelical said
[49:44] well Bible's my absolute so he said
[49:46] well the the Bible interpreted by
[49:48] Brother Branham is my absolute
[49:51] and I thought well I haven't responded
[49:53] yet but I thought to me if brother
[49:55] Branham if it was okay for brother Brown
[49:56] to say the Bible's my absolute it's okay
[49:58] for me to say that
[50:01] right to me I just don't like to bring
[50:03] anything in you know like a man
[50:06] because Jesus Christ is my absolute and
[50:08] now if you like that Evangelical could
[50:10] look at our lives and say well your
[50:12] absolute's producing something different
[50:13] than my absolute especially when you
[50:15] look at the women
[50:16] right look how holy our women dress oh
[50:19] let's say he's Baptist well the Baptist
[50:21] look at your wife she's all sexy dressed
[50:23] look at my wife oh the Bible is both of
[50:25] our absolutes well it's obvious to tell
[50:27] we have different absolutes
[50:29] because your wife is dressed like a
[50:30] prostitute mine dressed like a holy
[50:32] ghost-filled Saint a daughter of God
[50:34] right not to be mean or anything but
[50:36] that's the reality of it
[50:38] strip off clothes so men can lust after
[50:40] them they can feel prettier when it's
[50:41] not even real pretty it's sin
[50:45] so I appreciate that brother and maybe
[50:47] he's listening
[50:48] but to me I just like to brother said
[50:50] Jesus Christ in my absolute and I like
[50:51] to say that too
[50:53] yeah and yeah then I'll bring in yes God
[50:54] sent a prophet to show us the absolute
[50:57] right
[50:59] and brothers said if you have the Holy
[51:01] Spirit it can only point you to the word
[51:03] of God it'll never point to denomination
[51:05] never point to a Creed it'll never point
[51:07] it anywhere somewhere It'll point
[51:09] straight to the word
[51:11] then he says again if you've got the
[51:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost it can only
[51:15] point you to Christ what was Eliezer
[51:17] doing pointing to Isaac point to Abraham
[51:18] pointing there that's what we do we
[51:20] point to God we point to a son Jesus
[51:22] Christ
[51:24] brother Brandon said the Bible is your
[51:26] North Star in other words it directs you
[51:28] it's your compass
[51:29] you look to the you look to the North
[51:31] Star okay that way I'm going north now I
[51:32] can go the right direction
[51:34] and so when we're in trouble and we're
[51:36] lost
[51:37] in the cares of the world we're lost in
[51:39] Trials where do we got to look to we got
[51:41] to look to the North Star we got to look
[51:42] to Jesus brother Brown said it's the way
[51:44] out of all troubles it's the way to
[51:48] peace it's the way to success it's the
[51:50] way to eternal life itself is follow the
[51:53] North Star Jesus Christ and Jesus is the
[51:56] word hallelujah oh thank God Amen
[52:00] the way out of any trouble is the word
[52:04] but Ram's troubled why am I nothing
[52:05] going on for five years why am I here
[52:07] with gila monsters why not why am I out
[52:09] here with scorpions Lord show me the
[52:11] answer right there
[52:13] the Bible has the answers
[52:15] the Bible has your answers
[52:25] but the answer to the Holy Ghost will
[52:26] only point you to the word not some
[52:28] ecumenical move but to the word of God
[52:31] but brother said every other man's word
[52:34] will fail but God's word can't fail
[52:37] said I'm a man he said my words can fail
[52:41] but God's words can't fail because it's
[52:43] God
[52:44] now let's balance it out every time
[52:46] brother Adam said thus say the Lord
[52:47] those words can't fail
[52:49] but when he's just talking like his
[52:50] regular self those words could fail
[52:53] that's why we look for thus saith the
[52:55] Lord
[52:56] that's why I did that study back in
[52:57] 2016. I think it was over 1200 quotes I
[53:00] went through 1200 click click you gotta
[53:03] read it click click click my eyes were
[53:05] crossed by about that time I was just
[53:06] like that cult
[53:08] but hopefully I found them all right I
[53:10] love this quote brother said it's got to
[53:12] come to one final absolute and my
[53:14] absolute is the word the Bible
[53:16] ah why don't we say with the tape say
[53:19] everybody are we saying what the tape
[53:20] say hallelujah
[53:22] remember acts 17 11 the bereans heard
[53:25] the prophet Paul preached and they
[53:27] searched the Scriptures Daily to make
[53:29] sure he was telling the truth
[53:31] and the Bible called them Noble if you
[53:33] want to rule in the Millennium you got
[53:34] to search the Bible every day
[53:37] if you want to be Noble if you want to
[53:39] be royal family you got to search the
[53:41] Bible every day and make sure what
[53:42] brother Jesse's saying make sure my
[53:43] brother brother Brandon brother Brooks
[53:45] whoever any brother make sure what we're
[53:47] saying is the word of God
[53:49] and if you do that you you show you're
[53:52] of the royal family you're of the royal
[53:53] seed and someday you'll rule in the
[53:55] millennium
[53:56] that's why I told the Saints last night
[53:58] some of them looked at me like
[54:01] time to read your Bible
[54:03] it's time to make sure but I'm gonna say
[54:04] every day in the morning right away with
[54:05] the kids we read our Bible and pray
[54:06] every day that's what you need to do we
[54:09] all need to do that search the
[54:10] Scriptures Daily have a time every day
[54:13] you study the Bible
[54:14] that's what the Bible says is Noble
[54:18] brother Adam said quote God is the
[54:20] absolute
[54:21] and then brother Adam said quote but
[54:23] God's absolute is his word so he's the
[54:25] absolute and his words the absolute so
[54:27] we have two absolutes really we have two
[54:29] forms two forms two manifestations of
[54:31] the absolute we have the Holy Ghost and
[54:33] the Holy Ghost word that he wrote
[54:35] well there's only one absolute but we
[54:37] have two forms of it and the church said
[54:40] brother man said both God's the absolute
[54:42] is where is the absolute
[54:45] well the Ramsey that said the absolute
[54:47] is a person and there's only one
[54:48] absolute there's no other absolute and
[54:51] the absolute is always Jesus Christ
[54:53] there is no room for tapes being the
[54:55] absolute
[54:56] there's only because there's no other
[54:58] there's only one absolute and that's
[54:59] Jesus Christ thank God for the tapes
[55:01] like I told you thank God for the camels
[55:03] amen thank God for Elise or praise God
[55:05] thank God for every one of them but they
[55:07] are not Isaac Hallelujah
[55:09] there's only one Isaac and that's our
[55:11] husband praise God
[55:13] look at Jesus amen that's who that's who
[55:16] we're falling in love with right there
[55:18] praise God
[55:19] and yes you know the stories Elisa tells
[55:21] like that song all the stories alligator
[55:23] tells they thrilled our hearts amen
[55:24] they're getting us ready to see Jesus
[55:26] but when we see Jesus that's who we're
[55:28] going to go in the tent with that's who
[55:30] are going in the Rapture with is Jesus
[55:32] Christ Our Lord
[55:33] oh thank God Amen
[55:36] Hallelujah
[55:38] brother says if if your absolute is in
[55:41] some organization or something else
[55:44] besides the person of Jesus Christ
[55:46] you'll come to some portion of Shame
[55:49] in other words this Bible has to be your
[55:51] final say and no other books outside
[55:52] this Bible
[55:54] because this is what God has Vindicated
[55:55] down Through the Ages this is the
[55:57] absolute this is the final say
[55:59] this is the Unlimited in power amen
[56:02] that's what the word absolute means God
[56:04] bless brother Kyle good to see you buddy
[56:05] Hallelujah good to see you my friend
[56:07] Hallelujah
[56:09] so we got one absolute there can be no
[56:12] other absolute you can't say well my
[56:15] church is my absolute my Creed is my
[56:17] absolute no if Jesus Christ is your
[56:19] absolute you believe God's word
[56:22] glory amen that's right
[56:25] now let me try to find a place to close
[56:28] now real quickly the Bible says in
[56:30] second Peter 3 18 grow in Grace and
[56:33] knowledge of our Lord and savior they
[56:34] asked brother Ram how can a Christian
[56:35] get deeper in the love of God read the
[56:37] word and pray
[56:40] I want to become a better Christian what
[56:42] should I do brother just said I spend
[56:43] more money no should spend more time
[56:44] with God
[56:46] read your Bible and pray
[56:48] right
[56:49] spent and it can be spend time at the we
[56:51] found a good Park I might go study the
[56:53] Bible there and prayers but be out in
[56:55] nature but really all you need is a
[56:56] Bible
[56:57] and an honest heart to pray that's all
[56:59] you need is a Bible and honest heart to
[57:01] draw closer to God
[57:04] he also told us he said
[57:06] don't tangle with the world for anything
[57:08] stay out of this modern world
[57:10] stay out of their modern theologies
[57:13] just look to the Lamb of God read your
[57:15] Bible and pray all the time don't be
[57:17] weary be rejoicing happy now we all get
[57:20] weird I'm not I'm not condemning people
[57:22] I get weary too I'm pretty tired
[57:24] actually today but you can't tell by
[57:26] God's grace hopefully hopefully can't
[57:28] tell so I preached five times in the
[57:30] last seven days I've been traveling I've
[57:32] traveled about 500 Miles preaching
[57:34] that's good that's what I want to do but
[57:35] I'm just tired he said but don't worry
[57:37] be happy for the Redemption of the
[57:40] church is drawing not your time to meet
[57:42] Isaac is almost here hallelujah Rebecca
[57:45] it's almost time to meet Isaac
[57:47] Hallelujah
[57:48] it's almost time for the church to meet
[57:50] Jesus Christ
[57:51] oh it's a beautiful type and we shall
[57:54] see him who died for us
[57:56] when I see a man what are you gonna do
[57:58] amen when you see the one who died for
[57:59] you Lord let me just let me look at
[58:01] those hands let me let me let me kiss
[58:03] those feet for about five 500 years or
[58:05] something like that
[58:07] you bled and die for me you're the
[58:09] reason I'm here all I do is spend my
[58:11] life traveling on my journey we're just
[58:13] hearing about you and now I get to see
[58:15] you and the half has not been told
[58:17] Hallelujah
[58:20] there's so much more and easier's not
[58:23] Eternal you're Eternal praise God
[58:27] amen hallelujah
[58:29] ah thank God
[58:35] I have to skip ahead a little bit here
[58:38] now in Genesis 24 30 pardon me the Bible
[58:41] says
[58:43] it came to pass when he saw Laban saw
[58:45] the earring and the bracelets upon his
[58:47] sister's hands I'm sorry that was a
[58:49] Laban that was laban's son and when he
[58:51] heard the words of Rebecca's sister
[58:52] saying thus fake the man to me that he
[58:54] came unto the man and behold he stood by
[58:56] the camels at the well
[59:00] so I just want you to show after Allah
[59:01] azer gave
[59:03] the jewels to Rebecca she put them on
[59:08] what would you say if you you engage
[59:10] yourself to a woman and she said yes but
[59:12] then she didn't put on the engagement
[59:13] ring
[59:13] like Hey where's that ring
[59:16] uh
[59:18] where is it
[59:20] spent some money on that
[59:25] you know and and so brother Adam says
[59:27] this he says the church is now he said
[59:30] look she's got it she got it she got it
[59:31] on she's got the necklace the bracelets
[59:33] that's it was all Isaacs she's like look
[59:35] honey look I'm Yours
[59:38] I got your gifts on
[59:39] I've been true to you
[59:42] I've kept your promises I've kept your
[59:44] I've kept the vow to you I've stayed
[59:46] pure to you
[59:48] brother man said now the church the
[59:50] bride of Christ is engaged to Jesus for
[59:53] the wedding the wedding has never been
[59:55] performed yet it will be at the wedding
[59:57] supper of the Lamb
[59:59] the church is now engaged like a man
[1:00:01] engaged to his wife what does he do
[1:00:03] while they're engaged he's bestowing all
[1:00:05] kinds of things sending her presents
[1:00:07] making her feel good
[1:00:10] well that's what Christ is doing to the
[1:00:12] the church he's sending us the gifts of
[1:00:15] the holy spirit
[1:00:17] now we know what these what are these
[1:00:20] jewels and what are these uh jewelry
[1:00:22] what does this all represent it
[1:00:23] represents Supernatural moves of the
[1:00:26] Holy Ghost
[1:00:27] through the nine gifts of the Holy
[1:00:29] Spirit
[1:00:30] let's see if I can name them all Word of
[1:00:32] Wisdom word of knowledge
[1:00:34] uh Faith Miracles discernment tongues
[1:00:37] interpretation
[1:00:39] healings I think that's all nine right
[1:00:41] did I miss one
[1:00:43] prophecy yeah you got it Hallelujah see
[1:00:45] you guys help me out you're my second
[1:00:47] third brains
[1:00:49] there's all night so all those gifts of
[1:00:52] the holy spirit are Jesus love tokens
[1:00:54] you're my wife and church he wants us to
[1:00:57] wear them
[1:00:58] Amen in other words he wants us to
[1:01:00] believe for miracles Hallelujah
[1:01:03] he wants us to believe her Divine
[1:01:04] Healing he wants us to believe for Faith
[1:01:07] and discernment praise God and words of
[1:01:09] wisdom and tongues and interpretation
[1:01:11] and prophecy he wants us to put it on
[1:01:13] church I say let's put him on praise God
[1:01:16] let's cover this season Hallelujah of
[1:01:18] our lives and let's put on all these
[1:01:20] Jewels let's make sure we believe let's
[1:01:22] make sure we're ready to meet Isaac amen
[1:01:24] Hallelujah
[1:01:28] brother man said if I was engaged to a
[1:01:30] girl
[1:01:31] and I'd send her something and she
[1:01:33] wouldn't wear it that show she doesn't
[1:01:35] believe me she don't she doesn't want to
[1:01:36] be my bride
[1:01:39] I'm glad my wife still wears her wedding
[1:01:41] ring
[1:01:43] after 20 years
[1:01:44] I've loved her best I could my God
[1:01:48] she's loved me way more she's such a
[1:01:50] servant God
[1:01:52] if Christ sends his church the gifts
[1:01:54] that he promised and they refuse him and
[1:01:56] say they're not so they don't want to be
[1:01:58] the bride of Christ
[1:01:59] he says they're espoused as some other
[1:02:01] lover
[1:02:03] and not Christ the bridegroom so the
[1:02:05] real Church keeps the promise and keeps
[1:02:08] all and accepts the gifts that God sends
[1:02:11] to them hallelujah how many will accept
[1:02:13] all the gifts God sends to you
[1:02:16] now remember church do you have a gift
[1:02:17] though you got to pray for that gift
[1:02:19] you got to say God help me to yield to
[1:02:22] this gift
[1:02:23] like brother amen as a music music is
[1:02:25] healing right every time somebody one
[1:02:27] you want healing got to put on the right
[1:02:28] music
[1:02:29] so he's got to say Lord Jesus guide me
[1:02:31] with these music with his songs so I can
[1:02:33] be a blessing so I can bring joy to the
[1:02:35] people healing to the people repentance
[1:02:37] right sometimes a song can just bring
[1:02:38] you right to repentance absolutely
[1:02:42] and each one of our gifts we have to say
[1:02:44] Lord
[1:02:46] help me to take this gift and use it for
[1:02:48] your glory help me to put it on Amen
[1:02:50] well Ram said when remember this when
[1:02:53] I'm gone Jesus will still be here
[1:02:56] brother has been dead for 57 years but
[1:02:58] Jesus is still alive amen
[1:03:00] Hallelujah but Ram said Divine Healing
[1:03:03] doesn't lay within me every one of these
[1:03:05] men has got the same Authority that I or
[1:03:07] anyone else has got to pray for the sick
[1:03:09] and that's all we can do is pray for the
[1:03:12] sick
[1:03:13] Hallelujah
[1:03:16] well the ram said that good listen that
[1:03:19] good Holy Ghost Field brother sister
[1:03:20] that lives next door to you has the same
[1:03:23] authority to pray for you when you're
[1:03:25] sick
[1:03:27] it don't matter it don't matter who
[1:03:30] prays for you as long as they have faith
[1:03:32] it don't have to be me although I would
[1:03:33] be loved love to pray for you
[1:03:36] but if you can't get to me get to
[1:03:37] somebody who's got faith amen
[1:03:39] because you know that person will leave
[1:03:41] your presence but Jesus never leaves our
[1:03:43] presence
[1:03:44] the spirit's so great it just hovers
[1:03:46] around all the Believers
[1:03:49] said I'm not the only one to pray for
[1:03:51] the sick your pastor is just as much
[1:03:54] ordained to pray for the sick as I or
[1:03:57] any other man in the earth what a
[1:03:59] statement
[1:04:01] the lady even can pray for each other so
[1:04:04] healing doesn't lay in the man it lays
[1:04:06] in Calvary
[1:04:08] any true gift of God will testify the
[1:04:10] same thing praise God
[1:04:12] the life in other words the Resurrection
[1:04:13] Life that flowed out of Calvary three
[1:04:15] days later that's the power that's where
[1:04:18] the healing lays in the Resurrection the
[1:04:20] life of Jesus Christ
[1:04:22] amen amen almost preached hour and a
[1:04:25] half here I didn't know I was going to
[1:04:25] preach Islam
[1:04:27] no remember that's brother Brandon can
[1:04:29] women operate all the gifts he says yes
[1:04:32] as long as it comes in the place of the
[1:04:33] order he said women are gifted with
[1:04:35] prophecy tongues interpretations
[1:04:37] everything but being preachers they're
[1:04:39] not to be preachers
[1:04:41] he says but as far as gifts the woman
[1:04:44] has all those can occupy one or any of
[1:04:46] those nine gifts according to First
[1:04:48] Corinthians 12 and is under no bondage
[1:04:50] that her message should not come forth
[1:04:52] in this place
[1:04:53] so sisters you're not in bondage here
[1:04:55] you're free here
[1:04:57] and let me say the same thing the
[1:04:58] brothers are free here too praise God
[1:04:59] even if you're not a preacher you're
[1:05:01] free here praise God just gotta wait for
[1:05:03] your time
[1:05:05] just gotta wait for your place
[1:05:08] Hallelujah
[1:05:11] all right
[1:05:13] I think I might be coming down here by
[1:05:16] the grace of God
[1:05:18] so in closing here by God's grace
[1:05:23] we can see that God has sent brother
[1:05:25] Brandon who died in 1965 he sent him to
[1:05:28] give us a word to prepare us a word
[1:05:31] straight from the Bible not outside the
[1:05:33] Bible straight to the Bible
[1:05:36] any true servant of God will only point
[1:05:38] you to the word of God
[1:05:40] and I believe this has all the answers
[1:05:42] even if it's not the answers we want
[1:05:43] it's got all the answers
[1:05:45] we just got to say Lord change my heart
[1:05:46] so I can accept your answers
[1:05:49] and some and search sometimes the answer
[1:05:50] is you'll find out when you get to
[1:05:51] heaven
[1:05:53] sometimes that's the answer
[1:05:54] and that should be good enough for us
[1:05:57] because of all that father God has done
[1:05:58] for us
[1:06:00] that should be good enough he's taking
[1:06:02] care of us so much in our natural lives
[1:06:04] and our spiritual lives he's done so
[1:06:06] much through the cross through the Holy
[1:06:08] Ghost
[1:06:08] all the truth that he's given to us he's
[1:06:10] done so much he's worthy to be trusted
[1:06:15] your heavenly father is worthy to be
[1:06:18] trusted
[1:06:21] and church let's see I just you know
[1:06:23] want to let me say this here
[1:06:25] you know God has given us such grace
[1:06:26] through brother Bam's Ministry
[1:06:29] he's you know he's pointing us to the
[1:06:31] Bible where we can dress holy where we
[1:06:33] don't we don't cause people to lust
[1:06:35] after our bodies by wearing sexy clothes
[1:06:37] right so he's kept he taught us that
[1:06:39] lust spirits come off us when we believe
[1:06:41] God's word
[1:06:43] we're not seeking a uh we're not seeking
[1:06:45] fleshly evidences we're not we're not
[1:06:47] seeking tongues to know we're born again
[1:06:49] we know we're born again when people can
[1:06:51] see and hear our life has changed
[1:06:53] like it they could see it here on the
[1:06:55] day of Pentecost
[1:06:57] praise God through not giving a lie
[1:06:59] we're not believing Lies We have a lying
[1:07:00] Spirit on us why I've spoke in tongues
[1:07:01] one time or I shouted one time I know I
[1:07:03] got the Holy Ghost you got it because
[1:07:05] something happened and then everybody
[1:07:06] can see the fruits of it afterwards
[1:07:08] right we don't let women preachers come
[1:07:10] preach the pulpit because there's
[1:07:11] nothing in the Bible about women
[1:07:12] preachers
[1:07:14] right there's we don't let people
[1:07:15] divorce and remarry and divorce and
[1:07:17] remarry married two or three or four
[1:07:19] times that's adultery it stains the
[1:07:22] church
[1:07:23] right
[1:07:24] we keep our our hair lengths the right
[1:07:26] way the Bible said men should have short
[1:07:27] hair and women should have long uncut
[1:07:29] hair that's what the Bible says if not
[1:07:32] it's a shame it brings shame upon the
[1:07:33] man or shame upon the woman and shame
[1:07:35] upon God
[1:07:36] because the Bible says so not adding one
[1:07:39] thing to the word of God
[1:07:41] Hallelujah
[1:07:44] in church we keep out the idols that
[1:07:46] many people have in their lives
[1:07:48] even the idol of Eliezer
[1:07:51] no one gets our praise and worship no
[1:07:53] one gets our adoration no one gets our
[1:07:55] honor except Jesus Christ
[1:07:57] for worship yes we are the Bible said
[1:07:59] honor one another shake hands love you
[1:08:01] pray for you
[1:08:02] but all Divine honor goes to Jesus
[1:08:05] Christ Alone
[1:08:07] so this bible message from Brother
[1:08:09] Graham has pointed us back to the word
[1:08:11] of God and it's given us an awareness of
[1:08:14] the gifts in our lives
[1:08:16] the jewelry the bracelets spiritually
[1:08:18] speaking
[1:08:22] but spiritually we see the suit the
[1:08:24] blessings of God in our lives we see the
[1:08:26] faith that God's placed in our lives
[1:08:29] let me just share this last story you
[1:08:30] know this week I talked to uh
[1:08:32] a saint and and we just had something
[1:08:34] from the past to deal with that doesn't
[1:08:36] go to this church
[1:08:38] and they just said you know they said
[1:08:39] brother Jesse you know
[1:08:40] numerous times over these five or six
[1:08:42] years
[1:08:43] people have talked talked to me about
[1:08:46] you
[1:08:48] and they've said brother Jesse you know
[1:08:50] they just
[1:08:51] they said you're a good guy but you
[1:08:53] preach so hard over the pulpit
[1:08:58] they said you you preach so hard and and
[1:09:01] your standard is so high
[1:09:05] that it drives people away and it
[1:09:07] divides the body of Christ
[1:09:10] I've I felt the holy righteous in the
[1:09:12] nation of God Arise enough to me but I I
[1:09:15] held it back
[1:09:17] and they said they they they they just
[1:09:19] share numerous things and they said you
[1:09:21] know you need to be more loving and you
[1:09:22] need to
[1:09:24] you need to take your standards down
[1:09:26] because the main thing is love
[1:09:29] and I just said well brother we'll just
[1:09:30] agree to disagree
[1:09:33] yeah brother
[1:09:35] that's right let's say Amen can we
[1:09:37] that's right brother Hallelujah
[1:09:40] and you caught you caught it because
[1:09:42] what he's trying to say is you got to
[1:09:43] compromise on the word of God
[1:09:46] and that's love
[1:09:47] and that is not love that's from hell
[1:09:49] like our brother said
[1:09:51] to compromise on God's word and what he
[1:09:53] was talking about was parenting and
[1:09:54] preaching
[1:09:58] and I said I thought my heart I said
[1:10:00] Lord I'd rather take the way with God's
[1:10:02] despised View
[1:10:04] than to dwell in a church that if you
[1:10:07] look at their church we visit the church
[1:10:09] a number of years ago our family did and
[1:10:11] my girls left out of there saying we
[1:10:12] don't like this church because they wore
[1:10:14] such sexy clothes
[1:10:16] preaching a lot of what we preach they
[1:10:18] preach the same baptism same godhead
[1:10:22] right
[1:10:23] girls is that right girls
[1:10:26] right remember that in case you remember
[1:10:27] that you don't remember that okay lady
[1:10:29] did you remember that
[1:10:32] and so just this week I've been reminded
[1:10:34] and it was just God just laid it right
[1:10:35] in order
[1:10:36] while I was driving to some of these
[1:10:37] preaching events
[1:10:40] I was reminded we never let down the
[1:10:42] standard that God has given to us
[1:10:45] because the standard of the Bible we've
[1:10:47] been taught is guiding us to his
[1:10:49] standards
[1:10:50] Jesus did and Jesus standards are the
[1:10:52] word of God
[1:10:55] and church that family and their Church
[1:10:57] they watch full football games on TV
[1:11:00] full basket they watch all the NBA
[1:11:02] Finals what a complete waste of time
[1:11:05] that's like bowing down at an idol of a
[1:11:08] basketball
[1:11:09] I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna stay here
[1:11:10] and I'm gonna I'm Gonna Worship that's
[1:11:12] what they do worship for three hours
[1:11:13] until the game's over
[1:11:15] and that whole time how much could they
[1:11:17] even learn about God or praying or
[1:11:19] witnessing or listen to a sermon or just
[1:11:21] how about cleaning their house
[1:11:26] yes sir that's right amen
[1:11:29] it is yes sir that Roman Spirit back
[1:11:32] because Spirits never die
[1:11:34] here's another day
[1:11:36] that's right
[1:11:38] yes
[1:11:40] the final say let's say pricing off Joey
[1:11:44] praise the Lord amen but I was reminded
[1:11:47] this week we got to point to one thing
[1:11:50] the word of God
[1:11:52] and brother man taught us when you break
[1:11:54] the standards he said it's like letting
[1:11:56] down the it's like opening the gates and
[1:11:58] then all the wolves get in and destroy
[1:12:00] your sheep
[1:12:02] if I said oh it's okay for your sisters
[1:12:04] to wear more sexy clothes it's okay for
[1:12:06] you men to go out
[1:12:07] uh to the bars and it's okay to go out
[1:12:09] uh to the clubs with the sports it's
[1:12:12] like letting demons like wolves and then
[1:12:14] they'll destroy your spiritual life
[1:12:16] they will suffocate or they'll they'll
[1:12:18] they'll bite your spiritual life and
[1:12:20] they'll wait till your spiritual life is
[1:12:21] dead and you'll feel a million miles
[1:12:23] from God why because you let the goats
[1:12:25] I'm sorry you let the wolves in now
[1:12:27] goats would work too
[1:12:29] but wolves are way more dangerous
[1:12:33] so I was reminded this week let's stay
[1:12:36] with the word of God let's stay pointing
[1:12:38] out God's word let's not let down the
[1:12:40] standard
[1:12:41] and I kind of smiled I said I'm glad
[1:12:43] people say that about me
[1:12:45] I'd rather have them say brother Jesse's
[1:12:47] a legalist than a worldly preacher
[1:12:49] I'm going to be one of the other right
[1:12:51] I'm either going to be popular or
[1:12:52] rejected while Marty rejected Hallelujah
[1:12:56] so I might as well somebody that keeps
[1:12:57] the standard so high
[1:13:00] and church I don't know about you if I
[1:13:01] don't feel division in our church I feel
[1:13:03] unity in our church I'm thankful for the
[1:13:06] unity of the Holy Spirit let's stand to
[1:13:08] our feet musicians can come here praise
[1:13:09] God
[1:13:13] let's play that where one in the spirit
[1:13:15] we're one in the Lord
[1:13:17] and I pray that the spirit of unity will
[1:13:19] someday be restored it is in God's
[1:13:21] people praise God
