[32:43] Lord willing we'll see what the Lord
[32:44] allows so we're on part three of
[32:54] Revelation chapter 20 and it's part 106
[32:56] of the series so it just kind of keeps
[33:00] you thinking about it and let's go to
[33:02] Revelation 20 verse 1 by God's grace now
[33:25] read I read verses 1 and 2 and then
[33:30] we'll all read verse 3 threes a lot of
[33:32] reading so you got a little extra
[33:33] reading tonight by God's grace hopefully
[33:35] can handle that hopefully we can all
[33:37] handle that revelation 20 verse 1 I'll
[33:39] read 1 and 2 and I saw an angel come
[33:41] down from heaven having the key of the
[33:43] bottomless pit and a great chain in his
[33:45] hand and he laid hold on the dragon that
[33:48] old serpent which is the devil and Satan
[33:51] and bound him a thousand years let's all
[33:54] read verse three one two three and cast
[33:58] him into the bottomless pit and shut him
[34:01] up and set a seal upon him that he
[34:05] should deceive the nation's No More till
[34:08] the thousand years should be fulfilled
[34:11] and after that he must be loosed a
[34:14] little season let's have one more word
[34:17] of Prayer if you ever need on your heart
[34:18] just make it on into the Lord here
[34:19] surely he's mindful and faithful our God

[34:32] eyes are turned upon you Lord goddess
[34:34] even as we close our eyes Lord our
[34:36] spiritual eyes are focused our desire
[34:38] our will is to do your will Lord to be
[34:42] in your presence Lord which is your face
[34:44] may your face shine upon us Lord here
[34:47] tonight Lord and as we look upon your
[34:49] face as we set our faces Lord to seek
[34:52] your face so father minister to us now
[34:54] by your Holy Spirit bless each and every
[34:56] heart dear God just guide me Lord let me
[34:59] be a yielded vessel Lord God and there
[35:01] may be a glove that your hand can fill
[35:02] and use for your kingdom let me be just
[35:05] a microphone that your voice can speak
[35:06] through Lord God from nothing and I know
[35:08] that Lord that we know each and every
[35:11] here the same Lord let us all be in the
[35:12] Holy Spirit
[35:14] bless our gathering Lord and we'll know
[35:16] that we'll all say it was good to be in
[35:18] the house or Lord as we leave this place
[35:19] in Jesus Christ's name
[35:21] the church said Amen god bless should be
[35:24] in-situ praise God so we last looked at
[35:40] this series on August 14th right before
[35:44] I went to Iowa so I was looking on
[35:45] YouTube today and trying to catch up
[35:47] where I pick up where I left off so it's
[35:50] been about four months by God's grace
[35:52] but I knew I'd eventually get back to it
[35:54] so I'd like to get back to it so you got
[35:56] a good foundation in the book of
[35:58] Revelation we'll finish up Lord willing
[36:00] here in the next few weeks by God's
[36:02] grace so I want to just briefly review
[36:06] the themes of this chapter we have three
[36:10] themes the thousand-year reign with
[36:12] Christ upon the earth then you have the
[36:15] Battle of Gog and Magog and then you
[36:18] have the great white throne judgment
[36:20] those three and we've looked at those
[36:21] themes here in part one looked at those
[36:26] thoroughly by God's grace and then we in
[36:30] part two we focus more on the Millennium
[36:32] that was back on August 14th praise God
[36:35] and we looked at that so today I like to
[36:39] finish up the symbols and key
[36:40] revelations of this chapter and then I
[36:44] like to preach a little bit more on the
[36:46] Millennium by God's grace so we'll look
[36:51] to the Lord tonight for that for help
[36:53] because we always always need his help
[36:55] to preach because there's only one
[36:56] preacher and that's Christ he meant so
[36:58] thank the Lord praise God so the the
[37:02] first the main or one of those main
[37:04] symbols in this chapter as a symbol
[37:06] would be found in verse 2 and it says
[37:10] any laid hold on the dragon that old
[37:13] serpent which is the devil and Satan and
[37:19] bound him a thousand years
[37:22] so the first symbol is of Satan and he's
[37:27] called an old serpent praise God
[37:30] now it's interesting that Jesus says be
[37:32] wise as serpent serpents and harmless as
[37:35] doves so there's something that's
[37:38] Admiral about a regular serpent as much
[37:41] as you probably shiver in your your
[37:44] church chair right now for those of you
[37:46] who don't like snakes but Malachi
[37:48] doesn't he sure likes him at least the
[37:50] ones in America but there's something
[37:53] Admiral about it because anything God
[37:55] created there's something good about it
[37:57] because he when he created everything it
[37:59] was good he said now of course the fall
[38:02] makes the the snake and the spider and
[38:04] you know different animals like that
[38:06] bugs and things like that cockroaches it
[38:09] makes them unpleasant maybe to humans
[38:12] but there's something Admiral about it
[38:14] and Jesus picks it up it's the wisdom of
[38:16] a serpent it's the the way that they
[38:19] move and and they they hunt and they're
[38:21] they're quiet the way they are it's
[38:24] their their manner of their hunting and
[38:26] Jesus says there are wise in the way
[38:29] they hunt and so there's something
[38:31] Admiral about it but here of course it's
[38:34] the negative aspect of the serpent the
[38:36] part what we we don't like and it's the
[38:39] symbol of Satan and notice it gives
[38:44] numerous symbols so if you go back to
[38:46] Revelation 12:9 in your Bible it lists
[38:49] the same titles for Satan so the
[38:52] symbolism is with a serpent and then the
[38:55] titles are repeated here as revelation
[38:58] 12 verse 9 it says and the Great Dragon
[39:01] was cast out that old serpent called the
[39:05] devil and Satan which deceiveth the
[39:08] whole world he was cast out into the
[39:11] earth and his angels were cast out with
[39:13] him so we get the same picture so
[39:15] revelation 12:9 and revelation 20 verse
[39:19] 2 give us multiple titles for Satan he's
[39:23] called dragon old serpent devil Satan
[39:26] right so he's got four and then he's got
[39:29] a real name Lucifer so just like G just
[39:32] like God has multiple titles Father Son
[39:34] Holy Ghost
[39:35] he's got one
[39:36] name praise God and that's the Lord
[39:39] Jesus Christ is the name above all names
[39:41] so don't forget that that's a great
[39:43] lesson to learn
[39:44] not to forget that Satan has many titles
[39:46] too but he's one person he's one fallen
[39:49] angel he's like into a dragon which the
[39:52] dragon in the Bible is liken we'd like
[39:55] it to a dinosaur right what we call a
[39:58] dinosaur a terrible lizard right and so
[40:01] you we see the bones of the biggest
[40:03] dinosaurs it makes us kind of imagine
[40:07] what they were but the Bible tells us
[40:09] you know even Jobe sees of the Leviathan
[40:12] and the behemoth ones in the water ones
[40:15] on the land and they're so great you
[40:18] know one of them has a tail like a cedar
[40:19] tree it's so thick and massive and then
[40:23] the other one that's the one in the land
[40:24] the one the water has scales that you
[40:27] can't even you can't even budget scales
[40:29] with the spear it's so great and it
[40:31] shoots out fire from its mouth a
[40:34] fire-breathing water dragon and that's
[40:37] what was alive in those days my because
[40:40] Jove is said to be a during the time of
[40:43] Moses so you get him about the same time
[40:47] there so even after the flood there was
[40:49] many dragons right there's no dinosaurs
[40:52] alive we know that from the scripture
[40:54] but the the only thing God can give us
[40:58] here the best thing the way to describe
[41:00] Satan is as a dragon a great dinosaur
[41:04] and as a serpent he's not like a dove
[41:08] right you're not like a lamb Satan's not
[41:11] like a lamb
[41:12] he's like a serpent and so these are the
[41:15] symbols here that God gives us of Satan
[41:20] so he has many titles but we know he's
[41:24] got one name and he's such a slick
[41:27] dragon or such a powerful dragon and
[41:30] that he deceives the whole world he
[41:33] conquers the whole world but he's such a
[41:34] serpent and sneaky that he deceives the
[41:37] nation's there to see this nation the
[41:40] majority's nation is deceived and the
[41:44] Bible tells us how he deceives them he
[41:46] turns the Word of God into
[41:48] unrighteousness
[41:50] so he makes them think they're serving
[41:52] God but allows them to sin right but
[41:56] Berlin says God gave us the Bible which
[41:59] is a thinking man's filter
[42:00] I just heard brother have to say this
[42:01] week he said you can't pull sin through
[42:04] God's filter praise God hey you can't
[42:07] pull a sinful life in other words you
[42:09] can't preach us it's okay to live a
[42:11] sinful life
[42:12] through the filter of this word because
[42:14] if you filter behaviors through this
[42:17] word you're gonna get a clean life
[42:18] praise God
[42:19] amen because it's a thinking man's
[42:22] filter thank God that we've got a filter
[42:24] in this hour amen but Satan like a
[42:27] serpent II very slowly deceives them
[42:31] praise odd now you've seen constrictors
[42:36] right constricting serpents they slowly
[42:39] get to a spot where they can quickly
[42:41] wrap around something right that right
[42:43] now guys the process of getting around
[42:47] the prey is really slow right it's got a
[42:49] slither and go real slow right a snake
[42:53] doesn't go real fast right and to be a
[42:55] constrictor now it's got to get into a
[42:58] position where it's just slither so
[43:00] quietly slowly and then all of a sudden
[43:03] it'll spring on the prey and then with
[43:07] its powerful muscles it'll quickly crush
[43:11] it right and that's what Satan does
[43:13] right he slips up slowly upon people and
[43:16] they don't even know how close he is
[43:18] right and then after once he's got his
[43:21] trap set
[43:22] then he'll jump upon his prey and
[43:24] quickly choke them out right
[43:29] like I've never said the maniac of
[43:31] gaturro he said all that started when he
[43:34] was he was foaming at the mouth he was
[43:36] cutting himself he was sleeping by tubes
[43:38] can you imagine that if you pass the
[43:40] graveyard on the way home he would sleep
[43:42] next to the dead he would cry out and
[43:44] how but he didn't it didn't start like
[43:47] that it started with one lie brother Ram
[43:49] said Satan just real it said it's okay
[43:53] just go ahead and lie this one time then
[43:55] he started lying again and he got drunk
[43:57] and then he got he just went further it
[43:59] was so sly and then pretty soon you know
[44:02] with the drunkenness Satan jump
[44:04] Don him and demon after demon slipped in
[44:06] and all the demons you know where's the
[44:09] twelve thousand demons slipped in there
[44:11] but it was something small just a little
[44:13] line you know it'll be okay God will
[44:16] forgive me November because he wanted to
[44:17] be delivered but if the Bible says that
[44:20] that Jesus had to cross the lake to get
[44:23] over to him because he cried out he
[44:25] wanted to be free amen
[44:27] remember God can deliver someone Jesus
[44:31] couldn't deliver somebody if they had
[44:32] unbelief if they worship that beam it's
[44:35] that man even though he's back sin that
[44:37] condition he wanted to be set free but
[44:39] the only one that could do it he had to
[44:41] call out to him and anyone that calls
[44:43] out to God God will save amen
[44:46] God is mighty to save him and the Bible
[44:48] said all who call upon the name of the
[44:50] Lord shall be saved amen in other words
[44:53] if somebody wants to be free from the
[44:54] Devils they'll be free but God's not
[44:57] gonna force him to be free they gotta
[44:59] want to be free but that's how Satan
[45:03] worked with the maniac of Gadara one
[45:05] small lie at a time real small real slow
[45:09] and he slowly moves them into sin until
[45:12] he gets them and then he comes in then
[45:16] they they open the door for the devil
[45:17] not really that's what's happened in our
[45:19] church because I was watching our
[45:21] services the last couple of months and
[45:22] we have people here that were shouting
[45:24] and screaming and praising the Lord and
[45:26] somehow some devil slipped in there and
[45:30] change their mind toward the Word of God
[45:31] and now it's taking them away because I
[45:35] was watching I was mine look at those
[45:37] people worship and now they're not here
[45:38] anymore
[45:39] they don't believe what we believe in
[45:40] they're against us and everything like
[45:41] Derek what what happened it was
[45:44] something very slow just slowly it
[45:47] wasn't obvious right but it will happen
[45:51] very slow and when they let down the
[45:53] bars a little bit at a time until they
[45:57] let something big come in like in this
[45:58] case a false doctrine or more it'll
[46:03] start with some small one little
[46:05] compromise see that's what Satan is like
[46:08] he's like that serpent that he questions
[46:12] God's Word because the serpent says old
[46:15] serpent in Revelations that means you
[46:17] have to go all the way
[46:17] back to the beginning the old part of
[46:19] the book right the beginning of the book
[46:21] and then you go back and see Satan the
[46:23] beginning doing the same thing to Eve he
[46:26] develops a relationship with her perhaps
[46:30] that they had many conversations until
[46:32] the one in Genesis chapter 3 where Satan
[46:36] injects a little doubt upon God's Word
[46:39] don't let anybody make you got this word
[46:42] for not one thing don't ever doubt God's
[46:45] Word God's Word is proven to be true
[46:48] hallelujah amen see the serpent will at
[46:52] some point try to get you to doubt it
[46:54] and as soon as he's got you doubting it
[46:56] that's when he'll try to pounce on you
[46:59] praise the Lord and she just nodded a
[47:04] little bit and he kept working on her
[47:06] kept working on her Oh God God God
[47:09] didn't wants to be like gods and yet
[47:11] they already were like gods right yeah
[47:14] I'm just having to speak and it would
[47:16] happen he already was a miniature God on
[47:18] earth but he got him to think that they
[47:21] didn't have enough right that's what
[47:23] Satan wants to do today get us the thing
[47:25] that serving God isn't enough in this
[47:27] holiness he wants us to try to add
[47:29] something to it some something sinful
[47:31] something pleasurable but we are not to
[47:33] live our lives for pleasure now we're to
[47:36] live our lives for eternal pleasure and
[47:38] that is always the greater reward praise
[47:41] God and the Christian the Christianity
[47:44] is the way of the Cross jesus said you
[47:47] can't mean that by my disciple except
[47:49] you take up your cross amen your burden
[47:52] you and I must take up our daily burden
[47:54] of following the Word of God and that
[47:56] makes us true disciples it's not going
[47:58] to be popular but it's going to be right
[48:00] amen
[48:01] thank the Lord so he's like that old
[48:05] serpent in the beginning where Jesus
[48:07] said he's the father of lies he said the
[48:10] reason the Pharisees can't accept the
[48:12] truth is because they're of their father
[48:14] the devil because he's the father of
[48:17] lies Church each each thing we believe
[48:19] each thing we preach we should look to
[48:21] the Word of God and say is this true or
[48:23] not everything we believe we should look
[48:25] to the word God say is this true or not
[48:27] is this causing righteousness in my life
[48:29] is this
[48:30] causing a closer walk with God or is
[48:32] that making me relaxed on God and our
[48:36] beliefs the things we believe how we act
[48:39] should all draw us closer to Christ
[48:43] Satan will try to get you to doubt the
[48:45] Word of God but we must not doubt it
[48:47] we've got to believe it
[48:49] praise God now the same temptation in
[48:57] the Garden of Eden is what he tries to
[48:59] do today his mother said Satan has not
[49:02] changed his tactics right is the same
[49:05] tactics romance also says that God is
[49:08] evil age he's got greater weapons and he
[49:10] dad's now right then he had then because
[49:13] he's got technology he's got a Hollywood
[49:17] he's got all these things greater powers
[49:19] right or greater ways of deception but
[49:22] it's the same idea to doubt God's Word
[49:25] he's trying to get us to question God's
[49:27] Word now in Revelation 20 now let me go
[49:33] back here revelation 20 in Revelation 20
[49:38] it's a beautiful picture of Satan
[49:40] finally getting what he deserves
[49:43] right it's a thousand years the Bible
[49:47] said he's bound up for a thousand years
[49:50] and he's cast into a bottomless pit and
[49:53] he shut up and set a seal upon him that
[49:57] he should deceive the nation's No More
[49:59] now look at this after six thousand
[50:02] years of him deceiving right and not
[50:05] only that but he's got years where he
[50:07] deceived in heaven right the Angels God
[50:10] gives him a temporary prisons sentence
[50:13] you're gonna have a thousand years in a
[50:16] bottomless pit so Satan well you you
[50:18] know the awful feeling of what it feels
[50:19] like to fall right you ever been on a
[50:21] roller coaster that drops you it's not a
[50:24] very pleasant feeling might be fun for
[50:26] the three seconds you're falling but it
[50:28] measured for him for a thousand years so
[50:30] Satan is in this bottomless pit just
[50:32] following and it sees he's getting a
[50:36] foretaste of what the lake of fire will
[50:39] be like
[50:40] and God sets a ceiling I like that
[50:44] praise God Satan tried to seal Jesus
[50:47] into the tomb with a Roman seal but God
[50:50] broke that seal praise God amen and so
[50:55] foolish of saying the thing that he
[50:57] could have a seal that would be stronger
[50:59] than God's but that's how foolish he is
[51:01] and he's a worthy opponent but he
[51:04] thought he could seal Jesus in because
[51:05] he didn't know the scripture praise God
[51:07] he didn't ever early knew the scripture
[51:09] he'd never revelation praise God he'd
[51:11] have the revelation that Jesus gonna
[51:12] raise from the dead so he thought I can
[51:15] seal that Messiah in there I can seal
[51:17] that Holy Child in there but the power
[51:19] of God the power of life broke that
[51:22] Roman seal and it broke it my angels
[51:25] moving the stone and after they moved it
[51:29] life stepped out of their praise God and
[51:31] life broke the seal praise God and the
[51:34] soldiers fall down because the power of
[51:36] life amen
[51:38] but now God says it for the Millennium
[51:41] he says I'm gonna like you in this
[51:44] bottomless pit for a thousand years that
[51:47] you know more deceive anyone else so now
[51:51] he's going to get a thousand years of
[51:53] torment here falling and he's gonna be
[51:56] recompense for all the pain and death
[51:58] his lies has have cost
[52:01] well the RAM said remember every time
[52:04] every time there's a funeral it's
[52:06] because of Satan right every time
[52:08] there's a fire-engine go out right every
[52:12] time you see a gray hair in your head
[52:14] it's because of Satan and all the pain
[52:18] and suffering every school shooting and
[52:19] every mass shooting every stabbing at
[52:22] whatever all the evil news is all
[52:23] because of Satan and so here in
[52:27] Revelation 20 we see him he gets laid
[52:29] ahold of and the chained by the angel
[52:32] and he gets thrown down the bottomless
[52:33] pit and he gets locked
[52:38] up by so think about that we're on the
[52:42] earth during that time the millennium
[52:44] and we have to worry about that deceiver
[52:46] ever deceiving us amen praise God amen
[52:49] imagine that a thousand years waking up
[52:52] going to bed
[52:53] waking up never have to worry about
[52:55] being deceived amen all right praise God
[52:58] because now you've got a glorified body
[53:00] praise God now you have more than just
[53:03] your soul now your whole mind now your
[53:06] whole body is a brand-new body it's
[53:08] perfection plus perfection praise God
[53:11] now nothing don't worry about being
[53:13] deceived anymore because the deceiver
[53:16] himself is falling for a thousand years
[53:19] man what a what a consolation that will
[53:26] be praise God till a thousand years upon
[53:29] this earth a thousand years of sunrises
[53:30] and try to imagine that have sunsets and
[53:33] never have to go to bed thinking that I
[53:35] messed up there did I make the wrong
[53:37] decision mom we're gonna sleep like
[53:38] kings and queens amen I didn't tell ya
[53:41] we're gonna sleep well because there'll
[53:43] be no deception we'll know we did God's
[53:46] will for that day praise God amen well
[53:49] no because God will only put us in a
[53:52] place a position where he can trust us
[53:54] according to how we lived in this earth
[53:56] amen
[53:57] and so what should our attitude be our
[54:00] attitude should be Lord I want to go to
[54:02] bed tonight not being deceived and
[54:04] you've got the ability to do that
[54:07] because the Bible said I can do all
[54:08] things through Christ who strengthens me
[54:10] amen praise God I've got the ability to
[54:14] go to bed tonight with peace in my heart
[54:16] amen five bad dreams I got the ability
[54:19] to pack or to cast on those bad dreams
[54:21] and rebuke them in Jesus name Amen
[54:24] because I didn't do that in the first
[54:27] place and just so you know I had awful
[54:28] dreams last night I forgot to tell my
[54:29] wife but I said some awful dreams I had
[54:31] to get up and rebuked them in the prayer
[54:32] class this morning you have to do that
[54:35] because Satan and I just remind me Satan
[54:37] has free access to the human spirit I
[54:39] was thinking about any of these evil
[54:40] things and this attack didn't feel like
[54:43] I got a good rest but see I've got I've
[54:46] got a source of strength I in me I've
[54:49] got the Spirit of Truth not
[54:51] spirit of deception I've got the spirit
[54:53] of truth praise God
[54:54] and truth will always set the believer
[54:57] free praise God amen
[55:01] so Satan finally gets his just prison
[55:05] sentence for that thousand-year
[55:07] millennium praise God
[55:09] so they're in the honeymoon there's
[55:10] nothing to worry about praise God I bet
[55:13] on one honeymoon and we didn't have much
[55:14] to worry about did we honey
[55:16] much to worry about not so much but see
[55:23] even will be even greater by God's grace
[55:25] Oh be even greater there in the
[55:27] Millennium because there'll be nothing
[55:29] to worry about because Christ is its
[55:31] Christ Day praise God it's our honeymoon
[55:33] with our Christ amen the bride and the
[55:37] groom praise God honeymoon time praise
[55:40] the Lord
[55:41] nothing to worry about no deception you
[55:43] know you're pleasing and then we can say
[55:45] like Jesus I always do that which
[55:47] pleases the father
[55:49] amen that would be the time for that
[55:51] praise God
[55:53] now that's the main symbol the symbol of
[55:57] Satan as a serpent now years ago I don't
[56:00] even remember the sermon I preached but
[56:02] I kind of preach on the trail of the
[56:04] serpent I don't know if you remember
[56:05] that row Graham mentioned that he was
[56:08] going to preach on it and he never got
[56:13] to it not what's interesting is that
[56:15] brother Donnie Reagan has a copy of
[56:17] brother Rams notes on the trail of the
[56:19] serpent and I'd like to I need to email
[56:22] him to see if I could get a copy of
[56:23] those because I guess they took a
[56:25] picture of they found his notebook I
[56:26] like I would like to get a copy of the
[56:28] house I just thought of that not right
[56:29] now but you know you see Satan and he
[56:34] slithers through human history and he
[56:38] tries to conquer the overcomer but he
[56:42] could never do it right he's cunning and
[56:47] deceptive he maxed himself behind
[56:50] religion right he's in religion and just
[56:54] remember some of the the order first he
[56:57] deceived in heaven then he was the beast
[56:59] in the garden and then he deceived
[57:01] through Kay
[57:02] and then he was deceiving the whole
[57:05] world the days are no other than 8
[57:07] people my what a serpent what a deceiver
[57:10] the whole human population except for 8
[57:13] and church if you'd have been alive he
[57:15] would have been one of those overcomers
[57:17] praise God but he slithered and deceive
[57:20] and he squeezed the whole population but
[57:22] he couldn't get his dirty tail around
[57:24] those 8 believers they had oh yeah why
[57:28] because they had a prophet who preached
[57:30] righteousness amen he preached holiness
[57:33] and he found grace in the sight of the
[57:35] Lord then he slithered up in Esau Jacob
[57:39] and Esau he saw was a fornicator married
[57:44] outside his faith despite his parents
[57:46] but obviously could not find a place of
[57:49] repentance so he slithered in there he
[57:52] slithered in the days of Moses behind a
[57:54] Balaam and Korah trying to go against
[57:58] Moses and take a place take their
[58:01] priesthood from them and to try to get
[58:04] the people try to curse God's people see
[58:08] how deceptive is Cain was worshiping
[58:09] Balaam was worshiping Cora was
[58:12] worshiping they were all right there
[58:13] amongst him not first let me say like
[58:15] this the devil's right amongst the
[58:17] message churches that serpents ride
[58:20] around us right he's right around us but
[58:25] see where the picture is worthless
[58:27] but we're really somewhat were really
[58:28] tiny and we really don't have any
[58:30] defense but we've got a mighty Shepherd
[58:32] protecting - protecting us and his name
[58:34] is Jesus amen
[58:36] praise God and if a a faithful Shepherd
[58:39] sees our serpent packing is gonna go
[58:41] after a sheep you know what he's gonna
[58:42] do he's gonna take that crook out and
[58:44] smack that fella there right or he's
[58:47] gonna get bigger the big old stone and
[58:49] don't drop it on him right
[58:51] we got a faithful Shepherd he'll protect
[58:54] us but remember Satan is right amongst
[58:56] us just gotta watch his trail he's
[58:58] always right amongst the believers in
[59:01] the days of Micaiah he was right amongst
[59:05] those false prophets of Ahab right in
[59:08] the temple in the days of Jena Jeremiah
[59:11] he was in Zedekiah
[59:13] saying oh it's not going to be 70 years
[59:15] it's going to be
[59:15] two years lying in the days of John the
[59:21] Baptist he was right there in those
[59:23] Pharisees those generations of vipers
[59:26] right the trail of the serpent so the
[59:31] serpent is always in those closest to
[59:34] the message right so we have to remember
[59:38] let's not forget that old serpent has
[59:40] got those same old tricks and he's going
[59:42] to hang right around us and we got to
[59:44] make sure we stay on our toes we stay
[59:46] true to the Word of God so that we can
[59:48] overcome and be a part of this
[59:50] millennium that our lives are worthy of
[59:54] the gospel in Jesus day he started right
[59:58] into Judas his heart right choked his
[1:00:01] life out soul and Judas sold out Jesus
[1:00:08] just like Cain killed Abel my same thing
[1:00:13] he said that brother have said that in
[1:00:14] 1960 in the days of Paul Satan entered
[1:00:18] he limas LMS Africa not sure to say that
[1:00:22] he entered those kanker preachers right
[1:00:25] that save their own bellies whose God
[1:00:28] was their belly
[1:00:29] so Paul said the same thing my I'm
[1:00:32] trying to deliver the message I'm trying
[1:00:33] to be the church age messenger but these
[1:00:35] Devils are these snakes are all around
[1:00:37] me they're all around here I've got to
[1:00:41] stand on the Word of God and as he went
[1:00:43] along he didn't get more popular he got
[1:00:45] more rejected because of the snakes
[1:00:49] because of the serpents slithering and
[1:00:52] choking out all those that started
[1:00:54] following him don't forget that church
[1:00:57] be just the same way Paul was saying
[1:00:59] we're gonna be Dimas follow Paul for a
[1:01:02] while but then he left him for the
[1:01:04] pleasures of the world that's how it's
[1:01:08] going to be we're gonna have fake word
[1:01:10] of you're either gonna be a faithful
[1:01:11] believer or Satan's gonna choke out your
[1:01:14] life and you're gonna leave the real
[1:01:16] Word of God right cuz you show you're
[1:01:19] not an unbeliever you're some type of
[1:01:22] believer praise God we want to be
[1:01:25] faithful that Satan doesn't choke us out
[1:01:27] but we can recognize him
[1:01:29] Shepard there he is squash him kill him
[1:01:36] stop him protect me Lord I don't what
[1:01:40] when he said I don't want his poison
[1:01:42] amen
[1:01:42] I don't want to be put to sleep by his
[1:01:44] poison I want to live for the glory of
[1:01:46] God I want to know there's only be a
[1:01:48] living sacrifice for God's glory the
[1:01:54] Bible said that Saint John battled a man
[1:01:59] who wanted the preeminence there was a
[1:02:01] man who always wanted the preeminence
[1:02:02] and Saint John had to battle that so
[1:02:05] Satan was trying to get preeminence over
[1:02:06] the Word of God let's read that boy
[1:02:08] spent a long time server that third John
[1:02:10] 1 verse 9 3rd John a long time since I
[1:02:15] read now let me read that that was just
[1:02:17] in my notes yeah its diode trifa's right
[1:02:21] because I said thou out trophies that
[1:02:23] diode trophies for 3rd John 1:9 I wrote
[1:02:27] another church but Diotrephes who loved
[1:02:30] to have the preeminence among them
[1:02:31] receiveth us not wherefore if I come
[1:02:35] I'll remember his deeds which he doeth
[1:02:37] prating against us with malicious words
[1:02:40] and not content therewith neither doth
[1:02:43] he himself received the Brethren and
[1:02:45] forbidding them that would and casteth
[1:02:47] them out of the church beloved follow
[1:02:50] not that which is evil but that which is
[1:02:52] good he that doeth good is of God but he
[1:02:54] that doeth evil hath not seen God how
[1:03:00] did Paul how did John know this was a
[1:03:02] serpent man because he wanted the
[1:03:05] preeminence amongst Paul I'm sorry much
[1:03:07] John rather so John knew Jesus Christ
[1:03:09] but died off no trophies he says you
[1:03:12] need to listen to me
[1:03:13] he was exalting himself above those that
[1:03:16] even knew Jesus the original apostles
[1:03:19] and look at what he did he he spurted
[1:03:24] out prating were malicious words against
[1:03:27] the real servants of God you better
[1:03:29] watch people that say evil things about
[1:03:31] William Branham watch him when they
[1:03:34] bored out and spread out evil things
[1:03:36] watch their lives because they're always
[1:03:39] going to lead to destruction
[1:03:41] that's right how did John know John said
[1:03:45] they took preeminence over the word and
[1:03:47] then they spoke malicious things against
[1:03:50] God's true servants and then they kicked
[1:03:55] him out of the church he said they
[1:03:56] wouldn't even receive the Brethren they
[1:03:59] wouldn't receive the preachers that were
[1:04:01] wrong John they separate themselves the
[1:04:04] Bible said they'll separate themselves
[1:04:06] not having the Holy Spirit now some of
[1:04:09] them you got a kick out right
[1:04:11] some people they won't repent you got to
[1:04:13] kick them out
[1:04:14] like I've had to do a couple of times
[1:04:16] but there's other people that they will
[1:04:18] separate themselves because they want to
[1:04:22] have the preeminence they think they
[1:04:23] know more about it but here John lays it
[1:04:29] out verse 11 he said follow not evil but
[1:04:32] follow good amen see what they're
[1:04:35] preaching see what their fruits are
[1:04:36] bringing forth the real fruits of the
[1:04:38] Holy Spirit will bring forth good works
[1:04:40] and not evil works praise God a lot of
[1:04:45] times you won't recognize it right away
[1:04:47] right a lot of it especially today
[1:04:50] people being deceived they don't see the
[1:04:52] sin we you know we might not see their
[1:04:54] sinful works right away but give it some
[1:04:56] time and you'll see it it might just be
[1:04:59] church their sinful works might just be
[1:05:02] the words they say it may never go into
[1:05:06] adultery may never go into stealing and
[1:05:09] may never go into murder
[1:05:10] the evil works they may accomplish maybe
[1:05:14] that trading and malicious words against
[1:05:17] God's people that may be the end of it
[1:05:22] but that's all they
[1:05:24] to be lost right because the Pharisees
[1:05:26] we know they have a lives so holy if
[1:05:28] they commit any evil they'd be stone and
[1:05:30] killed so what was their evil their
[1:05:32] words now someone we're after money we
[1:05:35] know that - they love the garments and
[1:05:38] they love the sitting at the special
[1:05:39] tables and everything like that but they
[1:05:41] paid ties on every little thing every
[1:05:43] little ounce they paid ties on they were
[1:05:45] so religious so the only way to
[1:05:48] recognize them was their failure to obey
[1:05:51] the word and their evil words that they
[1:05:55] said against Jesus look at Satan's
[1:06:00] slither there in the days of John it was
[1:06:03] so it was so close the only way to know
[1:06:06] is that he was against he was speaking
[1:06:08] evil things against John and the other
[1:06:09] preachers of the message glory hey man
[1:06:14] god help us remember Jesus that's gonna
[1:06:17] be more deceptive in this day more Jews
[1:06:24] did the same thing he said call them
[1:06:25] false teachers false teachers where is
[1:06:33] it old sir
[1:06:34] end up he ends up in the Roman Catholic
[1:06:36] Church the beast Rome and not just in
[1:06:40] Rome but in the United States the beasts
[1:06:42] out of the earth this is where that old
[1:06:44] serpent ends up in Revelation 12 that
[1:06:50] old serpent is trying to destroy the
[1:06:52] woman the Jewish Church and the 144,000
[1:06:57] praise God but God Jesus comes back he
[1:07:00] seals the 144,000 he saves them and no
[1:07:06] doubt they go in the rapture as well
[1:07:08] praise God amen 144,000 I'm sorry not
[1:07:11] rapture millennium under forward four
[1:07:13] thousand golden linen the at rapture
[1:07:14] took place I'm sorry they go into the
[1:07:16] Millennium somehow because they've got
[1:07:18] the seal of God in their foreheads
[1:07:19] they're born again praise God amen
[1:07:24] so how he heads up so Satan heads up
[1:07:27] this serpent slithers all the way
[1:07:29] through history church he's slithering
[1:07:31] now through riches and cares of the
[1:07:32] world in soft living but he heads up in
[1:07:34] an antichrist a man that sits in the
[1:07:38] temple of God the drew the Jewish temple
[1:07:40] declaring that He is God
[1:07:42] exalting himself above the Word of God
[1:07:46] this is how he heads up this is how he
[1:07:50] exalts himself as a serpent he's not a
[1:07:54] murderer right by physically physical
[1:07:58] thing he's not a he's not a Muslim right
[1:08:01] because if he's a Muslim he wouldn't sit
[1:08:02] in the Jewish temple killing himself God
[1:08:04] he wouldn't deceive the whole world he's
[1:08:07] got to look like he's a Christian right
[1:08:10] so the very height of hypocrisy is Satan
[1:08:14] that old serpent he ends up at the very
[1:08:16] at the very climax of history he ends up
[1:08:19] as a Christian sitting in the Jewish
[1:08:21] temple and that's his great deception
[1:08:24] and the way to know is test him by the
[1:08:26] word amen that's how you always know
[1:08:29] that Satan he's always saying no not the
[1:08:31] word say this not this that word say
[1:08:33] this and we've just got to say we know
[1:08:35] what the word says we're staying with
[1:08:36] the word we're keeping the word we're
[1:08:38] obeying the word we're gonna live
[1:08:40] righteously and we're not going to be a
[1:08:42] part of the supper we're not getting
[1:08:43] choked by the serpent we're going to fly
[1:08:45] away out of here like eagles in the raps
[1:08:47] hey man oh yeah thank the Lord so that
[1:08:53] was just a real quick review of that
[1:08:54] trail the serpent thought you see him
[1:08:57] all the way through the Bible he's
[1:09:01] always like that he's always really
[1:09:02] close upon the believer well we've got a
[1:09:05] great Shepherd here to protect us praise
[1:09:07] God amen now the next thing so that's
[1:09:13] the symbol that's the first symbol is
[1:09:14] the old serpent the next thing is the
[1:09:16] key revelation the key revelation is in
[1:09:19] Revelation 20 verse 5 let's go back
[1:09:22] there revelation 20 verse 5 the church
[1:09:32] don't forget that Diotrephes all's he
[1:09:35] did was speak evil against the message
[1:09:36] preachers and he wouldn't a fellowship
[1:09:40] with him anymore and that was the
[1:09:42] serpent in John's day so notice when
[1:09:46] people say they won't fellowship with us
[1:09:48] anymore or when someone says they won't
[1:09:50] fellowship with you or come to the
[1:09:51] church anymore there's something wrong
[1:09:53] with that something wrong with that
[1:09:56] because that's all it was but it was so
[1:09:58] religious it looks so good
[1:10:00] they thought they had it they just they
[1:10:02] just gave themselves preeminence over
[1:10:04] the truth of God's Word revelation 20
[1:10:09] verse 5 but the rest of the Dead lived
[1:10:12] not again until the thousand years were
[1:10:14] finished this is the first resurrection
[1:10:18] so the one of the great revelations in
[1:10:21] this chapter is that there's two
[1:10:23] resurrections praise God there's the
[1:10:26] first resurrection the rapture and the
[1:10:29] second resurrection which is the
[1:10:31] resurrection under life and the
[1:10:33] resurrection under damnation now we're
[1:10:35] pretty familiar with this but I just
[1:10:36] want to state it again just so our
[1:10:38] children can hear the first resurrection
[1:10:40] is the rapture of the new testament
[1:10:42] church is smoking up in 1st
[1:10:44] Thessalonians 4:17 1st corinthians 15:51
[1:10:47] to 54 and this is the wedding of Christ
[1:10:51] and his wife only those who have the
[1:10:55] Holy Ghost who have the oil in their
[1:10:58] lamps red and full of oil Oh
[1:11:01] they will go out to meet Christ at the
[1:11:03] weddings after at the marriage supper
[1:11:05] praise God the rest of the Dead lived
[1:11:09] not again until the thousand years were
[1:11:12] finished but they will rise at the
[1:11:16] second resurrection
[1:11:18] now the second resurrection is also
[1:11:20] later in this chapter in verse 11 to 15
[1:11:25] let's just read it because we got time
[1:11:27] and I saw a great white throne and him
[1:11:30] that sat on it from whose face the earth
[1:11:32] and the heaven fled away and there was
[1:11:34] found no place for them verse 12 and I
[1:11:40] saw the dead small and great stand
[1:11:42] before God and the books were opened and
[1:11:44] another book was opened which is the
[1:11:46] book of life and the dead were judged
[1:11:48] out of those things which were written
[1:11:49] in the books according to their works
[1:11:52] and the sea gave up the Dead which were
[1:11:55] in it and death and he'll delivered up
[1:11:57] the Dead which were in them see there's
[1:11:59] hell there's the heart of the earth see
[1:12:00] the hardy earth where all the sinners
[1:12:01] are they got to give up all those souls
[1:12:04] that come up to the white throne
[1:12:05] judgment and they were judged every man
[1:12:09] according to their works and death and
[1:12:12] he'll were cast in the lake of fire this
[1:12:14] is the second death and who suffers not
[1:12:16] found written in the book of life was
[1:12:18] cast into the lake of fire all right so
[1:12:24] everybody can see now there's two
[1:12:26] resurrections the first resurrection is
[1:12:29] God taking his bride Jesus taking his
[1:12:32] bride to the marriage supper and they
[1:12:34] get to enjoy the thousand year
[1:12:35] millennial reign but the second
[1:12:37] resurrection is all the dead that missed
[1:12:40] the rapture get brought up to the white
[1:12:43] throne and there's no escaping it can
[1:12:46] you imagine that church you've got to
[1:12:48] stand before Jesus Christ at the white
[1:12:50] throne judgment now look at that you'll
[1:12:53] either sit with him or you'll stand
[1:12:55] before him which one is it gonna be and
[1:12:57] it all depends who you're standing for
[1:13:00] right now praise God I'm gonna stand for
[1:13:04] Christ now so that when the white throne
[1:13:06] judgement comes I don't stand in front
[1:13:08] of him but I sit with him praise God so
[1:13:11] I'm willing to stand with the unpopular
[1:13:14] now I'm willing to be rejected now I'm
[1:13:17] willing to me he made mocked in front of
[1:13:18] now and stand with Christ because I
[1:13:21] don't want to stand before at the white
[1:13:23] throne judgment I want to be seated by
[1:13:25] his side you imagine all the people that
[1:13:31] don't want to come to church or they
[1:13:32] don't want to face judgment cuz
[1:13:34] judgments right now right for the
[1:13:35] believer judgment begins in the house of
[1:13:38] God they won't come instead that's why
[1:13:39] we stand before the Word of God right
[1:13:41] when I say let's take our Texas stand
[1:13:43] what are we doing we're standing before
[1:13:45] the king of kings and Lord of lords now
[1:13:47] we're standing for judgment now so at
[1:13:50] that day at the second resurrection we
[1:13:52] don't have to stand before mand shaking
[1:13:54] our shoes and wonder am I going to make
[1:13:56] it or not is my name on that book or not
[1:13:58] did it stay on the book or they could
[1:13:59] get blotted out we don't don't worry
[1:14:01] about it because we can experience his
[1:14:03] love now we can experience his
[1:14:05] forgiveness now and we can know like
[1:14:07] Jesus said you can rejoice that your
[1:14:09] names written in heaven now praise God
[1:14:11] hey man that's what we should rejoice
[1:14:14] that's what struck me on Sunday morning
[1:14:16] I start dancing around here because I
[1:14:17] was like mine so much be thankful for my
[1:14:19] children are healthy I know the message
[1:14:21] God's kept me from sin I just our dance
[1:14:23] around here because I thought about all
[1:14:25] the things that have to be thankful for
[1:14:26] praise God and the greatest thing Jesus
[1:14:29] said is to rejoice that your name is on
[1:14:32] the Lamb's Book of Life amen hahaha the
[1:14:36] greatest joy the greatest rejoicing is
[1:14:38] to know that heaven is going to receive
[1:14:40] you that you're accepted in the beloved
[1:14:43] Amen I don't know you praise God thank
[1:14:49] you Jesus what a blessing to know that
[1:14:53] praise God
[1:14:54] so the second resurrection they got to
[1:14:57] stand before Jesus and they got a
[1:14:59] tremble like a little leaf
[1:15:00] they got trouble there because they
[1:15:02] wouldn't come and tremble now during
[1:15:04] their lifetime and Jesus will play the
[1:15:07] video of their life they got invited to
[1:15:09] church someone gave him a message book
[1:15:11] write some give some gave of my book or
[1:15:13] someone gave a website but they turned
[1:15:15] it down instead of facing the Christ
[1:15:18] during their lifetime now they've got to
[1:15:21] face Christ at the white throne judgment
[1:15:24] that's the second resurrection
[1:15:28] I want to read again out of John 5:28
[1:15:30] because it's a very helpful scripture
[1:15:34] the first resurrection is for the
[1:15:37] rapture the catching up of Christ's
[1:15:40] bride but the second resurrection is the
[1:15:44] resurrection unto life or damnation John
[1:15:47] 5:28 and 29 Marvel none of this John
[1:15:59] 5:28 for the hours coming in which all
[1:16:02] that are in the grave she hears voice we
[1:16:03] just read about that revelation 20 the
[1:16:05] Seas got to give it up the land's got to
[1:16:08] give it up everybody definitely have to
[1:16:10] give up the souls verse 29 and shall
[1:16:14] come forth they that have done good unto
[1:16:16] the resurrection of life and they have
[1:16:19] done evil unto the resurrection of
[1:16:21] damnation
[1:16:22] praise God so God just brings it down to
[1:16:25] this have you done good or have you done
[1:16:28] evil now this is for the foolish virgin
[1:16:33] this is for the people that are scarcely
[1:16:35] saved and remember Matthew 25 so there
[1:16:39] were six things they could do to get
[1:16:40] saved give food give shelter give
[1:16:44] clothing I can't remember all the other
[1:16:46] ones there were six things they could do
[1:16:48] to get saved and Jesus says will you do
[1:16:50] good in your life or will you do evil
[1:16:53] and that's what will be determined the
[1:16:57] judge will determine it I say let's
[1:16:59] let's not try to judge others but let's
[1:17:01] leave it in the judges hands praise God
[1:17:04] we got to preach it we got to tell it
[1:17:06] but let's live it let's do what's right
[1:17:09] let's not trying to judge people now
[1:17:10] let's give warnings the Bible said
[1:17:12] warning every man praise God we must
[1:17:15] warn them but we don't know anyone's
[1:17:17] final destination right or anyone's
[1:17:21] destiny we don't know that for sure but
[1:17:23] let us give warning and let us tell men
[1:17:26] to do good let's encourage them to not
[1:17:29] do evil but clean to that which is good
[1:17:31] and let us do good praise God amen I'm
[1:17:36] gonna read that just so I got it
[1:17:38] six of those Matthew 25 I thought that
[1:17:42] was important to repeat today if you
[1:17:45] haven't done this church he said four
[1:17:46] hours a hunger gave me me if someone's
[1:17:48] hungry try to feed him if someone's
[1:17:51] thirsty give them a drink if someone's a
[1:17:53] stranger try to take him in or get him a
[1:17:55] hotel or find them a place to stay
[1:17:57] if someone's naked give them clothes
[1:18:00] if someone's sick visit them if
[1:18:04] someone's in prison visit them in prison
[1:18:06] six things so children you remember two
[1:18:11] children somebody sometimes God's moves
[1:18:12] through you sometimes God speaks through
[1:18:14] you if you see a need let's be
[1:18:17] Christians and let's meet that need
[1:18:18] because God is going to give salvation

[1:18:38] not evil but that's that lets bit but
[1:18:41] let's be real Christians let's go step
[1:18:42] further and let's just not do good to
[1:18:44] the bride praise God

[1:18:53] to everybody let's have the love of the
[1:18:55] Heavenly Father praise God anybody can
[1:19:00] be good to those that are good to them
[1:19:01] it takes real Christianity a real
[1:19:03] Christian to be good even to your
[1:19:05] enemies praise God alright be a little
[1:19:11] bit more to go here the timing of this
[1:19:14] chapter is totally chronological
[1:19:16] revelation 20 this let's head back to
[1:19:19] this is one of the rare chapters in
[1:19:21] Revelation that is total totally
[1:19:24] chronological in the correct order so it
[1:19:29] starts with the tribulation I'm sorry
[1:19:31] I'm sometime after the tribulation
[1:19:32] Satan's bound for a thousand years which
[1:19:35] allows Christ and his people to complete
[1:19:37] their thousand-year honeymoon on the
[1:19:39] earth at the completion of the hundred
[1:19:42] I'm sorry thousand years Satan's loosed
[1:19:44] for a short season and deceives the
[1:19:46] nation's to come as Gog and Magog and
[1:19:49] battle against Christ his wife and
[1:19:52] beloved city foul fire devours the
[1:19:56] deceived Army Satan is cast in the lake
[1:19:59] of fire and the second resurrection
[1:20:02] gathers all men and women to stand
[1:20:04] before God at the white throne judgment
[1:20:06] and receive either eternal life or the
[1:20:10] second death in the lake of fire
[1:20:12] totally chronological let's read gog and
[1:20:16] magog again let's read that by God's
[1:20:17] grace verse 7 revelation 20 verse 7 and
[1:20:25] when the thousand years are expired
[1:20:27] Satan shall be loosed out of his prison
[1:20:29] and should go out to deceive the nations
[1:20:33] which are in the four quarters of the
[1:20:35] earth Gog and Magog to gather them
[1:20:37] together to battle the number of whom is
[1:20:41] as the sand of the sea and they went up
[1:20:45] on the breadth of the earth encompass
[1:20:47] the camp of the Saints about and the
[1:20:49] beloved city and fire came down from God
[1:20:51] out of heaven and devoured him you would
[1:20:53] think you would think a thousand years
[1:20:57] in prison would get you to repent don't
[1:20:59] you thousand years he's fallen uh and he
[1:21:05] never thinks maybe I should repent and
[1:21:09] so he gets another lease on life he gets
[1:21:11] taken out of prison and what's his first
[1:21:13] thing let's deceive let's fight let's
[1:21:16] kill after a thousand years of being
[1:21:19] locked up and of course they can't
[1:21:21] repent but even other doesn't come to
[1:21:22] his mind he still wants to fight he
[1:21:26] still wants to kill he still wants to
[1:21:28] destroy this is his final shot at it and
[1:21:33] so even a thousand years of punishment a
[1:21:36] thousand years of prison will never
[1:21:37] change his heart Church we should be so
[1:21:39] thankful that our hearts of stone have
[1:21:42] been changed in the hearts of flesh
[1:21:44] praise God we should be thrown so
[1:21:47] thankful that the the evil thoughts we
[1:21:50] used to hold the evil sins we used to
[1:21:52] commit that we no longer commit them
[1:21:54] that we can sing that song are the
[1:21:57] things I used to do I do them no more
[1:21:59] amen because Satan can be put in prison
[1:22:02] for a thousand years and never changes
[1:22:04] way
[1:22:05] he never thinks any different he still
[1:22:07] wants a kill and deceive and destroy but
[1:22:10] you and I we get on a hard time and if
[1:22:12] we come in and sin will say God forgive
[1:22:14] me I want to do different
[1:22:16] I want to overcome I want to do better I
[1:22:18] want to please you I want to do the
[1:22:20] righteousness of God amen but a thousand
[1:22:24] years is enough to convince him to
[1:22:27] change his ways it's not enough but God
[1:22:36] finally sends it down
[1:22:37] Satan's last act is trying to gather
[1:22:41] people in a big group to kill God I'm
[1:22:45] sorry Jesus and the bride that's his
[1:22:48] last thing he wants the last thing he
[1:22:50] gets to do is trying to kill his wife
[1:22:53] him and his wife see he's always a
[1:22:56] homewrecker isn't he he's always trying
[1:22:59] to divide husbands and wife he's always
[1:23:02] trying to destroy families that's the
[1:23:04] first thing he did in the Garden of Eden
[1:23:05] that's the last thing he does here amen
[1:23:07] no I just struck me like that never saw
[1:23:09] it like that the first thing he does is
[1:23:11] divide Adam and Eve the last thing he
[1:23:13] does is trying to divide Christ in the
[1:23:14] church but just like always
[1:23:17] God's stronger and God knows how to
[1:23:20] protect his children he protects his
[1:23:22] children through fire amen
[1:23:25] Holy Ghost fire yeah let's just say in a
[1:23:28] regular fire this is Holy Ghost spot
[1:23:30] this is eternal fiery may god those are
[1:23:34] predictors grunt awesome fire amen
[1:23:36] that'll try that old serpent away in
[1:23:38] fact it'll drive him right to fire amen
[1:23:41] to the judgment fires of judgment
[1:23:44] because in verse 10 and the devil that
[1:23:47] deceived them was cast in lake of fire
[1:23:48] brimstone where the beast and the false
[1:23:50] prophet are and shall be tormented day
[1:23:53] and night forever and ever now don't get
[1:23:54] deceived on that people have called me
[1:23:56] this week
[1:23:56] I saw your video on hell's that eternal
[1:23:58] what about this well Church if you give
[1:24:02] Satan eternal life then he must believe
[1:24:03] in Jesus as his Savior because eternal
[1:24:06] life only comes through believing Jesus
[1:24:09] Christ as your personal Savior but
[1:24:12] remember the Bible said no murder hath
[1:24:14] eternal life
[1:24:15] and Satan the bollocks that Satan was a
[1:24:17] murderer and a liar from the beginning
[1:24:19] right so what caused Cain to kill Abel
[1:24:25] it was the murderous spirit of Satan
[1:24:27] inside a Cain right so ultimately Satan
[1:24:31] was responsible for that Kane just
[1:24:33] yielded to Satan's desires that's right
[1:24:38] so see my master they may burn for
[1:24:40] thousands of years maybe millions or
[1:24:44] years but at some point they will come
[1:24:46] to destruction because their souls are
[1:24:48] not eternal but the fire is eternal
[1:24:51] because it's a part of God it's a
[1:24:52] manifestation of God our God is at what
[1:24:55] consuming fire amen
[1:24:58] so when the Bible said eternal fire
[1:25:00] that's what it means it's a
[1:25:01] manifestation of God amen
[1:25:03] God's eternal praise God whenever he
[1:25:06] manifests himself it manifests himself
[1:25:08] however he wants but whatever
[1:25:09] manifestation it's part of his eternal
[1:25:11] Creek creation praise God as I was part
[1:25:14] of his eternal nature hallelujah that's
[1:25:18] right
[1:25:19] so yeah they burned their tormented
[1:25:22] forever and ever and ever but that's not
[1:25:24] eternally it can't be because they don't
[1:25:25] have eternal life so this chapter is
[1:25:30] totally chronological now Oh as I get
[1:25:34] ready to close let me set a timer here
[1:25:35] try to give me ten more ten more minutes
[1:25:38] that would be a little over hour
[1:25:41] I want to close with this thought
[1:25:44] so forgot your Bibles go to Isaiah
[1:25:47] chapter two this was a fresh thought
[1:25:57] Isaiah 2 verse 1 well look we'll close
[1:26:07] here tonight by looking at the
[1:26:08] Millennium how many are living for that
[1:26:11] place I'm living for that one praise God
[1:26:14] I'm living for that honeymoon praise God
[1:26:23] verse two Isaiah 2 verse 2 and it should
[1:26:25] come to pass in the last days that the
[1:26:27] mountain of the Lord's house should be
[1:26:29] established in the top of the mountains
[1:26:31] and shall be exalted above the hills and
[1:26:33] all nations shall flow into it now this
[1:26:37] check this goes all against the loss of
[1:26:39] gravity doesn't it so we have this
[1:26:42] mountain that's lifted up the Lord's
[1:26:44] house but all the nations flow into it
[1:26:47] it's like opposite of gravity so what is
[1:26:50] it it's God attracting all the people
[1:26:53] praise God it is God's glory everyone
[1:26:56] that's on the earth is attracted to God
[1:26:57] they're just drawn like magnets to God's
[1:27:00] house
[1:27:00] and so God goes against gravity and he
[1:27:03] draws them all up that's what he's doing
[1:27:05] right now
[1:27:05] he's drawing us up into heavenly places
[1:27:07] hey yeah because our Bible says our soul
[1:27:10] we have an anchor for the Soul and it's
[1:27:12] into the holiest of Holies it's anchored
[1:27:15] in heaven praise God so it's drawing our
[1:27:18] desires it's drawing our affections
[1:27:20] upward praise God all nations shall flow
[1:27:24] into this temple in the Millennium
[1:27:28] praise God verse 3 and many people shall
[1:27:33] go and say come ye and let us go up to
[1:27:36] the mountain of the Lord to the house of
[1:27:37] the God of Jacob and he will teach us
[1:27:40] his ways and we will walk in his pass
[1:27:42] for out of Zion shall go forth the law
[1:27:44] the word of the Lord from Jerusalem hey
[1:27:48] man where do you learn about God at your
[1:27:52] house praise God don't you live with
[1:27:55] Jesus I was gonna live with Jesus where
[1:27:57] they can learn about God they've got to
[1:27:59] go up to the house of God to learn and
[1:28:01] there you you and I will be with Christ
[1:28:03] praise God all these nations we're gonna
[1:28:08] learn about God same way we do today in
[1:28:10] the God's house praise God
[1:28:13] you should be learning about God's house
[1:28:15] tonight praise God we should be learning
[1:28:17] about the things of God anyone knows we
[1:28:19] learn about the ballgame go to the ball
[1:28:22] field well learn about music go to the
[1:28:24] Opera House we'll learn about God go to
[1:28:27] church praise God so for a thousand
[1:28:30] years God opens up his home and said
[1:28:32] come let me teach you about myself and
[1:28:35] Lord willing maybe we'll teach you
[1:28:37] those lessons maybe Jesus will let us
[1:28:38] teach a few of those lessons first for
[1:28:41] he so judge amongst the nations and
[1:28:43] shall rebuke many people look at that
[1:28:45] rebuked in the Millennium
[1:28:48] there'll be no sin there but that
[1:28:50] doesn't mean they they won't they won't
[1:28:52] they'll be human right but there'll be
[1:28:54] no sin so they must there must be
[1:28:56] something where they can maybe be
[1:28:59] tempted or something like that I don't
[1:29:00] know how if Satan is not there either
[1:29:01] but Jesus has to rebuke many people they
[1:29:04] got the wrong ideas somehow they got
[1:29:06] wrong ideas so Jesus needed to rebuke
[1:29:08] them now look at this verse 4 and they
[1:29:11] shall beat their swords into plowshares
[1:29:14] and their spears into pruning hooks
[1:29:17] nation shall not lift up sword against
[1:29:19] nation neither shall they learn war
[1:29:21] anymore so they're gonna come to the
[1:29:23] house of God Church with swords but
[1:29:25] after Jesus rebukes them and corrects
[1:29:28] them they're gonna take their swords
[1:29:30] that I don't need these swords anymore
[1:29:31] let me beat them down the plows shears
[1:29:33] my battles are not against my brothers
[1:29:35] here so I'm gonna get rid of my weapons
[1:29:38] I'm going to change my weapons and the
[1:29:39] tools to feed the people all because
[1:29:43] they went to the house of God and they
[1:29:45] got taught by Jesus because Jesus said i
[1:29:47] reaiiy love everyone that I rebuke
[1:29:50] praise God so even in Jesus were here
[1:29:53] they can feel as love Amen and they know
[1:29:57] that there's there gonna be no Wars
[1:29:58] there's gonna be no reason that these
[1:30:00] swords our battles are over let's turn
[1:30:03] these swords in the powering tools and
[1:30:05] let's go work the land and let's bring
[1:30:07] forth food let's enjoy this honeymoon
[1:30:09] praise God
[1:30:11] hey hey men my now of course they're not
[1:30:15] the bride but they're gonna enjoy the
[1:30:17] benefits of our honeymoon with Christ's
[1:30:21] mercy Lord go to Isaiah
[1:30:27] eleven verse three Isaiah 11 verse three
[1:30:41] and shall make him of quick
[1:30:43] understanding in the fear of the Lord he
[1:30:45] shall not judge out to the side of his
[1:30:46] eyes neither reprove after the hearing
[1:30:48] of his ears but with righteousness shall
[1:30:49] he judged the poor reprove with equity
[1:30:51] for the meek of the earth and he shall
[1:30:53] smite the earth with a rod of his mouth
[1:30:55] and with the breath of his lips shall
[1:30:57] slay the wicked and righteousness shall
[1:30:59] be the girdle of his loins and
[1:31:01] faithfulness the girdle of his reins the
[1:31:03] wolf shall also drell with the lamb and
[1:31:05] the leopard shall lie down with the kid

[1:31:16] the bear shall feed their young ones
[1:31:18] shall lie down together and the lion
[1:31:20] shall eat straw like an ox what is this
[1:31:25] it's returning to the Garden of Eden
[1:31:26] conditions right getting closer to the
[1:31:28] new heavens and new earth the New
[1:31:30] Jerusalem verse 8 and the suckling child
[1:31:34] shall play on the whole of the ASP and

[1:31:42] destroy in all my holy mountain for the
[1:31:43] earth shall be full of the knowledge of
[1:31:45] the Lord as the waters cover the sea and
[1:31:48] in that day there shall be a root of
[1:31:50] Jesse which shall stand for an ensign of
[1:31:51] the people to it shall the Gentiles seek
[1:31:54] and his rest shall be glorious what is
[1:31:56] this what is the set or what is the
[1:31:57] Millennium it's a day of rest it's the
[1:31:59] thousand years of rest

[1:32:09] knowledge of the Lord my you can't even
[1:32:11] hardly walk out of this room and
[1:32:13] experience the knowledge of the Lord

[1:32:25] has rebuked any evil right and he's

[1:35:16] forth of Zion and the word of the Lord
[1:35:20] from Jerusalem he should judge among
[1:35:22] many people and rebuke strong nations

[1:35:29] swords into plowshares and their spears
[1:35:33] into pruning hooks nation shall not lift
[1:35:38] up a sword against nation neither shall
[1:35:39] they learn of war anymore but they shall
[1:35:44] sit every man under his vine and under
[1:35:46] his fig tree and none shall make them

[1:39:48] and I no way no way why because he's
[1:39:52] rebuking us right now where he's God he
[1:39:55] corrects us right now because He loves
[1:39:56] us we suffer rebukes hard sermons hard

[1:40:04] changed my life and God trying to get
[1:40:06] victory helped me we keep getting
[1:40:08] rebuked now because he knows we love him

[1:40:33] that you should not have done that we
[1:40:38] have to rebuke now although I failed the
[1:40:40] Lord again my goodness I didn't want to
[1:40:42] fail the Lord we have to suffer rebuke
