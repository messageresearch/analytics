[0:00] you. I love you. God bless you.
[0:07] You know, just seeing all you makes me
[0:08] want to cry because I'm so thankful that
[0:10] you're here tonight and love you and
[0:12] appreciate you. Thankful for uh
[0:16] opportunity to be with the saints by
[0:17] God's grace. So, just always want to
[0:20] cherish life, don't we? We just want to
[0:22] uh
[0:23] &gt;&gt; cherish what God has given to us and be
[0:25] thankful
[0:26] in every uh every situation.
[0:30] Ephesians 6:10, 11, and 12. I think for
[0:33] time sake, because we've preached on
[0:34] this numerous times, I'll probably just
[0:36] read verse 12. Ephesians 6:12.
[0:46] We've done four parts on uh wrestling
[0:48] not against flesh and blood. So, this
[0:49] will be part five tonight. Uh by God's
[0:53] grace,
[1:01] If we can, if you're there, say, "Amen."
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04] &gt;&gt; Let's read this on three. 1 2 3. For we
[1:07] wrestle not against flesh and blood, but
[1:10] against principalities, against powers,
[1:14] against the rulers of the darkness of
[1:16] this world, against spiritual wickedness
[1:19] in high places. May God add his blessing
[1:22] to the reading of the word. You may be
[1:24] seated.
[1:28] So, we want to look at this here again
[1:30] tonight. Uh, by the grace of God,
[1:34] you I've already had a runny nose, you
[1:35] know, so I apologize. I'm kind of bad, a
[1:37] little runny nose this week. And then
[1:39] now I'm kind of emotional about today's
[1:41] uh assassination.
[1:43] Um, but um just bear with me here if I
[1:47] got to wipe my nose and blow my nose a
[1:48] little bit by God's grace. Uh, so we
[1:51] want to look at uh wrestling not against
[1:53] flesh and blood.
[1:55] Uh, I had this thought to preach, you
[1:59] know, weeks ago and then I kind of
[2:00] forgot about it. I went to brother Cam's
[2:01] church. I preached this at brother Cam's
[2:04] and uh,
[2:06] you know, at the end of the service, you
[2:08] know, Cam always comes up and boy, he I
[2:10] tell you, he's so gifted, brother Rod,
[2:11] at picking up the anointing. So, when I
[2:14] leave the pulpit, he gets up there and
[2:16] it's like it's like he's going to preach
[2:18] and like he's ready to go like locked
[2:20] and loaded. like he just gets under that
[2:23] anointing and he starts preaching and
[2:25] I'm, you know, I'm down here saying amen
[2:27] and loving it. I'm raising my hands.
[2:29] Might it might be on YouTube. That
[2:31] part's probably on YouTube. And Cam
[2:33] starts preaching and he says something
[2:35] just really beautiful. Uh which I'll
[2:37] share in just a moment. Um but you know,
[2:39] in the first four parts, you know,
[2:41] saints, we're looking at all the
[2:42] different evil spirits that we might
[2:44] wrestle, right? We saw how there's four
[2:46] layers or at least uh four different
[2:49] classifications of evil spirits we might
[2:52] wrestle right in verse 12. We see
[2:56] there's principalities,
[2:58] there's powers,
[3:00] there's rulers of the darkness of this
[3:02] world
[3:03] and there's spiritual wickedness in high
[3:05] places. So now there's either four
[3:07] levels or maybe those are just different
[3:09] titles to the same thing. It could be
[3:12] that too because remember in Revelation
[3:14] 12, Satan is called that old dragon,
[3:16] that old serpent,
[3:18] uh, Lucifer, Satan, you know, I'm
[3:21] missing one. There's one one more in
[3:22] there. Um, that the wicked one it might
[3:25] be. And so he's given many titles, but
[3:27] he only has one name, right? Lucifer is
[3:29] his name. And now he's called uh Lucifer
[3:32] means the bright one, the shining one.
[3:34] Um but now he's called Satan the
[3:36] adversary
[3:38] uh the accuser.
[3:41] uh but you know by God's grace uh
[3:45] whether it's four different layers or
[3:46] whether it's uh you know four different
[3:50] uh meanings of the same uh battle or or
[3:53] same realm I'd say uh we we wrestle
[3:56] against evil spirits and uh you know
[3:59] through this series we tried to look you
[4:00] know I felt most impressioned here you
[4:02] know uh to look at like what Jesus said
[4:05] Jesus said cares of this world and
[4:07] riches and then what I've seen in the
[4:10] message I I I felt led to preach a lot
[4:12] on porn and lust and everything like
[4:14] that. You know, those were those were
[4:15] the three main ones that I was dealing
[4:17] with uh in these series, you know, fear,
[4:20] the cares of the world, that means
[4:22] anxieties of this world.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Uh Jesus said that'll choke you out if
[4:27] you're not careful. You get so uh
[4:29] anxious about things of life that you
[4:31] don't have any testimony, you don't have
[4:33] any praise, uh you don't have any
[4:35] witnessing ability.
[4:37] Uh but if if you're in that condition,
[4:39] we saw God can give you overcoming
[4:42] power. God can renew your strength and
[4:44] you can get back up your up on your feet
[4:46] and start fighting for Jesus.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[4:49] &gt;&gt; You don't have to live in fear. We don't
[4:51] have to live in anxiety. And I' I've
[4:52] told you different stories about me how
[4:54] I've battled that the last few years,
[4:56] you know, maybe more than ever, you
[4:58] know, uh but God knows and God allows
[5:00] it. God allows it. Um
[5:04] I was studying on uh the other series
[5:06] God hiding himself in simplicity and and
[5:09] brother Random said this about Moses. He
[5:11] said God let him get trained for 40
[5:14] years in the wisdom of Egypt. That's the
[5:17] smartest wisdom on the earth.
[5:20] Brother Ram said God did did this only
[5:23] to show him that it would fail him.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Imagine that. a 40-year lesson of
[5:32] natural studies and then it takes 40
[5:33] years to beat that out of him. Brother
[5:35] Brandham said on the backside of the
[5:36] wilderness,
[5:39] &gt;&gt; God used twothirds of his life just to
[5:41] show him you're nothing.
[5:44] And then God also let him become a
[5:46] murderer.
[5:48] That that just that's so hard for me to
[5:50] understand. But God's ways are higher
[5:51] than our ways.
[5:53] &gt;&gt; And so we realize, you know, our lives
[5:55] are every footsteps or every footstep is
[5:58] order the Lord.
[5:59] You have to forgive me. I'm just kind of
[6:02] not really with it here like I normally
[6:03] would maybe would be by God's grace. I'm
[6:05] just a little uh just a little emotional
[6:08] here tonight. But uh
[6:13] you know those are the three we looked
[6:14] at the cares of riches. You know um I
[6:18] don't know how much that battles maybe
[6:20] so many people here just wanting to be
[6:22] rich. I feel like I'm just struggling
[6:23] just to get by. Praise God.
[6:26] uh just to try to save up and uh you
[6:29] know deal with inflation.
[6:32] &gt;&gt; I don't really I never want to be rich.
[6:34] I just would I'd like to have just
[6:35] peace, you know, and not have to worry
[6:37] about everything, you know. I've gone
[6:38] through scenes of life where I haven't
[6:40] had to. I'm thankful for that. Uh and
[6:42] we're blessed abundantly just beyond
[6:45] measure, you know, many times overall
[6:47] compared to the whole world as our
[6:49] sisters from Africa know. We're blessed
[6:51] beyond measure. Um, but you know, yet
[6:54] yet we're still we're still we still
[6:56] have to wrestle that. We still have to
[6:57] wrestle and not get choked out by
[7:00] &gt;&gt; uh financial concerns. I'll just say it
[7:02] like that because I'm not trying to be
[7:03] rich, but the finances do sometimes they
[7:05] get stressful
[7:07] &gt;&gt; just like uh fears about, you know,
[7:09] violence as we saw today. You know,
[7:11] there's there's fears about that and uh
[7:14] there's always been nuclear war fears
[7:16] since the 40s, right? There's always
[7:18] been brother Ram on the tapes. Brother
[7:20] Rod, Brother Brandham always is telling
[7:22] people, "Don't fear that. Trust in God."
[7:24] He he'd always say, "Get under the
[7:26] shelter of Jehovah's Wings."
[7:28] &gt;&gt; You know, they had uh all those sellar
[7:30] shelters. Do you remember what they were
[7:31] called? Or
[7:32] &gt;&gt; bomb shelters.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; Bomb shelters. Yeah. And he said, "Get
[7:35] under the bomb shelters of Jehovah's
[7:37] Wings." Hallelujah.
[7:38] &gt;&gt; Jehovah eagle. Rest under his wings.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; And so, you know, there's that was a
[7:44] definitely a fear in that day. And so,
[7:46] you know, we have fears in this day, of
[7:48] course, as well. uh every age has its
[7:50] fears.
[7:53] Uh and then you know we looked at uh you
[7:55] know pornography and the lust of of the
[7:57] eyes and so forth. And you know I heard
[7:59] a I heard a interesting stat this week
[8:03] uh from a preacher from Africa. Uh and I
[8:07] I like a lot of his preaching but some
[8:08] of it I disagree with. You know I feel
[8:10] like he lifts brother Ram too high and
[8:12] but I'm you know I don't call his name
[8:13] because I don't I have nothing against
[8:15] it brother. I really enjoy a lot of his
[8:16] preaching. But he's preached a lot of
[8:18] youth meetings and regarding uh you know
[8:21] lust and porn. He said when he started
[8:24] teaching youth camps, he gave out uh
[8:27] surveys to the youth that were anonymous
[8:28] so they didn't have to put their names
[8:30] on them. And he especially asked the
[8:32] young men and the and the young so these
[8:34] are the young people uh anywhere from 13
[8:36] to 20 something right in the message
[8:38] right message. So I want you to catch
[8:40] that. Beatric and Naomi message people.
[8:43] And he asked these young people how many
[8:44] are addicted to porn? He said 90% of the
[8:48] boys were
[8:50] and he said 60% of the girls were in one
[8:54] form or another. Now that could be
[8:56] reading that could be reading just
[8:58] books, magazines.
[9:02] So he, you know, that just really struck
[9:04] me, you know, as I was talking about
[9:05] wrestling.
[9:08] You know,
[9:09] it's never been easier for Satan to show
[9:12] people porn than than today.
[9:15] So the the young people, male and
[9:17] female, need to know how to wrestle
[9:20] against these evil spirits.
[9:22] &gt;&gt; And he was making the point, I might
[9:24] share it with you, Sister Naomi, Sister
[9:25] Beatatric. I was going to share it with
[9:26] my wife. And he was making the point,
[9:28] you've got to be the first, try to be
[9:30] the first one to talk to your children
[9:31] about this area.
[9:33] &gt;&gt; Just educate them about
[9:36] uh reproduction, human reproduction,
[9:39] because they're, think about that.
[9:40] They're either the the first person
[9:42] they're going to hear from is either
[9:43] filled with the Holy Ghost or filled
[9:45] with demons.
[9:47] &gt;&gt; And so if they can have the if they can
[9:49] have the the instruction, the education
[9:51] from a Holy Ghost fililled person, it's
[9:53] way better. They'd be able to recognize
[9:55] if they're living right. And if they
[9:58] have a pure heart, they able to
[9:59] recognize, oh, that's the devil.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; That's not pleasing to God.
[10:03] &gt;&gt; Right? And every natural human reaction,
[10:04] the first time you see something like
[10:06] you know, oh that's wrong.
[10:08] I mean, you you know, because you have
[10:10] such an innocence from God, you know,
[10:12] and we're thankful for that. But, uh,
[10:15] you know, for these four services, I
[10:17] preached on just wrestling against, you
[10:18] know, uh, whatever evil spirit you might
[10:21] battle.
[10:23] But Cam brought out this thought and he
[10:25] just said it so plainly. He said, and
[10:27] I'm just paraphrasing. I'm probably
[10:28] chopping it up, so forgive me. But, uh,
[10:30] I want to look at this tonight. But
[10:33] brother Cam and as I was preaching, you
[10:34] know, I did preach something there that
[10:35] I didn't preach here when Jacob wrestled
[10:37] with the angel.
[10:39] And I just I just glanced over it,
[10:41] saints, you know, I didn't give them
[10:42] anything I wouldn't give you,
[10:46] but I just glossed over that, you know,
[10:48] and brother Cam comes up under the
[10:49] anointing. It's just amazing, Malcol.
[10:50] It's like a switch. He can get up there.
[10:52] He goes from just, you know, Cam to
[10:54] preacher mode like instantly. And I've
[10:56] seen him do it many times. He can just
[10:59] really get under that anointing. And he
[11:00] starts preaching like like he's been up
[11:02] there for two hours like I was. And he
[11:05] looks at the congregation, you know, he
[11:07] said, "Just like brother Jesse
[11:08] preached." He said, "So many times we're
[11:10] always worried about wrestling
[11:12] cigarettes." Now, because there's
[11:13] somebody in the church wrestling
[11:14] cigarettes. They got to wrestle porn.
[11:16] You got to wrestle fear. He said, "So
[11:18] many times we're doing that." He said,
[11:20] he said, "We would do better if we just
[11:22] got our mind off wrestling that." And we
[11:23] started wrestling with God.
[11:28] And that just hit me like a ton of
[11:29] bricks. Like, oh, that's right.
[11:33] And church. And I thought about Job. And
[11:35] I thought when he was complaining and
[11:37] everything's going wrong, he's wrestling
[11:39] with his emotions,
[11:41] &gt;&gt; right? Wrestling with, well, this is my
[11:43] family. What about my money? And what
[11:45] about here
[11:46] &gt;&gt; and what about my cattle? And what about
[11:49] my home? And
[11:51] and when So, he's wrestling with these
[11:53] thoughts and wrestling with God. And
[11:55] what does God do? God shows him his
[11:57] character and his ability.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; So in his we'd say his darkest moment,
[12:03] his moment where he had the least amount
[12:05] of hope, his moment of his biggest
[12:07] question. Remember he said, "I'm full of
[12:09] confusion, at his lowest spot, God
[12:12] doesn't even answer his question. God
[12:14] just tries to show him how little you
[12:17] are, how vile you are, and how great I
[12:19] am.
[12:26] And so I thought just for a few minutes
[12:28] tonight we'll look at when we wrestle
[12:30] with God
[12:32] with God.
[12:34] So Jacob is the first one that we see
[12:36] wrestling with God in Genesis 32. So if
[12:39] you have your Bibles, let's go there.
[12:43] And I thought, you know, many times,
[12:45] what what is he wrestling? You know,
[12:46] what what is why does this have to
[12:48] wrestle? Why does he have to wrestle?
[12:57] Now he meets God right before uh he
[13:00] wrestles God.
[13:03] Let's go to Genesis actually 32:1. And
[13:05] Jacob went on his way and the angels of
[13:07] God met him. And when Jacob saw them, he
[13:09] said, "This is God's host." And he
[13:11] called the name of that place Meahanim.
[13:15] And Jacob sent messengers before him to
[13:17] Esau's brother unto the land of Seir,
[13:18] the country of Edom. And he commanded
[13:20] them, saying, "Thus shall you speak unto
[13:22] my lord Esau, thy servant Jacob saith,
[13:24] thus I have sojourned with Laban, and
[13:25] stayed there till now, and I have oxen
[13:27] and assa's flocks, and men's servants,
[13:29] woman servants, and I have sent to tell
[13:30] my lord that I may find grace in thy
[13:32] sight." So we see he's afraid of his
[13:35] brother.
[13:37] So the wrestling match here is fear.
[13:41] Jacob's afraid because his brother vowed
[13:43] to kill him.
[13:44] &gt;&gt; And look how he butters him up. I got
[13:45] all this money. Oh my lord. When did he
[13:50] become your Lord?
[13:52] &gt;&gt; Now, we know Lord, you know, Sarah
[13:53] called Abraham Lord. So, we know there's
[13:54] a Lord form of deity and then there's
[13:56] just a respectful way to use Lord.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; Right now, my wife's never called me
[14:01] Lord, but she could. Okay. So, there's
[14:03] just a little hint, honey. I'm just
[14:04] kidding. I'm just kidding. She shakes
[14:07] her. Give me the side eye.
[14:14] I call you princess then.
[14:17] No, I'm just joking. Of course.
[14:20] But church, look at what he says. You
[14:22] know, he says in verse uh 7, then Jacob
[14:24] was greatly afraid and distressed. Verse
[14:27] 8, "And if Esau come to one company and
[14:29] smite it, then the other company which
[14:31] is left shall escape." And Jacob said,
[14:33] "Oh God of my father Abraham, and God of
[14:35] my father Isaac, the Lord which says
[14:38] unto me, return unto thy country, and to
[14:40] thy kindred, and I will deal deal well
[14:42] with thee."
[14:44] So now, what does he do? Now, as he
[14:45] starts praying, he's in he's in fear. He
[14:47] starts praying and what does he do,
[14:48] church? He starts quoting the promise of
[14:50] God.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; Now, how many know that's the way to
[14:53] pray?
[14:55] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, you said this."
[14:57] &gt;&gt; That's not what I said. It's what you
[14:58] said.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; I can always make my request kn. But God
[15:02] doesn't have to honor my request. But
[15:03] God does have to honor his word.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; His general word to the believer, he
[15:09] does have to honor that. And he will
[15:10] honor that.
[15:13] &gt;&gt; So, he's afraid for his life. But God
[15:15] had told him, "I'm going to do deal well
[15:17] with thee." Well, that's right. And we
[15:18] picked it up last night. He lived 147
[15:21] years. This man got to live almost 150.
[15:24] Almost 150. Now, I love this prayer.
[15:27] This is one of the most beautiful
[15:28] prayers. I've repeated this numerous
[15:30] times. I forgot about it, but over the
[15:32] years, I keep coming back to it. Look at
[15:33] verse 10. I am not worthy of the least
[15:36] of all the mercies of God.
[15:40] &gt;&gt; I think anybody could say amen to that
[15:42] here tonight.
[15:43] I don't deserve anything good from God
[15:46] as far as me being able to earn it.
[15:50] &gt;&gt; I'm not worthy of it. Well, Brother
[15:52] Jess, you did that. I did nothing.
[15:57] &gt;&gt; It's all by the grace of God.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; Remember John 15:5, he said, "Apart from
[16:02] me, you can do nothing." So if anything
[16:05] good came out of my humble little
[16:07] insignificant life, then I finally
[16:09] surrendered to Jesus and Jesus could
[16:11] finally use this old vessel of clay.
[16:15] &gt;&gt; It wasn't me. It was Christ in me.
[16:21] And he says, I'm not worthy of all the
[16:23] truth which thou hast showed unto thy
[16:25] servant. I'm not worthy of this message.
[16:29] Brother had another sermon to preach. I
[16:31] was going to go through the rest of
[16:32] those thus sayith the Lords because we
[16:33] had thus say the Lord but maybe next
[16:34] time but with this assassination
[16:37] happening I thought well this seems like
[16:38] be the right way to go.
[16:41] I'm not worthy of a message like this
[16:43] that everything I can believe I can take
[16:45] it back to the Bible
[16:47] right now. There's things we wonder but
[16:49] it's not it's not a major the major
[16:51] things are thus sayeth the Lord in the
[16:53] Bible.
[16:54] I'm not worthy of a message like this.
[16:57] &gt;&gt; I don't deserve it.
[17:01] He says, "Which thou has shown unto thy
[17:02] servant. For with my staff I passed over
[17:05] this Jordan, and now I'm become two
[17:07] bands. Deliver me, I pray thee, from the
[17:09] hand of my brother, from the hand of
[17:10] Esau, for I fear him, lest he will come
[17:12] smite me and the mother of I'm sorry,
[17:15] mother with the children. As thou said,
[17:17] so see now he's quoting that word again.
[17:19] As you said, Lord, I will surely do thee
[17:21] good. Make thy seed as the sand of the
[17:23] sea, which cannot be numbered for
[17:24] multitude."
[17:26] Okay, now just I just want to skip
[17:28] forward. But what happens is Jacob's so
[17:30] afraid he sends everybody before him to
[17:33] meet Esau.
[17:34] &gt;&gt; Now church, was that a manly thing to
[17:36] do?
[17:37] &gt;&gt; That was not a manly thing to do. You
[17:39] mean you're going to let your wife and
[17:41] your children meet your archeneemy
[17:43] before you do?
[17:46] Truth. This shows he really needed a
[17:49] spiritual change in his life.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; He was a slave to fear. The Bible said
[17:54] greatly distressed, right? great fear,
[17:58] greatly afraid and distressed.
[18:01] Now he sends everybody over. Then in
[18:03] verse 24, and Jacob was left alone.
[18:06] That's exactly what God knew he needed.
[18:09] He couldn't rely on his wives. Oh honey,
[18:11] honey, let me He couldn't rely on his
[18:14] children. He was left with him and God
[18:17] alone.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; Church, that's what you will find,
[18:21] church. Many times when we need victory
[18:24] in our lives, God has to get us all
[18:26] alone with himself.
[18:29] &gt;&gt; Where there's nobody, no distraction, no
[18:31] one's around. It's just you and God.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; And there wrestled a man with him until
[18:39] the breaking of the day. Now, in this
[18:41] place, he calls it God, but other places
[18:43] said he wrestled an angel. So, it's
[18:46] either God in it in his angelic form or
[18:49] it was just the fact that the angels
[18:51] carry the presence of God like the Bible
[18:53] says.
[18:54] &gt;&gt; The Bible calls it the angel of his
[18:56] presence.
[18:58] &gt;&gt; So, when you feel the Holy Spirit, it
[19:00] could be an angel because it you feel
[19:02] the presence of God. It could be an
[19:04] angel. And we have angels camped around
[19:06] us here tonight. Praise God.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; And if I could say it like Elisha, oh
[19:09] God, open the eyes of Bride of Christ
[19:11] Fellowship. Amen. Open the pastor's
[19:13] eyes, too. open all of our eyes to see
[19:16] that there's more with us than there is
[19:18] with them.
[19:23] &gt;&gt; So he wrestles until the breaking of
[19:25] day. Now he's afraid and he's he's with
[19:26] this angel and he's wrestling the angel.
[19:32] Verse 25. And when he saw that he
[19:34] prevailed not against him, he touched
[19:35] the hollow of his thigh.
[19:38] And the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out
[19:40] of joint as he wrestled with him. And he
[19:42] said, "Let me go, for the day breakth."
[19:44] and he said, "I will not let thee go
[19:45] except thou bless me." This is such an
[19:48] amazing story. Jacob seems to overpower
[19:52] the angel of God.
[19:56] An angel visits him and he so wants
[19:58] something that will strengthen him to be
[20:01] able to face his biggest fear. He's
[20:03] like, "Angel, I'm not letting you go. I
[20:06] need you to do something. I need a
[20:07] supernatural miracle."
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:13] And he didn't wrestle for five minutes
[20:15] like we want to do. We wanted to wrestle
[20:16] five minutes in prayer and be done with
[20:18] it. But Jacob had to wrestle all night
[20:20] for this victory.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; This is why brother Ram Church would
[20:23] talk about some people need all night
[20:25] prayer.
[20:26] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Rod can correct me if I'm
[20:28] wrong, but not every person in the Bible
[20:30] had to do all night prayer.
[20:32] &gt;&gt; But some people in particular had to get
[20:36] Yes. Amen. Brother had to get in spots
[20:38] where they could they had to have a
[20:40] spirit. They had to seek God long, long
[20:41] hours.
[20:43] And remember, it's all for your good and
[20:46] it's all for a testimony to encourage
[20:48] others.
[20:51] &gt;&gt; So, this is a testimony for us that uh
[20:53] we should wrestle with God until we're
[20:55] changed. And brother would say it like
[20:56] this. You stay there and pray until
[21:01] &gt;&gt; if you need something from God and you
[21:03] really want it, then just pray until
[21:06] &gt;&gt; until you get something.
[21:09] Until you feel changed. That's happened
[21:12] to me one time. The first time I had a
[21:14] real close friend uh, you know, betray
[21:16] me in the church or get a critical
[21:18] spirit.
[21:20] I went into my furnace room, Malachi
[21:22] know, and I was crying. I said, "Oh,
[21:24] God, strengthen me." And I just kept I
[21:25] just stayed there. I don't know, maybe
[21:26] it was 20 minutes, 30 minutes, I don't
[21:28] know how long it was. I just stayed
[21:29] there until I felt the power of God come
[21:32] on me and I felt strong enough to deal
[21:33] with this. And then I got up and went
[21:35] and made the call to talk to them. I
[21:38] didn't know that was going to happen. I
[21:39] just was like, "Lord, you got to do
[21:41] something in my life. I can't believe
[21:42] this person treats me like this."
[21:45] But I stayed there until I got a change.
[21:49] &gt;&gt; And then I was able to face it and deal
[21:51] with it.
[21:54] And that's the best I felt out of the
[21:56] five times, you know, people have tried
[21:57] to come and uh, you know, accuse me of
[22:00] things. Uh, and each time they were
[22:02] wrong, as far as I understand. Um, but
[22:06] that was the one. So when I stayed there
[22:09] and prayed until I had some type of
[22:11] experience, it was just emotional
[22:13] worship and I just felt the love of God
[22:15] in my heart. I didn't I felt the fear of
[22:17] leave. That that that's the one I feel
[22:19] about the best. So that that to me
[22:22] that's the closest I could get to
[22:23] something like this with Jacob.
[22:27] He said, "Don't let me go till you bless
[22:29] me." So I'm I I'm full of fear. I need a
[22:32] blessing to get rid of fear. Yes.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; Now, the same thing we apply to men. I
[22:38] need a blessing to get over this porn.
[22:40] &gt;&gt; I need a blessing to get over this uh
[22:42] cares for riches.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; Right? I need a blessing to get over
[22:46] this critical spirit.
[22:48] &gt;&gt; Or I need a blessing to get over this
[22:49] pride in my life.
[22:52] &gt;&gt; Now, here's what I've seen, too. We need
[22:54] a blessing to get over this bitterness.
[22:57] That's right.
[23:00] &gt;&gt; So, whatever wrestling match and and
[23:02] notice uh Jacob has to go to God to win
[23:05] this match.
[23:06] &gt;&gt; He doesn't go to fear to this.
[23:10] Now, church, do we cast Yes. Do we cast
[23:12] spirits down? Yes, we can cast them
[23:13] down. Yes, we can do that. But in this
[23:15] case, God wanted him to meet him, his
[23:18] presence face to face, whether through
[23:20] an angel or God in a theophony.
[23:24] 27 he said unto him, "What is thy name?"
[23:26] And he said, "Jacob." And he said, "Thy
[23:28] name shall be no more called Jacob, but
[23:31] Israel." In other words, I'm giving you
[23:32] a name change. I'm changing your
[23:34] identity.
[23:38] And church, that that's what uh
[23:42] that that's what the medical science
[23:44] wants you to do. Say, "I'm an alcoholic
[23:46] or I'm an addict or I'm a porn addict."
[23:49] That's they want you to change your
[23:51] identity.
[23:53] But you can't say that. You got to say,
[23:56] "I'm a Christian." Praise God.
[23:58] &gt;&gt; You can't let them You can't let them uh
[24:01] &gt;&gt; put a different identity on you. You
[24:03] have to You have to accept the name
[24:04] change God gave you. Hallelujah.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, like somebody might say,
[24:12] "Well, I'm bipolar." No, you just took
[24:14] on that spirit.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; Hey, I don't doubt any chemical change
[24:18] in your life. I don't doubt anything
[24:20] physically, but that still should not be
[24:22] our confession.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; That's not who I am. That's not who you
[24:26] are. Praise God.
[24:30] &gt;&gt; And so, see, people will take on
[24:32] identities and it's the wrong thing to
[24:34] do. You got to confess, I'm saved. I'm
[24:36] forgiven. I'm a victor. I'm an
[24:38] overcomer. I'm more than a conqueror in
[24:41] Christ Jesus.
[24:43] &gt;&gt; So, God has to do that to Jacob. You're
[24:45] no longer suppler or deceiver. I name
[24:48] you Israel. Amen. Praise God. Which
[24:52] means prince and power with God.
[24:56] Because he says, "For a prince thou hast
[24:59] power with God and with men and hast
[25:01] prevailed."
[25:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:05] And the Bible said uh and Jacob said to
[25:07] him, "Tell me, I pray thee thy name."
[25:09] And he said, "Wherefore is it that thou
[25:10] ask after my name?" And he blessed him
[25:12] there. You'll see Solomon wanted to know
[25:14] the name of the Lord too. Hallelujah. He
[25:18] said, 'What is thy I think he said, what
[25:20] uh what is thy son's name? What is thy
[25:21] name and the name of thy son? I think
[25:23] that was in Proverbs 30 and 31 if I'm
[25:25] not mistaken.
[25:28] And verse 30, and Jacob called the name
[25:29] of the place Pineal, for I've seen God
[25:32] face to face, and my life is preserved.
[25:34] Now, this doesn't contradict what the
[25:36] Bible said. No man has seen God at any
[25:38] time. It doesn't contradict that because
[25:41] Jacob's just saying, "I've seen an
[25:42] angel. I've seen a theophony. But God is
[25:45] invisible and no man will ever see the
[25:47] invisible spirit of God."
[25:50] &gt;&gt; So they they fit together perfectly.
[25:53] Hallelujah.
[25:56] And so then we see in the next chapter,
[25:58] you know, uh Jacob is able to face
[26:02] his biggest fear and God blesses him and
[26:05] now his greatest enemy has become a
[26:08] friend again. Praise God. Amen.
[26:11] His greatest fear is now washed away by
[26:15] the power of his experience.
[26:18] That's why church, some people need,
[26:20] like brother Adam was saying, some
[26:21] people uh need God to just take
[26:24] something out of them. Other people need
[26:27] to learn to wrestle in order to get the
[26:28] victory.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Right.
[26:33] Yeah. There's differences. There's
[26:34] different experiences, different things
[26:37] you're going to struggle with versus
[26:38] somebody else. And so, not everybody's
[26:41] experience is going to be the same. But
[26:42] I'll say it like this. If we love Jesus
[26:44] Christ, our character should be the
[26:45] same.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. because everything is working
[26:48] together for us to have more Christlike
[26:50] character.
[26:52] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm watching the time. Got about 15
[26:55] minutes here by God's grace. So, here's
[26:57] the example uh of Jacob, you know, and
[27:01] church, think about, you know,
[27:04] think about different ones, you know,
[27:05] they had to uh David had to wrestle
[27:07] Satan, and Satan pinned him down and
[27:08] made him number the people. I shouldn't
[27:10] say made him, influenced him. Forgive me
[27:13] because remember the Bible said Satan
[27:15] tempted David. And remember the Bible
[27:17] said God was already angry with those
[27:18] 70,000 people. So God took advantage of
[27:21] both of their their weak. I'm sorry.
[27:23] Yeah. Satan took advantage of both of
[27:25] their weakness, right? And God allowed
[27:26] Satan to do that to show David his pride
[27:29] and also to punish these disobedient
[27:31] ones.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Right? So God God was able to work with
[27:36] both in order to bring correction to
[27:38] both.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:39] &gt;&gt; Okay? So we can see that quite plainly
[27:42] there. So so David gets wrestled down. A
[27:45] man after God's own heart gets wrestled
[27:47] down by Satan himself
[27:50] &gt;&gt; and loses the wrestling match. But
[27:52] church, don't let's not be I'm not I'm
[27:55] not doubting David. But thank God David
[27:57] got back up again. Praise God. Amen. How
[27:59] do you know? Because at the end of his
[28:00] life, he's still writing letters.
[28:02] Everything he says. He's still writing
[28:03] songs. At the end of his life,
[28:05] everything he said was beautiful. Praise
[28:06] God. And God accomplished getting
[28:08] Solomon on the throne. Hallelujah.
[28:11] Thanks to Basheba and of course David as
[28:13] well. those two working together.
[28:17] So if you asked Jacob, you know, what
[28:19] what was what was the what was your
[28:20] hardest wrestling match of your life?
[28:22] What would he say? God,
[28:26] it wasn't, oh, my two wives, you know,
[28:28] boy, just trying to deal with this one
[28:30] and that one. My goodness, this is so
[28:33] hard. You know, no doubt it was,
[28:36] you know, you would ask him, well, you
[28:38] know, did you struggle with fear, doubt?
[28:41] You know, what was your greatest
[28:42] wrestling match? He would said, "When I
[28:43] wrestled that angel, that was the
[28:45] greatest wrestling match of my life."
[28:49] Right?
[28:51] Some of us, what would we say? What was
[28:52] our greatest wrestling match ever?
[28:56] It's good to ask ourselves that. Praise
[28:58] God.
[29:00] It's good to know too that church when
[29:02] you're in a fearful situation or
[29:04] whenever you're in we say uh a
[29:07] lifealtering situation you've got to go
[29:10] and wrestle with God
[29:11] &gt;&gt; and say God change me
[29:15] &gt;&gt; change my heart change my outlook and
[29:19] just say this prayer like he did. I'm
[29:21] not worthy of this but I need delivered.
[29:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. Basically said I
[29:26] don't deserve the message. I don't
[29:28] deserve the truth. I I'm not worthy of
[29:30] anything, but deliver me. Keep your
[29:32] promise to me. Praise God.
[29:34] &gt;&gt; And God heard Israel. I'll say like
[29:37] that. Amen. No longer Jacob. God heard
[29:39] Israel. Amen.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; A prince with power with God and man.
[29:46] Hallelujah. Now, for time sake, I'm not
[29:48] going to be able to get into all these
[29:50] here uh by God's grace,
[29:54] but let's just hit a couple here. Uh, 2
[29:56] Samuel 12:15. 2 Samuel 12:15.
[30:12] This is, of course, David's repentance,
[30:13] and Basheba has the child from their
[30:16] adulterous experience. 2 Samuel 12:15.
[30:19] And Nathan departed unto his house, and
[30:21] the Lord struck the child that Uriah's
[30:23] wife bear unto David. but was very sick.
[30:26] David therefore besought God for the
[30:28] child, and David fasted and went in and
[30:30] lay all night upon the earth.
[30:35] So church, here we have David wrestling
[30:37] with God,
[30:39] right? What's he doing? He's laying
[30:41] there all night. God, if you could spare
[30:43] the child. Now, church, you, some of us
[30:45] might think that's ridiculous, but it's
[30:47] not. God had already spared David.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; He should have died for his adultery. He
[30:53] should have died for his murder. So if
[30:55] anybody knew about the mercy of God, if
[30:57] anybody believed in the mercy of God, it
[30:59] was David.
[31:01] Hallelujah. And church, that's what I
[31:03] found. When you've really receive mercy,
[31:05] you can give mercy. You can hope in
[31:08] mercy. When you've really accepted the
[31:10] mercy and the forgiveness of Jesus
[31:12] Christ, then you can pray for it for
[31:14] other people. Hallelujah. Amen.
[31:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory to God. And then
[31:19] church, we can't forget Hezekiah. I'm
[31:21] not going to read it, but remember
[31:22] Hezekiah, he cries out to God. Now, we
[31:25] don't know how long his prayer was, but
[31:26] he turns his face towards the wall after
[31:29] Isaiah gives him, "Thus sayeth the Lord,
[31:31] set your house in order. You're going to
[31:32] die."
[31:35] And he cries out to God. He wrestles
[31:37] with the Lord. Lord, don't you know the
[31:39] integrity of my heart. I've served you
[31:40] with a perfect heart. And God tells him
[31:42] to go back and said, I've heard your
[31:44] prayer. Amen. I've heard your wrestling.
[31:46] Amen. In prayer. And I'm going to grant
[31:48] you, what was it, 15 more years? Was
[31:50] that what it was?
[31:52] Couldn't quite remember if it was 15 or
[31:54] 10. 15. Thank you, brother.
[31:58] So, we can see that there's these uh
[32:01] times to wrestle with the Lord. And
[32:05] I imagine David would probably say that
[32:06] was one of his hardest wrestling
[32:08] matches, you know, like God, please have
[32:10] mercy. It's a little child. I mean, look
[32:11] at our little babies. We got Thank God
[32:12] we got two little babies here tonight.
[32:14] And you know, Vang's baby's getting to
[32:16] be one year old now. You know, not much
[32:18] of a baby anymore. such a sweetheart.
[32:20] But you know, imagine pleading for one
[32:22] of them. God have mercy. Oh Lord, I I'm
[32:25] wrestling with you in prayer. Lord, I
[32:26] know you can do it. You forgave me,
[32:31] but then to come to the wrestling match
[32:32] and you lose that one. God doesn't give
[32:35] you what you want on that one.
[32:38] How how difficult that might be. But
[32:41] again, it's like Job. Now, let's read
[32:43] what Job said. I just want to read this
[32:45] briefly.
[32:50] Now Job recognizes in Job 9:32 and33
[32:53] that there is neither any daysman betw
[32:56] twix us that might lay his hand upon us
[32:59] both. But but Job actually learns God
[33:02] does send some somebody. It's Elahu.
[33:06] God does send an intercessor. Remember
[33:08] Elahu starts picking up on the the the
[33:10] the proof of nature as God's proof of
[33:13] God's existence. He starts hitting into
[33:14] that before God does. Elahu caught the
[33:17] mind of Christ because he was a type of
[33:19] Christ.
[33:21] Now go to Job 13:3. Hun, let's read that
[33:23] one. Surely I was speak to the Almighty
[33:25] and desire to reason with God. In other
[33:27] words, I want to give God reasons why
[33:31] I'm right.
[33:33] So see, he's wrestling. He's wrestling
[33:34] in in this thought life. And what Lord,
[33:36] what could I I just want to talk to you
[33:38] to give you this reason so you'll know
[33:42] what I think. And church, God already
[33:44] knows what he thinks.
[33:47] &gt;&gt; God doesn't need to hear our reasons
[33:49] about why things should be different.
[33:52] God just wants us to obey.
[33:55] To obey is better than what, church?
[33:57] Sacrifice.
[34:00] God would rather have us obey than do
[34:02] some amazing religious sacrifice.
[34:07] So at this point, God didn't want Job to
[34:08] go get, you know, he didn't have any ox
[34:10] sacrifice, but God didn't want that. God
[34:12] wanted him just to obey,
[34:14] just to keep praising God, trusting God.
[34:16] God wanted him just to keep praising and
[34:18] not curse God. And God knew he wouldn't.
[34:23] Stay in chapter 13 22 and 23. Then call
[34:27] thou and I will answer. Or let me speak
[34:29] and answer thou me. How many are mine
[34:32] inquities and sins? Make me to know my
[34:34] transgression and my sin.
[34:38] So he's he's calling out to God. Lord,
[34:40] I'll call and you answer. I want to talk
[34:43] it over with you.
[34:47] Now, look at Job 23 3:4 and 5. Job 23 34
[34:51] and 5. He gets even more uh more
[34:54] serious. Oh, that I knew where I might
[34:57] find him that I might come even to his
[34:59] seat. I would order my cause before him
[35:01] and fill my mouth with arguments,
[35:03] arguing to God
[35:06] about why Job is right and God must have
[35:09] done something wrong. Talk about a
[35:11] wrestling match. Now, this one, he's
[35:13] just wrestling in his mind, right,
[35:14] brother Rody? He's not really wrestling
[35:16] an angel yet, right?
[35:18] He's just in his mind wrestling with I
[35:21] would tell God this. I'd tell brother
[35:23] Jesse that.
[35:26] I'd tell brother Angley that. Right.
[35:28] People got their bad attitudes. I tell
[35:30] brother Random this and that.
[35:33] &gt;&gt; They think they know all about it,
[35:36] right? Think think they got all these
[35:38] arguments, all these reasons why they're
[35:40] right. And most church, most time
[35:42] church, they got that kind of spirit,
[35:43] they're wrong.
[35:45] Because they're trying to pridefully
[35:46] exalt themselves.
[35:49] I would know the words which he would
[35:50] answer me and understand what he would
[35:53] say unto me. Now remember, he's confused
[35:54] during this time. He's saying good
[35:55] things and he's saying wrong things.
[35:57] because he's sleepdeprived and he has
[35:59] five layers of confusion and stress that
[36:03] you and I really know nothing about.
[36:09] Job 31:35. Th this is another time he
[36:12] says it right before God comes down.
[36:15] Job 31:35.
[36:17] Oh, that one would hear me. Behold, my
[36:20] desire is that the Almighty would answer
[36:22] me and that mine and that mine adversary
[36:25] had written a book.
[36:30] Exactly right. Amen, brother Rod. And
[36:32] the church said, "Amen. It's coming. God
[36:35] is going to give him an answer."
[36:38] As we went through it, over 75 total
[36:40] questions, including Aahu's questions
[36:43] and God's. I think Alahu did four or
[36:45] five. God did 70 or 69 or 68.
[36:49] 75 questions. God says, "Who is this?
[36:52] Did you measure the earth? Do you did
[36:54] you lay it on its foundations? Are you
[36:56] the father of rain? Where are the
[36:59] storehouses of hail and snow, Job?"
[37:02] So, see, every time we complain or
[37:04] wrestle with God, God is trying to
[37:06] change our perspective
[37:08] &gt;&gt; to get it off of ourselves
[37:10] and more to a eternal perspective.
[37:20] I think for the sake of the last one,
[37:22] uh,
[37:25] this one just always blessed me. Uh, the
[37:27] Lord Jesus. Let's go to Luke chapter 18.
[37:30] Luke chapter 18.
[37:40] Familiar passage. You know, I don't
[37:42] remember the last time I preached on it,
[37:43] but verse one.
[37:46] the parable of the unjust judge.
[37:49] Now, church, here's where we get into
[37:51] where God wants us to wrestle in prayer.
[37:56] And like brother Cam said, so I so it
[37:58] was just so striking to me like I was
[38:00] like, "Oh my, that's right." So many
[38:02] times, and brother Bam talked about it,
[38:03] remember talks about your sin like a
[38:05] serpent, right? And brother said,
[38:07] "Sometimes that we'll just sit at that
[38:08] serpent and try not to get by, try not
[38:10] to get bitten. We'll just try to stay
[38:12] away from it. And I rebuke you. I rebuke
[38:14] you. And brother man makes a statement,
[38:15] brother Rod. He said, he said, "What you
[38:17] can do though is just walk away from
[38:18] it."
[38:21] In other words, we focus all of our
[38:22] energy on this problem. In other words,
[38:24] just think about it all the time.
[38:29] But brother Cam brought that out. A lot
[38:30] of times we do that. We focus on the
[38:32] problem instead of going to talk to God
[38:34] about it.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; I thought that was a very inspired thing
[38:38] to say because we see Jacob doing it. We
[38:42] didn't have time, but I'm sorry. We saw
[38:44] David do it. We saw Job do it. We didn't
[38:46] have time, but Hannah did it. Abraham
[38:49] did it. He went from 50 down to 10. God,
[38:52] I'm wrestling with you, God. Please,
[38:54] please, God, please hear me one more
[38:56] time. Wrestling for souls.
[39:00] And he spake a parable unto this end
[39:02] that men ought to pray, not to faint. In
[39:04] other words, don't stop pleading your
[39:06] cause with God. That's what I love about
[39:08] Brother Rod. He would plead the blood.
[39:11] It's a wrestling match. God, I need you.
[39:15] God, forgive us. God, have mercy on us.
[39:18] God, we need your your tender kindness.
[39:20] We're not worthy of your mercies. The
[39:23] blood of Jesus wasn't shed out of my
[39:25] works. It was shed by grace to me
[39:28] because my works were evil,
[39:30] &gt;&gt; and I don't deserve it.
[39:35] Saying, there was in a city a judge
[39:36] which feared not God, neither regarded
[39:38] man. And there was a widow in that city,
[39:40] and she came unto him, saying, "Avenge
[39:42] me of mine adversary." And he would not
[39:44] for a while, but afterward he said
[39:46] within himself, "Though I fear not God,
[39:48] nor regard man, yet because this widow
[39:50] troubleeth me, I will avenge her, lest
[39:52] by her continual coming, she weary me."
[39:55] And the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust
[39:57] judge saith. And shall not God avenge
[40:00] his own elect, which cry day and night
[40:02] unto him, though he bear long with them?
[40:06] I tell you that he will avenge them
[40:08] speedily. Nevertheless, when the son of
[40:10] man cometh, shall he find faith on the
[40:12] earth. Let's stand to our feet. Uh
[40:14] musicians can come here.
[40:19] Now, church, one important thing we get
[40:20] out of here is verse seven. They pray
[40:23] day and night.
[40:25] Day and night.
[40:27] Now, nighttime is honestly usually just
[40:29] a time of sleep for me, but there has
[40:31] been times I've woken up and I felt like
[40:33] God wanted me to pray.
[40:36] But Jesus records it. Jesus says there's
[40:38] going to be times to wake up and cry to
[40:41] God during the night. Praise the Lord.
[40:46] And then the whole time the Bible says
[40:48] that God is bearing long. God is bearing
[40:51] with that. God is understanding that.
[40:53] God is seeing all of our wrestling in
[40:55] prayer.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Church, I always think about my dad. How
[40:58] many times in the last
[41:00] 40 some years have I prayed for my dad
[41:02] in tears pleading with God to have mercy
[41:05] on him and save his soul. Deliver him
[41:07] from addictions and uh depression. How
[41:10] many times? But what does the Bible say?
[41:12] God is bearing along with me.
[41:15] God hears me.
[41:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My prayers aren't in vain.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; The time we really cry out to God and
[41:21] really ask God to move, God hears every
[41:24] time.
[41:25] But God's story is what's important.
[41:28] God's story is the right story. Praise
[41:30] God. It's his story. It's history.
[41:34] Praise God.
[41:36] Let's bow our heads for a word of prayer
[41:38] here tonight.
[41:45] Dear Lord, we thank you for another
[41:47] opportunity to be in your presence. Lord
[41:49] God, I want to thank you again for a man
[41:51] like Jacob. Lord God,
[41:53] &gt;&gt; totally unworthy and he knows it. Lord,
[41:56] that's that tells my life story. That
[42:00] tells everyone's life story here.
[42:07] Father, thank you for putting that in
[42:08] the Bible.
[42:10] What a beautiful story. His greatest
[42:13] wrestling match wasn't with the spirit
[42:15] of murder,
[42:18] wasn't with jealousy between his wives.
[42:22] Perhaps
[42:24] it was with God.
[42:27] And Lord, I could see now that was Job's
[42:29] greatest wrestling match. Dear God, why
[42:32] is this happening to me? Why did this
[42:34] happen? What did I do? I want to give my
[42:37] arguments. I want to give my reasons why
[42:39] to God. I want to talk to God.
[42:42] Oh Lord,
[42:46] Lord, your ways are so much higher than
[42:48] our ways.
[42:50] If Job could have seen it, Lord, he
[42:52] would have looked at your ways and he
[42:53] would have seen in heaven you bragging
[42:54] about him. Then he would have felt
[42:56] sorry, which we know he did later. He
[42:58] said, "I abhore myself. I repent in dust
[43:01] and ashes."
[43:03] In other words, I'm not worthy of the
[43:06] least of all thy mercies.
[43:14] Dear Lord,
[43:16] you know what the people go through,
[43:17] Lord God. So I pray, Lord Jesus, for
[43:21] those that need a wrestling match with
[43:23] you, Lord, they really want to change. I
[43:24] pray you would grant it to them, Lord
[43:26] God. Over the years, I've seen it
[43:28] numerous times, people laying at the
[43:31] altar or waiting in the prayer line or
[43:33] and they just wait until pray until.
[43:37] Brother Random called it praying
[43:39] through.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Praying through the waiting process.
[43:44] Praying through the tiredness. Praying
[43:46] through the confusion.
[43:50] Praying through the timer.
[43:53] [Music]
[43:56] Like on the day of Pentecost, the Bible
[43:58] said when it was fully come, 10 days of
[44:00] just waiting, praying through until God
[44:03] moved on the scene.
[44:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[44:06] Lord, it's such a scriptural truth, God,
[44:09] that
[44:11] we just got to get our eyes off the
[44:13] trial and get our eyes on you, Lord God.
[44:15] Oh God, help us to get alone with you,
[44:17] Lord God.
[44:20] Help us, Lord Jesus. I pray
[44:26] [Music]
[44:27] that God, that we're alone with you,
[44:29] Lord, we can really see what's in our
[44:30] heart. You'll speak something truly in
[44:32] our heart, dear God.
[44:34] And you'll give us a change, dear God.
[44:37] Hallelujah.
[44:39] And we'll know we've had a name change.
[44:45] We'll go from fear to powerful,
[44:49] from fearful to powerful. Lord God,
[44:55] Lord Jesus, you did it in an Old
[44:57] Testament form, Lord. We'd say, "How
[44:59] much more can you do it under the blood
[45:01] of Jesus Christ, which has a better
[45:02] covenant, with better promises, Lord
[45:04] God?" Hallelujah.
[45:07] [Music]
[45:10] &gt;&gt; And on this night, Lord, with this
[45:11] assassination, Lord, I kind of in my
[45:13] heart, Lord God, I just want to ask you,
[45:15] Lord, just give me peace, God,
[45:19] and bless that family as they mourn,
[45:21] dear God.
[45:24] protect and provide for his wife and
[45:27] those two children.
[45:29] May those children be raised to love
[45:31] you, Lord God. I saw the video of the
[45:34] daughter running to her daddy a couple
[45:36] weeks ago and she could never do that
[45:37] again. But Lord, may she run to the arms
[45:40] of Christ, dear God. That'd be the
[45:42] greatest
[45:44] the greatest run she could she could
[45:46] have in her lifetime, God.
[45:48] Oh Lord, I think about my children and I
[45:50] think about
[45:52] Lord even these men, these three men
[45:54] that have lost their lives in the last
[45:56] few weeks or months rather.
[45:58] So I pray you'd be with these families,
[46:00] Lord God.
[46:01] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[46:02] &gt;&gt; One in CPPley, Lord, the Mercy's family
[46:05] here, Lord, and the other one there, the
[46:07] Thompson family, God, just be with them,
[46:09] Lord, as they're experiencing something
[46:11] on the same lines, unexpected loss.
[46:16] So, Father, let your spirit comfort the
[46:18] hurting. I pray
[46:25] Lord, thank you, God, that in your
[46:26] mercy, you wrestle with us and you let
[46:29] us prevail. You change our hearts, oh
[46:31] God. You give us our heart's desire,
[46:33] Lord God. We're not worthy of it, yet
[46:35] you grant it to us. Jacob didn't deserve
[46:38] deliverance, but you gave it to him
[46:40] anyway, dear God. Thank you, God, for
[46:41] being such a merciful God.
[46:44] Lord, empower us, Lord, to overcome
[46:47] through your Holy Spirit.
[46:51] Grant it, Lord. I ask this in Jesus
[46:52] Christ's name. And the saints said,
[46:55] "Amen.
