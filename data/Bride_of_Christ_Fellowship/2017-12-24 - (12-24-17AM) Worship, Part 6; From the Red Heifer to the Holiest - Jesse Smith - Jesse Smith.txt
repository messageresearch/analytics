our Bibles this morning by God's grace let's go to numbers chapter 19 like to continue this little series on worship we've been looking at where this gonna be part 6 this is a little message I preached in Iowa last weekend we had a really good response by God's grace I'm trusting to be a blessing to you this morning by the grace of the Lord Numbers chapter 19 we'll just read verses 9 and 10 for the sake of time I know I'm kind of I want to be cautious the time I know people might be going to see their families and so forth afterwards but let's sing a I'm sorry let's read numbers 19 verses 9 and 10 there will be 2nd service though for those who would like to come back this evening by God's grace I'll pride just do a Bible study on Christmas and some of the reasons you know we have certain standards and so forth I just like to review that spend years since I preached that so I was going over the notes yesterday and today and was blessed by the scriptures and the quotes and everything like that I'll be looking at that this evening by the grace of the Lord God is so good to us praise God amen numbers chapter 19 I'd like to take this thought and I'd like to call it the red from the red heifer to the holiest of holies I want look at this thought by God's grace a couple years ago I preached on the red heifer and and as I've been preaching on these other thoughts everything just kind of it all just is making more sense now by God's grace it becomes more clear you know all the types and shadows and Old Testament we see the reality of in the New Testament and so I like to preach on that this morning you know if you're expecting a Christmas message I guess it is a Christmas message in some degree you know but might not be about the wise men and the shepherds and so for like that well I'll tell you one thing it's gonna be about Jesus Christ amen so that's what we're all interested in in the first place numbers 19 9 and 10 for there say men let's read 9 together and I'll read 10 by myself let's just read verse 9 on three one two three and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation it is a purification for sin I'll just read verse 10 and he that gathereth the Astra's of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the even and it shall be unto the children of Israel and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them for a statute forever only thankful for God's Word that's just Bauer has the word of prayer for him and you know in your heart just make it known unto God this morning Heavenly Father God we honor you we worship you we love you we say thank you again Lord we've sung your songs we've given little gifts to the children hallelujah we've given our tithes and offerings Lord we give in our our love offerings to you Lord we come to the time of the preaching of the word or I pray just anoint me to preach your word you had one way Lord God to speak to your people and it was through the lips of men anointed by the Holy Spirit anoint my lips may they not be my thoughts but your thoughts and knowing the ears of the people Lord that they'll be spiritually awake and listening Lord to the Word of God speak to every heart Lord this Christmas Lord we're even more thankful than last Christmas for you sending your son Lord God because it's kept us another year or God and we've grown in grace we've grown a knowledge Lord God and we're stronger this year even than last Oh God we know the enemy comes in stronger each year but Lord you continue to raise up a standard against the enemy and we give you glory for that this morning speak to us to this thy word help us Lord by your whole spear in Jesus Christ name and everybody said amen god bless you praise the Lord and then lady you can switch over to the I got some quotes and pictures I want to show by God's grace if somebody can just remind me after service if other children show up a little late those gifts are for them so just feel free like if I forget at the end of service and people walk in and I see some families that aren't here yet maybe you all can just come up here at the end of service and just take them oh we need to give one too I'm sorry Naomi's children so that we can do I get to do the after service so god bless you sister now we got some no gifts for that your girls up here by God's grace amen so I'd like to look at this thought here this morning this is part six in our worship series from the red heifer to the holiest of holies but I could look at this thought this morning and I believe it types the Lord Jesus Christ very well we're gonna be focusing on at the beginning on the red heifer and remember in our scripture we read the red heifer was important for all Israelites and then for any stranger would be a proselyte to to the Jewish faith we'd say you know like a Rahab you know she was a proselyte she married into the Jewish faith we'd say like a Naomi and a Ruth they married into the Jewish faith now family was I'm sorry know me was already part of it Ruth was married into it by God's grace so no one could join the Jewish faith no one could even come into this the this gate around here you know or the the tent no one could come into tent unless they were sprinkled with the waters of separation from the red heifer so you could only get so close to God you could know you couldn't get as close as you wanted to without the sprinkling of the ashes and the we caught the waters of separation from the red heifer so without this sprinkling this sprinkling was so important you couldn't get to the outer core and without the sprinkling if born in the family of Levi you couldn't get into the holy place and if you were the high priest even the high priest born into it you're of the right of the calling of God as a man and everything and trained up you couldn't get into the holiest of Holies without the sprinkling of the Lords of separation amen how many grateful for the blood of Jesus this morning that's what this all symbolizes everything that in this Old Testament Tabernacle was symbolizing the Lord Jesus Christ they meant so we read our text here and so remember these waters of separation were necessary both for new believers like we said like Ruth and Rahab who were no doubt unclean because they didn't have the knowledge of the word of God that if they contacted anything dead if they came across a dead soldier or if they came across any death and if anything died in their home they were instantly unclean and couldn't worship before God for the experienced believers who contacted dead things that became unclean as soon as you contacted something dead you were unclean that's how that's how much of a curse a death is as soon as you touch it as soon as it was in your house everything everything that had an open vessel was considered unclean and you had to go through the purification laws and so let's look at that let's take your Bibles this morning let's go to numbers chapter 19 there as we read our text let's look at verses one two and three and the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying this is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded saying speak unto the children of Israel that they bring the red heifer without spot where there is no blemish and upon which never came a yoke and ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face you know it's interesting that this called as she and it could still represent Christ the red effort could still represent Christ as his she because she represents a part of the man because remember in the beginning she came out of he praise the Lord Adam had she and he he was she and he she had that he had the she inside of him because in the beginning they were one spirit and God pulled out that feminine part so Christ this is a red heifer she effort she represents the submissive part of God amen God has a masculine part and God has a submissive part and that submissive part was Christ Christ came totally submissive to the will of God that's what the female represents it doesn't mean Jesus was a female Jesus was male we know that but female represents a part of God that's submissive aren't you glad God pig came submissive to his own word God sent his son submissive to his own word to die for us amen and notice it was a red heifer ever had to be completely read there there could be no blemish in the red heifer no spots of white no spots of brown no black spots it had to be totally red and the Prophet tells us from one side to the other everything in the tabernacle types even the water separation the red heifer it couldn't be a brown one it had to be a red run not a spot on it had to be burned and then made into the waters of separation which we'll get to and it's sprinkled the people but after they had sinned and had gone outside the camp how the hyssop and cedar wood and all mixed together how the wood the tabernacle how the brazen altar of the labor the shewbread everything pointed to Christ hey man art so glad everything in the tabernacle pointed to Jesus Christ complete in Jesus Christ now the without spot or blemish first Peter chapter 1 verse 19 I'll just be reading this here if you got your Bible you can turn there this is all typifying the Lord Jesus amen first Peter 1:19 says this but with the precious blood of Christ as a lamb without blemish and without spot amen so we see how the heifer had no spot had no blemish and Jesus Christ was the same way amen there never came a yoke upon Jesus and the Prophet tells us what that means it means the red heifer died which was a type of Christ a member never a yoke on his neck Christ was not yoked with any organization and neither are we gay men we're not linked to any man-made organization the only organism were linked to heaven hallelujah because we are living organism we're not an organization that denominates and builds walls and and sets its bylaws our bylaws were written in the mind of God before the foundation of the world our bylaws are fret or ever settled in heaven amen how do you search his organization's change their bylaws from year to year but God's church never changes bylaws because it's God's forever eternal word see Christ wasn't yoked he wasn't a slave to any organization pharisees sadducees Herodians he wasn't yoked to anything he didn't fool with them at all he wasn't yoked up with all this nothing remember Jesus was crucified outside the camp you had to take this red heifer outside the camp it could not be crucified in the camp of Israel I'm sorry our killer or sacrifice the Christ was crucified and so this is a picture I found online in the days of Solomon you know just here's here's of course that the city and the temple of God and it was Solomon made sure they built this path and made sure the red heifer got far outside because this was going to represent sin and anyone who touched it was going to be unclean the red heifer because this red heifer was becoming their sin and so the Bible said that Jesus was taken without the gate so Jesus was taken outside of the city of Jerusalem and he was crucified outside the camp as well amen as a type and then let's go to our Bible here now back to numbers 19 verse 4 and Eleazar the priest now he would set the throat out there and the Bible said Elias the priest shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkled blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times now this is very important they had to kill the heifer and had to catch the blood in a charger container and then at least had to walk back and he had to take the blood and he had to stand there before the gate there but before entering in the in the outer court and had taken sprinkle seven sprinkles before the gate and this represented the blood of Jesus Christ it represented that there would be blood for all seven Gentile Church ages amen thank god this blood for emphasis and some Myrna and Pergamos and Thyra tira thank god there's blood for Sardis and Philadelphia but you and I should be thankful there was blood sprinkled for Laodicea amen the same blood that was sprinkled for emphasis is sprinkled for us the same way Paul could be forgiven of his blasphemy the same way he was forgiven for his the same blood cleanses you and I from our mistakes amen there's blood there's seven sprinkles of blood for all seven Church ages and the Bible tells us what sprinkling actually represents and so we'll see if we're sprinkled this morning by God's grace 1st Peter 1 verse 2 I'm going to read that this shows if you're sprinkled and and I believe this explains why church means so much to the believer and to those that are unclean Church doesn't mean as much the preaching of the word and prayer and the so forth and ministry the Holy Spirit doesn't mean as much to someone who's unclean but it means the world to those who are clean hey don't worry 1st Peter 1 verse 2 elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the Spirit that's the purification of the spirit unto obedience and what's that next word sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied so what does this sprinkling represent the sprinkling represents that the holy spirit has anointed you and you're obeying the Word of God and you've been purified by the Holy Spirit amen see because it's sprinkling unto obedience so someone who's obeying the word of God they're walking clean by the Holy Spirit amen but someone who's walking in uncleanness they're disobeying the Word of God and so we'll see the the repercussions for that and they're awful the repercussions of disobeying even one word of God is awful how many understand that Jesus said we must live by every word that proceeds out the mouth of God so there's blood force at all seven Church ages thank God for that Hebrews 13 20 and 21 I'm going to read that briefly so we have to understanding the Bible cause this the blood of the everlasting covenant now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the ever lasting covenant amen verse 21 make you perfect in every good work to do his will working in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through Jesus Christ to whom be glory for ever and ever Church when we see God cleaning out our lives purging our lives purging our homes purging our phones purging our tablets when we see God purging our lives we could rejoice in saying the blood of Jesus is working with me the blood of Jesus is helping me do the will of God now that's where people who obey the Holy Spirit if they don't obey the Holy Spirit then they're unclean in the eyes of God but see for those of us who are letting this blood of the everlasting covenant wash out our lives we can rejoice because God's working with us amen Oh hallelujah and it lasts for every age because the Bible said it's the blood of the everlasting covenant now Hebrews 10:10 says that this is the sacrifice once and for all and so the red heifer you know was a sacrifice and this would last a long time I'm gonna I'm have to I'll get to that in just a moment but let me go back we already looked at numbers 19 for there's blood even four-layer tasya now these seven sprinklings represent the seven spirits of God which are before the throne of God if you know the scripture the Bible said on the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God just as Eleazer had a sprinkle at seven times the blood represents the life and we know that blood represents the life and life represents the only real life there is is the life of God hey man the Holy Spirit so that sprinkling of seven times the blood represent the life of God there will be Holy Spirit anointing for you and I for every age in this hour now let's go to verse 5 numbers 19 verse 5 you got your Bibles after Eliezer would sit the throw and sprinkle the blood after the sprinkling came burning then mixing then cleansing so numbers 19 five and one shall burn the heifer in her sight her skin and her flesh and her blood and her dung shall he burnt see everything about this heifer became sinful just like the Bible said all the sins of all humanity all her iniquities were placed upon him every part three persons were placed upon our Lord Jesus verse six and the priests shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast in the midst of the burning of the heifer so three things had to be added this sacrifice verse 7 then the priest shall wash his clothes and he shall bathe his flesh in water and afterward he shall come into the camp and the priest shall be unclean until the even so this sacrifice was unclean and it made even the priests unclean for the rest of the day verse 9 and a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer so the priests couldn't even do it himself he was already unclean by contacting this heifer but it had to have another clean man to gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up without the camp in a clean place and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water separation it is a purification of sin amen now I want you to if you got your Bible handy there I just want to make sure I read the scripture here where he talks about mixing let's go to verse 20 I'm sorry verse 17 as we go look at verse 17 so they'd have these this pile of ashes and they had to be put in a clean place but they couldn't be sprinkled yet until you add the water so it took the death of the sacrifice plus the running water and you mix that together now you've got something you can spring with praise God verse 17 and for unclean person they shall take up the ashes of the burn heifer a purification for sin and running water she'll be put there unto into a vessel Amen now if you go back to verse 9 the Bible said that it shall be kept for the congregation of Israel for a water of separation it's a purification for sin now one thing I read I read it in a commentary said that this waters the separation now when you got the ashes mixed with the water and you've mixed it up this water they said will last from 300 to 400 years and it was showing that the sacrifice would never lose its power during your lifetime it would extend generations truth we see in Jesus Christ his blood never loses its power the Holy Spirit will never lose its power people say well I can't have more children because or I don't want to have any children because it just gets more wicked and wicked all the time but remember the same blood that cleansed you will be available to the cleanse your children and if God tells your grandchildren and if God Terry's law your great-grandchildren amen lose its power amen it would be kept up and see the blood of Jesus Christ is not cut up by a man that might lose it or spot it's kept up by heaven itself amen hallelujah Jesus sits on the right hand of the Majesty on high and he ever liveth to make intercession by his blood for you and I hallelujah and he can say to the utmost this morning hey man you might think his blood might be and not be able to reach someone but if you believe and if you trust in God the Bible said beat only you according to your faith amen did not lose its power that a blood of Jesus Christ now the Prophet says this he tells us here this scarlet hid something it was put together and burnt which meant the dispensation of grace justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost so he saw those three things that had to be added in the fire and it was showing that it was going to take three stages really take effect upon the believer amen it's going to take justification you're saved you're forgiven sanctification your daily habits and your daily words and your house is cleaned out you got all the trash out of your house and now the baptism of the Holy Ghost can come upon you amen because the token cannot be required until all the leaven is out of the house they men oh that's exactly right glory now let's go to numbers 1911 he didn't have to part me I'm a little excited after last weekend seeing the Holy Spirit move like that I'm just a little excited this week by God's grace of bear with me oh we just had a glorious time it was just so tremendous to see the Holy Spirit minister numbers 1911 he now here's where he goes the main thought I've worked with last weekend he that touches the dead body of any man should be unclean seven days he shall purify himself with it on the third day and on the seventh day he should be clean but if he purified not himself the third day then the seventh day he should not be clean I look at this you had to follow God's Word to the tea if you want to be clean praise the Lord and God gave you a little encouragement God said if you can make it to the third day I'll sprinkle you a third day and if you made it to the third day I'll give you enough grace to make it to the seven day amen God gave a little break you know I was telling people that were repenting in tears at the altar I said if you can make it to Wednesday and not give in to that pornography or not give in to that movie lustful spirit you have watching movies or these other custom spirits if you can make it to Wednesday God will give you another anointing and sprinkling amen that's right and some of you know if you had addictions it's so hard to get to the next day but with the blood of Jesus Christ all things are possible to them that believe amen it'll never lose its power amen that's exactly right so he says if you make it the third day I'll sprinkle on noise I'll give you a fresh anointing so you can make it for the rest of the week and then you can be clean Eileen oh yeah I love it my the word of god is so beautiful whoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead and purified not himself he defiles that NACO of the Lord see you see how this is important if someone doesn't come to church prayed up and asking forgiveness and obeying the Word of God it actually defiles the whole church the Holy Spirit can't move when someone doesn't get sprinkled by the blood of Jesus and obey the Word of God it hurts the whole church that's what we look at here because the waters the separation was not sprinkled upon him he should be unclean his uncleanness is yet upon him glory now here's what I said today now this is a beautiful type you were cut off from the congregation if you were unclean they would not let you into the outer court how many could say amen to that you're cut off and this is like today people are cut off from the spiritual effects of the Holy Ghost in worship why they cut off the Bible said they become dull of hearing due to their hard hearts because they grieve the Holy Spirit they do things that the Holy Spirit says not to do they get in contact with dead things with sin they contact dead sin they don't repent of the sin they keep living in sin and no wonder no wonder the effects of no wonder they can fall in love with God anymore they're not even allowed spiritually to come close to God because God they've grieved the holy spirit away from them and they cannot enjoy the effects of God's Spirit we should all desire to it what more of God's Spirit we should all want to be so clean before God that the word of God means more to us every day amen they cannot experience the joy of true worship because they're cut off due to their sin that's why worship doesn't mean anything they could come to church and eat and they're there they're not impacted it's because God spiritually does not let them come in because they've sinned and they know better and they're cut off from the effects of the Holy Spirit how many can say amen to that they've grieved the Holy Spirit where now they're cut off and they just like Abraham just like Abraham and Peter Abraham never got back to worshiping God until he repented from going to Egypt and he had to come right back to the alter where he left God and so are you and I we have to come back to the same spot where we sinned and let's God we've got to come back right there and repent of our sins and say God bring back the fellowship bring back the love bring back the power bring back the joy we've got to repent and be sprinkled and come back to Christ amen it's exactly right that's why they don't enjoy church because they're cut off from it and this is what I preached last week they contact dead things and then if you look at numbers 19 now the death comes in their home and I preached on TVs movie smartphones bedroom wallet church attendance and I'm gonna preach on that again this morning because I I have to look at verse 14 numbers 1914 this is the law when a man dies in a tent all that come into the tent and all that is in the tent shall be unclean seven days think about if somebody let's a let's say how a man lets in a little evil movie into his home and let's that lets the death of that evil movie with custon and maybe a morally dressed women he lets that spread out in his home this and without repenting of that that that death lays there in the house and it impacts the whole home how about a sister that'll wear sexy closer and or bring some clothes and she to the house she shouldn't wear and that's like death that's like a sin that's coming to the home and it defiles the whole home how about your children they see something they shouldn't see out there in the world right and they come in and they start saying some of the things they heard Karen if not repented of that sin that death affects the entire home how many can understand that that's exactly right and every open vessel was unclean because the effects of sin and your and you and I are our minds are always open vessels right Satan can't get into your soul thank God amen how do you know thank God your soul sealed to the knavery redemption but your mind isn't open that song right your eyes whatever comes in your eyes and never goes through your ears if it's sin it'll torment a real believer is that that's right that's exactly right if you see sin and you're a Christian it will torment you until you confess it and get it out of your home and the church said Amen that's exactly right see death in the home caused everything in the home to be unclean and then the Bible said that to get hissed up and come sprinkle the house sprinkle the tent hallelujah when we watch the wrong thing or something it goes wrong in our phones or whatever more if we don't ask God to cleanse us what happens it becomes dead it becomes unclean we don't want to be unclean we want to be clean amen we don't want death to infest our home we want life to flow into our home amen we let the love of Christ to throw into our home not sin and compromise and unbelief that's the script that's the scripture look at it says unclean seven-eighths verse 15 and every open vessel which hath no covering bound upon it is unclean thank God your soul is covered I'll hear your seal to the day of your Redemption amen no I preached pretty hard on some of these things and I got people weeping and repenting at the altar for every one of these I preached so I know it was God I know it was God because God doesn't want to try to I confession well I'm sorry I I stole this I'm sorry I was thinking those God wants somebody that's really dead to themselves praise God that's the only way you're gonna get any victory we've all tried it you know half-hearted confessions or we got caught we're sorry well you're sorry you got cause you're not sorry that you're doing it you got sorry you're caught and we got to be sorry we did it and died to that and get clean in our house amen get clean in our home now I just started with some of these I started with ties the reason people don't pay ties is because they fear the bank more than they fear God and that scriptures this is a faith issue if someone doesn't pay their tithes and offerings there are weak in faith some dead thought about being fearful about the mortgage or the bank or groceries or whatever more whatever cost and car payment you name it some dead thought has centered in God's not going to take care of you God's not gonna take care of you better not pay your tithes and offerings and we just saying Jehovah Jireh my provider he's more than enough for me boy because the Bible says when you don't pay your tithe the reason you pay your tithes and offering is because you want to learn how to fear God when you don't pay your tithes and offerings you fear man more than you fear God and you'll never get over that until you repent and start paying God your tithes and offerings when I preach that so hard I do people coming up we've been and crying about paying ties it was quite it was quite the leadership of the Holy Spirit church attendance the Bible literally says we must gather more as you see the Day approaching and I'm not talking about just loose fellowship I'm talking about fellowship under the Holy Spirit now if you have fellowship at your house is not a church time and people are praying and I'm sorry not praying but just maybe singing and glorifying God that might count it might be if there's a real sweet spirit there but if it's just gathering and not really with the sincerity the Holy Spirit then we're not fulfilling the scripture we must fulfill the scripture hebrews 10:25 says we do not forsake this something of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much the more as you see the Day approaching commands we have to gather mores you see that Day approaching now my plan for the file that was to have a Sunday night service every week every week that I possibly can that helps me ensure that I'm gathering with the Saints more all the time but to break this command the idea here I don't need to be with the Saints and I've heard enough word or I don't need to really study my Bible anymore that's a thought of death and when death enters in the house the family a person is unclean and then he'd sprinkled with the blood of Jesus to correct that thought and I'll preach all movies and I numerous people crying about movies and the last week Star Wars came out so just on my mind you know I was rebuking Star Wars I said they'll go to Star Wars and they'll watch murders and say yeah that's what they're doing now on cleaning the eyes of God the man or woman that will kiss what is that that's fornication they'll say oh this person fell in love shame on anybody that would pay money for Satan to pour down sin down their throats shame on anybody that would do that and I told that this got inspired you and I said these people that love these new movies and so forth I don't even care if it's the older one the older one were just bad because I watched him as a child and one of the women they dressed up in a bikini even in the 70s you know and cussin there was cussing on theirs murders on there that thing's unclean the eyes of God I tell you if they love their Star Wars they're going to get their Star Wars at the Battle of Armageddon because the Saints are going to come back riding on white horses and the Bible said the seed of Abraham are like the stars of heaven amen and they're going to be fighting Jesus Christ and all the saints on white horses and they're going to have a star wars the Stars have they're gonna judge them they're in the Battle of Armageddon it's exactly right and the church said don't let this dead stuff get in your family don't let these dead things get inside your tent or your life because it'll corrupt your life it'll cut you off from the blessings of God you will hunger for the things of God anymore you know I was I was up I was just flipping through Facebook I forget Saturday morning or Friday morning you know I like to update and write some comments on there on people stuff I just try to quickly flip through there but well some of our friends from another community said oh we went to the meeting last night the the Christmas fellowship and I'm not trying to be critical but but just let me give you an example I I thought well I like to hear what that preacher said last night you know I was I was kind of on the drive to over here I was coming here early like at 6:00 in the morning and I thought well just listen to that was I you know so I got my headphones on and I listened to the message and the preacher starts off by saying well you have to forgive me I'm a little tired he said I was at the Star Wars movie till 3:30 a.m. last night and it just struck me like I just preached on that and your men of supposed men of God are sacrificing for the sake of Star Wars and here's a sermon you know it was just a very milky sermon on church I'm not trying to be critical to anybody understand but it was just like you know Jesus is the light we need to be light Jesus hope we need to be hope but what about the light to shine into the darkness of your heart that loves cussing and expose the the darkness in your heart that loves murder what about the light of Christ for that does everyone understand well this is the idea these are the these are the milky ideas that go out about Christmas well you're the light you need to have hope and that's true but the only way we'll really be light is to be clean amen to have our lamps from the glitter then we can shot in the line of Jesus Christ the right way Oh hallelujah thank you Jesus and so it was tremendous we probably saw ten people on Saturday night come up weeping a couple guys got the Holy Ghost it was tremendous it was fantastic the move of the Holy Spirit that Sunday morning about ten or more people come up for prayer and just on these things about the home one young man just had a baby starting his family I remember him he's a little boy I preached out in Iowa back in 2000 would have been 8 or 9 he said brace weep and he just cried to say brother Jesse he said pray for me that I'll clean out my house I've got a child now and I don't want this child to see all the sins I've let in the house and he hugged me and said I love when you preach brother Jesse I said what ain't me because I'm no preacher Jesus is the only preacher but it so encouraged me to see a young man who's seen who seen my ministry through the years and heard the preaching of the word that it could so prick his heart he's a new father so he's got this new zeal god help us some of us older fathers to have the same zeal to clean out our homes feed on our music that we listen to to make sure our lives are pure and sprinkled with the blood of Jesus Christ unto obedience where we obey the word not just say well that's just his opinion but if it's the Word of God it's God's opinion then it should be you and I own opinion amen that's exactly right now I'm almost done with this part on numbers 19 in verse 16 it says if you touch somebody that's slain or touch a dead body or a bone or grave you're unclean I don't know how that worked about with Elijah's bones I'm not sure how that worked but there's something some mystery in there I'd ask the Holy Spirit to reveal it's cuz they were unclean but yet when the dead man fell on the lashes bones he come back to life I don't understand that but that's the scripture and then in verses 17 to 19 cleansing being fully cleanse was having the ashes mixed with the running water and then sprinkled by the blood of the red heifer and I remember that represent the obedience to the Holy Spirit Oh bang what the the life of God the Holy Spirit and now there's a warning in verse 22 the man who will not purify himself that's I'm gonna read it but the man that shall be unclean and shall not purify himself that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation see God doesn't play around with sin if you're gonna enjoy sin and disobey the word of God God's gonna cut you off and you won't enjoy the blessings of God anymore you have to suffer in your disobedience because he had to fight like he defiled the sanctuary of the Lord the water separation not been sprinkled upon him he's unclean because he chose to be unclean so see God gives us two warnings in that chapter and that's where the Amen where it came a reality to me I thought mine now I understand this now I understand why we got to obey every little thing because it's a fresh sprinkling it's a fresh blinkin that keeps us clean so that when we come to the house of God we can enjoy the house of God amen see if you were clean you could worship in spirit before your God if you're unclean you couldn't even get into the outer court does every understand that alright let's look at the outer court then someone that's freshly sprinkled can now get in now or is open and Jesus said I am the door Gouri see you've got to get a sprinkle first whether you're new proselyte or whether you're an experienced believer before you come in you can't come in on clean to church you should have come in here in your sins hallelujah when you know you've treats your husband wrong or your wife wrong or you know you mistreat your children or you know you to this dirty deal you shouldn't have done or you looked at something or listen to something you should not have done you should have come into church dirty you should come into church clean amen ask God to forgive you get clean get well so that the Holy Spirit will welcome you into the service and you can enjoy the Word of God that's why so many people I'm just convinced don't enjoy the Word of God because they're living in uncleanness and they they can't get any Word of God other than things they say well the Lord told me I could do this or the Lord told me I could do that and it's outside the Word of God that's a complete evidence that you're not hearing the Word of God if your leadership goes against the Word of God exactly right and Wednesday we looked at this a little bit briefly so form I will be by here Wednesday or livestream this will be a little bit of review for you the first article is a bracelet altar than the Laver and then the holy place so the first thing they had to happen was death so once they got to God's house something had to die praise the Lord when you come here Church something has to die if it's your first time in church then you recognize yes Christ as my sacrifice he died for me if you're an experienced then the Bible said you become the living sacrifice you've got to lay yourself on God's altar and say God help me to die daily help me not to think my thoughts help me to believe your word help your word to speak to my life yes sir and so first this is the first thing death you had to die to self and I said this on Wednesday how many people really come here to die how many people come with the motivation Oh God's gonna speak something to change my life today how many people really die I'm willing to leave this behind because I love God so much how many people come to service like that it would help this church if you did if not the entire sanctuary the entire congregation can be defiled if we don't make sure we come here clean and then die out to all will so that God's will can be done amen now I'm just looking at the burnt offering you know there was many kinds there's five different kinds of offering but just with the burnt offering from Leviticus chapter one first death came they set the throat of the burnt offering then there to sprinkle the blood at the altar of the brazen altar next was washing the inwards because this was going to be a burnt sacrifice and I I so enjoyed that from Wednesday after you die God wants to wash her inward parts God wants to wash your emotions out how many thankful for that he want some washed out your ideas about this person that person he wants to wash you out hallelujah and he cuts that sacrifice and he rightly divides it he places it upon God's brazen altar just the way God likes it we could use some washing of our inward thoughts couldn't we our little secrets that we hide that we wish we could say out loud well the sinful part of us wish we could say out loud we should talk to God and say wash me from the inside out cut me with your word wash me and let me be a living sacrifice before God say Amen glory now next you would come to the Laver to do the washing now this is if you're washing the sacrifices I'll say the burnt offering did you know the Laver was made from the looking-glasses of women did you know that in the Bible they took the mirrors that the Israelite women had they took the mirrors and they must have melted that down and then they made this Laver so the laborer had reflective properties and you can read that in exodus 38 so when the priest would go before the Laver to wash they would see themselves in the water the Bible says be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving your own selves I wonder how many people come to church they see the Word of God and they see themselves either obeying or disobey but how many people we are warned not to be just hearers only we should say well this is what the word says and then I'm going to forget all about the word the rest of the week we should take this sermon at least to Monday morning you should take this sermon at least a Monday or Tuesday right don't forget what the Holy Spirit's saying what is so important you're going to replace what the Holy Spirit said and replace what the Holy Spirit said was something else from the world oh the new tax bill oh yeah I get a thousand more dollars or six hundred will Whitley do what are you going to do with that you're gonna give the donate to the kingdom of God or do something for it'll help the poor we're gonna spend it upon your lusts you see all the Willis focus we must see the Word of God we must go to the waters of the word and see our reflection of the word and remember what we're supposed to be by the Word of God if anybody hear the word and not a doer he's like a man that beholds his natural face in a glass or meal that literally means mirror in the Greek for he beholdeth himself and goeth his way and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was forgetteth what a bride of Christ member ought to live like he forgets what a real Holy Ghost feel Christian should live like he forgets the word and he doesn't obey the word Oh hallelujah but whoso looketh in the perfect law of Liberty and continued there and he being not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work this man shall be blessed in his deed how many want to be blessed then you have to hear the word and you have to let the word mean something to you see but if you're in sin and you haven't confessed your sin you can't even get into the outer court you can't even enjoy the blessings of being a real sacrifice for God aren't you glad you can be a sacrifice for God amen and you can come to church knowing I'm clean I've done I've done the will of God I'm remembering where I'm supposed to be I'm supposed to be a Holy Ghost on fire st. going the rapture and I should be an example and everybody you can come to church that way man but it's your choice you got to be clean also at this labour the priest had to wash their hands and feet at the labor that they wouldn't die because once they cut it you know once they washed it cut the sacrifice they had to wash their hands because they had more work they had to do and how many want to clean how many want clean hands and and how many want to touch the right things and how many want to walk in the commands of God well first you got to be clean by the waters of separation then you got to come and make yourself a living sacrifice and you gotta let the Word of God wash you not forget it and now you can go a little deeper in Christ that's why people don't mean nothing to him because they're not founding the pattern of God's Word how many want to follow the pattern of God's Word everywhere not just some words every word of God as we said on Wednesday you're getting closer to God and I'm gonna get a little deeper now this is going to go back now to the church ages a little bit I want to get a little deeper here and I got I'll set the timer give me 15 minutes by God's grace now the next thing the first thing you would see when you walk in if you're a priest and you're bringing the sacrifice you pull back the curd the first thing you would see is the light of the menorah or the golden candlestick and now just so you know remember the Bible said recall the people had to bring oil for the light so not only did you have to be clean bring a sacrifice you've got to be packin oil with you to church I know you hey men or else the priests were not responsible for bringing oil the people had to bring the oil the people had to bring the Holy Ghost with them amen I won't be came with you this morning cuz I know he came with me if you don't bring him there's no light no light is going to shine into the holy place of people's lives if we don't bring the OTR and the anointing how many raise your hands say it's easy to forget some of these brother Jesse honey would say that it's easy we forget we get caught up in life we get tired busy worn out we I get tired we all get tired we need a reminder that this is how we must come to the house of God this is true worship now say like this the true worshipers will bring oil to the house of God the true worshipers because they worship in the oil and truth the spirit and truth they were true worshipers always bring an anointing the house of God now I'm gonna skip some of these here I just had some extra quotes on you I want to skip right down to this part right here I read this on Wednesday - I'm gonna read again for the sake of the church this is the introduction to seven church ages and remember that that menorah represented the seven church ages to the Gentiles and the Prophet said this he said Revelation chapters one through three its main theme as the setting forth of a detailed study of the seven church ages this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of Revelation so you have to understand the menorah before you can move on deeper in the book of Revelation that's what's first just like holy place you walk-in menorah first because out of the ages come the seals and how the seals come in trumpets the trumpets come the vowels like the first verse of a roman candle the church age has come for with the mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light you understand that you and I are not going to understand Revelation until we first have the real understanding of the light of the seven church ages when I can understand the six seven seals Rock understand the trumpets the lows the vials the marriage supper the land we honor we we won't understand the millennium we will understand any of that unless we first see the light of the seven golden candlesticks aren't you glad you see the light amen I'm so thankful for it but once the brilliance of the seven church age is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole of the revelation opens wide before our wandering eyes and we being edified and purified by its Spirit are made ready for his glorious appearing even our Lord and Savior the one true God Jesus Christ I mean how many want to grow in grace but growing Gracie we should grow and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ him be glory both now and forever amen he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son now I said I'm going to close I'm gonna go down to this in the golden candlestick the Prophet said every believer is dramatically depicted in the seven golden candlesticks the Prophet starts by showing how the candlesticks representing the messengers but he said every believer is represented in the seven golden candlesticks he said denominations which our man directed cannot be born of God for his spirit not man that gives life like I told you a while ago my mom is in the Assemblies of God denomination and last year I think was about I don't matter what time of the year it was it was this year I'm sorry I just mean like last spring or less I was pree Shawn you know a priest on the mark of the beast and everything and I was weeping I was saying God please let me talk to my mother about the mark of the beast and God sent my wife or my mother to my house one week later God answers prayer Church in this denomination Assemblies of God which I'm very grateful for the things I learned I was raised in some ways of God I was glad I was there compared to other churches I was thankful but God has given more light since then and so I got to talk to my mom I said mom I looked in the face I said mom is your denomination growing closer to things of God or are they falling away and she didn't even hesitate she said they were falling away and her way to say that was she said we go to the youth conferences now where they invited all the youth in there and she said it's like a rock concert and if you listen to some of these songs they sing the name Jesus isn't even in the song I mean it used to be just rock and roll music with the name of Jesus well now they just take the name of Jesus out it's just like God or you it's like your love is you you're great you know you're great but we need the name of Jesus demons tremble at the name of Jesus when it's spoken in faith because the sons of sceva were saying I journey by Jesus but they didn't have the faith Jesus had a man so they said we know Paul we know Jesus but we don't know you because your faith isn't in that name we need we need faith in his name and we need love in his name we need grace in his name we need the name of Jesus hallelujah so I looked at her right I said mom you got to be careful because it's thus saith the Lord mom every denomination will take the mark of the beast everyone because they've already grieved the Holy Spirit they've drawn their lines and they've drawn their bylaws and they can't move beyond that now you and I gotta make sure we don't draw our own imaginary lines well I only ever believe this or I could never really do this for God I could never really believe that we have to believe for rapture we should be believing for our tooth healing hello Church we should be believing for the saving of our loved ones the man said how are we gonna have faith for a body change when we can effe for two things we need faith for everything amen but we got to be clean we got to be clean to see my mom even tells me that that this denomination is getting further from Christ every denomination does the proper said how thrilling it is to think of those seven lamps drawing life and light from the resources of the main bulb because they had their wick dipped in I love this each church age messenger is depicted here his life is on fire of the Holy Ghost mmm glory his wick or life has been immersed in Christ that's what it is my life has baptized in the Christ I've been immersed in the Christ my life has been totally covered in Christ Oh glory through that wick he's drawing the very life of Christ and by it gives out the light to the church what kind of light is he giving the very same light that was in the first lamp that was lit and right on down the ages to the present time of the last day messenger the same life and the same light is manifested by a life that is hid with Christ in God hey man I was glad to see this light shine last week in Iowa Omaha the light was shining exposed to all those dark sins like I told you I had women and men both confessed pornography women and men I had people confess all this in their homes all the movies they're watching are there's other sins I don't just want to share I already shared some really awful ones but see when the light of God shines when your life is on fire the Holy Ghost it exposes sin amen and people don't if they're in sin they don't want to be around you because your life exposes their darkness light always manifest darkness Amen hallelujah we're to expose the sin we're to expose the darkness and be the light of the world now here I'm trying to close here I got six minutes now not only can we speak thus of the messengers but every true believer is the mat dramatically depicted here at the candle stacks and candle sticks sorry every belief his brother vain that means my wife I guess aren't naming everybody they're all drawing from the same source they've all been dipped in the same Bowl they're all dead to themselves and their lives are hid with Christ in God they're sealed in by the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby you're seen on the day of your Redemption no man can pluck them out of his hand their lives cannot be tampered with amen you make sure you tell the devil that next time he tries to tamper with your life you say you might think you're tampering with my life put me in a hospital but you're not tampering with my life right brother Jose you're not you can't tamper with my life because my life is in Christ's hands amen that's exactly right the visible life is burning and shining giving light in manifestations of the Holy Ghost the inner invisible life is hidden in God and fed by the Lord's word a brother sent me a text after satellite service he said might I'll never be the same after that he said that message was monumental and again I had to say it wasn't me it was Jesus Christ Jesus Christ is the only one that can change your life this morning how long how many one in the change your life you got to be willing to accept the word whatever the world says let it sprinkle you how do you obey the Word of God let it cleanse you how do they hide nothing from God that's the only way to get anywhere with God if you are deadness on you there's no way to get even to the outer core and feel like you're saved amen you can't even feel justified until you obey the word and put the word first in every area of your lives hallelujah that's the Word of God Satan cannot touch them glory not even death can touch them for death has lost its sting the grave has lost his victory thanks be unto God they have this victory in and through the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen how many see your life dramatically depicted how many see this as a drama of your life right here you ought to if not you have the wrong thought about the candlestick well I just see you know brother Branham and Saint Paul and I rainiest and Martin then you got the wrong idea that's right it's okay to think that but you need to see the drama of your life how do you understand what I'm talking about you need to see your life my life is a wick my life is the wick dipped into this oil and I'm all the way dipped down brother amen down into the oil I mom dipped all the way down my life my wick is hidden Christ when God looks at me he sees me hidden in the oil he sees me hidden in Christ haha dory now I brought this up and I'm closing with this well I don't maybe I got three minutes so maybe I won't this is the glory of the church ages your whole life is like this you go through this in your entire life when you first come to God you have to make sure you keep your first love how many people have left their first love and they don't do the same things they did when they first got saved that shows they're unclean you have to keep your first love that first desire to want to serve God and you have to the first works if you love to used to love come early to pray and you don't do anymore that's why you're not feeling close to God because you're not doing the first works you used to do it's a scriptural principle your life is a drama and this is the drama of your life you have to keep your first love and you can't let the deeds or lies of the Nicolaitans member just just a lie first a little white lie oh it's okay not to this or it's okay to do this it's okay to watch this it's okay to not do this it's okay like we said all those sins earlier it's okay and see that devil starts getting the people's lives it makes them unclean does everyone understand what I'm talking about this plays out in all of our lives our lives are dramatically depicted right here and then we must see if people don't get this right they'll fall then false brother in the church will deceive them and they'll have little cliques in the church right where they now but not just one person can send both persons can sin it's the false brethren and then they're then they get scared of suffering in trials and then they actually get then that finally becomes in the doctor they start believing false doctrine and they disagree with the doctrine of the church that right says O'Connor you've seen this haven't you yeah you can say man you were telling me about it earlier down there from Florida and if they keep going they'll get seduced by the Jezebel which is the Roman Catholic Church we say the Protestant denominations they get seduced by denominational thinking and then they become a dead religion they have a name that they live they say they're Christians they say they're Master believers but they're dead there's no life in them than they are displeasing works their works don't glorify God their garments are defiled they're spiritually not clean like we said unclean and they get deceived relying church members they become lukewarm which is the worst condition to be is lukewarm in your works sometimes I serve God but sometimes I just got to enjoy some sin that is the worst life to possibly live and to prove it Jesus gives the most bitter denunciation for people that are lukewarm because you're lukewarm you're not even speaking for them anymore I'm spewing you out of my mouth you can't speak for God anymore and then this is the attitude at the end people's lives well I don't need more of God I've got riches I've got goods I got everything I need I don't need more of God I don't the surrender unto sacrifice more for God and they don't even realize it but the white horse rider red horse rider black horse rider and pale horse just wrote into their lives they don't even realize it and the church said your life is dramatically depicted right here never understand why this is so important you everybody see this from the red heifer all the way to the hose we're not even to the holiest yet the people's lives don't line up with the word of God then then they can't even move on to the next step which is the table of shewbread and we preach this on Wednesday night those 12 pieces represent the 12 mysteries of God I have quotes for brother Graham said the shewbread are the mysteries of God he didn't name them but he said the shewbread are hard the mysteries of God and there's 12 mysteries in the Bible that are called Bible mysteries in the New Testament how many understand that I always wondered why are there 12 mysteries and Simon come and preached here on it and he preached on the 12 loaves of shewbread and just struck me I'll sit right back there my brother John or brother Malachi and it just struck me and I just about jumped in my seats and there it is Holly nearly now I know why there's 12 12 represents the 12 mysteries of God it represents government it represents nation a nation of people it represents the food that we feast on the 12 mysteries of God but we're not done yet are we you're still not in the holiest of Holies where you can hear the thus saith the LORD how many want to hear thus saith the Lord when I come to church I want to hear thus saith the Lord well how am I going to hear though saith the Lord when I'm unclean way out here outside of the tabernacle and I'm not even living all the word that I know I should live how in the world am I going to get so close why go through all these acts I'm a sacrifice all these things I see the light my life lines up with the church ages I'm feasting on the bread and now the next step is prayer how in the world and I can hear the state the Lord how am I gonna meet with God from his very mercy seat when I'm living unclean outside the camp of God spiritually speaking right because anybody can come to church and just because they come to church doesn't mean they're right with God that's exactly right it's those people that hear the word of God and do the Word of God those are the ones that are right with God everyone understand what I'm talking about so those are the 12 mysteries there's 12 loaves of shewbread I'm glad we get the feast on those all the time brother brother bang from time to time the Holy Spirit will lead us back into these I preach a message or a series on the rapture a couple years ago the Holy Ghost I preached 17 sermons on that last year oh I just I just enjoy feasting on the oh that's you've read my it's delicious now as I close I say into our feet we have to have a burden see every Christian dot every Christian is never satisfied they always want more of God the lukewarm attitude is I got enough for that I've got enough you can't tell me preacher you can't tell me anything about God that's the lukewarm attitude and listen it's not me trying to tell you about God its Christ I'm trying to tell you about God it's the Holy Spirit trying to tell about the word of God see we've got to have a burden to labor to enter into go past that shewbread now to the altar of incense I've been studying a lot on the altar of incense but the Bible said let us labor therefore to enter into that rest we've got a we got a labor we've got to crucify this flesh and the desires of it we got a sacrifice for God that this is what this tabernacle was all about it was all about sacrifice if we want to get closer with God we must be able to sacrifice for God we cannot get placed and say I've got enough of God I just come to church on Sunday morning that's good or just come on Sunday night or just come on Wednesday that's not enough we got a sacrifice and we got a labor and give God more of our lives because there's more to the tabernacle than the candlesticks and shewbread that's beautiful we need our lights to shine we need to see our lives dramatically as a candlestick then we need to eat the bread but remember the Bible said you can understand all the mysteries and still be nothing in other words you can make it all the way into sanctification and feasts to hum that those loaves of bread but if you don't get in the holiest of holies you're not where you need to be yet and so by God's grace next now not next week I'm out next week in North Carolina but Lord willing I'll be right it down Lord willing the following Sunday I'll try to preach on the altar of incense there's a lot of good things a couple weeks ago I showed I preached us in Iowa - there's three scriptures that say we need to come praying before we come to service you got to come praying before we here thus saith the Lord we have to pray those are three witnesses we preach on that so we'll begin Lord willing we'll begin 2018 looking at the altar of incense because after you received all the all the bread after you enjoy those mysteries after you see your life as a dramatic representation the Holy Spirit then the way to get in to hear God's voice is through prayer and that's the one thing we never do enough of right that's the one thing we can never do too much of is pray how many appreciate the Word of God this morning but America if you'll just come to the piano won't you just play that slow song take me into the Holies of Holies as we examine ourselves church I wonder if we could bow our heads and look into the labor of God's Word this morning the Word of God has been preached I like I said I just felt led of the Holy Spirit to preach this out in Iowa and just saw some tremendous results but I wonder if anything was said this morning that spoke to the hearts of the believers I sure hope something did if your life is clean from all the things I mentioned the worldly temptations then praise the Lord but you've still got a responsibility to be a living sacrifice and to draw near unto God for other people hallelujah you know we just came to my mind Jesus Jesus was going to the cross and he said I sanctify myself for their sakes hey hey man Jesus did nothing wrong he never sinned he never was unclean but he said I can live a more devoted life I can live a more purer life for the sake of others now with heads bowed and eyes closed I'd like you to think about your life look into the word and I'm not gonna ask him to raise their hands today but if you know death has entered into your home or you've touched something dad please confess it right now before the Lord you're welcome to come up for prayer of course if you desire that please do not defile your home yourself and this sanctuary God requires holiness God asks us to live what we know in your heart I just pray you're looking to the mirror of God's Word just as I did before I come to preach I knew what the Holy Spirit place on my heart I had examined myself I prayed hallelujah Lord Jesus nor with our heads bowed just come to your Lord father as we look into the mirror of your word may we see are we clean or unclean dear God Lord I pray if there's anyone unclean they would in their heart spiritually come before the high priest the high priest no I'm unclean we know that you know Lord God but father in those days they had to come to the priest and acknowledge themselves that they were unclean father help anyone who is unclean here may they confess it Lord and not be ashamed to confess it be ashamed of their sin but not to be ashamed to confess it fraud I trust no one here wants to be cut off from the blessings of God lord have mercy upon your people Lord this morning father may you lead them to repentance Lord I just trusted even one hardest help Lord one heart becomes clean then the Holy Spirit had his way Lord this morning we've labored we preached we've saying we've given our gifts lo were recognizing the time of the year but Lord the greatest gift we could receive is the Holy Spirit this morning dear God hallelujah Lord wash all those mae-mae every person unclean may they come before you to be clean Oh God wash them by the waters of your word wash them unto the sprinkling unto the obedience in the knowledge of Christ I pray for them Lord bring your people to repentance Lord those that have sinned against you Lord Jesus may this sanctuary be holy holy holy Lord God Almighty which was and is and is to come now father I pray for everyone else Lord God who feels like there under the anointing and clean father I pray you'd help make everybody a living sacrifice in our church we saw how we have to approach we have to be clean then we become as it come as a sacrifice to the worship of God we let you cut us and we let you wash our inwards even more we get more sanctified and we enter into the holy place and see our lives as a dramatic depiction polling on the oil of the Holy Ghost your God feasting on Lord the shewbread the the mysteries of God and Lord now we're in prayer Lord God hallelujah we've stopped at this time for prayer and Lord as this incense burns may it be sweet near God may the Ries wheat prayers come up right now Lord God I trust everyone's talking to your Lord in their own way
