become a citizen so she's working tonight let's pray for her as she works i don't know any detail that's all i know also there's a brother uh named emilio he's translating my youtube videos into spanish anyways his granddaughter keeps getting sick she has lots of sickness so yes for prayer for her also he's seeking the baptism of the holy ghost he said my videos have been a great help so let's pray for him to be born again he really wants to be born again so let's pray that heaven will come down on him also i talked to your brother uh from canada last night um he said just me calling i called him back after a couple weeks just out of the blue and he said it was totally god he was so depressed and discouraged and he said the words all the words that i said just raised him out of his discouragement and he said the timing was perfect he said he just got off the phone with his son jesse and then i called immediately a jesse after getting off the phone with his son jesse so it was lined up perfectly he was discouraged and god really blessed him and he's receiving the message he received serpent seed today so that's encouraging also um there's a spoke or a family unspoken we're not going to name but a family in the message and the the married mother lost a baby today there's a miscarriage today so we don't want to share too much but they just reached out to me for

p.m and then the supreme court makes a decision let's just pray for justice we know we're going to lose rights at some point but i don't want to be now and all i can do is make my request known unto god and god will orchestrate everything but remember he don't i don't know if i'll show you the scripture but he was looking in israel he's looking for a man to stand up and pray and intercede he

decision we can restart lord missionary work and do our part and have a greater zeal for it because it's been stopped and hindered we just come against satan i would try to hinder the missionary work we rebuke satan in jesus name and oh god open up the doors that we can finish the great commission lord god for your glory bless our preaching and worship tonight in jesus christ holy the saint said amen let's give god a round of applause thank you jesus god still moves in the hearts of his people god still moves he [Music] [Music] god still [Music] or does he say [Music] in the hearts of his people god's death [Music] amen praise praise god let's take our bibles here let's go to revelation 6 verse 9 by god's grace we want to look at israel the mystery of israel's blindness part 3 tonight uh i'm going to try to keep it short here try to preach about 40 minutes the lord is willing revelation 6 9. we're making good progress i just got another chapter edited so i think we're at 9 out of 14 edited so thankful to lord for that we're going to finish it the lord tarries by god's grace and get it out to the saints get it out to the uh people that want to that are hungry and thirsting for righteousness praise god commissioned by god to defend this message so we're thankful for the wonderful opportunity we have to do that i just had a pastor email me last week and said god is uh using me to write this book he says uh because of the lockdown he said if we can't go preach he said they can send this book i thought well i never thought about that we'll see how long the lockdown lasts but i just thought well what what an interesting thought i never thought about that so we'll just see what the lord does revelation 6 9 through 11. just looking at the fifth seal again how uh jews that have been blinded to christ can still be saved they can go their whole lives not confess jesus's name not be baptized in the name of lord jesus christ yet the lord still hears them and the lord will still avenge their cries revelation 6 9 i'll just read here and when he had opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long o lord holy and true dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fellow servants also and their brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled i just want to have one more word of prayer here heavenly father lord we've preached i'm sorry we've sang your songs lord god and we've worshipped you we've prayed we've tried to intercede now it's time lord to preach your word so father may you preach through me lord god may i yield to you and may faith come by hearing tonight lord god and we just pray you'll grant it lord god we know one day that faith will come for the revelation of the rapture the lord for this revelation may be clear to your people clear to all saints lord god that you blinded your people that you might get a gentile bride but lord you will take the blinders off one day what a glorious moment that will be on mount zion and father we just thank you lord that we can have open eyes now and receive it today in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you may be seated by god's grace thank you just looking if there's any other requests i didn't forget okay all right so let's look here to uh israel's blindness we're looking at part three so remember we have three reasons i'm sorry six reasons why god can save blinded people first because jesus prayed for forgiveness for those that didn't know what they were doing jesus wouldn't pray in vain so if jesus would pray for people that were unaware of what they were doing we know they can be forgiven or else he he would have been praying in vain but our lord doesn't waste words he doesn't waste prayers oh and jesus said oh he said i know that the father hears me always amen praise god the scripture just came to me right now praise god i know that thou hearst me always i'm write that down real quick i know that thou hears me always so if the jesus prayed it the father would certainly honor it praise god now the second reason was because of paul's teachings in romans 11 he says elect there's election that was there's a remnant that was blinded uh to christ the rest were uh elected to believe it right so some were blinded some received it but then god will give them he'll graft them back in he'll graft in the ones that were blinded after the gentiles are done third uh the foreshadowing of the life of joseph proves right that god is good to the blinded israelis praise god because joseph types jesus christ and jesus is kind to his brethren who mistreated him and he feeds them he's good to them and then we know scripturally they get 12 of those 24 seats around the throne in heaven praise god so any blinded jew that's faithful to the word of god jesus will receive just like joseph received his brethren okay the fourth reason was the fist seal and this is what we looked at last time a few weeks ago let's see i believe it was on uh yeah november 25th wow it's almost been uh half a month here so uh we saw that there was four reasons that prove it was israel uh they were slain for the word of god uh which was the old testament they call for vengeance and christians don't call for vengeance so they have to be jews third they're given white robes after their deaths at the white throne judgment but we have them now right the baptism holy ghost is symbolically uh as as symbolic as clothes over your soul praise god and we'll look again at that a little bit more tonight by god's grace it's like your soul is clothed it's not naked it's clothed with life praise god and that's just that's how the bible gives some symbolism for the baptism of the holy ghost we must accept it and then fourth there was more fellow servants or brethren that would have to be martyred and so that takes us to the blood curse that the jews called upon themselves at the cross of jesus let his blood be upon us so only god knows that number that needs to be calculated uh that needs to have punishment on them for crucifying their own messiah only god knows that number we know it's more than 6 million right because 6 million jews died during the holocaust and that's just that's just in the 1940s right so think about all the jews that were martyred before that so the number must be a great number uh in order to equal the punishment that would go upon crucifying your own messiah so the numbers in the millions no doubt if not more now for tonight let's get right to the new things so the fifth seal also opens up brother and tells us where souls go he said they're not sleeping he said the souls are living he said they go somewhere they are alive right because some churches teach the soul goes and it lays there in the grave right it lays in the cemetery that's what a lot of churches teach and that's wrong the soul does not stay there with the body the soul leaves the body praise god amen and it goes one of three places now notice it's three because three is a number of perfection praise god right and it's after earth right it's after earthly life four is the number of earth right there's four reactions you can add to the gospel because you're on earth but after earth there's three locations you can go right because it's not uh because uh heaven and heaven under the throne and the heart of the earth uh doesn't pertain all to the earth it pertains to the afterlife right so it's a number three not number four four always pertains to the earth okay so it's even perfect with three praise god and the locations are under the altar of incense in heaven paradise in heaven and then the prison in the heart of the earth so those are the three locations you can go now uh here we know in the fifth seal jews go under the altar in heaven it's near the throne of christ and what a consolation to know how near jews are to christ who've kept the old testament praise god what a consolation and church not only that but they can cry out to jesus and be heard praise god amen that that shows if that doesn't show it i don't know what will but it shows the power of god's covenants praise god you can be under a previous covenant and if you honor that covenant god's still going to honor you praise god you don't you you don't honor the current covenant you're not under the current uh uh contract would say you're under a a previous contract but god still honors the previous if you can't see the current one praise god and he still hears your prayers that that's amazing that's amazing you're not living under the current contract can you imagine your job honoring the previous contract that's unheard of right with teachers you know we we're under always under the current contract we couldn't be under the old contract but yet god is so great that he honors the current one and the old one praise god hallelujah all the benefits praise god amen all the benefits of abraham praise god what was that that was uh that was about uh 4 000 years ago or i'm sorry not how many years ago had abraham been that was after the flood so about four thousand probably four thousand or maybe three thousand so four or three thousand years ago god still honoring that covenant today because he's a merciful god amen now so that's the first thing now let's look at this altar of incense here in the scripture so go to revelation 8 3. let's go there and let's just get a good look at this altar it's called an altar of golden altar of incense and it's the only altar mentioned in heaven that i can find in the new testament okay so it's called the golden altar of incense revelation 8 3 and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden sensor that was the container that of course had the incense in it and there was given unto him much incense that he should offer it up with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne so there's a golden altar right an altar of incense right before the throne of jesus christ just like moses set up in the old testament praise god there was an altar of incense where prayers were offered right before the holiest of holies right right before the ark of the covenant because remember moses got the idea of his tabernacle from heaven's tabernacle praise god moses was the shadow the true was in heaven amen and so that's where he gets the idea now here's some more go to verse five and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth and there was voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake right he cast the censer to the earth that's quite a striking thing i don't understand that but a sensor is cast to the earth and it looks like judgment because whenever you see thunderings lightnings earthquakes it speaks of judgment okay next verse is 9 13 revelation 9 13 this is under the sounding of the fifth angel this of course this is during the tribulation period 9 13 and the six angels sounded i'm sorry now we're getting the sixth and i heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before god okay so there's a voice from the horn so you have a golden altar it's got four horns on it this is where they offer incense this is where the prayers are this is where the prayers begin to be answered it seems like because they must go up before the throne of god remember the incense had to go in to the holiest of holies right it had to make a way into the holiest of holies what a consolation church in our prayers even now praise god are going out to heaven and jesus hears our prayers amen like the incense that went before them in the holiest of holies that's how we go into the presence of god amen thank god for his mercy now they got to be real prayers they got to be fiery prayers right they got to be like compassionate prayers we heard about that on sunday praise god it just can't be flippant prayers or insincere prayers you have to feel it you have to have compassion for it that represents the fire of god the sincerity like like the bible said a preacher is like a firebrand plucked out of the fire praise god amen there's like a it's like it's like an instrument right for for keeping a fire going it's an instrument and it's on fire it's plucked out of the fire and it's burning with the life of jesus amen and so we see here now notice this altar of incense is the closest piece of furniture to the holiest of holies right just like in moses's tabernacle so you have a incense then you have a veil then you have the holiest of holies now hebrews 6 19 let's read that this tells us heaven also has a veil now that's interesting the earthly veil was rent right the earthly veil was wrapped but there must be a veil in heaven because the bible says so and it's in the new testament because this veil separates the jews that are not born again from those who are born again ah think about that church wow let's read hebrews 6 19 i'm not making this up this is all scriptural so the heavenly veil still exists which hope we have as an anchor for the soul both sure and steadfast and which entereth into that within the veil so our hope is not just well i hope so real divine hope reaches all the way behind the veil to the very heart of jesus amen so your hope and your faith is actually connected to jesus why because it's his faith amen it's a gift he shares with you praise god amen it's the holy spirit in you it's an attribute it's an attribute of the holy spirit and it reaches past the altar of incense behind the veil to the very heart of christ jesus amen it's hard to explain it's hard to explain right it's hard to understand but yet the bible says it's true so i believe it amen see saved blinded jews are close to christ but see there remains a distance between the jews and jesus because they're not born again there's distance so there's the altar of incense they're under the altar you have the altar you have angels speaking from the altar then you have a veil that's strange i got a little echo here anybody know where that echo is coming from oh sorry about that i just i'm just curious i don't know if it impacts the live stream or not if it don't then who cares but uh if it does i don't know that might impact uh mommy or anyone on the the livestream there so so see church there is a space there's jews under the altar the altar incense there's angels then you have a veil and then you have the throne of god or it's also called the holiest of holies in heaven as well amen so now revelation uh 14 18 revelation 14 18. and another angel came out from the altar which had power over fire and cry with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying thrust in the sharp sickle and gather am i reading the right verse and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth for her grapes are fully ripe oh yeah from the altar yeah another angel came forth from the altar so look at these angels where are they coming form they're coming from this altar of incense right so in other words all these prayers right of all these prayers of the saints for justice right all the prayers of the saints uh lord avenge me like that's the jews too right avengers they're all getting answered now praise god they're all getting answered now because remember that altar of incense right was where prayers go so all those prayers were stored there and then god makes sure every prayer is answered amen amen every prayer that was from a sincere heart that lined up with the will of god you know god is going to answer it praise god now let's go back to revelation 13. just i want to just lay this out real quick and this makes me unpopular i know but i just can't uh i just can't deny the word of god right so uh revelation well i'm always unpopular anyway but uh revelation uh nine let's go back there now a lot of people read verse 14 15 and 16 and and they say that all these demons have already been loose out of the river euphrates brother ram teaches this in feast of trumpets but i personally don't believe that okay that's just i'm just letting you know that's my opinion because these trumpets can't sound until after the rapture and after the 144 thousand have been sealed so people can believe what they want brother brahm never said thus saith the lord with the feast of the trumpets okay but they can just believe whatever they want right because this is already after uh the rapture has already taken place uh because god can't and this and the 144 thousand jews are already sealed right so let's read that 14 saying to the six angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound in the great river euphrates and the four angels were loose which were prepared for hour a day a month a year for to slay the third part of men and the number of the army of horsemen were 200 000 000 and i heard the number of them so 200 million demons right and we know brother man mentions it but i personally just believe he was doing his best to interpret the word i personally believe this can't happen until after the rapture you say prove it i'll be happy to revelation 7 verse 1 verse 3 i'm sorry revelation 7 3 sorry revelation 7 3 saying hurt not the earth nor the sea nor the trees till we have sealed the servants of god in their foreheads amen and then he lists who they are they're the jews praise god the earth can't be hurt the men can't be hurt none of these major things can happen until after those 144 000 get the holy ghost and that can't happen until after the three and a half year ministry of the two prophets praise god right because the bible said after they leave the remnant glorify god and then they're ready then to receive the one they were preaching about jesus amen amen so people can believe whatever they want you know i'll just i'll just kind of nod my head and think you know when people preach that you know that the 200 million demons are at least i'll just nod my head and say i won't say amen i'll just say that's what most people think but if you put all the scriptures together it just can't line up right then you have the tribulation started in 1940s if if people teach us and believe this the tribulation already started church because that was the sixth trumpet was it not the sixth trumpet was that yeah that was the sixth trumpet so that's true the rapture already happened we missed the rapture we're living in the tribulation and this is the longest tribulation anyone ever thought of right because it's been over it's almost been 80 years of tribulation right so see how strange that sounds when you really look at all these scriptures and you've got to line it up so i just agree to disagree and i'll just do it with love i'm going to make a doctrine out of it but i am gonna try to stay with and rightly divide the word of truth all right so just so you know that's just one thing i thought i would lay in there because we just read about it the altar of incense okay all right but you know if you stand on the word you're going to get criticized right right if you don't if you don't worship brother brandon you're getting criticized by the brother and worshipers right so you just got to stand above that you got to stand upon the word of god now there must be another altar though in the holiest of holies right we would call it the mercy seat because jesus's blood there's a portion of it in heaven so go to revelation 5 verse 6 revelation 5 6. so somehow that physical body we know jesus physical body uh was crilled and crucified somehow i don't know if it was by angel or what but somehow that blood was some of that blood was preserved and taken to heaven right now i don't know how but revelation 5 6 and i be held alone in the midst of the throne of the four beasts in the midst of the elders to the lamb as it had been slain having a i'm sorry having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth so there is some type of bloody looking uh body of christ right in heaven and that one came forth to take the book and redeem it praise god because no other man was worthy to take the book of redemption because no other man could redeem man except the holy man praise god the one who became sin the one who paid for our sins he was the only one who could take that book of redemption and say i'm buying it back i'm taking it back and then i'm going to open it and i'm going to send it back to earth praise god amen so that the saints can eat the revelations of the seven seals right the open book and they would have they would have honey in their lips but they'd be bitter in their bellies and they would take that and prophesy again to every nation that's the whole story right taking the restored book taking the real teaching of redemption and delivering it back to god's people i'm glad i can hear it praise god hallelujah amen glory revelation 19 13. revelation 19 13. i'm glad i got a good understanding aren't you church of redemption redemption is really not it's not just coming out of egypt that's what everybody believes today oh once you're out of egypt you're filled with the holy ghost you ain't in the promised land yet right just because you're out just because you're crossing the red sea you got baptized that don't mean you're fully redeemed yet you gotta he brought you out in order to take you in praise god amen see we didn't know that denominations we know it now praise god because the book's been open amen the book of redemption praise god amen see it truly shows that this revelation it's thus saith the lord and it has to go around the world to show us what real redemption is because the redeemer came he opened it and brought it down to earth praise god amen ah yep revelation 19 13 there's got to be some blood in heaven there must be a heavenly mercy seat there must be a heavenly altar or in other words a mercy seat and he was clothed with a veg vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god he has a vesture or cloth right and there's blood on it where'd that blood come from it's the same blood that we saw revelation 5 it has to be the blood of the lamb praise god it has to be the blood of the word amen the blood of jesus amen somehow god's able to to have that blood there in heaven as well on a heavenly altar in the holies of holies making intercession for you and i right now praise god amen what else can you depend on when satan says sister who did this brother amen to this sister christian did this what else can you trust in other than the blood of jesus praise god you and i have no other hope except to plead the blood praise god and that blood says jesus they accepted jesus's pardon for it and they're not guilty of it they're justified amen amen the blood they have to have blood there that has mercy on us praise god amen see and the bible says we currently have redemption colossians 1 14. colossians 1 14 is not something that uh we we had you know before it's not something that we'll just have in the future the bible says we are redeemed bro brought back and purchased right now praise god we are brought back to full authority of christians praise god the children of god look at colossians 1 14 in whom we have it i'm not looking for it brother amen i've got it praise god satan we don't we're not looking for redemption we've got it praise god we are redeemed we are now the children of god amen that's why when you pray god many times hears you that's why when you need help god shows up praise god that's why when you need a refreshing god sends it to you because you now have redemption amen like that brother told me last night he was deep in depression he said god had you call me he's like why did you call me i said well i was just going through i had some free time i was going through my old voicemails he said god had you call me because i needed encouragement tonight see why because i'm already redeemed right i'm already redeemed i'm already a child they that are led by the spirit of god are the children of god amen through what through my efforts no through the blood of jesus amen because he saved me i'm trusting in it he forgives me i've got redemption i'm brought back i'm a child of god i know who i am i know where i come from and i certainly know where i'm going praise god amen and we've got the forgiveness of sin so redemption part most of that or part of that aspect is forgiven of all sins god has nothing against us because we're walking in the light that he's given us amen all right so that's the first location is under the altar the second location is paradise up higher beyond it must be behind the veil or close to the veil above that is called paradise the bible calls it and this is only this is the second location only holy ghost filled saints go there amen that's where i want to go amen hallelujah see uh so i believe this is my opinion foolish virgin christians must go be with the by the jews somewhere they must be by the jews somewhere because they're not born again the jews are not born again they only have a testimony for the word of god and so they're under the altar of incense they're under the prayer altar so i believe that's where the foolish virgin goes i could be wrong on that but paradise we know used to be in the heart of the earth used to be abraham's bosom we know jesus took his own blood down there he defeated satan he rose with the keys of death and hell changed paradise location to heaven praise god and now it's also called the third heaven this is where the heavenly hosts and believers go praise god an innumerable number of angels amen and you and i one day will get to go there and see it praise god hallelujah now the third location is prison it's called hell in luke 16 23. it's located in the heart of the earth it's the third location disobedient unbelieving souls go there like jesus's story of the rich man and the beggar lazarus first peter 3 also says jesus preached the disobedient souls in prison and he descended to hell i'm sorry when he descended to hell following his crucifixion all right now let's look at what happens and off the close of this because we're already coming up on time here let's close on this i just you know i felt led to put this in the book the bible tells you almost exactly what's going to happen after you die the bible tells us almost certainly what's going to happen so let's go to luke 16 22 please so immediately after a person dies and sometimes right before the person dies angels show up praise god amen luke 16 22 and it came to pass that the beggar died when was carried by the angels into abraham's bosom praise god the rich man also died and was buried verse 23 can you pull it up there hon and he and hell he lifted up his eyes being in torments and seeth abraham afar off and lazarus in his bosom okay so we know believers will instantly see angels remember when sister karen's mother passed away she said their whole family heard angels singing right before she passed away so that proves one of the first things that happens is you start breaking that realm and angels are there right at their post of duty see jesus knew yours was your time to cross over to reward so he sent some messengers to guide you guide you across right brother brown called him angel paul bears angel followers that helped moses get from a death right to resurrection and to escort him into that other dimension praise god amen so we know angels are waiting right there to take us ascending up to heaven praise god rather than descending to the heart of the earth right so it seems like faithful jews and foolish virgin christians would also grow go under the altar of incense the second thing that happens if you're not born again you keep your same mind right your same memories your same character your same convictions some of your own feelings whether good or bad i believe a holy ghost-filled saint he'll get a new theophany and he'll lose all those most of those old ones i believe that but if you're not born again you keep almost all your thoughts in your mind and that's proven by the jews right they wanted vengeance that proves they didn't have the right right mind right they still wanted vengeance okay it's also proven by a few other examples here let me look at him here the rich man that went to hell he was still unreasonable and he thought well his brothers would repent if they saw miracles look how unreasonable that is oh just show my brother's a miracle remember the rich man he said send lazarus to go let him resurrect and go tell my my brothers and that was totally unreasonable and abraham said they won't believe if they won't even believe the law how they're going to believe a resurrection see that proof church any miracle it's only for believers praise god amen right unbelievers are not going to receive it they'll write off and say oh he was pretending oh the sister was pretending see if you don't even believe the simple word of god the simple revelation of faith and jesus christ raising from the dead you ain't going to believe nothing else about miracles they'll find a way to write it off like a person asked me one time oh prove to me that your mom uh resurrect or prove to me that your mom was healed of cancer go get the medical forms i'm like i can't get it but you isn't her own testimony enough i said why don't you call her on the phone they wouldn't they didn't want to do it because they ain't going to believe anyway right there's going to be all and the one i think the one jehovah's witness guy told me he said well she probably never had cancer to begin with huh well they picked it up on their machine right she was getting sick and weakly and tired that's why she went for the doctor's appointment in the first place see if you won't believe a simple word you ain't going to believe the miracles so when when these people that are sinners when they die they keep all their their previous thoughts their convictions and when the ones that aren't born again they keep the same ones too like the jews see they don't have divine love still god lets them keep their thoughts so see witnessing a miracle doesn't save a person's soul just like brother dennis preach right it's a false sense of security faith and repentance lead to salvation amen now thirdly the third thing that will happen after that after you see angels and many people will keep their human spirit i believe the holy ghostfield saints get a new one though holy ghost filled believers receive a new celestial heavenly body it's called a theophany uh by most scholars it's our eternal body that's in the heavens imagine that it's eternal praise god it was always in the mind of god right and it was now it wasn't always there as a body right as a body it was always there in the mind of god so that means god's thoughts are just as eternal as god's creation praise god amen right because at one point there was nothing there was no angels there was no bodies it was just god but his thoughts about the bodies were eternal praise god and so the bodies are eternal amen so see the bible says paul says we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven anybody growing up for that lately i grow them for a body that's not achy and tired right i grown for a body that doesn't have the same old mind battles and thoughts and fears and and complexes amen right we grown for that body that's eternal that doesn't have any faults it doesn't have any fears it doesn't have any weaknesses because we want to be strong we want to be like jesus amen he said we groan for that i just want a new body amen i just want a body that's going to get everything right praise god and glorify jesus but paul calls it clothing you're clothed with it now go to the second corinthians 5 3 acacia 5 3 here's the scripture that says without the baptism of the holy ghost the soul and spirit are naked before god which is a shameful state right so see in other words to like when we think of nakedness we think of shame right like adam and eve they were instantly shameful when they realized they were naked well so is the soul that doesn't have the life of god in other words god must be like offering right god must be offering here put on my life here's the holy spirit here you know put this on it'll cover you it'll cover your shame it'll cover your guilt praise god it'll cover your embarrassments it'll cover all that just put my clothes on put my life on amen oh thank the lord second corinthians 5 3 sorry remember brother man said god wants you to give you the holy ghost more than you want it so god is like knocking on your door here put some clothes on put some clothes on here your life is shameful put some clothes on put my life on look if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked what person uh in their same mind wants to be discovered naked it's a shame right for most sane people for insane people they like to be half naked or holy naked or whatever right but god but paul says if yours if your soul doesn't have that theophany if it does if it's not born again your souls naked or shameful before god that's why they got to be under the altar not above because they haven't quite come into god's presence all the way right that's why they got to be under the altar so there's a level of uh now this is quite a deep thought here that the soul is naked before god okay so see that so when when when let's say let's say the jewish person they're a true jew they die their body stays here but church their human spirit goes like this it ascends up to heaven now it's got the soul inside of it is everybody with me right because your soul is the nature of your human spirit it goes up there and it still cries out to god but it's still naked before god it doesn't have the right kind of clothing on it but jesus promised you just wait i'm going to give you a white robe praise god at the white throne judgment because you missed it during your life right but i'll give it to you because you're faithful to what you knew i'll give you clothing so you won't be ashamed for all eternity amen an eternal body in the heavens amen we're groaning we're groaning for that see because we already got a portion of it right here our souls our clothes our soul has the strength of jesus and now we just want the rest of it to have it amen we want the rest of these three parts to have it right we want the other two to have god's god's clothing on it pray because we're ashamed of this aren't we every time we sin we're ashamed of this every time we have evil thoughts right uh sometimes i have evil thoughts and later i'll repent i'll say how in the world did i think that what what inspiration was i under the devil's influence the devil's inspiration right and we're ashamed of that why because our mind's not always clothed the clothing comes off and on you understand the anointing comes off and on the mind right sometimes it's strong sometimes it's covered sometimes anointing leaves all right [Music] yeah i better yeah okay guys i got two minutes on here just to kind of give us a little bit of a cushion there so that's the third thing that happens a holy ghost-filled saint he gets a he gets clothing for his soul he gets a theophany body so his spirit and soul can go right into another body an eternal body in the heavens that was always there for us hallelujah like brother said he's going to get his hair back he's going to go get all the hair that he lost right it went back to where it was that's just a small thing right we all we really desires the perfection praise god but that's just a little thing little joke there now the fourth thing is after death after your angels escort you you get a new body the next thing is you are present with jesus now remember things there move really fast things here move really slow although we think they move faster things move very fast because you have satan accusing all night day and night he's accusing us and jesus says under the blood of the blood think about all the saints around the world he's accusing me that's a lot of visits to the throne of god that's a lot of pardons he gives us praise god amen and yet he's got time to go prepare a place for us a heavenly mansion called the new jerusalem right he's got time to do that and yet he's got time to be present with those that have passed on because paul says that in second corinthians 5 8 can you pull that up there he's got time to make the new jerusalem he's got time to forgive us he's got time to rebuke satan and he's got time to be present with you and anyone who dies before the rapture we are confident i say and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present from with the lord rather present with the lord now it's it's uncertain how much we'll see him right because when brother bran went beyond the current time he said you can't see him now he's higher so i really can't explain that okay because i'm not sure which part brother man got to go to which part of paradise you got to go to i'm not sure i don't know but the bible says and if paul said we will be present with the lord we will be present with the lord right because paul's not going to lie he was inspired by the holy spirit but and we also know he's constantly making intercession for us as well intercession he's going between us and the father right and that's beyond behind the veil because that's how the high priest made intercession he had to go behind the veil and the bible said there's a veil in heaven and the holy spirit is in heaven he's got all this time to do all this intercession because he's the author of time he's not bound to it he lets time work for him let me find a place to stop here fifth you'll be reunited with members of the family that were believers uh that's in ii samuel 12 23. ii samuel 12 23 in this case david is reunited with the the baby that died uh from his uh immoral union with bathsheba through adultery but the bible said they'll be reunited but now he's dead wherefore should i should i fast can i bring him back again i shall go to him but he shall not return to me see there is a reuniting with loved ones right but iran saw the millions running to my precious brother he said his wife even hope just hugged him and said my precious brother he thought oh sure she's gonna say i love you bill you're my husband and she didn't she just said to my precious brother and moved on interesting okay so we get reunited it's a great consolation to those who've lost children through tragedies or accidents miscarriages and more like we prayed for tonight also as a believer you'll instantly recognize saints who live before you because on mount transfiguration peter james and john got in the vision of of the the heavenly vision right and they instantly knew moses and elijah moses lived 1500 years before peter yet peter said that's moses amen see when you get that mind of the holy spirit you'll recognize all the saints amen why because they're your family they're part of god they're part of the they're in your family abraham's family praise god amen they also recognize elijah who was 900 years alive before peter james and john oh i know exactly what he looks like that's elijah right church we're gonna recognize people that are six thousand years old praise god adam and and and abel and abel praise the lord and bye we're gonna just recognize them because we're under the anointing of the holy spirit we're going to be under the vision of god right the leadership of god we have new eyeballs in hallelujah we have brand new glorified eyeballs or if we're not if we don't the glorified bodies yet we'll have theophany eyeballs and we'll see the theophany bodies with theophany's spiritual eyes and we'll recognize him instantly brother branham hallelujah right oh my think about it church all these blessings instantly after we cross over to that other side the bible said at jesus resurrection many of the old testament saints went into the holy city and appeared to many right and if they're under that anointing perhaps they recognized it right if they're under that holy anointing of god's spirit let's stand here i better stop here because i'm about ready to to head out here hallelujah so lastly the last thing we'll see is once we get their church we will bask in the glory of angel worship because the bible said the angels cease not and they cry all day holy holy holy is the lord god almighty imagine as we as the angels uh uh accompany us as they're like our uh our escorts as they escort us closer and closer the songs will get louder and louder what does that sound holy holy and as we grow closer we get louder and louder and louder and now our new ears can handle it now right we're not going to cover our ears like we do down here oh it's too loud somebody turn down the noise it's going to be music to our new ears as the angels cries get louder and louder and then we see jesus because to be absent from this body is to be present with the lord amen musicians you can come by god's grace which was and is and is to come [Music] revelation 5 12 says we'll hear loud voices shouting worthy is a lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory in blessing loud shouts of praise now you think we shout loud here what about over there what about angels shouting men angels shouting what about the saints shouting and praise the lord joining that new song right joining in that heavenly song be new to us all these things instantly happen after we leave this shadow life and we go to the true life how are we looking forward to that true life amen hallelujah certainly with all of our hearts can we sing that song go to live with god i'd like to just sing that song here tonight church let's just take this attitude here tonight as we close this service let's just have this attitude here that uh we'll go through every trial let's have this attitude of we're just groaning oh lord how i want to have a new body let's not get comfortable here on this earth let's not get comfortable in these bodies let's not enjoy life too much here let's look forward to a perfect body and church i think the longer we think about it then we'll start groaning right we'll start feeling our need for that new body paul grown for it [Music] he said we've grown earnestly desire to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven let's just bow our heads for a moment think about that church we start hearing angels [Music] brother jesse we're here to escort you to paradise hallelujah church we'll look up we'll see angels we'll see we'll look down at ourselves and we'll see theophany body praise god we'll see a white robe on the bible said they're clothed with white robes we already know we're gonna wear i forgot to put that in the booth we already know we're gonna wear white robes imagine that churches were escorted the praises get louder louder pretty soon we're in the presence of the lord oh think about that looking at his face seeing the nail scarred hands seeing the nail scarred feet we know the saints fall down and worshiping i'm sure we'll do the same to some degree oh lord let's just pray heavenly father we thank you for these truths that we hear tonight of your god the mystery of israel's blindness lord how gracious you are lord to give them eternal life to give them a place so near to your throne the lord it leads us to look a little closer to the throne where we see paradise where we're promised that we get to hear the angels sing we get to be present with the lord are we grown for that tonight lord god in the midst of the violence of this earth and the the corruption and the greed of this earth the murders of this earth the immorality of the abomination of this earth how we grow lord god to have a perfect body and to be present with you that will be the greatest gift we love angels we love singing we love new bodies and white robes but what we love most of all is you jesus we grow lord god to go to be with you lord hallelujah jesus lord let us live in a way lord that is preparing us to go to meet you lord we want to ascend up with the angels we want to see white robes lord god and we want to see your face face to face ready heavenly father lord we also want to thank you that we are now redeemed and now we have redemption through your blood thank you for buying us back purchasing us back making us fully sons and daughters of god give us faith on this earth lord god to speak your word to believe your word your promises hallelujah and we can enjoy all the blessings and spoils of your victory on the cross resurrection lord we thank you for this thank you for the refreshing of our hearts and our minds tonight in jesus christ's name we pray amen [Music] i will have all of you [Music] [Applause] [Music] just like this [Music] [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] myself [Applause] [Music] when i go [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] from i will see [Music] [Applause] [Music] i'll see [Music] i'll see [Music] [Music] when i go to live [Music] oh [Music] here tonight by god's grace
