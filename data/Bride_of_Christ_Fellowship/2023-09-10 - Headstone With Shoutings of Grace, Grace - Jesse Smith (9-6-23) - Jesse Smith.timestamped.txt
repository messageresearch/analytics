[0:01] Zechariah Chapter 4 verses 1 to 7.
[0:05] I'll read uh one through five then we
[0:08] can read six and seven together again
[0:10] tonight I'd like to preach on The
[0:11] Headstone with shoutings of Grace Grace
[0:15] and the angel that talked with me came
[0:17] again and waked me as a man that has
[0:19] wakened out of his sleep and he said
[0:20] unto me what see is thou and I said I
[0:23] have looked and behold a Candlestick of
[0:24] all gold with a bowl upon the top of it
[0:27] and his seven lamps thereon and seven
[0:29] pipes to the seven lamps which are upon
[0:32] the top thereof the two olive trees buy
[0:34] it one upon the right side of the bowl
[0:37] and the other up on the left side
[0:38] thereof so I answered and spanked to the
[0:41] angel that talked with me saying what
[0:43] are these my Lord and the angel that
[0:46] talked with me answered and said to me
[0:47] nois thou not what these be and I said
[0:50] no my Lord
[0:52] all right let's read six and seven ready
[0:54] one two three and he answered and spake
[0:57] unto me saying this is the word of the
[1:01] Lord unto zerubbable saying not by might
[1:04] nor by power but by my spirit saith the
[1:08] Lord of hosts who art thou o great
[1:12] Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt
[1:15] become a plane and he shall bring forth
[1:18] The Headstone thereof with shoutings
[1:21] crying Grace Grace unto it amen
[1:25] hallelujah let's have one more word of
[1:26] prayer yeah we need on your heart let's
[1:27] make an order to God what a beautiful
[1:29] portion of scripture
[1:31] very prophetic uh portion here father
[1:33] God we just come in the mighty name of
[1:35] Jesus Lord anoint this word anoint me
[1:37] anoint the hearers Lord God speak to us
[1:39] Lord God thank you for the prophetic
[1:40] element to this portion of scripture as
[1:43] it applies to us
[1:45] we can clearly see it Lord through the
[1:47] scriptures so God anoint us here and
[1:48] guide us and direct us in Jesus Christ's
[1:50] name whatever I said
[1:52] amen God bless you Japan
[2:02] all right so like I said it's been a
[2:03] while since I've preached on this but I
[2:04] heard a minister and uh mention this and
[2:06] I thought oh I'd like to go back through
[2:08] my notes and preach on this so I can
[2:09] switch over and I got a few uh slides to
[2:12] show by the grace of the Lord
[2:15] I want to try to maybe keep it a little
[2:17] shorter tonight I'm still getting over
[2:19] my sickness I got to make sure I get
[2:20] some good rest here
[2:22] tonight by the grace of the Lord so
[2:24] we're looking at The Headstone with
[2:25] shoutings of Grace Grace
[2:27] you read our text uh here's a little
[2:29] background on this Aruba Bowl
[2:31] now if you're not familiar with it you
[2:32] know numerous of these books kind of go
[2:34] together uh Ezra
[2:37] you have Zechariah haggai
[2:41] go together there's a little a little
[2:44] bit of overlap with those three books if
[2:46] you ever study those out I appreciate it
[2:48] back in 2013 so it's been 10 years since
[2:50] I pretty soon this I don't expect
[2:51] everybody to remember
[2:53] but there is a lot of overlap and you
[2:55] get so many good nuggets as you read
[2:56] through those three books Ezra and then
[2:59] Zechariah and hagini
[3:02] okay so here's a little background on
[3:04] zerubo uh he came out of Babylon
[3:09] he was also a descendant of the royal
[3:11] line of David
[3:13] he's according to the uh he's a grandson
[3:16] or nephew of Salah Thiel
[3:19] he's also known by his Persian name
[3:21] Bazaar
[3:24] in the first year of Cyrus the King of
[3:26] Persia he led the first band of Jews
[3:28] which was about 42 000 Jews
[3:31] exclusive a large number of servants who
[3:33] returned from captivity to the close of
[3:36] the 70 years so I'll just pause right
[3:39] there he was one of the Jews
[3:41] when he was the one of the first ones
[3:44] that fulfilled Jeremiah 29 right
[3:47] remember Jeremiah 29 we all like it we
[3:51] all we all like to quote that verse for
[3:52] our lives that I have a plan for you
[3:54] right I know my thoughts to you they're
[3:56] good thoughts but he said you'll seek me
[3:59] and find me when you seek me with all
[4:01] your heart right well when was that
[4:03] scripture fulfilled it was fulfilled and
[4:05] drewable
[4:06] is the Fulfillment of that so he had to
[4:09] cross I believe the deserts if we're not
[4:10] mistaken from Babylon to Jerusalem
[4:13] Hallelujah
[4:15] and that was that was the sign that he
[4:17] was seeking God with all of his heart
[4:18] soul mind and strength and then also he
[4:20] started rebuilding the temple of God
[4:23] hallelujah because Solomon's Temple had
[4:25] been destroyed years earlier I think it
[4:28] was 70 years earlier and so they had to
[4:31] rebuild it and he was one of them that
[4:33] led the charge to return and also
[4:36] rebuild so in the second year after the
[4:39] return He erected an altar so first he
[4:42] built the altar
[4:43] and then he laid the foundation of the
[4:45] temple on the ruins of that which had
[4:48] been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar
[4:51] okay and then eventually he finished the
[4:54] house right right Hallelujah he finished
[4:56] the house and then remember after it
[4:58] finished then God said as we're there to
[5:00] teach the people the word of God
[5:02] and lastly God sent Nehemiah to build a
[5:05] wall of protection around the city
[5:07] so it's a beautiful type of how what's
[5:09] the first thing that's restored the
[5:11] blood what's that justification
[5:13] Hallelujah
[5:15] and then you get the house of God here
[5:17] uh sanctification and I would type the
[5:19] baptism only goes to the wall because
[5:21] the wall seals you in so it's a
[5:23] beautiful type there it's a beautiful
[5:25] type justification sanctification
[5:27] baptism of the Holy Ghost uh it's a nice
[5:30] type of God restoring the city of God
[5:33] hallelujah this is a city of David
[5:34] hallelujah amen the city of Zion
[5:37] Hallelujah
[5:38] it's a beautiful type here and you'll
[5:41] see as I get to the end you'll see what
[5:42] this is a type of if you don't remember
[5:44] so I'll save it as a little treat if you
[5:46] don't remember remember you maybe never
[5:48] heard that sermon it's a nice treat
[5:50] there uh but remember Church you know
[5:53] after they laid the foundation remember
[5:54] what happened
[5:55] all the inhabitants got upset and what
[5:58] they do they went to uh the the leaders
[6:00] and they had it shut down right
[6:03] right and it shut down the building for
[6:05] 16 years so they had the foundation
[6:08] but it was unfinished it laid there for
[6:10] 16 years they were so the the people
[6:12] lived in fear for 16 years the church
[6:15] don't feel too discouraged you know if
[6:17] you battle fear for a little bit or you
[6:18] you know you went through some tough
[6:19] times they bowed it for 16 years
[6:23] but God was merciful that's why I love
[6:25] this verse Grace Grace amen God gives us
[6:28] Grace right God gave him Grace to come
[6:30] back and actually build the altar and
[6:33] the uh the foundation
[6:35] but that wasn't enough they needed more
[6:37] grace
[6:38] so God gave them more grace to build the
[6:42] house and then build the wall Hallelujah
[6:45] remember they built the wall in trouble
[6:46] as times the Bible said right remember
[6:48] they worked with one hand with a tool
[6:50] and one hand with the sword amen
[6:52] hallelujah that's the book of Nehemiah
[6:54] beautiful book Hallelujah type I believe
[6:56] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:00] but think about that 16 years
[7:02] uh they would be discouraged it's just
[7:04] like if our church went and tried to buy
[7:06] some land and maybe we maybe we bought
[7:08] the land and cleared it but then we
[7:09] stopped working for 16 years and then
[7:11] finally after 16 years finished it
[7:14] and you know that whole time we'd be
[7:16] fighting my battles well did God call us
[7:18] here did God call us here or not you
[7:19] know what it was it God's will for us to
[7:21] do this or not you know and the whole
[7:23] time it was God's will but God was
[7:25] waiting on them right right and you
[7:27] remember Church how did God stir them up
[7:28] do you remember he sent them two
[7:30] Prophets
[7:31] haggai and Zechariah and the Bible said
[7:35] that Israel prospered through those two
[7:37] prophets and that's how it always is
[7:39] church we Prosper through the prophetic
[7:41] Ministry of brother random and of course
[7:43] no doubt Saint Paul Saint Peter you know
[7:46] James and John of course John he wrote
[7:48] the Book of Revelation but God's people
[7:50] will always uh Prosper through a genuine
[7:53] prophet and that's what I know in my
[7:55] life and most of you are in the
[7:56] nomination you know that too you didn't
[7:58] have the level of spiritual Prosperity
[8:00] that you have now now that you're in the
[8:02] message now that you follow God's
[8:04] Prophet now that you have a prophetic
[8:06] revelation of the Bible Hallelujah
[8:08] that's exactly right Hallelujah my life
[8:11] is a testimony of that my life is
[8:13] prospered spiritually because of the
[8:16] ministry God sent through brother
[8:17] Branham amen so again that's the first
[8:20] interpretation we see of Grace Grace God
[8:22] had to give a second measure of Grace
[8:24] because they got fearful and they quit
[8:27] building
[8:28] and it lasted 16 years
[8:31] my that's almost that's almost half a
[8:33] generation right Generations 40 years
[8:35] that's almost half a generation
[8:38] and uh some say it might have been
[8:40] wasted well some people might have
[8:41] looked at it like that or you could look
[8:43] at it as a learning experience
[8:44] Hallelujah I don't like to look at my
[8:47] life as waste I don't think you know
[8:48] when I fail I don't call it a waste I
[8:50] call it alert experience Hallelujah
[8:52] because you know why because God said he
[8:55] never leaves me or forsakes me
[8:57] and if he never left me or forsake me it
[8:59] wasn't wasted praise God it just took my
[9:02] hard-headed skull right uh my my uh my
[9:06] hard-headedness a little extra time to
[9:08] receive the word of God but I believe in
[9:10] time I will receive all the promises of
[9:12] God for my life
[9:13] amen
[9:15] now uh if you got your Bible
[9:17] remember haggai chapter 2 verse 3.
[9:28] hey guys right before Zechariah
[9:30] and remember he was one of the prophets
[9:32] he and
[9:34] Zechariah
[9:37] did I remember Church you might remember
[9:39] this uh
[9:43] some of the saints that were alive when
[9:46] zerubel finally finished the temple they
[9:49] were alive and they saw Solomon's Temple
[9:53] remember that
[9:55] now
[9:56] from what I read on the on on the
[9:59] history Zero's Temple was able was about
[10:02] the same size as Solomon's Temple but it
[10:06] wasn't as Grand in decoration you
[10:08] remember Solomon's Temple had 12 it had
[10:11] 12 Lions on the six steps six on each
[10:14] side going up into the place of worship
[10:17] and they were covered in gold
[10:20] well this one didn't have that this was
[10:23] just the house
[10:24] right and and Solomon's house was
[10:27] overlaid with gold Outside Inside all
[10:30] the cords because it was a type of the
[10:32] Millennium praise God hallelujah
[10:34] Divinity where we'll live in Divine
[10:36] perfect bodies how the glorified bodies
[10:38] for a thousand years Hallelujah with the
[10:41] son of David Jesus Christ hallelujah
[10:43] amen
[10:45] with some of the same some of the
[10:47] old-timers they look up
[10:48] and they uh zerubel he lays The
[10:51] Headstone it's all finished and verse
[10:53] two says
[10:55] um
[10:55] speaking out is roomable the son of
[10:57] shaytl governor of Judah and to Joshua
[11:00] the son of josedek the high priest and
[11:02] to the rest of the people saying who is
[11:04] left among you that saw this house in
[11:05] her first glory and how do you see it
[11:06] now is it not in your eyes in comparison
[11:09] of as it were nothing and let's just
[11:11] pause there so remember the other verse
[11:13] is in uh Ezra I'm not going to read the
[11:15] other one but the other ones actually
[11:17] records when it was dedicated
[11:20] right and all the young people that
[11:22] never saw Solomon's Temple they were
[11:23] shouting and rejoicing we got a church
[11:25] we got a place of worship God's house is
[11:28] restored they were just excited to have
[11:30] something right
[11:31] but all the old people were discouraged
[11:33] they're like oh we don't have all the
[11:34] jewels and the gold and the lions and
[11:36] all the praise and altars and all these
[11:38] things and they were crying
[11:40] right
[11:42] and it depends on which side you were on
[11:44] if you're the new generation you loved
[11:46] it if your old generation you didn't
[11:47] like it praise God
[11:49] Hallelujah
[11:51] but see what what was the point the
[11:53] point was God was fulfilling his word
[11:55] the old-timers should have been thankful
[11:57] right right they should have been
[11:59] thankful that they had something back
[12:00] that they had a house of God God was
[12:03] moving amen hallelujah and God had
[12:06] brought them across the desert praise
[12:08] God 42 000 completely healthy right
[12:11] completely safe they weren't ambushed
[12:13] they weren't killed God had brought 42
[12:15] gen or 42 000 back they built a brand
[12:18] new Temple they oughta been excited they
[12:20] ought to have been rejoicing so we would
[12:22] say it's a shame on them they should
[12:24] have appreciated what God was doing
[12:25] that's right I'll do verse four yet now
[12:29] be strong with Super Bowl saith the Lord
[12:30] and strong oh Joshua son of josedek the
[12:33] high priest and be strong all you people
[12:34] the land
[12:35] saith the Lord and work for I Am with
[12:37] You saith the Lord of hosts
[12:40] all right
[12:42] now I want to go down here if you go
[12:44] down to uh verse seven and I will shake
[12:46] All Nations and the desire of all
[12:48] Nations shall come and I fill this house
[12:50] with Glory saith the Lord of hosts
[12:53] actually now read verse six I believe
[12:55] this is prophetic here of the Millennium
[12:57] verse six for thus saith the Lord of
[13:00] hosts yet once it is a little while that
[13:01] I will shake the heavens and the earth
[13:03] and the Sea and the dry land okay and
[13:05] then the desired Nations should come who
[13:07] knows who is the desire of all Nations
[13:10] Jesus Jesus is the desire of All Nation
[13:12] so God is going to shake all Heaven and
[13:15] Earth I believe that's during the
[13:17] tribulation period he's going to shake
[13:19] everything
[13:20] and then the desired Nations will come
[13:22] he comes to Armageddon
[13:24] right but then after the battle he burns
[13:27] over the Earth with uh either atomic
[13:29] fire or heavily fervent heat the Bible
[13:31] says and then we walk upon the ashes of
[13:34] the wicked
[13:35] Hallelujah
[13:36] look at verse 8 9 beautiful portion of
[13:38] scripture the silver is mine the Gold is
[13:40] mine saith the Lord of hosts they've got
[13:42] nothing to worry about right God's gonna
[13:44] put gold back on this house
[13:46] Hallelujah God's Gonna Make this House
[13:48] beautiful again it's all his anyway
[13:50] Hallelujah verse 9 and here's a great
[13:54] prophecy the glory of this latter house
[13:57] speaking of when he comes the desire of
[13:58] all Nations the millennium
[14:01] shall be greater than of the former
[14:03] saith the Lord of hosts and in this
[14:05] place will I give peace saith the Lord
[14:07] of hosts Hallelujah this has to be the
[14:10] Millennium because the Millennium is a
[14:12] thousand years apiece right this can't
[14:14] be the Rapture this can't be anything
[14:17] else this can't be the 144 000 because
[14:20] they don't have peace
[14:22] right the nations are coming after
[14:23] Israel during that time the Antichrist
[14:24] breaks his Covenant with Israel and
[14:26] leaves all of his armies down there
[14:28] against uh Israel this has to be the
[14:30] Millennium and so the holy spirit says
[14:33] through haggai
[14:34] the holy spirit says oh he said you owe
[14:37] men you owe generation don't be upset
[14:39] the glory of the latter house praise God
[14:42] the glory the Millennium will be way
[14:44] greater than Solomon's Glory oh just as
[14:47] Jesus greater than Solomon so will the
[14:49] millennial Temple be greater than
[14:50] Solomon's Temple
[14:52] oh there's so much grander church can I
[14:54] say like this the half has not been told
[14:56] amen how great Jesus's Temple the Jewish
[15:01] Israel Temple of Jesus during the
[15:03] Millennium shall be the Bible describes
[15:05] it in uh Ezekiel 38 and 39 if I'm not
[15:09] mistaken no 48 49 maybe sometime we'll
[15:11] preach on that by God's grace won't be
[15:13] tonight but maybe we'll preach on that
[15:14] later and so it's a grand description
[15:16] Hallelujah the glory and beauty of the
[15:18] millennial Temple
[15:20] okay
[15:21] so now here's a picture I want to show
[15:23] you too look up here uh here's like an
[15:25] American football field most of us kind
[15:27] of know what that been a football
[15:28] stadium
[15:29] Solomon's Temple was about
[15:31] a little over half about 60 of a
[15:33] football field with all the outer Court
[15:35] included so that would be like Solomon's
[15:38] Temple now when Herod rebuilt it
[15:41] I forgot how many years it took him I
[15:42] think it was
[15:44] they told us in the scriptures was it 40
[15:46] and six years remember when Jesus said
[15:48] you build this Temple I'll raise it up
[15:50] in three days I think it was 40 in six
[15:51] years
[15:52] so Herod built way more because he
[15:56] involved a women's court because
[15:58] remember he wanted to gain the favor of
[16:00] the Jews so he spent way more years
[16:02] Simon built his in seven years right I
[16:05] believe he built the temple in seven
[16:06] years if we're not mistaken
[16:08] and so Hera took 40 40 some years to
[16:12] build it even larger okay but this
[16:15] wasn't his Grand because remember this
[16:16] was covered in Gold this had those those
[16:19] lines that were covered in gold
[16:22] it had all the the brakes and altars and
[16:25] the labors of brass it was so many of
[16:27] them right it's been a while since I
[16:28] looked at it but you understand they're
[16:29] all all those great things that this was
[16:32] uh this was maybe bigger but not as
[16:34] splendid
[16:36] okay so you would picture his Rule's
[16:39] house was about that size but not as
[16:41] beautiful
[16:43] okay and so it made the older generation
[16:45] weep but God said I'm with you in church
[16:47] if God's with you with a church that's
[16:49] not as pretty as another one God's still
[16:51] with you God just say that don't be
[16:53] discouraged God's with you I'll say it
[16:55] like this whether you're in a big church
[16:57] or a small Church you don't have to be
[16:58] discouraged as long as God is with you
[17:00] praise God that's what counts Hallelujah
[17:03] like I would like when I was in the
[17:04] message I gone to a little bit a couple
[17:06] bigger churches than this of course
[17:08] I had different a couple different Pat
[17:10] or yeah one different Pastor brother
[17:11] Brooks there's maybe 100 150 in that
[17:14] church
[17:15] but it doesn't matter as long as God's
[17:16] with us we learn of the grace of God we
[17:19] grow in the grace of God the holy
[17:20] spirit's here as long as we draw an eye
[17:22] to God God will draw an eye to us
[17:24] hallelujah
[17:25] amen
[17:27] now let's read the rest of this chapter
[17:29] here go to back to Zechariah 4.
[17:32] because it's highly prophetic
[17:36] and I forgot to set a timer here but
[17:38] that's all right let's finish the
[17:40] chapter there's only about six or seven
[17:42] more verses here
[17:44] and I don't think I'll spend much time
[17:45] on this because I do want to get down to
[17:47] the uh the meaning of Grace Grace
[17:50] verse eight moreover the word of the
[17:52] Lord came unto me say
[17:54] the hands of zerubel had laid the
[17:56] foundation of this house his hands shall
[17:59] also finish it
[18:02] remember what was this house or type of
[18:04] it was a forerunner a witch house the
[18:07] millennial house so who deservable type
[18:09] Christ
[18:10] right Christ is the first and the last
[18:13] amen hallelujah
[18:15] laid the first Cornerstone and drewable
[18:18] will lay the final Stone The Headstone
[18:20] that's a type of first and last Alpha
[18:24] Omega Jesus Christ
[18:27] if he started it he'll finish it
[18:31] Jesus started a walk with in your life
[18:33] with you he'll finish it Hallelujah I
[18:36] love that that's good and thou shalt
[18:38] know that the Lord of hosts has set me
[18:40] unto you that's how you'll know they
[18:43] have small things now look at that God
[18:44] rebukes them he rebukes that older
[18:46] generation why do you despise the day of
[18:49] small things and church isn't that what
[18:50] we have we have a day of the most
[18:52] deception
[18:53] we have a day of less people being saved
[18:56] right right the age of the open door was
[18:58] the Philadelphian Church age
[19:00] but should we despise the fact that God
[19:02] called us to serve God in this age no
[19:05] we should Rejoice because God's with us
[19:08] hallelujah
[19:10] even if we only save a few Souls praise
[19:12] God God will honor us praise God as long
[19:15] as we say it all we could say God will
[19:17] honor us hallelujah
[19:19] and the Holy Spirit rebukes the older
[19:21] generation why do you despise small
[19:23] things
[19:24] for they shall rejoice and see the
[19:26] plummet in the hand observable with
[19:27] those seven for they are the eyes of the
[19:30] Lord which run to and fro through the
[19:33] whole world
[19:34] of course he's speaking of the prophets
[19:37] right those seven candlesticks right
[19:39] speaking of the two prophets those two
[19:41] candlesticks we'll see represent haggai
[19:43] and Zechariah
[19:45] and then the Holy Spirit they were
[19:46] preaching with went through the whole
[19:48] earth right that anointing goes through
[19:50] all the Earth looking for someone that
[19:52] wants to serve God
[19:54] and what do those prophets do they give
[19:56] they give grace to the believer but they
[19:58] give judgment to the unbeliever
[20:00] right right they they uh the Holy Spirit
[20:02] rebukes evil leaders of Nations but the
[20:05] holy spirit gives grace to the Jewish
[20:07] leaders right the Believers who want to
[20:09] repent and get right with God amen amen
[20:11] oh it's beautiful verse 11. that
[20:14] answered I and said unto him what are
[20:15] these two olive trees upon the right
[20:17] side of the Candlestick and upon them
[20:20] left side thereof and answered him again
[20:22] and said unto him what be these two
[20:24] Olive branches which through the two
[20:26] golden pipes empty the golden oil out of
[20:28] themselves
[20:31] and he answered me and said no it's thou
[20:33] not what these be and I said no my Lord
[20:35] then he said these are the two anointed
[20:37] ones that stand by the lord of the whole
[20:39] earth Hallelujah all right now I
[20:42] couldn't find my picture I tried looking
[20:43] for it beforehand but anyways you have
[20:45] the menorah in the Middle with seven
[20:46] branches and you have two olive trees on
[20:49] both yeah one Olive Tree on both sides
[20:52] and the oils flowing from the trees into
[20:56] uh the menorah to so the menorah can
[20:59] give light
[21:00] Hallelujah and these two olive trees
[21:03] represent the two prophets
[21:06] because the anointing has to flow out of
[21:08] the prophets they got to be anointed
[21:09] just like Isaiah Isaiah said I didn't
[21:11] have anointing he said but then God set
[21:13] a coal on my lips amen and then he said
[21:15] now you go I'm sending you because the
[21:18] Holy Ghost has purified your mouth
[21:19] that's what we need preachers with pure
[21:21] mouths hallelujah hallelujah we need
[21:24] sisters with pure mouths Brothers with
[21:25] pure mouths children with pure mouths
[21:27] Hallelujah the Holy Ghost says touch
[21:29] their mouth and they'll say only what
[21:31] the Bible says hallelujah oh that's
[21:33] right beautiful
[21:35] okay now for time's sake I'm not gonna
[21:37] go through this there's a large portion
[21:40] in the church age book you're going to
[21:41] read it it's page 50 51 52. I'm just
[21:44] going to go to get go to this
[21:46] okay brother Ann said these olive trees
[21:49] represent in the Old Testament and New
[21:50] Testament
[21:52] we know they also represent haggai and
[21:55] Zachariah Corona Ezra 5 1.
[21:59] brother Adam said uh the brother man
[22:01] said the Candlestick represents the
[22:03] seven Church ages right but we also know
[22:05] there's a foreshadow in the in the Kings
[22:07] because we're Kings and three sons of
[22:09] God and I love how the Old Testament
[22:11] ends with Elijah Hallelujah just like
[22:13] John the Baptist just like the New
[22:15] Testament amen oh it's perfect
[22:17] right Solomon was a wise master builder
[22:19] wrote Bible books so did Paul Paul Paul
[22:21] himself said I was a wise master builder
[22:24] Hallelujah and he wrote much of the New
[22:26] Testament
[22:27] and then also these two olive trees now
[22:29] back to the olive trees they represent
[22:31] Moses and Elijah coming
[22:33] in Revelation 11 verse 1 through 6. and
[22:37] there's actually probably a few verses
[22:38] after that but mainly in verse six
[22:40] because it mentioned how they had the
[22:42] ministry of Moses and Elijah they can
[22:44] bring blood they can turn water to blood
[22:46] and they can also make it not rain for
[22:49] three and a half years same Ministry
[22:51] Moses same Ministry Elijah so it's
[22:54] either Mosin Elijah themselves or it's
[22:56] the anointing on two men brother Ram
[22:58] didn't know he didn't tell us right to
[23:00] the end so not every answer is on the
[23:02] tape but you know that Hallelujah I
[23:04] don't have to pre-chart on that so I
[23:05] made this image a few years ago
[23:08] so there's at least two symbols
[23:11] okay these two prophets are kind of like
[23:12] two golden candlesticks but remember in
[23:14] the vision there's only one golden
[23:16] Candlestick right
[23:17] and then there's two olive trees so this
[23:20] picture would actually be
[23:22] this picture actually needs to be
[23:23] changed it needs to be two two trees
[23:25] feeding into one candlestick
[23:28] I think there is a tree yeah I think
[23:29] there are trees there but they actually
[23:31] have two candlesticks I can see the
[23:32] branches over here there's branches but
[23:34] that picture was the best picture I
[23:36] could find because it showed two profits
[23:37] okay
[23:38] so it represents uh two olive trees
[23:43] okay now
[23:45] let's get to our text so back to
[23:46] Zechariah 4 here
[23:50] now I just want to kind of bring this
[23:52] down here
[23:56] now
[23:57] this is a beautiful scripture uh
[23:59] Zechariah 4 verse 6 then he answered and
[24:01] spoken to me saying this is the word of
[24:02] the Lord unto Rubble saying not by might
[24:04] nor by power but by my spirit saith the
[24:07] Lord of hosts
[24:08] so we'll stop right there
[24:10] God had to tell zruval you will not
[24:13] finish this house by your own might
[24:16] buy your own power
[24:17] by your own Spirit yeah you can't finish
[24:20] this building unless the Holy Spirit
[24:24] does it amen thank God Hallelujah what
[24:27] an encouragement church if anything gets
[24:29] done in our lives it's going to be the
[24:30] holy spirit that does it Hallelujah
[24:33] it won't because if we do it on our
[24:35] effort then we get the glory right but
[24:37] God will not share his glory with
[24:38] anybody praise God
[24:40] that's why I don't need to discourage
[24:41] sister Zuri and over the years you know
[24:43] I want to see more people say but you
[24:45] know I haven't gotten discouraged
[24:46] because if anybody saved God has to do
[24:49] it right right if God calls them they'll
[24:51] stay hallelujah or they'll go to a good
[24:53] church you know though if they leave our
[24:54] church that's fine but they'll serve God
[24:56] if God really calls him and they really
[24:58] love God and God's in that the god that
[25:01] started the work will finish the work
[25:03] praise God
[25:04] because I I pleaded with people I've
[25:06] done Bible studies with people I've
[25:08] driven to people's houses for Bible
[25:09] studies and I've labored hard but I
[25:12] can't make them believe they've got to
[25:14] believe Hallelujah God has to finish the
[25:17] work Hallelujah now we should plead with
[25:19] him the Bible says we should sigh and
[25:20] cry for the Abominations right
[25:22] we should plead we should beg God to
[25:24] save Souls we should we should beg God
[25:27] to forgive people their sins like
[25:28] Abraham beg God to spare lot right in
[25:30] his family we should do that but
[25:32] ultimately it's up to God hallelujah
[25:36] and so God has to tell us rule you will
[25:39] not finish this by yourself
[25:41] it will not be you it will be me
[25:44] Hallelujah the holy spirit will move
[25:47] Hallelujah it'll not be your might your
[25:50] power or your spirit it has to be the
[25:52] Holy Spirit praise God now shouties now
[25:55] verse seven who art thou o great
[25:57] Mountain so this this fear that had this
[26:01] fear that had gripped them was like a
[26:02] mountain they were facing
[26:04] like it doesn't seem like that like our
[26:06] government lives like a mountain
[26:07] right it doesn't seem like you know the
[26:09] coveted restrictions was like a mountain
[26:11] you know all that there and now all
[26:14] their recession isn't it and they're uh
[26:16] some people say it's a silent depression
[26:18] right now that's what some people say
[26:19] because everything's so expensive right
[26:20] they say it's like a silent now it's not
[26:22] that way where lots of people are losing
[26:23] drugs jobs I'd say it's a silent
[26:25] recession
[26:26] everything is so much more expensive but
[26:28] doesn't it seem like a mountain how am I
[26:30] ever going to get ahead how am I going
[26:31] to say how am I going to invest in
[26:33] and those are just natural things we
[26:35] have to we have to be concerned about as
[26:37] long as we're living here right we've
[26:38] got to plant our potatoes but we're able
[26:40] to live like uh the rapture's gonna be
[26:42] in 10 years he said but spiritually uh
[26:45] you know I'm sorry work like it's going
[26:47] to be in 10 years but spiritually be
[26:48] ready this hour okay
[26:51] but here you know we see it
[26:53] it was a great Mountain so the
[26:55] government the fear the government was a
[26:56] great Mountain
[26:58] and the Holy Spirit says who are you
[27:00] Mountain I like that God challenges the
[27:03] enemy amen who are you right and we can
[27:05] say the same who are you sickness right
[27:08] who are you depression right
[27:11] right who are you White House amen
[27:15] who are you
[27:16] the Bible says o great Mountain
[27:18] the holy spirit says before before God's
[27:21] man before his removable Thou shalt
[27:23] become a plane amen Hallelujah the holy
[27:27] spirit will take this mountain and
[27:29] totally crush it
[27:31] and clear off the playing field so
[27:33] there's no more obstacle it's clear
[27:36] sailing hallelujah it's easy traveling
[27:38] Hallelujah the obstacles out of the way
[27:40] and the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit
[27:43] challenges that enemy that obstacle and
[27:46] says I will move you it won't be as
[27:48] removable that can move a mountain we
[27:49] can't move a mountain but God's word
[27:51] moves a mountain Hallelujah and Jesus
[27:54] Echoes this in the gospels right and he
[27:56] said speak to the mountain if you don't
[27:58] doubt he said that mountain will have to
[28:00] move hallelujah
[28:02] amen thank God
[28:04] what a blessing I love this because now
[28:07] we can see the same spirit that spoke to
[28:09] Zechariah was the Same Spirit of Jesus
[28:12] Hallelujah because both of them speak to
[28:14] Mountains and the mountains have to move
[28:16] praise God now what we need today is
[28:18] seek God until we get our next speaking
[28:20] of the mountain right right we spoke to
[28:22] the mountain for zern who is Dad right
[28:24] we spoke to the mountain in some other
[28:26] situations in people's lives
[28:28] my friend uh Seth Atkinson's dad Tom we
[28:32] spoke to the mountain in that one
[28:34] uh Jose's relatives that couldn't have a
[28:36] child we spoke to the mountain in that
[28:38] one and so see we wait for God on the
[28:41] next time we speak to the mountain
[28:42] Hallelujah
[28:44] that's right but it's the same Jesus who
[28:45] spoke to Zechariah same Jesus said we
[28:49] can speak to the mountain but we gotta
[28:50] wait till he says to do it right
[28:52] Hallelujah
[28:54] he shall bring forth The Headstone so
[28:56] zerubul is going to bring forth his
[28:58] headstone he's gonna he's gonna guide
[29:00] The Headstone with all their machines
[29:01] their primitive machines right he's
[29:03] going to guide his headstone into place
[29:05] and set it down
[29:07] and it's gonna be it's gonna be set down
[29:09] with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto
[29:13] it
[29:14] amen so let's look versus shouting
[29:18] this shout this shoutings in Zechariah
[29:21] reminds me of the shout in first
[29:24] Thessalonians 4 16.
[29:26] why would he use the word Shout
[29:29] in other words the laying on this
[29:31] headstone is a type of the rapture
[29:33] and I'm gonna show you a few more verses
[29:35] on that to prove that
[29:36] I've always believed the Rapture is a
[29:39] three-step process the shout voice Trump
[29:42] now it could be something else you know
[29:44] Cam and Simon have shown me so many more
[29:45] quotes I've never seen before so the
[29:48] shout could be something else but I've
[29:49] always believed this I believe the shout
[29:50] was brother Ram's Ministry and then also
[29:53] now it's us we're shouting it out to the
[29:55] world I tell you it does shout through
[29:57] internet thank God for that yeah
[29:58] Hallelujah
[30:02] but the voice of the Archangel I believe
[30:06] with the voice of Michael that
[30:08] resurrects the dead in Christ
[30:11] because Satan disputed about the
[30:13] resurrected body of Moses with the
[30:15] archangel
[30:17] there's a connection between archangels
[30:19] and resurrected bodies
[30:21] that's all I have
[30:22] that's my best guess because the dead in
[30:25] Christ have to rise first
[30:28] but we know what the Trump is
[30:30] the Bible says the Trump of God is when
[30:32] the death is swallowed up in Victory and
[30:35] our bodies are changed and we meet the
[30:37] Saints in the air praise God
[30:39] we know that that's clear happens in a
[30:42] twinkling of an eye somebody asked about
[30:43] that a few days ago was it Victoria
[30:45] somebody in our house asked about the
[30:47] twinkling of an eye it means just an
[30:49] instant
[30:49] the incident of a bat of an eye that's
[30:52] how fast that's how fast we'll be out of
[30:54] this past house amen into Glory that's
[30:57] how fast we'll see Jesus hallelujah oh
[30:59] my God what a moment what a moment to
[31:00] live for Hallelujah
[31:02] amen so I need to search some of those
[31:04] quotes but that's the best understanding
[31:06] and the reason I preached shout voice
[31:07] and Trump like that because that's what
[31:09] brother Ann taught in the sermon the
[31:10] Rapture 1965 but again he never said
[31:13] thus said the Lord it was the best it
[31:15] was the best teaching that I've seen
[31:16] this far
[31:17] okay but it was never thus saith the
[31:19] Lord
[31:20] so see the word shout struck me I'm like
[31:22] oh wow that's right shoutings of Grace
[31:26] and the Bible said the Lord himself
[31:27] shall descend from heaven with his shout
[31:29] and notice zerubov was there and there
[31:32] was a shout and threwable time too
[31:33] Christ
[31:36] right so the Lord descends with a shout
[31:38] here's removable ascends he ascends to
[31:41] the top of the the temple and he lays
[31:44] the stone with shoutings
[31:46] so we see a shout
[31:48] hallelujah oh also the other shout was
[31:50] when Rahab was saved out of Jericho
[31:54] there was a shout and there was a
[31:55] trumpet
[31:57] and she represents the Gentile bride
[31:59] being saved before the world is
[32:01] destroyed amen right there it's right
[32:04] there there's two types
[32:05] you have rehab being saved there's
[32:07] shouts there
[32:08] they shouted and then they blew the
[32:10] trumpet and now you have zerubel laying
[32:13] the I'm sorry The Headstone and their
[32:16] shoutings and then brother random says
[32:18] this is a type of the rapture
[32:19] okay again we don't save the Lord but it
[32:22] sure is a really good type it's a
[32:24] beautiful type
[32:25] okay so it looks like shoutings
[32:28] with Grace speaks of the shout of the
[32:30] rapture
[32:32] now how about Grace Grace
[32:34] and I got a few different thoughts on
[32:36] that remember for zero Grace Grace meant
[32:39] you you had Grace to get here but you
[32:42] needed extra Grace to finish the job
[32:43] amen amen 16 years you you struggle with
[32:48] with fear and battles and everything but
[32:51] God gave you extra Grace to send you two
[32:53] prophets two olive trees amen with oil
[32:56] that gave you light it gave you the
[32:58] light of the church ages hallelujah amen
[33:02] there's something good in there
[33:03] in there I gotta study that out more so
[33:05] it could mean this Grace Grace So this
[33:08] this headphone is in place with Grace
[33:10] Grace
[33:12] so the Grace Grace could mean former
[33:15] rain later rain it could mean that right
[33:18] right because you get two measures of
[33:19] Grace to finish the job
[33:21] right just like the two uh Banquets
[33:24] Esther put on remember that it wasn't
[33:26] one banquet it wasn't three Banquets it
[33:28] was two
[33:29] former ladder
[33:31] here we have Grace Grace not just one
[33:33] Grace two Graces yeah
[33:35] yeah and we know church we know there's
[33:36] there's no Bible doctrine that says God
[33:38] gives a double portion of Grace like
[33:40] there's there's no more there's no Bible
[33:41] doctrine of that like
[33:43] God just gives us Grace but it shows
[33:45] that God has to pour out his grace again
[33:48] or his his Spirit again and help the
[33:51] people finish the work
[33:53] hallelujah amen oh it's beautiful and I
[33:56] love this verse I thought this verse
[33:57] while I was coming to church remember
[33:59] this it's been a while since I preached
[34:00] this this is a beautiful verse because
[34:02] people say I'm under grace I don't have
[34:05] to live holy I'm saved by grace well
[34:07] what about this verse
[34:08] for the grace of God that brings
[34:10] salvation has appeared to all men
[34:12] teaching us that what does grace teach
[34:14] that we should deny ungodliness we
[34:17] should deny cigarettes
[34:18] deny alcohol deny drugs deny dirty shows
[34:23] denying worldly lust we should live
[34:26] soberly righteously Godly in this
[34:28] present world so Grace teaches live a
[34:31] holy life amen and that that lines up
[34:34] with Romans six I'm going to get them
[34:35] back back to that eventually
[34:37] Romans 6 says should we continue in sin
[34:39] that Grace May abound God forbid
[34:42] right don't continue sitting on purpose
[34:45] just because you know you're saved by
[34:46] grace stop sinning the best you can amen
[34:49] show your appreciation for Grace amen
[34:53] live soberly righteously Godly in this
[34:56] present world show people what a real
[34:58] Christian looks like Hallelujah amen
[35:02] Grace teaches you should look for that
[35:04] blessed hope the Glorious appearing of
[35:06] the great God and our Savior Jesus
[35:08] Christ
[35:10] who gave himself for us that he might
[35:12] redeem us from all iniquity and purify
[35:15] unto himself of peculiar people zealous
[35:17] of good works I'll tell you we're
[35:18] looking the more I see this
[35:20] Administration this White House body
[35:22] Administration the more I see them
[35:24] arrest Christians the more I know Jesus
[35:26] is coming soon
[35:27] because when you start touching the
[35:29] bride of Christ when you start doing
[35:30] persecutions like this Jesus is coming
[35:33] back yeah right and think and remember
[35:35] before he before uh uh the Beast can
[35:38] touch the whole the whole nation and
[35:41] group of Christians Jesus come back and
[35:42] rescue us hallelujah that's what he
[35:45] promised I'll keep you from that hour of
[35:47] Temptation that'll come upon the whole
[35:49] world
[35:51] now why should we look for his coming
[35:52] because he gave himself for us that he
[35:55] might redeem us from all of our iniquity
[35:57] see we can still get victory over our
[35:59] sins
[36:00] right or bad habits our our addictions
[36:03] we can still get victory over that why
[36:05] because he come to buy us out of that
[36:07] Hallelujah
[36:09] and he came to purify unto himself a
[36:11] peculiar people zealous of good works
[36:14] God wants people that are ready to fast
[36:16] ready to pray ready to give alms
[36:19] ready to go to church ready to worship
[36:21] Hallelujah
[36:23] amen he wants people that are zealous
[36:26] and ready to do it
[36:27] okay so it could mean that it could mean
[36:29] this
[36:30] Grace Grace could mean former Knight of
[36:32] Rage it could be a Grace that brings us
[36:34] to this uh this condition where we're
[36:38] ready for the coming of the Lord
[36:39] it could mean a third thing it could
[36:41] mean God is more gracious at the end
[36:44] time it could mean that because the
[36:45] Bible says in James 4 5
[36:47] do you think that the scripture saith in
[36:49] vain the spirit that dwelleth in US lust
[36:51] is to Envy but he giveth more grace
[36:54] this is speaking God gives more grace
[36:57] to people that rebel against him
[37:00] right think about how many chances did
[37:02] Saul get King Saul got so many chances
[37:05] of Grace
[37:06] David got so many chances of Grace did
[37:08] he not Moses got so many chances of
[37:11] Grace
[37:12] yes and so the Bible says the same is
[37:14] true in the New Testament God gives more
[37:16] Grace I'm actually glad you get more
[37:17] grace
[37:20] wherefore he says God resists the proud
[37:22] but he giveth grace to the humble so we
[37:24] just got to say Jesus I'm sorry forgive
[37:26] me I fell short of your glory I know
[37:28] you'll give me more grace
[37:30] submit yourselves therefore to God
[37:31] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[37:34] so you just got to say Satan get behind
[37:36] me I'm not going to say those words I'm
[37:37] not going to think those thoughts I'm
[37:39] not going to go there again I'm not
[37:40] going to buy that again I'm not going to
[37:42] do that again I'm going to live holy
[37:43] praise God
[37:45] draw an eye to God that restaurant come
[37:47] to church read your Bible pray
[37:48] Hallelujah go to special meetings and He
[37:51] will draw an eye to you cleanse your
[37:53] hands ye Sinners purify your hearts you
[37:55] double-minded hallelujah amen oh I love
[37:58] this verse aren't you glad he gives you
[38:00] more grace hallelujah amen that's what I
[38:02] need church that's what I need more
[38:03] grace
[38:04] it could mean because you're Abraham's
[38:07] seed he gives you more grace like
[38:09] Abraham got a lot of Grace remember
[38:11] those six red dots on that chart I
[38:13] showed
[38:14] six red dots right all his mistakes no
[38:19] doubt he's sitting every day too so he
[38:20] can put all he could put a dot through
[38:22] every chapter in there
[38:24] but the Bible says
[38:27] the law Works wrath where the law is
[38:30] there's no trans I'm sorry no law is
[38:32] there's no transgression therefore the
[38:34] promises of God are by faith that it
[38:36] might be by grace to the end the promise
[38:39] might be sure to all the seed not to
[38:42] that only which is of the law but to us
[38:44] also which is of the faith of Abraham
[38:46] who is the father of us all
[38:48] right if your father struggled
[38:50] but yet overcame the same is true for
[38:53] you
[38:54] amen now for my children it's
[38:55] spiritually and naturally spiritual
[38:57] Abraham and not me your natural father
[39:01] but I'm talking everybody else here if
[39:03] Abraham struggled yet God was with him
[39:05] God will be with you despite your
[39:07] struggles Hallelujah that's what the
[39:09] Bible says the promise has to be by
[39:12] faith not by law but by Grace Hallelujah
[39:15] because no man or woman can keep it on
[39:17] their own hallelujah oh my whatever no
[39:20] wonder every time brother Ram got
[39:21] discouraged he went read Romans chapter
[39:23] four he said every time a little blue
[39:25] I'll go read Romans chapter 4. Abraham
[39:28] was strong in faith giving God glory
[39:30] Abraham staggered not the promise of God
[39:32] I can say the same tonight a sister who
[39:34] a stagger is not the promise of god
[39:36] sister sir doesn't stagger at the
[39:38] promise of God right Lydia does not
[39:41] stagger at the promise of God now God
[39:43] doesn't stagger but he's strong in faith
[39:45] given God Glory Hallelujah amen that's
[39:47] what the Bible says because he forgives
[39:49] all your trespasses
[39:51] oh it's so true it's so true it's the
[39:54] Bible
[39:57] no
[39:58] let me read and I'm closing with this
[40:00] like this maybe take five minutes we'll
[40:01] see maybe 10.
[40:03] here's all the quotes the brother
[40:05] Randolph said Grace Grace
[40:06] so here's the quotes of brother Hammer
[40:08] he he Likens Grace unto the rapture
[40:13] so it's Ruble think about that Drupal
[40:14] grabbing that last stone with the ropes
[40:16] tied to it and placing it down and no
[40:19] doubt he's getting it right in place
[40:20] right so the the stone has no overlap
[40:23] it's not you know it's not sticking out
[40:24] the stone isn't sticking out on the
[40:26] corner but it's perfectly lined up
[40:28] that stone coming back oh it's like that
[40:30] stone out of the mountain in Daniel
[40:32] chapter Two amen hallelujah who is that
[40:35] someone that came back and smote the
[40:36] image that was Christ Hallelujah amen
[40:39] and here we have another Stone taking
[40:41] its place who's that stone Jesus Christ
[40:43] Hallelujah oh my oh it's beautiful I've
[40:47] never seen that tell that the two stones
[40:49] the stone in Daniel 2 and the stone here
[40:52] and Zechariah Chapter Four beautiful
[40:55] and church remember who's the
[40:57] Cornerstone Christ we're gonna see that
[40:59] a little bit who's The Headstone Christ
[41:03] the first and last but who's in between
[41:05] those two stones you and I and the Seven
[41:08] Church ages
[41:09] Saint Paul's in there right
[41:12] Paul iranius right Mark Martin Columbo
[41:17] Martin Luther John Wesley brother Brown
[41:19] and you all of us we're all those stones
[41:22] but Jesus is the first stone Jesus is
[41:25] the last Stone hallelujah oh that's what
[41:28] we're waiting for we're waiting for
[41:29] Christ to return amen
[41:32] so program reads what we read Zechariah
[41:34] 4 then he says
[41:38] he says uh yeah Grace Grace unto it okay
[41:41] now look what he says next right after
[41:43] this now this is the message of Grace if
[41:44] you haven't listened to that that's a
[41:45] beautiful message he just shows Grace in
[41:48] everybody's life they start with Adam
[41:49] and Eve and and Moses and Noah everybody
[41:52] had Grace
[41:53] everybody Made It by Grace they didn't
[41:56] make it by their goodness they made it
[41:57] by the grace of God and brother I said
[41:59] no wonder I've always been a man of
[42:00] Grace
[42:01] no wonder I've always been a preacher of
[42:04] Grace Hallelujah you too a believer of
[42:06] Grace because we all need it right
[42:10] mother says we're all acquainted with
[42:12] this scripture that reads the Bible we
[42:14] know that this was during the time of
[42:15] the preparation of the restoration of
[42:16] the temple and zeruba was a great Prince
[42:18] among the people who had laid the
[42:20] foundation of the building now you I
[42:22] want you to put on your spiritual
[42:23] thinking he said put on your anointing
[42:25] jacket this morning as we think
[42:29] and this great Prince had determined to
[42:31] rebuild the house of the Lord and then
[42:32] when he did he had laid the foundation
[42:34] stone and we read on further we find out
[42:37] that God said three of us laid the
[42:38] foundation with his hands he'll also
[42:40] bring forth The Headstone I want you to
[42:42] notice he never said bring forth the
[42:43] Cornerstone he said bring forth the
[42:45] headstone
[42:47] so his Roomba will lay the Cornerstone
[42:49] and now he also he's going to bring
[42:51] forth the headstone
[42:53] and we know that the scripture says
[42:55] Jesus Christ is the Chief Cornerstone
[42:57] right he's also the headstone now if we
[43:01] think for a few minutes that the seven
[43:02] Church age messenger now look here it is
[43:05] so as soon as he says head Sony goes
[43:08] right to the seven Church age messenger
[43:09] that's brother Brandon
[43:12] he was to restore the faith of the
[43:14] children back to the fathers in other
[43:15] words rebuild the church again under the
[43:18] power of the spirit
[43:19] amen so what is removable rebuilding the
[43:21] temple it shows God had to rebuild the
[43:24] church the New Testament Church right
[43:26] they lost the revelation of the godhead
[43:27] they lost the revelation of serpent seed
[43:30] they lost all these Revelations so God
[43:32] had to restore it just like cerebral had
[43:34] to rebuild it Hallelujah God hadn't used
[43:37] brother random of course you know Martin
[43:38] Luther and John Wesleyan and uh William
[43:41] Seymour at the gifts of the Spirit God
[43:43] had to use all them but Brethren was
[43:44] included and restore it all back
[43:46] together he had to rebuild the church
[43:48] Hallelujah
[43:49] amen that's a great thought
[43:51] just like the temple had to be rebuilt
[43:53] so does the church need to be rebuilt
[43:55] where upon the word of God right there's
[43:58] always been Church buildings God's not
[44:00] trying to be rebuild a church building
[44:01] God's trying to build the spiritual
[44:04] understanding of the church back
[44:05] together
[44:06] Hallelujah
[44:08] he said not by power not by might not by
[44:10] my he said but by my spirit say the Lord
[44:12] not an organization right I was
[44:14] Assemblies of God we have
[44:16] um Christian Missionary Alliance right
[44:18] we have all these uh denominations
[44:19] represented here
[44:21] Jose was in I think a Catholic he's a
[44:23] that was a domination
[44:26] Brother Ray was a Catholic he's not here
[44:28] tonight but just he said God doesn't
[44:30] build it by denomination but by the Holy
[44:32] Spirit God will bring forth the church
[44:34] in the last days amen that's right
[44:37] zero the prince with Joshua was the one
[44:40] that was to bring forth this headstone
[44:41] he has laid the foundation he took the
[44:43] people back to the foundation in time
[44:45] which we all know that these
[44:46] candlesticks and so forth represent both
[44:48] Jewish and church they were Olive
[44:51] branches the Bible said here the Olive
[44:52] Branch Where the wild branch that was
[44:55] grafted in the root of the tame Olive
[44:56] Tree Gentiles and out of these two
[44:59] branches come sensor pipes going into
[45:01] the seven golden candlesticks to give
[45:03] light to the seven churches now I just
[45:05] caught that now I missed that
[45:06] so brother half says one of the olive
[45:08] trees was a wild Olive Tree and one of
[45:10] them was just a plain Olive Tree the
[45:12] wild one is the Gentiles I don't know if
[45:14] I can prove that I don't know if that
[45:15] was in there up to look that up
[45:17] it just says two olive trees
[45:19] yes I don't know for sure
[45:21] it just says two hours I'll have to look
[45:23] up if there's the word wild in there but
[45:24] it could be I guess it could be Gentile
[45:26] and June right because there's two could
[45:28] be
[45:30] all right
[45:32] but now according to prophecy there will
[45:34] come The Headstone and I want you to
[45:35] notice that when The Headstone comes the
[45:37] prince is going to cry out the message
[45:38] will cry out Grace Grace Force by grace
[45:41] are we saved not of works as any man
[45:43] should boast and the message of Grace
[45:45] has been tramped under the feet of men
[45:47] until it's become a disgrace
[45:49] some of them runs out into internal
[45:50] security so eternal security is is like
[45:53] this if you said a prayer and you you
[45:55] you're saved you can't lose your
[45:56] salvation no matter how filthy you live
[45:58] now that's a lie that's too far right
[46:00] right there has to be some fruit of your
[46:03] salvation like the thief on the cross he
[46:05] was a thief but what'd he do he repented
[46:07] at the end
[46:09] right
[46:10] right so a man like Elvis Presley it
[46:12] doesn't look like he repented he died on
[46:14] a toilet you know what died with drug
[46:16] overdose and satanic Magic books doesn't
[46:20] look like he repented
[46:23] he said some runs out onto oh everything
[46:25] but the true message of Grace Remains
[46:27] the Same there's where Satan tries to
[46:29] knock it out from the church but it's by
[46:30] grace that we're all saved by we got
[46:32] theologians saying doctor is a divinity
[46:35] great smart men educated all over the
[46:37] world that's smart intelligent educated
[46:39] but it takes the Simplicity of believing
[46:40] God to make his word speak out to show
[46:43] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[46:44] today and forever I love this it takes a
[46:46] humble Heart Church dedicated to God to
[46:49] bring Jesus and into present tense
[46:52] amen right I've said this before you've
[46:54] heard me say it amongst my friends that
[46:56] are not in the message that are
[46:57] Christians
[46:58] I've never heard greater testimonies
[47:00] than the testimonies amongst our church
[47:01] and our believers in other words I've
[47:04] seen more Supernatural amongst message
[47:06] people than denominational people
[47:09] right and that makes sense because we
[47:11] should be the real humble ones because
[47:13] we believe all the Bible
[47:17] I heard good testimonies but I've never
[47:19] heard his powerful testimony says what
[47:20] we have amongst us
[47:22] that's just my that's my own personal
[47:24] testimony
[47:27] right and I include that all the message
[47:28] churches where they've had they've had
[47:30] women who had no hair grow back an
[47:32] entire head of hair
[47:33] they've had cancer is he a leukemia is
[47:35] healed right you know I put all of them
[47:36] in there because we're brothers some of
[47:39] those preachers are preaching our church
[47:40] brother Joe Adams is one of them he told
[47:43] the testimony actually when he was here
[47:44] last time years ago we're gonna have
[47:46] Lord willing have him back
[47:48] if it's taken theology that that what
[47:51] would the Presbyterian Methodist Baptist
[47:53] Catholic and so forth they wouldn't have
[47:55] it he wouldn't have a chance of us poor
[47:57] unlearned people but it doesn't take
[47:59] knowledge not by might not by power but
[48:02] by my spirit God said I'll unfold this
[48:05] mystery so now he connects grace to the
[48:09] mysteries of God first he connected to
[48:12] Malachi four five and six I'll turn your
[48:14] hearts back to the fathers and now he
[48:16] connects it to Revelation 10 7 finishing
[48:18] the mysteries of God
[48:20] his ministry
[48:22] he will cry to it Grace Grace with
[48:24] shoutings and crying that's what it is
[48:25] today God's Amazing Grace to his people
[48:27] how he takes the illiterate unlearned
[48:30] and shows them Jesus is the same amen
[48:32] amen glory
[48:34] now a new sermon he said God has taken
[48:36] the elect out of the Pentecostal Church
[48:38] pulling it out finishing up the word
[48:40] it's got to be so closer to the word
[48:42] itself will blend with this word
[48:44] then the headstones come crying Grace
[48:46] Grace Amazing Grace the headstone
[48:50] here you are like this see how it way
[48:52] down here it keeps getting closer closer
[48:54] to the ministry after a while here comes
[48:56] Luther justification Justified here come
[48:58] Leslie Sanctified bunch here come
[49:00] Pentecost the restoration of the gifts
[49:01] now God is taking from there honing out
[49:03] a bunch to make a Ministry just exactly
[49:06] like that word there because it's got to
[49:08] fit with the word there's the bride take
[49:10] her up hallelujah amen so we have to
[49:13] have a Ministry that matches the
[49:15] ministry of Jesus Christ
[49:17] Luther had a powerful testimony Wesley
[49:20] had a powerful testimony I read you uh
[49:23] William Seymour had a powerful testimony
[49:26] but they were lacking some of the Bible
[49:28] now what we've got we've got the Bible
[49:30] now we need some of those powerful
[49:31] testimonies right we talked about that
[49:34] we need more power and I believe God
[49:36] will send it we've got to be patient we
[49:37] can't make God do anything we can ask we
[49:39] can seek we got to wait on God
[49:41] Hallelujah we got to keep trusting God
[49:43] it's not by our might it's by God's
[49:46] spirit
[49:48] the Lutheran justification he's like it
[49:50] represents like feet Wesley
[49:52] sanctification Pentecostals under the
[49:54] arms
[49:56] he said uh now we come to the Head
[49:59] Capstone Grace Grace the Capstone cried
[50:02] so brother man kind of Likens uh
[50:05] uh you know the the last three Church
[50:08] ages to like God building a body right
[50:11] Luther's defeat and then we're the head
[50:14] so Wesley must be somewhere in here
[50:17] Hallelujah
[50:19] The Headstone crying what Grace Grace
[50:21] passed from death and Creed into a
[50:23] Living Word of the Living God
[50:26] Hallelujah that's what I told uh I'll
[50:28] just say his name I just write to our
[50:30] brother cool a number of years ago I
[50:32] said I said uh I appreciate your church
[50:35] brother I said it to my mom too I said I
[50:38] appreciate the church mom but you're
[50:39] living off bylaws and your bylaws don't
[50:42] have all the Bible in them
[50:44] so you're living off a Creed you've got
[50:46] to come out of Creeds and bylaws and
[50:48] you've got to come into the word of God
[50:50] I say that with love I said it was love
[50:52] Hallelujah
[50:55] a Living Word of the Living God God's
[50:57] only provided plan for his age his sons
[50:59] in the word age quickened by the spirit
[51:01] like a spark that's lit off something to
[51:03] make it alive how many got a sparked for
[51:05] God tonight eight in the head Hallelujah
[51:08] we got to have a spark of Life something
[51:10] that sets us apart something that puts
[51:13] us on fire Hallelujah amen
[51:19] he said we're seated now in Heavenly
[51:21] places present tense already alive and
[51:23] subject to every promise in the word and
[51:25] what does it do you being a part of
[51:26] God's Gene a part of the word other men
[51:29] a part of God's word seated together
[51:31] manifest the entire body of Christ
[51:33] because there's no leaven among you
[51:35] no love and among you just the word only
[51:37] seen in Heavenly places is the door
[51:39] where he puts his name Christ Jesus
[51:43] see so the closer we get to the Rapture
[51:45] the more we're gonna have God's grace to
[51:48] get rid of our sinfulness
[51:49] right we're going to get closer to God
[51:52] Hallelujah
[51:54] and then right before he comes we're
[51:55] going to have a fresh anointing that's
[51:57] going to make us even more holy
[51:59] we'll still sin but I don't know how
[52:01] long we'll go without sitting maybe
[52:02] we'll go days without sinning wouldn't
[52:04] that be awesome we'll have the anointing
[52:06] a rapturing faith
[52:07] Hallelujah because this last the last
[52:11] Stone has to match the headstone
[52:13] so the words Christ The Rapture is The
[52:15] Headstone but we're that last Stone
[52:17] where that last Stone
[52:19] and it's got to fit perfectly and it
[52:21] will because of the anointing praise God
[52:23] the holy in other words the holy spirit
[52:25] will bring our lives to where they need
[52:26] to be just like the day of Pentecost the
[52:29] Holy Ghost brought the lives of those
[52:30] those 120 they had to be praying for 10
[52:33] days
[52:34] well what is God going to do for us if
[52:36] we're going to go in the rapture
[52:38] they just went from law to Grace what is
[52:40] God going to do for us if we're going to
[52:41] go from this world to the meeting in the
[52:43] air praise God yeah what is God going to
[52:45] do for us I'm excited I don't know but
[52:47] I'm excited Hallelujah
[52:50] it's got to be something great
[52:52] because that stone Jesus Christ has to
[52:54] match the final Stone right
[52:58] all right and I'm posing with that let
[53:00] me just read this here
[53:03] now here's what I want to close it I
[53:05] just put that Abraham video out uh
[53:06] yesterday
[53:07] it's just an encouragement to you God
[53:10] proved his body change promises to Abram
[53:12] M Sarah even though Abraham and Sarah
[53:15] both laughed when God said I'm going to
[53:17] give you
[53:18] a child through you Abraham and Sarah
[53:20] they both laughed even though they both
[53:22] laughed at the body change promised God
[53:25] still brought it to pass
[53:26] God made them believe it amen
[53:29] and I apply that to our body change the
[53:32] Rapture God is going to make us believe
[53:34] it
[53:35] right when we see dead ones come back to
[53:36] life probably when we see Paul or
[53:38] brother random or Martin we're going to
[53:40] believe Hallelujah
[53:42] how do we know because we're already
[53:43] believing what they preached Hallelujah
[53:46] Paul preached the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:47] baptism the godheads one person
[53:49] Hallelujah the promises of God the
[53:52] Miracles the gifts of the Spirit that we
[53:53] all believe in praise God
[53:55] Paul preached all those things and so
[53:57] we're preaching his message so God I'm
[54:00] trusting God will do the same for us he
[54:03] will prove that the body change is for
[54:05] us because we're Abraham seed we have
[54:08] faith in Jesus Christ and the real Jesus
[54:09] Christ not a denominational Jesus Christ
[54:12] but the Jesus Christ of the Bible
[54:13] Hallelujah who's here tonight praise God
[54:15] let's say to our feet
[54:18] God I thought I'd preach a little
[54:20] shorter there by the grace of God
[54:23] back to school courson I was sick I
[54:26] didn't have no I feel like I got energy
[54:27] now but I know that's a little uh
[54:29] adrenaline there but maybe the Holy
[54:31] Spirit and I believe God Can Heal Me
[54:33] thoroughly tonight but I don't want to
[54:34] take any chances here
[54:36] that's a good enough message tell me
[54:37] enjoy that tonight
[54:38] so it's been over 10 years since I
[54:40] preached that verse
[54:42] so I thought I would preach it again
[54:44] what encouragement I may preach again on
[54:46] this on Sunday to kind of bring it out
[54:47] to the whole church but it's such a
[54:49] blessing I was so blessed I heard the
[54:50] preacher say I'm like oh yeah that's
[54:52] right I forgot about that type and then
[54:54] it ties in with Rahab with a shout there
[54:56] it ties it with Abraham's body change
[54:59] it's a beautiful type there
[55:02] and so we are we're convinced I'm
[55:04] convinced by the Bible I'm sure you are
[55:05] too as brother Brandon was trying to
[55:07] convince us that Grace Grace represents
[55:10] the Rapture God giving us Grace for the
[55:12] Rapture for Christ that final headstone
[55:17] now while you're uh
[55:18] while you're standing let's read those
[55:20] verses on Christ the The Headstone here
[55:28] okay it's a
[55:31] Luke 20 verse 17. yeah do you want to
[55:34] put that out there because I unplugged
[55:35] this time thank you
[55:39] in Luke 2017 and he beheld him and said
[55:42] what is this then that is written the
[55:45] stone which the builders rejected the
[55:47] same has become the head of the corner
[55:49] Israel rejected Christ think about that
[55:51] they didn't want to build their Church
[55:52] on Jesus Christ they rejected him but we
[55:55] are built on Christ amen hallelujah
[55:57] hallelujah thank God my life your life
[56:01] our church is built on Jesus Christ amen
[56:04] we have not rejected him we've received
[56:06] him do we want to receive more yes
[56:08] there's more for us hallelujah amen but
[56:11] we have received them acts 4 11 honey we
[56:13] just got we'll just quickly go through
[56:15] these
[56:16] x411
[56:27] this is the stone which was set at not
[56:29] of you Builders which has become the
[56:31] head of the corner
[56:34] Hallelujah and don't forget I preached
[56:36] this a few years ago on Mother's Day for
[56:37] our sisters the Bible Likens a Godly
[56:40] woman to a Cornerstone that's quite a
[56:42] compliment for a woman
[56:44] God bless you
[56:45] a woman is compared to Jesus Christ as a
[56:48] Cornerstone
[56:50] sisters said don't you feel like that
[56:51] like all the stresses of your husband is
[56:54] on you don't you feel like you carry
[56:55] that load
[56:56] that's what the Bible says our sisters
[56:59] are like cornerstones sister Lena's like
[57:01] a Cornerstone now she got all the way to
[57:03] her husband right
[57:05] get all the way to your husband Lord
[57:07] willingness God blesses you with
[57:09] children
[57:10] you have all the way the children on you
[57:11] like when I was sick on Monday night who
[57:13] was all the weight on who was bringing
[57:15] me uh all those Herbal Remedies my wife
[57:18] right is all on her she started to get
[57:21] some supper ready she's got to do a lot
[57:23] I'm laying there in bed I can't even
[57:24] couldn't sleep for like 20 some hours in
[57:26] a row awful
[57:28] well probably that's probably the only
[57:29] migraine I've ever had in my life it was
[57:31] totally awful but who is the Cornerstone
[57:33] in my house my wife but who's the
[57:36] ultimate Cornerstone Jesus Christ right
[57:39] right remember Eve was a part of Adam
[57:41] the church is a part of Christ
[57:45] Ephesians 2 19.
[57:49] now therefore are ye No More Strangers
[57:52] and foreigners but you are fellow
[57:54] citizens with the Saints of the
[57:56] household of God here's what I was
[57:58] mentioned earlier and our bill upon the
[58:00] foundation of the Apostles and Prophets
[58:02] Jesus Christ being or himself being the
[58:05] Chief Cornerstone remember
[58:08] Jesus is the Cornerstone and Paul's like
[58:11] the foundation Stones next to the
[58:13] Cornerstone and you are standing on top
[58:15] of that amen hallelujah I'm not standing
[58:19] on his denomination I'm standing on
[58:21] Christ Hallelujah
[58:22] I'm standing on the apostles
[58:24] I'm standing on Peter I'm standing on
[58:27] James and John I'm standing on them
[58:30] thank God they live their lives because
[58:31] now I can stand on their lives right and
[58:34] if there's another generation my
[58:35] children can stand on my life my
[58:37] testimony
[58:38] if God Terry's another generation
[58:41] go to verse 21 in whom all the building
[58:44] fitly frame together growth unto a holy
[58:47] Temple of the Lord and whom ye also are
[58:49] built together for habitation of God
[58:51] through the spirit Hallelujah
[58:54] so Jesus is the Cornerstone that first
[58:56] stone and then Paul Peter James Young
[58:58] all the seven Church ages and now you
[59:01] are this part of this final Seven Stone
[59:04] the Bible said you're not a deadstone
[59:06] you're a Lively Stone
[59:08] you're just not a dead formal church
[59:10] member but no God's spirit is living in
[59:12] you amen like these these walls they
[59:14] don't sing out right they're part of the
[59:16] building they don't sing out they're not
[59:17] alive but you and I do we're like stones
[59:20] we're like stones that are living we're
[59:22] like uh we're like we We join the
[59:25] worship we're not separate from the
[59:26] worship we're a part of the worship God
[59:29] lives through US amen we're the building
[59:30] of God
[59:32] imagine if these walls could sing would
[59:34] that be awesome right
[59:36] that's what that's what the body of
[59:37] Christ is like it's like a temple where
[59:39] even the stones can sing even the stones
[59:42] can say praise God hallelujah amen thank
[59:45] God
[59:46] Jesus said if they don't cry out even
[59:48] these stones will cry
[59:50] Hallelujah so we're the spiritual stones
[59:52] that are crying out giving glory to God
[59:54] Almighty amen amen
[59:59] so again Jesus is the Cornerstone all
[1:00:02] the Believers are the stones in the in
[1:00:04] the temple and then Jesus Christ is The
[1:00:06] Headstone he comes down in the Rapture
[1:00:08] and they're shouting all around crying
[1:00:10] Grace Grace how many thankful for Grace
[1:00:14] tonight

[1:00:18] doesn't shout self-righteousness

[1:00:23] amen think about any good time you've
[1:00:26] had in the Lord how did it happen by
[1:00:27] God's grace right
[1:00:29] yeah you might have been a little more
[1:00:30] dedicated that week but you weren't
[1:00:32] perfect that week
