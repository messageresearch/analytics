[2:58] time, Lord, there's still a hunger there
[3:01] for more of you, Lord. And you see the
[3:02] different hands that are lifted to you,
[3:04] Lord. And you knew about those needs
[3:07] before the foundation of the world. But
[3:09] Lord, you told us to ask that our joy
[3:11] may be full, Lord. So Lord, you see,
[3:13] Lord, that we're asking, Lord, our hands
[3:15] are lifted, Lord. And we know and
[3:17] believe that we're in divine presence
[3:19] because we have a promise in the word
[3:21] that says wherever two or three are
[3:23] gathered in your name, there will you
[3:24] also be in the midst. So Lord, believing
[3:26] that you're here, Lord, and you're here

[5:10] Genesis. I mean, I'm sorry. I don't

[5:19] Amen. Let's let's let's go to verse
[5:21] four. Matthew 24 and4. The Bible says,
[5:24] "And Jesus answered and said unto them,
[5:26] take heed that no man deceive you. For
[5:29] many shall come in my name, saying, I am
[5:32] Christ, and shall deceive many, and ye
[5:35] shall hear of wars and rumors of wars.
[5:38] See that ye be not troubled, for all
[5:41] these things must come to pass, but the
[5:44] end is not yet. For nations shall rise
[5:47] against nations, and kingdom against
[5:49] kingdom, and there shall be famines, and
[5:53] pestilence, and earthquakes in diverse
[5:55] places. All these are the beginning of
[5:58] sorrow. Then shall they deliver you up
[6:01] to
[6:02] to be afflicted and shall kill you, and
[6:05] ye shall be hated of all nations for my
[6:08] name's sake. And then shall and then
[6:11] shall many be offended and shall betray
[6:14] one another, and shall hate one another.
[6:18] And many false prophets shall rise and
[6:20] shall deceive many. And because iniquity
[6:23] shall abound, and the love of many shall
[6:26] wax cold. But he that shall endure unto
[6:31] the end shall be saved.
[6:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to uh second Peter
[6:38] chapter 1.
[6:40] Second Peter
[6:42] chapter 1
[6:49] verse
[6:52] let's start at verse 18.
[6:55] Second Peter 1 and8
[6:58] the Bible says and this voice which came
[7:02] from heaven we heard when we heard with
[7:05] him in the holy mount we have also a
[7:09] more sure word of prophecy
[7:14] where unto ye do well that ye take heed
[7:18] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[7:21] place
[7:23] until the day dawn on the day star rise
[7:26] in your hearts knowing this first that
[7:30] no prophecy of the scripture is of any
[7:34] private interpretation. Amen. May the
[7:36] Lord a bless read of his word. You can
[7:37] have your seats.
[7:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:42] You know this morning by the grace of
[7:44] God we
[7:46] what we have is almost in the form of a
[7:49] of a Bible study but I'm I'm I'm not a
[7:52] teacher. So you pray for me. Hallelujah.
[7:56] &gt;&gt; But I I I I I want to make you aware of
[7:58] something. Amen. Now today, by the grace
[8:01] of God, I want to talk about prophecy
[8:04] will find you. Prophecy will find you.
[8:07] How many has ever heard that word
[8:08] prophecy before? Hallelujah. Prophecy is
[8:12] something that God talks about in his in
[8:14] his word in his word. You know, it said
[8:16] things have been prophesied, things have
[8:19] uh uh been fulfilled. But when we think
[8:21] about prophecy finding you look in the
[8:24] Bible they ask Jesus you know how do we
[8:28] know where we are? How do we know that
[8:31] the end is soon to come?
[8:33] &gt;&gt; You know and we've been hearing this
[8:35] most of our lives that we are in the
[8:38] last days.
[8:39] &gt;&gt; You know that that the Lord is soon to
[8:41] come. Church, I want you to really
[8:44] understand that God is coming back.
[8:47] Hallelujah.
[8:48] &gt;&gt; God is coming back. And it's been
[8:51] foretold. It's been prophesied uh uh
[8:55] different signs and things that will
[8:56] take place as the Lord is making his way
[9:00] back. Hallelujah.
[9:01] &gt;&gt; So what we want to do today, we want to
[9:03] by the grace of God show you that God is
[9:06] in motion. Hallelujah.
[9:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God is in motion. He's
[9:10] making his way. Now, now what is what
[9:13] does prophecy mean? Prophecy is the
[9:16] foretelling of things to come.
[9:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Prophecy is, hallelujah, maybe a
[9:21] future event that's being made known or
[9:25] something that's going to take place in
[9:27] your life. Hallelujah. That's what
[9:29] prophecy is. Now, I said prophecy will
[9:32] find you. How do we conduct ourselves?
[9:34] This is the question. How do we conduct
[9:37] ourselves when we hear prophecy? Amen.
[9:40] &gt;&gt; When we hear future events being
[9:43] foretold, things that's going to affect
[9:46] our lives. Now to make it even more
[9:48] simple, hallelujah. Every day we are a
[9:52] part of prophecy.
[9:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[9:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Whatever age you are in this
[9:58] building, you are a part of prophecy.
[10:01] Hallelujah. There's a prophecy and then
[10:04] there's a manifestation. Hallelujah.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand that you
[10:08] can hear a prophecy, but a lot of times
[10:11] you are walking in the manifestation of
[10:14] the future. Hallelujah.
[10:17] &gt;&gt; Now, you might look at that and say,
[10:18] "Man, that's that's kind of deep." No,
[10:20] it's simple. Hallelujah. Like I said,
[10:22] every day we walk in the fulfillment of
[10:24] a prophecy. Hallelujah.
[10:26] &gt;&gt; What are you talking about, Brother
[10:27] Diggs, every day today has been
[10:30] prophesied what the weather's going to
[10:32] be.
[10:33] Right. Right.
[10:35] &gt;&gt; Yesterday on the news, the person that
[10:39] did the forecast of the weather, they
[10:41] said, "Well, it's going to be 80
[10:42] something degrees, sunny, shiny, the
[10:45] wind's going to be blowing this or
[10:46] whatever." So, what do we do? We dress
[10:49] according to what we heard.
[10:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If they said it's going to
[10:56] be nice and sunny, none of us are
[10:59] pulling out hoodies.
[11:01] Hallelujah. None of us are pulling out
[11:03] gloves and hoodies and boots, snow boots
[11:05] and all that. Why? Because you heard the
[11:08] prophecy and now you're going to step
[11:10] into the fulfillment of it.
[11:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're going to step into
[11:14] what you heard and become, Hallelujah.
[11:17] what was prophesied. Hallelujah.
[11:19] &gt;&gt; So we today, most of us, we went out the
[11:22] house, we dress according to the
[11:24] weather. Hallelujah. Yes.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; What if they said it was going to I'm
[11:27] going to show you now how often you
[11:29] fulfill prophecy and don't even realize
[11:31] it. Hallelujah. If they say it's going
[11:33] to rain, what do you do? You put on all
[11:36] your weather. You put on all your rain
[11:38] clothes.
[11:39] &gt;&gt; Some of us, Hallelujah. It hadn't even
[11:41] started raining yet, but you getting
[11:43] ready for it. So, you take an umbrella
[11:45] with you.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What are you? You're
[11:50] preparing yourself to manifest what's
[11:53] about to happen in the future.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[11:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, you become the
[11:59] manifestation of what was said.
[12:01] Hallelujah.
[12:02] &gt;&gt; So, you take that you take that
[12:04] umbrella. Hallelujah. You might even put
[12:06] it in your car. It ain't raining yet,
[12:09] but you're preparing for it.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you believe what you heard
[12:13] was truth.
[12:17] &gt;&gt; Oh my. This is rich. Hallelujah. You
[12:19] believe, hallelujah, that the weatherman
[12:21] would lie to you. Hallelujah. So you are
[12:24] preparing, hallelujah, yourself for what
[12:27] you heard. You are now stepping into the
[12:30] thoughts of the weatherman. You are now,
[12:33] hallelujah, letting the voice of the
[12:35] weatherman, hallelujah, control your
[12:37] actions.
[12:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you don't even know him,
[12:43] but there's a level of trust in what he
[12:45] said. Hallelujah. So you going to dress
[12:47] right. Hallelujah. You going to get the
[12:49] umbrella. You might even have on shoes.
[12:52] Hallelujah. That won't where your feet
[12:54] won't be affected. Hallelujah. By the
[12:56] water.
[12:58] &gt;&gt; Every step. Hallelujah. You're going to
[13:00] step according to the prophecy that you
[13:02] heard.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[13:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are now stepping into
[13:07] your future.
[13:09] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. That's right.
[13:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[13:14] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. So prophecy can just be as
[13:17] simple as a fulfillment of a weather
[13:20] pattern. Hallelujah. And we step into,
[13:22] hallelujah, that next day saying it's
[13:24] going to rain.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; We step into the next day saying, "Well,
[13:27] it's going to be 90° or whatever the
[13:29] weather man said." We're looking to be
[13:32] the fulfillment of what was said.
[13:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, the prophet of God
[13:37] said, "Amen. When it comes to prophecy,
[13:39] hallelujah, it's something speaking in
[13:41] the future." Hallelujah. Yes.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; But church, what I want to talk about
[13:45] today, I want to make it real clear.
[13:46] Hallelujah. When it comes to us, what's
[13:49] been prophesied. Hallelujah. We're
[13:52] living it right now.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; This is called a book of prophecy.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[14:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; The Bible is future events being
[14:04] foretold, lived out by sons and
[14:07] daughters of God. Hallelujah. So, when
[14:10] Hallelujah. Now, what is the Bible? The
[14:13] Bible is God in letter form.
[14:16] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[14:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:19] &gt;&gt; The thoughts of God,
[14:22] &gt;&gt; the voice of God,
[14:24] &gt;&gt; the actions of God,
[14:26] &gt;&gt; the mind of God,
[14:28] &gt;&gt; everything about God is in this Bible.
[14:31] &gt;&gt; So when you have this Bible, you have
[14:33] God.
[14:35] &gt;&gt; Now, the thing of it is is hallelujah.
[14:37] We don't want to Hallelujah. reason with
[14:40] this because it's going to happen.
[14:42] Hallelujah. It's going to happen because
[14:44] why? God, hallelujah, has never
[14:47] hallelujah deterred or with a different
[14:49] way detourred. Hallelujah. From what's
[14:52] written in the Bible.
[14:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; The Bible can't be changed. The Bible
[14:57] can't be altered. Hallelujah. But the
[15:00] Bible is exactly what God means.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:06] &gt;&gt; So if you can find it in the Bible, you
[15:09] can rest on it. Amen.
[15:12] &gt;&gt; That's why the devil doesn't want you to
[15:14] read your Bible.
[15:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[15:16] &gt;&gt; Because he knows if you read your Bible,
[15:18] you'll start to understand God's way.
[15:22] &gt;&gt; And as you begin to understand God's
[15:25] way, then you begin to prepare for
[15:28] what's about to come.
[15:29] &gt;&gt; H the Bible, Hallelujah. The Bible will
[15:33] teach you how to dress for your future.
[15:36] &gt;&gt; It'll show you where to step for your
[15:38] future. It'll show you things to come
[15:40] for your future. Hallelujah. This is a
[15:43] book of prophecy.
[15:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:48] &gt;&gt; So, it's very important. Hallelujah.
[15:50] Don't lay this on the shelf. Seek for
[15:53] understanding.
[15:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[15:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:00] &gt;&gt; But are we in a time where the Bible is
[16:04] becoming real? Church, let me say it
[16:07] like this. Now, I ain't going to be
[16:08] long. Y'all know I'm about to close.
[16:12] But listen, church. When it comes to
[16:14] you, prophecy for prophecy finding you,
[16:19] the word of God. Hallelujah. In every
[16:22] age searches for a people to fulfill
[16:25] what's in their day.
[16:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[16:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[16:30] &gt;&gt; Every every age. And we're in the last
[16:33] church age. So God has sought out a
[16:35] people that could manifest the
[16:38] prophecies in the 20th century.
[16:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And you want to believe that
[16:44] you are a part of the prophecy. You are
[16:46] a part of the fulfillment. Hallelujah.
[16:48] Because if you are a part of the
[16:51] fulfillment, hallelujah, your life,
[16:54] hallelujah, is a statement of what God
[16:56] is doing in your day.
[16:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Now, I'm going tell you a a
[17:05] personal testimony.
[17:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[17:12] As a young man, when I first came into
[17:14] the ministry,
[17:16] I I didn't told this testimony in a
[17:18] couple places, but it kind of goes with
[17:20] this message.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Just like some of you, I was
[17:25] just in church, you know, just trying to
[17:27] find my way, find my find find, you
[17:29] know, like we say, I'm I'm trying to
[17:30] find God. No, you ain't. God ain't
[17:32] missing.
[17:36] &gt;&gt; God is not missing. Stop saying that.
[17:39] I'm trying to find the Lord. And
[17:41] surrender.
[17:42] &gt;&gt; Just surrender. Hallelujah. Because if
[17:45] you are making that statement, that mean
[17:46] God is dealing with you. Just surrender.
[17:49] Hallelujah. Just just my you know my
[17:51] mama used to tell me son don't try to be
[17:54] all mysterious with God. Talk to God
[17:57] like a friend.
[18:00] Hallelujah. You know, there's times,
[18:03] church, where I don't have no words, but
[18:04] Lord, I don't know what's going on. I
[18:06] just need your help.
[18:08] &gt;&gt; Just like that. We don't have to come
[18:09] before God and say, "Oh, Lord, you are
[18:11] the great August being. You come from
[18:14] the land of nothingness." And oh, that
[18:16] don't impress God.
[18:18] &gt;&gt; Don't none of that stuff impress God?
[18:20] You just come to God and say, "Lord, my
[18:21] my my spirit is broken."
[18:24] &gt;&gt; Like, Lord, Lord, I want to know you.
[18:25] Lord, I got this habit I can't get over.
[18:27] I need your strength. Talk to God like
[18:29] that. Amen. Talk to God with sincerity.
[18:32] Hallelujah. Don't come to God trying to
[18:34] be something you not. Hallelujah. Don't
[18:36] come to God, Hallelujah. Trying to
[18:38] express something that you can't keep up
[18:40] to.
[18:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But but be simple with God.
[18:43] Be plain with God. Hallelujah. And you
[18:45] know, she used to tell me, she said,
[18:47] "Son, there's a part where the prophet
[18:49] of God did, the prophet didn't know
[18:51] God." And he said, he said, "Mr. Great
[18:54] God, whoever you are, he just started
[18:56] talking to him like a tree,
[19:00] &gt;&gt; the God of the ABCs,
[19:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. We want to be simple with God.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God is hidden and
[19:10] revealed in simplicity.
[19:12] &gt;&gt; When you really start to take time with
[19:14] God, this is not difficult to
[19:17] understand.
[19:20] When you enter into a willing place to
[19:23] serve him, this becomes understandable.
[19:27] &gt;&gt; You know what he wants. You hear people
[19:28] say it all the time. Well, the Bible
[19:30] confusing, so I'm going to get me a New
[19:32] International Version. No.
[19:35] No.
[19:37] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. Amen.
[19:38] &gt;&gt; No.
[19:39] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Even right now. Hallelujah. Don't do it.
[19:42] Don't do it right now, but when you get
[19:44] home, look at what kind of Bible you
[19:47] got. Yes.
[19:48] &gt;&gt; Because you can have a Bible that's been
[19:50] inspired by man. Say, you know what? I'm
[19:53] gonna make the word of God easier.
[19:56] &gt;&gt; So, I'm going to take this scripture out
[19:57] and I'mma add this in
[19:59] &gt;&gt; or I'mma take this word out and I'mma
[20:01] add this in and make it easier so the
[20:03] people can understand it. What they're
[20:05] doing, they're trying to change God's
[20:07] mind.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:12] where God may have that word in there
[20:14] purposely because it has something that
[20:16] you need.
[20:18] &gt;&gt; Church, in a lot of these new Bibles,
[20:20] the New International Version, the the
[20:22] version of the heavens and and the
[20:24] versions of the Mcabes and all this
[20:27] stuff, they are inspired by men wanting
[20:30] to make things easier to understand.
[20:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the Bible says God hides
[20:37] his word from the wise and prudent, but
[20:40] he reveals it unto babes.
[20:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen to that. He reveals
[20:45] it unto babes. What he's saying, the
[20:47] word of God, when you apply yourself,
[20:49] it's so easy to understand that a baby
[20:52] can f the baby can find their way.
[20:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[20:57] &gt;&gt; Everybody all right?
[20:58] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[20:59] &gt;&gt; But church, back in back in the day,
[21:02] many many many years ago. Oh, hardly. I
[21:04] ain't going to tell you my age, but many
[21:06] years ago, I was doing a youth meeting.
[21:10] And in this youth meeting, there was a
[21:13] sister sitting on the front row like my
[21:14] brothers right here. And as I was
[21:16] preaching, she got up and went to the
[21:18] bathroom. She said the reason why she
[21:21] got up and went to the bathroom because
[21:23] she felt like something demonic was
[21:25] happening to her while the word was
[21:27] being preached. She said, so she went in
[21:30] the bathroom. Hallelujah, Sister Smith.
[21:32] And she says she started to repent.
[21:35] &gt;&gt; She started to say, "Lord, forgive me. I
[21:37] I don't know what's going on, but I want
[21:38] to hear the word and something just
[21:39] ain't happening." Hallelujah. How do you
[21:42] respond when things are off in your
[21:44] life?
[21:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you feel like there's a
[21:48] spirit there or you feel like,
[21:50] hallelujah, something's stopping you
[21:52] from getting to that place in God, how
[21:54] do you respond? Do you just go with the
[21:56] flow or you say, "All right, it'll be
[21:58] all right." Or do you cry to God, "Lord,
[22:00] help me. Amen.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, she didn't understand
[22:04] what was going on. So, she went in the
[22:05] bathroom. Now, this is in the middle
[22:07] while I'm preaching. She went in the
[22:09] bathroom and start She said she started
[22:10] repenting. She said, "Lord, I don't know
[22:12] what's going on, but Father, please help
[22:13] me." She said God spoke to her and said,
[22:16] "Everything is all right. Go back in
[22:18] there. I something I need you to tell my
[22:19] servant."
[22:21] Hallelujah. See, one thing I want you to
[22:24] understand, hallelujah, I said this
[22:25] yesterday. God talk to us all the time,
[22:28] but are we aware of it?
[22:33] &gt;&gt; Are we aware that he's speaking?
[22:34] Hallelujah.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; Because what I want to share right now
[22:39] is that when the devil speaks and God
[22:42] speaks, it's the same voice of your
[22:45] conscience.
[22:49] &gt;&gt; But it's up to you to interpret which
[22:51] spirit is behind that voice of your
[22:53] conscience. Amen.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; See, when you leave here, hallelujah,
[22:57] and you start to rehearse what was
[22:59] preached, you're not going to hear my
[23:00] voice in your conscience. You're going
[23:02] to hear your voice.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I give you a prime example.
[23:07] Everybody under their breath right now
[23:10] say, "Stop."
[23:12] &gt;&gt; Under your breath.
[23:14] &gt;&gt; Not out loud.
[23:16] &gt;&gt; Listen to me real good.
[23:18] &gt;&gt; Under under. No, you know what? I got
[23:20] something for you. Hallelujah.
[23:26] Let me find it.
[23:31] I hope I still got it.
[23:36] Okay, without saying it out loud,
[23:41] say this back to me.
[23:45] Now, I'mma ask you something. Say it
[23:47] again.
[23:49] Did you hear it?
[23:53] Yes, sir.
[23:55] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about all of it.
[23:59] &gt;&gt; Where's that voice coming from?
[24:02] &gt;&gt; That voice is in you.
[24:05] &gt;&gt; Now, it's it's up to you to interpret
[24:07] whether this is something good or this
[24:10] is something bad.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Because it's your voice rehearsing it
[24:13] back to you. Hallelujah. It ain't the
[24:16] what makes it God's voice or the devil's
[24:17] voice. The way you interpret it. Yes.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[24:21] &gt;&gt; We are all saying amen right now under
[24:23] our voice. You don't hear brother de.
[24:25] Let's say it one more time.
[24:28] &gt;&gt; You didn't hear my voice, did you?
[24:29] Hallelujah. You heard your voice.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; And a lot of times, church, when
[24:33] spiritual things happen. Hallelujah. You
[24:35] can't blame it on nobody else. You're
[24:37] hearing it under your own perception.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[24:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You're hearing it under your
[24:43] own voice. So, it's up to you to
[24:45] interpret what kind of spirit is behind
[24:47] it.
[24:49] Hallelujah sir.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; And you know, hallelujah. Back to the
[24:52] testimony. She was, you know, this this,
[24:54] you know, I carry this sometime cuz
[24:56] people just look at you and they don't
[24:57] say amen.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if y'all get a little
[25:01] cold on me, I'mma hold this up.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[25:04] &gt;&gt; Well, look, church. Hallelujah. She said
[25:06] she she was in the bathroom and and God
[25:09] told her, "Go back out there. There
[25:10] something I need you to tell your
[25:11] servant." Now, she started to say this.
[25:14] What was happening? Hallelujah. As I'm
[25:16] preaching, she saw two of me up there,
[25:18] Brother Jesse. Hallelujah. She saw one
[25:21] uh uh on your left, which is my right.
[25:24] And she saw another one. Hallelujah. On
[25:26] your right, which is my left.
[25:28] Hallelujah. She said, "And this one over
[25:30] here would step into this one, and then
[25:35] this one would preach, and it would step
[25:38] back out," she said. And then it would
[25:40] step back in, and it would preach, and
[25:43] then it would step back out.
[25:45] And she said she thought she was seeing
[25:46] something demonic. Hallelujah. So she
[25:49] ran to the bathroom. She said when she
[25:51] came back out, God started to explain to
[25:54] her what was happening.
[25:55] &gt;&gt; That's why what we have the message of
[25:58] the hour is very important to
[26:01] understand.
[26:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[26:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because God, and I'm going
[26:04] to get to this, God sent a vindicated
[26:07] prophet so that we could understand the
[26:10] book of prophecy.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There are people been
[26:14] reading this Bible for years with no
[26:17] understanding.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; It's just intellect.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Putting putting uh definitions with
[26:25] definitions. No, we want to live the
[26:28] life of God.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[26:31] &gt;&gt; But look, church, she said she gets in
[26:34] there and she sees one one me stepping
[26:36] into the other me. And when that one
[26:38] steps in, I begin to preach. She said,
[26:41] "And then he steps out, steps back in,
[26:43] preach, steps out, steps back in,
[26:46] preach." And she was looking like, she
[26:48] said, she was thinking, "Oh, oh,
[26:49] Malachi, it's something demonic going
[26:51] on." She said she sat there, she said,
[26:53] God began to rehearse back to her what
[26:56] she studied in the message. Hallelujah.
[26:58] She said, remember, hallelujah.
[27:00] Hallelujah. Angels are in this room
[27:02] that's just a little too faster for this
[27:04] eye.
[27:07] &gt;&gt; That dimension is here right now. Angels
[27:09] are in this room. Hallelujah. But we
[27:12] can't see it with our natural human eye
[27:15] unless God hallelujah. puts us in that
[27:17] realm.
[27:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Unless your spirit Hallelujah. Slows
[27:23] everything down and God allows you to
[27:25] step into it.
[27:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Wouldn't you want to be able
[27:29] to see angels?
[27:33] &gt;&gt; And he said, if angels are in this room,
[27:36] God is in this room.
[27:39] Yes, sir.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:41] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Are you with me?
[27:43] &gt;&gt; You say, "Really, brother Diggs? Ain't
[27:45] got is is angels and God? Are they is
[27:48] God really in this room?" Again, you
[27:51] have to understand that this cannot
[27:53] change. The Bible says, "Wherever two or
[27:56] three are gathered in my name, there
[27:59] will I also be in the midst."
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I know I'm a believer.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Can I Is there another
[28:06] believer in here? Amen.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; Is there another believer? Is there
[28:10] another believer in here?
[28:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Believer.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Believer. Believer. Believer. Believer.
[28:16] Believer. Believer. Believer. Believer.
[28:18] H. So, we got more than two or three.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; So, that means God has to be here.
[28:29] &gt;&gt; Prophecy fulfilled.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; We're living in the manifestation right
[28:34] now of God's presence. H God is in this
[28:38] room.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; That ain't no skim milk. God is in this
[28:43] room. Church, when you when you go back
[28:46] home and they say, "How was church?" You
[28:48] say, "Man, I I was in there with God."
[28:51] &gt;&gt; I like that.
[28:52] &gt;&gt; I was in the presence of the Lord.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:56] &gt;&gt; I was in the presence of the Lord.
[28:57] Church, those are not just good slogans
[29:00] or good things to say. No, it is a
[29:02] reality.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; My book of prophecy which cannot change
[29:09] the foretelling of future events says
[29:11] that wherever two or three believers
[29:13] gather, God will also be in my midst.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[29:18] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; So the Lord is here.
[29:23] &gt;&gt; Church, she said, and I'm still telling
[29:25] you testimony. She said she could see
[29:28] two of me. She's saying what God was
[29:30] showing her. She said, "See what you're
[29:32] seeing is his theophony giving him the
[29:34] word to preach to the people."
[29:39] &gt;&gt; That's a word, hallelujah,
[29:42] that's been
[29:44] revealed and and and and unraveled unto
[29:47] us through what we study in the message
[29:51] of the hour. A theophony body, which is
[29:54] a word body. Hallelujah.
[29:57] A theophony is your representation in
[29:59] heaven. Hallelujah.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; So what she was seeing was my spiritual
[30:03] representation
[30:04] &gt;&gt; that's already in the presence of God.
[30:06] Hallelujah.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; Coming down to give the church a word.
[30:10] Hallelujah.
[30:12] &gt;&gt; For what they needed in that moment.
[30:14] Hallelujah.
[30:15] &gt;&gt; She said the the will jump back into my
[30:17] flesh and the flesh would preach. And
[30:19] then the word will jump back out. Then
[30:21] the word will jump back in. Preach. Then
[30:23] the word will jump back out. Then the
[30:24] word will jump back in and preach.
[30:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[30:28] &gt;&gt; Brother D, what are you saying? If my
[30:30] theophony is preaching to you, it's
[30:32] preaching to your theophony.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my church. If I'm preaching to you
[30:42] right now and there's something in you
[30:45] that says amen, that's not your flesh.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:50] &gt;&gt; Your flesh has never been in heaven.
[30:53] Right, brother. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; The Bible says flesh and blood shall not
[30:57] inherit the kingdom of God.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; So, if I'm saying anything to you, and
[31:02] there's something inside of you that
[31:03] says, "Amen," that mean you have a
[31:06] theophony.
[31:08] &gt;&gt; That means, hallelujah, that one place,
[31:11] one point of time, you were in heaven
[31:14] with God.
[31:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's where your amens are
[31:20] coming from. It's coming from your
[31:22] representation.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; I got a couple amens on that one.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But look, she say she was
[31:30] seeing all that. She said, "Now, what
[31:33] you seeing?" She said, "God was showing
[31:34] her sitting in service." She said, "God
[31:36] is showing her." Said, "What you're
[31:37] seeing is his his theophony. His
[31:40] theophony is giving him the word to
[31:41] preach to the people." And she said,
[31:43] "That went on for a while." And she
[31:46] said, "There's something I want you to
[31:47] tell him when service is over."
[31:50] And this is what God told her to tell
[31:51] me. Say, tell him that I called him to
[31:56] preach.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; And that I'mma
[32:00] use him and take his ministry in places
[32:02] he could only imagine.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; I had just started preaching.
[32:06] Hallelujah.
[32:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And let me say it like this.
[32:10] I wasn't looking to be a preacher,
[32:14] &gt;&gt; but it was all the choosing of God.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:18] So church, I say that to say this. Last
[32:22] year I was in the Philippines around
[32:23] Christmas time and me and some brothers
[32:26] was riding. I think I told brother Jesse
[32:28] this. Me and some brothers was riding.
[32:30] The brother asked me, he said, "Bro
[32:32] Digs, have you been to all the
[32:33] continents?" I was like, "I don't know."
[32:36] Hallelujah. Geography wasn't my strong
[32:38] point.
[32:40] Hallelujah. Not math, not English. I
[32:43] love biology.
[32:46] the study of Hallelujah.
[32:49] Biology was my thing. Hallelujah. But
[32:52] you know, he he he said, "Well, let's
[32:55] name them out." He said, "How many other
[32:56] ones?" He said, "Sven." So, they started
[32:58] naming them. I said, "Yeah, I've been
[32:59] there." They started nameing. I said,
[33:00] "Yeah, I've been there, church. I've
[33:02] been to six of the continents.
[33:05] &gt;&gt; There's only one I haven't been to, and
[33:07] that's Antarctica, and I have no
[33:08] desire."
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; What are you saying? That what you're
[33:17] looking at is a fulfillment of prophecy.
[33:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; And I want you to understand that you
[33:24] are a part of this fulfillment.
[33:27] &gt;&gt; Me traveling to Akan, Ohio is a part of
[33:31] prophecy being fulfilled. But today it's
[33:34] a manifestation of prophecy.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; You are not just the prophecy. You are
[33:40] the manifestation of what God said. See,
[33:43] so when God called me, he saw you.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he said, "You know what?
[33:48] I'm going to take your ministry into
[33:49] places you could only imagine." I never
[33:52] imagined coming to Akan. I never knew of
[33:54] Akan until LeBron became a pro
[33:56] basketball athlete.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[33:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[34:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Never even heard of it. Hallelujah. But
[34:04] God knew of you. So what he did, he put
[34:07] a gift in me. Hallelujah. To get me
[34:09] where? To Akan. Because there was a
[34:12] people who would manifest the word of
[34:14] God.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It goes so much deeper.
[34:19] Hallelujah. God put a seed in a man
[34:21] named Jesse. Hallelujah. He put a word
[34:24] in him, a gift of a pastor. Why? To
[34:27] start a church. Why? To fulfill what was
[34:30] told to me.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah.
[34:34] &gt;&gt; Jesse, hallelujah. Was already a part of
[34:37] the vision for my life. Yes. Hallelujah.
[34:40] Praise God.
[34:42] &gt;&gt; Jesse, his wife, all of you, this whole
[34:44] church.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; You're a part of the prophecy.
[34:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Brother D, what are you saying? You are
[34:55] a part of God's thoughts.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; You are a part of God's mind.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God created me just to speak
[35:03] to you.
[35:04] &gt;&gt; God created him just to speak to you.
[35:06] Hallelujah. You are the manifestation of
[35:09] what God's thoughts were.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But let's backtrack a little
[35:15] bit. Hallelujah.
[35:17] Now, there's always a prophecy and
[35:20] there's a fulfillment. Hallelujah.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Or there's a manifestation. Now, let's
[35:24] look at it, church. The Bible is not
[35:28] like any other book. Right?
[35:30] &gt;&gt; So what you ought to do in your service
[35:32] to God is study this, know this, become
[35:37] this
[35:38] &gt;&gt; because this is unchangeable.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If you say, "God, all I'm
[35:43] doing is what's in the Bible." God can't
[35:45] deny you.
[35:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because this is who he is.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet of God says.
[35:51] He says, "Now, the Bible is a different
[35:53] book from any other sacred book."
[35:55] Hallelujah. There's a lot of other
[35:57] sacred books. The Quran, H is considered
[36:00] to be a sacred book. H the book of the
[36:03] Mcabes and the book of Jash, all these
[36:05] things. H book of Ja, whatever they call
[36:08] it. H all of these supposed to be sacred
[36:10] books. But then he says there's no book
[36:12] like the Bible.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Listen to me good now. Follow me. Amen.
[36:17] I ain't going to be long. Follow me now.
[36:19] He said there's no book like the Bible
[36:21] because the Bible is God in word for
[36:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:28] &gt;&gt; Not the Quran, not the Mcabes, not the
[36:32] book of Jes. But he said the Bible is
[36:34] God in word form.
[36:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So you know what? When you
[36:39] got a Hallelujah, a Bible, Hallelujah, a
[36:42] King James version tucked under your
[36:43] home, you walking with God.
[36:52] I don't have to go to heaven. Heaven is
[36:54] with me. God is with me.
[36:58] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[37:01] &gt;&gt; My
[37:02] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The Bible is God in word form.
[37:05] See, it's a word. It's a thought
[37:08] expressed. God's thinking expressed it.
[37:11] His word. Hallelujah. Through the
[37:13] prophets and they wrote the Bible.
[37:14] Hallelujah. See, the prophets of God
[37:17] were inspired to put God's thoughts in a
[37:20] book.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:23] &gt;&gt; Not just a man saying, "Well, I don't
[37:25] know what that means." So, we going to
[37:26] take that word out
[37:27] &gt;&gt; and we going to make it simple.
[37:29] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; You know, like the Bible says a woman
[37:33] shouldn't wear pants. Somebody else say,
[37:35] "Well, nah, nah, that ain't in that
[37:37] ain't in the Bible. I don't see that."
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, it's in there.
[37:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's according to your
[37:42] understanding.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. The Bible says
[37:46] garments pertaining to a man. Now, the
[37:49] last time I checked my closet, I don't
[37:50] have no dresses in there.
[37:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[37:54] &gt;&gt; Pertain to me.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Last time I checked my car, I ain't got
[37:57] no tutu. I ain't got no halter tops. I
[37:59] ain't got none of that and stuff. All of
[38:01] that pertains to a woman. Hallelujah.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Come on now, talk to me.
[38:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many of you brothers
[38:07] when you step out, you put on a wrap
[38:09] skirt?
[38:11] That's right.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; If you do that, you got a perverted
[38:13] spirit on you.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Or you going to find you a
[38:16] nice little mini, a little jean mini,
[38:18] and put that on and say, "I'm going to
[38:19] go shoot some basketball."
[38:22] &gt;&gt; No, you got a perverted spirit on you
[38:24] then.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; The Bible says garments pertaining to,
[38:28] hallelujah. Pertaining means,
[38:29] hallelujah, to be, hallelujah, to seek
[38:32] after. Hallelujah. To look like,
[38:34] hallelujah.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; So garments pertaining to the man is
[38:38] what? These.
[38:41] Hallelujah. Well, they say, "Well, back
[38:43] in those days, they wasn't even wearing
[38:45] pants." You know what? We ain't back in
[38:46] those days.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[38:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I'm not putting on a
[38:51] moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[38:52] or goooo or tutu. I'm putting on pants.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, in my day, Hallelujah.
[38:59] The word is to match what's in my day.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah. That's right.
[39:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So for a woman to put on garments
[39:09] pertaining to a man,
[39:12] what does that mean? If a woman stands
[39:14] beside me and we look alike, that means
[39:17] that our garments are the same.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; And it's more than just Hallelujah.
[39:26] garments. There's so many other things
[39:27] that go on why you shouldn't wear pants.
[39:29] Hallelujah. There is the lust factor.
[39:33] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because when a woman puts on
[39:35] garments, it shows a whole figure.
[39:37] There's no more a mystery. Everything
[39:39] about her is seen.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[39:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I was talking to a brother,
[39:51] a fellow I used to work with, and we
[39:53] started talking about this, right? He
[39:54] was the denomination Christian. We
[39:55] started talking about this. He said, he
[39:57] said, "Well, man," he said, "Dre," they
[39:59] called me Dre. He said, "Dre, I don't
[40:00] see nothing wrong with it."
[40:01] I said, "That's cuz you like seeing your
[40:03] wife in pants. That's why you don't see
[40:05] nothing wrong with it." But when you
[40:06] want to be pleasing in God's eyes,
[40:08] hallelujah, you want to be the
[40:10] manifestation of God's thoughts.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[40:16] &gt;&gt; There is a word and there is a
[40:18] fulfillment of that word.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Glory.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; Look, the Bible is not like any other
[40:27] sacred book.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen, I'll tell all you
[40:31] young people, hallelujah, don't get mad
[40:34] at your parents because of the way
[40:35] you're living. All they're trying to do
[40:38] is give you God's thoughts.
[40:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; It's not their thoughts.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; It's not their mind. All we're trying to
[40:49] do is conduct ourselves according to how
[40:52] God thinks.
[40:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen.
[40:58] He says God speak and express his words,
[41:01] thoughts, hallelujah, his words through
[41:03] the prophets. And they wrote the Bible
[41:05] which is in word form. And Jesus called
[41:07] it a seed. Hallelujah. So church, when
[41:10] we begin to live out this, hallelujah.
[41:12] It's the planting of the seed inside of
[41:14] you. Hallelujah. And as you continue to
[41:17] live this word, the seed in you will
[41:20] grow.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:23] &gt;&gt; What waters that seed? The word.
[41:27] Hallelujah.
[41:28] &gt;&gt; Think about it, church. God put himself
[41:31] in you and uses himself to make you
[41:34] grow.
[41:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Faith cometh by hearing.
[41:43] Hearing what? The word of God.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[41:48] &gt;&gt; Everybody all right?
[41:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "And Jesus called it a seed,
[41:52] and a seed will bring forth of its own
[41:54] kind." So if you study the word, you
[41:57] listen to the word, it can only bring
[41:59] forth what? The word.
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:04] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother D, I want to know more
[42:06] about God." Read your Bible.
[42:09] &gt;&gt; You say, "I want I want more victory."
[42:11] Study your Bible.
[42:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[42:20] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[42:22] And any seed will bring forth of his
[42:24] kind. if it is in the right conditions.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, so you cannot bring
[42:31] forth God listening to the Quran.
[42:36] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; Because he's not in that book.
[42:40] &gt;&gt; His nature is not in that book. You
[42:42] can't study about the Buddhist and
[42:44] Confucious and all these things and say,
[42:46] "I want to be like the most high." He's
[42:48] not revealed in that book. Those are
[42:51] books of good ethics, books of good
[42:54] morals. But this books tell us how to
[42:57] live.
[42:58] &gt;&gt; This books, hallelujah, tells us how to
[43:01] generate his life.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This book tells us what we
[43:05] will be if we become this.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[43:13] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[43:14] But Jesse, one thing I found out is
[43:18] &gt;&gt; when you start pointing people back to
[43:19] the Bible, they kind of shut you off a
[43:21] little bit.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Because they have their own perceptions
[43:24] on what they want to do.
[43:28] &gt;&gt; That's why a lot of people don't want
[43:31] raw Bible
[43:32] &gt;&gt; because they want a religion where they
[43:34] can still smoke and drink.
[43:36] &gt;&gt; They can still go to the club.
[43:38] &gt;&gt; They they they Oh my hallelujah. We got
[43:41] Christians. I know somebody who say she
[43:42] was a Christian. Hallelujah. And every
[43:44] time I turn around, she on IG.
[43:46] Hallelujah. Putting up a video.
[43:49] &gt;&gt; Got her boots on the ground.
[43:57] Every time you turn around, I see some
[43:59] of y'all holding y'all laugh back.
[44:03] You didn't see them video. Everybody
[44:04] Everybody turn boots on the ground. I
[44:06] got my boots on the ground. Boot bendy
[44:09] to church. Praise the Lord. My thing
[44:11] always be Hallelujah. No matter what you
[44:13] think is all right. Hallelujah. If it's
[44:16] all right, will God be there with you?
[44:20] &gt;&gt; While you going to the cookout and boots
[44:21] on the ground, will God be at the
[44:23] cookout with you with his boots on the
[44:24] ground?
[44:27] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, they got a movie about the
[44:29] Lord and this and that." Will God be at
[44:30] the movie theater with you eating
[44:31] popcorn with you?
[44:33] &gt;&gt; Eating some gooboos and and Eminem
[44:35] drinking a good old ice cold cherry
[44:37] coke. Will God be there with you?
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:40] &gt;&gt; See, hallelujah. The Bible presents a
[44:43] separation.
[44:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[44:49] &gt;&gt; Listen. He said, "This book, oh my," he
[44:51] said, "In the right atmosphere now, this
[44:53] book," Hallelujah,
[44:55] &gt;&gt; "Prophecy, it foretells future events."
[44:58] Church, hallelujah, ain't going to dwell
[45:00] too much into this, but think about it.
[45:03] Where are we concerning prophecy?
[45:06] &gt;&gt; Let's keep going. And now the book
[45:08] contains the entire revelation of Jesus
[45:10] Christ. This is the entire revelation of
[45:14] Jesus Christ.
[45:15] &gt;&gt; You say, "Lord, I want to know you."
[45:17] Read your Bible.
[45:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:22] &gt;&gt; Lord, am I living right? Read your
[45:25] Bible.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; Can I be a good husband? Read your
[45:29] Bible.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Can I be a good wife? Read your Bible.
[45:35] &gt;&gt; It's all in there.
[45:37] I just want to be a good son, a good
[45:39] daughter. Read your Bible.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[45:44] &gt;&gt; I want to uh make good investments. Read
[45:47] your Bible.
[45:49] &gt;&gt; It's all in there. Everything about
[45:51] life.
[45:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It's in this Bible.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[45:58] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Listen
[46:01] now, the book contains the entire
[46:02] revelation of Jesus Christ. You don't
[46:05] add to it.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, church?
[46:10] &gt;&gt; We don't add to it.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; We don't add to the Bible because if we
[46:14] add to it, now we trying to tell God how
[46:16] to think.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Good.
[46:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said or take away from
[46:22] it. You don't take away from it because
[46:24] now you're trying to tell God what he
[46:25] can and cannot be.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; So, we read it, we accept it, and we
[46:32] walk in it. Hallelujah. Read it, accept
[46:36] it, and walk in it.
[46:38] &gt;&gt; Say it with me. Read it, accept it, and
[46:41] walk in it. One more time. Read it.
[46:46] &gt;&gt; Some of y'all were lip singing.
[46:52] &gt;&gt; I want you to understand.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[46:55] &gt;&gt; If it wasn't audible, the devil didn't
[46:57] hear it.
[46:57] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; And he's not taking you serious.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelu. You know, if Satan
[47:04] got a grip on you, hallelujah, he don't
[47:06] have to back up until your confession is
[47:08] heard.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The power of confession.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; Listen. Amen. I hope y'all don't mind me
[47:20] reading. Hallelujah. Listen. He says,
[47:25] "It's got to come according to the word
[47:28] if it comes from God."
[47:31] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I want to do this. I
[47:32] want to do that and you want to be a
[47:34] Christian, it better be in here.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said because it's to vindicate
[47:43] it or to prove God's presence and he
[47:45] forneew all these things being his
[47:48] fornowledge. He ordained for ordained is
[47:52] called hallelujah. It's called in the
[47:54] Bible predestination. Listen to this.
[47:57] Every age are you with me?
[48:00] &gt;&gt; Every age to its place. He say that's
[48:02] what the Bible is doing. That's what God
[48:04] has predestinated. Every age to his
[48:07] place. Now, we'll accept that. But
[48:09] listen to what else he says. And every
[48:12] man to his place.
[48:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:15] &gt;&gt; So, we have a age. Hallelujah. That God
[48:18] has predestinated to be in a certain
[48:20] place. He's also put a man and placed
[48:23] him in that age. Hallelujah. And
[48:25] predestinated him to be something in
[48:28] that age.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Moses didn't have Noah's message.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; It was for his day.
[48:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:41] &gt;&gt; Joshua didn't have Noah's message. It
[48:44] was for his day.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jeremiah, hallelujah, didn't
[48:49] have Isaiah's message. Isaiah's message
[48:51] was for his day. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; Now, you can quote what happened in
[48:55] those days, but you got to live for what
[48:58] God has for you in your day.
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; Think about it right now. Me and Jesse
[49:04] say, "You know what? That's enough of
[49:05] this. We We going to build a boat cuz
[49:06] it's going to rain.
[49:09] &gt;&gt; I I I'm getting inspired. I want to be
[49:12] like, "No, I'mma build me a big old boat
[49:14] and we gonna bring we gonna go to the
[49:16] zoo and get two of everything and bring
[49:17] it on the boat."
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Think about that.
[49:22] H. That would be something that we just
[49:25] want to do.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; What Noah did came directly inspired by
[49:31] God.
[49:32] &gt;&gt; Noah didn't have to go get animals. They
[49:35] automatically came.
[49:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; They came in to Hallelujah.
[49:44] &gt;&gt; See, God was inspiring that in that day.
[49:47] Hallelujah.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; See, so if God is behind it, Hallelujah.
[49:51] You don't have to waste your strength.
[49:53] &gt;&gt; God will do it himself
[49:56] &gt;&gt; because it's his work. Hallelujah. The
[49:58] bride of Christ fellowship is God's
[50:01] work.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[50:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said every man to his place
[50:06] and every messenger to his place. He is
[50:09] God. The devil ain't pulling nothing
[50:12] over God.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. Hallelujah.
[50:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay,
[50:20] let me dwell over here for a little
[50:21] minute.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; Now, I want you to understand something
[50:24] about God and Satan's relationship.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; I I ain't think understood that they got
[50:30] a relationship.
[50:32] &gt;&gt; God and the devil have a relationship.
[50:34] &gt;&gt; They talk to each other all the time.
[50:37] &gt;&gt; And they talk about you.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Satan comes to God. He says,
[50:41] "You know what? I saw him. I saw him on
[50:43] social media. He was looking at this and
[50:45] looking at that." And then God said he
[50:47] under the blood. I ain't see nothing.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; He said the devil say but I saw it. He
[50:52] did it last night. God said he repented.
[50:54] I ain't see nothing.
[50:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[50:59] &gt;&gt; He repented. I don't know what you're
[51:01] talking about. All I see is blood.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; So these are the conversations God and
[51:06] the devil have all the time. Hallelujah.
[51:08] Satan comes and say, "Oh my, he was
[51:10] watching us on social media, watching us
[51:11] on the internet. He said this out his
[51:13] mouth." Hallelujah. Then you went and
[51:14] got in prayer and repented. Hallelujah.
[51:16] So Satan comes, he said, "God, they
[51:18] cussed the other day."
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Think y'all know I'm a blood hound, too.
[51:29] &gt;&gt; If it ain't under the blood, we going to
[51:31] sniff it out.
[51:33] &gt;&gt; Somebody tongue stripping every now and
[51:35] then.
[51:36] &gt;&gt; Get a little cussing out every now and
[51:38] then, but that's all right. Hallelujah.
[51:41] If you slip up, you go to God and
[51:43] repent. Hallelujah. The devil come and
[51:45] say, "Hey, they got a cussing spirit on
[51:47] them." Hallelujah. They You talking
[51:48] about them your children, they cussing.
[51:50] God say, "I don't know what you're
[51:51] talking about. All I hear is praise."
[51:55] [Applause]
[52:00] &gt;&gt; See about this church. Hallelujah.
[52:04] God, he made Peter a part of the
[52:07] resurrection. Yes.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; He made Peter a part, hallelujah, of the
[52:12] filling of the Holy Ghost.
[52:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did. Hallelujah.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Knowing he had a custom
[52:17] demon in him.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother.
[52:21] &gt;&gt; Knowing he was going to deny him.
[52:23] Hallelujah.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Good.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Knowing Hallelujah. In his early stages,
[52:27] he was going to try to cut somebody head
[52:29] off.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; He wasn't He wasn't that skillful. He
[52:33] I'mma cut your ear off.
[52:36] &gt;&gt; Right. No, he was trying to cut his head
[52:38] off. All
[52:39] &gt;&gt; right, brother.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; But God, hallelujah, not willing for his
[52:43] testimony to be damaged, he just let it
[52:45] be an ear.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[52:47] &gt;&gt; And then God came and got rid of the
[52:49] evidence that it was ever that it ever
[52:51] even happened.
[52:52] &gt;&gt; Church, you look at Peter's whole
[52:55] journey, God evidence.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; Why? Because he was a part of prophecy.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; He was a part of the fulfillment of what
[53:05] God was going to do. God said in the
[53:07] book of Joel, "My spirit is going to
[53:09] pour out upon men." Hallelujah. Peter
[53:11] was a part of that prophecy.
[53:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, you are.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[53:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; Beautiful.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; Church, what do you mean? Oh my. This is
[53:19] coming fresh. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[53:22] God had to get rid of all the evidence
[53:24] because Peter had to stand up and say,
[53:26] "This is what the prophet Joel talked."
[53:31] Hallelujah.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[53:35] My he had to be there when the Holy
[53:37] Ghost was being poured out because he
[53:39] was a manifestation of what Joel
[53:42] prophesied.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[53:45] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[53:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; That's why God will allow you to repent
[53:50] and get right because you may be the
[53:52] fulfillment of things to come.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[53:55] &gt;&gt; Wonderful. That's right.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; And church, what I love about it,
[53:59] Hallelujah. God gave Peter the keys to
[54:02] the kingdom, knowing he would deny him.
[54:06] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Knowing he would cuss,
[54:09] &gt;&gt; knowing he would walk away after Christ
[54:11] was crucified,
[54:12] &gt;&gt; sir.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; But he gave him the keys to the kingdom.
[54:15] And then he said, "Hallelujah.
[54:16] Hallelujah. You got power to remit."
[54:19] Hallelujah. Or retain sins. Or forgive
[54:22] sins. Hallelujah.
[54:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "I've given you that power."
[54:26] Hallelujah.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. My
[54:30] And Peter say, "I know not the man."
[54:33] &gt;&gt; Right, brother? Right.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; None of that bothers God.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Because what I want you to understand is
[54:40] you can't stop prophecy.
[54:43] &gt;&gt; There it is. Hallelujah.
[54:44] &gt;&gt; It's going to come to pass whether you
[54:46] like it or not.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Church, I had trips I ain't feel like
[54:53] going on.
[54:55] &gt;&gt; Right, brother?
[54:56] &gt;&gt; Tell your testimony.
[54:58] &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't know if I told this
[55:03] a year ago
[55:05] I was going to South Africa
[55:10] and I normally brother Jesse know I
[55:12] travel light but because I was going to
[55:15] be over there almost two weeks I travel
[55:17] with a bag bigger than what I normally
[55:19] do cuz I don't like to check my bag in
[55:23] cuz I don't like for my stuff to get
[55:24] lost.
[55:26] Hallelujah. If you ever have a bag lost,
[55:28] you're real cautious, cautious whenever
[55:31] you travel. I had a bag lost before. So
[55:34] now when I travel, I travel as light as
[55:37] I can. Hallelujah.
[55:39] So, but this time because I was going to
[55:41] be over there so long, I travel with a
[55:43] bigger bag.
[55:46] And I'm still talking about prophecy
[55:48] finding you.
[55:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I travel with a bigger bag.
[55:51] So I check the bag in. So I flew to I
[55:54] flew from Carolina to Atlanta and I was
[55:57] going from Atlanta to Joberg
[55:59] Johannesburg from Johannesburg to
[56:01] Durban, South Africa. H Once I hit
[56:04] Johannesburg, I'm in South Africa.
[56:06] Hallelujah. So but I had a layover for a
[56:09] day in Johannesburg.
[56:12] So I got a hotel room and I said, "Okay,
[56:15] I come back to the airport in the
[56:16] morning, finish the finish the rest of
[56:18] it to get me to Derban." So church, when
[56:22] I got on the plane, hallelujah, from
[56:25] Atlanta to Joberg, my bag didn't. Now, I
[56:28] didn't know that. So the next day, I get
[56:31] up, I fly down to Derban. I'm at the
[56:34] baggage thing, waiting on my bag. No
[56:36] bag. Pastor sitting there waiting on me.
[56:39] Me and him, I was like, I don't know
[56:40] where my bag at. No bag. No bag. 20
[56:43] minutes later, no bag. No bag. I said,
[56:45] "Okay, let me pull this ticket out and
[56:46] go to the counter." Go to the counter.
[56:48] Talk to the lady. Ladies, let me look it
[56:50] up. Oh my goodness.
[56:53] Your bag is not even here.
[57:02] All I got, hallelujah, is my book bag.
[57:07] But in my book bag, I got my toiletries.
[57:10] Hallelujah. Glory. Hallelujah. I got my
[57:14] Bible. Hallelujah.
[57:16] And my iPad. Hallelujah.
[57:19] and all my charges. Hallelujah.
[57:22] &gt;&gt; Oh my. So I don't feel as bad and I
[57:24] ain't got no clothes. Hallelujah. But at
[57:26] least I got some soap. Hallelujah.
[57:29] So anyway, hallelujah. The people say,
[57:32] "Well, we'll get your bag on this flight
[57:33] and send it to you." They say, "Okay,
[57:35] praise God." Hallelujah. That didn't
[57:36] happen before. One day, now we got to
[57:38] go. I got to go buy some clothes. Got
[57:40] money that I don't want to spend. Money
[57:43] that I need. Hallelujah. But now I got
[57:46] to go to the store, buy clothes, cuz I
[57:48] got a service at 3:00. I just got there
[57:50] at 11.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the pastor, he don't
[57:55] care about me not having clothes.
[57:58] He's like, "Come on, let's go. We'll
[57:59] just go get something. Come on. Come on.
[58:01] Come on." So, we go there, church, go to
[58:03] the store. Hallelujah. I get uh enough
[58:06] clothes to last me the weekend cuz I'm
[58:07] thinking my bag will be here by Monday.
[58:09] Hallelujah. So, I buy some pants, some
[58:11] shirts, and ties. Pants, shirts, and
[58:13] ties. at least maybe three pairs,
[58:15] something like that. Two pair because I
[58:16] had a couple services. You know, when
[58:17] you get to Africa, you ain't sitting
[58:19] still. You gonna preach. Hallelujah. So,
[58:21] I bought like three outfits, two three
[58:23] shirts, two three pair of pants,
[58:25] something like that. Hallelujah. Had to
[58:26] buy some shoes, too, cuz they had no
[58:28] dress shoes. Hallelujah. So, anyway,
[58:30] everybody all right? So, anyway,
[58:32] hallelujah. We had services and I mean,
[58:34] we preached. Hallelujah. So, the first
[58:35] night I got there, I said, "Hey, y'all
[58:37] pray for me because I'm feeling very
[58:40] uncomfortable.
[58:41] My bag was stuck in Atlanta and I have
[58:44] no clothes and now I got to preach.
[58:45] Y'all pray with me. I love to have my
[58:47] clothes. I love to put my stuff on.
[58:50] Hallelujah.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; I love to put it on. Hallelujah. But now
[58:55] I got some wood lights, some whatever
[58:58] you know some of that stuff. So I'm
[59:01] feeling very very uncomfortable, but I
[59:03] got to preach. So I preach, we have a
[59:04] good time, everything. So brother,

[59:10] up on uh and get my number. He say,
[59:12] "Hey, brother Dicks, uh, can I buy you
[59:16] some jeans?"
[59:18] Now, here come this false humility.
[59:22] I'm talking about me. False humility.
[59:24] Nah, brother. I'm all right. I'm good. I
[59:27] don't have no clothes
[59:31] and I'm telling this man, I'm good.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Trying to be humble.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; God knows who you are. We don't have to
[59:38] fake one another out. If God has put it
[59:41] on somebody's heart to bless you, just
[59:43] receive the blessing.
[59:46] &gt;&gt; Stop trying to be all super spiritual.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; I'm trusting God. God, hallelujah, is
[59:51] sending somebody to answer your prayers.
[59:53] And you putting on this false humility.
[59:55] No, I'm good. I appreciate you, brother.
[59:57] All is well.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; I got a pet peeve. Hallelujah. We know
[1:00:05] what a pet peeve is. You know, you

[1:00:15] you doing?" "By his grace." I'm like,
[1:00:17] "What?
[1:00:20] By his by his grace." I
[1:00:22] asked you how you was doing. You talking
[1:00:24] about by his grace.
[1:00:26] I'm doing fine. God bless you. That's
[1:00:29] all you got to do. You got to be all
[1:00:31] super spiritual. Hallelujah. By his
[1:00:33] grace.
[1:00:39] Hallelujah. But anyway, church.
[1:00:42] Hallelujah. I preached uh the brother
[1:00:43] say, "Hey, can I buy you can I buy you
[1:00:45] some jeans?" And then he started getting
[1:00:47] real uh uh uh specific. He says to me,
[1:00:51] "You're an American. Y'all like Levis's,
[1:00:53] don't you?"

[1:01:07] size and I I I I'll get you some Levis's
[1:01:10] and bring them to you tomorrow." And
[1:01:12] just like he said, he did that.
[1:01:13] Hallelujah.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; He bought me some Levis's and brought
[1:01:16] them to me. Hallelujah. I was like,
[1:01:17] "Praise the Lord." Hallelujah. Monday
[1:01:19] comes, no bag.
[1:01:21] Hallelujah. So, we go back and search
[1:01:23] the bag out. They didn't send the bag to
[1:01:26] London.
[1:01:31] I think they were looking at my
[1:01:33] itinerary because two weeks from there I
[1:01:35] was supposed to be in London.
[1:01:38] So they they they sent my bag. Everybody
[1:01:40] all right?

[1:01:46] know time go I'm preaching. Hallelujah.
[1:01:48] Got services all over the place. But now

[1:01:57] heart. Let me and my wife take you
[1:01:59] shopping. There go this false humility
[1:02:02] again. Nah, brother, you ain't got to do
[1:02:04] all that. I don't have no clothes.
[1:02:11] That's like you praying. You praying to
[1:02:13] the Lord. Say, "Lord," and I pray this
[1:02:14] prayer all say, "Lord, I just need more

[1:02:21] take care of the Lord is using you to
[1:02:24] take care of it,
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; right? and you rejected it because of
[1:02:27] your false humility.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; That person is a manifestation of your
[1:02:32] prayers being answered and you won't
[1:02:34] accept it because they go to church with
[1:02:36] you.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; Right, brother? Right.
[1:02:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

[1:03:21] again about the bag. time we we'll get
[1:03:24] back in touch with you. I said, "Well,

[1:05:34] though. I'm walking out and he says to
[1:05:36] me, he says, "Brother Diggs, the burden
[1:05:40] has lifted."
[1:05:42] I'm like, "Huh? The burden?" He says,
[1:05:44] "Yeah." He says about a year and a half
[1:05:47] to two years ago,
[1:05:49] there was a prophecy in church to me and
[1:05:51] my wife that somebody was going to come
[1:05:54] and y'all need to take them shopping.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; My bag was lost to fulfill that prophecy
[1:06:03] that was told to them.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So church, you can be a part
[1:06:08] of a prophecy and not even know it.
[1:06:12] You can be the fulfillment of something
[1:06:14] God is doing in somebody else's life.
[1:06:17] You can be the blessing.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; Church, I was a fulfillment of what God
[1:06:26] told them to do. Hallelujah. And instead
[1:06:28] of saying, "No, I'm good. I'm good. I'm
[1:06:30] good." And they wouldn't stop.
[1:06:32] Hallelujah. Until the prophecy was a
[1:06:34] manifestation.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:41] Just that trip alone,
[1:06:43] one young brother when he found out I
[1:06:46] was in the area, he said, "Lord, I want
[1:06:48] Brother Diggs to preach to me on my
[1:06:50] birthday."
[1:06:53] Now, I didn't even know it was his
[1:06:55] birthday. I had no intentions on coming
[1:06:57] to his church. Basically, I couldn't
[1:06:59] make it to his church cuz I was going
[1:07:01] someplace else. But then they asked me
[1:07:03] to preach at this place, but it was on a
[1:07:05] Wednesday and a camp meeting I was doing
[1:07:07] from Thursday to Sunday. So when that
[1:07:09] Wednesday came, I said, "No, I ain't
[1:07:10] preaching nowhere Wednesday. I'mma rest
[1:07:14] cuz from here on out I'm going to be
[1:07:16] preaching." So when the brother found
[1:07:18] the pastor found out that he called
[1:07:20] back, he said, "Where brother D's going
[1:07:22] to be at?" He said, "Well, the pastor,
[1:07:24] host pastor, he said, "Okay, you can get
[1:07:25] him Tuesday night." He said, "Praise the
[1:07:28] Lord." So we get there and I'm
[1:07:30] preaching. We having church. Everything
[1:07:31] is going. We're having a good time.
[1:07:33] Hallelujah. And after I finished
[1:07:34] preaching, he said, "This day the
[1:07:36] prophecy is fulfilled.
[1:07:38] He said, "You see that young man right
[1:07:39] there? He prayed a prayer and he came
[1:07:42] and told me, hallelujah, pastor, I want
[1:07:45] Brother Diggs to preach to me on my 21st
[1:07:48] birthday." And I wasn't even in the
[1:07:50] country yet.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; And God honored that prayer.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; I was there, hallelujah, preaching to
[1:08:02] him on his 21st birthday.
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The thing he prayed about
[1:08:08] became a manifestation. Hallelujah.
[1:08:10] Church, you can be a blessing of
[1:08:12] something God is doing.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; I got I got to close. I got to close.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; Prophecy will find you.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; But just to show where we are.
[1:08:26] Hallelujah. And brother Jesse can go
[1:08:28] back into these things. I'mma hit the
[1:08:29] highlights of it. Hallelujah. In 1954,
[1:08:32] the prophet prophesied that there'll be
[1:08:35] an American pope. Hallelujah.
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; 1954, 71 years 71 years later, in our
[1:08:42] day, we have an American pope.
[1:08:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Just like he
[1:08:46] prophesied, the pope today is a
[1:08:48] manifestation of what the prophet said
[1:08:50] was going to happen. Hallelujah. But
[1:08:52] just to show you, hallelujah, how,
[1:08:54] hallelujah, accurate and distinct God is
[1:08:57] when the prophet spoke that, hallelujah,
[1:09:00] nine to 10 months later, this pope was
[1:09:03] born
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; in 1954.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:11] &gt;&gt; So you may be speaking things into your
[1:09:14] own future.
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right.
[1:09:17] &gt;&gt; So the pope we have today is a
[1:09:19] fulfillment of what the prophet said in
[1:09:20] 1954. Hallelujah.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; He said that there'll be a woman that
[1:09:24] run the country. Already happened.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You can take your pick. It's
[1:09:29] a dual prophet prophecy. Hallelujah. You
[1:09:31] can say the Catholic Church or you can
[1:09:32] say it's Kamla Harris.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; Already happened. H. You say, "Bro, she
[1:09:37] was never the president." I beg your
[1:09:38] pardon.
[1:09:41] I beg your pardon. You say she was the
[1:09:42] vice president. You know, when Joe got
[1:09:44] sick, they had to swear somebody in to
[1:09:47] run the country. Who do they swear in?
[1:09:49] The vice president.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, in that moment, whether
[1:09:52] it was an hour, two hours, a week, a
[1:09:54] month, whatever it was, they swore her
[1:09:57] in as what? The leader of the country,
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; fulfilled.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; You say it could be the it could be it
[1:10:08] could be it could be the Catholic
[1:10:09] Church. Hallelujah. When Joe, slow Job,
[1:10:12] hallelujah, when he was elected in as
[1:10:15] prophet, you know what he did? He had a
[1:10:17] Catholic mass where he went and bowed
[1:10:19] down to the pope,
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; giving the Catholic church authority
[1:10:25] over the country.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; Already fulfilled.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; Prophecy will find us, church.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; These things are taking place. Well, you
[1:10:35] might not be paying attention to that.
[1:10:37] Well, let's look around. He said in Luke
[1:10:39] 17, it said, "Just like it was in the
[1:10:41] days of Noah. Just like it was in the
[1:10:42] days of Lot, the homosexuals got more
[1:10:44] rights than we got."
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; They they come picking they come pick at
[1:10:51] your restaurant or whatever, nobody say
[1:10:54] nothing.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; But as soon as you say something about
[1:10:56] them, it's bashing. It's hate crime.
[1:10:58] It's this. It's that.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; That's what Sodom and Gomorrah was all
[1:11:06] about. Read your Bible. God got tired of
[1:11:09] the filth.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; He got tired of all the things that were
[1:11:12] going on in Sodom. It says the couple of
[1:11:14] iniquity has reached up to God. And God
[1:11:16] said, "I'm going to destroy this place."
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; Homosexual demons.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; And you say, "Really? Are we in that
[1:11:24] day?" Yes, we are.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church. And God has put
[1:11:28] people in position to fulfill prophecy.
[1:11:31] Hallelujah. It's found us. Hallelujah.
[1:11:34] Where did the homosexuals get all these
[1:11:36] rights from? Y'all black President
[1:11:38] Barack Obama.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Preacher, brother.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; And we like we got a black president.
[1:11:47] Yeah. We've overcome. Ding dong. The
[1:11:51] witch is dead.
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; Don't realize it is every president, I
[1:12:00] don't care who you look at. Hallelujah.
[1:12:03] Every president is
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; this,
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; a puppet,
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; to fulfill God's word.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; It wasn't about black or white. It was
[1:12:17] about Obama putting laws in place to
[1:12:20] bring Sodom a reality like the Bible
[1:12:23] says.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; Obama let the right Hallelujah. I think
[1:12:29] it was 2010. Yeah. Forgive me, brother.
[1:12:32] You know, he it was 2010. He he he he he
[1:12:36] put into action, don't ask, don't tell
[1:12:38] in the military. Hallelujah. Well, you
[1:12:40] could be a homosexual or a lesbian and
[1:12:42] still be a part of the military. Before
[1:12:44] that act, you couldn't be a homosexual
[1:12:46] or lesbian and be a part of the armed
[1:12:48] forces.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; But Obama came in and made it okay
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; for men to shower with men.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Women to love on women.
[1:13:00] Hallelujah.
[1:13:02] What was it? He said just like it was in
[1:13:04] the days of Sodom.
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then in 2014, he
[1:13:10] Hallelujah. He didn't create the act,
[1:13:12] but he agreed with the Supreme Court to
[1:13:14] allow same-sex marriages.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; That's what happened in Obama's day in
[1:13:20] his term. Hallelujah. He was put in
[1:13:23] office. Why? To fulfill the prophecy of
[1:13:26] Sodom and Gomorrah.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And now they have homosexual
[1:13:30] rights. A woman can marry a woman. A man
[1:13:32] can marry a man. You know what Obama
[1:13:34] said? They asked him say, "What do you
[1:13:36] say?" He said, he said, "Leave it up to
[1:13:38] every state. They can do whatever they
[1:13:40] want to do."
[1:13:43] He put that into action
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; and we black president
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; so much bigger than what we looking at.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; It's prophecy being fulfilled.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; And then after him, Hallelujah. Trump
[1:14:01] gets in office. Oh my god.
[1:14:04] Hallelujah.
[1:14:06] I ain't like most most black people. I
[1:14:08] ain't got nothing against him.
[1:14:09] Hallelujah. I actually like him cuz he's
[1:14:10] the most funniest president we ever had.
[1:14:16] I said, "Mr. Trump, what do you think
[1:14:18] about Joe? You think he'll be able to to
[1:14:19] draw a good audience?" Oh, no. All Joe
[1:14:22] draws his flies.
[1:14:27] The man's hilarious. I I don't care what
[1:14:29] nobody say. The man's hilarious.
[1:14:31] Hallelujah. I don't care about his
[1:14:32] politics, none of that. The man's
[1:14:34] hilarious. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The
[1:14:36] Bible says that there will be pestilence
[1:14:39] in the land.
[1:14:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There'll be famines in the
[1:14:42] land in that end time. That's the
[1:14:45] prophecy. Famines and pestilence. You
[1:14:47] remember? Hallelujah. A while back, we
[1:14:49] had a famine of what? Eggs.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Church, we're in
[1:14:57] this day, in this time. We had a famine
[1:14:59] of eggs also under his reign.
[1:15:02] Hallelujah. Back in his first term, the
[1:15:04] the Bible where it says pestilence.
[1:15:06] Hallelujah.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Pestilence means plagues.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Under his term, we had one
[1:15:12] of the greatest plagues ever. What was
[1:15:14] it? COVID
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; 19.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Prophecy being fulfilled right before
[1:15:20] us.
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:15:26] And you know what church if you really
[1:15:28] really paying attention. Hallelujah.
[1:15:31] What was CO all about? CO was the
[1:15:34] forerun. Hallelujah. The preview of the
[1:15:38] one world government.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Yes. Very good.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Because I traveled and wherever you
[1:15:44] went, everybody was under the same
[1:15:46] rules.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; Talk about those those seven continents.
[1:15:50] When I went to Australia, they had masks
[1:15:53] on. went to Canada, they had mask on.
[1:15:55] Went to Asia, they had mask on. Went to
[1:15:57] Europe, they had mask on. And you
[1:15:59] couldn't go certain places without what?
[1:16:02] A shot.
[1:16:04] &gt;&gt; One world government.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Didn't matter how much money you had,
[1:16:11] didn't matter what family you came from,
[1:16:13] didn't matter your religion. Everybody
[1:16:15] had to operate under these rules.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:19] &gt;&gt; Or be penalized.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:23] See, church,
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; we're getting the preview of prophecy
[1:16:28] already. The fulfillment of it.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; How many know what I'm saying? I'm not
[1:16:33] making this up.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; It's in the Bible.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; Church, I've been places they wouldn't
[1:16:45] even let you in the store unless you
[1:16:46] showed them a vaccination.
[1:16:50] Delta wouldn't even let you fly if you
[1:16:52] if you ain't had a vaccination card.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Certain countries wouldn't even let you
[1:16:57] in. Australia wouldn't even let you in.
[1:17:00] Forget the quarantine. They weren't even
[1:17:02] letting you in. Nobody can go out.
[1:17:03] Nobody can come in.
[1:17:07] Oh my. But just to say that, oh my, you
[1:17:10] know, it was a disease and you know, and
[1:17:12] all of a sudden it just happened. I beg
[1:17:14] your pardon.
[1:17:17] If it was something that just happened,
[1:17:19] something that just arised and wasn't
[1:17:21] created.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Why did our president at the
[1:17:27] time, Trump, Hallelujah, when he got co
[1:17:30] everybody else quarantine 14 days or two
[1:17:34] weeks or two and a half weeks when he
[1:17:35] got it? No, no, I'm good. I'm good. I I
[1:17:37] don't need anything. I'm good. I'm good.
[1:17:39] His quarantine, hallelujah, was three to
[1:17:43] four days.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; And nothing happened to him,
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; Cuz he had the secret.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Secret wasn't some kind of potion.
[1:18:03] Remember, they never said there was a
[1:18:04] cure. Just take the shot.
[1:18:13] Hallelujah. I'm gonna leave this stuff
[1:18:14] alone, but I want to show you that we're
[1:18:16] in that day.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; We're in that time. Hallelujah.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; Where prophecy is being fulfilled. We
[1:18:21] see the mark of the beast.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Fulfilling itself, coming
[1:18:26] out. One world government where
[1:18:28] everything's going to fall under this
[1:18:29] channel. Hallelujah.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Don't get caught out here saying, "Well,
[1:18:32] I don't I don't know if I really want to
[1:18:34] be a Christian.
[1:18:38] This is not the time to have that kind
[1:18:40] of mindset
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; because if you can see the devil and all
[1:18:43] his tactics forming up, we see Sodom.
[1:18:45] Hallelujah. We see Noah's day.
[1:18:47] Hallelujah. We see families in the land.
[1:18:48] Hallelujah. There's still a war going on
[1:18:51] between Russia and and and Ukraine or
[1:18:53] wherever is at
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; still going. That's in the Bible. Wars
[1:18:56] and rumors of wars.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; It's happening right now. Hallelujah.
[1:19:00] Every time America gets out of a war,
[1:19:02] they're trying to put them back in one.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Bible says so wars and
[1:19:08] rumors of wars. Hallelujah. It say
[1:19:10] children will be disobedient to parents.
[1:19:12] Hallelujah.
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The love of many will wax
[1:19:15] cold. We seeing all these things.
[1:19:17] Hallelujah. Where loved ones are turning
[1:19:19] on each other, killing each other.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church in my old
[1:19:23] neighborhood. Hallelujah. A a son,
[1:19:26] hallelu, who was mentally challenged. He
[1:19:28] went in the house, killed his mama and
[1:19:30] his daddy and went to bed
[1:19:34] like nothing never happened.
[1:19:38] My oh my. We're in that time prophecies
[1:19:42] being fulfilled.
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; But in my closing, this is what I'll
[1:19:45] say.
[1:19:47] We can agree
[1:19:50] that we see everything the devil is
[1:19:52] doing.
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; We see Sodom,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; Gomorrah.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; We see the famines in the land. Amen.
[1:20:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We see the kingdoms of this
[1:20:08] world falling down.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Wars and rumors of wars.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Children disobedient to parents.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; Men's hearts are failing for fear.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; One of the greatest spirits right now
[1:20:26] wrestling in the church is fear.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's right.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. People won't fully and and and
[1:20:35] this is such a sorry excuse,
[1:20:38] brother Jesse. People won't fully give
[1:20:40] their heart to God because they say,
[1:20:41] "Well, I ain't ready." And this is what
[1:20:43] they say. Here's what they say. I ain't
[1:20:45] ready yet. Cuz when I serve the Lord, I
[1:20:47] really want to do it.
[1:20:52] I ain't I ain't sought for the Holy
[1:20:55] Ghost yet. Cuz when I do it, I really
[1:20:57] want to serve God. I don't want to go
[1:20:59] back.
[1:21:01] Just go ahead and say you like living
[1:21:03] the life you living.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Just just just just stop playing games
[1:21:09] and just say you don't want to be a
[1:21:10] Christian yet.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; And and don't say, "Well, I when I do
[1:21:15] it, I really want to do it. I really
[1:21:17] want to serve God.
[1:21:20] You ain't going to never make your mind
[1:21:22] up to do that.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; God got to do it for you."
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, it it'll it'll be none
[1:21:30] of us can keep ourselves. It's God
[1:21:32] keeping us.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because we're going to be
[1:21:35] tested and tried as long as we're here.
[1:21:38] But it's up to the Lord to keep us.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; It ain't up to me, Hallelujah. to prove
[1:21:44] God's a savior. It's up to God.
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; It ain't up to me to prove he's a
[1:21:48] provider. It's up to God. It ain't up to
[1:21:50] me to prove he's a healer. It's up to
[1:21:52] God. His reputation is on the line.
[1:21:59] But I say all that to say this. We can
[1:22:01] see the mark of the beast. We can see
[1:22:04] the country being being led by people
[1:22:07] fulfilling, hallelujah,
[1:22:09] &gt;&gt; the end time prophecy. We can see Sodom
[1:22:11] and Gomorrah. We see all these things.
[1:22:13] We see the devils getting ready to come
[1:22:15] to full strength. The Bible says the
[1:22:17] devil will incarnate in that pope.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We can see all these things
[1:22:22] taking place. So hallelujah. If we can
[1:22:25] see that, shouldn't we be able to see
[1:22:28] God?
[1:22:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we be able to see God stronger
[1:22:33] in our lives?
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we be able to see prayers
[1:22:36] answered?
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we be able to see a greater
[1:22:39] anointing in church?
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we see healings? Hallelujah.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we see the fulfillment of
[1:22:44] grace, the fulfillment of love?
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't our atmospheres in church bust
[1:22:50] through the darkness? Shouldn't there be
[1:22:53] more joy in the church,
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; more love, more peace?
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; If we can see the devil about to come to
[1:22:59] full strength, we should also be able to
[1:23:02] see God coming to full strength.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We should be to a place
[1:23:09] where we pray our loved ones back in
[1:23:11] church.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; If we can see the devil mounting up
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; about to ride into the sunset, we should
[1:23:22] also see God.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; We should see the wings of a snow white
[1:23:26] dog.
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; We should see that eagle anointing
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; moving among his people. Hallelujah.
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; Prophecy is not all about what the devil
[1:23:37] is doing.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Church. Hallelujah. The end
[1:23:40] of this the end of this message is God
[1:23:42] said, "Hallelujah. In that day, I'm
[1:23:45] going to present to myself,
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; a church without spot. Hallelujah.
[1:23:51] Without blemish, without wrinkle,
[1:23:53] hallelujah.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah,
[1:23:55] sir.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; So, we can see all these other things
[1:23:57] going on. Shouldn't we see oursel being
[1:23:59] cleaned up?
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Shouldn't we see ourselves getting The
[1:24:04] Bible says, hallelujah, his wife has
[1:24:06] made herself ready. Amen.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Church, I don't know about you, but I'm
[1:24:14] looking for God to do great things in my
[1:24:16] life.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Great things.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not praying small prayers anymore.
[1:24:22] He's a God that can do the impossible.
[1:24:26] [Applause]
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; That's what I'm looking for. I'm looking
[1:24:30] for the impossible to become possible.
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; Because he promised it.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He promised it, church.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; So if we see prophecy being fulfilled,
[1:24:42] there's a prophecy for you.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, hallelujah. In Isaiah,
[1:24:47] he said, "A virgin shall conceive."
[1:24:49] Hallelujah. That was 6 700 years out
[1:24:52] there in the air,
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; but then it found the person that would
[1:24:56] fulfill it in Mary.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; That word was put out there. Hallelujah.
[1:25:02] But there was somebody to be the
[1:25:03] manifestation of that word and it was
[1:25:05] Mary. Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Isaiah also said, hallelujah, there's a
[1:25:09] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[1:25:11] some 600, 700 years. And then here comes
[1:25:13] a John. Hallelujah. John looks so much
[1:25:15] like Christ. They say, John, who are
[1:25:16] you? He said, I'm the voice of one
[1:25:18] crying in the wilderness.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; What was he? Prophecy found him. He was
[1:25:22] the manifestation of what Isaiah
[1:25:24] prophesied.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; Who are we? We are the manifestation of
[1:25:29] what William Brennham prophesied.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation of Joel.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation of another book
[1:25:38] of acts.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation of Revelations
[1:25:42] 10. Hallelujah. 8 through 11.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; We are the manifestation.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Brother Burnham has fulfilled his part.
[1:25:53] Now we got a part to play.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; We are fulfillment of prophecy.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Hallelujah. Jesus.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Musicians come. Amen.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; I know this kind of felt like a Bible
[1:26:06] study, but don't take it light.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; Find out where you are.
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; Yes. Glory.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; Just like there was a Goliath, there was
[1:26:15] a David to destroy Goliath.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Good.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; And what I want you to realize, when
[1:26:21] Goliath was born, David was born in that
[1:26:23] time to challenge him.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So whatever the enemy is
[1:26:30] doing in a particular time, there's a
[1:26:32] people born to resist it.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; There's a people born to defeat it.
[1:26:38] Hallelujah.
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; So I want you to understand, no matter
[1:26:40] what's going on in this world, you were
[1:26:42] born in a day to show that your God is
[1:26:44] real.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; My God is real.

[1:27:00] our head down this morning. We going to
[1:27:02] leave out here celebrating because we
[1:27:04] are the fulfillment of the word.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; We are the fulfillment of the end time
[1:27:09] message.

[1:27:12] the future.
