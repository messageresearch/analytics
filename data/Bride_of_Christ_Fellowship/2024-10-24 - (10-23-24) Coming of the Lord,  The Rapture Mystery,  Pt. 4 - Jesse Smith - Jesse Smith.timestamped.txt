[0:52] recess I don't blame her you don't want
[0:54] to get that you don't want to get that
[0:56] dress dirty there so but I was so
[0:58] thankful and uh
[1:01] God is good so I was thinking about uh
[1:03] her mom said you need to go Ghan today I
[1:05] said okay I'm going ghanan by God's
[1:07] grace so thank you for those clothes and
[1:10] everybody I walk by in the hallway
[1:12] they're like whoa what a shirt brother
[1:14] Jess or not brother Jess Mr
[1:16] Smith um and I told each one of them you
[1:18] know we have this Godly Gan family in
[1:21] our church and the family showed love
[1:23] and made and they're like wow they gave
[1:26] you the clothes and so uh the love of
[1:29] God is surely being shared by God's
[1:31] grace so thank you it's a joy I try to
[1:34] wear it once a
[1:35] year that that's to school so we want to
[1:38] look here to the word of God and uh the
[1:40] coming of the lord The Rapture mystery
[1:42] part four kind of felt led to come back
[1:44] to this here I felt like if I get away
[1:46] from it too long I might not get back to
[1:47] it so I want to get to it uh that song
[1:49] says recognizing your day serpent seed
[1:52] perfect Faith the breach and the message
[1:53] of Grace I preached through all five of
[1:55] those and now we're on the coming of the
[1:56] lord The Rapture mystery the next will
[1:58] be God in Simplicity the spoken words
[2:00] Original Seed and then I feel like I'll
[2:01] have this series done brother William
[2:04] it's been a great series started in 2024
[2:07] it's been refreshing I have loved just
[2:09] going slowly through brother Ram's
[2:10] sermons and seeing the thoughts that he
[2:12] preaches and uh seeing the battles we'll
[2:15] see here tonight another battle he's he
[2:16] fought here but uh just knowing that if
[2:19] he made it through by God's grace and
[2:20] everything was all right we'll make it
[2:22] through by the grace of God as well have
[2:24] to trust in the Lord with all of our
[2:25] hearts and lean not to our own
[2:27] understanding Hallelujah
[2:30] Psalm 27 now brother R reads this uh for
[2:33] his text from the Rapture December 4th
[2:36] 1965 now that's where I'm hoping to get
[2:38] to I can't promise that
[2:42] um I can hardly promise when I say 15
[2:44] more minutes you know I can hardly get
[2:46] to that so I'm not going to promise
[2:48] anything but um so I was listening to
[2:51] that been listening to it off and on
[2:53] over the last few weeks and uh try to
[2:55] get to that I like to preach through
[2:56] that whole sermon as well it's I think
[2:58] it's only an hour and 40 um he was
[3:00] getting rushed out Remember by there
[3:02] they were in a hotel room and he was
[3:03] getting rushed out by the woman and uh
[3:05] he said well I finished you know he
[3:06] finished and then he's like I got 10
[3:08] pages left of notes on the Rapture boy I
[3:10] would like to get those notes wouldn't
[3:11] you brother I do about anything to get
[3:13] those
[3:14] notes see what the prophet had in his
[3:16] heart that he could he said he couldn't
[3:17] get to 10 pages of notes on the Rapture
[3:21] but God is good God's faithful and the
[3:22] Holy Ghost will guide us into all truth
[3:24] praise God no matter what we have as
[3:25] long as we're born again uh we have the
[3:28] Holy Ghost uh to give us all have need
[3:30] of so Psalm
[3:31] 271 um I'll read 1 through 4 it's a long
[3:35] longer text there and then we'll all
[3:36] read 5 five of course is speaking of the
[3:38] Rapture according to brother brandom he
[3:40] saw a type in here so one through four
[3:43] I'll read that the Lord is my light and
[3:44] my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord
[3:47] is the strength of my life of whom shall
[3:49] I be
[3:50] afraid reminds us of Jesus who said
[3:53] Don't Fear those who can destroy the
[3:54] body right fear Him who can destroy both
[3:57] the body and soul in hell verse two when
[4:00] the wicked even mine enemies and my foes
[4:02] Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they
[4:04] stumbled and fell though in host should
[4:07] encamp against me my heart shall not
[4:09] fear though War should rise against me
[4:11] in this will I be confident one thing
[4:14] have I desired of the Lord that I will
[4:17] seek after that I may dwell in the house
[4:19] of the Lord all the days of my life to
[4:22] behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[4:24] inquire in his Temple this is a man
[4:26] after God's Own Heart what's his
[4:28] greatest desire to be in the house house
[4:29] of the Lord hallelujah let's read verse
[4:32] 5 1 2 3 for in the time of trouble he
[4:36] shall hide me in his Pavilion in the
[4:39] secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide
[4:42] me he shall set me up upon a rock may
[4:46] God add his Blessing to the reading of
[4:47] his word you can be seated God bless
[4:54] you okay so I'm going to try to watch
[4:56] time as well here by the grace of the
[4:57] Lord
[5:00] Hallelujah now we want to just briefly
[5:02] review this is part four we looked at
[5:04] part one now part one we looked at uh
[5:06] the first part of this sermon 1958 the
[5:08] sudden secret going away the church in
[5:10] Parts two and three we kind of looked at
[5:13] uh the attack against the Scofield bible
[5:16] and the uh uh the pre-tribulation
[5:19] Rapture and then we looked at you know
[5:21] Matthew 24 and then we looked at second
[5:23] Thessalonians chapter 2 looking at the
[5:25] scriptures about the Antichrist and
[5:27] whether the church would see the
[5:29] Antichrist I don't think there's any uh
[5:31] proof in the uh Bible that the church
[5:34] sees the Antichrist um there may be
[5:37] hints of course and you know we don't
[5:38] know all the details um but there will
[5:40] be a little bit of a a squeeze time
[5:43] where we'll hear about the mark of the
[5:44] beast but Jesus said in Revelation 3:10
[5:47] we will not go through that Temptation
[5:50] with the rest of the world he promised
[5:52] because we kept the word of his patience
[5:55] that hour will not come upon us
[5:56] hallelujah and I had a great you know I
[5:59] had I felt like it was a great
[6:00] understanding to me that actual Mark
[6:02] can't even be laid down while the
[6:05] 144,000 are on the Earth right because
[6:08] then they'd be killed right or they if
[6:10] they took the mark they' take the mark
[6:12] of the beast right so that Mark actually
[6:14] has to be laid down I believe during the
[6:16] second half of the seven-year Great
[6:18] Tribulation period to me that just seems
[6:21] logical um so that's just a interesting
[6:23] thought they're thinking about the
[6:24] timing I'm going to make a video on that
[6:26] pretty soon I had a request to make a
[6:27] video on the order of the events of the
[6:29] tribulation period uh but uh then now
[6:32] here's part four I'm just going to
[6:34] briefly finish uh this the highlights
[6:35] from this sermon 1958 the sudden secret
[6:38] going away the church uh last time of
[6:40] course we looked at remember the the
[6:41] attack on Pearl Harbor right and how
[6:43] brother man was bringing out this idea
[6:44] of a sudden secret destruction right um
[6:48] uh and then he uh he told us the
[6:50] scriptures that prepared him so we'll
[6:51] get to that here now we left off with
[6:53] brother Ram uh getting into this tax
[6:55] case so he was right in the mix of his
[6:58] uh in the middle of his tax case where
[7:01] he had been uh sued here he was sued for
[7:05] uh past taxes owed on money that he'd
[7:08] signed over people would write out
[7:10] donation checks to his campaign and they
[7:12] just write out William brandom he'd sign
[7:13] it over and give it right over to the
[7:15] church but the IRS came on and they uh
[7:18] said you owe taxes on all that because
[7:20] it was in your name they didn't write
[7:22] out the brandom Tabernacle and so
[7:24] brother random fought it as hard as he
[7:26] could uh and it became a very hard thing
[7:29] for for him but he says this I've been
[7:31] in trials for the last 3 or 4 months
[7:33] under heavy fire so not physical fire
[7:36] with guns or anything like that but
[7:39] spiritual fire right criticizing right
[7:42] uh uh attacks on him on his character
[7:44] he's going to tell us about it here
[7:46] under heavy fire trying to accuse me of
[7:48] doing something that was wrong by
[7:51] passing the money through this
[7:52] Tabernacle here for the meetings which
[7:55] our trustee board here has signed the
[7:57] Declaration and there's not a person
[7:58] that's ever attended in my meetings but
[8:00] what I publicly announced that this
[8:01] money was taken up directed through the
[8:04] church and now they say because I place
[8:06] it through the church I was trying to
[8:07] defraud the government and want to give
[8:09] me 20 years in Fort lenworth Kansas for
[8:13] it so he was threatened with 20 years in
[8:16] prison because of all this money that
[8:18] flowed through there now at some point I
[8:20] forgot to do this we need to do a
[8:22] inflation calculator on
[8:24] 1958 on 40,000 he only had to pay 40,000
[8:28] so I wonder the inflation might be
[8:30] probably around 300,000 or something
[8:31] like that maybe maybe more
[8:35] um and then remember God had a
[8:37] millionaire in his church brother da who
[8:39] he baptized when he was in his 90s and
[8:42] uh the millionaire just loved brother
[8:44] brandom as a brother and his ministry
[8:46] and that brother paid off his debt right
[8:49] and then he could go and he could say uh
[8:50] my debts been paid I've been cleared he
[8:52] said I'm free Hallelujah his debts been
[8:55] paid he said pardon that was the pardon
[8:56] sermon if you listen to the pardoned I
[8:58] think it's 1965 either 63 or 65 and so
[9:01] he ex he enjoyed the freedom of being
[9:04] pardoned and he says I said what is the
[9:07] word wrote over our courthouses Justice
[9:10] it means no more than it wasn't even
[9:11] wrote there said when everything that
[9:13] your own people told me to do I've done
[9:15] it and now you say that they're not with
[9:17] the government anymore how can you
[9:19] you'll settle one and prove it out then
[9:21] they'll dig something else up so brother
[9:23] Braham said there was numerous people
[9:25] working at the beginning of the case he
[9:26] did everything they said those people
[9:27] left they brought in new people to bring
[9:29] bringing new charges against him talk
[9:31] about discouragement that'd be a hard
[9:33] three or four months and the church said
[9:36] get new accusations new new things and
[9:38] they're just digging up trash against
[9:40] you sounds like a presidential campaign
[9:42] doesn't
[9:44] it accusing him and just trying to find
[9:46] all the dirt in their history right
[9:48] we've seen all the dirt in both of their
[9:50] histories the candidates well I guess
[9:51] all three right because it switched at
[9:52] the end and now we got a a different
[9:55] candidate here for the Democrats right
[9:57] he says uh not only that but they
[9:59] wishy-washy so brother BR says they're
[10:02] wishy-washy and remember we went through
[10:04] how uh these other preachers went
[10:06] through a lot of persecution John Wesley
[10:08] they threw stones at him uh they yelled
[10:11] till he left their churches he had to go
[10:13] preach out in the fields uh Martin
[10:14] Luther was arrested but then he was
[10:17] rescued from the arrest and had to dress
[10:18] up like a soldier uh in order to uh uh
[10:22] translate the Bible into his German
[10:24] language Hallelujah but man said the
[10:26] prophets of God were always attacked by
[10:28] the government this proves brother was
[10:29] another proof brother R was a true
[10:31] prophet of God the government went after
[10:34] him to try to stop him discourage him
[10:35] keep him off the
[10:37] field remember Rome went after John the
[10:39] Baptist Jesus Paul and they kept digging
[10:42] up accusations after brother Bram had
[10:44] already met their request and threatened
[10:47] with 20 years in
[10:51] prison brother Ram says so I have one
[10:53] hand to hold on to that's God's
[10:55] unchanging hand and I didn't even plan
[10:58] to sing that song so that was a nice
[11:00] little confirmation there knowing that
[11:02] he will respect truth and honor that's
[11:04] what God respects it'll have to come
[11:06] forth in justice but to let you know
[11:08] there's in not hopes nowhere only in the
[11:11] coming of the
[11:12] Lord he said such a day we're living in
[11:14] such an awful time he says when even the
[11:17] church itself the church peoples the
[11:18] denominations those they're so concerned
[11:20] about their little differences till they
[11:22] won't even fellowship with one another
[11:24] and not taking warning that the coming
[11:27] of the Lord is at hand men such as Billy
[11:30] Graham Jack Schuler or Roberts and many
[11:32] of the Great evangelists Charles Fuller
[11:34] who has an Outreach to the whole world
[11:36] now radio Outreach that's that's what
[11:37] he's talking about a radio Outreach
[11:39] right so what's wrong with a radio
[11:40] Outreach nothing what's wrong with the
[11:41] YouTube Ministry nothing right it's an
[11:44] Outreach it's trying to help people he
[11:46] said they do everything they can to warn
[11:48] the coming of the Lord and those own men
[11:51] those men who try to do right is the men
[11:54] that our government tries to tear to
[11:56] pieces I said to someone Mister 28 years
[11:59] of my life I've laid on the altar of God
[12:01] to try to do right and I want someone to
[12:03] look me in the eye and tell me if I ever
[12:04] beat anyone out of anything ever stole
[12:07] anything in my life by the grace of God
[12:09] I'm clear that's what he would told he
[12:10] would tell the lawyers in those meetings
[12:12] look me in the eye and tell me what did
[12:13] I ever steal from
[12:17] anybody and and then they said well
[12:19] brother baham did you go to your church
[12:20] board and tell them you were doing
[12:22] such oh no I'm sorry I i' I've Mis I
[12:25] misplaced my yeah I misplaced my call I
[12:27] jumped ahead sorry he says uh that means
[12:30] no more to that than the snap of your
[12:32] finger he said they said you're guilty
[12:33] anyhow brother Brandon and you're a
[12:35] dictator in your church you snap your
[12:37] finger and your church does what you
[12:38] tell them to
[12:39] do he said oh I said how unjust can men
[12:43] be that's actually a sign that the
[12:45] church is a good church if they listen
[12:47] to their
[12:49] Pastor yeah amen hallelujah now as long
[12:52] as they're telling you to do the word of
[12:53] God hallelujah that's
[12:56] right he said uh he said you gave people
[12:59] the gifts when their homes burnt so they
[13:02] were digging into brother braham's
[13:03] records of his giving with the money
[13:06] brother baham gave money to people when
[13:07] their homes burnt down we've sent a
[13:09] little bit but since I don't know the
[13:11] people I didn't send a whole lot but
[13:12] we've done the same thing here's your
[13:14] checks where you gave widows hundreds of
[13:16] dollars and paid their rent for them our
[13:18] church has done some of that over the
[13:20] years right and done things like that
[13:23] did you ever go to your church board and
[13:24] tell them what you're doing I said ' no
[13:26] sir and they said 'why didn't you do it'
[13:29] he said the Lord told me in his word I
[13:31] like that that's what we need to say

[16:51] your money get your wedding dress in one
[16:53] year I'll be back a year from today I'm
[16:55] coming back now this a doesn't it's not
[16:56] a perfect type because we don't know the
[16:58] day or the hour
[17:00] he said but in one year I'll be back
[17:01] make yourself ready well the the son
[17:03] left and all the girls were disappointed
[17:05] but pretty soon they saw her you know
[17:07] over the course of 12 months they saw
[17:08] her buy a dress and all these things and
[17:10] and they'd walk into the room and she'd
[17:12] have a dress on what do you got a dress
[17:13] on for who you who you marrying she
[17:15] tried to keep it a secret as long as she
[17:16] could but as that year came down to
[17:19] close uh she told him I'm I'm I'm giving
[17:21] you my two weeks
[17:23] notice you have to find somebody else to
[17:25] wash the dishes amen hallelujah and then
[17:28] the the the cousins found out and they
[17:31] started joking and and teasing her oh
[17:33] you think this Rich guy's going to marry
[17:35] a dishwasher a little nobody like
[17:38] you and uh she just she just brother man
[17:41] said she just stuck her chin up in the
[17:42] air and said he promised Hallelujah and
[17:45] brother said that's what we've got we've
[17:46] got a son who's promised us he'll marry
[17:48] us hallelujah we're not as pretty as
[17:51] other churches not as fancy as other
[17:52] churches but God's not looking for
[17:54] outward he's looking for inward
[17:55] character Hallelujah glory to God I like
[17:58] that story amen I wash dishes a lot well
[18:00] not a lot Mal I washes them now but I
[18:02] used to thanks for washing dishes buddy
[18:05] he's helped me out a lot by God's
[18:07] grace but you know uh it came down to
[18:10] those Final hours and it was coming it
[18:11] was exactly a year from from the time
[18:15] and brother said she stood out there all
[18:16] day in her wedding dress and the whole
[18:18] time the cousins are walking around
[18:20] mocking her maybe kicking dust on her
[18:23] brother R said she just stood there he
[18:25] promised he's coming oh he's not coming
[18:27] for you he gave me his word he's coming
[18:30] for me yes and brother said the the the
[18:33] sun was going down and brother is using
[18:35] this to show the Rapture hallelujah
[18:37] praise God and the sun's going down and
[18:39] the the pretty soon the cousins are just
[18:41] tired of teasing her but she stands out
[18:43] there anyway and pretty soon he starts
[18:45] hearing the horse Hooves Hallelujah and
[18:48] pretty soon breaking through uh uh the
[18:51] the the sunset I'm sorry the sun yeah
[18:52] the sunset there is a carriage and
[18:55] there's a handsome man on there and he
[18:58] pulls up really fast and all the cousins
[18:59] are waking up and he jumps off there
[19:01] brother said he grabbed her gave her a
[19:03] big
[19:04] kiss and he said come with me it's time
[19:06] to go home and he said he he she put he
[19:10] put her in there and they and she waved
[19:12] goodbye I'm going to my future home
[19:14] hallelujah praise God brother said it's
[19:16] a type of Jesus Christ rapturing us away
[19:19] at a time when we don't know the day or
[19:21] the hour but we got to get ready
[19:23] Hallelujah so brother ends with that
[19:25] story to say the wife has made herself
[19:27] ready Hallelujah
[19:30] I'll say like this church it don't it
[19:31] don't always look pretty the Christian
[19:33] life isn't always flashy and signs
[19:35] wonders and miracles sometimes there's
[19:37] dishwashing got to get your hands uh all
[19:41] well you
[19:41] know got to get your hands dirty
[19:44] Hallelujah so he ends with that and then
[19:46] he ends with this verse Matthew
[19:48] 24 where the Bible said Jesus said there
[19:51] will be one left and one taken that's
[19:53] the story of the woman the the young
[19:55] woman the dishwasher was taken the
[19:57] others were left
[19:59] hallelujah amen so this is the scripture
[20:01] brother r ends with he said uh it's he
[20:03] said that we have to have preparation
[20:06] and we've got to have our meat in due
[20:08] season
[20:09] Hallelujah and that's what we need today
[20:11] we need the word of God In Due season to
[20:14] keep us ready for the Rapture hallelujah
[20:16] amen now I'm going to move on now so
[20:18] that's about the end of that sermon it
[20:20] was a beautiful message if you haven't
[20:21] listened to it I'd encourage you to do
[20:22] it praise
[20:23] God now I want to uh before I get to the
[20:27] Rapture 65 I I want to rehearse the six
[20:30] reasons the Rapture is pre-tribulation
[20:32] because remember these famous guys
[20:33] Tucker and U John rich and of course uh
[20:37] other people they always attack the
[20:39] pre-tribulation Rapture because they
[20:41] can't see it in the scripture but I just
[20:43] heard brother maram say it today the
[20:45] reason they can't they can't see it is
[20:47] because they're not ordained to see it
[20:50] and I'm talking about from God's
[20:51] perspective now from God's perspective
[20:54] God knows who's going to receive it and
[20:55] who's not going to right and from God's
[20:58] perspective it doesn't matter who Wills
[21:00] or runs it's God who shows Mercy
[21:02] hallelujah amen but from man's
[21:04] perspective the elect say I'm going to
[21:05] choose to follow Christ with my free
[21:08] more agency
[21:09] Hallelujah so brother says and a brother
[21:11] sent me the quote wonderful brother who
[21:14] supports this church he sent me a quote
[21:15] this weekend he said help me understand
[21:17] that brother Ram says if you're not
[21:19] saved today he said God has made a way
[21:21] for you to be saved today he said it's
[21:22] called free moral agency Hallelujah he
[21:25] said God gave you something you can do
[21:27] about it Hallelujah and he said help me
[21:29] understand this I saides I said you can
[21:31] understand it because there's two
[21:32] perspectives from God's perspective all
[21:35] that the father has given him will come
[21:37] but from man's perspective the Bible
[21:39] says choose you this day whom you will
[21:41] serve Hallelujah am amen so that that
[21:44] that quote fits perfectly there's
[21:46] something we can do about it we got to
[21:48] bring our free moreal agency into
[21:50] subjection to the word of God hallelujah
[21:53] everybody understand so anytime you talk
[21:55] about free war agency you're talking
[21:57] about from man's persp itive not God's
[22:01] it's just like Works versus uh you know
[22:03] the works debate are we saved by works
[22:05] works or or faith right it's just like
[22:08] that all right uh works is what man sees
[22:11] faith is what God sees hallelujah we're
[22:13] not saved by works we're saved by grace
[22:15] but if you have Grace if you receive
[22:16] Grace then you got peace Hallelujah and
[22:19] then if you got the love of God love
[22:20] motivates your faith faith causes you to
[22:23] work hallelujah oh that's right amen now
[22:27] I'm not going to ask this but can
[22:28] anybody name the six reasons the
[22:30] raptures pre-tribulation anybody got it
[22:32] memorized I didn't think so that's why I
[22:34] thought I'd go over it hallelujah
[22:36] hallelujah just a little joke there I
[22:39] sometimes forget all of them too the
[22:41] first reason is the Great Tribulation
[22:43] period is described as trouble for
[22:45] Israel in Daniel 12 vers1 but it's uh
[22:48] and also Jeremiah 30:7 it's called the
[22:50] time of trouble it's called Jacob's
[22:53] trouble and it's trouble for the foolish
[22:55] virgins we can see that in The Parables
[22:57] right we can see in the the parable of
[22:59] the the 10 virgins and it's trouble for
[23:02] Sinners of course right because they get
[23:04] sudden destruction but not for Holy
[23:06] Ghost filled Saints Hallelujah there's
[23:10] nothing in the Bible that says the bride
[23:12] will go through the tribulation period
[23:14] the bride now the church will but not
[23:16] the bride Hallelujah the second reason
[23:19] there's no mention of Christ's bride or
[23:21] church in the tribulation text in the
[23:24] Book of
[23:24] Revelation the word church appears 19
[23:27] times and I'm reading course out of my
[23:28] book that I wrote that's why I wrote it
[23:29] so I can reference it hallelujah it's
[23:32] been a great reference too uh the church
[23:34] appears 19 times in Revelation but the
[23:36] word is absent from Revelation 3:22 to
[23:40] 22:16 you don't see in any of those
[23:42] chapters 4 5 6 7 all the way up to 22
[23:44] you don't see it so if the Bible's
[23:47] silent on the church the church must be
[23:49] off the Earth Hallelujah the church must
[23:51] be gone to be with Jesus Hallelujah
[23:54] that's right amen
[23:56] hallelujah clear it's it's plain to see
[23:59] that Hallelujah now there are a few
[24:01] times of course in Romans I'm sorry in
[24:02] Revelation 14 and 16 where uh the Bible
[24:06] talks about the church or the bride and
[24:08] it's just it's placed there so because
[24:10] Jesus knew we'd have we'd have the Book
[24:12] of Revelation for 2,000 years and we
[24:14] would read over these texts and the
[24:16] Bible re uh Records that we should be
[24:18] encouraged as we read the book of
[24:20] Revelation Hallelujah and then the Bible
[24:22] also said come out of her my people in
[24:23] Revelation 18:4 right so the only people
[24:26] that could come out would be the bride
[24:27] Hallelujah right so we can see that now
[24:30] reason three I'm going to go quickly
[24:31] like I said I'm going to try to get
[24:32] quickly through you the bride or true
[24:34] church is specifically promised a pardon
[24:37] from God's Divine wrath okay that's in 1
[24:40] Thessalonians 5:4 you are not in
[24:42] darkness that the day should overtake
[24:44] you as a
[24:45] thief and then 1 Thessalonians 5:9 I
[24:47] love this remember I told you there's
[24:49] one preacher he goes to bed every night
[24:50] I forget his name he goes to bed every
[24:52] night saying this verse for God hath not
[24:55] appointed us to wrath but to obtain Sal
[24:59] by our Lord Jesus Christ what a good way
[25:01] to close your eyes and rest Hallelujah
[25:03] God's not appointed me to wrath he's
[25:05] appointed me to Salvation
[25:09] Hallelujah 1 Thessalonians 1 ver10 and
[25:13] to wait for his son Jesus from Heaven
[25:15] whom he raised from the dead even Jesus
[25:17] which delivered us from the Wrath to
[25:20] come Romans 5:9 much now more being
[25:24] justified by his blood we shall be saved
[25:26] from wrath through him him remember that
[25:30] good old verse I didn't not on here I
[25:31] could have put on here that good old
[25:33] verse uh Genesis 19 God will not suffer
[25:37] the righteous to be punished with the
[25:39] wicked Hallelujah he thank God he's the
[25:41] same yesterday today and forever if God
[25:44] saved a righteous foolish virgin like
[25:46] lot if God saved him from the wrath of
[25:48] God God Will Save anybody from the wrath
[25:50] of God who believes God's word amen even
[25:53] just a small portion of it
[25:55] Hallelujah that's right
[25:58] a man I you know I didn't get the lot on
[26:00] my double-minded series I didn't get the
[26:01] lot lot was so double-minded he's like
[26:04] uh homosexuality is awful take my
[26:07] daughters
[26:09] what the church
[26:11] said he was so double mind no one no
[26:13] wonder the Bible said he was scarcely
[26:15] saved he barely was
[26:17] saved see double-minded oh he recognize
[26:20] oh Abomination wouldn't it be
[26:21] Abomination to give your daughters a
[26:22] bunch of
[26:24] sodomites
[26:25] Hallelujah right so that that's that
[26:27] serious going on Hallelujah probably
[26:30] will one day I'll probably get back to
[26:31] it by God's grace uh Revelation 3:10
[26:34] because thou has kept the word of my
[26:35] patience I will also keep thee from the
[26:37] hour everybody say the hour of
[26:39] Temptation which will come upon the
[26:41] whole world what's that the mark of the
[26:42] beast to I'm sorry to try them that
[26:45] dwell upon the Earth see all these tests
[26:47] we go through church they're just trials
[26:49] God's trying us he's refining us like
[26:52] gold refined in fire hallelujah amen
[26:55] amen it's just making us love God more
[26:57] it's making going to serve God better
[27:00] it's going to make us more thankful
[27:01] later on down the line why is this guy
[27:04] and his wife so happy over here because
[27:05] they've seen 40 Years of God bringing
[27:08] them through every trial amen and see
[27:11] God protected the next two generations
[27:13] amen hallelujah he's seen it he has
[27:16] enough experience to know that God backs
[27:18] up his word
[27:20] hallelujah some of us younger ones we
[27:22] don't have that much confidence yet you
[27:23] know we're just still going through the
[27:25] trials and learning the hard way
[27:26] sometimes
[27:28] but God promised these things Luke 21:36
[27:31] watch ye therefore pray always right
[27:33] like the Bible said pray without ceasing
[27:36] don't get a break on that when we are
[27:37] supposed to pray all the time I also
[27:39] will keep thee from the hour
[27:41] Temptation NOP I'm I'm off nope I said
[27:44] wrong watch ye therefore pray ours that
[27:45] ye may be accounted worthy to escape all
[27:49] things that shall come upon I'm sorry
[27:51] that shall come to pass and to stand
[27:53] before the son of man how uh how many
[27:55] like the word Escape that's that's a
[27:57] that's a beautiful word right there
[27:59] you'll Escape all things and stand
[28:01] before the son of man the body of Jesus
[28:04] Christ the glorified body hallelujah
[28:05] amen you'll Escape it if you watch and
[28:09] pray always keep watching keep praying
[28:13] we should sing that song in South
[28:14] America just keep on
[28:17] praying for the Lord is
[28:20] not just keep on praying sing it with me
[28:24] if you know he hear your
[28:26] cry for for the Lord has
[28:30] promised and his word is
[28:33] true just keep on
[28:37] pray he'll answer you how many remember
[28:41] that now nobody well it's been too long
[28:43] brother now we know what we got to do
[28:44] today Hallelujah before we leave this
[28:46] place we got to sing that you remind me
[28:47] if I forget and then our our verse for
[28:50] tonight Psalm 275 for in the time of
[28:53] trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[28:56] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall
[28:58] hide me he shall set me up upon a rock
[29:02] so look at this look at this picture
[29:03] you're in a tabernacle and you're up on
[29:06] a rock how does that work I don't know
[29:08] but it's glorious amen I know it's
[29:10] inspired Hallelujah there must be some
[29:12] rock sitting in some Tabernacle
[29:14] somewhere Christ is the rock
[29:17] hallelujah amen he's the water he's the
[29:19] Rock Amen he's the line he's the lamb
[29:21] amen he's the door he's all things
[29:23] through the believer Hallelujah
[29:30] now darn could you while you got your
[29:33] Bible there darn could you look up that
[29:35] Genesis verse about the dove because my
[29:37] wife found a real good type of the
[29:39] Rapture a couple well it's been a while
[29:41] now I want brother Mercy I think I'm
[29:43] preach a whole sermon on it by God's
[29:45] grace if I want to give credit where
[29:46] credit's
[29:47] due this wasn't my thought my wife had a
[29:49] good thought uh reason number four the
[29:52] the raptures pre-tribulation the bride
[29:54] or true church is foreshadowed to
[29:57] receive a part pardon from God's Divine
[29:59] wrath so there's five examples I put in
[30:02] the book three are Old Testament events
[30:04] and two are Jesus's Parables that
[30:06] foreshadow the bride's pardon from
[30:08] Divine wrath everybody say Enoch ready
[30:11] Enoch missed the flood right he was
[30:15] pardoned he didn't have to do that he
[30:16] have to go through that uh now Noah was
[30:19] pardoned uh from the
[30:21] destruction right so that's another
[30:23] partial type and third lot now we know
[30:26] those two are foolish versin right but
[30:27] you have en O then you have two foolish
[30:29] virgin types uh lot was pardoned okay uh
[30:34] and then the Jesus parable on the King's
[30:37] son the true marriage uh Remember The
[30:41] Man Without the Garment he's cast out
[30:43] where there's weeping and nashing of
[30:45] teeth right that's got to be the
[30:46] tribulation period because he misses the
[30:47] wedding he misses the marriage supper of
[30:49] the Lamb Hallelujah right and then uh
[30:53] the the the the parable of the wise and
[30:55] foolish virgins right the the foolish
[30:58] virgins are are are kept out the door
[31:00] shut and they can't get in right so they
[31:03] can't get into the marriage so what's
[31:04] left for them the tribulation period
[31:08] right so there's five uh five types all
[31:11] right now let me see look at my next one
[31:13] okay that that one let me look at six
[31:16] okay yeah so darl what's that verse
[31:18] could
[31:19] you Genesis 89 now I'm gonna preach a
[31:21] whole sermon on this hopefully by God's
[31:23] grace put that up there hone would you
[31:25] put it up
[31:26] therea I been going kind of fast FAS
[31:28] here I'm just trying to hit the
[31:29] highlights now let me know if you see
[31:31] the Rapture in here but the dove found
[31:33] no rest for the soul of her foot and she
[31:35] returned unto him in into the ark for
[31:37] the waters were on the face of the whole
[31:39] earth then he put forth his hand took
[31:42] her and pulled her in unto him into the
[31:46] ark you see it
[31:48] brother he to he puts out his hand and
[31:51] he snatches her up and the church said
[31:54] remember that whole sermon I preach on
[31:55] herazo anybody remember that coming okay
[31:58] jogging the memory okay he said I'll
[32:00] bring all things to your remembrance
[32:01] harpazo means to snatch out of the way
[32:03] what does what does Noah do and what
[32:05] does the Bible say uh Solon said my love
[32:08] my Dove is my one defiled ah
[32:12] Hallelujah can God show sisters
[32:14] Revelation for sure
[32:16] Hallelujah see he snatches out and
[32:19] brings her into the Tabernacle The
[32:21] Pavilion the place of safety hallelujah
[32:24] oh my it's beautiful praise God so thank
[32:26] you hun for yielding to the Holy Spirit
[32:28] she stepped out so God bless you hone
[32:30] Hallelujah so now that's another one I
[32:31] could put in the book If I ever do a
[32:32] review probably won't but if I ever do a
[32:36] revision reason five Paul and Jesus
[32:39] taught the Rapture was imminent at an
[32:41] unknown day and hour like an approaching
[32:44] Thief while all the other views can be
[32:47] numbered right all the other all the
[32:50] other views if Jesus comes in the middle
[32:52] of tribulation you can count the days
[32:54] he'll be there on that day if he comes
[32:56] at the end you can count the days he'll
[32:58] be on the days he'll be right there on
[32:59] the day right the the pre-tribulation
[33:03] Rapture is the only one that has an
[33:05] imminent or
[33:06] unknown day and hour of the Rapture
[33:10] Hallelujah that's right everything else
[33:12] you can calculate by days right Daniel's
[33:14] got then Daniel's got like 35 days after
[33:16] the three and I'm sorry after the seven
[33:18] years right that's in Daniel chapter 12
[33:21] I mean there's all these numbers of
[33:22] possible times right you would just have
[33:25] to know all you'd have to do is just
[33:27] watch you know I'm talking about foolish
[33:29] virgin foolish virgin we just have to
[33:30] watch on CNN or whatever it is uh when
[33:33] two prophets come out and they start
[33:35] tormenting uh that area they're going to
[33:38] make it not rain right and then they're
[33:40] going to uh turn the water to blood wait
[33:42] till that
[33:43] happens right from that day because
[33:45] remember they have three and a half
[33:46] years right three and a half years then
[33:48] they'll die three days they'll be raised
[33:50] up and raptured that's the middle of the
[33:52] tribulation period but after that then
[33:53] you have the vials and the trumpets and
[33:55] all the last things uh Battle of armagon
[33:57] at there that you have all those things
[33:58] going on and they're all numbered by
[34:00] days because it's part of Daniel's 70
[34:02] weeks Hallelujah but the bride is
[34:05] unknown time he could come at any hour
[34:08] but his wife has made herself ready
[34:10] Hallelujah she's ready any time amen why
[34:13] CU she sealed in the Soul by the Holy
[34:15] Ghost Hallelujah she's sealed into the
[34:17] Rapture
[34:19] Hallelujah that's right that's what the
[34:21] Holy Ghost is for it's sealed until the
[34:23] day of your Redemption it's a seal it's
[34:25] a permanent Mark right it's like a bre
[34:27] on a cattle but it's on the soul
[34:29] Hallelujah that's what the Bible says
[34:31] the seal the brand the
[34:34] imprint it's eternal life Hallelujah now
[34:37] the sixth and final reason the Rapture
[34:39] is the removal of the grace of God for
[34:42] the Gentiles in preparation for the
[34:45] Antichrist public Revelation and God's
[34:48] return to the Jewish people hallelujah
[34:52] so that's the six reasons because it's
[34:54] because this is more dispensational
[34:56] right uh Jesus calls it the times of the
[34:58] Gentiles another word you could call the
[34:59] church ages amen when the church ages
[35:02] run
[35:04] out uh Jesus has to come down and
[35:06] whoever is Holy let him be holy still
[35:08] whoever is righteous let him be
[35:09] righteous still he's only going to
[35:10] Rapture the holy ones hallelujah praise
[35:13] God then whatever you are whether you're
[35:15] filthy or unjust whatever you are he's
[35:17] going to leave them here but he's taking
[35:18] the holy group no matter whatever you
[35:20] were at that moment he's taking the holy
[35:23] group and then he's done with the
[35:24] Gentiles he said he's cutting off the
[35:26] Gentile uh Branch he's grafting in the
[35:29] Holy Branch back into the holy tree
[35:31] Israel back with the Holy Ghost my if
[35:34] they did that with David and Gideon and
[35:35] all these men and Solomon uh and Joshua
[35:38] and Moses if they did that uh with the
[35:40] Old Testament what are they going to do
[35:41] in the New Testament hallelujah amen
[35:44] I'll tell you what they're going to do
[35:45] they're going to get the Holy Ghost
[35:46] Hallelujah then they're going to stand
[35:47] on Mount Zion when Jesus comes back to
[35:50] them Hallelujah and they're going to
[35:51] sing the songs of uh of Heaven
[35:54] Hallelujah that's what they're going to
[35:55] S the song of Moses and the lamb the the
[35:57] Bible says oh my glory all right now now
[36:03] that was a good review there how going
[36:04] do on time okay about 30 minutes left
[36:06] okay I I'm planning to stop at 8 o'cl I
[36:08] told Lydia Mali I'm planning that but I
[36:10] can't I can't I can't promise now let's
[36:13] look at the Rapture 1965 I'm trying to
[36:15] preach this uh
[36:17] through now brother Ram starts off and
[36:20] he he says this great quote now I want
[36:22] you to see here in this sermon brother
[36:25] Ram was at a Full Gospel businessman's
[36:27] fellow ship it wasn't a church building
[36:30] it was a hotel in fact the brothers
[36:34] uh brother Loris has been there he's
[36:36] actually been there um to that that
[36:39] specific place in I think it's Arizona
[36:41] and brother Brooks has been there
[36:42] because he they had Harmony in the
[36:44] desert there they have this uh concert
[36:45] message concert where all the message
[36:46] people sing their song it's been a
[36:48] beautiful concert they've had lots of
[36:49] concerts uh it's still there I think
[36:51] it's the Rada I can't remember which one
[36:52] it is but brother braham's there and and
[36:55] and and he's there preaching to a lot of
[36:57] different
[36:58] denominations and brother R brings up
[37:00] the book I think it's the seven Church
[37:02] age book if I'm not mistaken he says
[37:04] there's too much Supernatural
[37:05] Vindication of God's written word of
[37:07] this hour for something not to be
[37:09] approaching us
[37:11] now it's too real it would be
[37:14] astonishing to you just to let you know
[37:15] what is really taking place many of you
[37:17] strangers perhaps hear these men get up
[37:19] and make these remarks about a message
[37:21] of this hour and so forth what what
[37:24] they're getting at is God's promise for
[37:26] this hour what he promised he would do
[37:29] and we see him scripturally vindicating
[37:31] just exactly what he said he would
[37:35] do he said it's foretold hits just
[37:38] exactly perfectly each time because it's
[37:41] God saying
[37:42] it so brother's in front of a group of a
[37:45] bunch of different denominations
[37:47] businessmen rich men I say middle class
[37:49] men a lot of different men there because
[37:51] they could afford to run out the hotel
[37:52] and have a service and he's he's slowly
[37:56] or he's just given a little little bit
[37:57] about his
[37:58] ministry right he doesn't come out and
[38:00] say I am Malachi 45 and6 he doesn't say
[38:03] that he doesn't say I am Revelation 10:7
[38:06] but he says he says it later Revelation
[38:08] 10 has been fulfilled in our day he said
[38:11] the seals have been opened in our
[38:13] day so he's just laying a little bit
[38:16] he's just putting the just putting the
[38:18] bait on the hook there I I put some
[38:21] worms on a hook this summer trust me it
[38:23] it was
[38:25] hard of course I didn't catch many fish
[38:28] brother just he's just kind of putting
[38:29] the bait out
[38:30] there seeing who's interested seeing who
[38:33] wants to really get into the depths of
[38:35] the word of God but he said these men
[38:37] around me are talking about a message of
[38:38] the hour it's the scriptures that's
[38:40] already foretold glory amen hallelujah
[38:43] that God's vindicating right now
[38:45] Hallelujah Luke 17:30 Malachi 45 and 6
[38:48] right Matthew 17:11 Amos 37 all these
[38:51] verses we know and love uh Revelation
[38:54] 3:14 the seventh Church age messenger he
[38:57] said said they're being fulfilled right
[38:59] now and it's available for those who
[39:01] want to hear it Hallelujah I'm glad
[39:04] brother William I had no chance to hear
[39:07] this unless God brought it to me I was
[39:10] in a Pentecostal church that was not
[39:12] Holiness there was no way I was going to
[39:14] hear brother brandom because I never
[39:16] heard of him when I was growing up I was
[39:19] you know there's no way for me to hear
[39:20] this except God came looking for me he
[39:23] left the 99 to go get the one Hallelujah
[39:26] that's the only way the message came to
[39:28] me Hallelujah is if Christ the shepherd
[39:30] came and found his sheep Hallelujah am
[39:33] there's no way because because I can
[39:36] look at the denomination my mother's in
[39:37] now I can see where it is it's a million
[39:39] miles from brother Brandon a million
[39:42] miles my mom had never heard of brother
[39:44] brandom that tells you enough right
[39:46] there and she was in the Assemblies of
[39:48] God and brother BR said remember this in
[39:49] 64 he said I've sent a million of my
[39:52] children to the Assemblies of God
[39:53] remember that yeah he said why would I
[39:55] say why would I send my uh children to a
[39:58] a a death trap he
[40:00] says because brother Braham knew there's
[40:02] wise and there's
[40:04] foolish Hallelujah and he knew the elect
[40:07] would catch the real baptism of the Holy
[40:09] Ghost and come out of her my people
[40:12] hallelujah hallelujah listen to that he
[40:15] said I sent a million of my souls to the
[40:18] Assemblies of God churches but now the
[40:20] Assembly of God brother Mercy won't even
[40:21] talk about them their own Papa they
[40:24] won't talk about their own
[40:25] Daddy I'm talking about spiritually now
[40:28] Hallelujah call no man father now
[40:30] Church you not don't have many fathers
[40:33] right lots of instructors thousands of
[40:35] instructors not many
[40:39] fathers so here brother Ram is doing a
[40:41] very good uh job of just humbly trying
[40:44] to let the people know about his
[40:46] ministry
[40:48] Hallelujah and again that is my
[40:50] definition somebody asked me go go
[40:51] listen to our first podcast that we did
[40:53] the title is what is the message anyone
[40:55] who asked me what the message is I'm
[40:56] pointing to that
[40:58] quote it's the scriptures God's
[41:01] fulfilling not all the tapes and the
[41:03] church said amen it takes a mature
[41:06] person to understand that Hallelujah it
[41:09] takes a very mature person a humble
[41:10] person to admit that it's the but yes
[41:12] the tapes point us to the Bible they
[41:14] make us go read the Bible we can listen
[41:16] to the sermons something different about
[41:17] that man first time I heard his voice I
[41:19] wept and cried while chewing tobacco and
[41:20] playing video games right Z and I just
[41:22] turn off the I I turn off the video game
[41:24] and just listen to brother
[41:25] Brandon I just I cried I I never heard a
[41:28] man preach like
[41:30] that he
[41:32] says he says if a man I don't care who
[41:35] he is would try to make such a
[41:37] prediction of the scriptures about him
[41:39] he said there's one chance of about 10
[41:41] million that those could come to pass if
[41:44] a man told you a certain thing would
[41:45] happen it would happen a certain time
[41:47] one out of 10 million and then the place
[41:49] where it would happen would be about one
[41:51] chance out about a 100 million and the
[41:54] time it would happen again goes on and
[41:56] on the way it would happen what it will
[41:57] be happening and so forth it's just
[41:58] beyond a guess when we see it so
[42:00] perfectly each time every time then it's
[42:03] God Amen all these people around brother
[42:06] Ram said every time he did discernment
[42:08] he was never
[42:09] wrong now there's a few times on tapes
[42:12] he says like a last name uh he says like
[42:14] the last few letters of a name wrong
[42:16] like stout or strong like he just mixes
[42:18] up but he's coming out of the vision
[42:20] back into the back into the realm right
[42:23] when was the last time any of us tried
[42:25] to see a vision and then read everything
[42:27] in the vision and then say it out in the
[42:28] real real world why should it say real
[42:31] world this is the shadow lands this
[42:34] ain't the real world man said Heaven's
[42:35] way more real than this
[42:37] Hallelujah but see that that's that's
[42:39] just a small mistake he still got all
[42:41] the other discernment
[42:43] right he said it's God saying it like I
[42:47] told you I went through over 1,200 some
[42:50] quotes about thus sayith the Lord every
[42:51] time I heard brother say thus said the
[42:53] lord it's never failed people don't
[42:55] understand it but that's CU they don't
[42:56] want to understand it Hallelujah they
[43:00] don't understand uh humility they don't
[43:02] understand praying about something or
[43:04] waiting on the Lord they don't
[43:06] understand even Isaiah's prophecy is
[43:08] still not fulfilled today Isaiah said
[43:11] death will be swallowed up in Victory
[43:13] Hallelujah that's the one we're waiting
[43:15] for hallelujah it's almost 3,000 years
[43:18] old we're still waiting on it praise God
[43:20] that doesn't mean we throw out Isaiah
[43:22] that means we bring in the Holy Ghost
[43:23] and Give Me Faith to believe it
[43:25] Hallelujah give me patience to wait
[43:27] Hallelujah till it's fulfilled
[43:29] Hallelujah give me
[43:31] patience
[43:33] Hallelujah he says and then we turn
[43:35] right back in the Scriptures it may seem
[43:38] foreign to us but we turn right back in
[43:40] the scriptures without even knowing
[43:42] where to look and the Holy Spirit brings
[43:44] out and just puts the whole word
[43:46] together what's this emphasis whole time
[43:48] the word the scriptures the word
[43:50] vindicating the word scriptures prophecy
[43:52] foretold the word of God
[43:54] hallelujah without even knowing where to
[43:56] look he says it puts the whole word
[43:58] together makes the picture there to show
[44:00] us just the hour that we're living in he
[44:04] says we're changing
[44:06] dispensations Hallelujah of course the
[44:09] Rapture but said we're at a corner it's
[44:11] easy no I'm sorry he says it it's easy
[44:15] uh to build a wall he
[44:17] says he said but a brick mason has to
[44:19] turn a corner when building a
[44:22] wall he says everybody just lays their
[44:24] bricks right down the same row like a
[44:26] certain denom ation start starts rolling
[44:28] down the road it's all right but when
[44:30] you get to them turns where you have to
[44:33] turn back the other way and brother R
[44:35] said God isn't building a
[44:37] wall so God started here I'll just say
[44:40] it like this God started here with
[44:42] Martin Luther he starts building a wall
[44:45] actually set that poting right there
[44:46] that was Martin Luther boom now just
[44:47] imagine him up there bang bang bang dig
[44:50] the hole there's Martin Luther they
[44:51] build this wall a Luther Revival pretty
[44:53] good Revival I'm walk around the church

[44:57] God's going to change a corner what does
[44:59] he send he sends another prophet of God
[45:01] he says he sends John Wesley
[45:03] Hallelujah John Wesley's message is
[45:05] planted on then there and they start
[45:07] building the Bricks now there's not
[45:08] bricks in here right but you just give
[45:10] the picture he's got to turn a corner
[45:13] he's got to turn a corner with a
[45:14] messenger amen someone who's anointed
[45:16] Hal someone who's got the word of God
[45:18] hallelujah and so he builds and they
[45:21] build after uh John Wesley and brother
[45:23] said they got to this corner I can't get
[45:25] back there casea can I but then God laid
[45:27] down a William Seymour hallelujah praise
[45:29] God and then they just after him they
[45:31] just build on build on build on and
[45:32] brother said but now Hallelujah brother
[45:35] but now they get he said we're at a
[45:36] corner we're changing dispensations
[45:38] Hallelujah and he plants in Malachi 45
[45:41] and 6
[45:42] Hallelujah and it changes a corner and
[45:45] now oh it takes a prophet of God to
[45:47] change a corner you can't just go along
[45:49] with isza now you need a prophet of God
[45:51] and church where are we on this wall
[45:53] Hallelujah where are we I hope by God's
[45:56] grace we're close right here
[45:59] hallelujah anybody can put up a straight
[46:01] wall brother said it takes a brick mason
[46:03] it takes a prophet it takes a church age
[46:05] Messenger to turn a corner
[46:08] hallelujah
[46:12] amen he said now God isn't building a
[46:14] wall he's building a house see there's
[46:17] many cuts and turns he's predicted here
[46:19] in the Bible oh I'm glad I know it
[46:21] brother William I'm glad I know about
[46:23] the cuts and the turns he said and the
[46:25] turns anybody could try to make a turn
[46:28] but it must be according to the
[46:30] blueprint if it isn't it's got to be
[46:33] torn down
[46:34] again Hallelujah brother bam said uh
[46:38] that's what it had to be uh there had to
[46:40] be like four little revivals because God
[46:42] is building a building the seed fell
[46:44] into the ground the church looked like
[46:45] it died but God said I'll restore sayith
[46:49] the Lord hallelujah praise God Amen

[47:24] businessman he says and the open doors

[47:29] businessmen he said I praise God for his
[47:31] goodness and the fellowship of your
[47:32] people what do you mean brother Braham
[47:34] you're you're fellowshipping with a
[47:35] bunch of denominational Devils that's

[47:41] last few weeks most people aren't saved
[47:43] in there that's true but there are some
[47:45] good people in there but church can you
[47:47] can can can everybody understand this
[47:48] there was a lot more saved people in the
[47:50] denomination back in
[47:52] 1965 because there's fewer and fewer
[47:54] saved all the time there's more and more
[47:56] deception all the time everybody see
[47:57] that and Jesus said I have to shorten
[47:59] the time just to make sure somebody gets
[48:00] saved
[48:03] hallelujah oh I would have fellowship
[48:05] with them them Devils brother Jesse how
[48:07] would you preach for them Baptists

[51:05] with all this energy tonight Hallelujah
[51:07] because I've heard the word of God Amen
[51:09] that's what it's supposed to do praise
[51:11] God glory to God that's right
[51:15] church he said this open door has been
[51:18] he caused it an oasis what there's water
[51:22] around foolish
[51:24] virgins huh
[51:27] I just preached it not long ago Church
[51:28] everybody forget El
[51:30] Rio somebody found a Oasis Glory I even
[51:34] was expecting that Hagar Hagar a type of
[51:39] the Bond woman she found in Oasis oh my
[51:43] Hallelujah but what did a what did
[51:44] Abraham and Isaac have they actually had
[51:46] whales they dug whales and they dug deep
[51:49] enough to the water sprung up they had
[51:51] artisian whales amen they had lifegiving
[51:54] whales but brother ad even said a Hagar
[51:58] we see it from the Bible even that is an
[52:00] oasis even she had an
[52:02] oasis brother Ram says I have an oasis
[52:04] when I come to these non-
[52:07] denominational Gatherings he said where
[52:10] he said he he'll say it later where
[52:11] there's Methodist there's Presbyterian
[52:13] there's Baptist he said it's a little
[52:15] Oasis for
[52:20] me he says I believe now listen this is
[52:22] in 1965 three weeks before he died I
[52:25] believe in in the people in
[52:29] denominations what what what
[52:32] brother but I don't have much time to
[52:35] exhort denominations because each one
[52:37] builds a fence around
[52:39] himself so brother Brandon what' he do
[52:42] he didn't look at the fence he looked at
[52:44] the people behind the
[52:45] fence amen hallelujah that's right
[52:49] that's how we have to see it they're
[52:50] fenced in have compassion try to have
[52:53] Fellowship try to show some love
[52:56] that's how brother brandom saw these
[52:58] denominational
[53:00] Gatherings brother Jesse what are you
[53:02] doing preaching denomination I'm trying
[53:04] to get the brother M says the Ducks over
[53:07] the fence I'm trying to get them the D
[53:08] I'll read the story so you know what I'm
[53:10] talking
[53:11] about he said just like Brother David
[53:14] was telling me a little saying about he
[53:15] was Raising some ducks and he said the
[53:17] river come up and each duck you know
[53:19] they wanted fellowship with one another
[53:21] and they couldn't do it because they was
[53:22] all fenced up but when the water got so
[53:26] high just floated the Ducks out of the
[53:28] pen so I think that's the way to do it
[53:32] is just the waters coming up see and we
[53:35] can get out of the pen and fellowship
[53:37] with one another you know have the Real
[53:39] Love Of Christ in our
[53:41] hearts and the church said Hallelujah
[53:44] that's what we need brother Mercy some
[53:45] flood in here some floods of the Waters
[53:47] of the Holy Ghost
[53:49] amen they give us some love for people
[53:52] that some ducks that are stuck in their
[53:54] fences God give us a spirit spiritual
[53:57] flood Hallelujah where it moves people
[54:00] out of their denominations right or
[54:03] offence walls uh brother Ram said even
[54:05] in a church you can have uh divisions in
[54:07] a church where some people won't
[54:09] fellowship with some other people even
[54:10] in our church or other churches right
[54:14] there's my it's almost 8 o00 okay
[54:15] there's my little warning
[54:17] B uh what's it called brother calls them
[54:20] clicks you can have Clicks in churches
[54:22] right where some people won't talk to
[54:24] other people things like that what we
[54:26] needed some water Hallelujah that's what
[54:27] we need amen he says the real love of
[54:30] Jesus Christ hallelujah oh I love it
[54:33] amen I'm almost
[54:36] done and this Full Gospel businessman
[54:39] has been an oasis for me because I have
[54:42] I have Fine Brothers I guess in every
[54:44] denomination I've ever met he didn't say
[54:47] find demons he said find
[54:50] brothers and look here's the list
[54:53] Presbyterians Lutheran christen's
[54:55] grandmother the pastor way we had good
[54:57] Fellowship didn't we
[54:59] hun I called her I called her Grandpa
[55:01] this week we talked we had good
[55:02] Fellowship about the Lord hallelujah he
[55:05] still he still says this but we were so
[55:06] richly blessed that's his that's his uh
[55:09] three favorite words so richly blessed
[55:11] would you say Amen to that brother
[55:14] Hallelujah Baptist Pentecostals all
[55:17] different types of the Pentecostals
[55:19] right because you got different versions
[55:20] different flavors of Pentecost Church of
[55:22] God Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness fine
[55:25] Brethren everywhere
[55:27] but many times they cannot have me in
[55:29] their Community because not that they
[55:32] don't believe it but see it would cut
[55:34] them off from their denomination when
[55:35] you do that course then that does
[55:39] it Hallelujah ever had that moment where
[55:42] you you you maybe you somebody sees you
[55:44] do something they don't like well that
[55:45] does it no more fellowship with you now
[55:48] there are certain things we need to
[55:49] disfellowship over I preached remember
[55:50] we preached on doctrines of devils two
[55:52] years ago there are certain things you
[55:53] cannot Fellowship on right people even
[55:55] people in ual sin don't even eat with
[55:58] them there's certain things uh the Bible
[56:01] said if someone tries to come into your
[56:02] house remember in uh first or second
[56:03] John and doesn't preach the true
[56:05] Doctrine he said don't even let him in
[56:07] your house and don't B him God speed
[56:08] don't say God bless
[56:09] you Hallelujah there's certain things
[56:13] that we need the wisdom of God on but
[56:14] I'm just talking about just people that
[56:16] love the Lord maybe they're ignorant
[56:17] they don't understand the message think
[56:19] about what you were like when you were
[56:20] in
[56:22] denominations
[56:25] Hallelujah I reach out to a brother this
[56:27] week uh I don't know if you saw that
[56:28] video I made about Kenneth Hagen um
[56:31] anyways it was a couple months ago but I
[56:34] reached out to a brother he was in his
[56:35] he foued his ministry for 20
[56:38] years and I said brother can you tell me
[56:40] did they have women preachers in there
[56:42] did they just speak in uncontrollable
[56:45] tongues all the time without
[56:46] interpretations did they have laughing
[56:48] fits have you ever seen those laughing
[56:49] fits everybody's rolling on there I mean
[56:53] they're just going crazy laughing I said
[56:55] do they preached the uh pres uh
[56:59] Prosperity Gospel
[57:00] sorry I mean I listen to all these
[57:02] things and I was you I was I was really
[57:04] kind of zealous you know I wanted to
[57:06] show how Kenneth Hagen was just a false
[57:08] teacher and he was church but he
[57:10] responded back and he said brother God
[57:12] was so gracious to me I did all those
[57:15] things that I didn't know better and the
[57:17] reason I did it because I I never heard
[57:19] brother brother man's message he said so
[57:21] I have a lot of compassion on them and
[57:24] he said and yes they did all that but a
[57:27] lot of them don't know
[57:28] better I tell you I got real humbled
[57:30] after that I lost all my Zeal my my my
[57:33] balloon
[57:35] deflated all my all my effort you know I
[57:37] was gon to make another video on Kenneth
[57:38] Hagen all I was like oh that's a good
[57:41] way remember where you come from brother
[57:43] Jesse Hallelujah you were just a sitting
[57:47] in a Pentecostal Church too you were
[57:48] sitting over there in the chapel and God
[57:50] had mercy on you amen hallelujah God
[57:53] didn't judge you and throw you in with a
[57:55] bunch of the devil God didn't judge you
[57:57] like that he had mercy he had
[57:59] longsuffering and he had a perfect time
[58:01] to call you out of Darkness Into The
[58:04] Marvelous Light

[58:29] some earplugs though some of those
[58:29] churches are loud tell brother he
[58:31] brother amen and I and I can say Amen to
[58:33] that I think I I think our ears were
[58:35] ringing when we come out of that service
[58:36] there like can you turn down the volume
[58:38] a little bit I can't even think about
[58:41] God because I got a
[58:42] headache but they like it
[58:45] loud he said find Brethren
[58:50] everywhere he said but a Methodist
[58:52] brother I won't call his name a fine man
[58:55] he come up and wrote me letter he said
[58:56] he's writing a letter on Divine Healing
[58:58] and he come up to me and talked about I
[58:59] said the only thing we got against you
[59:00] brother Braham you're hanging around
[59:02] them Pentecostals all the
[59:04] time I said well then let the Methodist
[59:07] Church sponsor it I'll

[59:12] with him that's fine well open your
[59:14] doors

[59:19] God opens for me and the church
[59:23] said he said oh that was different he
[59:25] said yeah well of course um uh he said
[59:28] I'm not the Methodist Church I just
[59:30] belong with
[59:33] them I said see that's it see they're
[59:37] the ones the Pentecostals is the ones
[59:39] that open their doors see that's the
[59:41] reason I can get to as many as them that
[59:44] will open why we're ready to come
[59:47] in any door got open now C corers listen
[59:51] you got to pray before you go in the
[59:52] door you better pray before you go in

[59:59] no doubt there was immoral women and uh
[1:00:02] uh you know Leo Deans to see lazy boys
[1:00:05] and all these things he said but there's
[1:00:06] if there's a door open and God sends me
[1:00:08] in there there's got to be some seed in
[1:00:10] there as well Hallelujah you you'd be
[1:00:14] surprised how many message churches
[1:00:15] today are there because their original
[1:00:17] fign founding Pastor was in brother
[1:00:19] bram's meetings or just got a tape or
[1:00:22] just had the voice of healing magazine
[1:00:23] and something drew them to brother
[1:00:25] Brandon something drew them to his
[1:00:26] meetings and forever changed not even
[1:00:29] trying Hallelujah not even trying really
[1:00:31] to to to seek after that but just led by
[1:00:34] the Holy Spirit you're magnetized you're
[1:00:36] just drawn because it's God drawing you
[1:00:38] to the truth
[1:00:41] hallelujah you can't get away from it
[1:00:43] because it's
[1:00:45] God you'd be surprised Church how many
[1:00:48] people just were drawn to this message
[1:00:50] that's what I was I was just drawn to it
[1:00:54] Hallelujah as many as opened the door
[1:00:57] were ready to come in he said just like
[1:01:00] Revelation I love how brother always
[1:01:01] takes it back to the Bible he said the
[1:01:03] third chapter I stand at the door and
[1:01:05] knock If any man will open the door I'll
[1:01:08] come in and sub that was Jesus and all
[1:01:11] of us knows that was Christ and he is
[1:01:13] the
[1:01:14] word that's right he is the
[1:01:18] word I'm almost done I got three minutes
[1:01:21] left clock is
[1:01:23] ticking and so he says it again for for
[1:01:25] a second time and so the Full Gospel
[1:01:28] businessman has been an oasis for me I
[1:01:30] hope tonight has been an oasis for
[1:01:32] somebody you've had a rough Monday
[1:01:34] Tuesday maybe Wednesday is rough but you
[1:01:36] come to God's house and you feel
[1:01:37] refreshed in the house of the Lord
[1:01:39] singing saying Amen to the word sick in
[1:01:41] the devil Hallelujah putting the devil
[1:01:43] up in a
[1:01:44] tree right like that putting a
[1:01:46] in the tree treeing him trapping him
[1:01:51] Hallelujah he says it's a Oasis where we
[1:01:54] can all come together together no
[1:01:56] churches is sponsoring it they all
[1:01:59] together the men out of the churches we
[1:02:01] come together in Fellowship cross the
[1:02:03] world around
[1:02:05] everywhere now look what he says and
[1:02:08] I've helped establish many many many
[1:02:12] chapters and I'm quoting quote by quote
[1:02:14] I'm not adding any many's there I've
[1:02:16] helped establish many many many chapters
[1:02:20] throughout the entire world of the Full
[1:02:22] Gospel
[1:02:24] businessmen brother said that
[1:02:26] organizations brother Braham started
[1:02:28] many many many non- denominational
[1:02:33] organizations
[1:02:34] Hallelujah was he against organization
[1:02:37] yes if it was of the devil but was he
[1:02:39] for it if it was non- denominational yes
[1:02:42] that's why brother BR would be for our
[1:02:43] church right because we're not a
[1:02:45] denomination
[1:02:47] Hallelujah that's right that's why
[1:02:49] anything you do for god brother R even
[1:02:50] complimented uh uh what's that one uh
[1:02:54] where you support the or orphans
[1:02:56] orphanages yeah brother B even comped a
[1:02:58] man who would uh who would start
[1:03:00] orphanages and said what a great work he
[1:03:01] was doing he started an organization and
[1:03:03] get he get chartered in and or organized
[1:03:05] with the government to be recognized as
[1:03:07] a 503 and taxfree brother said what a
[1:03:11] great work the brothers doing I'll try
[1:03:12] I'll try to find the quote maybe bring
[1:03:14] it Sunday see anybody that was trying to
[1:03:17] do something to win souls brother
[1:03:19] brandham was for it but he was trying to
[1:03:21] get them out of
[1:03:22] denominations right and try to get them
[1:03:25] into the TRU truth of God's word amen
[1:03:28] hallelujah this is again three weeks
[1:03:31] well I actually count the days uh he
[1:03:33] died on uh this is 20 days before he
[1:03:35] died because he died uh Christmas Eve
[1:03:38] 1965 this was December 4th 20 days
[1:03:41] before he died three weeks he's still
[1:03:43] talking about just just get people saved
[1:03:45] just get them
[1:03:48] saved he says and I'm thankful for that
[1:03:52] opportunity that was given me
[1:03:56] you're the prophet of
[1:03:58] God what other jobs do you have well one
[1:04:01] of them is start many many Full Gospel
[1:04:05] fellowships start many many fellowships
[1:04:07] where there's no Creed but
[1:04:09] Christ no book but the Bible Hallelujah
[1:04:13] what's the other one no no no law of
[1:04:15] love thank you sir forgot one thing I
[1:04:18] forget many things no law but love
[1:04:21] Hallelujah I'm thankful right before the
[1:04:24] Lord takes me off the scene I was was
[1:04:25] able to start many non- denominational
[1:04:29] fellowships h a lot different than what
[1:04:31] we hear today from message people right
[1:04:35] I'm thankful in there the businessmen
[1:04:38] will sponsor it so see they've got the
[1:04:39] money they got businesses all the
[1:04:41] churches they want to come anyhow so see
[1:04:45] he knows there's all these
[1:04:46] denominational people their
[1:04:48] denominations won't invite the message
[1:04:49] in so you got to start something to
[1:04:52] invite the denominations in
[1:04:56] you that's what brother R had a strategy
[1:04:58] and because of that because of his name
[1:05:00] because of his reputation because of the
[1:05:01] people saw the gift in his life he could
[1:05:03] start many many chapters where people
[1:05:05] could come in and hear the word of God
[1:05:08] hallelujah and brother B said in these
[1:05:10] he didn't preach the Deep things of God
[1:05:12] remember he shared that for or I'm sorry
[1:05:14] he saved that for his home Church
[1:05:15] remember
[1:05:18] that he even made a promise he said as I
[1:05:21] travel so much I won't preach any major
[1:05:23] Doctrine unless I first preach it at BR
[1:05:25] t
[1:05:26] but then when Perry green raised up the
[1:05:27] church he said now this is my church he
[1:05:29] said now I don't have to go across the
[1:05:31] country now why isn't Joseph saying Amen
[1:05:32] to that one
[1:05:35] right that's right he said I don't have
[1:05:37] to go back to Jeffersonville because
[1:05:38] this is my church now as it was going to
[1:05:41] be his home church he said it's his home
[1:05:42] Church there in twon Tabernacle in
[1:05:44] Arizona that was uh more a little that
[1:05:47] was in November of
[1:05:48] 65
[1:05:50] Hallelujah so see wherever his home
[1:05:52] Church would be and the the Pastor
[1:05:54] believed in the message of the hour he
[1:05:56] could preach anything from there he
[1:05:57] could teach the Deep things of God
[1:05:59] church people don't have to receive
[1:06:01] serpent seed to be saved how many
[1:06:02] remember the quote brother Bram said
[1:06:04] that's the killer you want to kill some
[1:06:06] friendship should show them serpent seed
[1:06:09] well I've had trouble with that person
[1:06:10] anyway let me just show them serpent
[1:06:11] seed then they'll leave for sure right
[1:06:12] no I'm just kidding but that's the
[1:06:15] killer brother Braham said see it
[1:06:16] doesn't pertain to Salvation he said it
[1:06:19] just shows more light on the truth that
[1:06:21] we're all trying to see
[1:06:23] hallelujah we're all trying to see the
[1:06:25] truth of God
[1:06:27] I love I love how brother says it oh
[1:06:32] my last quote I'm past 8 o'clock I said
[1:06:36] I'd stop around
[1:06:38] 8 that's Co he says this he
[1:06:41] says but then I don't want to never try
[1:06:44] to pull somebody from their church I've
[1:06:48] never tried to pull anybody this church
[1:06:50] you they want to go somewhere else let
[1:06:52] them go I want God to pull people here
[1:06:55] Hallelujah because it's God that pulled
[1:06:57] me here I didn't I didn't come to akaran
[1:06:59] looking to be a pastor I came here to
[1:07:01] try to go to the NFL and build my mama
[1:07:02] house well that surely
[1:07:05] failed but at least I tried at least I
[1:07:07] gave my best shot I can at least say I
[1:07:10] tried I gave my best shot
[1:07:13] Hallelujah he says don't I never want to
[1:07:16] try to pull somebody from their church
[1:07:18] just stay right in your
[1:07:21] church he tells him stay in those fences
[1:07:23] look what he's saying he's saying stay
[1:07:24] in those fences
