[46:54] on prayer by the grace of Lord so we'll
[46:56] have we'll have the series on wisdom and
[47:00] then we'll have a little series on
[47:02] prayer I've been feeling lead like I
[47:05] think I told you in December I like to

[47:09] waiting for the right time and I just
[47:12] feel like now would be a good time by
[47:13] the grace of Lord first Timothy chapter
[47:17] 2 verse 1 so about a title tonight I'd
[47:27] like to just call the realities of
[47:28] prayer
[47:29] first Timothy 2 chapter 1 a kind of me a
[47:32] little review I'm gonna reviews a lot of
[47:34] scriptures and I found some really nice
[47:36] new scriptures on prayers well I think
[47:38] there'll be a blessing to you first
[47:41] Timothy chapter 2 verse 1
[47:47] or he'd versus 1 to 4 by God's grace
[47:59] from this text I just want you to see
[48:01] that Paul encourages Timothy to pray for
[48:04] every man of course every man and woman
[48:07] you know sometimes we wonder well do
[48:09] after I got to pray for somebody else
[48:11] and sometimes we just get overwhelmed
[48:13] but God does want us to do that God
[48:15] wants us to pray for every man and woman
[48:17] that we possibly can pray for that shows
[48:20] that there's power in prayer so let's
[48:23] read verses 1 to 4 let's all read verse
[48:27] 1 together and then I'll read 2 3 and 4
[48:30] speaking on three one two three I exhort

[50:50] that's gonna be my picture there for the
[50:52] online I like that always like that
[50:54] picture of Jesus we have to look at the
[50:56] realities of prayer we read our text and
[50:59] then I just have a few updates about the
[51:01] church website just I just update a
[51:03] little bit this week and then by God's
[51:05] grace I got done three new videos for
[51:07] the website this week and also update
[51:11] you on the modesty book and then the
[51:12] post card outreach I just started that
[51:14] today by the grace of Lord but let me
[51:17] just show you the church website real
[51:19] quick we updated that a little bit so if
[51:23] you go to our website the first thing is
[51:25] our new videos of the high heels it's
[51:27] already got almost 500 views in just in
[51:29] a couple days but we have our
[51:32] announcements down there the guest
[51:33] ministers and everything coming up if
[51:36] you go to videos if you go to videos
[51:41] you'll see a picture of all the updated
[51:44] videos and they go right they go right
[51:46] to the YouTube except unless there's a
[51:49] series like The Book of Revelations so
[51:51] now we have the overview chapter 1
[51:53] chapters 2 & 3 4 5 6 this week I there's
[51:56] a little space that I tried to fix that
[51:58] I couldn't fix it but anyways we
[51:59] finished 8 & 9 this week so we're up to
[52:02] chapter 8 9 for the the book of
[52:05] Revelation if you're if you're need of
[52:08] any teaching there by the grace of Lord
[52:09] so that's the website there oh and the
[52:13] three new videos
[52:15] those top three are the three new ones
[52:17] chapter 9 chapter 8 and then high heels
[52:19] in the Bible
[52:19] I had a few requests for high heels so
[52:21] that's why I made the video it's just a
[52:23] real short one it's only like six
[52:24] minutes long if but he's interested in
[52:26] that one is anyways oh in the modesty
[52:32] book I've kind of taken a break on that
[52:34] my wife and I were editing it but then
[52:36] the children got sick so it's just gonna
[52:37] be a slow process so I thought it'd be
[52:39] really fast but I guess editing takes a
[52:41] long time you know that shows how much I
[52:43] know about publishing
[52:44] you know many ways we're not even
[52:46] through chapter one yet but we did the
[52:47] introduction since the kids got sick and
[52:49] my wife had some work she had to do for
[52:51] her her website
[52:52] so anyways it just be a slow process but
[52:55] we're still going to try to do that and
[52:56] today I signed a little contract to do
[52:58] some postcard outreach we're gonna try
[53:00] to send 2,500 postcards to the Akron
[53:03] area so if you just think of that pray
[53:05] about neighborhoods or postal codes you
[53:09] want to send them to like I know a
[53:11] couple I want to send some of the
[53:12] Highlands Square up there in Akron
[53:14] there's a large population of
[53:15] homosexuals up there I like to send
[53:17] postcards to that area so if you know of
[53:21] any little pockets that you want to send
[53:23] we can we can send 500 to different
[53:25] pockets you know so they can divide up
[53:26] into five different groups so if you
[53:28] feel led you know maybe I don't know
[53:30] west Acker and east akron edith you know
[53:34] any pocket so we're gonna I'm gonna
[53:35] invest some missionary money into that
[53:37] and try to do a postcard outreach there
[53:40] and see if it'll draw any Saints you
[53:43] know I remember brother Branham said
[53:45] brother Graham said the responsibility
[53:46] this community is on our shoulders I
[53:48] don't know if you feel you feel that you
[53:49] feel that when you come to church
[53:50] sometimes you you feel that
[53:52] responsibility huh we just we need to
[53:54] try to get more people in Akron to come
[53:55] to Christ you know we got we got to do
[53:58] something with that responsibility and
[54:00] then brother Branham said in Beaumont
[54:02] Texas when Perry green and brothers were
[54:04] they were paying for hotels for people
[54:06] to come here brother Branham preached
[54:07] they were putting advertisements on the
[54:09] radio and the TV and brother branham
[54:11] said those people of whom the world was
[54:14] not worthy so and when we give of our
[54:16] own money you know we give our ties or
[54:18] offerings when we give our own money to
[54:21] try to get people to come in and hear
[54:22] the preaching the Bible said of whom the
[54:24] world is not worthy of us so if we can
[54:27] if we can do that with sincere
[54:29] it makes us real Christians by God's
[54:32] grace that's we want to be real
[54:33] Christians we want to be inviting them
[54:35] to hear the word if they can go to the
[54:38] website and whatever it would be
[54:40] whatever them whatever we have to do to
[54:42] try to get sole say we'd be happy to do
[54:44] that so just before we start this series
[54:48] I've been drawing inspiration from books
[54:50] on prayer by e/m bounds he was a
[54:53] preacher and he lived in the 1800s
[54:56] you know and he's a preacher an attorney
[54:59] and his books are free on e sword and
[55:01] eagle e swords free as well if you don't
[55:03] know that but I was at the Christian
[55:05] bookstore on Saturday night and they had
[55:07] some of his books they were like you
[55:08] know $18 a piece but they're free
[55:10] they're free honey sword if you download
[55:12] download sword on it could be on the
[55:15] iPad and so I just read them on my iPad
[55:17] I read the chapters there so they're
[55:18] really nice chapters on prayer so let me
[55:21] just set a timer here I'm gonna try to
[55:22] keep I don't want to go too late here
[55:24] tonight so let me just try to maybe
[55:26] preach 45 minutes or something like that
[55:28] I'll try to be mindful of the time so I
[55:32] want to just look at the realities of
[55:33] prayer some of these are going to be
[55:34] reviewed to us but then I've had some
[55:39] new scriptures here I've never really
[55:40] preached before on prayer and so like to
[55:43] preach them by the grace of the Lord let
[55:46] me turn to one I was just thinking of
[55:48] here now the first thing I want to just
[55:52] say is the reality of God God was
[55:56] seeking us first and then after he
[55:59] sought us out then he's calling us to
[56:02] seek Him so and I think you know I think
[56:06] if you look at this scripture here this
[56:08] will kind of help you understand what
[56:09] I'm talking about the Bible said there's
[56:12] none that understandeth there's none
[56:16] that seeketh after God and of course
[56:18] this is in the book of Romans chapter 3
[56:21] especially where where Paul is you know
[56:23] giving the Romans Road in other words
[56:24] he's showing how both Jew and Gentile no
[56:27] man was worthy of salvation so God by
[56:30] His grace and His Son Jesus Christ to
[56:32] justify us through his blood and then he
[56:36] brings salvation so this is true that
[56:39] none of us seek God
[56:42] before we're saved none of us were
[56:44] seeking God huh me know that God was
[56:47] coming to seek after you praise the Lord
[56:49] amen and I want to balance this out
[56:53] because I want to I want to show the
[56:57] balance of the scripture before you're
[56:59] saved you and I were not seeking God but
[57:02] after we get saved Church then we have a
[57:05] responsibility to seek God how do we
[57:07] know that after God once calls you and
[57:12] you hear God call your voice you realize
[57:16] oh I was never seeking God God was
[57:18] seeking me but then at that point now
[57:20] you haven't you and I now all sinners
[57:22] and everybody everybody that he calls
[57:24] now everybody has a responsibility to
[57:27] seek God you have to see God after he's
[57:30] once called you and so that's what I
[57:33] want you to understand with this
[57:34] scripture this scripture shows that you
[57:36] know not all of us were wandering as
[57:37] scattered as sheep you know of course we
[57:39] know there's goats - that aren't say but
[57:41] the those of us who were saved we were
[57:43] sheep just scattered but the Shepherd
[57:46] came and called us and called us unto
[57:50] himself
[57:51] we were not seeking God God was seeking
[57:53] us Jesus says it quite plainly you are
[57:56] my friends if you do what s whatsoever I
[57:59] command you
[57:59] henceforth I call you not servants for
[58:02] the servant knoweth not what his Lord
[58:03] doeth but I have called you friends for
[58:07] all things that I have heard of my
[58:10] father I made known unto you now notice
[58:13] this Jesus gave conditions
[58:16] he said if you keep my commands than
[58:19] you're my friends but then Jesus says
[58:21] you are my friends because they kept his
[58:23] commands right and notice Jesus so Jesus
[58:27] for knew them as friends of God he knew
[58:30] the eleven would keep the commandments
[58:33] remember and John 15
[58:35] Judas wasn't there at that time Judas
[58:38] was not a friend of God how many know
[58:39] that he was a thief right he was not a
[58:42] friend of God he stole from God he
[58:45] betrayed God so this is saying Jesus
[58:48] saying that there's conditions you're my
[58:50] friends if you keep the word but Judas
[58:52] didn't keep the word but the eleven
[58:55] the word he said I'm gonna let you know
[58:57] you're my friends and you're the ones I
[58:59] would let you know what I'm doing
[59:00] praise the Lord and then write to this
[59:03] he says see you've not chosen me but I
[59:06] have chosen you and ordained you aren't
[59:09] you glad God chose you I did I wasn't
[59:13] going looking for God God came looking
[59:15] for me right I wasn't seeking God
[59:18] there's no man that sought God at the
[59:20] beginning God is the one who's drawing
[59:23] us us unto himself and he said he told
[59:27] the disciples that you would go forth
[59:29] and bear fruit and your fruit should
[59:32] remain and that whatsoever you ask the
[59:34] Father my name he may give it to you and
[59:36] then I you know of course we pulled out
[59:38] of fusions one Ford it's very familiar
[59:39] but powerful Scripture according as he
[59:42] hath chosen us in him before the
[59:44] foundation of the world so you could say
[59:47] you know he could you know the devil
[59:48] could say Oh see he's just talking to
[59:49] the disciples here but Paul says to all
[59:52] the saints he's chosen all of us amen
[59:55] all of us that includes me praise the
[59:58] Lord all the saints us hallelujah now
[1:00:07] here's the example we're really familiar
[1:00:09] with where after God calls you now that
[1:00:13] he's called you now you've got the you
[1:00:15] and I have got to start seeking God back
[1:00:17] and if we don't then there's
[1:00:19] repercussions for that this is the
[1:00:22] reality of Prayer the reality is is that
[1:00:25] we never saw God to begin with but after
[1:00:27] God seeks us and finds us then we have
[1:00:31] the responsibility to see God then we
[1:00:34] have to make that decision with our free
[1:00:35] will remember God was saying thus saith
[1:00:38] the Lord after seventy years be
[1:00:40] accomplished at Babylon I will visit you
[1:00:42] and perform my good word toward you in
[1:00:44] causing you to return to this place for
[1:00:48] I know the thoughts that I think toward
[1:00:49] you say at the Lord thoughts of peace
[1:00:50] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:00:53] end then you shall call upon me and ye
[1:00:57] shall go and pray unto me and I will
[1:01:00] hearken unto you remember see they were
[1:01:03] out of the promised land they were in a
[1:01:05] Babylon they were in Satan's Babylon
[1:01:08] and I say like that you and I aren't
[1:01:11] Satan's Eden right they were out of the
[1:01:14] promised land but God said I'm gonna I'm
[1:01:17] gonna visit you after 70 years and
[1:01:19] you're gonna come out and you're gonna
[1:01:21] pray to me and the Bible said ye shall
[1:01:25] seek me and find me when you search for
[1:01:27] me with all your heart
[1:01:29] see after God's called you after you
[1:01:31] first been called unto God now God's
[1:01:34] after that yes you didn't see God but
[1:01:37] after that now God something you know
[1:01:39] now you've got to seek Him you've got to
[1:01:42] make a freewill choice are you gonna
[1:01:45] continue to seek Him or not and God said
[1:01:50] if you seek me with all you have you'll
[1:01:52] find me say at the Lord I'll turn away
[1:01:55] your captivity I will gather you from
[1:01:56] all nations and from the palace the
[1:01:58] places whither I've driven you saith the
[1:02:00] Lord and I'll bring you again in the
[1:02:01] place whence I carry it caused you to be
[1:02:03] carried away captive now we see the same
[1:02:06] thing in proverbs chapter 1 so let's go
[1:02:08] to back to proverbs chapter 1 I don't
[1:02:14] have a slide for this because I just
[1:02:16] thought of it as I was preparing to
[1:02:17] preach here kind of in prayer I just
[1:02:20] reminded me of this proverbs 1 verse 20
[1:02:25] the Bible says this wisdom crying
[1:02:28] without she utters her voice in the
[1:02:31] streets she cries in the chief place of
[1:02:34] concourse and the openings of the gates
[1:02:35] in the city she uttered her words saying
[1:02:37] how long these simple ones will you love
[1:02:39] simplicity and thus corners the light
[1:02:41] and their scorning and fools hate
[1:02:43] knowledge turn you at my reproof behold
[1:02:46] I'll pour out my spirit unto you I'll
[1:02:48] make no my words unto you now look at
[1:02:51] this verse 24 because I have called and
[1:02:54] ye have refused I have stretched out my
[1:02:58] hand and no man regarded but you have
[1:03:02] said it not all my counsel and would
[1:03:04] none of my reproof
[1:03:05] look at verse this gets pretty serious
[1:03:07] look at verse 26 I will also laugh at
[1:03:10] your calamity wisdom is gonna laugh at
[1:03:13] those who turn down wisdom if they turn
[1:03:17] it down and forsake God so long God's
[1:03:20] gonna laugh at them that's what the
[1:03:21] scripture says I
[1:03:22] that's that's hard for us to imagine
[1:03:24] verse 27 when your fear cometh as theirs
[1:03:27] as desolation and your destruction
[1:03:29] cometh as a whirlwind when distress and
[1:03:32] anguish cometh upon you then shall they
[1:03:34] call upon me but I will not answer you
[1:03:37] see that first call after you get that
[1:03:40] first call that's when you realize oh I
[1:03:42] never saw God but after that God wants
[1:03:45] you to seek Him but if they don't then
[1:03:48] God will let them choose their own path
[1:03:50] and then when the judgment comes after
[1:03:52] they've already crossed the line between
[1:03:54] judgment mercy then when they call God's
[1:03:57] not going to hear their prayer because
[1:03:59] they have a responsibility after you've
[1:04:01] once heard the call of God it's your
[1:04:04] responsibility the reality of it is God
[1:04:06] called you first now God after he calls
[1:04:09] you now he wants you to call on him
[1:04:10] that's right
[1:04:13] that's strike you look at verse 29 for
[1:04:15] they that hated knowledge and did not
[1:04:17] choose the fear of the Lord they would
[1:04:18] none of my reproof
[1:04:20] I'm sorry none of my counsel they
[1:04:21] despise all my reproof therefore shall
[1:04:23] they eat of the fruit of their own way
[1:04:25] and be filled with their own devices
[1:04:27] they're going to reap what they sowed
[1:04:28] for the turning away of the simple shall
[1:04:31] slay them and the prosperity of fools
[1:04:33] shall destroy them but whoso hearken
[1:04:35] unto me shall dwell safely and shall be
[1:04:37] quiet from the fear of evil amen what a
[1:04:41] promise praise the Lord so I want you to
[1:04:44] see that there that's the reality as we
[1:04:46] said that none of us seek God at first
[1:04:49] but afterwards the reality of it is we
[1:04:52] must choose to seek God we must crucify
[1:04:55] this flesh amen
[1:04:57] now there's the reality of God's desire
[1:05:02] for us to seek Him first so not only do
[1:05:04] we have to now start seeking Him but he
[1:05:07] wants us to seek him first
[1:05:09] now we know this Jesus said don't don't
[1:05:12] take thought saying what are we gonna
[1:05:13] eat what are we gonna drink what are we
[1:05:15] gonna wear what clothes we gonna put on
[1:05:17] he said don't worry about that
[1:05:18] for all these things the Gentiles seek
[1:05:21] for your heavenly Father knoweth the ye
[1:05:23] have need of all these things but seek
[1:05:26] ye first the kingdom of God and His
[1:05:30] righteousness and all these things shall
[1:05:33] be added unto you how many can say Amen
[1:05:34] that you've experienced that in your
[1:05:36] life
[1:05:36] take that thought therefore no thought
[1:05:39] for tomorrow but worry about tomorrow
[1:05:41] for the morrow shall take thought for
[1:05:43] the things of itself sufficient unto the
[1:05:46] day is the evil thereof so god the
[1:05:49] reality of it is God wants to seek Him
[1:05:51] first and not worry about tomorrow just
[1:05:54] seek Him today and here's what we said
[1:05:57] this this was our text I exhort
[1:06:00] therefore first of all the very first
[1:06:02] exact sortation Paul is going to give to
[1:06:05] Timothy in this letter is that
[1:06:07] supplications which are individual a
[1:06:09] strong request those are individual
[1:06:12] strong requests that you make unto God
[1:06:14] like Daniel made supplication for his
[1:06:16] people Israel supplications prayers
[1:06:20] intercessions which is for other
[1:06:22] individuals and giving of thanks be made
[1:06:25] for all men and women for kings for all
[1:06:28] that in authority now we read that for
[1:06:30] our text notice the connection between
[1:06:32] prayer and the salvation of souls we
[1:06:35] have to pray for all that all might have
[1:06:38] a chance to receive the Word of God and
[1:06:40] remember Genesis 18 where Abraham goes
[1:06:43] before the Lord and he intercedes and he
[1:06:46] says Lord if there be fifty and Sodom
[1:06:48] will you spare and the Lord says yes
[1:06:50] forty yes thirty yes he said I'll spare
[1:06:53] it for ten so he was praying for all men
[1:06:56] he was praying for everyone in Sodom can
[1:06:59] you say amen to that
[1:07:00] he was praying for all men the
[1:07:02] homosexuals he was saying God please
[1:07:04] don't destroy the righteous with the
[1:07:06] wicked he's praying for the righteous to
[1:07:10] be saved and that some of them would
[1:07:12] come out and be saving and Paul gives us
[1:07:14] that same idea we need to pray for those
[1:07:17] in leadership in our government you know
[1:07:18] we need to pray for them we need to pray
[1:07:20] for all men the Bible says that's the
[1:07:25] reality of our responsibility of Prayer
[1:07:27] and we must remember the reality that
[1:07:30] God invited us to pray to him let's
[1:07:36] remember that reality jesus said come
[1:07:38] unto me all ye that labor and are heavy
[1:07:41] laden I'll give you rest take my yoke
[1:07:43] upon you and learn of me for I am meek
[1:07:46] and lowly in heart and you shall find
[1:07:47] rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy
[1:07:50] easy and my burden is light amen if we
[1:07:55] feel like the weight of the world is too
[1:07:57] heavy we got to come closer to Jesus
[1:07:59] because jesus promised his burden is
[1:08:03] light we just got to come that's that's
[1:08:08] that's the only thing we're invited come
[1:08:11] and not only that but now the Holy
[1:08:13] Spirit you say well that was Jesus when
[1:08:14] he was on the earth well I believe it
[1:08:16] applies to today too but I also believe
[1:08:18] God gives us more backup with the Holy
[1:08:20] Spirit here in revelation 22:17 the
[1:08:23] spirit and the bride say come and let
[1:08:27] him that here say come and let him that
[1:08:29] is athirst say come and whosoever will
[1:08:31] let him take the water of life freely
[1:08:35] how many could go for a good drink of
[1:08:37] spiritual water tonight anyway thirsty
[1:08:39] for some spiritual water the Bible said
[1:08:42] come come to Jesus come to the Holy
[1:08:45] Spirit and get a good drink of spiritual
[1:08:47] water amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:08:51] he's saying come he's not saying stay
[1:08:54] out no you're not good enough he's
[1:08:56] saying come unto me take a good
[1:08:58] spiritual drink in the presence of the
[1:08:59] Lord and that's done through prayer of
[1:09:02] course so people are thirsty you know
[1:09:07] they're they're spiritually thirsty or
[1:09:09] they don't feel like they've got the
[1:09:11] anointing of the Lord it's because they
[1:09:12] need to pray and it's whosoever see
[1:09:15] everybody anybody who's thirsty for more
[1:09:18] of God can have more of God amen so
[1:09:21] that's the reality that God has called
[1:09:23] us and invited us unto himself also
[1:09:28] there's the reality that God delights in
[1:09:30] our honest prayers I think I read this
[1:09:31] last week
[1:09:33] God loves honest prayer because the
[1:09:37] Bible said the sacrifice of the wicked
[1:09:39] and his abomination Lord but the prayer
[1:09:41] is of the upright is his delight amen
[1:09:46] remember the guy remember in the Jesus
[1:09:48] told the story of the Pharisee who is
[1:09:50] all I thank God I'm not like that dirty
[1:09:52] publican and I fast twice a week and I
[1:09:54] give alms of everything and Thais and I
[1:09:56] thank you that I'm not as filthy as that
[1:09:59] person but Jesus said the man who was
[1:10:02] received was the one who said be
[1:10:04] merciful to me a sinner praise God that
[1:10:07] prayer he was upright man he realized I
[1:10:10] made mistakes and Lord I need your mercy
[1:10:13] and I think that's many times that we
[1:10:15] just need to say Lord I need your mercy
[1:10:16] I've had a rough day I've had a rough
[1:10:19] morning I had a rough week Lord be
[1:10:21] merciful to me God will delight in that
[1:10:23] why because you're being honest
[1:10:26] you're being upright lord I made a
[1:10:28] mistake here I failed here Lord it was
[1:10:31] my fault there have mercy on me and when
[1:10:34] we come like that and say well at least
[1:10:37] I'm not a Baptist or at least I'm not a
[1:10:39] Jehovah's Witness at least I'm not a
[1:10:41] Mormon that's the wrong attitude the
[1:10:44] right attitude is to admit you're wrong
[1:10:46] and ask God for mercy and just start
[1:10:49] afresh
[1:10:51] walk in the light where there's no
[1:10:53] condemnation to them they're in the
[1:10:54] light and that's done through prayer the
[1:10:57] prayer of the upright God loves to hear
[1:11:00] an honest prayer remember Jesus we're
[1:11:02] not going to ovince my remember jesus
[1:11:03] said I you know when you pray don't give
[1:11:06] a nepotism not interested in in that you
[1:11:09] saying the same thing I want to hear the
[1:11:11] honest prayer from your heart that's
[1:11:14] what God is most interested in not the
[1:11:17] amount of words not the amount of
[1:11:20] repetition but he just wants an honest
[1:11:22] upright prayer from our hearts that's
[1:11:24] the reality
[1:11:25] God loves honest upright prayers and
[1:11:28] this is some I got a few new scriptures
[1:11:31] in here I wanted well I think one new
[1:11:33] scripture I want to share with you I
[1:11:34] think you'll be really blessed prayer
[1:11:36] let's look at the reality that prayer
[1:11:39] should stir you up I don't know but this
[1:11:43] happens every Wednesday when we pray and
[1:11:44] every Sunday and I find it a home to the
[1:11:48] more I pray it stirs me up for the rest
[1:11:50] of the service I don't know if you find
[1:11:53] that to be true in your life I hope you
[1:11:54] do but the Bible literally says prayer
[1:11:57] should stir you up if prayer doesn't
[1:12:01] stir you up you're not praying the right
[1:12:02] kind of prayer and the church said amen
[1:12:06] that's right prayer literally I'm gonna
[1:12:08] show you this next Scripture I've never
[1:12:09] preached this scripture before the
[1:12:11] reality is that prayer ought to get you
[1:12:14] stirred up thinking about God and then
[1:12:17] and if you pray the right way it does
[1:12:19] get God's attention so here's the
[1:12:23] scripture I've never preached it and
[1:12:24] look at this look as a ax 64 verse 6 but
[1:12:27] we are all as an unclean thing and our
[1:12:30] righteousnesses are as filthy rags and
[1:12:33] we do all fade as a leaf and our
[1:12:37] iniquities like the wind has taken us
[1:12:40] away now look at this next scripture and
[1:12:42] there's none that calleth upon thy name
[1:12:45] that stirreth up himself to take hold of
[1:12:50] thee now remember these were already
[1:12:53] these people were already in the
[1:12:54] Covenant these were not sinners Isaiah
[1:12:58] was a prophet I think during the days of
[1:12:59] Josiah so they had already had David
[1:13:02] Solomon and on down in Hezekiah and here
[1:13:06] they are in the days of I believe Joseph
[1:13:07] I'm not worried Hezekiah if I'm not
[1:13:09] mistaken yeah it was Hezekiah and Jer
[1:13:13] and Isaiah says nobody in our nation is
[1:13:16] calling upon you nobody is stirring
[1:13:19] themselves up in prayer to take a hold
[1:13:22] on the promises of God oh praise the
[1:13:26] Lord for thou has hid thy face from us
[1:13:29] and has consumed us because of our
[1:13:31] iniquities see these are people got it
[1:13:34] already called but now they had failed
[1:13:37] to see God in prayer because of their
[1:13:40] sins isn't that powerful how many want
[1:13:43] to be stirred up for Jesus when here's
[1:13:45] what the Bible says you've got a your
[1:13:47] iniquities keep you from being stirred
[1:13:49] up if you're not stirred up and and
[1:13:51] really enthused about Christ and
[1:13:53] thankful for Christianity and the gospel
[1:13:56] it's because we're not stirring up
[1:13:58] ourselves and taking a hold upon the
[1:14:00] presence of God hey idea how about that
[1:14:05] for a prayer scripture I've never
[1:14:06] preached out'n before that's when you
[1:14:08] want to highlight underline I put stars
[1:14:11] in my Bible you went up gonna put a
[1:14:13] bookmark in there you like that one see
[1:14:16] they weren't calling on God and because
[1:14:19] they weren't calling on God they weren't
[1:14:21] stirred up their prayers were not making
[1:14:23] it past the ceiling tile will say like
[1:14:25] that because they were so condemned in
[1:14:27] their sins they were living in their
[1:14:29] iniquities and they
[1:14:31] were stirred up to pray that's right
[1:14:34] look at Jude 1:20 you know this I
[1:14:36] preached this numerous times but ye
[1:14:38] beloved building up yourselves on your
[1:14:40] most holy faith praying in the Holy
[1:14:43] Ghost
[1:14:44] how many wants your spiritual character
[1:14:46] to be build up I don't want to you know
[1:14:51] I said like this with we're having some
[1:14:52] home construction they've built a lot
[1:14:54] but I don't want them to stop building I
[1:14:56] want them to finish what they're
[1:14:58] building I think I'd go downstairs and
[1:15:01] cry if they don't finish their building
[1:15:03] because it's like it's almost there it's
[1:15:07] it's getting built up to a place where
[1:15:09] you can actually live there you know it
[1:15:11] looks like it's you guys gets livable
[1:15:13] well that's what God wants to do in our
[1:15:15] lives but hid for us it's the statue of
[1:15:17] a perfect man it's built up with faith
[1:15:19] virtue knowledge and patience and
[1:15:22] temperance and godless and brother
[1:15:23] kindness and charity
[1:15:25] God wants to build us up but it comes
[1:15:27] through prayer in the Holy Spirit amen
[1:15:30] glory hallelujah
[1:15:33] oh brother Jess I don't feel like God's
[1:15:36] doing anything in my life for I don't
[1:15:37] feel like I'm us where I need to be
[1:15:39] spiritually where the Bible said if you
[1:15:41] need to be built up pray in the Holy
[1:15:43] Ghost amen
[1:15:46] keep yourselves and the love of God so
[1:15:49] you make sure you love your neighbor
[1:15:50] make sure love God make sure you love
[1:15:52] everybody looking for the mercy remember
[1:15:54] again that remember that that the sinner
[1:15:57] who beat us chest and say God have mercy
[1:15:58] on me a sinner say that's what we need
[1:16:00] to constantly say is Lord be merciful to
[1:16:03] me I'm building up my faith as I pray in
[1:16:06] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:16:10] look what brother Branham says children
[1:16:13] you ever see tar on the roads you ever
[1:16:15] see that black tar they place on the
[1:16:16] roads to fill up the cracks brother
[1:16:18] Branham said that's what prayer that's
[1:16:20] that's that's a type of prayer the next
[1:16:23] time you see tar out there think of
[1:16:25] prayer because the girls look brother
[1:16:26] Branham says you should or know what tar
[1:16:28] is you children do when they're fixing
[1:16:32] the street all that awful smell you ever

[1:16:44] cracks on the street and that's the way
[1:16:47] this does it shuts out all the water and
[1:16:50] that's what prayer does for the believer
[1:16:53] and that's what daily keeps the world
[1:16:57] out of you is when you pitch yourself on
[1:17:00] your knees and say Lord Jesus hallelujah
[1:17:04] ever feel like you got any cracks in
[1:17:07] your life and the storms are getting
[1:17:09] through and you feel like there's my
[1:17:12] life isn't where it should be save Jesus

[1:17:16] spiritual tar in my life to keep the
[1:17:19] world out of my cracks hey filling my
[1:17:22] cracks with the power of the Holy Spirit

[1:18:09] you protected praise God it'll keep the
[1:18:12] potholes from coming in your life right
[1:18:16] we don't want potholes in our life on
[1:18:17] the way of holiness or the highway of
[1:18:20] holiness we don't want potholes on the
[1:18:23] way of holiness we want to keep Satan
[1:18:26] out how do you that brother jest well
[1:18:28] the Bible says through prayer prayer
[1:18:32] remember when you pray it grabs a hold
[1:18:35] of God remember God remembered Abraham
[1:18:38] and God sent lot out of Sodom that's how
[1:18:41] powerful Abraham's prayer was God
[1:18:45] remembered it God answered it in other
[1:18:47] words as we saw Abraham stirred himself
[1:18:51] up in prayer and kept praying for 15:40
[1:18:53] 30 and pretty
[1:18:54] soon he got so stirred up he got ahold
[1:18:57] of God and God said I won't destroy it
[1:18:59] for Ted and God said I will destroy the
[1:19:02] righteous with the wicked so I'll go
[1:19:04] down there and save lot because of your
[1:19:05] prayer Abraham let's let's see a stirred
[1:19:07] up like that
[1:19:08] so God we can get a hold of God's Word
[1:19:10] and God will hear our prayer and God
[1:19:12] will answer our prayer
[1:19:13] let's pray like that let's be enthused
[1:19:15] about prayer right let's get stirred up
[1:19:18] about prayer hallelujah
[1:19:21] that's right church man I remember Jacob
[1:19:24] when he was wrestling the angel he got
[1:19:27] so stirred up in brother Ram likens us
[1:19:28] on the prayer wrestling with God his
[1:19:31] prayer right we want the will of God to
[1:19:33] be done he got so stirred up he got
[1:19:35] ahold of God and said I'm not letting go
[1:19:37] till you bless me and we've got to pray
[1:19:39] and say God I'm holding on this promise
[1:19:41] I'm not gonna let go this promise until
[1:19:43] you answer it praise God Amen that's the
[1:19:47] is the reality of Isaiah 64 verse 6
[1:19:50] there's nobody that's stirring
[1:19:52] themselves up and taking ahold of God
[1:19:55] we've got to stir ourselves up with
[1:19:57] prayer and take a hold on the promise of
[1:19:59] God amen
[1:20:02] in church we got to remember the reality
[1:20:07] of the nearness of God's presence when
[1:20:09] we pray when you pray sincerely God's
[1:20:12] presence comes to you it's a reality
[1:20:17] because the Bible said the Lord is nigh
[1:20:19] unto all them that call upon him that
[1:20:22] all that call upon him in truth
[1:20:25] we got to seek Him first remember he's
[1:20:27] gotta be the first thing we do in the
[1:20:29] day let's call upon the Lord he will
[1:20:32] fulfill the desire of them that fear him
[1:20:34] he will also hear their cry and we'll
[1:20:36] save them amen now if you got your
[1:20:41] Bibles let's go to Hebrews chapter 10
[1:20:42] this is just a beautiful portion of
[1:20:46] Scripture we're probably familiar with
[1:20:48] but I'd say if we want if we want to
[1:20:50] pray more and brother man said we can
[1:20:52] never pray too much so I'm sure you and
[1:20:55] I all want to pray more tonight right
[1:20:58] this is one of the most beautiful
[1:20:59] scriptures describing how we can access
[1:21:03] heaven Hebrews 10:19 having there
[1:21:08] or brethren boldness to enter into the
[1:21:11] holiest by the blood of Jesus by a new
[1:21:15] and living way which he hath consecrated
[1:21:17] for us through the veil that is to say
[1:21:19] through his flesh and having an High
[1:21:23] Priest over the house of God let us draw
[1:21:25] near with a true heart in full assurance
[1:21:28] of faith having our hearts sprinkled
[1:21:31] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[1:21:33] washed with pure water let us hold fast
[1:21:36] the profession there's that holding on
[1:21:38] to God right stir up yourselves and hold
[1:21:40] on to God ha ha glory of our faith
[1:21:44] without wavering for he is faithful that
[1:21:46] promised and let us consider one another
[1:21:49] to provoke one another unto good works
[1:21:51] let me stop right there so there's the
[1:21:55] reality tonight when we pray if you and
[1:21:57] I were pranked sincerely we were
[1:22:00] supposed to go past this room and we
[1:22:03] were supposed to go to the holiest at
[1:22:05] the throne of Jesus Christ the Bible
[1:22:08] said it's a new and living way well
[1:22:12] brother Jesse I sinned well then you
[1:22:14] just confess your sin and then there's
[1:22:15] your heart sprinkled with an with the
[1:22:17] blood of Jesus right that's what's just
[1:22:19] what the Bible said you don't have an
[1:22:20] evil conscience anymore because you
[1:22:22] confess your sin and now when you pray
[1:22:25] you're not praying to the pulpit or
[1:22:27] you're not praying to the the TV screen
[1:22:29] or to me you are praying to Jesus in the
[1:22:33] holiest of Holies in heaven amen
[1:22:36] Oh glory and you got a holdfast onto
[1:22:40] that profession of faith this is a
[1:22:44] privilege so we'll get to that in just a
[1:22:45] moment but prayer is a privilege you and
[1:22:48] I have it is an absolute privilege it's
[1:22:52] a blessing that we can pray on to God
[1:22:54] because remember we read proverbs 1
[1:22:55] there's going to be millions of people
[1:22:57] that God won't even hear their prayers
[1:22:58] God will laugh at their calamity the
[1:23:01] Bible says it's a privilege that we can
[1:23:06] be washed and clean and then we can
[1:23:08] approach God and God will actually turn
[1:23:10] his ear and say what was that sister
[1:23:12] Connie
[1:23:13] yes brother Jesse yes sister Kristen yes
[1:23:16] I heard your prayer
[1:23:18] other people he's not going to do that
[1:23:21] he's just going to turn his back because
[1:23:22] they didn't confess their iniquities but
[1:23:25] it's a privilege that God would hear our
[1:23:27] prayers it's the something we must not
[1:23:31] take lightly it's a new and living way
[1:23:36] the Jews right now cannot come boldly
[1:23:40] before the holiest of Holies they don't
[1:23:42] have a blood sacrifice to get there but
[1:23:44] we've got a blood sacrifice to get there
[1:23:47] amen it's new it's a living way it's
[1:23:50] alive our prayers are going to a living
[1:23:53] God amen it's a privilege God hears our
[1:23:58] prayers remember I don't know if you
[1:24:00] heard that last Wednesday but we prayed
[1:24:02] for a preacher out in Illinois he
[1:24:04] everytime went to the restroom he was
[1:24:06] seeing blood and he said he asked me to
[1:24:08] pray so we prayed he said he went to the
[1:24:10] doctor they examined him he's got no
[1:24:12] more bleeding he's got a perfect bill of
[1:24:14] health
[1:24:14] and he said God took time out of his
[1:24:17] busy schedule and heard your prayer
[1:24:18] brother Jesse and he answered my any
[1:24:21] answer my request praise the Lord
[1:24:24] that ought to encourage us that God is
[1:24:26] the Living God amen
[1:24:28] it encourages me that all although not
[1:24:31] every prayer works like that it's it's a
[1:24:33] tremendous blessing when it does work
[1:24:35] like that and it encourages us to keep
[1:24:38] praying for all men because God will
[1:24:40] work everything perfectly he makes all
[1:24:42] things beautiful when in his own time
[1:24:44] he'll make everything beautiful remember
[1:24:48] we're to draw near remember God
[1:24:58] you
[1:25:02] and then Karis is requesting the pastor
[1:25:05] Mozambique when I was praying for that I
[1:25:08] felt like I got close to God at that
[1:25:10] point it didn't matter how many words I
[1:25:12] said I just wanted to be sincere before
[1:25:15] God because I realized I'm in his
[1:25:18] presence praise the Lord it's not at
[1:25:22] that point it's not a labor just to see
[1:25:25] how many words I can get out remember
[1:25:27] the Bible said let my words be few be
[1:25:31] still know that I'm God
[1:25:32] right heaven in this throne earth is a
[1:25:34] foot still and they said let your words
[1:25:36] be few there's 30 minutes already can
[1:25:39] you believe that I can't believe I
[1:25:42] preached 30 minutes already what have I
[1:25:43] said in 30 minutes mercy but see nothing
[1:25:47] that's what I know I'm really getting in
[1:25:49] sincere prayer because it's not about
[1:25:51] just getting out the prayer and praying
[1:25:52] for everybody
[1:25:53] it's just expressing that desire and
[1:25:56] knowing that God hears every word I say
[1:26:00] it's not vain repetition it's not a race
[1:26:02] it's not trying to rush this I get to it
[1:26:04] but it's enjoying that presence and
[1:26:06] knowing that his presence is near to me
[1:26:09] because I've draw nigh to him he's
[1:26:11] already seeked me I wasn't seeking him
[1:26:13] first but now that he's seeking me he
[1:26:15] wants me to seek him back and to build
[1:26:19] up my faith it's a privilege to pray
[1:26:22] remember the Bible said this for the law
[1:26:24] made nothing perfect but the bringing in
[1:26:26] of a better hope did by the by the which
[1:26:28] we draw nigh unto God we have a better
[1:26:31] hope our hope is in heaven Jesus Christ
[1:26:34] is in heaven
[1:26:35] he's our hope and by that Hope Christ we
[1:26:37] draw nigh to God see that's when we when
[1:26:40] we don't praise when we lose hope like
[1:26:42] oh god don't hear my prayers or I must
[1:26:44] have upset God or upset heaven or
[1:26:46] something like that but see we can't let
[1:26:48] Satan keep us like that we got to
[1:26:49] remember that Jesus can instantly wash
[1:26:52] away our sins what can wash away my sins
[1:26:55] and guilt and depression nothing but the
[1:26:57] blood of Jesus amen
[1:26:59] right there there's the blood washes
[1:27:01] away all that amen it's a hope we have a
[1:27:07] better hope remember this
[1:27:11] again about drawing night it's a reality
[1:27:12] when we draw nigh to God God comes close
[1:27:16] to us
[1:27:16] I always remember brother Brooks told me
[1:27:19] right when I first started preaching he
[1:27:20] said he said just keep doing what you're
[1:27:22] doing which was prayer and fasting and
[1:27:24] studying and everything like that and
[1:27:26] then he said the more you pray the
[1:27:28] closer God will get it stuck with me my
[1:27:30] whole Christian life the more you pray
[1:27:32] the closer God gets but God giveth more
[1:27:36] grace wherefore you say if God resists
[1:27:38] the proud but gives grace unto the
[1:27:40] humble submit yourselves therefore to
[1:27:43] God so that's obey God resist the devil
[1:27:46] and he'll flee from you draw nigh to God
[1:27:49] and He will draw nigh to you cleanser
[1:27:52] hanji sinners and purify your hearts you
[1:27:54] double-minded so again we're promised we
[1:27:58] we first got to fight off Satan we got a
[1:28:01] you know knockout Satan got to give him
[1:28:03] a couple punches and resist them and
[1:28:05] Satan will leave eventually then you'll
[1:28:08] draw nigh to God and then God will come
[1:28:10] close to you it's a reality or I don't
[1:28:14] feel God's presence on well first obey
[1:28:17] the Lord rebuke Satan and then draw nigh
[1:28:20] to God you are promised a fearless
[1:28:22] presence it's an absolute promise of God
[1:28:26] Amen and so if you can see the first
[1:28:31] chapter I read was called the realities
[1:28:32] of prayer that's why I'm just using this
[1:28:34] thought on the reality
[1:28:35] eeehm bounds he's a good good writing so
[1:28:38] far I've really enjoyed I can't wait to
[1:28:39] preach some other things and I've read
[1:28:41] so there's the reality of our privilege
[1:28:44] of Prayer it is a total privilege it's
[1:28:48] like a it's like a free pass we have
[1:28:50] unto God through the blood of Jesus
[1:28:52] Christ
[1:28:53] remember sinners don't have that God
[1:28:55] there their prayer and their church
[1:28:58] attendance if they're in sin still and
[1:29:00] iniquities it's abomination unto God the
[1:29:03] Bible said their prayer is an
[1:29:05] abomination unto God when they're living
[1:29:06] in sin and they know the word but they
[1:29:08] don't obey it but ours is a delight if
[1:29:12] we're living right before God now here's
[1:29:15] where the Bible tells us the privilege
[1:29:16] because we have access so he reconciled
[1:29:19] both unto God in one body by the cross
[1:29:21] having slain the entity thereby and
[1:29:25] came and preached peace to you which
[1:29:26] were afar off and to them that were not
[1:29:28] for through him we both have access by
[1:29:32] one spirit unto the Father how many ever
[1:29:39] like to get access to somebody that
[1:29:42] that's maybe got a lot of power and
[1:29:44] authority you ever had access to anybody
[1:29:46] you know I have some friends that won
[1:29:47] the Super Bowl and sometimes I have
[1:29:48] access to them sometimes they'll text me
[1:29:50] back and I think I feel kind of like
[1:29:53] funny like wow I can access a famous
[1:29:56] person you know but then after a while
[1:29:58] like when inviting them to you know do
[1:30:00] different things they don't they don't
[1:30:01] contact me anymore like the access gets
[1:30:03] cut off but that's just worldly but the
[1:30:07] Bible said we have access by the spirit
[1:30:10] to the Father we have an open channel to
[1:30:15] the foul we have God's open ear God will
[1:30:19] listen to us through the cross because
[1:30:24] he slew all your sins amen he slew all
[1:30:28] that he took that out all the way and
[1:30:30] now God gives us a channel to talk unto
[1:30:34] him we have access to God so now you're
[1:30:38] not a stranger to god you're not a
[1:30:40] foreigner to God you are fellow sitting
[1:30:43] you're one of the Saints I'm so glad I
[1:30:45] can say I'm one of them I'm one of
[1:30:46] Apostle Paul's brothers I'm one of
[1:30:50] Barnabas as brothers in the gospel amen
[1:30:52] I'm pretty I preached what they preach
[1:30:55] right I'm preaching with their preaching
[1:30:56] and the household of God we have access
[1:31:00] to God it's a privilege that we have
[1:31:03] access to God
[1:31:04] most people like I said most people are
[1:31:06] strangers most people are foreigners
[1:31:08] most people are enemies of God few there
[1:31:10] be that be saved now let's look at here
[1:31:15] the reality of God's desire for constant
[1:31:18] prayer that's the reality of it God
[1:31:20] desires us to constantly pray now you
[1:31:24] remember the parable of the unjust judge
[1:31:26] and he spoke a parable unto them to this
[1:31:29] end that men ought always to pray and
[1:31:32] not to faint
[1:31:35] remember the story
[1:31:36] his desperation brother Brahim kinda
[1:31:38] dramatizes it he said he said that woman
[1:31:42] would knock and he said but you've got
[1:31:44] to keep knocking you got to stay
[1:31:46] knocking on the door you know ask seek
[1:31:48] and knock him other man said Here I am
[1:31:50] Lord I'm on your hands I'm waiting for
[1:31:52] you to open the door unto me and that's
[1:31:54] what the parable is this woman keeps
[1:31:55] coming to the king and say Lord I need
[1:31:57] this Lord I need this and eventually
[1:31:59] gets tired and just gives it to her well
[1:32:01] God doesn't get tired of you God
[1:32:03] delights when you come amen but he's
[1:32:05] waiting for the right time to answer
[1:32:07] your prayer and so Jesus gives us that
[1:32:12] parable keep knocking people that have
[1:32:15] genuine faith we'll keep knocking praise
[1:32:17] the Lord
[1:32:18] they'll keep knocking keep believing
[1:32:20] keep seeking always pray that's the
[1:32:24] reality of it God wants us to pray all
[1:32:27] the time
[1:32:29] Philippians 4:6 be careful for nothing
[1:32:31] don't worry about anything the Bible
[1:32:33] said but in everything by prayer and
[1:32:38] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[1:32:40] requests be made known unto God in
[1:32:43] everything so whatever you're struggling
[1:32:46] with whatever you're maybe having
[1:32:48] trouble being thankful for or whatever
[1:32:50] you're struggling with worrying about
[1:32:51] this worry about that we've got to take
[1:32:54] that worry we've got to take that
[1:32:55] anxiety and go to God in prayer and say
[1:32:58] God I'm guilty of worry I'm guilty of
[1:33:01] anxiety build up my faith in the Holy
[1:33:03] Ghost stir me up and help me to take a
[1:33:06] hold upon the word of God amen that's
[1:33:09] all we can do the Bible said we cannot
[1:33:12] worry about anything it's a sin don't
[1:33:15] worry right because it's unbelief it's
[1:33:18] fair we cannot be careful for anything
[1:33:21] and the Bible said if you pray like this
[1:33:24] you're guaranteed the peace of God the
[1:33:27] peace of God which passes all
[1:33:28] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:33:30] minds through Christ Jesus hallelujah
[1:33:36] how many believe that scripture
[1:33:38] everybody believed that can't worry
[1:33:40] can't worry God's peace will keep you it
[1:33:44] will keep you but you've gotta in
[1:33:45] everything let your requests Lord this
[1:33:48] is really difficult looks difficult but
[1:33:49] let me
[1:33:50] I want to let you know my request Lord
[1:33:52] could you do this Lord would you do this
[1:33:54] and when you do that you'll feel the
[1:33:56] peace of God well I've asked God I've
[1:33:58] done all I can do and so I know it's in
[1:34:02] God's hand I know God heard of my prayer
[1:34:03] like recently I was at a family's house
[1:34:06] in Copley I think I told you about it
[1:34:08] when I don't know how many people join
[1:34:09] me but I fasted and prayed for their
[1:34:11] older son and nothing's happened yet but
[1:34:13] I told the father and the mother I said
[1:34:16] I said with prayer and fasting
[1:34:20] that is the full extreme that is the the
[1:34:23] greatest extreme of Christian go to to
[1:34:26] show God you're sincere about a prayer
[1:34:28] request and I said when you pray and
[1:34:30] fast
[1:34:31] you've taken the time you're going to
[1:34:33] eat you've taken that you've set that
[1:34:35] aside and you've devoted that time to
[1:34:37] prayer and God sees your effort that you
[1:34:40] want this request more than you want
[1:34:42] your food and and when you've done that
[1:34:45] you can have peace with God because
[1:34:48] you've shown God that you mean business
[1:34:49] and you can have confidence God I've
[1:34:52] sacrificed I made every effort I've been
[1:34:56] like job I've sacrificed it on your
[1:34:58] altar and I'm putting it in your hands
[1:35:00] and I could have peace I've done
[1:35:01] everything I know how to do to hear let
[1:35:04] to let God hear my voice amen and so
[1:35:06] they had peace with that and they've
[1:35:08] text me back and said we're so thankful
[1:35:10] you're in our lives and you are such a
[1:35:12] comfort to our lives these parents who
[1:35:15] you know this child who's addicted to
[1:35:17] marijuana I think it's some other things
[1:35:18] like that but see this is what we that's
[1:35:21] what we must do that gives us the peace
[1:35:23] of God once we've done all we can do
[1:35:25] once we've made our requests known unto
[1:35:27] God then the peace of God comforts us
[1:35:30] then we can wait upon God this is some
[1:35:34] of the sweetest instructions here in the
[1:35:37] Bible for Christians Romans 12:10 be
[1:35:40] kindly affectioned one to another with
[1:35:42] brotherly love and honour preferring one
[1:35:44] another not slothful in business fervent
[1:35:48] that's boiling member in the spirit
[1:35:51] serving the Lord rejoicing in Hope
[1:35:53] patient in tribulation continuing
[1:35:56] instant in prayer distributing
[1:36:01] the necessity of the Saints given to
[1:36:03] hospitality isn't that just like a
[1:36:04] boom-boom-boom-boom-boom list of I need
[1:36:06] to do that today I need to do that today
[1:36:08] I need to do that what a great summary
[1:36:12] of what it looks like to be a Christian
[1:36:13] you work as hard as you can in your
[1:36:15] business right you're constantly praying
[1:36:17] you're rejoicing in the hope you're
[1:36:19] patient in all your trials you're you're
[1:36:22] constantly given to people that need it
[1:36:23] that's a real Christian life but the
[1:36:27] instant of prayer instant means to it to
[1:36:30] be glued to to adhere to to be devoted
[1:36:34] so you and I are to be devoted to prayer
[1:36:39] and so I want to just close I got I got
[1:36:42] four more minutes that'll be 45 minutes
[1:36:45] I'll preach so I try to I'll try to stay
[1:36:46] with that if I can I'll try the reality
[1:36:51] of prayer as your responsibility or
[1:36:54] devotion to God remember in Proverbs one
[1:36:58] God did not hear them because they
[1:37:01] didn't take the responsibility of
[1:37:03] praying remember that's what God said
[1:37:05] because he said you didn't call because
[1:37:08] you didn't answer when I called and you
[1:37:10] didn't now when you call I'm not gonna
[1:37:12] answer you Church it is our
[1:37:15] responsibility and our devotion to pray
[1:37:18] that's our our responsibility brother
[1:37:24] Branham says is he talking about the
[1:37:25] bride in Christ and then he eventually
[1:37:28] against how we should pray I'm speaking
[1:37:31] of how it can get away when you get to
[1:37:33] mix it up with the words I'm out of the
[1:37:34] church mixes and flirts with the world
[1:37:36] the church and all the fashions and
[1:37:38] things that we have we're no more like
[1:37:40] the original Pentecost was then day is
[1:37:42] from night we've drifted off somewhere
[1:37:44] into some dark chaos somewhere and lost
[1:37:46] he's talking about when a church drifts
[1:37:48] off from the Pentecostal experience what
[1:37:52] a sacred trust you've probably heard
[1:37:54] this before what a responsibility to a
[1:37:57] woman not to drift off right with
[1:37:59] another man now see why she's a type of
[1:38:01] the church which has the same
[1:38:03] responsibilities as a woman has a sacred
[1:38:06] responsibility to her motherhood to her
[1:38:09] virtues to her husband the church has a
[1:38:12] sacred responsibility to pray
[1:38:14] and to the word and to Christ just the
[1:38:19] same as the woman has so just as a
[1:38:22] regular wife must be faithful just to
[1:38:24] her husband so the church must be
[1:38:26] faithful to prayer to Christ and notice
[1:38:31] is not just the responsibility like well
[1:38:33] I've got to do this I gotta take out the
[1:38:34] trash I got to pay the mortgage I got to
[1:38:37] do that pray the insurance but it's
[1:38:38] actually sacred like this is special
[1:38:40] this is really important that I pray to
[1:38:43] Christ it's a sacred responsibility it's
[1:38:47] something we need to take very seriously
[1:38:49] I like this this is just encouraging
[1:38:57] that some people will pray more than
[1:38:58] others but member all of us are still
[1:39:00] called to pray all the time I'm to
[1:39:02] understand that I believe God's got a
[1:39:05] variety the world proves that he's got
[1:39:07] big mountains and little mountains he's
[1:39:08] got plains he's got deserts he's got
[1:39:10] different things because he made it the
[1:39:12] way he wanted it and he made this season
[1:39:14] summer winter spring autumn he made the
[1:39:16] seasons it shows he's a God of variety
[1:39:18] he made you in a variety some men are
[1:39:21] real blusterous and some are real
[1:39:23] dogmatic so blessed means you get upset
[1:39:25] real fast dogmatic I mean you're really
[1:39:27] systematic and others are fine and
[1:39:30] others are kind and you just find all
[1:39:33] different kinds of people and in his
[1:39:35] kingdom see Andrew is that prayer
[1:39:38] warrior so the Apostle Andrew but ramza
[1:39:42] was a prayer warriors there must have
[1:39:43] been some history about him he just
[1:39:46] stayed on his knees all the time the
[1:39:48] Apostle Peter was one of those
[1:39:49] firebrands that preached and so forth
[1:39:52] and Paul was more scholarly like more
[1:39:55] like the Prophet or something and set
[1:39:56] back so I'm just reading you this to
[1:39:59] encourage you there will be people that
[1:40:01] will be more prayer warriors than others
[1:40:03] because that's their calling in life but
[1:40:06] remember we should pray for all men and
[1:40:09] we should all pray without ceasing but
[1:40:12] there's going to be some people that are
[1:40:14] prayer warriors and they're gonna pray
[1:40:16] more often than others
[1:40:22] I think I got a few more here let me see
[1:40:24] where I'm at yeah I just got a few more
[1:40:27] yeah you like this one but Bram said
[1:40:30] don't you like to get alone with the
[1:40:31] Lord how many like to get alone with the
[1:40:33] Lord I bet your mothers are saying oh
[1:40:34] yeah he's got kids with you all the time
[1:40:38] that's very special for a mother to get
[1:40:40] alone with the Lord
[1:40:41] dads - there's my 45 minutes okay I mean
[1:40:45] do five more I'll try to finish here
[1:40:47] don't you like to get alone with the
[1:40:48] Lord my my just to be alone we used to
[1:40:52] sing a little song there sometimes I
[1:40:53] like to be all alone with Christ my lord
[1:40:55] did you ever hear I can tell him all my
[1:40:57] troubles all alone and that's the way he
[1:41:01] wants to get you alone to himself he
[1:41:04] wants to get you and I alone to himself
[1:41:09] your prayers not so much as when you're
[1:41:12] all maybe coming you know for instance
[1:41:14] well out in the public when you're
[1:41:15] praying like in church around the altar
[1:41:17] get alone so God saying it's even when
[1:41:20] we pray here that's fine but God wants
[1:41:22] to get you totally alone now we've got
[1:41:25] to make sure when we get alone we don't
[1:41:27] run to our phones or to entertainment
[1:41:30] when we should run to prayer because if
[1:41:33] you ever find yourself alone on board or
[1:41:35] I'm tired I think I'll just get on my
[1:41:37] phone I think I'll just you know do this
[1:41:38] that's the time God wants us to pray he
[1:41:42] wants to get us alone you'll prayer you
[1:41:48] listen I look at the stuff you'll pray a
[1:41:50] different prayer when you're by yourself
[1:41:53] then you do when you're in the public
[1:41:57] slip alone all of you all of you see go
[1:42:00] out and just have a real secret meeting
[1:42:02] place where you and the lord meet
[1:42:04] several times a day and praying I know
[1:42:05] that's hard for moms you know hon hon
[1:42:07] sorry
[1:42:07] and maybe dad's too but how many believe
[1:42:10] this is true how many they didn't Daniel
[1:42:12] how many times of Daniel pray right
[1:42:13] three times a day he got alone with God
[1:42:18] because God wants to meet that's the way
[1:42:20] he wants to get you alone to himself
[1:42:23] God's up there thinking ah if I could
[1:42:26] just get Malachi alone with myself tell
[1:42:28] you some of the kids if I can just get
[1:42:31] Jesse alone to himself
[1:42:32] he's so busy doing this I can just I
[1:42:35] just want
[1:42:35] spend a little time with him I can just
[1:42:38] get these mothers I can just get this
[1:42:40] mother alone to herself I can spend some
[1:42:44] time with her
[1:42:45] I heard Danny Regan preach at one time
[1:42:47] that sometimes when he goes into prayer
[1:42:49] he says Lord this is your my time now
[1:42:51] and I just almost cry when I say it
[1:42:53] where you go to God you say Lord this is
[1:42:56] your my time together I want to spend
[1:42:59] some time with you Lord I want to tell
[1:43:01] you all that's in my heart I want to
[1:43:03] tell you all my trouble it's just you
[1:43:04] and I I don't wanna tell my husband I
[1:43:06] don't tell my wife
[1:43:07] I don't wanna tell my children I don't
[1:43:08] tell the pastor my troubles I just want
[1:43:10] to tell you my troubles and I want I
[1:43:13] want to I want to have the peace of God
[1:43:16] that passes all understanding I don't
[1:43:18] want to be anxious about this I want the
[1:43:21] peace of God to rule my heart I'm not
[1:43:26] gonna spend much time on this like I
[1:43:28] said I want to close but I just want to
[1:43:29] remember it remind you of this the
[1:43:31] reality that our unconfessed sins
[1:43:33] hinders our prayers God told Isaiah this
[1:43:36] remember this is the same scripture I
[1:43:37] just read in Isaiah 64 about you got to
[1:43:39] stir yourself up and take a hold on God
[1:43:41] when you're spread forth your hands I
[1:43:43] will hide my eyes from you yeh when you
[1:43:46] make many prayers I will not hear
[1:43:47] because your hands are full of blood see
[1:43:50] they're guilty they haven't confessed
[1:43:51] their sins and then he says I'll wash
[1:43:53] you and then I love this scripture
[1:43:55] though your sins be as scarlet those
[1:43:57] should be white as snow so that's a
[1:44:00] reality if we've got blood on our hands
[1:44:01] if we're guilty and haven't made it
[1:44:04] right God can't God doesn't hear those
[1:44:06] prayers because we've got to make that
[1:44:08] right first and I think I'm closing with
[1:44:12] this this because this kind of ties in
[1:44:14] with our I got two more yeah ties in
[1:44:18] with our other series the reality that
[1:44:22] wisdom comes through prayer if we want
[1:44:25] to be more wise I don't want to make the
[1:44:26] wise choices in life it only comes
[1:44:30] through prayer because the Bible says if
[1:44:33] you lack wisdom let him ask God so you
[1:44:35] have to ask Lord I don't know what to do
[1:44:38] in this situation
[1:44:39] so you got to ask because God will give
[1:44:43] it to you very freely he'll freely give
[1:44:45] it liberally he'll give it to you very
[1:44:47] freely
[1:44:48] and he upbraideth not he's not gonna
[1:44:50] rebuke you when you ask it shall be
[1:44:52] given him but you gotta ask in faith
[1:44:54] nothing wavering and that's right when
[1:44:57] we pray when we pray we got to make sure
[1:44:59] we pray sincerely enough not long enough
[1:45:02] but sincerely enough until we feel God
[1:45:04] drawing nigh unto us where it's not
[1:45:07] about the number of words it's not about
[1:45:08] how much time but it's about feeling his
[1:45:11] presence and talking to God you know
[1:45:13] he's draw near to you then you can say
[1:45:16] God I really need wisdom and then when
[1:45:18] you leave that prayer you can say praise
[1:45:20] the Lord I know he's gonna give it to me
[1:45:22] that's what the scripture says I don't
[1:45:24] doubt it because I felt his presence I
[1:45:26] felt there was a holy sacredness around
[1:45:29] me I asked him I know he heard me I
[1:45:31] don't feel that presence all the time I
[1:45:33] feel that in prayer amen
[1:45:35] I remember this we read this last week
[1:45:38] to Solomon told his son
[1:45:41] if you cry after knowledge if you lift
[1:45:44] up your voice in prayer for
[1:45:45] understanding if you seek wisdom as
[1:45:47] silver and search for as hid treasures
[1:45:49] you'll understand the fear of God and
[1:45:52] find the knowledge of God let's say in
[1:45:54] our feet I think I'll just stop right
[1:46:06] there by the grace of Lord let me just
[1:46:08] go back to that quote let's just think
[1:46:10] about this quote as we get ready to pray
[1:46:12] here I'm just getting alone with God
[1:46:18] it's good to pray here this is the House
[1:46:20] of Prayer how many could say amen to
[1:46:21] that
[1:46:22] it's the House of Prayer but jesus said
[1:46:24] the the prayers that he hears are the
[1:46:28] seeker prayers because then he rewards
[1:46:31] those openly in public around sinners
[1:46:35] around family at the church he rewards
[1:46:38] us openly when we pray like that but you
[1:46:45] our heads here were for a word of Prayer
[1:46:47] by the grace of God Father in heaven we
[1:46:53] thank you for tonight Lord God we thank
[1:46:54] you for the word that we've heard lord I
[1:46:57] pray after tonight I just pray that we
[1:46:59] would be changed Lord we'd go from glory
[1:47:02] to a little more glory we go from the
[1:47:05] faith that we started the service with
[1:47:07] to a little more faith as we read last
[1:47:10] Wednesday the glory of God would shine
[1:47:14] more and more unto a perfect day
[1:47:17] Lord let our lights be a little bit
[1:47:20] brighter leaving here tonight faith
[1:47:22] comes by hearing hearing by the word
[1:47:24] Lord our faith has grown tonight and now
[1:47:27] we've got to take what we've heard and
[1:47:28] we've got to go build up that faith
[1:47:30] through prayer in the Holy Spirit in our
[1:47:32] homes that's your pattern it's a reality
[1:47:36] oh just I want to thank you for the
[1:47:40] realities of Prayer Lord God thank you
[1:47:45] for the reality Lord God that you're
[1:47:47] inviting us to come and drink of these
[1:47:50] refreshing waters thank you Jesus
[1:47:54] I feel refreshed tonight lord I thank
[1:47:57] you God for your Holy Spirit or I felt
[1:48:01] your presence draw nigh Lord God as we
[1:48:05] draw nigh to you you draw nigh to us
[1:48:08] Lord God
[1:48:10] [Music]
[1:48:13] nor does we close in prayer here dear
[1:48:16] God just just help us Lord God be
[1:48:19] merciful to us as we said help wasn't
[1:48:21] that supposed to be beating our chests
[1:48:23] that we'd say symbolically be merciful
[1:48:26] to me Lord God I want to get alone with
[1:48:28] you I want to spend more time in prayer
[1:48:30] be merciful to me I know you're waiting
[1:48:38] up there that we'd say you're waiting
[1:48:41] for Jesse Smith get alone more often so
