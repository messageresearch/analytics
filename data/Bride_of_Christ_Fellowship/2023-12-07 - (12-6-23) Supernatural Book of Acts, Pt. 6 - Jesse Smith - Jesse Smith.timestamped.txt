[0:00] cons time of course on school
[0:07] night
[0:08] 7:51 I think this is part six of the
[0:11] supernatural book of Acts Church Lord
[0:14] willing on Sunday I'll have a little
[0:15] more time and I like to go over just
[0:16] some of the highlights of what I enjoyed
[0:18] you know on last Sunday's messages I was
[0:21] really blessed hope you were to by the
[0:25] grace of the
[0:27] Lord and you know I just
[0:30] fting you know and brother Samuel
[0:33] mentioned how he likes our singing you
[0:34] know that's another preacher coming in
[0:37] saying how much he likes our
[0:39] s very thankful for how you worship the
[0:42] Holy Spirit and the spirit and
[0:44] Truth hallelu Grand preachers don't have
[0:47] to come in here and rebuke us and say
[0:48] you need to sing more you need
[0:50] to sometimes that happens that's kind of
[0:52] what happened if you listen to cam
[0:53] service brother bod come in there and he
[0:55] really rebuked him cam got up there and
[0:57] said we needed this
[0:58] rebuke so but I'm sure we all we all
[1:01] need to rebuke about something praise
[1:02] God we all need God's grace we want to
[1:06] receive it God rebukes all his children
[1:08] praise God anyone that is a child of God
[1:10] gets rebuked by the Holy Spirit from
[1:12] time to time so we're thankful again for
[1:15] God's grace thank you for the good
[1:17] fellowship and all the support for two
[1:19] Services there brother
[1:21] said Okay so let's read this here quite
[1:25] a striking scripture to read here as far
[1:27] as a maybe an aggressive scripture this
[1:29] is the Holy Spirit speaking remember
[1:31] here in the book of Acts church and this
[1:33] is the holy spirit rebuking we'd say
[1:36] demon-possessed Pharisees right demon
[1:38] possessed Pharisees this is what the
[1:40] Holy Spirit would
[1:42] say as reviewed remember then right
[1:45] after this the Holy Spirit offers
[1:47] Mercy right because Stephen says father
[1:51] Lord don't lay this to their charge
[1:53] isn't that just like God he gives us a
[1:55] stronger ruk that doesn't mean he's
[1:57] always going to hate us or's he's going
[1:58] to ever going to hate us
[2:00] but he gives us a sharp rebuke to wake
[2:02] us up out of our Slumber right right and
[2:05] he says now come to me that's right now
[2:08] do something about the rebuke receive
[2:10] the rebuke let's read this on three
[2:12] ready one two three ye stiff necked and
[2:16] uncircumcised in heart and ears you do
[2:19] always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[2:22] fathers did so do God bless you as
[2:25] you're being seated there may God bless
[2:28] reading of his word
[2:30] I like to uh you switch over just for a
[2:32] little bit I don't have all my
[2:35] uh I don't have all my notes on here but
[2:37] I just do want to show a few things
[2:40] here just keep this in mind here's a
[2:42] little chart I made I was mentioning it
[2:45] last week you know so I I did a list of
[2:47] the nine gifts in the book of Acts
[2:48] church and I I'll keep this going Lord
[2:50] willing if I can keep the inspiration
[2:53] you know sometimes I'll jump in and out
[2:55] of series I've just kind of been keeping
[2:57] track of the verse in the book of Acts
[2:59] and the gifts that
[3:01] manifest the one thing that was notable
[3:03] last week I said there was six but when
[3:04] I was reading
[3:05] today uh what was interesting about the
[3:07] lame man that walked the Bible said his
[3:09] name through faith in his name made this
[3:12] man whole so either the man had the
[3:15] faith or Peter had the faith but the the
[3:18] whole thing was a miracle right the
[3:19] Bible calls it plainly a notable Miracle
[3:22] but it took Faith to operate the miracle
[3:25] so um I just thought I would you know
[3:28] share that by God's grace you know get
[3:29] on you know we're going to see prophecy
[3:31] remember agabus prophesies he said
[3:32] there's a Dar coming uh and so be
[3:35] prepared for that you know there's kind
[3:38] of reminds us of Joseph the Old
[3:39] Testament seven good years and seven
[3:41] awful years God's given us a lot of good
[3:43] years praise God now despite the
[3:45] inflation we still had good years praise
[3:47] God we still have everything we need no
[3:49] one starving we still have a lot of
[3:51] great Blessings by God's grace now
[3:53] knowledge I think we're going to see
[3:54] that in uh from my understanding uh
[3:57] we'll see that in Acts chapter 8 where
[4:00] Phillip is translated and the unic says
[4:04] I'm reading Isaiah 53 who is this spoken
[4:06] of who is this all about and then the
[4:09] Bible said Philip preaches one service
[4:11] or one one little message to this unic
[4:14] and he gives him understanding of who
[4:15] it's talking about so understanding is
[4:17] knowledge so we'll see you know the
[4:19] first uh eight of the nine gifts will be
[4:23] covered in the first eight chapters of
[4:25] the book of Acts so uh is that a help by
[4:28] God's grace just to kind of see that
[4:30] remember this covers 30 years or 28 we
[4:32] talked about last week you know
[4:33] somewhere around almost three decades so
[4:36] we don't know how many miracles you know
[4:37] we're we're in this entire span of time
[4:40] I imagine many but this is what God
[4:43] records in the book of Acts and so it's
[4:45] neat to see you know uh which ones of
[4:48] these were actually in a church
[4:50] service no no CU this was out on the
[4:53] street uh that was that was Doctrine was
[4:57] teaching house to house lay man know
[4:59] that was public the sermon of Peter that
[5:01] was just kind of like in a a personal
[5:04] meeting with Peter that really wasn't a
[5:05] church
[5:06] service um the shadow that's probably
[5:10] wasn't a church service probably out out
[5:11] in the out in the street or something
[5:13] like that teaching and then Steven's
[5:17] wisdom uh he had wisdom that they he
[5:19] when he was kind of surrounded by the
[5:22] council so I don't think that was in a
[5:23] church service either so that's one
[5:26] thing to keep in mind you know we want
[5:27] to have all the gifts operating but I
[5:29] said I've SE we've seen them all operate
[5:31] within the last 10 years or so we've
[5:33] seen them all operate now we'd like to
[5:35] see them more right here just because we
[5:37] love the experience of the presence of
[5:41] God brother R said when the gifts
[5:43] operate this is what brother said I
[5:44] don't have the quote ready but I could
[5:45] find it R said when gifts operate in the
[5:48] church it's the closest thing you'll
[5:50] ever have to heaven on Earth until the
[5:53] Millennium right Hallelujah so he said
[5:56] that Thrills every person's heart right
[5:59] to be able to know wow I'm in the
[6:01] presence of God we felt I really felt
[6:03] that on Sunday morning I really felt you
[6:05] know the presence of God it was a
[6:06] beautiful uh atmosphere and of course
[6:08] Sunday night was great too but I think I
[6:10] was if you're like me I was kind of worn
[6:12] out by Sunday
[6:14] night we that's just how our church is
[6:16] like I told Brother Brooks I told
[6:17] Brother C I said we can do a couple
[6:19] services but after that we get worn
[6:21] out but that's everybody right that's
[6:23] every church that's not just us that's
[6:25] everybody so no shame on us no shame on
[6:27] anybody just can't keep it up for
[6:29] you know you just do the best you
[6:32] can and so U I just thought I'd share
[6:34] that with you now I'm going to unplug
[6:36] here because I don't have any other
[6:38] notes really I just got a couple of
[6:39] visuals I do want to show eventually but
[6:42] I'll look at part six
[6:44] here by God's grace and I want to pick
[6:48] up right where I left off I left off
[6:49] with this quote from the church age book
[6:51] brother R said until God stops calling
[6:53] the Pentecostal message of power will
[6:56] not
[6:57] cease okay so there is no cease today
[7:00] even though maybe we haven't seen a dead
[7:02] person raised I've never seen a dead
[7:03] person raised we may not have seen a
[7:05] lame man walk we know the power though
[7:08] is still here amen we got to remind
[7:10] ourselves of that right we got to remind
[7:12] ourselves because so often we just get
[7:14] into the the routine of life that's why
[7:16] we constantly need Revival praise God
[7:18] Amen Revival every day I know about you
[7:21] but after that Sunday morning service I
[7:22] fell on a cloud n with faith I don't
[7:24] know I just but then by the afternoon
[7:26] come I was out of energy and I I was in
[7:29] trouble you know having the faith you uh
[7:32] but I really felt strong faith after
[7:34] that morning service I felt like it was
[7:36] anointing me uh to believe God's word
[7:39] and so I reached out to numerous people
[7:40] on my drive to get the food you know I
[7:41] was reaching out and sending words of
[7:43] encouragement I felt like while the
[7:45] anointings here I'm not going to be
[7:46] afraid I'm going to send I'm going to
[7:47] send these texts and messages amen and
[7:50] some of them were received by God's
[7:53] grace but we must keep that in mind the
[7:55] power doesn't cease you know I've shared
[7:57] different testimonies from different
[7:58] messages churches over the last few
[8:00] years you know leukemia healings and uh
[8:03] other other ministers testifying that um
[8:06] you know the lame have walked in their
[8:07] services children that couldn't walked
[8:09] can now walk in the message churches so
[8:12] uh that it goes around it happens by
[8:15] God's grace the power does not cease
[8:17] Hallelujah and we must be ready we must
[8:19] be willing as brother Samuel preached we
[8:21] must be willing and ready at any time to
[8:23] be the channel that God can use for that
[8:26] amen and where we've seen it is where
[8:28] we've seen it numerous times just
[8:30] speaking the word right speaking to the
[8:32] mountain that's where I've seen it you
[8:33] know numerous cases with sick people um
[8:36] or like with Brian Hawkins you know just
[8:38] you know he's got the degenerative hips
[8:40] and I just spoke it I said I'm speaking
[8:42] life into these hips in Jesus Christ's
[8:43] name I didn't know what I was doing I
[8:45] didn't know that hips couldn't
[8:46] regenerate I just was moved by the Holy
[8:48] Spirit to say that and then his doctor's
[8:51] like this has never happened before you
[8:52] know uh just Rejoice uh and so God's
[8:56] power is here we just want to be yielded
[8:58] to that power praise God and he says
[9:00] what the church brother said what the
[9:01] church had at Pentecost is her
[9:03] inalienable right so it's our right to
[9:06] have exactly what they had at Pentecost
[9:09] we could we can pray for that we can
[9:11] desire that we can know it's ours praise
[9:13] God am that's why I I I always try to
[9:17] never be encouraged I'll just keep
[9:18] coming back to church one of these
[9:20] Services is going to hit praise God
[9:23] never know when that's why you don't
[9:24] want to miss any hallelujah amen I want
[9:26] to be there when it happens by God's
[9:28] grace amen Hallelujah because God the
[9:30] wind blows and no one knows when it's
[9:32] coming except God knows when it's coming
[9:34] Hallelujah I just want to be in the
[9:36] right place at the right time I want to
[9:38] be able to say I was there when the
[9:39] spirit came
[9:42] Hallelujah I felt his power and I praise
[9:44] His name Hallelujah that's right but
[9:47] this is our right so that's why we keep
[9:48] coming back to God we keep praying we
[9:50] keep believing one of these times it's
[9:52] going to hit praise God God's power is
[9:54] going to the Bible said the power of God
[9:56] will be present to heal hallelujah amen
[9:59] and so brother Ram quotes this scripture
[10:01] Hebrews 2 1-4 therefore we ought to give
[10:05] the more Earnest heed to the things
[10:06] which we've heard lest at any time we
[10:08] should let them slip so see we can't let
[10:10] things slip too far out of our memory
[10:13] he's talking about the power of the Holy
[10:14] Ghost down the power we can't let the
[10:16] power slip out for if the word spoken by
[10:20] Angels was steadfast and every
[10:22] transgression and Disobedience to the
[10:23] word received a just recompense of
[10:26] reward how shall we escape if we neglect
[10:28] so great salvation which at the first
[10:31] began to be spoken by the Lord and was
[10:33] confirmed unto us by them that heard him
[10:36] God also bearing them witness both with
[10:38] signs and wonders and with diverse
[10:40] Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghost
[10:43] according to his own will there's the
[10:44] key right there his own will praise God
[10:47] Amen how many miracles did John the
[10:49] Baptist do zero it wasn't God's will how
[10:52] many miracles did Brother Ram do many
[10:54] more Hallelujah many many many right he
[10:57] said many that are even recording the
[10:59] Bible because there's not a lot recorded
[11:00] in the Bible compared to like a person's
[11:02] lifelong ministry right as far as number
[11:05] of recorded miracles in the
[11:07] Bible and so we can't let them slip in
[11:09] other words we can't let this great
[11:11] salvation we've got a great salvation we
[11:13] can't let that slip our minds like well
[11:15] I don't know if God can do this or I
[11:17] don't know if God can sa that person of
[11:18] course he can praise God but it's got to
[11:21] be according to God's Will and we can't
[11:23] let that slip we can't let it give up we
[11:25] got to keep trying right the church will
[11:27] always try to be like the book of Acts
[11:28] Church amen
[11:32] amen so brother ra says now I want to
[11:34] read something right after this here he
[11:37] says uh the original church was not
[11:40] organized by men it was led by the Holy
[11:43] Ghost it wasn't very big it was hated
[11:45] and despised it was oppressed it was
[11:48] persecuted unto death but it was true to
[11:50] God it stayed with the original word
[11:53] pattern that's what we looked at last
[11:54] week by God's grace we're doing
[11:56] everything in our power to stay true to
[11:58] this patter PN amen right but remember
[12:01] within the pattern there's room for
[12:03] Liberty so going back to Simon's example
[12:05] a Simon may have All These Blueprints
[12:07] I'll have to ask him about this when he
[12:09] gets back from Thailand but I imagine
[12:11] you know there's some Liberty in other
[12:12] words you could buy this brand of a pipe
[12:15] now what's the name brand of a pipe I
[12:16] don't know
[12:18] Johnson
[12:20] timkin probably not timkin but you know
[12:22] or maybe you can have a different
[12:24] quality of a pipe there there's liberty
[12:26] maybe you want a plastic cor maybe you
[12:27] want a a a stainless steel one maybe you
[12:31] want to Steel one you know but there's
[12:34] liberty within the blueprint and I'm not
[12:36] I didn't forget the one I'm going to
[12:37] share with you on Sunday night I'm going
[12:38] to share that one with you I didn't
[12:39] share there's something I couldn't
[12:40] really T teach on well maybe I'll just
[12:43] share it brly I just share broadly here
[12:45] then we'll talk about it Sunday night
[12:47] and my wife's looking at me you better
[12:48] be careful what you say I'm like I'm
[12:50] gonna
[12:53] try I'll just share like this I'll share
[12:55] it more broadly um when a pastor's wife
[12:59] dies should that Pastor keep preaching
[13:01] because now he's not the husband of one
[13:02] wife
[13:04] anymore right it just happens in the
[13:06] message often you know preachers get
[13:08] older okay how about if a preacher How
[13:11] about if he's faithful to God but his
[13:13] wife leaves him and divorces should he
[13:15] continue
[13:16] preaching see we'll talk about that on
[13:18] Sunday night because remember there
[13:21] brother said brother was a pastor yet he
[13:23] didn't have a wife and children remember
[13:25] that see makes us all quiet start
[13:28] thinking what would I do if I good thing
[13:30] I'm not in that
[13:31] situation that's what I say good thing
[13:33] I'm not in this
[13:34] situation he said now don't get L astray
[13:37] here when I said that God and his ways
[13:39] never changed this is brother brandom I
[13:41] did not say that the church and its
[13:42] Messengers could not
[13:45] change the church isn't
[13:49] God the church is in
[13:51] God said so she can change but what I
[13:54] said was that because of the unchanging
[13:56] God and with unchanging ways we can go
[13:58] back back to the beginning and see what
[14:00] the first and perfect ACT of God was and
[14:03] then judge by that standard he said that
[14:06] is how it's done the true church will
[14:08] always try to be like the original one
[14:10] at Pentecost the true church of today
[14:12] will try to approximate that early first
[14:15] one amen hallelujah so
[14:18] see as soon as Ephesus fell remember
[14:20] Ephesus left the first love it's the
[14:22] first church age and after that they
[14:24] kept losing Revelation losing Revelation
[14:26] to the fourth Church age and then the
[14:28] fifth Church age God started restoring
[14:30] justification by faith amen but remember
[14:33] Church even John Wesley was a
[14:35] trinitarian right right he was still a
[14:37] TR it wasn't until this age these last
[14:40] 117 or 18 years now that we got the
[14:43] revelation of the godhead back we got
[14:45] the right water baptism back God is
[14:47] restoring we're in the midst of God
[14:48] restoring and we're thankful to be a
[14:50] part of it praise
[14:52] God God is restored now each one of
[14:55] those men had joh John Wesley Martin
[14:57] Luther had Mighty mer mirales of healing
[14:59] and Supernatural praise God and so did
[15:01] brother Brandon praise God if you look
[15:04] at your life you'll see miracles in your
[15:05] life too praise God but remember it does
[15:08] not cease we cannot get complacent we
[15:10] got to keep the revival going hallelujah
[15:12] amen you can't let the supernatural slip
[15:14] we got to always believe in that praise
[15:16] God we've always got to pray for it
[15:18] Hallelujah and be willing to cry out to
[15:21] God for more of it praise God Amen now
[15:24] um now why I say this I want to read
[15:26] that quote I read last week it's from
[15:27] questions answer part three 1964 they
[15:31] asked brother brandom uh about do we
[15:33] have to come to the church for
[15:34] perfecting in other words do we have to
[15:36] come to Bram Tabernacle to be perfected
[15:38] brother said no they want to come here
[15:40] to the church for the perfecting no we
[15:42] get Fellowship one with another here at
[15:43] the church but the perfecting comes
[15:45] between us and God now I made a video
[15:48] about this in if you if you go back and
[15:51] listen to the whole quote brother R's
[15:52] talking to a man who thinks he has to
[15:54] move from Spokane Washington to
[15:56] Jefferson vill indana to be perfected
[15:58] and brother trying to tell him you don't
[15:59] have to move here to be perfected in
[16:02] other words you don't have to be around
[16:03] the prophet to be perfected Hallelujah
[16:06] you don't have to now it's going to help
[16:08] you yes there are benefits to being
[16:09] around a prophet right if you're a
[16:12] friend of a prophet you get a prophet's
[16:14] reward praise God that's what the Bible
[16:16] says there's many rewards to being a
[16:19] prophet but um but in this case or to
[16:22] being associated with the prophet but in
[16:23] this case brother Ram's kind of
[16:25] discerning and saying uh this church you
[16:27] know uh you don't get perfected just by
[16:29] coming to this church you get fellowship
[16:31] at the church but the real perfecting
[16:33] notice he says between you and Christ
[16:34] not between you and
[16:36] me amen right so see how he's already
[16:40] batt that tape Church movement I mean
[16:41] course it was always there R called it a
[16:43] serpent in 1961 he called it a devil he
[16:45] called it a a demon serpent that spirit
[16:48] that would worship brother
[16:50] Bradon he says the blood of Christ is
[16:53] what perfects Us in the Holy
[16:56] Spirit he said now he said the church
[16:59] says he says the church has the gifts
[17:00] operating now no this is brother's exact
[17:03] quote now we do not have too many gifts
[17:06] operating here but we have some of them
[17:09] I'm going to read it again we do not
[17:11] have too many gifts uh operating here
[17:13] but we have some of them this is in 1964
[17:16] a year before he goes off the
[17:18] scene we have gift of tongues and the
[17:21] gift of prophecy two or three of them
[17:23] end
[17:24] quote okay so see sometimes we got to be
[17:26] careful not to put tooo much emphasis on
[17:28] gifts but at the same time gifts can't
[17:30] be our absolute but at the same time we
[17:32] can't let them
[17:33] slip so what we got to do we got to find
[17:35] that middle of the road amen I'm not
[17:38] lost if I don't have a gift or I can't
[17:39] make a gift happen I'm not lost if I
[17:41] don't have gifts but at the same time I
[17:43] can't forget about them I've got to
[17:45] always believe in them I got to know
[17:47] that God's Powers not cease
[17:49] Hallelujah and like brother said brother
[17:52] said power comes with sincerity and we
[17:55] got to look at our lives and say perhaps
[17:57] we're not seeing more gifts because
[17:58] we're not as sincere as we could be
[17:59] praise God right it's just something
[18:02] it's just something like a cycle it's a
[18:04] cycle of
[18:05] Revival from time to time we got to go
[18:07] back and say am I being sincere enough
[18:09] and I got to ask myself that almost
[18:10] every service praise God so do you are
[18:12] we are we sincere enough so it it's not
[18:15] a Salvation issue or I'm not a saved
[18:17] issue about the gifts because brother R
[18:19] doesn't even have all nine of them and
[18:21] this is the this is the year before he
[18:23] goes off the scene and remember God
[18:25] couldn't God wouldn't take him till God
[18:26] was done with him right right right so
[18:30] we don't want to put too much emphasis
[18:31] on the gifts and we don't want to make
[18:33] certain quotes about gifts thus say the
[18:35] Lord if they're not thus say the Lord
[18:38] hallelujah but we cannot let them slip
[18:40] praise God hallelujah we cannot let the
[18:43] gift slip which means we got to stay
[18:45] true to God hallelujah uh we got to have
[18:48] faith we got to have faith building
[18:49] messages amen hallelujah that's what I
[18:53] need help with too and I'm sure all of
[18:54] us want to have faith building messages
[18:56] hallelujah amen I think these ser about
[18:58] the book of Acts should build our faith
[19:00] don't you am if he's the same yesterday
[19:03] today and forever then the book of Acts
[19:04] is still going on praise God am
[19:07] sometimes we got to shake ourselves
[19:08] remember the book of Acts is still going
[19:10] on I'm you and I are a continuation of
[19:13] the book of Acts hallelujah amen that's
[19:17] right
[19:20] Hallelujah I mean uh it's this the
[19:22] thought just came to me it just it was
[19:23] just so clear uh two things I want to
[19:26] share about
[19:27] Guyana
[19:28] especially when I get went to Ghana when
[19:30] I went to Ghana we went out and preached
[19:32] on the street twice just we went right
[19:34] to this open Village it looked like a
[19:35] bunch
[19:36] of I hate to say it but it looks like
[19:38] their houses look like a bunch of
[19:39] chicken coops that's how small their
[19:41] houses were we just set up we just
[19:44] plugged in some electricity set up a mic
[19:46] and I had this thought come to me and I
[19:48] was going to and all as we drove through
[19:49] Guyana all I saw was all these Buddhist
[19:52] temples and so the scripture come to me
[19:54] act 17 you have all these Gods but you
[19:58] did the the god that you worship you
[19:59] don't even know there's an unknown God
[20:00] his name is Jesus Christ and church
[20:02] God's my witness I'm holding my iPad
[20:04] preaching
[20:05] that and while I'm preaching that people
[20:07] are getting uh I'm feeling led by the
[20:09] Holy Spirit and all of a sudden this
[20:11] demon-possessed man I didn't realize it
[20:12] was demon possessed man until later he
[20:14] said why do you keep looking at your
[20:15] notes preacher and I just kind of
[20:17] ignored him you know because I just I
[20:18] look at my notes I don't have my sermons
[20:21] memorized I wish I had that gift but I
[20:23] don't stand the mirror like some
[20:24] preachers in practice like you know uh
[20:28] like Joe olol he practices how he's
[20:29] going to say everything I'll practice
[20:32] Saturday night so I can memorize it to
[20:33] the people I don't want to scripted
[20:35] sermon like that I want a holy ghost
[20:37] anointed sermon praise God there's
[20:39] nothing I guess there's nothing wrong
[20:40] with that I'm not trying to be critical
[20:41] but but look you know you don't preach
[20:43] against homosexuality and lets women
[20:45] preach and everything like that wears
[20:46] makeup when he preaches a man wearing
[20:48] makeup come on goodness gracious you
[20:50] would think you would think people would
[20:52] see
[20:54] it but he kept battling me he kept
[20:56] battling me I just kind of I was just
[20:58] young in the faith I wish I would have
[20:59] been a little older amen I just would
[21:00] have rebuked I would have rebuked him in
[21:01] the name of Jesus Christ but he just
[21:03] badgered me the whole service and after
[21:06] that a couple people come up for prayer
[21:08] the next Sunday people came from that
[21:10] and got baptized I was already gone but
[21:13] brother Max said one or two I think a
[21:15] family or one or two people come in and
[21:16] got baptized from that Outreach service
[21:18] there but that was showing me that was
[21:20] like a real clipse in the book of Acts
[21:22] we're bringing the gospel to a a town
[21:25] that never heard it before and what is
[21:27] there Sayan is always rising up trying
[21:29] to criticize preachers just like that
[21:31] demon possessed woman that was going
[21:32] after Paul these men are the preachers
[21:34] of Salvation these men are the Real Men
[21:36] of God and they're uh making fun of me
[21:39] because I'm looking at my notes well
[21:40] I'll don't know what to do next time if
[21:41] the Holy Spirit reminds me Hallelujah
[21:43] I'll rebuke that Spirit Jesus even read
[21:45] the Bible one time he looked down at his
[21:46] notes and he read Isaiah it wasn't notes
[21:49] it was just the
[21:50] scripture and the other thing was you
[21:53] know it was very easy for me to see in
[21:55] Guyana that I was a part of the book of
[21:56] Acts Church
[21:59] you know sometimes you know it was hard
[22:00] on my wife and it was hard on me mostly
[22:02] hard on her but I'd be gone sometimes 12
[22:03] or 13 days but during that time I got
[22:06] really built up on
[22:08] faith and one time that that first trip
[22:10] I went although I was all bid up with
[22:13] mosquitoes all my legs were covered in
[22:16] red dots all the why they sure got my I
[22:18] slept in a net that was trying to keep
[22:19] the mosquitoes out it's almost like the
[22:21] net let the mosquitoes
[22:22] in anyway I was so moved by the Holy
[22:26] Spirit something struck me I'm preaching
[22:27] all these young people and I said I
[22:30] don't know it was just on a it was like
[22:32] on a Saturday morning I'm preaching
[22:33] right by the lake and there's all these
[22:34] young people sitting there in chairs and
[22:36] the boldness of the Holy Spirit Come on
[22:38] me and I said if God doesn't vindicate
[22:39] this message then I'm a false
[22:42] preacher that's quite a
[22:44] statement I didn't know how God was
[22:45] going to vindicate it but I saw by the
[22:47] end I said all these all these young
[22:49] people had never been baptized and I
[22:51] said if you want to be baptized if you
[22:52] want to be saved I just I just realized
[22:54] it right at the end I said you you come
[22:56] down to the water I said I'll be the the
[22:58] first one to run down there and a line
[23:01] of young people maybe 10 15 I always
[23:03] exaggerate so just bear with me maybe 10
[23:06] 20 30 but I remember the last one that
[23:08] come up was the pastor
[23:10] son he's a young teenager at that
[23:13] point and he come up I said brother I
[23:16] said I'm not going to baptize your son
[23:17] you baptize your son Hallelujah
[23:20] Nathaniel what's his name and we buried
[23:22] in the name of Jesus Christ we're all
[23:23] shouting rejoicing I go for a little
[23:25] swim afterwards in my full suit I have
[23:27] my full suit on
[23:29] I got sand all over my suat but it was
[23:31] work it was 95 degrees you know but it
[23:34] was so clear demons fighting us people
[23:37] getting saved and then the boldness to
[23:39] speak God's word and instantly let's say
[23:41] 10 or 20 people baptize in the name of
[23:44] Jesus Christ it's easy to see in that
[23:47] place but sometimes it gets hard when we
[23:49] when our lives become common here in the
[23:51] United
[23:52] States and so we can't let things become
[23:54] common we got to remember the power
[23:56] doesn't cease
[23:58] God doesn't change but sometimes the
[24:00] church changes if we change for the
[24:01] worst we got to Humble ourselves and and
[24:03] change and get back to the better praise
[24:05] God Amen Hallelujah now this is why I
[24:08] didn't get to last week I want to say
[24:09] this as
[24:10] well we are in the process of
[24:14] restoration and God has greatly restored
[24:16] our church remember the uh I I listened
[24:20] in my book there's 14 doctrines that we
[24:22] have that are restored to us that almost
[24:25] no other church has so I'm going to run
[24:27] through real quickly how many remember
[24:28] the 14 how many remember as you as I go
[24:31] you remember uh we condemn homosexual
[24:34] relationships that's what Paul
[24:36] did
[24:37] right second we condemn
[24:41] adulteries right and couples being
[24:44] married more than once like I said
[24:45] almost almost every one of my aunts and
[24:47] uncles is married two times maybe more
[24:50] third we condemn
[24:52] fornication right a lot of churches they
[24:54] celebrate when people live together
[24:55] before they're married we've seen it
[24:57] we've went to wedding like that one
[24:59] time third murder right people murder
[25:02] through a uh birth control pills they
[25:05] murder babies oh it's okay to take birth
[25:07] control bills if you want to be a
[25:08] murderer it's okay but it's not okay
[25:10] with
[25:11] God fifth women preachers now most
[25:14] churches have women
[25:16] preachers six substance abuse right the
[25:19] Bible says if you're not holy you will
[25:21] not see God right but most most churches
[25:24] let you drink especially drink they'll
[25:26] let you drink or smoke uh casual drink
[25:28] has just become the social Norm
[25:30] now everybody goes out to drink and they
[25:34] think they can Witness by drinking now
[25:35] that's not what Jesus did Jesus had a
[25:38] water down line right because the water
[25:41] was not healthy to drink remember that
[25:43] to okay eight viewing sinful movies and
[25:47] television shows yet Paul says avoid all
[25:49] appearance of evil n they have shameful
[25:53] hair lengths now that's almost every
[25:54] single
[25:55] church right remember it's a shame
[25:58] it's a shame for a woman to cut her hair
[25:59] it's a shame for a man to have long
[26:03] hair uh next is false conversions they
[26:06] say you're converted uh and you're
[26:09] filled with the Holy Ghost just when you
[26:10] say a scripted sinner's
[26:13] prayer in modest clothing that's almost
[26:15] every Church how many feel pretty
[26:18] restored now feel pretty good Hallelujah
[26:21] I'm only at uh I'm only at 10 I've only
[26:24] gone through 10 I'm feeling pretty clean
[26:26] up here by God's grace
[26:28] Hallelujah I ought to be because I've
[26:30] been washed By the Waters of the word
[26:32] amen hallelujah I ought to feel clean
[26:35] tonight
[26:36] Hallelujah 11th water baptisms are done
[26:39] in the literal name of Jesus
[26:42] Christ uh 12 Believers are taught to
[26:45] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[26:46] their soul so
[26:48] Soul Hallelujah and there's three works
[26:51] of Grace 13 God is one person not three
[26:56] persons and 14
[26:58] 14 uh the supernatural power currently
[27:01] operates all nine gifts of the Holy
[27:03] Ghost any church outside of a
[27:05] Pentecostal Church doesn't believe
[27:07] that right a lot of churches don't even
[27:09] believe in the five-fold ministry now
[27:11] there's 14 Pauline gospels I'm sorry
[27:14] Pauline doctrines most churches don't
[27:17] have but you and I got it we're restored
[27:20] amen Church believe it you are a part
[27:22] you are a continuation of the book of
[27:24] Acts hallelujah praise God
[27:29] and then the 15th one is not in the New
[27:31] Testament necessarily but men and women
[27:33] wear separate
[27:34] garments right Jesus wore men's garments
[27:36] not women's garments so we would imagine
[27:38] that would continue in the New Testament
[27:41] hallelujah it's an Abomination for a man
[27:44] to wear a woman's garment and so
[27:46] forth Hallelujah so there's 15 right
[27:49] there so we are part of the
[27:51] restored book of Acts Church Hallelujah
[27:54] that's what Jesus said in Matthew 17:11
[27:56] Elijah will come and restore all things
[27:58] Joel 2
[28:00] 23-26 I'll restore sayeth the Lord amen
[28:03] hallelujah amen thank God Hallelujah so
[28:06] in at least these 14 ways and I'd
[28:08] imagine there's more than that I'm for
[28:11] sure there's more than that but that's
[28:13] what I had time to study off or study on
[28:15] when I wrote that book there by God's
[28:17] grace Hallelujah because what about uh
[28:20] what about feeding the poor not all
[28:21] churches do that some Churches don't
[28:23] even care about the
[28:24] poor but God sees you when you help out
[28:26] the poor
[28:28] amen we've helped people get cars in our
[28:30] church numerous people right how many
[28:34] churches do
[28:36] that so Church you know praying and
[28:38] fasting how many churches do that we're
[28:41] more like the book of Acts Church than
[28:43] what we
[28:44] think
[28:46] hallelujah amen glory all right now
[28:49] that's my little introduction
[28:52] there Hallelujah now let's go to Acts
[28:55] chapter
[28:56] 6
[28:59] that's why I didn't finish from last
[29:00] week I
[29:04] finish whenever I have questions church
[29:06] I always go back to that we have at
[29:08] least 14 whenever mind battles you know
[29:11] something wrong with the church or
[29:12] something wrong with me I always go back
[29:14] to that we are part of the restored book
[29:16] of Acts church amen hallelujah and
[29:19] church many of those I shouldn't say
[29:20] many but maybe half of those 14 or 15 we
[29:23] have thus say the Lord
[29:25] on so we have the gift of prop
[29:27] we have the voice of the Holy Spirit
[29:29] Plus the Bible Prophet Bible you know we
[29:33] have thus sayith the Lord so what do you
[29:35] resting your soul on I'm resting my soul
[29:37] on the word of God
[29:39] hallelujah
[29:42] hallelujah okay so Acts chapter 6 now we
[29:44] I want to just uh pick up where Stephen
[29:47] gets uh accused now in verse 13 acts 613
[29:51] he gets some false Witnesses against him
[29:53] then verse 14 for we have heard him say
[29:55] that Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy
[29:56] this place place and shall change the
[29:58] Customs which Moses delivered
[30:01] us hallelujah now I don't know what
[30:03] Steven said about that but uh Jesus did
[30:06] say all these stones will be thrown down
[30:09] did he not what was he prophesying 40
[30:12] years Titus is coming and not one stone
[30:15] will be left on
[30:16] another but see they took this as an
[30:18] attack they took prophecy as an attack
[30:21] against them well it was a rebuke
[30:23] against them but they took it as a
[30:26] personal attack against them and did
[30:29] Jesus change the customs of Moses did he
[30:31] change them absolutely he fulfilled them
[30:34] all right cuz he never sinned and then
[30:36] he changed them through St Paul and the
[30:38] church said right Paul said you no
[30:40] longer got to do
[30:42] circumcision right no longer got to eat
[30:45] meat on these certain days and abstain
[30:46] and all this all this ceremonial things
[30:49] no longer got to do that I'm changing
[30:51] Moses's Customs amen hallelujah amen was
[30:54] he was Stephen right he was absolutely
[30:56] right Hallelujah there were some things
[30:59] that were going continue that was in
[31:00] Acts chapter 15 remember those four
[31:02] things you know eating blood we went
[31:03] through that uh fornication strangled
[31:06] things I can never remember the fourth
[31:07] one I always forget the fourth one
[31:08] anybody
[31:09] remember no it's okay I I didn't expect
[31:11] anybody to remember I could always
[31:13] forget that fourth
[31:14] one
[31:16] um and so all these things were true but
[31:19] they took it as an attack and church
[31:21] that's what's going to happen to America
[31:22] all the things we're preaching they're
[31:24] going to hate us for and they're going
[31:26] to want to kill americ
[31:27] that's what the Bible says Revelation 13
[31:31] they're going to kill anyone who doesn't
[31:33] take the Mark is that right you can see
[31:35] it now how they already hate
[31:37] conservatives talk about the government
[31:39] the US government they're already
[31:40] jailing conservatives and they'll let uh
[31:43] liberals do way more than what the
[31:45] conservatives did and they don't even
[31:47] get
[31:48] charged right so we can see it's in the
[31:52] process may God give us Grace
[31:54] Hallelujah as we heard not to fear here
[31:57] but to be ready praise God the bride has
[32:00] made herself ready amen that's right we
[32:02] got to make ready by the word of
[32:05] God and all that sat in the counsil
[32:07] looked steadfastly on him saw his face
[32:10] as it had been the face of an Angel
[32:13] Hallelujah he was so much like Christ he
[32:16] looked like he'd been with
[32:18] Christ literally in with a theop body
[32:22] now chapter 7 verse
[32:26] one
[32:28] then the high priest I'm sorry then said
[32:30] the high priest are these things so and
[32:32] he said men and Brethren and fathers
[32:34] hearken now I like this does Stephen
[32:37] address or I'm sorry does Stephen
[32:38] directly answer this question
[32:41] no no said are these things so he says
[32:45] men and Brethren let me talk to you
[32:47] little bit remember brother said Stephen
[32:49] was not a
[32:50] preacher
[32:52] Hallelujah brother Ram says Stephen A
[32:54] Man full of the Holy Ghost this is from
[32:55] 1953 Resurrection
[32:57] the Bible said how could you stop him
[32:59] why he was like a house on fire in dry
[33:02] weather on a windy
[33:05] day I don't know if the girls remember
[33:07] but we had some pretty good fires on
[33:08] some windy days right it almost got the
[33:11] tree almost the peach tree almost got
[33:12] caught on
[33:13] fire my wife's looking at me again like
[33:15] I shouldn't have done
[33:16] that that's my fault I didn't realize
[33:20] how dry it was but brother R said that's
[33:22] what Stephen was like he was on fire and
[33:25] the Winds of the holy spirit amen we're
[33:27] blowing making it more bold all the time
[33:29] hallelujah amen glory that's what they
[33:32] prayed for after they first got the Holy
[33:34] Ghost they got some discouragement what
[33:35] did they pray for more boldness praise
[33:37] God Amen what does God want for us for
[33:40] you and I to be bold with the word of
[33:42] God
[33:44] Amen I started carrying these in my
[33:46] pocket on Monday uh I I kept asking Lord
[33:51] you know I figured out I I I felt the
[33:53] Holy Spirit gave me that question these
[33:54] are my books and I I I'm trying to be
[33:56] more
[33:57] bold I haven't had opportunity but my
[34:00] desire is when I see somebody and they
[34:01] make eye contact and say hi I want to
[34:03] say hey I got a question for I've done
[34:05] this before I just haven't done it
[34:06] lately but I want to be more bold I want
[34:08] to say do you know anybody wants to read
[34:10] a book about Jesus and then I can give
[34:11] them this if they say yes if not then
[34:14] that they'll be judged on the day of
[34:15] judgment they didn't want to read about
[34:16] Jesus so it's a great it's a great
[34:18] question right but I've had them in my
[34:21] pocket all week I just haven't ran into
[34:22] anybody yet so I guess I need to spend
[34:24] more time out in public but I want to be
[34:27] more bold because Stephen was bold he
[34:30] was like a dry stick on a windy day on
[34:33] fire hallelujah amen brother said why
[34:37] you couldn't put him out if you had
[34:39] to hallelujah amen only way they could
[34:42] stop him was to kill
[34:44] him he was full of the Holy Ghost he
[34:47] wasn't no preacher he was just a deacon
[34:50] just a deacon yeah he's a man full of
[34:52] Miracle so we know he wasn't just a
[34:54] deacon right and I know brother didn't
[34:56] mean it that that way but I want you to
[34:58] remember this let's respect this man
[34:59] this was a mighty man of
[35:01] Faith he was out on the street
[35:04] testifying in glorifying God they
[35:05] couldn't stop him the Holy Ghost had so
[35:07] wrapped him up till he wasn't his own he
[35:10] only looked through God's eyes he only
[35:11] seen what God seen he only acted on what
[35:14] God
[35:16] Said and he said verse Two Men and
[35:18] Brethren fathers hearken the god of
[35:20] Glory appeared unto our Father Abraham
[35:22] when he was in Mesopotamia before he
[35:25] dwelt in Cher
[35:27] and said to him get thee out of thy
[35:29] country and from thy Kindred and come
[35:30] into the land which I will show thee
[35:33] remember church he left not knowing
[35:35] where he was
[35:37] going so don't feel discouraged if you
[35:39] kind of you have an idea what God wants
[35:41] you to do but you don't know all the
[35:42] details don't feel discouraged be
[35:44] encouraged you're a child of
[35:46] Abraham remember the Bible said you walk
[35:49] in the steps of faithful Abraham praise
[35:51] God the main thing to do is leave where
[35:53] you were at praise
[35:54] God act upon God's word do what the
[35:58] Bible says hallelujah amen leave your
[36:00] old sinful life behind leave that all
[36:02] behind and follow Jesus hallelujah amen

[36:07] weekend I went to this uh game I got to
[36:09] go to the game uh with my friends and my
[36:11] mom I got to tell numerous friends I
[36:13] said I was like Abraham God called me
[36:15] away from my family to be a preacher to
[36:18] feed God's people in a I I got to tell
[36:20] all of them I said these games don't
[36:22] matter what matters is serving Jesus
[36:25] Christ they said how you feel being
[36:27] around the games you miss the games I'm
[36:28] like well yeah I miss them but it all
[36:30] passes away and pretty soon all that's
[36:32] left is your life and your walk with God
[36:35] and that's the main thing your walk with
[36:37] Christ praise God
[36:41] hallelujah so like
[36:43] Abraham verse uh
[36:47] four yeah then came he out of the land
[36:49] of the Chans and dwelt in cheron and
[36:51] from then when his father was dead he
[36:52] removed him into this land wherein you
[36:54] now dwell and he gave him none other
[36:56] inheritance didn't know not so much as
[36:57] to set his foot on yet he promised that
[37:00] he would give it to him for a possession
[37:02] and to a seed after him when he was yet
[37:04] had no child look at that God promised
[37:06] him all this land but did he get any of
[37:08] it not much of
[37:10] it see God might make you all these
[37:12] promises you might not get it though to
[37:14] the other side oh and I don't care I
[37:17] don't care if I get it now I just want
[37:19] it in the Millennium praise God
[37:21] hallelujah I don't care how much land I
[37:23] get here I don't have a full acre land
[37:26] yeah but it don't even matter what
[37:28] matters is God has promised us great
[37:30] rewards great blessings if we follow his
[37:33] leadership praise God if we walk like
[37:36] Abraham walked walking lives of Faith
[37:39] hallelujah
[37:42] amen
[37:44] glory look at that verse five he didn't
[37:46] have he have none of it but yet God
[37:47] promised it to him remember the Bible
[37:50] said in Hebrews 11 many of them died not
[37:52] receiving the promise did God lie nope
[37:55] God's got a better revelation of it for
[37:56] you amen God's got a better
[37:59] understanding of This Promise than you
[38:00] have of it Hallelujah that's right verse
[38:05] six and God spake on this wise that his
[38:07] seed should sojourn in a Strange Land
[38:09] and that they should bring him into
[38:10] bondage and in treat them evil 400 years
[38:13] now I've said this before but imagine
[38:15] within that 400 years what if you were
[38:17] one of the generations that didn't see

[48:12] still a continuation of the book of Acts
[48:14] hallelujah
[48:15] amen now hath not my hand made all these
[48:22] things now so we have this uh this this
[48:24] truth
[48:26] Solomon built him a house and of course
[48:28] David did before Moses did but God can't
[48:30] be contained in a
[48:33] house
[48:34] right he says the heaven is my Throne
[48:37] Earth is my foot what house will you
[48:39] build me Hallelujah so this you know go
[48:43] just creation is just a small thing god
[48:45] holds all creation think of all the
[48:47] trillions and billions of stars and
[48:48] planets we went over a couple years ago
[48:50] all that just he holds that in his
[48:53] hand Hallelujah he's so great
[48:56] verse 51 ye stiff NE and uncircumcised
[49:00] in heart and ears you do always resist
[49:02] the Holy Ghost that's what brother Ben
[49:04] was rebuking people that won't say
[49:07] Amen people that won't raise their hands
[49:09] in worship he said people that will fall
[49:12] asleep in the service right I thought
[49:14] you preach it brother
[49:16] Ben preach it brother and we got him
[49:18] coming maybe he'll preach that us
[49:21] hopefully we don't need it you know but
[49:23] people will sit back and they won't get
[49:25] into the spirit you come here to get in
[49:27] God's
[49:28] spirit I come here to be moved by God
[49:31] hallelujah I don't know everything I'm
[49:32] going to say I want to be open so God
[49:34] can use me to speak his
[49:37] word see if people don't worship if they
[49:40] don't really worship if they don't
[49:42] really pray if they don't say Amen
[49:43] you're resisting the Holy Spirit and we
[49:46] don't want that right we want to welcome
[49:49] the Holy Spirit yes amen but it's each
[49:52] each each person's individual choice
[49:56] yes now in this case the Pharisees were
[49:59] stiff necked and uncircumcised in both
[50:02] heart and ears they still had hearts of
[50:05] stone to the gospel amen hallelujah and
[50:09] ears they couldn't hear they they didn't
[50:11] have uh the eyes of Isa didn't have ears
[50:14] that could hear and they always resisted
[50:17] the Holy Ghost what was the Holy Ghost
[50:18] trying to say there's been a transition
[50:21] from Moses to Jesus amen hallelujah
[50:24] there's a transition
[50:26] Hallelujah and they couldn't see it they
[50:29] resisted the transition now look they
[50:31] stayed in their old way of life we can't
[50:34] stay in an old way of life we got to
[50:36] accept God's new way of life
[50:38] Hallelujah we got to accept New Life

[52:54] rejoice before the Lord praise God Amen
[52:57] AR the history of you lay hands on the
[52:59] sick and they shall recover praise God
[53:03] Amen but the holy spirit says you're
[53:05] stiff
[53:06] necked uncircumcised and Harden ears you
[53:09] always resist the Holy Ghost the Holy
[53:11] Ghost Stephen was testified
[53:13] about the Holy Ghost uh that would uh
[53:17] feed the widows the Christian
[53:19] widows everything the the holy ghost
[53:22] that healed the lame man they resist to
[53:25] that and it was a
[53:28] sin he said then yet they have slain
[53:31] them which showed before of the coming
[53:33] of the just one of whom you have now
[53:35] been betrayers and murderers who have
[53:39] received the law by the disposition of
[53:40] angels and have not kept think about
[53:42] that their ancestors had got the word
[53:44] from Angels but now they're filled with
[53:48] Devils right it's it only been 1500
[53:51] years since Moses in 1500 years they
[53:54] went from angels to
[53:56] devils and the Holy Ghost told them
[53:58] exactly what they were see I I look and
[54:01] see what preachers say about us when
[54:03] they come and it always comes out good
[54:05] that we're serving God
[54:07] Amen because I come here I say Lord if
[54:09] we need to rebuke give me a rebie and
[54:12] the church said amen Lord if I need
[54:14] encouragement give me encouragement amen
[54:17] if I need healing give me healing amen
[54:20] boldness he whatever whatever it is if I
[54:22] need boldness if I need uh sincerity
[54:24] whatever I need just give it to me Lord
[54:27] amen see the Holy Ghost won't hold it
[54:30] back rebuke if we need
[54:32] one
[54:36] Hallelujah he
[54:38] says so they went from angels to being
[54:41] filled with demons went from Holy Angels
[54:44] to Fallen
[54:47] Angels now church this had to have cut
[54:49] them the Bible said cut them to the
[54:51] heart why because they knew Deuteronomy
[54:52] 10:16 circumcised therefore the foreskin
[54:55] of your
[54:56] heart Moses had already told him ain't
[54:59] that something they say we're relying on
[55:02] Moses and then he quotes Moses your own
[55:05] Prophet said this we can do the same
[55:08] thing all these tape worshippers but
[55:09] your Prophet said Perfection comes with
[55:11] the fivefold
[55:13] ministry that's what the Bible says
[55:16] hallelujah amen I mean how many how many
[55:19] times with all their 24 lies we can
[55:22] always go back and said but the prophet
[55:23] said this right right praise God and so
[55:28] we know if they don't repent they'll be
[55:29] judged by the very Prophet that they
[55:31] said they believe didn't Jesus say that
[55:33] Moses will judge
[55:35] you that's why we really got to do what
[55:37] brother Ram said as long as it lines up
[55:39] in the Bible let's do what brother Ram
[55:41] said amen because it's the Bible truth
[55:43] hallelujah am it's a Bible
[55:47] Foundation see the the Pharisees were
[55:50] condemned by Moses because they didn't
[55:52] really believe Moses's word
[55:55] because Moses wrote of Jesus amen that's
[55:59] right
[56:01] Hallelujah didn't they know uh
[56:02] Deuteronomy 30:6 and the Lord thy God
[56:05] will circumcise thine heart and the
[56:07] Heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy
[56:09] God with all thy heart and with all thy
[56:11] soul and with that thou mayest live so
[56:14] see when God circumcises your heart you
[56:17] love the Lord amen more than money amen
[56:21] hallelujah more than
[56:23] popularity God circumcised your heart
[56:26] you love God see you get a circumcised
[56:28] heart then you love God you don't love
[56:30] the things of the world you love being a
[56:32] Christian amen amen amen thank God and
[56:36] not and Stephen said it right to them
[56:38] these are the very scriptures you say
[56:39] you
[56:40] believe and they didn't believe
[56:43] him Jeremiah 4:3 said for thus sayith
[56:46] the Lord to the men of Judah and
[56:48] Jerusalem break up the follow ground and
[56:50] so not among Thorns see that's Thorns
[56:51] were cares of the world remember that
[56:54] the thir the Third
[56:55] ground you can't have thorns in your
[56:58] heart and expect God's word to bring
[57:00] forth of its fruit amen it chokes it out
[57:03] there's not enough room for the world
[57:05] and God's word we got to have only God's
[57:07] word circumcise yourselves to the Lord
[57:11] and take away the foreskin of your heart
[57:14] ye men of Judah inhabitants of Jerusalem
[57:16] lest my Fury come forth like fire and
[57:19] burn that none can quch it because of
[57:21] the evil of your doings Hallelujah
[57:25] Church we've seen numerous testimonies
[57:27] I've shared some of them if these
[57:28] message people don't repent of their
[57:29] pride they're going to get burned with
[57:31] fire right yes even denominational right
[57:35] whoever it is if they don't keep God's
[57:37] word God will rebuke them that's a good
[57:41] sign God loves him amen
[57:44] hallelujah Romans uh 2:29 honey Romans
[57:47] 229 I'm almost almost at my hour this
[57:49] says I got two more minutes I got two
[57:52] minutes maybe I need some overtime
[57:58] see but he's a Jew which is won inwardly
[58:01] and circumcision is that of the heart
[58:03] and the spirit and not in the letter
[58:05] whose praise is not of men but of God
[58:09] now we're not Jews but spiritual Jew is
[58:12] just a term it just means I'm a real
[58:15] spiritual Seed of Abraham that's all it
[58:16] means amen amen in one way the Gentiles
[58:20] replace the Jews as the bride but it's
[58:22] not the full replacement where God's
[58:24] done the Jews God's still going to have
[58:26] a Jewish people saved that's right so
[58:29] there there's some there's some
[58:30] preachers that say not in the message
[58:31] but there's preachers that's called the
[58:32] replacement theology like Gentiles
[58:35] totally rep replace the Jews and the
[58:36] Jews are no longer saved that's not it
[58:38] that's not what that verse is
[58:40] saying it just saying it just says the
[58:42] real believer that is a real Seed of
[58:45] Abraham doesn't just have a natural
[58:46] circumcision it's a spiritual
[58:48] circumcision amen and there's been a
[58:51] permanent surgery in their soul praise
[58:53] God hallelujah amen the Holy Ghost had
[58:55] is a sharp sword brother amen and it
[58:57] cuts away all those old habits and you

[59:15] now I want to
[59:17] uh look at this thought here now verse
[59:21] 54 when they heard these things they
[59:23] were cut to the heart and they nashed on
[59:24] him with their teeth I'll tell you want
[59:25] to get a message person mad that's got a
[59:28] wrong Spirit show them their own
[59:30] hypocrisy that's when they're going to
[59:32] really mad how do I know because it
[59:34] happened a lot this week on
[59:36] YouTube I showed them their hypocrisy
[59:39] they call me this this this they call me
[59:41] all these things and this one guy's like
[59:43] I'm praying for you you've you've
[59:45] suffered so many scars I'm like well
[59:46] some of them are not really the it's not
[59:48] too bad sick words really really words
[59:50] really don't hurt me that much anymore
[59:52] you know over the Internet they don't
[59:53] hurt me too bad I appre appreciate the
[59:54] guy praying for
[59:57] me but you want to get somebody mad
[1:00:00] remember the devil's always going to
[1:00:01] accuse you through that person of what
[1:00:03] that person is guilty of
[1:00:05] always always like uh the brother that
[1:00:08] left the message he come to me and just
[1:00:10] sent me a text and said oh you don't do
[1:00:11] enough research that's what he's guilty
[1:00:13] of because he won't then he said I don't
[1:00:15] have time to read your book okay now we
[1:00:17] know now we know who won't do the
[1:00:19] research
[1:00:21] right right so whenever they accuse of
[1:00:25] if you confessed it right you're
[1:00:27] forgiven that's what they're guilty of
[1:00:30] all the people that have accused me in
[1:00:31] this church and left that's what they
[1:00:32] were guilty of they had issues with
[1:00:35] money if they're accusing me of that or
[1:00:37] they had issues of false prophecy that
[1:00:39] one sister I'm not laughing but I'm just
[1:00:41] saying it's just it's just just making
[1:00:43] me aware now she's the one that falsely
[1:00:45] prophesied something I didn't falsely
[1:00:47] prophesy anything I just said I really
[1:00:49] think that brother's going to come in
[1:00:50] the message someday let's pray that he
[1:00:51] comes in the message that's all I said
[1:00:54] come to find out they're the one that's
[1:00:55] guilty
[1:00:56] that because that sister would say the
[1:00:59] Lord told me this the Lord told me that
[1:01:00] I don't know if you remember who I'm
[1:01:01] talking about H but they would say she
[1:01:02] would say the Lord told me this the Lord
[1:01:03] told me the Lord didn't tell her nothing
[1:01:06] because what she said didn't come to
[1:01:07] pass the very thing the devil and that
[1:01:10] person is guilty of they'll accuse you
[1:01:12] of that but I've learned just always
[1:01:14] turn it around back on them
[1:01:17] Hallelujah this have been some spiritual
[1:01:19] warfare this week Hallelujah got the
[1:01:21] sharp sword of the word of God

[1:03:09] Baptist they couldn't silence him so
[1:03:11] they cut off his head here they can't
[1:03:13] silence him so they just raise their
[1:03:15] voices they'll do anything to drown out
[1:03:16] his voice that's what YouTube does

[1:03:55] was a witness of the first Christian
[1:03:59] martyr and he supported it
[1:04:02] 100% he was so spiritually blinded think
[1:04:06] about this he had such an anointing of
[1:04:08] antichrist on him that he had wanted
[1:04:10] this Christian to be
[1:04:12] killed but it wouldn't be a short time
[1:04:14] where it would

[1:06:35] God I heard brother Donnie Reagan say
[1:06:37] the other day he's watched numerous
[1:06:39] people die and numerous people were the
[1:06:40] same way they were crossing over they
[1:06:42] were greeting people before they went
[1:06:43] over beyond the curtain of time what a
[1:06:46] testimony praise God Amen what a
[1:06:49] testimony there is a land Hallelujah
[1:06:51] that I'm homesick for though I've never
[1:06:54] seen it before
[1:06:56] Hallelujah and he kneels down he says
[1:06:58] lay this not to their charge oh you know
[1:07:02] why he said that he had to say that
[1:07:03] because Saul was standing right there
[1:07:05] and Saul had to be forgiven hallelujah

[1:07:24] is spoken God will speak through you and
[1:07:27] people can be forgiven Hallelujah that's
[1:07:30] what Jesus said he said when I give you
[1:07:31] the keys to bind and loose that's what
[1:07:34] he was saying Stephen had the key to
[1:07:37] loose uh loose sa from all those sins
[1:07:40] and and Stephen through that prayer he
[1:07:43] hit a multitude of sins Hallelujah let's
[1:07:46] head to our feet praise

[1:07:58] to I didn't get to the thought but I
[1:08:00] want to get I wanted to get to the
[1:08:01] thought where brother R said if you want
[1:08:03] the Holy Ghost you got to open yourself
[1:08:04] up to it in other words you can't resist
[1:08:06] it
[1:08:08] amen right he talks about that in
[1:08:11] Albuquerque 1963 God hiding himself in
[1:08:14] Simplicity brother said I see you're
[1:08:16] afraid to tune your turn yourself loose
[1:08:18] you're scared of something there's
[1:08:20] something wrong God Don't Make A Promise
[1:08:22] then go back on it he says it's your
[1:08:24] death it's your burial it's your
[1:08:27] exception there's the word he said so
[1:08:30] help me the holy spirit is here so help
[1:08:33] me Jesus Christ is here praise God amen
[1:08:38] amen
[1:08:43] hallelujah he says friends you got to
[1:08:45] get away from that starchy Pentecostal
[1:08:47] way you got to really die you got to
[1:08:50] really mean it he said you got a partial
[1:08:53] hunger but not a real hunger you got to
[1:08:56] make it genuine while Peter spake these
[1:08:59] words the Holy Ghost fell on them that
[1:09:01] heard it he says try closing your eyes
[1:09:03] and bowing your head think it over is
[1:09:05] there something wrong Lord take away my
[1:09:07] unbelief he
[1:09:13] says he says you have a a conception of
[1:09:16] what you should do you kind of have an
[1:09:18] idea he says well now if I stand up and
[1:09:21] this he says you can sit down it don't
[1:09:22] make any difference where you're at but
[1:09:24] where you will open yourself up and then
[1:09:27] the holy spirit will strike amen
[1:09:30] hallelujah
[1:09:32] amen he says then well sometimes it
[1:09:35] begins to anoint you and you won't just
[1:09:37] lead on through with it you get a little
[1:09:39] scared you're afraid you pull back he
[1:09:42] said Just Surrender yourself re
[1:09:44] surrender yourself to the Holy Spirit
[1:09:47] don't be afraid of fanaticism if it's
[1:09:49] the devil acting don't you think we'll
[1:09:51] know it that's what I learned over these
[1:09:54] last this last year preaching on Dancing
[1:09:56] if it's the devil dancing we'll know
[1:09:58] it's the devil
[1:09:59] dancing they'll start someone will start
[1:10:01] shaking their wrong body part or
[1:10:03] something like that they'll just go try
[1:10:05] to glorify themselves but if it's God if
[1:10:08] it's God encouraging the people to dance
[1:10:10] that they're just going to glorify God
[1:10:12] in other words we got nothing to fear
[1:10:13] praise God amen amen we just got to get
[1:10:17] unafraid we just got to open ourselves
[1:10:19] up and let the Holy Spirit lead and
[1:10:21] guide us praise Goden Hallelujah
[1:10:24] not in other words don't resist the Holy
[1:10:27] Spirit he said you just surrender

[1:12:58] it I have total confidence in
[1:13:03] that the reason I've been praying like
[1:13:06] this and allowing time for gifts is
[1:13:09] because I want to I want to expect more
[1:13:12] gifts I just want to give a chance for
