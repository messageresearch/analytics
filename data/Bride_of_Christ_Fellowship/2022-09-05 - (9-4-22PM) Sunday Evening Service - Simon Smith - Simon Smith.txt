========================================

everybody all right everyone's first service all right by god's grace i just wanted to bring a thought here and we're going to continue on that uh idea i guess this is through casey i have this i have a powerpoint setup i don't know if this is technically technical to certify the powerpoints so uh now i i did a follow-up point here because there's a lot of reading but i want to show you um let's just pinpoint where the problem is is what i like to just go right to the root of the problem you know some people are saying this and some people say that and all these sort of things i like just to hit it right you know okay i see this little plant on the yard there and okay it's got a flower here it's got this kind of but what does it look like in the room where's that where did that thing start at don't throw us i'm gonna uh examine that by god's grace tonight and i know from what i hear the young ones are ready for david to be played on the little big screen there and uh [Laughter] quite the quite the video and uh you guys just went and saw that right correct what yes i said there and i then took my wife for anniversary over there to see that that was really a phenomenal phenomenal show and uh man those things just make you want to be a christian i mean if you can't watch that you know i watched a video of this non-christian man and this non-christian man was making a video of him he wouldn't do like a response video or a reaction video to uh christian music about the modern christian music and he was played some certain song and he was really getting into it you know and he's like man this is a really good song he's like the ups and the downs and the this person holds this and that person holds that and uh but it moved him you know didn't bring the salvation no but it really it moved him and that's uh something that's uh aggro by the grace of god that the christian song could even uh do that maybe to heath and why would they want to listen to that you know that's not their nature that's not their uh desire so anyhow uh i guess we'll get in the word of god here um let's open our scriptures here to uh first corinthians 11. we're going to continue on the same thoughts here and uh we'll stand here for the reading that we're um i'm gonna get into some interesting things maybe i to me some of the things we're gonna hit tonight and uh i've listened to this there's a there's a book i've audio listened to and it's uh thoroughly amazing i mean i'm sure you guys all listen to it but we're going to touch about that tonight we're going to talk about this little book this little no-name book not a print on the front but inside there's some things here so first corinthians 11 verse 24 and when he had given thanks he break and said take e this is my body which is broken for you with this duty in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying that this cup in the is the new testament in my blood this do you do eat as often as you drink it in remembrance of me so this is some of the new testament things you know that we're required to do is that god said do this in remembrance of me amen he says for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup yet you shoe the lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body now what takes place if they take this unworthily for this cause many are sick are sorry are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged right that's right so now let's jump over here now to matthew 16 and one through three and then we'll say a creator matthew 16 1 the pharisees also with the sadducees came tempting and tempting desired him that he would shoot them a sign from heaven and he answered and said to him when is it evening you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning will be foul weather today for the sky is red and lowering he says oh ye hypocrites you can discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the sign of the time so say word prayer yes by god's grace heavenly father lord jesus so we love you lord we come humbly before you ask jesus and oh god may your perfect lord god will be done tonight rosberg uh stepping behind here over this little desk here god one day brother dave i believe built years and years ago yes sir and lord is still in service lord hallelujah that original move there god and oh we're so grateful lord for the standing god yes lord you know god we ask of mighty blessing upon us assembly lord upon the pastor upon the attendance lord the real born-again members lord and those that are future born again god though we want you to have we pray lord they find favor in your sight god lord yes you know i mean you show them continue with that escaped path god may never get dark and grow but you always be lit up already ready for that escape god we love you and bless this service god in the name jesus christ amen sir once again just uh honored to be here and um take every serious uh our service very serious i do um i just listened to the prophet of god said i don't know why i made this waste but when i go hunting i gotta hit that score right in the eyes he said all the other brothers they can just shoot on the side or take a leg off wounded you know or in the ear or something you know and it'd be they're good to go but the prophet god said it's got to hit exactly and he said that's his makeup now me i don't know anything much about guns i've shot quite a bit you know well not a lot but i've shot uh the one thing i'm very serious about in my occupation is the plumbing the can test if you're plumbing to hold you're in trouble if your system does not hold you or a major major trouble i try to stress that with the guys who try to plumb and i said you got to make sure everyone everyone every glue joint has to you've got to be perfect and lately in my business that i'm in they've been using me as the link detection guy i go there and find all the leaks yeah i don't understand that either anyhow so i do take we got to make sure the word of god holds it's got to run it's gotta it's gotta do yeah good hit every time you gotta prove all things that's a very serious thing you've got to prove all things i can go up here and just say whatever i think i say but is it doctrine and the doctrine takes what proof doctor takes uh evidence to prove a doctrine and doctrine takes what not my thoughts or words coming out of my mouth what i think but it takes the word of god to prove doctrine hallelujah so we want to always stick with that as our our our aim with our aim and with our uh we want to strike that every time is to prove all things so hallelujah uh so tonight i want to teach on discerning the sign of the times and the saints of god we and you all know this i'm sure every minister behind the public gets gets up here before they get into their topic and just talk about world things and we're right there this thing is just uh we're very very close we know everything is rattling it seems like as far as my trade that things are slowing down a little bit one company has laid off a very large number of uh people uh so it looks like things may be slowing down i you know in my little tiny life here the 80s were rough 81 82 there was a nice recession that's when our father got laid off from gm okay i believe of course uh i come into trades around 2001 2002 things were recession there as well laid off a year and a half for the first three years of my apprenticeship that was kind of rough and then 2008 a little recession and now um we know they come and go and they're all designed everything's for purpose god has allowed everything for you he said everything would take place before it did and it's coming to pass brother bible study other dice and brother i do bible study on prophecy it's a prophecy just read revelation 17. everything that jesus said in revelation 17 has come to pass everything in in the church ages chapter 1 2 has come to pass i mean it's all the whole thing's prophetic there i mean you can just look at the histories look at uh the natural things look at geography look at the the the statistics i mean everything is coming to pass to me that's a a witness that the lord has left us now amen um as far as discerning the sign of the times uh if there is an age literally an age of insanity where is but the bible said what they'd be wretched poor blind naked and miserable and won't even know it and the prophet god said well how in the world can you be poor blind naked and miserable and not know it you'd have to be completely out of your mind okay that's right completely and we know the profit of god one intention just showed how a lot of that has to do with the food the food you you you bring these hybrid seeds you start planting this hybrid fruit seeds that produces hybrid fruits and hybrid vegetables which have what little or no vitamin content any of those things that are essential for life for growing up strong and tall and big and all those sort of things which i i missed the big part into all the parts but uh for what little body i mean he we did okay by god's grace uh as far as healthy i found some i had some issues here uh recently but we're getting past those and looking and uh i've always kind of one of those things and here we found out that it was yes so uh now in second peter i want to get into this here by god's grace i don't hold you too late but i want to go now we have a lot of reading here coming up because i want you to see what was written amen everything you're seeing and hearing about comes from somewhere everything you're seeing and you're just like how in the world can they believe that [Music] right brother i mean i mean in america it's kind of like a we have that that spirit of joking right flat frolic and and and just cutting up and those sort of things and now america's i'm sure the world is too the world they make fun of their leaders and politicians and uh they'll have videos where a certain politician from new york is saying some things are just the illegals have rights and there's the guy who actually deals with the borders that if they're illegal they have no rights and yet the lady continues on and on and on and the guy's just going can't believe what he's hearing right right complete and utter insanity that's right now whether it's complete acting or just the ability to even think clearly is gone absolutely no ability to put to discern right from wrong whether through training or education however these people are going on to a level of insanity and they're saying bless you bless you and they're going to such a a way of insanity that you literally are left speechless the majority time in your sight you know you know how i explain a lot of things at work i just said hey so and people complain about the government they'll complain about this and that decision and this law and this i said let me tell you something you and me are on this job right and i go yeah and i go we're going to work together right he goes yeah he goes why because we want to finish the job we want to do a good job and i said look around there's like 100 people on this job site and we all have a common goal and we are going to accomplish this goal and i said now we as men can do this because that's what we do this is what we're paid to do we can do it because we have the ability to do this and we'll work together and it'll get done and yet now our government cannot figure out how to do that between two parties right democratic republic right now on a job site you have roofers you got framers you got concrete guys you got sparkies electricians and you got tight fighters and plumbers uh you got uh ground guys you've got site guys you got you got over probably 40 different kind of trades and yet they're able to work together right make a common good half that's right brother right it just doesn't make sense right now let's continue on here now in second peter 2 and 18 he says for when they speak great swelling words of vanity they allure through the lusts of the flesh through much wontonness those who are clean escaped from them who clean escape from them who live in air while they promise them liberty they themselves are the servants of corruption for of whom a man is overcome the same as he brought into bondage that's very very important if someone overcomes you then now you are under them and they control you that's right sure absolutely for if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the lord and savior jesus christ they are again entangled therein and overcome the latter and is worse with them than the beginning okay now notice this is dealing with people watching who these are people who are like showing trying to show something greater that this is the way to freedom this is the way to life everlasting this is the way to eternal life the tree of life and those sort of things and the bible says they promise you something great when actually they're putting you under bondage and they think they're doing fine but what they have put you under their thumb and now they are fully controlling you and they're i'll say it like this there's a brother to come preach for us like a bigger name and he went back to the old pastor's office and brother can just kind of talk and this and this and the brother all of a sudden he says brother cam they'll never control me i'm not going to be controlled by them this and this and my cam's like what are we talking about here and it's almost like he just let the inner battles of his mind out of his heart just come out of his mouth and confess that something and he never made it clear he never made sure he never said anything about who was or anything like that but he said he said that they won't be they're not going to control me remember they can of course let me know about it like and uh yeah so there's there's controlling going around in this message of the owl now so let's continue on here now and we hit this earlier this uh this morning here by god's grace he says through this volume and he's talking about uh the the church ages he says through this volume would concern itself with various marriage doctrines such as goddamn water baptism etc found in revelation chapter 1 to 3 its main theme is a setting forth of a detailed study of the church ages the seven church ages this is necessary in order to study the understanding the rest of revelation for out of the ages comes the seals and how the seals come the trumpets and out of the trumpets come the viles right so notice it's a continual growth from one thing to the next to the next to the next to the next and then i'll say like this if we came from heaven and we have to go back there god has to and he knows and he plans and allowed us to be what lost if he sent us down to be lost and we're lost way in the beginning he's got to find a way where he brings forth away to what gets us back to heaven absolutely and if you look at the scripture read the scripture and you look at it he took 6 000 years to do it he's taking on purpose this long going from revelation to revelation to revelation to understanding here a little their little precept upon precept line upon nine chapter paul chapter book after prophet prophet after prophet and he took that much time to what builds to the place where there will be a people who is ready for a body changed but god did it in such a slow slow way that he only revealed so much light for a certain age to only get him up to so far because if they would go so far would get out of his plan he would not be able to accomplish the way he wanted to accomplish it that's right right he says like i'll just say like this brother jesse is his oldest man child right here or the maokai and brother maokai would probably should only know certain things at certain times of his life as grown up absolutely now brother jesse uh i know he was in the home invasion there for a little bit maybe he got a gun i can't remember if he did or not however and then uh you know you know malachi grove at four years old you know and he's like dad let me see that gun josh is like no you're not gonna see that gun it's not time for you to handle the gun now right now uh uh does brother mack i need enough gun no he's got these two things right here he's a weapon machine himself right but now would also be a good time for him maybe to learn uh if his dad would choose or him and his however to get into maybe shooting or however this that it would be a good time but not over zion's age that's not a good time for boys or children to handle guns right pretty simple but yeah you get my point yeah and the same way with the heavenly father absolutely he's not going to give you that spoken word thus saith the lord or just speak it when you're just a little child as far as giving i'll say like this now if you look at satan's children god or satan will give his children all kinds of power with no character that's right right they're in the astral production projection they're into all kinds of sorcery all kinds of spiritual stuff but what the prophecy is power without character is satanic that's right amen right and now us who are we believe we're the bride of christ we've heard the word of god it's open to us receive the baptism of the holy ghost and how many have actually seen a vision but just maybe he said it's kind of kind of debate debate about it however i don't think i've ever seen a vision and yet i've served the lord we tried to serve the lord for 20 years now but the power we're going to receive is going to take a character upgrade we're going to be the most humble like moses said was the most meekest man on the face of the earth right right yes because what always believed christ is the abcs but the spiritual things the spiritual gifts really deal with the supernatural but we must have the character for it now amen here we go this is where we he says like the first verse of the roman candle the church ages come forth with a mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further lie but once the bridge of the church ages of seven churches is followed by divine revelation light upon light follows now here's now see what the now this it tells you exactly god is progressive and he moved by a progressive nature and he has to he starts with one thing then he moves to the next and then he's removed and he's trying to teach us something but you've got to follow him amen amen those very first disciples that followed john the baptist oh this is the great mighty prophet john the baptist in there and the wilderness baptized and baptized and baptized and all of a sudden their prophet their man of god says what behold the lamb of god right there his disciples would watch someone that as this ministry could continue here and he says look behold the lamb of god cometh and these disciples are watching john the baptist and this man called jesus and john the baptist holds himself to the man and the guys are like well this is the prophet i thought this was the prophet and then here now the prophet has to take the lamb of god into the water and baptize him and they saw absolutely nothing but then later they said john says he goes guys he goes i saw the heaven i saw this thing the form of dove come down and rest right wow and then jesus would go by john's camp and say come follow me and a couple left but all the rest of john that disciple stop they just stay right here and say with john baptist and they stayed what in darkness up until acts 19. that's right brother right they had no idea that the light had moved off absolutely so we've got to always be in two now notice both john and james and peter then they were john the baptist they were in that kind of group whatever but they were able to discern something that that prophet said about following jesus and not staying with a prophet sure even at after prophet went off the scene what they were still john the baptist john the baptist john the baptist john the baptist and totally missed christ himself that's right but because of divine intervention because of election what god brings what is his next major prophet i'm saying saint paul was the first church church messenger said hey go meet my boys right there and show them catch them up with the light amen amen absolutely right now notice from light to light to light now what does the scripture say is there does this run in the scripture like this look look here blessed is the man whose strength is in thee amen and his heart are the ways of them who passing to the valley of bacca make it uh make it a well the rain also for the past they go from strength to strength every one of them in zion appears before god so what are we supposed to go to from strength to strength to strength to strength absolutely hallelujah right now right now there's no way anyone could even touch me on as far as in my mind even a baptism even if they pulled the scripture i'd never seen it it kind of went against baptism i know it's right baptism is right even got it there's no doubt about it in my mind baptism godhead the oneness is absolutely right because what we went from strength to prove this to prove that amen it's continued on now if you go from strength to strength you get stronger and stronger and stronger amen sure now notice uh uh in job 17 nine he says the righteous also shall hold on his way and he that have clean hands shall be stronger and stronger see it's always an increase that's right you should there and i'll take this what's the limit what's our where do we max out at come up hither all right you here come up here it'll prove that he went from strength to strength to height to height to revelation to revelation when you come up when you hear that club hither you have arrived amen amen but that's the point of all this is to leading and building and building building what for the great body change amen exactly right now glory he says uh verse uh proverbs 4 and 17 he says for they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence but the path of the just is a shining light that shines us more and more unto the perfect day are we heading into the perfect day yes in the word absolutely to the jesus christ absolutely we are in that day and that day will what it will shine more and more and more it's going to get brighter and clearer and if you look at the bible it talks about how he says when the son of man comes he says it'll come like a thief in the night there's like three scriptures that say that but then saint paul says he says but to you who are of the day we will know that time absolutely amen amen hallelujah absolutely if you caught the revelation this message you i was like this if you caught the revelation of this message you will not be in darkness hallelujah sure amen in john 15 1 says i am the true vine and my father is the husband man every branch in me that bears that fruit he taketh away and every branch should bear a fruit how many's got fruit on how he's got that real love and care and concern all the fruits of the spirit right he says if you even have a little bit of fruit he says he purchased it oh why are these trowels coming [Music] why are these trials coming these tough times brother i'm going through it it's probably got some fruit on top that's right and what does he do that he purges it he gives you some tough times he rips down the more of the simon the old simon takes the old brother simon out just continually scrubs me clean and you clean that it may bring forth more fruit amen amen god you want to talk about prosperity gospel [Laughter] more and more stronger stronger and greater and greater and lighter absolutely that's right that is the bride of christ not natural but spiritual by the end of this you'll be the most spiritual richest people that have ever lived and you'll be so humble about it and you'll be so giving you'll say silver and gold have i none let me show you what he can do absolutely if we want to get back to the point where we hear the voice of god we are completely led of the spirit and don't go here go right here because the door's going to open up and say this when they come and the angel visits you on a rooftop or however and things start moving just like in the book of acts absolutely amen amen now second corinthians 3 16 nevertheless is when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away now the lord is that spirit when the spirit of the lord is there is liberty but we are with open face beholding as a glass he says the glory of the lord are changed in the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord so only this so by the spirit of the lord you will be changed from this to this because the what's in paul saying there's a glory of the the terrestrial and there's a glory of the celestial that's right glory of this body is the glory of that body this what is moving from one to the next to the next to the next what is the mind of god how far will he take us in the millennium how far will he take us into eternity yes we can't even imagine what eternity will have as a divorce right all i know is that when he's there that means his presence is gonna be there and in his presence with these perfect bodies that we're going to have where are smiles you'll have the strongest smiling cheeks ever built by god ever because they're going to be no tears there's going to be no crying it's just gonna be joy forevermore hey amen sure now it's a little intro here so i've already got 26 minutes in okay so we're going to run this now and all these things notice here in second peter 3 and 17 you therefore beloved seeing ye know all these things before bewareless ye also being led away with the air of the wicked fall fall from your own steadfastness he says so be careful careful these things but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be glory both now and forever so what we're supposed to grow in grace yes well brother psy offended me i forgive him he's all right oh yeah if i really hurt your feelings say hey brother hey we need to talk here because you're really you really messed up this one i was like okay well tell me about it okay well all right all right i'm sorry what can i do to make it right hey man my cloak in my shirt he says but grow in grace and knowledge of ours now notice jesus if you're going to grow in knowledge then there has to be someone to desire that knowledge that's right amen now each one every human is born for knowledge you look at it i mean i don't i mean i have i've had puppies but i've never had a human baby i guess like that right my wife you know but that puppy i know it's kind of just as like you have no idea right that puppy is very curious and wants to learn how to catch and fetch and fight and bite scratch all those things now you get a young uh acacia a young haven or charis or howard they're interested in what mom's doing they're interested in what dad's doing they want to learn they say what children are sponges yes mom and dad be riding the car that child will say blah blah blah who's holding that where'd they learn that they just absorb things they have they just want to know everything i've seen children say i can't wait to learn how to read because then they can gain more and more knowledge because they know there's something about this written language we have that we can learn read and catch those things amen i notice here now therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus we're gonna hit something and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who are able to teach others also now this is the word of god coming from the holy ghost blasting out of saint paul warning what his son in the faith uh taught timothy and the devil's right here listening okay all right i'll set my little shop up too here now therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of christ jesus christ no man that war entangled himself with the affairs of this world this life that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier but he says the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others now i want to go into a little book here okay you got a lot of reading everybody okay everybody yes eye's okay i know we're wearing you probably just had some pizza or some chipotle or some kind of i got my wife thai food last night that's really good makes you sleepy i want to show you something look at this this was taken from a uh history history book and it's about a cartoon i'm gonna show you the cartoon here in sixth in 1868 the new york legislature ruled that public funds public money tax money however kind of wherever they get this public money is of the people could be made available to private schools where'd that influence come from most of the schools that benefited from this law were parochial schools of the roman catholic church i wonder where that paper came how'd they get that run through there shortly thereafter roman catholics complained about the compulsory use of the king james virgin bible in the public schools hmm already complaining okay we got this money and the money came with a little uh ear tag that you got to use the king james version bible another complaint about it because they got the money now they have to obey and now notice this this right here influenced this situation here in 1868 influenced this cartoon this is a little political propaganda here which is absolutely the true propaganda this should be this should be drawn notice here you have the americans here notice the u.s public school system over here notice where did we flee from we fled from england to get away from tyranny was it english government it was the catholic church it was the catholic church and notice how the uh the artist depicts the catholics as alligators coming over what to eat what what are they what is this man this man is not scared he's like back off man you ain't touching my children public school and he's back there's a lot in here i don't know what all means i was not from this era but notice they're coming after the children some lady over here is going to get hung i don't know what that's all about but they're coming to protect the children they're coming the catholic church is coming after the children 16 1868 okay now in our possession as americans as christians our number one book is the bible the authorized king james version by 1611. right and then probably the second book i would recommend after that is the seven church ages the exposition of the seven church changes amen the book after that would be 50 years in the church of rome by charleston that book is powerful now we're going to read some of what charles sir charles brother charles wrote on this is right around the time of his ordination into the priesthood he says the word education is a beautiful word it comes from latin educator or however you can say that which means to raise up to take from the lowest degree to the highest sphere of knowledge education now we're supposed to what to grow in the grace and the knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ yes now as we have heard of the insanity of the political scene and the carnal scene what about the scene i was like what about the religious scene in this message there are people baptizing in wayne branham right there are people baptizing tithing in joseph graham and to us of this sort of mind where we are right now that is complete insanity yes yes sir you have to be insane something else has become your absolute something else has become your absolute but it's all from knowledge education trained men taught taught to re-teach right he says the object of education is to feed expand raise enlighten strengthen the intelligence we hear the roman catholic priests make use of the beautiful word education is often in if not often than the protestant but the word education has a very different meaning among the followers of the pope than among the disciples of the gospel and that difference with the protestants ignore is the cause of the strange blunders they make every time they try to legislate on that question here as well as in england or in canada the meaning of the word education among protestants is as far from the meaning of the same word among the roman catholics as the north pole is from the south what wait a religious difference and it changes the word education absolutely when a protestant speaks of education that word is used and understood in its true sense when he sends his little boy to a protestant school i'll say it like this and i'm not trying to sow any seeds here but jesse is the pastor of this church right and he's the one that's supposed to be grabbing the revelation from the holy ghost and then therefore bringing the forth to the people now let's say young malachi here is playing the piano one day and just playing like this playing like this playing like this right and something comes to and says man i feel a pull to preach papa but justin's like you better pray on him so you want to be alone now the proper way for brother jesse to do this is to say brother man okay let's do some bible studies let's pray we're gonna ground and do some bible studies and then if you still feel led we'll we'll test the gift right but brother jesse would ever say you better not teach anything contrary to my revelation that i've teached over this pulpit but what if god gives for the malachi a different revelation or a greatness a higher revelation because we're supposed to go from strength to strength right from glory to glory to revelation to revelation now what are some of the minds of the message don't say anything that bill graham did not teach on the tapes or just ever teach anything to brother brandon teach in type and shadow sure absolutely me too did you ever use any scriptures that are on the tapes sure sure me too absolutely but there's a lot of people don't believe that all right just stick with what the tapes say where'd that teaching come from right if we're supposed to go now we're 70 years past the most he says now notice he's the protestant when a protestant seeks education that word is used understood in true sense when he sends his little boy to a prodigal school he honestly desires that he should be reared up in the spheres of knowledge as much as his intelligence will allow and that's every father every mother wants that for their babies right right he says when you practice and send your children to school you put no feathers all to their intelligence you raise with fluttering wings day after day though their flight at first is slow and timid how happy they feel as every new aspect of their intellectual horizons i'm sure sister lydia and malachi have watched their children their brothers and sisters grow up and say wow they're really learning they're they're pretty sharp they're well they knows almost as much as i do little havens really catching it wow absolutely and they get to watch the same process that they took that their parents took as well with their little right and they're always pushed and say even i want you to read this word again just say it pronounce it just how it's supposed to be it's pronounced and well it's 18 syllables well so what just get it done sure sure he says now notice he says uh though their flight at first is slow and timid how happy they feel when they go to the new intellectual horizons how their heart beats with unspeakable joy when they begin to hear voices of applause and encouragement from every side saying higher higher learn more higher push into the heavenlies absolutely with your what intelligence learn as much as you can because someday you're going to be a young man and someday you're going to be a young woman and you're going to have to what carry on you're going to provide for yourself and get a job right right that's right that's part of life when they shake their young wings and take a little still higher flight who can express their joy when they distinctly begin to hear the voices of a beloved mother or their father or venerable pastor cheering them and saying well done higher yet my child higher raising themselves with more confidence on their wings and they still hot they soar still higher in the midst of the uh unanimously concert the voice of the whole country encouraging to fly the highest it is then the young man feels his intellectual strength tenfold multiply one thing once they solve one mathematical problem they go to the next and like man i can do math once they learn english and shows adjectives and verbs and all those other things i forget all about 20 years ago wow i got the english language i got this and now they're pushing the higher highs and learn another language learn to go into geometry go into algebra and calculus and all those sort of things higher math right because you want to see how far they can go right because the more you know the more you'll earn a lot of times right in the natural right absolutely right he says uh he he lifts himself up on his eagle wings with a renewed confidence and power and source still up higher and higher with his heart beating with a noble enjoy uh a holy joy from south to north to east to west to echoes rings is here's voicing higher yet higher higher they're always pushing their children to the best they can be right amen absolutely for he had also heard the voice of god speaking through his son jesus christ saying come unto me fear not come come unto me i am the light the way come to this region a higher region where the father and the son of the spirit reign in endless life amen amen absolutely so notice the spiritual the natural one in the same what we see taking in the natural should be the spiritual what we see in the spiritual should be the natural as well if we hear the voice of god calling us into the rapture then we should hear what in the natural we should be the best man hallelujah praise god let's continue on here i don't want to be too long jesus i'm going to start down here right in the protestant schools no feathers are put on the young eagles wings there's nothing to stop in his progress or paralyze his movements and upward flights right the thus it is that the only true great nations in the world are protestants yes literally why the american revolution they call it the american revolution late 1800s early 1900s why they called the american industrial revolution because industry just boom they were notice once they got from underneath the catholic control right and they're free naturally to think on their own and experiment on their own and not told that you have to pay this for indulgences and this and this and and you can't do this you can't do this the pope says this book once they're freed from all of that amen glory and there's no one telling them what they could do a lot of these christians at the time or however yeah they want to be free from that work they were able to free their minds and what they do they just sat they worked and waited for revelations to come on how to build this and how to build this and how can we make this better and make this work better more efficient at this and this and hey you ever take a take a tour of one of those early 1900s steam ships phenomenal the technology had back then you blown away i mean why couple right to legal thus it is that the only true great nations in the world are protestants why does the usa have one of the worst uh health care systems right now for being number one supposedly we're way way way low let me ask you a question why does israel one of the most powerful nations in the world right now
