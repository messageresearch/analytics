study so I recorded it if you want a copy let me know I record it on my phone uh by God's grace we know prayer is the key amen let everything else be secondary prayer has got to be number one how many

Father Lord we love you Lord this morning we're not in a hurry Lord God many times I've been guilty of that Lord trying to be in a hurry so Lord pardon me we just want to feel comfortable in your presence Lord God we want to not try to rush anything but we just want to enjoy your word Lord and we want to pray as a body of Believers this morning Lord we've gathered in this place there's been

right here by us and by God's grace we're so very thankful to the Lord to be in that place where you don't understand right now we're in the place yes sir we really are in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus we might be dealing with this body of time but really we're in this righteous holy place the Bible said our soul has already went there yes sir amen so we're inment camped about the inumerable host of angels I think we ought to enjoy a Little Bit of Heaven on this side don't you hallelujah amen I certainly love the Lord Jesus with all of my heart I wanna I want to preach to you this morning on the essence of God's love the essence of God's love uh sometime after I left you in April I was preaching I was doing a wedding for a brother and um he was marrying a young lady from Pennsylvania area by brother Lambert on that side of the world in Pennsylvania and uh brother Lambert had asked me to preach for him and I I was happy to do it and the Lord had spoke to me some words that afternoon and I wanted to really study it and get into the depth of it because when the Lord meets you like that it just you know there's some special things involved and uh my I just had no idea what was going to come out of the thought and I heard him say the words the essence of love and when I heard those words I thought well Lord Jesus I only got a little spot time to get it together you got to help me my the things the Lord giv me I'm just excited to be able to share these things with you today and uh just just trust in the Lord to really give us a nice time in the in the word today let's start with First Corinthians chapter 13 verse 11 112 and 13 I was reading a quote this morning brother Jesse that I found this morning just in Reading just looking through one of's messages and I've been studying a couple things on the on the the day that we're living in with these politics and all these things coming in and while you get in your spot there in First Corinthians I just was reading in the message this morning I made a quotation last night where the Prophet said the nation is gone and I happen to hit this little spot this morning I wanted to read it to you especially with this election all these things getting ready to come on I want you to listen to the said sin is worse than it ever was and it will continue to get worse there will be no National repentance amen the nation is gone he said just you individuals and soon that'll be over he said it if isn't already he said you mark it down you young children that's us he said and see if brother brandham he said well it ain't brother brandham he said it's right or wrong as I've said sin will get worse until one day the SK Skies will catch on fire she'll fall to the earth the earth will burn with a fervent heat but the redeem won't be there they'll be gone he says amen amen so America according to that can never be great again right and it really don't matter if it's Hillary or Trump she's got thus sayith the Lord as brother Smith said this morning she's got th thus sayith the Lord as he was telling me in the office you got thus sayith the Lord working against you and you can never beat thus sayith the Lord she's never going to rise again the only hopes we've got now this is why I'm making this remark like this the only hope you and I have got is he said it's the individuals and you know what friends we need to be as much in love with the Lord as we possibly can because if the nation is gone and then individuals will be gone how much more time do we have hello somebody how much more time do we have we don't have much whether it's a woman present or not a woman whatever it may be it's it's the individuals and the individuals have got to get down to business serving the lord in the right way with all of our hearts we don't want to serve him half heart we want to serve him with all of our heart sir got place that 1 Corinthians 13 oh by the way brother Ro did you write that music too was that your music in in the that you did the music I love that brother my that was wonderful I know the song I know that's that's an old old old song My no one ever cared for me he was right on the money with the message this morning and I wanted to compliment the music too I thought really beautiful my goodness he's a talented man I wish I had six months with just to learn I really enjoyed it brother that was really wonderful one my favorite songs too that no one ever cared for me this exactly what we're going to talk about this morning is God's love God's love what it's all about the essence of his love all right now 1 Corinthians 13:1 let's pick it up when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things right for now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even also as I am known now abideth watch carefully faith hope and charity what a strange place to go from talking about growing up to putting this in there in a way it kind of looks like Paul's changing his thought actually he's in the same thought all the way through it he's continuing right on about this with growing up and becoming an adult this is no accident that he says right in Here and Now abideth faith hope and charity because actually he's talking about growing up in the Lord with those three things amen that's right but the greatest of these is Charity now let's turn to First John chapter 4 verse 7 God first John chapter 4 verse 7 7-1 certainly had a good time at the Bible Study last night in the prayer meeting and I've laughed and said I don't get communion and prayer meetings often and I like them when I get them and I really enjoyed last night we spent about an hour and 48 minutes in prayer last night I mean on the subject teaching but we spent about a half hour I guess praying on top of that is really really wonderful 1 John chapter 4 verse 7-10 can never go wrong praying can you beloved let us love one another for love is of God and everyone that loveth is born of God and knoweth God he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love is love not of love now but he is love now watch him in verse S he said love is of God but now he turns right around and said but God is love right there's a reason for that in this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him here in his love you ready not that we loved God but that he loved us hallelujah praise the Lord and sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins well you say I love God that might be right but that's not really what puts you in hello brother brandom said you can even love God from your human Spirit still wind up in hell it's not whether you love him or not it's whether he loves you Lord y Qui presan this morning amen that's exactly right now here's the Bible here's the Bible what we call the most in this is the only infallible book in the world do you believe what it says right here that God loves you you understand one of the greatest things that I get confronted with from people they just don't feel like the Lord even loves them but the Bible said it right here God loves us amen he loves us and Brother Andy he wants us to be saved he wants us to have the Holy Ghost but John he wants us to be blessed beyond measure amen that's right he wants us to have everything in his word let's talk to him just a moment Heavenly Father we so thank you Lord Jesus for the opportunity to come behind this sacred desk and open up the pages of the Bible and the message and my just dig right into the word of the Lord I pray that you would help us today give us an unction from the presence of God let us be able to look into the supernatural things of your word and let us be able to Feast upon those things that will be revealed to us as I preach as they receive Lord move me out of the way that I might be a vessel used of you that you could speak through me today Lord Jesus open their hearts that they might receive for Lord Jesus no gift that's ever been given to us is for our own edification is for the glorification of the Lord Jesus and the kingdom of God and we thank you Father for allowing us to glorify you with the gifts you've placed into our hearts and lives greater than all gifts the gift of the Holy Ghost may we just begin to praise you and worship you this morning and have a Heart of Thanksgiving and gratefulness knowing that Lord as I read just a moment ago the nation is gone but individuals can still seek your face thank you Lord for that opportunity give us your favor now as we look into the things of God in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you you may be seated Megan if I don't tell you you remember CU I'll forget it tell Sunny I said hello and if he's in a tree stand this morning you tell him I'm with him no I just hav't fun amen amen if I don't tell you now I forget it I'm almost to the top of the hill 40's coming you know that I walk into a room now and say what I walk in here for you amen hallelujah I just love them the Bible don't you thank God I I I just really appreciate the way that the Apostle Paul wrote this I have all the things that he said to us I just really love this particular spot because it just really to me exemplifies what God wants out of us that he doesn't want us to be just children as it was tossed to and fro but he wants us to become adults become grownup Christians in the Lord Jesus and I find it to be a a blessing to us as the people of God to know that God had a vision for each of Our Lives he had a thought in his mind of what he wanted us to achieve what he wanted us to be and that gives me the hope of knowing that my destiny and my future is not relied solely upon my decisions and what I want and so forth is that thank God for that because without his leadership and without his the ability for God to lead me and guide me in certain ways I I can speak for me I can't speak for you but I know I would have made a mess out of my life today it would have been an absolute mess because the decisions I would have made that would have been uh to fulfill my own self- desires and what I wanted and what I thought and so forth like but God had a plan for our lives and we can rest and have confidence in the reality that this plan that God had for us he is determined to see it through to fruition now God is a is a creature that many times people don't understand because they look at him through their own personal filters of looking at him and they study him based upon uh what they think and what they believe themselves and many times that's dangerous because because what your thoughts about God may be could be as completely contrary to what he really is as day is from night that's why we have the Bible and why God provided the Bible for us so that we can study what he thinks as he is not just a guess at it or a suppose or hope so maybe so but we can actually see him in the word just as he really is and the word gives us that ability that that illumination if you will to be able to look into his character and look into what his Essence is to understand what God's all about now I I see many of you with pencils and things this morning I want to give you a remark that you can write down and study uh sometime later after the message and I want you to remember this that God does not desire to be a lawgiver God does not desire to be a judge to be a lawgiver that's never been in the heart of God to be a judge or a lawgiver and I'll go on record this morning and make this remark to you that it's that God any time the Lord Jesus has ever had to whip us or correct us it's never be been because God wants to do you understand what I'm saying to you it's never been because God desired to but many times if God has to correct us or whip us or do something it's because our Behavior has forced his hand to have to correct us or make some change in our life or uh some circumstance he was cutting off and it's been us that's caused that out of God but he's never desired to be a judge over us or a lawgiver or to be someone that just completely uh as it was dictates like a dictator every area of our life and uh you know he wants to shove us in a corner and force us to be right and force us to be this and force us that's never been in God's heart but actually God at his core at the essence of what he really is God has always been love always from the very beginning he has been Lov now I want you to second of something for just a moment go in your minds to the Book of Exodus they're standing on the mountain and almighty God begins to bring to the people The Ten Commandments I I was laughing brother Smith the other night when I was sitting there in Lenor I I had he had a a little little table or desk or something there behind me and he had some plaqu on top of it one of them was the Ten Commandments and I had jumped up to get out of his way for something and sat down in the back of the chair knock that little desk and the Ten Commandments fell over and it broke his little a piece and two and I said oh brother I'm so sorry he said brother Ben that's okay they've been broke before he said I thought that was all right but I was thinking of some things on that when that little that little plaque fell on the ground and I thought you know really when when the people wanted judgment out of God really God didn't want to give it to him really it was not in God's heart to want to measure out to them Ten Commandments to control or dictate their life brother bam said they already had the pillar of Fire they already had the smitten Rock they already had the cloud they already had Grace and brother said Grace provided all of these things for their lives Grace provided a prophet Grace provided the cloud Grace provided the pillar of fire Grace provided manic Grace provided the water Grace provided Grace provided so God in his very essence in the way that he dealt with his children in the very beginning it never was upon the basis of law or being a lawgiver but it was love that God measured out to the people of God it was really man on the mountain if you go back and look does God change his mind about his word the prophet said it was man that cried out for the law we want a law God didn't want to give it to them they wanted the law themselves something that could govern themselves and so like that why because God in the beginning never desired to be a lawgiver now that doesn't mean to say that the Lord Jesus doesn't have standards that he didn't set rules that he didn't set regulations a friend of mine said it like this the other day when people talk about Holiness and holy living and they say oh living by rules and regulations and I I like what he said he used the example and he said brother Ben I I I preached it like this the other night he said that if you have a doctor we'll say a couple doctors and one wanted to build a house and he said that house would be a $1.5 million house and he builds the house another doctor beside him has a $2.5 million house and he said now they're part of a little Community you know and they have rules in this community of how that they build things he said well you got one doctor with a million dollar house this side $2 million house that side he said then all of a sudden Here Comes Billy Bob with his pickup truck and all the hound dogs in the back with the trailer in toe and he sets it up right in between them two doctors he said now if you ask them doctors if they are thankful for rules and regulations they're going to tell you yes as they're thankful that the that the community doesn't allow Billy Bob and his Fox hand to live right next door to their million-dollar Mansion well that's the way it is in serving the lord it's the same way we say well rules and regulation but see God doesn't want us to live according to a mandate because it's legalism because he wants us just to be bound or restricted but it is for our own protection it's for our own safety it's for our own happiness just like them doctors they wouldn't want to see you know the rebel flag of flying and the hound dogs in the front yard they're doctors they want to live with people of Their Own Kind well that's what the word of God does when it measures out a rule or a regulation is because God wants us to to fellowship and associate with our own kind I don't mind telling you but I'm glad I don't have to share streets of gold with murderers with Liars with if I'm going to share them over there then I might as well just stay here because that's what I'm sharing them with now I'm glad that heaven has got a regulation to it but in the very same token God never desired that we would live according to the law it was in his Essence in the beginning it was love it was Grace and that's what God wanted to show to us now watch this just out of the dictionary here I want to give you the definition of the word essence I think this really defines a lot for us this morning it is the characteristic of a thing that determines its identity the fundamental nature of that thing for example a piano the very essence of that piano is that it plays it has keys white and black keys has a certain sound 88 keys on it it has 12 chords it can do different uh octaves and so forth that is the fundamental nature of that piano so if you're playing a harmonica you've got a different Essence the essence of that piano is what you see out of it it's its fundamental nature but and John here is identifying for us that God's fundamental nature is that God is of love he tells us love one another but God is love in the same way so it's not that God just has a lot of love inside of it but God is of love anything that is of this perfect agape love God is for it and God is in it and God is behind it now I want you to notice this it is the very unchangeable nature of of the of the object itself ever what it is if it's an orange fundamentally the essence of that orange is it is always going to be an orange you cannot look at it and make it an apple you cannot take a bite out of it it tastes like a banana what it is is what it is so if I could say it this way every time you take a bite out of God it's the love of God love every time you enter into God anytime you associate with God love will always be the fundamental nature of the Holy Ghost himself this is why friends a lot of times when people are presenting the Lord Jesus and they present him as a judge and a lawgiver and there's never any mercy and there's never any Grace you can tell already that person does not understand the fundamental nature of the Holy Ghost praise the Lord you can say man it ain't going to scare me or God either one come on somebody exactly right the holy spirit is love God by his love that is the very essence and the Very nature of loveing himself I love this right here in the commentary on the Corinthians in First Corinthians chapter 13 that we read from there he uses this word love or the Greek word Agape now what's interesting about the word that Paul uses here is that this fundamental word this word Agape never shows up in any other language under Heaven as a matter of fact there's not one language that actually identifies properly the word Agape it's actually a word that God gives over to the Apostle Paul to bring in for the love of God it's actually I wouldn't say an invented word but God by inspiration leads Paul to show what real love is now every other language whether it be the uh whether it be Latin or or whatever it might be every word that they Define when they use the word love they identify it as Fellowship love identified as relationship love as friendship love but up until this time of the Lord Jesus and Paul the word love always represented friends or family but then when Jesus looks at Peter and he says Peter lovest thou me then he tells him feely oh my sheep feel oh my sheep Peter lovest th me then he says Agape or feed my sheep love my sheep give old to my sheep the very words that Jesus uses takes him from the ailio into the agapa and then the Apostle Paul being the one that was commissioned to open up the mysteries of God then he takes this very word and he Blends it in with a man growing from a child unto an adult look at it again there in 1 Corinthians 13 where Paul said I was a child and I spake like a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things now watch he said for now I see through a glass Darkly oh my what's he talking about God's love the essence of God's love himself his faith his hope his charity I'm looking as it were through a glass dly as I go and I begin to investigate what God really is and study what he really is I look through him I look at him and I look by him as I would look into a glass Darkly oh my and I would see the image of something but yet not understand it that's why on the very beginnings of our Christian walk with God we must understand the importance of being able to stick with that which we have begun because the first time you start serving the lord and as you begin to serve Christ you'll start out just a little measure of something and you'll see a little something about God oh it's a dim and it's a little sometimes but if you stick with it it begins to become more clear and become more understandable and you begin to see more about what he was why because as you look in this class Darkly Hallelujah it goes from being a child unto being an adult GL at least somebody blink at me every now and then praise the Lord exactly right well you say but brother Ben I don't understand how that it could be that way that's just the way God made it that's just the way God designed it you nobody is born a Christian full full grown that's right you got to grow all these children sitting around this building this morning they've got to grow this is the way God chose that they would come on the Earth has come by the way of reproduction and come as a baby not as a full grown adult and spiritually it's the same way for you and I we come as children babies before God seeing through a glass Darkly but then we see face to face in other words the image comes clear yes my now notice this I just want to read to you out of the Hebrew series I love what brother B says here on paragraph 126 this is in uh the Hebrews the first chapter of Hebrews as they studied there in 57 he said could you imagine before there was even an earth before there was a light before there was a star before there was anything this great Fountain going forth of spirit out of this Fountain he says comes the most pure love because there was nothing else for it to come from that but love and brother says what we call Love Today is perverted love but just as we get an Essence glory to God or a little bit of that opinion amen he said that love and US rather it changes our whole opinion just as soon as we get a little bit of that love in US it changes our whole opinion it changes my opinion to his opinion it changes my thoughts to his thoughts now notice how brother Bram described this this great Fountain of love so we go back into the beginning before there was a sun a moon a star before there was anything but God God in the beginning in his own creative work what is he at his Essence at his core Brother Andy what is he he's love amen and he's not just Fellowship love friendship love marital love he love pure absolute love agape love it's like a fountain bubbling brother B said he's gurgling and bubbling and moving every which direction oh my if you could just close your eyes and go back in time and listen all you would hear is that Fountain of love burbling and gurling ding oh God God in his Essence there's no judgment there there's no condemnation there only love judgment is a result of the Fall In the Garden of Eden sin is a result of man walking away from God's eternal love right it's not a result of God wan to be mean to us right brother right you're going to have to get louder than a Baptist if you expect to make Pentecostal Rapture here come on now come on now come on now praise the Lord preach with me a little bit this morning we're talking about God's love all but you say that's something that I'll never attain to you're wrong God already attain to it before you could even know about it God's love for you do you understand the Bible said before either child was yet born he said Jacob I love Esau I hated so if God showed his love to you he showed it to you before you was even you hello somebody God showed you his love and manifested his love to you that you might understand he is love my just as soon as we get a little bit or an essence of that love in US it changes our whole opinion so that's why you go to understanding you could preach to people 24 hours a day but if one little spot of God's love ever touches their heart it changes them forever yes it changes them forever praise God because no matter how much they read in the Bible no matter how much they hear preached if God doesn't reveal himself to them and touch their hearts with that little bit of essence from God's character that little bit of something that makes him God if they never feel that touch yes no matter how much they read about him in the Bible they'll have the same old opinions the same old thoughts the same old belief system they always had brother Jesse yes sir but the moment the Holy Spirit ever moves on their heart it changes their opinion Hall oh praise the Lamb of God hallelujah yes it changes their opinion now watch in St John chapter 3 we're all familiar with this 16-9 all right just just look at this for just a moment with me all right God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever should believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life the prophet said that's a perishing generation of people said all right but watch in verse 17 for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved so what was God's Essence in the beginning love yes he wanted all of us to have a chance all of us to have an opportunity yes now friends listen to me carefully do you understand that when you go to condemning yourself and throwing yourself in hell as though you have no chance you're actually working contrary to what God wanted for your life oh I'll never make it I'll never amount to nothing do you realize you are moving contrary to what God wanted in your heart cuz God wanted the best for us in the beginning is anybody going to preach with me this morning God wanted the best for us this he doesn't want the worst for us he's not waiting to hit us over the head and throw us in help God love us oh praise the Lord oh I but I know why some are quiet I know why you are Ain because you're sleepy it's because this is a hard thing for some people to swallow they've never been able to grasp onto God's love that's what I want to come after that devil this morning and let him know there's people sitting here that God loves your mama may not have loved you Daddy may not have loved you may not have family that loved you but there's one that did love you and that's the Lord Jesus Christ right I plan on smacking that hate devil in the mouth this morning hard as I can hit him that's exactly right now watch he said he that believeth on him is not condemned see but he that believeth not is condemned already because this is why he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world that men loved Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil right so it wasn't that God didn't love them it's just that they didn't love God amen amen well he would show his love to the world and he spread out his great wings of love over the people and he brooded over the whole humanity and he brooded over the generation of people he was preaching to the Bible said their deeds were evil and they loved darkness in other words they rejected God's love they rejected the essence of his character of who he was they rejected him oh my yes why do we get out of him because we don't reject him amen because we accept his love when he preaches things to us and sings things to us and oh my all the great things he does every little blessing of God do you realize my friends that we talk about having a book of Acts church do you realize it's already here amen I said it's already here am if you took down a book and you started writing down every little tiny thing and if you don't know how to keep Good Records brother John gram will teach you how to keep Good Records on how to do things I he's a wonderful notaker and I I need a little bit more John but you understand that if we wrote down everything in a book and wrote everything down of what God has blessed us on a daily basis for one year do you realize you could flip through them pages and see a book of Acts and action in your life already people in the church are always concerned with raising the dead i' like to see some of y'all raise your hands this morning praise the Lord I'm talking about book of Acts God loves us and wants us to enter into a greater depth of his love than we've ever entered into before in our life amen oh that his love what's make me what makes me feel like I feel this morning that's what it is that's right because I can't feel this way on my own that's for sure this is the condemnation that light has come into the world because men loved Darkness rather than light why because their D Deeds were evil now watch you an identification but said like this he said Jesus came to sa that which was lost that's what he did now there had to be something to save this lost now watch close so it had to be a different character than that which was lost so when Jesus was born Jesus could not have come the same way that we come or else it have been the same character trying to save the same character right so Jesus had to come a different way as we looked at a couple times throughout the last all several months in different parts of the country and so forth preaching I've said this over and over and over again the reason Jesus had to be born virgin born was because the character of God could not be expressed in the fullness through a sex born body he couldn't do it it had to be virgin born amen and that's the whole reason why that we have the Holy Ghost this morning because our hearts are virgin born that's why you got to die first amen amen praise the Lord yes sir you've got to die to yourself in order to be resurrected that's the only way that his character can be manifested in a sex born body so Jesus himself had to be virgin born why because the fall brought through sexual acts and so forth with the servant Eve commit adultery what more that sex act brought us in that condition so Jesus could not come through a sex act himself he had to be created it had to be above the the the natural birth in order to bring on the character of God oh Hallelujah then he said find it must be a different character than that which was lost so God looked down upon his creation the characters of this Earth he said his loving character was molded into the person of Jesus Christ to be the savior of the world Hallelujah Jesus was the very character of God all right tell me about him was he judgmental critical harsh ready to everybody in hell that he met no that's that's people we know in the message amen people we work with that's the boss down the street ready to throw everybody off in hell that don't agree with us now you know what Jesus what kind of character did he manifest tell me church love amen love he manifested love to our dying Humanity this is why his Essence if it's in inside of us will be the same way we won't be ready to throw off on everybody that moves right I think I told you this before if I didn't allow me to tell you again I'm getting ready to preach a message pretty soon the woman at the Well's first day at [Music] church because I would love to hear and see what people would have done the woman at the Well's first day coming to church I imagine they would have whispered and AR you know that woman you know what she's all about you remember that preacher down the road uhhuh she was the piano player come on somebody you imagine what it must have been but Jesus looking at this prostitute he manifested the love of God to her when everybody else would have brought her off in him now if we got that same love in us we must have the same character or something is wrong well I disagree with Sone I don't like sonone I I is that really the character of the love of almighty God is really must be something so much different than that watch now he said it fulfilled the Lord Jesus fulfilled St John 3 and16 God so loved the world that he gave that he gave this love to the world did the love receive it did the world receive it rather this love of God absolutely not the majority of them turned it down everywhere he turned it called him be El but called him this called him that but yet those oh my that have the ability to receive this love they absorbed it that's okay if you don't want it that just means there's more for me God's love his love wases it really want it's okay if somebody else don't want it that just leads more for me amen love moved a mighty God God so Lov the world the unlovable a talk about me he loved the unlovable until he made himself flesh here on the earth and was spit on mistreated laughed at made fun of yeah and yet what did the love of God do in Jesus what did that Agape do inside of his heart father forgive them they don't know what they're doing you can understand deeply why there's going to be many people never make the Rapture you can understand they've got this critical type Spirit about a critical spirit is not of God amen amen you ever look up critical Look up the word critical look up its synonyms hair splitting that's one of them hair splitting with people around the ranks right brother right you say be careful no I'm careful all right but I'm just telling the truth I want to be responsible poor God of telling the truth yes sir yes sir absolutely right yes sir another one of its synonyms being being judgmental harsh yes I'm asking you children is these things the character of almighty God no no such attitude and such behavior is contrary to the very nature that God should have inside of our hearts if we got the Holy Ghost amen being critical and judgmental and harsh and splitting hairs Hallelujah well for was saying you may be the only Amen in this buch for this over with praise the Lord now watch the church in this condition man said God wanting to make love he had to make something lovable I thought y'all was going to get quiet or we quiet you're going to really get quiet now because I'm telling you you're the lovable oh not me brother Ben I'm not lovable God thought you were he thought you were lovable he thought there was something about your heart that he could make love to and because he felt that way Hallelujah God so loved the world that he sent his son into the world you understand when John says that this is an expression of God's love that this propitiation of Jesus being sent into the world there's no way that you and I could even make it out of here except for in that body that human virgin born body that was glorified taken to the right hand of the father that expressed all of God's character down in Jesus that's the only way we make it out of here because we don't make it out of here in our own body because the Bible didn't say by one Spirit we're all baptized into our own body by one Spirit we're all baptized into his body Christ body praise the Lord we're Church come on now we're not baptized into a theology or a Doctrine we're baptized into a person and that person is the Lord Jesus Oh but you said brother being now you went too far calling me The Lovable you don't know me well evidently God did right evidently he knew your inner parts he knew what you're all about yeah but you're saying I'm lovable that's what God thinks I'm not telling you what I think if you you knew me you might not like me at all maybe I don't know H if I really knew the depths of you and the secret parts of you maybe I wouldn't like you but there's one thing about it God liked you and he loved you am oh you said that's just too much I can't receive that you know why because it's easier for us to reject and say that God couldn't possibly love somebody like us than it is to accept that great love of God that's why I tell you one of the biggest things that I deal with more than anything else is people telling me I don't believe God love me because they think in order for God to love them they had to be perfect they had to be sinless they had to be this and that and the other as a matter of fact you could be the biggest scumball on scumbag on the face of the planet and yet God still loves you am amen come on now that's he lovable yes he thought so he thought so he had it in his heart that way that's why he sent Jesus to the world he didn't send Jesus for the purpose of just oh maybe somebody feel sorry about this whole thing and M hear this sad story about Jesus dying at Calvary maybe somebody will want to get saved Down the Road God don't run his business like that he don't run his business hoping make people feel sorry that's why we don't get up here and tell Baptist sermons and try to get everybody crying talk them about how their grandmother died and all we don't bring people to the altar try to get them saved over sad stories right people get saved because they come to truth they come to the word hello that's how we understand who we are are God does not base his love upon your goodness I know that's tough I know it's hard to swallow but it's true well if I was a good person but that has nothing to do with God's love listen to me close if you were born wrong how could you ever be a good person amen that you eat there was day you died you were born sin shape and iniquity came to the world speaking lies you were already born a loser not a winner you were born a loser you already broke the word you were a breaker of God's word the moment you took the breath of life oh sure if you're a baby and under the age of accountability the Holy Ghost will overtake and undertake for such as that we know that but you were born a loser right you were born a sinner you were born a breaker of God's word he that breaks one word is guilty of the whole thing amen right come on the word's amen you can say it ain't going to hurt you come on now children than why why would God demand you be perfect in order to receive his love when he already had it planned out that man would come to the world imperfectly Amen if he already had it fixed in his mind that Eve and Adam was going to fall in the Garden of Eden they were going to leave the word and every person born thereafter would be born subsequently in sin and be born in death if God demanded you to be a perfect person or to be a good person before he showed his love why would God do such a thing and plan man to fall from the very beginning it would seem like God was trapping you so he couldn't love you that's why his love is not dependent on whether I was a good boy today or a good boy tomorrow I was a bad boy today I guess God love me about halfway because it's halfway good oh I told I done told you that no reason you're getting quiet it's hard for you to receive this hard for this to put it inside of your heart oh you say God's love yes God's love but did God love me when I was yet a sinner that's what the Bible say she said brother Ben that's hard for me to swallow but that's okay you're an eagle you got a big throat told God to swallow it right down to the stomach to the toes near amen God wanted to make love you just think of this if Jesus was to walk to your Pew and walk right up by you and say would you worship me would you love me would you show me some praise how many of you would smack him in the face spit on him get away from me hang on everybody but we do the very same thing in our attitude right when the word tries to tell us we're redeemed and we're loved yes come on a Ohio you don't have to sit looking a bunch of Gees I know where I'm at I know what's on I know it's hard to swallow this into your heart but our attitude many times shows him we really don't believe that he loved us un unquestionably you say I know that do you then how come you come to church sit there and beat on yourself the whole time you're in church I'm no good I'm sorry I'm this if he preaches on Kane oh that's me I'm K preaches on Judas I've got to be a Judas you know why you think that way because you haven't really received that love into your heart in the right way right cu you realize that love was shed abroad for you and I without condition amen unconditionally God shed forth his love shed forth his Mercy he never asked for nothing in return if you do I'll do God said I've already done it amen it didn't say if you come to church pay ties and you show up so many services and you you pray for the past that a't what what makes God's love God loved us even we whether we don't do oh come on somebody whether we do it or whether we don't God love me anyways am you say my goodness that's such a hard thing I know that's why I'm preaching I know I know it is simple messages like this I learned a long time ago the reason why people act like they don't want to listen to it is because it's hard for them to receive it they pretend in their mind whenever you go to preaching to people about God's love they just say oh I got it and they just push it away but really the dep depth of it is they haven't really received it like they need to amen that's right oh don't tell me people believe in the message left and right run after this thing and that thing what are they doing it for home splitting up and this thing and that thing happening why is it happening like that because somewhere there's a love problem there's a love issue down inside their heart the prophet of God said the world is dying for love may I go on record this morning and say the message people are dying for love amen preachers are dying for the Sheep are dying for the family dying for life amen and you our men get in a pull pit and preach doctrines and nothing against that right but doctr without knowing who it is that loved you in the first place ain't going to help you with nothing you got to know the man you're studying about loves you uncondition because if you don't know that nothing else is going to help you long hallelujah what good it to drive a car and have the freedom of driving the car when you don't know you got a title right right when you don't own the thing right right it's easier to drive that truck or that you know that pickup or that that Jeep or SUV or whatever is ride it down the road but whenever you miss that monthly payment they ring you up on the phone it makes it drive a little bit different don't it h how much Freedom comes whenever you've made that last payment feels like the steering wheel feels different when you drive it don't it if you ever paid a car off or a house or anything you know what I'm talking about your bed even sleeps a little bit different if you pay a house off or whatever might be right why because you've got confidence this is mine this is mine it's the same way with the Church of the Living God same thing with the message same thing with the Bible a person can never understand or appreciate the depths of God if they don't know the man that they're studying about really loves them oh I wish somebody would help me this morning I told you I'm going to punch that hate devil right in the nose he needs to understand the people of God have been loved by their father before the foundation not just the moment you walked in the church not every time you say am man to the word not every time you're a good boy a good girl but he loved you before the foundation of the world before there was a son or a moon he already loved you always wish somebody would help he loved you already in the very beginning his love was shed abroad for you amen this great fountain bubbling and gurgling and burbling I try to think of the words to make you get the image in your mind right right just like that bubbling and that Fountain just bubbling by just gurgling and belching with the different little sounds all the love of God every bit of it the love of God his love shed abroad do you realize the whole reason we're in a world tonight the whole reason we have wood and carpets and trees and sunshine God was wanting to make love to somebody amen yes sir amen do we love him do we really love him like we should do we love him in the way of our attitude of knowing that no matter what's going on our life This Man Called Jesus Loves Me Hallelujah listen we haven't got there yet it's time for us to get there if we'd haven't got there we think like a child we speak like a child we act like a child it's time for us to grow up you know how it is with these youngans they do something wrong and you whip them they'll pout and stop off to their room daddy don't even love me you know what that is that's a child same thing with you and I we start going through trials and going through problems and this and that oh Jesus don't love me but that's a child as a child acting that way but when you begin to grow up in God you realize when a trial comes along it ain't because daddy don't love you oh my Hallelujah but it's because Daddy's trying to prove that you're made of stuff the devil can't BL come on you realize when you become a man are you grow up in Christ that when than come your way they don't come your way because God hates you they come because he's trying to show his glory to you brother said like this God wants to surprise you surprise his wife with a gift Glory he puts you through something you'll go through a really really difficult and hard time and you'll think man my world's about to fall in but what you don't realize at the end of that trial God's got a big surprise gift waiting on you but if we have love and we have the right kind of understanding of love then we begin to understand God wanted to make something lovable that he could make love to I love this statement right here brother says he had to make something that of his own nature you couldn't love nothing that wasn't of your own nature loving has to unite with love yes so how else are we going to make the grave in this last day if we don't have the same type of lovable nature that Christ St himself Colossians chap 1 21-22 I read this to you last time I was here preaching on the guilt message but allow me to say it again tonight or this morning brother yes you were sometimes alienated in enemies in your mind but what did God do his enemy you slapped him on One Cheek you presented the other you took his coat and give you a cloak is treated his enemy I was his enemy when I was a sinner right now if he would have treated me based on my behavior as a sinner and he would have responded to me in the way of I my feeling as a sinner he would have never done no more with me to quit fooling with me walked off and left me thank God he had love for me even when I was there because if that love me right brother that I would have never been able to walk right on in the things of God because he said hey you gonna treat me that way fooy on you that's the way that a lot of people get in their mind the way God is oh but he's not that way see we were alienated we were enemies in our mind by Wicked works but he reconciled us see he reconciled Us in his body in his body to present you holy remember what John said by this love was manifested that Christ sent his son so in his body of Flesh through death I was presented to be unblamable unreprovable in his sight God so the way that even looks at me is different amen the way he sees me is different praise the Lord look at this in perfect faith brother man said God came down in that muck well brother Ben I you know I was raised in the church I was raised in the message I was it doesn't matter you was in the muck like everybody else was amen long as you're a sinner you're in M that's right I've had people tell me oh brother Ben you know you don't know what it's like to be in the world I sat by two preachers sometime ago and these two men just I was ashamed of actually they sat and bragged about what they used to do in the world you brother you don't know nothing about the world I know what it's like to run with women and drink and get some drunk here I thought Lord have mercy I just made this remark like this I said I may not have known physically and I may not known naturally what it was to drink and rum with women and everything else in the world but I do know this I know that if the Bible said he is a judger and a discerner of the thoughts and the intentions of a man's heart I was just as guilty is arrested them guys because I intended to do everything they were doing my intention was if I get the opportunity I'm gonna do thus and thus and thus and thus and th that was inside of this old Wicked heart so if God judges a Man based on his intentions I'm just as guilty is AR rest right amen raised in the church M yes God came down in the muck amen glory I I don't know I I've always been a good person mck the Bible even said our righteousness is what filthy rags for this sister I don't want to be offensive or sound ugly but you know what that rag represents that's the that's the monthly rag right that's what God looks at our righteousness right forgive me the truth God looks right down at us and sees our righteousness and say you think that's something ain't nothing how can you have righteousness when you was born a breaker of the law right right was born a breaker of the word that's right brother see what she said that a created a perfect love in our hearts he said look what happened what somebody did somebody loved you Somebody Loved Me amen oh I just love this right here I like this little remark said one of the greatest hindrances in the church today that's kept the Revival back is the lack of Godly love that Christ expressed when he was here on there that's what's kept the Revival off of people because they just don't love God like they ought to Amen brother and they don't love one another like they ought to hey brother I promise you if you don't fall in love with Jesus it doesn't matter how hard you try or how much you memorize or what you do if you're not really in love with him folks will last old about like about like summer and spring and fall coming on right there'll be a season and then they're gone why why do people go for just a little while the Bible didn't say he that that in that begins the race but it's he that endures to the end that's the ones that will be saved because if you're not really in love with him in this message somewhere something will cross your path that'll make you turn the other direction hey a few years ago we might not have thought that but look what's happened amongst us the last four or five years things that we never would have dreamed taking place amongst us why because people really was not in love with God preaches pastoring churches for years and years and turn around walking off leave preaches preaching all over the place turny on walking off and leave why they was in love with being able to preach they was in love with being able to do things but if they was really in love with God it wouldn't really matter amen amen that's what I said about different preachers when they they reach a spot where they disqualify themselves from the pull pit many times they backslide all together I said if that man really loved God even though he couldn't preach he'd sat down still serve the Lord that's right amen brother yes sir praise the Lord somebody yes somebody disqualified thems by being a deacon or something of that nature and they just get up walk off leave the church that goes to prove they was wasn't in love with God they was in love with a church or a physician come on now because if they're in love with God it doesn't matter what comes their way they say Lord if I got to go into heaven with one less arm one less eye one less leg I want to make it amen oh and can I tell you something right here in aan Ohio it doesn't matter to me if Heaven is an Doby mud hut as long as Jesus is there that's what makes it heaven for amen because I'm not going to heaven because of streets of gold Gates of pearl or an angel choir I'm going to heaven because I love the man that created the place for me amen that's what'll make it heaven to me brother but does God love us does what the Bible say so I wish he'd prove it he does we're just not paying attention right brother right we're not really looking in the right places right well how do I know God love me did you wake up this morning yes sir yes sir amen got air in your lungs brain function beginning to wonder about a few of you this morning well if all of that God give you another opportunity to serve him it proves that he loves you thank you Jesus it's like the little sign I saw on the wall I think it's here in the church God's mercies are new every morning why because he loves us amen hallelujah beautiful it's hard for us to receive that because we had an uncle or we had an ant or we had a somebody that was mean to us right God must be the same type of person but he's not right cuz your aunt your uncle had conditions why they didn't love your mom and dad had conditions why they didn't love but God has no conditions like that that ought to straightened it out right there that ought solved it right there on the spot Jesus did not have that kind of love that Earthly type love it's easy to love somebody that loves you yes yes preach itach it sir let that straight a minute it's easy if somebody loves me oh I love them is that the same way with God yeah couldn't he turn right around and say oh it's easy for me to love soldiers because they love me but what about the unlovable that he still loveed yes this is why his wisdom and his understanding of things that's why that Eternal wisdom of God we'll never be able to figure out because you understand it's no mystery how I can love him the mystery is how can he love me GL amen God's love he didn't have this AAL love you scratch my back I'll scratch yours that's not the love of God God said whether you scratch or I'm gonna scratch yours anyways Lord God in his own Mercy he sought this bride even when she was unlovable when you was sitting on the bar stool whever where you was the Holy Ghost looked down and said come here Gabriel see that boy right there yeah I love him but he's got a beer in his hand doesn't matter I'm not looking at that right there amen he said dirty words I'm not I'm not looking at the dirty words I'm looking at the sun cuz that's one of my sons down there he might be covered over in muck and fil but I'm going to go down in that muck and I'm GNA pull him out I'm GNA go right down into the oh I wish somebody would say Glory I'm gonna go right down into the F yes I'm gonna pull that boy out of that mess amen not going to leave him down there cuz he can't I'm not going to leave him to shift for himself while he's down in that mess I can he cannot help himself in that condition so if I don't show my love to him he'll never get out me it'll get worse he'll go from one thing to another to another but if I go down in that muck I can get him out of and keep him out of it amen people wonder sometimes how they're going to quit how they're going to stop it's not you that does the stopping it's not you that does the quitting amen but it's the love of God that he show in the beginning to get you out of the mess is determined to keep you out of it Glory Hallelujah thank you God loved his enemies thank you Lord well the world was unlovable oh my think of it God still loved the world yes yes the thing of it is Friends the human mind without the inspiration of the Holy Ghost don't know what compassion really means this is why there was no word in any language for the word love God's agape love until the Holy Spirit revealed it around the time of Jesus and Paul he comes and says a why would he say such a word why would he say such a thing because he wanted to show us what the essence of his love was yes sir amen oh Hallelujah makees sure you want go sit in the corner and cry for a while don't to think of such great love like that watch him in 1 Corinthians 13 can we turn there again yes sir I don't normally read this but I just feel led to this morning just by the leadership of the Lord so I like to keep my Bible right by me because I never know when my boss is going to say let's look at the blueprint a minute pick it up at verse one let's pick this up about this love of God watching though I speak with tongues of men and angels have not Char I become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol though I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries well that puts message people in a spot don't it right right and all knowledge though I have all faith I can remove mountains and have not charity I'm nothing can I say something to you can I give you a real example yes though brother Bram could create squirrels so he could speak to the storm though he could had her sons though he could have faith dump truck loads of crutches could go down to the ocean sing and only believe in a foreign tongue from all the hundreds of thousands that was healed through the campaigns if William Brandon didn't have love he'd have been a s brass in a tin see to me brother and sister what made this prophet of God such a great man was not these great things we just read down through here not the fact that he could go to pray for a blind girl that had no eyeballs she was blind because she didn't have eyeballs and it could stop right when he started to pray and say oh sister dear I forgot to ask you what color eyes do you want right she said I want blue eyes God give this little girl blue eyes and the Holy Spirit create blue eyes right in her head if she'd have said pinkle you know how children are if she said purple pink and Polkka doed she'd had purple pink and Polkka doted eyes because that's what God would have obeyed amen the commands of his son would have done just exactly like they prayed for yes sir yes sir that's not what made brother Bram a great man to me what stuck out to me more than anything else about William Bram was how much he was in love love of the man called the Lord Jesus Christ and how that love translated to other people and how he lived his life for others amen amen you realiz a prophet of God said when you live your life for somebody else you are standing in the vestibule of Heaven that's the love I'm talking about the essence of God's love hallu amen though iow all my goods to feed the poor get my body to be burned and I have not charity it profiteth me nothing why because charity suffers long it's kind it vaunteth not itself I guarantee those are a few little qualities that I'd like to see more of in mess churches amen amen i' like to see kind people in mess churches yes sir I'd like to see some kind people because folks just ain't nice no more yeah am praise the Lord unless you're eating Cheerios with angels I'm sure not rub shoulders with the world like you do right right everywhere saman and I go we meet but people that are just not kind but charity makes you kind makes you kind makes you sweet makes you a gentleman makes you a lady yes just a little further here I'll close ain't going to be no two hours today like it was yesterday that was a special time Rejoice not in iniquity just skip it down you just follow through bearing all things believing all things charity never fails we know in part prophesy in part when that which is perfect is come and he said when I was a child I spake as a child and then it caps it off with these three faith hope and charity that's beautiful beautiful so a person wants they go from faith and they grow up into the stature of a perfect man and that perfect man is not me that perfect man is Christ amen amen the Apex of my walk with God is the Capstone of perfect life yes how do I know I have arrived to maturity if I can look back and see the action of love and see it live through me brother Jesse I know I have arrived as as as an adult I can say I thought as a child spake as a child understood as a child but now I'm mature don't think me strange but I look down at this and I realize that what I'm seeing in my life I'm seeing the manifestation of that love of God coming through my heart I'm seeing it more and more and more more why because at one time I used to think when I got in trouble that God didn't love me but now I realize when I get in trouble it's because he does love me that I'm in trouble beautiful like I said to you want see last time Psalm 23 The Lord is my shepherd everybody wants him to lay him down by still pastures and so forth like that but nobody wants a rod or correction but he can't be our Shepherd unless he's going to correct us at the same time as play is down Green Pastures are wonderful but his rod and staff is part of him being my beautiful Glory praise the Lord my that's right see all they're talking about natural love that's what Paul was talking about here give your body to be burned that's natural love people can love so much that they'll give their life for another person that's natural love but Agape goes even beyond that amen Oh my he said that's natural affection instead of the Divine revelation of the will of God how do I really know I've got his love in my heart I can obey what he tells me how do I know it's there because I can do what he said amen when I get to the spot to where I can obey him unquestionably that my love has arrived at a spot to where I'm where I need to be Hallelujah but God says do this I go I still got some work to do yes sir yes sir praise the Lord church amen wonderful praise the Lord wonderful if I get to the spot to where he said the word say do it this way and I say that's going to hurt somebody's feelings Lord do it that way if I've got God's love he said do it that way buckle up everybody here we go and I do it that way doesn't matter if it hurts or not it might matter to me humanly it might matter to me affectionately don't want to hurt people and don't want to say things that rub people the wrong way like a fell said to me a little bit ago he said brother B he said I want to tell you something right now I said yes sir he said you trying to get people to say man that offends people I said it offends me they won't I said two12 of the other brother I said we're supposed to be worshiping God in the house of God not sitting like a bunch of sticks and I know if you don't get your mouth open you can't eat praise the Lord but you understand the Divine love of God will make you do things that even offends people because you know it's for their benefit yes sir hey Jesus has done things to me that offended me yes yes Ah that's strange is it yes sir certain things the Lord's done to me has offended me when God asked me to move to Tennessee offended me and God wanted me to leave my home right right wo y'all getting quiet on me true as a human I was offended but God's love knew offense or not I'm leading you in the right direction yes yes and one preacher said here not long ago and I don't mean to bring up trash out of the out of the trash pile but just to give you a good example like one man said brother man call women dog me I could never do that I could never get away with I say because you don't love them if you knew I loved you I could punch you right Square in the nose and You' get up all right brother Ben thank you what was that for if people knew that I loved you now you know I mean not literally of course but if you take that word and scale it back I mean just scale them people know you love them you can tell them the truth they'll come back and hear what you got to say right why they don't because they know deep in their heart you really don't love you can't Bluff Humanity friends if a man don't mean what he says people pick up on it they know that's why I figured out a long time ago don't be nobody just be B they'll understand that I figure that you got a 50/50 you can light Me Or Hate Me One the right but the love of God will sometimes cause you to come to the pull pit and put brass knuckles on your fingers right brother right that's what brother B said sometimes skin them to the Bone that's what brother BR said wow wow the Bible tells us he who he loves he rebukes and he chases yes you understand when people don't don't get that part of God when they think that God's being mean to them it's because they think as a child understood as a child speak as a child but when they grow up they realize when preaching comes their way that really challenges them they think thank you Lord Jesus you love me enough to give me another step I can step up amen this is the essence of God's love his Essence his character is love praise the Lord yes sir let's stand again yes sir Hallelujah adoption part four paragraph 104 thus sayith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place that's right no matter how many religious demonstrations no matter how many Good Deeds you've done or whatever you done that won't count nothing on that day right right he'll take perfect love lay aside everything else amen until you're so filled with the love of God watch how this goes so you can love those that hate you it's amazing to me that these words would be sandwiched as it were together that he would say God is of love love one another little children as the father hath loved you for God is of love he turns right around and said God is love you understand I cannot say I love him if I don't like you if I don't have love for you I don't have a feeling in my heart for you as the people of God then how can I say I love him when the very God that loved me is the same God that loved you so how could I have something against you when he loved you and yet I say I love him right yes wonderful Wonder scratch my back I'll scratch yours Grace is Grace says your back's itch and I'll scratch it anyhow whether you scratch mine or not right right exactly right that's the real love of God Matthew 5 he said resist resist not evil yeah but can we do it can we can we become those kind of people I think we can with God's love in our heart we start developing a feeling and an understanding for others because when you reach a spot in the Lord where you realize where he brought you from then it's easy for you to look at somebody else and realize I was there a few years ago amen that's where I was at some time ago in my life if God had mercy on me he can have mercy on you gory GL amen Glory this is what's held the Revival back not for the nation i r read you this morning it's over sh Nationwide Revival is out but this is what holds up individual revivals and what I want more than anything else I want an individual Revival in my heart I want this word to so live inside of my heart inside of my life until it changes even the way that I think about certain circumstances if I can receive his love in my heart it will make that change if I can receive but if I can't oh my that it's just the same old chasing Robin Hood's barn and the whole deal but if I can receive this love into my heart I know if I can receive his love me who was unlovable that he loved me if I can get that right then it will make me turn and love the unlovable myself beautiful and that unlovable might be your spouse that might be a father or a mother or a cousin or a boss yes sir amen let's pray heavenly father thank you for your word this morning Lord Jesus God I know this has been just a simple little old thought but lord it's got some power in it if we'll receive it I believe Lord as we've listen to the things of God this morning I believe that you've been able to help the people to yes Jes see what this love of God's all about to see what your essence really is I pray my Lord that the Holy Ghost would just come down today and take this word and plant it deep into our hearts Lord Jesus that we can become the kind of people Lord that would be so pleasing I I don't want to be just a child Lord yes just walk around every time something goes along thinking you're against me or you hate me but Lord I want to have such a feeling in my heart to know you love me unconditionally yes Lord hallelujah thank you my Lord help us and bless us in this way we pray in the name of Jesus Jesus Christ amen would your have heads bowed just a moment I just wonder if you'd just like to be recognized before the Lord this morning say brother Ben I it is hard for me to receive these kind of things and I want his help as I want this thing to go out of my heart I want to be different from today on Hallelujah God bless each hand going out I want to be different today Lord I want to be able to receive this great love into my spirit my heart hallelujah amen I've played games with it too long I've been brought to a showdown today and I want to be different yes Jes Hallelujah my hands going up everywhere let's just pray together again Lord Jesus heavenly father I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that Satan would just love to steal this out of their hearts as Lord God the devil our adversary stands before us telling us all have you felt this way many times before what good did it do you but Lord Jesus if you'll help us to let go of human ability and the thought that we can do anything about it won't you come down lord Jesus and just do a work in US Lord that will change this part of oursel forever that Lord these things the way we look at it you'll help us to look in a different view of it not to see you as a dictator or judge but to see you as someone who loves us who cares for us Lord is that a man tell me in Arizona just the other day preaching on this very thought brother Ben you'd be surprised but here I am an old man and all these years I never thought that God really loved me Lord I thought here's a man sat around around the ranks for all these years Lord how Satan moves inside of people in their minds or Spirits puts thoughts plants thoughts inside of them and a little subtle thing that people don't recognize but yet it lays there in the human conscience but deep down they really don't believe that Jesus loves them in that way oh they know that you loved them enough to save them but somehow deep in their hearts they feel they're fitted for Destruction God help us help us Lamb of God let it be that a change will occur Lord that you will not only clean out our consciences but clean out our subconscious All the Little Seeds of the devil lord May May there be May there be ground turned over Hallelujah may you come with a great tiller of your word in your spirit may you te up the ground and take out them old seeds of discrepancy Lord Jesus may we be planted a new with the word that's been preached today you love us you love us Lord as I said if you came down to each of our seats asking us to worship you to love you which one of us would smack you in the face of course we'd say no but if our attitude is such that we just really don't believe you love us we don't enter into the word we don't enter into worship we don't enter into praise we don't enter into singing All These Little Things They prove that somewhere deep inside of us we're just not convinced yet let it change us this morning the word I mean let it change us permanently I pray in the name name of the Lord Jesus for each of your believing children do a lifechanging work here this morning Lord and Lord though they may not feel maybe a certain thing happen maybe the evidence would present itself in the way that they would feel or see later maybe as they come back to church tonight they notice might be subtle but maybe they would notice they feel different in their worship yes Lord they feel different the way they praise when they said amen that time it just felt better somehow than it did before God let him recognize this because you've done a work here this morning that things are different maybe that person that would cut them off on the road this afternoon or on the way home or something that feeling that used to raise up in their heart they have a different thought that comes behind it now a little bit more merciful a little bit more gracious Lord let them know that's because the work has been accomplished today lord it's been kind of a little bit of a more of a my it's been a difficult service in one way not because of the people but the material what's being preached it's hard for us to receive this Lord help us do so today Lord in Jesus name I pray amen everyone now let's just raise our hands to him let's just thank him just love him in our own way let's just thank him now for doing a work inside our hearts Lord Jesus I know from today on I'm going to be a different person hallelujah praise the Lamb of God praise the Lamb of God hallelujah hallelujah thank you Lord Jesus praise be to the Lamb of God don't be ashamed I just put your hands right up here just say Lord Jesus I give you worship that's what you taught us in your

series on God Delights in his children I don't know if you remember that but the Bible says the Lord Delights in his people the Lord Delights in all them that fear Him and them that love him he Delights in his Praises he rejoices over Zion and Israel as a bridegroom there's so many wonderful promises in the the word of the Lord the Bible says that he loves those who seek Him the Bible said he Delights in the prayers of the upright so if you pray today if you try to live upright today if you're trying to see God today he loves that amen and he loves you praise God is that wonderful church amen trying as hard as we can here with all of our human effort here all diligence the Bible says give all diligence to make your calling election sure as we give that to God surely he loves it
