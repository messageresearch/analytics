you might be glorified we love you Lord ministered out to us in Jesus Christ in church said hey that guy misses the sticker Bibles to Revelation chapter 2 verse 18 relation to 18 like to be in the Thyatira church 8 tonight for interchange making pretty good progress here so happy to get to the fourth trilogy I've already preached to seven back in 2015 but I'll probably appreciate it or maybe some parts of it did the highlights of it but you let's get there by God's grace book truly enjoying this series and hope it's not a lesson to you it's been a tremendous encouragement to me I want to show the course again as usual God's grace revelation 2:18 as you can tell there's a lot more scriptures you know for this church age than the previous church change so just read let's just read the first two 18 and 19 let's read that together the speed at 1 2 3 and unto the Angel of the church in Thyatira write these things saith a son of God who had his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass I know thy works and charity and service and faith and I patience and I verse and the last be more than the first amen blessing his Rivas word may raise a little so look at this top your tonight and I just want to say thanks to about amen with another Pope song service but I really enjoyed that thank you sir I was wonderful thank you maybe I'd be that if we could I was gonna ask you we could sing one more song again we're going to enjoy this on the loveless Lake that was his go ahead I just love that song if you could maybe even Syrian or willing if I remember I might forget you know if your number than be a blessing so let's look at the Thyatira in church age night are you happy to be the house of Lord tonight I kind of want to beat anywhere else but be in God's house praise God and to again hear the word of the Lord so let's look at this history part one I imagine as I was looking for the notes that I have about maybe five or six sermons on this by the grace of Lord if you listen to him now on the nineteen sixty tapes this is the shortest one prior to your church age is only like a two-hour sermon very short back I just finished it today Oh real slowly through it you know how about twenty minutes in the car here twenty minutes in the car here I get two studies home forty five minutes our gear are there so all the way through it what a tremendous message it was but it's one of the shortest but man he has to cut it short he said because he was a tiny bit hoarse he kinda fit the sermons yours oh I understand the heart throat's a little so our source or so just a reminder here we've now preached the first research ages and also the last by God's grace but now we're the port this is the longest church age 914 years almost a thousand years and this is what's often consider the dark ages as you know or the medieval times as many of you know if you've done a history class or college class or something this is called the Dark Ages so we're here now Columba this is a strange choice as a church age messenger which we'll talk about in just a minute but again here's the here's the time that we're looking at by God's grace here's the summary brother Brandon gifts this is the night after he actually preached the Thyatira he didn't eat him preview that night when he preached the Thyatira church as he was the next night there in the sardian church age he previewed it or summarized a rather summarized and the for church age was Thyatira Columba being the age of the church age the messenger 606 to 1520 and the church age was papal seducing the Dark Ages was last night if you know the dark ages and the reward was power to rule over the nation's and the Morningstar to the angel that's also to every believer power to rule the nation's I can't wait to get to that dock you realize that church if you rule over sin doubt your rule over nations and later and many Jesus has very few will find it see there's going to be plenty of laying the rule over all right why because there's very few that actually overcame we want to be one of those by God's grace so what do you do Jesus the Bible said lay up beside every sit and run the race with perseverance amen let aside everything else make Christ your number one desire amen so again as we said I just want to show that again that's the summary papal seducing and how does he do it he does it through the spirit of Jezebel right Loran said it bands from Balaam to Jezebel of course Jezebel's Roman Catholic Church he says so just to give you an idea but it shows you the same spirit that was in Jezebel is now in the Roman Catholic Church but this is when it really took ahold and number one Jezebel do first she killed all the true prophets well not all the most of them and she set up idols in the true temple of God and then she built her own temples of idols and everything and that's exactly what the Roman Catholic Church hid in this church age on a grand scale so Jesus was very prophetic of this church age when he had John write that in 1896 he's very prophetic looking down through the hundreds and 2,000 years of time in a thousand years of time to see what was going to happen near this church age but he was still with them anyway despite the awful Dark Ages there was still a little bit of light every her brother Rams at this age was darker than our age now why is it darker because in the evening time they shall be light we got a little more light because we've got the full revelation of the word amen but this was the darkest age where there was hardly any light hardly any truth the darkest age tire tear now remember on top here's the church age again I just have different you can see the church age behind there I just put the seals remember on top of it and it lines up very very well so the first seagull of course was the white horse but the lion anointing helped overcome so that white anointing that deception last into the second church age but then brother Rams that he jumped off the white and got into a bloody red during that second church age when he could start killing right he can start killing the Christians his church and state were uniting and that lasted quite a while into the church age we're now going to teach on them now remember if you look up history when did the indulgences start it was around the year 980 that's why I put them this dark anointing the Black Horse anointing sorry right before you know the thousand year mark there that's when because that's when he's captured the wealth of the world so went from deception to killing to capturing the wealth of the world through indulgences right Inquisition all kinds of conquering and the Crusades remember that all that took place there this black a-19 time and then the eagle anointing come at the end time to combat this spiritual death that we have now now remember church that's not my idea that's the state the Lord it's not my dear brother Graham talk that and he said the vision of the seals plus the word plus the history plus the church and ages it all blends together he said plus the Word of God the revision the revelation interpretation is the stay at the Lord that's not my smartness that's not me trying to be a scholar that's the Holy Ghost telling us exactly what to look for in this hour you believe that amen so much so that member after after brother Graham got done preaching this at night at 1961 he actually finished it the Holy Spirit came and did this chose that this light shadow - that one - that one - that one did that one - this one on the wall the tabernacle there was a 300 witnesses their mother Graham said and I've indicated that this was the truth of God exactly the right and we got it on tape you can listen to I played it a few times here I think recently I think I played it one time I just can't member a little tired tonight Barry with me oh so let's start with the city of Thyatira we're just going broke up quickly through this fire tears right here hey in modern-day Turkey so we had Ephesus Severna Pergamos if you remember her most became the literal seat of Satan during that church age but that had moved to Rome moved west her own it literally became the seat of Satan okay that's where the Babylonian ruler Attalus went after they after he was defeated in Iraq he moved to Pergamos history shows that so the literal seat of Babylon went from Iraq to Turkey up to Rome right now we're in the fourth church age so I got another reading to do but just just some background historically the city of Thyatira was the least noteworthy of all the seven cities of Revelation it was situated on the confines of my Isha and Iona I'm sorry I oh yeah it was surrounded by many rivers but they're all for the bleaches it's most commendable be true was that it was a well it was well off financially used with the corporate guilds of potters Tanner's Weaver's dyers ropemaker's etc it was from this city that Lydia the seller of purple came interested I've never got opened her heart amen now the reason that the spear chose this city as the one already containing the spiritual elements for the fourth age was because of its religion okay so another Church ages you know the actual city itself had something do with it most it wasn't because the finances of fire tear it was because of this spiritual condition the major religion of fact here was the worship of Apollo ty Rimini Oh Sinestro seda which was joined of the Emperor worship cult this is what kind of churches they had Apollo was the Sun God and the next little power to his father Zeus he Apollo communicated his knowledge of the future and his father's will to men through the prophets and Oracle's the entire tear this ritual was conducted by a prophetess who sat on a tripod chair and delivered the messages while in trance they would go to church and they would wait to this woman God entranced and then she would spew forth these thoughts and then they would all they'd all worship it's all God spoke to us Apollo spoke to us you know Zeus come to us through Apollo and then through this woman just awful now look what the goal history says my grandfather's history the hold of this religion wasn't remarkable but I'd say like this our hold on our religion is more remarkable right because something keeps holding you at I tonight amen it's God's Spirit now but see the Spirit of Devil's held them strongly they straw a beliefs order this church why do they strongly support this church well that's reading its power did not like screw silly in the rental mystery but later in the fact that no one come along to the Guild's which offer the people they're living see either you know whether you are a temp sorry basket maker or weaver whatever you were so your work was connected to the church see that so they connected which offer the people their living unless they belong to the temple worship Apollo's overs you can't have a job in our town unless you belong to our church that's why it was so was such a stronghold anyone who refused to join in the idolatrous feasts and license orgies was barred from these first century unions in order to be a part of the social and commercial life one had to be a practicing pagan idolatry and that awful this was the city that Christ listened to this city most resembles the Dark Ages he believed that now we don't have time to go through it but you know how much awful sexual sin was in the Roman Catholic Church and the Pope's popes were famous for having mistresses adulterers bastard children it's all chronicled in history and a lot of it came during this term so you know there's a lot of conspiracy theories out there but a lot of them are true a lot of it were true I don't like to be a conspiracy theorist you know but a lot of the things about the Roman Catholic Church are true in fact I was listening to it today I'm reading it today Revelation 16 and 17 did you know the Vatican is going to be destroyed because they're guilty of all the murders of all the martyrs of Christ so every murder of a Christian ultimately goes back to the spirit behind the Roman Catholic Church it don't even have to be the Roman Catholic Church it has to be that but it has to be that sphere behind it which is that dominating Spirit is that right now so what's fair to got in the Muslims you got that dominating spirit see it's the same spirit just a different disguise every single into the Hat I hope you see that it's the same spirit because it wants to dominate and kill and destroy any true believer with it so see that's why it all goes back to that because it's the same spirit it might have a different mass start a different church sale on it different shrine date or whatever what is the sustained even power because all the wrath of God gets poured out upon that mother of harlots mother of it all she started it all and she's got daughters say that that's right so see look at this awful that's why Jesus chooses this city is this city is going to have the same characteristics and a t56 it had the same characteristics as the Dark Ages would have six hundred to a thousand years later can everybody see that by God's grace now this is what was happening spiritually and physically in the Roman Catholic Church during that time and of course all their daughter churches now let's fight off on those of these words you know are pretty pretty awful but that's history that we just have to kind of have to understand that and you have to say thank God for His grace that we can live above that amen thank God for grace now the age and the messenger you're probably familiar with this the age course I hear interchange with that the messenger was Columba remember the least amount of life was during this time because the Koroma Catholic Church had power the history says they try to destroy all the Bible's they try to take all the Bible's away from the people and they try to keep such control over it again as we talked about we'll get into the we'll get into the indulgences is that everything they try to do to pervert the Word of God and they have control over the people that's a picture of Columba there now what's interesting as I said what's interesting about this age is that there was so dark the messenger wasn't even born during the age he was before the age so if you look it up in history Columba lived from right here he lived from 521 to 596 so he died 10 years before the age actually started because it was such a dark age let the random search history and he could find nobody in this age that had signs wonders and miracles and the Holy Ghost and stayed away from organization this is the closest man to the age I want you to know this man did a powerful thing he was a mighty missionary full of the Holy Ghost and so what I'm saying is that even though he didn't live in the age the effects of his ministry went for the entire nine hundred years because of the kind of servant of God that he was I don't have all the history on here but one of the things I don't have on here this is how he this is how he converted the whole country of Scotland can you imagine converting a whole country that's what he did here's how I did it he would he would pray and God would anoint him and twelve other men and him in the twelve men would go into an area and they would just start a city and people you know people are out in the remote areas would come to the city and the whole city would be Christians then with Holy Ghost and then the heathens would come in and see the city and feel the love and people getting converted every signs miracles wonders and that's how he did it he would go then he'd go to be pray and get twelve more believers go to the next place twelve more and keep spreading the gospel and he was a mighty missionary and that was his main missionary technique game that he's to do a church play you would go there plant a church and build the city around a bunch of Christians they met and God blessed it abundantly rich usually so much so that he's even in Britannica he's known this is they didn't say nothing about his miracles in Britannica like they did Martin Martin was even listed some of the miracles it's the Martin's life in the projector but this is all said basically the missionary traditionally credited with the main role in conversion of Scotland to Christiana the whole whole country which is quite amazing here's oh brother madam says about 60 years after the death of st. Patrick Columbo was born in North Ireland to the royal family of Fergus he became a brilliant consecrated scholar committing to memory most of the scriptures imagine that memorizing most of the body God hauled him in the audible voice of the omission area after he had heard the voice of God nothing could stop them you like that amen oh I've served my heart they met once you heard the voice of God hell is going to talk to you either praise God nothing will stop you and God answers your prayer like for me I like sides you'll God get me a cider there's my sign right there ah you know when God gives you a side nothing can stop you after that Hey praise God when I ask God but add my scotch I be a preacher now I want to share this for you guys no I said God give me a side I prayed a passage I went to church preached at Lima and God gave me a tongue and interpretation before I do priests and then God built the altar afterwards I'd have to die anymore God and answer my prayer so I don't doubt anymore I preach and I don't doubt should I give it up I don't doubt because he already spoke to the priest God after I seen got into my prayer we should not doubt anymore you and I should not doubt once God proves his will to us he met his miraculous ministry has caused many historic stories to claim him next to the Apostles just like Martin Martin Columbo were some of the most highly revered men of God throughout the entire 2,000 year church changes so break was his ministry with a supernatural size following that some have thought the accounts were exaggerated because they were so supernatural here's one story he approached the walled city from the gates barred against him he lifted the voice prayer that God intervened a lot of access to people in order to preach as he prayed the court magicians began to harass him with loud noises then he began to sing a song as he said God so increased the volume of his voice that he drowned out the cries of the heathen suddenly the gates burst open on their own accord he entered in and preached the gospel when he met you through the lawyer that's not that's that's just like the Bible member Peter got an escort right out of jail and the doors just flew open that's my Bible that's he was living in Bible days we're living in Bible days that's not hard to be that's what the Bible says even a god is that for Peter not that it for Joshua you know the walls of Jericho God can do anything he another occasion when he was also shot from a village as he turned awaited a part of the son of a chief suddenly became violently ill even unto death Saint Columba was quickly sought after and recalled when he prayed the prayer of faith the boy was instantly healed the village was then open to evangelism by the gospel he pen those are the two stories by the RAM puts in the church age book so powerful stories a bed the man which is a missionary minded and a true servant of the Lord now we'll get into a few slides on the citation it's a verse 18 so let's go into that by God's grace I just I'll probably just have time for the salutations and I pardon I'll get my watch here okay let me set the timer just real quick here by God's grace I don't wanna go over to month and I do that is because I get so worn out you know I gotta watch myself here okay the revelation I'm sorry let's read a these things say for some of God who have his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet are like fine brass remember perhaps that Jesus always introduced him to the age with his deity so this is something only deity can do only the DD can only be the Son of God the deity has only one who has eyes like in the flame of fire and deities as feet that are like fine brass the head this Josie is deity he is God the revelation of Godhead to the father to your age is that Jesus is the Son of God once in the days of his flesh he was known as to some man but henceforth we know him no more after the flesh he's no longer the son of man the great prophet who hid himself gathered together all prophecies and that's what the Bible said from henceforth we know no man after the flesh egg though we have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more so how do we know now we know by the Holy Spirit that's why it's so critical to be able to hear the voice of God in every age what does he say he that knows of the the face of the son of man he that had to hear that in here with the spirit say to the churches because now he's in spirit form amen we don't know about their flesh like open it here see the nail scars in my hand see I'm the son of God that's not how he works he works by can you hear what the spirits trying to tell you man that's how he works out we don't know it after flesh body we know him after the Holy Spirit and memorize you hear the voice of God it was that still small voice when he got alone in his prayer closet the still small boy spoke to him God help us to get the prayer closet amen to hear the voice of God the only thing I miss back in the bosom of the Father that's where Christ is now he's in the bosom or heart of the Father remember he's in father's invisible now we know if F if not we known after the parvis resurrection he is risen and has taken unto himself his mighty power and his above all and over all to the praise of his own glory his glory he will not share with another his leadership over the church he will not surrender to any man glory he looks down upon Thyatira and here he sees in that city and in that port age the honor which belongs to him only bestowed upon another so see this is why he has eyes like fire because he's looking now a fighter tear and they're given all the praise to a pope that's why the Bible City is looking down with eyes a fighter his eyes blazed with the fire of Wrath and judgment as he sees Apollo revered as the God when he alone is the only begotten son of the Father and they replace the son of God with Apollo right but later you see the next slide he talks about how the Pope took the place of Apollo eventually how awful must is judgment upon the religion of the fire to an age where in the church members like the pagan worshippers of the son of god Apollo the son of Zeus elevate a human ruler to adoration backed by the power of the state for that is exactly what he saw so now we know why he's looking with eyes afire because the age has replaced the son of God with the son of Zeus he says the Roman Catholic Church fully immersed in idol worship based upon the rights of the Sun God of autumn had elevated a man to actual deity the Pope through the marriage of the church to the state for Thomas Aquinas and alvrez of Elijah's formulated and say to them here's what they said these famous church fathers apparently but they're not our Father or not not our father's mother gravely was able to be our Father in the gospel right I mean no Paul was the father of the gospel I was saying he said you have many teachers but not many fathers so we have a father the bacons brother branham but we don't walk around saying father grandfather grandfather random because jesus said call no man father you see that okay so see we have a right to look back and say okay here's a father of our faith for our church age but we don't have a right to sit there call father father father because that's blessed right what's blasphemy speaking evil God because what do they call the Pope now Holy Father Obama's called him that trumps call him that hillary clinton's calling that what are they doing they're worshipping a man right and they're guilty of blasphemy that's exactly right because says jesus holy fathers only the one time in the Bible as when Jesus was praying to God amen he said Holy Father keep them through thy day who got a skip in need praise God how many we got we call no man father mother father grandma father Jesse Fi rooks or father other viewer or father can read oh yeah we don't do that but we can look back and say that man was the father of the word for our debt that's right and I can prove that my Bible amen so here's what they say the Pope seems to be those who view him with the spiritual eye to be not a man but a God there are no bounce was authority he can declare to be right what he will and can take away from any of their rights as he sees fit to thou this universal power leads to being shut out from salvation the great enemies of the church are the heretics who will not wear the yoke of true obedience look at that so they're looking up on these worshippers of the Pope and they're saying they've exhausted this man to a god but don't just get down in the Catholic Church people worship brother Branham today - yep they'll take his word over the body if there's any disagreement they'll baptize it is vain no get upset if you call brother Brandon oh man but if you call Jesus demands they don't they don't mine that see that that's true you call brother graph just a man will get upset with you what do you say Jesus was a man don't say that's okay in that a shame see because they just love they always say this and be careful what they say they say I don't worship brother Brando but I worship the God inside of him but be careful with that at some point ever I hear that it just doesn't sound right because I don't worship I don't worship any person I never think of a person - oh the God has taught you is God my worship I always look at worship as something outside of the men worship should be separated from a man now is the God was God in brother Graham guest was God in st. Paul yes but we worship God alone and we must totally separate that from a man never you misery understand that by God's grace so I just don't like that statement I've heard that statement many times well I don't worship brother Brandon I worship the god inside and that's true but we got to be careful how we say that - amen because it's just getting closer and closer to worshiping brother Branham and we want to try to stay far away from that okay now here's what the program says he quotes first Timothy 2 I there's one meter between God and man the man Christ Jesus the Son of God there's only one person that can go between you and God and that's Christ he's God but the Pope of Rome has changed the word he made it he changed the Bibles in 1 meter between God and man not men so now he he dates between the mediator and then so they've got to make it say God and man which means that man means the Pope that's what they're trying to say so now he mediates between the mediator men but there's no other mediators save the son and I remember what they caught Mary the mediators I got the book I can show it to you they called Mary the media tricks and that totally blast seems that scripture right there that's right if you really get down to some of this that faith the faith of the Catholic Church it is rotten to the core like a brother I would say it's tommyrot right as at is rotten to the core because they ascribe deity to Mary and every picture you ever see it every picture with Mary it's always Mary the one who's in control it's always very the one who's glorified it's always a dying Jesus and a powerful mayor it's always powerful Mary and a little innocent little baby right and the church said what is that that always how it is Mary's exalted the strong one and that's what the that's what their book says every prayer they said we run to Mary the mother of God that's what their book says I can prove to you I put all the videos I have three videos on mystery mystery babble of white stones and you'll see it I can quote it right from the book the Catechism of the Catholic Church the CCC all right now he says the Pope announces salvation through the Church of Rome but there is no salvation except to the Son of God no wonder the eyes glazed in fiery judgment no wonder the feet are like fine brass as he stands ready to trample into powder and dust the wicked kings of the world ah kingdoms of this world he said but thank God for those strong feet of rats so the feet of brass mean destruction for them but here's what they need for us they have passed the judgment for us hey good idea to the beeping two different things either they're going to trample upon the unbeliever or its Christ hearty trampled over judgment for you and I praise God they are now our foundation so see his feet are our foundation for what he gave is ours amen we said identified in him Jesus the Son of God now notice here's where I brought this up it was in this fireteam in church age that we witnessed the rise of Mohammed ISM that denied the Son of God in that beautiful but but impulses out of history Muslims believe in Jesus but they don't believe it was the son of gun they'll call him a prophet you're talking they'll call the Prophet I've had Muslims on my youtube videos writing and so all this was great Jesus was a great prophet we should dress modestly all these things but they don't believe he's the son of God see that and this a Jesus says I am the son of God right that's why I'm soaked up with this age it exalts men it makes somebody else's son of God but Christ is the son of God and in this age Mohammedanism which we call the Muslim religion deny the Son of God and determine death upon all those who call themselves Christians that's right I remember there's only one Kingdom at the a member Daniels vision of the kingdoms there's only one Kingdom the IRA kingdom is the spirit of Rome that's why I said earlier the spirit of Rome yes is the Roman Catholic Church it's also in Protestants that deny the word and it's also in the Muslim faith because it's destroying people with power blooded murder it's exactly right it's awful to say but that's exactly what the history shows right surely this age must repent or lose all their stands the Lord of glory God very God his word is cast aside his person is rejected but human hands and human hearts cannot dispose him let them deny him yet he remained faithful fear not little flock it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and when I come with feet of brass a flaming eyes I will recompense reap a judgement is mine I will repay saith the Lord praise God this is what he's telling them be strong he said I work pay you just lived a life you just be the shining light and I'll repay with my eyes a fire at my feet of brass hey now let me bring a little encouragement when I read that this week now I'm finished with the whole chapter but to the whole chapter this is a whole sermon when I read that this morning I was just really inspired by that on the little clock so I want to just encourage the little clock a little bit anybody's any couraging tonight I could use some encouragement by God's grace and the Holy Spirit brings it encouragement welcome Adam says those discouraging times comes to every believer so if you haven't been discouraged well you're going to bite it bite it sometime and it comes to test you and to try you and to see if you really do believe every son that cometh to God must first be tested child training as he herceptin 12 amen every son must be tried in other words every son must face discouragement and defeated by the Word of God now I just want to tell a little story we had good services on Sunday with both sides and he preached a fantastic tremendous messages but I woke up on Monday morning feeling lower than a snake's belly I'll say like that I was so discouraged I was I know just I think I was because I'm so tired I'm just worn out I just knows I felt like I was just had no energy I woke up Monday morning just feeling so discouraged I went in the prayer closet and as I started praying God's hard incursion God's my witness that morning as I left for work I was so happy I woke up in the depths of discouragement in the depths of doubt and and I just got the prayer closet so I read it to finish the church age book and I left work and I was like own cloud 9 amen but what happened was I was discouraged you know because our church seems to be getting smaller and smaller and smaller and that's okay because really those who will be here are the elect of God a man those who want to stay but of course if you're called another church praise God but those who fall away and can be fought away it shows that they can need a see but the elect that stay around and can never be to see and so I was it is discouraged I think about mine so I'll talk about assignment you know how things have been discouraging for me lately and try and I'm just giving my everything I can give to the password and helping people and just discourage but then I remember to this quote brother Branham said that Satan attacks you when you're tired so be careful just for future reference next time you get tired you can expect Satan to come around so let's just this close for perfect baby okay I said now many of you be waiting over to the morning to stop out on a Sunday night service and that's kind of long distance to go I appreciate that effort some of you will drive home tonight because you got to go to work by daylight in the morning and I know it's hard and then what I think when I see that he's going to tell a little story here about how Satan tries to make him feel bad he said that I get spells to you now I get moody Siebel Brown wasn't God he was a man he got moody sometimes he'd say things right sometimes anything wrong I found a quote where brother Ram said he got sick and he could have preached some meetings and went to meetings and meet up I wonder since I'm sick I missed the meetings I can't preach him I wonder if God's even called me to preach he was so discouraged just because he got sick and he's missing meetings he was even doubting whether he should preach you know me too said to him he said you he says Billy you ought to be ashamed of yourself not about if RI said that to us brothers but he said you're right neither I can show you the mote if you wanted me to pull it up after service she says bill you ought to be ashamed of yourself see look out look how we can get so discouraged right we can even doubt if we're a Christian sometimes the church said then a prophet of God can wonders am I even a prophet should I'm going to be preaching it all all because we get tired or sick or get discouraged that don't mean up it your feelings don't mean nothing it's what God's Word say man stay with what the word says Amen your feelings will almost always lie to you but God's Word will never lie to you the best I get spells Doggett nu T I get a spot where what gets me so remember it's very personal here what struggles brother Graham is where I get those spells when I get all overworked trying to do too much any brothers or sisters ever start with that try to do too much you should have sat down and took a little nap where you should have rested a little bit on your day off but you try to work and press through it overwork yourself the RAM so that's when he got Moody and if Satan comes telling the same come during his overworked tired times that's what I was experience on Monday morning just two days ago and he says why nobody cares you haven't really got a friend in the world for the RAM at that interesting we get to see into the thought battles than my battles of a prophet of God a man that traveled the world seven times saw visions all the time and he admits when I get my battles Satan comes from you and I'm tired and said you're having friends yeah nobody really likes you that's a net you don't have a friend in the world you're not doing nothing for the kingdom of God brother Brennan said Rep remember I'm not immune to the temptation everybody's going to be tempted see I got to overcome that then when I look back and see something like this he's talking about other people will come to Sunday morning and Sunday night and then travel hours to go into work the next day he says I put it right back in the devil's face and say what about that ha ha ha he said that helps me to overcome devil what about that he say he said nobody loves you you don't have any friends everybody has to look at all these friends that will stay late on a Sunday night and drive home tired just because they want to hear the word look at all my friends that will take that a man I'm glad you got by God's grace I thought that sounds so beautiful you see what Satan comes at first telling you a lie speak something back to and tell him why he's wrong will you do that that'll help you in your walk with God if you speak back something and tell of what happened or tell him all about it how Olivia amen and now I was listening today and here's what he says at the end of the sermon here he said oh but uh precious Heavenly Father who promised who promised isn't it wonderful to be a servant of Christ all the things that he promised I think we have the privilege he's living right here him right with us now knows every secret of every heart knows all about you them flaming eyes going right through our hearts knows all about us and loves us aren't you glad he loves us look Church the flaming eyes are going to come on the day of judgment right white throne judgment but guess what they're going through our hearts right now praise the Lord they're going through our hearts right now to search our hearts aren't you glad he does it every sermon he doesn't ever see support our hearts will be in such now so we can be purged now they're hard to be searched later and Allah be purged they'll be punished later but thank you guys we get our perching in our chastising now archery relation is now but over there we get rest and victory and like eternal eight that keeps going he knows about us I just want to say that again he loves us and praise God He loves us praise the Lord little flock He loves us amen and aren't you glad to be in that little minority group I'm so glad to be that little memory group tonight that keeps the faith bori for it was his commandment fear not little flock it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom and accept this work should be cut short Jesus said there will be no flesh say see we're right at the end time so let me just review this I woke up went to bed really late Sunday night because we try to have some photoshoot with Simon Beth and I wasn't realize how tired I was going to be on Monday morning I even preach I just saw him LED twice I thought I didn't was going to be very tired I woke up and I felt not as low as a snake's belly I was so tired or worn out had all these my best nothing's going good the church isn't grow not leasing out faster battle that God don't care about numbers God cares about faith thing but see as a pastor that's not that's my battle you might have not had that battle but when I get over stressing over that's the battle Oh big mistake when was last time you want to solve oh look at these families that left it's because of you you didn't put enough prayer you didn't preach it up you didn't you know you should have did this and see how I get my battles to when I get tired but here's what happened I started praying and all of a sudden like this thought came out of heaven but they a minute laure and it thought and it come down to me and it came like this he said something along these lines I thought this end you're the only one standing for the message in all of the Akron Summit County something came to me and just Church and just draw such a source of encourage I felt like I could stand up it might be a man again I just felt like courage and in my heart like you're the only one your coach is the only one standing in this entire county and then I started saying you know what I'm going to go on Google Maps and I want to encourage myself I want to see where the nearest churches are so I just wanted to see it so to the North the nearest church right here is actually Lorraine or Sheffield Sheffield 63 miles north that means for the e63 miles you and I are the only ones standing for the message hallelujah in these 63 miles over there's no message Church visit all this area except you and I were the witnesses God will have again Summit County on the day of judgment with me churchmen to the north east I'd assume out the nearest churches albion on twelve months the nearest church and see I was so down discourage like oh you're doing nothing and the thought came to me you are standing at least you're standing you're a witness and I'm using you and your testimony will live on that game glory to the east the nearest church is almost 200 miles away and I appreciate before it's a nice little church nice little church whole sackful PA and then all of this area by that there's no message churches you and I are the closest ones to them you and I are the witnesses that will be there on the day of judgement you and I to the south now there is a little church thousands 20 minutes from us but the nearest church south there's some things you know there's some things that I disagree with the leadership there but but they're really wonderful sweet people they come visit us I disagree with some things that are preached there but you're sweet people but outside of that the nearest church south is 127 miles Logan is further south down 77 down here that's three hours away so we are the only witnesses Christ has for the message of the hour for all this area down here were the only ones for the nearest ones to the last the nearest church is 65 miles man scoot we've had brothers visit from the Mansfield Church nice brother real nice but fine brothers there's two young guys that work up a business quite often and this just really encouraged me something came to me just came into my spirit and said you're the only one standing in this entire area keep standing amen so if you zoom all the way out these green dots are the nearest bestest churches whole sample Albion there's two there to Sheffield and look I'm sorry yeah Sheffield a little brain there you have the church indulgent Mansfield Columbus and look at all this air there we are and all this area we're the only one standing where the witnesses is kind of the Queen of the South Christ will raise up us and say they did it they stood for the truth why didn't you stand for and our lives will be a judgment to those who disbelieve the Word of God hey Jackie right fear not little flock it's your father's goodwill to give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give you the kingdom to bring the rapture to you then so are you other than we go if you zoom out weather cam churches a little bit few more miles that way and there's a lot of nice churches down the Dayton area a lot of good churches of course line was down there too a little bit down the way there by God's grace there's this big church down here in West Virginia and so forth but church where just a little flock there's a little flock Jesus said few there be that find aren't you glad you found Edina now both of these quotes do to encourage us and also you know to kind of help us to focus because I want to think about doing some short or some a local missionary work like for example brother works that will go out to the park and sing and pass out things we've had a few people come to church because of that now to me it's been worth it it's worth it if somebody just gets to come in here the Word of God it's worth it I'd like to do maybe some of that this summer I want to pray about it tonight before we close you join with me and pray with me about doing some local ministries look at the church all these looking authors nope there's no churches in none nobody look there's nobody standing for the truth that I know except us so we can't say well we don't have a missionary field we do have a missionary field there's a lot of lot of room you know there's different ways you can different ways that you can approach that but let me just read a few quotes and hope this will help us tonight by God's grace so there's local missionary work and then there's continental missionary work we can do even in the US and I know the u.s. church program said this he said there's very few believers United States because it's already been preached the preachers have already gone through the harvest and pulled out the harvest I understand that but what if nobody would have come told you and I got it so we need we need somebody that told us we need to do the same thing we did tell somebody about it man so I'm first I'm the one that needs to do more of that like I said I'm trying to fight one person to a church a week I missed last week I can still do it this weekend ahead did the week before I missed last week I still want to do that I want to have it on my heart money to invite somebody to come to the house of God so here's a quote now look at this but I'm suppose the people at Tempe Arizona do you realize that the responsibility of the City of Tempe here I believe is resting upon your shoulders and money that's heavy what about accurate the responsibility of the people is on us I believe that God is making lighthouses each one of you you have the responsibility that's into the city is resting upon ministers upon the church people the pilgrims as we're turning threes that don't you believe that what you're not afraid surely you're not afraid to take God at His Word God keeps is where God is not a God to say that he's one thing and then another see if he promises anything that he will do God keeps his word believe that he goes on to talk about how the church needs to pray for the baptism of the holy ghost and that will set the church on fire and that's what we need to do Jim a nice guy snow Graham said I can accomplish more with five people with the Backson Holy Ghost than 5000 in a church instead I can show you that quote he said give me five people fill with all the ghosts he said we can turn a city upside down remember you might just get five more souls to turn the city upside down that's like the book of Acts - the emphasis was turned upside down twelve believers a net filled with the Holy Ghost amen that's right where we preach on Chicago recently member preached on Chicago on a Sunday night the shaking of Chicago remember that the pastor pray for shaking and he left he got kicked out and brother Matt peace at all I wish Chicago is shaken and he said brother I forget in 1200 I forget his name whatever was he said your prayers already been answered all of those believers that got saved that little group that was the shaking of Chicago so see that's what I said after might are to be shaken but if it's not let's ask God to shake it one more time and if we're doing missionary work that we believe God would bless if we pray beforehand you see how it's going to get focused on that because I get discouraged I got a tell the devil double your life we're the little flock we're the only one standing uh i planting on water but God must give the increase I can't give an increase of the seat I just planet I just water that's all I can do God's got to give it light so I say God bring more light admit your will praise God but instead it goes on to another quote here this is a different quotation and it has two parts oops this is the beginning to give you the background order if we believe the coming of the Messiah ends and we believe that the crisis ended come soon I think we ought to lay aside everything else and be concerned of getting this message to the lands calendar as fast as you can do it that's right if we are convinced but we preach that there's coming a messiah i want to put a hundred million dollars in a building if the messiah is coming what goods that going to do any well could be a house for the foolish virgin to go into but don't you think one hundred million dollars could be used better how do you remember what mother hen would do with a hundred million dollars anybody remember i showed you a few months ago but man said if we believe it seek our testimony our action speaks louder than our words if I had a hundred million dollars what would I do brother man I believe the Messiah's coming I would support a missionary program that would sweep around the country right quick and get a church ready for David in other words he would just hold more church services if he had a hundred million knows that I have we go read he go rent out a Chron's theater whatever their big building is where Hebron run out the rubber ball or he read out the zip stadium and he would pack it full of preachers that preach the message the Ottoman that's what you would do with a hundred million dollars other words you just hold services so see our outreach church just has to be more services but invite more people amen we can do it by mail we can do it by Internet you can buy ads on Facebook so we just gotta pray yeah that's what I of our new weeks have to pray we have to give more people a chance to hear the word of God and even if they're just a lot foolish version at least you reach somebody and don't get me wrong we guess we get missionary offerings my brother Jason comes in brother Ben Ben narada's evangelistic missionary type of work we do give them offerings they got for that but if we want to burden if we remember the burden of accurate all this area is upon us we've got aside crotchet abominations and then go out to the highways and hedges and brother brandon said this is all you they didn't just have to have special meetings and invite people to come and if people get an invitation don't go it's on then then it's on then it's not on us because we offer the gospel now this is the 1964 the next quote in Beaumont Texas he says I'm grateful to brother very green and to those brethren here that's for their efforts to make this meaning of success if there's anybody lost in this city in this generation it certainly won't be upon them fellows because they have heard every stone to try to make it a success now how do they do this how did they turn every stone in the city and try to find a safe person here's what they did they were feeding the people that came to their services they were getting them places to sleep hotels people's houses advertised on television everywhere just taking the money right out of their own pockets and placing it out they know that the crowds that we have wouldn't be able to support such as that so they took it are their old pockets to do it that's all they did also he was hold special being so for example here we have brother Brooks coming in Sunday if we invite equal to that then we're trying to a missionary our work praise God but let's say the Sun let's say we get so on our hearts of might you know somebody else and have some special meetings what we need to do is do this and by everybody we can come everybody that we can to come to the meetings and ask God to save souls that's missionary work how many believe that we can be a missionary right here now here's the next quote the very next paragraph as he's talking up to these men that have taken money out for food hotels advertising programs I think that's wonderful like somebody with a like that that's a vision I have a vision I have a direction we're going to try to win souls we're going to hold special meetings and we're going to pour our own money and pay for that so that some people can get say Amen romance that I believe it was set over there Hebrews 11 chapter of whom the world has not heard Amen glory the world is not worthy of people that were take money out of their own pockets and support meetings that preach the message of the hour and they stick their neck out see they were sticking out their necks for brother man's ministry we believe he's a prophet we believe he's preaching the truth and everybody would cut their heads off right I'm not fellowshipping with you anymore I'm not fellowship with you anymore but program said they were willing to stick their heads out for the ministry amen in the time when the ministry is so unpopular amongst too many the people that should believe like Pentecostals how many appreciate that by God amen I just want to review that now let me just go back to get it now I've gone down to the watchword post office and even though what did after I said and said how much does it cost to bail out an invitation a postcard to everybody it's like three cents or something like that it's pretty gee the most expensive part is printing off the invitation on the paper right with you want color or something like that but it would cause think it's like seven hundred eight hundred dollars to hit every mailbox around this area this area every mailbox you can invite every person you can buy every business to come to this little place and hear the word of God let me know that by God's grace so that's a mission we should have invite people we should pray and say God give a sufficient to invite people to come and hear the word of God we can put our website on there and say come here the best of the hour learn about you know water baptist learn about the baptism only ghost learn about Mystery Babylon I cut people to the core but it's the truth anyhow amen and maybe it's because it's God's voice saying come out come out of her my people so you don't partake of the plagues it's actually love the manna members love it's love when you try to correct somebody call them out and the true church will always well try to call people out to repentance the true believer so we could hit like we spend let's say just give you know we can spend $5,000 and everybody around maybe a 5-mile radius around this church would have an invitation to come hear the message of the hour that's how you see this but remember brother I said God doesn't need money to do it God just needs a willing heart to do a man right God moves by the spirit not by money but we all set the balance that with those quotes we just read men took money out and remember he went a brother had meetings somebody had to take through the auditorium somebody had to pay for something the food and some had to pay for the preachers it has to be done but you don't depend upon money what you need first is this what I need what we need is sufficient how can we try to be mission in mind how can we try to give people an opportunity to be saved and that's what we should do first find a mission first find out we feel light of the Lord and then God will provide everything I remember the last time I felt the Lord to go to South America I was in Walmart I never I don't they often forget this and I just committed the road road signs to the other books okay I'll go with you if you let the Lord to go preaching God you know we had some great meetings everything that I felt god bless it but I was sure a thousand I think I was $1200 shorter and I was a I was talking to a pastor on the phone I was at Walmart it's late at night I'm just trying to shop throughout no diapers or I was not what I was out to hell it was like okay you know brother he's the Lord yeah I'm just I'm here in Walmart and I got this $1,200 debt on my Discover card because I don't know how I'm gonna pay for this ticket and the brother said we've got the talking he said oh yeah I'm feeling good to go to South America he said I can't go this year brother Jesse but do you want to go I'll pay for you and church within a few weeks the check is in the mail and there's my $1,200 I'm not in debt anymore but see you had to catch the vision first by the leadership verbs now that's it that's the story of like little little trial people might be tested with a harder problem that's what I'm saying that's a pretty weak try was it very hard so some people divided two going program white into debt to hold meetings but God always provided eventually so my test wasn't that hard my test of faith was America that must not have very much fake because guys I got to give you something you can't handle but by God's grace one fate to rise so see that's just a little thought on a vision but we have to find a vision I can't expect people that you know aren't really compared to our church I can't expect them to support it but I should expect people that are fully committed to our church to try to support something man right I can free to rebuke about you know things in people but a people army you can't even get people to repent so hard to get people to repent but the ones who are truly committed will catch that vision and they'll do something about it but man said the world is not worthy of people like that that will catch a mission and try to win souls for the kingdom of God so all this came out of my mind battle on Monday morning all these thoughts are started rushing up you're the only one standing keep standing God's with you god bless you praise God okay so I read that last quote yeah I got a couple more quotable clothes and I got six minutes good phrase the Lord all right meetings that he preached that whole week in Nike of December of 1960 he said were to search our hearts and that's what I would say isn't every service like that don't you want every service to be like that or join God not to search your heart and let little doubt or little fear or little sin remain I will got to search my heart every service but man says writer these meetings are meant for that purpose is to search our hearts you said them planes a fire of your eyes searched out and know the reigns of the heart you certainly do father and speak back to us and then telling us to make keep ourselves ready that the hours arriving every service is a search your hard service so I want to close with this I just give me five more minutes I want to close with the statute referred man as we search our heart that it's want to go this again briefly by God's grace because I believe the people that will most catch the vision our church are those who actually born again only that if you're really bored again you'll have a vision of reaching lost souls but Graham said he said one of the evidence of the Holy Ghost is you just want to do something for God so bad you just can't hardly sit still you just want to do something for the kingdom of God so my prayer is god I wonder some for you give me a vision to do it a tan ahead so when it close to this because we need to examine ourselves and say are we born again if not let's get born again if we're born again let's catch a vision and then let's do something for God amen to put poor our resources into something because time is short amen either our lives are short or the company's going to be either one or the other either we're going to live our lives appreciate it's going to be over and die and go to the sixth dimension grace God will be the first to rise then but or the raptures going to come soon no one knows so we must do something for the kingdom of God now remember this is the statute faith is when you get baptized and you get virtue now the temperance patience guy's brother kindness and this is the baptism of the Holy Ghost my man tells us that right here's this is what it is faith is the substance need to choose the right way now I've got faith I've found the message the hour the Amen virtue is the strength needed to daily walked away remember Ruth was virtuous because she lived a life in front of all the workers in the field she's example virtue now it's just understanding to know why you walk this way well I should not cut my hair why should I not smoke why should I not wear short shorts as a man why should I not wear tight pants like all these people do now not goodness temperance is self-control needed to remain on the way self-control I control my senses I can crucify them daily patience is steadfastness this is what I love that's what oh god help me with this need it to be content on the way I'm just as content I can wait I know God good answer me I'm so content I'm so patient with the patience of Christ oh that's a real good actually right there godliness is the reverence needed to be just like God in this way to love your enemies that's what Jesus said even sinners can love those who love them but godliness is loving those who don't deserve that's what you said brother kai this is selflessness to live for others on this way praise God you like living brothers save money when I come here Reese I'm so nervous is to get here so I can do something up to help you guys out of course I wasn't opens for God you know for God's glory but because I love you amen amen and that we should give you you should come here because I would be a curvature mother Jessica are being herdsmen to my sister or my brother I want to live for somebody else I want them to know I'm right with compresses the battle amen that's friendly kindness I'm going to love the body of Christ and then the Holy Ghost is the presence of God the seal of God in your soul needed to completely manifest a living Christ in this way so in other words to completely manifest the word that God's called you to do whether it's preach song lead or teach or whatever God calls you to do I'll be a faithful wife and mother whatever God's called you do you need the Holy Ghost to manifest all the will of God for your life now remember motor have said you must have these virtues in you first before your captor sealed you must have these first then God seals you in any oh man a man sitting like this and does that permit when a man possesses these kind of things then the Holy Ghost comes upon it no matter if you speak in tongues really like that but until these virtues here go into you you're still off the real true foundation of faith when these virtues grow in and you added to that back to that then your living monument amen so you got to add maybe all these virtues first but as I said after your faith virtue knowledge all these things and to brotherly kindness love the Holy Spirit and Christ will come see there's Christ coming in the baptism with all the ghosts now this is the sermon after he preaches - for men he's always kind of long message and now remember the Holy Spirit could not cut the building of God until these things are operating by the spirit so seeing sanctification the Holy Spirit operate nations always fear will operate brother you see that the Holy Spirit debt but it hasn't cashed you yet - you're filled with power remember the Bible said stay in Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high any man so we need the power of the Spirit of God first and all those other things will flow out that's true but the caption with the power to do it part of it at amen there's my time so bear with me you need couple minutes it's got a couple coats now don't forget that he says verse two now and so forth is the add to it until the complete stature of Christ is made manifest then the Holy Spirit comes upon it and seals it is one body ha ha a men keep that in mine now he says you know quote species for thirty two seals God keep that mind takes these things first praise God then the sealing is the Holy Spirit the cap that seals us into the body like that hey man I like that and now as individuals these virtues and things now is add to our faith then when the capstone comes the Holy Spirit cemented together there is the baptismal Holy Spirit submits it together amen it's not something dirt that can be pushed around and blowing around it's cemented together in man all right dad get all those bill up in there then the Holy Ghost of the sweat that holds it in place glory ah one week later remember this morning I'm sorry yeah one week later this morning's lesson these virtues has to be in there before the capstone will even come on see until these things scripturally proven and sealed in to you the Holy Spirit sees you as an individual then you're a son a daughter on the doing I got two more thing let me see yep just two more yeah all right everything okay why we gets organized religion to us is another week later and your faith virtue all these things it is all these things godless purity holiness everything and then you're sealed by the Holy Ghost anybody see that by God's grace last quote but actually you remember the bjurman message it's the cap so what do the holy spirit capped off the individual and seal it when we added our faith but I just got this baby we misquote some other he's not reading and just misquoted and kept adding to it till we got seven things and the seventh one was love which was God it's actually the eighth point if you count love is actually two eight one I'm just I'm not trying to create go down I'm just say like if you run across and count you find it and that's how he makes the individual and caps him and seals him with the holy spirit and then that's me so he's got seven church ages he said seven ministries has been surrounded I'm sorry sounded away it bought board to bring it back and how the head so comes to cap off the trip to say to our feet by God's grace let me go back just to show you the cow I'm not trying to be smarter anything like that but he said love is the eighth one two three four five six seven so I'm sorry he said love is the seventh love is actually the 8 because 8 represents eternity right you get seven virtues your complete virtues then the eighth is the cement the capping the sea of the Holy Ghost there we love the Lord tonight amen and I'm phenom feeling later go back and preach little more on the Holy Ghost so your brother works will preach this weekend he'll

youtube channel the church website once I got a lot of good to cover the foundation of Christianity I wanted to send out these postcards and invite people to come to hear the word of God and if I had to go to our website that's what I felt like and if you like it out I've got those pretty good I've got 35 videos on there that's not enough I don't know what is I've got though st. vacations the three works of grace I got repairs I got baptism I got the Holy Ghost you know the things somebody really needs to get born again is on there a man I need so I'm saying is now and that was 2013 I start doing that and in 2013 I went to the post office and how do I send out postcards so here we are four years later I feel like we got enough on there and now we could fully get somebody to Christ if they really had a metaphor so I'm going to share with you that was my vision I'm not saying it's right I'm just saying I wanna do something for God so let's take a few minutes to devote some time to pray for a vision and it kept me anytime you don't have to be this summer I just say this summer because that's my keyword for I'm not working I'm on vacation you know I have more time to do things
