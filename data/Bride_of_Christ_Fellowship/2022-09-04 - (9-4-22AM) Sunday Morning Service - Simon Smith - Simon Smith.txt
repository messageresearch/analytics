========================================

he's doing here but over in the point ohio everyone's getting tested battles are raging why because there's a great something coming good and bad yes sir so we're literally coming back to the garden of eden once again there's two trees there's the tree of life yes and there's a tree of knowledge of good and evil so we want to be he found eating off the correct tree this has been a rough week for me all right i'll just share just a brief just pretty much let your pastor put jesse there to know uh i had a major trial this week and i failed you know my pastor he had a major child this week and uh he pushed through it and you know what i'm doing and pushing through it amen these trials but jesse told me just preached on the trials of your faith are more precious if you watch your life if you watch the little trials that are coming the devil's going to set you up okay he is going to burn this trial he's going to bring this thing it's going to the same thing he's going to bring another another trial the exact same thing he's going to bring this same thing and if you yield if you yield if you yield then once he brings this big trial down which is the exact same thing you have found in these trials before you're going to yield to it and he said he's the devil he's a mastermind that's right he works the same so he gives you a little little little little little boom here comes the big one and you're already in you're already in the motion of it it's almost like he programmed you for it right but we know that god is a keeper amen do you keep yourselves through the week are we depending on ourselves you better not be dependent on any part of your flesh your intellect your memory there is nothing sound in this vessel of yours right because if we couldn't choose to bring ourselves forward right certainly you can't keep yourself right we're all here uh on a journey as pilgrims strangers hallelujah waiting for an inheritance here when you go outside and you're looking to see the nice trees every once in a while maybe god will give us a chance to go on to a trip or see something nice and you see oh a mountain or man i'd like to live there one day or maybe you'll find this little cabin in the woods man that sure would be a great place and those things are promised for us i fail every day that's right saints of god i've never like i said our church i never met a perfect man that's right and you never will until you meet them yes amen amen hallelujah hey man so i thought about doing a powerpoint got a lot of reading and tonight i got a different thought already i woke up this morning early kind of having a little bit of something to go thoughts i thought all week just pulled things that would come in my mind uh just a couple hours before we got here maybe uh i kind of felt the pinpoint kind of which way to go there like that's grace so um if you'd like to stand for the reading of the word we'll read a very very important set of scriptures here i believe the last time your pastor go jesse my brother natural and spiritual everyone would get some of that yes i can't even express the gratitude to the lord for those things i think this thing joshua 9 1 amen under the jesse thought in this cell and our assemblies last time but i want to read this i want you all to read this very very slow you're going to read this slowly like i have sister lydia in my sunday school the last time there and she knew pretty much my entire study and she just do it and all the answers and everything little sister joshua 9 1 let's read this saints of god prepare yourself you better realize you better catch what we're understand right here yes this is into the promised land now into the promised land verse one and it came to pass when all the the kings which were on the this side jordan in the hills and in the valleys and all the coasts of the great sea over against lebanon and the hittite and the amorite and the canaanite the perizzite and the hitbike and the jebusite you heard thereof what they've already conquered two cities word was getting around these guys ain't playing games they have a power they have a living god with them yes verse two they that they gathered themselves together to fight with joshua and with israel with one accord now they were gathering together to fight they were farming they're bringing in a big army a one-world army together right but notice this little inhabitants here in verse three and when the inhabitants of gibeon heard that joshua heard what joshua had done unto jericho to ai let's read this all premeditated yes joshua at the time of this verse verse 4 joshua in the israelites they were just back at home they were eating they're living their lives waiting on the word of god and where to go next and what to conquer next and you're preparing for the next war yes but the devil was at war as well verse 4 they did work by lily that means very deceptively and went and made as if they had been ambassadors and took old so they're they're going to deceive so they they picked the very things they would need to tell a story and to prove a story and they took old sacks upon their asses and line bottles old and rent and bound up they picked the good stuff they take the new stuff they took the old stuff versus five and old shoes and clouted upon their feet and old garments upon them and all the bread and of their provision was dry and moldy they were actors actors deceivers right there six and they went to joshua why because they had to put on a performance and they went to joshua to the camp of gilgal and said unto him and to the men of israel we come from a far city now notice they had all this preparation but now they have to tell their story they've got to sell the story right we have come from a far country and now therefore make we a league now that was the first thing but now notice joshua being a little suspicious and the men of israel sit in the hibites pre-adventure we dwell among you pre-eventually you dwell among us and how shall we make a league with you in other words he goes how do we know you don't live here we're supposed to actually wipe you out now we're going to make a big league with you or commission of god to take this land and drive you out of here and they said unto joshua we're your servants notice how they humbled themselves right and josh joshua said unto them who are ye and from whence come ye and they sent him from a very far country so so far away my legs are tired i haven't had a haircut in weeks my beard looks like brother jose's lovely by the way he says we've come from a far country your servants because the name of the lord your god we have heard of the fame of him and all that he did in egypt and all that you did to the two kings of the amorites that were were beyond jordan to the sihan king of uh beshbon and to all king of bashan which was in ashtaroth wherefore our elders and our inhabitants of our country spake to us saying take victims with you for the journey and go to meet them and say unto them we are your servants therefore now make ye a league with us and now they had the story now this is the story they brought forth the story and now they said hey this is our bread we took hot for provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you but now behold it is dry and it is moldy and these wine bottles which were filled which were new and behold they are rent and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of a very long journey the saints of god we're dealing with the ones these are this is joshua and you know what his commission was and would god tell him as i was with moses so shall i be with you yes so we just saw the entire skit and where did joshua where did they make their mistake in verse 14 and the men took of their rituals they took those gifts and asked not counsel at the mouth of the lord that's right let's say the word of prayer is jesus christ dear heavenly father lord jesus lord you know i've experienced this very same thing just this week lord oh god you know my failure how i bought that thing book lion sinker the lord jesus lord these trials are for future tasks god yes oh god we ask god you would speak the lord to your bride here today yes lord i don't want any of my thoughts lord but all we want you to say what you would add what i give myself to your lord yes and oh may your will be done lord among this lovely congregation god they have instead stood on the word of god the pastor teaches lord brings things that very few even touch or will even examine in this message glory though we ask for if we're lasting upon the service we'll bless the ears lord of the word yes lord so we pray lord this will be edified to your bride something god that will not be taken lightly yes lord something that we will need in our arsenal we love you and bless the people god you will bring your saints standing now or reverend slow to your word but we certainly love you bless the servants of the name jesus christ well thanks again you have a it was quite a drama there that unfolded in the book of joshua yes and if that was the one thing that kept the promised land polluted that was the one thing that kept the promised land polluted in the book of joshua they were not able to fulfill the full word of god because the great commission was to drive out all the inhabitants of the land and then when they drove them out of the land that would be their land and the prophet of god he says he says that book of ephesus he says is just like the book of joshua and that what those are pointed back to what the holy ghost filled land right now the holy ghost what is that that is our life that is the source of life source of all authority source of all power yes is that baptism of the holy ghost if that life that holy spirit god himself is dwelling in you you'll have to feed it you'll have to speak to him you're going to have to do all those things but to keep him alive and well in what lord him dwelling with you and we want those things we want to get back to those things now i want to just get a couple scriptures here in matthew 7 and 21 he says not everyone that sayeth unto me lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven right man we know god had uh brother amen can probably even teach godhead and brother jose can teach it to his uh uh his grandbabies and this and that and show you exactly how it's not three persons but it's one person and they can bring down baptism and show you baptism in the name of jesus christ they can teach those things and they knew him lord lord he says but he that doeth yes the will of my father which is in heaven amen yes it's a very interesting statement we can have all kinds of signs and wonders and miracles all kinds of revelation saints of god if there's a day this is the one of the greatest days of revelation that has ever come in all of history is this day the amount of revelation the amount of understanding of the true word of god amen is given to you america yes because the bible said if they if those leaders and generals or whoever that killed christ in that day would have known that that was him they would have not done it that's right amen because they lack the revelation oh my yes they lack the revelation in john 8 and 28 it says then said jesus unto them when ye have lifted up the son of man then shall you know that i am he and that i do i do nothing of myself but as my father hath taught me i speak these things and he said and he that sent me is with me the father hath not left me alone he says for i do always those things that please amen amen amen i kind of think each one of us has a nature brother amen is built a certain way and every time i see brother amen guess what he displays the same kind of person that he is and guess what he acts different than brother austin and when i see brother often i talk with brother austin his mannerisms are exactly the same as brother often come on each one of you are built different yeah yes you all have different gifts yes get different strengths amen different weaknesses yes sir and you all have a different kind of nature one from another yes that's right that's what makes you unique and individual yep yes sir but you know we're not called and not chosen to live the way who we are that's right right amen let me give you an example here of myself you know what i like to do you know what i you know you know what i really like to do it wears me out but you know what i like to do i like to help people i don't know why it's exhausting right right but when i help someone in anything that i can do when i help them i feel good about that that's right that i was able to do something special or do something that no one else could do for them at maybe that particular time or in a certain area that they needed help but that is how i'm built right and it's it's time now for us to get beyond how we are built because what are we supposed to have we are supposed to have the nature of jesus christ that's right amen and you know what has been taught through many many churches through all over the world as jesus christ is a loving god that's right and he's like oh oh dear sister oh you can do whatever you want and still go to heaven and you can do this and you can do that you know do whatever you want as maybe like the pope would say in 2000 but just get that article he says anyone living a just life will be saved whether they know jesus christ or not so they make out who this jesus is as just some guy who's just as easy and carefree and easy to go and it just does whatever you know and just it's okay and how he just he'll look at my sin and just oh just made me do a giggle and that poor boy you know he just doesn't he just doesn't get it yet what is the nature of god before the sacrifice of jesus christ came the nature of god was you sin you died that's right right that sounds like a very very hard man but now that the sacrifice that he sent his son and now that blood is upon the earth now now that the now that we're watching this we're in a dispensation of grace yes if this was an old testament law i wouldn't be standing right here because i was disappearing to my parents i probably wouldn't stone right right but because we're in a dispensation of grace and we're gentiles god gave us a little something special and it's like this other gentiles can do whatever they want and the judgments of god hardly ever strike them many times it does on this side but says the bible says sometimes they don't get it to the other side that's right what a wake-up call there god have mercy thanks to god we want everything under the blood right now yes [Applause] thank about it even though when we fall and falter we do sin god sees nothing but what we've got to still make it right amen amen absolutely because what that holy ghost should be leading and guiding you to make things right amen but the nature of jesus christ was what to do only solely what the spirit what his father that was in him was leading him to do amen jesus was a man a one man and he had a ministry one to come to earth he was the greatest man he was the only man perfect he's the only one that packed that power in authority like he did amen what if jesus getting baptized filling the holy ghost in his own flesh i'm taking this baby worldwide starts traveling to rome start traveling uh uh uk travel up to to russia this is this no he didn't unity he didn't do that he knew his office he knew his commission for his life and his commission was what to the lost sheep of the house of israel all right amen amen question did jesus heal every single person in jerusalem and in israel at this day absolutely not he only did what he was supposed to do and he did that by the leading of the holy ghost amen amen amen [Music] yes you're not commissioned to help every single person on the earth all right brother right you're not commissioned to save every single soul on the earth that's right brother right even the ones that are sent to you you'd better make sure who sent them to you yes yes who sent those gibby knights to joshua did god or was it the devil now first of all the devil but the devil had to ask permission because he had to set the type correct so this morning i know it's a little slow here this morning i like to teach the tool needed to do god's will the tool needed to do god's will amen i want to start here now we know we everybody everybody we've been taught over and over we know the story in genesis 3 we just got a newcomer coming our assembly here we're doing bible studies with him he just he saw that original sin he's just like what praise god and he's very careful in his mouth he's just like you know i'm just keeping myself then i don't see another thing yeah he doesn't say much he tries to keep his mouth keeps his mouth from saying too much but he's seeing the revelation of it now we know the bible sets everything up god god allowed things in the scripture to take place a certain kind of way and but remember every god has to have a trap okay it's a two-way trap if you look at genesis three and one he says uh now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden right so here the serpent said he says are you supposed to eat them every tree says aren't we allowed to eat and retreat and what the woman said we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch it lest ye die so he she gave what the word of god to the serpent right right she pretty much said he says you don't understand he says he said we this tree she says what we're going to die and now notice what is then rebuttal directly after this verse 4 he says and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die what did the serpent do he added to the word of god that's right amen amen he added to the word of god now let me ask you a question why couldn't he take away from the word of god godhead says trap he could not take away from the word of god because his name was not on the lamb's book of life so the only way that god could bring judgment to the serpent was have him add to the word and therefore him not knowing the scripture revealed what all the way back in revelation 22 says if you add to the word of god he says these plagues should be added to you right right yes why do you think the devil was inside that serpent he could not take away from the word because satan's name was not on the lamb's book of life it had to be what he had all satan could do for judgment was to add to the word and what the judgments of god would then strike him absolutely now now what was uh let me let me let me read a little i want to read you a quote actually i probably misplaced this way down here now notice here i want i want to read a couple quotes here for you guys he says now i'm not trying to build a doctrine upon a dream and that's been green with the with the woman the man with the three three uh edge uh uh club or whatever beating this woman down with this three-edged plug machine which the holy ghost revealed that was the that was the trinity doctrine upon the baptism right he says i'm not trying to build a doctrine upon a dream nor am i trying to vindicate any doctrine i stand by a dream uh he says i stand for by a dream one is to the godhead is all the way from genesis 1 to revelations 22 and 21 he says but the people have been so blinded by unscriptural dogma of the trinity so notice the first thing the first thing that satan did was blind the people by a false doctrine by a false belief by something by a false revelation okay he says but the people have been so blinded by the unscriptural dogma of the traitor that that that dogma is so universally accepted and to try to see a one god head person is all but impossible it's been so pumped into the religious rankings trinity trinity right god in three persons god and three persons and when i say this when you hear something as is brought out to you and it enters into your ears you're you imma you and instantly imagine you start thinking about it and then that word goes into now what your spirit realm and now your spirit around those three inlets start working with it and one of the imagination you start thinking oh it goes three up and down absolutely okay three people one god and that's how they do it by what injecting it what into the natural comes out of a natural mouth into another realm here which travels what by sound and then into what the natural ears and then what into the spiritual that's how it works right he says that people can't see the truth of godhead but find it he says they can't ever see the rest of the truth so once satan gets you deceived by one doctrine and blinds you you'll never go any further until you break down that wall until you break down that doctrine amen he says they can't ever see the rest of the truth because the revelation is jesus christ in his church and in his works in the midst of the church for the seven ages do you get that now i'm sure you understand so if you're if you're a trinitarian and you start reading the book of revelations that's right why is jesus in them churches if the holy ghost was sent back and jesus is in heaven doesn't make any sense because they have a trinity idea a trinity idea a man-made doctrine of trinity right and they think they're separate people but yet they're one in the same amen jesus is what the father he is the son he is the holy ghost absolutely all right we know these things and that's what one of the greatest mysteries to be revealed to us today amen that we don't have to pray to the father separately at noon or however to pray to the son there is sunset and the holy ghost in the morning or how no when you speak to one you speak to one amen right because what we are built in the image of god amen amen amen your pastor with jesse he's a son to who snooki ray he is a father what america and in him is what a ray of light amen the holy ghost hey man absolutely sure right and we are in the image and likeness of god right one person amen absolutely now sorry i had to jump there now uh thinking on those things oh you know i wasn't done reading themselves sort of he's trying to but if you notice here in this quote he's talking about genesis to revelations and there's something about that there's something about those two books right yes notice in this revelation he tells us what the end of the devil is he tells us how he's going to deal with the devil and cast him in the lake of fire glory he reveals the end of the wicked once you follow satan and hate satan hates them and notice what the prophet of god said he says have you ever noticed how satan hates two books of the bible more than all the others why does he hate the book of genesis in the book of revelations is constantly attacked if you go to second peter three it says second peter said they're gonna be willingly ignorant of three things yes he said what the creation which is what in genesis the flood which is the genesis and the coming judgment amen oh both all three of those are genesis praise god he says have you ever noticed how satan hates two books of the bible or the others others all the others through liberal theologians and pseudoscientists how much pseudoscientist is going on right now right brother thanks god if you watch tv you might just call it the lie the light the the the lie glass that's right everything on there is a lie yes sir i don't know but some guys told me yeah they just caught trump with all these documents in his garage donald trump the old president has all these secret documents a multi-billionaire houses who knows what he's got and he's going to steal these documents how did he get clearance first of all he's going to steal his diamonds and leave him in his garage really really hey i had to totally disagree with this gentleman i said guys quit watching tv all right brother amen watching so much [Applause] that's right amen what did those giving us do they put on a drama what is television what is it it's a drama all right brother there's no difference from the news then when i was in the world i watched star wars no difference nothing real about it right man it's a worldwide drama stage yes sir with actors and players getting paid very well that's right brother right benefits they're getting it all what what is what is the whole thing is to deceive everything is what satan is trying to deceive the very elected right and if you get your mind caught up into what's going on over there you're going to miss it yes sir right now why does he hate those he says no notice he says he says the liberal theologian the super scientist is always attacking the book of genesis and the book of revelations millions and millions of years ago this dance flow that i found digging in the backyard no was not millions and millions of years ago right right i still can't figure out why these fossils of shells were on this mountaintop how did that happen do you realize how ridiculous that is they'll write resumes and and lengthy papers these thesis on how those shells got up on that mountain how are these bones get up on that mountain that are that are aquatic but not terrestrial there must have been a cataclysmic change in the environment yes it's called the worldwide flood that's right amen you know all of us were taught that we're in the public school public schoolers no you heard the truth how many was this we were lied to from day one that's right right brother and i'll tell you like this i'll teach that on tomorrow tonight here yes he says through these liberal theologians i just did i just did a study from my sunday school class six months ago and you know what they're teaching what these liberal theologians i'm talking christians and you know how they're teaching they are teaching by the scripture on the greek side using the greek to teach a local flood and they're not even pulling from anything but the greek interpretation of the bible and it proves it's a local flood thanks to god the devil is man right and we are not stopping amen to expose lies jesus so through these liberal theologians the super scientists he's always attacking the book of genesis and the book of revelations now why he says in both of these books we find satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction what was his origin in genesis he was what a fallen angel incarnated into a serpent that's right what is the bible says he says and i'll put evidence between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise his head amen absolutely all right the judgment of satan was what the god the these seed of seeds would what come and destroy the devil's kingdom take all his power strip and take the keys of death down the grave up with them that's right amen so in genesis god said i'm going to destroy your kingdom i'm going to take all you've got identify you in there what about revelations what does revelations reveal revelations reveals what took place in the new testament revelation reveals what took place in the new testament church how it fell right and you know the revelation about 99 percent of pastor's message i can ask two questions we'll see how deep they are see how studied up they are 1963 god speaks to the prophet says i'm going to reveal the seven seals go preach the seven seals one by one every night after night god reveals it and i was just teaching and just just just touched this on bible study last friday night two nights two minutes i said what's that a white horse rider and he said that's jesus what are you saying in the book of revelations that white horse rider was given a bow with no heroes and to conquer and to conquer war that was jesus i said no brother that was the antichrist spirit that was the devil himself that's right and he goes what i said i can prove it to you in the new testament so what was the revelation of the first seal that it was the devil riding that horse right right notice he came in white he'd look like a believer that's right he dressed in white full white and he was riding a horse which looks just like revelations 19. that's right brother right amen yes sir and what the prophet god said he said that was that nicolaitan spirit that was that nicholas in words yes so literally you can ask the ministers so who is the white horse right right horse rider oh that's the devil okay and that's the antichrist right they said yep what are his deeds and none of them know their revelation has not grown right any further than knowing that first horse writer was the antichrist spirit bore the devil right right in the first true change their revelation has went no further that's right in 60 years in almost 70 years yes sir that alarm goes yes yes sir is that an alarm and i've asked many many ministers and they don't know even what three deeds are where the three deeds are i don't know i couldn't tell you so literally they cannot they will not be able to discern the spirit within the framework of the church all right right brother that's right they'll not be able to do it yes sir this is alarming absolutely red light flashing he says he he says in both books we find satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction this is why he attacks them now notice in the book of revelations what not only is satan the one that caused the first church age to fall or the or the book of acts to fall to go into ephesus but later in the book of revelations in revelation 12 the bible says what that old serpent the devil it says what he was that serpent in the beginning of ju in the big the beginning yep of the new testament yes absolutely jesus said about the devil he has no pardon me and i have no pardon him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy the confidence in the word of god but when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spiritual revelation of the word hallelujah he says the gates of hell cannot protest amen glory but remember there's twins in every revival there's twins right and think about eve eve now brings forth her first child and she still could not understand who that was from but she had what what came out of her a life a life came out of her and she says look this is a god just because it has life in it you've got to test where what kind of life it is that's right yes that's exactly exactly right amen amen now let's continue on here by god's grace might be a little simple study here but i think it's very very important amen in first samuel 28. saul has been rejected now he's been disobedient to the spirit of god and the lord would not talk to him anymore by god's provided way which was through the urem or by dreams or by the prophets god would not even speak to this man in verse 7 that said saul unto his servant seek me a woman that hath a familiar spirit that i may go unto her and inquire of her and his servants said unto him behold there is a woman that had the familiar spirit and endor and saul disguised himself notice he had to disguise himself what because if she would have came into the presence of that woman she would have never been able to do what she had to do in front of him because why it was search and death and he had to disguise himself to get a certain kind of results and now this is what a backslid son of god that's right yes but notice once he started getting into a spirit i'll say like that it was revealed to her that that was saul and she screamed out said you are saw right but she could not have that kind of discernment until she got in a spirit i'll say it like that now for whatever reason she knew however she knew she knew and of course samuel appeared and they had their conversation and this this but his disguise was blown because she was in a spirit or a different channel a different realm and she could pass that physical disguise and see exactly who he was right absolutely now i want you i want to i want to read this here um uh just to uh in second corinthians 11 the bible says he says what to god you should could bear with me a little my father indeed be able to bear with me he says for i'm jealous over you as with the god of jealousy for his spouse you're the one husband so here saint paul is saying he says he says i've worked with you and i've told you the truth he's now if there's someone coming he says it teaches you anything any other thing he says don't believe it right but then here in verse five says for i suppose i was not with uh was not a wit behind the very chiefest uh apostles he says but though i i'd be rude in speech not in knowledge but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things now notice in verse 7 have i committed an offense and i'm basing myself that you might be exalted look at a true man of god he says i have never once lifted myself up right and he kept himself so humble and so poor that while he would not even take offering he would at night he would after preaching however he would go and work making tents and he provided for himself and he said what he said why he said i rob churches to help you out i have committed have i committed an offense in a basing myself that you might be exalted because i have preached you the gospel of god freely never even charged never took an offering because i made sure i had absolutely what i came with is what was i left not anymore nothing less he says i rob other church is taking ways to them to do your service and when i was presented with you and wanted i was chargeable to no man he said he lives he did this on purpose yes so if anyone would try and point a finger at him he could say what if i have i ever exalted myself have i ever taken any offering from you right absolutely not because what the devil is going to be watching him absolutely he was the man of god for the hour and he knew it but what the spirit of god led him to live this kind of life amen so horrible and so i was outside of this what is revelation 3 he said if you overcome he will allow you to sit with him in his father's throne that's right and the prophet god said that was the greatest compliment ever given to a humble threat amen if it starts out with humility it must end with amen that's right amen amen hallelujah because it will bring forth of its kind amen whatever's within a man will come out absolutely all right hallelujah goodness he says uh he says now why have i done this why he says am i guilty of exalting myself he says all i've done is abandon myself he says as in the verse 10 and then the true the truth of christ and me no man shall stop me of this boasting and the reason of the okay i wherefore because i love you not god knoweth but what i do but what i do that i that i will do in other words the way i live he says is the way i'm going to continue the way god showed me to live the way i want to keep myself just as low he says i will continue to do this what that i may cut off occasion from them that would desire occasion all eyes were on paul a true modified minister of god all eyes were on him signs were his powers and miracles and he had to live a certain kind of life because everyone was watching him and he kept himself homeless amen amen he says that wherein they glory they may be found even as we in other words jesus you're going to point fingers at me jesus live like this live so humble absolutely yes now notice these who are trying to bring occasion for such our false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into the into an angel of light therefore is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed into as the minister of the righteous whose end shall be according to their works or let's just say deeds right sure that's right so what do we really really need i'm going to tell you a story right now and i'm going to tell you how far this is going i'm going to tell you i'm going to tell you the mindset that i've seen in this message just a couple months ago i went and preached at a certain church and of course they went and took me and my wife up to eat afterwards and i don't say this with any anger or any anything but i'm going to tell you i'm trying to tell you what is coming what what the mindset is here amen right and we started talking about the absolute and i said brother the prophet of god said the holy ghost and the bible were the absolutes amen that's right and the holy ghost will get the absolute revelation of the scripture that's right right and this brother disagreed with me which is okay he said brother he said the message is the absolute he said you give you give this another generation all those messages are going to be canonized and put into the bible thanks to god we have between better check our revelation amen saints of god that's attacking what the book of genesis and the book of revelations what does the book of revelation say you cannot add or take away let me say like this what has always and i'm going to touch this tonight what has satan always tried to do make something else or someone the absolute light amen amen now you know i believe this word this message right so listen you read read the search book for the fourth time now not much but for the major i've been but i'm reading it again amen but now there's they have made the message equal to this saints of god this thing has been under attack for so long that's right brother in the dark ages the catholics taught this in latin so you and i could not understand it right that's right and what in 1500 they showed you last a while back they built this saint peter's basilica which is in the form of a snake and in 10 years god brings us to martin luther says that's it i'm done and martin luther calls him the antichrist that's right martin luther says what he said let's start translating this amen [Applause] all you have to do is open up your bible at home and let the words these words in our spirit and life strike into your mind read it to yourselves to what means coming by here amen hallelujah canonize the message and your lovely pastor is just making videos of probably a hundred things wrong that were misquoted that was not correct i love this problem because look look and you know what the phenomenal thing he says well brother he goes how can you if i have the holy ghost you have the holy ghost how come we're disagreeing on this i said he said that's right brother all right how come we are disappearing i said all right brother we both can't be right that's right that's right amen in 70 years they've convinced the people in the truth right right now this isn't all of it oh my goodness that you can add now to it do you see the condition ah lance yes now let's continue on here i want to hit these couple things here don't want to hold me too long now in john 3 and 16 yes for god so love the world everybody gets ah that's when i first got saved oh that's what i was that's what my sunday school teacher taught me in this church for that church god so loved the world we see uh uh what's it what's that football guy tim tebow john 3 16. i play football with my shirt off john john 3 16 god loves the world with his flesh being displayed right and god bless him hey if he's not against god if he's not he's for him you might not hey there were disciples following jesus that jesus called into the truth of his day and disciples are traveling in this and they look lo and behold there's a man casting out devils healing is sick raising death the disciples say hey you need to be with us the guy's like no man i'm good i got the lord he said you ain't got the lord lord right here and they went to the lord the lord tell this guy to follow us he says if he's not against me amen amen remember there's an economy of god yes yes sir there is an economy of god who's in this economy of god all right praise be to god he has chosen us to hear this word thank you jesus for god so loved the world that he began his only uh that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him we should not perish but everlasting god or everlasting life for god said not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and that's where they usually stop now verse 18. he that believeth on him is not condemned he that believeth him not is condemned already because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten son see the danger of possibly ghost baptism that's right right they don't even know that what the name of the only begotten son is to get baptized amen yes right this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and it says and men love darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil notice he says this right before the start of the book of acts church for everyone to do with evil hated the light neither cometh to the light lest his deed should be reproved why doesn't anyone look at these deeds in nicholases right good but he that do it true do it truth it says doeth truth cometh to the light if they see that they're doing wrong they change their ways and they'll come to the light that his deeds may be manifested they are wrought of god things of god we want the truth right amen in john 4 he says what he says god is a spirit that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth he says and john 17 14 says i have given them thy word and thy word the world and the world has hated them because they were not of the world even as i am not of the world i praise they should just take them from other words they shouldn't as i keep them uh that they uh but that they should keep them from evil they are not of the world even as i am now the world sanctifying through thy truth thy word is truth amen amen he says as thou has sent me into the world even so have i sent them into the world and for their sakes i sang them by myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth saying to god the only way you can fully be free is to know the truth the bible says and the truth will make you free amen amen so what is the greatest what is the one tool we need more than anything else for truth now we have this and we have this we have the word of god and we can die we can go right in the holy place and break down every doctrine every mystery everything all that yes and we can even pray but there's one tool we need coming into this book of acts survival now let me show you here uh this is in i believe this is the introduction to the churches book he says now let me read this to you this is this is part of the reason why they failed in somewhere though this value will concern itself with various major doctrines such as godhead water baptism etc found in revelations chapter one to three its main theme is the setting forth of the detailed study of the seven church ages this is necessary in order to study and understand the rest of the revelation so we don't study the church ages right never gonna understand the rest of the revelation amen and so forth this is necessary in order to study it and understand the book of revelation for out of the ages come the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets and now the trumpets come the viles like the first burst of a roman candle the church ages could come forth the mighty initial illumination without which there could be no further light but once the brilliance of the seven church ages is given by divine revelation light upon light follows amen amen are we walking in the light hallelujah he said what was the first initial revelation given to john what these seven church ages yes hallelujah but do they have have they went into the light and studied the initial things of it which is revealed by what the seals if they went to the church ages and can't see what that seal is have they went through the church ages right they have missed a turn right they have went up so far and said we're good and the light continues on but they've stayed right here yes because remember saints of god there's only two in this war the lord jesus christ and the devil that's right without this last tool you'll never catch this devil in manifestations now notice here what's this tool in i didn't write this from this stone brother graham says let's turn to the first book of corinthians chapter 11 and he starts reading to communion scriptures right and he gets here now and he says now i want to read my text out of the 29th verse for he the east and drinketh the unworthily shall be guilty of the body of the lord now wait i have read that wrong for he that he doesn't drink it unworthy not discerning the body of the lord now notice he was reading it and he read it wrong he says hold on i read this wrong shall drink unto him self-damnation not discerning the body lord he says i have wept over this bible and it's got some faded places in it amen amen as he's read as that once he caught this revelation of communion he started weeping because saints of god communion is about discerning the body of the lord yes hallelujah which is what how you treat one another and the prophet of god starts weeping realizing what's going on in the assemblies and the churches with one another yes hallelujah now the most profound thing he says after this directly after this now our eternal destination he says after reading this scripture our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see or we hear but it's determined on what we discern yes we have what discernment we have on what we see and we hear amen what's this last tool really in these things god is discernment yes what is one of the things in the book of acts that sets everything else apart if you read acts 4 write it to acts right at the end of acts 4 the holy ghost they had 3 000 baptisms and a revival starts and everybody's caught up in the moment people you're receiving the holy ghost and some water and everybody's all excited and this and that was having a revival look what god's done jesus christ has arisen from the dead and they get all excited and everything pumped up and then a movement starts which i believe was led to the holy ghost the bible said that all those who had lands plural and houses plural more than one house more than one land they started selling them and they distributed all the money around each other and the bible says no one was lacking that's right everybody was okay everybody had food for tomorrow the next day and the next day and that was the leadership of the holy ghost at that time and then a couple in that revival caught wind of it we got extra hands but in their heart in their heart they went and sold their land or however and they got all this money and they said well we're just going to keep half of it back or part of it back and we're going to bring the rest and give it to peter as the other brothers have been doing that's right and this man obviously baptized never received the holy ghost had this money and he comes before peter and because of lack of discernment on ananias party he did not realize he was dealing with a man who was just recently filled with the holy ghost that's right amen amen glory this was an experience that peter had 10 years ago 20 years ago it was a fresh anointing of god hallelujah and peter knew what he was doing peter knew he had sold out to christ he was no longer scared he was born as a lion under the united states and peter's sitting there and this man comes up with all this money here's peter this is the money from my land peter says that's all the money from the land the guy's like yeah he said you're a liar how are you tempting the holy ghost today you will go the young man that will stand beside you're going to carry out right now that's right and he dies right there notice one lack discernment and it cost him everything one had discernment amen and he kept the church pure amen hallelujah what if peter was not in the condition to catch the discernment of that person they would have been a person that would have been now remember he if he started out with one little lie how that would have what what would his life been in another year or two years yes but because peter was able to what bring have that discernment glory by what oh yeah stay mad this he did ananias did not change his clothing he did not come in with any other he just came in like who he was right right looks like just the rest of guys no acting here it was just a single line but god was so nervous god was so concerned about his bride at that time he did not want one now remember peter the holy ghost could have left it just like that i forgive him but what is the spirit of god god knew his church was just started his move was starting and he was not going to let anything who taught that man and doing that that was the devil right the devil discerned him the devil entered him the name of mine does that and the holy ghost kept his church clean and by that one example they put fear into all the rest of believers yes yes saints of god we have to come to a point where we have some discernment oh yeah experience hallelujah what was more deceiving the gibby knights or analyzes the fire ananias and spyro they didn't change anything they just to represent christ his obligations he must meet those obligations but keep him in prayer he's going into work now everyone knows likes what works like the kind of people that work at work right now is the time really i'm being i'm teaching this because of my lack i was lacking discernment at a time and it will cost you tremendously and the story was good the actions were good it was all planned out but my nature is sure i'll help you i'll help you but god's nature is to help and take care of his own now god is good the bible says god is good to the evil and to the just he's good to both and now i have to choose i've picked something here i texted him this gentleman i said i forgive you and i said you've gotta repent you gotta get saved answer back then that's right unless the lord let him know now remember brother graham talked to told a story there's a couple there's a couple ministers who bought some land and they went into court because they were some people were trying to take it and they had religious reasons to keep this land and they went up a great against the great attorney general and the great attorney general tore these boys up as ministers in fact they lost the case because this guy was so smooth with his words so eloquent so good and pinpointed this fall and that fault this this and those ministers lost that land and bro graham says he says picking up he says he said if that attorney general would have known would have discerned who he was talking to because he was just months later that same attorney general was in a plane crash into a water and he was drowning and dying and immigrants said he was i bet you wish he would have had discernment yeah right absolutely now that gentleman that took me for a ride there he did not know he was deceiving the son of god here that's right that's a scary thing but the main thing what i'm trying to say is that trick of the devil is coming in religious form you know what brother can't preach that wednesday night judas preached honestly that's right that's right because i told my wife i didn't talk about it i told my wife i said i want to see what i can't preach about tomorrow night and out of nowhere he comes and preaches right judas and the betrayal which is what a set up the bible says what judas from that time on look for convenience to betray him to sell him out that's right to deceive thanks god we're coming to it this is really it's just the lord's showing me here just in my life i need that holy ghost wisdom yes and the guy played the part and it was he was a natural he's very good so now when this message be careful you listen to yes what do they say when they say that we got the word what do they mean that's right because what they mean and what they say is two different things dearly father lord jesus lord we certainly love you although god may be a sobering little study here god and lord jesus god lord i it was certainly a wake up call to me lord and how we need to be walking in the light as you are in the light hallelujah and lord jesus lord as you have brought forth these the revelation here of these deeds lord which few can even see god lord if we can identify those outward actions god i say that's not scripture but lord we gotta come up higher now lord to someone who looks like they're doing the will of god that has no our deeds look bad our lord's got to come down to discerning of the spirit and lord jesus lord we know the next step the next light we must come into god [Music] we want to continue in the faith god oh god we pray lord for this assembly here god brother here lord the pastor god lord that you would continue to bring forth that radiant divine light of the word of god may continue to grow and unfold no darkness nowhere the lord just pure divine life not man made light lord not natural light or manly light lord the light of god lord jesus we love you so much be with all the people god lord all the saints lord pushing out lord be with brother austin godzilla go out to the world now oh god we pray lord that this little study would keep him in order to get into a questionable situation someone trying to learn the wrong way god deceiving the lord god may he discern the very spirit right there read it jesus the lord we pray lord you would make your voice just a little bit louder for you that you'll be able to hear god and know it through us as well [Music] i encourage you as for the jesse all the rest pray pray pray for discernment pray for your wisdom pray for revelation like no other time this thing is coming a brother just having document they're poisoning the earth they're destroying the earth through the environment through the the sky they're doing things we don't even know and the bible says in the book of revelation that god would destroy them to destroy the earth that's right it's happening it's coming we're very very close i believe it could be years months or whatever but be ready uh if you need a prayer or anything if you're anyone on your heart seeing prayer will you come anointed with oil or however let's just worship god trust the lord's spoken hallelujah just kind of a warning i just feel this really checked me this week it just comes so fast i've caught other lies people trying to deceive me i've caught other lies i'll be honest i i was dealing with a gentleman and he kept telling me to come over to his house come on his house for bible study i said are you working he's like no i said you come to church you don't need he refused two weeks later he killed himself [Music] and now i just come to this revelation a month and a half ago man that took his own life that was trying to get me to his house i started working with two brothers and they're his neighbor and they know this is him and his family they said simon [Music] because there was that much there was that much evil going off that house that's right they looked at my face both the brothers i talked to them separately they would have done something to me he would have done something him and his mom would have done something to it but before i went to that house i didn't go but before i said lord i was just ready to go listen lord show me if you want me to go i'm going to scare you i don't know where i'm going as soon as i open my eyes with that prayer i looked around for about five minutes and then oh my spider just appeared running up and down my windshield [Music] that affected me for about a year and then when these two brothers started working with me they said simon he would they would have tried to kill you because they already the old neighborhood knows they killed their own dad the wife and the boy killed the father they everyone in the community knows they did it and the police don't even care [Music] i'm just telling you the devil's a liar he's a thief he's a destroyer kill steal destroy you from he's into all that so watch yourself always
