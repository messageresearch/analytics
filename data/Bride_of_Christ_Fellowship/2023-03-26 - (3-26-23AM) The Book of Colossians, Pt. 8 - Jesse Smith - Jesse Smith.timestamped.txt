[0:01] let's go to Colossians chapter 3 verse
[0:03] 12. I'd like to continue on this book of
[0:05] Colossians series here by the grace of
[0:07] the Lord
[0:08] you know last Sunday when I preached on
[0:09] you never did in the first place I got a
[0:11] couple testimonies back on that one so
[0:13] I'm very thankful that George was able
[0:16] to minister to that
[0:17] in fact Emma sent me a message and said
[0:20] brother Jesse I was just reading First
[0:22] John 3 verse 9 that more Sunday morning
[0:24] and I was wondering about that verse and
[0:26] that's the very verse I opened up with
[0:28] last Sunday morning so I thought that's
[0:30] really nice when the Lord
[0:32] he'll discern the thoughts and tense of
[0:33] the children heart praise God so I
[0:36] thought that was a real blessing and so
[0:37] I just thought I'd share that one that
[0:39] was really encouraging
[0:42] Colossians chapter 3 verse 12 here we'll
[0:44] look to the Lord here
[0:50] the Lord to minister here Colossians 3.

[2:40] seated praise God
[2:48] I trust you enjoyed Wednesday night you
[2:49] know I sent brother Simon a text and um
[2:53] I texted him nine things you know it was
[2:55] such a special sermon to me
[2:58] I texted him nine things that uh
[3:03] you know he he had touched on in a
[3:05] sermon that either I'd recently preached
[3:07] or gone through
[3:09] and I told him after service I you know
[3:11] I said I don't know if I've ever had a
[3:14] more clear discernment
[3:16] of my life in a sermon
[3:20] in other words I just felt like the Lord
[3:22] Jesus Christ was speaking directly to me
[3:24] that's what I felt like and so I was
[3:25] thankful I was I was grateful
[3:29] um
[3:30] so I think I'll just read that list real
[3:32] quick here so you can hear it might help
[3:34] you because it just helped encourage me
[3:36] to know that Jesus really loves me
[3:38] praise God if he's willing to come down
[3:40] and preach so many things
[3:42] and Simon said he was hurried on that
[3:44] sermon you know he didn't know what to
[3:45] preach he said he was just he said he
[3:47] was just being faithful just coming and
[3:50] you know as a preacher sometimes you
[3:52] know like you got the sermon I'm going
[3:53] to preach this other times you just got
[3:54] to trust God
[3:58] but he preached about you know we're we
[4:00] were called gods in the Bible I just
[4:02] preached that the previous Wednesday
[4:04] he preached about how we're Sons and
[4:06] Daughters I just preached that the
[4:08] previous Wednesday he preached about
[4:09] Ephesians 5 and the mystery of Christ in
[4:11] the church I just preached it on Sunday
[4:14] those actual verses I preach it on
[4:16] Sunday
[4:17] preach about mind battles coming in at
[4:20] night and that's what happened to me on
[4:22] that previous Saturday night I just had
[4:23] this mind battle
[4:25] I think it was it was really awful just
[4:26] a spirit of fear came on me like I told
[4:28] the church
[4:29] and he didn't even know I went through
[4:31] that um
[4:33] he preached about us being tired I was
[4:35] so tired on Wednesday night I don't know
[4:36] why I was just so tired I was almost
[4:38] falling asleep at work during my
[4:40] planning period I was just so tired I
[4:41] don't know why
[4:43] he's talking about being tired and then
[4:45] he's saying you know he's saying that
[4:46] song I bless your name and then it talks
[4:48] about the Midnight Hour how we need to
[4:49] sing song that's that that mind battle
[4:51] came right before midnight when I had
[4:53] that battle it was the song was just
[4:55] right
[4:56] it was right what I had gone through
[4:58] seventh he mentioned Donald Trump and
[5:01] that's kind of what the vine battle was
[5:02] about you know are they going to arrest
[5:03] him and then are they going to come and
[5:04] arrest us next I don't know I mean you
[5:06] might I laugh at that now but
[5:08] when I was laying there in bed it just
[5:10] came upon me like a spirit of fear I was
[5:12] thinking about getting the gun out and
[5:13] getting ready to shoot you know people
[5:15] that might come in to arrest me or it
[5:17] was just you know it's one of those mind
[5:18] battles I'm human too you know I go
[5:21] through I go through my battles
[5:24] um
[5:25] you know in eighth he said he started
[5:27] off by saying you know we battle the
[5:29] unknown
[5:30] right just the unknown like what's going
[5:31] to happen next week what's going to
[5:33] happen next year what's gonna happen
[5:34] with my life that's kind of what I was
[5:35] battling the unknown
[5:38] and then ninth he preached on people
[5:40] being insane in this age and just the
[5:42] day before
[5:44] I was studying for to find that quote
[5:47] when brother Branham said thus say the
[5:48] Lord he said this world will go insane
[5:51] he said it's thus save the Lord so those
[5:53] are just nine now I I could have gone
[5:55] back and found probably more but I've
[5:57] never had a sermon where I felt like it
[5:59] was directly
[6:00] Discerning Jesse you thought this you
[6:02] preached this you went through this nine
[6:04] of them
[6:05] and Nine's a pretty good number Nine's
[6:06] the uh there's nine gifts of the Spirit
[6:08] there's nine fruits of the spirit it's
[6:11] kind of like the number of fruitfulness
[6:12] I thought well praise the Lord
[6:13] I just want to encourage you you know
[6:15] and I thought I told Brother Simon said
[6:16] Don't Let The Devil ever tell you you're
[6:17] not called to preach
[6:19] because I've never had a sermon like
[6:21] that and I appreciate all the sermons
[6:22] like brother amen sermons my sermons for
[6:24] the Dig sermons I appreciate all the
[6:26] sermons but I don't think I've had
[6:29] ever a sermon where it kind of revealed
[6:32] like nine thoughts and intents in my
[6:34] heart
[6:35] you know in in my Christian walk and
[6:37] here I've been serving God since you
[6:39] know 2000 in the message since you know
[6:41] the end of 2001 here 21 years later I
[6:44] don't know if I've ever had
[6:46] a time where the Lord spoke more
[6:48] directly than he did on Wednesday night
[6:52] so that makes me encourage her it makes
[6:54] me more excited to come to church
[6:57] because I'm just I'm anticipating I have
[6:59] expectation as brother amen preach I got
[7:01] expectation God's going to speak to me
[7:03] praise God and he's going to minister to
[7:05] my needs so I think we can all be
[7:06] encouraged today and I just thought I
[7:08] might start off
[7:09] you know maybe just sharing that part of
[7:11] my testimony and by the grace of God so
[7:13] let's look at part eight and you know I
[7:15] just we read our texts and
[7:17] again just briefly the outline of
[7:19] chapter one Paul's greeting Paul's
[7:21] prayer that's the prayer I prayed for
[7:22] the Amish group down there for that they
[7:24] would be in all the wisdom of God and
[7:26] and fulfill all the will of God uh the
[7:30] Colossians needed to know about the
[7:31] Supreme deed of Christ the power of the
[7:33] Cross and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[7:36] and then chapter two the treasures in
[7:38] the mystery of the godhead all the
[7:40] treasures are in Christ
[7:41] we must overcome enticing words
[7:45] we must oh now look in our church in in
[7:48] their battle the Colossians battle they
[7:50] weren't battling physical persecution
[7:54] right they were they weren't getting
[7:55] threatened well we're going to come in
[7:56] and arrest you guys that wasn't it Satan
[7:59] was attacking them through deceiving
[8:00] words
[8:02] through Temptations like mind battles
[8:04] that they would try to deceive them to
[8:06] leave the faith
[8:07] sound familiar
[8:09] sounds like something we could relate to
[8:10] praise God Satan's trying to get us in
[8:13] such awful mind battles where we want to
[8:14] uh where Satan wants to try to convince
[8:16] us to leave the faith leave the truth
[8:19] right
[8:20] and so that's what they were battling
[8:21] they weren't over they weren't battling
[8:23] uh the swords of the Romans they were
[8:25] battling uh Satan's fiery darts in their
[8:28] mind battles and they had to overcome
[8:30] philosophy and legalism and mysticism
[8:33] and people hearing from angels and now
[8:36] we do believe God sends angels we we do
[8:38] believe we have Guardian Angels praise
[8:39] God but when any Angel would say
[8:42] anything that goes against the word of
[8:43] God that's a satanic angel
[8:45] right
[8:46] and so we started chapter three and uh
[8:49] we must set our affection on things
[8:50] above we must have our focus on Heavenly
[8:52] things
[8:53] and then last time we looked at
[8:55] specifics we need to mortify in
[8:57] Christian Living
[8:58] okay now I just was thinking you know I
[9:01] was you know looking at thinking at the
[9:03] you know just preaching a sermon on the
[9:04] book of Colossians and I thought is the
[9:06] Gospel of Jesus Christ still needed in
[9:08] this year
[9:09] do we still need to preach on the book
[9:11] of Colossians
[9:12] can the world use these words that we're
[9:15] going to preach today can the world use
[9:17] them
[9:18] can we can we use them and I thought of
[9:20] course and uh that's what we need more
[9:22] of we need more of the word of God Amen
[9:25] so let's look today to the word of God
[9:27] and here I'll set my timer so we'll try
[9:29] to look at it maybe an hour 15 here
[9:30] we'll try to see how this goes
[9:32] and trust the Lord will Minister tonight
[9:34] I think I might preach a little bit now
[9:35] children I might do a Bible study but I
[9:37] want to preach on how to take care of
[9:39] your body in preparation next Saturday I
[9:41] got to speak at my wife's uh herbal
[9:44] event
[9:45] I kind of want to make tonight my run
[9:47] through right
[9:48] my practice round
[9:50] and then I let my wife listen to it
[9:52] later because she's going to Sheffield
[9:53] and my wife can say well maybe you could
[9:54] add this and maybe I'm preaching a bunch
[9:57] of people that probably do a lot better
[9:58] than I do
[10:00] with my health because you know last
[10:02] couple nights ago I bought some ice
[10:04] cream sandwiches but they're all organic
[10:08] okay so I had an ice cream sandwich last
[10:10] night
[10:12] I try to I try to do it with moderate
[10:14] moderation praise God in other words I
[10:16] will not and I haven't done this I
[10:18] haven't eaten a whole container of ice
[10:20] cream in one sitting I have not done
[10:21] that
[10:22] I've been tempted to do that but I
[10:24] haven't done that but you know I've had
[10:26] great testimonies you know my wife as
[10:28] far as my wife helping me with health
[10:29] overall health I've had wonderful
[10:31] testimonies like the Candida
[10:33] testimony that has been life-changing
[10:35] for me
[10:37] and virtue looked at me last week and
[10:40] she said why do you look so young Pastor
[10:43] Jesse that I'm right
[10:44] I don't I wasn't even thinking about it
[10:46] I don't know
[10:48] and it must be because I don't you know
[10:50] I don't abuse my body so you know she
[10:53] brought that up so much I didn't think
[10:54] about that
[10:56] um
[10:57] but there is there are so many the Bible
[11:00] says golly exercise I'm sorry bodily
[11:04] exercise profits a little so
[11:07] um you know I want to have that little
[11:09] benefit so I can serve the Lord longer
[11:11] so I could be more faithful praise God
[11:15] so that I I really want to take you know
[11:18] I want to take encouragement from that
[11:20] scripture also from Daniel look at
[11:22] Daniel you know we'll look at that
[11:23] tonight and Daniel and his friends said
[11:25] we're going to have a different physical
[11:27] diet then
[11:29] uh was it the Persians or Babylonians
[11:31] Babylonians at that time
[11:34] and look what it did it made they were
[11:36] smarter they actually looked healthier
[11:38] they looked younger
[11:41] so
[11:43] um you know we want to recognize that
[11:44] and the reason behind that is because we
[11:46] don't want to have
[11:48] we don't want to get caught up in the
[11:49] spirit of the days of Noah where it's
[11:51] eating drinking and cares of the world
[11:55] uh like you know like my wife and I have
[11:57] seen we've seen people destroy their
[11:59] physical health and then say God deliver
[12:01] me from this devil yet you were the one
[12:02] that let the devil in
[12:04] your addiction to Diet Coke let the
[12:06] devil in gave you cancer
[12:09] like that was you like say to them you
[12:11] know you let Saint in and said Lord
[12:12] deliver me from Satan you blame it on
[12:15] Satan but it really wasn't Satan it was
[12:16] it was their own choices
[12:19] okay so that's kind of and then you know
[12:21] but it just shows those people that do
[12:23] that they don't have the anointing of
[12:24] the Holy Ghost they've actually turned
[12:26] down that anointing of the Holy Ghost
[12:27] for temperance
[12:29] right that you know so I don't know how
[12:30] that works out you know did they ever
[12:32] have it I don't know did they lose it I
[12:33] don't know
[12:35] um but if it's part of the word of God
[12:37] we want to live it praise God we want to
[12:39] we want to live by every word that
[12:41] proceeds out the mouth of God
[12:42] so let's look to the Lord here you know
[12:44] uh we opened up with chapter 3 verse 12.
[12:48] now we just got I'm going to open up my
[12:50] Bible here too we just looked at all the
[12:52] things we have to crucify in our lives I
[12:55] guess that ties in perfectly with what
[12:56] we're talking about here uh
[12:59] more to reverse uh five I'm going to go
[13:01] down to verse five
[13:03] yeah mortify these things in your in
[13:06] your body fornication uncleanness which
[13:09] was luxurious living so anything that
[13:12] would involve a luxurious life
[13:15] inordinate affection that means Cravings
[13:18] evil concoctions forbidden things
[13:21] Covetous covetousness which is idolatry
[13:25] and then Paul says put off
[13:27] anger put off wrath put off malice put
[13:30] off blasphemy put off filthy
[13:32] communication that comes out of your
[13:34] mouth put off lying in verse 9. and put
[13:36] on the new man praise God put on the new
[13:39] man
[13:40] so we're encouraged to crucify these met
[13:43] these Temptations and Cravings in our
[13:45] flesh in our minds
[13:47] and put on the new man like you'd put on
[13:49] new clothes praise God
[13:52] and then Paul says put on therefore as
[13:54] the elect of God
[13:56] holy and beloved vows of mercies
[13:58] kindness humbleness of Mind meekness
[14:00] long-suffering for bearing one another
[14:02] forgiving one another If any man have a
[14:05] quarrel against any even as Christ
[14:07] forgave you so also do ye praise God so
[14:10] I want to look at the word elect here
[14:11] again this elect word is a very
[14:13] beautiful word it means you are picked
[14:15] out by God
[14:17] God picked you he said of all these
[14:18] people that are going to live they're
[14:21] going to choose me and they're going to
[14:22] want my favor they're going to want my
[14:23] Mercy they're going to love the cross
[14:24] they're going to love me
[14:26] he couldn't force you to love him he had
[14:28] to foreknow that you would choose to
[14:29] love him
[14:31] and so you are the elect so he says we
[14:33] are the elect We're The Chosen we're the
[14:35] picked out by God
[14:37] and I like it we're the best of our
[14:40] class
[14:43] and again we don't pat ourselves in the
[14:45] back we're the best and we're we're the
[14:47] elector we're Gods we we have to
[14:49] recognize it's the truth but we don't we
[14:51] don't major on that we don't major on
[14:53] exalting ourselves but we have to
[14:55] recognize that God calls us the elect
[14:59] and that'll encourage us as the elect of
[15:01] God put on God's anointing
[15:05] we are in excellence in preeminence
[15:09] uh applied to the Christian in other
[15:11] words we are the wise virgins praise God
[15:13] we're the Believers that are filled with
[15:15] the Holy Ghost praise God and Desiring
[15:17] or Desiring to be filled with the Holy
[15:18] Ghost
[15:19] and so we have the foolish version don't
[15:21] have that desire until it's too late
[15:23] think about that all the foolish
[15:24] versions that have lived
[15:26] they've never had they've never had that
[15:28] real desire to get born again they never
[15:30] really had that desire but there's going
[15:32] to come a time at the Rapture they're
[15:33] really going to have a desire to be born
[15:34] again but it's going to be too late
[15:36] because the Rapture will already happen
[15:38] it already happens
[15:39] right
[15:40] because they go seeking for it after
[15:42] it's too late
[15:44] so we got to seek for it now praise God
[15:46] Amen that's right put all your heart
[15:48] into the services put all your heart
[15:49] into servant Jesus Christ amen
[15:51] Hallelujah
[15:52] so
[15:54] put on therefore as the wise virgins
[15:56] we'd say in other words clothe yourself
[15:59] so in other words this is a mind choice
[16:01] you know in our minds we've got to put
[16:02] on a mind
[16:04] that we are the elective God that God
[16:06] chose me
[16:08] and we're virtuous which means it's holy
[16:10] me holy means virtuous or separated or
[16:13] full of God's virtue full of God's
[16:15] character
[16:17] and we're dearly beloved that's what the
[16:18] word beloved means we're love dearly
[16:21] so as God's God's elect that are loved
[16:24] dearly he says put on bows of Mercies
[16:28] kindness humbleness of Mind meekness
[16:29] which is gentleness and long-suffering
[16:32] which is patience and slowness in
[16:35] avenging wrongs
[16:37] so that means church that we're going to
[16:39] have people do us wrong sometimes
[16:42] we might you know as one another as
[16:43] Christians we might do one another wrong
[16:46] but the Bible says have long suffering
[16:49] and be slowness to avenge yourself in
[16:51] fact I think the Bible says we should be
[16:53] so slow at avenging ourselves that we
[16:56] should not avenge ourselves we should
[16:58] let God have Vengeance praise God
[17:00] because vengeance is mine saith the Lord
[17:02] amen
[17:04] I just want to remind us of this I know
[17:05] cam preached a sermon on this wow I
[17:07] don't know if it was here or at his
[17:08] place but he was sure maybe he was just
[17:10] sharing with me on the phone and he
[17:12] actually had uh he'd share this part
[17:14] about Mercy I'd never heard before Mercy
[17:17] is compassion shown towards someone when
[17:20] it's in your power to harm them or
[17:22] punish them
[17:24] so that makes Mercy to me when Kim said
[17:26] I was like wow that was a
[17:28] that was you know when we say oh God
[17:29] have mercy on me in other words God you
[17:31] could harm me
[17:32] uh you could re you could you have
[17:35] you're in a position where you could not
[17:37] bless me I mean you're Justified and not
[17:39] blessing me
[17:40] but I'm asking for your mercy I'm still
[17:43] asking that you would show me compassion
[17:45] even though I don't deserve it
[17:47] right so I thought that was a good
[17:48] thought on Mercy
[17:52] as the Bible says there uh bowels of
[17:54] mercies now I don't I don't think I put
[17:56] it yeah so the word bow means like your
[17:58] intestines or your heart or your liver
[18:00] it means you're inward
[18:02] body parts
[18:04] so the very the very depths of your
[18:06] being have mercy out of the depths of
[18:09] your being so let Mercy come from the
[18:11] very inside of the inside praise God
[18:14] Hallelujah
[18:16] that's what Paul says uh crucify these
[18:19] Cravings crucify uh the sin nature the
[18:22] sin the the sin nature you're battling
[18:24] every day and put on God's virtue put on
[18:28] God's love and and have the very deepest
[18:31] mercies you can have for one another
[18:34] praise God
[18:35] it's a beautiful thought there
[18:37] when it's in your power to punish
[18:39] someone
[18:40] you show Mercy
[18:42] when it's in your it's in your power and
[18:43] you have the ability to harm someone but
[18:46] you don't harm them
[18:48] praise God
[18:51] you show Mercy he said have bowels of
[18:54] mercies praise God
[18:56] I'm going to get to this later but uh
[18:58] you know there's a friend I told you
[18:59] about a year ago this happened to me I
[19:01] told you this I put it on the podcast
[19:02] too I had a really good friend over the
[19:05] years we've been great friends
[19:07] he sent me this text and I sent him a
[19:10] text back and it wasn't the answer he
[19:11] was looking for
[19:14] and uh he said we're no longer friends
[19:16] and everything we've done for all these
[19:18] 20 years was all
[19:20] it was all fake and it wasn't real
[19:22] because I didn't say the right things in
[19:24] other words he was testing me to see
[19:25] what I would say
[19:26] and I was so shocked there
[19:29] I didn't know what to say
[19:32] now church I was mistreated and I I was
[19:36] in a place I could have text back some
[19:38] really harsh things
[19:41] because this wasn't the first time this
[19:42] had happened to me
[19:44] but we still love all of our friends
[19:45] praise God
[19:48] and so I just didn't text back for six
[19:49] weeks and finally I just didn't text
[19:52] I just said Lord this is in your hands
[19:54] when brother Dennis McBride came
[19:56] and uh he preached something and told me
[19:59] exactly what to do he's he said uh if
[20:01] people he said sometimes God has to take
[20:03] friends away for you in order to serve
[20:06] God better and I just come to the altar
[20:07] I wept and cried and I said they just
[20:09] gotta let you gotta let God handle it
[20:11] God brings people into your lives God
[20:13] takes people out of your lives
[20:16] but I realize him that whole six weeks
[20:18] it was in my power to say some really
[20:20] harsh things I could have but I didn't
[20:24] and then six weeks later I got to Texas
[20:26] said please forgive me I had a spirit of
[20:27] critical spirit on me it seemed like we
[20:29] had a lot of critical spirits around
[20:30] here
[20:32] that's okay it's better than uh some
[20:33] other Spirits praise God Amen
[20:36] Hallelujah
[20:39] and uh and then I talked to them on the
[20:42] phone and I even saw them at a a meeting
[20:45] not maybe about maybe about seven months
[20:47] ago and everything was all right
[20:49] I just thought uh I just thought it was
[20:52] just a good example of how I was tempted
[20:54] you know it was in my power to say
[20:57] you've done this you've said this you
[20:58] you did this I could have laid out I
[21:01] could have laid out the whole list of
[21:02] all the things wrong
[21:04] but by God I'll just say this by God's
[21:06] grace God gave me vows of Mercies
[21:10] and that's the scripture we're going to
[21:11] get to a little bit the Bible said God
[21:13] is ready to forgive
[21:17] that could have been a spot where the
[21:18] bank where I was ready to pour out wrath
[21:19] I could have been
[21:21] oh I've been waiting for this this
[21:22] person's not off done me wrong I'm ready
[21:25] to really give them the business right I
[21:27] really tell them how they're they're not
[21:29] much of a message believer how can they
[21:30] be born again I could have poured out
[21:31] all these things
[21:33] but God is opposite God is I'm I was I
[21:36] was just ready to forgive you
[21:39] God God is not taking the attitude well
[21:42] I'm just ready to pour out punishments
[21:44] on brother so and so or sister so
[21:46] God is actually he's ready to give Mercy
[21:50] I know you're going to fall short Jesse
[21:52] I know you're gonna but here I'm ready
[21:53] to show you Mercy
[21:55] he's ready
[21:56] he's got it he's got it all prepared
[21:58] he's got forgiveness all prepared for us
[22:01] amen praise God Amen
[22:03] he's ready to do it praise God that's
[22:05] the kind of love we need to follow after
[22:08] praise God
[22:09] that's the kind of love and mercy we
[22:11] need to repeat
[22:13] and that was just a good example of how
[22:15] I did it from my heart I thought all
[22:16] these great years you know all these
[22:17] great times
[22:20] like brother man I said this little
[22:21] fella doesn't mean that it was hard to
[22:24] say that but then the word of God I was
[22:27] preached was right what I needed praise
[22:28] God I always find it that's how it
[22:30] happens
[22:32] and so let's remember that let's ask God
[22:34] for Mercy let's have mercy on others who
[22:37] may not deserve it but let's remember we
[22:38] don't deserve it all the time either
[22:41] okay now uh I'm now I'm going to focus
[22:44] on this this next verse here
[22:47] uh verse 13 for bearing so in other
[22:49] words when we show Mercy we're actually
[22:51] holding people up now think about that
[22:53] think about that I could have text that
[22:54] gentleman back that brother and I could
[22:56] have tore him to shreds
[22:58] and in his mind he could have fought he
[23:00] could have fallen and said look look at
[23:02] my look at my life look at my testimony
[23:05] but instead of that Mercy will help hold
[23:08] people up in their faith keep standing
[23:10] you're a real believer
[23:12] keep saying you're a real child of God
[23:13] hallelujah
[23:16] see when you show Mercy you actually
[23:18] sustain other people you actually keep
[23:20] them encouraged you keep them fighting
[23:22] the good fight of Faith Hallelujah
[23:26] see hold people up don't tear people
[23:28] down hold people up now we want to tear
[23:30] the devil down every chance we get
[23:33] we want to tear Satan down and Satan we
[23:35] want to tear his kingdom now and every
[23:37] chance we get Hallelujah
[23:38] but we want to hold one another up
[23:41] the entire time
[23:43] we want to forebear each other we want
[23:46] to forgive them which means grant them a
[23:48] pardon I pardon you brother sister I
[23:51] pardon you
[23:52] I'm not going to hold this against you
[23:54] If any man has a core or a blame or a
[23:57] complaint against any
[24:00] even as Christ so how do we forgive even
[24:02] as Christ forgave
[24:05] so also do ye at church that's what I
[24:08] was you know you know are we always
[24:09] ready to forgive you know when we go to
[24:11] God in prayer and we and I'll say like
[24:14] this church you know
[24:16] for the thousands time this year I've
[24:18] come back to God asking for forgiveness
[24:20] right and each time he's ready to offer
[24:22] forgiveness to me
[24:24] I'm ready to forgive
[24:26] I'm coming back I'm ready to forgive you
[24:28] yes you're forgiven I will I will not
[24:30] impute that to you I'm quick I'm going
[24:32] to quickly Grant you forgiveness this is
[24:34] what Paul says
[24:36] and I believe this is applicable for
[24:38] 2023 praise God for thou Lord aren't
[24:42] good see and ready to forgive and
[24:44] plenteous and mercy unto all of them
[24:47] that call upon me praise God
[24:50] so this is the God we serve we serve a
[24:52] god who's a good God
[24:54] he's ready to forgive
[24:56] the Bible said he's slow to anger
[24:59] you know so think about you know the
[25:01] times God's poured out his anger on
[25:02] people and he swallowed up Dora or Cora
[25:06] and Nathan right he swallowed them up in
[25:07] the earth and he had aching you know uh
[25:11] stoned and everything like that and
[25:12] burned with fire got in that in each of
[25:15] those cases God was slow to anger
[25:18] it was a slow process right
[25:21] and these people
[25:23] God had to pour out of judgment on them
[25:25] but we are the children of God
[25:27] hallelujah we're not an Aiken we're not
[25:28] a a Dothan or we're not a core a praise
[25:31] God we make mistakes but we're not
[25:34] fighting against this message we're
[25:35] fighting for this message amen
[25:38] and so if God was so to anger with them
[25:40] that transgressed the word of God how
[25:42] much more is God going to be merciful to
[25:44] us and ready to forgive us who are
[25:46] fighting for the truth praise God
[25:48] amen God has plenty of Mercy for this
[25:51] church
[25:53] because we're calling upon the name of
[25:55] Jesus Christ
[25:57] amen so let's be let's in our hearts
[25:59] let's be ready to forgive as Christ is
[26:02] ready to forgive
[26:05] Hallelujah in church this is the
[26:06] Christian walk right this is the
[26:07] Christian life because now we're into
[26:09] we're into how we can set our affection
[26:12] on heaven and how we can live a
[26:14] Christian Life we can crucify these
[26:17] Temptations and then this is how we
[26:19] model the Christian Life to others
[26:22] we can forgive them
[26:26] and then this other verse remember Jesus
[26:28] prayed on the cross father forgive them
[26:30] for they know not what they do they
[26:32] parted his raiment and cast his Lots so
[26:35] like my example with my friend in the
[26:36] text he didn't even know what he was
[26:38] doing he didn't even know he had a
[26:39] critical demon Spirit on it
[26:42] think about that
[26:43] Church do we always know when we have
[26:45] evil spirits on us like just in our
[26:47] minds do we always know
[26:49] like if we're if we're coveting after
[26:51] something that we don't have do we
[26:54] always know I've got an evil spirit on
[26:55] me don't always know
[26:57] this brother didn't know for six weeks
[26:58] till the Lord woke him up
[27:01] think about that so somebody could have
[27:02] a complex
[27:04] for a long time
[27:06] and not really no not really realize I'm
[27:09] in a bad spot with God
[27:11] now my prayer is Lord show me my
[27:13] complexes as soon as possible praise God
[27:16] show me if I got a wrong thought on
[27:18] something
[27:19] help me to have helped me to have a
[27:21] thought that that glorifies you help me
[27:23] to be loving to each and every person
[27:24] praise God
[27:26] but Jesus prayed father they don't know
[27:28] what they're doing they parted his
[27:30] raiment and cast lots
[27:33] on the cross suffering on the cross and
[27:36] he cries father forgive them they don't
[27:38] know what they do
[27:39] it's a it's a beautiful testimony even
[27:41] as Christ said father forgive them we
[27:43] should say father forgive those who sin
[27:45] against me
[27:47] because none of us have been the Bible
[27:48] says none of us have suffered unto death
[27:50] yet
[27:51] none of us have suffered such
[27:52] persecution where we've had to shed
[27:54] blood
[27:55] as far as I know
[27:57] we might have different testimonies but
[28:00] we never had to fight or you know put
[28:03] our lives on the line to be a Christian
[28:05] as far as I know maybe some of us have I
[28:08] know I haven't personally
[28:10] but again let's look at how Christ
[28:12] forgives God's ready to forgive he's
[28:14] quick to forgive he's slow to anger
[28:17] and then he forgives people because he
[28:20] realizes they don't know what they're
[28:21] doing
[28:22] they have a
[28:24] they have a complex they have a mind
[28:25] battle and they don't even understand
[28:27] the Mind battle that they're going
[28:28] through
[28:29] so Lord forgive them
[28:32] Church like brother Adam says he said if
[28:34] any of us want to see anybody burning
[28:36] hell he said we've got to go back to the
[28:38] Altar and make sure we're saved
[28:40] what a statement what a statement if we
[28:43] want to see any of these people even all
[28:44] the people that speak against me I don't
[28:45] want to see them I don't want to see
[28:47] them go to hell
[28:49] and if I did something's wrong with me
[28:53] right I got an awful complex
[28:56] yes we have to correct people yes the
[28:58] Bible said then the sin rebuked before
[29:00] all Jesus rebuked the Pharisees in front
[29:02] of I mean crowds and he preached whole
[29:05] sermons rebuking the Pharisees
[29:08] but he you know he was trying to offer
[29:10] Grace he was trying to preach the truth
[29:12] so they could be saved he was sent to
[29:14] his own and his own received him not
[29:16] praise God
[29:19] again another verse this is the parable
[29:22] Jesus told about the the king or the
[29:24] ruler who forgave the man this amazing
[29:26] debt this huge debt and the man fell
[29:29] down and said have patience with me and
[29:30] I'll pay thee all then the Lord of that
[29:33] servant was moved with compassion and
[29:34] loosed him and forgave him the debt
[29:38] so church I want to just say this too
[29:41] you know even in our families and our
[29:43] marriages and our friendships you know
[29:45] there's going to be times where
[29:47] we can't we can't uh we can't get things
[29:50] right right away like we're still
[29:52] learning how to
[29:54] show the love of Christ in certain areas
[29:55] of our life
[29:57] and we gotta and sometimes we have to
[29:58] say Lord
[29:59] and to one another to have patience with
[30:02] me I'm trying to grow in this area of my
[30:03] life
[30:06] like I'm trying to grow as a better
[30:08] husband I'm trying to grow better or to
[30:10] be a better father
[30:12] a better pastor
[30:14] right and so each one of us we're all
[30:16] we're not what we want to be praise God
[30:18] but thank God we're not what we're used
[30:19] to be amen
[30:20] Hallelujah
[30:22] and so here's an example of how God God
[30:24] is patient even though this man the man
[30:27] says have patience I'll pay it all the
[30:28] in the parable the king knows he he's
[30:31] not gonna be able to pay this off this
[30:33] is millions of dollars of debt or
[30:34] however many he wasn't
[30:36] but the desire but God recognized the
[30:39] man's desire amen
[30:41] his desires show patience with me until
[30:43] I can get this right
[30:46] so I want to encourage us let's show
[30:47] let's show patience with one with one
[30:49] another until we can get it right praise
[30:51] God
[30:52] Hallelujah
[30:53] I like that that's a good dog I just had
[30:55] that about this morning
[30:57] so what the Lord do the Lord said I
[30:59] forgive you he had compassion look at
[31:00] that move with compassion
[31:02] a church that's what we need we need to
[31:05] we need to wait until God moves us with
[31:07] compassion
[31:08] we need to feel we need to feel people's
[31:12] struggles
[31:13] praise God
[31:15] I love this how God shows how God is
[31:18] moved with compassion when we see people
[31:20] begging for mercy when we see people
[31:22] asking for help that should move us to
[31:25] compassion
[31:27] in other words we we got to be able to
[31:28] be moved out of a hard-hearted mindset
[31:31] and be moved to a mindset of compassion
[31:34] for others
[31:37] that's beautiful
[31:39] have patience with me I guess that meant
[31:42] a lot to me you know because as my wife
[31:43] and I you know in our marriage there's
[31:45] there's errors I need to grow and like
[31:46] communication
[31:48] and so you know with my wife I've asked
[31:50] her for patience many times and my my
[31:52] wife always gives it praise God
[31:54] when I look at my life and I can see I
[31:56] need I need her to have patience with me
[31:59] I'm sure she would say the same there's
[32:00] areas I need to have patience with her
[32:02] because we we both fall short of God's
[32:04] glory
[32:05] I just love this how God is able
[32:08] to say I I like their heart their heart
[32:11] is right you know they want to make this
[32:13] right eventually
[32:15] and God is moved with compassion because
[32:17] they want to make it right they can't
[32:19] make it right right away but in time
[32:21] they can make it right and so I'll
[32:23] forgive them because of that
[32:25] amen oh that's a beautiful dog praise
[32:27] God
[32:27] so these are the specifics on we need to
[32:30] mortify these things in our life
[32:33] so in other words we need to we could if
[32:36] we have corals or disagreements or
[32:38] complaints about people we can either
[32:39] hold on to them or we can forgive them
[32:42] we can crucify that desire right and
[32:45] instead of tearing people down we can
[32:47] build them up forgive them
[32:49] and not hold blame against them and not
[32:52] complain against them but we can forgive
[32:54] them like Christ forgives us amen
[32:56] oh it's a beautiful chapter
[32:58] this is real meat and potatoes right
[33:00] here praise God
[33:03] because how many of you like would like
[33:04] to go home and or go home or go to
[33:06] church or go anywhere
[33:09] how many you know wherever you go don't
[33:10] you want to experience these type of
[33:12] relationships
[33:14] now how many you you don't have to raise
[33:15] your hand but how many don't have this
[33:17] kind of relationship in your natural
[33:18] family
[33:20] I mean you don't have to raise your hand
[33:21] but
[33:21] in other words you got family members
[33:23] they won't forgive you they have
[33:24] quarrels against you
[33:27] they blame you for things
[33:29] right I mean all of us can look at our
[33:31] lives and we can see
[33:32] relationships that are broken broken
[33:35] relationships because people are not
[33:37] putting on the love of Christ
[33:40] that's why that's why I asked that
[33:42] question is this even applicable for
[33:43] today of course if there's ever a time
[33:46] it was applicable it's today praise God
[33:49] because the love because of the sin
[33:51] shall abound iniquity shall bow the love
[33:54] of many shall acts called amen
[33:56] most people don't have relationships
[33:58] like this where people instead of
[33:59] tearing you down they'll actually Build
[34:01] You Up
[34:02] like sometimes I get comments on my
[34:04] YouTube videos and all's is criticism
[34:06] and so I'll say well did you like
[34:07] anything about it at all
[34:13] was there anything good about any of
[34:14] those videos
[34:15] anything good in that video you know I
[34:17] spent you know 25 hours on that video
[34:19] was there anything good in that at all
[34:22] what am I trying to say I'm just trying
[34:23] to say like can you hold me up a little
[34:25] bit
[34:26] can you try to sustain me a little bit
[34:28] and of course I don't I don't let those
[34:30] things so you know I don't let those
[34:31] things drag me down
[34:33] but the the Christian should try to
[34:35] build each other up and hold you up
[34:38] right and keep you standing for Christ
[34:40] amen that's a real creation praise God
[34:43] to keep you in the faith amen
[34:47] you know not long ago I had a brother
[34:48] from overseas I think it was New Zealand
[34:49] I can't remember which one
[34:51] he was really asking me about when
[34:53] should we uh
[34:55] when should we put people out from under
[34:56] the blood and he's like we should put
[34:58] him out even for little things I'm like
[35:00] brother
[35:02] I said you start doing that you're going
[35:03] to have a real small Church pretty soon
[35:06] you're going to put everybody out and
[35:07] pretty soon you're going to get put out
[35:10] and he ought to get put out for putting
[35:12] all the other people out
[35:15] I said brother I said well he said well
[35:17] then how do you apply this brother
[35:18] random said this and that I said look
[35:19] how brother Branham did it he rarely did
[35:21] it
[35:23] there's one place in the message brother
[35:24] Brown said he said brother Neville and I
[35:26] are going to go around this week and
[35:28] we're going to go to from house to house
[35:29] and make sure there's no disagreements
[35:30] with anybody in the church I don't know
[35:32] if he did it we don't he doesn't give us
[35:33] any updates on
[35:36] and I said brother he said well then
[35:38] when do we do it brother Jesse I said
[35:39] look at look look look in the Bible when
[35:41] did they put people out from other blood
[35:42] in the Bible
[35:43] and the Bible said they only did it when
[35:45] this young man was sleeping with his
[35:47] stepmother and everybody
[35:49] everybody was fine with it
[35:51] that was the only time he told them to
[35:54] put him out
[35:55] for the destruction of the flesh that
[35:57] their Spirit might be saved
[35:59] I said let's apply it like that I said
[36:01] any other questions he said no that's
[36:02] okay we can be done with that now
[36:04] see so it was like it was a Zeal to to
[36:07] yell at you know the Zeal like let's get
[36:09] the Akins out let's is true but friends
[36:12] we all got some Aiken in our in our
[36:14] members right
[36:16] and if we want to we if we want to come
[36:19] up with quarrels amongst each other we
[36:20] could we can pull some stuff back from
[36:21] years ago
[36:23] I could pull things from years ago you
[36:24] could probably read we could all pull uh
[36:27] quarrels against one another from years
[36:28] ago but it's better to forgive
[36:30] Hallelujah
[36:32] it's better to live a life of
[36:33] forgiveness being ready to forgive being
[36:36] ready to Pardon and to hold people up
[36:38] praise God
[36:39] oh if somebody did Did You Wrong years
[36:41] ago and you can't get over it yes then
[36:42] it's time to go to them just like the
[36:43] Bible said go one on one
[36:46] we got to do that
[36:48] but I just thought that was you know a
[36:50] good application of this that
[36:52] Christ so freely forgives us every day
[36:54] think about that every day
[36:57] seven Seventy Times Seven 490.
[37:01] you should you should forgive your
[37:02] brother 490 times in one day
[37:06] and I'm so ready to forgive it I forgive
[37:08] you I forgive you
[37:11] we should have that same mind let the
[37:12] mind of Christ be in you praise God
[37:16] this is Holy Ghost preaching amen
[37:19] praise God
[37:24] so see God loves a heart that says God
[37:27] God loves a heart that says you know I
[37:28] can't I just can't get the victory right
[37:30] now but I want to change I want to be
[37:31] different I want to be a better husband
[37:33] I want to be a better wife
[37:36] I want to be a better brother in Christ
[37:38] have patience with me and the church
[37:40] said
[37:41] God loves that heart
[37:43] just outpatient with me so I'm going to
[37:45] get there by God's grace I'm going to
[37:46] get there
[37:49] and above all this above all this
[37:52] scriptures we just read 12 and 13 above
[37:56] all this
[37:57] putting on all this kindness and long
[37:59] suffering above all this he said put on
[38:01] charity because it's the bond of
[38:03] perfectness
[38:05] in other words love is the glue that
[38:07] keeps our church together
[38:11] love is the glue that keeps a marriage
[38:13] together
[38:15] love is the glue that keeps a brother
[38:17] friendship together
[38:19] or sisters Fellowship together
[38:21] love is the glue
[38:23] the the Greek word actually means a
[38:25] ligament
[38:27] because ligaments hold the bones
[38:28] together
[38:30] so he says above all this have love in
[38:33] other words above all this make sure the
[38:34] different parts of the body have
[38:36] ligaments connected make sure the
[38:37] ligaments aren't torn
[38:40] church I in the playing sports I've had
[38:43] many a torn ligament in my ankle
[38:47] there are times I go up to block
[38:48] somebody's shot brother amen ah
[38:51] and I land on somebody's foot
[38:54] I'll be on crutches for two weeks
[38:56] that happened like four or five times in
[38:57] middle school and a couple times in high
[38:59] school
[39:00] here I am I'm this athlete I'm like
[39:01] going to class
[39:05] because of ligaments
[39:07] torn ligaments
[39:10] torn ligaments it's separated you know
[39:12] it it caused the bones not to work the
[39:15] right way am I am I what I could
[39:17] probably show you this day I got this
[39:18] one huge ankle this ankle is way much
[39:20] bigger than the other one because of of
[39:22] torn ligaments that was swollen up how
[39:25] many ever swollen an ankle before
[39:27] couple okay not everybody good for you
[39:29] praise God
[39:31] good for you don't envy me
[39:34] it's no fun
[39:36] but Paul's saying love is like a
[39:38] ligament that connects bones helps them
[39:40] to stay connected and move the joints to
[39:43] stay connected
[39:45] it's the it's the glue of perfectness
[39:48] it's the glue of Harmony
[39:51] it keeps uh it keeps the church unified
[39:54] praise God when we have love one for
[39:56] another
[39:56] you got to forgive we got to have long
[39:58] suffering we want to be kind merciful
[40:01] humble praise God and above all this
[40:04] love will keep the body of Christ
[40:06] together
[40:09] Hallelujah I'll just show you a few
[40:11] pictures okay is everybody ready for
[40:12] somebody
[40:13] they're not too graphic
[40:15] okay there's a knee that there's a knee
[40:17] that the ligaments are torn and I can't
[40:19] can you see the definition and now
[40:21] that's swollen up now Cam and Simon had
[40:23] that or Cam and Sam had that they tore
[40:24] some ligaments in their knees in high
[40:25] school
[40:27] now this is what happened to me I'd fall
[40:28] down on somebody's ankle
[40:31] and
[40:32] you tear ligaments in there in the in
[40:34] the ankle area that's the ankle
[40:38] okay it's not just a visual Paul is
[40:40] saying above all have this love have
[40:43] have the ligaments connected to one
[40:45] another now Church how many Brews think
[40:47] about this how many Brews churches are
[40:49] there out there
[40:51] because the ligaments are torn
[40:53] the love is torn between a brother and a
[40:55] sister or a family another family
[40:57] how many bruised bodies are out there in
[41:00] the churches spiritually speaking
[41:04] right there's not Harmony the the body
[41:07] doesn't work like it should there's
[41:08] there's pain there there's hurt they're
[41:11] swollen they're swollen pry right
[41:14] Pride swells up Pride puffs up
[41:17] there's a lot of churches that are like
[41:19] this a lot of Pride and a lot of
[41:21] arrogancy and anger swollen up but God
[41:23] wants us to be the right kind of a joint
[41:26] God wants us to be a body that's free
[41:28] from pain
[41:30] free from anger free from bitterness and
[41:33] Malice and Wrath
[41:35] God doesn't want to spread in our ankles
[41:36] when we come to church
[41:39] so make sure you step off the platform
[41:40] the right way brother
[41:42] I will my God
[41:46] so see love keeps us connected and
[41:48] moving forward together in harmony
[41:51] praise God just like the Bible said I
[41:53] was writing on that verse earlier
[41:57] the Bible said if they don't discern the
[41:59] body of Christ then many are weak and
[42:01] sickly among you okay so many people are
[42:04] weak many body many Christian bodies are
[42:06] weak and sickly and have swelling
[42:07] because they don't judge each other the
[42:10] right way
[42:11] right when we judge each other you
[42:13] should say you know what this sister sin
[42:15] against me I'm going to give her mercy
[42:16] because Jesus gave me mercy now you've
[42:18] judged the right way
[42:21] I'm gonna I'm gonna build this brother
[42:23] up instead of tearing this brother down
[42:24] I'm gonna build him up praise God and
[42:26] we're going to have a healthy church
[42:27] amen
[42:28] Hallelujah we're gonna have a healthy
[42:31] family praise God let me bring it down
[42:33] to your house
[42:34] because we're able to forgive we're able
[42:36] to be patient with one another we're
[42:38] able to have long suffering and know
[42:40] God's gonna work this out God God's
[42:42] ready to forgive me I'm ready to forgive
[42:44] people in my family praise God
[42:46] I'm ready to forgive them I'm not going
[42:48] to hold a grudge against them
[42:49] are there pain yes of course there's
[42:51] going to be emotional pain but we don't
[42:53] have to hold that against them praise
[42:54] God
[42:55] yes we have to guard ourselves yes we
[42:57] never want to be abused yes those are
[42:59] all true but at some point we have to
[43:01] forgive people praise God
[43:03] we have to be ready to say since Jesus
[43:05] forgave me I will forgive them
[43:09] I'm not gonna let this hinder my walk
[43:10] with the Lord
[43:13] I'm not going to be a
[43:15] uh this disfigured part of the body of
[43:18] Christ
[43:19] I'm going to be a healthy part of the
[43:21] body of Christ
[43:23] Hallelujah
[43:26] now here I just look at verse 15 here so
[43:29] put on charity so be connected to one
[43:32] another with God's love and let the
[43:34] peace of God rule your heart
[43:37] to which also you're called in one body
[43:40] that's why I preached last Sunday on uh
[43:43] it's as though you never did in the
[43:44] first place
[43:45] and the Bible says we have peace with
[43:47] God through our Lord Jesus Christ
[43:49] I'm not fighting against God right God's
[43:52] fighting for me Hallelujah God's
[43:53] fighting for you praise God I'm not at
[43:56] war with God hallelujah I'm at war with
[43:59] the devil praise God
[44:00] Hallelujah I have peace with God Amen
[44:03] see he said let the peace of God rule
[44:06] your hearts to which you're called one
[44:08] body and be thankful so in these two
[44:10] verses we have these three attributes
[44:11] love peace and thankfulness praise God
[44:14] let that be the testimony of Our Lives
[44:17] Church
[44:18] let us Walk In Love let us let the peace
[44:20] of God rule our hearts and let us be
[44:22] thankful in every situation
[44:24] amen this is Christian Living
[44:28] this will help us overcome the previous
[44:30] chapters enticing words right
[44:35] all those enticing words about legalism
[44:37] and and sensual things and and mysticism
[44:40] and talking to spirits and all these
[44:42] things this kind of life will help us
[44:45] overcome every Temptation amen loving
[44:47] one another having peace with God being
[44:50] thankful in every situation praise God
[44:51] Paul is giving us the keys to Victory
[44:53] praise God
[44:55] amen
[44:59] now this this verse reminded me of this
[45:01] so I pulled that one up there the
[45:02] kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but
[45:05] righteousness peace and joy in the Holy
[45:07] Ghost
[45:09] so both Paul wrote both of these right
[45:10] so we understand the kingdom of God is
[45:14] spiritual victories in our souls and in
[45:17] our minds praise God
[45:18] it's in living out every day
[45:21] what what Christ died for amen it's
[45:25] living out every day with God's
[45:26] anointing on us praise God
[45:28] amen
[45:30] this is the kingdom of God well brother
[45:32] Jesse I want the kingdom of God well
[45:34] then live righteous have peace and have
[45:36] joy praise God and I say like this I
[45:39] can't give it to you you got to put it
[45:40] on Amen
[45:42] go put it on in the morning or afternoon
[45:44] or whenever you get a chance to put it
[45:46] on put on the blessings of God put on
[45:49] the anointing it's our choice praise God
[45:52] you you and I set our affections on one
[45:55] finger or another
[45:57] we got to look at the word of God and
[45:59] we've got to set our affections on
[46:01] things above we're going to set our
[46:02] affections on the kingdom of God and
[46:04] when we do we have charity we have peace
[46:06] with God we're thankful praise God and
[46:08] we live a righteous life it's the
[46:10] kingdom of God living in US amen
[46:13] that's God's kingdom praise God
[46:17] now let me show you this maybe I can
[46:21] maybe I can show this here
[46:23] I want you to show you know I don't know
[46:25] if I mentioned this one or not but
[46:28] um
[46:32] you know Paul
[46:33] I want to just balance this out again
[46:34] with Miracles you know I love we love
[46:36] when God does Miracles we're all longing
[46:37] for miracles
[46:39] but this thought came to me a while ago
[46:40] let me do the view here
[46:42] I wanted to show you
[46:44] I didn't have time to put it on here so
[46:45] let's
[46:48] this is this is a quote I want to show
[46:50] you
[46:50] look at all the times Paul mentioned
[46:52] miracles to local churches and I gotta I
[46:54] have to fix this so just be patient with
[46:56] me I gotta fix the font size okay
[46:58] so
[47:01] when Paul was writing about Christians
[47:03] and their daily lives
[47:05] look over here on the side here
[47:07] Paul here's Paul's letters Paul's first
[47:09] letter is Romans
[47:11] okay and then his last letter
[47:14] is Philemon
[47:16] so from Romans to Philemon how many
[47:18] times did Paul write to the Saints about
[47:21] miracles
[47:22] it's right here huh uh who can have
[47:25] three plus one Victoria
[47:30] four Skipper two clap
[47:33] now these are the letters to the
[47:34] individual churches in the cities
[47:38] how many times did Paul mention Miracles
[47:40] four times he didn't mention any
[47:42] miracles to the Ephesians
[47:44] Philippians Colossians as well now the
[47:46] church in thessalonica
[47:48] even Timothy the preacher right before
[47:50] he died
[47:51] a church we all love Miracles we all
[47:52] love tongues interpretation prophecy
[47:56] but what did Paul say one day all those
[47:59] things are going to be fulfilled to put
[48:00] away
[48:01] and all it's going to be left is Christ
[48:03] amen hallelujah a glorified body amen
[48:06] I just thought I'd you know the reason
[48:08] I'm bringing this up is because look at
[48:09] this chapter Paul says he writes this
[48:11] colossian church he says crucify mortify
[48:14] these these lusts and he said put on the
[48:17] anointing of God
[48:20] he didn't say put on uh put on Divine
[48:23] Healing although we believe that
[48:27] he said put on these these attributes of
[48:30] a Christian put on the mindset of a
[48:32] Christian and show the love show the
[48:35] love of Christ the thankfulness of
[48:36] Christ amen so the charity of Christ
[48:39] amen let it rule your heart praise God
[48:43] I want to show you that now the three
[48:45] times of course he's talking about the
[48:47] gifts of Miracles and
[48:49] not all work miracles and then Galatians
[48:51] he talks about miracles he says how do
[48:53] you work miracles by legalism or by the
[48:55] hearing of faith of course the hearing
[48:56] of faith
[48:58] I just thought I'd share that with you I
[48:59] wanted to preach on that but I guess
[49:01] I'll just make today that day I preached
[49:02] on it
[49:03] I just want to show that you know that
[49:05] look how Paul emphasizes we've I've
[49:07] preached out through Galatians Ephesians
[49:09] Philippians now I'm in my fourth letter
[49:11] of Paul
[49:12] and look at the emphasis is on
[49:15] mortifying the the sinful nature and
[49:18] being Anointed with the Holy Spirit in
[49:20] your daily life amen
[49:22] putting on these things put on charity
[49:24] put on peace put on thankfulness amen
[49:27] oh I feel like dancing it's victory I
[49:29] know that's a good song buddy Hallelujah
[49:31] that's right that's that's the kingdom
[49:33] of God hallelujah
[49:37] now Church do I believe we're waiting
[49:38] for miracles yes but what do we want our
[49:40] testimony to be when our testimony be
[49:42] complaining until we get the miracle or
[49:44] do we want our testimony to have the joy
[49:46] of God the peace of God until that
[49:48] Miracle comes amen
[49:49] you you know what you know what the
[49:51] choices you know I know what the answer
[49:54] is
[49:55] we want the right testimony praise God
[49:59] now my wife would just tell me I was
[50:00] this morning she was listening to Shane
[50:02] and Shane and we're like wow how do they
[50:03] get all these great songs and this might
[50:05] help Austin
[50:06] maokai with their musician gifts and
[50:09] everything like that I guess Lydia
[50:10] Acacia cares too all those who want to
[50:12] play piano or all those who want to play
[50:14] but I guess Shane and Shane was being
[50:16] interviewed and they said how do you
[50:17] keep coming up with these songs
[50:19] and he quoted Colossians 3 16. he said
[50:22] let the word of God dwell on you richly
[50:25] in all wisdom
[50:27] teaching and admonishing one another in
[50:29] Psalms hymns and spiritual songs singing
[50:31] with Grace in your hearts to the Lord
[50:35] we we saw Phil last year and the last
[50:38] question this little girl she had her
[50:39] hand up the whole time and finally this
[50:41] guy's like let's let's let her ask a
[50:43] question she's waited this whole time
[50:45] and she said Mr Whitcomb how do you how
[50:48] do you how should I write songs
[50:50] and I was I was you know we were
[50:52] expecting some you know some mystical
[50:53] answer like praying fast or uh
[50:56] you know some mystical answer he said
[50:59] just memorize the Bible
[51:01] I thought Hallelujah
[51:03] Hallelujah I'm gonna write songs I
[51:05] wouldn't do this what should I do what's
[51:09] the what's the secret put the word of
[51:10] God in your mind
[51:12] ah feed on God's word all day praise God
[51:17] Hallelujah I want to do something for
[51:19] God put God's word in your mind you'll
[51:21] do something for God
[51:23] Hallelujah where you want to do it it's
[51:24] in your family in your home in your
[51:26] church you want to do it so write those
[51:27] all around you praise God
[51:31] so I thought it was it was fitting that
[51:33] my wife shared that scripture I said I'm
[51:35] just preaching on that scripture this
[51:36] morning huh it's very fitting you shared
[51:37] that so maybe our musicians knew that or
[51:39] maybe I needed it amen
[51:42] maybe we all need it by God's grace let
[51:44] the word of God dwell now that dwell
[51:45] means let it influence you for good
[51:48] okay now think about that you know since
[51:50] Simon's sermon on Wednesday have I let
[51:52] the word of God influence me more or the
[51:54] world influenced me more
[51:56] the word of God
[51:58] right and each one of us have that
[52:00] choice from service to service from
[52:01] Sunday to Wednesday or Sunday to Sunday
[52:04] after however
[52:06] we got a choice which one are we going
[52:07] to let influence us
[52:09] are we gonna let the word of God
[52:11] influence all throughout the week or
[52:13] we're gonna let the cares of this world
[52:14] influence us
[52:18] now look and Josh here's here's the real
[52:20] advice
[52:22] this is the real command of the Holy
[52:23] Spirit don't just do a little bit of the
[52:25] word but do it abundantly
[52:28] I'm gonna say that again
[52:30] as Holy Ghost failed message Believers
[52:33] praise God if we wanted to be influenced
[52:35] for God we've got to listen abundantly
[52:37] to the word and sing abundantly praise
[52:40] God
[52:41] a little bit of feeding on the word of
[52:43] God is not going to help us the way we
[52:45] need to be helped we need to do it
[52:46] abundantly praise God
[52:49] unless we want a body full of
[52:51] source and a body full of swelling and a
[52:53] broken body
[52:55] unless we want broken families or we
[52:56] want broken marriages or broken
[52:58] relationships with with children and
[53:00] parents we know I'm broken and bruised
[53:01] relationships we want loving
[53:03] relationships praise God
[53:05] and this is what does it we let the word
[53:08] of God influence us abundantly
[53:12] in all wisdom or all Supreme
[53:15] intelligence
[53:17] Hallelujah who had more intelligence
[53:19] those Pharisees or Peter
[53:22] Peter
[53:23] right because Peter said Silver and Gold
[53:25] Have I not such as I have I give it unto
[53:27] you look at that that's that's Supreme
[53:29] intelligence right there I'm trusting in
[53:31] the healing powers of Christ amen
[53:34] that's Supreme intelligence praise God
[53:37] well I've got all these proofs you know
[53:39] the Bible's in Accra I got all these
[53:41] proofs against brother Branham but real
[53:42] Supreme intelligence will point us back
[53:44] to the word of God
[53:46] it'll show us what's the truth about the
[53:48] matter praise God
[53:51] so if we want to have the kingdom of God
[53:53] yeah if we want to have the kingdom of
[53:55] God how many want peace to rule your
[53:56] life
[53:58] I don't want War I don't want spiritual
[54:00] Wars to rule my life I want the peace of
[54:01] God to rule my life well if that's to
[54:03] happen we got to have a great influence
[54:05] abundant influence from the word of God
[54:08] and as we do this we'll teach we know
[54:10] teach means instruct I've been over that
[54:12] many times of any serpents
[54:14] if we have this wisdom we'll teach and
[54:17] we'll admonish which means to warn and
[54:20] is strongly encouraged so it can go
[54:21] either way
[54:23] one another in Psalms which is striking
[54:26] chords
[54:27] and hymns which is praising and
[54:29] spiritual songs also also means praising
[54:31] God
[54:32] singing with Grace in your hearts to the
[54:34] Lord
[54:36] praise God in other words we'll
[54:37] encourage one another by singing song
[54:39] specials
[54:41] or sending somebody hey have you heard
[54:42] this new song this song's a blessing
[54:45] right or hey this scripture this
[54:47] scripture is a real blessing this is a
[54:49] real help to us
[54:50] praise God
[54:51] like Simon he preached that one
[54:53] scripture that's a real help to me
[54:55] I was from uh Isaiah 31.
[54:59] and then I looked up other verses about
[55:00] how God will preserve my life
[55:04] yeah I'm going to read that so Simon
[55:06] preached one and I'm going to read it it
[55:07] might help you
[55:09] Proverbs 2 verse 8 this really helped me
[55:11] on I was like I'm just sitting there
[55:12] like crying on Wednesday and I'm like
[55:14] Lord You're so gracious
[55:16] it's like man I I've read that verse
[55:17] before but it never struck me like it
[55:19] did Wednesday night that's what I love
[55:21] about God he brings things out new and
[55:23] old praise God verse 8 he that keepeth
[55:25] the pass of judgment
[55:27] I'm sorry he keepeth the passive
[55:29] judgment and preserves the way of his
[55:31] Saints
[55:32] God is preserving my life
[55:35] you and I we're walking on a certain way
[55:37] we're walking on the way of Holiness
[55:38] amen
[55:39] and God said as we make the right
[55:41] decisions God is going to preserve us on
[55:44] this way praise God that means the
[55:46] storms of life the life like those awful
[55:48] winds we had yesterday praise God almost
[55:49] blew my van off the road
[55:51] those those wins The Winds of every
[55:54] Doctrine will not be able to blow us off
[55:56] the path
[55:57] God's going to keep us now God's going
[55:59] to let us go through some storms he's
[56:01] going to let the storms come but he's
[56:02] going to show us that he's going to keep
[56:04] us on the path amen
[56:06] nothing will be able to overcome us
[56:08] praise God because we've got the
[56:10] Overcomer inside of us amen
[56:12] ah greater see that's in me then he
[56:15] that's in the world praise God
[56:18] thank God Amen
[56:22] oh it's a beautiful promise the Lord
[56:24] gives us beautiful promises here
[56:27] Glory
[56:30] and then he says so I just want to say
[56:32] that again you know and I say I can do
[56:34] better with that I can do better with
[56:35] that you know when I find a scripture a
[56:36] song I need to share with everybody
[56:37] since I have everybody on a text message
[56:39] I need to do better than that so pray
[56:40] for have patience with me can I can I
[56:42] use that verse there
[56:44] I would like to encourage everybody more
[56:47] and I'll tell you what my wife does a
[56:49] good job every Saturday she listens to a
[56:50] sermon for brother and she'll almost
[56:52] every Saturday she'll text me a quote
[56:54] I'm like that's a good quote all right
[56:55] it's just right on timer ooh that's a
[56:57] good one I'm like that's inspired huh
[57:00] Hallelujah
[57:02] that's what it reminds me of
[57:06] that we're supposed to abundantly feed
[57:09] on the things of God and then encourage
[57:12] strengthen one another through songs
[57:14] Praises testimonies like today that's a
[57:17] real encouragement amen
[57:19] Hallelujah
[57:22] and then he says whatever you do in word
[57:24] or deed do all in the name of the Lord
[57:28] Jesus or do all on this account of Jesus
[57:32] giving thanks to God and the father by
[57:35] him so all words and deeds should be
[57:38] done in Thanksgiving
[57:40] so it seems like the Colossians are not
[57:42] like our church we're not fighting
[57:44] physical persecution it was spiritual
[57:46] battles they were fighting
[57:48] and Paul says the key to that is crucify
[57:51] the deeds and the cravings and anything
[57:53] that would come crucify that and put on
[57:56] the Holy Spirit praise God
[57:58] put on the anointing of God
[58:01] and again we see this the second time
[58:03] repeating this chapter be thankful
[58:06] in every trial say Lord I Thank you for
[58:09] this trial
[58:10] I'm going to come out like gold on the
[58:12] other side praise God
[58:14] but help us also recognize Lord I've got
[58:17] some dross in my life
[58:19] I definitely got some draws in my
[58:20] members now
[58:22] I think I should hear some amens on that
[58:23] I got drops I got a sinful nature in my
[58:26] members praise God I understand Lord
[58:28] you've got to take me through trials
[58:30] you've got to allow trials to bring me
[58:32] through this so that on the other end
[58:34] I'll have less dross and I'll have gold
[58:37] praise God Hallelujah the character of
[58:39] Christ amen
[58:41] the nature of Christ
[58:48] like that one guy that one guy I think
[58:50] Naomi and Beecher saw the video this guy
[58:53] this preacher online and now he's a
[58:55] divorce preacher he's got two kids that
[58:57] don't even serve God
[58:59] he calls me out he makes this video
[59:01] about me and he says I tried to show
[59:03] brother Jesse the love of God by sending
[59:04] a text
[59:08] two texts is okay to show God's love
[59:11] but how about show me some love and come
[59:13] to me privately before you make an
[59:14] hour-long video blasting me
[59:17] how about you share your concerns with
[59:19] me before you post the video live
[59:24] the love of God we're talking about the
[59:26] love of God Amen
[59:28] and I don't put any word I don't put any
[59:30] weight on what he says because I cannot
[59:32] be cursed because I'm already blessed
[59:35] and his accusations are false
[59:40] but it just again an example of someone
[59:42] saying I had love I sent them two texts
[59:44] well love is more than just sending a
[59:46] text
[59:47] love can be in the text no doubt about
[59:49] that
[59:52] but when you really love somebody you
[59:53] care about them like before I before I
[59:55] preach anything on Billy Paul and Joseph
[59:56] I know I don't know if you know this but
[59:58] I sent them a a 20 minute video just to
[1:00:00] them privately
[1:00:02] I said I'm trying to do this privately
[1:00:03] before I
[1:00:05] don't want to go public but I might have
[1:00:07] to
[1:00:09] and they just wrote back and I said well
[1:00:11] then I'm going to take it public then
[1:00:13] because they're influencing millions of
[1:00:15] people
[1:00:16] and there's got to be a voice against it
[1:00:18] praise God brother Brandon spoke against
[1:00:19] preachers all the time
[1:00:21] all the time
[1:00:22] but see that to me showed the love of
[1:00:24] God first I sent them copies of my books
[1:00:26] I said I I did it privately first
[1:00:30] okay
[1:00:31] and think about Paul think about all the
[1:00:33] people call Paul called out in these
[1:00:35] letters that got read publicly
[1:00:37] uh-huh
[1:00:39] praise God
[1:00:41] I don't know how I don't know how I got
[1:00:42] there anyways I'm not sure how I got
[1:00:44] there by God's grace it's kind of
[1:00:45] interesting how that happens whatever
[1:00:47] you do in word or D do it all in the
[1:00:49] name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to
[1:00:50] God and the father by him Thanksgiving
[1:00:52] is what we need praise God
[1:00:54] in the midst of our trials let's be
[1:00:55] thankful
[1:00:57] now here we get into the next section
[1:00:59] this this is the final section
[1:01:00] Christianity in the home it deals with
[1:01:03] husbands wives children and servants in
[1:01:05] the home
[1:01:07] okay now how many wish you had servants
[1:01:08] don't raise your hands
[1:01:11] I told my wife that years ago I'm like
[1:01:13] well wish we could just like hire
[1:01:14] somebody you know just to come work for
[1:01:17] us from like
[1:01:18] you know six to ten every night
[1:01:21] you know
[1:01:22] they could do all the dishes fold all
[1:01:23] the clothes and sweep the floors and
[1:01:27] so I wish I wish we had employees
[1:01:32] but I can't afford that right now
[1:01:34] and yes I'm gonna train my children into
[1:01:36] chores they do a lot of chores they do a
[1:01:38] lot of chores especially as I get older
[1:01:39] they do a lot of chores you guys are
[1:01:40] making the Casey makes breakfast every
[1:01:42] day for nine people where's she at
[1:01:45] she stepped out probably working
[1:01:49] but this was the Christian Home in
[1:01:52] Paul's day he had husbands wives
[1:01:54] children and service now this is another
[1:01:56] thought I'm going to drop on and drop it
[1:01:58] on you like I preached before God never
[1:02:00] called Paul to
[1:02:02] and and the the servant system
[1:02:05] that wasn't his calling in life
[1:02:07] Paul never said go protest the Roman
[1:02:09] government and try to end servanthood
[1:02:12] anybody ever think about that
[1:02:15] but what did Paul say Paul said change
[1:02:17] it from the inside out
[1:02:19] he said servants love your Masters like
[1:02:22] you love Christ
[1:02:25] now would that eventually end yes the
[1:02:28] servant would eventually the servant
[1:02:29] system would eventually end
[1:02:33] but does it stumble anybody that God
[1:02:35] allowed a servanthood a type of slavery
[1:02:38] is that somebody Buddy when he allowed
[1:02:40] Israel to be slaves in Egypt for almost
[1:02:41] 440 years
[1:02:44] what was it it was for a testimony
[1:02:48] God does not God did not ordain it but
[1:02:50] God allowed it look at look at what
[1:02:52] we've got a lot look at all the violence
[1:02:53] that God allows the wars look at it
[1:02:55] let's go on look God allows he allows
[1:02:57] abortion he allows these things he
[1:03:00] doesn't support it but he allows it
[1:03:03] because he has to allow this is a drama
[1:03:06] right it's a theater everybody's up on
[1:03:07] the stage and God's got allow people to
[1:03:09] make certain decisions
[1:03:11] right but as we know the Bible said
[1:03:13] prayer can change things amen
[1:03:15] Hallelujah God wants us to see God wants
[1:03:18] to see us intercede with prayer
[1:03:20] God wants to see us to run to someone
[1:03:22] and try to convict them uh to forgive
[1:03:25] and not to be harsh praise God
[1:03:28] God wants us to play the part of a
[1:03:30] Christian amen hallelujah he wants us to
[1:03:33] play The Godly part of the story amen
[1:03:37] so I just thought I'd share that with
[1:03:38] you by God's grace now did God Amen did
[1:03:41] God anoint men to end slavery yes
[1:03:45] or some of our early forefathers they
[1:03:47] were I preached on that last summer
[1:03:49] God anointed them to start the the
[1:03:51] process of slowly changing until we get
[1:03:52] an Abraham Lincoln amen hallelujah
[1:03:55] praise God Amen or in Great Britain uh
[1:03:59] William Wilberforce helped end slavery
[1:04:01] in England
[1:04:02] God anoints men and women for such a
[1:04:05] time as that praise God
[1:04:08] and you got to be patient you got to
[1:04:10] trust God
[1:04:11] am I for slavery of course not
[1:04:13] is anybody for slavery that's a real
[1:04:14] Christian of course not
[1:04:16] but we have to live a Christian Life in
[1:04:18] the conditions that God allows
[1:04:21] all right
[1:04:22] so wives submit yourselves to your own
[1:04:24] husbands as it is fit as it's your duty
[1:04:26] in the Lord
[1:04:29] now this word I just thought I'd share
[1:04:30] this
[1:04:31] it's interesting sisters that it's a
[1:04:33] military term
[1:04:35] so I'm sure her sisters would like a
[1:04:37] drill sergeant for a husband right is
[1:04:39] that is that what the Bible's saying but
[1:04:43] that
[1:04:44] I'm joking
[1:04:45] terminology though that Paul uses
[1:04:48] submit like
[1:04:50] a soldier would submit to his drill
[1:04:52] sergeant
[1:04:53] and the church said
[1:04:56] it's the word
[1:04:58] who ought also
[1:05:01] I can't see
[1:05:03] so it just means to put in subjection to
[1:05:05] obey
[1:05:06] to submit one's control
[1:05:09] it's a military term meaning to arrange
[1:05:11] in a military fashion under the command
[1:05:13] of a leader so you've all seen the
[1:05:15] videos right soldiers line up everybody
[1:05:17] goes right to their position
[1:05:19] no questions does anybody stop and
[1:05:21] question the drill sergeant to the
[1:05:23] general
[1:05:28] they're just funny I think it like shows
[1:05:30] I saw about you know drill sergeants and
[1:05:32] things
[1:05:33] now in non-mare in non-military use so
[1:05:36] this word was used for military but also
[1:05:38] not military
[1:05:40] it just means a voluntary attitude to
[1:05:42] give in
[1:05:44] other words I'll choose okay you can
[1:05:46] have your way
[1:05:48] and uh
[1:05:51] you can have responsibility you can
[1:05:52] carry that burden I'll I'll take your
[1:05:55] way
[1:05:57] so it's a voluntary giving in
[1:05:59] okay
[1:06:01] and what's interesting is you know Paul
[1:06:03] addresses wives here first in the
[1:06:05] Colossians book but in Ephesians he
[1:06:07] addresses husbands first
[1:06:09] I don't know if our Colossians sisters
[1:06:11] need it I don't know I don't know if
[1:06:12] there's any order to that or not
[1:06:14] we all need God's grace amen
[1:06:16] I just thought I'd share that it um
[1:06:19] to see the voluntary attitude so our
[1:06:21] sisters need to have that now as it's
[1:06:22] fitting the Lord now as if it's against
[1:06:24] the word you don't have to do that
[1:06:27] and it's to your own husband not
[1:06:29] somebody else's husband right I'm diver
[1:06:33] now then you get you know Brothers not
[1:06:34] in our church I haven't seen it actually
[1:06:35] in our church but I've seen it in Lima
[1:06:37] and other churches I went to where
[1:06:38] brothers would try to other married men
[1:06:40] would try to influence younger married
[1:06:42] couples
[1:06:44] and it's like whatever that brother said
[1:06:46] and this couple then that sister would
[1:06:48] say well the brother said that and the
[1:06:49] husband's like well I didn't say that
[1:06:52] and it was just it was a area of
[1:06:54] Christian Liberty
[1:06:55] you'd be surprised
[1:06:58] and church let me say like this even as
[1:06:59] a pastor
[1:07:01] as long as I preach something from the
[1:07:03] word yes you should obey that but if
[1:07:05] it's something that I do in my life
[1:07:06] that's my Christian Liberty you and your
[1:07:08] husband and wife don't have to do what I
[1:07:10] do
[1:07:11] that's where Colts come from
[1:07:14] I've been studying Cults lately because
[1:07:15] I've been studying Jim Jones they're
[1:07:17] saying uh these accusers are saying
[1:07:19] brother Branham has the association with
[1:07:20] Jim Jones he has one quote with Jim
[1:07:22] Jones
[1:07:24] Jim Jones went to one of Brothers
[1:07:25] meetings a couple of them but then he
[1:07:27] fell away he he was a wicked homosexual
[1:07:30] Wicked Man abusive man wicked wicked man
[1:07:33] if I've been studying Colts again lately
[1:07:34] and that's one of the things of the cold
[1:07:36] the leader gets full control over
[1:07:38] people's lives
[1:07:40] but the Bible says we're not under
[1:07:41] bondage we're free in Christ Jesus
[1:07:43] the Bible said the preacher is just an
[1:07:45] example I'm just an example
[1:07:47] you're not you don't have to model
[1:07:48] everything I do
[1:07:50] off of my life I'm trying to model my
[1:07:52] life after Christ amen
[1:07:54] I don't want to knock you off again I
[1:07:55] knocked you off a few weeks ago
[1:08:02] so I just want to make sure I bring that
[1:08:04] balance you know
[1:08:05] um
[1:08:06] and the reason I say that is because of
[1:08:07] social media and other things you know
[1:08:08] it's been known that social media often
[1:08:11] makes people jealous of other people
[1:08:13] or discontented so I think in this day
[1:08:16] and age we got to remind our sisters
[1:08:18] just just be concerned with you and your
[1:08:20] husband
[1:08:22] you know and sisters if you're
[1:08:24] discontented with your husband pray for
[1:08:25] him praise God
[1:08:27] pray for him and also submit to him as
[1:08:29] it is fit in the Lord
[1:08:31] right
[1:08:32] because that's one of the things of
[1:08:33] course that all all women not just the
[1:08:35] women in Colossians in colossae but all
[1:08:38] women uh got to learn to submit to their
[1:08:40] own husbands all right
[1:08:42] as the scripture says
[1:08:45] and so just so you know I'm not telling
[1:08:46] Brothers to be a drill sergeants
[1:08:49] don't say bro Jesse said that I didn't
[1:08:50] say that
[1:08:52] I said a sister needs a voluntary
[1:08:54] attitude
[1:08:55] okay
[1:08:56] because remember whatever you reap
[1:08:58] that's what you're going to sow
[1:09:00] if you sow no patience and if you sow
[1:09:03] anger and if you sow strictness that's
[1:09:04] what you're gonna that's what you're
[1:09:05] gonna you're gonna reap that
[1:09:07] right
[1:09:11] Brothers I'm now turn for the brothers
[1:09:15] husbands love your wives and be not
[1:09:17] bitter against them
[1:09:19] now this is the word love this word love
[1:09:21] is the agapo
[1:09:23] it's not filio filo is like the kiss
[1:09:25] kind of love or just like friendship
[1:09:27] kind of love agapo
[1:09:30] is divine love
[1:09:32] it's love it's God's love
[1:09:35] there's my hour
[1:09:38] it's God's love
[1:09:41] and so he says husbands love your wives
[1:09:44] and be not bitter against them so at
[1:09:46] least in the Church of colossi maybe
[1:09:48] some of the men were struggling with
[1:09:49] bitterness against their wives
[1:09:50] like we said like we said maybe some of
[1:09:52] the joints had some swelling in them
[1:09:56] right maybe they didn't have a lot of uh
[1:09:57] maybe uh the brothers weren't loving
[1:10:00] their wives like they ought to
[1:10:02] and this is not sexual love this is a
[1:10:05] husbands have a uh just a sexual
[1:10:07] attraction this is divine love this is
[1:10:10] Selfless Love
[1:10:12] this is agape love this is the same love
[1:10:15] where he said you're the Beloved Church
[1:10:17] of God Amen this is the same beloved
[1:10:19] word
[1:10:20] it's Agape you're the Agape bride you're
[1:10:22] the Agape church so he says husbands
[1:10:24] have agape love towards your wives
[1:10:28] in other words again like we said
[1:10:31] this is the love that doesn't look on
[1:10:33] conditions well you owe me this you did
[1:10:35] that so I'm harming you back this is the
[1:10:37] love that shows Mercy
[1:10:39] amen praise God
[1:10:41] this is the mercy love the Divine love
[1:10:47] and so husbands are here admonish let's
[1:10:50] not be bitter against our wives
[1:10:54] maybe a wife doesn't do exactly what we
[1:10:56] want or a wife doesn't do exactly when
[1:10:57] we want it to be done we as brothers
[1:11:00] we're told not to be bitter against them
[1:11:03] we're told to be patient with them we're
[1:11:05] told to have long suffering with them
[1:11:07] praise God and brothers if you're honest
[1:11:09] you know your wife have to have long
[1:11:11] suffering with you too
[1:11:13] right and the brother said
[1:11:18] and I just thought this was a beautiful
[1:11:19] picture you know in first Samuel one I'm
[1:11:21] going to just read that there I was just
[1:11:23] praying here and I was like oh that's
[1:11:24] right that's what elkana said to Hannah
[1:11:28] um
[1:11:30] the Bible said elkana loved Hannah
[1:11:34] and I just thought this was a look at
[1:11:36] just what a beautiful picture he gave
[1:11:38] her the best food I didn't get I think
[1:11:40] two or three wives
[1:11:42] of course we know that's not a good
[1:11:43] system
[1:11:46] polygamy is an awful system
[1:11:48] cause a lot of many many many many
[1:11:50] trials many troubles
[1:11:54] but verse 5
[1:11:57] but unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion
[1:12:00] so he gave Hannah out of his numerous
[1:12:01] wives there
[1:12:04] I'm sorry yeah two wives yeah
[1:12:06] heniel I'm sorry
[1:12:09] Penn
[1:12:10] y the apanaya and Hannah but he gave
[1:12:13] Hannah the worthy portion of the food
[1:12:17] for he loved Hannah but the Lord had
[1:12:19] shut up her womb
[1:12:21] so I think this is a good example here
[1:12:23] of how husbands are to love their wives
[1:12:26] now Brothers you only got one wife so
[1:12:28] you can give your wife a greater portion
[1:12:30] a lot easier
[1:12:31] okay you don't have to worry about
[1:12:32] dividing up now if you got eight kids
[1:12:34] now you gotta you gotta have a portion
[1:12:35] for your kids you gotta get a portion
[1:12:37] for your wife
[1:12:38] but I don't work in the kitchen too much
[1:12:39] so I can only do that when I go out to
[1:12:40] eat
[1:12:41] but you understand you had two wives but
[1:12:44] he said I love Hannah Morris I'm giving
[1:12:46] her
[1:12:47] I'm giving her more
[1:12:49] or a greater portion now but look at
[1:12:52] this here even though he loved her with
[1:12:55] such a great love
[1:12:57] Hannah was still dissatisfied in life
[1:13:00] because she wanted a child
[1:13:03] okay
[1:13:04] I just thought this was a beautiful
[1:13:06] thought here
[1:13:07] uh verse 8 and then elkana her husband
[1:13:11] said to her Hannah why weepest thou and
[1:13:13] why Edith thou not and why is thy heart
[1:13:15] grief am I not better to thee than ten
[1:13:17] Sons
[1:13:18] I say here's a man that loved his wife
[1:13:22] I hope my wife can say that that I loved
[1:13:24] her really well praise God I I hope so I
[1:13:27] know other people tell me I do I don't
[1:13:28] know that I do but other people say
[1:13:30] brother Jess you do a good job loving
[1:13:32] your family you do a good job your wife
[1:13:33] and I said well I'm trying by God's
[1:13:35] grace I'm not perfect by any means but
[1:13:38] how many brothers want to be like elkana
[1:13:39] praise God
[1:13:41] I want to love my wife in such a way
[1:13:44] that it's like uh just extra portions of
[1:13:46] love
[1:13:49] now of course here she was not upset
[1:13:51] with him but she wanted a child from God
[1:13:54] so I just love this how Hannah she had a
[1:13:57] purpose in her heart you know in other
[1:13:59] words Church you know we'll have we'll
[1:14:01] have lots of good things in our lives
[1:14:02] but if something seems unfulfilled then
[1:14:04] God's gonna drive us to desire that
[1:14:08] I mean she he basically said you don't
[1:14:10] have to desire any children I'm better
[1:14:11] you than 10 Sons
[1:14:13] that's a pretty good man right there
[1:14:15] pretty good man
[1:14:17] I hope you wear a man like that
[1:14:19] all my girls marry men like that better
[1:14:22] than 10 Sons huh
[1:14:24] I just want you to see that you know
[1:14:26] even though she had her needs met in
[1:14:29] that area she still had a purpose in her
[1:14:31] life that needed to be fulfilled and so
[1:14:33] desperation drove her to seek God for
[1:14:36] this praise God and as she saw God God
[1:14:39] heard her prayer and In God's Time and
[1:14:41] season that was answered amen what I'm
[1:14:43] saying is that some areas of our life
[1:14:45] can be really good but there are certain
[1:14:47] areas that may seem uncomfortable or may
[1:14:49] seem unfulfilled keep trusting God keep
[1:14:52] keep seeking God God will answer amen
[1:14:55] Hallelujah
[1:14:57] and brothers that's Ultra I guess the
[1:14:59] next time I preach a marriage banquility
[1:15:00] I'm going to call it the elkana banquet
[1:15:04] I'm gonna say Brothers here's here's
[1:15:06] ways you can love your wife better than
[1:15:08] ten Sons
[1:15:10] so I got to figure out what does Malachi
[1:15:12] do to help out my wife that'd be one son
[1:15:13] okay
[1:15:15] so I know he does the granola he makes
[1:15:18] granola right on Saturday nights and
[1:15:20] so I could start calculating what does
[1:15:21] maokai do here all right now 10 of those
[1:15:25] I got to do better than that well I've
[1:15:28] got a I've got a job I really need to
[1:15:30] study some scripture on elkana how did
[1:15:33] he do this
[1:15:34] ten Sons
[1:15:35] obviously enough late making 10 batches
[1:15:37] of granola next Saturday night
[1:15:40] I actually got to make 11 because it's
[1:15:42] better than 10.
[1:15:44] it's a lot of love
[1:15:46] but I just thought you know I'd share
[1:15:47] that you know here a woman is to submit
[1:15:51] voluntarily just give in her will and
[1:15:53] say okay
[1:15:57] and the man is instructed love show love
[1:15:59] don't be bitter show love
[1:16:02] so let's let's get something from that
[1:16:04] today praise God let's get some today
[1:16:06] that we can take home with us amen
[1:16:09] Hallelujah I think that's beautiful
[1:16:12] you know what's interesting too is that
[1:16:15] go to John 21 I think I'll just share
[1:16:16] this too the difference between agapo
[1:16:18] and Philly Love
[1:16:20] John 21.
[1:16:28] John chapter 21.
[1:16:31] it's just interesting the use of these
[1:16:33] words there is a difference between
[1:16:33] agape and filio
[1:16:36] this is after the resurrection of course
[1:16:40] verse 15. John 21 15.
[1:16:44] so when they had dying Jesus said to
[1:16:46] Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas Agape
[1:16:48] thou me more than these and he said to
[1:16:52] him yea Lord thou knowest that I
[1:16:54] filio d
[1:16:57] he saith unto him feed my Lambs so Peter
[1:17:00] is Fresh Off denying Christ
[1:17:03] and Jesus saying do you have agape love
[1:17:06] for me and he says he said Lord I have
[1:17:08] filio love for you in other words he's
[1:17:10] ashamed he doesn't feel like he's right
[1:17:11] with God
[1:17:13] he can't really Express like Lord I love
[1:17:15] you with all my
[1:17:17] Oh my he feels like he's been defeated
[1:17:20] right
[1:17:21] Jesus is using this word you Agape me
[1:17:23] Divine love you got Divine love Peter
[1:17:25] you just denied me three times
[1:17:27] you have Divine love
[1:17:29] you don't even have the you don't have
[1:17:30] the strength to answer say I I have a
[1:17:32] God now he's going to get on the day of
[1:17:34] Pentecost amen hallelujah praise God
[1:17:36] Amen he's going to get eventually
[1:17:40] but here Jesus says do you have agape
[1:17:41] love Peter says Lord you know I got
[1:17:44] feeling
[1:17:45] in other words he's saying you know I
[1:17:46] love you
[1:17:47] but he can't admit he's basically
[1:17:50] admitting I'm not where I need to be
[1:17:55] and then he asked him again he said to
[1:17:56] him second time Simon son of Jonas Agape
[1:17:59] thou me
[1:18:06] he said to him feed my sheep
[1:18:09] now verse 17 Jesus changes it he said he
[1:18:12] saith unto him the third time Simon
[1:18:14] Senator Jonas filio thou me Jesus
[1:18:17] changes it you can look in the Greek
[1:18:19] so he he he talks to Peter to try to
[1:18:22] show him
[1:18:24] you're not where you need to be right he
[1:18:26] said you have agape love he's showing
[1:18:28] him he's showing Peter you need more
[1:18:29] sanctification praise God
[1:18:32] you don't have this Divine love yet so
[1:18:34] Jesus says Agape Agape now he says do
[1:18:37] you have you have a lesser love for me
[1:18:38] and he says now he's greed now he's
[1:18:41] grief
[1:18:42] the Lord knows see the Lord knows our
[1:18:44] hearts Church
[1:18:46] and church let me say like this we don't
[1:18:47] have to hide anything from God
[1:18:49] God knows right where we're at
[1:18:52] so see Peter was still in a spot where
[1:18:54] he wasn't feeling right with God and so
[1:18:55] Jesus asked him this three times to let
[1:18:58] him know see do you have Agape Agape no
[1:19:00] do you have filio love for me
[1:19:02] because Jesus knew he didn't have agape
[1:19:04] love yet but he was going to get it
[1:19:06] praise God
[1:19:08] because before he left about five or six
[1:19:10] days later he said go ye up and tarry
[1:19:12] there in Jerusalem and wait for the Holy
[1:19:15] Ghost the promise of the father and
[1:19:16] you'll be in due with power from on high
[1:19:18] amen you'll be in due with Agape from on
[1:19:21] high praise God
[1:19:22] to me this shows the love of Christ
[1:19:26] do you have Agape of course Lord you
[1:19:28] know I don't disgrise me I don't have it
[1:19:31] he said well just make sure you feed my
[1:19:33] people
[1:19:34] so see now here's another thought too
[1:19:36] in feeding and serving God's people God
[1:19:38] will give you the love you desire
[1:19:41] and the church said
[1:19:43] well I wish I was more loving I wish I
[1:19:45] could experience that kind of love just
[1:19:46] stay with God's people
[1:19:48] you're going to get it amen praise God
[1:19:51] Agape do you have a Divine love for me
[1:19:53] Lord I've got filio love
[1:19:56] he says well Peter do you have feel that
[1:19:58] love for me yes Lord you know I do
[1:20:01] you know he said then feed my sheep
[1:20:04] praise God let me say like this to you
[1:20:05] parents keep feeding your children
[1:20:07] naturally and spiritually praise God
[1:20:10] keep feeding the Sheep of God
[1:20:12] that shows how much you love Christ
[1:20:16] sometimes you might give them organic
[1:20:18] pizza too you might you might do that
[1:20:19] too
[1:20:21] you might take them out to Chipotle
[1:20:22] every now and then too
[1:20:24] the point is God wants us to have agape
[1:20:26] love
[1:20:28] Divine love praise God
[1:20:31] I just want you to see this Akana had
[1:20:32] this amazing love for his wife that's so
[1:20:35] beautiful
[1:20:36] Jesus has this amazing love for his
[1:20:38] people
[1:20:39] but what needs help our our love is what
[1:20:42] needs help praise God
[1:20:44] and that's what the gospel produces the
[1:20:46] gospel produces a love that doesn't hold
[1:20:48] bitterness
[1:20:49] right that's that's what the gospel
[1:20:51] produces
[1:20:52] don't be get don't be getting in other
[1:20:54] words don't put on bitterness well I'm
[1:20:56] going to be bitter against you today boy
[1:20:58] or girl
[1:20:59] how many bitter honey I'm gonna be
[1:21:00] bitter against you today
[1:21:01] the gospel produces I'm going to put on
[1:21:03] love today
[1:21:05] God help us all praise God we all need
[1:21:08] it praise God
[1:21:10] I need it we all need
[1:21:12] them that's why we keep coming back to
[1:21:14] the house of God keep coming back to the
[1:21:15] house of God
[1:21:17] to grow in Grace and knowledge of the
[1:21:19] Lord
[1:21:21] now church sometimes now
[1:21:23] the Bible says you know wives submit but
[1:21:26] sometimes husbands submit
[1:21:29] you know that's hard for some preachers
[1:21:30] to hear especially if they're
[1:21:31] authoritarian
[1:21:33] or tyrants or whatever they call them
[1:21:36] but remember in Genesis 21 verse 12
[1:21:38] Abraham went to God and said should I
[1:21:40] Cast Away Hagar and my son Ishmael and
[1:21:43] the Lord said hearken unto everything
[1:21:44] Sarah said
[1:21:46] so maybe when there's disagreements in
[1:21:48] marriages you know the the wife feels
[1:21:50] one way the husband feels another way
[1:21:51] the husband needs to take that request
[1:21:53] of the wife he needs to take it to God
[1:21:55] and see what God says about it how does
[1:21:57] he feel after that
[1:21:59] ultimately the choice is up to the man
[1:22:00] right because she's a submit in all
[1:22:02] things
[1:22:04] that's scriptural
[1:22:06] but I just want you to see again you
[1:22:08] know the Bible says submit and love but
[1:22:10] we need submission and love on both
[1:22:11] sides
[1:22:13] but the main need of the woman is to
[1:22:15] submit and the main need of the man is
[1:22:18] to show the love of God Divine love
[1:22:21] agape love
[1:22:25] so see wives are to love their husbands
[1:22:27] too they're supposed to have agape love
[1:22:28] for the husbands too
[1:22:30] right but it's the man that needs to
[1:22:32] express this this is the one he needs to
[1:22:33] have he needs to have his mind more on
[1:22:36] this more often than other times things
[1:22:38] have the love of God expressed towards
[1:22:39] his wife
[1:22:42] praise God
[1:22:46] make sure I sometimes write down last
[1:22:48] minute notes
[1:22:53] I think there was an example I was going
[1:22:54] to share let me think for a moment here
[1:22:55] about marriage
[1:23:03] uh it's not coming to me
[1:23:06] all right let me try to finish here
[1:23:08] I thought I'd read a few uh quotes here
[1:23:10] from Brother Branham
[1:23:11] my brother Brandon was talking about
[1:23:13] Oneness different differentiating from
[1:23:15] uh
[1:23:17] the message
[1:23:18] it's like Oneness is the denomination
[1:23:22] he says uh
[1:23:24] he says if this falls into your offices
[1:23:26] tape among you people that's Oneness he
[1:23:28] said don't misunderstand me now I just
[1:23:30] just because we disagree he said me and
[1:23:33] my wife disagree we sure do I tell her I
[1:23:35] love her and she says don't believe I do
[1:23:41] now this is an interesting quote
[1:23:45] brother Brown says his wife was going
[1:23:47] through menopause
[1:23:48] right and he said it was a very hard
[1:23:51] time for for women to go through
[1:23:53] menopause
[1:23:55] and in this same Series this is the
[1:23:57] question if you haven't listened to this
[1:23:58] in a while I listened to it a few weeks
[1:23:59] ago it's a beautiful series there's only
[1:24:00] four sermons
[1:24:01] and in this series you can hear there's
[1:24:03] some tension between brother Branham and
[1:24:05] his wife and so I think she's going
[1:24:06] through menopause
[1:24:08] and uh
[1:24:12] and so he talks about he just puts
[1:24:14] little things in here about this like
[1:24:15] here and look he's being honest you can
[1:24:17] hear him he said we disagree I tell our
[1:24:19] lover and she says I don't believe I do
[1:24:22] so then we certainly disagree but I'm
[1:24:24] telling you that we sure get along all
[1:24:26] right
[1:24:29] he says now notice maybe now look he's
[1:24:31] being honest with maybe I don't show
[1:24:33] enough signs to her
[1:24:34] that I do love her
[1:24:37] I'm out preaching and coming home and
[1:24:39] getting my fishing rod and go fishing
[1:24:41] see but down in my heart I love her I
[1:24:43] just have to stay away from her that's
[1:24:44] all
[1:24:46] I don't you know I've told my wife about
[1:24:49] this quote before I appreciate a
[1:24:50] different marriage banquets
[1:24:53] there's another quote in this series
[1:24:55] where brother Branham says he tries to
[1:24:57] sit down and spend time with his wife
[1:24:58] but
[1:24:59] she always gets up and she goes to wash
[1:25:00] wash clothes and all these things like
[1:25:02] that and
[1:25:03] so it just seems like she she didn't get
[1:25:06] a lot of time with him
[1:25:07] because he always want to travel and
[1:25:09] preach and then you know coming down
[1:25:11] coming out of those visions
[1:25:13] you know you got to relax your mind so
[1:25:15] that's why he want to go out and hunt
[1:25:17] and go on trips and things like that
[1:25:19] and so then the times when he'd want to
[1:25:21] spend time with her she would
[1:25:24] sometimes she would just go work anyway
[1:25:25] just go do the housework I gotta do my
[1:25:27] housework
[1:25:30] and he here's a 55 year old man 55 year
[1:25:33] old man
[1:25:35] okay
[1:25:37] so
[1:25:38] you know what what's the point of this
[1:25:39] the Bible says husbands love your wives
[1:25:42] so here are we what are we see in
[1:25:43] brother Brown is he does he admit he's
[1:25:45] trying to he's trying to love his wife
[1:25:46] more does he admit that yes
[1:25:48] I need to show more signs that I love my
[1:25:50] wife
[1:25:51] but because of the sacrifice of the
[1:25:53] gospel and trying to balance his own
[1:25:55] mental state and the strain of praying
[1:25:58] for people the physical strain the tone
[1:26:00] it would take on him it did cause some
[1:26:03] conflict in marriage but Church did they
[1:26:05] get along all right
[1:26:12] and now church then think about that
[1:26:13] let's say he's he's traveling all the
[1:26:15] time but what about a pastor and his
[1:26:16] wife they're they're together all the
[1:26:19] time right but even though their
[1:26:20] marriage might be loving they're still
[1:26:21] going to have some trials in life
[1:26:23] the point is everybody's going to have
[1:26:25] trials in life that's the point
[1:26:27] and this was a trial brother Branham had
[1:26:29] in his life
[1:26:30] by God's grace the love of God conquers
[1:26:33] right have we have patience with each
[1:26:36] other
[1:26:38] so if you if you ever said you know
[1:26:40] brother Jesse we're having marriage
[1:26:42] trouble well
[1:26:43] you're in a very good club by God's
[1:26:45] grace
[1:26:45] because every married couple has trouble
[1:26:47] sometimes
[1:26:48] right
[1:26:50] you know you don't have to say man
[1:26:52] I know you do
[1:26:53] every married couple they get bad like
[1:26:55] Satan wants what does Satan one do he
[1:26:57] wants to steal kill and destroy the home
[1:27:01] that's what he does you can see that's
[1:27:02] what he's trying to do now
[1:27:03] steal kill and destroying
[1:27:06] so let's let's be in an attitude where I
[1:27:08] can grow as a better husband I can grow
[1:27:10] as a more I can grow as a I can be a
[1:27:13] more loving husband I can be a more
[1:27:15] submissive wife
[1:27:16] just from those scriptures but again we
[1:27:19] can we can be both right we can be both
[1:27:21] when we're led by the Holy Spirit
[1:27:24] now here's this here's the beers the
[1:27:26] beautiful side to it but only the one
[1:27:28] time uh brother bam said his wife ever
[1:27:30] disrespected remember she slammed the
[1:27:31] door in his face when a brother random
[1:27:34] wouldn't spank Joseph
[1:27:35] and brother Graham said the Lord allowed
[1:27:38] her to get a tumor after that
[1:27:40] and brother Rand was praying for sister
[1:27:42] Meda
[1:27:44] and he's praying he's a he's I think
[1:27:46] he's in Arizona if I'm not mistaken he's
[1:27:48] praying Lord I miss them this morning I
[1:27:51] pray that you'll help them and bless
[1:27:52] them may we come back to this place
[1:27:53] again and now I said they're out there
[1:27:55] because that you sent me there on a
[1:27:56] vision and you fulfilled it and now I'm
[1:27:58] wanting to wait to see what you're going
[1:28:00] to tell me to do next I pray for be
[1:28:02] merciful to her and I said help me in
[1:28:05] the meeting down there and then I kept I
[1:28:07] said Lord don't let it be malignant the
[1:28:09] tumor that Mita had and let that doctor
[1:28:11] wait till that the first of the year to
[1:28:13] take it out I just hate to see her
[1:28:15] hurting I said Lord she didn't mean what
[1:28:18] she did that morning she didn't mean
[1:28:20] that I said Lord not one time has she
[1:28:22] ever said one word about me going into
[1:28:24] meetings staying months or whatever it
[1:28:26] was not one time has she ever opened her
[1:28:29] mouth about it she's always sent my
[1:28:31] clothes to the cleaners washed my shirts
[1:28:33] and had everything ready to go in the
[1:28:35] meeting then she wonders how she can
[1:28:37] serve God
[1:28:39] so sisters is it wrong to send clothes
[1:28:41] to the dry cleaners
[1:28:43] I take almost all my shares to the dry
[1:28:45] cleaners
[1:28:46] I don't want my wife or my children to
[1:28:48] have to iron them they would be iron a
[1:28:50] long time
[1:28:53] so isn't that interesting all she does
[1:28:55] is serve her husband and then she
[1:28:56] wonders God do I do anything for you
[1:29:00] well that's you are as you serve your
[1:29:02] husband that's what brother says you are
[1:29:03] serving God
[1:29:05] you women as you serve your husband you
[1:29:08] serve God of course
[1:29:10] see as you submit right that's the way
[1:29:11] the Bible says wives submit husbands
[1:29:14] love
[1:29:16] and now when they when then when I come
[1:29:19] in I'm all tired and worn out from the
[1:29:21] visions and every praying for the sick
[1:29:22] people coming from everywhere I'd have
[1:29:25] to go out somewhere on a fishing trip or
[1:29:26] a hunting trip why many women would have
[1:29:28] blowed up at that
[1:29:30] what'd she do she got my hunting clothes
[1:29:33] ready for me to go and let me go now
[1:29:35] look let me go
[1:29:37] I said Lord she didn't mean that I said
[1:29:39] she's had to be cut open three times on
[1:29:42] account of she she was cesarean and I
[1:29:44] said Lord I hate to see her have to do
[1:29:46] that again
[1:29:48] now look I just love this brother Ram is
[1:29:49] interceding for his wife
[1:29:51] she's got a tumor
[1:29:52] and I just love that brother Brandon
[1:29:54] brings out all the good things that his
[1:29:55] wife has done
[1:29:57] he didn't bring up any bitterness right
[1:30:01] he could have been better she slammed
[1:30:03] the door right in my face Lord
[1:30:06] now that would be awful right but at the
[1:30:08] same time
[1:30:09] you know husbands sin against their
[1:30:11] wives too
[1:30:12] if they're not loving they've sinned
[1:30:13] against their wives
[1:30:16] he could have been bitter but here the
[1:30:18] Holy Spirit allows him to manifest the
[1:30:19] love of God
[1:30:21] in prayer
[1:30:22] Lord remember she did this she'd done
[1:30:25] that she's even given her physical body
[1:30:26] over for cesarean C-sections she's never
[1:30:29] complained when I need to go get away
[1:30:32] Lord
[1:30:34] and then he said the voice said stand up
[1:30:36] now whatever you say that's the way it
[1:30:39] will be I just love how God gives
[1:30:42] brother Branham the spoken word
[1:30:45] to intercede for his life
[1:30:48] isn't that beautiful
[1:30:50] he has no bitterness in his heart
[1:30:53] but he stands there he says Lord thank
[1:30:55] you for all she's done and look his
[1:30:56] prayer this wasn't even his prayer his
[1:30:58] prayer was Lord just let the surgery be
[1:31:00] after the new year
[1:31:02] but then God does exceedingly abundantly
[1:31:04] amen above all we ask and think amen
[1:31:08] and not only gets rid of the surgery
[1:31:10] gets rid of the whole tumor praise God
[1:31:13] he says stand up whatever you say that
[1:31:15] it will be I wait just a minute I said
[1:31:16] before the doctor's hands will touch her
[1:31:18] the hand of God shall take the tumor
[1:31:20] away and it won't even be found
[1:31:23] and that's how it turned out
[1:31:25] so the man would be he'd be there in the
[1:31:26] service he said is that right honey and
[1:31:28] you hear a sister of me me to say Amen
[1:31:31] amen that's right
[1:31:33] just a good example of husbands love
[1:31:36] your wives as Christ loved the church
[1:31:39] let's stand to our feet by God's grace
[1:31:40] musicians can come I'll stop right there
[1:31:42] I'll get on the children maybe next time
[1:31:44] by God's grace
[1:31:49] Hallelujah
[1:31:51] how many want the peace of God to rule
[1:31:53] your heart today
[1:31:55] so many things were said in those verses
[1:31:57] that's what I tell you like with Paul's
[1:31:58] letters they are so concentrated there
[1:32:01] is so much in there
[1:32:04] like I could just preach on that one
[1:32:05] verse today about
[1:32:06] uh building people up just build people
[1:32:09] up don't tear people down I mean we
[1:32:10] could have spent the whole service just
[1:32:11] on that
[1:32:13] but see how God put so much in there so
[1:32:16] that we can live off this our entire
[1:32:17] lives
[1:32:19] I got a feeling sister Hua well Jesse's
[1:32:21] going to be trying to grow and love the
[1:32:22] rest of my adult life
[1:32:24] all right darling but also I think the
[1:32:27] rest of my life sir I'm gonna be
[1:32:28] learning how to love my wife
[1:32:32] how to encourage my children and not
[1:32:35] provoke them
[1:32:36] I got a feeling our sisters will be
[1:32:37] learning to submit their whole lives
[1:32:39] don't you
[1:32:41] we're gonna be learning our whole lives
[1:32:43] let's build each other up instead of
[1:32:45] tearing people down
[1:32:48] now I've heard preachers church I've
[1:32:50] heard preachers say we could never live
[1:32:52] this but I disagree
[1:33:00] are we growing in some areas absolutely
[1:33:03] we're not perfect
[1:33:05] but when I hear preachers say we can't
[1:33:06] live this I'm like oh no we can live
[1:33:08] this my wife submits to me
[1:33:09] I hope she can say I love her Hallelujah
[1:33:13] oh my children can say I've raised them
[1:33:15] in the fear and admonition of the Lord I
[1:33:17] hope my children could say I didn't
[1:33:18] provoke them to anger I hope I never
[1:33:19] made Lydia Malachi mad like that
[1:33:22] amen hallelujah
[1:33:24] I don't ask him all these questions
[1:33:25] before service and plan it out so I just
[1:33:28] trust it by God's grace I haven't
[1:33:30] provoked them to be anger
[1:33:32] I hope I showed that Mercy praise God
[1:33:35] I hope that's my been my testimony
[1:33:37] because I've showed the mercy of Christ
[1:33:40] you know why because Christ has been
[1:33:41] merciful to me

[1:33:45] Mercy today
