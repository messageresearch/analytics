[0:13] while I was out um so we had brother
[0:16] Keith Randolph and brother Frank Ward
[0:17] preached for us sorry it wasn't recorded
[0:20] uh but uh the people were in Heavenly
[0:21] places by God's grace and a lot of
[0:24] people wanted a closer walk with the
[0:25] Lord is that right was that the first
[0:27] service was about having a closer walk
[0:29] with the Lord hallelujah so I trust
[0:31] you're enjoying a closer walk with Jesus
[0:33] hallelujah amen tonight by God's grace
[0:36] we' like to preach on proving all things
[0:37] part 20 we looked at part 19 last week
[0:39] on the Elijah this days the Lord Jesus
[0:42] Christ in other words the spirit of
[0:43] Elijah is really the spirit of the Lord
[0:45] Jesus Christ it's the Holy Spirit uh
[0:48] tonight I'd like to look at proven all
[0:49] things part 20 and we'll look at Vain
[0:51] babblings and endless
[0:54] questions 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse3
[1:01] and friends you know with the poll if
[1:04] you poll on God's Gift God will speak
[1:05] right to you how many know that by God's
[1:07] grace happen numerous times this weekend
[1:09] so uh we just got to be reminded by the
[1:12] Holy Spirit we just got to stir up our
[1:13] minds by way of remembrance that God
[1:15] wants to meet our needs God cares about
[1:17] us amen hallelujah uh we must draw nigh
[1:19] to God and then God will draw n to us
[1:21] hallelujah we can cast our cares on God
[1:23] because he cares for us
[1:25] amen we'll read verse just three and
[1:28] four and why don't read those together
[1:29] I'll give you a little bit of chance to
[1:31] read There by God's grace you already
[1:32] sang a lot but i' like to hear your
[1:34] voice a little more and hopefully I'll
[1:36] hear a few amens here tonight by God's
[1:37] grace here so chapter chapter 1 verse 3
[1:40] and 4 let's read that on three 1 2 3 as
[1:44] I besought Thee to abide still at
[1:47] Ephesus when I went into Macedonia that
[1:51] thou mightest charge some that they
[1:54] teach no other Doctrine neither give
[1:57] heed to fables and endless gen ologies
[2:01] which minister questions rather than
[2:03] Godly edifying which is in faith so do
[2:07] praise God may God add his Blessing to
[2:09] ring of's word you may be
[2:22] seated we know God's spirit is here he
[2:25] said wherever two or three gathered
[2:26] there I am in the midst of them
[2:28] Hallelujah we've worshiped God
[2:30] he inhabits the praise of your people
[2:31] how many feel God was in your praise
[2:33] tonight amen God was guiding you into a
[2:35] closer walk God was guiding you into
[2:37] your worship praise God you weren't
[2:39] praising by your own power you're
[2:41] praising by the power of God Amen
[2:43] Hallelujah so we know God's here and uh
[2:45] you know this weekend is another great
[2:47] reminder of that how God is so gracious
[2:49] and merciful to us so we like to look at
[2:52] uh the subtopic proving all things and
[2:54] looking at vain babblings uh a couple
[2:56] weeks ago I was studying on this and I
[2:58] was uh I felt like it was quick and by
[3:00] the Holy Spirit about the number of
[3:02] times if I'm not mistaken it's either
[3:03] five or six times Paul told
[3:06] Timothy to be careful not to spend his
[3:10] time on Vain babblings and endless
[3:14] questions and I was just struck uh by
[3:17] that that was so uh uh that was so
[3:19] inspired to me because the same man said
[3:22] prove all
[3:24] things right the same man that said
[3:25] prove all things in 1 Thessalonians
[3:27] 5:21 hold fast that which is good the
[3:30] same man says avoid vain
[3:34] babblings avoid endless
[3:36] genealogies so we have a balance right
[3:39] right and uh trust by God's grace
[3:41] tonight we'll look at the context of
[3:42] each of these times and uh trust be a
[3:46] blessing to you uh and of course I think
[3:48] you probably know where I'm going you
[3:50] know the final scriptures I'll probably
[3:52] close with right uh that that give us
[3:55] the instruction about uh how to how how
[3:57] to deal with these type of things I like
[3:59] to though go to a few things here if
[4:01] you're here in uh uh the New Testament
[4:04] let's go to acts 17:21 if you have your
[4:06] Bibles there I'm going to put my
[4:08] bookmark there in 1 Timothy we'll be
[4:09] coming back there we'll spend a lot of
[4:11] time here uh in Paul's Epistles 1
[4:15] Timothy and second Timothy but while
[4:17] we're uh I just want to lay a quick
[4:18] Foundation here acts
[4:22] 17:21 you remember this is Paul in
[4:24] Athens uh 7 act 17 is a beautiful
[4:26] chapter this is the chapter where uh the
[4:28] bereans were more noble than those of
[4:31] thessalonica because everything Paul
[4:33] said they took it back to the Bible and
[4:35] made sure it was right that's your job
[4:38] Church you can't just sit there and
[4:40] Trust well brother Keith said it right
[4:41] or brother Frank or brother Brooks or
[4:43] brother Simon or brother Jesse you've
[4:45] got to go take it back to the word of
[4:47] God yourself that proves you really love
[4:50] God when you want to make sure that
[4:52] you're believing the truth of God's word
[4:55] hallelujah if we're not careful we'll
[4:57] get into a habit of not not taking what
[5:00] was heard we'll forget ex exactly what
[5:02] was preached it'll just go over our
[5:04] heads we'll we'll go to church we'll say
[5:06] Amen everything will look good on the
[5:07] outside but if we're not careful we'll
[5:09] lose our hunger and Zeal for the Lord
[5:12] and then we just start playing Church
[5:13] the Bible calls that uh a guile a
[5:16] pretending we don't want to pretend I'm
[5:18] going to preach on Lev maybe next week
[5:19] by God's grace I preach on that over in
[5:21] uh Iowa was well received we don't want
[5:24] to pretend we want to have real sincere
[5:25] Christianity by God's grace that's the
[5:27] way you'll prove it to God you take what
[5:29] you heard and you'll go back and listen
[5:30] to the brother you know you can't do it
[5:32] this weekend but you go back and listen
[5:33] to Brother Paul's sermon or brother
[5:34] Aaron's sermon or even my sermon go and
[5:37] listen to it again Hallelujah don't
[5:39] forget what you heard praise God you
[5:41] must apply it to your life right or else
[5:44] what's what's the enemy going to do the
[5:45] thing that God gave you during the
[5:47] service the enemy might snatch it out of
[5:48] your mind that's the scripture so you
[5:51] want to be very careful uh now here's
[5:53] here's the trouble though the trouble
[5:54] with the Athenians was that they were
[5:57] spent all their time talking about new
[6:00] things right they always want to hear
[6:02] something new they weren't satisfied
[6:04] unless they had something new right
[6:06] verse uh 21
[6:09] 17:21 for all the Athenians and
[6:11] strangers which were there spent their
[6:12] time in nothing else but either to tell
[6:14] or to hear some new thing and then
[6:16] remember Paul says a few verses later
[6:18] the unknown God is the one that I'm
[6:20] declaring to you you know all about
[6:23] these other gods remember think about
[6:24] that every day was a new thought a new
[6:26] idea a new doctrine a new God right
[6:30] Hindu has over thousands of gods maybe
[6:32] Millions if I'm not mistaken sometimes I
[6:34] get this the religions mixed up of the
[6:36] world you know there's so many false
[6:38] ones uh but you know they so they could
[6:41] have endless days of bringing a new
[6:43] thought a new God that operates like
[6:44] this and that and Paul said you've
[6:46] wasted your time the unknown God is the
[6:49] god that I'm preaching to you Hallelujah
[6:51] and I love what Paul says Paul says he's
[6:52] not far from you in fact he wants you to
[6:55] reach out and try to touch him
[6:57] Hallelujah Reach Out And Touch the Lord
[6:59] as he passes by am you'll find he's not
[7:02] too busy to hear your heart's cry how
[7:04] many believe that tonight amen
[7:07] hallelujah remember God and Paul tells
[7:09] him you know this is the one God who's
[7:11] determined your times in verse 26 he
[7:13] determined what time you live he
[7:15] determined the bounds of your habitation
[7:16] he knew you'd live in akan Ohio
[7:18] Hallelujah that why so you would seek
[7:21] God God knew you'd best seek God here in
[7:23] this area and in this time amen 2024 God
[7:27] knew this was the best time for you to
[7:29] seek him him
[7:31] Hallelujah he's not far from each one of
[7:34] us and the Bible said you have to feel
[7:35] after him that's why brother said part
[7:37] of being on fire is reaching out in the
[7:40] spirit that means talking to the spirit
[7:42] talking to God say God move on my behalf
[7:44] God speak to me Spirit move for me amen
[7:48] hallelujah you know I don't like that
[7:50] Ocean song necessarily but a sister sang
[7:52] it at church there in Iowa and I thought
[7:54] that's right Spirit lead me where my
[7:55] trust is Without Borders so see there's
[7:58] a part of that song that's a good good
[7:59] part other parts maybe not so much I'm
[8:02] not going to get into the lyrics of that
[8:03] tonight but you understand what I'm
[8:04] saying you got to reach out in the Holy
[8:06] Spirit God I really need you to move God
[8:09] uh I need your grace I I need I'm
[8:12] looking for you to move God hallelujah
[8:14] I'm reaching out the spirit God I'm
[8:16] trying to go beyond my my human thoughts
[8:18] I'm trying to be I want to be led by the
[8:20] Holy Spirit praise
[8:21] God that's what Paul's saying Reach Out
[8:24] feel after God God is at you God give me
[8:27] a a dream give me a vision give give me
[8:29] a tongue give me interpretation nothing
[8:31] is too hard for God hallelujah amen one
[8:35] of those Brothers came up for prayer
[8:37] this weekend and he said brother I've
[8:38] just been praying that somebody would
[8:40] come in and preach on what you
[8:42] preached and he was crying weeping in
[8:44] tears I mean I've rarely seen a man cry
[8:46] like that rarely and he went like this
[8:49] he said from the beginning he said like
[8:51] this he went from the beginning every
[8:53] single thing you said was me you preach
[8:55] my whole life and I said Glory I said I
[8:57] didn't preach it it was Jesus amen
[9:00] hallelujah praise God and that was a
[9:02] sermon where I couldn't I think that was
[9:04] a sermon where I couldn't sleep I tried
[9:06] to take a little nap you know we're up
[9:07] to like 1:00 a.m. or 2 a.m. every single
[9:09] night you know and traveling and uh the
[9:11] Microsoft system went out you know did
[9:13] you know that your pastor was at the
[9:14] airport when that when that happened had
[9:17] to deal with all the Microsoft failing
[9:18] you know but it didn't set us back too
[9:21] much but you know uh it really messed up
[9:23] our
[9:25] plans but you know God has a way to do
[9:27] things and so I couldn't wrestle all the
[9:29] scriptures the Holy Spirit gave me while
[9:30] I was just trying to nap I just wrote it
[9:32] down and and preached all those and they
[9:34] said that's exactly what they needed to
[9:35] hear so see God's even in the times you
[9:38] can't sleep and you want to
[9:40] sleep right the footsteps of the
[9:42] righteous are
[9:43] what so that means even you're L you're
[9:46] rising up and you're laying down you're
[9:47] laying down you're not able to sleep
[9:49] God's still in that church I got a good
[9:51] reminder of that amen God's even in the
[9:54] times I don't get rest when I like to
[9:55] get
[9:56] rest Hallelujah and then he gave me
[9:58] Grace to pray you know an hour after
[10:00] service for each person pray we prayed
[10:02] for an hour for people coming up that's
[10:04] a real prayer line now our prayer lines
[10:06] are good too don't get me wrong they're
[10:07] all good no matter how the S the the
[10:09] size but I'm saying even though I don't
[10:11] get enough sleep God will give me Grace
[10:12] to get through it Hallelujah God will
[10:14] give you Grace when you feel like you
[10:16] don't have strength just Reach Out And
[10:17] Touch the Lord he'll give you strength
[10:18] hallelujah amen trust God with all your
[10:22] heart and see for in him we live see
[10:25] we're living in Christ amen in him we
[10:27] move in Christ and we have are being
[10:29] it's in Christ hallelujah our the Bible
[10:32] said our lives are HID in Christ amen
[10:36] hallelujah and because it says in verse
[10:38] 29 We're The Offspring of God but Paul
[10:41] was rebuking these people remember some
[10:42] believed some doubted I like that at
[10:44] least some be at least somebody believed
[10:46] Hallelujah at least somebody was blessed
[10:48] that that's all I want to see church
[10:49] when I Minister here I just want to see
[10:51] that somebody's blessed I mean I would
[10:53] hope that at some point you know or
[10:55] maybe maybe there's lots of services
[10:57] where everybody leaves here blessed but
[10:58] I'm hoping at least somebody is blessed
[11:00] Hallelujah because I'm trying to do God
[11:02] a service with it being his will amen
[11:06] not not against his will I'm trying to
[11:08] do his will hallelujah
[11:10] amen but
[11:12] see here this people this Athenians they
[11:15] were such idolators that all they want
[11:17] to do is hear something new but remember
[11:20] God's not in just giving new stuff right
[11:23] God gives you new and old because you
[11:26] forget the old righten that's right
[11:29] hallelujah
[11:30] amen right uh that's according to uh
[11:33] Matthew
[11:35] 13:52 uh want to pull that up there hun
[11:37] you're real fast there it's nice to be
[11:39] back in this Sanctuary too by God's
[11:40] grace hallelujah amen therefore every
[11:44] scribe instructed in the Kingdom of
[11:45] Heaven is like a man that's a
[11:46] householder which bringeth forth out of
[11:48] his treasure things new and old amen so
[11:51] see the Athenians were were deceived by
[11:53] Satan Satan was like oh I'll give you a
[11:54] new thought every day but it was taking
[11:56] them the wrong places
[11:58] amen it wasn't guiding them to Christ so
[12:01] see just cuz people have new things all
[12:02] the time that's what the Bible says amen
[12:04] the Bible said ever learning but never
[12:06] able to come to the knowledge of the
[12:08] truth praise God think about that these
[12:10] people in these churches mega churches
[12:11] most churches are lost most churches are
[12:14] very few will find the narrow road that
[12:15] leads to life amen think about that
[12:17] they're learning new things brother
[12:19] Austin but it's not getting them any
[12:20] closer to God because they haven't got
[12:22] the old things yet Hallelujah they
[12:24] haven't got the oldfashioned way of
[12:26] repent of your sins and be baptized in
[12:28] the name of Jesus Christ amen for the
[12:31] remission of your sins and you shall
[12:33] receive the Holy
[12:34] Ghost and the brother told me too he
[12:36] said you preached on repentance he said
[12:38] I've been telling brother Brooks we
[12:40] needed that for
[12:41] months and all I said was there's three
[12:43] levels there's three there's three
[12:45] attributes of repentance first you
[12:47] change your
[12:48] mind see if you say I'm repentant but
[12:51] you don't change your mind about your
[12:52] sin you haven't repented if you still
[12:55] like that you're still making plans to
[12:56] do that you didn't repent you just got
[12:58] caught right right or you just felt bad
[13:01] about it that's called worldly sorrow
[13:04] you got to change your mind then you got
[13:06] to hate your sin the Bible the the Greek
[13:08] says abhor your sin right you have to
[13:11] actually hate the sin and third you got
[13:14] to make amends for it amen go and say to
[13:17] that person I'm sorry I sinned against
[13:19] you amen now you've repented and the
[13:22] church said amen and the the one one
[13:25] brother's in his 70s there he said he's
[13:27] been a stable the church that church has
[13:28] been going on one less year than us I
[13:30] think it was or two I think they passed
[13:32] their 16 or 17 year anniversary we just
[13:34] passed 18 it was interesting there in
[13:36] Lima uh God took me out in 2006 and then
[13:39] God took brother Brooks out either 2007
[13:40] or
[13:41] 2008 then God took cam out then God took
[13:44] Simon out so God knows what he's doing
[13:46] hallelujah amen so don't forget that
[13:49] friends we need things new and old Peter
[13:52] said remember in second Peter chapter 1
[13:54] Peter said I'm going to keep bringing
[13:55] these things to remembrance until I die
[13:58] basically
[13:59] I'm going to remind you now here's
[14:00] something that bless the church friends
[14:02] you you and I have to ask God say God
[14:05] add to me Faith add some Faith to my
[14:07] life when was the last time you said God
[14:09] add faith God add virtue God add
[14:12] knowledge and for the brothers that
[14:14] really needed it God give me Temperance
[14:15] over sensual passions add that to my
[14:18] life I need something from God
[14:21] hallelujah and then add patience like I
[14:23] told those young people now you can have
[14:25] patience and wait to marry the right
[14:26] woman right and not go off often do
[14:29] wicked things with these other worldly
[14:31] women and I said now you sisters can
[14:33] wait for the right man cuz now you got
[14:35] patience hallelujah praise God after
[14:39] patience uh uh brotherly kindness I'm
[14:41] sorry no godliness after patience
[14:44] godliness you love your enemies
[14:46] brotherly kindness you love the church
[14:48] remember God won't give you the Holy
[14:49] Ghost until he gives you brotherly
[14:50] kindness so make sure you treat the
[14:52] church the right way right amen right
[14:55] God's not going to give you the Holy
[14:56] Ghost if you're going to mistreat people
[14:57] in the church amen God said the last
[14:59] thing I'm giving you before I seal that
[15:01] that that Tabernacle that pyramid the
[15:03] last thing I'm giving you is brotherly
[15:04] kindness for your brothers and sisters
[15:06] Hallelujah so you can be kind to the
[15:09] family of God
[15:10] hallelujah going off on all these
[15:12] different scriptures not really my notes
[15:14] but I just kind of in preacher mode I've
[15:16] been preaching a lot lately by God's
[15:17] grace amen but see they they Satan tried
[15:21] to deceive them oh here's something new
[15:22] new new they got distracted by all the
[15:24] new they forgot about the truth they
[15:27] forgot about the old things of God
[15:29] and they didn't even recognize the
[15:31] unknown God right there in their
[15:32] presence they didn't even recognize him
[15:33] that's how Jesus is many times Jesus is
[15:35] in a church and he's unrecognized right
[15:38] right they don't see Jesus what's Jesus
[15:39] want what's Jesus trying to do what's
[15:41] Jesus trying to what's Jesus trying to
[15:43] produce he's trying to produce the
[15:45] character of this word in you and I
[15:47] praise God am that's what he's trying to
[15:49] do
[15:51] Hallelujah now if you put this one up
[15:53] here uh Proverbs 264 and 5 yes the Bible
[15:57] says prove all things I believe that yes
[15:59] the Bible says first uh John 4 try every
[16:02] Spirit whether they be of God or not
[16:04] believe not every Spirit don't believe
[16:05] every Spirit try them by the word of God
[16:09] hallelujah 1 Peter 3:15 always have an
[16:11] answer for the hope that you have within
[16:13] you with meekness and in fear right so
[16:17] the Bible tells us prove all things try
[16:18] them have answers ready but then the
[16:21] Bible also says avoid foolish
[16:25] questions and endless genealogies
[16:29] that don't edify people and here's a
[16:31] good one too this is I always like this
[16:34] answer fools but don't answer
[16:36] fools I like how Solomon gives us the
[16:38] balance in other words sometimes you
[16:40] answer a fool sometimes you don't answer
[16:43] fools here's how you know he tells us
[16:46] answer not a fool according to his folly
[16:47] lest thou also be like unto him so see
[16:50] this is the time you don't answer fools
[16:52] when you can tell you're getting in the
[16:53] flesh and you're going to start you know
[16:55] trying to attack them or something like
[16:57] that if you don't have the grace in your
[16:59] heart to be wise and kind don't answer a
[17:03] fool right or if the Holy Spirit tells
[17:05] you they blasphemed don't pray for them

[17:16] answer a fool right what the Bible say a
[17:18] fool doesn't believe in God uh yeah a
[17:20] fool says there's no God so atheists
[17:23] well we know there are there could be
[17:24] people that go to church that are fools
[17:25] as
[17:26] well Jesus even called his only
[17:28] disciples like Copus and his friend
[17:30] you're fools slow to believe the word of
[17:32] God so people that don't recognize the
[17:34] message of this hour Hallelujah they
[17:36] could be fools amen some of them could
[17:39] be if they fail to recognize the word
[17:42] for the hour amen that's what Jesus says
[17:45] Jesus tells those c as his friend you
[17:46] don't recognize what God's doing this
[17:48] was spoken by the prophets you should
[17:50] have recognized fools slow of heart to
[17:52] believe everything the prophet said
[17:54] about the Messiah hallelujah amen
[17:57] amen glory
[17:59] now here's how you know when answer a
[18:01] fool according to his folly lest he be
[18:02] wise in his own conceit so if a fool is
[18:06] is conceited and you know you by the
[18:09] Holy Spirit you can humble him in a in a
[18:11] wise way go ahead and answer that fool I
[18:14] see all the time on the comments on
[18:15] YouTube all the time in the emails all
[18:17] the time they think they know something
[18:19] like the latest one is Hebrews 1 says uh
[18:22] God has spoken to us in the prophets in
[18:24] Sundry times but now he's spoken to us
[18:26] by his son and people will say oh see
[18:28] there's no prophets brother Jesse that's
[18:30] a foolish thing to
[18:31] say and so I'll answer the fool I'll say
[18:34] did you ever read the book of
[18:36] Acts agabus is a prophet Paul's a
[18:39] prophet Peter's a prophet they all
[18:42] prophesied that's a foolish thing to say
[18:45] Jesus was the last prophet uh read your
[18:48] Bible Hallelujah uh read the book of
[18:51] Revelation 100 AD 70 years after Jesus
[18:55] left a man is still prophesying and the

[19:08] written Satan right what they trying to
[19:11] they're trying to ultimately attack
[19:12] brother
[19:13] random see but they're wrong but if you
[19:16] got the wisdom of God if you know the
[19:17] answer if you know you can say in a
[19:18] humble way go ahead and say it you'll
[19:20] show them they're conceited they're
[19:21] arrogant and the if they're really
[19:23] sincere they'll admit I'm
[19:25] wrong I've had that one time I had a a
[19:28] tape worshiper maybe I shouldn't say
[19:29] that one time I had a tape worshiper say
[19:32] uh U he was saying we should just play
[19:35] the tapes I said brother brandham said
[19:37] the most important thing of this day is
[19:39] a preacher who can rightly divide the
[19:41] word of Truth he said no he didn't prove
[19:43] it I said in the text he text me right
[19:45] back brother said it in 1957 or 59 he

[20:31] we got that Cornerstone we cannot be
[20:33] deceived and we can answer fools

[20:38] fol
[20:39] Hallelujah
[20:44] Glory so you know as I was studying this
[20:47] a few weeks ago I just got a fresh
[20:49] understanding we have to have a balance
[20:51] on answering questions amen we don't
[20:53] have to answer every single
[20:56] question Hallelujah
[21:00] sometimes I would put pressure on myself
[21:01] I have to answer every single question
[21:03] no I don't I don't have to it's a
[21:07] balance the same man that said prove all
[21:08] things said avoid them avoid foolish
[21:11] questions so let's prove it by God's
[21:13] grace here's another one too this is for
[21:15] the people that uh for all the people
[21:17] that won't read my books or won't listen
[21:18] to brother random or won't uh listen to
[21:20] the other side uh Proverbs 18113 said he
[21:24] that answers a matter before he hears it
[21:26] it is a Folly and shame unto him that
[21:29] sounds like foolishness to me uhhuh so
[21:31] see it's a fool that says uh that
[21:34] attacks brother Brandon but they won't
[21:36] look at the other side of what brother
[21:37] Ram actually said amen it's a fool that
[21:40] would do that amen the Bible says so and
[21:44] that's why I have very little time for
[21:46] these people because they won't even
[21:48] read my book they won't even uh uh uh
[21:50] study the the things the videos I put
[21:52] out that shows they're not really
[21:54] looking for truth right the noble ones
[21:57] the spiritual nobility the spiritual
[21:59] family of the king of kings and Lord of
[22:01] lords they search the scriptures daily
[22:04] whether those things be so Hallelujah we
[22:07] got to stay in our Bibles friends the
[22:08] truth shall set us free
[22:10] hallelujah hallelujah we must stay in
[22:12] the scriptures that way we won't be
[22:14] deceived Hallelujah Jesus said Beware
[22:16] lest any man deceive you what the Bible

[22:27] what the enemy will go after he'll go

[22:35] enemy does he tries to keep in creep
[22:37] into people's houses and allow them to
[22:39] enjoy lust give them false teachings

[23:55] instruction of the Bible now we just got
[23:56] to live it church amen amen amen every
[23:59] day God help me to live it amen just a
[24:02] closer walk with the granted Jesus is my
[24:05] plea daily walking close to thee
[24:07] Hallelujah dear Lord let it be
[24:09] Hallelujah we know the doctrine that
[24:11] means we got more responsibility for the
[24:13] word of
[24:15] God glory like some of these brothers
[24:18] have confessed to me they just stopped
[24:19] reading their Bible they stop listen
[24:20] they can't remember the last time they
[24:21] read their Bible the last time they
[24:23] listened to a tape of other random no
[24:25] wonder they're struggling with
[24:26] porn no wonder they're struggling with
[24:29] uh immorality and lying and stealing and
[24:32] and and and money stealing money and no
[24:34] wonder they struggle with that they're
[24:35] not feeding on the things of God
[24:37] hallelujah
[24:40] amen oh it's so important to stay in the
[24:42] word of God notice no other Doctrine
[24:46] there's only one faith I love it
[24:47] Ephesians 4:5 there's one Lord One Faith
[24:50] one baptism and the church said there's
[24:53] one Faith there's one way to believe
[24:55] there's one interpretation to the Bible
[24:57] amen amen not 500 not a th000 some
[25:00] people say there's 90 some thousand
[25:01] denominations there's not 90,000 Faith
[25:03] there's only one Faith Hallelujah did
[25:06] you see the uh Republican National
[25:07] Convention last week they opened it with
[25:09] a republican from California praying to
[25:12] the Hindu god and she called the Hindu
[25:15] god the one true God I said that's
[25:18] blasphemy there's only one God his name
[25:20] is Jesus Christ
[25:22] am sir hallelujah amen right and didn't
[25:27] it brother R tell Saints didn't he tell
[25:29] us that the politics and church are
[25:32] going to unite and the church said am
[25:35] we've been told we've been warned I'll
[25:37] say like this we've also been
[25:40] rescued the great Holy Spirit has
[25:42] rescued us out of the mother harlet and
[25:44] the daughter systems hallelujah amen God
[25:48] rescued us out of the Assemblies of God
[25:50] God rescued us out of the Lutheran
[25:52] church amen God res us rescued us out of
[25:54] the Christian Missionary lives God's in
[25:56] the rescuing business h
[26:00] glory amen is
[26:03] good so Paul said teach no other
[26:06] Doctrine no other instruction verse 14
[26:09] neither give heed to fables and endless
[26:12] genealogies which minister so look you
[26:14] got to look at the question if someone's
[26:16] asking you a question what's what does
[26:17] the answer produce does it produce more
[26:20] questions or does it give you peace in
[26:22] your heart and and the
[26:25] question if the question leads to more
[26:27] questions it's of the devil I'm talking
[26:30] about attacking God's servant go or
[26:32] God's word or God's Doctrine in our case
[26:34] it's mostly attacking brother Brandon
[26:36] but see they stay away from the doctrine
[26:37] because we got a Bible we got a verse
[26:39] for every Doctrine amen I got one church
[26:42] amen I wrote 832 pages on brother's
[26:45] Doctrine I could have went way further I
[26:47] could have wrote 3,000
[26:49] Pages because it's the Bible hallelujah
[26:52] it's the Bible restored to us amen amen
[26:55] blessed are your eyes for they see
[26:57] blessed are your ears for they hear
[26:59] Hallelujah no man can deceive you
[27:01] because brother R point us back to the
[27:03] word of
[27:05] God so God doesn't want us to go to
[27:09] fables God doesn't want us to uh spend
[27:12] our time in Endless
[27:13] genealogies which minister questions
[27:16] rather than Godly edify which is in
[27:18] faith so do so questions that lead to
[27:22] edification edification means
[27:24] stewardship in that in that place so
[27:27] questions should make us better stewards
[27:30] I got a question about tithes and
[27:31] offering see the answer will make you a
[27:33] better Steward of your
[27:34] money right you'll be a better ownership
[27:37] or if you have a question about family
[27:38] or marriage or children that will make
[27:40] you a better Steward of your home Glory
[27:45] Hallelujah but if the question just
[27:47] leads to more questions and you start
[27:49] questioning the word of God is this
[27:50] Bible even inspired well most of the
[27:52] Bibles aren't inspired right because
[27:54] they got the false translations so many
[27:56] false translations did you see this week
[27:58] China's going to put out a new Bible it
[28:00] it's reported they cannot stop the
[28:02] church growing the more they tried to
[28:04] stop it the greater it's grown
[28:06] amen so they're coming out with the new
[28:08] Bible in a few years and they're going
[28:09] to mandate everybody to use it and they
[28:11] gave one example of how they're changing
[28:12] it when Jesus was brought the woman
[28:14] called adultery they changed it and said
[28:16] Jesus said uh let he that's without sin
[28:19] cast the first stone and those Devils
[28:21] changed it to say Jesus picked up the
[28:23] stone and stoned her that's what those
[28:25] demons are doing they're trying to
[28:27] change the Bible I got but I got news
[28:30] for you God protects his
[28:32] word I got news for you the elect cannot
[28:36] be deceived Hallelujah people will die
[28:38] for that Bible people will write out
[28:40] that Bible they might have to go back to
[28:41] the oldfashioned days hallelujah of
[28:43] writing on Scrolls whether they take
[28:45] their phones or take their tablets one
[28:46] thing you can't take you can't take the
[28:48] word of God that's been written on the
[28:50] fleshly tables of their heart
[28:52] hallelujah look at Satan's always trying
[28:54] to do he's always trying to attack the
[28:56] word of God hallelujah am teach some
[28:59] other Doctrine that's demonic power but
[29:03] we got the power of the Holy Spirit
[29:04] hallelujah amen
[29:07] amen see be careful these people that
[29:09] just want more questions about brother
[29:11] more questions more questions more
[29:12] questions it's never going to end that's
[29:13] what the devil says the devil will never
[29:15] let it
[29:17] end and I he take them back to the
[29:18] quotes they don't like brother BR said
[29:20] I'm a sinner saved by grace I have no
[29:22] merits of my own to get to heaven I'm
[29:23] not going to go to heaven because I'm
[29:25] Pentecostal I'm going to go to heaven
[29:26] because of Jesus Christ's merits
[29:29] how about that one amen how about we're
[29:31] not saved by works we're Saved By Faith
[29:33] through grace alone Hallelujah and the
[29:35] church book brother it's not Jesus Plus
[29:38] for salvation it's Jesus alone for
[29:41] salvation
[29:42] hallelujah we're saved by the work of
[29:44] Jesus Christ not by our works but by the
[29:47] grace of almighty
[29:49] God
[29:52] glory ah they rarely they rarely comment
[29:55] after that they I rarely get a reply on
[29:56] all these
[29:58] verse five now the end of the
[29:59] Commandment is what here's here's where
[30:01] we're going church the end of the
[30:02] Commandment is Charity out of a pure
[30:04] heart God wants you to love in Purity
[30:07] amen and you know if your life isn't
[30:09] pure you know if your life isn't pure
[30:11] you know if there's something you got to
[30:12] take care of something dirty in your
[30:13] life something not cleaned out you
[30:15] know the whole the end game the whole
[30:18] goal of Christianity is you can love
[30:20] people with Purity amen am no agendas no
[30:23] G uh right Nathaniel had no gu Jesus
[30:26] said there's a man with no gu he's don't
[30:29] pretend
[30:30] Hallelujah and of good conscience and of
[30:33] Faith unfeigned or faith
[30:35] unpretending faith in Jesus
[30:39] Christ verse six from which some have
[30:43] swerved have turned aside unto vain
[30:45] jangling vain means usess and uh
[30:48] jangling means Babble or random talk
[30:51] they just uselessly do random talks
[30:54] useless it doesn't get you any closer to
[30:56] God it doesn't edify you it doesn't make
[30:58] you better Steward it just creates more
[30:59] questions about the Servants of God it
[31:02] just creates more questions about the
[31:03] word of God that's a devil
[31:06] Hallelujah Paul told Timothy don't give
[31:08] your time to those things but make sure
[31:11] you edify the people amen answer their
[31:13] questions with the Bible and it should
[31:15] edify them it should make them more pure
[31:18] it should make them love God with Purity
[31:19] in their hearts
[31:22] Hallelujah is this helping
[31:24] anybody see there's people out there
[31:26] they do endless podcasts or endless
[31:29] videos and that's all endless rabbit
[31:32] Trails of false assumptions and fake
[31:34] false
[31:36] accusations this is uh vain babbling
[31:40] personified Hallelujah and and a lot of
[31:43] these people some of them will even
[31:44] allow tattoos they'll they'll allow uh
[31:47] non-binary relationships cussing
[31:50] swearing rock and roll rrap they'll
[31:52] allow all these things they can't even
[31:54] recognize an evil spirit that's because
[31:56] they're anointed by an evil spirit
[31:58] hallelujah amen and all they give their
[32:01] time to is more vain babblings the Bible
[32:04] said don't give any time to
[32:06] it verse seven Desiring to be teachers
[32:09] of the law now these in this context it
[32:11] was Jud Judaism uh false uh legalistic
[32:14] Jews understanding neither what they say
[32:16] nor whereof they
[32:19] affirm hallelujah amen so these people
[32:22] they're not even preachers and they
[32:23] desire to teach you instead of a
[32:25] vindictive prophet of God and the
[32:28] fivefold ministry that Jesus Christ said
[32:30] would bring us into a Unity of the faith
[32:32] and bring us to a perfect man a mature
[32:35] Christian Hallelujah that's what I love
[32:37] about the message the messenger brother
[32:39] R has made me a true Christian a pure
[32:41] Christian hallelujah praise God amen
[32:44] hallelujah it's brought me to a Unity of
[32:46] the Faith with my brothers and sisters
[32:48] praise God it sh me the true revelation
[32:50] of God's word hallelujah how can I not
[32:52] enjoy this Doctrine it is life the Bible
[32:55] says if you abide in the doctrine you
[32:56] have both the father and son I'm so glad
[32:59] I got the father I'm so glad I got the
[33:01] son I'm so glad I got the Holy Ghost
[33:03] these three are one
[33:05] Hallelujah not three
[33:07] Hallelujah God never said I'm three
[33:09] persons Hallelujah Jesus is the
[33:11] expressed image of the person of God
[33:13] Hebrews 1:3 Hallelujah and remember
[33:16] those trinitarians they didn't even say
[33:17] the Holy Ghost was a person until 385 a
[33:20] 3 I'm sorry 381
[33:22] ad why did it take them uh 350 years to
[33:26] know the Holy Ghost was Divine why
[33:29] because they didn't have the Holy Ghost
[33:30] that's why amen but if you got the Holy
[33:32] Ghost you know the Holy Ghost is God
[33:34] Amen and the church said amen hallelujah
[33:37] they didn't know for 350 years praise
[33:40] God oh my you know a lot of give a lot
[33:43] of people give TD Jak a hard time and
[33:45] they should but there's one thing that
[33:47] he's right on I don't I believe he's a
[33:48] false prophet or false preacher whatever
[33:50] but he's one thing he's right on he said
[33:52] he believes God's not three persons good
[33:55] for him now bad for all the other things
[33:57] with the you've heard about maybe some
[33:58] of the news about him really bad stuff
[34:01] I'll give him credit for that one thing
[34:03] he stood against what trinitarians have
[34:04] said he said I'm not a trinitarian he
[34:06] said I'm Pauline in other words I get my
[34:10] definition of the godhead from St Paul
[34:12] and that's really a m drop
[34:15] moment right now of course he lives in
[34:18] prob he probably lives in sin and does
[34:19] awful things but I'm just saying that's
[34:21] one that's one person that that has one
[34:23] good thing
[34:25] hallelujah our our our faith isn't built
[34:28] upon the Creeds of man our faith is
[34:30] written upon the word of God that the
[34:32] Holy Ghost inspired holy men to write
[34:34] hallelujah amen and the holy word never
[34:37] calls God three persons or second person
[34:39] oh uh Paul never said oh thank you
[34:41] second person for dying for my sins Paul
[34:43] never said that he said oh thank you
[34:46] first person for uh creating heavens and
[34:48] earth or thank you third person uh for
[34:50] coming into my soul Paul never said that
[34:52] Hallelujah and John said if you got the
[34:55] right doctrine that proves you got both
[34:56] father and son he never even mentioned
[34:58] the Holy Ghost that's because God is the
[35:01] Holy Ghost the father is the Holy Ghost

[35:22] your time is very
[35:24] precious is that true yes

[35:29] endless questions endless genealogy
[35:32] fables like that one the Fable that uh
[35:35] brother Rand is somehow responsible for
[35:37] Jim Jones just because Jim Jones at one
[35:38] time was a a Pentecostal that's an
[35:41] absolute Fable from hell I I did videos
[35:44] on it proven it beyond a shadow of a
[35:46] doubt that's a fable I don't give my
[35:48] time to fables now I did the one time to
[35:49] show how it was wrong and anybody that
[35:52] wants to be free from that Fable they
[35:53] can be free from that Fable amen and God
[35:55] can turn them to the truth of God's word
[35:57] hallelujah amen I think it was I'm not
[35:59] mistaken nine times in that sermon
[36:01] brother Austin the Holy Spirit told
[36:02] Brother Ram or the Holy Spirit had
[36:03] brother Ram speak to the
[36:05] pastors and warned the people and the
[36:07] pastors and Jim Jones is sitting right
[36:09] there remember he's responsible for over
[36:11] 900
[36:14] deaths nine times brother called out you
[36:16] Pastors make sure you don't give this he
[36:18] was talking about a bobbed hair makeup
[36:19] and all these things and Jim Jones
[36:21] allowed that and then by the end he
[36:22] didn't even he said he was
[36:24] God he said he was God and he said
[36:27] prophesied of brother Ram's death that's
[36:29] a lie too there's nothing on tape
[36:30] there's nothing foretold about that
[36:32] either see fables we think a a

[37:56] Doctrine Hallelujah
[37:58] it's God's instruction on how to get
[38:00] saved hallelujah oh that makes me happy
[38:01] Hallelujah to know that God has given us
[38:03] the right Doctrine the one Doctrine no
[38:06] other Doctrine it's the doctrine of the
[38:08] Apostles it's what Paul preached and

[38:32] trusting me with it I got to be faithful
[38:34] with
[38:35] it avoiding profane and Vain babblings
[38:39] and oppositions of science falsely

[38:43] science out there
[38:45] hallelujah oh there's no such thing as
[38:47] God or Evolution and all this
[38:50] nonsense show me one uh creature that's
[38:53] in the process of evolving right now in
[38:56] fact brother Ram did say one time he
[38:58] made a joke hopefully I can remember
[38:59] this I don't chop it up too much brother
[39:00] talking about all these women taking off
[39:01] their clothes and brother said now they
[39:04] say we're coming from monkeys he said I
[39:06] don't believe that but it sure looks
[39:07] like these women undressing it looks
[39:09] like they they're going back to monkeys
[39:11] he
[39:12] said I can find that quote if you want I
[39:14] thought that was good brother Bram I
[39:15] think I actually said amen when I heard
[39:17] him say that I started
[39:18] laughing he said you're kind of
[39:20] convincing me you didn't come from
[39:21] monkeys cuz you're taking off your
[39:23] clothes cuz monkeys don't wear clothes
[39:24] Hallelujah
[39:27] glory amen thank you brother ROM
[39:30] hallelujah thank you for preaching God's
[39:33] word
[39:36] Glory see it's avoid profane babblings
[39:41] useless random talk no focus on Doctrine
[39:44] no focus on the word of
[39:47] God and babbling is fruitless
[39:49] discussions there's no really fruit to
[39:51] it what how does someone get closer to
[39:52] God this way
[39:58] and look at verse 21 which some
[40:00] professing have ered concerning the
[40:02] faith see they're professing
[40:03] Christianity but they're they're giving
[40:04] all these false science right I heard a
[40:06] preacher a famous preacher his name is
[40:07] Andy Stanley boy he's going off the
[40:09] rails this guy's really falling away
[40:10] from God excepting homosexuality all
[40:12] these things but he said Evolution
[40:14] doesn't contradict the word of God I'm
[40:17] sorry you need to go see Answers in
[40:19] Genesis and get some real Answers by
[40:20] God's grace
[40:23] Hallelujah totally contradicts the word
[40:25] of
[40:26] God but see avoid it avoid it I thought
[40:29] Paul didn't you say we're supposed to
[40:30] approve all things yes we are when
[40:32] they're sincere
[40:33] questions when someone really wants to
[40:36] know amen and they want to be a better
[40:39] Steward of a Christian Life am not when
[40:43] they just want to debate until they can
[40:45] uh make you feel like you're wrong no
[40:49] the word of God Is
[40:51] Right Hallelujah Church you know you can
[40:54] sense it can't you how many got the
[40:55] discernment of the Holy Ghost you can
[40:57] just sense when people really have good
[40:58] questions we had a brother who was with
[41:00] us for a while then left us and when I
[41:02] was talking to him and texting with him
[41:03] I could tell he was he was going that
[41:05] way there there was never going to be an
[41:06] end to these questions there was never
[41:09] going to be an end of well maybe you're
[41:10] wrong on tithes and offerings maybe
[41:12] you're wrong on the godhead maybe you're
[41:13] wrong on this maybe wrong on that
[41:14] there's never going to be an end see
[41:16] what does that that make that makes him
[41:17] the pastor then that makes him my leader
[41:20] then I got to submit to him and do what
[41:21] he says no sir I'm led by the Holy
[41:23] Spirit I was called by the Holy Spirit I
[41:25] was commissioned by the Holy Spirit and
[41:27] I'm under the leadership of the Holy
[41:28] Spirit praise God Amen Ah that's the
[41:32] third passage avoid profane vain
[41:35] babblings see it's a Heir when they go
[41:37] into all these unending questions and
[41:38] all these fables about brother random or
[41:40] even the Bible they're aing from the
[41:43] faith go to 2 Timothy
[41:46] 2:15 this is the fourth
[41:49] passage and hopefully I can hopefully
[41:51] the Hol not me hopefully the Holy Spirit
[41:53] can convince you it's very important how
[41:54] you spend your time
[41:57] it's very important how you accept or
[41:59] decline
[42:00] questions
[42:04] Hallelujah study to show thyself
[42:06] approved unto God he's talking to a p or
[42:07] I'm sorry preacher I I don't think maybe
[42:09] Timothy was a pastor I have to go look
[42:10] that up because he he tell he tells him
[42:12] later do the work of evangelist I don't
[42:13] think he's a pastor yet I don't think
[42:15] Timothy was the pastor yet because he's
[42:17] telling him to do
[42:18] evangelism a Workman that needeth not to
[42:20] be ashamed rightly dividing the word of
[42:22] Truth see you got to you got to cut the
[42:24] word that that right divide means a cut
[42:26] you got to cut straight you got to cut
[42:28] this truth straight you can't can't do a
[42:30] jagged cut it's got to be straight
[42:33] people got to understand they got to
[42:34] know what's right and wrong Hallelujah
[42:36] you got to cut it right you can't let
[42:38] cut a little piece and say well it's
[42:39] okay to be a homosexual it's okay to be
[42:41] an adulter oh you can no you can't you
[42:43] better cut it straight Hallelujah talk
[42:45] about straight
[42:46] amen
[42:48] hallelujah you better cut it straight
[42:52] Hallelujah I didn't a plan to say that
[42:54] verse 16 but shallan not here now he
[42:57] before he said prove all things now he
[42:59] said shun
[43:00] them shun them shun profane and vain
[43:04] babblings when they start doing profane
[43:07] attacks against God's word or God's
[43:08] people shun
[43:11] them for they will increase under more
[43:13] ungodliness this is what I brought up I
[43:14] brought up many times I listed all those
[43:16] sins and I'm just saying sins of certain
[43:18] people that leave the message not all
[43:20] that leave the message but some they'll
[43:23] cut their hair they'll well makeup
[43:24] they'll wear pants they'll wear shorts
[43:25] they'll watch filthy movies uh they get
[43:27] into the lgbq lifestyle they they
[43:29] approve of rock and roll rap and and
[43:31] Halloween and Dracula and dirty movies I
[43:34] see their lives are either getting more
[43:36] holy or more or less holy Our Lives
[43:38] ought to be getting more holy Hallelujah
[43:40] am God said be holy church for I'm holy
[43:44] Hallelujah live a sacred separated life
[43:48] live a holy life because God is separate
[43:50] from sin
[43:52] Hallelujah that's how I know these
[43:54] people asking questions if their lives
[43:56] get more
[43:57] worldly now some of them I'm not going
[43:59] to name their names but some of them all
[44:01] they do is attack brother Braham they
[44:02] don't say exactly what they
[44:04] believe and there's a reason they do
[44:06] that because if they actually said what
[44:08] they believed I'd call them out on
[44:11] it I would because I already do
[44:15] Hallelujah I called out others see they
[44:18] don't tell you what they believe they
[44:20] just attack brother Brandon they just
[44:22] attack the
[44:23] Bible but God knows church God knows
[44:27] God knows who's hungry and thirsting
[44:29] after
[44:30] righteousness they shall be
[44:34] filled and what happens in verse 17
[44:36] their word eats as a
[44:38] canker that's a flesh eating disease see
[44:40] it slowly rots away their life that's
[44:42] why that Lev sermon is very similar just
[44:44] slowly rots away the leaven slowly
[44:46] permeates the hole and they say in verse
[44:49] 18 oh the raptures already happened you
[44:51] know I got a good sermon coming up on
[44:52] the Rapture did you know tuck Tucker
[44:54] Carlson just attacked the scoffield
[44:56] Bible did you know know
[44:57] that I just heard it today brother
[44:59] Austin so I got my Scofield bible right
[45:02] here brother
[45:03] Tucker maybe he'll see this online and
[45:05] he'll want to talk to me maybe I could
[45:08] be a a interview person on his
[45:11] show here's my new guest he's a no-name
[45:14] pastor from
[45:17] Ohio attacking the scoffield Bible I
[45:20] thought bro I bro I was
[45:24] like I about ready to throw down there
[45:30] that's all I've had is a Scofield bible
[45:32] and church you know what they're
[45:33] attacking that's ties into this they're
[45:35] attacking the pre-tribulation
[45:38] Rapture and I've been attacked so much
[45:40] on that recently brother
[45:41] Austin so you know see see see what God
[45:44] is doing whenever Satan when when the
[45:46] enemy whenever the enemy comes in like a
[45:48] flood God will raise up a standard come
[45:50] R around here I'm going to prove it by
[45:52] the Bible God's Prophet said it was
[45:55] pre-tribulation the B says it's
[45:57] pre-tribulation Hallelujah so now I know
[46:00] why I got to go preach and it also lines
[46:01] up with those sermons and that song I
[46:03] Just Want to Thank You Lord um uh it
[46:07] this the coming of the lord The Rapture
[46:08] mystery that's my next one after the the
[46:11] spirit of Grace I know it's right on
[46:12] time God is always right on time how
[46:15] many you believe
[46:16] that
[46:18] Amen brother
[46:23] Tucker I love verse 19 nevertheless the
[46:26] foundation of God stand ass sure having
[46:28] this seal the Lord knoweth them that are
[46:30] his God knows his
[46:31] children I love this let everyone that
[46:34] nameth the name of Christ depart from
[46:35] iniquity see a lot of these people won't
[46:36] they won't say what they believe that
[46:38] after they the message because they know
[46:39] they're getting into more iniquity and
[46:40] they know they'll be called out right so
[46:43] they won't say it now some of them will
[46:44] some of just get on there like I told
[46:45] you they'll name off every single thing
[46:46] they do all the things they want to do
[46:48] it's sad but it's fulfilling the
[46:51] scripture and they're the ones spending
[46:53] their time on profane and Vain babblings
[46:56] and they increase unto more godliness
[46:58] may we see in our lives that our lives
[47:00] are getting more holy praise God not
[47:03] less holy May Our Lives get more holy
[47:05] praise God what do you need to cut out
[47:07] of your life what can you sacrifice out
[47:10] of your life that will draw you closer
[47:12] to
[47:15] Christ that's a good question isn't it
[47:18] oh no wonder the pastor preaches on
[47:19] sanctification all the
[47:21] time see because you're either
[47:23] increasing one way or the other church
[47:25] right but said you can't leave this
[47:27] service the same way you came right you
[47:30] either be more determined to to hear the
[47:32] word obey the word pray or less
[47:34] determined your
[47:36] choice God help us to make the right
[47:39] choice 2 Timothy Chapter 4:

[47:44] final passage amazing this was amazing

[48:59] need time to come into the fullness of
[49:01] our maturity as Christians and give all
[49:04] Doctrine to the
[49:06] people that's all I preach you know we
[49:09] like we had a with two 4our services and
[49:11] all I preach was
[49:14] Doctrine I hardly gave any testimonies I
[49:16] mean I gave some but I preached Doctrine
[49:18] I instructed them on how to live above
[49:20] sin I instructed them on how to have
[49:22] treasure in their homes I focused a lot
[49:24] on overcoming pornography
[49:28] and all said was instruct them on this
[49:30] and this and that and it produced all
[49:32] this all this response they're all
[49:34] available on YouTube if you want to
[49:35] watch it by God's
[49:37] grace see doctr will produce a Revival
[49:41] in fact that's the only thing that will
[49:42] produce Revival it's repentance
[49:46] Hallelujah for the time will come when
[49:48] they will not endure sound Doctrine
[49:49] people won't hear the Lord Jesus Christ
[49:51] baptism they won't they won't even hear
[49:53] three works of Grace but said that's my
[49:56] message the the three works of Grace
[49:58] justification sanctification the baptism
[50:00] of the Holy Ghost that's my
[50:03] message but after their own lust look a
[50:05] lust again here's the fifth time Paul's
[50:08] saying lust these people that have all
[50:09] these endless questions they have lust
[50:11] of the flesh they shall Heap to
[50:13] themselves teachers having itching
[50:16] ears they're saying just tell me what I
[50:19] want to hear itch my ears make me feel
[50:21] good when I come to church it is not my
[50:23] job to make you feel
[50:24] good sometimes I will but sometimes I
[50:28] won't amen amen I'm not here to tickle
[50:31] your
[50:31] ears I want to preach the promises of
[50:34] God and that ought to make it joyful
[50:37] Hallelujah sometimes you got to lay down
[50:39] truth lay down things that might hurt
[50:41] but it's not me it's the word of God
[50:42] it's God uh bringing a cut that he might
[50:45] after he cuts with the sword he might
[50:47] bring in the balm for healing praise God
[50:50] the oil of healing God Cuts you so that
[50:53] he can heal you by God's grace cut out
[50:56] PR out areas of your life this shouldn't
[50:58] be in your life and yes it hurts but
[51:00] then God puts the oil of the holy spirit
[51:02] for
[51:05] healing verse four and they shall turn
[51:08] their ears away from the truth see they
[51:10] don't want to hear the message they want
[51:11] they don't want to hear the truth and
[51:13] should be turned unto fables like I said
[51:15] fables that God Saves everybody whether
[51:17] you're Hindu or Catholic or no matter
[51:19] what you are God Saves people by Grace
[51:21] Hallelujah through the blood of Jesus
[51:23] Christ brother R said a Catholic is
[51:24] saved if he's trusting in the blood of
[51:26] Jesus Christen not the prayer
[51:29] beads
[51:31] Hallelujah if you're trusting in the
[51:33] prayer beads you're lost if you're
[51:34] trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ
[51:35] you're saved hallelujah
[51:39] amen but watch thou in all things you
[51:42] have to watch all your
[51:43] life endure afflictions do the work of
[51:46] evangelist make full proof of your
[51:48] ministry I'm constantly trying to prove
[51:50] I've got a a Ministry with sound
[51:52] Doctrine that's my whole job is to prove
[51:54] I'm giving all of you the trth true
[51:56] doctrine of our Lord and savior the Lord
[51:59] Jesus Christ amen
[52:03] hallelujah but what do we have today we
[52:05] have accusers of the Brethren like uh uh
[52:07] Revelation 12 says the Bible said the
[52:10] accuser of the Brethren is cast down
[52:12] right speaking of Satan and people
[52:14] Anointed with evil spirits they accuse
[52:16] the Brethren the true Christians they
[52:17] accuse them online or face to face or
[52:19] over letters or email somehow some
[52:22] people do it not everybody but some
[52:24] people do it
[52:27] see and it's just like the Pharisees and
[52:29] the herodians mark 12:13 and they sent
[52:32] unto him certain of the Pharisees and
[52:33] the herodians to catch him in his words
[52:37] see that that's what these evil spirited
[52:38] people they're trying to catch the True
