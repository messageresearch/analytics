[0:00] got that song from right that was john
[0:01] wesley john wesley
[0:03] he said live so on fire for god that the
[0:06] world will see the smoking come watch me
[0:08] burn
[0:09] remember they kicked him out of the
[0:10] churches but so he had to go out into
[0:12] the fields and preach the tens of
[0:14] thousands they never thought they could
[0:15] do it
[0:16] but god would anoint their voice to be
[0:17] louder so people could hear
[0:19] oh i've been touched by a fire let them
[0:22] come watch me burn for jesus
[0:24] hallelujah praise god god bless
[0:26] everybody we just like to
[0:28] take about maybe 10 minutes and just
[0:29] show a little slideshow of
[0:31] of uh some of our pictures over the
[0:35] years you know we've
[0:36] had this wonderful fellowship here for
[0:38] about 15 years
[0:39] give me just a second here i got to find
[0:41] the file
[0:42] and i just added you know i showed a
[0:44] little i showed most of it on friday but
[0:46] i knew i had to start friday because
[0:49] i'm a procrastinator sometimes and so i
[0:52] had to start a friday i had to tell
[0:53] everybody i'm going to show up friday
[0:54] right
[0:55] uh and then that got me started on it
[0:59] and that way i could finish it like last
[1:01] night okay
[1:02] so praise the lord so 15 years we're
[1:05] thankful for god's amazing grace
[1:08] i won't be as long as i was friday okay
[1:10] on friday i really took a lot of time
[1:11] and
[1:12] i kind of shared about each picture
[1:14] we'll just probably laugh smile
[1:16] cry you know we'll probably look at some
[1:17] of those pictures and uh just thank the
[1:19] lord for
[1:20] all god's done for us so i i i
[1:23] actually i actually made this in 2016
[1:26] but i never showed it because i just i
[1:28] procrastinated
[1:30] and i never finished it sorry for having
[1:32] mic or audio trouble here
[1:35] so it's something to do with my mic
[1:37] sorry
[1:38] this wireless mic it probably gets
[1:40] abused as i'm preaching i'm probably
[1:42] like
[1:43] swinging and punching and preaching and
[1:45] i probably abuse it so forgive me
[1:47] uh but anyways i procrastinated i never
[1:49] showed it in 2016 so i thought well here
[1:51] we are
[1:51] five years later perhaps i could finally
[1:54] show it so
[1:55] i started working on it hour at a time
[1:57] so november 22nd
[1:59] 2002 that's me with my long hair there
[2:01] simon had just heard the message
[2:03] uh in september september october
[2:06] november so three months later he said
[2:08] jesse you got to listen this sermon
[2:10] called
[2:10] serpent seed you gotta listen to two
[2:12] seeds and that's what started it so that
[2:14] night that was thanksgiving night
[2:16] that night we drove back to akron he
[2:18] played two seeds for me
[2:19] and i believe the message from that
[2:21] moment on i had struggles i had doubts
[2:23] but that was the moment my heart changed
[2:25] i said wow i've never heard preaching
[2:27] like this
[2:28] the preaching that we preach today by
[2:29] god's grace so thank god for brother
[2:31] simon
[2:31] so long ago as before cam was married
[2:34] you know
[2:35] i was right betsy and dustin had just
[2:36] got married no i'm sorry they hadn't
[2:38] been married no they had that was
[2:40] a year later so two years later we
[2:43] started having that was the very first
[2:45] saturday night house service it was just
[2:46] an outreach it wasn't official church
[2:48] yet
[2:48] brother brooks told tim myers to start
[2:50] having churches see if people get saved
[2:53] so those are the first few people i
[2:55] witnessed to her in a class and one her
[2:56] to the lord sister carrie
[2:58] she's now in florida as a messenger
[2:59] believer
[3:01] tim myers witnessed the sister lisa and
[3:03] they're now message believers in
[3:04] michigan
[3:05] by god's grace and so uh everybody
[3:08] played a part right to win souls how
[3:10] many want to win more souls for god
[3:11] i just said lord send me to send me the
[3:13] soul so i can witness to him like
[3:14] yesterday
[3:16] that catholic man we talked to but he
[3:17] wasn't interested i tried to share you
[3:19] know
[3:19] we have a higher message than the chapel
[3:21] we have a higher message in the catholic
[3:23] church but he wasn't interested
[3:24] so much in that tim myers now he's left
[3:27] the message now but he did believe the
[3:29] message eyewitness to him
[3:30] um and i show him about the water
[3:33] baptism
[3:34] he started out really on fire for the
[3:35] message but just last year he fell away
[3:37] from the message he doesn't believe it
[3:38] anymore
[3:39] like his father-in-law tim humes they
[3:40] don't believe it anymore but i still
[3:42] want to give credit because he had a lot
[3:43] of courage to start these services and
[3:45] he'll always be my brother
[3:47] praise god we we always disagree you
[3:49] know about brother branham i believe
[3:50] he's a true prophet but
[3:52] but tim doesn't anymore that's okay um
[3:54] i'm praying for him
[3:56] and so we would always we it was just so
[3:58] we were new christians on fire for the
[4:00] message we just love to dance and
[4:01] and this is a video we just love to
[4:03] dance and sing so instead of going to
[4:05] the
[4:05] movies and the world and the parties you
[4:08] know we would just
[4:09] come together and sing and praise god we
[4:11] would just sing all night and just
[4:13] praise the lord it was just so wonderful
[4:14] to us
[4:15] we had some baptisms there's devon now
[4:17] divine was the one that witnessed the
[4:18] brother bang
[4:19] and invited brother vang to the bible
[4:21] studies that's when kerry got baptized
[4:23] now these
[4:24] friends they're wonderful but they fell
[4:25] away as far as following the message but
[4:27] they did believe water baptism in the
[4:29] name of the lord jesus christ there's
[4:30] brother brooks
[4:31] my first pastor in the message and
[4:33] brother john now in michigan brother
[4:34] brooks now in
[4:35] iowa he sent a text to me this morning
[4:38] asking the lord to bless our services
[4:40] praise god
[4:41] there's brother simon faithful
[4:43] evangelist there's brother randy
[4:45] brother craig taught me all the word
[4:46] we'll get to that a little bit there's
[4:48] brother tim
[4:49] so this was on a saturday while i was
[4:51] off playing football in 2003
[4:53] they were having house services so
[4:55] that's kind of how this move got started
[4:57] here
[4:57] now a couple years later we felt led to
[4:59] start a church tim had moved down to
[5:01] north carolina
[5:02] brother brooks thought he'd be the
[5:03] pastor but he moved down there and so
[5:05] everybody voted me and
[5:06] i got uh seven votes to be the pastor
[5:08] seven out of seven
[5:10] and so i've been the pastor this whole
[5:12] time so we're thankful for god's grace
[5:13] our first services
[5:15] were in our houses we had wednesday
[5:16] nights that's my house
[5:18] in calgary falls but then sundays we'd
[5:20] have them at john's house because john's
[5:22] house was a little bit bigger
[5:23] so we'd have so we drive 30 minutes
[5:25] south to canton for services on sunday
[5:26] wednesday night have them at my
[5:28] house in calgary falls just real small
[5:31] uh living room we just had services
[5:34] there just we just squeezed as many
[5:35] chairs as we could
[5:37] uh there's brother vang there's brother
[5:39] banger
[5:40] he's giving himself bunny ears there
[5:41] that's why i told you i said i told him
[5:42] yesterday i said we got some good
[5:43] pictures of you brother man
[5:46] we you know we baptized these guys i met
[5:48] this guy on the job baptized him
[5:49] he and his wife they hung around for a
[5:51] few months but then he said i don't want
[5:53] this he went back to video games back to
[5:54] sports
[5:55] uh kind of fell away but when we met him
[5:58] he just ate up the message for a while
[5:59] but you know
[6:00] the devil likes to come in and steal
[6:01] that seed but you know we just keep
[6:04] moving on as you know preston onward
[6:06] the bible jesus said you throw a net out
[6:08] and you bring it in
[6:10] right and some of it's good some of it's
[6:12] good salmon praise god
[6:14] but then some of it's wiggle tails and
[6:16] spiders and slugs and they kind of all
[6:17] crawl back and
[6:18] we're not name calling but we realize
[6:20] all that the father has given me will
[6:22] come to me
[6:23] so all the real saints stay with the
[6:25] word of god that's just a picture of us

[6:31] night that was at barberton lake and i

[9:49] james is a he was the pastor at
[9:50] sheffield for many years he started a
[9:52] church in sheffield they're still going
[9:53] strong
[9:54] he passed away a number of years ago but
[9:57] before we started this church i went to
[9:58] james and i said
[9:59] brother we might start a church what do
[10:01] you what what should you
[10:02] what should i know about being a church
[10:04] and he said some of the wisest words he
[10:06] said
[10:06] he said remember you are the church
[10:09] don't count on anybody else
[10:10] you're the church because they rented
[10:12] out a ymca for like 20 years until god
[10:15] gave them
[10:15] that beautiful church where they have
[10:17] now that church that used to be there
[10:18] one to sell it real cheap they got a
[10:20] beautiful deal on it
[10:21] they got the grand piano and everything
[10:22] it was it was just the hand of god
[10:25] and uh and then i asked him brother i
[10:27] said you're an older preacher what would
[10:28] you tell me he said
[10:29] he said take care of your body he said i
[10:31] didn't take care of my body for all
[10:32] those years i've got all this heart
[10:33] trouble
[10:34] that's what he died of he died of heart
[10:35] trouble he said take care of your body
[10:37] he said if i would have took care of my
[10:39] body now and ate the right food
[10:40] he said i could be out on the missionary
[10:42] fields right now and he told me that a
[10:44] few years before he dies that's why i
[10:45] exercise
[10:46] that's why i try to take care of my body
[10:48] i lift some weights just light weights
[10:49] you know but
[10:50] i run and i do tae kwon dokes i want to
[10:52] take care of my body so if the lord

[11:00] praise god hallelujah i hope
[11:03] everybody has that same desire take care
[11:04] of your temple it's not your body
[11:06] it's the temple the holy ghost praise
[11:08] god the first place we rented was on mo
[11:10] drive
[11:11] just a few miles from where jose used to
[11:13] live
[11:14] and he didn't even know about this
[11:15] church we didn't we didn't even know it
[11:16] but we were just
[11:17] a couple miles away from brother jose's
[11:19] house
[11:20] uh first rental here
[11:24] let's go to some pictures there's a
[11:26] thanksgiving service brother bang was
[11:27] giving his testimony
[11:29] carrying a lady we're giving a song
[11:31] special that thanks
[11:32] it was a thanksgiving morning i think we
[11:34] had a service that was another church
[11:36] picture now this was when i was when
[11:37] brother cam felt led that i was brother
[11:39] cam's pastor i was brother simon's
[11:41] pastor
[11:41] they drove three hours every sunday to
[11:43] come to our church for about a year and
[11:44] a half
[11:45] then i felt that i said brother cam you
[11:47] need to be a pastor you guys need to
[11:48] start a church over there
[11:50] because their whole church was was
[11:51] driving over to see us three hours
[11:53] every week i was like well you i said
[11:55] that's a good thing but you can't keep
[11:56] that up forever
[11:58] so i said bro let's start a church over
[11:59] there and so we prayed and fasted and
[12:01] everybody voted for cam to be the pastor
[12:03] praise god and he's
[12:04] stood there faithfully since 2009.
[12:06] that's
[12:07] 12 years 12 years he stood like a rock
[12:10] our precious brother there
[12:11] so thank you so uh marge was sister
[12:14] kathy's mom's that sister kathy
[12:16] for a certain reason you know we had a
[12:17] little disagreement she doesn't come to
[12:19] the church now
[12:20] but uh she used to come very faithfully
[12:22] uh but her uh she
[12:24] she urged her mom to be baptized right
[12:26] before she died and that's for the man
[12:27] we carried her down there to baptize her
[12:29] praise god
[12:30] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[12:32] there's just some you know screenshots
[12:34] or shots of worshiping there at that
[12:35] first rental
[12:38] sister wendy giving us something special
[12:39] now she wasn't coming our church yet but
[12:41] she was just visiting there
[12:43] sister lady and all the saints there but
[12:45] tim visited us
[12:48] he's the one that started the whole the
[12:49] meetings right back in 2003
[12:52] we had him up preach for us 2009 we
[12:55] moved in a different place this was
[12:56] bigger but
[12:57] not as nice it was a very run-down room
[13:02] now that's insulation on top because the
[13:04] sanctuary used to be a wine cellar and
[13:06] we believe the spiritual wine was poured
[13:07] out there by god's grace many times
[13:10] we thank the lord for that that's the
[13:11] view from the pulpit just a little
[13:13] storage room there
[13:14] sunday school the floor was unfinished
[13:17] we just never felt led to finish it
[13:18] once cam and simon moved back we didn't
[13:20] have enough ties to keep that place
[13:22] anymore
[13:22] so we moved into a little smaller
[13:24] location in 2010.
[13:26] we just jammed in this real tiny space
[13:29] there's a sunday school class up there
[13:31] my dad helped build the walls of that
[13:33] first
[13:34] i'm sorry that second third rental
[13:36] location sorry third rental location so
[13:38] i
[13:39] my wife teaching sunday school uh
[13:42] there's lydia
[13:43] lydia has a sunbeam for jesus there
[13:45] she's got a mask on for jesus there's
[13:48] brother bang bo and zur
[13:49] uh cam and uh julia when they visited
[13:52] preaching
[13:52] i got a closer picture brother cam he
[13:54] was already pastored
[13:57] same same group there a little bit
[13:59] better picture
[14:01] brother matt we witnessed to him and
[14:03] there's a little testimony behind that
[14:04] but he's out minnesota now
[14:06] sunday school or some sunday school
[14:08] students there
[14:09] singing and praising the lord
[14:13] and i'm sorry i'm going to go back it
[14:14] was at that i'm just going to share this
[14:15] man okay
[14:16] it was at that church malachi had a
[14:17] dream he was in the sanctuary sitting
[14:19] he moved up to the piano then he moved
[14:21] up to the pulpit
[14:23] so so far we've seen him fulfill sitting
[14:25] in church and moving up to the piano
[14:27] i don't know if that means he's going to
[14:28] song lead or preach so we'll see
[14:31] no pressure
[14:34] i can't stop you can nobody can stop
[14:35] what god is ordained
[14:38] but we've seen him now who would have
[14:39] thought this the fact that our children
[14:41] have music gifts makes no sense because
[14:43] our family doesn't have any music gifs
[14:45] kristen she sings but i'm talking about
[14:47] instruments
[14:48] so the fact that you know we've had you
[14:50] know julia ask us how do your children
[14:52] do those song specials you guys train
[14:53] them up i'm not
[14:54] we're like not really they just kind of
[14:56] all work by the lydia's leading and
[14:57] malachi and
[14:58] kesha the gifts the gifts of the holy
[15:00] ghost in their own lives
[15:01] it's not like we're like watching every
[15:03] moment we just kind of sit back and
[15:04] watch and
[15:05] the holy ghost is guiding them so god
[15:08] has a plan for every life praise god
[15:11] 2013 we met brother jose he's not here
[15:13] today but i took a picture the first
[15:15] time he came
[15:16] he he went he was raised in a church
[15:18] that believed brother branham had to
[15:19] come back before the rapture
[15:22] and travel around the world but he came
[15:23] to our church and god delivered him out
[15:25] of that return ministry
[15:26] and now he's only looking for jesus
[15:28] christ to return so it's a great
[15:30] testimony for brother jose
[15:31] and 2013 brother loris sister karen cain
[15:34] now they've
[15:35] laura since has left the message karen i
[15:38] believe still believes um
[15:40] but we just need to pray for her
[15:43] and then we met brother adam out of the
[15:45] marine corps right god called god say
[15:47] brother adam in the message
[15:48] out of the marine corps through sister
[15:50] beau uh meeting on on a chat line
[15:52] or a chat group online and as a marine
[15:56] he just heard the word and believed it
[15:58] right away
[15:59] so we're thankful for him he was a
[16:01] deacon for us we're thankful for that
[16:03] there's right then before they got
[16:04] married

[16:07] 2014 we met for the amen by god's grace
[16:10] i love his shirt
[16:11] there must be something real and he was
[16:13] raised in the nomination but when we
[16:14] come this message
[16:15] he found something real praise god so
[16:18] very thankful for that
[16:19] and then see you again praise god very
[16:21] thankful that was a very
[16:23] a wonderful day i still remember that
[16:24] day i got to see all the family and the
[16:26] saints there
[16:27] just a little longer after that a little
[16:29] later after that for the jose and
[16:30] brother
[16:31] amen there there so that little church
[16:34] there before we moved
[16:36] i remember i remember sister sia came
[16:38] and she was really sincere
[16:39] praying i just i loved that picture she
[16:41] was seeking god you know she crossed the
[16:43] ocean
[16:44] to be married to this man and bring
[16:45] forth uh children to the lord i thought
[16:48] what a great
[16:48] testimony there she is on the altar of
[16:50] god praying and of course we had brother
[16:52] we had the brother brother steve sister
[16:55] wendy sister bo
[16:56] praying there after service i just i
[16:58] felt led to take a picture that time i
[17:00] just
[17:00] i really enjoyed people seeking god
[17:02] their sister sia she has always loved
[17:04] our babies
[17:06] one time she took one of my children and
[17:07] she was kind of joking she walked like
[17:09] she was going to take my child home in
[17:10] her van
[17:11] and so i'm waiting when james will let
[17:13] me hold him i'm going to do that same
[17:14] thing
[17:15] i'm saying hey james you're calling home
[17:16] with me buddy
[17:19] she's such a wonderful sister in the
[17:20] lord thanks god and then to 2015 we
[17:23] moved over here
[17:24] uh we had uh sonny brady andy rayburn
[17:27] supporting us you know with
[17:28] the ties we ran out of room in that tiny
[17:30] little hole in the wall where we're
[17:31] having church
[17:32] and so we come out here karen sister
[17:34] karen found this place
[17:36] it was 50 off per square feet
[17:39] and the landlord has kept us at that
[17:41] rate now we have the inflation rate
[17:42] every year goes up a little bit
[17:44] but just finding this place was a
[17:45] tremendous blessing
[17:47] and so it was all messed up you know
[17:49] we've uh
[17:50] loris came and painted for us i remember
[17:52] that karen painted the bathrooms
[17:54] maokai's painting the uh the pastor's
[17:56] office lydia paying the pastor's office
[17:59] uh casey was painting the nursery there
[18:02] everybody doing their little part we
[18:04] took out all the children rolled up the
[18:06] uh the old carpet it was all dirty and
[18:09] soaked
[18:10] and then we dedicated the church where
[18:12] the brooks came to dedicate the church
[18:14] there by the grace of the lord
[18:15] we've had wonderful services since then
[18:17] praise god wonderful times in the lord
[18:20] uh then virtue came on the scene there's
[18:22] nature and virtue came on the scene
[18:24] there
[18:24] that's the baby virtue right there so
[18:27] for some reason i don't have one of baby
[18:29] eden so forgive me i just
[18:31] oh yeah when i was going through all my
[18:32] pictures this week
[18:34] about half of them wouldn't show up on
[18:35] my computer so i don't know
[18:37] i probably have way more but this is the
[18:39] best i could find for some reason they
[18:40] weren't showing up uh sunday school
[18:42] there with the bradys and the raber
[18:44] children
[18:44] uh we're showing how we we brother bam
[18:47] says we hang over hell
[18:48] on every chain of god's promise that
[18:51] means that chain will not be broken that
[18:53] chain will hold praise god
[18:54] our anchor will hold so we taught the
[18:56] children that that and these are all the
[18:57] all the scriptures brother man taught us
[18:59] from the bible they're all chained
[19:00] together to give us a strong chain
[19:02] praise god
[19:03] and that chain will hold us praise god
[19:05] then we had our 13th anniversary i had
[19:07] brother brooks he was my first pastor he
[19:09] baptized me
[19:10] he married my wife and i in the wedding
[19:12] ceremony he
[19:13] dedicated lydia i got filled with the
[19:15] holy ghost under his ministry
[19:17] he ordained me to be a pastor ordered me
[19:18] to be a preacher he's like a father
[19:20] figure and brother craig he was the
[19:21] bible study he just taught me everything
[19:23] i knew right in the scripture he showed
[19:24] me everything right in the scripture
[19:27] uh 2016. wendy's there now yeah and
[19:30] wendy their sister dede from albion
[19:32] casey was starting to get into her gifts

[19:40] austin got baptized in 2016. still
[19:43] praying for him to come back that's
[19:45] brother austin there
[19:46] so praying for him to come back he said
[19:47] he wants to he's on probation out in
[19:49] arizona
[19:50] so we'll just keep praying for him by
[19:51] the grace god brother adam visited
[19:53] that's a great testimony because acacia
[19:54] started praying for him and after a
[19:56] couple years he got delivered from all
[19:58] of his drugs
[20:00] and so we were just planning for him to
[20:01] come out and give his testimony then
[20:03] covet struck and we just haven't been in
[20:04] touch since then but i still want to get
[20:06] him out here
[20:07] cam and simon have prayed for him and
[20:08] the demons have physically left him
[20:11] they physically left him they heard the
[20:12] screaming and everything
[20:14] um so that's my cousin we're the same
[20:16] age we both graduated
[20:17] 1999 same age
[20:21] well that's just a funny one in my wife
[20:22] i just put that in there she was doing
[20:24] the roller blades one day socks
[20:26] i just was joking around with her with
[20:28] that one that's when lydia was baptized
[20:30] because i can't roller blade i'm a
[20:31] little
[20:31] a little scared on rollerblades for some
[20:33] reason i don't i skate i don't roll the
[20:35] blades i just joking with my wife
[20:36] that was when lydia was baptized praise
[20:38] god that's a beautiful testimony
[20:40] uh i'm not gonna play all that okay she
[20:41] was baptized on the same day
[20:44] some beautiful testimonies there that
[20:46] was uh eden's dedication right yeah yeah
[20:49] cause there's virtue
[20:50] so i found some videos uh but i'm not
[20:53] gonna play the whole thing but that was
[20:54] when
[20:55] eden was dedicated over in the other
[20:56] sanctuary there by god's grace
[21:02] uh we 2017 we first visited
[21:04] jeffersonville
[21:05] that's just brother jose and i went
[21:07] alone the first time
[21:08] and that was the time he wanted to be
[21:10] re-baptized because he was baptized the
[21:12] right way but in the return ministry
[21:15] right with the wrong idea and so on that
[21:18] trip i went we went down to the
[21:20] ohio river and i baptized him right
[21:22] there where the holy ghost come down
[21:23] as a pillar of fire i baptized him right
[21:25] there in the name of the lord
[21:27] i was he just wanted to rededicate his
[21:28] heart to the lord that was just a
[21:29] beautiful time
[21:30] there's the uh shim's candy
[21:34] brother ram like those hot red hots red
[21:36] hats
[21:38] and shortly after that we baptize haven
[21:39] a beautiful testimony there to the lord
[21:42] and esther we baptize esther there by
[21:44] god's grace
[21:45] always i just found this one a jose
[21:47] singing song special i appreciate it
[21:49] ministers mother benjamin justin would
[21:51] visit every now and then he got married
[21:52] as a child
[21:53] now the cam's faithful ministry uh
[21:55] benjamin came numerous times and
[21:57] just still praying for him to come back
[21:59] to the lord adam visited a couple years
[22:01] later with his wife
[22:02] and they were so kind they took us out
[22:04] to eat they gave us like two hundred
[22:05] dollars in gift cards you know and
[22:07] uh god had delivered him and there's a
[22:09] case she's one she writes she wrote him
[22:11] all the letters so keisha has a big part
[22:12] in that testimony just always writing
[22:14] him letters and
[22:15] urging him to get victory and he finally
[22:17] did by the grace of the lord
[22:18] now i shared this one because the this
[22:20] was the last time i seen tim myers
[22:21] before he left the message that's the
[22:22] same guy who started our services
[22:25] but that's when i preached for his
[22:26] father-in-law on december 31st 2017
[22:30] his dad said it was one of the greatest
[22:32] sermons or greatest services they've
[22:34] ever had at their
[22:34] entire church i preach on the waters of
[22:37] separation how you got to get past
[22:39] the outer court holiest of holies and
[22:41] get into the baptism of the holy ghost
[22:43] the whole church malachi might remember
[22:44] that he might remember the whole church
[22:46] was at the altar weeping and screaming
[22:48] and crying
[22:48] for mercy and deliverance it was just a
[22:50] tremendous time but then two three years
[22:52] three years later they left the message
[22:54] so it's just it's striking how the enemy
[22:56] can get in there
[22:58] but we're standing on the truth and we
[22:59] still love them we'll still pray for
[23:01] them
[23:01] 2018 one of our founding members john
[23:03] left there's brother vang and
[23:05] sia but amen different ones saying
[23:07] goodbye put that one up there because
[23:08] there's sister karen i didn't have
[23:09] the only picture i could find of our
[23:11] suppression sister there
[23:12] uh brother jose saying goodbye
[23:16] there's oh yeah there's brenda that's
[23:17] one picture i had a brent i just you
[23:18] know i need to take more pictures
[23:20] everybody remind me after service we
[23:21] need to take some more pictures
[23:23] so we can remember then uh that year
[23:25] brother william got to go
[23:27] uh to jeffersonville we had a wonderful
[23:29] time with brother aaron now of course
[23:30] he's kind of went to the joseph's side
[23:32] now we still love brother aaron
[23:33] steven's brother pray for him but for
[23:36] that time he was
[23:37] he was my biggest amen corner for about
[23:40] a year and a half you all remember his
[23:41] loud voice right
[23:42] so just pray for him and i don't know he
[23:44] went from he was in joseph
[23:45] came to us and went back to joseph so i
[23:47] don't know what happened but we love him
[23:49] and our prayers are powerful
[23:51] so let's just pray for him by god's
[23:52] grace so brother william got to get some
[23:54] red hots
[23:55] did you eat all those brother
[23:59] i i ate a bunch too by god's grace
[24:03] and there we are at the branham
[24:04] tabernacle there's a cornerstone
[24:08] yep eagle but we met the pulpit there
[24:14] no church not to me i don't worship
[24:15] brother branham i don't worship
[24:16] jeffersonville but i like to go
[24:18] where god first vindicated this message
[24:22] because that's kind of like where i can
[24:24] go there and say wow
[24:25] i'm preaching i'm the fruits of what he
[24:28] preached
[24:29] right because the bible says the word of
[24:32] god comes to the prophet and then
[24:33] the prophet teaches others and from out
[24:36] of there comes the word of the lord
[24:38] and i'm just what genera i'm just two
[24:40] generations after
[24:41] god's prophet that he said there or
[24:42] maybe one generation whatever you're
[24:44] going to say
[24:45] but i'm very thankful to preach this
[24:47] message that's why it means so much to
[24:48] me
[24:49] i only worship jesus christ but i like
[24:51] to go and say wow this is where jesus
[24:52] christ worked
[24:54] this is where he brought the revelation
[24:57] there we are voice of god again uh
[25:00] that's right before william left the
[25:01] last time but now he's back two years
[25:02] later
[25:03] so we're very thankful for that by god's
[25:05] grace there's a good picture wendy took
[25:07] this i think i was i must have been out
[25:09] preaching somewhere because i'm not in
[25:10] any of these pictures
[25:11] we had sister connie i had the joy of
[25:12] having her for a couple years but she
[25:14] ended up she
[25:15] she moved up here because she believed
[25:18] our teaching about the squeeze because
[25:20] we believe in the squeeze we don't know
[25:21] what
[25:21] what it will be but the churches some of
[25:24] the churches in florida where she was
[25:25] going
[25:26] they believed they were already in the
[25:28] squeeze and she's like this ain't the
[25:30] squeeze
[25:31] it's not the squeeze there's really no
[25:34] pressure right
[25:35] like like the squeeze is talked about so
[25:37] she moved up here she left everything
[25:39] but then she got sick and uh she started
[25:42] missing her grandchildren so then she
[25:44] moved back so
[25:45] uh but we certainly love sister connie
[25:47] but there's a nice little picture
[25:49] uh right it was right after genevieve
[25:51] was born
[25:52] is their sister randy getting in on the
[25:54] selfie there
[25:57] great picture there remember we had the
[25:59] flooding remember we had the flooding
[26:00] and we went over to the ymca for a month
[26:02] or two
[26:03] that's when brother amen and brother
[26:04] maokai kind of started coming together
[26:06] that's actually when loris left
[26:08] and god brought you guys together to be
[26:10] this team and
[26:11] add lydia and we'll see who else the
[26:13] lord adds by god's grace
[26:15] uh so we met there remember her sister
[26:17] what was her name
[26:18] sister tanya she got healed we prayed
[26:20] for god
[26:21] she couldn't move her arm god healed her
[26:24] arm later that night at home
[26:25] we took the keys to the kingdom and god
[26:27] healed her but then the drive became too
[26:28] much
[26:29] i said sister i said you got to let your
[26:30] hair grow and she says i know
[26:32] i just can't do it and i said well what
[26:35] can you do you know people don't want to
[26:36] obey the word of god what can you do
[26:38] just just love them right
[26:39] but anyways her her thing was was too
[26:41] far she lived in new philadelphia which
[26:43] was an hour and a half
[26:45] and uh just uh unable to come so she
[26:48] said so then we baptized carrots
[26:50] in the name of the lord dedicated
[26:52] genevieve my mother-in-law got to come
[26:54] that's what i appreciate about my
[26:55] mother-in-law although she's been
[26:56] married three times
[26:57] we're praying for mercy we prayed for
[26:58] her on friday night right we sighed and
[27:00] cried
[27:01] for her soul on friday night and the
[27:03] fact that she'll come in here she'll
[27:04] wear a dress right she even wear a dress
[27:06] and come hear me preach
[27:08] just trusting god to bring her to
[27:09] repentance but we sure appreciate her
[27:11] help and naomi sent me these look how
[27:13] sweet eden was
[27:14] eden was kissing genevieve there i
[27:15] thought that's a good ill that's a good
[27:18] uh symbolism of our church right
[27:19] everybody loves everybody at our church
[27:22] right no matter how old how young no
[27:25] matter skin color we love everybody here
[27:26] because we're all christians praise god
[27:28] i just thought that's a beautiful
[27:30] picture there then we had sister connie
[27:32] again for a
[27:33] thanksgiving meal a couple years ago
[27:37] and she was just real shy she wouldn't
[27:38] even she would never look at the camera
[27:39] every time i tried to take a picture of
[27:40] her she would never look at the camera
[27:42] that's how my dad is dude he don't look
[27:44] at the camera neither does my mom 2019
[27:48] but adam came back
[27:49] that was really great another great
[27:50] reunion with him
[27:53] brother keith randolph yep and then
[27:55] there's brother stephen i had to get a
[27:56] steven picture there like i was great
[27:57] so we got to get a picture brother we
[27:58] got to get sick
[28:01] oh yeah there's lily there's something

[28:04] brother's picture except lily and jen
[28:06] kind of snuck in there
[28:07] that's okay we like having them in there
[28:10] uh then just we were practicing at our
[28:12] house i think we had a music practice
[28:13] that night just get some
[28:14] oh yeah good testimony here but now this
[28:17] brother
[28:18] came to the message in 2016 through
[28:21] through adam adam demoline my cousin
[28:24] he was shot by a cop on purpose and won
[28:27] the court
[28:28] ruling the cop targeted him on purpose
[28:30] paralyzed him for life
[28:32] he was filled with bitterness simon
[28:34] brought the message to him
[28:36] and the king james bible and he went and
[28:38] instantly
[28:39] got rid of the lawsuit and on national
[28:43] tv
[28:44] he said i've been taught true repentance
[28:46] through the king james bible
[28:47] and this police officer deserves
[28:49] forgiveness just like anybody else
[28:52] and he said all because of the king
[28:54] james version bible
[28:55] and this message that god has sent us
[28:57] praise god and just so you know
[28:59] on friday night he was giving his
[29:00] testimony to my brother sam
[29:03] and his brother-in-law the very hour
[29:06] we were crying out their names in prayer
[29:09] i don't know i don't remember on friday
[29:10] night i was praying for sam sam jr
[29:13] and he just texted me that yesterday he
[29:14] and i were texting last night and he
[29:16] said brother i got to he said i got to
[29:18] look your brother sam right in the eye
[29:19] and tell him
[29:20] in front of all these hundreds of men
[29:21] giving his testimony on friday night
[29:23] i said brother what time was that he
[29:24] said 7 30 that was the very
[29:26] hour we started praying we prayed for 45
[29:29] minutes on friday night
[29:30] and i said that was such an
[29:32] encouragement so church let's just keep
[29:33] praying
[29:34] let's see if god will save some more
[29:36] souls by the grace of god
[29:37] but i put him in my book under the
[29:39] parable the new book coming out
[29:41] under the parable of the unmerciful
[29:43] servant where jesus forgives ten
[29:45] thousand
[29:46] but others won't forgive i put his name
[29:48] in there as one of the most powerful
[29:50] testimonies of forgiveness for giving a
[29:54] police officer who purposely shot him
[29:55] and i have that i have the whole
[29:57] testimony on youtube if you want to
[29:58] watch it

[35:00] hand
[35:00] of my righteousness let's have a word of
[35:02] prayer let's just bow our heads for a
[35:03] moment let's ask the lord to minister to
[35:05] us just for a few moments here
[35:07] heavenly father we're in your divine
[35:08] presence we're rejoicing in your
[35:11] power to keep us lord god lord jesus you
[35:13] pray in the garden keep those
[35:15] through thine own name that thou hast
[35:18] given me and lord you were praying for
[35:19] your disciples
[35:21] and so lord just as jesus prayed for his
[35:23] disciples lord
[35:24] we're praying for one another we're the
[35:26] disciples today jesus is our head today
[35:28] so lord jesus
[35:30] we just ask god keep us through thy name
[35:32] keep us through the name of the lord
[35:34] jesus christ the power
[35:36] and authority of the lord jesus christ
[35:38] give us 15 more years and beyond should
[35:40] you tarry
[35:41] 15 more years of service dear god to be
[35:43] faithful to preach the word to believe
[35:45] the whole word of god and not compromise
[35:47] dear god
[35:48] we just ask the lord for a special
[35:49] anointing and blessing upon your people
[35:52] lord we've we've given extra sacrifices
[35:54] this weekend lord to draw closer to you
[35:56] i know you'll receive them dear god and
[35:58] just receive our sacrifices today father
[36:01] that you might be glorified
[36:02] that our hearts might be happy by
[36:04] keeping all your word
[36:06] granted lord god give us the vision of
[36:07] god that we need
[36:09] in jesus christ's name and the saint
[36:11] said amen god bless you as being seated
[36:13] praise god
[36:16] i'll set the timer now so i'll try to
[36:18] get 45 minutes here
[36:20] by the grace of god
[36:24] okay so i do have a few slides i want to
[36:26] show so i do apologize about that i
[36:27] unplugged it but then
[36:28] um i do want to show a few slides
[36:32] i just want to look at this thought
[36:33] today um where there
[36:35] is a vision the people prosper
[36:39] because the scripture we read was a
[36:41] negative right where there's no vision
[36:43] people perish well then the opposite
[36:45] must be true right
[36:46] where there is the vision the people
[36:48] will prosper
[36:50] and so i just want to preach just a
[36:51] short little message on vision i was
[36:53] kind of meditating on it all week i
[36:55] heard a little podcast about vision and
[36:57] then i remember some quotes from brother
[36:58] branham
[36:59] uh and so i just had this little thought
[37:02] here
[37:02] about vision so we read our scripture
[37:04] here without a vision
[37:06] people perish so that means with the
[37:09] vision the people keep the word
[37:11] and they're happy in other words the joy
[37:13] of the lord
[37:15] how many how many experience the joy of
[37:16] the lord where you are just you're just
[37:19] joyful to be a christian you're just
[37:21] joyful because god is in your life
[37:24] praise god because we all know what it's
[37:25] like when god was not in our life
[37:27] but if god is in our life then we should
[37:29] have the joy of the lord the joy of
[37:31] salvation praise god
[37:33] and so we experience that on a daily
[37:36] basis
[37:37] now i brought out this scripture to show
[37:38] how prospering
[37:41] was the result of obeying prophecy
[37:45] in other words the scripture the
[37:46] scripture that foretells what's to come
[37:49] if we obey the prophecy then god will
[37:51] prosper our souls
[37:53] we all know third john 3 john says
[37:57] i would that you prosper in health even
[37:59] as your soul prospers
[38:01] so god does want your health to prosper
[38:03] right unless you're like paul
[38:05] and god's trying to humble you because
[38:07] of all the revelations right
[38:09] so in most cases god is going to heal
[38:10] you unless he's trying to keep you
[38:12] humble or take you home
[38:14] right but most of time god's going to
[38:16] heal you he's going to give you good
[38:18] health
[38:18] so you can serve him and that's so your
[38:21] soul can prosper
[38:23] and your soul is the location of the the
[38:26] free more agency
[38:27] and the nature of god your mind is
[38:30] different your mind is your conscience
[38:32] your thoughts and your plans and your
[38:33] ideas and your
[38:34] conscious memories and affection
[38:36] imagination but that's your mind
[38:38] but god wants to prosper your soul which
[38:40] is your nature
[38:41] your character amen hallelujah
[38:44] what the spirit that's leading you and
[38:46] guiding you it's guiding all those
[38:48] thoughts can i say like this
[38:49] it's correcting all those thoughts
[38:52] praise god it's giving you the right
[38:53] things to imagine
[38:55] right it's giving you the right reasons
[38:57] to uh to state for believing something
[39:00] right
[39:00] so the soul influences the mind praise
[39:03] god
[39:04] and john said i want your soul to
[39:06] prosper
[39:07] because if your soul prospers your mind
[39:09] will prosper
[39:10] and your body will prosper praise god
[39:13] because it all starts in the soul the
[39:14] soul of man right
[39:15] the soul of man all starts there because
[39:17] the soul that sinneth it shall die
[39:19] but jesus said i come to give you rest
[39:21] to your souls
[39:23] amen instead of fighting with god
[39:25] wrestling with god
[39:26] wrestling with self we are our souls
[39:29] rest in god
[39:30] our souls rest in the blood of jesus
[39:33] christ amen
[39:34] our souls rest in the finished work of
[39:36] calvary praise god
[39:38] and the subsequent sending or the
[39:40] sending afterwards of the holy ghost
[39:42] praise god
[39:44] and so we rest in god's life within us
[39:46] praise god
[39:48] so this was when they were trying to
[39:49] rebuild the wall in jerusalem
[39:51] after the babylonian captivity ended
[39:54] after jeremiah's 70 years were up
[39:57] and the bible said the elders of the
[39:59] jews built it and they
[40:00] prospered through the prophesying of
[40:03] haggai the prophet
[40:05] and zechariah the son of idol and they
[40:09] it and finish the house i'm sorry this
[40:11] was the house this wasn't the walls yet
[40:13] this was the house praise god because
[40:14] this was zerubbabel so forgive me
[40:17] uh nehemiah was the hot i'm sorry
[40:18] nehemiah was the walls this was the
[40:20] house forgive me
[40:22] uh but now i want you to notice too
[40:25] everybody knows
[40:26] even false prophets know that when
[40:30] when there's a real prophet the people
[40:32] prosper
[40:33] these were the lying prophets all the
[40:35] line prophets in the days of
[40:37] of ahab all the prophets prophesied
[40:39] saying go up to ramos gilead
[40:41] ahab and prosper for the lord shall
[40:43] deliver into the king's hand
[40:45] see now that was a lying spirit but i'm
[40:48] just showing you
[40:49] people want to prosper right
[40:52] the bible said we will prosper the bible
[40:54] said we prosper
[40:55] through prophesying so satan tries to
[40:57] imitate that
[40:58] and he tries to get people to compromise
[41:00] on the word and still tell them
[41:02] you're gonna you're gonna prosper well
[41:04] ahab was not gonna prosper because he
[41:05] has
[41:06] he had a jezebel wife a literal jezebel
[41:08] wife
[41:09] right and we're battling a jezebel
[41:11] church praise god
[41:12] we're battling the protestants and and
[41:14] the catholics although we love them but
[41:16] there's a spirit behind them
[41:18] just remember church just a few of them
[41:20] are going to be saved
[41:22] just a few catholics just a few
[41:25] protestants very few
[41:26] because jesus said few there be that
[41:28] find the narrow road
[41:31] so that's when we're talking about
[41:33] denominations of catholic and fighting
[41:34] them
[41:35] we're not talking about every person but
[41:36] we're talking about the system
[41:38] the antichrist system behind that
[41:40] because the holy spirit said come out of
[41:42] methodists amen
[41:44] come on of luther and praise god come
[41:46] out of the pentecostal denomination
[41:48] and come into the revelation of this
[41:50] hour praise god
[41:52] come into the open book of daniel
[41:54] chapter 12.
[41:55] coming to the open book of revelation
[41:57] chapter 10 praise god
[41:59] the seals are loose praise god the
[42:01] revelations are revealed to us
[42:03] amen with thus saith the lord we have
[42:06] them praise god
[42:08] so see satan tries to imitate it and say
[42:11] you're gonna prosper it's okay if women
[42:13] still preach
[42:13] it's okay sisters if you cut your hair
[42:15] brothers it's okay if you have two or
[42:17] three wives
[42:18] and you smoke and cuss and watch dirty
[42:20] movies that's a lie
[42:22] your soul won't prosper you might
[42:25] prosper from satan's wages
[42:27] but we're not into satan's wages praise
[42:29] god we're into wages of righteousness
[42:31] amen hallelujah
[42:33] we're looking for spiritual treasure lay
[42:36] up for yourselves treasure in heaven
[42:38] not on this earth praise god seek the
[42:40] things that are above amen see satan
[42:44] lies and he'll tell you you're going to
[42:45] prosper it's okay to break the word of
[42:47] god
[42:47] it's a lie we only prosper when we obey
[42:50] the word
[42:51] keep the word for we'll be happy if we
[42:53] do that
[42:55] i didn't i've been so happy since the
[42:58] lord saved me praise god i've been happy
[43:00] okay what did i do forgive me
[43:04] oh i'm sorry yeah it was a black slide
[43:06] yeah then i had my thoughts on there
[43:07] sorry
[43:08] but yeah i think i'll share this one
[43:09] here i just want to you know so i didn't
[43:11] finish all my thoughts because i kind of
[43:12] ran out of time but
[43:14] um we are all called to do and come up
[43:17] with a simple
[43:18] oh yeah i wanted to go through and find
[43:19] all the things we're supposed to do and
[43:21] just make a simple way
[43:22] to remember like heart you know love the
[43:25] lord god with all your heart soul mind
[43:26] and strength
[43:27] home keep your home clean seek first the
[43:29] kingdom of god and only be strong
[43:31] i didn't get to develop that thought but
[43:32] just let you know i want to come up with
[43:34] a simple way to remember
[43:36] like denominations will say like love
[43:37] god love jesus
[43:39] i'm sorry i love god and love your
[43:40] neighbor right that's like a simple way
[43:42] to remember the great
[43:43] commandments right the greatest
[43:44] commandment right but i want to come up
[43:47] with a message one praise god
[43:49] because we have a we have a greater
[43:50] calling than that praise god
[43:52] we want to love god we want to serve
[43:53] people but we also want to escape
[43:56] the wrath that's coming up on this earth
[43:57] praise god in other words we need the
[43:59] rapture in there praise god
[44:01] now and sister joyce she's one of the
[44:03] editors for my my books
[44:05] and and i told her the vision i had for
[44:07] the books i said i you know we don't we
[44:09] don't we don't i want to put all this
[44:10] information about modesty in one place
[44:12] and she said that's a very good vision
[44:14] you have brother and then on the second
[44:16] book i said i want to put all the
[44:17] mysteries in one place
[44:19] where i said it's going to be like
[44:20] another church age book
[44:23] and she said brother you're a man of
[44:24] vision now i'm not saying i have vision
[44:26] for everything but
[44:28] i do have vision for some outreach and
[44:30] so that made me think wow
[44:32] i had vision to share the message and so
[44:34] if that's the vision god gave me if
[44:36] people can see that i have a certain
[44:37] vision
[44:38] then i want to continue in that in order
[44:40] to get the bride ready for the rapture
[44:42] praise god
[44:43] and remember in none of these books and
[44:45] videos have i ever asked for one cent or
[44:47] one like
[44:48] i've never asked for one anything
[44:50] because i don't want it give it to your
[44:52] home church
[44:53] the main thing is make make a place give
[44:55] your whole body heart and soul to jesus
[44:57] amen
[44:59] and i always say god bless you in the
[45:02] name of the lord jesus christ you know
[45:03] may jesus christ be the desire of your
[45:05] heart it's never been to make money it's
[45:07] never been for views or numbers
[45:09] now it is it is encouraging to see how
[45:11] many people watch
[45:13] but our desire is to finish the mystery
[45:15] of god or i'm sorry finish the great
[45:16] commission
[45:17] by sharing the mystery of god that's
[45:18] finished
[45:20] okay now our vision came from the
[45:22] bible-based prophet william branham
[45:25] now as one now look at this the holy
[45:27] ghost took a picture with this man
[45:31] that's how much a man of god he was
[45:34] right
[45:35] when was last time the holy ghost took a
[45:36] picture with you
[45:38] as a as a pillar of fire over your head
[45:40] he's never done that to me
[45:42] this man was a man of god and as
[45:44] evidence this man
[45:46] was raised a paralyzed man raised up and
[45:49] spent the last years of his life telling
[45:52] every person
[45:53] he could that jesus christ is a healer
[45:56] a paralyzed man he was there he is he's
[45:58] writing his books as a young
[46:00] man he was in this wheelchair he was in
[46:02] this wheelchair on the bed for 60 years
[46:04] william upshaw
[46:05] he was united states senator
[46:08] and he come he was in a wheelchair he
[46:10] went to brother rams meetings
[46:12] and the holy ghost said stand up you're
[46:13] healed and a man that was in a
[46:15] wheelchair
[46:16] for 60 years rose up and walked
[46:19] and spent the last years of his life
[46:21] giving out witnessing tracks he gave
[46:23] that's a track you can
[46:24] you can download that he gave it out to
[46:26] joseph stalin

[46:38] ghost amen
[46:39] everybody knew about this praise god and
[46:42] god sent his prophet why because he has
[46:44] to bless
[46:44] us through prophecy praise god amen
[46:49] and then i met this sister this sister
[46:50] in 1955
[46:53] was told by brother branham with thus
[46:54] saith the lord you're gonna get you're
[46:55] gonna
[46:56] be healed from tuberculosis that's
[46:58] brother tim hume's mom
[47:00] now she's passed away now but brother
[47:02] man i said go away yourself
[47:03] a week now you'll be a palmore he said
[47:05] weigh yourself another week
[47:07] you'll gain weight she did she went on
[47:10] to get complete health had four more
[47:11] children
[47:14] and he said that's that's in the name of
[47:15] the lord now who can do that
[47:18] when was the last time you did that we
[47:20] did it we didn't that's a prophet praise
[47:22] god
[47:23] that's a prophet who had the gift of
[47:25] discernment the gift of healing and had
[47:27] authority over satan praise god amen
[47:30] hallelujah thank god and god visited
[47:32] this earth
[47:33] with a prophetic ministry so that's
[47:35] where our vision comes
[47:36] a prophet pointing us back here because
[47:38] because denominations point you to
[47:40] their school they point you to their
[47:42] textbook but church we've been pointed
[47:44] back to thus saith the lord amen
[47:47] everything we believe comes right out of
[47:48] the word of god amen
[47:50] and we have no argument we just believe
[47:52] all the word of god hallelujah
[47:54] that's what god's prophet did it
[47:56] revealed the meaning of this book praise
[47:58] god
[47:59] hallelujah and gave it with us saith the
[48:02] lord
[48:03] now we want to recognize where we are
[48:05] where are we in time
[48:08] and the reason i'm saying this is
[48:09] because almost every other church in
[48:11] america
[48:12] will say america is going to have a
[48:13] great revival and they're raw
[48:16] they're lying that's the spirit of the
[48:19] antichrist
[48:21] i'm not i'm not mincing words here most
[48:24] churches that say america is going to
[48:26] have a revival
[48:27] are speaking from the unholy spirit
[48:31] because they're not there's nothing in
[48:32] the bible about america having a revival
[48:34] i showed it to the last time
[48:36] mj was here america is in revelation 13.
[48:39] they don't get a revival america brings
[48:41] on the mark of the beast
[48:44] but there will be a little revival amen
[48:47] a little remnant praise god he said
[48:49] because you've kept the word of my
[48:50] patience
[48:51] i will keep you from the hour of
[48:53] temptation that comes upon the whole
[48:55] earth
[48:55] thank god we have patience in the word
[48:58] of god amen
[49:00] he's going to keep us from the mark of
[49:02] the beast laying down jesus promised it
[49:04] praise god
[49:06] but where are we and this is the thought
[49:08] that came to me this week where are we
[49:10] church we've been given four kind of
[49:13] timelines to know where we are did you
[49:16] ever put that together
[49:17] it just came to me this week it's very
[49:18] simple you've heard it before
[49:21] now there's three of them but we have a
[49:23] fourth because i forgot about the seven
[49:25] major visions
[49:26] okay so here we have three timelines to
[49:29] know exactly where we are
[49:31] we have the daniel 2 image which brother
[49:34] ram said is thus saith the lord
[49:37] that's the timeline right
[49:40] we have the prophetic seven feasts of
[49:43] israel
[49:45] that's prophetic that tells us the
[49:47] timeline of where we are
[49:49] right and then we have the seven church
[49:51] ages
[49:52] which tell us where we are as well
[49:55] also we have the seven major visions
[49:58] three of which i know brother ram said
[49:59] five but he never said thus say the lord
[50:01] three of which i believe are come to
[50:03] pass the fourth is soon to come to pass
[50:05] with those driverless cars that's what i
[50:08] believe and i have coached the back
[50:09] there's two quotes brother ram said
[50:10] the this in the process of coming to
[50:12] pass it's not coming to pass yet there's
[50:14] other times he says it's come to pass
[50:16] so we have to ask the holy spirit what
[50:18] is the revelation that's the revelation
[50:20] i felt god has given to me the best i
[50:21] can understand because brother
[50:23] says we don't even have the highways yet
[50:25] for the driverless cars and we don't
[50:26] even have the driverless cars yet
[50:29] so see we just gotta we just have to we
[50:31] have to be humble and just let the holy
[50:33] spirit rightly divide the word of truth
[50:34] to us
[50:36] right remember church the bible says the
[50:39] way of righteousness
[50:40] will be so simple that a fool won't air
[50:42] in it
[50:44] a fool only a fool could miss the
[50:47] rapture only a fool could miss the truth
[50:49] this is so simple we just got to be
[50:51] honest and not look at pressure from
[50:53] jeffersonville or
[50:54] pressure from the white house and just
[50:56] look to the holy spirit
[50:57] and he'll guide us into all truth amen
[51:00] any simpleton
[51:01] any person who's uneducated can have the
[51:04] baptism of the holy ghost
[51:05] and know what's coming praise god
[51:08] because the holy ghost will tell you
[51:10] things to come praise god
[51:12] amen that's why we got a bunch of people
[51:14] that are off the word i think the
[51:15] rapture's already taken place
[51:17] some of them think uh we're in the
[51:18] millennium already all this bunch of
[51:20] nonsense
[51:21] and they don't have enough spiritual
[51:22] ability to just open their eyes and has
[51:24] this come to pass
[51:25] church if god gave these prophecies god
[51:28] is going to back them up
[51:29] if there was no question about mussolini
[51:31] if there was no question about hitler
[51:33] if there's no question about stalin
[51:35] there will be no question about four or
[51:36] five six or
[51:37] seven amen i'm not sure where that came
[51:41] from praise god
[51:42] now where are we if you read daniel 2
[51:46] and daniel 7
[51:47] there's two dreams or i'm sorry there's
[51:50] a dream
[51:50] and a vision about the kingdoms that
[51:53] rule to the end time
[51:58] babylon babylon was the head of gold
[52:01] the chest and arms of silver were medes
[52:04] and persians
[52:06] uh the loins were ancient greek
[52:09] alexander the great
[52:10] the last the legs down to the feet were
[52:12] iron
[52:13] which represent the roman catholic
[52:15] church i'm sorry which
[52:18] ancient rome but then it changed into
[52:21] papal rome
[52:23] right constantine in 325 started
[52:26] beginning marrying the church and state
[52:28] and don't let anybody tell you he was a
[52:30] christian he was not
[52:32] he murdered a few years before he died
[52:34] after he was baptized and everything
[52:36] he murdered his own mom and oldest son
[52:39] while he was away partying
[52:41] history records that a murderer wouldn't
[52:43] i'm sorry christian would never do such
[52:45] thing
[52:46] it's such a wicked thing to do there's
[52:48] no way he was saved
[52:51] uh it's just impossible there's so much
[52:53] more history i can't get into it now but
[52:54] don't ever believe that and marrying the
[52:57] church and state was never a good thing
[53:00] politics and religion don't need to be
[53:02] mixed praise god right
[53:03] because politics will always get corrupt
[53:05] praise god
[53:06] god doesn't rule by politics god rules
[53:09] by the word
[53:09] amen hallelujah the word of god not
[53:13] man's opinions and votes and
[53:15] voting can be fine there's times but
[53:17] ultimately god's word
[53:18] rules all the people praise god
[53:22] people that can submit to the word of
[53:23] god
[53:25] so where are we church we are in the
[53:27] time of rome
[53:29] right rome's ruling not as ancient rome
[53:31] military
[53:32] but now by religion as rome has
[53:35] uh rome has what they call it diocese in
[53:38] every nation i forget
[53:39] diocese in every nation almost under
[53:41] heaven there's a couple of those
[53:42] muslim countries that don't let him in
[53:45] yeah yeah yeah
[53:46] uh but then it seems like the muslim
[53:48] started through the catholics you know
[53:50] it's just it's a strange thing now i'm
[53:53] just giving you a visual to show
[53:54] how long each one lasts look how big
[53:56] those legs are
[53:58] this roman spirit which the legs are the
[54:00] longest part of the body right
[54:02] so see ancient rome came in about 141
[54:05] bc and so rome has been ruling remember
[54:08] they broke in the east and west
[54:10] right right that's what the two legs
[54:12] represent east and western rome
[54:14] uh in the eur in european days uh dark
[54:16] ages
[54:18] now the feet were iron and clay
[54:21] it's really strange so we have babylon
[54:23] meads of persians grecian roman
[54:25] but the feet and no no no church don't
[54:27] forget that
[54:29] the feet are iron and clay iron is rome
[54:32] so what's clay
[54:33] and the bible said they'll mingle their
[54:35] seed together but they won't unite
[54:38] brother adam told us what it was it was
[54:41] protestants or the clay
[54:43] iron is a catholic he said they're
[54:45] they're proselyting against each other
[54:47] to try to get one another to try to
[54:49] marry in between each other
[54:50] to pull people over because it's the
[54:52] same spirit it's mother and daughter
[54:54] harlots amen
[54:56] right that's what we got today
[54:58] protestants now they're trying to unite
[55:00] which
[55:00] they're gonna they're not gonna always
[55:02] unite right they're not gonna fully
[55:03] unite
[55:04] but they're there together it's the same
[55:05] spirit remember jesus said i will
[55:08] destroy the mother harlot
[55:09] he said then i'll destroy the children
[55:11] of the mother harlot
[55:13] and i'll put them in a bed of death
[55:15] that's why most
[55:16] protestant churches are dead spiritually
[55:18] they don't want the word
[55:20] they want popularity they want
[55:21] membership they want buildings
[55:23] we want membership in heaven praise god
[55:26] we want the new building
[55:28] of the new jerusalem praise god that's
[55:30] the new church we want praise god amen
[55:33] let it come down from heaven and before
[55:35] that of course we'll get the uh
[55:36] millennial temple praise god in the
[55:38] millennium there's actually two churches
[55:40] we want praise god
[55:41] the millennial temple and the new
[55:43] jerusalem that descends like a bride out
[55:44] of heaven
[55:45] amen now see
[55:49] so this is the devil these are the
[55:52] devils that we're battling today
[55:54] that's where the mj i've been battling
[55:56] that since i became a christian that
[55:57] antichrist spirit that's trying to pull
[55:59] me and
[55:59] make us a denomination that's the
[56:02] antichrist spirit we're battling
[56:04] right to become like rome and it's all
[56:06] routine there's no holy ghost there it's
[56:08] and then just dead like a baptist or
[56:10] dead like a methodist or dead like a
[56:11] lutheran or dead like
[56:12] whatever we don't want to be dead
[56:14] christians we want to be living stones
[56:16] amen hallelujah alive to christ
[56:19] amen full of the holy ghost and power
[56:22] amen you see this is the demons we're
[56:26] battling
[56:27] so is rome going to rule to the end time
[56:29] yes sir
[56:31] when the pope came in 2015 barack obama
[56:34] economy your holiness
[56:36] holy father i saw it there's numerous
[56:39] people
[56:39] women that got down there and kisses his
[56:41] ring and everything like that
[56:43] it's worship of a man it's setting up
[56:45] for the antichrist
[56:47] because one one day that pope will be
[56:49] the antichrist
[56:50] either him or another man that office of
[56:53] the pope
[56:54] will be the antichrist because the woman
[56:56] rides the beast the roman catholic
[56:58] church
[56:58] controls the beast and who is the head
[57:00] of the roman gathered church
[57:02] the pope of rome
[57:07] so see church we're to overcome
[57:09] lukewarmness don't ever you feel
[57:10] yourself getting lukewarm you find
[57:11] yourself a prayer meeting
[57:13] or you find yourself someone to repent
[57:15] to if you if you sinned against somebody
[57:17] don't let yourself get lukewarm brother
[57:19] said always keep your enthusiasm
[57:21] always be strong and very courageous
[57:24] amen
[57:25] hallelujah don't let your we don't let
[57:27] your strength run out
[57:28] stay strong amen you have a fountain go
[57:31] to the fountain
[57:32] and draw strength from the fountain
[57:34] praise it's bubbling up praise god amen
[57:37] there's plenty of strength and power
[57:39] it's bubbling up just drink
[57:41] be thirsty and drink on the blessings of
[57:43] god god will inspire your soul
[57:49] see catholics and protestants unite with
[57:51] the us government to lay down the mark
[57:53] of the beast
[57:54] it has to come out of that beast out of
[57:56] the land which we saw was a lamb
[57:58] freedom of religion but turned into a
[58:00] dragon spake like a dragon
[58:03] which is the united states of america
[58:05] the roman catholic church now we got the
[58:06] second
[58:07] roman catholic president look what he's
[58:09] doing he's destroying see how
[58:11] it destroys it everywhere catholicism
[58:13] goes it destroys the nation
[58:16] see how inflation's going way up all the
[58:18] all your gas prices going up you see
[58:19] that your food prices
[58:20] your lumber price is going up see that
[58:22] that's what the roman catholic does they
[58:24] strip the people of all the money
[58:25] to make them beg and be dependent upon
[58:28] that system we don't want to be
[58:29] dependent upon man
[58:30] we want to trust in god amen see they
[58:33] want man worship they just want
[58:35] everybody to worship them and come to
[58:36] them for money
[58:37] and their unemployment checks in the
[58:39] mail uh it's a bunch of devils
[58:42] bunch of devils now also here's another
[58:44] timeline now this is another one i could
[58:45] have added too
[58:46] actually i could have five timelines so
[58:48] i kind of added this one last second
[58:51] we've had every two thousand years god
[58:53] does something great right
[58:55] there's a two thousand in the first two
[58:56] thousand years there's a flood
[58:59] the second two thousand years messiah
[59:01] came
[59:03] next two thousand years the son of man
[59:04] came praise god
[59:06] hallelujah and the rapture's coming so
[59:09] that's how another way we know
[59:11] something great's gonna everybody knows
[59:13] everybody has a feeling something's
[59:14] gotta happen in this world
[59:16] right it seems just like we're just like
[59:17] at a boiling point right it's going to
[59:18] keep boiling
[59:19] the longer we live the hotter it's going
[59:21] to get right the more it's going to boil
[59:24] there's some it's time it's time for
[59:26] something to happen praise god
[59:28] now we don't want to predict the day in
[59:29] the hour because jesus said no man knows
[59:31] it
[59:32] but we want to keep our lamps trimmed
[59:33] and clear we want to watch and pray as
[59:36] jesus said watch
[59:37] and pray just watch him just keep
[59:39] watching and praying you won't miss it
[59:41] if he just said watch and pray and if
[59:43] you do it you'll see it praise god
[59:46] how much how much simpler directions
[59:48] could you give someone just watch and
[59:50] pray for my coming
[59:52] just watch just every day just see if
[59:54] the lord would be would be coming today
[59:56] right
[59:57] and then just pray every day you won't
[59:59] miss it
[1:00:00] you're a part of christ you're a part of
[1:00:02] the word how could you miss it when
[1:00:04] jesus died to save you praise god
[1:00:07] how could you miss it when he sent his
[1:00:09] word to revive you
[1:00:11] to bring you life right to redeem you
[1:00:14] sanctify you fill you with the holy
[1:00:15] ghost
[1:00:16] empower you you won't miss it just watch
[1:00:18] and pray
[1:00:23] yeah so this first time nine tells us
[1:00:26] romanism is the enemy the denominational
[1:00:30] antichrist spirit is our enemy
[1:00:36] now this is blurry so i apologize i
[1:00:38] don't know why i didn't have a better
[1:00:40] image start here every march
[1:00:44] uh they have passover right every march
[1:00:45] jews have passover
[1:00:47] so they have passover unleavened bread
[1:00:49] first fruits three days in a row
[1:00:51] seven weeks later they have pentecost
[1:00:54] uh one sorry one two three four months
[1:00:58] later they have
[1:00:59] uh trumpets day of atonement tabernacles
[1:01:02] that's what they did every year
[1:01:03] but this is a prophetic calendar for us
[1:01:07] all right does everybody understand
[1:01:09] passover jesus died on the cross
[1:01:12] unleavened bread jesus took our leaven
[1:01:14] of sin he took it down to hell
[1:01:17] praise god and took the keys of death
[1:01:19] and hell
[1:01:20] first fruits he rose from the dead
[1:01:22] praise god
[1:01:23] he was waved god waved him before the
[1:01:25] people praise god
[1:01:27] seven weeks later the holy ghost found
[1:01:29] the day of pentecost praise god
[1:01:31] now the trumpets are the jews when god
[1:01:34] returns
[1:01:35] because trumpets gather israel for the
[1:01:37] day of atonement
[1:01:38] israel is blinded right now they don't
[1:01:40] know jesus is the messiah
[1:01:42] but the the two prophets will call them
[1:01:44] back to that
[1:01:45] but right now we're in this long summer
[1:01:47] season of harvest we're right here
[1:01:49] church
[1:01:50] we're right here it's almost time for
[1:01:53] god to go back to
[1:01:54] israel praise god you can see it they're
[1:01:57] called they're still calling is
[1:01:58] israelis back to the promised land
[1:02:00] people are still flying in from
[1:02:02] different nations coming there
[1:02:04] so we are in the feast of weeks now this
[1:02:06] is different we'll preach on this on
[1:02:07] wednesday
[1:02:08] march was barley harvest that was christ
[1:02:10] wheat was the gentile church ages
[1:02:12] and then jews are called the first
[1:02:14] fruits
[1:02:16] in revelation right so there's three
[1:02:18] harvests that took place every year
[1:02:21] the church we are right at the end we
[1:02:23] are gleaning here at the time of
[1:02:24] gleaning
[1:02:25] just finding a few souls here few souls
[1:02:27] there getting the last harvest in
[1:02:30] before jesus returns
[1:02:33] before he goes back to the jews so roman
[1:02:36] isn't the enemy what else do we learn we
[1:02:38] gotta glean
[1:02:38] we or souls in the great commission
[1:02:40] until the last trump
[1:02:43] right which is uh the body change the
[1:02:46] trump of god shall sound the dead in
[1:02:47] christ
[1:02:48] rise first and then uh death is
[1:02:50] swallowed up in life
[1:02:53] glory that's at the last trump that
[1:02:54] happens moment twinkling with an eye
[1:02:56] praise god
[1:02:57] so we've got work to do now the seven
[1:03:00] church ages
[1:03:02] the holy spirit gave this uh picture to
[1:03:04] brother branham
[1:03:06] these are the messengers uh to the
[1:03:08] church ages paul
[1:03:09] iranius martin columba luther wesley and
[1:03:12] we believe brother branham was the last
[1:03:13] church aged messenger because he had
[1:03:15] thus saith the lord
[1:03:16] and he pointed us back to the scripture
[1:03:18] brother brahm was restoring paul's
[1:03:19] teaching
[1:03:20] amen so let me just give a challenge
[1:03:22] here if i don't preach something paul
[1:03:23] preached you come let me know
[1:03:25] because i am endeavoring i am laboring i
[1:03:28] am giving my whole life
[1:03:29] to just preach what paul preached praise
[1:03:31] god and i will continue to do that
[1:03:34] that's my pledge to you
[1:03:35] that should be your pledge to me and if
[1:03:37] i ever don't preach when paul preached
[1:03:38] you come correct me praise god
[1:03:40] because we're all crying there's all
[1:03:42] these souls crying out behind
[1:03:44] the veil of time we're resting on paul's
[1:03:47] gospel
[1:03:47] we're resting on the revelation of jesus
[1:03:49] christ that's our hope that we've obeyed
[1:03:52] because all men
[1:03:53] seekers will be judged by jesus christ
[1:03:55] according to paul's gospel
[1:03:56] on that day
[1:04:00] so the light was great the beginning but
[1:04:01] then all these uh antichrist got in and
[1:04:04] this was the darkest time the dark ages
[1:04:06] where the roman catholic church
[1:04:07] controlled church and state
[1:04:09] everything uh but we had a little more
[1:04:11] light at the end time
[1:04:13] uh the the the day of ref reformers was
[1:04:15] a great time martin luther john wesley
[1:04:17] george whitefield
[1:04:19] mighty men of god there was more light
[1:04:20] they had an open door jesus said they
[1:04:22] had an open door in that age
[1:04:23] and here we are at the end time the last
[1:04:25] revival before the rapture praise god
[1:04:28] now i i just showed you this too brother
[1:04:30] ham called this an open door i just made
[1:04:31] this a few years ago
[1:04:33] so the church ages ephesus smyrna
[1:04:35] pergamos there to you brother ram said
[1:04:37] the philadelphia church age started the
[1:04:39] age of the open door
[1:04:40] he was opening the age of uh he was
[1:04:43] opening the door of the godhead
[1:04:44] and jesus's name and the word he's
[1:04:47] opening that back
[1:04:49] up saying come on in i am the door
[1:04:51] praise god
[1:04:52] right i'm opening up the revelation of
[1:04:54] who i am i am the alpha and the mega
[1:04:56] i am the resurrection the life praise
[1:04:58] god i am the beginning of the creation
[1:05:00] of god hallelujah
[1:05:02] the godhead and that's what the that's
[1:05:04] what jesus says
[1:05:06] in revelation 3 i'm opening a door to
[1:05:09] you
[1:05:09] praise god
[1:05:12] now i just want to show this again this
[1:05:15] is what we battled down through the ages
[1:05:17] christians bowed the deeds
[1:05:18] and then they became a synagogue of
[1:05:20] satan then it became a doctrine so
[1:05:21] they're false
[1:05:22] teachings like transubstantiation infant
[1:05:25] baptism
[1:05:26] it became doctrine right and then
[1:05:28] jezebel religion was the very depths of
[1:05:30] this
[1:05:31] they had names in martin luther's day
[1:05:33] but they were dead martin luther said he
[1:05:35] hoped ten percent of his converts
[1:05:36] would actually be saved he hoped ten
[1:05:40] percent got saved well i could probably
[1:05:41] say the same to that too
[1:05:42] uh the ten percent of all the people we
[1:05:43] baptized i hope ten percent make it by
[1:05:46] god's grace that'd be great
[1:05:48] uh then they were the synagogue of satan
[1:05:50] the days of john wesley and here we are
[1:05:52] what are we battling
[1:05:53] lukewarmness that's what satan wants
[1:05:56] once you get to that in-between stage
[1:05:58] where you have a form of godliness but
[1:05:59] you deny the power but we want godliness
[1:06:02] we want power we want to speak the name
[1:06:05] of jesus and
[1:06:06] power goes forth praise god power to
[1:06:08] change
[1:06:09] our lives power to heal the sick power
[1:06:12] to save souls praise god
[1:06:13] power to rebuke the enemy amen
[1:06:16] power but satan wants to create a
[1:06:19] lukewarm sometimes i'm excited about god
[1:06:21] sometimes i'm not we need to be hot and
[1:06:24] on fire all the time
[1:06:26] it takes a it takes a daily battle but
[1:06:28] paul said i die daily praise god
[1:06:30] that christ might be formed in me
[1:06:33] now this is even deeper because now i
[1:06:36] show the anointings
[1:06:37] right there was four beasts in heaven
[1:06:40] and each one represented an anointing
[1:06:43] the early church had the line anointing
[1:06:46] and then the next two church ages had
[1:06:48] the ox anointing
[1:06:50] and then a couple of church ages three
[1:06:51] had the man anointing but we're in the
[1:06:54] age of the eagle anointing
[1:06:56] because the eagle's known for watching
[1:06:59] right
[1:07:00] watch and pray eagles can go up really
[1:07:02] high and watch
[1:07:03] and see what's going on that's our
[1:07:05] anointing we can rise above the earth
[1:07:07] praise god
[1:07:08] we can rise way above these things and
[1:07:11] see things to come praise god
[1:07:13] we know the mark of the beast is coming
[1:07:14] that's why we're making ready
[1:07:16] to have the mark of god amen hallelujah
[1:07:19] that's why we're making sure our little
[1:07:21] ones are baptized and
[1:07:22] baptized with the holy ghost they need
[1:07:24] to be marked with the holy ghost praise
[1:07:26] god that's why prayer meetings you need
[1:07:29] to really cry out for people
[1:07:30] sigh and cry for the abominations
[1:07:32] because god said i'm going to mark
[1:07:33] those people that side and cry for the
[1:07:35] abominations
[1:07:37] amen now
[1:07:40] i want to pull this out here because we
[1:07:42] may see this in the next coming years
[1:07:44] right now laodicea is at 115 years long
[1:07:49] ephesus is the shortest one so far at
[1:07:53] 117.
[1:07:55] so guess what we're gonna probably have
[1:07:57] the next couple years we're gonna preach
[1:07:58] you're saying
[1:07:59] oh laodicea's gotta be shorter so the
[1:08:01] rapture is gonna have to happen in the
[1:08:02] next two years
[1:08:05] but again there's no prophecy on that
[1:08:09] show it to me if there is there's none
[1:08:12] and i got some more examples preachers
[1:08:14] always do this at church i don't want
[1:08:16] you to be
[1:08:17] i don't want you to be looking for a
[1:08:18] date i don't want you looking for any
[1:08:20] other signs
[1:08:20] we've received our last sign glory we
[1:08:24] received the last sign
[1:08:25] the sign of discernment the sign of
[1:08:28] brother man's ministry that's the last
[1:08:29] sign
[1:08:31] right we received the last sign we don't
[1:08:33] want you looking for signs we want you
[1:08:35] watching and pray
[1:08:36] looking to god praise god you'll be
[1:08:38] ready if you're looking to christ amen
[1:08:42] all these preachers try to pop up or
[1:08:45] build up their reputation by trying to
[1:08:47] guess the rapture and guess this and
[1:08:49] guess that it just it just gets the
[1:08:51] people's lukewarm
[1:08:54] right because they build them up for a
[1:08:55] moment then it comes and passes comes
[1:08:56] and passes comes and passes
[1:08:59] i'm going to give you some examples
[1:09:02] how many message preachers will be
[1:09:03] predicting the rapture the next year
[1:09:05] since they think this last age has to be
[1:09:07] the shortest they think brother brandon
[1:09:09] didn't say that
[1:09:10] they think so 2022 will be 116 years
[1:09:15] this age has been
[1:09:17] oh and they say see it's got to be it's
[1:09:18] got to be shorter than ephesus because
[1:09:20] this is a short quick work
[1:09:22] well that's your own opinion that's your
[1:09:25] that's your idea that's not that's not a
[1:09:27] that's not a prophecy
[1:09:30] 2023 will tie us if the lord tarries
[1:09:33] with ephesus so
[1:09:37] i don't know if my wife remembers this
[1:09:38] but in 2006
[1:09:40] people were saying well this is a
[1:09:42] hundred years since 1906
[1:09:44] when the church age started so 1956 was
[1:09:47] 50-year jubilee
[1:09:48] and 2006 was the second jubilee people
[1:09:51] were calling it the double jubilee
[1:09:54] and so some people were predicting the
[1:09:55] rapture some preachers like you might
[1:09:56] get ready
[1:09:57] might be the rapture it's the second
[1:09:59] jubilee since
[1:10:00] the church age started and brother amen
[1:10:03] i was a little nervous
[1:10:06] rightfully so right because we are just
[1:10:09] young in the faith and didn't understand
[1:10:11] all these
[1:10:11] people trying to make guesses and
[1:10:13] everything like that 2013
[1:10:15] 2015 2013 was the 50-year jubilee when
[1:10:18] the seals opened from 1963. so some
[1:10:20] people were saying oh it's 50 years it's
[1:10:22] a jubilee
[1:10:23] maybe this will be the rapture uh
[1:10:27] a bunch of politicians then 65
[1:10:31] right 2015 was 50 years since 1965
[1:10:36] and they were guessing that one and that
[1:10:38] 2015 was also the year of the blood
[1:10:41] moons remember that brother
[1:10:42] i was all shook up about that see god
[1:10:45] god is
[1:10:45] shaking everything so that the only
[1:10:48] thing that can't be shaken
[1:10:49] are those who are part of the kingdom of
[1:10:51] god amen in other words god is teaching
[1:10:53] us
[1:10:54] how to stand amen stand on the word
[1:10:57] stand on what we
[1:10:58] know as real prophecy he's teaching me
[1:11:00] how to stand
[1:11:03] a couple years ago in 2018 some famous
[1:11:06] preacher from philip
[1:11:08] of the philippines put oh it's 2018.
[1:11:10] look it's 70 years
[1:11:12] from when israel became and they said
[1:11:16] oh this must be the year god goes back
[1:11:17] to the 144 000. that shook me up i'm
[1:11:20] like
[1:11:20] but now i've seen so many of these i
[1:11:21] don't get i try not to get shook up
[1:11:23] anymore
[1:11:24] they're all right brother brothers
[1:11:26] they're always guessing
[1:11:28] like it's not enough just to say watch
[1:11:30] him pray
[1:11:31] it's watch and pray plus do your math
[1:11:35] god don't need my math help i can hardly
[1:11:38] i got to get on my calculator to
[1:11:39] calculate the number of years there how
[1:11:41] can god use my mouth
[1:11:42] god don't need my math he needs my faith
[1:11:45] amen
[1:11:46] he's my love he needs my trust because
[1:11:49] the bible said
[1:11:50] he comes to all those that love his
[1:11:52] appearing amen that's what he needs
[1:11:54] he needs our love not trying to get
[1:11:56] likes on facebook
[1:11:59] like they try to do so we don't live
[1:12:02] through at all church
[1:12:04] we don't live through oh it doesn't yeah
[1:12:06] i won't get into that when i better not
[1:12:07] get it
[1:12:08] because i'm going to talk about joseph
[1:12:09] remember i better not get on that one
[1:12:11] and i told my william i wouldn't mind
[1:12:12] meeting him but i know one thing's for
[1:12:14] sure he won't talk to me about the truth
[1:12:17] i know that for sure because i said can
[1:12:18] we meet can we talk we talk on the phone
[1:12:20] no reply so they don't
[1:12:23] that that's how you that's how people
[1:12:25] are when they're afraid
[1:12:27] that's how people are when they know
[1:12:28] they have no answers
[1:12:30] just a simple question is billy paul the
[1:12:32] promise joseph like brother am said in
[1:12:34] 1952
[1:12:37] they can't even answer that yes or no
[1:12:38] you can't even give me a yes or no
[1:12:39] answer
[1:12:41] how weak is that that's it that's right
[1:12:45] that's right they try to get you off
[1:12:47] right they won't even answer like
[1:12:48] pharisees that's right the pharisees
[1:12:50] said oh we can't tell who john was he
[1:12:52] said and i won't tell you either
[1:12:54] right jesus remember they asked jesus
[1:12:56] that that's good brother that's real
[1:12:57] good
[1:12:58] they won't do it they don't have an
[1:13:00] answer like i said that man with his
[1:13:01] speeches
[1:13:01] how come you don't have a wedding
[1:13:02] garment on
[1:13:06] no answer they don't have an answer but
[1:13:08] we know
[1:13:09] why do you have the wedding garment on
[1:13:11] because i went down to the crimson river
[1:13:13] amen
[1:13:14] and i confessed my sins i got sanctified
[1:13:16] and the holy ghost fill my
[1:13:18] soul now i'm wearing white garments on
[1:13:20] amen i'm dressed for the rapture
[1:13:22] i'm ready for the wedding come lord
[1:13:24] jesus amen
[1:13:26] i don't need a calculator i need the
[1:13:27] garment praise god
[1:13:29] that's what i need like they say the
[1:13:33] gold coat the goal post keeps changing
[1:13:37] all right first it was 50 years from
[1:13:40] 50 years from 1956 and then it's
[1:13:43] 70 years from 1940 what's it gonna be
[1:13:45] next church what's gonna be next
[1:13:47] next is gonna be 100 years since brother
[1:13:49] ram died whatever what is it
[1:13:52] what's the magic number there ain't a
[1:13:53] matching number it's an unknown number
[1:13:57] there a magic system to it it's love for
[1:14:00] jesus christ
[1:14:02] happy are those who keep the law
[1:14:05] for us it's a spiritual law praise god
[1:14:07] amen
[1:14:08] hallelujah so i just want to give you
[1:14:09] some examples see don't be surprised
[1:14:12] you start hearing preachers saying that
[1:14:14] i just got that this morning i wasn't
[1:14:15] even planning on preaching that it just
[1:14:16] came to me this morning
[1:14:17] i started looking at those dates i was
[1:14:18] like oh whoa i said i need to update
[1:14:20] this it's been
[1:14:21] a year since i updated this it's that
[1:14:23] updated like four or five years
[1:14:27] now here's the quotes the seventh age a
[1:14:30] very short age it doesn't say the
[1:14:31] shortest
[1:14:34] gathers up into itself for one quick
[1:14:36] work all the evil the age and yet all
[1:14:37] the reality of pentecost
[1:14:40] hallelujah it is to this egg jesus says
[1:14:43] i come quickly verse 11 so it's
[1:14:45] revelation 3 11.
[1:14:46] that makes the last age a very short one
[1:14:49] laodicea is the age of the quick work it
[1:14:51] is cut short
[1:14:53] he never said it was the shortest so be
[1:14:56] careful
[1:14:58] deceiving preachers like to do that
[1:14:59] they'd like to take their own
[1:15:01] spin on a quote in order to be popular
[1:15:04] get a few more amens
[1:15:05] or tickle your ears let's just say what
[1:15:08] the bible says praise god
[1:15:10] let's be happy with what the bible
[1:15:11] teaches
[1:15:13] oh glory okay so with these three
[1:15:17] timelines
[1:15:18] in mind we know our enemy we know we've
[1:15:20] got to finish the great commission
[1:15:23] and we know we got to have an on fire
[1:15:26] overcoming life until the rapture
[1:15:30] is that right aren't you glad church you
[1:15:32] have three maybe five timelines aren't
[1:15:34] you glad about that
[1:15:34] let me pull another one up there uh oh
[1:15:37] yeah i just summarized it
[1:15:39] here's how based upon god's timelines
[1:15:41] and remember two of these are thus saith
[1:15:43] the lord
[1:15:44] right the romans i'm sorry the daniel
[1:15:47] two and the seven church ages program
[1:15:49] said these are thus saith the lord
[1:15:51] will overcome the beast romanism
[1:15:53] antichrist spirit
[1:15:55] through the hot fiery eagle anointing
[1:15:58] and finish cleaning the great commission
[1:16:00] until the last trump that sound like a
[1:16:02] good vision for you
[1:16:04] that's all i see brother amen that's all
[1:16:06] i see that's my vision
[1:16:08] that's all i can see all i can see is my
[1:16:10] enemies are these denominations
[1:16:12] and i'm trying to just call one out who
[1:16:13] will come out come out of her my people
[1:16:16] god still heals cancer god's god's
[1:16:18] coming for a rapture
[1:16:19] god sent a prophet amen just trying to
[1:16:22] glean one where we can ever find one or
[1:16:24] two people to come out and glean
[1:16:26] and yet the whole time god's empowering
[1:16:28] us to fly above worldliness
[1:16:30] to live far above it and to see what is
[1:16:34] coming praise god
[1:16:35] by the spiritual power of god
[1:16:38] that's my vision
[1:16:42] now here's another one these were given
[1:16:44] thus saith the lord as well so there's
[1:16:46] i believe it's cut off right here
[1:16:48] because these were so clearly
[1:16:50] identified even by sinners
[1:16:53] right all the sinners had to say he died
[1:16:55] first then he died
[1:16:57] and then this was swallowed up into
[1:16:59] communism
[1:17:01] i found numerous internet articles that
[1:17:03] say that nazism and fascism
[1:17:05] were swallowed up in other words
[1:17:06] communism took over those
[1:17:08] it became more of a movement nobody can
[1:17:11] disagree with these so that means
[1:17:13] nobody will disagree with these when
[1:17:14] these come to pass
[1:17:16] that's how i believe god backs up his
[1:17:18] word
[1:17:19] i don't believe god backs up his word
[1:17:21] and you have to kind of wonder is this
[1:17:22] fulfilled or not
[1:17:23] it could be could not be it i believe
[1:17:26] it'll be so obvious to the believer
[1:17:29] so i believe we're waiting for this
[1:17:30] google what the google tried to get them
[1:17:32] running by 2020. they missed
[1:17:35] but they're they're continuing to
[1:17:37] advance and then uh
[1:17:38] this moral problem with women but ram
[1:17:40] said he saw women dressed in uh
[1:17:43] only a only a figly phone to cover their
[1:17:45] midsection
[1:17:46] he said he saw him dressed like that he
[1:17:48] said he saw it in a magazine
[1:17:50] but i just believe it's gonna have to
[1:17:51] happen more worldwide
[1:17:53] that's just what i believe because i
[1:17:55] believe that all these happened in order
[1:17:57] so i believe these have to happen in
[1:17:58] order as well and a woman rising to
[1:18:01] power in the u.s
[1:18:01] i thought it was hillary clinton back in
[1:18:03] the day
[1:18:05] could be kamala harris could be but i
[1:18:06] still believe these things have to be
[1:18:08] fulfilled first
[1:18:09] for some women who rise to power we know
[1:18:12] for sure
[1:18:13] it could be some women natural but we
[1:18:15] know for sure it's a spiritual woman
[1:18:18] the roman catholic church has to rule in
[1:18:21] this nation
[1:18:22] it has to because that's what revelation
[1:18:24] 13 says
[1:18:26] the beasts just change its form it was
[1:18:30] first out of the sea
[1:18:31] but then it kind of come up out of the
[1:18:32] sea and come on the land with those
[1:18:33] seven heads
[1:18:35] come out in the land of the united
[1:18:36] states and now it's the superpower you
[1:18:38] know i've heard numerous preachers this
[1:18:39] week i was listening to different
[1:18:40] sermons
[1:18:41] denominational preachers they don't even
[1:18:42] believe the united states is in the
[1:18:44] bible
[1:18:45] can you believe that's how blind they
[1:18:47] are and they think maybe it's because
[1:18:48] everybody's saved you know
[1:18:50] in america they're gonna have a great
[1:18:51] revival and so we're just going to be
[1:18:53] the church
[1:18:54] well come on and yet murdering 62
[1:18:56] million babies
[1:18:58] letting men and women change their
[1:19:00] identities of the
[1:19:01] saying god gave them a female spirit
[1:19:03] when they're a man that's an abomination
[1:19:06] it's an abomination god has called us
[1:19:08] out of darkness
[1:19:10] into the light praise god amen we're not
[1:19:13] child of the night and sleeping
[1:19:14] we're awake we know exactly what god
[1:19:16] wants us to do praise god
[1:19:18] we know the vision of this day oh i got
[1:19:21] two minutes till my 45 minutes is up so
[1:19:23] i'll try to finish up here
[1:19:26] and then we know usa has to be bomb but
[1:19:28] that's that's in revelation too
[1:19:30] there's so many things getting blown up
[1:19:32] in revelation
[1:19:33] i don't know the exact scripture for
[1:19:34] that so i have to look that one up there
[1:19:36] i don't know the exact scripture for
[1:19:37] that one
[1:19:38] um now here here's where broadband says
[1:19:40] in 1964.
[1:19:42] he says uh i said such progress will
[1:19:45] take place
[1:19:46] i'll see the automobiles looking like an
[1:19:47] egg going down the street there's cars
[1:19:49] on the highways with some kind of remote
[1:19:51] control
[1:19:51] they don't have to guide it i see an
[1:19:52] american family playing checker
[1:19:54] in the back of a car they got the car
[1:19:57] right now if they just had the highways
[1:20:00] to put it on
[1:20:01] so but i recognize we don't have the
[1:20:03] highways yet
[1:20:04] a year before he passed away okay and
[1:20:07] now do they have the cars well
[1:20:10] maybe not it doesn't look like maybe
[1:20:11] they didn't he thought they did based
[1:20:12] upon magazine articles
[1:20:14] right but do we have the cars yet not
[1:20:16] quite yet do we do we have any families
[1:20:18] of ours playing checkers in the car
[1:20:20] or anything like have you seen american
[1:20:21] family playing checkers in the car i
[1:20:23] haven't seen it yet
[1:20:24] so that's why i believe brother admitted
[1:20:25] on a couple occasions we don't have all
[1:20:27] these things in place yet
[1:20:29] they're still in the process of coming
[1:20:30] to pass okay now
[1:20:34] i'm gonna have to skip through some of
[1:20:35] this but remember church the word hot
[1:20:38] if we're gonna be on fire we need to we
[1:20:40] need to be hot which means have
[1:20:42] we need more of god each service i know
[1:20:44] it's hard church i'm a
[1:20:46] i'm a sinner saved by grace too but each
[1:20:48] service we got to come to church and say
[1:20:49] i need more of god today
[1:20:52] and if you can only amen for the first
[1:20:54] five minutes give me all you god
[1:20:56] but i know i can preach a lot longer
[1:20:57] than five minutes you just stay with me
[1:20:59] as long
[1:21:00] as you can or maybe start good take a
[1:21:02] break and then amen a lot at the end
[1:21:04] in other words pull on the word of god
[1:21:06] right because you have you have to
[1:21:08] recognize you have to
[1:21:09] i have to recognize that we need more we
[1:21:11] don't have enough of the holy ghost
[1:21:13] we need more of it praise god yet we're
[1:21:15] filled with it
[1:21:17] yet we're filled in our soul where we
[1:21:19] need more of it is in our mind praise
[1:21:21] god
[1:21:23] to be transformed to change our actions
[1:21:26] there's my 45 minutes
[1:21:29] we have to zealously repent and don't
[1:21:31] tell me you don't sin we all sin
[1:21:34] or else we're liars that makes us
[1:21:35] sinners
[1:21:38] and oh we have to open our life to
[1:21:40] christ because he said i stand at the
[1:21:41] door
[1:21:42] knock and we have to have continual sup
[1:21:45] with christ
[1:21:46] oh lord just break the bread to me lord
[1:21:49] what did you bring today to eat
[1:21:51] what'd you bring today now what does hot
[1:21:54] in the greek mean it means
[1:21:55] boiling hot fervor of mine so when when
[1:21:58] we say we're not lukewarm
[1:21:59] see lukewarm they they lose their
[1:22:02] excitement for the word
[1:22:04] every day church we gotta have our minds
[1:22:06] boiling on the things of god
[1:22:10] like i told you i uh uh sometimes i
[1:22:12] listen to some of our sermons again so i
[1:22:14] know what's going on but that actually
[1:22:15] stirs me up because i see all you
[1:22:16] worshiping and
[1:22:17] praising god i get to listen to some of
[1:22:19] the songs remember what the holy spirit
[1:22:21] said
[1:22:21] i listened to brother tim pruitt brother
[1:22:23] cam or the simon sometimes brother
[1:22:24] brooks i listen to him too
[1:22:26] those those those brothers stir my faith
[1:22:29] praise god
[1:22:29] that keeps my mind moving on the things
[1:22:32] of god
[1:22:33] right and we've got to keep our minds
[1:22:35] like that's hot
[1:22:36] keep in your mind constantly meditating
[1:22:40] on the things of god
[1:22:42] to be a hot christian now we have to
[1:22:45] skip some of these but look what brother
[1:22:46] ram says
[1:22:51] oh there's i don't have enough time here
[1:22:52] so let me just i'll just skip ahead i
[1:22:54] can't go through those
[1:22:56] yeah i don't have enough time but just
[1:22:58] so you know in the book coming out i
[1:22:59] have 30 thus saith the lords
[1:23:01] six of the twelve prophecies have thus
[1:23:03] saith the lord i'm sorry six of the
[1:23:04] twelve mysteries now there's eight other
[1:23:06] doctrines that investigate the lord
[1:23:08] five prophecies that have already come
[1:23:10] to pass
[1:23:12] and then 11 usa prophecies all the
[1:23:14] prophecies of united states are
[1:23:15] destruction
[1:23:17] they're not going to repent we're not
[1:23:19] going to have a national revival
[1:23:21] but they will have a revival to the
[1:23:23] antichrist
[1:23:24] so it's going to be a false revival now
[1:23:27] little churches like ours will have real
[1:23:28] holy ghost revivals that's what we're
[1:23:30] having now
[1:23:32] i've been having it for 15 years praise
[1:23:34] god
[1:23:35] i didn't hear you i know you have to if
[1:23:36] you've been in the word
[1:23:38] i'm revived all the time praise god
[1:23:43] but everyone brother spoke was the the
[1:23:46] god
[1:23:47] america claims to serve will destroy her
[1:23:51] because she won't repent now let me just
[1:23:54] close
[1:23:54] we know the last anointing before the
[1:23:56] rapture is called the latter rain
[1:23:58] that rain has to mature the wheat for
[1:24:01] harvest
[1:24:03] but look brother brahm said the rapture
[1:24:05] church will be an easy thing
[1:24:07] if you're watching and praying
[1:24:10] in other words it's just going to be as
[1:24:12] easy as you come into church today
[1:24:15] how'd you get the church today you obey
[1:24:16] the voice the voice inside of you
[1:24:20] you obeyed that voice and said yeah i'm
[1:24:21] gonna go worship my lord today
[1:24:23] i might be tired i might even be a
[1:24:25] little sick
[1:24:26] but i'm gonna go and worship the lord
[1:24:28] because i feel a pull
[1:24:30] right so you obey the holy spirit the
[1:24:32] holy spirit said gather more as you see
[1:24:34] that day approaching and you obey
[1:24:36] some of you crossed so many miles god
[1:24:38] bless your hearts for crossing all those
[1:24:39] miles
[1:24:41] and you obey the holy spirit it was an
[1:24:44] easy thing
[1:24:46] to obey the holy spirit that's what
[1:24:48] brother brahm says
[1:24:49] noah's building an ark not only working
[1:24:51] a miracle he was preparing for a miracle
[1:24:55] the church today is not only having
[1:24:57] miracles but it's preparing for america
[1:25:01] the coming of the lord jesus christ and
[1:25:02] the rapture of the church to be taken up
[1:25:04] give me a church ready visualized
[1:25:08] to see the signs and to see the
[1:25:10] omnipotent god the great power of god
[1:25:12] moving amongst the people
[1:25:13] which the rapture will be an easy thing
[1:25:16] when jesus comes
[1:25:18] they'll be caught up because they
[1:25:20] believe in such
[1:25:23] see we'll just get caught up into more
[1:25:25] of the same
[1:25:26] excitement we have now which we caught
[1:25:28] up more of the revelation
[1:25:30] more of the love we have now god is
[1:25:32] going to lead us to the rapture praise
[1:25:34] god
[1:25:35] we'll be caught up already it'll be an
[1:25:37] easy thing
[1:25:38] because we're already yielded to the
[1:25:39] holy ghost right now
[1:25:43] are there going to be pressures outside
[1:25:44] yes pressure is without
[1:25:46] but we have peace within
[1:25:50] and of course we'll have the anointing
[1:25:51] for it think about the anointing but the
[1:25:54] amen head
[1:25:54] his dad kicked him out he had the
[1:25:56] anointing he had to decide do i stay at
[1:25:58] home with all everything provided food
[1:25:59] shelter clothing or do i stand on the
[1:26:01] message of the hour
[1:26:02] he had the anointing to leave everything
[1:26:04] was it easy
[1:26:06] i imagine it was easy there's probably
[1:26:08] some hard mind battles in there right
[1:26:09] but
[1:26:10] it was an easy choice to make so we
[1:26:13] receded with open arms come on buddy
[1:26:15] come on come to my house
[1:26:17] right but when it come down to it it's
[1:26:19] an easy decision
[1:26:21] because i know the word is right let the
[1:26:22] world take whatever they want from me
[1:26:25] let the world have whatever they want
[1:26:27] you can take the whole world just give
[1:26:29] me jesus
[1:26:31] see there will be trials and struggles
[1:26:33] without but the power of god inside of
[1:26:35] you will make
[1:26:36] it an easy decision to forsake
[1:26:38] everything
[1:26:39] and prepare for christ's coming
[1:26:43] see perhaps you know easy thing because
[1:26:45] of the supernatural we'll see vindicated
[1:26:47] brought to pass what if we see some of
[1:26:49] these fourth
[1:26:50] vision fifth vision sixth vision what if
[1:26:53] we see some of these happen
[1:26:55] that's gonna raise our faith even more
[1:26:57] but even not it's okay
[1:26:59] if all that happens after the rapture no
[1:27:00] problem i'm still watching for jesus
[1:27:02] right now
[1:27:03] right
[1:27:07] and church all the latter rain is is a
[1:27:10] refilling of the holy ghost up here
[1:27:12] can't be the soul because the bible
[1:27:14] never says the soul gets refilled
[1:27:17] you don't okay i don't have time the
[1:27:19] dynamics of the church will be a
[1:27:20] refilling of the holy spirit that we
[1:27:22] worked in a small measure while the
[1:27:24] headstones coming down
[1:27:25] to unite with the body let's stand to
[1:27:27] our feet do you remember
[1:27:29] right after you got the holy ghost how
[1:27:31] did you feel
[1:27:33] how did you act what was your attitude
[1:27:36] oh my that's what you're going to feel
[1:27:38] like in the latter rain
[1:27:40] that excitement that power that that
[1:27:42] enthusiasm
[1:27:44] that imagination that all things are
[1:27:46] possible i'm a child of god
[1:27:48] god lives inside of me i i love this
[1:27:51] word it's so fresh it's so real i know
[1:27:53] this is right
[1:27:54] you'll be refilled with that praise god
[1:27:58] but then your faith will go so much
[1:27:59] higher
[1:28:01] because we'll see the dead in christ
[1:28:03] rise
[1:28:05] think about that it's just back to that
[1:28:08] first time when you got
[1:28:09] when you were born again by the baptism
[1:28:11] of the holy ghost
[1:28:12] see it'd be such an easy thing
[1:28:15] just to continue in this anointing that
[1:28:17] we're under right now
[1:28:19] how many want to continue in the
[1:28:20] anointing of the baptism of the holy
[1:28:21] ghost
[1:28:22] musicians can come let's pray for that
[1:28:23] there are so many other things i wanted
[1:28:25] to get to
[1:28:25] relating to missionary work perhaps
[1:28:27] maybe this evening or
[1:28:31] gathering more as we see that day
[1:28:32] approaching we have to go right back to
[1:28:34] acts chapter 2 and
[1:28:35] whatever they had there that's what god
[1:28:37] wants to restore right back to acts
[1:28:39] chapter 2.
[1:28:42] there were some hebrews there were some
[1:28:43] galions they're speaking
[1:28:46] right they were speaking in the tongues
[1:28:48] of the cretians
[1:28:50] here's galileans with no education
[1:28:53] speaking in greek
[1:28:55] and like how do we hear these greek guys
[1:28:57] they're not even greek how do we hear
[1:28:58] them
[1:29:00] and peter says this is that which joel
[1:29:02] prophesied
[1:29:03] the spirit of god will be poured out in
[1:29:05] the last days amen
[1:29:07] hallelujah and your sons and your
[1:29:09] daughters see visions and dream dreams
[1:29:10] praise god
[1:29:11] sorry about that huh it's okay don't
[1:29:13] worry about it you can shut it off if
[1:29:14] you want something
[1:29:15] if it don't go back no problem but
[1:29:18] church that's what we want by god's
[1:29:19] grace let's bow heads for a moment
[1:29:23] try to keep it about an hour yeah it's
[1:29:24] look like it's an hour now so
