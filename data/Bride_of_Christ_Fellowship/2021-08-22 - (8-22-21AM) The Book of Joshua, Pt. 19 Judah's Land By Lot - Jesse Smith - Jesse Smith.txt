========================================

zion's birthday yesterday let's give him a round of applause god bless you buddy johnny's birthday is next sunday next saturday next saturday it's good road johnny round vlog turning 25 must be nice brother turn 25 i'm not going to ask his age i could probably guess his agent i'm not going to ask his age god bless you so i hope you have a great birthday by the grace of god what's that 35 35 okay you don't have to share that really no that's a wonderful brother god bless you sir and uh may lord bless this next year of your life praise god so thankful for each and every person and all the sacrifices made to to worship the lord and continue the kingdom of god on earth praise god we know there's a kingdom coming right there's a an unmovable kingdom coming but the bible says we are actually partakers of the spiritual kingdom now that cannot be moved that's one great lesson i learned from those two sermons i guess i heard i heard a sermon called a higher uh was a higher calling let me just look real quick i took notes on the sermons and everything the first church i heard a sermon called a higher what was it higher calling i'm sorry a higher purpose and then the second one was believers boot camp so like a military theme you know how they go to boot camp soldier goes to boot camp to learn how to obey and march and everything so i heard those two sermons this morning and uh i just i just was reminded of uh the grace of the holy spirit to us praise god and i'll just be honest you know i i really love being there you know i got to fellowship and hear a little bit of word word of the lord but church i can just tell that these people are not into the promised land yet they're still in boot camp right they're still coming out of they come out of egypt many of them but they're still in the wilderness right trying to get through trying to be sanctified trying trying to get through boot camp but church brother man says the message has come and we should be he said uh soldiers we should be uh hazarded soldiers uh experienced soldiers praise god that know how to handle the word of god praise god and that's why when i went there i don't hear any preaching about sin it's all blessings it's all blessings but see the just like joshua the church of living god when sins in there the holy spirit calls it out to remove it that the church can move on victorious in the name of the lord so thank the lord for that praise god we're blessed people today hallelujah so i thank the lord now let's look at this judah's land by lot now in chapter 14 here's the outline i've been i've been using a a software called e-sword some of you may have it and uh it's where you look up commentaries right like matthew henry these are preachers from the 1800s and john gill john wesley he's from the 1600s or 1700s rather you can look them up and so i'm just getting the outline from them so you can have an idea what this chapter is about if you remember chapter 13 i only preached on really the first two verses of it because the rest of it was details about all the land that the two and a half tribes were going to get on the east side of jordan and so to me when i read that i didn't feel any inspiration from the holy spirit on preaching that except maybe now it's coming to me maybe people that choose not to be born again and they choose a place to be a foolish virgin so i'll say like this let them have their choice if that's their choice see we ought to let them have their choice because god lets them have their choice but as for our us and our houses we ought to choose uh land inside the promised land praise god we ought to choose to go into the promised land and fight the real battles praise god yes we ought to fight the real battles by the grace of the lord that's what we've done so uh just kind of striking me now but in chapter 14 in verses one to five we see the method of dividing the land by lot how is it done well verses one through five tell us how is the lot divided how do they know manasseh got that or ephraim got that in this case judah how do they know benjamin got that it was all done in a certain method and so we see that verses one to five and then six to twelve we see caleb's demand upon hebron it was through moses's promise right we all we're familiar with that give me my mountain praise god so we'll look at that a little bit here today lord willing and then the chapter ends by joshua granting him his request and lord willing we might even get into some of chapter 15 here we'll see i got some some scriptures prepared for chapter 15 as well uh by the grace of god let me set a timer here because i need to conserve my strength i went back to work this week i got 18. beautiful little children running around most of them are really well behaved by the way you most of them most of them will listen to me right away but not all of them so i got to be on top of my mental game here no that was great it's a good start to the year and uh thankful for the grace of the lord so uh chapter 14 now verses one and two we read that for our text right and so we can see here we see method or the protocol for how the holy spirit is going to give out the land to god's priesthood remember this was the bible said it was a nation of priests it was a kingdom of priests unto god and the bible picks it up now of course we know levites were the main group we'll get to that as well levites were the main group of priests but god was actually longing for church he was longing for an entire body of people that would all be spiritual kings and priests unto him but we know most of them after the first generation started turning god down in fact most of them that left egypt wanted to go back to egypt right most of people that try to get saved or get baptized they fall away right we've all seen it right we've all seen just just like that day most of them fall back away but there were some elect believers there were some real believers strong in faith that were able to possess the promises they really loved god they really believed the prophet amen hallelujah oh yeah just so you know i got i bought all the books from 1963 and 1962 they're out there now so i bought i bought about 200 new books so i'm going to put them on the shelf there so you can take them home keep them or you can read them and bring them back like sister hua whatever you want to do i don't care you can keep them or just bring them back the thing to do is fill your mind with the word of god praise the lord and so uh and so we pick it up here and uh they're trying to divide it now and joshua has a certain method by the holy spirit leads him how to give out portions of land what is their inheritance now i'm getting back to my thought now in church in the new testament we are all spiritual kings and priests unto god male or female see sisters god does something special in the new testament he lets you be a priest spiritually praise god amen the prayers of sisters are equally powerful before god now the only reason a man's prayer would be greater because he has a gift to pray for that special need right that's why they would they would really want to go to brother ram he had a gift to pray remember there was a sister that prayed for the woman who had the sick baby god heard her prayer as well she was still an intercessor by prayer so what a blessing it is to be a new testament sister or brother we're all spiritual kings unto god we're all priests unto god amen we're all to make intercession for those in need by the power of god to jesus christ that means we might receive the blessings and the inheritances of our father amen and we'll get to that i think in chapter 15 and 16 we'll start looking at all these all these divisions in the land they're not as i said they're not all cookie cutters and neither are all the gifts cookie cutters right because sisters now sisters now can prophesy sisters can get a vote give a word of wisdom sisters can give a word of knowledge sisters can cast out devils right most of that was kind of looked down upon you know previously maybe to the new testament sisters were just they were lesser value right they could marry numerous wives men can marry your newest wives just lesser value now god still used some of them but here in the new testament jesus christ opens it up and he allows sisters to be spiritual priests as well praise god amen talk about mercy amen talk about grace amen to redeem sinners like us praise god male and female praise god but we're thankful here for the grace of the lord now uh i want you to notice here notice the inheritance or possession it only comes after consistent fighting and victory now historians say it either took them five to seven years to drive out 31 kings i'm not asking you to do to be a demon stomper the first year you get here praise god church now you might be i'm not asking to cast out devils even the second or third year or something like that what i'm i'm looking to see what i want to see in my life is spiritual growth praise god i want to see uh people that find the land that god's called them to amen and so they know what they can do by the leading of the holy ghost they know the gifts in their lives and if now this gets a little more advanced you know the gifts but then you also know brother braham said god may use you for a gift that may not be your gift he just may use you for it one time and then never use you again with that gift now that's real maturity because now you realize well god maybe have healed through my life maybe he's given a a a prophecy through my life but god but see you want to be so mature that you can say god speak a tongue through me speak a word of wisdom for me you can do a miracle through me even though you've never done it before i'm not going to limit you because if i'm under your anointing then i'm a soldier i'm a conqueror in jesus name he can call me for a special job praise the lord because i have this a special mission for the soldiers hallelujah five to seven years they finally drop they're just fighting constant fighting all the time five to seven years and then finally give me a place where i can rest lord i want a place just to rest on a place i can call home raise my family now see our natural and spiritual eyes are blended together praise god we don't just get to stop battling now we just get to live you know it's it's combined together praise god but uh as you know there will be seasons of rest in our lives praise god and there's going to be seasons of more harsh battles but we have to understand that god doesn't give them their possession right away they've got to fight for a few years they've got to drive they've got to really get some victories over some giants they got to prove to god that they really believe the word of god because last time we looked at and shown how joshua fulfilled all the plan for his life but other israelis didn't and so that those many of the israelis many of the tribes didn't drive out all the sins they should have driven out so they didn't inherit all the promises but joshua did because joshua was a faithful servant praise god he was a type of jesus amen i said this is a type of the holy ghost praise god hallelujah because he did the bible said he wholly followed the will of god there wasn't one thing that joshua left out yes he made mistakes but when god forgave him he was always ready to come back into fellowship and say yes lord i'm putting this behind me now what's my next mission what's what's my next uh what's my uh my next victory praise god lead me by the holy spirit i want to know what you want me to do and i want to go forward in your name hallelujah thank god see remember chapter 12 lists all those 31 kings and that shows you god god the days of those demons in your lives they're numbered you might have battled depression for years but listen church depression's name that demon his days are numbered amen you just hang around this church for a few years praise god god's going to deliver you praise god he's going to set you free you've just got to keep fighting you just got to keep possessing the land speaking the word believing the promises and god will drive out every one of those spiritual wickedness in high places amen amen he'll drive everyone out but you got to be dedicated you got to be consistent praise god you've got to be obedient to the word of god and after a few years or so god drives them all out praise god amen last time i was i think i'll just share it now remember i told you how to complex last last week so i emailed the brother the preacher and i found out for all these 16 years the preacher wasn't calling me a giant he was calling my pastor the giant now still that still associates me i'm a minister under a giant like a goliath that still like associates me i'm under goliath and he said oh i'm so hurt you thought that well i thought well for i'm sorry so i just apologized but i said but still when you call my pastor a giant that associates me as a giant but i feel so much better now because that holy spirit last week with brother randy's preaching brought that out and i knew i had to make that right and now i feel so much more clear praise god now it's in the balls in his court now to kind of talk about anything future but i said i'm sorry i i'm sorry i thought that i said i had fear but now fear has been cast out praise god amen praise god so see church we're to live free from any hindrance right the bible said all spiritual blessing let's say all ready all spiritual blessings are ours in christ jesus if we have enough faith to obtain it amen just want to give you an update on that certain starting to feel better by god's grace i always felt good but starting to get all the things from the past cleaned out by the grace of the lord now look here uh this scripture just kind of came to my heart when i was studying yesterday paul says my beloved brethren be steadfast unmovable which is firmly persistent always abounding in the work of the lord now that means increasing in the work of the lord he says for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain right so israel needed five to seven years to drive out 31 kings they're laid their fighting wasn't in vain right they could now for those five years they could have said when are we ever going to get our land when am i going to get my house i was promised when am i going to get all this when am i going to get the blessings we're not going to get my answers but god was saying fight first fight first praise god fight first battle first the blessing will come but i want you to learn how to fight amen the rest will come the inheritance will come the possessions will come but i want you to fight first i want you to be steadfast i want you to be unmovable i don't want anyone to be able to shake you i want you to be strong in the word of the lord praise god in the power of his mind hallelujah i want you to be like that and then after fighting and laboring and pressing then after all that you'll possess the promise i'm going to share our good testimony a little bit here by god's grace not my personal testimony but when i heard yesterday from sheffield uh from brother uh richard sanchez you might remember him brother he's a deacon up in sheffield beautiful testimony i'll share that a little bit as it kind of ties in but see the bible paul tells us we've got to battle we cannot stop fighting we've got to keep fighting praise god victory is ahead i say that on wednesday right victory ahead victory ahead through the blood of jesus victories ahead it is praise god we we we're promised that we're guaranteed it amen if we just keep fighting we just keep praying keep confessing sin and keep serving the lord god is going to bring all his promises to pass god cannot fail but he wants to see us fight and labor he wants to see us be devoted dedicated hallelujah on the battlefield praise god it reminded me of this beloved we're persuaded better things of you better things than what in the previous verses one through eight paul is talking about he said there are some that are enlightened by the spirit of god that is tasted the good word of god he said but then they they live contrary to it he said they become thorns and briars they they drink of the holy spirit but then they live ungodly lives it's the workers of iniquity right they get under the anointing they pump up the music they feel the spirit of god miracles happen but then they go out and they live their dirty little lives i can do this i can get away with that i can steal this i can do this i can sleep around i can do whatever i want right i can i can murder i can they can do whatever they want that's what they're talking about but paul says we're persuaded better things of you amen we're not going to let the anointing be in vain we're going to let the anointing empower our lives for a complete life of service to christ praise god i'm not a temporary message believer i am a permanent everyday sold out holy ghost filled saying praise god that ought to be your confession it ought to be my confession i'm in this for the end i'm steadfast i'm unmovable i'm always about it we're always abounding in the work of the lord praise god hallelujah yes i fall short yeah but i get right back to work and praise god i just got to get back to work and praise god eventually i get there by the grace of the lord but see they choose to live a life of iniquity right a life the word is lawlessness a life of lawlessness yet they knew the word of god they knew how to get the anointing but they never let the anointing seep down into their souls to change their nature now so far away so see they fell away those thorns those briars those wheat those weeds those tares right and things that accompany salvation though we thus speak for god church he's un not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love god did not forget about you hallelujah god has not forgot about you can i say it like this it's impossible for him to forget you and i forget we let things go years and years we'll forget months and months i'll forget days and days we forget all the time but god is not gonna forget all those good things you did to glorify his name amen he won't forget that he knows he's aware of it he sees it but he's trying to mold your character to be more like his if he gave you everything right away you'd be a spoiled brat like some of the students at my school i used to be right as a sinner a spoiled brat i gotta have it now i gotta have it now okay lord i gotta have it now god i don't want you to act like that god wants you to be patient and just trust the promise hallelujah i'm persuaded better things of you see anything you show towards his name any work you do for god's name he's not going to forget it read it we might as well read it let's go to malachi i believe it's chapter 2 if i'm not mistaken i wasn't planning on preaching this but sometimes i feel out of the holy spirit to do things like that i think it's at the end of chapter two if anybody finds it let me know the book of remembrance let me look up my phone here all right i can't find it so let me look up in my bible app here anybody see it yet maokai 316 there it is sorry thanks for your patience malachi 3 16. i couldn't find it oh yeah there it is oh my goodness gracious looking right around it instead of looking right at it verse 16 then they that feared the lord how many fear of the lord today that's why you're in his house if you didn't fear the lord you wouldn't be in his house because judgment begins at the house of god they speak often to one another see church when we talk we make sure we got to talk about the lord too praise god yeah i like talking about the weather i'm talking about jobs that's a way to kind of get it started but then we want to talk about the lord praise god see when we fear the lord that's all we think about is the lord so it's on our minds it's on our tongues as we got to keep talking about the lord right he says and the lord hearkened and heard it and a book of remembrance was written before him so remember jesus said the book of life was written before the foundation of the world that's right that's for salvation right in the lamb's book of life also but here's a book that's written in real time brother amen i didn't hear you praise god it's before the lord and the bible said for them that feared his name and that thought upon his name amen so in other words the angels my brother said the angels are writing down your requests right now praise god oh we ought to be thankful church when you meditate on the lord and you talk about the lord the lord hears that he doesn't forget that he'll remember that and he'll answer a new season amen be encouraged be faithful hallelujah be like god amen hallelujah i look like a maniac compared to those preachers i heard this morning but that's okay i was just kind of laughing to myself like what would they think if i got up there and preached they'd say here's the door preacher they wouldn't encourage me they would compel me by grabbing me to leave the pulpit that's all right though let's see now see that and that you minister to the saints and new ministers so see church when we love god we have to service people if you're not serving in the body then you need to start doing that because you can't love god without loving the people he created hallelujah so let that be a desire that's that might be part of your land can i say it like that that might be what you're going to grow into that's what you're going to fight for praise god amen and you might already be doing it but uh ministering to the body of christ that's our job and we desire every one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope to them see we got to be diligent we got to be faithful we got to be consecrated we got to be on time every time praise god hallelujah we got to be about the father's business all the time praise god diligent because we have a full assurance that you be not slaughtered this is what we got to battle mainly in america right because other countries are persecuted they won't be thoughtful because they're constantly under battles right now physical battles but we have it so easy in america well we don't know for how long but we haven't so easy in america we get lazy but paul says don't be lazy he says always abound in the things of the lord find somebody to minister to praise god minister to someone praise god sibo and then we we follow uh we followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promise think of somebody who's inherited lots of promises in the bible like brother branham or other people that you might know and respect the bible said follow their faith watch how they live their life if god's answering a lot of their prayers many times it's because they're doing this they're diligent to obey the word of god praise god they're diligent to minister so paul says find people that are diligently uh following the promise of god follow their lives and model yourself after them not the briers from verses one through eight don't follow them let the anointing be a permanent anointing let it be an everyday christian praise god be not slaughterful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises but remember god's watching you and he's having those angels write down that book of remembrance praise god so when you give or when someone when you do something nobody else saw it you could say well i know jesus saw it and i know he wrote it down amen when i witnessed that person when i prayed for that person and nobody else saw i know he saw it because when i was talking about him when i was thinking about him but the heaven recorded it praise god that's malachi 3 16 if that was under the blood of bulls and goats what's he doing under the blood of christ right remember church the bible said we have better can we say better you said all nice and better we have better promises that if that was a a great promise we've got a better one praise god amen we're got a better covenant with better promises amen hallelujah that's why brother ram the holy spirit told him a huge portion of heaven awaits you i remember he he admitted it one time i think it was december 26 1963 church order sermon they asked brother brown how do we handle poor people that come in brother bam said just you got to ask him and make sure you got to ask and make sure they're not lying to you but he says he said you can go look at the books he kind of lets this slip out he said you can look at the books down there at the church i've given away 20 000 just to anybody that would ask that those are probably his ties right probably his ties twenty thousand and he said he said the minister would tell me his name said he needs a new set of tires i just gave it to him he said but then i go search in the in the directory and i call the church and no there's no preacher by that name there but the holy spirit said there's a huge portion awaiting you in heaven amen praise god amen see the jesus said you got to let yourself be defrauded sometimes right you pray for those who despitefully use you praise god and a huge portion awaits that man because remember church it is not how much you give it is not how big your church is thank god for that it is the widow woman proved it when she gave him two mites two-fifths of a penny jesus said she gave more than all the hundreds or thousands of dollars of the pharisees it's the amount of what you have that's what counts in the sight of god amen it's not how much you give as far as compared to that brother or that sister or that millionaire it's how much percentage did you give of what you had amen oh that's how you get a huge abortion in heaven brother brown was no millionaire hallelujah but he gave a huge portion of what he had in church we can do the same and expect the same blessings hallelujah jesus christ said that himself she gave more than what they did oh to me church that brings down the mountains and that raised up the valley brother amen that puts us on an equal role that puts us on an equal playing field praise god think about that by by love and grace we can out give the millionaire we can out give bill gates gives 2 billion whatever to education that's a small chunk change of what he's got but if we give more of our income which one will be greater sight of god those who gave a larger percentage oh why may god help us to store up treasures in heaven hallelujah glory that was going to be a whole separate sermon but i guess i have to save that one for later i was going to add that onto my sermon i preached with the 100 fold 60 fold 30 fold from a few weeks ago i was going to add that on there i was going to add this on there too sisters can get a hundred-fold because they are married to the preacher right if the apostle gets a hundred fold jesus said that to peter that means peter's wife gets the same reward because the bible says in peter p first peter 3 that husbands and wives are joint heirs of the grace of life so i was wrong on that one i excluded all the sisters but see how the holy spirit corrects me i thank the lord for that praise god yeah the the missionaries wives get a hundred fold so i think occasion i think acacia brought that to my attention so god bless you acacia see that's that that's that good discernment of the holy spirit right there thank you hon maybe that was a word of knowledge hallelujah praise hey i'm thankful we got the gifts of the holy spirit here we just got to wait for god's timing and we've got to be conscious but they're here they're in our lives the bible said the gifts are given to every man to profit with all each one of you have a gift now let's be dedicated let's see what god does amen oh hallelujah well i'm off my notes a little bit but praise the lord i'm on god's notes though that's right i left my notes i went to god's notes so notice here from joshua fourth i'm still trying to get through verses one to two this is how it was like with that philippians series yeah the prophet priests and heads of the fathers of the tribes made distribution of the land so there's three groups making distribution right three groups work together prophet priests and elders did you notice that now that three team that three group team was god's way then it's still that way today right and this may help us in the future too as far as with placing us in our spiritual land now don't get me wrong god could come down and tell you you have this gift you have that do that ministry that ministry that's true that could happen but remember paul laid his hands on timothy and said don't forget the prophecy that went before you with the hands of the presbyters right so what i'm saying is that god always uses a prophet priests and elders to give people insight about the land they're supposed to possess glory we saw that with moses and air now moses type of christ right aaron a type of the priesthood aaron and four sons make the fivefold ministry what a beautiful perfect type praise god the fivefold ministry goes into the holy place goes in the holiest of holies right and ministers for the people praise god right but now we know i just said we're all kings and priests amen we can all go behind the veil praise god back the bale's red praise god i need your bills read we can all go into the ark of the covenant the prince of god if we want to amen amen glory of hell's thorn hallelujah so first at moses and aaron prophet priest joshua eleazar prophet priest nathan and zadok in the days of david who anointed solomon nathan and zadok prophet priests they had to have both there plus the elders they had them there i just read it yesterday first kings one they had them there amen and then we have haggai and joshua i didn't study far enough to find the elders on that one but and then jeremiah and zephaniah god always has these now church this is important because for us brother branham's not here but we got his word stored and we can listen to those words amen and we know what he would have said if he was here because he said it while he was here right just just different people same truth same teaching just different people praise god but all but they're all bought by the blood of jesus now notice the prophet provided listen current divine communication that's what the prophet was for to give you something current that god could speak to you right there brother man told us about russia thus saith the lord the purple curtain thus saith the lord right i mean he told us the one i was thinking about was the woman with the high heels on the three works of grace he said you can't walk that wearing those high heels she's like i'll tell you i can do whatever i want to do that shows you've got the dominating spirit on her and she fell off in sanctification and all these message churches with these sisters with these high heels on they think they're born again impossible because that's what the vision said from god's divine communication hallelujah praise god exalting themselves up like that to be seen what are they trying to exalt themselves up for the bible says god god humbles those that exalt themselves amen the bible said humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he'll exalt you amen somebody asked me a few weeks ago on the email said how high should the heel go i said as low as you can go as long as you can go i mean what do you think what do you want me to say like three three millimeters or what i mean what do you want to say as low as you can go don't exalt yourself right humble yourself even i got even i got rid of my i had some high heel shoes it was i didn't know better i just the shoes they were really narrow shoes my wife showed me don't wear narrow shoes i wonder why my feet were hurting all those years because my my toes were all squeezed in there and then i had a huge thick heel i'm like why did i buy these that's right because they were at target and they're on sale that's why i bought them fool i'm not a fool but i felt like a fool afterwards my feet hurt so bad but uh see i understand no limits and things like that but the wisdom of god should teach you if god sends divine communication and shows a woman in heels falls off a sanctification then i'll do everything i can to convince my family and my daughters and my church don't even wear them praise god you're going to fall off because that's divine communication for our day hallelujah well you can take a chance if you want but it's between you and god but i've got prophet proof to prove that i've got divine communication praise god with thus saith the lord i think that was brother brahman's mom that had that prayer all right i'm sorry they had that dream that's right my man's mom had that dream brother man said look that's just my message exactly three steps justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost now the priest church provided faithful teaching of god's past and preserved communication so prophet was divine current things and of course the prophet would interpret the word too but the priest had to be under the anointing to keep the preserved word to teach the preserved word that everybody knew the priests had to remind them of the word and then the elders had all the wisdom from experience of living 40 50 60 70 years 80 90 100 those days 120 150 whatever so you had wisdom of the ancients right of the elders you had divine communication i saw a vision i saw a dream though the holy spirit spoke they'll say the word of me and you had the man who just studied the word all the time to make sure they all agree praise god hallelujah now they are also recognized in jeremiah's day jeremiah 18 18. come let us devise devices against jeremiah this is this is the church in that can you imagine a church in that day against us come let's devise something against bride of christ fellowship that's what the devils do right but jeremiah had the physical people right devising things against him the preachers and prophets for the law shall not perish from the priest nor counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophet come let us smite him with the tongue let us not give heed to any of his words that's what they want to do they want to just all forget about brother branham well you know i'll do the i'll do the water baptism thing but i don't want to hear all that stuff about sanctification i don't want to hear all that other stuff no we need all of it praise god we need the prophet the priesthood and we need the elders amen amen see but sin always would get in after a while right maybe the next second generation third generation in the under the old testament of course also in the church ages and the bible said they've aired through wine and strong drink they're out of the way the priest and the prophet aired through strong drink they're swallowed up a wine they're out of the way through strong drink they air in vision they stumble in judgment see so false prophets they just can't see as clearly they can't hear us clearly and teachers you know they stumble they make you stumble by their teachings and this is how god gives people their inheritance on earth prophet priest elders hallelujah now was in the new testament as well you better believe us new testament and church i thought we're supposed to go back to the faith of the fathers right how do we want to go back to the faith of the fathers we're really close amen we are really really close praise god we need some more power need some more prayer but we're really close praise god amen i believe that's all my heart we're really really close praise god we're growing in it week after week month after month year after year oh can't you see the bright light shine amen it's just getting brighter the more we approach the coming of the lord amen hallelujah absolutely right amen so paul barnabas no small dissension about this circumcision mandate now we've got a vaccine mandate but that's not in the church well it's probably going to come to the churches mercy they determine paul and barnabas and certain of them should go up to jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question oh so paul's a prophet barnabas was a prophet the prophets and elders come together hallelujah praise god and they figure out the situation see church you know in our life it might look like this you know as a preacher i'm not a prophet so if there's a problem in the church you bring your problem to me i'll pray about it i'll seek the word then i'll go ask the prophet i ask brother i look to his tapes right i can't talk to a dead person right but i asked the holy spirit lord direct me in the prophet's message that would help somebody right and then i might reach out to a local elder or someone in the church that's the elder or someone in another church that's the elder to try to get wisdom have you ever handled this before the church has happened numerous times numerous times and these three go together to make a very powerful team for jesus we got the prophet the priests and the elders you've got an invincible army hallelujah praise god so much so that peter tried to step right peter got the wrong idea so what god did he sent a prophet in there paul and then they all agree with paul right peter repents get out the segregation get that all out that's what we need today we need we need men and women anointed by the holy ghost today that know what they're called to do that know that they have a spiritual office to fulfill and they're going to be faithful with that office brother ram taught the same unity of the prophet and the bride church revelation 22 17 the spirit and the bride say come let's all say come ready come see it proves you're the bride you're saying come that's what the holy spirit's saying come to the message that's what i'm saying that's what i'm telling my friends in the churches come to the mystery of god it's finished praise god there's no more questions praise god it's finished we know god's plan we know what was written in heaven we know what the symbols represent and now we're flying with eagle anointing praise god and we will fly out of here before that pale horse rider rides across america amen hallelujah praise god we'll fly out of here amen and meet our savior in the air papa eagle amen hallelujah we're saying come and all that the father has given me all my little baby eagles will come to me oh thank god amen whosoever will i don't care what the church is one of these weeks i'm going to a catholic church brother i'm going to sit in that church and i'm going to sit there and pray for those people i don't care presbyterian i'm going lord willing jehovah's witness mormon i'll do whatever i've got to do seven-day menace i'm not afraid of them i fear god more than i fear them amen and they did somebody deserves a chance at least to hear it and church listen i'm going to the pastor so they're the watchman right if the watchmen don't warn the people who's who's who uh who's the punishment on the watchman's hands right that's just what paul did too now just so you know that pastor today he asked me before he preached he come up give me a hug he said man you made me cry i haven't seen you for years i said praise the lord pastor paul he said do you want to speak and say something to the church and i was like for that split second i was like [Music] i better not like i knew i had to leave pretty soon but i'm hoping lord willing in the future i'll be able to find the leader more courage of the holy spirit to preach basically revelation 10 7. but then later he did bring me the mic or his son brought me the mic afterwards and i just said a blessing over the church i just said follow your pastor he'll be if he's got the holy spirit he'll be guided to all truth and that's true for sanctification right that's true if he's really got the spirit for saying vacation they'll he'll lead him into all truth but see i'm pointing them apostolic to their pastor i'm not a prosthetic right what's something that's kind of clever with that i'm not a proselyte i'm a paulite that's the best i could do so forgive me paul went in the synagogues every sabbath and he's the bible said he sat down and right this morning he just sat down and waited for somebody to come up and that's what i did i sat down and they just brought me the mic and i was just going to keep waiting to do that by the grace of god because we have been given this great invitation amen to invite them and say come and drink of the waters of life freely amen don't you want someone to drink of the water you drink of if you drink the right water you do if you drink the wrong water no wonder you don't want people to drink of that ah but i'm drinking fresh water there's no wiggle tails in it it's fresh it's life-giving and sometimes it bubbles over amen it's joy unspeakable full of glory amen i want everybody to drink it brother amen i i want everybody to taste to get a taste of this brother bang it's delicious it's life-giving amen it set me free and set the captive free they deserve a chance to drink it too thank god at this moment the age is not over see people in this message say the age is over they are so deceived he is yet crying and his cry is not only the spiritual ears of men by his spirit but once again a prophet is in the land now that's if that's joseph that was 1963 he was only about seven years old or eight years old that can't be joseph that was brother branham i've had people tell me this is joseph impossible he wasn't prophesying anything he wasn't preaching or praying for anybody this was brother branham how do you believe that right once more god will reveal the truth as he did to paul in the days of the seventh messenger the days of the liturgy and age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of god as revealed to paul see that makes me happy because i wrote a book about it right he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the benefit effect of that prophet's ministry oh thank god all the healings that came out of brother man's ministry all the power miracles we inherit those blessings today praise god he will speak out and those who receive that problem yes and they he they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride the last day who are mentioned in revelation 22 17. how many part of the bride today because i've heard the voice of the laodicean church age messenger i've hear i've heard the spirit cry through the word and now that makes me know i'm a bride member i'm not in the daughter harlot churches praise god i am a bride member i'm a word bride member praise god because i love the word and the mysteries of god are revealed to me thank god hallelujah the corn of wheat the bride wheat that fell into the ground at nicea has come back to original word grain again praise god forever yes listen to the authenticated prophet of god who appears in this last age what he says from god the bride will say the spirit and the prophet and the bride will be saying the same thing and what they will have say they will are it's already been said in the word hallelujah you never find just press play in this word and stop preaching and shut up and sit down you never find that praise god you don't find the rapture's already over in here praise god we're still in laodicea you don't find all these false teachings in here two souls you don't find two souls well i can divorce my first wife because that's under my my first soul now i can marry under my second soul because i got a new soul that's a bunch of tommy rot praise god you don't find that but what the bride says will already be in the word amen that again proves where the bride amen hallelujah like i put that challenge in the book 15 doctrines in chapter 14 brother 15 doctrines by paul that all the denominations reject but we keep them why because we're the bride because we keep every word that proceeds out of the mouth of god i'm waiting for my challenges i'm still waiting in church i'm still waiting for my challenges from the first book i ended that book by saying can someone prove i'm wrong on hair length can someone improve on makeup i'm still waiting for my challenges bro johnny i'm just waiting here just enjoying the presence of god just waiting still waiting for somebody to take me up on my challenge you know why because they can't challenge god amen you can't challenge god because we're standing on god's word amen hallelujah we got the answer to the devil's questions amen the answer is thus saith the lord amen glory i feel good this morning praise god hallelujah they're saying it now come out from among her now and be ye separate the cry's gone out the cry is is going out amen the cries going out how long will the voice cry we don't know but as long as brother jesse and the bride of christ fellowship are still living hey amen hallelujah praise god or as long as the next generation if i go off the scene whatever happens as long as there's a bride number here the voice is crying come back to the word come over my people come drink of waters of life and that's the bride talking oh my it's the bride talking when we speak and say come to church it's the bride's invitation imagine a woman dressed up in a bridesmail all in that white garment in all the veil and she comes up and say you're invited to the wedding that's the bride talking you got an invitation from the bride herself hey thank you lord amen the bride invited me and i'm in attendance amen and they might not have saw it today but when i walked in those two churches i was walking in there and all white bride member saying hey leave this note for the pastor if he wants to come to the wedding he can come to the wedding make sure he gets this wedding invitation hallelujah praise god make sure he gets it they might not have seen it brother amen but in there i was walking there as a white bride saying come come know that the mysteries of god are finished it's a privileged church it's a privilege to serve the lord jesus christ one thing we do know it won't be long for this is the last stage in every age we have exactly the same pattern this prophet priesthood elders that's why the light comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area god chose jeffersonville indiana or another or i should say like this god chose united states of america the most prosperous nation in the whole world to raise up a profit out of the nation that had the best technology the most freedom to copy books and translate and the greatest nation as far as those blessings god had chose a certain area because he knew he could get the word out faster from america see how wise he is that doesn't make us any special just makes us that's where we were that's god's predestination and from that messenger there spreads the light through the tape playing of others no ministries others who've been faithfully taught i know i'm hammering hard on jefferson i don't know why i'm doing that today i wasn't planning on doing that but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only with the messenger spoken when it comes to the word right because we can't say 1977 the world's going to end in 1977 we can't say that what he means you got to have wisdom is understand he means all that's in the word if you read the previous paragraph but see people can't do that when they're deceived of a devil right they can't catch that because they're deceived they just understand what they want to understand paul says it too and these things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men oh man who shall be able to teach others also give it to men give it to faithful men share the message with faithful men and then they can teach others that's the pattern i'm giving my revelation to one man one star in a special area and then that man will teach other men and that man will go teach other men and then god is like he's like that little wave in a puddle right a little rock and a puddle the wave goes out and the message spreads out and out and out so ever to the end of the waters praise god hallelujah church where one of those waves amen hallelujah brother brahms pebble dropped there and now we're one of those echoing waves we're taking it farther than he could go praise god that's god's plan amen i'm a part of that plan brother william i'm doing my part my little wave until the next wave and maybe one of these waves will be the wave of the last trump praise god the wave of of of death swallowed up in life amen the wave of the rapture praise god really come another wave over us amen hallelujah oh yeah i believe a one-man message that's what they all say brother the jeffersonville people oh one man message i know but then after the one man it goes to many men a one-man message means that's where it starts not where it finishes they're saying it just finishes did you know jeffersonville put out here i am on this again they put out a website or they put a blog post last week that said brother branham all the fivefold ministries in brother branham there's no need no there's no need to go anywhere else or listen to anybody else they said he's our prophet pastor and they use all these quotes but they forgot to use the quote where brother brahm said i won't always be your pastor and they forgot to use this quote brother they asked him are you the only one that should preach and he said no he said we need more preachers he said i'm just one little pebble on the beach among many big stones i don't know who those big stones are i think brother bam is one of those big stones i think he's being humble that's my opinion i'm one of those little stones where's god right other churches they're little stones but see they like they take the quotes they what and they just ignore the ones they don't but we take them all praise god rightly divide them by the holy spirit that's exactly right see it starts as a one-man message but then it becomes a many-man message because men jesus said you go and you pray to all nations amen you go make disciples of every nation hallelujah it starts with one then it spreads to others and that's thus saith the word so you know it's right how many believe that's right now birth pains by talking about bringing the message back to the people and i'm just going to i'm going to skip a little this he's talking about how there's there's basically two vines there's two systems there's the the system of promise and there's a system of man-made ability right jacob and esau right he talks about how luther was the right with jacob but then all the people that denominated after him were like the esau group right in other words brother man talks about two vines right the good seed and the bad seed and then brother i was trying to explain this and he said these men if they pick this up and go out with it can make more sense to it see them bring it to a place you would i just want to lay the seed and then they hope they make it come to life brother is talking about preachers he's hoping that the seeds he's planted in the message will grow and the preachers will be able to study more preach more faithfully learn those and go take it and go finish the great commission that's what's happening today i'm happy to announce that there's life in the world today and we are living on that life amen hallelujah it's there for anybody who wants it got your bible got your church age book seal book got some of my books got a lot of good books out there they're gonna it's brought more to life praise god like i always told everybody that church age book is the greatest book i've ever read outside the bible i know people that say they don't like it well i think it's their loss it's just their loss that that book has had so many truths it's changed my life it's taught me how to better serve it's taught me the history of the church it's taught me all the qualifications from preachers and because i've kept some of those qualifications from preachers it's kept people out of this pulpit that shouldn't be should not have been here so that's why i thank the lord for that book too it's protected us more wisdom more insight and it also gave us the vision of our church the latter rain right where we will be full of wine full of corn and my people shall never be ashamed my people will rejoice and be glad praise god for all that god has done we'll have the wine the new one the former rain the latter raid will be the real army of god jesus once amen amen we got thus saith the lord in other words thank you lord thank you jesus praise god i'm time to read all that you can you can i can jose always likes the the sermon notes so i can i can email it to you with three taps after service if you want now in taking sides with jesus i preached this a year ago when i preached on the book of philippians brother brahm names all the preachers and said god anoints you young man he said you know the message you studied it he said if time rolls on we're going to walk off the scene and after a while you've got to fill our shoes not you might want to press play or my uh you might just want to sit at home and play tapes right not that no you got to fill our shoes and he said remember don't change one thing about this message don't change one thing about the fivefold ministry praise god let the pastors keep feeding the sheep week after week i'm glad i can dish out a healthy meal to each one of you every sunday praise god here's a healthy meal enjoy here's a healthy meal enjoy that but then you enjoy your meal enjoy i just sit back oh thank the lord thank you lord for giving me that mood that food that was so good for the people but god also needs advantages to come in here and preach and stir you up and preach against your sins right and help you to confess and come in prayer lines amen and get set free and encourage and stir up your faith amen we don't have many prophets but thank god for the prophet of god we have missionaries coming here that go out to travel to lands not so much recently other than brother maxwell lee that went on the picture out there but we support them i sent them 300 last month to go do missionary work in brazil where there's no roads oh but god's got a road out there there's no roads for the the cars but there's roads where the angels have made roads for the missionaries where they're receiving the message in brazil praise god those people out in the bush they're getting the holy ghost they're being buried in the name of jesus christ i'm glad to support missionaries like that and teachers like brother simon that can go down deep in the word and bring things out like the breach we've never heard before wasn't that beautiful that was tremendous that was beautiful god lord let them fill our shoes if time goes on now i'm trying to get to here we go now i'm finally done with verses one and two okay see that's that's the hard part about preaching every verse in the bible you know because it's eternal and so all these thoughts start breaking out right in this verse well i want to move on but it's kind of like i feel like i'm like a racehorse and they're like pull me back you know i want to i want to move on through the text but here we are give me a few more minutes by god's grace i'm just happy to be a christian today praise god verse three for moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and a half on the other side of jordan but unto levites he gave none inheritance among them now church this is there's some beautiful type in here maybe i don't have it you know fully but the levitical priesthood was denied physical property but instead inherited god's spiritual properties can you imagine that if you're a levite all those other brothers got to have lands hills mountains valleys ponds whatever but you just had like a little house in a city and you couldn't go for a walk on your land i like to have 100 acres wish i had 100 acres like brother caleb he probably had about 100 acres but the levites they were denied that the bible said the levites i'm going to separate you levites you priesthood i'm going to separate you away from land i don't want you focused on land aren't you focused on my house deuteronomy 18 says the priest the levites in the tribe believe i shall have no part nor inheritance with israel they shall eat the offerings of the lord made by fire and his inheritance what a special blessing therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren the lord is their inheritance as he has said unto them so throughout the week you know the levites would watch everybody else oh they go out for a vacation out on their land they cut down trees they build nice fences they say well i'll just stay in my hut and i'll just take care of my family here and but the but the bible said the lord said i'm gonna i'm gonna give you an inheritance i'm not gonna give you lands i'm not gonna give you hills or valleys i'm going to give you my food i'm going to give you fellowship with me which one would you rather have church mountains valleys hills or would you rather have fellowship and eat with the king hallelujah amen i'm all for a little bit of land but if i have the choice land or jesus it ain't even choice i'm taking jesus praise god that's fine lord i may not have means in here i mean i have lots of acres here i may not have cars and lands here or businesses here but one thing i've got i've got the king's food i'm sitting at the king's table amen i'm feasting with the king oh thank you jesus you're a special group you don't get lands but you get to eat with me every week that's what that sister said with that card no that was the email she said thank you for writing that book i finally know what the shoe bread represents the mysteries the food that we feast on before we go into the baptism of the holy ghost the lord is jehovah's mind inheritance oh what'd you inherit oh i i got some streams i got some wells oh they just gush out with water that's beautiful i got some mountain views oh you got to come check out this mountain view i got it's got a lookout there's a big stone there and just oh i can see everything in the valley where did you get levite i just got the candlesticks you know and the light of the candlesticks like i got some shoe bread once a year i get to go into jehovah's presence don't feel sorry for me praise god i get to go into the eternal line amen enjoy your sunshine your sunsets your sunrises enjoy that but i'm going to enjoy the shaking light amen if that's all i get for the amen thank god that jehovah is my inheritance thank you jesus if that's all i get i'll be happy about that don't get me wrong i admire smart men that can make a lot of money i admire that it's something i don't have but if all i get is feasting with jesus being in his presence having his fellowship that's enough for me i'm going to be jealous of those guys i'm gonna be joseph jack dorsey and bill gates and i'm gonna be just uh jeff bezos i can be just them because i got something they don't know nothing about i've got peace i've got love i've got victory i've got holiness praise god i got the fear of the lord amen there's my hour i'm going to try to close here brother baby said how the congregation used to admire that high priest see church after a while the land didn't really mean much anymore right because brother they would set up idols on the land they'd bow down they'd build they plant groves and they sneak into the groves at night and they you know they sacrifice to the devils pretty soon they were just a lot of the israelites were backslid so what good is the land to them anyway brother ram said as time went on that high priest aaron and he said all the congregation admired that man he got the bells on everything's all set he'd get the incense and he leave that out oh i'm sorry he leave that he did the outer core right you take the blood in there with the in the in the charger brother said he passed beyond the veil and they all admire they all want to peek inside can you imagine all the children leaning over what's behind that veil i want to see the candlestick oh it's closed how the congregation admired that man see church when you live in the presence of god people admire you hallelujah because you're under the prince of god all the time they wish they could have the character that you have they wish they could have the peace that you have the victory that you have the strength that you have the courage that you have the power that you have they long they admire that that god help us to live under the anointing and live in the presence of christ they'll admire you church when you live in god's presence that's fine if i don't have millions i just want to be somebody that other people can admire and say that man lives close to god he's got a heart like jesus i see a lot of people that go to church but there's something about that brother he's he's different i admire how he just he stays under the anointing of the holy spirit how many want to live that kind of a life i love this this is beautiful praise god see we should rejoice church we get personal fellowship with christ it's only limited to a certain few few there be that find this the baptism the holy ghost we're talking about land physical things all these things don't mean nothing the preacher at the chapel this morning was saying uh he was sitting across the table from his friend he was a ceo he had gained millions of dollars he said he had all the cars he had all the houses all the clothes can you imagine that brother bang millionaire ceo and the the preacher was honest he's like wow how do i get there tell me your secret how you get there because you know he was just battling the flesh hopefully hopefully overcame but he said he let this man talk and he was ready to ask him how can i do that how can i get millions and the man said here i am old retired now he said what was it all for it was just a big waste what was that all for anyway can you imagine having millions of dollars getting whatever you want and you still and then you look back at the end of your life then your life would say what was all that about anyway can you imagine getting ready to go down to the grave and you didn't even know what your life was for church we are so blessed we can know what our lives are for our lives are to minister to people praise god our lives are to do the will of jesus christ not to serve ourselves but to serve others amen and we can go to the end of our lives and know i did exactly what jesus called me to do as a father i did this this like the bible said as a mother i did this this this i did this and this and this as a worker i did exactly what the bible said to me and i can't wait to see jesus he's going to say well done i thought that was quite a testimony what was it all for what are all these trials for they're to get a bride ready amen you might not seen it bro but amen but over the years god has been dressing you he's been dressing me brother bang he's been dressing us in the garments of a bride he's given us white garment saints he's washing away anything that displeases him he's just making our garments white because the bible said jesus washes us by the washing of the water of the word laundry day after laundry day brother william how many moms know what i'm talking about i know my wife will say man we got a pile here we got like all these piles because we got a big family that's what jesus bride is doing the laundry's getting washed all everything's getting ready getting dressed making sure everything's pressed and looking good she's getting ready for her wedding day praise god i hear you because she's going to be presented without spot without wrinkle and without blemish amen by the blood of the husband jesus these worldly things don't bring any happiness the happiest i am is like on set last saturday night when we have six people come up for prayer and i'm weeping and crying and saying god help bless them i can't think of any happier time in my life can you you know that's the happiest time i love my children i love my family too but i don't understand what i'm saying when god is moving and helping people convicting people strengthening people that ought to make us the happiest people on the face of the earth but if we're living selfishly we'll wonder what is all this for why did god give me this job so you can support a ministry right that's why god gave you a job so you can feed those children and train them up in the things of god you can sharpen those arrows i went to a group yesterday there's some message believers there you'd be surprised by how many people made fun of me because i'd eight kids message believers make fun of me and joke with me because i got eight kids and each time i just said we're so thankful for all of them i'm just sharpening them up and i said i'm getting ready to send my first 116. i'm getting ready to send her out to meet the enemy at the gates when she's 18. hallelujah and they just all of a sudden it kind of you know shakes him up cause i'm not i'm not ashamed of my arrows i'm thankful for my arrows i'm glad my quiver's not empty i'm glad it's full i don't know that way i can do something for god satan's the one who has a bow but no arrows amen but we the bride of christ have a bow and arrows amen plus we got a sword and a shield and the of god thank god we're soldiers for jesus amen but they can mock me and laugh all they want that's fine they did the same to jesus that don't hurt my feelings i know what i got i got some sharp arrows thank the lord like that man asked me he's in masculine he asked me every week he's like what do you do to your children i said well they got their mom at home she's the fifth gospel right i didn't get the amens on that my wife's the fifth gospel there we go there's some amendments and then they got their dad chopping with that sword three times a week at him slice it and try three times a week you probably get some pretty good kids after that as long as you live the life at home right keep keep all the sin out of your house i said give all credit to the holy spirit so give all the credit to the wife my wife who's led by the holy spirit amen now brother brother man says when you go in the holy spirit of holies he says you're hid away and your whole motive is to serve jesus christ i'm here to do what jesus christ wants me to do i will only be moved by him brother william amen because he's my general right he's the one i report to sir in prayer every day help me lord he's who i report to the holy spirit is being born again that's the place where god reveals his secret things that's the place where god does the placing and the calling see church if we're really born again we're going to fight some battles as chapter as verse 1 showed but after a while after a lot of victories then you've got to be placed you've got to know your position in christ we need to know that and i'm going to be getting into more into that just very simple as i preached before but hopefully go a little bit deeper by the grace of god show the different varieties of sisters right the different ministry sister can have the different ministries brothers can have verses six to eight is that right okay 40 years old was i when moses servant of the lord sent me from kadesh barney a despis okay now we're on caleb spout the land and i brought him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord now look church god honors the words of his prophet here moses had died 45 years maybe earlier later and caleb still remembers thus saith the lord from the prophet oh i'm gonna that's me that's gonna be you praise god we're never gonna forget thus saith the lord to the bride from the prophet and here he's saying i'm 85 now i remember what moses said it was thus saith the lord see those who holy father lord they speak words of faith from their obedient hearts see that's why people can't speak the word they're not obeying the lord all the time we've got to obey the lord all the time and then we'll speak he said it jesus said if you abide in me and i abide in you he said then ask what you will so caleb was a bidding in the holy spirit remember he was justified sanctified you know never could never get the holy ghost because the jesus had not yet been crucified he's a sanctified believer who wholly followed the lord under the blood of bulls and goats verses 9 and 10 nine is the highlight moses and moses swear on that day saying surely this land where on thy feet of trial and shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou is holy father the lord my god remember church moses promised caleb he could have the land he spied out because of his obedience did you catch that caleb just wasn't one in any mountain caleb had been to that mountain before 45 years earlier hallelujah moses moses said you can have the land that you spied out little did caleb know he's gonna have to wait 45 years to get it but he still remembers see caleb's like mary he heard that word of moses and he kept that word down in his heart he pondered it he waited on the lord and he didn't get older he got strong he stayed just as strong praise god i shouldn't say stronger because he got the same strength he kept his strength all those 45 years and he said i want the land that i spied out 45 years ago that everybody was afraid of in other words i knew 45 years ago i could conquer that land but i had to wait till the rest of the church caught up with me and the church said is that right nobody else in the church except joshua believed it he said i've got to wait for the next generation to raise up my i got to wait till they can catch up with my revelation because i know we can do all things through christ who strengthens us the man said joshua and caleb we're looking at what god said they were looking at grasshoppers and giants but caleb and joshua were not looking at the giants they were looking at the unseen brother said they were looking it depends what you're looking at we must look at what god said look what god says about your problems look what god says about the giants in your life if we focus on that we'll be just like caleb one day we'll overcome that it may not be today but if we've got faith and we wholly follow the word of god we will overcome we will conquer and we will possess the land god kept him strong in order to fulfill moses's word god's going to keep somebody strong in order to be raptured by the william praise god god is going to keep somebody strong jesus said shall i find faith on the earth of course i'll find him the bride he's going to keep somebody full of faith on the earth until he comes let it be you let it be me praise god let it be me the one that i keep my fire and zeal brother amen you make sure brother for the van you if anybody would know would be brother banging my wife make sure i keep my zeal all the years as these years cycle in and out brother banging we start getting older and our teeth starts getting crooked like right here we start getting gray hairs as these cycles go through let's make sure we keep our strength and we keep our zeal and we're just as strong now as in 2001 or 2002 when we first heard this glorious message that god has given to us be unmovable be steadfast always abounding in the king slaying demon slang of the lord can i say it like that hallelujah so caleb was asking permission to drive out the giants the older generations feared yeah those giants the other guys were scared of i'll take those on who wants to take out those giants that they were scared of that's me i'll do it give it to me give me this mountain right bring on that denominational spirit hallelujah bring on that government squeeze who will take down these giants that everybody else is scared of somebody in here i believe will rise up and say give me my mountain amen give me the promises of god for me other people might have been scared but i'm not scared i've got the word of the lord i'm not looking at what i see i'm looking at the unseen remember anakins were giants the bible said they saw the giants the son of anak and caleb says i want the land of the anakins with the giants i'm with the rapture the other brothers didn't live to it the other brothers didn't live to the rapture but i want the rapture amen they didn't know how it could happen oh my god may god help us praise god they started denominations they died they they uh cold they went to seed the older generation missed the rapture but we can do it our bodies can be changed not by not by power not by might but by the holy ghost saith the lord how many believe that i'm trying to get a little farther because i wasn't going so slow so let me close to this yesterday we had some good fellowship oh yeah brother richard sanchez church caleb waited 45 years to get that promise how many know 45 is bigger than 25. anybody ever everybody understand that abraham waited 25 years to get his promise done caleb waited 45 years to get his promised land well what's the difference 25 what's the difference it's still a long time right but it don't matter as long as you've got the same kind of faith as abraham if you can wait 25 years church i just reckon you could wait 26. praise god if you can wait 45 years brother bang i just assume you can wait 46 years or 50 years because it's not about the time it's about the faith amen the time's not what in question it's the faith that's in question and church we have no faith of our own our faith is the faith of christ amen paul said i don't live by my faith he said but i live by the faith of the son of god amen i'm not believing with my faith i'm believing with jesus faith so the brother walked up to me yesterday and he said i was sharing about praying for people to be saved i was hearing about going out to churches and he said brother jeff i just want to encourage you keep praying he said my brother bill witnessed to our sister so he has a brother in the church and the sister who was in the church he said 45 years ago when we first heard the message he said we went to her we argue with her we slammed water baptism down her throat and said you better get saved the rapture is coming and she flatly turned them down he admitted they kind of did the wrong way he said but 45 years later last year during covid they came up to visit and stayed at their house and he said they were just in the kitchen hanging out now they're in their 60s late 60s if not 70s and he said he was over there cooking a meal for his sister i guess i said all of a sudden she starts talking about god and he said he said he shared a few things about just general things about god i'm here to pray for you he said he saw her crying so he said he walked over after 45 years he talked to his sister and said you know sister you need to come to god you need to repent and get right with god she said you're right i need to i'm finally ready to repent and he said uh there was there they went home they and you know kazukovic they come back and he said both he and his brother got to take her down into the waters of baptism and finally after 45 years bury her in the name of the lord jesus christ and now she's serving god now after 45 years of waiting on god and i thought that's exactly how long caleb waited so i knew it was inspired because in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established let's stand to our feet i'm sorry 35 years i'm sorry 35 yeah i'm sorry not 45 35. my fault 35 years later the faith was still strong it just had to wait and that's what the brother said it wasn't the season 35 years ago it wasn't the season for a giver she wasn't broken enough she wasn't low enough right sometimes the prodigal has to go down to the pig pen she'd just reach her pig pen in 2020 the year of coronavirus the chinese-made virus go ahead close it out you turn it off i might say some things here they're gonna hunt me down maybe anyway we'll see
