[1:00] and uh it's real good to be in the house
[1:02] of the Lord here
[1:05] today you know uh as before we're
[1:09] getting there you know I thought by now
[1:10] you know there might be some chicanery
[1:12] going on because the election so I'm
[1:13] sure you saw the debate last night and
[1:16] um well maybe you didn't hope maybe you
[1:18] didn't that's fine if you
[1:19] didn't um anyways um you know I thought
[1:24] you know as we headed into this year I
[1:25] thought there might be some more things
[1:26] like Co or something like that but you
[1:28] know so far thank God you know we
[1:30] haven't had to deal with things like
[1:31] that you know by the grace of God let's
[1:33] keep praying because there's power in
[1:34] prayer you know there's no demon that
[1:36] can stand before Jesus right we know
[1:39] that then we also know God has to allow
[1:41] things to get set up for the One World
[1:42] Government and so forth but we just
[1:44] don't know the day or the hour but I
[1:46] just reminded of that that God has been
[1:47] gracious so far you God and he's always
[1:49] gracious don't get me wrong he's always
[1:50] gracious but just specifically to the
[1:52] prayers for this year he's been very
[1:54] gracious so I want to thank the Lord for
[1:56] that that he is uh so gracious and
[1:58] merciful Hallelujah so 1 Thessalonians
[2:01] 4:16 And1 17 and then after this
[2:04] occasion we'll switch over but we can
[2:05] read this so I want to look at a little
[2:07] more like I didn't get to some of the
[2:08] things on Sunday so I'm just picking up

[2:14] topic of the Rapture mystery
[2:17] here all right so let's read this on
[2:19] three if we can on three one two three
[2:22] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[2:25] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[2:28] the Archangel and with the Trump of God
[2:31] and the dead in Christ shall rise first
[2:35] then we which are alive and remain shall
[2:38] be caught up together with them in the
[2:41] clouds to meet the Lord in the air and
[2:44] so shall we ever be with the Lord let's
[2:47] have one more word of prayer Lord we

[3:56] Saints said amen God God bless you as
[3:58] you're being seated there praise God
[4:02] all right so we want to uh I got some
[4:03] slides here and hopefully these show up
[4:05] this
[4:09] time see see how long we'll go tonight I
[4:12] think I went 45 maybe last month or last
[4:14] week kind of see how it
[4:21] goes so we're looking at part three here
[4:23] we're going to pick up right where we
[4:24] left off that's the wrong text that's
[4:25] the one slide I didn't update there but
[4:27] I want to pick up right where I left off
[4:29] uh brother says unbelief does not hinder
[4:31] God of course we know the Bible teaches
[4:33] that brother Ram just said it in his own
[4:34] way his modern way to say it uh no man
[4:37] remember Paul said that in Romans nine
[4:39] no man can resist God's will right if
[4:42] God wants to do something nobody can
[4:43] resist him no one's unbelief can do it
[4:46] you know no one's no one's anger can do
[4:48] it no one's unrepentent heart can stop
[4:49] God God does what he wants praise God
[4:52] now uh we read this but I want to read
[4:54] this again uh uh the church is going to
[4:56] be there without spot or wrinkle and the
[4:58] church said
[5:00] no spots no wrinkles Hallelujah that's
[5:02] what the Bible says hallelujah the grace
[5:04] of God will do that it'll have to it'll
[5:07] take Grace like he talked to Abraham
[5:09] when Sarah doubt him well right then he
[5:11] could have slayed her but he would have
[5:12] slew Sarah right then for doubting but
[5:14] because that's the worst in there is is
[5:16] unbelief it's really the only sin so see
[5:18] because it's you disbelieve you then you
[5:20] have fruits of sin so unbelief is the
[5:22] root of all sin right unbelief if that's
[5:25] not kept in check or it's not cut off it
[5:26] will produce the fruit of adultery or
[5:28] the fruit of murder or the fruit of lie
[5:31] or something like that but ultimately
[5:32] the first part of that sin is unbelief
[5:35] we can see it plainly Hallelujah and she
[5:37] doubted and laughed within herself when
[5:38] the angel discerned her through the tent
[5:40] is that right but why couldn't she he
[5:42] take Sarah because she was part of
[5:44] Abraham he had to take Abraham too and
[5:47] we are part of Jesus when we're in the
[5:49] body of Christ Our unbelief are excused
[5:52] if we do it ignorantly like she did for
[5:55] she was scared amen so we all battle
[5:58] fear don't we right and we don't mean to
[6:01] be afraid right none of us enjoy being
[6:03] afraid do we none of us uh enjoy uh
[6:07] doubting what's go doubting the future
[6:09] right none of us enjoy that and the same
[6:11] thing with with Sarah you know because
[6:12] of fear she had a nervous laugh at God
[6:15] we'd say you know she just didn't know
[6:17] how it work out I mean how could it be
[6:18] possible how could I I'm n I'm 89 years
[6:20] old how could I ever have a baby she
[6:22] just was battling fear in the moment and
[6:24] laughed at it out of a nervous fear and
[6:27] but but God excused it because God
[6:29] already knew what was going to happen
[6:31] God knew he was going to discern her
[6:33] heart and then God knew because of that
[6:35] she'd receive strength and God knows
[6:37] Church the bride's going to receive
[6:39] strength hallelujah amen just like Sarah
[6:42] she had to receive strength to conceive
[6:44] and have a body change the same is true
[6:46] for this bride Hallelujah for the body
[6:48] change she's going to receive strength
[6:50] have a body change she's going to bring
[6:52] forth the Son of God hallelujah so he's
[6:55] going to manifest Jesus Christ amen and
[6:58] I wrote down here you know God help our
[7:00] unbelief just like he did Sarah Sarah
[7:02] laughed and lied to God yet God forgave
[7:05] it and God still changed her body amen
[7:09] Abraham laughed but God still changed
[7:11] his body Hallelujah Abraham lied right
[7:13] Abraham ran from the presence of the
[7:14] Lord hallelujah Thomas demanded a
[7:17] physical sign think about that you know
[7:19] uh you know God was so merciful he said
[7:21] if I'm not going to believe unless I can
[7:23] have a physical sign and God was so
[7:26] gracious he gave him a physical sign he
[7:28] showed up at at a at another time just
[7:31] to show Thomas this proves the love of
[7:34] God to me this proves God's love if
[7:36] somebody really wants to believe God's
[7:38] going to help them believe amen if
[7:41] somebody really wants to go in the
[7:42] Rapture if somebody really wants to be
[7:44] saved God's going to help them be saved
[7:46] amen God's going to help us be saved if
[7:50] even no matter what we need to believe
[7:52] if we want to believe God will help us
[7:54] just like this father with the
[7:56] demon-possessed child Hallelujah Jesus
[7:58] said to him if thou can't believe all
[8:01] things are possible to him that
[8:02] believeth now look Jesus puts it on him
[8:04] in other words Austin if you can believe
[8:06] all things are possible look at that see
[8:08] how God tests our faith sometimes if you
[8:10] can believe brother or sisters if you
[8:12] can believe Brothers if you can believe
[8:14] Jesus puts it on them but what's the
[8:16] honest answer for every person Lord I
[8:20] believe help my unbelief amen see even
[8:23] when God challenges you when he
[8:25] challenges you he wants you to say Lord
[8:26] I believe but you've got to help me do
[8:28] this amen
[8:30] I mean right God doesn't expect us to be
[8:32] perfect God's not asking us to be
[8:34] perfect God knows uh he pies us like
[8:36] children as we looked at a few weeks ago
[8:38] he remembers we're just dust but he's a
[8:40] loving father Hallelujah and because of
[8:43] his love he'll challenge us but then
[8:44] he'll be able to raise our faith
[8:46] Hallelujah then Jesus saw the people
[8:48] came running together he rebuked the
[8:50] foul Spirit saying unto him thou dumb
[8:53] and deaf spirit I charge you come out of
[8:54] him and enter no more into him that's
[8:57] what I share with each one of us we have
[8:59] authority
[9:00] to rebuke spirits and say you're not
[9:01] coming on me again right and I've seen
[9:04] in my life things wicked things I've
[9:07] done I've been able to speak to those
[9:09] and they've never come up back on me
[9:10] again amen hallelujah right that's right
[9:13] that's the power of God that we have
[9:15] amen we have the power of God I'll never
[9:17] do that again I'll never say that again
[9:18] I'll never do these things again that's
[9:20] what the power of the Holy Ghost gives
[9:22] you hallelujah amen and look all he did
[9:25] was say help me and Jesus said okay I'll
[9:28] help you amen CH if you can just say
[9:30] that tonight Jesus help me help me with
[9:32] this election or help me with this 2025
[9:35] or help me help me with the Rapture or
[9:37] help me with this relationship or help
[9:39] me financially whatever it is if you
[9:40] just ask Jesus to help you don't you
[9:42] think he's going to help you amen if he
[9:45] helped this man who had a child that was
[9:48] uh trying to throw itself in the fire
[9:50] and drown itself in the water if Jesus
[9:52] cared about this man's Faith no doubt he
[9:54] cares about your faith
[9:55] too and and then look he's just like
[9:58] everybody else he's like he needed help
[10:00] he's just like Abraham he's just like
[10:01] Thomas I'll say like this we all we're
[10:03] all doubting Thomases sometimes see
[10:06] that's why a real person doesn't they
[10:07] they don't degrade Thomas because we'd
[10:09] all do that if we weren't there we would
[10:11] have all done it praise God any man you
[10:14] know atin and I Malachi Malachi's almost
[10:17] a man you know any man you know we would
[10:19] have done the same thing most of us
[10:20] would have ran right if we would have
[10:21] get the threat of
[10:23] arrest only one of us out of 12 would
[10:25] have went there to the Cross like John
[10:27] did just because that's what all men do
[10:29] that's what all you know all women do
[10:30] you know we're just human we need God's
[10:33] help but God is so gracious if we ask
[10:35] for help he'll give us help hallelujah
[10:38] amen glory now here's what I didn't get
[10:40] to this word harpazo now now we're
[10:43] getting into the Rapture back to the
[10:44] Rapture so I'm picking up where I left
[10:46] off the word caught up uh in in the
[10:49] Greek means
[10:51] harpazo we're going to be
[10:53] harpazo that's not a word but I'm just
[10:55] adding Ed where we're going to be
[10:57] harpazo in the moment of a twink of an
[11:00] eye we're going to be seized and carried
[11:02] off in a moment twink of an eye Jesus is
[11:05] going to come by and just snatch away as
[11:07] said's just going to snatch away and
[11:09] seize his bride off the Earth with Force
[11:11] earn eagerly he's in other words he's
[11:14] excited to do it h he's excited to get
[11:16] married to his bride amen he had to
[11:18] divorce his other bride church are you
[11:20] with me he had to divorce the Israel
[11:22] bride he's excited he's eager he's
[11:25] looking forward to the wedding amen
[11:26] hallelujah he's been waiting 2,000 years
[11:28] for this WD wedding Hallelujah you had
[11:31] to wait a long time brother lustin to
[11:32] get married amen I had to wait uh five
[11:34] years you know we we he's been waiting
[11:37] 2,000 years he's eagerly going to snatch
[11:40] his bride away Hallelujah he's going to
[11:42] claim that's my bride amen church he
[11:45] ain't going to take the he going to take
[11:46] the Catholic church that's not his bride
[11:48] Luther Methodist Baptist you know
[11:50] Pentecostal that's not his bride his
[11:52] bride is those who have the oil
[11:55] Hallelujah the Blood Bought Holy Ghost
[11:57] filled bride that's his bride amen he's
[12:01] going to claim that's my bride brother
[12:03] said in the church age book the final
[12:05] proof of the seven Church age messenger
[12:07] is those who are raptured are going to
[12:09] follow his
[12:10] message brother says it God's going to
[12:13] prove that we're the bride amen when we
[12:15] disappear Hallelujah when we're CAU away
[12:18] Lord willing if it's in our lifetime now
[12:20] all the preachers have preached it
[12:21] Wesley preach it Luther preach it they
[12:23] all preach we're going to be raptured
[12:25] right they all preach it amen so I got
[12:26] to preach it too Hallelujah and if God
[12:29] allows it will be raptured if not it be
[12:30] the next Generation they'll keep
[12:31] preaching it someone's going to be
[12:33] raptured Hallelujah that's the final
[12:35] proof that God sent brother Ram is that
[12:37] the bride will be raptured out of here
[12:39] hallelujah because remember he's a
[12:41] forerunner to the second coming like
[12:43] John the Baptist was a forerunner to the
[12:45] first coming Hallelujah so to seize it
[12:47] means to pluck see you pluck something
[12:50] away you catch it away you pull it away
[12:52] you take it by force
[12:54] Hallelujah now there's 13 verses I'm
[12:56] going to go through these uh fairly
[12:58] quickly
[12:59] I just want you to see the context that
[13:01] they're used in only two of them now are
[13:03] for the Rapture but I want you to see
[13:05] the idea here that that we get from the
[13:07] Greek harpazo I've never heard a
[13:09] preacher preach on this I hope it' be a
[13:10] blessing to you the first time it's used
[13:12] is in Matthew 11:12 and from the days of
[13:15] John the Baptist until now the kingdom
[13:17] of violence or Heaven suffereth violence
[13:19] that means they were being persecuted
[13:21] right and the violent take it by force
[13:25] now here's a parallel passage to help
[13:26] you understand this is the same verse
[13:29] it's just written a different way by
[13:30] Luke he says the law and the prophets
[13:33] were until John since that time the
[13:35] kingdom of God is preached and every man
[13:38] presses into it okay so the violent take
[13:42] the kingdom by force all right so that
[13:45] that just means they press on to it and
[13:47] they take God's promise isn't that what
[13:49] you did when you heard water baptism
[13:50] what' you do you went over there and you
[13:52] got baptized brother Austin right is
[13:54] that what I know I saw sister Lena do it
[13:55] amen she took that baptism by force amen
[13:58] she believed amen I didn't have to beg
[14:00] her well sister why don't you come get
[14:02] baptized right each one of you you said
[14:04] I'm going to take that you took it by
[14:06] force that's what the Bible said you you
[14:08] you see the kingdom of God and you press
[14:10] into it amen no one's got to force you
[14:13] or beg you to come to church or beg you
[14:14] to pay ties or beg you to pay offerings
[14:16] or anything like that or beg you to read
[14:17] your Bible beg you you take it by force
[14:20] you seize the opportunity it's mine amen
[14:23] this is going to be my prop for a few
[14:25] Services here see and every man presses
[14:28] into now that press doesn't mean the
[14:30] same as take it by force but it's just
[14:32] another way to look at it every time
[14:34] God's word is preached the real
[14:36] believers they press into it they become
[14:38] a part of it
[14:40] hallelujah hallelujah
[14:43] Glory see but see now the kingdom of God
[14:46] you got to snatch promises away there's
[14:48] times God's going to reveal something to
[14:50] you and you just snatch it away how you
[14:52] just snatch it up Hallelujah like Austin
[14:54] like this with this with this song today
[14:56] see God gave him that and he has a
[14:57] choice he can either toss that aside
[14:59] side or he can snatch it up amen right
[15:02] that's the kingdom of God if God reveals
[15:04] something to you snatch it up it's yours
[15:06] believe it if God reveals you he's going
[15:08] to heal you snatch it up and believe it
[15:09] praise God to save you snatch that
[15:12] promise up see you got you have have to
[15:14] have a spiritual mind here snatch up the
[15:16] spiritual things of God that's what
[15:18] God's people do church we ought to
[15:20] snatch up the fear of God last Sunday
[15:22] night hallelujah amen you are to snatch
[15:24] it up and you are to live differently
[15:26] that's what the kingdom of God's about
[15:29] God presents a blessing God presents a
[15:31] promise you've got to snatch it up just
[15:33] like Jesus is going to snatch us up in
[15:35] the Rapture like I said if you eat the
[15:37] book if you swallow the book death will
[15:39] swallow up you in life Hallelujah I'm
[15:41] sorry life will swallow up the death
[15:43] inside of you sorry I got that mixed up
[15:44] there too excited got to slow down here
[15:47] all right here's the second time harpazo
[15:49] used now this is bad here this is for
[15:51] the uh this is for the Judas scar type
[15:54] but I think we can all understand this
[15:55] in a in a in a small way when anyone
[15:58] hears the word of the kingdom and
[16:00] understands it not then cometh the
[16:01] wicked one and he catches away there's
[16:03] the same harpazo he snatches it
[16:06] away that which was swn in his heart
[16:08] doesn't the devil do that you get a
[16:10] little Victory and he tries to snatch
[16:12] that right out of your life doesn't he
[16:13] Church any he honest people here tonight
[16:15] of course you
[16:16] are that see that's what he does one day
[16:19] you can be so up on the Mountaintop and
[16:21] he'll try to snatch it away we got to
[16:23] stop him from snatching that away got to
[16:25] say no devil get out of my house or get
[16:27] away from my door I rebuke you in Jesus
[16:29] name you're not snatching away my
[16:31] blessing amen see now that's what he
[16:34] does to the Judah escaros so Judas
[16:36] believed for a while the Bible said he
[16:37] did he believed for a while but then
[16:40] when he saw the temptation of money he
[16:42] let the devil snatch that belief out of
[16:44] his heart that's what the Bible says
[16:46] hallelujah so see Satan tries to imitate
[16:50] God but God does it the right way God's
[16:52] got the real harpazo amen that's right
[16:55] church amen now how many think about
[16:58] this how many people we saw fall away
[17:00] from the message because the devil
[17:02] harpazo the message out of their out of
[17:04] their hearts numerous many people so see
[17:08] it's a war church it's a war this ain't
[17:10] a playground Hallelujah I know I laugh a
[17:13] lot you know sometimes we laugh we have
[17:14] a good time and we're brother and
[17:15] sisters but this is a playground this is
[17:17] a real Battlefield Satan trying to
[17:19] snatch Faith out of people's hearts amen
[17:21] you got to defend the the faith
[17:24] Hallelujah Paul said you're in a good
[17:26] fight of Faith Hallelujah
[17:29] see he snatches it people I thought had
[17:31] the Holy Ghost for
[17:32] years right and the devil will come
[17:34] along he'll snatch that out of their
[17:36] life because he they let them Hallelujah
[17:39] everybody see that same word harpazo the
[17:42] Seas eagerly take it Satan once they
[17:44] eagerly take blessings out of our Lives
[17:47] can't let
[17:48] him now this is a physical one uh when
[17:51] Jesus perceived that they would come and
[17:53] take him by force to make him a king he
[17:55] depart again into Mountain himself alone
[17:57] so see the enemy was going the evil
[17:58] people the Pharisees were going to try
[18:00] to snatch him away now I like this one
[18:03] but he that is a hireling not the
[18:05] shepherd who own the Sheep are not seeth
[18:08] the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep
[18:10] and fleeth and the Wolf catches them and
[18:12] scatters the Sheep okay so now we see
[18:15] this is what wolves do wolves will go in
[18:18] and they'll they'll seize on a a sheep
[18:20] and carry it off right and then devour
[18:22] it just snatch it away eagerly I showed
[18:25] a video of it years ago at the other
[18:26] Church remember the ca knows probably
[18:28] scar her for life for that one but you
[18:30] know the that's what the the wolf would
[18:32] run around until he'd find one sheep get
[18:34] away from everybody and that's the one
[18:35] he would attack right the one that
[18:36] doesn't stay in Fellowship that's why we
[18:38] got to stay in
[18:39] Fellowship right because Satan's going
[18:40] to
[18:42] harpazo that that sheep right snatch him
[18:45] up seize them up Hallelujah and he wants
[18:48] to scatter the Sheep divide them up I
[18:51] like this one I like this one right I
[18:53] will give them Jesus said I'll give them
[18:54] eternal life and they shall never perish
[18:57] neither shall any man harpa them out of
[18:59] my hand hallelujah oh if you're in the
[19:01] hand of Jesus tonight you're in the
[19:03] safest hand in the universe amen nobody
[19:06] can grab it out of jesus' hands amen
[19:09] hallelujah My Father which gave them me
[19:11] is greater than all and no man is able
[19:14] to harpazo them out of my father's
[19:17] hand oh I love it amen beautiful and
[19:21] they were come up out of the water the
[19:22] spirit of God called away Philip harpazo
[19:25] him right he disappeared away from the
[19:28] unic as he praising God I baptized the
[19:30] name of the Lord Jesus Christ Philip is
[19:32] harpazo out unic saw him no more and he
[19:36] went on his Road rejoicing her his way
[19:38] and There Rose a great dissension the
[19:40] chief Captain fearing lest Paul should
[19:41] have been pulled in pieces them
[19:43] commanded the soldiers to go down and to
[19:45] harpazo him from among them to bring him
[19:48] into the castle so see you get the idea
[19:50] of of soldiers grabbing somebody seizing
[19:52] them and carrying away right let's apply
[19:56] that to the Rapture that's what Jesus is
[19:58] going to do for you and I hallelujah
[20:00] amen hallelujah so spiritually nobody
[20:03] can harpazo us out of jesus' hand right
[20:07] but then at the Rapture he's going to
[20:08] come down and he's going to harpazo us
[20:10] he's going to take us away from this sin
[20:13] cursed Earth hallelujah amen that's the
[20:16] promise of God
[20:19] hallelujah so here now we see philli and
[20:21] Paul have similar harpazo experiences I
[20:24] knew a man in Christ about 14 years ago
[20:26] whether in the body I cannot tell or
[20:27] whether out of the body I cannot tell
[20:29] God knoweth such as one caught up or
[20:32] harpazo to the third heaven hallelujah
[20:36] how that he was harpazo into paradise
[20:40] and heard unspeakable Words which is not
[20:42] lawful for a man to utter so see Paul
[20:46] like Phillip it wasn't their efforts to
[20:49] be
[20:50] harpazo so it ain't going to be your
[20:52] effort I thought somebody us should say
[20:54] Amen on that it was it wasn't there they
[20:57] didn't snatch themselves up Jesus
[20:59] snatched them up
[21:00] hallelujah hallelujah it's not going to
[21:02] be our effort it wasn't Enoch's effort
[21:04] yeah he pleased God but but that was
[21:06] under the blood and bulls and goats we
[21:07] can do a better job pleasing God because
[21:09] we've got the blood of Jesus and we got
[21:11] the Holy Ghost
[21:12] Hallelujah right we've got better
[21:15] promises the Bible says we got a better
[21:17] Covenant Hallelujah well surely we can
[21:19] be raptured Hallelujah if Enoch was
[21:21] raptured on the blood of bulls and
[21:24] goats but see caught up see God he whis
[21:28] he whisks us away he pulls us out of
[21:31] this
[21:32] Dimension he pulls us out of Leo deia he
[21:36] does it it's his powers not by our might
[21:39] not by power but by the harpazo of the
[21:42] Holy Spirit hallelujah amen now here's
[21:45] the one that that's our text that's the
[21:46] fifth Rapture and I I'll remind you
[21:48] again these six raptures you might have
[21:49] it memorized but if not you're going to
[21:50] get a good review here
[21:52] tonight then we which are alive and
[21:54] remain shall be caught up harpazo
[21:56] together with them in the cloud
[21:59] now see harpazo together that kind of
[22:01] makes us think we'll see the dead in
[22:03] Christ for brother said maybe around 40
[22:05] days we'll see we don't know he said
[22:07] maybe a month and a half he said in one
[22:09] 1962 quote I got that quote I always
[22:11] save it if you want it let me know I
[22:14] think brother B said about a month and a
[22:16] half we'll see the dead in Christ now
[22:17] it's not thus sayith the Lord but it it
[22:20] would be a it would be uh a pattern like
[22:22] he did at the first resurrection right
[22:25] or at the uh the resurrection of Christ
[22:27] to meet the Lord in the air and so shall
[22:30] we ever be with the Lord so he snatches
[22:33] us away so we'll be with him Hallelujah
[22:36] aren't you glad he's going to pull you
[22:38] out of this Dimension into his Dimension
[22:41] and then you're always going to be with
[22:43] him hallelujah oh we're not going to be
[22:45] around the devil thank God Amen we're
[22:47] not going to be around uh the this
[22:48] political system praise God we're not
[22:50] going to be around sin and deuch and
[22:53] lasciviousness we'll be with the Holy
[22:54] One we'll be with Jesus we'll be with
[22:56] our husband Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[22:59] we'll always be with him
[23:02] Hallelujah that's the fifth
[23:05] Rapture got two more on harpazo I've
[23:08] already showed you 11 here's 12 Jude
[23:09] 1:23 and others saved with fear pulling
[23:12] them out of the fire see church that
[23:16] this is this is what we need to think
[23:18] about
[23:20] tonight is there anybody God puts on our
[23:23] heart where we need to go tell them you
[23:25] know you're going to be lost if you
[23:26] don't get saved
[23:28] and we've got to use some actual
[23:30] persuasion to get them to be
[23:32] saved is everybody with
[23:35] me you got some people you might have to
[23:38] use persuasion to pull them out of the
[23:41] fires of hell and Temptation and lust
[23:44] and fear and greed and all these things
[23:46] that Pride all the things that are
[23:47] gripping them you might have to use like
[23:49] that brother I remember that brother
[23:50] that 76 year old brother down there in h
[23:52] Kentucky ah what's his name now I can't
[23:54] remember his name but anyways it's it's
[23:55] almost like he said they almost had to
[23:57] drag me to church well then there it is
[23:58] right there church if someone I'll say
[24:01] it like this if God leads you to drag
[24:02] somebody to church you drag them to
[24:04] church because some of them are going to
[24:06] be won by
[24:09] harpazo seizing them and bringing to
[24:11] church that's why if you're a parent you
[24:12] got children you got to seize them to
[24:14] come to church don't let don't don't let
[24:16] them sit at home as when they get older
[24:18] right you got to harpaz them you got to
[24:21] bring them to the house of God
[24:23] hallelujah no matter what what you got
[24:25] to do like I said uh look at cam Simon
[24:27] and me as preachers my mom beat us with
[24:29] a bat my mom uh sprayed us with vinegar
[24:32] uh my mom did all kinds of things to get
[24:33] us she harpazo us to go to church amen
[24:37] hallelujah and look what happened God
[24:39] did God worked it out
[24:41] Hallelujah and now there's nowhere else
[24:43] I'd rather be than in the house of God
[24:45] hallelujah see because it's it it's just
[24:48] the leading of the Lord some people you
[24:50] got to almost harpazo to church so
[24:53] that's something you and I should think
[24:54] about tonight maybe we'll pray for that
[24:55] in the service because it's just so
[24:57] unique it's such a scripture right and
[24:59] remember we get the picture of lot don't
[25:01] we he's got to be dragged out the Angels
[25:04] if I just excuse you the Angels got to
[25:06] come on lot let's go let's go let's go
[25:09] destruction's
[25:10] coming that's the picture that we
[25:13] get right they somebody hates somebody
[25:16] sins so much it's like come on come on
[25:18] up to the altar see that will do
[25:20] somebody
[25:22] good you remember uh brother Jose would
[25:24] remember but if you haven't listened to
[25:25] it Perry Green's testimony he was uh
[25:28] he was a good friend of brother brandom
[25:30] but anyways his testimony was his
[25:32] parents would force him to come to
[25:33] prayer meetings because he wasn't you
[25:35] know he just he was he was a teenager
[25:37] wasn't ready he said but week after week
[25:39] they prayed for him he said one time he
[25:41] was just at the altar praying he wasn't
[25:43] expecting anything he said they come by
[25:45] these old Saints laid hands on him and
[25:47] PR pressed on him and prayed for him
[25:49] until he was filled with the Holy
[25:52] Ghost Hallelujah remember Aaron's
[25:54] testimony remember Aaron the preacher
[25:57] from Pennsylvania well maybe he didn't
[25:59] tell you the testimony but he told me he
[26:01] said when he wasn't saved he was raised
[26:02] in the message he said he went Wayward
[26:04] he said just call him home from a
[26:05] college break and he come down and sit
[26:07] there and just you know he he was going
[26:09] to go to church he had plans to do all
[26:10] these sinful things right after church
[26:12] and he said something the preacher said
[26:13] about uh getting saved Drew him up to
[26:15] the Altar and they pulled him up to the
[26:18] Altar and got him saved and his life has
[26:21] never been the same sense the church
[26:23] said see sometimes you got to harpazo
[26:26] them to church
[26:28] say it like that and you can go with it
[26:29] however you feel led Hallelujah I'm
[26:32] always going to harple my children to
[26:34] church no matter how old they get amen
[26:35] as long as they're in my house
[26:37] amen now Revelation 125 the last Harpo
[26:40] in the Bible this is the fourth Rapture
[26:43] and she brought forth a man child that
[26:44] was Jesus right the Jewish Church the in
[26:46] the type the woman with the 12 stars is
[26:49] Israel Israel brought forth a Manchild
[26:51] right is Mary who was to rule all
[26:53] nations with a rod of iron and her child
[26:55] was caught up harpos unto God and to his
[26:58] throme that's the fourth Rapture all
[27:00] right who's got the six raptures
[27:01] memorized you always break it up into
[27:03] three right you know Elijah I'm Enoch
[27:05] Elijah Jesus alone to present his
[27:07] sacrifice remember he said don't touch
[27:08] me I got to present myself to the father
[27:11] but then after he comes back now there's
[27:13] three three more raptures after that
[27:14] Jesus with the Old Testament Saints
[27:16] Gentile Saints that's the one we're
[27:18] looking for and then Moses and Elijah
[27:20] are raptured uh three and a half days
[27:23] after they're killed they're raised from
[27:25] the dead and they're raptured in the
[27:26] sight of everybody
[27:29] hallelujah hallelujah all right so now
[27:32] you got a good harpazo preaching okay
[27:35] now you know what it means it's snatch
[27:37] away eagerly right it's I'm going to
[27:40] take this by force this is mine
[27:43] Hallelujah this ain't somebody else's
[27:45] this is mine Church you belong to
[27:48] Jesus you are his you're the one he
[27:51] loves amen you're God's beloved
[27:54] Hallelujah well of course he's going to
[27:56] snatch you away from the tribulation
[27:58] you're the one that he
[28:00] loves
[28:03] ah now I thought I would show you what
[28:06] did this actually look like in the
[28:08] scripture so when Jesus was caught up
[28:11] this is what it looked like when he had
[28:12] spoken these things while they beheld
[28:13] him remember they upon the mountain he
[28:15] was taken up and a cloud received him
[28:17] out of their sight so Jesus starts
[28:20] Rising off the ground and he goes up to
[28:22] some cloud in the sky then they don't
[28:23] see him anymore that's how that that was
[28:26] the fourth Rapture right there
[28:28] Hallelujah some some way maybe they I I
[28:31] don't think they saw the Old Testament
[28:32] Saints the Bible say they just saw Jesus
[28:33] but somehow those Old Testament Saints
[28:35] they met him up in the air there
[28:36] individually in the the spiritual realm
[28:38] and then Jesus led them into heaven open
[28:41] up ye gates over Everlasting doors let
[28:44] the king of glory come in
[28:46] hallelujah hallelujah amen they say who
[28:49] is this king of glory the lord Mighty
[28:52] strong in battle
[28:54] hallelujah amen open up those Heaven
[28:56] Gates the king of glory is coming and oh
[28:59] one day Church Jesus is going to lead us
[29:01] into heaven the king of glory is going
[29:03] to lead his bride into heaven we'll be
[29:05] right behind him Hallelujah the king of
[29:07] Glory
[29:09] Hallelujah Heaven's Gates will open for
[29:11] us
[29:12] hallelujah cuz we'll be behind the king
[29:15] of glory praise God Heaven can't keep
[29:17] him out he's the creator of Heaven
[29:20] amen hallelujah praise
[29:24] God now getting back to John rich and
[29:27] Tucker and you guys remember Tucker and
[29:29] John Rich that I showed you on
[29:31] Sunday okay so he gave two proofs that
[29:34] there's no pre-tribulation Rapture but
[29:36] anybody that knows their Bible knows
[29:38] they're wrong right anybody that I I
[29:40] should say like this that's what I
[29:41] always say on the videos any honest
[29:42] person knows brother man was a real man
[29:44] of God that because they're not being
[29:46] honest right any honest person knows
[29:49] that Matthew 24 and second Thessalonians
[29:51] chapter two do not teach that there's no
[29:54] pre-tribulation Rapture any honest
[29:56] person knows that all right I'm not
[29:59] saying that to be arrogant I'm just
[30:00] saying that because that's the truth
[30:01] hallelujah I'm going to show it to you
[30:02] tonight so let's read through these get
[30:03] your Bible go to Matthew 24 now while
[30:06] you're turning there Matthew 24 has
[30:09] always struck me as just an amazing
[30:12] chapter right uh and I wrote this down
[30:15] three years
[30:16] ago I was reading my Bible one morning
[30:19] that's my that's my journal now I don't
[30:21] keep a journal anymore because I just
[30:23] got it all memorized now I did it for so
[30:24] many days you know I kind of in my mind
[30:26] I got all the things I got to get done
[30:27] then everything else if I got time I'll
[30:28] get to that but I had to use journals
[30:30] for about four years you know to be
[30:32] disciplined and time management where's
[30:34] time management that's a good request we
[30:35] look at down it took me about four or
[30:37] five years but now I got it just all
[30:38] buil into my head now I don't have to do
[30:39] the journal anymore unless I really get
[30:41] overwhelmed I haven't had to do it since
[30:43] uh I don't know last year maybe April so
[30:47] on this day February uh 17th 2021 I read
[30:50] Matthew 24 and I I knew brother random
[30:53] said now brother ROM got it from
[30:54] Clarence Lin I'm going to show it to you
[30:56] it doesn't make brother ROM uh a bad
[30:59] person he said he read Lin amen he told
[31:02] us what he did now the revelations were
[31:05] given with thus say the Lord all the
[31:06] thus say the Lord Revelations were
[31:08] different from
[31:09] Larin any honest person knows that like
[31:13] I had some critics a few weeks ago
[31:14] saying Jesse you always just repeat the
[31:16] same things that there's 38 differences
[31:18] on the seals and I'm like that's because
[31:20] none of you can answer
[31:21] it I'm going to keep using that because
[31:24] none of you can answer it none of you
[31:26] have any objection to prove me wrong I'm
[31:28] gonna I'm Gonna Be Right
[31:29] Hallelujah why would I give up a good
[31:31] argument well I better they're tired of
[31:33] that argument even though it's true I
[31:34] guess I'll give it up what a bunch of
[31:35] nonsense these people these people they
[31:39] have no answers for okay so what in that
[31:42] morning in my notes I looked at verses
[31:43] two and I looked at I read Verses 4 to
[31:45] 14 and we'll go through this here uh but
[31:49] here if you've listened to the uh let me
[31:52] go uh yeah let me go here if you've
[31:55] listened to the fourth no it's the Sixth
[31:57] Seal yeah if you've listened to the six
[31:59] seal lately brother random shows how the
[32:02] six seals are in Matthew 24 did you know
[32:06] that you remember that brother Ram said
[32:09] Jesus preached the six
[32:13] seals everybody's thinking out there
[32:15] good trying to remember when you listen
[32:16] to last last time you listen to The
[32:17] Sixth
[32:20] Seal and this is where brother brother
[32:22] ad is almost quoting verbatim Clarence
[32:25] Larin in that sermon at the beginning
[32:27] before he gets to the revelation of The
[32:28] Sixth Seal okay so this is Clarence
[32:32] arin's
[32:33] book U look he's said Matthew 24 1-3
[32:37] Jesus went out and departed from the
[32:39] temple and his disciples came to him for
[32:40] to show him the buildings of the temple
[32:42] and Jesus said unto him see not all
[32:44] these things verely I said Toto you
[32:45] there shall not be here one stone upon
[32:47] another that shall not be thrown down
[32:49] now here it is right first three so
[32:51] crucial And he as he sat upon the Mount
[32:54] of Oles the disciples came unto him
[32:55] privately saying they asked him three
[32:57] question
[32:58] questions now everybody remember
[33:01] this when shall these things be that's
[33:05] one
[33:06] question and what shall be the sign of
[33:08] thy coming that's the
[33:10] Rapture and third and of the end of the
[33:13] world that's
[33:16] Armageddon there's three questions in
[33:18] there but John Rich says oh no this
[33:20] whole chapter is just about the Rapture
[33:22] no it's not there's three different
[33:24] events in
[33:25] there I mean it's just it's
[33:28] it's so immature I don't I don't know
[33:29] what other word to say childish it's so
[33:31] childish it's so ignorant to say that
[33:34] all these things are the one and same
[33:35] event it's that that's so that's so
[33:37] childish it's so
[33:39] uninformed right but we wouldn't know it
[33:42] except God sent us a prophet and then
[33:43] brother found that from Lin but then God
[33:45] gave brother Ram the thus say the Lord
[33:47] Revelation on all the Seven
[33:49] Seals now if you remember who remembers
[33:52] how many seals did Brother random and
[33:54] Lin agree on does anybody
[33:56] remember no okay was a good review for
[33:58] everybody then all right great I'm uh
[34:00] I'm helping you get a little sharper I'm
[34:02] sharper than your swords tonight okay
[34:04] there's one they agreed on out of seven
[34:07] there's Seven Seals brother Ram only
[34:09] agreed with Lin on one and that was The
[34:11] Sixth Seal because the Sixth Seal is the
[34:13] easiest to see it's
[34:14] tribulation right moon is uh moon is
[34:17] turned to blood Sun's darkened you know
[34:19] uh they're hiding in caves you know uh
[34:22] they say oh hide us from the Lamb hide
[34:23] us from the face of lamb when is the
[34:25] Lamb coming in Wrath at the Battle get
[34:27] so this is the easiest one to understand
[34:29] but brother Braham differed on six out
[34:31] of the seven and that's what the accuser
[34:34] of brother Braham just want to ignore
[34:36] they just want to they want me to move
[34:37] on from that but I'm not moving on from
[34:38] the truth I wouldn't I would never move
[34:40] on from the truth okay so there's three
[34:42] questions in there and then brother said
[34:44] the first seal brother quotes this for
[34:45] btim he says the first seal is in
[34:48] Matthew 244 and5 Jesus answerers to them
[34:51] take heed that no man deceive you that's
[34:52] the white horse rider right deceive he
[34:55] looks white he looks like he's holy but
[34:56] he's not he's a liar he's a devil he's
[34:58] the Antichrist he's deceiver for many
[35:00] shall come in my name saying I am Christ
[35:02] and shall deceive many and he quotes the
[35:04] first seal
[35:07] Hallelujah Lin said the first seal is
[35:10] right after the Rapture to Lin the first
[35:13] seal hasn't even happened yet for
[35:14] brother random it happened 2,000 years
[35:16] ago right after the day of
[35:18] Pentecost the church said we're not
[35:21] following cunningly devised wives fables
[35:25] we're following thus sayith the Lord
[35:27] amen hallelujah
[35:31] amen now the second seal is in Matthew
[35:34] 246 and 7 you should hear of wars and
[35:36] rumors of wars see that you be not
[35:38] troubled for all these things must come
[35:40] to pass but the end is not yet for
[35:41] Nations shall rise against Nation
[35:42] Kingdom against Kingdom that's the
[35:44] second
[35:45] seal all right now I'm not going to read
[35:47] the rest because I actually couldn't
[35:48] find them they only had this page okay
[35:50] but I'm going to go back to this here's
[35:52] a timeline this is what John rich and
[35:54] Tucker Carlson just don't know because
[35:56] they don't know Terence Larin and they
[35:58] don't know God's Prophet brother
[35:59] brandham I hope they know him
[36:02] someday they asked Jesus asked I'm sorry
[36:04] they asked Jesus three questions when
[36:07] shall not be here left one stone upon
[36:10] another that happened in ad70 when Titus
[36:13] the Roman uh General came and destroyed
[36:16] the temple that already
[36:18] happened right and they asked him what
[36:22] should be the sign of the end of the
[36:23] world that's
[36:24] Armageddon sometime after 2,000 right
[36:28] they ask him what should be the sign of
[36:29] thy coming that's the Rapture there's
[36:32] three questions in here and that's what
[36:34] they those men they just don't
[36:36] know Hallelujah all right so everybody
[36:39] see that there's three questions in
[36:41] there there's not one question there's
[36:43] three questions Hallelujah all right now
[36:48] get your Bibles here now let's read acts
[36:50] I'm sorry no Matthew 24
[36:52] sorry now you'll see my question marks
[36:54] these are my honest and I still have the
[36:55] same question today I don't know which
[36:58] of these questions do all the verses
[37:00] apply
[37:01] to and God doesn't have to put
[37:04] everything in chronological order he can
[37:06] mix things up remember anybody remember
[37:08] Joel chapter 2 and the church said
[37:11] brother Bram said verses 23- 26 are the
[37:14] latter rain the Rapture verse 28 was the
[37:17] day of Pentecost 2,000 years
[37:20] ago so the order isn't chronological the
[37:23] order is flipped and who's read Joel one
[37:26] lately anybody read Joel one
[37:29] that's the that's the army of the
[37:31] 144,000
[37:32] Jews that's even after Joel
[37:36] 228 it's totally mixed up Joel's
[37:39] prophecy is all mixed up hallelujah
[37:41] praise God Amen because it's hidden from
[37:44] the eyes of the wise and prudent all
[37:46] these people that believe it's
[37:47] chronological they let women cut their
[37:49] hair come on Church they believe God's
[37:52] three persons amen like that sign uh
[37:55] Genevie saw it tonight there's this
[37:57] there's this meme it said they have a
[37:58] sign it says uh one coffee per
[38:01] person and so God walks up or Jesus
[38:04] walks up and says can I have three
[38:05] coffees because I'm three
[38:08] persons I like that one that's a good
[38:10] sense of humor right there it shows that
[38:13] the it shows the insanity of three
[38:15] persons it's
[38:17] insane it's polytheistic it's tritheism
[38:22] monic teaching
[38:23] amen Jesus says oh can I have three
[38:26] because my father and the holy ghost
[38:27] need a coffee too one coffee per person
[38:30] what a bunch of trash my goodness I'm be
[38:34] a little harsh tonight but that's got to
[38:35] how the way it's going here tonight by
[38:37] God's grace now Matthew
[38:41] 24 if I could just get
[38:49] there almost
[38:52] there now verse one through three we
[38:54] already read verse three is the three
[38:56] questions
[38:58] okay now the first seal was verses four
[38:59] and five uh the second seal was verse
[39:04] six now the third and fourth seal are
[39:07] verse seven I'm going to read that for
[39:08] nation should Rise Against Nation
[39:09] Kingdom against Kingdom there should be
[39:11] famines right there's Co I'm sorry
[39:12] that's not Co that's that's famine and
[39:14] pestilence is there's
[39:17] Co right any pestilence that includes
[39:20] the Spanish Flu from a hundred years
[39:23] ago any pestilence or germ disease is
[39:26] right there
[39:28] and earthquakes in diverse places
[39:30] there's that 1964 earthquake when Alaska
[39:33] almost sunk into the ocean brother BR
[39:34] talked about I saw I I got brother Jose
[39:36] got the magazine in there you want to
[39:38] look at it after church this a Life
[39:40] Magazine 1964 you can see all the
[39:43] pictures look at verse eight and all
[39:46] these are the beginning of
[39:48] Sorrows okay now that's why we said Co
[39:52] was just a birth pain but it wasn't the
[39:55] it wasn't the last sign before the
[39:57] rapure it's just a birth pain it's a
[40:00] prefigure showing there is going to come
[40:02] a mark of the beast right there is going
[40:05] to come this one world there is going to
[40:07] come this forcing down on people right
[40:11] okay now I put on this list I hadn't
[40:14] known you know I don't know all the
[40:15] answers but let's read uh let's read the
[40:17] next verse I thought verses nine to 14
[40:22] were about uh the Rapture now I could be
[40:25] wrong but let's read them then then
[40:27] shall they deliver you up to be
[40:29] afflicted and shall kill you and should
[40:30] be hated of all Nations for my name's
[40:33] sake okay so people being this is either
[40:35] this is either the Jews being killed or
[40:37] the Christians being
[40:40] killed now hate of all Nations now that
[40:42] makes me think Israel because all
[40:43] nations are going to come against Israel
[40:45] as Zechariah says verse 10 and then
[40:48] shall many be offended and shall betray
[40:51] one another and shall hate one another
[40:52] and many false prophets shall rise and
[40:53] deceive many now that sounds like what
[40:55] we have right now like I told you all
[40:56] these false prophets on TV prophesying
[41:00] all these things and they get it wrong
[41:01] every single
[41:02] time literally Church literally Benny
[41:05] hin and this other false prophet named
[41:07] Chris Reed within the matter of a few
[41:09] months they both prophesied and said the
[41:12] Lord showed them there's going to be a
[41:13] two-state solution in the Gaza bank and
[41:18] Israel and church literally within two
[41:21] months the Hamas Israel war
[41:23] started that's how God shames these
[41:26] false prophets
[41:29] the one the Chris Reed guy said oh the
[41:31] Lord showed me a newspaper and it said a
[41:33] two-state deal is reached between 2022
[41:36] and 2023 what a lie from the
[41:39] devil Benny Hinn said uh oh there's
[41:41] going to be a two-state solution here in
[41:43] 2023 and you better send me your money
[41:46] uh uh because then God's going to bless
[41:48] you and there's going to be a wealth
[41:49] transfer and all the Christians are
[41:50] going to get rich when this big world
[41:51] worldwide Revival what a
[41:54] liar they're lying to try to get money
[41:57] thank God that we believe the truth
[41:59] hallelujah let no man deceive you don't
[42:02] let any preacher deceive you you stand
[42:04] on the word of God be faithful to God's
[42:07] word God will back up his word
[42:08] hallelujah don't believe these false
[42:11] Liars or these false prophets and
[42:13] Liars remember the Bible said they just
[42:16] want to their God is their belly they're
[42:18] only after a payday that's their God
[42:21] their God is Not
[42:25] Jesus all right verse uh 12 and because
[42:28] iniquity shall bound the love of many
[42:30] shall wax
[42:32] cold and he that shall endure unto the
[42:34] end the same shall be saved it's like
[42:36] that other internet Prophet that who
[42:37] calls me the Pharisee of akan he said he
[42:40] said thus sayith the Lord by 2023 Joseph
[42:43] Bram has to repent or God's going to
[42:44] snatch the kingdom out of his hand he's
[42:46] going to lose his his place now look
[42:47] here we are it's almost 2025 God still
[42:49] hasn't snatched it out of his hand
[42:51] that's a lying
[42:53] Spirit right trying to and then he
[42:55] interprets it some other way it was
[42:57] Billy Paul I'm sorry snatching Billy
[42:59] Paul out of Joseph's hand that makes no
[43:02] sense it it just it makes no
[43:05] sense right these people don't know what
[43:07] they're doing they're not hearing from
[43:09] God they're not prophets God sent us a
[43:12] prophet his name was William brandham
[43:14] Hallelujah and we're just preachers here
[43:16] trying to rightly divide the word of
[43:18] Truth stay in our position Hallelujah
[43:21] just stay in your position and watch the
[43:23] miraculous move into action Hallelujah
[43:26] that's right our God is tremendous amen
[43:28] I'm just giving you some examples not
[43:29] even in my notes really not in my notes
[43:32] at
[43:33] all see you have to endure the same
[43:35] shall be saved that see now that makes
[43:37] it look like uh Israel but we'll see
[43:40] verse 14 and this gospel so now that
[43:42] looks like the the Gentiles the gospel
[43:45] of the Kingdom shall be preached in all
[43:47] the world for a witness unto all nations
[43:49] and then shall the End come all right so
[43:52] that was my guess three years ago it
[43:53] seems like Verses 4 to 14 are about the
[43:56] Rapture but is looks like there's some
[43:58] overlap there I don't know for sure now
[44:01] I put 15 to 21 I'm not sure I'm not sure
[44:05] on these ones when ye oh yeah okay so
[44:08] this looks like when uh this looks like
[44:11] when Titus came when ye therefore shall
[44:14] see the abomination of desolation spoken
[44:16] of by Daniel the Prophet stand in the
[44:17] Holy Place whoo reth let him understand
[44:20] now that could have been Titus standing
[44:21] there in uh herod's Temple it could have
[44:24] been
[44:24] that but it also could have a comp
[44:27] compound prophecy that could be when the
[44:28] pope Antichrist stands in the new Jewish
[44:32] temple because there can be compound
[44:35] prophecy who so reth let them understand
[44:38] let them which be in Judea flee into the
[44:42] mountains let him which is on the
[44:44] housetop not come down to take anything
[44:46] out of his house so what event would be
[44:49] so
[44:51] serious when a when a demon filed person
[44:54] stands at the temple that they don't
[44:56] have time to pack a
[44:57] bag that to me sounds like Titus that
[45:01] sounds like what Titus did remember
[45:02] Titus surrounded them remember for four
[45:04] years and he starved them out remember
[45:07] and but all the Christians were out
[45:08] before Titus
[45:09] came this sounds like Titus is coming
[45:13] the question was when is it going to be
[45:15] when one Stone's not left upon another
[45:17] okay Verse 18 neither let him which is
[45:19] in the field return back to take his
[45:21] clothes verse 19 and woe to them that
[45:23] are with child and to them that give
[45:24] suck in those days see you see that
[45:27] would be of course when Titus was there
[45:28] because he was going to slay
[45:30] everybody see that's the way I look at
[45:32] it as far as I can understand
[45:34] it verse 20 but pray that ye that your
[45:37] flight be not in Winter neither on the
[45:38] Sabbath day for when they shall for then
[45:40] shall be Great Tribulation such as not
[45:42] since the beginning of the world to this
[45:44] time no nor ever shall be now that
[45:47] sounds like Daniel 12 ver1 the Great
[45:51] Tribulation so see some of these verses
[45:52] sound like they apply to Titus others
[45:55] sound like they apply to arm get in but
[45:58] see I don't know it's hard to it's hard
[46:00] to know the actual breaking right
[46:02] because remember this Sunday I read you
[46:05] Isaiah 25:8 it doesn't say anything
[46:08] about the Gentiles but you and I are
[46:10] trusting that death swalled up in life
[46:13] is our ticket out of leoa
[46:16] Hallelujah and Paul pulled it out of
[46:18] there and never that doesn't say Isaiah
[46:20] didn't say the Gentile Rapture he just
[46:23] says death is swallowed up in
[46:25] Victory Hallelujah I like malach had a
[46:27] good thought on Sunday night we're
[46:28] sharing our favorite thoughts the next
[46:30] verse says about how we must wait for
[46:32] him and that's what the wise virgin did
[46:34] they waited for the Lord that was a good
[46:36] I thought that was a good thought there
[46:37] Hallelujah right because they're waiting
[46:39] they got to wait for us coming Lord when
[46:40] are you coming I got my oil I I got my
[46:43] lamp trimmed I got extra oil I'm waiting
[46:45] for the coming and then he comes back
[46:47] and we're ready Hallelujah all right now
[46:50] that's something that's it's good
[46:51] thought there I like
[46:53] that and except those days should be
[46:55] shortened there should be no flesh
[46:57] saved but for the elect sake those days
[47:00] shall be shortened so God is actually
[47:01] going to shorten the days so people can
[47:04] be saved isn't that interesting it's
[47:06] just amazing verse 23 then if any man
[47:10] say here unto you Lo here is Christ or
[47:12] there believe it
[47:14] not now brother Ram uses of course verse
[47:17] 23 and 24 to talk about this day right
[47:22] anybody listen to anointed ones at the
[47:23] end times
[47:25] lately what what is brother ad's verse
[47:28] right here Matthew
[47:31] 24:24 for there shall arise false Christ
[47:34] that means false anointed ones they have
[47:35] the genuine anointing but they're false
[47:38] like balam like Judas and false prophets
[47:41] and shall show great one signs and
[47:43] wonders in so much if it were possible
[47:45] they shall deceive the very elect if it
[47:47] were possible it's not possible
[47:51] Hallelujah that's brother R's verse for
[47:53] the anointed ones of the end times for
[47:55] the
[47:55] Gentiles Hallelujah so see how these
[47:58] three there's three questions but all
[48:00] these verses they're kind of just thrown
[48:02] in there they're not chronologically in
[48:06] order
[48:07] right
[48:10] Hallelujah TR everybody can see that by
[48:12] God's grace now verse 25 behold I have
[48:15] told you before wherefore if they shall
[48:17] say unto you behold he's in the desert
[48:18] go not forth behold he's in the secret
[48:20] Chambers believe it not so I thought
[48:23] this all applied now I thought these
[48:24] verses apply to the Rapture verse 27 for
[48:26] as lightning cometh out of the East and
[48:27] shineth unto the West so shall also the
[48:30] coming of the son of man be now what
[48:31] does that remind you of the lightning
[48:33] what's that remind you of the twinkling
[48:35] of the eye it's so fast how many you see
[48:38] I saw lightning this summer I'm like oh
[48:39] I wish I could have taped that rewind it
[48:42] back I just want to see that again you
[48:44] it goes so fast I want to enjoy it again
[48:47] that's that's why this part seems like
[48:49] the Rapture it's G to be so
[48:51] fast right but there's false prophets
[48:53] false christs
[48:57] now verse 28 now here it is brother uses
[48:59] this all the time for the Rapture for
[49:01] wheresoever the carcass is there will
[49:03] the Eagles be gathered together when
[49:05] when the lightning comes at the at the
[49:08] coming of the son of man this this fast
[49:11] coming of Jesus this lightning coming
[49:14] verse 29 immediately after the
[49:16] tribulation of those days shall the sun
[49:18] be dark and the moon shall not give her
[49:19] light now what's that remind of that's
[49:21] the six seal that's almost the exact
[49:24] same words of the six seal
[49:28] so see you have all the you have the
[49:29] three events and all these details are
[49:32] kind of mixed up in here and the uh it's
[49:34] hidden from the foolish it's hidden from
[49:38] people uh that are focused on
[49:39] denomination and and and money and all
[49:41] these things but it's revealed to the
[49:43] bride because she's become like a
[49:46] child all right and the moon shall not
[49:50] give her light verse 29 and the Stars
[49:51] shall fall from Heaven and the powers of
[49:53] the heaven shall be shaken and then
[49:54] shall appear the sign of the son of man
[49:56] in heaven
[49:57] and then shall all the tribes of the
[49:58] earth Rejoice did I read that right no
[50:01] they shall
[50:02] mourn but the Bible says when he comes
[50:05] we'll
[50:06] Rejoice Hallelujah these are three
[50:09] different comings amen hallelujah the
[50:12] coming of Jesus is called a blessed hope
[50:15] not a
[50:16] Mourning that must mean there's a
[50:18] different
[50:19] coming if some people are mourning it
[50:22] can't be the same coming as us getting
[50:24] what we've hoped for praise God the joy
[50:26] of being snatched away praise
[50:28] God oh my
[50:32] hallelujah it's like honey on the
[50:34] honeycomb Hallelujah and they shall see
[50:36] the son of man coming in the Clouds Of
[50:37] Heaven with power and great Glory that's
[50:40] Armageddon and he shall send his angels
[50:42] with a great sound of a trumpet and they
[50:43] shall gather together his elect from the
[50:44] Four Winds and from one end of Heaven to
[50:47] the other that's also in Revelation
[50:49] about the
[50:52] Jews all right now I got verses 32
[50:57] okay no there's yeah 32s seems to be
[50:59] about the six
[51:01] seal yes because it talks about the Fig
[51:04] Tree who's the Fig Tree Church does
[51:05] anybody remember Israel yes the Fig Tree
[51:08] is Israel so verses 32 talks about the
[51:12] the the Fig
[51:13] Tree okay now look at verse 35 Heaven
[51:16] and Earth shall pass away but my word
[51:18] shall not pass away now look at verse 36
[51:20] now we get back to the Rapture there's
[51:21] the Rapture again it went from Israel
[51:24] 144,000 back to the Rapture of the
[51:26] Gentiles
[51:27] but in that day and hour knoweth no man
[51:28] know not the angels of heaven but my
[51:30] father only but as the days of nowh so
[51:34] also shall be the coming of the son of
[51:35] man doesn't that sound familiar that's
[51:37] this is the parallel to Luke
[51:39] 17:30 right brother R's
[51:41] Ministry for as in the days that were
[51:44] before the flood they were eating and
[51:46] drinking marrying giving in marriage
[51:47] until the day that Noah entered in the
[51:49] ark and nunah until the flood came and
[51:51] took them all away so shall also the
[51:53] coming of the son of man be well that's
[51:54] a different
[51:55] coming right right that's a different
[51:57] coming there than the one we read
[51:59] earlier where the sun is blackened and
[52:01] all these it's a different coming it's
[52:03] the Rapture
[52:04] coming right you got the Rapture coming
[52:07] you got us coming to the 144,000 when
[52:09] When They Mourn from house to house and
[52:11] a fountain is open the House of David
[52:13] then you got another coming at
[52:14] Armageddon when they all mourn praise
[52:18] God oh it's going to take some wisdom
[52:20] hallelujah it's going to take the Holy
[52:21] Ghost for people to understand
[52:25] Hallelujah that's right right now verse
[52:28] 40 41 42 43 44 what do I got there I got
[52:35] yeah all seems to be the Rapture down to
[52:36] verse 51 right because what do you have
[52:38] you have uh uh one shall be in the field
[52:42] in verse 40 one will be in the field one
[52:43] taken one left there's the Rapture right
[52:47] one is snatched away one is not
[52:50] Hallelujah Glory verse 41 two women
[52:53] should be grinding at the Mill the one
[52:55] should be taken the other left that's
[52:56] the Rapture watch ye therefore for you
[52:59] know not what hour your Lord
[53:02] come now church this might be deeper but
[53:05] I wrote about in the
[53:07] chapter if people believe Jesus is
[53:09] coming in the tribulation period they
[53:11] can know the day he's coming because
[53:13] they can count three and a half years
[53:15] and they can know the day he's
[53:17] coming right if they believe he's coming
[53:20] at the end of the tribulation period
[53:21] they can know the days coming because
[53:23] the Bible tells us
[53:24] 1,260 days they can know the day so
[53:28] these scriptures that say no man knows
[53:29] the day it has to refer to the Gentile
[53:32] church amen it has to refer to the
[53:34] Rapture
[53:36] Hallelujah because they can everybody
[53:38] else can know they can know the day the
[53:40] two witnesses are going to be killed
[53:42] because that's after three and a half
[53:44] years right every other coming they can
[53:47] know the day except the Rapture coming
[53:50] amen oh my we're getting deep and Rich
[53:53] here tonight
[53:54] Hallelujah well Hallelujah now verse 45
[53:57] is what I need to be a faithful who's

[54:05] preacher I'm trying to give you the meat
[54:08] in due season to help you get ready for
[54:09] the
[54:10] Rapture I'm not giving you Baptist

[54:28] everyone that's come in this door the
[54:30] since for 18 years that's received the
[54:32] word their lives have been
[54:34] changed Hallelujah that's right even to
[54:37] our children amen whoever will receive
[54:39] the word of God their lives will be
[54:41] changed because the Holy Ghost is giving
[54:42] us the meat in due season
[54:45] hallelujah how do I know because I'm
[54:47] strong by the meat of the word I'm not
[54:49] falling into scandals I'm not falling
[54:51] into all these sins like all these other
[54:52] preachers why because I'm eating on the
[54:54] food in Du Seas
[54:56] my life is ready your life should be
[54:59] ready we should be ready in season out
[55:01] of season we should be watching and
[55:03] praying for the coming of the Lord amen
[55:08] hallelujah that's
[55:11] right what does he do in verse 47 he
[55:13] rewards him he makes him ruler over all
[55:15] his
[55:15] Goods but the evil servant verse 48 says
[55:19] Ah the raptures
[55:20] delayed then he begins to Smite the
[55:23] people and eat and drink and be
[55:25] spiritually drunken remember you can be
[55:26] drunken with lies you can be drunken
[55:29] with lust you can be drunken with greed
[55:31] all the don't have to be natural drunk
[55:34] drunkenness right Hallelujah remember
[55:37] the Holy Ghost just told apparently just
[55:40] told Paul Griffin that my people need to
[55:43] re be rebuked this church is everybody
[55:46] listening now the Holy Ghost just told
[55:48] Paul that we need to be rebuked to have
[55:51] our first love but that we would receive
[55:54] it amen and the church
[55:58] said
[56:00] Hallelujah everybody with
[56:02] me see so just because we get a rebuking
[56:06] word or just because something harsh
[56:07] that don't mean it's not God Amen it
[56:11] means God's helping his children get the
[56:13] nonsense out of your lives let's serve
[56:15] God hallelujah let's eat the meat of the
[56:17] word praise God let's get our gifts in
[56:19] order amen let's everybody find out the
[56:22] gifts and invest in your gifts be
[56:23] faithful to God receive something from
[56:25] God hallelujah
[56:27] oh
[56:32] Hallelujah but see all those that get
[56:34] drunken and they serve themselves at the
[56:37] time of the Rapture Jesus will come in a
[56:40] time when they're not looking for him in
[56:41] verse 50 and then they're uh given their
[56:43] portion with the Hypocrites in verse
[56:46] 51
[56:47] Hallelujah did anybody see anything in
[56:50] there that says there will not be a
[56:52] pre-tribulation Rapture I didn't see
[56:54] anything in there that says that but
[56:56] that's that's what they say now second
[56:58] Thessalonians is is even more proof it's
[57:01] even more
[57:02] obvious that there's nothing in that
[57:05] chapter saying there's no
[57:06] pre-tribulation Rapture I'm almost on my
[57:08] hour okay
[57:09] boy Busy Body okay now here's what I was
[57:11] telling you there's at least three more
[57:13] comings of
[57:15] Jesus there's the second coming the
[57:18] Gentile bride I'm talking about his
[57:19] physical body now his his glorified body
[57:22] I should say maybe that's a better way
[57:23] the glorified body will come to meet us
[57:24] in the air but then he's coming to the
[57:27] 144,000 he's going to show them the
[57:29] palms of his hands
[57:31] amen and then he's going to come back on
[57:33] armag again on the White Horse with a
[57:36] vesture dipped in Blood and his name is
[57:38] the word of God thank God we've got the
[57:40] word of God today Hallelujah that's his
[57:45] name so there's at least four comings
[57:48] now that's what I thought after he burns
[57:49] over fire he'll just stay down here I
[57:51] don't think the Millennium is another
[57:53] coming I don't know I could be wrong but
[57:55] even if it is well then that's fine
[57:56] that's just that's a fifth coming then I
[57:59] mean it doesn't really matter what
[58:00] matters is that there is a
[58:02] pre-tribulation Rapture that we've got
[58:04] to get ready for praise God like all
[58:07] those scriptures said the preachers have
[58:09] to give us the meat and du season who
[58:11] doesn't need the fear of the Lord is
[58:13] anybody got so much fear of God you
[58:15] don't need any anybody going to raise
[58:16] their hand on that one I sure hope not I
[58:18] might have to rebuke you after
[58:20] service uh you got some pride in your
[58:22] life brother or sister you got some
[58:23] pride in your
[58:24] life that's let's meet and due season
[58:27] praise
[58:28] God that's what we need to
[58:31] overcome we need to be so hateful of sin
[58:34] that if something pops up on our phone
[58:36] or a screen or something we'll just look
[58:37] right away we won't even won't even give
[58:38] it a second look that's the fear of the
[58:44] Lord all
[58:46] right now let me see how many slides I
[58:48] got here I'm G to exit out of here yeah
[58:50] Cuts me off okay what that's
[58:53] strange the settings
[58:56] yeah why don't we just close with that
[58:57] one here we'll just close with this one
[58:58] here we'll just close with second
[58:59] Thessalonians chapter 2 because I'm
[59:01] already almost at an hour okay now bless
[59:04] you second Thessalonians 2 never says
[59:06] the bride will see the Antichrist that's
[59:08] what John Rich told
[59:11] Tucker and that's not what it says we
[59:14] just got to read verses 1 through 12 not
[59:17] see I don't know what Bible version he
[59:19] was he did not have a King James version
[59:20] maybe that's why Lydia he he's got the
[59:23] wrong Bible I'm going to preach on that
[59:24] again brother Cam and I are working on
[59:25] that
[59:27] and I already I already showed you some
[59:29] remember I showed you some of those
[59:29] examples from the new versions uh they
[59:32] had that that PDF on it with the dragon
[59:34] on it you know the new versions and how
[59:35] they're they're all
[59:39] corrupted 2 Thessalonians
[59:44] 2 now if somebody could please show me
[59:47] where the Bible says in here that that
[59:49] the Believers will see the the
[59:52] Antichrist well then I'm I'm open to be
[59:54] corrected after church okay please don't
[59:57] correct me in front of the live audience
[59:59] here give me the grace to go into the
[1:00:02] room and we can pray about it
[1:00:04] together verse verse one now we beseech
[1:00:06] you Brethren by the coming of our Lord
[1:00:08] Jesus Christ now that's beg you we we
[1:00:10] persuade you and by our gathering
[1:00:12] together unto him see that's what we're
[1:00:13] doing we're Gathering to Christ right
[1:00:14] now we're Gathering to
[1:00:16] him that you be not soon shaken in your
[1:00:18] mind or troubled now that ties it right
[1:00:20] with that double-mindedness I was
[1:00:21] talking about on Sunday night we're
[1:00:22] going to preach on that pretty soon I
[1:00:23] was studying on that today right all you
[1:00:25] sisters those good
[1:00:27] questions see Paul tells him because
[1:00:30] that's what we're going to battle we're
[1:00:31] going to battle mind battles they seem
[1:00:33] to shake us and like Co shook us or
[1:00:36] whatever more you know things Shake us
[1:00:38] all the rumors about wars and the
[1:00:41] Israeli War Hamas War uh Russian war and
[1:00:44] Ukraine war that surely shook me for a
[1:00:45] little bit you know we and Paul says
[1:00:48] don't try not to get shaken in your mind
[1:00:50] about things like I said now the reason
[1:00:52] that shook me was because these
[1:00:53] well-known preachers all said now in 20
[1:00:56] 22 they said uh oh the Rapture is just a
[1:00:58] few days away that really shook me up
[1:01:01] because everybody respects these
[1:01:02] preachers I I respected them too now
[1:01:04] I've got less respect for him
[1:01:07] now right and they've also got another
[1:01:09] prophecy I'm waiting to see if it comes
[1:01:10] to pass they prophesied a person with
[1:01:13] fourth deegree cancer is going to be
[1:01:15] healed and so far that was months ago
[1:01:18] that
[1:01:19] was that was five months ago and he
[1:01:21] still has fourth fourth uh four stage
[1:01:23] cancer
[1:01:26] okay and they said the Lord said he was
[1:01:27] going to be healed now if that man dies
[1:01:30] I'm gonna make a video on him because
[1:01:32] that's a lying Spirit unless that person
[1:01:35] repents I'll try to reach out to them
[1:01:37] first but see you you we got to be very
[1:01:40] careful because we don't want to be
[1:01:41] shaken in our mind are troubled verse
[1:01:42] two neither by Spirit nor by word nor by
[1:01:46] letter as from us as that the day of
[1:01:48] Christ is at
[1:01:50] hand anybody see yet where it says we're
[1:01:53] going to see the Antichrist anybody did
[1:01:54] anybody say that did Paul say the
[1:01:56] Thessalonians are going to see the
[1:01:57] Antichrist
[1:01:59] no verse three let no man deceive you by
[1:02:02] any means for that
[1:02:04] day shall not come except there come a
[1:02:06] falling away first that's what we see
[1:02:08] today right the apostasy the the Turning
[1:02:11] Away the backsliding that's what that
[1:02:12] word means turn away the backslide the
[1:02:15] churches have turned away from the word
[1:02:17] of God
[1:02:19] right and that man of sin be revealed
[1:02:22] the son of predition okay so there's
[1:02:24] there's Antichrist right there he's not
[1:02:25] called the Antichrist in the Bible he's
[1:02:27] called the son of predition the wicked
[1:02:28] one he's called the false
[1:02:33] prophet see so that day the Rapture
[1:02:37] won't uh I'm sorry
[1:02:38] uh which one is
[1:02:41] it yeah the Rapture won't happen until
[1:02:44] they fall away first and then the son of
[1:02:46] man I'm sorry the son of predition will
[1:02:48] be revealed who oppos and exalts himself
[1:02:50] above all that's called God or that's
[1:02:52] worshiped so that he as God sth in
[1:02:55] Temple Of God showing himself that he is
[1:02:56] God now Paul never says you're going to
[1:02:58] see that he just tells them what the
[1:03:00] Antichrist is going to do he's going to
[1:03:01] sit in the Jewish temple and say that
[1:03:04] he's God he's goingon to have all these
[1:03:06] lying Miracles they're going to have it
[1:03:07] on they're going to have it on their
[1:03:08] cell phones well look the pope did this
[1:03:10] look at this miracle the pope did look
[1:03:12] at that Miracle the pope did they're
[1:03:13] going to say look he's the he's God he's
[1:03:16] going to solve all of our financial
[1:03:17] problems our violence problems our
[1:03:18] safety problems uh our our clothing
[1:03:21] problems all these problems he's going
[1:03:22] to solve it because look he's a miracle
[1:03:23] worker I got the proof of it right here
[1:03:26] and Jesus said by their fruits they're
[1:03:29] known their lies and their false
[1:03:32] doctrines right and their deception
[1:03:34] they're known by their
[1:03:35] fruits Hallelujah verse five remember ye
[1:03:39] not that when I was yet with you I told
[1:03:40] you these things so Paul already told
[1:03:42] him face to face but he writes him
[1:03:44] another letter to let him
[1:03:45] know there has to come a falling way
[1:03:48] first then the son of man there
[1:03:50] something then the son of predition is
[1:03:53] revealed and now ye know what
[1:03:56] withholdeth that he might be revealed in
[1:03:58] his time so he says he says you know God
[1:04:01] is withholding this Antichrist from
[1:04:04] rising up until it's his time aren't you
[1:04:06] glad
[1:04:07] church I'm so glad God has withhold held
[1:04:10] the
[1:04:11] Antichrist he's going to do some
[1:04:12] terrible damage right he's do some
[1:04:16] terrible damage but God is withholding
[1:04:19] him so the church ages can go on this is
[1:04:22] he's been holding him for 2,000 years
[1:04:24] there's my hour going going try to close
[1:04:28] verse S for the mystery of iniquity that
[1:04:30] means lasciviousness or lawlessness or
[1:04:32] there's no law there's no rules in
[1:04:34] Christianity you can live however you
[1:04:35] want and Grace will be extended to you
[1:04:36] no
[1:04:37] sir right God will have Grace on you if
[1:04:39] you repent Hallelujah and you try to
[1:04:42] serve God for the mystery of iniquity
[1:04:44] doth already work Paul said it's already
[1:04:46] working this is written around 54
[1:04:49] ad right uh 24 years after Jesus had
[1:04:52] left the scene only he who now lth will
[1:04:54] let until he be taken out of the way so
[1:04:56] that means the Holy Spirit the holy
[1:04:58] spirit will let until the spirit of God
[1:05:00] is taken out of the
[1:05:03] way that's right because when God takes
[1:05:05] a spirit from the Gentiles what happens
[1:05:07] the spirit goes up right the Saints go
[1:05:09] up and then Satan comes
[1:05:13] down verse eight and then shall that
[1:05:16] Wicked be revealed so see once the Holy
[1:05:18] Ghost is taken out of the way then that
[1:05:21] Wicked one's revealed the church said
[1:05:23] right there's the proof Paul never said
[1:05:26] that we see the Antichrist Paul said the
[1:05:29] Holy Ghost is taken away and then the
[1:05:31] wicked one is revealed that's just like
[1:05:33] brother randam
[1:05:35] talked the the bride goes up Satan comes
[1:05:38] down because he knows he has a short
[1:05:41] season that's right Church
[1:05:44] Hallelujah never one time does Paul say
[1:05:46] well well Church you're going to see the
[1:05:48] Antichrist he never said that he just
[1:05:50] tells the conditions of when the
[1:05:52] Antichrist
[1:05:54] comes yeah
[1:05:56] yes and then verse 8 and then shall that
[1:05:59] Wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall
[1:06:01] consume with the spirit of his mouth and
[1:06:03] shall destroy him with the brightness of
[1:06:04] a coming when that that's
[1:06:06] Armageddon right remember at the end of
[1:06:09] Armageddon what does he do he throws the
[1:06:10] Antichrist in the Lake of Fire H
[1:06:13] Allelujah and the Beast right the false
[1:06:16] prophet and the Beast get thrown in the
[1:06:18] lake of fire at the at
[1:06:19] Armageddon Hallelujah verse n even him
[1:06:23] Who coming is after the working of Satan
[1:06:26] with all power and signs and lying
[1:06:29] wonders see all these false prophets
[1:06:31] today you've seen them do it have you
[1:06:32] seen them do it they have people in
[1:06:34] wheelchairs come up and they abuse these
[1:06:36] people in wheelchairs they make them
[1:06:38] stand up and say oh God's going to heal
[1:06:39] you look they took a few steps and they
[1:06:40] sit them down and say oh you're going to
[1:06:41] get healed eventually and they're just
[1:06:43] hurting these people they never get well
[1:06:46] or I've seen it where they pray for them
[1:06:47] and they you know how you they pray for
[1:06:49] them and they fall over apparently they
[1:06:51] pray for the people in wheelchairs and
[1:06:53] they fall over and everybody rejoices
[1:06:54] and they pick them up and they're not
[1:06:55] even
[1:06:57] healed right the Bible says false
[1:07:00] prophets are God's judgment on the
[1:07:02] people because they love lies and so God
[1:07:05] gives them what they
[1:07:06] want so that means a real preacher is
[1:07:09] God's gift to us amen hallelujah brother
[1:07:12] R was God's gift to us
[1:07:15] hallelujah it's exactly right verse 10
[1:07:18] and with all deceivable of
[1:07:20] unrighteousness in them that perish
[1:07:22] because they receive not the love of the
[1:07:24] truth that they might be saved see all
[1:07:26] these people that take the Antichrist
[1:07:28] they're they're going to love
[1:07:29] unrighteousness they don't want the
[1:07:31] truth that's why God is allowing them to
[1:07:34] get the Antichrist because they don't
[1:07:36] love the word they don't care about the
[1:07:40] word they didn't receive the love of the
[1:07:43] truth verse 11 and for this cause God
[1:07:46] shall send them strong delusion think
[1:07:48] God is going to send them a
[1:07:50] lie yes if Church even if us us in here
[1:07:53] because we've seen it we've seen people
[1:07:55] turn from the message and leave if even
[1:07:58] us if we don't receive the truth and we
[1:07:59] don't want the truth God will give us
[1:08:01] the lie that we want I'm saying we
[1:08:03] because we had people leave this church
[1:08:05] that believe lies
[1:08:07] now God's not going to force anybody to
[1:08:09] believe you got to want to believe you
[1:08:11] got to love the truth
[1:08:13] hallelujah that's Stern that's that's
[1:08:15] that's that's that that that's strict
[1:08:17] but that's the truth
[1:08:18] hallelujah God actually gives them a
[1:08:21] reprobate mind and gives them the lie
[1:08:23] that they want to believe God help us to
[1:08:25] receive the
[1:08:28] truth God will give them the strong
[1:08:30] delusion they want that's what they want
[1:08:33] because they won't receive the love of
[1:08:35] the truth that they should believe a lie
[1:08:38] God God sent that lying Spirit right to
[1:08:41] the four the the Hebrew I'm sorry the uh
[1:08:43] Baal prophets with Micaiah right God
[1:08:46] sent that lying
[1:08:47] Spirit right the Bible said the evil
[1:08:49] spirit from the Lord went on Saul and
[1:08:52] troubled him because he wanted it
[1:08:58] verse 12 that they all might be damned
[1:09:01] who believe not the truth but had
[1:09:04] pleasure in unrighteous we better be
[1:09:05] very careful that we're lovers of God
[1:09:08] and not lovers of pleasures of this
[1:09:11] world and the church
[1:09:13] said we got to be very careful I got
[1:09:16] much as much as I love going to the
[1:09:17] movies like The the Christian movies all
[1:09:18] these things much as I love things like
[1:09:20] that I got to have more of my pleasure
[1:09:22] in the word of God and I do amen
[1:09:24] hallelujah that's why we have three
[1:09:26] service three times a week amen
[1:09:28] hallelujah we're not going to movies
[1:09:30] every week or every once a year once
[1:09:32] every two years you know it's very rare
[1:09:34] because we love the things of God more
[1:09:36] than the pleasures
[1:09:38] amen that's right church that's a
[1:09:40] balance we got to have we got to be so
[1:09:42] overloaded with we love God we love
[1:09:44] worship we love praising we love
[1:09:45] preaching even preaching Hallelujah we
[1:09:48] ought to amen we got to love preaching
[1:09:50] we got to love praying we got to love
[1:09:52] reading our Bibles we got to love
[1:09:53] listening to brother Bram we got to love
[1:09:55] the things of God and hate the things of
[1:09:57] the world the fear of the Lord
[1:09:59] hallelujah
[1:10:02] amen so again now that's the second
[1:10:04] proof not one time did I ever say
[1:10:06] there's no such thing as a
[1:10:07] pre-tribulation Rapture and yet that's
[1:10:09] what these people they're kind-hearted
[1:10:10] people but I'm just proving to you
[1:10:12] that's a recent attack on our Scofield
[1:10:15] bible amen and the doctrine that there
[1:10:18] is a pre-tribulation
[1:10:20] Rapture Hallelujah let's stand to our
[1:10:22] feet musicians can come there is a a
[1:10:25] pre-tribulation
[1:10:28] Rapture I didn't expect to be so Stern
[1:10:30] tonight but that I trust that's the Holy
[1:10:32] Spirit I trust
[1:10:33] that I trust
[1:10:36] that because if we won't receive the
[1:10:38] love of the truth then God will give us
[1:10:40] the lie that we
[1:10:42] want Hallelujah let's have hearts that
[1:10:44] only want the truth of God's
[1:10:46] word let's not have preachers that let's
[1:10:49] not want preachers that'll just itch our
[1:10:50] ears and tell us what we want to hear
[1:10:52] let's have a preacher that'll tell us
[1:10:53] what the Bible says amen Hallelujah the
[1:10:56] part that applies to
[1:10:58] us amen all right let's bow our heart
[1:11:07] here the coming of the lord The Rapture
[1:11:10] of mystery just play that Just Want to
[1:11:11] Thank You Lord just play that for
[1:11:13] letting me hear your word praise
[1:11:16] God
[1:11:19] hallelujah
[1:11:22] hallelujah Saints as we bow Our Hearts
[1:11:24] Let's examine in our lives here let's
[1:11:26] make sure that we only want to believe
[1:11:27] the
[1:11:29] truth if we went back eight years ago
[1:11:32] and someone said well this brother
[1:11:33] sister is going to leave the church I
[1:11:34] say no way they believe the message
[1:11:35] they've been the message so long no
[1:11:39] way and yet they opened up their hearts
[1:11:42] to a lie of the devil and the devil
[1:11:44] harpazo the truth right out of their
[1:11:48] hearts my goodness
[1:11:51] [Music]
[1:11:55] let's do like Jesus said let's dig down
[1:11:57] deep and make sure that our foundation
[1:12:00] is on a
[1:12:02] rock my Foundation is on the word of God

[1:12:07] couple of months ago I told Brother
[1:12:09] Austin about it too you when when when
[1:12:11] when we've had people leave I told
