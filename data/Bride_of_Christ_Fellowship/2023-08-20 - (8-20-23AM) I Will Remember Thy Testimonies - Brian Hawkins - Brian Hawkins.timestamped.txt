[0:40] . I told brother Jesse in the back there
[0:42] and I said well I was kind of looking at
[0:45] something yesterday and on the way here

[0:51] changed my mind so

[0:56] right Channel with the Lord amen
[0:59] so
[1:03] noticing that song
[1:06] that we're you know do not pass me by
[1:09] it's the humility when we can when we
[1:12] can come with that humility in our
[1:13] hearts amen that's that's where we can
[1:16] call upon the Lord
[1:19] starting in the 129th verse of Psalm 119
[1:24] it says thy testimonies are wonderful
[1:26] therefore doth my soul keep them
[1:29] the entrance of thy words or Revelation
[1:32] the the revelation of thy words the
[1:34] entrance of thy words giveth light
[1:36] Hallelujah it giveth understanding unto
[1:39] the simple amen let's look to the Lord
[1:41] in prayer amen what I'd like to speak on
[1:44] this morning is I will not forget your
[1:47] testimonies
[1:49] most gracious Heavenly Father we just
[1:51] thank you so much for what you've done
[1:53] for us we thank you for giving us safe
[1:54] travels this morning
[1:56] just pray that you would bless the
[1:59] effort that's been made to be here this
[2:02] morning
[2:02] just as we come and administer your word
[2:05] we just pray that you would help us uh
[2:09] help us that you would give us strength
[2:10] that you would also give us
[2:11] understanding uh through the entrance of
[2:14] of your words into our ears for Faith
[2:16] cometh by hearing and by the hearing of
[2:18] your word father we just ask that you
[2:21] would help us spiritually natural
[2:23] natural in our natural bodies this
[2:25] morning as well father Yes and uh just
[2:28] ask that you would give us strength help
[2:30] us to see more of you and uh Lord we
[2:33] just pray that you would increase the
[2:34] desire more for you oh God we read into
[2:38] your scripture that the Deep calleth
[2:39] unto the Deep so Lord if we're if our
[2:41] soul is calling out for something that
[2:43] there is something more to be had oh God
[2:45] we know that you are inexhaustible
[2:48] the Lord we just call upon you in the
[2:50] name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you
[2:51] would be with us here this morning bless
[2:53] each one that's made the effort to come
[2:55] and Jesus Christ's name we do pray amen
[2:57] amen amen
[3:02] we've been kind of struggling uh with
[3:05] sickness the past couple weeks
[3:07] no
[3:08] that the Lord will help us through
[3:11] if my voice gives out which I don't
[3:13] think it will well we'll keep going amen
[3:17] amen hopefully you can hear a whisper
[3:19] but we're not going to give up amen
[3:21] hallelujah so as we read there in uh at
[3:26] 1 30 the entrance of thy words talking
[3:28] about Revelation amen when we read the
[3:31] scripture uh some people just read the
[3:34] scripture and it's just words on the
[3:36] page
[3:37] uh so it might not mean something to to
[3:40] others where others that might be able
[3:42] to have that the others that have that
[3:44] light
[3:45] or the revelation
[3:47] how wonderful it is and the more that we
[3:50] could see God
[3:51] amen so the more we read in the words
[3:55] the more that we receive the word the
[3:58] more Revelation that we'll have and it
[4:00] even it says give it under understanding
[4:02] unto the simple and to the simple it
[4:05] means to the inexperienced or to the
[4:07] naive it can instruct them in their ways
[4:10] amen amen that they wouldn't be in that
[4:12] in in that condition anymore so thy
[4:15] testimonies are wonderful I love how uh
[4:19] it starts out there uh it's saying that
[4:22] that their thy testimonies are wonderful
[4:24] therefore doth my soul keep them see we
[4:27] love the Lord's word right see
[4:28] testimonies we we often think of
[4:30] testimonies of of something that's
[4:32] happened and I could testify because I
[4:35] saw something happen so therefore I
[4:37] could testify to the situation that I
[4:39] saw happen the testimonies here is
[4:42] talking about statutes and precepts so
[4:44] he's saying that thy statutes and nice
[4:47] thy precepts all these things that I'm
[4:49] reading here your law even so we know
[4:52] that the letter killeth right right and
[4:54] we live in Grace but Grace is developed
[4:57] through the law right yes because we
[5:00] couldn't fulfill the law so now we've
[5:02] therefore we've receive Grace because he
[5:04] knew that we couldn't uphold all the law
[5:06] because we're human beings we we fall
[5:08] short we fail all the time right so not
[5:12] one of us can live absolute the the law
[5:14] not one of us can live it right so we
[5:18] need that Grace so therefore he's saying
[5:20] thy testimonies are wonderful I love
[5:22] these things because it keeps me pure
[5:24] it's going to keep me unspotted from the
[5:26] things of the world it's going to keep
[5:28] me from sin because if I say that I fall
[5:31] short of thy testimony or if I fall
[5:33] short of thy law or thy statute or thy
[5:36] precept if I fall short of that I feel
[5:39] vexed of my soul because I know I did
[5:41] something wrong right so therefore I
[5:44] love it because it corrects me it shows
[5:46] me the right path Amen
[5:50] to my path right amen so thy testimonies
[5:53] are wonderful I love thy precepts
[5:56] because it gives me that instruction it
[5:58] tells me how to be righteous even though
[6:01] I fall short and I can't be that
[6:03] righteousness because our filthy or our
[6:06] righteousness is filthy rags right so
[6:08] therefore we love these precepts because
[6:11] it gives us that instruction remember I
[6:13] I spoke about phylacteries here uh
[6:15] several years ago about they were the
[6:18] Jews would wear the the leather box on
[6:20] their on their forehead and on their arm
[6:21] they would have it wrapped around with
[6:23] with scripture that would remind them
[6:26] because uh uh I think it was an exodus
[6:29] where it said write these down for your
[6:31] children to remind them to instruct them
[6:35] and forget not these precepts
[6:38] put them as frontlets put them always
[6:41] before your face amen as a reminder
[6:47] as a reminder to keep your feet steady
[6:50] as a reminder to keep steadfast
[6:54] for when we say that we we when we see
[6:57] that we have that fault and that failure
[7:00] we've reached out we call out to the
[7:01] Lord right Hallelujah and we ask them
[7:04] Lord forgive me
[7:05] yes amen amen so if you want to turn
[7:08] with me to First Peter chapter 4 and
[7:10] verse 12.
[7:19] it says beloved thinking not strange
[7:22] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[7:25] try you as though some strange thing
[7:27] happened to you but rejoice
[7:31] but rejoice in as much as your partakers
[7:34] of Christ's sufferings
[7:36] whoa wait a second how is it that I'm
[7:39] gonna partake and be a partaker of
[7:41] Christ's sufferings through persecution
[7:43] through living through through living
[7:45] this word people are going to look at
[7:46] you as an odd type of person you're
[7:48] gonna you're gonna look uh a little bit
[7:50] weird to the rest of the world
[7:53] right so as you continue on you are a
[7:55] partaker with Christ in his sufferings
[7:57] right so but rejoice in as much as you
[8:00] are partakers of Christ's sufferings
[8:02] that when his glory shall be revealed
[8:05] you may be glad with exceeding Joy
[8:10] if you be reproached for the name of
[8:12] Christ happy are ye for the spirit of
[8:15] glory and of God resteth upon you on
[8:18] their part
[8:19] on their part
[8:22] he is evil spoken of but on your part
[8:26] he is glorified amen amen see that's the
[8:30] separation of the serpent seat in the
[8:32] god seed
[8:33] see the serpent seed it can't he can't
[8:35] worship God Amen
[8:38] it just won't do it
[8:41] right for we know that that the Lord
[8:43] spoke to Cain and said hey if you come
[8:45] as able
[8:47] because Abel did a good work if you come
[8:50] as able then you should do well right
[8:52] right but if you don't
[8:54] send life at the door right
[8:58] so he couldn't come as a as the
[9:00] righteous seed see there's a separation
[9:03] there see on the wicked end it's it's
[9:06] evil spoken of
[9:08] that's on their part but on our part he
[9:11] is glorified because there's something
[9:13] within us that can't help but praise the
[9:15] Lord
[9:18] but let none of you suffer as a murderer
[9:21] or as a thief or as an evil doer or as a
[9:24] busybody in other men's matters see if
[9:26] it's minding your own business that's a
[9:28] whole another subject yes sir
[9:31] but yet if any man suffer as a Christian
[9:35] let him not be ashamed
[9:39] but let him glorify God on this behalf
[9:44] for the time has come that judgment
[9:47] that judgment must begin at the house of
[9:50] God yes amen and if it first begin in us
[9:54] what shall the end be of them that obey
[9:57] not the gospel of God right right see
[9:59] judgment must begin at the house of God
[10:02] the correction through the word through
[10:04] the reading of testimonies right
[10:07] through Reading of precepts
[10:10] through hearing of other people's
[10:12] testimonies testifying of what God has
[10:15] done in their lives right amen see we
[10:18] have testimonies as precepts we have
[10:20] testimonies as an eyewitness an account
[10:22] yes amen but I will not forget your
[10:26] testimonies I will not forget
[10:28] testimonies I will not forget what he
[10:31] has done in my life amen
[10:33] we've all had a wondrous work in our
[10:35] life right I could say that can we all
[10:38] say that we've all had a wondrous work
[10:40] God has proof in our life one way or
[10:42] another have you forgotten that or is
[10:44] that something magnificent in your eyes
[10:46] is that something that you will glorify
[10:48] God in so we will not forget his
[10:51] testimonies amen but I will always
[10:54] glorify God I will always give God
[10:57] thanks
[10:59] because there was Deliverance that was
[11:01] happening amen there was something that
[11:04] I had obtained I used to live a life
[11:06] like this I might I might have lived a
[11:08] life in drags I might have lived a life
[11:10] than alcohol I might have lived a life
[11:12] being lost right but now I am found and
[11:16] that is a testimony of God amen amen
[11:20] [Applause]
[11:22] the word is corrected so when that
[11:25] precept comes and it lands in our ears
[11:27] the entrance of the words that come in
[11:29] and it says that word is truth amen
[11:33] therefore I will submit unto that word I
[11:36] will surrender unto the holy spirit amen
[11:39] because Thy word is truth my my life up
[11:43] until now until I heard the Revelation
[11:45] my life has been a lie
[11:50] but now I see the truth amen amen
[11:57] and it's through humility
[11:59] God can't do that through Pride right
[12:01] amen
[12:03] for Pride goeth Before Destruction The
[12:05] Pride goeth before and fall
[12:11] so if it first begin in us what shall
[12:13] the end be of them that obey not the
[12:15] gospel of God and if the righteous
[12:18] scarcely be saved where shall their
[12:21] ungodly and The Sinner appear
[12:26] wherefore let them that suffer according
[12:28] to the will of God commit the keeping of
[12:30] their souls to him and well doing
[12:34] as unto a faithful Creator amen yeah I
[12:38] say we we we we all go through our
[12:41] trials we all have our tests we all have
[12:43] our Temptations we all have uh the these
[12:46] our fiery trials or whatever it might be
[12:48] we all have our shortcomings in our
[12:50] lives right so uh uh a lot of people
[12:53] will say well I'm just I'm just so tired
[12:55] of living
[12:57] and you might think well how could how
[12:59] can somebody be tired of living I mean
[13:01] living is just living how could you be
[13:03] tired of living
[13:04] because somebody uh until you walk into
[13:08] a a mile in another man's moccasins as
[13:11] the old inner proverb is uh How would
[13:13] how would you know how a man feels
[13:15] unless you walked in the same steps or
[13:17] felt the same sorrow do we not have a
[13:20] high priest that that could feel the our
[13:22] infirmities amen that's right so he
[13:25] knows how we feel he knows the struggles
[13:27] that we go through he knows our sorrows
[13:29] he knows our jealousies he he knows our
[13:32] struggles he knows our Temptations He
[13:34] knows our fallings our shortcomings he
[13:36] know all these things he knows how we
[13:38] can feel right yes
[13:41] he could feel the desperation that a
[13:44] human being could feel right
[13:46] right amen
[13:47] so when we there there are people that
[13:50] just get so tired of living they just
[13:52] want to end it because they feel that
[13:53] it's that it's better for them to be off
[13:55] this Earth and nobody will notice that
[13:57] they're missing that's nonsense because
[13:58] somebody out there loves you somebody
[14:01] out there will take notice of you you
[14:04] are more valuable than what you put your
[14:07] the what you think you are right
[14:11] when somebody uh takes their own life it
[14:15] it you know because they think that
[14:17] their life is so worthless they don't
[14:18] realize the effect that it has on
[14:20] friends and family right
[14:23] right have friends and family those are
[14:25] people that care
[14:28] well then you might be able to refute
[14:29] that and say well if they cared so much
[14:32] how come they didn't talk to me as as
[14:33] much as and it you know that's that's a
[14:36] valid question how come we don't
[14:42] because we get complacent yes Things
[14:45] become become so common in our lives
[14:48] that we just get so busy in the hustle
[14:50] and bustle of life that we tend to
[14:52] forget other things because we're
[14:53] concerned about ourselves right right
[14:55] yeah but when that compassion comes oh
[14:58] my God how we can how we can feel
[15:01] somebody else's infirmities and we can
[15:03] we can have that compassion amen
[15:05] amen that we can reach down and talk to
[15:07] somebody hey you have more worth
[15:10] that's right you're worth something to
[15:12] me you really mean something to me

[15:37] seeing you today see how different a
[15:40] type one type of a word or what type of
[15:42] an action heck can have an impact on
[15:44] somebody's life right yes but say we get
[15:47] so tired of and I get so tired of
[15:49] falling I get so tired of failing I get
[15:51] so tired of saying the wrong things I

[16:07] I'm tired of being a failure I'm tired
[16:09] of being a burden I'm tired of not being
[16:11] good looking enough I'm tired of not
[16:13] being uh cool enough
[16:18] right you know it's these different
[16:19] things and and and and I know I'm
[16:21] talking I'm kind of talking into the
[16:23] into the youth a little bit because
[16:24] that's you know we've kind of outgrown
[16:26] that a little bit I think you know we're
[16:27] not thinking of how of how cool we are
[16:30] anymore but
[16:32] we've got to pass that phase yes but now
[16:36] we're looking how can I support my
[16:37] family I mean that's that's what I think
[16:39] about is how am I going to provide for
[16:41] my family what am I going to do for my
[16:43] family amen
[16:44] you know do we fall short sometimes you
[16:46] you bet
[16:47] I fall short of my family not of the
[16:50] provision's sake but in in other areas
[16:52] yeah I I fall short you know
[16:55] I get tired of working I get tired of
[16:57] bills I get tired of this I I get tired
[16:59] of overpaid taxes you know who doesn't
[17:01] get tired of that one yeah who can't
[17:03] relate to that right everybody can
[17:05] relate to that one I'm sick of taxes
[17:08] but hey that's something that we have to
[17:10] do
[17:10] yes sir yo you might just you might say
[17:13] well I'm tired of criticism I'm tired of
[17:15] this I'm tired of that
[17:17] I just get so sick and tired of of
[17:20] just feeling blah I'm tired of being
[17:23] sick I'm tired of being this I'm I'm
[17:25] tired of people coming to me you see
[17:27] what I mean right it's just there's just
[17:29] so much stress in this day there's so
[17:32] much that's put upon us right yes
[17:36] amen yes sir but it doesn't matter
[17:39] what's going on
[17:41] right
[17:43] our Trials come and go our trials change
[17:46] our situations change right but there's
[17:49] one thing that's unchangeable
[17:52] and that's our God
[17:57] so we should be tired we should be tired
[17:59] of these things right because it shows
[18:02] that our desires for him
[18:06] yo and we fall short when we when we
[18:08] fall into sin we fall into temptation
[18:10] and we just oh Lord I am so sorry how
[18:13] could I do something like that
[18:16] and we get tired of it yeah how many
[18:18] times how many is tired of falling I'm
[18:21] tired of doing the wrong things right
[18:23] but we all can't live the precepts we
[18:26] can't live the perfect life all the time
[18:29] yeah that's right
[18:30] so we have to accept that we are going
[18:32] to have failures
[18:34] yes but there's one that could pick us
[18:36] up
[18:45] but it just goes to show that our
[18:47] desires for him
[18:48] for you want to do right you don't want
[18:50] to do wrong you don't you don't go out
[18:52] of your way to do wrong that's what the
[18:54] wicked do right that's that's what
[18:56] they're that's what their portion is is
[18:58] they go out and they willingly do wrong
[19:01] right but that's not what the righteous
[19:04] seed wants to do
[19:06] right yeah there are times when we fall
[19:07] into that and you you might think to
[19:10] yourself you well you know what
[19:12] just this one time
[19:14] and then you feel so bad because what
[19:16] was I doing that was so stupid yes right
[19:19] why did I do that I know better yeah
[19:22] right yes right
[19:26] because a lot of people look at that
[19:27] scriptures those that willfully sin
[19:30] there is no more sacrifice for them and
[19:33] then people think well there's well
[19:35] there's no more for me I send my day
[19:37] away
[19:41] but if you willfully if you're casting
[19:44] his precepts behind you that's the
[19:46] difference
[19:47] right but when you could say Lord I am
[19:50] sorry if you could humble yourself and
[19:52] say Lord I'm sorry please correct me
[19:55] please guide my steps that I don't make
[19:57] that wrong move anymore I don't want to
[20:00] do those things amen amen but see
[20:03] we should yeah we get down because we do
[20:06] those things but don't stay down
[20:08] but rejoice
[20:11] not in not in the sin that you fell into
[20:13] but Rejoice that he's made a way for you
[20:15] to come out of it amen but Rejoice that
[20:18] you are a partaker of his sufferings
[20:21] amen right
[20:24] you know
[20:26] I've noticed I'm not an expert by any
[20:29] means I am no expert so this is just my
[20:31] uh this is just something that I've
[20:34] noticed you know depression is one of
[20:36] the hardest demons out there
[20:38] to defeat
[20:40] to battle
[20:41] yeah right depression is a hard it's a
[20:44] hard Spirit to battle it really is
[20:46] but but you know it's not unbeatable
[20:49] right amen it's very well beatable and
[20:54] you don't have to stay in that condition
[20:56] amen what usually gets us into that
[20:58] depression
[21:00] somebody's criticism of how they view US
[21:05] Our Faults Are failures because we fall
[21:07] into the into something or we we look at
[21:09] others
[21:10] every well I can't match up to somebody
[21:13] else I can't preach like some other
[21:15] brothers can preach
[21:17] but that's just the way it is
[21:19] yeah I can't I can't play guitar like
[21:21] you brother
[21:22] I could grab a guitar I could play a few
[21:24] chords and there's no way I could play a
[21:26] piano that's just way out there I can't
[21:29] do it
[21:31] but that's where each one has a
[21:33] different gift so we shouldn't be
[21:35] looking unto somebody else's gift we
[21:37] should be should be praying about our
[21:39] gift yes amen Lord what is my gift that
[21:42] I could give unto the world
[21:44] what is my gift that I could get busy
[21:46] and and just
[21:49] sharing what my gift is right
[21:53] right we shouldn't be looking under
[21:54] somebody else's gift something that we
[21:56] have and not into somebody some other
[21:58] men's batters but we should be looking
[22:00] into our own matters minding our own
[22:03] business right taking care of our own
[22:05] household taking care of our own lives
[22:07] right
[22:08] seeking our own salvation with fear and
[22:12] trembling men
[22:15] for how we live our lives
[22:17] or how other people live their lives has
[22:19] no bearing on what where our Salvation
[22:22] lies that's right amen amen
[22:26] so it's our relationship with him
[22:29] amen
[22:31] do you love his testimonies do you love
[22:33] the work that he's doing in your life
[22:36] love to read the word amen
[22:40] but you know
[22:42] yeah we get into those conditions yo
[22:45] he's not going to throw you away just
[22:48] because you just because you you
[22:50] sidestepped a a precept you know because
[22:54] you fell into temptation he's not going
[22:55] to throw you away because of something
[22:57] like that
[22:58] right because if he did that then all
[23:00] the heroes in the Bible wouldn't be
[23:01] heroes of the Bible right amen
[23:05] but if you read through from Genesis to
[23:08] Revelation those that we consider Heroes
[23:10] of the Bible you look back and you look
[23:12] at their struggles right they're men
[23:14] just like us
[23:17] and women there are men and women
[23:20] children just like us right right but
[23:25] see we put so much on ourselves that I
[23:28] need to do this I need to do that
[23:32] where's our trust in the Lord did not
[23:35] job say though he slay me
[23:37] I will trust in him amen amen right but
[23:41] he said I will plead my cause
[23:43] we're not going to try to justify
[23:45] ourselves
[23:46] we're going to say hey Lord I was wrong
[23:48] amen that's how you plead your cause
[23:52] amen
[23:55] you know John 14 and 1 says Jesus said
[23:58] let not your heart be troubled you
[24:00] believe in God believe also in me
[24:03] Hallelujah and we know that Jesus was
[24:05] the was the word and that he was made
[24:08] flesh to dwelt Among Us right amen and
[24:10] we also know that he took captivity
[24:12] captive he took your enemies as
[24:14] prisoners right so when he ascended on
[24:17] high he led captivity captive and he
[24:20] gave gifts unto men
[24:21] right but you know before he ascended he
[24:25] had to descend
[24:26] before the Ascension there had to be a
[24:29] dissection
[24:30] right into the lower parts of the Earth
[24:32] right right so before he before he was
[24:35] raised up he had to be brought down low
[24:38] and you know when he was brought down
[24:40] low when he had that when he went
[24:42] through that dissension he went through
[24:43] the depths of the Earth
[24:45] that's where he took captivity captive
[24:48] because he took the keys away from Satan
[24:50] right the case that's right it just took
[24:52] it it just took the authority away from
[24:54] Death hell on the grave amen amen so he
[24:57] took captivity captive he took that for
[24:59] us amen amen amen but when he descended
[25:01] he took death hell on the grave captive
[25:03] he bound Satan to where you were made
[25:06] free and he took Satan's Keys amen
[25:09] he gave men gifts
[25:11] which is what the fivefold ministry that
[25:15] certain people want to do away with you
[25:16] know they say we don't need Ephesians 4
[25:18] anymore they don't specify a certain
[25:20] portion of the Ephesians 4 they just
[25:22] specify Ephesians 4 yeah well we don't
[25:25] need Ephesians 4 anymore
[25:28] well that's that's taking away from
[25:30] scripture right right that's taking away
[25:33] a precept
[25:36] that's taking away
[25:39] part of the word of of the Lord amen
[25:42] for a specific instruction
[25:46] for the fivefold ministry
[25:48] and what what was it given for it was
[25:51] given for the perfecting of the Saints
[25:53] for the work of the ministry
[25:56] [Music]
[25:57] for the edifying
[26:00] of the body of Christ
[26:05] till we all
[26:07] come
[26:09] in the unity
[26:13] glory of the faith not a Unity of
[26:17] Doctrine not a Unity of denomination
[26:20] right right but the unity of faith and
[26:26] of the knowledge of the son
[26:29] so there's more to it than just a
[26:31] five-fold Ministry
[26:35] because when you take trying to take
[26:37] that out you're taking Christ out
[26:38] because it's giving the knowledge of the
[26:41] Son of God amen amen
[26:44] amen run to a perfect man unto the
[26:46] measure of the stature of the fullness
[26:48] of Christ
[26:50] I see it was there to to make us unified
[26:54] and to stand strong against the storms
[26:56] of adversity and false teaching right
[27:01] rightly dividing the word of truth right
[27:05] that's what the fivefold ministry is for
[27:08] hallelujah it's not to say well I'm an
[27:10] apostle and another one saying well I'm
[27:12] a pastor I'm a preacher I'm an
[27:14] evangelist it's not just for somebody to
[27:16] celebrate in
[27:19] so we can look that they have a
[27:21] distinguished gift
[27:26] because if you say
[27:28] that I love the Lord's word that I will
[27:31] obey the Commandments
[27:33] isn't that a commandment to go ye out
[27:35] into the world and to preach the gospel
[27:38] and how beautiful are the feet that
[27:40] those that that go and preach the gospel
[27:44] how can anybody hear the word unless
[27:46] somebody be sent
[27:51] sorry brother
[27:53] keep preaching amen good
[27:56] that's where it lies Hallelujah
[28:00] Ephesians 4 14.
[28:03] and this is an important aspect of that
[28:06] that we henceforth
[28:08] be no more children
[28:10] tossed to and fro
[28:13] carried about with every wind of
[28:15] Doctrine by the slight of men and
[28:17] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[28:19] wait to deceive
[28:21] all right so we received this
[28:23] instruction that we won't be deceived
[28:26] that we could recognize false Doctrine
[28:30] all right
[28:31] but speaking the truth and what
[28:34] in love
[28:38] not come and condemning somebody with
[28:40] the scripture because we we talked about
[28:42] how the letter killeth right
[28:46] but we also must have some Grace amen
[28:50] but speaking the truth and love may grow
[28:53] up into him in all things which is the
[28:55] head even Christ
[28:57] from whom the whole body fitly joined
[29:00] together and compacted by that which
[29:02] every joint supplies according to the
[29:04] effectual working in the measure of
[29:07] every part
[29:09] making the increase of the body unto the
[29:12] edifying of itself in love
[29:15] now what did John say when when uh John
[29:18] the Baptist what did he say
[29:20] when Jesus came and it was time for for
[29:23] John to kind of take a back seat he said
[29:25] I must decrease
[29:28] so what so he can increase
[29:31] yeah right so let's read that 16th verse
[29:34] there again from whom the whole body
[29:36] fiddly joined together and compacted by
[29:39] that which uh every joint supplies
[29:42] coming together
[29:45] if we have swelled up
[29:48] if we have an inflammation in the body
[29:50] it's not going to be fitly joined
[29:52] together
[29:54] if one person has increased so much the
[29:57] next one isn't going to fitly join
[29:59] together
[30:00] so we all must decrease so all of us
[30:03] coming together we can increase
[30:06] because we are fitly joined by Christ
[30:09] amen amen amen
[30:12] so according to the effectual working in
[30:14] the measure of every part
[30:16] make an increase of the body not
[30:20] individual but increase of the body unto
[30:23] the edifying of itself
[30:27] amen
[30:30] this is a body Ministry I can't I can't
[30:34] be here without you and you can't be
[30:36] here without me amen
[30:38] renate each other
[30:41] that's what the word is for that we
[30:43] could come together that we can unify
[30:45] that we can come
[30:46] what would it have been if they would if
[30:48] they would have gone and they would have
[30:51] waited 10 days
[30:53] and each one was in their own mind
[30:57] would they have celebrated a Pentecost
[31:00] they print they'd probably be still
[31:02] fighting about the color runs they're
[31:03] going again you know but what color
[31:05] they're gonna paint the wall
[31:07] but they they put everything aside amen
[31:11] amen they put differences aside
[31:14] and their trust in the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:18] right for that's where the Holy Spirit
[31:20] came down
[31:21] and that's where the change happened
[31:23] hallelujah amen amen
[31:28] where we depend on him right yes
[31:31] I won't be too much longer
[31:34] if you would turn to Psalm 50.
[31:40] but this is a body Ministry
[31:44] for one
[31:46] one planet
[31:48] one watereth
[31:50] but God gives the increase
[31:55] so we all have our own gift and when we
[31:57] bring those gifts together what a
[32:00] melodious sound it makes amen amen the
[32:03] Clapping of the hands the playing of the
[32:04] organ the playing of the piano the
[32:06] playing of the guitar
[32:08] and even The Stomping of the feet it all
[32:10] comes together and a little bit of dance
[32:13] right
[32:14] it makes me want to dance
[32:21] psalm 50.
[32:23] starting the first verse
[32:25] now this is a song of ASAP this isn't
[32:28] this isn't David writing this this is
[32:30] one of the one of the he was a he was a
[32:33] worship leader he was one who was
[32:34] appointed by King David uh to be a
[32:36] worship leader amen so that I think he
[32:39] might have wrote the about 12 12 of
[32:42] those songs or something like that I
[32:43] can't remember I didn't really do a
[32:45] thorough study on it uh I'm not much of
[32:47] a history buff but
[32:49] what I learned I'll try to share with
[32:51] you
[32:52] um
[32:53] so in some of ASAP the Mighty God even
[32:56] the Lord has spoken and called the Earth
[32:58] from the rising of the sun unto the
[33:00] going down thereof
[33:01] out of Zion the Perfection of beauty God
[33:04] has shunned
[33:06] Our God shall come
[33:08] and shall not keep silence a fire shall
[33:10] devour before him and it shall be very
[33:12] tempestuous round about him that means a
[33:15] raging fire
[33:16] amen he shall call to the heavens from
[33:20] above and to the Earth that he may judge
[33:22] his people
[33:24] gather my Saints together unto me
[33:27] those that have made a covenant with me
[33:30] by sacrifice
[33:32] see if you notice in the fourth verse he
[33:34] says he shall call to the heavens from
[33:36] above
[33:37] and to the Earth
[33:39] that he may judge his people he's going
[33:41] to gather all of his Saints those that
[33:45] are up in glory and those that are here
[33:48] and alive and remain
[33:50] amen amen sounds like the Rapture right
[33:53] yeah it sounds like it sounds like
[33:55] coming together with the Lord
[33:57] amen
[33:58] so gather my Saints together unto me
[34:02] Glory those that have made a covenant
[34:05] with me by sacrifice
[34:07] well you might say well this is Old
[34:08] Testament I can identify through this
[34:10] through the sacrifice of the blood of
[34:12] bulls and ghosts but there was one
[34:14] sacrifice that did away with the bulls
[34:16] and goats amen so you you have right up
[34:20] to this passage because you do have a
[34:22] sacrifice amen amen you have the perfect
[34:24] lamb
[34:28] and the heavens shall declare his
[34:30] righteousness for God has judged himself
[34:33] here o my people and I will speak o
[34:36] Israel
[34:37] and I will testify against thee I am God
[34:40] even thy God I will not reprove thee
[34:43] from for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
[34:45] offerings to have been continually
[34:47] before me
[34:49] I will take no Bullock out of thy house
[34:51] nor he goes out of thy folds for every
[34:55] beast of the forest is mine and the
[34:58] cattle Upon A Thousand Hills
[35:01] say we often recite that our Lord owns a
[35:03] cattle on a thousand hills but he's even
[35:05] richer than that
[35:07] he's got more than a cattle on a
[35:10] thousand hills amen yeah
[35:11] for he said for every beast of the
[35:13] forest in my
[35:18] area
[35:19] I know all the fouls of the mountains
[35:22] and the wild beasts of the field are
[35:24] mine
[35:25] if I were hungry I would not tell thee
[35:28] for the world is mine and the fullness
[35:31] thereof will I will I eat the Flesh of
[35:34] bulls or drink the blood of goats offer
[35:37] unto God Thanksgiving
[35:42] and pay thy vows unto the most high
[35:46] see as we just read there he's not
[35:48] really interested in the sacrifices
[35:50] because he already owns it
[35:52] yeah but what is what is his desire from
[35:55] you
[35:58] that you offer unto him Thanksgiving
[36:00] that you give him praise
[36:03] [Music]
[36:05] and pay thy vows unto the most high
[36:08] if you vow a vow unto the Lord be sure
[36:10] that you pay it
[36:13] keep your word among men
[36:17] yo that's very important is keeping your
[36:19] word that's how you gain people's trust
[36:22] right yes that's right
[36:24] if you say well I've got I'll do this
[36:25] with you on Saturday and then Saturday
[36:27] comes well I don't feel like doing that
[36:28] I'm not going to go
[36:30] you just broke your word right
[36:33] right so how's that how's that person
[36:34] going to view you now
[36:39] verse 15. it says and call upon me in
[36:42] the day of trouble
[36:44] I will deliver thee and thou shalt
[36:48] glorify me amen all thy testimonies are
[36:52] wonderful that's what we read in the
[36:55] beginning right my testimonies are
[36:57] wonderful amen amen and thou shalt
[36:59] glorify me but unto the wicked God saith
[37:03] what has thousand to declare
[37:05] my statutes or that thou shouldest take
[37:09] my Covenant in thy mouth
[37:11] seeing thou hatest instruction
[37:14] oh my
[37:15] seeing thou hatest instruction and
[37:18] casters my words behind thee
[37:22] that's what that's what the wicked do
[37:25] is they cast the word behind them
[37:27] because they have no part with it amen
[37:30] just thy mouth to evil and thy tongue
[37:33] frameth deceit
[37:35] thou citizen speak us against thy
[37:37] brother thou Slanders thine own Mother's
[37:40] Son these things has thou done
[37:43] and I kept silence
[37:46] thou taught us that I was altogether
[37:48] such and one as thyself
[37:51] but I will reprove thee and set them in
[37:53] order before thine eyes see he's saying
[37:56] see you thought I was a human like you
[38:02] but we also know the scripture says my
[38:04] ways are far above thy way yes sir yes
[38:07] sir
[38:10] see thou thought I said I was all
[38:12] together such and one as thyself
[38:14] you thought I was human like you you
[38:17] thought I was a a truce breaker you
[38:19] thought I was a false accuser you
[38:21] thought I was all these things that a
[38:22] human being is
[38:24] but his ways
[38:26] is he is faultless amen
[38:31] now consider this
[38:34] ye that forget God
[38:37] remember what we're talking on this
[38:38] morning I will not forget your
[38:40] testimonies
[38:41] now consider this ye that forget God
[38:44] lest I tear you in pieces and there be
[38:46] none to deliver
[38:49] whoso offereth praise glorifies me
[38:53] and to him that ordereth his
[38:55] conversation all right will I show the
[38:58] salvation of God
[39:00] you know we often say that that the Lord
[39:03] inhabits the Praises of his people you
[39:06] can't really find that in scripture
[39:07] there is one one place uh where it talks
[39:10] about something like that I can't
[39:12] remember exactly where it is there's a
[39:14] whole debate on that where where the
[39:15] Lord doesn't inhabit the praise of his
[39:17] people you know I believe he does amen
[39:20] if if we Are Holy as he is Holy if we
[39:23] are in him
[39:25] and we glorify him and we praise him he
[39:27] will be in our praise he will be in our
[39:29] song he will be in our dance
[39:31] he will be in our rejoicing because he
[39:33] is the one that we've rejoice in
[39:36] amen so of course he's going to inhabit
[39:39] the Praises of his people
[39:41] because he's housed in his people
[39:45] glory amen I'm going to go ahead and
[39:47] close if the musicians would come
[39:50] just like to close with a couple songs
[39:52] here
[39:56] but I really like how he said that whoso
[39:59] offereth praise glorifieth me and to him
[40:02] that ordereth his conversation a right
[40:04] will I show the salvation of God
[40:08] Psalm 119 89th verse
[40:13] it says forever O Lord Thy word is
[40:16] settled in heaven amen
[40:18] thy faithfulness is unto all generations
[40:22] thou Hast established the Earth and it
[40:24] abideth see that's how powerful our Lord
[40:26] is he spoke and it exists and it still
[40:30] exists
[40:32] they continue this day according to
[40:34] thine ordinances for all are thy
[40:37] servants unless thy law had been my
[40:40] Delights I should have I should then
[40:42] have perished in mind affliction
[40:44] oh I see we Delight
[40:47] in his law
[40:49] because if we don't
[40:51] we would perish in our Affliction right
[40:55] verse 93 says I will never forget thy
[40:58] precepts or thy Commandments the
[41:00] statutes for with them thou has
[41:02] quickened me or made me alive thou has
[41:05] put life in me through these precepts
[41:08] he says I am thine save me for I have
[41:11] sought thy precepts the wicked have
[41:14] waited for me to destroy me and that's
[41:16] what they kind of do in this hour
[41:17] they're they're lying in wait for us
[41:20] they're waiting for our missteps to say
[41:24] hi
[41:25] I told you you couldn't live it
[41:27] to say huh
[41:29] I told you there was no truth in you
[41:32] see that's what they're waiting for
[41:34] right
[41:38] the wicked have waited for me to to
[41:40] destroy me but I will consider I will
[41:43] understand thy testimonies
[41:48] that's psalm 150. starting in the first
[41:51] verse
[41:52] it says praise ye the Lord everybody
[41:54] should know this one amen praise ye the
[41:57] Lord praise God in his Sanctuary praise
[42:01] God praise him in the firmament of his
[42:03] power praise him for his mighty acts
[42:06] Praise Him according to his excellent
[42:08] greatness
[42:10] not just his goodness
[42:12] but his excellent greatness
[42:15] praise him with the sound of the trumpet
[42:17] praise him with the psaltery in the
[42:19] heart praise him with the temporal and
[42:22] dance praise him with stringed
[42:23] instruments and organs Praise Him upon
[42:26] the loud symbols Praise Him upon the
[42:28] high sounding symbols
[42:31] nothing that has breath praise the Lord
[42:34] praise ye the Lord amen amen and one
[42:39] more Psalms 37 and 39th verse
[42:43] it says but the salvation of the
[42:45] righteous is of the Lord
[42:47] he is their strength in the time of
[42:49] trouble
[42:50] [Music]
[42:52] if anybody has it if you're in any
