========================================

since i looked at the life of david but since we went to david and so much of the sermons have been on david lately and brother jim pray sunday i want to look at uh the mighty men tonight by god's grace if you go to second samuel 23. second samuel 23. i do have uh quotes to show after the scripture family of ten or eleven four okay a dad died tom sparrow's son his name is thomas his wife and i think there was four children or something something like nephews and children in the truck he he was killed instantly was he a young father then or an older about 30 something okay so another father the message of a drunk driver hit him head-on so i sent a donation to the church they have a gofundme donation brother tom is the dad thomas is but you know this is another tragedy and i'm interrupted right this morning tonight second samuel 23 8 if you've got your bible second sandwich amen i'd like to look at that thought i may preach two sermons on it or three i don't know how many even i kind of never really know how many i'll get out of a series but my title is mighty men yesterday today and forever praise god hallelujah chapter 23 verse 8. why don't we um we'll just read verse eight just for the sake of time i do want to be mindful of time i don't want to spit stand too long on my leg i hurt my leg i'm trusting god to heal me somehow either surgery or supernatural but that's that's it let's read verse eight together then we'll have that prayer for the family by god's grace let's read this out three can we one two three these be the names of the mighty men whom david had a catchment that sat in the seat chief among the captains the same was a dino the as night he lift up his spear against 800 whom he slew praise god hallelujah that's that word prayer if we can hear by god thank you heavenly father you just come reverently before your throne of grace remember god that you're the mighty one among us yeah hallelujah you're the one who makes men mighty because it's your spirit mightily flowing through yielded vessels so god help us to be unity to you lord hallelujah each and every day lord god always ready that you might lord speak through us uh lord minister through us oh god or help through us for whatever we can do lord we just want to be muted to your holy spirit that something mighty can be accomplished in our lives lord god that would be not what would be mighty to the world but what would be mighty in the eyes of almighty god so lord thank you god for this night uh lord and we just come reverently also god we just ask you god for this scrolls family god please merciful these little children don't have a daddy now lord god i can't imagine what that would be like and this wife doesn't have a husband anymore so father be merciful lord jesus and i just pray lord you comfort everyone in that area lord god no doubt the enemy is coming in but lord at the same time you allowed it for lord the enemy can't do anything except you allow it so father i pray god just give those families peace that passes all understanding i wouldn't know what else to say lord other than that other than the scripture says those that are mourning will be comforted so father comfort them give them peace oh god give them hope for heaven lord god lord just in your mercy let your presence be so strong there to give them love and i pray may the love of the believers in that area be poured out upon them father we just ask god that our love would be shared with them as well through the holy spirit dear god we thank you for tonight bless this word father we're here to receive from you help me lord god help each and every one in jesus christ's name god bless you if you can switch over i got something here i don't know if i've ever preached on this specific thought or not but after watching all their watching david and then hearing the preaching of things we got we basically got david playing 24 7 at our house after just hearing about the 400 time i i uh i listen to that song about the mighty men and i thought that is right that's scripture that he was quoting scripture and so i want to praise a few sermons on this of course this picture is the three mighty men uh the mightiest of the three there was at least 37 total mighty men as we'll see in a little bit here but these are the three mightiest that broke through the philistine lines god gave david a drink of water yeah so uh the three mightiest here uh you have a dino or dino uh eliezer and shema so three mighty men but uh for me i'm looking at if they had mighty men in that day uh they had mighty men before that they had mighty men in the book of acts yeah that means there's mighty men yesterday today and forever yeah praise god hallelujah may god help us to be mighty for his glory the mighty power of god amen so i'm going to skip past those are my notes here so my purpose is basically to increase our faith in god so he can work mightily in our lives in the last few weeks i've been doing a lot of teaching right a lot of teaching teaching about interracial marriage and what the bible says about that and different other topics a little slower you know more sermons where you have to think about it a lot you know and this one hopefully you don't have to think too hard on this one god wants to move mightily through your life amen hallelujah god wants to move mightily in my life your life great lord jesus amen but what we need we need to increase the amount of faith praise god yeah we need a consecrated walk because brother man says the moving of the holy spirit only comes to a life that's consecrated to the word of god that's right so we don't see the spirit of god constantly moving through our lives it's because we're not cut or constantly moving through our lives it's because we're not consecrated to the holy spirit we've led up on our prayer life or we let up on our bible reading or our obedience right or let a complex come in when we don't see the spirit of god moving in our life we've let up on something amen and i'm not talking about you know the dead rising and and paralyzed people walking i'm not talking about that those are those are maybe once in a generation kind of things at least from what i at least from the message people i know right i know very few that i've seen the dead rays very few that have seen paralyzed people walk those are amazing things amen i believe it yeah my dad amen praise god resurrected hallelujah yeah brother craig seen it uh when they had a car accident outside the church but with brother brooks there that man was raised from the dead it's like a couple time in a generation kind of thing that's mighty works of god but what i'm saying is also saying is that you have a work to do from god and it's going to take god's strength to do it you cannot do it without his strength and the fact when his strength comes that will make you mighty that's right because you won't be able to do it on your own you and i can do nothing on our own that's right what we need is more faith amen or what we need is our face stirred up hallelujah yeah that's it stir it up amen mixed up active praise god uh the actual word there means a boiling we need our mind boiling with the word of god we don't need our mind yeah we don't need our mind freezing with all the problems in the world right that'll freeze you up that's what fear does it freezes you up it paralyzes you right and we pay too much attention to the world or our problems that freezes that hinders that cools down our minds but we need the word of god in our minds that it stirs us up makes us ready and active moving amen he can be moved by the holy spirit praise god amen i've done a lot of teachings i i realized that church and perry green i was reading about perry green today uh or the other day rather he knew he wasn't a teacher he knew that right he knew he didn't have a teaching gift he says it himself he said he just had a preaching gift and his main job was to witness about brother branham that his main ministry was the witness about brother branham well i know i i never met brother brown so i don't have that witnessing that's not my ministry i've got a teaching ministry right right i have people all around the world taught me that all around the world i have to ask them they tell me i don't even ask for compliments they just tell me it's god vindicating it praise god yeah but then at the same time i know i don't want to do too much teaching i like to balance it out with some more preaching so i want to preach to you tonight that god wants to do something mighty in your life amen hallelujah and like my man said god might god might uh like john the baptist god might train you for 30 years for six months of mighty ministry praise god amen but that's what i'm telling you god wants to use you and i in a mighty way yes he does amen hallelujah bless the lord and so if there was mighty men in david's day there's got to be some mighty men here today praise god and i mean women too sister so sisters this is this sermon don't yeah don't go to sleep on this sermon amen now the next one i'm gonna the next sermon though on this one lord willing i'm gonna show you a real a powerful sister here but i'm not gonna get that one there's a lot of them there's a lot of mighty men too there's a lot of mighty sisters yeah but god is always looking always looking for someone to show his mighty power inside of their life praise god god is constantly running around the world with his eyes about the eyes of the lord that's his eyes running right eyes ready that's what god's eyes are doing amen in other words he's constantly going from house to house he's going from prayer closet to prayer closet trying to find somebody that wants to be strong amen let's be strong in the spirit and not the flesh amen that's right hallelujah but in order for that to happen you've got to starve the flesh or you've got to deny the flesh amen shall not deny the flesh in order for the spirit of god to use you amen that's true hallelujah bless god you know asa asa had many victories but then uh in this particular chapter he goes out and gets help from heath and kings and uh the bible said we're not the ethiopians and the living's a great host with very many chariots and horsemen yet because thou didst rely on the lord he delivered them into your hand so god is rebuking the king asa he said because the eyes of the lord run to and fro from throughout the whole earth to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward us so church a perfect heart is a heart that relies on god amen glory hallelujah that's it a perfect heart relies on god what for your your your spiritual your spiritual state your natural state yeah everything every need you have a perfect heart relies on god god's wrath amen this ain't teaching i'm preaching to the church trying to preach and build your faith amen hallelujah praise god i gotta rely on god for my healing what do you got to rely on god for every air of our life when we rely on god that's that's giving god a chance to be strong in our lives amen amen amen well many times church we're tempted to show how strong we think we are when we have very little strength really oh yeah compared to that god of the god of the universe where we showed that a few weeks ago the god of the universe amen he's the one with strength he's the mighty one amen the mighty one of israel hollywood the infinite one the all-powerful one the masters one the eternal one who would have its eternity hallelujah he's looking for someone that he can show strength in he wants to be strong in teenagers yes he can he wants to be strong in elementary student amen he must be strong in preachers he wants to be stronger than the mothers yeah he must be strong in the papas and the granddaddies he wants to be strong in the singles amen and they're married amen he wants to be strong and all of us say man but ace had done foolishly because he had trusted in man to win the battles rather than god you're going to see this in a little bit you know but i'll just actually i'm going to fast forward this at the end of david's life he got in trouble because he numbered his men remember that yes why the bible said into great sin because he wanted a number that he could trust him and the whole time church every battle he fought he always won not relying on numbers that's right true in fact he never had a battle where they outnumbered the enemy amen in other words the devil always outnumbered him but god always prevails amen but at the end of his life he wants to know the number and god has to rebuke him for that they lost what how many i think 70 000 in the three days of plague see that's proving to us we cannot rely on our bank accounts we cannot rely upon our houses we cannot rely upon our employers we've got to rely upon jehovah god the self-existing one amen amen praise god because god was upset when david did that he relied on his number of men rather than uh the number of angels that were in god's campaign amen a mighty man or woman let's keep saying that a mighty sister relies on god amen how do you believe that amen and god is constantly looking every day every nation you know america is an awful nation but there is faith so in america the church said there's faith in me praise god i might not manifest as much as i want but i've got faith hallelujah sure man sure i want god to find me in the morning on my knees i want god to find me in a service where i'm here to god where god can do something strong for his glory praise god because god don't do it except through man the bible that's what brother m says right we know that right bible says in scripture i'm not just saying because i said in mark 16 mark 16 the bible says yeah the lord worked with them amen vindicating the word with signs and wonders following praise god yeah the bible says we are ambassadors unto god in other words god sent ambassadors from the heavenly nation down to earth to testify to be as witnesses to do his business on the earth amen amen lord glory to his name see we're strong in mighty church when we rely on god amen i was praying last week we had numerous financial needs in our church i was praying god please send us a financial blessing guess how much money came in the mail this week four thousand five hundred dollars wow and i didn't ask anybody for nothing i just asked god and it's about all used up now that's kind of how it is right god said god sends it so you you meet the need praise god god sends it for that purpose amen so you can go help somebody else amen it's not for me it's for other people amen see when we rely on god then god shows himself mighty in our lives amen now it's difficult like what i said you got this you got to deny the five senses live by the sixth sense that's it amen ignore those try to ignore those five the best you can but we have to go to the doctor first right that's good but then live off the sixth sense trust god amen he's more than able to do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or faith [Applause] it's able yes we have to look at the doctors and to look at the numbers we have to look at all these things the facts look at the symptoms but we have an awesome look at the eternal the heavenly symptoms they've had the heavenly answer the heavenly remedy amen we've gotta look to god we must rely on the holy spirit praise god yeah amen amen i just want to take a brief look so this is where our lord willing i'll spend more time in the new testament next week okay well lord willingly maybe someday we'll kind of see how the lord moves there by god's grace but let's take a brief look at how is the new testament persons mighty well the bible said the apostles were mighty the early apostles that were sat under jesus or paul who learned from jesus by vision the bible said they were given uh signs wonders and mighty deeds now mighty is the word dunamis yes right that's the same word that fell the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost right same word right the spirit of god they were all filled with the holy spirit the dutiness of the holy spirit amen they were filled with the dunamis amen and that means strength or power or ability now it's true nobody can do a miracle greater than jesus i'm going to repeat this again for our live streaming audience and for our church because we've had different people coming over the years and they say well jesus said greater works than these will you do that does not mean you'll do greater than jesus right right if it does then first go walk on water first just do as good as jesus first and then i'll believe that you can do greater yeah while you're at it go get some mud spin on it put somebody's eyes all right i put eyeballs where there are no eyeballs all right then i'll start believing your interpretation of that verse but the people that usually say that don't have mighty works no they've got some false vendetta they're trying to lift people up in a vain kind of way nobody could do greater than the son of god amen that's why he receives all the glory all the power all the praise all the might all the majesty amen the bible says the fullness of the godhead dwells in him he said all power is given to me in heaven earth and we have a measure but jesus christ had all power amen amen that's why i had such mighty deeds glory hallelujah so we'll never do greater than jesus but we can do mighty deeds and i just believe this the apostles had greater deeds than everybody else because they were the first ones sent now of course the bible says there are some of us who have the word the gifts of miracles right right now and then paul gives the order he says apostles prophets teachers and then he says miracles so now what now this is the right order but look what if you're an apostle and you have miracles now you're not you're gifted in numerous ways now you're double gifted triple gifted four gifts five gifts six the wrath said martin luther had nine gifts all nine gifts and that was just the gift what about the preaching gifts so he had over 10 gifts and the church said i mean you could have multiple gifts and if god gave you a gift that means god wants to use it that's right yeah if god the word gift means uh charisma if i'm not mistaken it's a it's a it's an unmerited gift it's it's power praise god god gave us some power but we got to be healed to the holy spirit so god can use his power amen now of course we know not everybody will have miracles no right we're thankful when we see miracles right uh but not all will have miracles so in other words god can show power and might in our lives in different ways sure sure but we should still all strive glory we should all live that people would see the mighty power of god in our lives hallelujah amen amen i believe that amen amen we should live for that i believe because god's eyes are looking for that yes he is he's looking for someone that he can use yeah to magnify his brain amen hallelujah praise god so we're not we don't have all those gifts but we know some do praise god now it depends what you mean by miracles but if you mean like a dead being raised or something like that or instant miracles i think the biggest miracles i've seen in my ministry is the individuals that were healed of the nerve trouble in the back of sister beatrice from columbus the in uh a lot of them met overseas you know uh the brother was healed of a kidney stone or the sister that was healed of a kidney stone the brother that was healed of arthritis right after right after pray for them just instant miracles instant now many times church we find out a lot of our prayers are instant right so what does it mean it means we have to have some faith praise god god's power is still going to flow but it's not going to flow when we want it to because we don't control the hose right we can pray you know sometimes we're speaking that we speak at the same time god is unleashing the host amen and let the power flow the rain come down amen hallelujah praise god sometimes that's a mighty rush of power amen other times you've got to wait but see god is in control praise god god wants to do miracles and those lives who are the people's lives who have the gift of miracles praise the lord and church don't count yourself out no abraham didn't see a miracle or vision until he was 75. don't count yourself out most of the part the red c2 is more than 80. the church said so i'm trying to encourage you praise god just be faithful to god amen just wait on god be faithful to god live a consecrated life praise god wait on god you know in the book of acts reminds me of austin kind of austin's testimony member he shared he was kind of involved in the occult remember that and by the way we've been on this first podcast this week that song sounds really good brother in acts 19 paul preached i think it was in ephesus i'm not mistaken he preached so hard that they took their occult books and the bible said they made a pile of them and burned them praise the lord and the cost of them was like in the millions or something like them just a huge number 50 000 pieces of silver i mean can you imagine these were very costly occult books and what the bible say just the burning glory just the burning of satanic bibles glory just the burning of occult books amen just uh just the uh uh the getting rid of the cult books the bible said mightily grew the word of god and prevailed amen in other words when you finally flush that last cigarette down the toilet that's the mighty work of god amen sure hallelujah sure when you finally go to the last time of doing something you're no longer addicted that's a mighty move of god hallelujah not discount these mighty works of god you see our thinking sometimes has to be expanded the fact austin's here is a mighty work of god let me say this the fact you're here is a mighty work of god is that right the fact you're here amen amen in fact you're here the fact we're here it's a mighty work of god if he's delivered you from demonic powers then you ought to praise god amen if he delivered you from temptations and addictions and all these things it's a mighty work of god you ought to praise god for that amen amen so the larger the number of commerce the more mighty the moon but if one person could say brother william in my book that's a mighty that's a mighty revival [Applause] when we got saved out of lima brother there was like 40 or 50 of us that got baptized they called it was one of the biggest revivals in the area ever that was around 2000 that's right i'm sorry 2001 2002 2003. look what race up by there how many preachers we got out of there now at least five or six [Music] yeah a mighty move so the more satan's kingdom is torn down and destroyed the more mighty the revival is praise amen amen amen amen [Music] now look paul says god works in him mightily how does god work in mightily and paul well first you've got to have christ in you the hope of glory and the church said now this is speaking of the baptism of the holy ghost church so paul no doubt was baptized in the holy ghost so god worked in him mightily but listen if you're not born again yet and you're still moving towards there you can still be mighty because in the old testament they didn't have the baptism holy ghost and the bible still called almighty amen praise the lord church so any of us children you can be mighty even if you just got baptized this year or last year you can still be mighty god's power can flow through you praise god to win a soul or to witness to someone or pray for the sick and they recovered god wants to do mighty things through all our lives he just needs someone who's used to him praise god he just needs someone who would say lord use me today and show your mighty powers when was the last time we prayed that when was the last time i prayed that well earlier because i knew i was gonna preach on it right before the sermon when was the last time we prayed for it god sent the mighty move send the mighty power of the holy was the last time we pray for that praise god see we got to be desiring it we got to be uh we got to be in position so god can use us for that because god is looking to show himself strong on his behalf bless the lord god so what was christ's new hope with glory he said when when we have christ in us we preach we warn every man we teach every man in all wisdom so when you've got christ in you you can warn men and you can teach men sure sure that we may present every man perfect you see some people need a warning they just want to obey god so you got to warn them see if you do this satan's going to get a hold of you other people don't need warning you just got to show them in the bible they'll do it that's because they love the lord the church said amen and then so this is christ and paul a holy ghost filled prophet said i've got to warn some man but i've got to teach others but i'll do both because christ is in me why because i'm laboring and i'm striving i'm trying to reach something i'm striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily praise god see now this is another good scripture for teaching brother william because he said i'm teaching and that's christ working in me mightily so what is it with these message preachers that don't like teachers see they miss they miss the bible now i believe you've got to preach preach i got to think i believe you've got to preach power and all these things but paul says the holy ghost worked it in mightily to warn all men and to teach all men and the church said amen it's colossians chapter one see so see our thinking on mighty uh it can change right well how many want to see mighty things in their life amen now let's take a brief little look at a general look at david's mighty man because this was my inspiration if you haven't seen that david you've got to go see david man that was good that was good now there's at least 37 men listed in the chapters there's two chapters you know one in second samuel one in first chronicles 11 about the mighty men they they were israel's greatest warriors during the days of david right uh and of course not all men not all of them were in this group at the same time there's at least two of them that died while they were in that the the bible calls them a group of thirty there was always thirty mighty men thirties the age jesus started with the holy ghost dude amen same age uh a priesthood minister was 30. yeah same age john the baptist started in his ministry 30 years right but austin you're five years away brother get ready get ready god's gonna use you man hit 30. no it's just it's just a tight thing there is some significance to it as well i mean there is i know my life throws over the great significance in 30 years i could document that i could preach on it but uriah was one of the examples david had him killed well someone had to take his place right so there was always 30 but there's a total of 37. so this lasted church just for a generation think about that george our generation williams towards the end of his generation i'm right in the middle i'm not far behind brother but during our generation if it was like david there'd be just a small group that they'd call mighty men or let me say this mighty women that's right praise god praise god god's not a respecter of persons you don't have to be a preacher to be mighty amen no hello what about stephen the bible said he was full of the fire full of the holy ghost full of signs miracles and wonders and he was just a deacon amen just he wasn't a preacher philip had four virgin daughters that prophesied amen that could say don't say the lord this will come to pass and it came to pass so they try to say it as loud as i do you know with that thing bulging out and stuff like that they probably said well don't say the lord you're the lord hallelujah thank you sisters but was that mighty or is that wimpy what do you think church which one of you foretell prophecies all the time now brother ready but which one see it's a very it's a rare thing but it takes someone who's consecrated who's got the gift yeah who's submitted who knows their gift and they're dedicated and they want to be faithful and they want to show god's strength to this world now years ago church years ago this is something i i'm gonna have to follow up on in prayer after i turned 30 brother that's when cam came to our church and actually when i was 29 ken came to our church and he preached just once more lord and after that brother i i remember john and graham and i we prayed for 45 minutes at the altar i'm not sure if i cried or not but i know we prayed for 45 minutes right after that that's when my wife got healed of the migraines and the miracles started multiplying and i told the lord i said if you continue this i'll write a book on jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and just write just write testimonies very so long i didn't make a vow an official vow but this is something i need to pray about all right praise god now in my current in my uh in my 2021 book i have the nine gifts of the holy spirit in chapter 10 and i have a lot of your testimonies in there i have some of your testimonies right that's great and some of mine too so i was able to testify but see that that's something i want to pray about for the future if god's going to let us be here then god find me faithful that you can show yourself mighty and i can share your testimonies praise god bless god to what to raise people's faith especially for the next generation they need to see the power of god yeah yeah to see the power of god amen we need reminders of god's power right now mature christians us older christians yeah but we need reminders too because we get caught up in the carnal just the regular routine of life we need god to shake up our lives stir us up amen hallelujah they're also called 30 chiefs now the three of the three of course that were uh the the leaders were joshev shabeth okay but it's also a dino eliezer shama and the main text of those will get to those hopefully next week now church i saw this i started studying the bible on mighty men there's mighty men on both sides but it depends what you call mighty in genesis 6 the first time you see mighty men the offspring of the the mixed spiritual marriages notice i didn't say natural spiritual right well they might actually there might have been some natural there too yeah there might have been some natural dude because you you still had the sea lion of cain yeah that's right and eventually they all got mixed at the time of noah yeah so there might have been some natural end spirit but definitely spiritual praise god the reason so when those sons of god when those sons of seth looked and they said well we got our we got our message daughters and we have our uh we have our judas iscariot daughters they took but they're better looking they chose the judas the law they chose the lost ones or the the the hittites or the bailites you know whatever they call them you know they chose the worldly sexy dress women instead of the godly ones their offspring became men of renown mighty men the bible says and that means reputation fame or glory okay so instead of having a reputation for serving god the offspring of of the intermarrying between uh cain's line and cest line produced men that became human glory they had human faith they had human reputation they didn't have god's reputation right that's the point i'm making that's right in other words if you want god's reputation obey all the word of god amen hallelujah and what what did these mighty men produce will they produce such a wicked age that god destroyed it with water that's right so the first mighty men we see labeled in the scripture were sinners right and eventually got punished with the flood also uh moses was dancing on the run i can't dance today so sorry my leg i just can't dance i normally not good normally i would it's all right but dad uh moses is dancing he's watching uh miriam and he's singing while she's dancing on the red sea shore and he said then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moab trembling shall take hold upon them and all the inhabitants shall be don't melt away he's prophesied amen he's prophesied saying this is what joshua's going to do joshua's going to melt all the inhabitants away that's right amen but they recognized he recognized and i spelled that wrong that's moa instead of moab forgive me i just caught it right there but moses recognized moab had mighty men but he wasn't afraid because he just saw god open the red sea praise god amen he just saw god drop ten plagues upon egypt praise god he just saw god give two million people a highway for the city amen hallelujah he ain't afraid of any mighty men from moab he's got your home on his side but us and he's got the pillar of fire ain't man going before him he's got the filler fire at night as a cloud behind him damn hmm guys got nothing to be afraid of that's true who was the real mighty men then it was actually moses amen moab called themselves body but really the mighty men was moses and joshua right there no but and here god told joshua once they're there in the promised land he said i've given you the hand of jericho and all their mighty men of valor pay attention church pay attention joshua 1 your wives your little ones your cattle shall remain the land which moses gave you on this side of jordan but you shall pass before your brethren arm all the many all the mighty men of valor and help them now god starts calling them mighty men of valor right isn't that perfect once they get in the land brother ray once they get the baptism of the holy ghost now you're mighty man amen now you're a mighty woman amen when you get born again when you cross over in the promise of god when god adopts you into his family you become a mighty believer praise god praise the lord praise the lord same thing in joshua chapter eight verse three joshua says i gotta go up and i gotta defeat these kings i'm gonna take 30 000 mighty men my church how are we going to be mighty if we can't read our bibles and pray every day and talk to god every day how are we going to do it the man said you want to fall in love with god what do you say read your bible and pray yeah how are you gonna do it god's looking first that's right men and women praise god that's right he's searching for somebody who wants to be strong today who wants to have a testimony today amen see joshua's soldiers were mighty men they were in the land they were baptized with the holy ghost and god said use the mighty man that's why i sent him here praise god amen that's the truth amen now i know that simon brought this out a number of months ago not not saturday but he brought this out in an awesome way where he was showing how on the job he couldn't remember the numbers but he could remember all the scriptures and i thought that's exactly like it for me i teach little kids in a such a humble uh maybe a least esteemed job and i get to come and preach the gospel to believe or say amen you know it's just it's a paradox amen for ye see your calling brethren how that many not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called in other words you're not going to see many message people that were really great people in life i mean the most famous one i know brother is a pastor uh i can't remember what state he's in but he played the nfl i just talked him on the phone uh he sat under leave ale remember him his name is brian yeah yeah i talked to him on the phone well he played in the national football league that's a very big accomplishment as far as i know he's the most famous message believer that i know and now today nobody would know him because that was back in the 70s right yeah uh brother steven's dad played the nfl so stephen uh haverdick now he changed his name but his dad's name is haverdick dave haverdick he played the nfl so i know too mighty man according to the flesh that god has called the message too that's not a lot two now why did god do this why didn't god choose more you know like the ceo of amazon or why did why do you choose like the ceo of apple or somebody like that somebody from the nba or some steph curry or something like that because god chose the foolish things of the world to confound the wise in other words god knew those people wanted to be foolish god could only his eyes were something for somebody that wanted to be wise amen god can only use the people that want to be used hallelujah that's it that's where is that that's right god's chosen the weak that's me to confound the things which are mighty naturally praise god so that's why god doesn't save more famous people because they are foolish in the things of the world yeah they will not make themselves weak for the gospel's sake they still remember like they want to call themselves christians but yeah having a homosexual pastor is okay with them right god can't call them to a higher calling because he knows they don't want it right that's what the bible says only a few not many only a few are called that are mighty after the flesh how many big bodybuilders you've seen the message not too many not too many not many mighty men if they are they better be careful too right you don't want to be a summoning block right there's not many how many famous women are you know i don't know i'm not sure what a godly woman could be famous for but you don't see too many there's not there's not many god's using the humble and this is the beautiful part god always calls the humble and the least and the spies and makes them mighty if you are weak and despise and cast out you are the perfect candidate for god to use amen [Applause] amen you're just the kind of person god wants to use if you're weak not very smart you don't come from a wealthy family or you're just the one god wants to use god said i'll take that one grace god passes all over all the millionaires all that when i was billionaires and trillionaires right and i was billionaire brother he bypassed all the billionaires they trusted their money god said oh can i find somebody yeah there's somebody in action i can trust it [Music] i can trust them amen i'll bypass all the worldly ones and don't want my knowledge and i'll give it to the humble ones because then i can use them and like they won't take credit for it either no don't give jesus all the credit amen there's going to be mighty men naturally all the way down here in the sixth seal the bible said the uh once the sun is blackened out right the moon becomes blood the mighty men are going to hide themselves in caves saying kill us kill us but death will escape them because they fought against the lamb and then church these mighty men are going to become bird food yeah that's true see i don't want to eat bird food i'm going to be the bird i'm going to be the eagle by the way i don't [Applause] but they become bird food yes they do the mighty men how muddy are they now with birds eating them not very mighty these skinny little tiny little birds there's lightweight birds that get eaten up by birds that's not mighty they thought it was mighty but it wasn't mighty god help us to be humble so god can make us mighty amen so we have these two groups of mighty men what's the difference the difference is brother god's on our side that's it that's right that's the only way you and i can be mighty the only way we're going to get it any other way except the lord is on our side trying to raise your faith tonight laurie now let's look just look at this out of the easier real quick but there's in this in this section about the mighty men there's two statements that prove that these mighty men did not do this on their own power you will do nothing on your own power i can do nothing on my own power praise god no no like this week i can hardly walk up the stairs how am i going to go heal the sick when i'm sick yeah i can hardly i'm getting no better now by god's grace right we have no power but god here's the answer right in the bible glory the bible says the lord wrote a great victory that day praise god the lord which means jehovah which means the self-existent one the strong one the self-existent one brought about the victory for every mighty man that gives me hope that i can be a mighty man someday amen and if i just let god move god will use me to do a victory for his name i amen you already have it but i believe you can do more by god's grace amen what's the word rock mean in hebrew it means fashion so the lord fashioned or accomplished or made the victory possible so his eyes first started looking who can i use today who's consecrating to me who wants to show how strong i am today and then he finally finds somebody and then god takes them up and god accomplishes something mighty through that person oh so beautiful church amen and it beautiful yeah god accomplishes a victory through you and i so as we as we go through some of these testimonies of these mighty names it wasn't their strength that did it it was god's strength thank you lord praise the lord god makes you mighty hallelujah your strength doesn't make you mighty no no you can swim and run and bike and do a triathlete you can do all that that don't make you money all right you got to strip off your clothes to do it then you become instantly weak you lose all your spiritual strength amen that don't make you mighty what makes you mightiest hearing the voice of god obeying the voice of god and doing what god tells you to do praise god oh yes hallelujah blessed be the lord amen elijah had it right he was the type of christ here's what he told job he said he shall break in pieces mighty men without number that's right you can line up all the muscle men you want you can line up all the football men you can light up all the military men in the u.s or russia line them right up hi god just come down and just break all the way out and you're gonna breathe and just destroy it amen and it just spreads like chap he's the great one he's the mighty one he wants to make us mighty through his power amen in other words anyone standing before you who you think is mighty is not mighty god's the mighty one amen see god knows their works he overturns them in the night they can die right they can they can fight against one another like we saw in the game they can just turn around and fight and have bad dreams and nightmares about you yeah yeah and they get destroyed amen yeah how many times do we worry about something and then when it comes out it's totally different than what we thought that's the time to be mighty praise god that's time to be mighty not be afraid but trust in god now let's look at three of the mightiest men here never set my timer that's okay a dino or dino he's also called joshua that's quite a name there i heard preachers call him jv i thought that's a pretty good name maybe bob's called medina other translations call him uh josh him king james doesn't call him that king james calls him a dino but that if you click on the hebrew word that's what it means there now the second was eliezer the third shama so dave was thinking which three of these are going to be the greatest of my my mighty men and so let's find out how we want to find out what made them so mighty i hope you do because it's going to make you mine so a dino there's only one verse about him now church we read it what'd he do he lift up a spear against 800 whom he slew at one time 800 not eight not 80 800. now that's a little less than samson did a few years before that samson did a thousand now i was reading about samson when he when he defeated the thousand he had a new jawbone and i think i have the scriptures up there but when the historians actually studied it he was up on a hill or an elevated place compared to these thousand philistines that he imagined a thousand people rushing at you but history says he was up on a hill and those men had marched a very long distance so they were naturally worn out right they were a little bit worn out and they had a command if they didn't kill try to kill samson they were going to get killed themselves and then and then also there was a there's a host of israelite warriors just watching it so they didn't they thought well they could come get us so we'll just go after samson so in other words this this wasn't like maybe something impossible that we would think but he still had the spirit of god on and he took that new jawbone all right and they're running up to him now what could you do if he were just running at you you already got the leverage that's right now in one swing maybe you can knock all three i don't know maybe two but he took that jawbone and he's up on that elevated spot and he starts bam bam bam and pretty soon he's got a thousand now the bow said he slew a thousand glory yeah but he's ours god gave him the upper hand amen church if god's gonna do something minding you he's gonna give you the upper hand amen ask the lord when i preached on david and goliath years ago in here when somebody was still coming in i showed you through the science if you do the stone hard enough it will kill you if if you're like a a strong 20 year old or something like that it will literally kill somebody right that wasn't like i probably uh dramatized it saying with the speed of light you know i might have but it didn't need to god just needed a boy to step out there and to stand up for the word of god amen and stand up for the message amen i knew you had to fling the stone and throw it he didn't have to have a supernatural thing he just had to be supernaturally led to stand and fight and that's what we need to do just stand and fight for the word of god see we picture something like you know just samson's swinging that and like 50 people die it might not have been he had tired soldiers and they just they knew they're going to die and then they're also looking at all the soldiers up there and they had no choice and i'm not i'm not uh i'm not degrading the the victory the victory was great but all these things you got to take into account god set him up god gave him the the weapon now still the weapon not breaking that's a supernatural thing right a bone not breaking on their brass helmets it's just god amen it's gone so samson to the thousand and a dino does 800. different weapon though different weapon here's what they think the weapon looks like spear now of course it's got a longer end so it looked more like that okay more that's a cartoonish one but you get the idea right so he takes his spear and he he destroys 800 people now that means he can't let the spear leave he's got to take that he's got to have the spear the whole time he's got to hold it so he's got the sharp man he's got this other end maybe he had two sharp ends i don't know but the spirit of god comes on him and he takes down 800 all in one fight praise god and this man is made the chief of all the mighty men because with one weapon glory with one weapon he took down a whole army praise god that's what we do that's what the bible does that's what jesus with the word of god hallelujah every fall is defeated with one weapon all of our foes are defeated with one weapon a shark spear hallelujah oh who's gonna david said who's gonna i'm a man after god's own heart i say the giant who's gonna be my number one soldier the guy that killed 800 all by himself with one weapon one weapon hallelujah what the bible say god had already promised her joshua one man will chase a thousand is that fulfilled or not church sure is god's word does god word come back void no no for the lord your god he fights for you as he promised you in other words if you know there's a general promise for god yes as we as we taught a few weeks ago you've got to seek god for god's will and then if you know it's god's will then you can fight and fight and fight and you know god will back up his word amen hallelujah that's what sam said he found a new jawbone sue a thousand men great the bomb said he was so tired god i'm gonna kill these men you're gonna let me uh uh you're gonna let me have a third you're gonna starve to death and then he got water out of it praise god he broke it over and had enough water to strengthen himself amen oh my god is faithful amen see all of our mighty acts are based upon god's promises so god made the promise what's he what he needs is somebody who's strong to fight yeah that's what he needs that's it somebody's willing to step out and defy the devil praise the lord god help us all amen amen so you get the idea now what's the lesson we get a believer can defeat any size army that's that's the lesson you get here the greatest warrior was the one who defeated the largest number of people all by himself he didn't need somebody else for that battle all he needed was god amen brother sometimes you don't need my prayer sometimes you just need god amen i'll pray for you right you'll pray for me but sometimes i don't need your prayer i need god to come on the scene amen that's true i want to pray for you though i do i want you to pray for me i do yeah but david said this man all right this man will be my chief great because that is the chief of the chiefs that's right the greatest of the great right looking at that a lot lately so that's the lesson we get if you're a believer trusting in god and you've got a strong weapon you can defeat any size option any size obstacle right praise god you can defeat cancer yeah tuberculosis amen amen covenant 19. you can defeat it praise god amen amen if you got the weapon and willing to fight and god's anointing you you can defeat any size army amen by the word of god amen the second is eliezer he was one of the three mighty ones the bible said now he defied the philistines that were gathered together to battle and the men of israel going away now if you study this in other versions it actually says the men of israel left the battle they were afraid so he said out there elise is out there let's fight that's about and all of a sudden they see the philistine army and everybody's like leaving but there was something in l.a shoes like cement he said i'm not going anywhere crazy you guys can run if you want you can get the spoilers later i'm going to fight this guy can you imagine that imagine your whole church won't even come and pray for you and the church said amen all your friends all your church friends don't want nothing to do with it that's what happened all the church deserted him and he was standing alone against the enemy praise god so church if you're deserted don't feel bad god's still with you amen let that people desert you let people leave let people speak evil let people down but if you're a believer god will back you up amen amen and no matter how many people you have with you god will back you up praise god amen that's his holy name amen amen he was deserted but did you know as he fought on his hand became so weary they could not take his hand off the sword in other words he became one with the word of god praise god the sword by the way it was not a different part of him a sword the sword was a part of him yeah and it fit his hand so perfectly the king so hard at man [Applause] praise god you could not detach it this is now a part of me the word and i are one christ is in me i'm a part of christ you and me i and you praise god hallelujah i become one with the word amen amen when other people [Applause] that's a beautiful type right there oh yes let people deserve let people doubt let them do whatever they want don't feel bad about it you just stand with the word you just hold the word in your hand and fight and again church who wrought this victory who did this god so god gave him a special can i say like this what they call sticky stuff like you know like when you're like baseball players they put sticky stuff on their hands you know or football players they want sticky gloves god put a special spiritual stick on that hand with that sword praise the lord perfect grip one after another after another they just couldn't even take it off come on david pull it off i can't the mighty man can't even pull off the sword from the mighty man that's almighty the lord had given him that grip oh he had a grip on the word church may god give us a grip on this message hallelujah [Applause] or we can separate the human side from the divine side praise god i believe we got it amen hallelujah so what's a lesson from eleazar a believer's victorious by clinging to the word become one with the word and you'll be victorious despite being deserted despite you feel like you're all left out nobody involved you you you everybody left you i don't have any friends everybody where did all his friends go at least we didn't have any friends at that moment all of his friends foreshook him but god never forsaken praise god and god will never forsake you amen thank you jesus so no matter the size of the army no matter who's standing with you or not you can still be a believer and you can still be a mighty son and daughter of god hey try to build your faith tonight very bad shaman what's shot with you so he sees the philistines gathering a troop or an army and wear a piece of ground full of lentils lentils are just beans he's in a bean field and all the regular people now they're not warriors just the people out harvesting the beans all the farmers and the gatherers all the workers they just run away from him he's the only one in the field sharma i like this he stands the ground and defends it again another deserted message believer yeah you ever see message people flee before they don't want to pray they don't want to they don't want to help anybody out you ever seen that before oh you don't say remember that i've seen it right don't you go to other churches and nobody wants to come up and pray no they got people crying on laying on the altar you know we want to pray for him right how many times have i seen every woman i'll be on the churches come up just one or two stragglers come up there why don't you come up and pray these are souls hanging the bells people get lazy they don't want to fight they deserve the real the word of god may god help us not to deserve the word but to obey the word of god hallelujah come on now he stands his ground i like that stand your ground law that's right stand your ground if it's your bean field stand for it if it's your possession that god gave you stand for it other people run away let the devil rob them of their blessings and the church said amen i know you're getting tired stay with me they'll let the devil steal all their joy all their positive confession all their hope for the future steal all that yet the bible says god has an expected end for us amen amen thoughts of peace they'll let the devil steal their peace their security their testimony they let them steal every good thing from them they won't stand their ground but god is calling you shabba god is calling you shama to stand your ground claim your inheritance don't give up your god-given possessions don't run when the enemy comes in stand your ground praise the lord yes that's true hallelujah amen mighty men yesterday today forever god's always going to have mighty men what is he going to have 90 minutes later the bible said the kings of the earth yeah that's kings of the earth okay kings mighty men got you sure glory so the third lesson we get is a believer is will be victorious when defending their promised land territory or their possessions that the word of god gave them right what are the three what are the three mightiest people i can find the one that stands no matter how big the enemy is the one that stands who will just cling to the word and the third is the one who will not give up what god has already given to them and they stood alone lord each one of these people stood alone nobody was standing with them they stood alone and david makes them you're my mightiest man amen the ones who stood there all by himself but no one else was around right but they knew this for him god was standing right there with him they had anointed they felt the anointing they felt god they felt god's presence they knew god was going to give them victory praise god man [Applause] that's true just stand there brother said stand there like the rock of ages he said well he's asking you to be like jesus right because jesus is the rock of ages amen okay so stand there like the rock of ages amen amen bless the lord amen be a mighty man yeah be a mighty woman for jesus christ yes don't give up the blessings god has given to you lord cling to the word with all your strength until it's a part of you amen don't fear the obstacle don't fear the enemy no matter how big the obstacle is trust in the lord and fight with the word of god amen now church how they become so mighty wow these are pretty mighty men the dino elder easer shama they must have been david's sons or something like that were they davidson no they weren't david's sons were they saw sons he was the biggest of all of them you were talking about a guy who's big he's a mighty man god is talking about the big guys god he talked about physical size for me mighty god's talking about the mighty heart that's right a heart that really loves god [Music] have they become so mighty the bible said when dave was still running from saul he escaped he was he was a fugitive and he went to the cave of adelaide and when his brethren and all his father's house heard it they went feather to him and everyone that was in distress everyone that was in debt everyone that was discontented gathered themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and they were with him about 400 men so look out of these 400 about 30 became the mighty ones that's good that's like that's like a tenth right there's a time amen about a time become mighty men that's right see church it doesn't matter what you are now today you might be stressed out too today you might be in debt right today you might be discontent which means bitter doesn't mean no you're not going to be mighty someday come on now praise god amen now a lot of us are dogs we know we are mighty one time but we got to get back to that hallelujah glory amen sometimes we get stressed out in life sometimes we get indebted in life right we sin against people we're dead to them make bad even naturally make bad mistakes financially and other times we get bitter with people well all these bitter stressed out indebted people come to david and they become david's army and out of these he finds 30 that are mightier than the others notice but they all came indebted they all came bitter against saul they all came stressed out our lives are hard we're fugitives we're not going to be we don't want to be a part of the regular army we're just we're castaways bitter and how do they become mighty because they start hanging around a mighty man who's already been mighty praise god hallelujah they learned firsthand how to be a mighty man from the giant slayer himself david so david taught these men stress relief because the bible said they were distressed david taught them this is how you get rid of your stress pray and dance and sing to the lord give me a kimbrough brother let everything that happened praise the lord come on brothers right he taught them how to stretch relief praise god he taught them how to pay off their debts don't be a slave pay it off ain't taught them forgiveness don't be so bitter this is how you become mighty church everybody anybody catch you that tonight who wants to be a mighty man or woman for god get rid of your stress why do you have to have stress why do you have to be mannered you don't have to be you can be taught by david you can be taught by the mighty man you can be taught by the son of david jesus christ amen hallelujah you know what being dead we've seen god guess with some debts here this is what mighty men do brother they cancel other people's debts jesus cancels debts maybe not so much in the morning but right now it's all right see the holy ghost teaching you the same don't be stressed out cast your cares on the lord amen why you gotta be so stressed give it to god come on now why you gotta be in debt be more fervent at your business pay your ties and offerings be more fervent get rid of your debts you can't afford going out deep don't go out to eat can't afford that pet sell the pet yep get out of debt that's right right and then pray god forgive me my sins then you won't be bitter anymore true lord help me to forgive that person ah i feel like we're getting mighty in here already i feel a little i feel a little mightier than when i came in don't you anybody else feel that by god's grace yeah let's be a little mightier praise god i can be free from my bitterness i can be stress-free brother william amen all my deaths can be gone yeah who's going to do it david's going to do it he's going to teach me how to war [Applause] [Music] this is the kind of man that god chooses amen that's right god send these castaways god send these illegitimate people god send these debtors god said these stressful bitter people god said unto david and david took him and changed the world praise god david didn't start off so mighty either church he was he was uh just a plain old shepherd anybody could be a shepherd rachel was a shepherd a woman women were shepherds right the shooter might was a shepherd anybody a woman could be a shepherd he'd have a very great position and he was forgotten by his father his father didn't think much of him like oh this guy's this guy going to be a king you imagine that the prophet's coming to my house oh my one of my sons is going to be king anything about david um can you imagine that if you like me like oh only malachi could be the next king you know forget about little zion that's right i still got two sons oh it's got to be malaga gotta be think about that forgot my dad just not even at night he didn't even come in he didn't even the pasta didn't even come to him but it wasn't it wasn't what jesse was looking at it was what god was looking at yes you didn't see a mighty man out there but god's almighty man out there that's why it doesn't matter what people think about you you should care less some people think about you yes you should be kind of them forgive them help them but what i'm saying is your destiny doesn't depend on people god has your destiny in his hand and god will make you a mighty man or woman first glory [Applause] the mighty men started out stressed out bitter and in all kinds of debt every one of them was the bob said everyone none of them had oh i've got all my debts paid off i've got a sweet heart i've forgiven all my friends here david i'm ready to be a mighty man oh they all came in better i can't believe my dad did that okay my brother did that i can't believe that my wife did that i can't believe that all of them yeah but just in the presence of david for a few years dave they learned to learn from david how to worship they learn from david how to be a mighty man they learn from david how to fight and pretty soon they become mighty it wasn't overnight but over the course of months and years and and a decade they become the mightiest men that israel had ever seen amen george all you need is just a little training that's true you just got to sit around in a mighty man and that ain't me i'll tell you that right now i might help you a little bit but only if god gives me grace there's only one mighty man that's jesus christ amen and you've got to sit at the mighty man's feet that's right hear me like martha you've got to sit at jesus feet right that will not be taken from you the virtue that flows out of jesus to you will not be taken from you god then you'll be mighty that's right and that's what god's looking for his eyes ran through akron daddy which person can i find that's my new language do you know that how do you believe they can't even believe god sent a prophet they can't even believe god's one person they can't believe that they're not supposed to pray to mary right those people are they're not they're not trying to be strong they're trying to be strong for the pope right but he's looking here god's looking tonight where's a strong person that i can show myself strongly here tonight where's somebody i can make a mighty man or woman hallelujah all it takes is a little training how many willing to go through some training amen get rid of all your bitterness get rid of all your stress oh lord take this stress from me get rid of all the deaths yeah i said i just natural and spiritual right who doesn't like to be debt free in other words don't put yourself in debt right that's right true they're learning from this guy but austin who said harvest how did david become mighty he realized god is my shepherd that's it god is the one feeding me every day oh glory that's the truth that's the truth god feeds me by green when i spend time with god by the way he don't take me to where there's a desert he takes me to green pastures there's as much to eat in that bible by the way every morning there's so much for me to eat this is green that's fresh that's fresh come on church oh yeah he leads you beside green pastures amen amen amen hallelujah and you want to drink of the holy spirit he's there right ready to pour it out praise god amen give me joy give me a song give me a blessing amen let me feel your presence he leads me besides still water that's it all right that's right that's where all the stress leads brother that's it because the waters are just so smooth yeah yeah just a little trickling there yeah yeah it ain't crashing waves and you're getting splashed all over it's just still yeah yeah yeah i feel my distress lifting i feel all my burdens lifting right now i think i'm just gonna go ahead and cast my cares on the lord right now all right let's go take him out and leave him in behind still why i'm just gonna eat over here i'm hungry i want some fresh good vitamins from god i'm gonna eat on the word of god lead me to the green passage lead me to the green pastures of god's holy earth amen glory this is how the first mighty man became he recognized god is my shepherd he's going to lead me to my food my god [Music] because big daddy shepard's watching me amen he just sees himself as a little sheep out here all he's got to do is yeah i shouldn't eat doing that all you gotta do is eat and drink dad's got my back here yeah all right father i'm a father my dad's got my back i just gotta eat i just gotta drink i just gotta stay in those she sheepfold praise god amen come on guys you gotta stay home praise god i just can't wander away after worldly things oh god help our minds out the wonder oh lord jesus amen yes that's where the bible said he'll restore your soul yes he does he will bring back all those good feelings he'll bring him back and you'll feel like your old self again amen amen well i feel ready to go fight oh yes yeah i feel ready to pray now i feel ready to witness now praise god for me it's like i feel ready to preach now after today amen surely god's goodness and mercy will follow me because all i see is green all i see is water all i see is my shepherd here surely his goodness and mercy will follow me because my shepherd is right with me amen that's how he became recognizing i'm just a sheep right the shepherd is watching over me he's making sure i get strong he's making sure i always got something to eat i've always got something to drink he's always got my back nature jesus always has my back ain't me i won't fear nothing because jesus always is watching me and praise god amen amen that's right no wonder he could be mighty thinking like this singing this song all day you'd probably be mighty too yeah come to our house you're gonna go here you'll hear the girls sing it pretty much and some guys too like dads they can't really sing that well though but see the lord became this mighty man shepherd that's how he become mighty last time god had to train him even though his dad rejected brother just like my dad left me just like his dad rejected him it didn't matter because the heavenly father became his dad he recognized he was really my horde my dad the whole time he's out there all by himself with sheep and you know the story you know the story a lion would come out right and this man this young teenager was so under the anointing the bible said he would chase down the lion and catch him by the beard yeah he'd grab looks like he looked use your magnet he grabbed like this and said give me that lamb man yeah yeah he probably wouldn't tear the lamb but he was like pull it down the lamb would fall out and then i don't know what he would do i smoked him yeah you got a big stick maybe maybe a spear oh yeah the ride on the staff that's right around the staff that's must have been the power of god or maybe hit him right in the eye or some weak spot you know the holy spirit directed that rod right to the spot and knock the line out maybe kill him right after that i don't know but that's real anointing and then a bear come up and he does the same thing to the bear i'm not afraid of that bear these are god's sheep all right i'm the shepherd god glory god commissioned me to save these souls can i say like that god's commissioned you to win souls god has commissioned me to win souls we have to fight for the souls we have to earnestly contend to save souls we gotta pray harder we gotta pray more we gotta fight for these little lambs we gotta rescue god's land amen praise god somebody's gotta pray for him yeah you and i got to pray for him true so david this was clear already clear before you call goliath he's already a mighty man because he spent time worshiping god see he became a mighty man because he was a humble shepherd and he became mighty by understanding that god was his shepherd amen that's how you become mighty you trust that god is with you two you rely on god yeah that's it so what's the lesson if you're faithful in a little ministry like shepherding or can say this if you're faithful with a little church all right and god will make you rule over much someday yeah like instead of watching sheep then you're going to watch souls of men praise god then you're going to fight the philistines then you're going to fight the mobile like david first he was fighting lions and bears and he got to fight goliath and goliath's brothers right her sons either brothers or sons i think he was brothers brothers see if you can be faithful with your daily walk with god amen there's hardly no way to tell what god will do with you if you can be mighty in your daily walk with the lord how many want to be mighty than their daily walk with the lord [Music] amen
