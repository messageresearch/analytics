[37:52] the Lord's been faithful at home he's
[37:54] he's kept us uh he uh
[37:57] he just uh corrected me in
[38:00] something just this week this last week
[38:03] here and I was going to try and uh move
[38:06] into something greater as far as uh I
[38:10] already had the certification but I lost
[38:12] it and I wanted to get recertified on
[38:15] something and uh so I went and signed up
[38:18] with it and here it was going to cost me
[38:20] four Wednesday Services I'd have to miss
[38:23] in fact I'd have to go it'd be two times
[38:25] a week it'd be a Monday Wednesday for
[38:28] four
[38:28] weeks and I kind of felt checked in my
[38:31] heart about doing that because you know
[38:33] we're we're a small assembly as well and
[38:35] not too many me members uh um and you
[38:39] know every person when you're at the
[38:40] house of God it counts amen you really
[38:43] pack an anointing you really pack
[38:45] strength and we really really noticed
[38:47] that when uh brother Freddy uh H Hayes
[38:50] there started coming to our church on
[38:52] Wednesday nights he was back on first
[38:53] shift finally and he started coming on
[38:55] Wednesday nights so now and then having
[38:57] him giggling and and laughing at the
[38:59] revelations and that not a not a haha
[39:02] giggling but like an giggling excitement
[39:04] the joy of the Revelation he would and
[39:06] he just kind of Giggles to me on the
[39:07] left there and just that strength of him
[39:10] hearing the word and it affect him in
[39:11] such a way to where it you know it moves
[39:14] his emotions towards God so but that has
[39:16] been such a strength to me and then you
[39:18] say say brother Cam's up preaching and
[39:20] know pray say something I'm just going
[39:21] and I look back like this and he'll be
[39:24] like you know someone I can look to you
[39:26] know just uh so I signed up nonetheless
[39:30] KN it was no was probably going to cost
[39:32] me four Wednesday services and um and
[39:35] then uh I was back in the back there
[39:37] delivering a a letter to brother cam
[39:39] there and uh here it was uh brother Dave
[39:42] has been working late on Wednesdays he's
[39:44] not able to sing on Wednesday so brother
[39:47] Dustin had been doing it then uh when I
[39:49] was back there brother Dustin said Hey
[39:50] Brother cam I won't be here on Wednesday
[39:52] and brother Cam's like well who's going
[39:53] to lead songs and I'm like well I I'll
[39:55] lead songs
[39:57] so that the day afterwards I canceled my
[39:59] certification and just uh I said well
[40:02] Lord this is a correction so it's
[40:05] important to be at the house of God so
[40:07] and I had a feeling I had that check in
[40:08] my heart I said well Lord as the Lord's
[40:11] will and he provided a way out to I had
[40:13] to make a choice and I had I made the
[40:15] right choice I believe so we always want
[40:17] to be faithful at the house of God so am
[40:20] anyhow as we get into this by God's
[40:22] grace everyone feeling all right this
[40:23] morning awake I'll tell you what the
[40:25] time change was a little rough me and my
[40:27] wife we had planned about getting up
[40:29] early and it was the hand of God that
[40:32] she woke up right at
[40:34] 8:00 and we barely just made it here by
[40:36] God's grace
[40:37] but thank God she's a morning more of a
[40:40] morning person than I am and uh you know
[40:43] I was born you know guess when I was
[40:44] born 2:55
[40:47] p.m. and I let you you let me sleep on
[40:49] Saturday that's when I'm about to wake
[40:51] up right there that's I'm just being
[40:53] honest that's just the truth is my wife
[40:55] my son that's right sure
[40:57] so I don't know if that's always
[40:58] affected me but that's just how the Lord
[41:00] has designed
[41:02] me uh for whatever reason uh but God
[41:05] knows all things so uh in this topic
[41:09] here this study it's good seeing all of
[41:10] you and uh we trust that this morning
[41:12] will be a blessing to you we're going to
[41:14] uh dive into some things here and we
[41:17] want to be a blessing to the house of
[41:19] God we want to be edifying to the bride
[41:21] I when I come uh and I get you usually I
[41:25] pretty pretty much believe my my little
[41:27] Ministry whatever God's called me to
[41:28] teach here is pretty much for my two
[41:30] brothers I mean that's who uses me and
[41:32] uh literally the few that actually do
[41:35] and uh so I believe that when I approach
[41:37] you that you are the bride of Christ and
[41:39] I want to stay with the word the very
[41:41] best that I can and will say what the
[41:44] Lord would has shown me and and I trust
[41:47] that God will will bless it by God's
[41:48] grace so amen amen but Mal I like the
[41:52] suit I really like that suit that's a
[41:53] nice
[41:54] suit so um so this morning I would like
[41:59] to uh Minister on this by God's grace
[42:02] Beyond Pentecost what is beyond
[42:05] Pentecost and what are we aiming at what
[42:08] is the end result and I'll say like this
[42:10] for those that have
[42:13] heard have heard the word of
[42:17] God and we all have testimonies we all
[42:20] have uh our paths that we had to walk
[42:24] through in
[42:25] life and some of us came up uh uh you
[42:28] know the young ones here grew up in the
[42:30] message a lot of us the majority of us
[42:32] have not and the path if we could give
[42:35] testimony of testimony brother Austin is
[42:36] an amazing testimony of here and there
[42:39] and this and this brother amen has his
[42:42] his testimony brother Malachi is like
[42:44] the lord gave me parents my dad's a my
[42:47] dad's a bishop I'm a bishop uh uh the BL
[42:50] the bishop lamb
[42:52] right so everybody's got their testimony
[42:55] everybody's got their thing on how God
[42:57] has brought them to the truth and I'll
[42:59] say like this you know brother B was was
[43:01] talking about uh uh brother brother da
[43:04] there one time and he said he said he
[43:06] said that light flashed before brother
[43:08] da one time and it struck and he was
[43:12] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ at
[43:14] an old man and and God healed him then
[43:17] even as he was getting sick and then uh
[43:20] uh then of course then he went on to be
[43:21] with the Lord but it all it took was
[43:23] that one time to strike and God did
[43:25] something it did something to his soul
[43:27] it affected him in such a way that he
[43:29] had to get baptized in the name of Jesus
[43:31] Christ so here we all have that same
[43:33] testimony something about the word that
[43:35] was spoken something about the way it
[43:37] was presented maybe the way a brother or
[43:39] sister walked or what they said or a
[43:41] sermon that was preached or a life that
[43:43] was lived how something has affected
[43:44] your life in such a way that here you
[43:47] are right now and we all and baptized in
[43:50] the name of Jesus Christ and believe
[43:52] saints of God that we're moving into
[43:54] greater things and and the key obviously
[43:55] the the whole key is I was able to share
[43:57] with uh a man um I've been trying to
[44:00] meet with him on on Tuesdays right after
[44:02] work we'll go and sit at Subway there I
[44:04] have to go right from my job right to
[44:05] Subway wait there for him for an hour
[44:07] and then we get there and we start
[44:08] talking I was trying to emphasize to
[44:10] this man this brother and I'll say he's
[44:13] Justified I'll say like that he is
[44:15] Justified uh but I said brother you've
[44:17] got to move on and receive the baptism
[44:20] of the Holy Ghost BN that then you are a
[44:22] new creature in Christ Jesus and that is
[44:25] the only thing that availeth anything
[44:27] right there amen so pray for him he's a
[44:32] fine man been through a very rough life
[44:35] had a very rough life and uh but God is
[44:38] faithful and he's very appreciative when
[44:41] we meet and at the end he said Simon he
[44:43] says you don't know what this means to
[44:45] me and just letting him talk letting him
[44:47] talk for the majority of time about this
[44:50] and rehash things uh of his life and
[44:52] things that scars that the the bind him
[44:55] scars that just just affect him in such
[44:56] a way but then I try and sew in the word
[44:59] of God you know just this and this and
[45:01] he'll he'll then sew some word to me and
[45:03] we'll just speak and we're just kind of
[45:04] just just trying to be a brother to him
[45:07] right amen so um God bless you uh in
[45:11] this first quote here I want to say now
[45:12] notice uh the prophet of God and I'll
[45:15] say like this when I first come and
[45:16] heard this
[45:17] word and I realize the importance of it
[45:21] I realize the impact that this could
[45:23] have and I heard this mystery and I
[45:26] heard the god and I heard the the servy
[45:28] and I heard about the Prophet this this
[45:30] and I thought my goodness I'm move I'm
[45:32] going to come to a church that has the
[45:34] book of Acts operating in it right and
[45:38] uh so when I first started coming then
[45:40] to uh the the word of God and I was like
[45:43] wow this is amazing but then I found out
[45:45] that uh we're not quite there
[45:47] yet they get guess what we're all just
[45:50] regular
[45:52] people we're all have the same faults
[45:54] and failures that the world has
[45:56] absolutely that's right there's no great
[45:58] ones Among Us there's no one high
[45:59] there's no one I can say just wow this
[46:01] one stands out a little bit more than
[46:02] the other though some you know however
[46:04] you want to say it maybe you're a little
[46:05] biased towards this brother or this
[46:06] sister however just because the love and
[46:08] the fellowship or the the connection
[46:10] that you have with them but all in all
[46:13] we're all still pressing towards that
[46:15] High Mark right we're all just striving
[46:18] to get closer to the Lord God Almighty
[46:20] and uh
[46:23] so um
[46:26] when I was in Pentecost there and you
[46:28] know brother Jesse knows all about that
[46:30] about how it was there and there was a
[46:32] hungering for something greater there
[46:33] was always just S as soon as I when I
[46:35] got saved really saved I said man I'm
[46:37] all in started rolling rolling with the
[46:39] with that assembly and however and then
[46:41] there was just something that called for
[46:43] something has got to be more to this
[46:44] word and what God sent it right amen so
[46:47] that's where and I had that same feeling
[46:51] uh years and years and years and years
[46:52] back about even this message I see I see
[46:54] where it is I see how great the word of
[46:56] I see God doing signs on his miracles
[46:58] which we had back in Pentecost uh we see
[47:00] all those things but I think there's
[47:02] just I believe that there's a greater
[47:03] even a higher level right that we can
[47:05] move on to now in uh this one right here
[47:08] he says I'm going to try and give you my
[47:10] text while you're turning he's my uh my
[47:12] tonight is uh text is uh desperations
[47:16] and I and I in desperations now you know
[47:18] what desperation is and now we're going
[47:20] to read from Jeremiah 29 ver verse 10 he
[47:23] says for thus say the Lord that after 70
[47:26] years be accomplished at Babylon I will
[47:28] visit you and perform my good word
[47:30] toward you in causing you to return to
[47:33] this place no has there be a restoration
[47:35] or returning back to what they were at
[47:37] the beginning right he says for I know
[47:40] the thoughts that I have towards you he
[47:42] says isn't that sweet that God knows
[47:45] your very battles the very things in
[47:47] your
[47:49] life the the church fell in in the
[47:53] Ephesian Church age the whole church
[47:55] fell right there in that first age but
[47:58] he's going to bring us back to the
[47:59] beginning why because that was in his
[48:01] thoughts to bring you back to the start
[48:03] right he says he says the Lord though
[48:07] thoughts of peace and not of evil and
[48:10] not of evil but he's brother Sai he said
[48:13] we're gonna have the bride is goingon to
[48:14] have a rough time at the end yeah but
[48:15] it's not going to be evil you're not
[48:18] going to taste you're not gonna you're
[48:19] not going to see the
[48:21] effects of what we are supposed to go
[48:24] through we're going to be withheld from
[48:26] the Great Tribulation right amen and you
[48:30] know we do not want to be here God
[48:31] granted that none of us Lord that de
[48:33] bride no no one would miss this that
[48:35] they would enter right into the Holy
[48:37] Ghost and receive it and then be caught
[48:39] up together with you Lord God when that
[48:41] great shout voice and Trump come amen he
[48:44] says he says for the thoughts of peace
[48:46] and not of evil to give you the accepted
[48:48] he says and accepted and right he says
[48:52] then shall you call upon me and you
[48:54] shall go and pray pray unto me and I
[48:56] will hearken unto
[48:57] you and you shall seek me and find me
[49:00] when you search for me with all your
[49:02] heart he says and I will be found of you
[49:04] sayeth the Lord and I turn away your
[49:06] captivity and I will gather you from All
[49:07] Nations and from all the places where
[49:09] I've drove you sayith the Lord and bring
[49:11] you again back unto the place which I
[49:13] caus you to be carried away captive and
[49:16] then the prophet says what he says back
[49:17] to
[49:19] Pentecost he says I put that in myself
[49:22] it doesn't say that that's what I was
[49:24] meaning to the church right he was
[49:25] applying Something Old Testament he's
[49:28] looking at the scripture the old
[49:29] prophesying of the Jews but then he's
[49:31] applying it what to the Gentile bride
[49:33] and he says we got to go back to
[49:35] Pentecost well this was in 1963 after
[49:37] the seals he said we've got to go back
[49:39] to Pentecost
[49:42] right that was my entire thought for
[49:45] years was going back to
[49:47] Pentecost he says now notice he we got
[49:49] good churches we got good churches we
[49:52] built good churches and better churches
[49:54] than we used to have that's all right
[49:55] there's there's nothing against that I'd
[49:56] like to see the church proper but
[49:58] brother I'd rather see it prosper in the
[50:01] power of the Lord than be prosper in
[50:03] worldly things amen so where is the true
[50:06] word what is true riches the true riches
[50:08] is in spiritual Revelation I'll say that
[50:11] amen because remember the UN search the
[50:14] un uh uh The unsearchable Riches of God
[50:17] Amen so the real riches are what the
[50:20] revelations contain in the Bible amen
[50:22] which are supposed to be given to the
[50:24] bride that are to be revealed to her
[50:26] amen and to have not only that not only
[50:28] the revelations but the very Life of
[50:30] Christ The Joy the peace I'll say it
[50:32] like this the who's the richest man the
[50:34] one that's at peace in great great
[50:37] trials and great tribulations and great
[50:39] this this this it's the one that's in
[50:41] peace that has the fruits of the spirit
[50:43] operating through them in the worst time
[50:44] in their life amen hallelujah and I
[50:46] would say that would be the richest man
[50:49] amen someone that can rejoice and be
[50:51] thankful for all things amen yet being
[50:53] tried very toughly amen amen those in
[50:56] persecution I'll say it like that he
[50:58] says get back he says he says get back
[51:01] to the gospel again get back to the
[51:02] power of God back to Pentecost like the
[51:05] original was but you see the trouble is
[51:07] we don't want to take that beating so
[51:10] there's a price we have to pay to get
[51:12] back there I say like that uh we just
[51:15] had a minister preaching and then uh and
[51:18] he was saying he says he says what we've
[51:19] got to do is gotta get more
[51:22] sincere then as I was speaking to
[51:24] another brother right there he says not
[51:26] only he says sincerity is
[51:29] correct he said but if we're off on the
[51:33] word sincerity will do you very
[51:36] little see so because brother said you
[51:39] can be you can be sincere but you can be
[51:41] sincerely
[51:42] wrong so what we want to do is not only
[51:45] that but we must pray for Revelation
[51:47] first that we are that the truth is
[51:49] being preached the truth is being
[51:51] revealed and then what then pray then
[51:53] what become more sincere and these
[51:55] things will start then to elevate us
[51:57] higher and higher in the word of God
[51:58] Amen
[52:00] so he says but we want don't want to
[52:02] take that beating in other words there's
[52:05] to get back to this there's a
[52:07] sacrifice yes in in the major things
[52:10] that I've sought the Lord for I've had
[52:12] the sometimes I've had to fast three to
[52:13] four
[52:14] days to get the very answer that's
[52:17] burning on my heart and I've only done
[52:19] it a few times maybe three or four but
[52:22] in that time there was such a burden and
[52:23] there was such a fire in my heart that I
[52:25] said Lord God I've got to know this
[52:27] answer Lord God and I'm going to lay
[52:29] down food I'm going to lay it all down
[52:30] I'm just going to wait on you with in
[52:32] within those three or four days he
[52:34] always gave me the
[52:35] answer by God's grace amen now
[52:40] so let's continue on
[52:43] here he says now I heard a great teacher
[52:45] not long ago say uh one great man fine
[52:48] man met me shook my hand and Define
[52:50] brother but he said the but the Acts of
[52:52] the Apostles was just the framework of
[52:54] the church huh in other words he had the
[52:57] framework out here see when the Acts of
[52:59] the Apostles was
[53:01] inside he says and these gospels are the
[53:04] framework to hold it together and
[53:07] protect it so the entire thing that was
[53:10] the whole purpose of God back then 2,000
[53:12] years ago was to build a church and he
[53:14] built that church and that church was
[53:16] the book of Acts and that was the entire
[53:18] thing but the gospels he said he says
[53:22] these gospels which is Matthew Mark Luke
[53:24] and John he says these are the he said
[53:26] the
[53:28] framework in another quote he says these
[53:31] are the the uh what do you scaffold he
[53:35] called the scaffold anyone know what a
[53:37] scaffold is when you're building on a
[53:39] building a building like putting off
[53:40] this wall and you have the uh let's see
[53:42] a brick brick layers they start at the
[53:45] bottom they lay their their Foundation
[53:46] there and they start piling the bricks
[53:47] there but they get too high for their
[53:50] legs to actually be able to reach it
[53:52] then they put a scaffold up and that's
[53:54] actually just the elev you hire to be
[53:56] able to put more bricks up in other
[53:57] words those uh they have the two sides
[53:59] they have the platform and they have the
[54:01] the uh the oh my goodness the pins not
[54:05] pins but Stakes or however you want to
[54:06] say it uh anyhow they have those little
[54:09] cross cross braces right there that's
[54:10] what they call cross braces so but he
[54:12] said these gospels he says are the uh uh
[54:15] framework that holds it up in other
[54:17] words these gospels are trying now if we
[54:19] apply these gospels these gospels here
[54:22] will actually is what God is still using
[54:24] right now now it fell back then at that
[54:26] as if it was builded and it fell it had
[54:29] to be rebuilt again right so as as as
[54:33] the as we're trying now striving to
[54:35] produce the book of Acts we need these
[54:37] scaffold he says he says or these
[54:39] framework to what rebuild this church
[54:41] right he's pointing back to the book of
[54:43] Acts he's pointing back to the gospels
[54:46] right so it takes these gospels to hold
[54:49] it and he work it together pull it
[54:52] together and protect it
[54:54] amen now notice he says the framework
[54:57] Pentecost isn't the framework of the
[54:59] Gospel the four gospels are the
[55:00] framework back to Pentecost so how are
[55:03] we going to produce this Pentecost that
[55:05] they were talking about and I'll say it
[55:07] like this not just the feeling of one
[55:09] man or one sister at different times or
[55:11] however but a coming down of the Holy
[55:13] Ghost all in one service filling us all
[55:17] at one time where the Shina of glories
[55:19] just continually just moving in waves
[55:21] and waves speaking in tongues and
[55:23] worshiping God and all those sort of
[55:24] things
[55:25] that kind of a service amen and not only
[55:27] that but a spark a Revival that to tore
[55:30] that entire that Revival is what has
[55:32] called us is still look how far that
[55:35] initial burning at actx in Pentecost in
[55:38] Jerusalem is what we are literally the T
[55:40] you ever you ever start a fire in your
[55:42] backyard you ever see fire the there's
[55:44] an initial place where you start that
[55:46] fire and it starts heating up sometimes
[55:48] a little beit pieces of grass or a stick
[55:50] or some leaves and it'll start burning
[55:52] out past your original firepl pit or
[55:55] fireplace whatever and that's exactly
[55:58] what we are this morning amen we're just
[56:00] another burnt little area up here where
[56:01] God is trying to what to get us back to
[56:04] there amen but it's still the same Holy
[56:06] Ghost burning with inside of us amen
[56:08] sure I remember brother I know brother
[56:10] justess remembers when we used to go to
[56:11] grandma smiths and we have big leaf leaf
[56:13] piles and then we burn them and then we
[56:15] have to stomp out all the other fires
[56:17] From the Start Spreading this that that
[56:19] kind of channel that kind of however but
[56:21] God didn't do that he didn't stop the
[56:23] fire he just kept them let on burning
[56:25] all the way through the world amen amen
[56:28] praise be to God and we're in that same
[56:30] channel tonight amen or this morning he
[56:32] says now notice the four gospels are the
[56:34] framework back to Pentecost after they
[56:36] had this framework up he says Pentecost
[56:38] come into
[56:40] existence so literally to bring forth
[56:43] Pentecost it took the very Life of
[56:46] Christ to be lived out and the Very
[56:49] words that he spoke the Miracles the
[56:51] sence Wonders Miracles all that he spoke
[56:53] had to be lived out first before acts
[56:57] could come into into Play
[56:59] Amen so the very things that Matthew
[57:02] heard and recorded the very things that
[57:04] Luke and Mark and John heard recorded
[57:06] were very very important in producing
[57:09] the book of Acts sure and now brother B
[57:12] said not only were they very important
[57:14] producing but they also protect that
[57:16] life right we know the throne guards up
[57:18] in heaven the zoons one's an eagle one's
[57:20] a man one is an ax and then the other
[57:22] one is a lion right and those are four C
[57:24] around the guard the Throne of God
[57:27] protecting God's presence God himself
[57:30] amen he says and down here it's the same
[57:32] way that very book of Acts presence
[57:34] which what is God in his people is
[57:37] protected by those four gospels
[57:40] right so we are very grateful for having
[57:43] eyes to see and ears to hear because if
[57:46] we had if we have those eyes to see and
[57:48] ears to hear we are able that now to
[57:50] look at these gospels and then find the
[57:52] way because Jesus said what straight and
[57:54] narrow is the gate and and straight is
[57:56] the gate and narrow is the way which
[57:58] leadth into life right sure amen he says
[58:02] he says the apostles Jesus walked along
[58:05] doing works and predicting what would
[58:06] come and Matthew Mark Luke John them
[58:08] four guards come and was writing
[58:09] everything they some seemed to come to
[58:11] pass telling it just like it is how is
[58:13] going to happen he says what was going
[58:15] to take place and all of a once they
[58:16] framed it around and here it comes right
[58:19] so
[58:23] notice these gospels are very very
[58:28] important even you tell a new believer
[58:30] you tell a new believer what they come
[58:32] to you with their Bible the brand new
[58:33] fresh Bible it's probably NIV or nsva or
[58:36] whatever The Message Bible or who knows
[58:38] what kind of crazy thing they got out
[58:39] they come say brother sister what what
[58:41] do we read first and he just just read
[58:43] the gospels
[58:44] first because what these are the not now
[58:48] all scriptures given by inspiration of
[58:49] the Holy Ghost but something about those
[58:50] red letters amen something about how if
[58:53] they can just read and try and get get
[58:54] in the spirit of what Jesus was
[58:56] experienced right there and God will
[58:58] lead them and show them what kind of
[59:01] spirit Christ was fighting what kind of
[59:02] spirit was on Christ and I like this in
[59:05] Christ amen and all the fullness of the
[59:07] godhead body dwelt within him amen sure
[59:10] that's right exactly now notice he says
[59:12] he says it is the spirit that speaketh
[59:15] to the churches that is plural not
[59:17] singular Spirit did not have John write
[59:19] this down for a local Ephesian church he
[59:21] says nor uh for the first church age
[59:24] only it was for all Church ages but this
[59:26] is the Church of the beginnings and thus
[59:29] it is like the Book of Genesis what
[59:31] started in Genesis holds true through
[59:33] the entire word he says and finally Clos
[59:35] out in Revelation thus the church
[59:38] beginning in Acts is God's blueprint for
[59:40] all ages until she closes out lives in
[59:42] other words all every age every church
[59:45] is striving to be what back to acts our
[59:49] goal is back to acts right our goal is
[59:52] to produce this and such a way way sure
[59:56] yes and that was my mindset for a long
[59:58] time amen was going back to this and
[1:00:00] producing this right
[1:00:04] now uh and I'll say it like
[1:00:08] this we have the blueprint
[1:00:12] here we have this blueprint right here
[1:00:14] which is the book of Acts which we have
[1:00:16] the whole entire word of God all the
[1:00:18] Epistles all the revelation of Jesus
[1:00:20] Christ we have all this information here
[1:00:23] this is our blueprint right here say
[1:00:24] like that right we know this and we have
[1:00:26] to go back to the blueprint and I'll say
[1:00:28] like this I'm on jobs all the time where
[1:00:30] they have blueprints or we know they're
[1:00:32] not blue anymore they're just white
[1:00:33] they're just prints we just call them
[1:00:35] prints right they're not blue anymore
[1:00:36] but maybe in the original draft how they
[1:00:38] do it now but now it's just white big
[1:00:40] long pieces of paper with all laid out
[1:00:42] you got 20 30 40 50 sheets and you got
[1:00:44] to go through this you got to check this
[1:00:45] with this got to check this you're
[1:00:46] laying your plumbing in you got to check
[1:00:47] your submittals you got to look at this
[1:00:48] then you got to go what's the ceiling
[1:00:50] Heights what's the floor Heights what's
[1:00:51] this this you got to get dialed all in
[1:00:53] so you can set your Fisher perfect right
[1:00:54] right but it's all contained in the
[1:00:56] blueprints in other words when I get
[1:00:58] done with my plumbing and I had the
[1:01:01] prince right there guess who's got to
[1:01:02] come behind me and I I just worked for
[1:01:04] my brother-in-law brother
[1:01:06] Dustin now he doesn't know much about
[1:01:08] Plumbing but now I think he does now he
[1:01:11] said S I need you to do this for my on
[1:01:12] on this job I said sure I come in this
[1:01:14] is this he's like well brother s what
[1:01:15] about this I said no do it this way what
[1:01:17] about this I do it this way this way
[1:01:19] this way this way this is how you do
[1:01:20] this he's like ah okay okay now I'm
[1:01:22] teaching him right
[1:01:25] on these Revelations on the the prints
[1:01:28] on Plumbing prints right how do you
[1:01:30] exactly look at these prints and what do
[1:01:32] you do with them now he had order he had
[1:01:34] made a parts list and he had this this
[1:01:35] this and I said brother that print
[1:01:37] according to that prce he said that's to
[1:01:39] me I consider that a
[1:01:41] suggestion because they do everything to
[1:01:43] minimum code I said if you do it minimum
[1:01:45] code he says it's gets confusing and
[1:01:46] then you start ordering this fitting
[1:01:47] with this thing and I said just order
[1:01:50] everything this kind of way and he's
[1:01:51] like okay okay so I had to go get my own
[1:01:53] parts and that sort of thing
[1:01:55] right but he seen you know when I got
[1:01:58] stressed
[1:01:59] out the day before every inspection
[1:02:02] because when that inspector and as I'm
[1:02:05] prepping for the inspector I see it as a
[1:02:07] type of the Holy Spirit coming through
[1:02:09] my life amen and if he says if that if
[1:02:12] that test doesn't hold if he sees that
[1:02:14] gaze drop one little micrometer he said
[1:02:17] or millimeter whatever you want to say
[1:02:18] it is he says there's something leaking
[1:02:20] I'm like now I got an issue but we were
[1:02:23] able by the grace of God to find any
[1:02:25] leaks we're able to find this find that
[1:02:27] make sure everything was in the walls
[1:02:29] you had to put your strike strike plates
[1:02:30] up you got to put your boa plates up you
[1:02:32] got to make sure everything's tied in
[1:02:33] everything's
[1:02:36] pressurized then the inspector comes
[1:02:41] in okay looks good signed off here's
[1:02:43] your ticket we'll see you at second
[1:02:46] rough
[1:02:48] okay oh you only get one inspection no
[1:02:50] there's three or four inspections in
[1:02:53] plumbing I said said guess what after
[1:02:55] the first inspection you think I was
[1:02:57] celebrating no cuz I got two more you
[1:03:00] don't celebrate until that can hols
[1:03:02] buddy I don't care how good this looks I
[1:03:04] don't care how I like this even in our
[1:03:06] churches we have victories we have
[1:03:07] testimonies but SS of God I'm not fully
[1:03:09] celebrating until what we make it over
[1:03:12] amen but I'll say like this if we can
[1:03:14] catch the Revelation that we've already
[1:03:17] made it we can celebrate right now amen
[1:03:21] because who are you trusting on I like
[1:03:23] this are they trusting in a plumber to
[1:03:24] get this thing done no I'm this plumber
[1:03:26] right here is trusting in God to help me
[1:03:29] get that can to float amen and saints of
[1:03:31] God if you could see God in your life
[1:03:33] you are trusting in Him to make this in
[1:03:35] this Rapture amen praise be to God sure
[1:03:39] now notice he says thus this church
[1:03:42] beginning is in Acts is God's blueprint
[1:03:45] for all ages until she closes out SS of
[1:03:47] God and when the inspector comes we've
[1:03:49] got to be lined up exactly according to
[1:03:51] the beginning
[1:03:53] Hallelujah
[1:03:55] when the inspector
[1:03:56] comes what is the inspector the Holy
[1:03:59] Ghost is here right now the Bible says
[1:04:00] wherever two or three he is here right
[1:04:02] now and Lord God forgive us all yes L
[1:04:06] all of our iniquities secret faults
[1:04:07] everything Lord God just place on the
[1:04:09] blood but when he comes here this
[1:04:10] morning are we in condition are we
[1:04:13] looking just like the original blueprint
[1:04:15] are is is our assemblies like the
[1:04:18] blueprint it's humbling I know I said
[1:04:21] like this I'm I'm not I don't see what I
[1:04:23] want to see in my life amen but I hear I
[1:04:25] say like this when I hear the prophet
[1:04:26] talking when I hear him preaching those
[1:04:28] things I hear the very love that he has
[1:04:30] for Jesus Christ and one of the studies
[1:04:32] I just taught brother said he say he
[1:04:34] says I cannot have my love marred by
[1:04:37] anything but it must be for the Lord
[1:04:39] Jesus Christ he goes my love for my wife
[1:04:41] could Mar my love for Christ my love for
[1:04:43] my children could Mar my love for Christ
[1:04:45] my love for my hobbies my love for the
[1:04:49] the church my love for this this
[1:04:50] anything outside of Christ he says can
[1:04:52] Mar your love for Christ
[1:04:54] right he says he says a lot of times he
[1:04:57] goes I don't even get to express my love
[1:04:59] for my own family he says because it
[1:05:01] would Mar my love for Christ and I read
[1:05:04] that and I'm just like gosh I said Lord
[1:05:08] God you got to help me Lord I want every
[1:05:11] I want my and I I was like this if we
[1:05:13] could we would change ourselves to be
[1:05:15] exactly I was like this if we could do
[1:05:18] it physically I would just like hold
[1:05:20] this over here and just let it drop and
[1:05:21] I just clothe right into it I just turn
[1:05:23] right into it
[1:05:24] [Laughter]
[1:05:26] but it's a daily walk it's a it's based
[1:05:29] on your trials did you pass the test
[1:05:31] this week Saints did you pass this then
[1:05:33] when someone pul you down or tried your
[1:05:34] nerves or this this did you say praise
[1:05:36] the
[1:05:37] lord well God bless you brother God
[1:05:39] bless you amen or did you let something
[1:05:42] or this kind of you know oh God help
[1:05:46] me amen now now if God has a
[1:05:50] blueprint Satan has a blueprint as well
[1:05:54] oh yes in Revelation 17 he said that old
[1:05:56] had many daughters these daughters
[1:05:58] just like their mother he says they sat
[1:06:01] they set the word
[1:06:04] aside I'll say like this if I get a bill
[1:06:08] come up and I just got my check and I'm
[1:06:11] GNA be short on I have to make let's say
[1:06:13] I gotta pay my I got you gotta pay your
[1:06:15] T ties
[1:06:16] right but what if what if you don't make
[1:06:19] enough money to pay your ties and make
[1:06:21] that bill what do you
[1:06:23] choose
[1:06:24] ties we pay our
[1:06:27] ties let the bill collector come and I
[1:06:30] was like and and the Bible says what a
[1:06:32] soft answer appeases
[1:06:35] the I'm like sorry sorry guys I uh I
[1:06:39] I'll send it next week for sure I I I'll
[1:06:41] do my best by God's grace to pay that
[1:06:43] bill this this this they're like well
[1:06:44] sir you know you're like I know I know
[1:06:46] but let's just give me a little time and
[1:06:49] just talk real soft gentle maybe to the
[1:06:51] bill man bill collector he said now
[1:06:54] notice he says what did they the first
[1:06:55] thing in God's or Satan's blueprint is
[1:06:57] what they set the word aside deny the
[1:06:59] work of the spirit of God subject
[1:07:02] subjugate the Ley and make it impossible
[1:07:04] for the Le to worship God unless they
[1:07:06] come through their own
[1:07:09] pattern well this is how we worship
[1:07:12] without getting a little too Pentecostal
[1:07:14] or maybe getting too much too excited or
[1:07:16] too can be fanatical saints of God a
[1:07:19] little fire is better than no fire
[1:07:22] somebody just told me brother Jess had a
[1:07:24] powerful service here so we're all
[1:07:25] dancing and shouting and screaming
[1:07:26] saints of God that's exactly right get
[1:07:30] excited for Jesus amen thank God for it
[1:07:33] amen and just worship why because God
[1:07:35] inhibits the praise of his people amen
[1:07:37] sure absolutely what CU God loves to see
[1:07:39] a people excited about him I say like
[1:07:42] this if I would come home from a hard
[1:07:44] day of work my wife was like at the
[1:07:45] front door got my dog all primmed and
[1:07:48] this guy got his jacket on and
[1:07:50] everything and then she's all dialed in
[1:07:51] and this and that and she's got food
[1:07:53] there and just like wel some welcomes me
[1:07:54] in like a king I'd be like whoa what's
[1:07:58] today what name Mr our anniversary
[1:08:02] birthday I would be like well I guess
[1:08:04] I'm the king of the house I guess I am
[1:08:07] the
[1:08:09] man but notice just something similar
[1:08:11] just something like that towards God
[1:08:13] worshiping him praising him just
[1:08:15] thanking him for everything every for
[1:08:17] every trial for every for every mind
[1:08:19] battle that he delivers us out of and he
[1:08:21] keeps us and he keeps
[1:08:24] us he has kept
[1:08:26] us how what about your mind battles have
[1:08:30] they have you had some where they're so
[1:08:32] intense you feel like giving up have you
[1:08:33] had him so intense it's like what am I
[1:08:36] doing I should just leave and go back
[1:08:37] but God has kept you amen he has kept
[1:08:41] you all the way
[1:08:43] amen I've had so many mind battles just
[1:08:46] and I'll say like this I literally
[1:08:49] have spoke so evil of myself out of my
[1:08:52] own mouth Lally if if God would have
[1:08:55] honored what I said I'd probably be in
[1:08:56] hell right
[1:08:57] now because you I think so little of
[1:09:01] myself but in that I and I know exactly
[1:09:04] what time I'm referring to in my mind my
[1:09:06] memory but in that same time where I was
[1:09:08] beling belittling myself so much after
[1:09:12] like 45 minutes I said s you're just
[1:09:14] worth
[1:09:15] listen something supernaturally just
[1:09:17] came and twisted
[1:09:19] that and all of a sudden that Spirit
[1:09:22] left and I did nothing I didn't do
[1:09:25] anything I didn't pray but he had to
[1:09:28] come and Deliver Me from the very
[1:09:31] mindset I had yes now maybe someone the
[1:09:35] Lord anointed someone to pray for me uh
[1:09:37] 10 miles or 50 miles away or however at
[1:09:39] that moment and God delivered me I don't
[1:09:41] know but I know this I was in such a
[1:09:43] black State a dark state of my
[1:09:47] mind against
[1:09:49] myself against
[1:09:52] me and God had to come down to change
[1:09:56] that and it was halfway through the work
[1:09:58] day and the rest of the day I was just
[1:09:59] like I was fine that man like that man
[1:10:03] in the
[1:10:04] gines he was cutting himself he didn't
[1:10:06] like himself he say had self-hatred this
[1:10:09] and this and don't care about his his
[1:10:11] wife and family didn't care he just left
[1:10:12] and became a wild
[1:10:14] man than God that that those Spirits are
[1:10:17] still alive today but God has kept us
[1:10:21] amen amen now notice we'll get into this
[1:10:24] here real quick here he says through he
[1:10:27] says he says and they make impossible
[1:10:29] for Ley to to worship God unless they
[1:10:31] come through them or through their
[1:10:32] pattern which is nothing but a blueprint
[1:10:34] of unbelief from Satan himself right now
[1:10:39] if if the the gospels are the the guards
[1:10:43] or the framework or the scaffold if you
[1:10:47] will notice the protection the book The
[1:10:49] Matthew 24 has we're just going to run
[1:10:52] through this because I got a lot we're
[1:10:53] already
[1:10:54] 37 minutes in notice the protection of
[1:10:57] Matthew what is the truth here what is
[1:10:59] the true Revelation this is the true
[1:11:00] Revelation right here
[1:11:03] right but in Matthew that first book of
[1:11:06] the gospels God places this Jesus says
[1:11:10] this specific scripture in such a way SS
[1:11:13] of God do you know this scripture right
[1:11:15] here will keep the majority of people
[1:11:16] out of
[1:11:18] Heaven 99 95 90% of all people who do
[1:11:23] not make go go to heaven that are
[1:11:25] claimed to be Christians this scripture
[1:11:27] right here will will keep them
[1:11:30] out do you understand that this is a
[1:11:33] throne
[1:11:34] guard yes amen this keeps them if they
[1:11:38] believe this scripture without
[1:11:41] Revelation if they do not understand
[1:11:44] what he is talking about right here they
[1:11:46] will go into tribulation that's right
[1:11:49] they will at
[1:11:50] best be foolish virgin that's
[1:11:57] right Throne
[1:11:59] guard but this right here is the this is
[1:12:02] it right here this is the
[1:12:05] blueprint if you don't have if God does
[1:12:07] not come to you and give you eyes to see
[1:12:10] and ears to hear and give you Revelation
[1:12:13] you'll never be be able to understand
[1:12:15] what this means Hallelujah right well
[1:12:18] brother Sai brother Jess uh Pastor Jess
[1:12:21] uh that it says what it is it says exact
[1:12:23] what it
[1:12:24] means does it yeah if you have the
[1:12:28] revelation of what he's
[1:12:31] saying but if you don't you're going to
[1:12:33] miss it very sincere
[1:12:36] people just might when at work and I
[1:12:38] witness to him he's like well brother I
[1:12:40] know I see where you're going I'm no I'm
[1:12:42] GNA stay with this like please I'm not
[1:12:43] going to argue with him praise the Lord
[1:12:45] praise the Lord amen notice
[1:12:50] here Mark 16 and he say to them go into
[1:12:53] all the world and preach the gospel to
[1:12:55] Every Creature he that believeth and is
[1:12:56] baptized shall be saved notice I was
[1:12:59] baptized brother look I was baptized
[1:13:01] this way and I am saved because what I
[1:13:03] believed I was baptized notice Mark is a
[1:13:08] guard protecting the Throne of God
[1:13:10] protecting the very presence the very
[1:13:11] life of protecting eternal
[1:13:15] life he says in these signs he says he
[1:13:18] he believeth and baptized shall be saved
[1:13:19] but he that believeth not shall be
[1:13:21] damned so notice if they do not believe
[1:13:24] they will not truly be
[1:13:27] baptized being baptized F the Holy Ghost
[1:13:29] is not being
[1:13:30] baptized that is a false impersonation
[1:13:33] just like I said this a a a fake $1 bill
[1:13:36] is not a $1
[1:13:39] bill why don't need to get re-baptized
[1:13:41] technically there is no such thing as
[1:13:45] uh
[1:13:51] well well what is the scripture scpt say
[1:13:53] let me see
[1:13:55] here in Acts 19 let's just go right to
[1:13:58] it acts
[1:14:03] 19 does it say
[1:14:06] rebaptism notice they were already
[1:14:08] baptized in John under John's
[1:14:11] baptism he says and what you were
[1:14:14] baptized he said
[1:14:16] then then Paul said John verely baptized
[1:14:19] with baptism repentance saying unto the
[1:14:21] people that they should believe on him
[1:14:22] which should be come after that is on
[1:14:23] Christ Jesus and when they hear this
[1:14:24] they were baptized didn't say they were
[1:14:26] re-baptized they were
[1:14:29] baptized see so that was just that was
[1:14:33] just a substitute
[1:14:36] baptism it was a foreshadowing it was a
[1:14:39] it was something before the real had
[1:14:42] come just like those in the Red Sea that
[1:14:44] went through under Moses that was not
[1:14:46] baptism the true baptism see but we had
[1:14:50] to get baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:14:52] Christ
[1:14:54] amen now notice not not not only does he
[1:14:56] Pro protect baptism but he also protects
[1:14:59] this and he who believeth in baptized
[1:15:00] shall be saved but and these signs shall
[1:15:02] follow them that believe in my name
[1:15:04] shall they cast out Devils they shall
[1:15:05] speak with new tongues and shall take up
[1:15:07] serpents and if they drink any deadly
[1:15:09] thing shall not hurt them they shall be
[1:15:10] laid on hands on the sick and they shall
[1:15:13] recover notice it protects
[1:15:17] also the wonders of the powers of God
[1:15:20] healing all those things that protects
[1:15:22] them
[1:15:23] because some saywell I was baptized by
[1:15:25] The Ghost and I still have signs wers
[1:15:27] Miracles the Bible says you shall not
[1:15:29] know them by their signs he says you'll
[1:15:31] know them by their
[1:15:35] fruit what is Matthew 7 says uh Lord
[1:15:38] Lord have we not done this and done that
[1:15:41] in thy name these wonderful works and
[1:15:43] Jesus say what he said depart from me
[1:15:44] you workers of iniquity right so you can
[1:15:47] have signs wonders and miracles
[1:15:49] testimonies this this but if you're not
[1:15:50] obeying the word of God and know to do
[1:15:54] it it's a dangerous place to be right
[1:15:56] yes sir amen now notice what Luke Luke
[1:16:00] right here is protecting the book of
[1:16:01] Acts I'm just pulling these are just
[1:16:03] quotes in the script the message I'm
[1:16:05] just doing without the quotes in Luke
[1:16:07] 10:1 he says after these things the Lord
[1:16:09] appointed and others Al other 70 also he
[1:16:12] sent them two and two by two by two in
[1:16:14] his face and every city place whether he
[1:16:16] himself would come therefore he said to
[1:16:18] him the the harvest truly is great but
[1:16:20] the labors are few pray therefore the
[1:16:21] lord of the Harvest he would send for
[1:16:23] labors into his Harvest go your ways he
[1:16:27] says behold I sent you forth as Lambs
[1:16:28] Among Wolves he says carry neither Pur
[1:16:31] nor script nor shoes and slute no man by
[1:16:33] the way in other words and brother BR
[1:16:35] breaks all these things down he says
[1:16:36] look he said when you go he don't try
[1:16:38] try to take as little as possible take
[1:16:40] as little as possible he he he says
[1:16:42] don't even take any money script uses us
[1:16:44] that he says and and as you go have have
[1:16:46] the leading of the Lord to where you
[1:16:48] know exactly where you're supposed to go
[1:16:49] and don't stop anywhere
[1:16:52] else this is how the original book of
[1:16:54] Acts performed their works right here
[1:16:56] this is their life right here this is
[1:16:58] exactly how they lived but what here is
[1:17:01] Luke is showing it but if they don't
[1:17:03] catch the revelation of what's the big
[1:17:05] thing now what we see the big name
[1:17:07] ministers as far in denomination they'll
[1:17:10] take their private jets and they'll fly
[1:17:13] and have carbon emissions beyond what I
[1:17:15] could do in a year or a
[1:17:18] lifetime just to go over and preach one
[1:17:20] sermon or a whole two day or three day
[1:17:23] crade re rent rent the biggest uh uh
[1:17:26] fstar Hotel they can and whoever who
[1:17:28] knows
[1:17:28] where all this and this and that's
[1:17:31] contrary to the word of God and they'll
[1:17:33] never be able to produce the book of
[1:17:34] Acts because it went contrary to this
[1:17:36] amenah sure now let's continue on here
[1:17:39] now here's the big
[1:17:41] one notice where this is
[1:17:43] recorded under the eagle
[1:17:47] anointing very very I saying to you he
[1:17:49] that believeth on me the works that I
[1:17:50] shall do he shall do also in great
[1:17:53] Greater Works than these shall he do
[1:17:54] because I go unto my
[1:17:56] father see this is the eagle brother B
[1:17:59] said he called this the eagle of
[1:18:01] angelist he said and these are Greater
[1:18:03] Works that you will do what of this
[1:18:05] Eagle anointing he says because I go
[1:18:07] unto my father he says whatsoever you
[1:18:09] shall ask in my name that will I do in
[1:18:11] the father that may glorify uh may be
[1:18:13] glorified in the son and it shall and if
[1:18:15] you ask anything in my name I will do
[1:18:18] it but what's one of the qualifications
[1:18:20] everybody uh remember uh
[1:18:23] uh Jesse
[1:18:26] duplis back when uh was it Katrina or
[1:18:29] however was coming around there wiping
[1:18:31] he had he had his whole church fasting
[1:18:33] and praying and he spoke against the
[1:18:34] storm and it missed his
[1:18:37] church and he linked it he in his sermon
[1:18:40] he says he linked it to this he says if
[1:18:41] I ask anything in his name and yet they
[1:18:44] baptized fals wow but remember these
[1:18:48] Greater Works are not the goal the goal
[1:18:51] is Pentecost yes the life do we want the
[1:18:54] power or do we want the
[1:18:56] life see the life is everything you can
[1:18:59] have every sign Wonder Miracle following
[1:19:01] you but if you don't have eternal life
[1:19:03] we'll miss it
[1:19:06] amen but remember the true bride will
[1:19:09] have both power and eternal life amen
[1:19:13] and they'll be able to point the Bible
[1:19:14] say they be Point others to life as well
[1:19:16] and get them there amen praise be to God
[1:19:19] it's a such a fine line the Christian
[1:19:21] walk notice in John 157 he says if ye
[1:19:24] now here's the key if ye abide in me and
[1:19:27] my words abide in you ye shall ask what
[1:19:29] you will and it shall be done unto you
[1:19:32] but what we've got to have the word of
[1:19:34] God running through us saturating us the
[1:19:39] very the very sermons that Pastor Jesse
[1:19:41] is preaching and these scriptures and
[1:19:43] everything the revelations he's bringing
[1:19:44] has got to be running through us to
[1:19:47] where you and the word become
[1:19:49] one here and is my father glorified you
[1:19:51] may bear much fruit watch signs and
[1:19:53] wonders
[1:19:54] Miracles he says so shall you be my
[1:19:58] disciples
[1:19:59] amen praise the Lord now let me let me
[1:20:03] show you a little in our day let me me
[1:20:06] show you the production in our
[1:20:08] day and we've seen so many battles on
[1:20:11] this in Matthew
[1:20:14] 11 very very I say unto you among them
[1:20:17] that are born of women there shall n sh
[1:20:19] not raise has risen a greater than John
[1:20:22] the Baptist
[1:20:23] notwithstanding he that least in the
[1:20:24] Kingdom shall be greater than he Kingdom
[1:20:27] of Heaven shall be greater than and from
[1:20:28] that days of John until now the Kingdom
[1:20:30] of Heaven suffered violence and the
[1:20:31] violent takeen by forth for all the
[1:20:33] prophets and the law prophesied unto
[1:20:34] John and if you receive it this is Elias
[1:20:37] which was for to come and this scripture
[1:20:41] right here will protect many people I
[1:20:43] like this will guard many people from
[1:20:46] being able to see this message brother
[1:20:48] brah is not Malachi 4 look it's John the
[1:20:51] Baptist he's Elijah or
[1:20:55] elas look brother Sai look John Jesus
[1:20:59] him God in flesh said John the Baptist
[1:21:02] Was Elijah to come when that when when
[1:21:05] was that Malachi 45 what what happened
[1:21:07] directly as Mal Malachi 45 The Book of
[1:21:12] Matthew guarding what eternal life well
[1:21:16] why is it so important to guard the
[1:21:17] messeng of the hour because this message
[1:21:19] of the hour this messenger was brought
[1:21:22] to restore all things this is not just
[1:21:26] guarding that first church age this is
[1:21:28] not guarding the first church age this
[1:21:29] is guarding the last Church age to where
[1:21:32] what the word had to be restored and
[1:21:33] what do we find the Resto restored word
[1:21:35] the true baptism and the true eternal
[1:21:37] life the true Jesus Christ not God in
[1:21:40] three persons but God in one
[1:21:43] person this right here we went through
[1:21:47] this when we come to this scripture we
[1:21:50] walked right in past it because we had
[1:21:53] God gave us eyes to see and understand
[1:21:56] what it really
[1:21:58] was

[1:22:03] Gate amen that's Judah amen that's the
[1:22:06] East Gate we want right on through well
[1:22:08] how many did we have to go through we
[1:22:09] had to go through this one too and Jesus
[1:22:11] answered then said well we thought Elias
[1:22:13] was supposed to come
[1:22:15] first and Jesus answer said truly Elias
[1:22:17] shall come first and restore all things
[1:22:19] okay well then he says that Elias has
[1:22:22] come already already you knew him not
[1:22:23] look it is John the Baptist but we went
[1:22:25] right on because God revealed us now if
[1:22:28] we would if we would have stopped there
[1:22:30] m Matthew 11 we would have been stuck if
[1:22:33] we couldn't see but then God gave us
[1:22:35] greater light here that says what he
[1:22:36] says there is an Elias to come he sh he
[1:22:39] shall come and restore all things and
[1:22:42] then AR ah there it is there's two
[1:22:45] Elijah amen and fact then we Catch Re
[1:22:47] there's five Elijah oh my goodness then
[1:22:49] the whole revelation of them we walk
[1:22:50] right right go right in the book of Acts
[1:22:51] and baptized
[1:22:55] see guard look at all the guards you had
[1:22:58] to
[1:22:59] bypass I say this you walked right past
[1:23:02] said nice to meet you Mr guard Matthew
[1:23:04] nice to meet you I'm going in he's like
[1:23:06] all right you see it yep I see okay
[1:23:08] [Laughter]
[1:23:11] thank remember
[1:23:16] it's well it just looks like a book look
[1:23:19] how spiritual this is this is a
[1:23:22] spiritual
[1:23:23] kingdom yes therefore if this is a
[1:23:26] spiritual Kingdom this has spiritual
[1:23:29] guards this is a supernatural spiritual
[1:23:33] guard situation here wait because
[1:23:37] because I read a scripture and didn't
[1:23:38] understand it I'm not going to enter in
[1:23:40] yeah exactly because you're trying to
[1:23:42] enter into something spiritual you have
[1:23:44] to have spiritual eyes to enter
[1:23:48] in it is spiritual and if you can
[1:23:51] understand this if God has revealed you
[1:23:53] this and revealed you this you're going
[1:23:56] through amen amen praise the Lord now
[1:24:00] notice
[1:24:02] here you want to go see the eagle
[1:24:04] testimony of this and
[1:24:10] this now notice Matthew says John the
[1:24:13] Baptist John the Baptist but then when
[1:24:15] we come to the north gate or the eagle
[1:24:19] gate spiritual gate John
[1:24:22] the Revelator the type of the Bride
[1:24:25] would be the only ones to catch this
[1:24:28] Revelation notice how open now notice
[1:24:31] how Open this gate on the North side is
[1:24:35] notice how the eagle anointing gate is
[1:24:37] wide open for eyes to see and ears to
[1:24:41] hear remember you have to go from light
[1:24:44] to light to light if we fail to miss one
[1:24:47] light in that path we're going to miss
[1:24:48] it
[1:24:51] right and this is the record of John
[1:24:53] when the Jews sent priests and Levites
[1:24:54] to Jerusalem ask him who art thou he
[1:24:57] says and he confessed he but confess he
[1:24:59] says I am not the Christ and they asked
[1:25:02] him what then art thou
[1:25:06] Elias and he sath I am not wait a second
[1:25:11] he says art thou that Prophet what
[1:25:14] prophet is that Malachi 4 that's the
[1:25:16] only one Elias Malachi 4 Elias Malachi 4
[1:25:20] Elias he says and he answered
[1:25:24] no but for the those on the eagle
[1:25:27] anointing those under the anointed Eagle
[1:25:30] evangelist that went across seven
[1:25:34] times this is our gate this is where we
[1:25:36] enter in Saints this is our gate right
[1:25:38] here right and if we were able to notice
[1:25:40] this is the first chapter of
[1:25:43] John he didn't want you to miss anything
[1:25:46] else but this is the first chapter he
[1:25:48] says well he makes that first little
[1:25:49] thing step easy why because we
[1:25:51] understand that that John the Baptist
[1:25:53] was not Malachi
[1:25:54] for amen
[1:25:56] [Music]
[1:25:57] amen well brother side what's it
[1:25:59] protecting what is this protecting
[1:26:00] what's m Matthew 11 protecting this
[1:26:02] right here repent you therefore and be
[1:26:04] converted that your sins may be BL out
[1:26:06] from the from for when the times are
[1:26:08] refreshing shall come from the presence
[1:26:09] of the Lord and He Shall send Jesus
[1:26:11] Christ was poor priest whom Heaven Must
[1:26:13] receive until the times of restitutions
[1:26:17] of all things that's what the
[1:26:19] restoration of all things see look
[1:26:22] there's the book of Acts right there
[1:26:24] right amen showing you what that the
[1:26:25] prophet would be sent but was guarded by
[1:26:28] the guards but within that throne room
[1:26:30] within the presence of God he's released
[1:26:32] and revealed there's going to be a
[1:26:34] restitution there's going to be a
[1:26:35] restoration of a prophet right he says
[1:26:39] uh he said by the mouth of God all his
[1:26:41] Holy Apostles the world began for Moses
[1:26:43] truly said unto the fathers a prophet of
[1:26:46] the Lord shall your God raise up unto
[1:26:48] you your brethren like unto me and he
[1:26:49] shall hear all things whatsoever shall
[1:26:51] say unto them amen
[1:26:53] see what we've received
[1:26:55] this if you're sitting here you've
[1:26:57] received that you saw it God opened your
[1:26:59] eyes to
[1:27:01] thisen and this leads us right to the
[1:27:04] book of Acts so now I want to I'm sure
[1:27:08] brother Jess may have taught this before
[1:27:10] because he's taught so much
[1:27:12] stuff three services a
[1:27:15] week videos I
[1:27:18] mean BR J I'm not I'm not gonna lift you
[1:27:22] up here I'm just gonna
[1:27:24] say man God bless you I I don't know how
[1:27:27] I don't know how you do
[1:27:31] that but somebody had to be anointed to
[1:27:33] do that
[1:27:36] yes really anointed to do
[1:27:40] that so I'm going to take you what is
[1:27:44] our end
[1:27:46] goal are we supposed to go to the book
[1:27:48] of
[1:27:48] Acts what are we supposed to be what is
[1:27:52] our our aim in this
[1:27:55] hour now my pastor's been on this series
[1:27:58] for a little bit so I'm going to just
[1:28:00] hit this hid this way okay because this
[1:28:02] refocused
[1:28:08] me in the book of
[1:28:10] Acts they were all together in one place
[1:28:13] in one Accord then the Holy Ghost came
[1:28:16] down and filled them
[1:28:20] all but what can do were they in at that
[1:28:24] time they were
[1:28:26] new
[1:28:28] born
[1:28:35] babes they were a
[1:28:38] woman they were
[1:28:40] born as a young woman a baby a female
[1:28:44] baby because every church is a type of
[1:28:46] woman they were babes right
[1:28:51] then
[1:28:53] and Jesus Christ is a
[1:28:55] man he's God almighty God he is the
[1:29:00] word he always was the
[1:29:02] word he's
[1:29:06] Eternal and if that kind of a person
[1:29:09] which is Christ the Eternal God who is
[1:29:13] word is coming back looking for a
[1:29:17] wife what kind of woman what kind of a
[1:29:19] girl is she coming back for a baby
[1:29:23] a
[1:29:23] girl or a
[1:29:26] woman he's coming back for a woman not a
[1:29:29] freshly born woman but a
[1:29:35] woman so look at this
[1:29:38] little handmade diagram I made
[1:29:45] here the book of Acts right here
[1:29:48] everything starts right here
[1:29:53] everything this is our this is our this
[1:29:55] is our life this is our life this is our
[1:29:58] history this is our
[1:30:01] genealogy
[1:30:04] yes but after this time the Saints begin
[1:30:08] to grow up and out of this one woman
[1:30:11] that was born this woman
[1:30:14] produced seven other
[1:30:17] women seven other
[1:30:20] churches
[1:30:25] the Church of Rome Corinth galatia
[1:30:28] Ephesus Philippi colasse Colossians and
[1:30:34] Thessalonians seven churches came out of
[1:30:38] that one
[1:30:40] movement you understand
[1:30:46] this I'm gonna read I got some quotes
[1:30:48] here to read for you what is Jesus
[1:30:51] coming back
[1:30:53] for there's eight here what kind of
[1:30:55] woman he's coming back for which one
[1:30:57] does he
[1:31:02] want brother just don't preach it you
[1:31:05] can after I'll let you up
[1:31:07] after thank you brother God bless
[1:31:11] you
[1:31:12] notice now as I said a moment ago the
[1:31:14] false Vine came into the fruti full
[1:31:17] fruition in this age her fruit would be
[1:31:20] would mature and right
[1:31:22] that is correct this evil spirited
[1:31:24] Church full of iniquity will be revealed
[1:31:26] as a mustard seed the gr of the tree
[1:31:28] lodge the fowls of the air and at her
[1:31:30] head will be the Antichrist the mystery
[1:31:32] ini that is true and if this is true
[1:31:33] then it must also be true that the bride
[1:31:36] church WIll
[1:31:38] mature
[1:31:40] amen and her rightness shall be an
[1:31:43] identification with her Lord by means of
[1:31:48] what signs words and miracles anointings
[1:31:55] gifts
[1:31:57] callings
[1:31:58] testimonies why about this Kingdom
[1:32:01] and if God if it was revealed to
[1:32:05] John that North Throne guard that that
[1:32:10] scaffold gate if it was revealed to him
[1:32:13] that Jesus was the
[1:32:17] word and the word wants to be and is
[1:32:19] revealed also that he is the bridegroom
[1:32:23] this word is a bridegroom then the wife
[1:32:25] must be a mature word
[1:32:30] bride if these words abide in you and I
[1:32:34] in them or however ask what you
[1:32:40] will he says and her head will come to
[1:32:42] her in the mystery of godliness which is
[1:32:45] indeed which indeed is
[1:32:48] Christ go to the yellow then as she
[1:32:50] nears her headstone becoming like him
[1:32:52] through
[1:32:53] the word now are miracles in the word
[1:32:57] absolutely our signs and wonder in the
[1:32:59] word are healings the word absolutely
[1:33:00] speaking tongues the word absolutely but
[1:33:01] it's got to be all the word yes
[1:33:05] amen
[1:33:08] now what church what
[1:33:11] church what church did our Malachi 4
[1:33:14] pinpoint was what Christ was coming for
[1:33:18] because if you read the church age book
[1:33:20] he just says get back to Pentecost back
[1:33:22] to Pentecost back to the book of Acts it
[1:33:24] they'll once she realize the blaze
[1:33:26] another Trails the book of Acts but I'll
[1:33:28] say it like
[1:33:35] this it has to be someone who cannot be
[1:33:38] deceived this
[1:33:41] time Eve freshly out of being pulled out
[1:33:44] of Adam for who knows how many years or
[1:33:46] months or weeks the serpent comes boom
[1:33:50] Falls within 20 years of this she
[1:33:55] fell within 20 years of the
[1:33:59] birth of this church these all formed
[1:34:03] and and they all fell they all
[1:34:09] fell so what's he looking for what is
[1:34:12] our goal now on brother side we got
[1:34:14] eight
[1:34:16] choices I got a lot of quotes that say
[1:34:18] here but there's a lot of quotes that
[1:34:19] say somewhere else well
[1:34:26] we know the Corinthian Church Paul
[1:34:28] continually had to tell them one had a
[1:34:31] Psalm one had a tongue he says one had
[1:34:33] this one had that why if Paul believed
[1:34:35] in speaking tongues why he didn't tell
[1:34:36] it to the Ephesians but he didn't tell
[1:34:38] it to the Ephesians he could teach them
[1:34:40] predestinated and great things but these
[1:34:44] babies he had to give them baby food yet
[1:34:46] see he couldn't raise up and tell them
[1:34:48] high
[1:34:50] things
[1:34:52] who reached
[1:34:54] maturity the
[1:34:56] Ephesians reached
[1:35:00] maturity I say like
[1:35:03] this back in when I was in the fourth
[1:35:08] grade I was in the fourth grade my wife
[1:35:11] was
[1:35:13] graduating do you think my wife would
[1:35:15] have visited my elementary walked
[1:35:17] through the elementary aisles and looked
[1:35:19] through there and checked all the
[1:35:19] elementary school like oh I like that
[1:35:21] one right there that little cute
[1:35:24] guy do you think she'd be like the love
[1:35:26] of my life that's that
[1:35:30] kid that boy
[1:35:33] no at least I hope not she had to wait
[1:35:36] for
[1:35:37] me to grow up a little bit more not a
[1:35:39] whole lot but just a little bit more and
[1:35:42] [Music]
[1:35:45] mature it must everything must reach
[1:35:47] reach maturity amen Bible says the
[1:35:50] stature of a fullness
[1:35:52] of
[1:35:55] God Christ is coming
[1:35:58] back for a mature bride that's right but
[1:36:02] these babies he had to give them baby
[1:36:04] food yet see he couldn't raise them up
[1:36:05] and like this if brother Pastor Jesse is
[1:36:08] preaching something too deep go and talk
[1:36:10] to him about it and explain
[1:36:15] it the same God who answers your prayers
[1:36:19] for provision yes for food for finances
[1:36:23] and you pray for those you pray for
[1:36:24] sickness over a young one or a little
[1:36:26] one and God answers that same God can
[1:36:29] give you
[1:36:30] Revelation in fact I think he'd rather
[1:36:33] actually have give you Revelation more
[1:36:35] than anything else outside the Holy
[1:36:39] Ghost so brother Jess's Pastor Jesse is
[1:36:42] preaching too deep just go say Jess can
[1:36:44] can I have a little side study on this
[1:36:45] could you explain this a little more and
[1:36:47] he will I believe that because why a
[1:36:50] pastor is apt to
[1:36:54] teach do you think brother Jesse is a
[1:36:56] teacher or
[1:36:58] not just saying now now notice what he
[1:37:01] says he says and the world is full of
[1:37:03] Corinthian ISM
[1:37:07] today brother Jess what was Pentecost
[1:37:09] Assemblies of God do god
[1:37:11] like boom thank
[1:37:16] you we saw this marriage this guy dating
[1:37:19] I mean it it was unbelievable was going
[1:37:21] on on
[1:37:22] there why spoken tell us I got 35 prayer
[1:37:26] languages look at this Revelation now
[1:37:28] they're coming up with things these
[1:37:29] things called manifest even
[1:37:31] non-christians even say well we're
[1:37:32] speaking it we're we're dwelling on this
[1:37:34] thing that's going to take place and it
[1:37:35] will because they have
[1:37:40] faith God is good to all of them and
[1:37:43] I'll tell you this I did a little
[1:37:45] study back when I got from Thailand and
[1:37:48] the pastor over there mentioned it to me
[1:37:49] just mentioned it
[1:37:51] and if you look when God was making a
[1:37:53] covenant with
[1:37:55] Abraham he told Abraham go get a she
[1:37:58] goat go get a hepher right he says and
[1:38:02] go get a ram he says and slay those th
[1:38:06] things he says for thy
[1:38:09] seed so out of Abraham is going to come
[1:38:13] three kinds of
[1:38:14] people because those sacrifices have to
[1:38:17] cover for them was Ishmael seed of God
[1:38:20] or not
[1:38:21] but he was still blessed because he was
[1:38:23] under one of those
[1:38:25] sacrifices then you see what he says
[1:38:27] after that and then then he jumps back
[1:38:30] then to and look what the sacrifice was
[1:38:32] for
[1:38:34] Isaac Abraham's got the knife and he's
[1:38:37] going to slay Isaac he turns God says
[1:38:39] don't do it Abraham's
[1:38:41] like and he turns and sees a sheo nope
[1:38:45] not that sacrifice did he turn see a
[1:38:48] heer nope that's not what he saw he saw
[1:38:50] a
[1:38:52] Ram so Isaac's sacrifice will only be
[1:38:57] under a ram amen now notice the world is
[1:39:00] full of Corinthian ISM today sure they
[1:39:03] show you this Lord I've never blah blah
[1:39:05] right ties it with with Thomas now let's
[1:39:07] continue on here we got I'm at hour five
[1:39:09] give me a little bit here I'm I'm going
[1:39:10] to run I'm I'm start running here by
[1:39:12] God's grace he says now notice what he
[1:39:14] ties right here to the
[1:39:16] Ephesians this will be an Ephesian
[1:39:18] Church which goes right back to what
[1:39:20] John John 15
[1:39:23] and6 because remember brother Ram said
[1:39:25] he says he says Joshua and Ephesus
[1:39:28] parallel each other that's right they're
[1:39:31] just like each other the prophet is off
[1:39:34] the scene Moses went off the scene then
[1:39:36] God comes to Joshua says you're the guy
[1:39:39] as I was with Moses so shall I be with
[1:39:41] you amen that's right he said that was
[1:39:45] the
[1:39:49] Ephesians so as we
[1:39:51] mature this is our goal brother said the
[1:39:54] only he says only look what he says here
[1:39:57] he said the sun was going down if them
[1:39:58] Kings had a great uh to get their their
[1:40:01] self together again the next day he
[1:40:03] would surely lose men but Joshua knew he
[1:40:05] needed sunlight and he looked to the Sun
[1:40:07] and said stand thou still th over gibian
[1:40:09] the moon over aelon for the space of a
[1:40:12] whole day about a day the Bible says
[1:40:14] that all all that night the sun sit
[1:40:15] still the moon Stood Still that's a
[1:40:16] paradox a man walking in the will of God
[1:40:18] will do such a thing for he was a again
[1:40:21] an in an Ephesus in an Ephesian with the
[1:40:30] gospel let me like this the prophet of
[1:40:33] God came and had a Revival we had a
[1:40:35] Revival for what he said 20
[1:40:37] years how many
[1:40:42] churches have formed
[1:40:45] now and what will the maturity of each
[1:40:47] one be
[1:40:49] like see this is all it's the individual
[1:40:52] Affair well they're doing this and ites
[1:40:54] it doesn't matter are you going to be
[1:40:55] the Ephesians am I going to be the
[1:40:58] Ephesians yes am study the Ephesians out
[1:41:02] they're the only ones that the full
[1:41:04] five-fold ministry was revealed
[1:41:08] to they're the only ones who understood
[1:41:12] how this
[1:41:13] works yes and had a revelation why
[1:41:16] because this was a deeper
[1:41:19] thing
[1:41:26] amen Acts 19 Acts 20 the Ephesians were
[1:41:30] the only one that was
[1:41:34] preached the nickan
[1:41:36] spirit Grievous wolves that's
[1:41:41] nickolus Ephesians was so the wife
[1:41:44] chosen wife of God she was so the mature
[1:41:48] one one that he picked that church
[1:41:51] to be the first church age
[1:41:53] representation in that acts Revelations
[1:41:56] 2 and
[1:41:57] three because remember what went down
[1:42:00] what he used as example to go down in
[1:42:02] death would have to be
[1:42:06] resurrected so study that first church
[1:42:08] age within that is our way
[1:42:13] back they hated the Deeds of
[1:42:17] neans I'm talking about Ephesians I'm
[1:42:19] talking about a mature wife
[1:42:23] if the word could discern the enemy so
[1:42:25] can the
[1:42:26] wife that's
[1:42:28] right if the husband can do great things
[1:42:31] of God if the husband can create all
[1:42:34] things the wife can also control
[1:42:38] it but what she has to reach maturity
[1:42:40] which will come to a humble Meek
[1:42:44] group right yes nothing great about them
[1:42:49] and they will know they are nothing
[1:42:50] nothing but they have something in them
[1:42:53] the Holy
[1:42:55] Spirit now there have been hundreds of
[1:42:57] men many men raised up he said been only
[1:42:58] been for hundreds and hundreds of years
[1:43:00] they had no Prophet oh they had priests
[1:43:02] and great men and we read the history
[1:43:04] down between the time of Malachi and
[1:43:06] Matthew 400 years they had great men but
[1:43:08] there was no prophet and then when he
[1:43:10] come on the scene to prove that he was
[1:43:12] that Ephesians made
[1:43:15] manifest Jesus was an
[1:43:18] Ephesian because what was the whole
[1:43:20] point to produce oh to produce the book
[1:43:22] of Acts no the whole produ the whole
[1:43:24] product was supposed to be
[1:43:26] Ephesian he birthed them there to bring
[1:43:29] forth a
[1:43:32] wife in fact he sent his first age
[1:43:36] Prophet
[1:43:37] messenger there for three
[1:43:40] years because he said what for three
[1:43:42] years I worn the with sighing and crying
[1:43:44] in tears telling you these things were
[1:43:47] coming he literally brought forth his
[1:43:50] first Church age and sat them right
[1:43:52] there the Ephesians to raise them up
[1:43:54] into the correct
[1:43:56] understanding
[1:43:59] yes we better be in these quotes we
[1:44:01] better be in these sermons
[1:44:03] listening find Co to coming toing
[1:44:06] toothing these things right just finding
[1:44:07] all the Nuggets everything we can
[1:44:09] find because this is what we want to be
[1:44:13] right but according to promise uh
[1:44:16] according to Revelation 10 Malachi 4
[1:44:18] Luke 24 22 says there is promised it
[1:44:21] friends there must come in Ephesians
[1:44:23] that these Sevenfold Mysteries of the
[1:44:26] word of God must be unfolded and it's in
[1:44:29] the leoson church this takes place I
[1:44:31] believe we're we're there so notice
[1:44:34] who's the only one that's going to catch
[1:44:35] these
[1:44:36] Thunders the
[1:44:39] Ephesians if you look at that they they
[1:44:42] think oh it's the Seven Seals no because
[1:44:44] here at 65 it's the seven Thunders going
[1:44:47] forth he said he'll take an Ephesians to
[1:44:49] catch that
[1:44:53] see that's why we have to
[1:44:55] mature take every quote every everything
[1:44:57] we can find every scripture bring
[1:45:00] everything back to the Bible every quote
[1:45:03] must be taken back to
[1:45:08] this this right
[1:45:12] here I say take the quotes back through
[1:45:14] the throne
[1:45:16] guards see if they line up with Peter
[1:45:18] James and John amen the true bride will
[1:45:22] be able to place these things and hit it
[1:45:24] just exactly because what it had to
[1:45:27] be amen he says predicted here in the
[1:45:30] scripture that I think that we're living
[1:45:32] in the Ephesians again back back to the
[1:45:34] promise that we left off during those
[1:45:35] seven Church ages now I got a little bit
[1:45:40] left here hopefully we can go through
[1:45:41] this real quick I'm not trying I'm we
[1:45:43] only got one service brother Jos you
[1:45:45] going to take a nap I'm going to take
[1:45:46] nap too by God's grace absolutely so
[1:45:48] we're going to get some rest after this
[1:45:49] just this just look at this a little B
[1:45:51] longer right
[1:45:54] amen now
[1:45:56] notice there is promised it friends
[1:45:59] there must come in Ephesians that these
[1:46:00] Sevenfold Mysteries of the word of God
[1:46:02] must be
[1:46:04] unfolded so I'm GNA I'm going to show
[1:46:07] you the quote that everybody leans on
[1:46:08] literally the only quote everyone leans
[1:46:10] on it's in the church age
[1:46:14] book now this messenger of Malachi 4
[1:46:17] Revelation 107 is going to do two things
[1:46:18] one according to Malachi 4 he will will
[1:46:20] turn the hearts of the children to the
[1:46:22] fathers
[1:46:24] two he will reveal the mysteries of the
[1:46:26] seven thunders in Revelations 10 which
[1:46:29] are the revelations contained in these
[1:46:31] Seven
[1:46:32] Seals did Brother Braham teach the seven
[1:46:35] Thunders what sermon was it what quotes
[1:46:37] were they what are they he did not teach
[1:46:40] it in a revealed
[1:46:46] way and everybody leans on this now
[1:46:48] notice he revealed the seven Mysteries
[1:46:50] of the seven thunders in Revelation
[1:46:52] which are the Revelation contained in
[1:46:54] the Seven Seals are the seven thunders
[1:46:56] in the seventh seal yes they're in the
[1:46:57] seventh seal so they're in the Seven
[1:46:59] Seals but it's the seven seal itself
[1:47:02] because brother bam said what he says in
[1:47:03] the seven sealed sermon he said he said
[1:47:06] this morning he says revealed the Seven
[1:47:08] Seals in a three-fold manner he said and
[1:47:10] to best of my understanding I'm going to
[1:47:12] reveal that first fold he said that
[1:47:13] first fold of the seventh seal was the
[1:47:16] seven
[1:47:18] Thunders got all the quotes
[1:47:22] now notice now notice what now notice he
[1:47:24] ties look what he says here and then
[1:47:26] notice what he says here and you're
[1:47:27] going to see he ties it right to the
[1:47:29] Ephesians we find out then when he gets
[1:47:31] killed with the sword to the sword of
[1:47:33] the word God's sword sharp word sharp
[1:47:36] two edged sword slays them puts them
[1:47:37] right down there wait till them seven
[1:47:39] Thunders he says are uttered utter their
[1:47:42] voices to the group to that group who's
[1:47:44] that group The Ephesians who can really
[1:47:47] take the word of God in hand in there
[1:47:49] it'll slice and cut
[1:47:50] they can close the
[1:47:52] heavens notice they're controlling goes
[1:47:55] right back to Joshua controlling nature
[1:47:58] itself back to Adam State Back to Eden
[1:48:00] back to the
[1:48:01] Ephesians he says though close whatever
[1:48:04] they they close the heavens they can
[1:48:05] shut it or do with this whatever they
[1:48:06] want to do Glory he'll be slayed by the
[1:48:10] word and proceeds out of his mouth is
[1:48:11] sharper than twoed sword he they would
[1:48:13] call him 100 billion tons of flies if
[1:48:14] they wanted to amen whatever they say
[1:48:17] it's going to happen because it's the
[1:48:19] word of God coming from the mouth of
[1:48:23] God if the word husband has a wife it'll
[1:48:26] be a word wife and at that time she'll
[1:48:28] receive these things and produce just
[1:48:30] like Joshua
[1:48:33] did
[1:48:36] now when hit these and these are just
[1:48:38] some I'm just sharing just a couple
[1:48:40] whosoever should take one word from the
[1:48:42] Bible or add one word to this his part
[1:48:44] will be taken the Book of Life what is
[1:48:46] it the Revelation all it's been given
[1:48:47] Miss back there to bring it's already
[1:48:52] wrote It's not written in the Book of
[1:48:55] Revelation of Jesus Christ but it's
[1:48:58] written in here he
[1:48:59] says he says it's in here it's revealed
[1:49:03] it's to reveal what's already been
[1:49:05] written see because you can't add one
[1:49:08] thing to or take one word from
[1:49:11] it these last seven Thunders will be
[1:49:13] written right in the scripture now I'm
[1:49:16] going to show you some quotes
[1:49:18] here he says and he said there will be
[1:49:20] hideous sights upon the Earth Locust
[1:49:22] with hair like women long hair to taunt
[1:49:24] them women to cut their hair teeth like
[1:49:26] lions stingers and Tails like scorpions
[1:49:28] they would torment men months just wait
[1:49:30] till we get to when's this August 65
[1:49:34] he's only got four more months till the
[1:49:37] Lord takes them home just wait till we
[1:49:40] get the opening and plagues and seals
[1:49:42] and them seven Thunders watch what takes
[1:49:45] place oh brother you better get to Goan
[1:49:46] while there's still time to get to Goan
[1:49:48] don't pay attention to this outside and
[1:49:50] if there's a time to listen don't pay
[1:49:52] attention to what's going on outside
[1:49:55] Wars Insanity everything's crazy it is
[1:49:59] gone focus on Jesus Christ the
[1:50:03] Ephesian
[1:50:05] amen now notice here's that here's that
[1:50:07] quote he says now now do you notice on
[1:50:09] the opening of the seventh seal it's in
[1:50:11] a three-fold mystery this one I will
[1:50:13] have speak on I spoke that is the
[1:50:15] mystery of the seven Thunders the seven
[1:50:18] Thunders heaven will unfold this mystery
[1:50:19] it will right at the coming when's it
[1:50:22] coming back then with brother Ram he
[1:50:25] said no he says it'll be coming now
[1:50:26] brother Ram thought it was the coming of
[1:50:27] the Lord listen to his sermons right at
[1:50:30] the end of 62 and 63 and he was he said
[1:50:33] this is could this be
[1:50:36] it is this the cut is everything cut off
[1:50:38] has the lamb went and took the book and
[1:50:40] now there's no more
[1:50:42] salvation he thought it was right then
[1:50:45] the sth under heaven will unfold this
[1:50:47] mystery it' be right at the coming of
[1:50:48] Christ because Christ said no no one
[1:50:50] knew when he would return so then he
[1:50:52] identifies when the Thunders were
[1:50:53] uttered it's coming soon these seven
[1:50:56] Revelations are coming and they'll be
[1:50:58] written right in the word of God
[1:51:02] notice he said now notice this is the
[1:51:04] one I found uh Lord showed me about six
[1:51:07] months ago and I was not allowed to have
[1:51:11] the auditorium and finally they gave
[1:51:13] they kind of gave us permission we could
[1:51:15] have one service but we could not pray
[1:51:17] for any sick I don't that's my Ministry
[1:51:20] I have to tell to do what the Holy
[1:51:21] Spirit tells me to do so I refused it
[1:51:24] because uh that I want to be at Liberty
[1:51:26] to do whatever the holy spirit says to
[1:51:27] do now see uh so I thought we could just
[1:51:30] suffer one more day anyhow in the
[1:51:32] Tabernacle and it's cool this morning
[1:51:33] Lord willing but what was his point what
[1:51:35] was what do he want to do at this
[1:51:37] meeting he says in doing this I have
[1:51:39] come here for the purpose of teaching
[1:51:41] the last vials the last the last seven
[1:51:44] th the veil vials and the last seven
[1:51:48] trumpets and the last last seven
[1:51:50] thunders of the Book of Revelation tying
[1:51:52] them together in this hour that we're
[1:51:54] living now to follow the opening of The
[1:51:56] Seven Seals in the seven Church ages but
[1:51:58] we couldn't get room to do it so God
[1:52:00] shut it
[1:52:02] down notice he was going to do it right
[1:52:05] then this morning he's going to reveal
[1:52:07] what they were but God shut it
[1:52:11] down so we should get room to do it so I
[1:52:14] hope soon as I can I we can get to a
[1:52:16] place sufficient for that so notice he
[1:52:19] wanted to teach it he wanted to preach
[1:52:21] it but God said hold
[1:52:32] back yeah I think we already read that
[1:52:34] one
[1:52:35] now look here 8:22 that same month look
[1:52:39] what brother Ram says he says I believe
[1:52:42] we got one of the most Dreadful times to
[1:52:43] go through and I believe we that same
[1:52:44] thing we got a drel time to go through
[1:52:47] that ever laid before human beings and
[1:52:49] I'm waiting for the hour that we can get
[1:52:51] to everybody together a chance where we
[1:52:53] can get off from work and spend a few
[1:52:55] days and we can get some set up
[1:52:56] somewhere where I can speak on those
[1:52:57] plagues and things to fall in the last
[1:52:59] days to throw about two or three weeks
[1:53:01] together and bring that together if the
[1:53:03] Lord lets me live to do it and will
[1:53:06] inspire me to do it see how those things
[1:53:09] will drop in and those
[1:53:12] Thunders see he never preached it then
[1:53:15] you'll find out what that man them
[1:53:16] people and see dreaming and all those S
[1:53:18] they come to pass you'll notice what
[1:53:20] them re revealed them great Thunder to
[1:53:22] come forth was out of the Skies now so
[1:53:24] forth you whole bunch of you he says you
[1:53:26] know that I know what that means what
[1:53:29] that means you see so he says he says I
[1:53:31] know what they are he say I know what
[1:53:34] they are he that's how he could preach
[1:53:35] him that's why he wanted to preach him
[1:53:36] because it was revealed to him that
[1:53:37] first fold of the seven seal he says I
[1:53:39] know what they
[1:53:41] are he says but let's just wait until
[1:53:43] the time comes you see for it to be see
[1:53:46] so and it'll be more in season and we
[1:53:48] waited 60 years
[1:53:51] the prophets pulled off the scene and I
[1:53:53] really think the Lord took the prophet
[1:53:54] off the scene because he was going to
[1:53:54] preach these before the coming of the
[1:53:57] Lord and what the what what what was
[1:53:59] what was revealed in the seventh seal he
[1:54:01] said if these things were revealed if
[1:54:02] God would not told John to seal these
[1:54:04] things up he said great damage would
[1:54:06] have been done by the
[1:54:08] devil now I'm going to shift here real
[1:54:12] quick in closing here one we're an hour
[1:54:15] and
[1:54:18] 20
[1:54:20] seven Thunders will come at the end of
[1:54:23] the age right before it's coming they'll
[1:54:24] they they'll show so don't worry about
[1:54:26] that it's
[1:54:28] coming but now notice here this is one
[1:54:29] of the scriptures I start off let us be
[1:54:31] glad and rejoice and give honor unto him
[1:54:32] for the marriage of the supper of the
[1:54:34] marriage of the Lamb is come and his
[1:54:36] wife hath made herself
[1:54:39] ready so how do we become now notice his
[1:54:43] wife that's an Ephesian wife hath made
[1:54:46] herself ready What did the what did the
[1:54:48] Ephesians have to
[1:54:50] hear what
[1:54:52] notice and his wife hath made herself
[1:54:56] ready how did she know to make herself
[1:54:58] ready and how did she make herself
[1:55:02] ready and as I read this I said why was
[1:55:06] this injected in Revelations 19 and not
[1:55:09] Revelations 3 or Revelations 4 this
[1:55:12] should have been in the church age book
[1:55:13] I'm sorry yeah in in Revelation 3 right
[1:55:15] at the end of L was in church age but
[1:55:17] it's not contained there why because
[1:55:19] remember this what John the the
[1:55:21] revelation of Jesus Christ is a
[1:55:24] vision and the angel the eagle was sent
[1:55:28] to hand walk John through this
[1:55:31] Revelation and the angels with John let
[1:55:35] me show you this let me show you this
[1:55:37] let me show you this John's like looking
[1:55:39] at all of it and as he as he would go
[1:55:42] through the passage of time the seven
[1:55:45] Church ages and then that last amount of
[1:55:48] time there from Revelations 4 all the
[1:55:50] way to 22 all the way into eternity from
[1:55:53] that John's looking at all of it but
[1:55:55] he's going through it
[1:55:57] chronologically and then the spirit
[1:55:59] would say something or Jesus would say
[1:56:01] something or the angel would say
[1:56:04] something but notice directly here the
[1:56:07] angel or I like this uh I think there's
[1:56:10] a voice from
[1:56:12] Heaven says that the bride has made
[1:56:14] herself
[1:56:16] ready but what did she hear
[1:56:20] what did she hear and what was
[1:56:24] her what was her Mission what did she
[1:56:26] have to do how does how does the wife
[1:56:27] make herself ready
[1:56:30] here let this be known scripture does
[1:56:32] not play with words whatever is in the
[1:56:35] record is there for the anointed eyes to
[1:56:38] see it is there for a
[1:56:40] purpose why was this
[1:56:43] contained in Revelations 19 why did it
[1:56:45] strike right there because directly
[1:56:48] after this we we see they John sees
[1:56:51] after he sees the wife ready he actually
[1:56:53] sees then Christ on the White Horse with
[1:56:55] his sword and the name on his thigh and
[1:56:57] all those sort of things and the armies
[1:56:59] of Heaven follow him down to take over
[1:57:01] to start the Millennium Reign but that's
[1:57:05] after the wife had already went
[1:57:08] up but he's seeing this but right before
[1:57:10] he sees the coming down of Christ and
[1:57:12] the bride to take over for the mum rain
[1:57:14] before he sees that he's told the wife's
[1:57:16] made her ready made yourself ready maybe
[1:57:20] the Lord allowed him to see that
[1:57:22] to have something to get ready
[1:57:30] for let me tell you what the Lord showed
[1:57:32] me right
[1:57:34] here what why how did she know to make
[1:57:36] herself ready and what did she make
[1:57:37] herself ready with and
[1:57:39] why in Revelations 18 and after these
[1:57:43] things I saw another Angel come down
[1:57:45] from heaven having great power and the
[1:57:47] Earth was lightened with his glory and
[1:57:49] he cried mighy with a strong voice
[1:57:51] saying Babylon the greatest Fallen as
[1:57:52] Fallen has become the habitation of
[1:57:54] devils and the hold of every foul Spirit
[1:57:55] and the cage of every unclean hateful
[1:57:57] bird for all nations have drunk of the
[1:57:59] wine of Wrath of fornication and the
[1:58:00] kings of the Earth have committed
[1:58:01] fornication with her and the merchants
[1:58:02] of the Earth are waxed Rich the
[1:58:04] merchants of the Earth have waxed Rich
[1:58:07] what's this
[1:58:08] inflation they're just waxing richer and
[1:58:11] richer you know as well as I do that
[1:58:13] stuff doesn't cost
[1:58:15] anymore no it doesn't it doesn't go to
[1:58:18] Home Depot I grabb like a little bag of
[1:58:20] fittings 100 bucks just for a just a few
[1:58:24] things why is it that expensive because
[1:58:26] the merchants of the Earth have raised
[1:58:29] the prices they call it inflation but
[1:58:31] the truth is they want more
[1:58:35] money and that's something we just do we
[1:58:38] suffer now notice what it says and I
[1:58:40] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[1:58:42] come out of her my people that you be
[1:58:45] not partakers of her sins that he
[1:58:47] receive not of her plagues there it is
[1:58:50] how does she make herself ready come out
[1:58:53] of her my people that's her and her
[1:58:57] daughters and anything false that false
[1:59:00] blueprint come out of anything like that
[1:59:03] because we have the real blueprint amen
[1:59:06] and we have a protection around it but
[1:59:08] saints of God how does she make us
[1:59:09] already come out of anything that looks
[1:59:11] like organization any false Doctrine
[1:59:13] take out come out of
[1:59:15] anything that doesn't line up with the
[1:59:17] word of God that's how because it' be a
[1:59:19] word bride so for her to be a word bride
[1:59:23] she's got to have nothing hybrid
[1:59:26] organizational anything attached to
[1:59:30] her Harvest Time yes Harvest Time the
[1:59:33] two vines that grew together were
[1:59:34] entwined the branches but are now to be
[1:59:36] separated the fruits of those Vines
[1:59:38] which were at such variance will be
[1:59:40] gathered into separate gardeners thank
[1:59:41] God the two spirits will go their
[1:59:43] separate destinations now it is time to
[1:59:46] heed the final call that comes only to
[1:59:49] to the wheat bride
[1:59:52] amen
[1:59:54] only the bride is able to understand
[1:59:57] this that's right only the
[1:59:59] Ephesian bride the Ephesian church will
[2:00:02] be able to understand this scripture
[2:00:04] what to come out of
[2:00:11] yes thank God for eyes to see and ears
[2:00:15] to
[2:00:17] hear anything the world churches are
[2:00:20] doing get away from
[2:00:22] it anything old Catholic uh Lodge does
[2:00:26] don't do it anything the assembly God do
[2:00:27] don't do anything go right on Down the
[2:00:30] Line have you noticed they just showed
[2:00:33] the Pope in the wheelchair
[2:00:34] now he's about ready to
[2:00:37] go he's getting older he can't walk he's
[2:00:39] in a wheelchair now just okayed
[2:00:43] homosexuality literally just okay that
[2:00:46] it's good to
[2:00:47] go where are we at
[2:00:49] could this next Pope be the one could be
[2:00:51] the could be this well let's just take
[2:00:53] that quote when that Pope comes out of
[2:00:55] America will it be an American Pope I
[2:00:56] don't know I don't know we don't know
[2:00:58] but it's going to be one of these popes
[2:00:59] one of these
[2:01:01] days come out of her
[2:01:03] my now take High take now is time to
[2:01:06] take heed to the final call that comes
[2:01:08] only to the wheat bride my I love that
[2:01:12] come out of her my people that be not
[2:01:14] partakers of her sins and that ye wheat
[2:01:18] receive not her tear plagues the Great
[2:01:21] Tribulation of six seal Revelations
[2:01:22] Matthew
[2:01:24] 24 if you're a wheat bride you will hear
[2:01:28] the wheat
[2:01:32] call and you know it's amazing in the m
[2:01:34] in the English language that wheat and
[2:01:36] weeds or weed and wheat sound so much
[2:01:40] alike it's ordain that's
[2:01:42] ordained right so saints of
[2:01:46] God this is our goal right here
[2:01:49] raising up full maturity in the word of
[2:01:52] God aim this is our AIM now but we've
[2:01:56] got to have this make sure we're
[2:01:58] baptized sealed the Holy Ghost and he
[2:02:00] will mature
[2:02:02] you now notice what he's doing before
[2:02:04] notice what he's doing this
[2:02:05] time before the disciples were
[2:02:10] mature before they mature he gave them
[2:02:12] the
[2:02:14] power and they
[2:02:17] fell before Adam and Eve were
[2:02:21] mature he gave them
[2:02:24] power and they
[2:02:26] fell but this time he gives us the holy
[2:02:30] ghost first so that we can
[2:02:34] mature and then when the power
[2:02:39] Falls there'll be no turning back
[2:02:42] there'll be nothing to stop her if if
[2:02:45] the Rapture wouldn't take place she
[2:02:46] would take over yes yes because if she's
[2:02:50] at the point where she can control
[2:02:52] everything wind rain fire everything he
[2:02:55] if she can control it all she'll take
[2:02:58] over but God said no I will not punish
[2:03:02] the righteous or the holy with the
[2:03:04] wicked it's not time to take over yet
[2:03:07] girl my love he says we're GNA I'm going
[2:03:10] to go and feed you a little bit gain
[2:03:11] your strength give you a little
[2:03:14] rest and then at time we're going to go
[2:03:16] back and then we'll take over

[2:03:25] believe your bride you believe you're
[2:03:26] the Ephesians
[2:03:27] absolutely am yes man my pastor started
[2:03:31] teaching this like in I think it was the
[2:03:33] end of November or
[2:03:35] however and it took me my entire Focus
[2:03:38] for 20 plus years been the book of Acts
[2:03:40] the book of Acts book of
[2:03:41] Acts no it's a mature wife it's a mature
[2:03:46] Church brother said he's all n Street
[2:03:48] spiritual gifts everything will be
[2:03:50] operating
[2:03:52] perfectly I am shooting for that I can
[2:03:54] go a little further but we'll call it's
[2:03:55] been an hour and a half let's just stand
[2:03:57] here by God's
[2:03:58] grace every we fine amen all well
[2:04:02] understand
[2:04:04] yes remember Ephesians what aimed at and
[2:04:09] relaxed the only thing the only we need
[2:04:11] to be relaxed in is in putting our trust
[2:04:13] in Christ yes relaxing in his Spirit
[2:04:17] refreshing in his spirit
[2:04:19] trusting in Him but we've got to get
[2:04:21] aimed at and bring him fully back to our
[2:04:24] first love amen amen all is well he my
[2:04:28] musicians mici not magicians musicians
[2:04:31] could you come play Here by God's
[2:04:34] grace sometimes when they play it's like
[2:04:37] it's pretty phenomenal to me I don't
[2:04:39] know I couldn't figure it
[2:04:41] out uh so anyhow we trust all is well
[2:04:45] this one has been on my heart I've been
[2:04:47] wanting to teach it an off shoot of what
[2:04:49] my pastor been preaching there because
[2:04:51] it really gave me a new
[2:04:54] vision of what Christ
[2:04:57] expecting what he's looking for when he
[2:04:59] comes maybe brother Pastor Jesse already
[2:05:01] preaches I don't know but I this was
[2:05:03] something on my heart so may God bless
[2:05:07] you keep you if you need anything you
[2:05:09] need prayer or anything we'll come pray
[2:05:11] for you you can you can claim it right
[2:05:12] at your seat however put oil or however
[2:05:14] you want to do it um but we're trusting
[2:05:17] in the Lord Jesus Christ everybody bless
[2:05:18] this morning amen everybody have their
[2:05:21] their sight set their new focus in their
[2:05:23] hearts Lord God this is what I want to
[2:05:25] be right there now now you can say
[2:05:27] specifically in your prayer say Lord I'm
[2:05:29] an Ephesian I am you can literally speak
[2:05:31] it out of your mouth say I am an
[2:05:32] Ephesian because brother Ram said he
[2:05:33] said he said your body will have to obey
[2:05:36] you will it will obey what comes out of
[2:05:37] your mouth if you think you're a weak
[2:05:40] Christian say man I'm just not good
[2:05:41] today then then the things you spoke
[2:05:43] will take place in that day you will not
[2:05:46] be good that day if you speak it out but
[2:05:48] if you say Lord God God I am your wife
[2:05:50] he says I'm your bride Lord God mature
[2:05:52] me bring me to what you want me to be
[2:05:54] what what what you me to look like in
[2:05:55] the spiritual realm right amen so now we
[2:05:57] can pray that and aim our prayers
[2:06:00] towards that and God will take care of
[2:06:01] the rest amen amen so let's see let's uh
[2:06:05] uh let's just say a word of prayer here
[2:06:08] if there's anything you desire as we
[2:06:11] spoke here about the Ephesians that's
[2:06:13] our that's our that's one of our desires
[2:06:15] I know that but if you had need of
[2:06:17] anything

[2:13:22] believe that's Vindication there by
[2:13:23] God's grace brother thank God for your
[2:13:26] the leadership of the Lord with
[2:13:28] you amen that's that was the song I was

[2:13:36] she smiled I go I'm

[2:13:51] me the wife the bride you want me to be
[2:13:53] Lord
[2:13:55] God you know how he trains you in the
[2:13:58] Physical
[2:13:59] Realm he trains You by all the people
[2:14:02] around you I just been telling to my
[2:14:04] apprentices lately they're like
[2:14:05] complaining about this Foreman or this
[2:14:07] project manager I said guys the entire
[2:14:10] battle here in your job is just pretty
[2:14:13] much
[2:14:14] personalities Works work but the hard
[2:14:17] balance
[2:14:18] is dealing with personalities and
[2:14:22] attitudes been done wrong here been done
[2:14:25] wrong here The Works work you can't
[2:14:27] complain about it is what it is you got
[2:14:28] to work hard it looks impossible yeah
[2:14:30] we're going to get done but when you
[2:14:32] know what they they don't complain about
[2:14:33] most of the time the work it's the
[2:14:34] personalities of the people wear them
[2:14:38] out the nagging the pinpointing the this
[2:14:41] the that the
[2:14:43] however and saints of God when these
[2:14:45] heathens rise up and start persecuting a
[2:14:48] saying things the things we got to go
[2:14:50] through we're almost home the Bible says
[2:14:53] to rejoice in your
[2:14:55] sufferings because what who suffered
[2:14:57] like
[2:14:58] Christ the Bible said he was marred be
[2:15:01] they marred his visual Beyond any other
[2:15:04] man he suffered like no other man
[2:15:06] whatever they did to him on that day was
[2:15:09] beyond what any human had ever suffered
[2:15:12] right literally beat him to one inch of
[2:15:17] his life
[2:15:18] and then hang hung him on a
[2:15:24] cross we don't even we couldn't imagine
[2:15:26] what he looked like his the the word
[2:15:29] body looked like he was destroyed much
[2:15:32] as the world churches or lodges have
[2:15:34] destroyed this
[2:15:37] word so the things we have to go through
[2:15:39] are light suffering rejoice in them
[2:15:42] because our savior our King our husband
[2:15:45] went before us and suffered Beyond
[2:15:49] we could even imagine remember those two
[2:15:51] thieves on the
[2:15:52] cross I don't recall any Scripture
[2:15:54] saying they got beaten or whipped or
[2:15:56] anything they were just taken and hung
[2:15:58] on a cross and they were worthy of it
[2:16:02] but here was their savior or one savior
[2:16:07] who took all the blunt of the hand of
[2:16:09] the wrath of God upon
[2:16:13] him and it's amazing God would choose
[2:16:16] the Roman
[2:16:19] entity to punish our
[2:16:22] Christ and here at the end God will take
[2:16:25] the Russian entity to punish
[2:16:28] Rome amen let's just love
[2:16:31] him if you have something on your heart
[2:16:33] he can he will hear you just tell him
[2:16:36] amen thank you for singing that song
[2:16:37] brother God bless you let's sing another
[2:16:40] one

[2:20:34] like my mind just blew and I'm like I've
[2:20:37] never heard that in 23 years of my life
[2:20:40] and I sat in church for 18 years never
[2:20:43] knew that we were a spirit before and
[2:20:46] then sent down into these bodies to
[2:20:48] suffer and to taste a fallen state only
[2:20:52] to be re restored and redeemed yes
[2:20:56] hallelujah amen oh that's a Beau I love
[2:20:58] that song that's good pastor Jesse come
[2:21:00] on
[2:21:01] up amen
