[30:00] let's go to Ephesians chapter six I
[30:02] liked it
[30:03] Lord willing maybe finish this book
[30:04] today nice conclusion chapter 6 verse 1
[30:18] then tonight you know for the 4 p.m.
[30:20] service by God's grace will be preaching
[30:23] from my house and they will look at
[30:25] Bible covenants again thank you I think
[30:28] we're on the Davidic covenant or David
[30:31] covenant and then the new covenant
[30:35] that's the New Testament covenant the
[30:37] last one is the eternal covenant praise
[30:39] God
[30:40] Oh church this you know as I study these
[30:43] things at such a confirmation like God
[30:45] will never break his covenant we just we
[30:47] have to remember one thing we just have
[30:49] to respect God's covenant in other words
[30:51] respect his promises obey his promises
[30:54] and then he of course he'll keep his end
[30:56] of the the covenant by God's grace it's
[30:58] so beautiful so wonderful to see that
[31:01] God's covenants never fail think about
[31:04] that even the rainbow covenant is still
[31:06] in effect today God says I will not use
[31:09] water to destroy it and he gives us all
[31:11] these signs all these promises but now
[31:14] the promise is the baptism of the holy
[31:17] in the soul of the believer praise God
[31:19] so we can't really look out I mean we
[31:21] thank God for the rainbow but the the
[31:23] token now is in our souls praise God
[31:26] it's he wanted the token so close it was
[31:28] in our souls everyday thank you did that
[31:29] help okay okay so they just got to
[31:35] fiddle with some of the sounds back
[31:37] there thank you yeah we ever do the live
[31:41] stream because I'm always preaching you

[32:24] 2 praise the Lord that's
[32:36] this is what God is doing during this
[32:38] time he's renewing our minds we all face
[32:41] this virus right but we take one day at
[32:43] a time but we're not taking the same
[32:44] view as the world they take a totally
[32:46] different view to this o man's gotta
[32:48] solve it man the only way it's gonna be
[32:50] solved is by God's grace God will use
[32:53] men of course God will use women but we
[32:56] take totally different attitudes because
[32:57] our minds are renewed and we do the
[33:00] perfect will of God
[33:02] first 1 & 2 so let's read it and then
[33:05] ask the Lord to write upon our hearts
[33:07] Romans 12:1 and 2 1 2 3 I beseech you
[33:12] therefore brethren by the mercies of God
[33:15] that ye present your bodies a living
[33:17] sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which
[33:21] is your reasonable service and be not
[33:25] conformed to this world but be
[33:27] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[33:30] that ye may prove what is that good and
[33:33] acceptable and perfect will of God let's
[33:36] have one more word of Prayer let's ask
[33:38] the Lord to minister here to every need

[33:52] covenant Lord you made a promise and
[33:54] there's no one you could swear by so you
[33:56] swore by yourself as you live your word
[34:00] will remain true as you live your
[34:02] promises will come to pass we thank you
[34:04] Lord that you're the greatest one Lord

[34:20] times with your light for your word is a
[34:23] lamp unto our feet and a light unto our
[34:26] path granite Lord God help us today may
[34:29] we feel your presence more and more Lord
[34:30] speak to us direct us by your Holy
[34:32] Spirit in Jesus Christ's name
[34:35] everybody said Amen god bless you didn't
[34:37] see the praise gun so I just have a few
[34:43] slides there Lydia if you'd like to
[34:44] switch over
[34:46] by God's grace will try to finish this
[34:47] chapter Lord willing today so we thank
[34:55] the Lord for His grace be really nice to
[34:59] finish this thought here we'll see how
[35:01] the Lord works it out if I could I don't
[35:06] have the quotes in front of me but let
[35:08] me read them real quick last week you
[35:10] may remember I I mentioned a social
[35:14] media post that everybody was sharing
[35:16] about germ warfare so there's only two
[35:19] quotes on germ warfare I want to read
[35:21] them both to you so you understand
[35:24] because some people and I saw a lot of
[35:26] message people sharing the germ warfare
[35:28] quotes but if you read them carefully
[35:30] they all refer to the Tribulation Period
[35:34] okay so let me read it this is from 1954
[35:37] Lorraine said let me pass something here
[35:39] quickly as our times going listen did
[35:42] you know the Bible predicts that in the
[35:43] last days that there'll be a germ
[35:45] warfare that diseases will break a pop
[35:48] break out upon the people and will fall
[35:51] on everyone without the baptism of the
[35:55] Holy Ghost now that's quite a statement
[35:58] the only way this fits in the scripture
[36:02] is if it's tribulation period okay
[36:05] that's the only way it fits because
[36:07] imagine that everyone else without the
[36:09] baptism holy ghost gets judgment the
[36:12] only way that fits is the Tribulation
[36:13] Period yeah praise God because remember
[36:16] the rapture comes Saints at a time where
[36:18] people aren't expecting it if if this
[36:21] was in the church age everyone would
[36:23] know it's the rapture because everybody
[36:26] would be sick except those that are in
[36:27] the churches the real Holy Ghost filled
[36:29] churches so yep that's why we have to
[36:34] rightly divide the word of truth and
[36:36] don't get me wrong I believe this school
[36:38] I believe those everyone without
[36:40] everyone without the baptism holy ghost
[36:42] of the tribulation that will all the
[36:44] plagues will fall on them the Bible says
[36:46] that the Bible says that because it will
[36:49] fall on everyone who's not the 144,000
[36:52] praise God but there's but I we can't
[36:56] find any scripture that says during the
[36:58] church age
[36:59] though the germs will fall on everyone
[37:02] except the born-again Gentiles I don't
[37:05] see that I don't find that anywhere in
[37:06] the scripture he says now he's quoting
[37:11] member Ezekiel 9 which he said mark
[37:13] those that are signed crying in my house
[37:15] he said in everyone outside the city
[37:17] slay
[37:18] that's quite a Scripture only the people
[37:22] that are siding crying in God's house
[37:23] will be spared from being slain and
[37:26] everyone outside and he speaking of
[37:29] Jerusalem will be slain that are not
[37:31] sighing and crying that has to apply to
[37:33] the Tribulation Period
[37:34] right we know there's a lesson we know
[37:38] there's a spiritual lesson yes all those
[37:39] without the batson Holy Ghost will have
[37:41] to suffer and go through the tribulation
[37:42] we know that's spiritual but that's not
[37:45] a that's not a natural prophesy to the
[37:47] bride
[37:47] it's a spiritual prophesy to the bride
[37:50] it's natural to the 144,000 praise God I
[37:54] so hope everybody can understand that
[37:56] when when when message people use these
[37:58] quotes a lot of times it's they're not
[38:00] preachers and and that's nothing to say
[38:03] anything against them but if they don't
[38:05] have a gift to rightly divide the word
[38:06] they're gonna get it mixed up okay and
[38:09] what it does is I said last week it
[38:11] creates a fear upon people oh I better
[38:13] make sure I've got the Holy Ghost or I'm
[38:15] gonna get the coronavirus that's not
[38:16] what brother Graham saying okay and then
[38:20] we know there are people that had the
[38:21] Holy Ghost and had truck awful things
[38:23] happen look at Paul you know it couldn't
[38:25] you know a demon buffeting him he says a
[38:30] messenger from Satan is buffeting me yet
[38:33] he's born again so we know being born
[38:35] again doesn't promise us a life a picnic
[38:39] right it doesn't promise a picnic and so
[38:41] we got to be very careful how we
[38:43] interpret these quotes now let me
[38:44] continue on but with the angel or who
[38:47] had charged over these plagues was given
[38:49] orders to touch no one on whom the mark
[38:52] was why how much what kind of teachers
[38:55] have we got to be brethren to get the
[38:57] church in order to be in that condition
[38:59] immune so brother Adam is actually
[39:01] applying it to the church but we know by
[39:03] Scripture brother Branham grew in his
[39:04] understanding he grew in his
[39:06] understanding and he said later all
[39:08] these plagues don't happen in the church
[39:10] age he said they happen in the
[39:11] tribulation period
[39:13] so this is a quote we rode brother man
[39:14] makes it sound like it's applied to the
[39:16] church but later he grows an
[39:18] understanding and realizes all that all
[39:20] these great worldwide plagues they're
[39:22] all for the tribulation okay so let me
[39:27] just share that there that we're not we
[39:29] don't want to be we don't want to be
[39:31] careless about how we use quotes that's
[39:33] and when we are that's when people get
[39:36] into false doctrines that's when people
[39:38] get into things like oh every word
[39:39] brother Ram says thus saith the Lord
[39:41] that's how they get into things like
[39:42] that because they they don't take enough
[39:44] time to pray about it and line it up and
[39:47] rightly divide the word of God alright
[39:50] so here's the second one that's the
[39:51] first one the second one is in 1960 he
[39:55] said he's talking about how in the
[39:58] beginning was the word the Word was with
[40:00] God the Word was God he said the Word of
[40:01] God lives tonight in us in the power of
[40:04] the Holy Spirit discerning even the
[40:07] thoughts of the heart how we thank thee
[40:09] that in this great hour when all hopes
[40:11] immortal life is finished atomic bombs
[40:14] are laying in the hangars hydrogen bombs
[40:18] sickness diseases germ warfare Oh God
[40:22] and everything the way it is knowing
[40:23] that the Bible said that man would
[40:25] actually rot in their flesh and that
[40:28] angel was given the Commission don't you
[40:30] touch any of those don't you come near
[40:33] those who has the wine and oil now
[40:36] that's a third seal quote brother
[40:39] Branham uses that later he says that was
[40:41] for the Dark Ages so see this is this is
[40:45] before the seals so brother Graham said
[40:47] the Bible became a new book when the
[40:49] seals were open praise God
[40:51] see brother Graham is just trying to do
[40:53] his best both these quotes are before
[40:54] the seals on germ warfare you just look
[40:57] up germ warfare and so he uses a third
[41:00] seal quote which he later says was thus
[41:03] saith the Lord it dealt with the church
[41:05] ages during the dark ages so like from
[41:08] 1,000 and it went up to about 1700 so
[41:12] he's speaking of still 700 years but
[41:14] here he's applying it before the those
[41:17] seals are open he's applying it to his
[41:19] day but it wasn't for his day it was for
[41:21] the previous day
[41:22] help us Lord amen god help us to be
[41:25] solid amen
[41:27] that's the thing today we need to be
[41:28] solid upon God's Word amen
[41:30] we need to ask the Holy Spirit to help
[41:32] us rightly divide the word of truth you
[41:34] know brother Austin sent me a text this
[41:36] week and he said what about this
[41:37] coronavirus I sent him a link to my
[41:39] sermon last week the coronavirus was
[41:41] prophesied by Jesus he said it's one of
[41:44] the Sorrows but it's not the end the end
[41:48] will be the plagues and the vials and
[41:50] the woes that's the end of the earth
[41:52] that's the end of the world as we know
[41:54] here today the world systems and so I
[41:58] hope that helped him by God's grace and
[42:00] then he uses the quote again from
[42:02] Ezekiel 9 don't touch those who the seal
[42:04] of God upon their forehead now that
[42:07] could be for the Jews as well praise the
[42:08] Lord so church I hope I just want to
[42:11] share those there's two quotes about
[42:12] germ warfare and we got to be careful
[42:14] how we use them so we don't promote fear
[42:18] rather than faith praise God and we want
[42:21] to rightly divide them and church I'll
[42:22] even say this I'm not gonna use any
[42:24] names but I did get a quote saying when
[42:26] I use that I'm sorry did get a text last
[42:28] week saying when I use that quote to
[42:31] encourage us not to promote fear I had
[42:33] somebody text me and repent for misusing
[42:35] that quote and they admitted it was the
[42:38] Holy Spirit discerning their hearts
[42:41] Very's God and now I just read you he's
[42:43] saying everyone without the Holy Ghost
[42:46] will get the germs that has to be the
[42:48] tribulation because there is nothing in
[42:50] that with the Word of God we don't see
[42:52] any prophecy with that with the Word of
[42:54] God can I give you another one real
[42:56] quick let me give you nothing a lot of
[42:58] people I've heard a lot of preachers say
[43:00] lately because I had a lot of time to
[43:01] listen to preachers cuz you know I'm at
[43:04] home not at school not at work I'm still
[43:08] working but I'm just not working the
[43:09] whole time I'm a lot of preachers use
[43:12] this this quote where brother Branham
[43:13] says I don't see anything that could
[43:15] hinder the rapture brother masters I
[43:17] don't see any scriptures that need to be
[43:19] fulfilled and until the rapture could
[43:21] take place but but that might be true
[43:24] but remember bro Graham said pick up
[43:26] your pen and write and he said according
[43:28] to revelation 13:16 the Beast is going
[43:31] to force the bride from preaching yes so
[43:36] see people will
[43:38] their souls like on one quote a germ
[43:42] warfare or I don't see any scriptures
[43:44] that need to be fulfilled the rapture
[43:45] could happen but yet what about other
[43:47] quotes so see the reason I'm saying that
[43:51] I like the HOS dad knows that I'm
[43:53] talking about because a lot of people
[43:54] say let's see there's there's no
[43:55] scriptures that need to be fulfilled the
[43:57] rapture could happen tomorrow well it
[43:59] might be true but look there's other
[44:00] scriptures there's other quotes or
[44:02] brother Branham seems their reference
[44:03] scriptures where they have to stop they
[44:06] have to force the bride from stopping to
[44:08] preach like we read I showed it to you
[44:11] last week so see what do we need we need
[44:13] to be not be wishy washy and immature we
[44:16] need to wait upon what we say we need to
[44:19] make sure that we're solid praise God
[44:22] because I'll tell you those that really
[44:25] have the Holy Ghost that are listening
[44:27] to fivefold ministry they won't be
[44:28] tossed by every wind of quote or wind of
[44:31] doctrine right they won't be tossed
[44:33] they'll be silent on God's Word so I
[44:36] just say like this well that's fine it
[44:38] is you know whichever quote you want to
[44:39] take one thing I know I want to be born
[44:41] again I want to be solid I would I want
[44:43] to I want to pray for people to be saved
[44:45] and be filled with the Holy Ghost
[44:47] you see I think a lot of people use
[44:49] these quotes to scare people because
[44:51] they're not ready right so because
[44:55] they're not ready they use it the wrong
[44:58] way right and a lot of times too they
[45:01] don't study deep enough or into the Word
[45:04] of God because remember Jesus said or
[45:05] Paul said the Holy Spirit searched the
[45:07] deep things yea the deep things of God
[45:10] see the Holy Spirit would take you
[45:12] deeper like Simon preached would dig it
[45:13] out praise God if you really want to get
[45:16] somewhere you got to dig out and find
[45:17] the very solid foundation of God's Word
[45:20] amen hallelujah praise God so see how
[45:24] those those are - there you have germ
[45:25] warfare 's 1 then you have this other
[45:26] one where I don't see any scriptures the
[45:28] rapture could happen well that could be
[45:30] true but then you've got him saying
[45:31] other things later like revelation 13:16
[45:34] that this still has to be fulfilled
[45:36] before the rapture that's what he says
[45:38] in one place and he says something in
[45:39] another that's why we need the Holy
[45:41] Spirit to divide all truth praise God
[45:44] praise the Lord in church let me just
[45:47] let me know I say I'm not being critical
[45:48] again I'm just saying I see a lot of
[45:49] people tossed they're tossed from being
[45:53] fearful and then then their talks are
[45:55] like being prideful Oh like see I know I
[45:58] know all about the quotes and I know
[45:59] nothing can happen everything's already
[46:01] been fulfilled the rapture is gonna come
[46:03] and oh let's just be sincere praise God
[46:07] let's just be solid praise yeah let's
[46:09] just be loving let's just be a servant
[46:11] praise God rather than like I see a lot
[46:14] of people you know online they're
[46:16] thinking they try to be know-it-alls
[46:17] let's not try to be no dog let's just
[46:18] try to wait for the Holy Spirit to
[46:19] discern the truth from heir
[46:22] praise God now I just want to start with
[46:27] that so we had that okay now we did our
[46:29] text and our memory verse now let's look
[46:31] we'll try to get to the whole chapter
[46:32] here uh some of these things we've
[46:35] already gone over then josè me dad's we
[46:43] got listen up here real good real good
[46:46] and I and I and I think church if we're
[46:48] just humble then we will really consider
[46:51] these scriptures and examine our motives
[46:53] and how we we should look at how we
[46:56] treat children and grandchildren
[46:58] yeah we should especially as leaders
[47:01] because we're the leaders so that means
[47:02] the sisters are gonna look up to us in
[47:04] our homes and the children are gonna
[47:06] look to uh up to us so we we've got to
[47:09] be the ones to set a real godly example
[47:12] praise God and this is why as men we got
[47:16] to be really careful brothers not to get
[47:19] too upset because our anger can stir up
[47:23] other people to be angry right and you
[47:27] should see that like with you can see
[47:30] that with any politician it could be
[47:32] anyone it can be Obama Trump George W
[47:35] Bush if one of them leaders gets upset
[47:38] it will cause lots of people to be upset
[47:42] right
[47:43] any leader now also this is also true if
[47:46] the wife actually leads the home and she
[47:48] gets upset that will cause other people
[47:50] to be upset too right we've all seen
[47:53] that right where a woman actually she's
[47:56] in control of the home
[47:57] and she leads it by anger I've seen it
[47:59] in in some of my family members not in
[48:03] my house but in other places I've seen
[48:05] it where the woman actually the wife
[48:08] actually is the head of the home and by
[48:11] her anger she controls everybody else
[48:13] but today in the scripture the scripture
[48:16] is looking at the men as leaders and we
[48:19] have to make sure that we don't get
[48:21] angry praise God and we don't get bitter
[48:24] and we we don't get a we don't get wrath
[48:27] upon us right so let's look at this here
[48:31] now he's in 6 1 through 4 this is quite
[48:36] a statement here children obey your
[48:38] parents in the Lord for this is right
[48:41] so after chapter 5 now Paul begins
[48:46] writing to children but member of the
[48:48] previous chapter we looked at and I
[48:50] shared it with the sister and she said
[48:52] it was a real blessing she goes another
[48:53] church and she's a newly new mother and
[48:57] she said she said I never the last
[48:59] sermon I preached on marriage and
[49:00] husbands why she said I never heard it
[49:03] brought out like that I'd never knew the
[49:04] history of Rome and Ephesus she said
[49:06] this is really gonna help me and so I'm
[49:08] thankful that the Lord used that to help
[49:10] out a young wife remember Paul when he
[49:13] led into this he said submit yourselves
[49:16] one to another so he's he's promoting
[49:18] humility right brother branham member
[49:22] when brother Graham put on the apron to
[49:24] help out his wife
[49:25] that was him submitting right and
[49:27] submitting himself to his wife and his
[49:29] children serving them in order to help
[49:31] out the good of the family
[49:33] in other words submitting is you and I
[49:36] becoming servants that's why we
[49:39] emphasize that a few Wednesday's ago we
[49:41] need to be servants submit yourselves in
[49:44] the fear of God one to another so find
[49:47] out how can we serve each other praise
[49:48] God how can we help each other now one
[49:52] way you can do it is stay six feet away
[49:53] today I try to do that yesterday I went
[49:57] to it when I went to all day I tried to
[49:59] stay six feet and I'll let the guy get
[50:00] the cheese and I'll just keep my six
[50:02] feet away that's just a small example
[50:05] but when there's no virus around we
[50:08] should see how we can help people
[50:09] financially or with food
[50:11] or prayer many times or a hug or
[50:14] handshake or text they're just reaching
[50:18] out to people to help them is such an
[50:20] encouragement like I told you there's a
[50:23] man that I he calls me I'm his mentor
[50:27] and he says he'll just get my text and
[50:28] I'll say I'm just praying for you
[50:30] brother he'll say it brings tears to my
[50:31] eyes to know that you're praying for me
[50:33] and so that's one way I can we can
[50:35] submit ourselves others is reminding
[50:38] ourselves to pray for other people and
[50:40] to lift them up before God amen and see
[50:44] how we can serve other peoples so he
[50:46] says submit yourselves he says wives
[50:47] first submit their husbands and then
[50:50] husbands love your wives and so he he
[50:54] shows that this is how the kingdom of
[50:56] God works it works in mutual submission
[50:59] praise God
[51:00] praise the Lord so wives submit to
[51:04] husbands and husbands love the wives
[51:07] live for them right that's that's how
[51:09] Christ showed his love for the church he
[51:11] died for the church he gave himself for
[51:13] the church so a husband should give
[51:15] themselves to love their wives amen
[51:18] and now after this great mystery of
[51:21] marriage now he breaks into the
[51:24] children's realm now remember we read
[51:26] you the history last a couple of weeks
[51:28] ago three weeks ago I think it is now
[51:30] children were just treated like animals
[51:32] almost in this society it was very sad
[51:35] the Society in Roman times was very very
[51:38] wicked now unless they were unless they
[51:42] were rich children were often just like
[51:45] very very mistreated they weren't valued
[51:48] so if you are not a rich Roman family or
[51:51] a family and Ephesus the children the
[51:55] children were just like little slaves
[51:56] right they were basically just kept at
[51:59] home until they were about seven or
[52:00] eight or nine and then if they were a
[52:02] boy then they would follow they'd go
[52:04] with their dad to the carpenter shop or
[52:06] they'd go with their dad out in the
[52:07] field even from seven or eight years old
[52:09] for those that you probably saw in your
[52:11] country huh with the poverty children
[52:14] work in a young ages that and that's all
[52:20] they knew they were not taught to read
[52:22] write anything they were not taught
[52:24] anything
[52:25] important uh they were just they were
[52:28] basically there to serve and work and as
[52:32] you saw in the Roman times the Roman men
[52:35] they could beat their children or their
[52:37] wives and there was nothing that could
[52:39] be done women couldn't testify in court
[52:41] neither could children only men could it
[52:44] was just an awful society and children
[52:48] weren't valued very much now if you were
[52:49] rich yes and your children would get a
[52:51] tutor I think at the age of eight they
[52:53] would get a tutor and they be talking
[52:54] science and math and and then they would
[52:57] go up to a college right and they would
[52:59] learn and there would be scholars and
[53:01] they were they were more valued I
[53:03] imagine to the rich people but Paul is
[53:06] writing to the Christians and Ephesus
[53:09] these wouldn't have been the most rich
[53:11] people they would have been the common
[53:12] people and he specifically points the
[53:15] children obey your parents in the Lord
[53:17] for this is right
[53:19] so Paul reminds the children it is right
[53:23] it's the thing God wants you to do is to
[53:25] obey your parents
[53:26] now the word obey means to listen
[53:29] hearken one who on the knock at the door
[53:31] comes to listen who it is
[53:34] so children when shooters say you know
[53:37] when you hear a knock you want to go
[53:39] open the door that's how a voice of a
[53:42] parent should be to the Father Lydia
[53:45] Malachi can you come here real quick we
[53:47] should respond right away now in this
[53:49] age the children should pause their
[53:51] iPads right or pause their phone yeah
[53:55] dad yes dad how can I help your mom how
[53:57] can I help you and not be like yeah sure
[54:00] sure you should come when it when it's
[54:04] not you should come right
[54:06] that's obedience when you hear the voice
[54:09] come right respond to it now this is a
[54:13] good lesson for all the spiritual
[54:15] children when we hear the knock of God
[54:19] on our heart yes Lord
[54:20] yeah come come and deal with me in this
[54:22] situation deal in this room in my life
[54:24] right this is what the word obey means
[54:28] someone who listens for the nut and then
[54:31] they open that door they respond right
[54:33] away let's not leave Jesus out there
[54:35] knocking and just outside let's open the
[54:38] door
[54:38] let him come in praise God so this is
[54:40] what the word obey means obey your
[54:44] parents in the Lord for this is right
[54:46] now children let me say this just like a
[54:48] wife if a father or a husband sisters
[54:53] ask us to do something and we're not
[54:55] sure it's right it's okay to say that
[54:57] right is that okay is that is that the
[55:01] right thing for me to do because
[55:02] remember brother Branham asked me to lie
[55:05] and Meeta said is that the right thing
[55:07] to do Billy there's nothing wrong with
[55:10] that as long as it's done meekness are
[55:13] you sure dad you sure this would be
[55:16] right thing to do as long as it's asked
[55:20] in meekness because we only want to obey
[55:23] the things of the Lord we want to we
[55:26] want a submissive spirit we want to
[55:28] obedient spirit but look look how
[55:30] sensitive Mita was to the Holy Spirit
[55:32] her husband a prophet of God says lie
[55:35] tell him I'm not here but like he's
[55:37] right there he is there he said would
[55:40] that be is that exactly right Billy
[55:41] imagine she's holding the phone like
[55:43] cover in the folk are you sure that's
[55:44] right Billy is that the right thing to
[55:46] do and then he said yeah just tell him
[55:48] I'm not here I'm going outside so she
[55:50] lied said no he's not here right now but
[55:54] she asked him are you sure that's right
[55:59] so I want to just make sure the Bible
[56:02] says that obey your parents in the Lord
[56:04] so children you have that right if
[56:06] you're not sure if what Dad is asking
[56:08] you to do is the right thing you you
[56:10] have it's okay to ask me it's okay I'm
[56:13] not God I'm not right on everything fact
[56:16] I'll make mistakes right every person
[56:19] does and so that's and so that is so
[56:21] that we don't trust in other people but
[56:23] we trust in the Living God yes we follow
[56:26] the leadership and we follow the pastors
[56:28] in the fivefold ministry yes we follow a
[56:30] prophet of God we do that but we never
[56:33] make them the absolute God is the
[56:35] absolute so see that means to abase
[56:41] obedient to submit and then the Bible
[56:45] says in verse 2 now Paul quotes Moses so
[56:48] where does Paul get his where does Paul
[56:50] get his authority from Moses the Old
[56:53] Covenant praise God because it was a mo
[56:57] law praise God it was one of the Ten
[57:00] Commandments the moral law of God
[57:02] remember there was three kinds of laws
[57:03] there was 616 Old Testament laws but
[57:06] there was three kinds there was moral
[57:08] civil and ceremonial which is Levitical
[57:12] and we know the Levitical was fulfilled
[57:15] because Hebrew says were under a new
[57:18] priesthood amen and this kind of blood
[57:21] takes away our desire to want to say
[57:24] Amen
[57:25] he said that's been fulfilled we have a
[57:27] new High Priest hallelujah it's not
[57:30] Aaron in this children anymore
[57:31] it's Jesus it's Melchizedek came ahead
[57:34] it's a Melchizedek priest and this
[57:36] priest lives forever praise God he has
[57:39] the power of an endless life amen now I
[57:43] want to just emphasize that and I wrote
[57:46] that my book so the people would
[57:49] understand Paul gets his authority from
[57:52] the the previous covenant because God
[57:54] changes not and if God wants that
[57:57] command to continue on then God will let
[58:00] us know that it's going to continue on
[58:02] and that's what Paul does Paul lets us
[58:05] know God's command his moral law is
[58:08] continuing now into the New Testament if
[58:14] not then why did Paul quote Moses he had
[58:17] to quote Moses cuz God's moral law was
[58:20] it still a sin to murder it's still a
[58:23] sin to lie right it's still a sin to
[58:26] commit adultery right so that moral law
[58:29] much of that moral righteous law has
[58:31] carried over into the New Testament and
[58:34] if we're not sure we right ask the Holy
[58:36] Spirit to rightly divide the word of God
[58:38] like I'll give you an example just a
[58:40] moment with beards there's some Mester
[58:42] churches that say you got to grow beards
[58:44] yeah I should say that's okay that they
[58:47] can have their Liberty to do that but
[58:49] see that's where it gets it gets down it
[58:51] gets more challenging right because now
[58:53] well now you have a old test
[58:54] command it's pretty close to Deuteronomy
[58:56] 22:5 or it's pretty close to the
[58:58] Levitical law that we keep or this law
[59:02] in Leviticus right and so see what does
[59:04] it take it takes the Holy Spirit to
[59:05] guide us into all truth
[59:08] praise God now so this is the verse to
[59:12] honor thy father and mother which is the
[59:15] first commandment with promise and
[59:18] that's one thing I can say oh by God's
[59:20] grace when I was younger I really tried
[59:23] to honor my mother there's some times I
[59:25] said some things I told you before she'd
[59:27] stick soap in my mouth and I'd spit it
[59:29] out you know excited talk back and say
[59:31] dirty words and she she waited till I
[59:33] was like relaxed then she'd sneak up
[59:35] from behind and pour the soap right in
[59:37] my mouth I'm spitting out soap and all
[59:40] kinds of things like that but as I try
[59:42] to get older I tried to obey her and
[59:46] honor her I'll be that's why God has
[59:48] honored my life because if you honor
[59:51] them then the Bible says it's the first
[59:53] commandment with promise verse 3 that it
[59:57] may be well with thee and thou may us
[59:59] live long on the earth so that's a
[1:00:03] promise of God if you honor your mother
[1:00:06] and father then it's like honoring God
[1:00:09] and God will bless you he'll make your
[1:00:11] life well right and you'll live a long
[1:00:14] life on the earth
[1:00:15] praise God now let me just I want to put
[1:00:20] this up here because I've been reading
[1:00:21] this book here I'll show it with you
[1:00:23] it's called brief be fruitful multiply
[1:00:25] and it just shows all the scriptures
[1:00:27] about having children and it's a
[1:00:29] beautify God's grace but it's a
[1:00:30] beautiful book but see today if we have
[1:00:36] God's life if we're born again if we
[1:00:40] enjoy God's spiritual life that we ought
[1:00:43] to rejoice in God's natural life as well
[1:00:46] right because a child is not in the
[1:00:48] image of the devil a child in the image
[1:00:51] of God and we don't know who's going to
[1:00:54] be saved and who's not going to be saved
[1:00:56] so what I'm saying is that message
[1:01:00] believes especially message believers
[1:01:01] saying that we've got the Holy Ghost we
[1:01:04] should rejoice in God's natural life
[1:01:06] because we
[1:01:08] God's spiritual life praise God we're
[1:01:10] God's spiritual children so we should
[1:01:12] rejoice in natural children that's right
[1:01:16] raise god the bible speaks very highly
[1:01:18] of children and let me read a few
[1:01:22] scriptures you got your bibles let's
[1:01:24] read a couple here let's read them real
[1:01:29] familiar one first Psalms 127 let's go
[1:01:32] there I just pulled out a few I thought
[1:01:34] you would like here they always
[1:01:37] encourage me
[1:01:38] Psalms 127 yeah verse three 127 3 the
[1:01:49] Bible said children are a reward from
[1:01:51] God first 3 low children are an heritage
[1:01:55] of the Lord so they're God's heritage
[1:01:57] they're really part of God's family
[1:01:59] praise God they're from God from his
[1:02:03] mind and the fruit of the womb is his
[1:02:05] reward so see when when God sends us
[1:02:08] children it's like God is blessing that
[1:02:11] womb of that mother saying this is a
[1:02:13] good thing I'm blessing this family I'm
[1:02:15] blessing this marriage praise God he's
[1:02:17] putting his stamp of approval there
[1:02:19] praise God now look at verse 4 here's
[1:02:22] here's what I like here as arrows are in
[1:02:24] the hand of a mighty man so are the
[1:02:27] children of the use now what is an arrow
[1:02:29] it's for an offensive attack Amen so God
[1:02:32] is God is placing me as a father or all
[1:02:35] the father's as soldiers with a bow and
[1:02:39] arrow and we're supposed to walk out
[1:02:42] against Satan we're armed against Satan
[1:02:44] and our arrows are our children and our
[1:02:47] children are being leashed into Satan's
[1:02:50] Eden and they're gonna do damage against
[1:02:52] Satan's Eden praise God amen
[1:02:56] I don't know yeah that's the picture
[1:02:57] God's painting here it's a dark world
[1:02:59] it's an evil world but I've got some
[1:03:01] soldiers that have some arrows that I'm
[1:03:04] gonna shoot out and they're gonna
[1:03:05] conquer in my name praise God hallelujah
[1:03:09] amen so I think about you know Simon the
[1:03:13] arrow brother Simon my mom shout out my
[1:03:17] dad you know cam and me we're
[1:03:21] chose combating the kingdom of Satan
[1:03:24] amen
[1:03:26] that's why you know that's how that's
[1:03:27] the way the Bible said Peter was a
[1:03:29] firebrand that means a stick that's
[1:03:31] plucked out of the fire and it's got a
[1:03:32] burning tip at the front so Peter would
[1:03:36] shout out as and he burned and he he was
[1:03:39] burning with the fire of God amen and he
[1:03:42] was - an attack I'll say like this
[1:03:44] I was shot out to strike Akron and come
[1:03:48] against all the evil in Akron praise God
[1:03:50] or Copley Ohio you might say - that's
[1:03:55] what you are - you're one of God's
[1:03:56] arrows praise God shout out and you're
[1:03:59] going to be on fire and you're to burn
[1:04:01] up just whatever is within your little
[1:04:03] reach praise God praise the Lord
[1:04:07] see that's what children are but they
[1:04:10] got to be in the hand of a mighty man
[1:04:12] but mighty in the scripture hey God
[1:04:15] doesn't care about our natural muscles
[1:04:17] it's our spiritual faith amen happy see
[1:04:21] this is the reason people aren't happy
[1:04:22] many times because they don't have the
[1:04:24] children God want them to have right
[1:04:27] because the Bible said happy as a man
[1:04:29] that has his quiver full full of them
[1:04:34] they shall not be ashamed but they shall
[1:04:36] speak with the enemies and the gates
[1:04:37] this woman who wrote this she says she
[1:04:39] gets she got letters every week of women
[1:04:43] that were riding her saying saying they
[1:04:47] suffered from guilt from the devil
[1:04:49] because they spent all their early years
[1:04:52] believing Satan's lie that oh you can't
[1:04:54] afford children and stop having children
[1:04:56] and then after her years to be bare
[1:04:59] after years being fruitful past and
[1:05:01] she's barren then the devil beats her up
[1:05:03] and say see you should have had more
[1:05:04] children see you should have had more
[1:05:05] children see that so Satan makes when
[1:05:10] you're young Satan makes you think oh
[1:05:11] you can't afford them and tries that and
[1:05:13] then when you're older and if you you
[1:05:15] believe is lies then it'll beat you up
[1:05:17] because you know the Bible says you
[1:05:18] should add more but see the Bible said
[1:05:21] happy is the man that asses quiver full
[1:05:24] of them they shall not be ashamed but
[1:05:26] they shall speak with the enemies in the
[1:05:28] gates praise God
[1:05:30] amen the gates were the place of
[1:05:32] judgment right so the Bible says your
[1:05:34] children
[1:05:35] will speak to the enemies in the gate
[1:05:37] Amen hallelujah see your weapons speak
[1:05:41] to your enemies
[1:05:43] praise God right we saw those we watched
[1:05:46] some animal videos what they do they
[1:05:48] member those chimpanzees they grind
[1:05:50] their teeth their that's their weapons
[1:05:52] right they let their enemies know they
[1:05:54] got weapons praise God and that's so
[1:05:56] that's what the devil sees right the
[1:05:58] devil sees our weapons Amen I'm not by
[1:06:01] myself I've got children that will pray
[1:06:03] I've got children that will be soldiers
[1:06:05] for God I got turned that know the Word
[1:06:08] of God amen
[1:06:09] and they're gonna defend me in other
[1:06:10] words my life is a testimony my
[1:06:14] integrity is seen the enemy can't deny
[1:06:16] the sincerity of my family praise God
[1:06:19] amen and the godliness that's in my
[1:06:22] family it speaks against the enemies
[1:06:26] that try to bring criticism on us so if
[1:06:29] we live a godly life the the holiness of
[1:06:32] our family will witness for us against
[1:06:34] our enemies praise God hallelujah so
[1:06:43] that's the reason people aren't very
[1:06:44] happy they don't have the children God
[1:06:45] is calling them to have you know there's
[1:06:48] other scriptures on that too there's
[1:06:49] lots of scriptures on that about it
[1:06:52] makes you happy yeah look at Luke

[1:07:15] way where the angel could visit
[1:07:17] Elizabeth and touch her womb praise God
[1:07:19] praise the Lord they live such a godly
[1:07:25] life all those years that when other
[1:07:26] people thought there's no way you can

[1:07:31] visited her blessed her in her womb and
[1:07:33] gave her John Luke 1:14 exodus read 13
[1:07:39] but the angel said unto him fear not
[1:07:41] Zacharias for that prayer is heard and
[1:07:43] my wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son
[1:07:45] and thou shalt call his name John and
[1:07:47] thou shalt have joy and gladness and

[1:08:19] Kingdom

[1:10:53] that they're not I'll say like this I
[1:10:54] don't mean to we're not exalting anybody
[1:10:56] or anything like that but they're not
[1:10:57] strong enough to overcome the
[1:10:59] temptations of Satan but those who love
[1:11:02] the commands of God are mighty in the
[1:11:04] scriptures raise god amen they have more
[1:11:07] might because the Bible says our weapons
[1:11:09] are mighty through the pulling down of
[1:11:11] strongholds praise God that's what it
[1:11:14] means we're mighty in the scripture we
[1:11:16] believe God's Word we overcome
[1:11:18] temptation we live a life of holiness of
[1:11:21] righteousness we're the children of God

[1:11:27] hallelujah
[1:11:30] Amos 2:11 Amos 2:11 Daniel Hosea Joel
[1:11:40] and Amos Amos 2:11 now here I read you
[1:11:49] remember I read you the the heat the the
[1:11:52] hey man scriptures a couple weeks ago
[1:11:54] how the Bible specifically said in the
[1:11:58] times of David that hey man was given
[1:12:00] those children so they could worship in
[1:12:02] the house of God that was their whole
[1:12:04] purpose in life was to be worshipers
[1:12:05] like they men like you children and our
[1:12:09] sister on the computer everybody finds
[1:12:12] their part in singing song specials like
[1:12:13] Jose and Naomi you just find your
[1:12:16] purpose and God just wants you to be
[1:12:18] faithful with your purpose he said
[1:12:22] that's the reason they were born was
[1:12:24] under David's leadership was to worship
[1:12:26] God and lead worship in the house of God
[1:12:29] their whole purpose for being alive amen
[1:12:32] praise God Amos 2:11 I see here's some
[1:12:35] other arrows that got another purpose
[1:12:37] verse 11 Amos 2:11 and I raised up of
[1:12:41] your sons for what for profits and of
[1:12:45] your young men for Nazarites is it not
[1:12:49] even thus oh ye turn of Israel saith the
[1:12:52] Lord member Amos is rebuking them he had
[1:12:53] he came at a time when there were awful
[1:12:56] awful condition he prophesied against
[1:12:58] the Northern Kingdom
[1:13:00] so not Judah the northern one they were
[1:13:01] destroyed first and taken as captives
[1:13:04] first but he said what what did God say
[1:13:07] I raised up your sons to be prophets I
[1:13:10] raised up your son's to be Nazarites
[1:13:13] amen so see God has a purpose he's
[1:13:17] sharpening these arrows praise God he's
[1:13:20] gonna shoot them out to prophesy he's
[1:13:22] gonna shoot them out to be devoted and
[1:13:24] dedicated as Nazarites unto God under
[1:13:27] file from the things of the world praise
[1:13:29] God that's the reason they were born to
[1:13:32] be a prophet to be a Nazarite to be a
[1:13:34] preacher Amen to be a song leader praise
[1:13:36] God to be a dreamer praise God to be a
[1:13:39] one who prays and in
[1:13:41] for divine healing God is a purpose for
[1:13:43] every one of these arrows praise God
[1:13:45] amen I'm not going to go there but
[1:13:50] remember Jesus was one of seven children
[1:13:53] at least because they list Jesus and
[1:13:57] they list for yeah the list there was
[1:14:01] four of his brothers so you have Jesus
[1:14:03] four of his brothers and then sisters at
[1:14:05] least two sisters you could add more I
[1:14:09] remember when Jesus was dedicated why
[1:14:11] did Mary and Joseph take they took
[1:14:13] turtledoves to his sacrifice and if you
[1:14:15] read Leviticus that means they were very
[1:14:18] poor because if they were rich they're
[1:14:20] supposed to bring a Bullock so this
[1:14:22] wasn't some rich family that God sent
[1:14:25] his son to he sent him to a poor humble
[1:14:28] and then you know what he kept sending
[1:14:29] brother Jose he said at least six more
[1:14:33] at least six more oh well we can't
[1:14:38] afford it God's with us praise God God
[1:14:41] is with us amen he's blessing the fruit
[1:14:45] of your womb praise God amen the Bible
[1:14:51] said in Nehemiah nine that they lacked
[1:14:53] nothing the children of Israel when they
[1:14:56] came over they crossed the desert they
[1:14:57] came to rebuild the wall they lacked
[1:14:59] nothing their sons and the daughters
[1:15:00] lacked nothing in church let me say this
[1:15:03] even though earnest for forty years
[1:15:05] Israel walked around those that that
[1:15:07] didn't believe right I just read that
[1:15:09] this week they wouldn't go take the
[1:15:10] promised land
[1:15:11] God still fed them two million people
[1:15:13] God still fed that unbelieving
[1:15:16] generation for two for forty years
[1:15:18] that's how merciful God is he made sure
[1:15:22] they had everything they need whether it
[1:15:24] was quail or whether it was manna God
[1:15:26] takes care of his arrows amen glory
[1:15:37] 50/50 split with a man about half the
[1:15:39] message people make fun of me for my
[1:15:40] family about half of them love me for it
[1:15:43] one thing I know God loves me forward
[1:15:46] raised God let me tell you I'm gonna
[1:15:48] preaching or winning up a week's here
[1:15:50] there's more data that more babies have
[1:15:55] been killed through the pill then
[1:15:58] through abortion yeah the actual surgery
[1:16:01] there's more data that proves that
[1:16:05] because think about you have millions
[1:16:07] times millions of women in churches
[1:16:09] taking the pill and what it does it
[1:16:12] weakens the the uterine wall so a a a
[1:16:16] gand sperm that that's it's made alive I
[1:16:19] can't member the exact words it can't
[1:16:21] attach to the wall that's what those
[1:16:23] pills and those chemicals do so even a
[1:16:26] fertilized egg that's life it will get
[1:16:29] flushed out and die because those pills
[1:16:32] make the lining of the uterus wall not
[1:16:34] strong enough there's probably been more
[1:16:37] abortions done through the pill than
[1:16:41] even through the actual surgery of
[1:16:43] abortion and preachers won't preach it I
[1:16:47] hear though this preacher is gonna
[1:16:49] preach it praise God because God is the
[1:16:51] author of life Satan is the one who
[1:16:53] comes the steal kill and destroy
[1:16:58] that's right that's right
[1:17:02] not a lot people don't know that but
[1:17:03] that's true God takes care of his people
[1:17:06] praise the Lord thank the Lord now let
[1:17:11] me get off of that that's important I've
[1:17:13] been reading on that this is actually
[1:17:14] the second book I've read on I have
[1:17:15] another book on it just wanting to read
[1:17:18] on that by God's grace okay now here now
[1:17:21] fathers discipline in love let's go back
[1:17:23] to Ephesians here oh good I got plenty
[1:17:26] of time here praise the Lord I'm not
[1:17:28] gonna worry about time by God's grace
[1:17:30] help me Jesus season six okay so it's
[1:17:36] these children that God has sent us
[1:17:38] we're to train them to honor us in love
[1:17:41] we must use love and not anger verse 4
[1:17:47] and ye father's you don't say nothing
[1:17:48] about the moms
[1:17:49] now of course moms need to use love but
[1:17:51] Paul feels led of the Holy Spirit to
[1:17:52] emphasize this to dads ye father's
[1:17:54] provoke not your children to wrath but
[1:17:59] bring them up in the nurture and
[1:18:01] admonition of the Lord see and an
[1:18:03] Ephesian on regular Ephesian without God
[1:18:06] would have just treated their children
[1:18:08] like trash because that's what they were
[1:18:10] to them they weren't really that great
[1:18:11] they didn't really think highly of them
[1:18:13] but Paul says if you got the Holy Ghost
[1:18:16] he said you fathers do not provoke your
[1:18:19] children to wrath in other words use the
[1:18:21] right spirit that word provoke means and
[1:18:23] rage don't enrage your children so
[1:18:26] they're enraged against you see that but
[1:18:32] he said bring them up in the nurture and
[1:18:34] the admonition of the Lord that means
[1:18:36] the discipline and the admonition of
[1:18:38] Lord so you've got to correct your
[1:18:39] children but he said don't make it so
[1:18:42] it's so harsh that they get angry with
[1:18:45] you and that's why I was telling this
[1:18:48] woman not to and I even preach it here
[1:18:50] but the Bible says a soft answer turns
[1:18:52] away wrath I've had some children that
[1:18:55] they get really sad when I discipline
[1:18:57] them I've had others that get mad how
[1:19:01] come some of them are real they're okay
[1:19:02] with it they just get humble other ones
[1:19:04] like want to fight you back why is that
[1:19:07] because I just got different
[1:19:08] personalities I can't control how
[1:19:10] they're gonna respond but I can reach
[1:19:12] all I can control how I respond so a
[1:19:17] soft answer will turn away their wrath
[1:19:19] Oh daddy don't do that daddy
[1:19:22] what do you mean daddy you gotta turn
[1:19:23] well it's your did wrong you should not
[1:19:26] have done that I told you not to do that
[1:19:27] I warned you repeatedly you got to use a
[1:19:30] soft they have to have to feel you're
[1:19:33] sweet and loving spirit praise God right
[1:19:37] just like the Bible said in Colossians
[1:19:39] Colossians the letter that that metate
[1:19:42] Saffy's a lot but Paul tells those
[1:19:44] husbands husbands love your wives and be
[1:19:47] not bitter against them so brothers and
[1:19:49] grandfathers and brothers in our homes
[1:19:52] it's so important as leaders that we
[1:19:54] have a gentle loving spirit because Paul
[1:19:58] specifically says don't be bitter to
[1:20:00] your wives and don't enrage your
[1:20:03] children see because men we got
[1:20:05] tossed her own and we want to I want to
[1:20:07] get something done and I don't want to
[1:20:08] wait and that's how I am you know
[1:20:09] sometimes it's not proud of it it's a
[1:20:12] thing I got to overcome but we as
[1:20:15] leaders by the Holy Spirit we got to be
[1:20:17] so in love with God and in love with his
[1:20:19] commands that God can soften our hearts
[1:20:22] to make us loving because if we enrage
[1:20:27] our children we've broken God's commands
[1:20:29] and if we are bitter and upset with our
[1:20:33] wives
[1:20:33] something's wrong with us and it's only
[1:20:38] gonna work its way from the top down our
[1:20:40] influence is the most brothers our
[1:20:42] influence is the most important and it's
[1:20:44] gonna work its way all the way down
[1:20:46] that's what I have to really make sure
[1:20:48] our spirit is in the right condition by
[1:20:51] God's grace now let me just read this on
[1:20:53] beards real quick I've got three or four
[1:20:55] emails this past year on beards tell me
[1:20:58] like I gotta grow a beard because it's
[1:21:02] now the thing is I can't my DNA won't
[1:21:06] let me grow it or something like that
[1:21:07] but I just you know I wrote back a few
[1:21:09] scriptures here if I can find it
[1:21:11] oh yeah here it is help me Lord where's
[1:21:17] oh no I can't find oh your does it yeah
[1:21:22] okay yeah so this is just this this
[1:21:25] month I and I've got numerous ones and
[1:21:27] there's a few churches that say they
[1:21:28] followed by the RAM and they all their
[1:21:30] men have beards and it's because it's
[1:21:32] found in the scripture in the Old
[1:21:34] Testament it's in Leviticus 19 and
[1:21:37] Leviticus 20 one talks about men not
[1:21:39] rounding off their beards so they'll say
[1:21:43] well if you believe Deuteronomy 22:5
[1:21:44] about not cross-dressing what about
[1:21:47] beards and that's a good question
[1:21:49] it's honestly good question so what I
[1:21:52] said I said I don't see any clear
[1:21:54] references to men being required to have
[1:21:57] beards of the New Testament and also
[1:22:01] beards are not called an abomination
[1:22:03] right like cross-dressing is called an
[1:22:05] abomination that's a detestable hateful
[1:22:08] thing and then Revelation says no
[1:22:10] abomination will come in the kingdom of
[1:22:12] God so too
[1:22:15] beers are just a civil law to the men
[1:22:19] they're not a moral law it's not a moral
[1:22:21] law it's a civil law okay so that's the
[1:22:25] way I answered that one I don't see a
[1:22:29] New Testament author trying to persuade
[1:22:31] Gentiles to wear a beard and remember in
[1:22:35] acts 15 they had a council is actually
[1:22:37] Paul and James and different apostles
[1:22:39] came together and had a council well
[1:22:41] these these Gentiles got the Holy Ghost
[1:22:43] what should we tell them and they gave
[1:22:44] them those five things remember don't
[1:22:46] eat blood and don't commit fornication
[1:22:48] there's a couple others I could never
[1:22:49] remember all of them but he never
[1:22:52] mentioned well you got to grow your
[1:22:53] beards low and if you study the history
[1:22:56] Church the reason they weren't from
[1:22:58] there beers was because the heathens did
[1:23:00] that the heathens had a certain way of
[1:23:02] worship and they would cut it and round
[1:23:04] it off and make them look like a certain
[1:23:06] way to appease their gods to make him
[1:23:08] look like her gods so to me if you want
[1:23:15] to wear a beard that's a Christian
[1:23:16] Liberty but it's I don't see it required
[1:23:18] in the Word of God but I'll say like
[1:23:20] this if I grew out my beard and it
[1:23:22] stumbled somebody I would shave it your
[1:23:25] beer does not stumble me brother Jose
[1:23:27] and there are some times I get too busy
[1:23:29] I don't shave and it kind of looks like
[1:23:30] I maybe have a beard but I don't I just
[1:23:34] can't grow one but if if it did and if
[1:23:37] somebody came as church and said brother
[1:23:39] Jesse it really stumbles me when you
[1:23:40] don't shave I'll say okay god help me
[1:23:42] forgive me you know I'll try to shave
[1:23:45] every time before I preach I've never
[1:23:47] had that problem I just want to give you
[1:23:48] an example of how we Paul will use
[1:23:51] scripture from Moses and then people
[1:23:53] think well because he uses you know thou
[1:23:55] shalt you know parents or children obey
[1:23:57] your parents then you've got to wear a
[1:23:58] beard well we got a rightly divide that
[1:24:01] by God's grace right so I just want to
[1:24:05] give you a simple example all right so
[1:24:08] that's one there with beards I don't I
[1:24:10] can't see how you can prove that in the
[1:24:12] New Testament now this is an interesting
[1:24:14] thought I'm not gonna spend much time
[1:24:15] but go to verse 5 5 to 9 I look at is
[1:24:19] Paul now you know Roman times were a lot
[1:24:21] like Jewish times right they could have
[1:24:24] a slave they could own a slave you
[1:24:26] imagine that Raymond they owned a man
[1:24:28] they could own a man or a woman through
[1:24:31] slavery and Paul realized it Paul
[1:24:34] realized they could own slaves and so
[1:24:39] Paul has to specifically write to these
[1:24:41] brothers and be like you better be
[1:24:43] careful how you treat your slaves now
[1:24:47] was Paul saying slavery is okay no but
[1:24:50] he knew this and just like our founding
[1:24:53] fathers a lot of people don't like our
[1:24:54] founding fathers because a lot of them
[1:24:55] had slaves but listen the time wasn't
[1:24:58] right for the the time had to be right
[1:25:00] for the slaves to be set free the Bible
[1:25:03] said there's a time and season for
[1:25:04] everything why didn't Paul say slaves
[1:25:08] break out from your masters and leave
[1:25:11] and run away why did he say that because
[1:25:13] it wasn't the time and season everything
[1:25:16] works in time and season praise God
[1:25:19] remember when he preached on the
[1:25:20] pilgrims they they were there for years
[1:25:23] and years years why didn't they go it
[1:25:24] wasn't the time they continued to live
[1:25:27] under the tyranny that can but then the
[1:25:29] time came where we can't send it anymore
[1:25:31] we've got to break out same thing here
[1:25:34] same thing there's a time and season for
[1:25:39] everything do I agree with savory
[1:25:40] absolutely not I'm glad we don't got it
[1:25:43] praise God where's your slaves to the
[1:25:44] banquet Amen right to pay off our houses
[1:25:47] or just slaves to the bank to buy that
[1:25:50] pay off that car I'm a slave to my jet
[1:25:53] my uh my boss well I like working there
[1:25:56] though some are not really slave but we
[1:25:59] feel like we're slaves to the mortgage
[1:26:00] company right but no of course you know
[1:26:05] and even though even Abraham Lincoln
[1:26:07] he's want to set him free but George
[1:26:09] Washington and John Adams James Madison
[1:26:12] they all knew slavery was wrong they
[1:26:13] were trying to get out of it
[1:26:14] it was so entrenched into their system
[1:26:17] they were trying to get out of it they
[1:26:21] didn't know how to get out of it because
[1:26:22] it wasn't the timing yet and I believe
[1:26:25] slavery is wrong they're not Heat
[1:26:26] Paul's not condoning slavery here he's
[1:26:28] just recognizing we're in a certain
[1:26:30] system now we're in the Roman system God
[1:26:32] has allowed this for a time and season
[1:26:34] this if you're in a slave this is how
[1:26:36] you should act as a Christian if you're
[1:26:37] a master this is how you should act as a
[1:26:39] master does that help by God's grace
[1:26:42] I don't think slavery is ever right I
[1:26:44] don't think it's ever right but God had
[1:26:46] a form of slavery in the Old Testament
[1:26:48] remember if they became a slave they not
[1:26:50] this they lose their land but in the
[1:26:52] Jubilee they get it back hey man
[1:26:54] praise God God had a way to get him back
[1:26:56] but God did allow it
[1:26:58] God did allow it sometimes now verse 5
[1:27:01] servants be obedient to them that are
[1:27:03] your masters according to their flesh
[1:27:04] with fear and trembling so this is how
[1:27:06] he taught these servants to serve be
[1:27:09] real respectful fear and trembling in
[1:27:11] singleness or sincerity of your heart as
[1:27:14] in to the Lord
[1:27:15] so he told these servants you serve your
[1:27:17] masters like you're serving God then
[1:27:19] that sound familiar
[1:27:20] husbands wives love you or submit to
[1:27:24] your husband's as unto the Lord children
[1:27:26] obey your parents as in the Lord see
[1:27:27] it's all the same wherever you are in
[1:27:30] your position in life you always serve
[1:27:33] that person as if that person is the
[1:27:35] Lord that creates humility in you not
[1:27:41] with eyeservice as men pleasers see
[1:27:43] you're not trying to impress your your
[1:27:45] master just so you get the glory but as
[1:27:48] the servants of Christ doing the will of
[1:27:50] God from the heart so you're not doing
[1:27:51] this for any other motive I'm not
[1:27:53] submitting to my boss for any other
[1:27:55] reason other than I want to please God
[1:27:57] in my heart I want my boss to look at me
[1:28:01] and say there's a real good worker he's
[1:28:02] got to be a Christian now like oh I need
[1:28:06] to promote him and he needs to be oh
[1:28:08] yeah maybe he's make more money no
[1:28:10] that's that no we serve so they can look
[1:28:14] and say wow there's a real humble
[1:28:15] servant they must be a believer there is
[1:28:17] something different about them they do
[1:28:19] it on it for God's will not for their
[1:28:22] own not for any fleshly desires or wills
[1:28:25] verse 7 with good will doing service as
[1:28:28] to the Lord and not to men knowing that
[1:28:31] whatsoever good thing any man doeth the
[1:28:33] same shall he receive of the Lord a man
[1:28:35] praise God whether he be bond or free so
[1:28:39] see God even looks at servants and
[1:28:40] slaves and says if you do good good will
[1:28:43] come back to you so see church there's
[1:28:46] always that law of reaping and sowing
[1:28:48] it's everywhere if you plant good seeds
[1:28:51] you're gonna read good things praise God
[1:28:53] because you're doing it for God you're
[1:28:55] doing it for
[1:28:56] God's glory praise God not for your
[1:28:58] glory but for God's glory
[1:29:01] anything you do you'll receive back good
[1:29:04] from the Lord verse 9 and he masters do
[1:29:08] the same things unto them for bearing
[1:29:10] threatning so you don't threaten them
[1:29:11] like oh I'm gonna kill you now they
[1:29:12] could brother they men they can threat
[1:29:14] and say I'm gonna take your life I'll
[1:29:15] beat you to death I'll have my other
[1:29:17] servants beat they could do that but
[1:29:19] Paul said don't you know don't threaten
[1:29:20] their lives
[1:29:22] don't try to motivate them by fear
[1:29:25] motivate them by love knowing that your
[1:29:30] master see look he says oh you think
[1:29:32] you're so big you're a master you got
[1:29:33] slaves listen you're a slave to the
[1:29:35] Heavenly Father you got a master over
[1:29:38] you master right like husbands you got a
[1:29:42] husband over you right you rulers in the
[1:29:45] home you got a ruler over you don't
[1:29:48] forget there's somebody higher than you
[1:29:50] and he's also in heaven neither is there
[1:29:53] respect to persons with him so see God
[1:29:55] doesn't respect the master more than the
[1:29:58] slave but right but he expects the
[1:30:02] master to be faithful to God he expects
[1:30:05] him to lead with the leadership and the
[1:30:07] love of God praise God so see that I
[1:30:13] think it's really beautiful they put
[1:30:14] that in there see the founding fathers
[1:30:16] and Paul both knew there was a time in
[1:30:18] season for freedom there was a time in
[1:30:19] season came under Abraham Lincoln Paul's
[1:30:22] not condoning slavery Paul's emphasizing
[1:30:25] this brotherhood between masters and
[1:30:26] servants and the heavenly law makes all
[1:30:30] men equal praise God God makes some rich
[1:30:34] and some poor we don't that I preached
[1:30:36] that to you before but I could preach it
[1:30:37] again God makes some of us rich and God
[1:30:40] makes some of us poor remember God made
[1:30:42] Mary and Joseph poor he made them poor
[1:30:44] and he sent his son the greatest
[1:30:46] behavior of all babies my he sent his
[1:30:49] holy perfect son into the one of the
[1:30:51] poorest homes not the richest God made
[1:30:55] him poor I don't know
[1:30:58] there must been part of it the testimony
[1:31:00] maybe test Mary's faith like mother man
[1:31:03] and preach maybe it's that Mary's faith
[1:31:04] be done to me according to your word I'm
[1:31:06] poor Lord but a angel visited me all's I
[1:31:10] can do is trust in you
[1:31:11] I'll believe your word be it unto me
[1:31:12] according to your word I'm not trusting
[1:31:14] to riches because I don't have any
[1:31:16] praise God I just got the riches of your
[1:31:18] promise amen the Bible said the poor of
[1:31:22] this world rich in faith I think that's
[1:31:26] how it is the poor we are the more faith
[1:31:28] we have because we've got to have it
[1:31:30] that's true all right now I'm trying to
[1:31:35] try to get here this is kind of where
[1:31:38] one to go here by the grace of God okay
[1:31:41] now I'm preaching about an hour right
[1:31:43] now so let me let me set a timer here
[1:31:45] just so I'm just I'm aware I might go a
[1:31:48] little longer we'll see now I preach on
[1:31:50] this a little bit before let me go back
[1:31:52] five of these pieces are defensive
[1:31:57] they'll defend us right and one of them
[1:32:01] is offensive so we have five things by
[1:32:05] the Amen that will defend us they'll
[1:32:06] protect us if we put them on hey if we
[1:32:10] put these five things on they will
[1:32:12] protect us when when attacked praise God
[1:32:16] and only one of them is to be used as a
[1:32:20] weapon against the enemy now all of
[1:32:26] these are put on with prayer because
[1:32:29] verse 18 cent says praying always with
[1:32:32] all prayer and supplication the spirit
[1:32:34] and watching thereunto with all
[1:32:36] perseverance and supplication for All
[1:32:39] Saints amen always all all whereas we
[1:32:43] constantly pray we make we keep our
[1:32:45] armor on we keep ourselves protected we
[1:32:48] keep our defense up praise God as we
[1:32:50] pray all throughout the day amen
[1:32:52] that's how we keep these these defense
[1:32:56] mechanisms on now three
[1:33:00] time Paul says just stand soldier just
[1:33:04] stand he says it in verse 11 13 and 14
[1:33:09] I'm gonna read that put you on the whole
[1:33:11] armour of God that you may beware this
[1:33:17] tricks are coming stand against them
[1:33:19] verse 13 wherefore take unto you the
[1:33:22] whole armour of God that you may able to
[1:33:24] withstand in the in the evil day and
[1:33:27] having done all to stand there's
[1:33:29] something about standing amen something
[1:33:32] about standing up and what you show your
[1:33:34] real size when you stand up all right
[1:33:37] you ever seen somebody sitting down and
[1:33:38] they look kind of small but when they
[1:33:39] stand up well he's pretty big he's a
[1:33:41] pretty big guy there can you see they're
[1:33:45] ready that you see their real size and
[1:33:47] you see what they can do and they're
[1:33:49] ready to move right so standing three
[1:33:52] times is we must stand against the enemy
[1:33:55] three times we're not retreating we're
[1:34:00] not sitting down we're not we're not
[1:34:03] laying down or we're sleeping right the
[1:34:05] Bible says awake from your sleep right
[1:34:07] you wise virgins oh wait
[1:34:09] praise God be awake it's the daytime for
[1:34:12] us praise God and we do not retreat
[1:34:16] because we're standing ready to fight
[1:34:19] stand means to make firm establish to
[1:34:22] cause a person to keep us place you keep
[1:34:24] your place let's not lose what God has
[1:34:28] given to us you know I see that many
[1:34:29] times don't you with Christians they
[1:34:31] lose their testimony they'll lose their
[1:34:34] health and get sick because of their own
[1:34:36] choices right they'll lose I've seen
[1:34:39] this as I told you last week I've seen
[1:34:41] people lose their position in the church
[1:34:43] whether it's a deacon or a pastor a
[1:34:45] preacher or teacher they'll lose their
[1:34:47] predicts their position because they
[1:34:49] compromised on God's Word right that's
[1:34:53] what it means when you stand you keep
[1:34:55] your position praise God
[1:34:57] amen but if you don't stand you'll lose
[1:35:02] what God has given to you a lot of
[1:35:04] people lose their testimony
[1:35:06] oh they usual thing
[1:35:09] that person such a dedicated Saint Maya
[1:35:11] they love the Lord and then they make
[1:35:13] some evil decisions what happened they
[1:35:15] took off the armor they laid the armor
[1:35:17] down they took off the armor and they're
[1:35:20] not standing anymore they lost their
[1:35:21] place they lost their position I don't
[1:35:26] want that to be my testimony I want to
[1:35:28] stand in my position praise God I want
[1:35:30] to hold my place where God's called me
[1:35:33] to a place let me hold it praise God
[1:35:35] if God's giving me land let me possess
[1:35:37] the land praise God amen
[1:35:39] three times he said hold the land hold
[1:35:42] your place hold your position don't lose
[1:35:44] it
[1:35:45] stand there as a real soldier of Christ
[1:35:47] hey man I'll say like this I'll stand
[1:35:52] from one thus saith the Lord to the next
[1:35:55] like the last time I wonder if I should
[1:35:58] be a pastor I said God you sent me
[1:36:00] someone that my ministry saves in the
[1:36:02] message and God said amen and hooah I'm
[1:36:03] standing on that praise God I was going
[1:36:07] to go off and be an evangelist but I
[1:36:09] said Lord if you give me this
[1:36:11] I'll stand there praise God amen and
[1:36:14] I've stood there praise the Lord
[1:36:15] because I only want to do what God wants
[1:36:18] me to do and if God would think it's so
[1:36:21] great to come out of heaven and answer
[1:36:23] my little prayer then let me be faithful
[1:36:26] with my end amen in other words let me
[1:36:29] keep my word because I know he's going
[1:36:31] to keep his word praise God
[1:36:33] Stanzi find your position you're your
[1:36:36] escape from safety keep your authority
[1:36:40] that God has given you as a Christian
[1:36:43] hallelujah thank the Lord you know let
[1:36:48] me just
[1:36:49] real quick this week I put out that not
[1:36:51] every word brother Ram said is done said
[1:36:54] Lord it's my number one video out of the
[1:36:55] last two years it's really skyrocket in
[1:36:58] some ninth phrase to the hard but you
[1:36:59] know what a man from Romania found it
[1:37:02] and you said brother Jesse he said I'm
[1:37:03] from Romania
[1:37:04] he said we're the only message Church in
[1:37:07] our city that doesn't believe every word
[1:37:11] brother Branham said was thus saith the
[1:37:12] Lord he said this video was such a
[1:37:14] blessing he said can I have all those
[1:37:15] quotes so I'm going to share him with
[1:37:17] our little small church he said I just
[1:37:20] want to encourage you well Jesse keep
[1:37:21] making those videos
[1:37:22] he said God visits with us he said God
[1:37:24] is doing signs wonders and miracles in
[1:37:26] our little home Church in Romania
[1:37:28] so the God had to send our from our
[1:37:31] little tiny church God had to send the
[1:37:34] truth over the Internet through the
[1:37:35] satellite to this little tiny church in
[1:37:37] Romania and it's the only church that's
[1:37:40] holding forth the real truth of God
[1:37:41] brother Rams not God he's a prophet he's
[1:37:45] a man he makes mistakes and see I love
[1:37:48] how God's use in one small church to go
[1:37:50] across the globe to help out another
[1:37:52] small carriage amen
[1:37:54] keeping our position praise God amen
[1:37:57] standing up for the truth keeping the
[1:38:00] Word of God pure refreshing amen to the
[1:38:03] saints of God that really encouraged me
[1:38:06] this week
[1:38:08] what is it taking on the full armor of
[1:38:11] God praise the Lord
[1:38:14] authority now here's the picture this is
[1:38:18] a beautiful picture this is from that
[1:38:19] video I get some of my historical truths
[1:38:21] from but the Bible says we put on the
[1:38:23] full armor of God this is how Paul ends
[1:38:25] the letter and you know I never realized
[1:38:28] this but you know where he got you know
[1:38:29] where Paul got the armor of God he got
[1:38:32] it from Isaiah I didn't realize this and
[1:38:35] Isaiah was writing about a certain
[1:38:37] soldier so let's read about it he's
[1:38:41] right about a special soldier who's got
[1:38:45] a Isaiah 11 verse 1 I never knew this I
[1:38:50] thought well praise the Lord what a
[1:38:51] blessing why would he write about a
[1:38:54] soldier Isaiah 11:1
[1:39:03] and there shall come forth a rod out of
[1:39:08] the stem of Jesse and a branch shall
[1:39:11] grow out of his roots a man this is 900
[1:39:15] years before Christ would come from the
[1:39:18] seed of David amen who's he writing
[1:39:21] about he's writing about Christ and the
[1:39:24] Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him
[1:39:26] and the spirit of wisdom and
[1:39:28] understanding in the spirit of counsel
[1:39:29] might the spirit of knowledge and of the
[1:39:31] fear of the Lord and shall make him of
[1:39:36] quick understanding in the fear of the
[1:39:37] Lord and he shall not judge after the
[1:39:39] sight of his eyes neither reprove after
[1:39:41] the hearing of his ears but with
[1:39:42] righteousness shall he judged the poor
[1:39:44] reap you've that
[1:39:45] reprove with equity for the meek of the
[1:39:46] earth he shall smite the earth with the
[1:39:48] rod of his mouth and with the breath of
[1:39:50] his lips shall he slay the wicked and
[1:39:52] righteousness shall be the girdle of his
[1:39:54] loins and faithfulness the girdle of his
[1:39:57] reigns amen
[1:39:59] so about righteousness and girdles he's
[1:40:02] talking about smiting things he he's
[1:40:04] talking about a mighty warrior by the
[1:40:06] name of Jesus Christ amen praise God
[1:40:09] we're to Paul get this imagery from no
[1:40:11] doubt he saw Roman soldiers but then the
[1:40:13] Holy Spirit said oh that's just a copy
[1:40:15] that's a that's a copy off the real
[1:40:18] soldier the Messiah Jesus Christ praise
[1:40:21] God Jesus had on the righteousness the
[1:40:25] girdle of his loins the belt of truth
[1:40:29] hey yeah and he smite him with the words
[1:40:32] that coming out of his mouth that
[1:40:33] reminds us of Revelation 19 now we're
[1:40:37] not going to read Isaiah 49 but that's
[1:40:39] Isaiah said the words gonna come out of
[1:40:41] my mouth like a sword so just so you
[1:40:42] know that's where that comes from Isaiah
[1:40:45] said my word is like a sword now here's
[1:40:48] the Messiah
[1:40:48] go to Psalm or Isaiah 59 what a blessing
[1:40:55] praise God what a bless and where does
[1:40:56] Paul get this from the Holy Spirit the
[1:40:59] Holy Spirit already foretold this is how
[1:41:01] Christ is so Christ is the great mighty
[1:41:03] Conqueror and he's saying we can be
[1:41:05] conquers as well with the same weapons
[1:41:08] ain't man now I've never weapon the same
[1:41:11] weapons at Christ's head
[1:41:13] Isaiah 59 now verse 17 declares its the
[1:41:20] Messiah no it's the helmet of salvation
[1:41:22] yeah verse 17 for he put on
[1:41:26] righteousness as a breastplate and a
[1:41:29] helmet of salvation upon his head and he
[1:41:31] put on the garments of vengeance for
[1:41:33] clothing and was clad with zeal as a
[1:41:36] cloak remember the vows of the zeal of
[1:41:38] the Lord have eaten him up praise God
[1:41:41] they saw Jesus as zeal cleaning out the
[1:41:43] church right yet not the money changers
[1:41:45] and all the greedy covetous thieves and
[1:41:48] there he whipped them out so his
[1:41:51] character his anointing upon him was
[1:41:53] like armor for a soldier now verse 20
[1:41:58] says its Messiah and the Redeemer shall
[1:42:01] come to Zion and under them that turn
[1:42:03] from righteousness I'm sorry that turn
[1:42:05] from transgression and Jacob saith the
[1:42:08] Lord praise God and as for me this is my
[1:42:10] covenant with them saith the Lord my
[1:42:12] spirit that is upon thee in my words
[1:42:14] which I putting in thy mouth show not
[1:42:16] the part of thy mouth nor out of the
[1:42:18] mouth of thy seed now the mouth of thy
[1:42:20] seed seed saith the Lord from henceforth
[1:42:22] and forever praise God so I'm teaching
[1:42:24] Lydia and Malachi to quote God's Word so
[1:42:27] that if God terry's and they have
[1:42:28] children you have to teach your children
[1:42:30] to quote God's Word praise God
[1:42:33] your seed and your seed seed praise God
[1:42:37] that's your purpose in life is to teach
[1:42:40] your children to fight the enemy with
[1:42:42] God's Word to be dressed up with the
[1:42:45] armor of God amen
[1:42:46] how does it go on by prayer praise God
[1:42:49] goes on by prayer so where does he get
[1:42:51] where does Paul get this idea of a
[1:42:53] soldier he gets it from prophecies of
[1:42:55] the Messiah his first and second coming
[1:42:59] amen praise God praise God first and
[1:43:03] second coming where am I at

[1:43:22] right there praise God where does he get
[1:43:24] it who is the real soldier we're looking
[1:43:26] to we're looking
[1:43:26] Jesus Christ Paul didn't just make this
[1:43:30] up
[1:43:30] he saw Isaiah writing about it he saw
[1:43:32] Isaiah prophesy about it he said that's
[1:43:35] how every Christian should be praise God
