[24:55] you know just
[24:57] right off the road on the highway

[26:19] i said
[26:23] get me home
[26:25] and i said by faith i'm going to claim
[26:30] and while i was going up the ramp
[26:33] to get on i-77 here
[26:36] the car really sounded bad
[26:39] at one one time it went like this like
[26:42] the wind took it and there was no way
[26:47] and
[26:49] i was praying
[26:52] and you know what
[26:56] when i got to near here

[27:06] i said
[27:08] and i believe
[27:09] it's going to be all right
[27:11] just thinking about this right here
[27:13] and the work here
[27:17] i said
[27:18] it'll be all right
[27:22] you know after that
[27:24] when i got near fair long
[27:27] the car seemed like it went
[27:30] like automatic pilots
[27:34] amen
[27:36] car stopped making noise
[27:39] took me all the way home
[27:41] i called the mechanic

[27:46] he checked it he asked me what was wrong
[27:51] and when i called him up sunday because

[27:57] hours that was at 10 o'clock

[28:04] i called him saturday night
[28:06] he said i called you i said well my

[28:12] and maybe i didn't get the call he said
[28:14] well i him he said the car's done
[28:18] and he says
[28:20] not in vain because he don't
[28:23] understand
[28:24] about using the name of the lord
[28:26] like
[28:27] in uselessness
[28:31] but when he said it
[28:34] it wasn't
[28:37] that way
[28:38] it was the lord speaking to me
[28:41] it was jesus christ
[28:43] he said jesus christ
[28:46] he sent that car he said when i took off
[28:49] the wheels
[28:50] he said everything

[43:06] revelation 3 20.

[43:22] confirmations of god's word
[43:25] just encouragement praise god revelation

[43:58] thought of it lord that you'd like to
[44:00] quicken to our hearts tonight i prepared
[44:02] and i kind of feel the direction i i
[44:05] think we should go the lord you can
[44:07] change it at any time and we just want
[44:09] to be led by your holy spirit encourage
[44:12] strength and know god and deeper
[44:13] understanding growing in grace and
[44:15] knowledge of you and lord a great
[44:17] appreciation and thanksgiving for all
[44:19] you've done lord as we've seen tonight
[44:22] you give and take away lord you've taken
[44:24] away a wonderful saint our sister mary
[44:26] lord god and the lord you give also lord
[44:29] god and we thank you for the eternal
[44:31] blessings no doubt she's enjoying right
[44:33] now so lord help us to set our
[44:35] affections on things above where our
[44:36] sister has been called home
[44:39] father help us to serve faithfully here
[44:41] now we pray in jesus christ's name and
[44:43] the church said
[44:45] amen god bless you being seated praise
[44:46] god
[44:57] so lord willing um
[45:01] i do have just a few
[45:03] so i don't have a whole lot um as far as
[45:05] new things to show
[45:07] but uh in case you want to switch over
[45:08] there would like to just show a few
[45:10] things just kind of keeps me organized
[45:13] so ephesians
[45:15] 5 verse 1.
[45:20] and so i i just i want to update you a
[45:22] little bit i got those emails returned
[45:25] about the jeffersonville video so um
[45:28] the side that was on
[45:30] jeffersonville side never emailed me
[45:31] back
[45:32] i spent lots of time writing them and
[45:34] they never even back that's okay
[45:37] um the side that was kind of with me but
[45:39] still believes joseph's a prophet which
[45:40] is okay they can believe that he's
[45:42] emailed me back numerous times he's
[45:43] actually from south america and i gave
[45:45] him all these quotes he was very
[45:46] thankful for helped him out a lot
[45:48] to understand how brother you have to
[45:50] separate bill graham's opinions from the
[45:51] word and i got a text from a brother in
[45:54] lima just saying uh he said my family
[45:56] and i have talked about the same things
[45:57] you put on the video for years and he
[45:59] said you hit that uh nail right on the
[46:02] head
[46:03] so it was encouraging to hear that just
[46:04] you know i know that family's testimony
[46:06] and
[46:06] and to see how god has saved each one of
[46:09] them and their family and
[46:11] god's done great things they're just
[46:12] encouraging so we're thankful and uh as
[46:15] i told the one brother i said i try not
[46:17] to call names on that video
[46:19] but the reason i did it was because
[46:21] there was
[46:22] those people influence millions
[46:25] uh
[46:26] and they're influencing them some things
[46:28] the wrong way so we have to be a voice
[46:30] to try to correct it at least let our
[46:32] voice be heard
[46:34] and and it's done with love
[46:36] and the family even one of the family
[46:37] members said it was done with love so i
[46:39] thank the lord for that
[46:40] so even even those that we're we're
[46:42] trying to help can admit we love them
[46:44] praise god what greater testimony could
[46:46] you have
[46:47] that your own people that are against
[46:49] you tell you that you they feel loved by
[46:52] you
[46:53] i don't know what other better testimony
[46:55] we could have
[46:56] that's what brother brown said if you if
[46:58] you can't love somebody you'll never
[47:00] help them if you're trying to correct
[47:01] them unless they can feel that you love
[47:03] them first
[47:04] so that was a great encouragement to me
[47:06] and i just want to be thankful and keep
[47:08] doing what the lord is leading us to do
[47:10] by god's grace
[47:13] uh so now we let's look to the word here
[47:15] now we're on our third theme
[47:18] the walk and the warfare the believer
[47:20] that's how schofield divides it up there
[47:23] we're on the walk in the warfare
[47:26] so we're seeing how to walk now in
[47:28] chapter four begins the walk four verse
[47:31] one and then it begins with the unity of
[47:32] the faith goes into the five full
[47:34] ministry and chapter four ended with
[47:36] that great illustration
[47:38] of i think i'll just put it back up
[47:40] there again
[47:41] that great illustration
[47:44] of paul saying
[47:45] he said we've got to put on the new man
[47:48] and he likens it under like putting on
[47:49] clothes
[47:50] he see we've got to take off the old man
[47:52] and he's talking to churches that have
[47:54] holy ghost-filled saints in them sure
[47:56] and how do you know because even brother
[47:57] brown lied a couple times you know so if
[48:00] he was filled with the holy ghost no
[48:01] doubt he was
[48:02] and he and paul's encouraging them not
[48:05] to lie then these are sins that we could
[48:08] uh possibly
[48:10] uh go through and experience
[48:12] uh and we but we got to learn to repent
[48:15] take off the old man get a transformed
[48:17] mind and put on the new man now i didn't
[48:20] make this a picture here but personally
[48:22] i don't believe you can fornicate and be
[48:25] born again so i didn't make this just so
[48:27] you know
[48:28] i don't believe you can fornicate and be
[48:30] filled with the holy ghost
[48:32] i don't believe you can commit adultery
[48:34] and be born again i don't believe you
[48:36] can get drunk and be born again
[48:38] okay that's just my opinion that that's
[48:40] i believe there's a scripture for that
[48:42] um
[48:43] because paul says fornicators will not
[48:45] inherit the kingdom of god well how can
[48:47] you be a fornicator and be born again
[48:49] into the kingdom of god that's the whole
[48:51] point of the kingdom of god is to get
[48:52] you into it
[48:54] born into it praise god
[48:56] so that's because these are later in the
[48:59] next chapter remember church these are
[49:00] not in chapter 4
[49:02] right here
[49:03] these are in chapter 5 later on
[49:06] so i'm just putting that up there as a
[49:07] visual so he ends the the chapter 4
[49:12] dealing with how christians
[49:14] can grieve the holy spirit praise god
[49:17] and we don't want to do that we don't
[49:18] want to grieve the holy spirit that
[49:19] means offend
[49:21] or to make sad or make sorrowful we
[49:23] don't want to make the holy spirit
[49:25] sorrowful
[49:26] right but we know if we do god is
[49:28] merciful he's quick to forgive us if we
[49:30] repent praise god
[49:32] now
[49:34] chapter 5
[49:36] uh one and two we kind of looked at on
[49:38] sunday night we must imitate god
[49:41] uh we must follow god
[49:43] as dear children
[49:45] and then we walk in love in verse 2 as
[49:47] christ has loved us and has given us
[49:50] himself for an offering and a sweet
[49:52] smelling sacrifice to god for a uh i'm
[49:55] sorry sacrifice to god for a sweet
[49:57] smelling
[49:58] savor so that gives the illustration as
[50:00] we looked at
[50:01] paul in romans 12 to lay ourselves
[50:04] present your bodies as a living
[50:06] sacrifice unto god
[50:07] and we must put ourselves on the altar
[50:10] of god praise the lord every day we must
[50:12] do it we must get a transformed mind and
[50:15] do it daily praise god
[50:17] lay ourselves on god's altar if we want
[50:20] to imitate god if we want to be like
[50:22] christ the only way is to put on the
[50:24] mind of christ praise god
[50:27] now verse 3 i just like this thought i'm
[50:29] just going to just uh i'm going to just
[50:31] emphasize this thought just for a few
[50:33] moments here
[50:34] uh in verse 3.
[50:36] but fornication now see
[50:38] i believe these are some of the things
[50:40] that should never happen amongst us
[50:42] before an occasion which is uh sexual
[50:44] activity before marriage and all
[50:46] uncleanness and covetousness
[50:48] let it not be once
[50:51] named among you
[50:52] as become a saints remember paul
[50:55] speaking to ephesians who live in the
[50:57] second greatest city outside of rome at
[50:59] that time
[51:00] the most prosperous outside of rome
[51:03] uh has the most female gods or goddesses
[51:07] rather and gods and temples and sports
[51:10] and
[51:10] drunkenness and revelry he's talking to
[51:13] the most
[51:14] the second most popular place to be with
[51:17] filled with temptations and he said
[51:19] don't let your little group your little
[51:22] flock
[51:24] even have once named or somebody
[51:26] committing a sexual acts before marriage
[51:29] don't let it be once named among you
[51:31] praise god
[51:33] don't let uncleanness or covetousness be
[51:37] named amongst that real bride of christ
[51:39] church right
[51:41] as become a saints
[51:43] now the thought when i read this you
[51:45] know it kind of came to me uh
[51:47] we must
[51:48] be pure 100 of the time
[51:53] right
[51:54] satan's got access to our minds he'll
[51:56] make us stumble on our minds and we'll
[51:57] do things in our minds that aren't
[51:59] pleasing to god
[52:01] but at some point the holy spirit is
[52:03] given to us to keep us from doing these
[52:06] things
[52:08] this case fornication
[52:10] and all uncleanness and covetousness
[52:14] it shouldn't be named one time
[52:16] so all the people that know us and know
[52:18] about our church and our friends they
[52:20] should never hear about someone at bride
[52:22] of christ fellowship committing
[52:23] fornication or adultery
[52:26] right
[52:27] if we're living true to god and if we
[52:30] are uh
[52:31] if we are renewing our minds daily
[52:33] praise god then we should live above
[52:36] these sins
[52:37] i'm talking about the ones he named here
[52:39] fornication uncleanness
[52:41] covetousness
[52:43] he said and not let it not be once named
[52:46] among you
[52:48] and church this made me think of the
[52:50] scripture where paul said in second
[52:52] corinthians 7
[52:53] he said let us labor he said to perfect
[52:56] holiness in the fear of god
[53:00] and it's a constant
[53:01] our lives should be a constant drawing
[53:03] closer to god we should be getting a
[53:06] more understanding of god we should be
[53:08] more faithful to god
[53:10] we should be coming more like god
[53:13] because we fear god
[53:18] so god is asking for perfection paul's
[53:21] saying god wants you to be perfect on
[53:23] these things
[53:25] don't let fornication be once named
[53:27] among you
[53:29] remember how paul didn't paul rebuke him
[53:31] in 1st corinthians 5 he said there's a
[53:33] man who's committing fornication with
[53:35] his stepmother
[53:36] he said and some of you he said none of
[53:38] you are even mourning about it
[53:41] he said because you're puffed up
[53:43] he said get that leaven out of the
[53:45] church amen
[53:46] he had to rebuke him
[53:50] so it was named amongst so fornication
[53:53] was named amongst the corinthians but
[53:56] paul tells these ephesians he said don't
[53:58] let it be once named among you
[54:02] and then that thought came to me saints
[54:05] from the church age book brother says
[54:06] when the church of jesus christ knows
[54:08] who she is
[54:10] she's an invincible army praise god when
[54:13] she gets a revelation of who she is
[54:16] she'll be an invincible army praise god
[54:18] now i believe that's future tense but i
[54:20] also believe that's present tense for
[54:23] every christian who's born again
[54:25] amen
[54:26] praise god i don't believe that's just
[54:29] for the saints who are alive at the
[54:31] rapture i believe any saint of god like
[54:34] paul he was invincible who's going to
[54:37] stop him from fulfilling god's will for
[54:39] his life amen who is going to stop peter
[54:42] from
[54:43] doing and for feeding jesus's lambs amen
[54:46] hallelujah who is going to stop john
[54:49] from getting the aleppatmos and
[54:51] receiving the the revelation of
[54:53] revelation writing it down and sending
[54:55] it off to the churches who could defend
[54:56] that who could stop that it was
[54:58] invincible praise god
[55:00] and so i believe that's what paul is
[55:02] saying the same idea that christians
[55:04] that are really born again really sold
[55:06] out these type of things should not be
[55:08] named once among them
[55:14] because the holy ghost is power that's
[55:16] the whole point of the holy spirit right
[55:18] was to give us inward power
[55:20] hallelujah jesus said when you receive
[55:22] the holy ghost he said you'll be endued
[55:24] with power from on high dunamis right
[55:28] dynamite amen strong power praise god to
[55:32] overcome satan's temptations amen
[55:36] so not named once
[55:43] that's what we must strive for
[55:46] that's the church's desire is to live so
[55:49] close to god
[55:51] that we don't even have it once named
[55:53] among us
[55:54] now how many churches you know that have
[55:56] sexual abuse named among them
[55:59] adulteries
[56:00] named among them
[56:02] we should strive to not have it named
[56:05] once among us
[56:07] praise god
[56:09] that should be our desire to take sin
[56:11] seriously and i believe this church i
[56:13] believe like brother brahm said
[56:14] i believe uh the days of ananias and
[56:16] sapphira can return
[56:19] not just right before the rapture but
[56:20] they can be here now
[56:22] where brother says we love god so much
[56:24] and we hate sin so much that we're
[56:26] praying every service lord don't let
[56:28] sinners come in here
[56:30] uh unless they're going to repent praise
[56:32] god
[56:33] because spirits follow people praise god
[56:37] right
[56:38] and so lord if a sinner does come in
[56:40] here may they get convicted and may they
[56:42] repent and may the spear those evil
[56:45] spirits be cast away from them praise
[56:47] god amen
[56:49] hallelujah
[56:51] and i believe god has protected us that
[56:52] way
[56:53] i've told you over the years church
[56:54] we've seen some people come and go and
[56:56] i've told you testimonies after some of
[56:58] them have left that god is keeping the
[57:00] church clean
[57:02] either from false doctrine or criticism
[57:04] or other things of
[57:06] other sins that have been in people's
[57:08] lives and god has been merciful to us
[57:12] he's not letting these things be named
[57:14] once among us praise god
[57:16] and that's what we should strive to do
[57:18] is live
[57:20] uh so pleasing to god
[57:22] that we could be invincible as far as
[57:24] god keeping us from major sins
[57:27] amen because we saw on sunday paul said
[57:29] sometimes in my mind i get taken into
[57:32] captivity in the in my mind
[57:35] and he says oh wretched man that i am in
[57:38] his mind but paul wasn't out there
[57:40] fornicating like samson
[57:42] right he wasn't out there getting
[57:44] prostitutes like samson or judah you
[57:45] know he wasn't out there doing that
[57:48] he but in his mind saints in his mind he
[57:51] struggled and he had mind battles and he
[57:54] he became a slave in his mind
[57:56] but he knew he said thank god through
[57:59] jesus christ our lord that i get the
[58:01] victory praise god and he's going to
[58:03] give me a new body amen
[58:05] hallelujah we should try to not have
[58:08] these things once named among us
[58:10] because fornication was rampant in
[58:13] ephesus
[58:14] right
[58:15] a lot of the if you go back and study
[58:18] like even holidays like valentine's day
[58:21] because we watch the videos at our
[58:22] school we're allowed to watch these
[58:23] videos
[58:24] valentine's day you know what they did
[58:25] in rome on valentine's day
[58:28] men and women would just come and all
[58:29] their names of being a little a bull and
[58:31] they would just pull
[58:32] names
[58:34] my children in first grade watch it they
[58:36] pull names and they spend the weekend of
[58:38] valentine with that woman or man just
[58:41] random
[58:42] to see if it would be that's from rome
[58:45] that's and and so that's what paul this
[58:47] is kind of the culture around them where
[58:50] love is uh
[58:51] love is sinful you know their love is
[58:53] sinful it's all lust
[58:55] and paul's saying don't let that be
[58:57] among us we're saints keep your body
[58:59] holy and pure imitate god amen
[59:02] follow god
[59:05] as dear children
[59:09] he said go to perfection perfect
[59:11] holiness in the fear of god
[59:18] i like knowing the context of these
[59:19] letters don't you
[59:21] i love to see the context because it
[59:22] makes it more real like these things are
[59:25] eternal letters
[59:27] they apply to our generation just like
[59:28] they did to that day
[59:31] not named once he says don't let it be
[59:34] named once
[59:35] so keep away from these sins 100 of the
[59:38] time amen
[59:40] now let me i forgot to read this the
[59:42] greek word for uncleanness is impurity
[59:45] physical or moral uncleanness
[59:49] and then covetousness is greediness
[59:52] he said don't let it be named once among
[59:54] you as becometh saints praise god so
[59:57] what are we striving after we are
[59:59] striving after a church that keeps its
[1:00:01] body and mind under subjection
[1:00:05] and the there's only sins that are
[1:00:07] visible like this there's no visible
[1:00:09] sins we keep all of our sins maybe up
[1:00:12] here praise god i know it's hard right
[1:00:15] but we want to live where uh most of our
[1:00:18] sins are only done up here and they're
[1:00:19] not actually acted out
[1:00:21] amen like fornication uncleanness
[1:00:24] greediness right all these things he
[1:00:26] listed
[1:00:28] and that's why we can come to church we
[1:00:30] can raise our hands and sing and cry i
[1:00:32] can cry tears of joy because god's mercy
[1:00:36] his mercy is more amen hallelujah i can
[1:00:39] praise the lord
[1:00:41] because church we live we should live
[1:00:43] such a pure life publicly
[1:00:46] and if that's the case if we're living
[1:00:48] such a pure life publicly then our
[1:00:50] biggest battles will be in our mind
[1:00:53] and that's where we see ourselves fail
[1:00:55] sometimes
[1:00:57] can anybody relate to me about that
[1:01:00] our biggest failures should actually be
[1:01:02] in our minds
[1:01:04] and not so much outwardly
[1:01:07] right
[1:01:08] like these type of sins
[1:01:11] i believe that
[1:01:14] now look at verse 4.
[1:01:17] i like this verse this is good
[1:01:19] now i name some other sins neither let
[1:01:22] filthiness which is obscenities
[1:01:25] i'll tell you a lot sometimes christians
[1:01:26] get really close close to cussing don't
[1:01:28] they brother ray
[1:01:32] what i wonder i forgot about i want to
[1:01:33] put up a slide here with with words that
[1:01:35] are close to cuss words to kind of
[1:01:37] educate
[1:01:38] not educate but revelate the people of
[1:01:40] god
[1:01:42] so some words are just really close and
[1:01:44] we shouldn't say them
[1:01:46] right right i don't want to say them
[1:01:48] maybe i'll list them for sunday i'd like
[1:01:49] to maybe go back over that
[1:01:51] we shouldn't even get close to saying
[1:01:53] obscenities or cuss words
[1:01:55] irreverent words
[1:01:57] now foolish talking this is one we got
[1:01:59] to be careful too
[1:02:00] god help me sometimes i'm this foolish
[1:02:02] talking means silliness or buffoonery
[1:02:07] so paul says nor foolish talking nor
[1:02:10] jesting jesting means a vulgar wittiness
[1:02:14] now that's
[1:02:15] people that are kind of witty and smart
[1:02:17] alec we might call them
[1:02:19] so christians should not be smart alex
[1:02:21] right
[1:02:22] right
[1:02:24] being vulgar and saying evil things and
[1:02:26] condemning people hurting people
[1:02:30] he said which are not convenient
[1:02:33] so that they don't build up right we saw
[1:02:35] in chapter four our words are supposed
[1:02:38] to edify people
[1:02:40] our words are supposed to build people
[1:02:41] up
[1:02:43] if we correct them the bible says
[1:02:44] correct your brother in meekness like
[1:02:46] the bible said in galatians chapter 6
[1:02:49] if you see your brother overtaken in a
[1:02:51] fault the bible says go in meekness unto
[1:02:54] that man and he said consider yourself
[1:02:56] lest ye be tempted
[1:02:59] pardon me
[1:03:03] so that's how we do it praise the lord
[1:03:07] we have to correct people
[1:03:09] but we do it with the spirit of meekness
[1:03:11] like i said earlier
[1:03:14] now like this
[1:03:15] it's not convenient to be obscene
[1:03:18] to be silliness and buffoonery and
[1:03:20] vulgar wittiness
[1:03:21] to be a smart aleck
[1:03:24] but what we should do with our words but
[1:03:26] rather the giving of thanks
[1:03:28] amen
[1:03:30] we should always give thanks
[1:03:34] we do i'll say like this we we probably
[1:03:36] do too much joking
[1:03:38] we probably do too much silliness
[1:03:40] we probably uh do too much uh wrath
[1:03:44] right we we need to be giving thanks
[1:03:46] more often
[1:03:48] paul said this is the will of god
[1:03:50] in christ jesus
[1:03:53] praise god
[1:03:57] but rather giving of thanks
[1:03:59] see we should rather it i rather i'd
[1:04:02] rather give thanks than say evil things
[1:04:04] right i'd rather do that right
[1:04:07] that's what we should do praise god
[1:04:10] always give thanks
[1:04:13] the this is what a follower of christ
[1:04:16] does
[1:04:17] give thanks
[1:04:19] praise god with the mind of christ
[1:04:24] now like verse 5 2 verse 5
[1:04:27] this is what i mentioned earlier this is
[1:04:28] why i believe
[1:04:31] god is giving us kingdom boundaries
[1:04:33] there has to be a separation between the
[1:04:35] wise and the foolish
[1:04:37] there has to be
[1:04:38] why would jesus tell the parable
[1:04:41] you know i remember when i was starting
[1:04:42] to believe the sign they don't really
[1:04:44] believe in a foolish version well jesus
[1:04:46] said so
[1:04:48] jesus said there's going to be some that
[1:04:50] are pure physically right or pure
[1:04:53] spiritually but just don't have oil
[1:04:56] there has to be a boundary
[1:04:59] a separation between people that are
[1:05:00] fully sold out and others that are not
[1:05:03] quite all the way sold out
[1:05:06] and so paul i love this paul gives us
[1:05:08] kingdom boundaries amen hallelujah verse
[1:05:11] five for this ye know now look at he
[1:05:13] said you know this
[1:05:16] no whoremonger
[1:05:20] now that means uh
[1:05:22] sexually whoremonger there
[1:05:26] unclean person is which means impure or
[1:05:29] lewd
[1:05:30] covetous man which means eager for gain
[1:05:33] or idolater which is an idol worshiper
[1:05:37] have any inheritance
[1:05:40] he says in the kingdom of christ and his
[1:05:43] god amen in verse 5. that's right
[1:05:48] so paul says you know this
[1:05:50] in other words i've taught the church
[1:05:52] this if you are a whoremonger
[1:05:55] if you are
[1:05:56] not living right if you're unclean if
[1:05:58] you worship false gods if you're greedy
[1:06:01] you have no inheritance in the kingdom
[1:06:04] of god
[1:06:05] amen
[1:06:07] praise god so it gives us great
[1:06:09] boundaries praise the lord
[1:06:12] thank the lord amen
[1:06:14] hallelujah
[1:06:19] now since we're there let me go back
[1:06:20] here now keep your place there i just
[1:06:22] had this thought come go to first
[1:06:24] corinthians 6.
[1:06:27] because a few years ago i preached a
[1:06:28] message you might remember i think i
[1:06:29] preached 23 sins
[1:06:33] that prove people aren't born again i
[1:06:34] don't know if you remember that message
[1:06:36] but i just counted all these times where
[1:06:38] the bible said if you do these things
[1:06:40] you don't have any inheritance in the
[1:06:42] kingdom of god
[1:06:43] so that was clear boundaries that
[1:06:46] someone who lives in these sins without
[1:06:47] repenting is not born again because
[1:06:50] they're not in the kingdom of god jesus
[1:06:51] said unless you're born again you can't
[1:06:53] even understand the kingdom
[1:06:55] amen that's right first corinthians 6 9
[1:06:58] know ye not that the unrighteous should
[1:06:59] not inherit the kingdom of god here it
[1:07:01] is the same idea
[1:07:02] these are people that do these are not
[1:07:04] going to be kings and priests in the
[1:07:06] kingdom of god
[1:07:08] be not deceived neither fornicators
[1:07:10] idolaters adulterers nor effeminate
[1:07:12] effeminate is that's the man who
[1:07:15] molested a child
[1:07:17] that's a child molester
[1:07:19] or a man that kept a child to molest
[1:07:21] physically
[1:07:23] sinfully
[1:07:24] nor abusers of himself with mankind
[1:07:27] that's homosexuality nor thieves nor
[1:07:29] covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor
[1:07:31] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[1:07:34] of god
[1:07:35] amen
[1:07:37] so see paul gives clear boundaries
[1:07:39] there's boundaries if you're in the
[1:07:41] kingdom you won't go past the boundaries
[1:07:44] into these sins why because you've got
[1:07:46] power in you inside of you amen
[1:07:48] you've got the spirit of christ in you
[1:07:50] praise the lord
[1:07:52] verse 11 and such worst of you amen
[1:07:56] were but you are washed you are
[1:07:58] sanctified you're justified in the name
[1:08:00] of the lord jesus and by the spirit of
[1:08:03] our god amen
[1:08:04] hallelujah
[1:08:06] there is hope for the homosexual today
[1:08:09] praise god
[1:08:10] there is hope for the adulterer today
[1:08:13] but it comes by being washed by the
[1:08:15] blood of christ
[1:08:17] i tell you this testimony a few
[1:08:19] months ago brother dennis or dennis
[1:08:20] mcbride from south carolina he's a
[1:08:22] message preacher he started a church and
[1:08:24] they went for about i think 10 years
[1:08:26] well anyways
[1:08:29] and then he stopped he felt let lord
[1:08:30] stop but during the time he was
[1:08:32] pastoring he said god gave him a great
[1:08:34] vindication because before he pastored
[1:08:37] there was a sister in the church and she
[1:08:39] backs it out of his previous church and
[1:08:41] went into a homosexual lifestyle lesbian
[1:08:43] lifestyle
[1:08:45] he said but her testimony was once she
[1:08:47] heard that he became a pastor down in
[1:08:49] south carolina she got encouraged really
[1:08:52] excited she went to his church and
[1:08:54] through a couple of years of preaching
[1:08:56] she got delivered from that lesbian
[1:08:59] spirit came back to god and now she's
[1:09:01] back walking in the truth what happened
[1:09:03] she got washed she got justified she got
[1:09:06] sanctified by the lord jesus and by the
[1:09:08] spirit of our god god's in the business
[1:09:11] of washing but we got to come to the
[1:09:13] pool to be washed amen
[1:09:16] that's a that's not a that's not an 1800
[1:09:18] testimony that's a 2018 or 19 testimony
[1:09:21] praise god
[1:09:23] homosexuals can be washed perverts we'd
[1:09:25] say you know uh could be washed abusers
[1:09:29] could be washed but they've got to come
[1:09:31] to the fountain filled with blood amen
[1:09:34] the guy let the holy spirit wash them
[1:09:37] any man that would abuse a child or any
[1:09:39] woman anyone that would do that is not
[1:09:42] born again
[1:09:43] praise god
[1:09:47] that's what paul says right there you
[1:09:48] got to get washed from this
[1:09:50] he said fornicators mongers have
[1:09:53] no inheritance in the kingdom of god
[1:09:55] they won't rule over anything god can't
[1:09:57] trust him with anything because he can't
[1:09:59] even trust them with their own bodies
[1:10:01] amen if god can't trust you with your
[1:10:03] own body how's he going to trust have
[1:10:05] you uh lead over other bodies
[1:10:08] like the bible said ten cities he said
[1:10:10] if you're faithful with five tails i'll
[1:10:11] make you a ruler over ten cities how are
[1:10:14] you gonna handle 10 cities bodies in 10
[1:10:16] cities when you can't even handle your
[1:10:18] body
[1:10:19] amen is that right
[1:10:22] praise the lord
[1:10:24] it's kingdom boundaries and paul said
[1:10:25] you know this already
[1:10:27] no whoremonger has any inheritance in
[1:10:29] the kingdom of god
[1:10:32] that's right
[1:10:33] now the same thing is said
[1:10:35] over in galatians 5. so let's go there
[1:10:38] it's right in front of ephesians
[1:10:43] kingdom boundaries
[1:10:54] ephesians i'm sorry galatians 5.
[1:10:59] now in verse 16 he said this i say then
[1:11:01] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[1:11:03] fulfill the lust of the flesh put on
[1:11:05] that new coat right put on that new
[1:11:07] garment and you won't walk in the flesh
[1:11:11] amen
[1:11:12] that's right
[1:11:13] for the flesh left this against the
[1:11:15] spirit and the spirit against the flesh
[1:11:17] and these are contrary the one to the
[1:11:19] other so that you cannot do the things
[1:11:21] that you would
[1:11:22] praise god
[1:11:24] but if you be led of the spirit you're
[1:11:25] not under the law
[1:11:28] now the works of the flesh are manifest
[1:11:29] which are these adultery fornication
[1:11:32] uncleanness lasheviousness idolatry
[1:11:35] witchcraft
[1:11:36] hatred variance emulations wrath strife
[1:11:39] seditions heresies now see you got to
[1:11:41] watch people people can live pure
[1:11:43] physically but if they teach heresies
[1:11:46] they're just as lost
[1:11:47] right they're just as
[1:11:50] they're just as
[1:11:51] absent of the holy spirit as someone
[1:11:53] that's committing adultery
[1:11:55] because the heresies like spiritual
[1:11:57] adultery
[1:11:59] right
[1:12:01] see just one of these can keep somebody
[1:12:04] from being born again
[1:12:07] and that's the trouble a lot of people a
[1:12:09] lot of people today want to be born
[1:12:10] again but did they ever go through this
[1:12:11] and actually say lord am i doing any of
[1:12:13] these lord if i am wash me of these
[1:12:16] because if i do these i cannot be a part
[1:12:19] of the kingdom of god but i want to be a
[1:12:21] part of god's kingdom it's the only
[1:12:23] kingdom that will last amen
[1:12:26] all the kingdoms will be shaken and
[1:12:28] destroyed and teared down but there's
[1:12:30] one kingdom that cannot be shaken amen
[1:12:33] and his ruler is a ruler the ruler rules
[1:12:35] with a rod of iron amen
[1:12:37] hallelujah
[1:12:41] glory
[1:12:42] let's go to verse 21 endings murders
[1:12:45] drunkenness revelings and such like of
[1:12:47] the which i tell you before as i've also
[1:12:49] told you in times past that they which
[1:12:51] do such things shall not
[1:12:53] inherit the kingdom of god
[1:12:57] praise god
[1:12:59] see these are kingdom boundaries people
[1:13:02] you cannot do these and be born again
[1:13:06] because jesus said when you got the holy
[1:13:07] ghost now you see the kingdom of god
[1:13:10] now you're a part of the kingdom of god
[1:13:12] because he said the kingdom of god is
[1:13:13] within you amen
[1:13:15] that's right praise the lord
[1:13:17] thank the lord
[1:13:19] now i got one more on my mind let's just
[1:13:21] review this one real quick go to
[1:13:22] revelation 21
[1:13:26] it just kind of came to me real quick
[1:13:27] again
[1:13:33] now could those people be saved yes the
[1:13:35] thief on the cross he was up there he
[1:13:37] was saved but he was a murderer right
[1:13:40] that's why he was condemned
[1:13:42] but yet he was saved because he repented
[1:13:45] so all those people that commit these
[1:13:47] acts can be saved but they got to repent
[1:13:52] but if they don't
[1:13:53] then scripture says what happens to them
[1:13:59] all right now revelation
[1:14:00] 21.
[1:14:06] now i'm just going on my memory here
[1:14:08] yeah verse 27 21-27
[1:14:17] and there shall no eyes enter into it
[1:14:19] anything that defileth neither worketh
[1:14:21] abomination or maketh the lie but they
[1:14:24] which are written in the lamb's book of
[1:14:26] life praise god
[1:14:32] now actually yeah i'll also go to verse
[1:14:34] 8 21 verse 8 that's the one i was
[1:14:36] thinking too
[1:14:37] 21 verse 8
[1:14:40] my see the reason god's going to keep
[1:14:43] him out is because he's offering power
[1:14:45] to overcome these destructive sins
[1:14:49] he's offering all the power that he has
[1:14:52] his word amen
[1:14:54] the people turn down that power and love
[1:14:57] the powers of darkness he has no choice
[1:15:00] but to keep them out of the kingdom but
[1:15:02] you and i we're invited into the kingdom
[1:15:04] praise god we have access to the power
[1:15:07] and we got to act on the power receive
[1:15:09] the power and act upon it praise god
[1:15:12] amen glory revelation 21 8 but the
[1:15:15] fearful the unbelieving and the
[1:15:17] abominable and murderers and
[1:15:19] whoremongers and sorcerers and idolaters
[1:15:21] and all liars shall have their part in
[1:15:24] the lake which burneth with fire and
[1:15:26] brimstone which is the second death
[1:15:33] that's quite a scripture
[1:15:35] so we have to add so we see the same
[1:15:36] idea whoremongers idolaters
[1:15:39] anyone that doesn't repent of these
[1:15:42] things
[1:15:42] in this case if they don't repent
[1:15:44] they'll have they won't even be close to
[1:15:46] the kingdom they'll be annihilated in
[1:15:48] the lake of fire
[1:15:50] right
[1:15:53] kingdom boundaries
[1:15:55] that's verse 5.
[1:15:58] now go back to ephesians 5 verse 6 and 7
[1:16:01] here
[1:16:10] i want you to notice here
[1:16:17] the words we say are so important the
[1:16:20] words i'm preaching tonight
[1:16:22] are so important
[1:16:25] either their words of power or their
[1:16:28] vain words
[1:16:30] somebody better let me know if i'm
[1:16:32] saying vain words tonight
[1:16:33] because i don't think i am
[1:16:35] i think they're true words
[1:16:37] look at the destruction of vain words
[1:16:39] look at verse 6
[1:16:41] ephesians 5 verse 6
[1:16:43] let no man deceive you with vain words
[1:16:49] for because of these things cometh the
[1:16:51] what
[1:16:52] the wrath of god
[1:16:55] upon the children of disobedience so
[1:16:57] vain words will teach you to disobey
[1:17:00] god's word
[1:17:02] but
[1:17:03] powerful words will teach you to obey
[1:17:06] god's word amen amen
[1:17:08] hallelujah so vain words will be like
[1:17:11] it's okay to continue living in adultery
[1:17:14] it's okay to allow homosexuals in to be
[1:17:16] pastors and preachers and deacons
[1:17:18] you see it's vain
[1:17:20] because it's teaching disobedience
[1:17:26] church this is why there'll be no
[1:17:28] excuses on the day of judgment
[1:17:30] because all these churches in america
[1:17:32] all these churches around the world they
[1:17:33] have the word right here
[1:17:35] and they just ignore they just read the
[1:17:37] parts as a like a buffet they just pick
[1:17:40] out the things they want but god's given
[1:17:41] us a full course meal praise god
[1:17:44] it's not a buffet we don't just pick and
[1:17:46] choose we're taking everything praise
[1:17:48] god just a little we take it all
[1:17:50] our plate's real big
[1:17:53] we're feasting on the things of god amen
[1:17:55] there'll be no excuses because the bible
[1:17:57] says right here
[1:17:58] if you live in these sins you're lacking
[1:18:00] the power of the kingdom you're not a
[1:18:03] part of the kingdom and because of vain
[1:18:05] words comes the wrath of god those who
[1:18:07] disobey god's word
[1:18:09] hallelujah
[1:18:11] to me it just gets more plain every time
[1:18:13] we read the bible
[1:18:15] this foolish wise and foolish and the
[1:18:16] the make-believer the unbeliever it gets
[1:18:19] more clear all the time and it's helping
[1:18:21] us to decide which side we want to be on
[1:18:23] amen
[1:18:25] that's right
[1:18:27] hallelujah
[1:18:30] so what's going to try to deceive us
[1:18:32] vain words
[1:18:36] he said words empty words are going to
[1:18:38] try to deceive us
[1:18:41] empty words that teach us not to really
[1:18:43] fear the lord anymore or respect the
[1:18:46] lord
[1:18:47] empty words
[1:18:49] are what deceive people many times in
[1:18:51] churches
[1:18:56] so you and i must
[1:18:58] decide are these words heavy do these
[1:19:01] words carry weight or are they empty
[1:19:03] meaningless words
[1:19:06] praise god
[1:19:08] verse 7
[1:19:14] be not ye therefore partakers with them
[1:19:19] praise god
[1:19:27] god is good church praise god
[1:19:31] we know the sins and now we're taught
[1:19:33] not to let anything come out of our
[1:19:35] mouth except thanksgiving and we must
[1:19:37] stay away and not partake of any of
[1:19:40] these sins with these type of people
[1:19:44] praise god
[1:19:50] let's be careful what kind of words that
[1:19:51] we hear praise god what words we receive
[1:19:55] amen verse 8
[1:19:57] walking in the light
[1:19:59] verse 8 hallelujah amen
[1:20:03] thank the lord
[1:20:05] stronger than darkness
[1:20:08] his mercies are new every morning praise
[1:20:10] god
[1:20:11] verse 8 for ye were sometimes darkness
[1:20:14] but now
[1:20:15] are ye light in the lord
[1:20:18] walk as children of light amen
[1:20:23] hallelujah
[1:20:25] that was our testimony we used to walk
[1:20:28] like children of darkness
[1:20:30] we can all relate and say yes i lived in
[1:20:32] that darkness
[1:20:34] i i i wasn't shining light but every
[1:20:37] christian should be able to say my life
[1:20:39] has had a resurrection right
[1:20:41] the star right god stark is the day star
[1:20:45] has risen in my heart amen hallelujah
[1:20:48] i was walking in darkness
[1:20:51] living like the world
[1:20:53] but now the day star jesus christ his
[1:20:56] life his light has risen in my heart and
[1:20:59] now i'm walking in the light today
[1:21:03] that's right
[1:21:05] sometimes you're in darkness
[1:21:07] now you are the light amen
[1:21:10] hallelujah you are the light of the
[1:21:12] world praise god
[1:21:20] so see we don't have fornication
[1:21:22] uncleanness covetousness filthiness
[1:21:25] foolish talking jesting hormone coveting
[1:21:29] idolatry or empty words those are part
[1:21:32] of darkness but we are walking in the
[1:21:34] light
[1:21:36] amen
[1:21:37] how do you do it the bible said in first
[1:21:38] john 1 confess all your sins he's
[1:21:41] faithful and just to forgive you of all
[1:21:43] unrighteousness and then you're walking
[1:21:45] in the light as he is in the light
[1:21:48] hallelujah
[1:21:50] thank the lord
[1:21:54] blessed be his name
[1:21:58] now
[1:21:59] here's the kind of thought i just want
[1:22:01] to kind of
[1:22:02] this is where i thought i'd build to
[1:22:03] would be the fruit of the spirit here i
[1:22:06] want to just maybe go a little bit
[1:22:08] further with the fruit of the spirit
[1:22:14] verse 9
[1:22:15] now he says in verse 8 you are the light
[1:22:18] walk as children of the light
[1:22:21] for the fruit of the spirit is in all
[1:22:23] goodness
[1:22:25] and righteousness
[1:22:27] and truth
[1:22:31] okay he says your walk in the light you
[1:22:33] don't have any partakers of darkness you
[1:22:35] don't partake with the people of
[1:22:36] darkness
[1:22:37] and the fruit of the spirit is in all
[1:22:39] goodness
[1:22:40] and righteousness and truth
[1:22:44] so to me church paul is making it plain
[1:22:47] we cannot do those sins above
[1:22:50] and have the fruit of the spirit
[1:22:53] for the fruit of the spirit or the
[1:22:54] spirit only produces fruit through the
[1:22:57] goodness of god the righteousness of god
[1:23:00] and the truth of god
[1:23:02] amen
[1:23:04] those sins listen above have they cannot
[1:23:07] produce the fruit of the holy spirit
[1:23:09] amen
[1:23:10] hallelujah because it's unrighteousness
[1:23:13] but you and i
[1:23:14] are so called to walk in righteousness
[1:23:16] hallelujah
[1:23:18] thank the lord
[1:23:24] now
[1:23:25] i want to read something here brother
[1:23:26] braham says in the lamb's book of life
[1:23:28] 56
[1:23:30] he said now the fruit of the spirit is
[1:23:31] love joy peace long suffering goodness
[1:23:33] gentleness patience meekness that's the
[1:23:35] fruit of the spirit and the fruit that's
[1:23:38] the mark of the holy spirit
[1:23:41] showing that divine love had as anchored
[1:23:44] in the heart
[1:23:46] and the things of the world is dead
[1:23:49] praise god so what's the mark of the
[1:23:51] holy spirit the fruit of the holy spirit
[1:23:54] amen
[1:23:55] that's the mark praise god how do you
[1:23:57] know you got the right seed because you
[1:23:58] got the fruit that the seed has produced
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:02] hallelujah
[1:24:10] and now i've gone through this a few
[1:24:12] times but i want to just look at it
[1:24:13] again here tonight god hiding himself in
[1:24:15] simplicity but ram said jesus said many
[1:24:17] will say many will come to me and say
[1:24:19] lord have we not prophesied your name
[1:24:21] your name done many works and cast out
[1:24:24] devils he said depart i never knew you
[1:24:25] that's according matthew 7.
[1:24:28] see that isn't it that isn't it friends
[1:24:30] that's the reason the tongue's evidence
[1:24:32] i believe in speaking in tongues but i
[1:24:34] don't take it to be the only evidence of
[1:24:35] the holy spirit no sir the fruit of the
[1:24:38] spirit is the evidence
[1:24:41] so i want to go down these quotes again
[1:24:43] and this this thought one more time
[1:24:46] to show you and to preach it from the
[1:24:48] word that the fruit of the spirit is
[1:24:50] part of the evidence of being born again
[1:24:53] right it's part of the evidence in fact
[1:24:56] the evidence program tells us is that we
[1:24:58] are in the word all the way
[1:25:00] and fruits of the spirit are part of the
[1:25:02] word amen hallelujah
[1:25:06] that's right so whatever the word says
[1:25:08] for our day
[1:25:09] we must obey it and live it and when we
[1:25:12] do that proves we are born again
[1:25:15] hallelujah
[1:25:20] now in the same quote but said the fruit
[1:25:22] of the spirit jesus said by their fruits
[1:25:24] not by their gifts he said by their
[1:25:26] fruits you know them so that that is the
[1:25:29] fruit of the spirit
[1:25:31] it's god unfolding himself in humility
[1:25:34] sweetness
[1:25:36] and every day the same
[1:25:40] it's something about a man that stays
[1:25:42] right with the word every time that he
[1:25:45] sees the word he punctuates it with an
[1:25:47] amen no matter what the other people say
[1:25:53] see that humility sweetness every day
[1:25:56] the same is a sweet humble walk with the
[1:25:58] lord
[1:26:00] oh thank the lord amen
[1:26:04] i love this praise god
[1:26:07] is your life worth the gospel and if
[1:26:08] brother amen's listening i just want to
[1:26:10] say that but amen i've been talking
[1:26:12] about some sermons but amen if you like
[1:26:13] a good sermon listen to listen to is
[1:26:16] your life worth the gospel one of the
[1:26:17] first sermons i ever listened to
[1:26:19] uh beautiful beautiful message
[1:26:23] june 30th 63.
[1:26:25] but here's a quote from that message
[1:26:27] when this takes place the thing you'll
[1:26:29] do then you'll find out that the spirit
[1:26:31] that comes in you
[1:26:33] from the new birth you will believe and
[1:26:35] do everything that god says in his word
[1:26:38] is for you to do
[1:26:42] and everything that the bible quotes for
[1:26:44] you to do you'll punctuate it with an
[1:26:46] amen and you'll not stop day or night
[1:26:49] until you receive it that's right and in
[1:26:51] all this time you'll certainly
[1:26:54] above everything bear the fruits of the
[1:26:56] spirit everybody catch that he said
[1:26:59] certainly above everything you'll bear
[1:27:02] the fruits of the spirit
[1:27:05] hallelujah praise god
[1:27:07] above everything so above anything else
[1:27:10] you can do
[1:27:11] if you're truly born again with that
[1:27:13] incorruptible seed of god you will bear
[1:27:15] the fruits of that holy spirit baptism
[1:27:19] above everything else
[1:27:21] above gifts above signs above prophecies
[1:27:24] right above dreams above miracles
[1:27:28] above wisdom above all these things he
[1:27:30] said above all that you will bear the
[1:27:33] fruits of the holy spirit
[1:27:35] he says everyday life a humble sweet
[1:27:38] everyday life serving jesus christ
[1:27:43] he said you say well i speak in tongues
[1:27:45] he said you might do that
[1:27:47] and you might not
[1:27:49] will i shout you might do that you might
[1:27:52] not
[1:27:55] i love this i praise god but there's one
[1:27:57] sure thing you will do you will bear the
[1:28:01] fruit of the spirit
[1:28:04] and the fruit of the spirit is love and
[1:28:06] joy peace and faith and long-suffering
[1:28:08] meekness jonas patient
[1:28:11] your temple will not be ooh just
[1:28:13] remember when you got that that poisons
[1:28:16] the holy spirit away from you see when
[1:28:18] you get to the place that you want to
[1:28:19] fuss with everybody you come along to
[1:28:21] there's something wrong
[1:28:25] praise god
[1:28:32] he said temper breeds temper so don't
[1:28:35] argue with people
[1:28:37] temper breeds temper and love breeds
[1:28:39] love be full of love
[1:28:44] jesus said they this will all men know
[1:28:46] my disciples when you have love one for
[1:28:48] another that's the fruit of the holy
[1:28:50] spirit love
[1:28:52] a few weeks ago my children probably
[1:28:53] remember this we were having some
[1:28:54] teasing going on and some
[1:28:56] just some arguing and children remember
[1:28:58] what i did i went in every room and you
[1:29:00] remember what i prayed
[1:29:02] i say lord let love fill this bedroom
[1:29:05] remember that
[1:29:07] you remember that haven remember that
[1:29:08] when i did that i went in every room and
[1:29:11] i said lord help us help the children to
[1:29:14] love each other in this room let the
[1:29:16] love of jesus christ the love of god
[1:29:18] come in this room so we don't tease or
[1:29:20] argue or fuss or hurt or get angry
[1:29:25] because that may prove we're not born
[1:29:27] again
[1:29:28] because if you have the fruit of the
[1:29:29] spirit the fruit is going to be present
[1:29:31] right
[1:29:32] if you're born again you're going to be
[1:29:34] reproducing fruit people will see the
[1:29:36] fruit of the holy spirit in your life
[1:29:39] so i went every room sister beatrice and
[1:29:41] i prayed i said god let the love of
[1:29:43] jesus christ fill this room may we not
[1:29:45] argue and be bitter and fuss it's been a
[1:29:48] lot better since then amen praise god
[1:29:52] you see it's it's spirits battling right
[1:29:55] spirits are battling
[1:29:57] and satan's always trying to inject
[1:29:59] leaven right but we gotta take the
[1:30:01] leaven out praise god amen amen
[1:30:06] how do you know you're jesus disciples
[1:30:08] you have love one for another
[1:30:13] thank the lord
[1:30:15] now brother is praying at the end of
[1:30:17] this sermon is your life worth the
[1:30:18] gospel he says pray god to let the light
[1:30:20] of this day rise in you to be an
[1:30:22] obedient servant to god and then let the
[1:30:25] fruit of the spirit ever remain in your
[1:30:27] life
[1:30:28] that is a life worthy of the gospel
[1:30:32] amen brethren ends this sermon by just
[1:30:36] emphasizing we got to have the fruit of
[1:30:38] the holy spirit it must ever remain
[1:30:41] remember he said above everything else
[1:30:43] make sure your life is producing the
[1:30:45] fruit of the holy spirit
[1:30:50] he said if we are christians of this day
[1:30:52] let's receive jesus christ into our
[1:30:54] heart and he is the word don't deny any
[1:30:57] of it say it's the truth just say it's
[1:30:58] the truth and place it in your heart and
[1:31:01] watch the fruit of the spirit upon you
[1:31:03] and fulfill every promise that he made
[1:31:06] in the bible
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:09] hallelujah
[1:31:13] he says may we live a life same sermon
[1:31:16] from henceforth that's worthy
[1:31:19] with sweetness and gentleness
[1:31:24] don't pay no attention say well bless
[1:31:26] god i know she's got it she spoke with
[1:31:27] tongues she danced in the spirit that's
[1:31:30] all right but if she doesn't have the
[1:31:31] fruit of the spirit the spirit isn't
[1:31:33] there
[1:31:35] how about that one praise god
[1:31:38] she's only impersonating some kind of
[1:31:40] emotion or something because the holy
[1:31:42] spirit can only live the life of the
[1:31:45] fruit of the spirit amen it reminds me
[1:31:47] of that quote by man says it's the only
[1:31:49] thing the word can produce amen
[1:31:52] the only life the holy ghost can produce
[1:31:55] is a life of the fruit of the holy
[1:31:57] spirit that's the only life it can
[1:31:58] produce
[1:32:00] a godly sweet gentle i'll say bold life
[1:32:04] amen for jesus christ
[1:32:07] that's right amen
[1:32:09] hallelujah
[1:32:11] i'm enjoying these quotes praise god
[1:32:13] amen
[1:32:14] now church what is fruitfulness
[1:32:18] fruitfulness is maturity
[1:32:21] right the seed has come to its maturity
[1:32:26] it's
[1:32:27] it's your your purpose you've achieved
[1:32:30] your purpose
[1:32:33] right there's nine fruits of the holy
[1:32:35] spirit
[1:32:36] nine
[1:32:38] is maturity now there's a whole i preach
[1:32:40] on numerology remember biblical
[1:32:41] numerology last year
[1:32:43] i didn't look all those numbers up but
[1:32:45] nine was maturity fruitfulness
[1:32:49] so see that's what this word means
[1:32:53] this is the whole point of christianity
[1:32:55] right is to be fruitful that your life
[1:32:58] produces all of these attributes
[1:33:01] and you can find love in your life
[1:33:03] you can find patience and long suffering
[1:33:05] and meekness and gentleness and
[1:33:08] temperance right you can find all these
[1:33:10] fruits in your life
[1:33:15] let's turn to john 15 here
[1:33:18] i read this actually as a witness
[1:33:20] this morning i was reading a little book
[1:33:21] about uh family
[1:33:24] christian book
[1:33:25] and uh
[1:33:27] they actually brought this scripture so
[1:33:28] i kind of felt it was a dual witness
[1:33:30] from the holy spirit
[1:33:33] john 15
[1:33:35] verse 1 i am the true vine and my father
[1:33:37] is the husbandman
[1:33:39] every branch in me that beareth not
[1:33:41] fruit he taketh away and every branch
[1:33:43] that beareth fruit he purges it that it
[1:33:45] may bring forth more fruit
[1:33:48] aren't you glad god takes away your bad
[1:33:50] branches
[1:33:52] praise god aren't you glad
[1:33:55] i was pruning our apple tree a few
[1:33:57] months ago
[1:33:58] because i couldn't brother ray i
[1:33:59] couldn't mow under it the branches were
[1:34:01] i'm like uh i'm getting real close and
[1:34:04] [Music]
[1:34:05] i just can't get under it because the
[1:34:07] branches but i was so happy when i got
[1:34:09] up there to go prune it praise god
[1:34:12] for a couple purposes right one purpose
[1:34:14] now i can mow i can mow under it this
[1:34:16] year
[1:34:17] makes my job a lot easier
[1:34:19] but second is it's going to cut off the
[1:34:22] life from being wasted in the bad
[1:34:24] branches and that life is going to get
[1:34:27] channeled into better branches so it can
[1:34:29] produce more fruit praise god amen see
[1:34:33] the heavenly father the great husbandman
[1:34:35] the lord jesus christ he cuts off every
[1:34:38] branch that doesn't bear fruit right
[1:34:40] and then those that are good he purges
[1:34:43] those as well
[1:34:45] trims them
[1:34:47] that it may bring forth
[1:34:49] more fruit
[1:34:51] more fruit
[1:34:56] now look at verse four abide in me and i
[1:34:57] in you as the branch cannot bear fruit
[1:34:59] of itself except it abide in the vine no
[1:35:02] more can ye accept ye abide in me
[1:35:07] praise god
[1:35:11] now there's a scripture i was looking
[1:35:12] for here real quick yeah
[1:35:15] yeah verse 5 i am the vine ye are the
[1:35:17] branches he that abideth in me and i in
[1:35:19] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:35:21] for without me
[1:35:22] ye can do nothing now that's the whole
[1:35:24] theme of my life right there
[1:35:26] john 15 5 without jesus christ i can do
[1:35:29] nothing
[1:35:30] if there's anything good about me it
[1:35:32] wasn't me it was christ in me praise god
[1:35:35] i have never done nothing except it was
[1:35:38] god if there's any good in it god did it
[1:35:40] praise god amen
[1:35:42] now look at verse 8.
[1:35:45] this is why god delights in holy
[1:35:47] ghost-filled christians
[1:35:49] because they keep investing in the
[1:35:51] talents in their lives they stay focused
[1:35:54] on doing god's will and after a while
[1:35:57] they produce much fruit
[1:36:01] verse 8 herein is my father glorified
[1:36:03] that you bear much fruit
[1:36:07] so shall ye be my disciples amen
[1:36:10] so who are the ones that are going to be
[1:36:12] bearing a lot of fruit a lot of uh real
[1:36:15] genuine character of christ the real
[1:36:17] disciples of christ
[1:36:20] the people that really learn and really
[1:36:22] know get to know christ and learn of him
[1:36:24] because he said i'm meek i'm meek and
[1:36:27] lowly of heart
[1:36:28] so the meek disciples are going to come
[1:36:30] to the meek teacher
[1:36:33] and they're going to learn from him
[1:36:34] praise god and then the father is going
[1:36:36] to be glorified because they bring forth
[1:36:39] much fruit because they're constantly
[1:36:41] staying in god's presence
[1:36:46] they're abiding in the vine they're
[1:36:48] abiding in the word of god
[1:36:51] praise the lord amen
[1:36:54] hallelujah
[1:36:59] how do you do that verse 10 if you keep
[1:37:01] my commandments
[1:37:03] ye shall abide in my love how do you
[1:37:05] abide in christ keep the commands
[1:37:08] keep the commands
[1:37:10] glory
[1:37:18] now i want to end with this um
[1:37:20] quote from
[1:37:23] a message
[1:37:24] i'll pull it up in just a second here
[1:37:33] yeah paradox 64.
[1:37:35] okay
[1:37:37] it's paradox 64. so give me just a
[1:37:38] second let me pull these quotes up
[1:37:44] because this is very helpful to me
[1:37:47] i think it'll be helpful to you too
[1:37:52] a lot of people i talk to in the message
[1:37:54] they say oh the fruits of the spirit are
[1:37:56] not
[1:37:57] the evidence of the holy spirit because
[1:37:58] brother graham said the pharisees and
[1:38:00] christian science had more fruits than
[1:38:02] christians
[1:38:04] now that
[1:38:06] with that understanding people really
[1:38:08] aren't really understanding what brother
[1:38:09] brahm said
[1:38:11] okay because they need to keep listening
[1:38:13] and keep reading right
[1:38:15] so i want to prove that just by going
[1:38:16] over these quotes again tonight to help
[1:38:18] uh our church out because i only took i
[1:38:20] only preached it once in 2016. i want to
[1:38:22] preach it again tonight so you can see
[1:38:24] that understanding the fruits of the
[1:38:26] spirit quotes
[1:38:27] now when brother branham was speaking
[1:38:29] from the when brother man was saying
[1:38:31] these stories about how the pharisees
[1:38:33] had more fruits than jesus
[1:38:35] he was speaking from the view of the
[1:38:37] pharisees
[1:38:39] and what they thought the fruits of the
[1:38:40] spirit were but they were wrong
[1:38:43] okay and this is plainly taught
[1:38:46] in the quotes
[1:38:49] he said the pharisees some of them said
[1:38:50] well it's the fruit of the spirit that's
[1:38:52] right the pharisees had more fruit of
[1:38:54] spirit what we call fruit of the spirit
[1:38:56] than they we could ever produce
[1:39:00] so what we call not what god calls what
[1:39:03] just humans call
[1:39:05] right
[1:39:06] he said then what did this guy do when
[1:39:08] he got there he turned over the money
[1:39:09] tables beat them out there trying to
[1:39:11] keep a man from getting his soul right
[1:39:13] with god and what did he say about the
[1:39:14] godly old priests there of yours they're
[1:39:17] a bunch of snakes in this uh a bunch of
[1:39:19] snakes and of the devil talk about the
[1:39:20] fruit of spirit they had him beat by a
[1:39:23] long ways now people will read this and
[1:39:25] say the pharisees had more fruit of the
[1:39:27] spirit than jesus impossible
[1:39:30] impossible
[1:39:31] because i'll say like this jesus was the
[1:39:33] promised seed
[1:39:35] hallelujah he was the seed of god
[1:39:38] amen thank the lord amen he was the
[1:39:41] woman seed amen that's right
[1:39:43] hallelujah
[1:39:45] he was the promised seed of the woman
[1:39:47] that bruised the head of satan
[1:39:49] hallelujah amen
[1:39:54] thank the lord
[1:39:57] see what the trouble was
[1:39:59] jesus didn't appear to have much through
[1:40:01] the spirit according to the pharisees
[1:40:03] definition of it
[1:40:07] they thought fruit was kissing babies
[1:40:09] circumcising babies lending money and
[1:40:12] other
[1:40:13] non-fruits of the spirit that's what
[1:40:15] they thought the fruits of the spirit
[1:40:17] were
[1:40:18] okay but that's not the fruit of the
[1:40:19] spirit
[1:40:21] now here's what probably says if you lis
[1:40:22] this is the key message if you have any
[1:40:24] confusion about the fruits of the spirit
[1:40:27] uh
[1:40:28] we need to listen to that one from
[1:40:30] february 6 1964. because brother adam
[1:40:32] said god forgive me for doing this i'm
[1:40:34] going to put jesus on trial for you just
[1:40:36] a moment if you'll forgive me
[1:40:40] now heavenly father forgive me for this
[1:40:42] i don't like to speak it but it's so
[1:40:44] that the people would know
[1:40:47] i'm going to take that i'm going against
[1:40:49] jesus this morning i'm going to say
[1:40:51] you're a bunch of jewish people so when
[1:40:54] brother man was ever telling this idea
[1:40:56] that oh the the priest had more fruit to
[1:40:59] the spirit than jesus he always means by
[1:41:02] the jews perspective and not god's
[1:41:04] perspective amen hallelujah
[1:41:11] and jesus just rose up here in
[1:41:13] bakersfield let me call you
[1:41:15] man together and talk to you about the
[1:41:16] fruits of the spirit they believe that
[1:41:18] too what is the fruit of the spirit love
[1:41:19] joy peace long suffering jealous
[1:41:21] goodness that right through the spirit
[1:41:22] many people rely upon that
[1:41:24] sometimes that's the devil he can
[1:41:27] impersonate that so what's he talking
[1:41:28] about people impersonating the fruit of
[1:41:31] the spirit
[1:41:32] but they don't have it
[1:41:34] right
[1:41:36] if you're if you're impersonating donald
[1:41:38] trump today you're just impersonating
[1:41:40] but you're really not him
[1:41:42] right
[1:41:44] if you're impersonating brother brandon
[1:41:45] trying to discern and
[1:41:47] and you're you're just in person you're
[1:41:49] really not brother branham right
[1:41:52] if you're trying to impersonate a good
[1:41:53] singer you can't sing you're just in
[1:41:56] person and you don't have the gift to
[1:41:57] sing right
[1:41:59] that's what brother is saying the
[1:42:01] pharisees were impersonating fruits of
[1:42:03] the spirit they never had it
[1:42:06] praise god because they rejected jesus
[1:42:08] christ the seed of god amen
[1:42:11] right
[1:42:14] notice he said i'm going there's a
[1:42:16] priest i'm going to talk to you all now
[1:42:17] i'm taking sides against jesus just a
[1:42:19] moment i've asked god to forgive me just
[1:42:21] so i can show you what i mean to bring
[1:42:23] out a point
[1:42:25] so whatever brother man is saying the
[1:42:26] pharisees and the christian science had
[1:42:28] more fruit
[1:42:30] they're in per he says they're
[1:42:31] impersonating the fruit like they're
[1:42:33] just kind and nice and they don't argue
[1:42:36] and they don't shoot people and they
[1:42:37] don't get angry they're just so kind but
[1:42:40] it's impersonation it's not real fruit
[1:42:42] of the holy spirit
[1:42:46] see brethren teaches satan impersonates
[1:42:48] the fruit he's taken the perspective of
[1:42:50] the jews in this scenario
[1:42:54] then he talks like he's a jew gentlemen
[1:42:56] i'm here on behalf of your church this
[1:42:57] morning i'm speaking to you all now
[1:42:58] there's a young fellow here by the name
[1:43:00] of jesus he's got a strange strange
[1:43:02] doctrine we know our priests now we have
[1:43:04] to judge us by the fruit of the spirit
[1:43:06] so see
[1:43:06] he's talking about jews
[1:43:09] thinking that their priests have the
[1:43:10] fruits of the spirit and how jesus
[1:43:13] acts like he doesn't have the fruits of
[1:43:15] the spirit because he's rough with them
[1:43:18] all right
[1:43:22] now for time's sake it's getting late
[1:43:23] i'm going to skip ahead mine's already
[1:43:25] too late
[1:43:26] now he says now that makes sense
[1:43:27] brothers if you're talking the
[1:43:29] psychological way of it it all makes
[1:43:31] sense
[1:43:33] so the pharisees were
[1:43:34] psychologically trying to convince
[1:43:36] themselves that their priests had the
[1:43:39] fruit of the spirit but they didn't
[1:43:44] now
[1:43:45] he said what'd your kind of priest do he
[1:43:46] got you
[1:43:47] when your daddy ran out of money
[1:43:49] he let you that money from his tithe
[1:43:52] until your crops came in
[1:43:55] oh mercy who stood by you when your
[1:43:57] mother was in labor you're you're kind o
[1:43:59] priest
[1:44:02] who lifted you up to jehovah circumcise
[1:44:04] you that kind of priest and look what
[1:44:06] jesus said he said what do you ever do
[1:44:09] that had the fruit of the holy spirit
[1:44:12] i'm just going fast here
[1:44:14] what these kind of priests do and your
[1:44:16] soul would not be lost they had some
[1:44:18] sellers to go up there in the courts
[1:44:19] make little cages put lambs in there
[1:44:22] you take your income and
[1:44:24] and it made something else to keep your
[1:44:25] economy going and they made you a place
[1:44:28] you got so sin burdened and you want to
[1:44:29] get released from your sins this kind of
[1:44:31] priest had a place you could go
[1:44:33] buy a lamb of god
[1:44:35] god didn't want your money set a lamb
[1:44:37] and you went and bought a lamb
[1:44:40] he says what did jesus of nazareth do he
[1:44:42] come in there and empty them out and
[1:44:44] told them they're a bunch of dead
[1:44:45] thieves not much of fruit of spirit
[1:44:46] there is there your kind no priest never
[1:44:48] gets out of humor
[1:44:50] see what he's doing he's taking the side
[1:44:52] against jesus
[1:44:55] and saying how the jews would say how
[1:44:57] could jesus have the fruit of the spirit
[1:44:59] how could he be gentle and yet he drives
[1:45:01] him out he was gentle amen
[1:45:04] hallelujah that was gentle praise god
[1:45:08] he actually didn't hit them with the
[1:45:10] ropes the bible never says that the
[1:45:12] bible never says he at the animals he
[1:45:13] just drove them out of the courts
[1:45:16] he was gentle
[1:45:19] that's right
[1:45:21] now you say brother branham i could say
[1:45:22] a sermon on this but i won't what is the
[1:45:24] fruit of the spirit the manifestation of
[1:45:27] the promised word amen there it is if
[1:45:30] they just stopped to look he did not
[1:45:31] have these things that they had fruits
[1:45:34] of the spirit or anything but the word
[1:45:36] that was promised that day was
[1:45:38] manifesting himself that was exactly the
[1:45:40] light for the hour
[1:45:42] no matter how much education how much
[1:45:44] you speak with tongues are kind gentle
[1:45:46] everything you are unless you accept
[1:45:48] that word of the hour when it's
[1:45:50] manifested before you you're in the same
[1:45:52] predicament
[1:45:53] this might sound crude i don't doubt it
[1:45:56] i'm sorry i don't mean it that way but
[1:45:57] it's truth just believe it see all right
[1:45:59] now god forgive me you see what i mean
[1:46:02] who had the fruit of the spirit
[1:46:04] jesus
[1:46:06] what message is this church paradox
[1:46:10] so see all those times brother bam said
[1:46:12] christian science have more fruit of the
[1:46:14] spirit jew the jewish kind of priests
[1:46:16] have more fruit of spirit he's taken the
[1:46:18] sides of the jews
[1:46:20] but in this sermon he clearly says who
[1:46:23] had the fruit of the spirit
[1:46:24] jesus had it
[1:46:27] praise god
[1:46:29] does that help somebody praise the lord
[1:46:31] amen
[1:46:32] you'd be surprised how many message
[1:46:34] people i've talked to that believe
[1:46:36] brother ray christian science have more
[1:46:38] fruit of the spirit than we do now we're
[1:46:40] not trying to compete but the reality of
[1:46:42] it is if they reject the word of the
[1:46:44] hour if they reject the seed of the hour
[1:46:46] how can they have the fruit of that seed
[1:46:48] when they rejected it they can't
[1:46:52] you'd be surprised how many people think
[1:46:53] that
[1:46:54] that we don't have more fruits of the
[1:46:56] spirit than the christian science
[1:46:59] nah
[1:47:04] brother braham said jesus christ bore
[1:47:06] every fruit perfectly
[1:47:09] praise god
[1:47:12] let's stand our feet here i'll close
[1:47:15] now always don't judge your life by how
[1:47:17] much power you have to perform miracles
[1:47:19] we don't judge ourselves by how much
[1:47:21] knowledge you have of the word
[1:47:23] but always judge yourself look back and
[1:47:26] take an inventory of what kind of fruit
[1:47:28] that the life you presently live now is
[1:47:32] bearing
[1:47:33] praise god
[1:47:37] and here's one i read earlier if she
[1:47:39] doesn't have the fruit of the spirit the
[1:47:40] spirit isn't there
[1:47:47] praise god musicians you can come here
[1:47:49] praise god i hope that was a help to
[1:47:51] somebody tonight
[1:47:53] paul said
[1:47:55] as i repeat that
[1:47:57] you were sometimes darkness but now you
[1:47:59] are light in the lord walk as children
[1:48:01] of the light for the fruit of the spirit
[1:48:04] is in all goodness and righteousness and
[1:48:07] truth
[1:48:10] you know who the famous christian
[1:48:11] science is
[1:48:12] tom cruise how do you know who tom
[1:48:13] cruise is he's a famous american
[1:48:15] hollywood actor you know how many wives
[1:48:17] he's had at least two or three or four
[1:48:22] and so people that believe that they
[1:48:23] take those quotes and they don't
[1:48:24] understand them how could a man that's
[1:48:26] been married three times
[1:48:28] and then make love with countless women
[1:48:30] on movies how can he have more walking
[1:48:32] in the light we are the children of the
[1:48:34] light so the seed in us can be brought
[1:48:37] forth to produce the fruit of the spirit
[1:48:40] amen
[1:48:45] he says if they don't have the fruit of
[1:48:46] the spirit the spirit isn't there
[1:48:49] let's bow our heads here
[1:48:51] church we don't want to impersonate the
[1:48:53] fruit of the spirit
[1:48:54] we want to bear the fruit of the spirit
[1:49:01] paul tells these christians there
[1:49:04] they're some of the last ones there
[1:49:05] right because this city didn't last very
[1:49:07] long
[1:49:10] he says make sure you have the fruit of
[1:49:12] the spirit and all goodness and
[1:49:14] righteousness
[1:49:15] in truth
[1:49:19] take a moment church let's look at the
[1:49:20] garden of your life do you see the fruit
[1:49:23] of love laying there
[1:49:24] can you love your
[1:49:26] enemies you see the fruit of joy there
[1:49:30] you have joy some in the midst of trials
[1:49:33] do you see the fruit of peace there that
[1:49:36] you feel peace in your heart with god
[1:49:38] and with man
[1:49:39] [Music]
[1:49:41] you see the fruit of long suffering
[1:49:45] praise god
[1:49:47] you can suffer a long time with people
[1:49:53] do you see the fruit of gentleness over
[1:49:55] there in your garden
[1:49:57] ah
[1:49:58] praise god
[1:49:59] do you see the fruit of goodness laying
[1:50:01] there
[1:50:04] can your family come over and pluck some
[1:50:07] fruit of faith off your your vine
[1:50:10] well i know sister will pray for me

[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:22] it's just there all the time every day
[1:50:23] it's there
[1:50:26] how about the fruit of meekness just
[1:50:28] being so humble
[1:50:29] always putting god above you
[1:50:32] apart from jesus i can do nothing that's
[1:50:34] your words all the time
[1:50:37] how about temperance you got such
[1:50:38] control over your body and your passions
[1:50:41] that it's a fruit that we can go and
[1:50:43] pick off and say man
[1:50:44] brother sister can i talk to you how do
[1:50:46] you get so disciplined how do you get so
[1:50:49] faithful to god's word
[1:50:51] how do you have so much self-control
[1:50:53] with your husband with your children
[1:50:55] with your parents
[1:50:59] how are you so patient with your brother
[1:51:02] with your sister
