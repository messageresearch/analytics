[22:00] amen thank you lord
[22:02] praise God praise God let's take a few
[22:08] very question few non Smits by God's
[22:09] grace just a few announcements this
[22:12] Sunday we are doing officer voting I
[22:14] think I've said in text everybody on
[22:15] that yesterday by God's grace so just
[22:18] keep that in mind for Sunday we'll also
[22:20] have two services this Sunday by the
[22:22] grace of the Lord those are our
[22:25] announcements prayer requests the little
[22:29] boy in my class he's still having these
[22:31] migraines let's keep praying for him his
[22:34] mom's gonna take him to get an MRI he
[22:37] was sick well he was fine all day today
[22:38] but then he threw up right at the end of
[22:39] the day so mom's really concerned about
[22:41] him let's pray that God will touch this
[22:44] child here and they're not sure what's
[22:45] wrong that's God to be merciful praise
[22:48] God also one of my college teammates his
[22:54] wife put a Facebook post up and and I
[22:56] haven't talked to him in years but I
[22:58] just told him on the on the Facebook
[23:01] that we pray for him the baby had one of
[23:04] those what are they calling on you when
[23:11] you scan the baby inside the womb
[23:13] I'll ultrasound that's right I don't
[23:15] want to say the wrong word
[23:17] that's like forgive me yes can we come
[23:23] over that medical term there anyways my
[23:28] friend's name is Brad then the baby is a
[23:30] boy but they said there's there's some
[23:34] trouble with the internal organs I think
[23:36] it's missing some of the organs or
[23:37] something like that and so it's only the
[23:40] baby is only expected to live a few
[23:42] hours after birth they said they're
[23:44] gonna take a full term because and she
[23:45] said they're praying for a miracle so I
[23:48] thought that was really wonderful
[23:50] and at the family siding with life
[23:53] so I told just the friend on Facebook
[23:57] that we would lift their baby up and
[23:59] pray so we know God is able let's ask if
[24:05] it be God's will to honor their faith to
[24:08] have that baby so just let's pray for
[24:10] God's will to be done you know think of
[24:16] my little nephew you know he he was born
[24:18] with a little hole in his heart and then
[24:19] my brother brothers prayed for him and
[24:21] in God closed up that hole didn't have
[24:24] to have any surgery so this this would
[24:27] be a bigger miracle than that but with
[24:30] God all things are possible
[24:31] praise the Lord any other prayer
[24:33] requests tonight by God's grace Esther

[40:20] we'll start at verse 1 revelation 7
[40:21] verse 1
[40:22] [Music]
[40:31] revelation 7 verse 1 doctor read verses
[40:50] 1 1 to 4 by God's grace ah read verses 1
[40:56] to 3 and then we'll all read verse 4
[40:57] together Deborah Scott oh praise the
[41:00] Lord God let's give him around flowers
[41:01] good to see you brother Lord last year
[41:03] good to see you sir god bless you what a
[41:07] surprise hallelujah first one and after
[41:12] these things I saw four angels standing
[41:14] on the four corners of the earth holding
[41:16] the four winds of the earth that the
[41:19] wind should not blow on the earth nor on
[41:21] the sea nor on any tree and I saw
[41:25] another angel ascending from the east
[41:26] having the seal of the Living God and
[41:29] that interesting and angel carries the
[41:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that
[41:34] interesting I can't explain that one yet
[41:36] but that's what the Bible says and he
[41:39] cried with a loud voice to the four
[41:40] angels to whom it was given to hurt the
[41:43] earth and the sea saying hurt not the
[41:45] earth neither the sea nor the trees till
[41:47] we have sealed the servants of our God
[41:50] in their foreheads
[41:52] that's all reading verse 4 ready one two
[41:54] three and I heard the number of them
[41:57] which were sealed and there were sealed
[41:59] an hundred and forty and four thousand
[42:02] of all the tribes of the children of
[42:05] Israel amen may God has blessings
[42:07] reading of his word may be seated praise
[42:08] Lord I like to
[42:16] it's got a few slides here I like to
[42:17] show Lydia I'll probably put them up
[42:20] here in just a minute so we're going
[42:22] through I think this is part eighty five
[42:24] on the book of Revelation series so
[42:28] we're going to keep pressing on through
[42:29] I like to preach the whole book of
[42:31] Revelation the Lord willing and
[42:32] appreciated the inspiration the Lord has
[42:36] given me so let's continue looking on
[42:42] there we finished last week looking at
[42:43] the sixth seal by the grace of the Lord
[42:46] and let's keep moving on here into
[42:49] Revelation chapter 7 and we will
[42:53] continue on you love the Lord tonight
[42:56] amen it's good to sing to the Lord good
[42:59] to worship and the beauty of holiness
[43:00] the Bible says so thank God so let's
[43:04] look here tonight and we'll look be
[43:06] looking at Israel of course if you know
[43:09] the message verses one to eight is
[43:12] Israel there's two thoughts on verses
[43:15] nine to the end of the chapter some
[43:17] people believe it's the foolish virgin
[43:20] some people believe it's the bride Lord
[43:22] willing we'll look at that on Sunday I
[43:23] believe it's the bride myself there's
[43:25] three quotes her brother Branham says
[43:26] it's the bride there's one quote where
[43:28] he says the foolish virgin so I just
[43:31] think I think from the evidence in the
[43:32] scripture it's the bride but tonight
[43:35] Lord willing we're looking at the
[43:36] hundred and forty-four thousand praise
[43:38] God so let's look at verse one again we
[43:41] look at the first three verses here and
[43:43] we'll get started by the grace of the
[43:46] Lord now here we have the angels command
[43:52] here in verse one two three again now we
[43:54] read this last week a little bit we've
[43:55] kind of been building up and last week
[43:57] we showed all the events that have to
[43:59] take place under the sixth seal there's
[44:01] many many events many of week we can
[44:04] place together chronologically and some
[44:07] we don't know for sure we don't for
[44:09] example we don't know if we'll see the
[44:10] building of the third temple or not
[44:12] we're not quite sure one thing's for
[44:14] sure if we're in the bride we won't see
[44:16] Moses and Elijah
[44:17] thank God we won't see that because
[44:20] they'll be interrupting nature right
[44:22] they'll be turning water to blood
[44:24] they'll be causing it to not rain for
[44:26] three and a half years the Bible says
[44:28] there in Revelation chapter
[44:30] and of course we won't see them slain we
[44:32] won't see that rapture but one thing
[44:35] we'll do perhaps we will see the Lord
[44:37] Jesus at the marriage supper of the Lamb
[44:39] amen and then somehow some of us may see
[44:42] him slip down where the BAM said he has
[44:43] to slip down for a little bit at the end
[44:45] of the marriage supper and come down and
[44:47] reveal himself to the 144,000 that's
[44:51] what we're looking at here tonight by
[44:52] the grace of the Lord now I want to just
[44:54] emphasize again verses 1 2 & 3 how the
[44:57] earth cannot be hurt until after the
[45:03] 144,000 are sealed by the baptism of the
[45:05] holy God in other words they below until
[45:10] the 144,000 are borned again in one day
[45:14] the Bible says talk about a glorious day
[45:16] this is very reminiscent of the day of
[45:19] Pentecost praise God where 3,000 were
[45:22] saved the Bible said souls were added so
[45:25] we don't know if all 3000 were born
[45:26] again or just saved but souls were added
[45:29] because we know when someone's justified
[45:31] even a foolish version they're saved
[45:33] when they really believe and they have
[45:35] justification the Jesus says they're
[45:37] passed from death unto life amen
[45:40] remember Jesus told the foolish virgins
[45:42] in Matthew 25 he said he said they were
[45:45] surprised on the day of judgment but he
[45:46] said come on in enter in unto the joys
[45:49] and I prepared for you from the
[45:51] foundation of the world
[45:53] so Jesus loves the bride which is that
[45:55] chosen remnant out of the garment but
[45:57] Jesus also loves the raiment as well
[45:59] praise God he loves every part of the
[46:01] garment he loves all his children praise
[46:03] God so we see this here that that God is
[46:07] not going to allow the trees to be hurt
[46:09] in verse 1 the earth or the sea until
[46:12] after 144,000 people are born again I
[46:15] remember last year I looked up Israel's
[46:17] population it was about 7 million and I
[46:20] did the quick calculation of 144,000 of
[46:23] 7 million and it was right at 1 percent
[46:25] so about 1 percent now that's that's
[46:28] just right now right the we know the
[46:29] population may grow but it goes to show
[46:32] again how this this this little remnant
[46:34] is such a small group of Israel right
[46:37] Israelites right it's just a very small
[46:39] group because right now there's many
[46:41] Muslims that live there many Jews
[46:43] even a small group of Christians I lived
[46:45] there but the 144,000 faithful Jews will
[46:48] be a very small group no doubt the words
[46:51] of Jesus remind us even of his words for
[46:54] the little flock fear not little flock
[46:56] it's your father's good will to give you
[46:58] the kingdom amen it's a very small group
[47:00] of Jewish people that are actually
[47:02] faithful there's many many Jews but
[47:05] there's very few that actually faithful
[47:07] to the commandments of Jehovah now look
[47:10] at verse 1 and after these things I saw
[47:12] four angels standing on the four corners
[47:13] of the earth holding the four winds of
[47:16] the earth that the wind should not blow
[47:18] on the earth nor on the sea nor on any
[47:21] tree now if you got your Bible just turn
[47:25] over to chapter 8 verse 7 i I think I
[47:29] referenced this last week but I just
[47:30] want to bring it to your attention again
[47:31] under the first trumpet after the
[47:34] seventh seal is broken which we know
[47:36] brother man said is the day and hour of
[47:38] Jesus is coming the seventh seal is
[47:41] Jesus Christ returning to the earth at
[47:43] that mysterious unknown day an hour and
[47:46] that's when the silence is I'm sorry
[47:49] heaven is silent for half an hour
[47:51] they're silent brother Branham says he
[47:53] says where is that big fellow anyway
[47:54] that big fellow left heaven and he come
[47:57] down to the sky to meet his bride in the
[47:59] air head that's where he's at amen and
[48:02] that causes all heaven to be silent they
[48:04] stop singing they stop praising man so
[48:07] they stopped their altar worship he said
[48:09] they stopped all that service because
[48:11] the body of Jesus Christ comes down to
[48:13] the sky to meet his bride in the air
[48:15] amen and after the seventh seal then the
[48:18] judgments are falling so verse seven
[48:20] revelation 8 verse 7 and the first angel
[48:23] sounded and there followed hail and fire
[48:25] mingled with blood and they were cast
[48:28] upon the earth and the third part of the
[48:30] trees was burnt up and all green grass
[48:33] was burnt up so see we we see under the
[48:37] first trumpet that trees 1/3 of the
[48:41] trees are burned up and remember the
[48:43] voice said in chapter 7 hurt not any
[48:46] tree until the 144,000 are sealed so we
[48:50] see the trumpets have to sound after the
[48:53] one day when 144,000 are born again
[48:57] the same Holy Ghost that you and I say
[48:59] we got hey then hallelujah and the
[49:02] program said if they got the same Holy
[49:03] Ghost they'll act the same way you and I
[49:05] do amen oh yeah that's exactly right
[49:08] amen now look in verse 2 in chapter 7
[49:10] verse 2 you go back to chapter 7 verse 2
[49:13] and I saw another angel ascending from
[49:15] the east having the seal of the Living
[49:18] God and he cried with a loud voice to
[49:19] the four angels to whom it was given to
[49:21] hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt
[49:23] not the earth neither the sea nor the
[49:25] trees till we have sealed the servants
[49:27] of God in their foreheads
[49:30] praise God so we see that the baptism of
[49:34] the Holy Ghost to the Jews is called the
[49:36] seal in the forehead so you're gonna see
[49:39] that in other places in the book of
[49:41] Revelation that's that's just a
[49:43] figurative to the frontal part of the
[49:45] brain which is where the judgments and
[49:47] decisions are making I haven't preached
[49:48] on that in a while whether Scott would
[49:50] probably be able to give us a much
[49:51] better less than on that but I know the
[49:53] judgments and all your decision-making
[49:55] is in the frontal part and so the Bible
[49:58] likens the Jews receiving the baptism of
[50:00] the Holy Ghost to having their foreheads
[50:03] sealed in other words their judgments
[50:05] are God's judgments amen and that's what
[50:08] our should be praise God that's right we
[50:10] should judge the same way Christ would
[50:13] judge because we've got Christ's spirit
[50:15] inside of us amen because Jesus didn't
[50:18] polish ed he said don't you know the
[50:20] Saints shall judge the earth so in one
[50:22] way the baptism of Holy Ghost in our
[50:24] soul is is in our soul but it's also
[50:27] symbolic of our foreheads or our
[50:30] judgments being solely based upon God's
[50:33] judgment amen in other words every evil
[50:36] thought you bring it into captivity you
[50:38] take it into captivity to the Lord Jesus
[50:41] Christ and you cast on anything that
[50:43] exalts itself against the word of God
[50:45] and that's how you judge the Word of God
[50:47] Amen that's right you cast out anything
[50:50] that exalts itself against the Word of
[50:53] God
[50:53] alright now that's verses one to three
[50:57] now in verse four we start getting into
[51:01] these twelve tribes here now remember I
[51:03] shared this
[51:07] pretty surely others day and it was may
[51:09] last may appreciate Leah Leah loved of
[51:12] the Lord and she definitely was loved to
[51:14] the Lord praise God although not loved
[51:15] by Jacob at first
[51:17] she was eventually loved by Jacob but
[51:19] always loved by the Lord and so you see
[51:22] the 12 sons you see Leah had four okay
[51:25] and then it's a car and Zebulun come out
[51:30] and then Dinah and then lead a servant
[51:34] you have gad and ashur
[51:35] and then Rachel's servant Billa had two
[51:38] and then Rachel had two a Joseph and
[51:40] Benjamin there at the end and so the
[51:43] Bible said that Leah and and Rachel
[51:47] built the foundation of Israel so
[51:50] mothers take courage tonight I've just
[51:52] rehashed that message a little bit your
[51:54] purpose is so important you're building
[51:57] not Israel you're building the bride of
[52:00] Jesus Christ amen and my mom doesn't
[52:03] even really you know it you know cuz
[52:05] she's still in denomination cuts her
[52:06] hair and wears pants and wears makeup
[52:08] and all those things but she was
[52:10] building part of the bride of Jesus
[52:11] Christ as well even I believe that my
[52:13] faith amen that's what I believe
[52:15] training us and teaching us the word
[52:17] dragging us a church as much as she knew
[52:20] she was trying to lay those foundations
[52:22] foundational blocks we'd say in our
[52:25] spiritual lives and so the Bible said
[52:28] that that Leah and Rachel laid the
[52:31] foundation of Israel they built the
[52:32] house of Israel amen
[52:34] so sisters your your work is extremely
[52:37] important praise God and God sees you as
[52:39] building his bride amen
[52:42] now for those of you know I think I
[52:44] shared this last summer I think I was
[52:46] preaching on Revelation chapter 4 and I
[52:48] just rehearsed this briefly and we'll
[52:50] just briefly rehearse this as well the
[52:53] twelve sons of Jacob are listed there
[52:56] and from the Genesis 35 account now
[52:59] colored the ones that change so Levi and
[53:01] Joseph were in the first group but then
[53:04] in numbers they come out and Levi and
[53:08] Joseph are subtracted and in their place
[53:12] are Joseph's two sons Ephraim and
[53:15] Manasseh of course Levi was separated
[53:18] under the priesthood I'm not sure why
[53:19] Joseph was
[53:20] take enough if you know after that you
[53:22] can tell me after service and give me a
[53:23] good lesson I'm not sure why Joseph was
[53:25] taken up but his sons are placed in and
[53:28] then I put the asterisks of course by
[53:31] Ephraim and Dan because they were they
[53:34] introduced themselves into idolatry
[53:37] they let idolatry come into their tribe
[53:41] and because of that God blotted their
[53:43] name out from under heaven now this is
[53:46] amazing that God blots their name out
[53:48] from under heaven but then later God
[53:51] restores their tribal name later in the
[53:54] millennium night that meant to me all
[53:57] that says is God is a God of Amazing
[53:59] Grace God sees that they're given to
[54:03] idolatry somehow forgives them and then
[54:07] in the Millennium he restores their
[54:09] tribes back to their tribal order now
[54:12] church I don't know about to you but now
[54:13] make a shout and say thank you Jesus
[54:15] amen because he's so merciful and he
[54:20] blacks out their names on the earth but
[54:23] not in heaven now that's amazing that we
[54:28] see from our text that we're getting to
[54:31] tonight that in Revelation 7 so this is
[54:34] the group these are the tribes that are
[54:36] represented on the one day when Jesus
[54:40] Christ bursts 144,000 believers into who
[54:44] say his final part of his body right
[54:47] because they since they have the Spirit
[54:49] of Christ they've got to be a part of
[54:51] the body of Christ so he finishes off
[54:53] this last part and now we see that
[54:57] manassas there he stays there and then
[55:03] we see that Ephraim and Dan are missing
[55:06] and then Levi and Joseph are back in
[55:10] because of what Ephraim and Dan did I'm
[55:14] not sure why I followed Manasseh the
[55:15] whole way I'm not sure why I made him
[55:17] yellow I'm not sure about that I kind of
[55:19] forgotten so forgive me
[55:21] so this is the group that's going to be
[55:23] filled with the Holy Ghost sometime soon
[55:26] now we don't know when I think it's
[55:28] foolish to start guessing you know you
[55:30] see people do it all the time on
[55:31] Facebook or from different pulpits and
[55:33] things like that they try
[55:34] guess 40 years and 80 years and 70 years
[55:37] everybody's guessing the thing to do is
[55:39] not guess the thing to do is spend more
[55:42] time getting ready praise God we don't
[55:45] need we're not the ones who are gonna
[55:48] make God's clock tick at the right time
[55:50] we're not it's not our clock we don't
[55:52] have to worry about that clock we've
[55:54] just got to make sure our lives are
[55:56] ticking correctly praise God
[55:57] and that we are getting ready and that
[56:00] we're we're ready when he comes by the
[56:02] grace of the Lord but I think it's
[56:04] foolish to try to guess it and do those
[56:06] things unless we feel absolutely led of
[56:09] the Holy Spirit and then if we're
[56:10] letting the Holy Spirit we won't be
[56:12] wrong we'll be right but I think that's
[56:14] a dangerous thing to do most of time
[56:16] because people are just maybe trying to
[56:18] draw attention or get people to fear you
[56:20] know to try to motivate people to be
[56:22] ready for the rapture by fear we got to
[56:24] be motivated by faith we got to be and
[56:26] faith ultimately works by love amen
[56:29] faith which worketh by love the book of
[56:32] Galatians says so Levi Joseph get back
[56:36] in for this 144,000 coming up here very
[56:40] shortly we think we believe and then in
[56:43] the Millennium what happens is Dan and
[56:47] the Ephraim come back so strange and
[56:51] then Levi Joseph go back out and you
[56:53] still have Manasseh I'm not sure why I
[56:55] left that yellow but must have been a
[56:57] reason for so just to kind of reiterate
[56:59] that from Genesis the numbers Levi
[57:02] separated the priesthood Joseph's two
[57:04] sons are placed in so they take it out
[57:08] to the Ephraim are removed due to
[57:10] idolatry and then from revelation
[57:14] Ezekiel they get back in the numbers ten
[57:16] order there they're travelling order so
[57:20] striking isn't it a striking that that
[57:24] that God blots out their names under
[57:27] heaven but not in heaven but then Jesus
[57:29] says all those who are faithful he will
[57:32] not blot their names out of the book of
[57:34] life
[57:34] so Jesus even makes it seem like a
[57:36] little more serious for the Gentiles in
[57:39] other words we've got to not let
[57:40] anything get in our way we can't let
[57:42] anything distract us from from the goal
[57:45] the goal is to be faithful the Gulf
[57:48] to have a clean white robe amen that's
[57:50] the goal be faithful and keep the works
[57:53] of Christ unto the end amen
[57:55] that's the go if not the names get
[57:58] blotted out brother Brown set an example
[58:00] of that as Judas his name was on the
[58:02] book because he was he was proclaiming
[58:04] that besaid he was proclaiming to
[58:06] believe but yet he did not believe he
[58:09] transgressed and because of that
[58:11] programs that his name was brought it
[58:13] off the book of life
[58:14] oh my so the book of life is a great
[58:18] mystery it's a great teaching it's a
[58:20] great understanding and we've got to
[58:23] have our names on the book by God's
[58:25] grace amen
[58:26] hallelujah now idolatry I want to look
[58:30] at a few things on idolatry just for a
[58:31] moment in the church age book brother
[58:34] Branham goes through on page 296 and 271
[58:38] I'm just gonna read a few portions of
[58:39] that I didn't have time to get all the
[58:41] quotes up there on the slides so I'm
[58:42] just going to read a little bit about
[58:43] that idolatry to kind of remember a
[58:47] remind us of what happened now in
[58:49] Deuteronomy 29 16 to 20 God gives a
[58:54] warning about idolatry and says their
[58:57] names will be removed he says this he
[59:00] says the Lord will not spare him but
[59:04] then the anger the Lord and his jealousy
[59:06] shall smoke against the man and all the
[59:08] curses that are written this book shall
[59:10] lie upon him and the Lord shall blot out
[59:12] his name from under heaven so that's the
[59:16] judgment pronounced now here's the one
[59:20] of the cases if you have your Bible
[59:21] you'd like to read it if you want to you
[59:23] can first kings 12 25 to 30 here's where
[59:27] the ears were F Ephraim builds an idol
[59:30] and it's spoken of here
[59:32] verse 25 then Jeroboam built sheet gem
[59:35] in mount ephraim and dwelt there and
[59:37] went out from thence and built Penuel
[59:39] and Jeroboam said in his heart and how
[59:42] shall the kingdom return to the house of
[59:43] David if this people go up a new
[59:46] sacrifice in the house of the Lord at
[59:47] Jerusalem then shall the heart of his
[59:49] people turn again unto their Lord even
[59:52] under Ray jabón king of Judah and they
[59:56] shall kill me and go again to Rhea boom
[59:59] king of Judah whereupon the king took
[1:00:01] so made two calves of gold and sending
[1:00:03] them it is too much for you to go up to
[1:00:05] Israel to Jerusalem behold thy God's o
[1:00:08] Israel which brought thee up out of the
[1:00:10] land of Egypt and he set one in Bethel
[1:00:12] and the other one in dan I'm sorry put
[1:00:15] he and Dan and this thing became a sin
[1:00:17] for the people went to worship before
[1:00:19] the one even unto Dan now church there's
[1:00:23] a good spiritual lesson there can
[1:00:24] anybody see the lesson in order for this
[1:00:27] king here Jeroboam
[1:00:29] to keep the people coming to him he had
[1:00:32] to create idols and these idols made the
[1:00:36] worship easier on the people and it
[1:00:39] changed the provided place where God put
[1:00:43] his name so it made it easier you don't
[1:00:46] have to travel all the way that long
[1:00:49] distance to worship I'm going to make it
[1:00:51] easier on you and I'm going to give you
[1:00:53] a different way to worship let me know
[1:00:57] that God's ways are not always the
[1:00:58] easiest ways help me know that we often
[1:01:01] must choose the harder way remember a
[1:01:04] few weeks ago when we preach on brother
[1:01:05] Rams reward through Danny Henry remember
[1:01:08] what the voice said because you've
[1:01:09] chosen the easier way is that what it
[1:01:11] said
[1:01:12] no it said because you've chosen the
[1:01:15] harder way you've had two choices before
[1:01:17] you but I take the easy road or do I
[1:01:20] take the hard road and always the
[1:01:22] Christian has to choose the harder road
[1:01:25] the way that takes more sacrifice
[1:01:27] because God loves sacrifice amen and God
[1:01:31] knows to be like Christ we must suffer
[1:01:33] like Christ in order to have the
[1:01:35] character of Christ so see this is the
[1:01:38] way the Antichrist spirit work then and
[1:01:40] that's the way the Antichrist spirit
[1:01:41] will always work he'll always try to
[1:01:44] make life easier on the flesh but we
[1:01:46] know the true will of God the true path
[1:01:48] of God is always to do the perfect will
[1:01:51] of God and it's always to line up
[1:01:53] exactly a twosie everywhere every letter
[1:01:56] lined up with the Word of God and many
[1:01:58] times it's going to require some
[1:02:00] sacrifice from us amen
[1:02:02] oh yeah that's right church Satan will
[1:02:06] always try to say well if you just do
[1:02:08] this or just relax a little bit on this
[1:02:10] or don't be so diligent about this just
[1:02:13] take it easy on this you
[1:02:15] you worked hard enough you can take a
[1:02:17] little break and you don't have to obey
[1:02:18] this anymore
[1:02:20] just take a little break and you know
[1:02:22] and I know that's the lie from Satan and
[1:02:25] we've got to be able to recognize that
[1:02:27] and say God's Word says this and I've
[1:02:30] got to do this if God requires it then
[1:02:34] God's gonna give me the strength to
[1:02:35] fulfill it amen
[1:02:37] God is not going to ask me to do
[1:02:39] something I can't handle if God requires
[1:02:41] obedience he's going to give me the
[1:02:43] strength to do it and the strength comes
[1:02:45] from renewing your mind amen
[1:02:47] getting the right attitude towards that
[1:02:50] commandment praise God
[1:02:52] so Satan says well I'll make it I'll
[1:02:54] make the church closer the church will
[1:02:56] be closer
[1:02:57] they'd have to drive so far to church I
[1:02:59] like a closer church myself you know but
[1:03:02] I appreciate what God has done here by
[1:03:05] the grace of the little fleshly
[1:03:10] pleasures determine our our our
[1:03:13] decisions rather than what we know God
[1:03:16] has told us to do praise the Lord and of
[1:03:19] course we know the CAF's were introduced
[1:03:20] of course the calf was a calf can be a
[1:03:23] good symbol can at church the very god
[1:03:25] that says no symbols the very god that
[1:03:28] says don't make any image had one of the
[1:03:30] tribes carry a flag that had a calf on
[1:03:33] it right it had the the lion the calf
[1:03:36] the mane and the eagle the very God that
[1:03:38] said don't make any images had to
[1:03:40] cherubims right where he dwelt right
[1:03:42] between those two cherubs so see it
[1:03:44] takes a balance and we have to
[1:03:46] understand the ways of God and it could
[1:03:48] seem it could seem a little tempting
[1:03:51] well there's calf's there or there
[1:03:53] they've got some gold there we've got to
[1:03:56] make sure no matter what the world says
[1:03:58] or whatever Satan tries to present to us
[1:04:01] that that looks flashy that that looks
[1:04:03] tempting we've just got to do what God
[1:04:06] says we've got to find where God placed
[1:04:08] his name and God placed his name brother
[1:04:10] man tells us in Jesus Christ amen
[1:04:13] and Jesus Christ is the word of God amen
[1:04:16] so if you got any questions about God's
[1:04:18] Word or God's plan for your life you got
[1:04:21] to take it right back to the Word of God
[1:04:22] it must be found in the Word of God and
[1:04:26] it must be part of God's provide
[1:04:28] place of worship amen all right so
[1:04:31] that's just a little review there and
[1:04:32] then it said in Hosea 4:17 Ephraim his
[1:04:35] join the idols let him alone all right
[1:04:42] so that's just a little review there
[1:04:44] they set up idols and then God was very
[1:04:48] displeased remember the same thing
[1:04:50] happened with Solomon I mentioned that
[1:04:51] numerous times as we did the proverbs in
[1:04:53] ecclesiastes series but solomon started
[1:04:56] off good but then he let idols rise up
[1:04:59] in his lives with his life right he
[1:05:01] built idols to please his wife and we've
[1:05:04] got to make sure we don't compromise
[1:05:05] with anybody in our family those of us
[1:05:07] who are married we can't compromise if
[1:05:10] wife or husband as as may be a wrong
[1:05:12] attitude or a wrong idea we can't
[1:05:14] compromise with any sin we've got to
[1:05:16] stand upon the Word of God amen but see
[1:05:20] Solomon was filled with compromise as he
[1:05:22] got older he got more tired he it was
[1:05:25] more bata trying to fulfill the lusts of
[1:05:27] his flesh rather than please God even
[1:05:30] though he's seen God twice it didn't do
[1:05:32] a nut he he didn't stay close to God
[1:05:34] like he should have stayed close to God
[1:05:35] but we've got to cleave unto God amen
[1:05:38] we've got to cleave to the Lord we've
[1:05:40] got to stay true to the Lord we've got
[1:05:42] to keep running after God we've got to
[1:05:44] keep seeking God
[1:05:45] that's what denominations won't do
[1:05:47] that's why they're foolish they don't
[1:05:48] really seek the Word of God Church we've
[1:05:50] got to see God amen
[1:05:52] we've got to see God tonight say God
[1:05:54] speak to me tonight amen
[1:05:56] in your word I'm seeking your Widow I'm
[1:05:58] seeking the Word of God for my life amen
[1:06:01] see we've got to come to church seeking
[1:06:04] God seeking his face wanting to know his
[1:06:07] will asking God for revelation praise
[1:06:09] God now one time in 2008 I uh I was
[1:06:13] traveling out to Iowa just want to share
[1:06:15] just a little brief testimony about this
[1:06:17] idolatry thought and I was going to
[1:06:20] preach brother Brooks is his church that
[1:06:22] and that time they're having church in a
[1:06:23] hotel in 2008 and I've been I've been
[1:06:27] studying on this these thoughts about
[1:06:29] idolatry
[1:06:29] this was quite what ten years ago what
[1:06:31] how time flies but God knows my heart I
[1:06:35] when I flew out there all by myself I
[1:06:36] had my own hotel room I woke up that
[1:06:39] morning and in my in my mind the FIR
[1:06:42] thing I saw was the outline of
[1:06:43] everything I was supposed to preach I've
[1:06:45] never had this happen before
[1:06:46] and never had it happen since but I saw
[1:06:49] in my mind's eye I saw preach on this
[1:06:51] idolatry that that that I quickly wrote
[1:06:53] it down I went and preached it and
[1:06:55] almost everybody the church afterward
[1:06:57] was weeping and crying came up for
[1:06:58] prayer it was what a really long prayer
[1:07:00] line but at the end of that service one
[1:07:02] of the mothers came up and her daughter
[1:07:06] had gone wayward she gotten in the wrong
[1:07:10] profession and fell for a gentleman who
[1:07:12] was a sinner and we prayed together and
[1:07:14] I said based upon these you know things
[1:07:16] you've heard let's pray together we join
[1:07:18] hands and we prayed and she was crying I
[1:07:20] was crying and and we just believed that
[1:07:24] word we just believed what God had said
[1:07:25] we believe the Word of God that God had
[1:07:28] given to us that day and it was just
[1:07:30] about three years later that this
[1:07:32] daughter after being out in the world
[1:07:33] for three years
[1:07:34] all of a sudden returned back home and
[1:07:36] if she had a short hair but then within
[1:07:39] a matter of a year or so she grew back
[1:07:41] her hair out cleaned herself up and gave
[1:07:45] her heart to or was baptized and now is
[1:07:48] married to a minister and loves along
[1:07:50] with all her heart amen
[1:07:52] and that just rejoices my heart because
[1:07:55] the Holy Spirit gave me a message on
[1:07:58] idolatry and and then God vindicated it
[1:08:02] by answering many prayers amen and I was
[1:08:05] out there last time in Iowa last
[1:08:07] December actually about a year ago now
[1:08:08] from this year and one of the brothers
[1:08:10] even remember that sermon because he
[1:08:12] came up for prayer again and so God was
[1:08:15] really inspiring that in that sermon now
[1:08:16] I want to just look at a few of those
[1:08:18] notes if I can just flip over here I
[1:08:20] want to go over to that note yeah so I
[1:08:26] just briefly I don't expect people to
[1:08:28] read this or anything but I just wanted
[1:08:30] to brief a look at this but brother
[1:08:33] Graham said idolatry is a great problem
[1:08:35] today and you know the Bible says keep
[1:08:37] yourselves from idols and no eye doctor
[1:08:41] have any inheritance in the kingdom of
[1:08:43] God and of Christ that's really smart
[1:08:44] I don't want you to strain your eyes I'd
[1:08:46] have time to put this up there but but
[1:08:48] brother may have said idolatry is just
[1:08:49] as just as rampant today as it's ever
[1:08:54] been
[1:08:54] if
[1:08:55] Act is actually more prevalent today
[1:08:57] than ever has been and so I just want to
[1:09:02] look at a few of these thoughts Bramson
[1:09:03] everything begins in Genesis so even I
[1:09:06] had doubt or tregos Genesis Baretta has
[1:09:10] not changed is the same today he said
[1:09:13] the world is full of it
[1:09:14] now worship does just review this for a
[1:09:16] little bit his honor or reverence great
[1:09:21] respect honor and devotion a celebrity
[1:09:24] is worshipped by her fans and homage
[1:09:29] homage is something that shows respect
[1:09:30] or test to the worth or influenced them
[1:09:33] another you know this week I watch I'm a
[1:09:35] subscriber to the to the the Vatican's
[1:09:37] YouTube channel I don't know if you are
[1:09:39] but I wrote honestly keep your eye on
[1:09:41] the purple curtain so that's why I do it
[1:09:42] but this week the Pope prayed and I
[1:09:44] watched the video this week the Pope
[1:09:46] praying said mother Mary we pay homage
[1:09:49] to you today an homage means respect or
[1:09:52] worth or influence he said we pay homage
[1:09:56] to you and he said he said we ask you to
[1:09:58] protect our Vatican is basically what he
[1:10:01] was saying brother Graham said that's
[1:10:04] the highest form of spiritualism there's
[1:10:07] nothing more deep in witchcraft as that
[1:10:10] because they're trying to they say
[1:10:12] they're contacting God but it's
[1:10:14] contacting God they're not contact God
[1:10:17] that contacting God they're contacting
[1:10:18] demon spirits in the name of God in the
[1:10:22] name of God's Saints and so I just you
[1:10:26] know I just was reminded of that how
[1:10:28] they pay so much homage and he's got his
[1:10:29] prayer beads and he's reading office his
[1:10:32] script there you know like he does but
[1:10:35] you know we've got to be careful that
[1:10:37] that we give the right honor and
[1:10:39] reverence to the right things praise God
[1:10:42] we've got to give the right respect to
[1:10:45] the Word of God we got to give honor
[1:10:47] where honors do and that's to the Lord
[1:10:50] Jesus Christ amen now if we honor the
[1:10:53] Lord Jesus Christ will honor everybody
[1:10:55] else praise God we have to honor brother
[1:10:59] Adam says you know that message respects
[1:11:01] in 1961 he said I fear God he said
[1:11:04] because I fear God he said I fear my
[1:11:05] wife I don't want to sin against my wife
[1:11:07] he's not fear the community
[1:11:09] I don't want to cause anybody in the
[1:11:10] community to stumble he said I fear the
[1:11:12] church I don't want to cause anybody in
[1:11:14] the churches stumble so when you truly
[1:11:17] honor God and respect God the right way
[1:11:19] you'll respect one another that's right
[1:11:22] the ramesses idolatry is when you place
[1:11:25] worship on something other than God all
[1:11:30] right I'm gonna skip ahead now here's
[1:11:31] here's what I saw in my mind I'm not
[1:11:34] sure what number one was I thought there
[1:11:37] was like four or five things well I must
[1:11:39] have deleted it pardon me but the first
[1:11:41] thing I preached on was the brass
[1:11:43] serpent and that was any gift of God
[1:11:45] brother Brent and the Bible says after
[1:11:47] Moses used the brass serpent for
[1:11:49] generations and generations people the
[1:11:52] Israelites used that till finally in the
[1:11:54] days of Hezekiah it became an idol so
[1:11:57] the very thing that people used to
[1:11:59] really see as a spiritual help to get
[1:12:02] divine healing event she became an idol
[1:12:05] and so has it kind of broke that brass
[1:12:08] serpent hum remember that in the
[1:12:10] scripture he broke the brass serpent he
[1:12:12] stand he stomped on it he made it into
[1:12:14] powder and he threw it in the water the
[1:12:16] river Kidron I think it was because
[1:12:19] something that was good eventually
[1:12:21] became an idol and church you know we've
[1:12:24] got to make sure that we don't make any
[1:12:26] minister or we don't make any story of
[1:12:29] brother Branham we don't let that become
[1:12:30] an idol to us where we put more
[1:12:33] confidence in that than we do God's Word
[1:12:35] itself that's right any gift of God so
[1:12:39] the brass slipper it was a gift of God
[1:12:41] any gift of God it could be a preacher
[1:12:43] living today it can be anyone who has a
[1:12:46] gift of God
[1:12:47] any gift can become an idol when we
[1:12:49] place too much confidence in again if
[1:12:52] and not recognizing that behind the gift
[1:12:54] is actually the power and that's the
[1:12:56] Holy Spirit there's no power in a cloth
[1:12:59] you know a prayer cloth or whatever you
[1:13:01] would have or the preacher would wear
[1:13:03] and pray for it or anoint it there's
[1:13:05] there's no power in that
[1:13:07] now we respect that but it's not really
[1:13:09] that that cloth just give us something
[1:13:11] to contact praise God but the main thing
[1:13:14] we gather contact is the Holy Spirit
[1:13:16] amen
[1:13:16] are you with me Church and that contact
[1:13:18] comes through prayer amen that's the
[1:13:21] contact that's got to be made
[1:13:23] so we can't idolize you know anything
[1:13:26] else we don't want to I'll eyes anything
[1:13:28] we just want to get proper respects to
[1:13:30] the holy spirit so that's what I saw my
[1:13:33] mind I saw that and I preached the brass
[1:13:35] serpent and then the third thing I oh
[1:13:37] the Bible says that that they Paul said
[1:13:40] that they worshipped Apollo speak I was
[1:13:41] eloquent he's a preacher that never spit
[1:13:44] he's a preacher that never stuttered he
[1:13:46] never forgot the word ultrasound you
[1:13:49] know he was so smart he was so eloquent
[1:13:52] and that's obviously not me but Paul
[1:13:55] Paul was even contemptible which means
[1:13:57] the Bible said he his speech was
[1:14:00] contemptible so even though he was a
[1:14:01] scholar and he was weak in presence can
[1:14:04] you imagine a man like Paul so gifted of
[1:14:06] the Holy Spirit yet the Bible said his
[1:14:09] speech was contemptible it was least
[1:14:11] esteemed so Paul wasn't some perfect
[1:14:13] speaking scholar either although he
[1:14:15] wasn't used to be a scholar but RAM said
[1:14:17] he had to counted all dumb the Bible
[1:14:19] said he had counted all done in order to
[1:14:20] know Christ and then his bodily presence
[1:14:24] was weak so he didn't walk up to the
[1:14:26] pulpit as his big strong muscle man he
[1:14:28] walked up there real humble and real
[1:14:30] just weak he looked like he was a weak
[1:14:34] person he didn't look like a strong
[1:14:36] person and then remember he said Peter
[1:14:39] and all the ones they made they they
[1:14:41] said some say I'm of Apollo's or Peter
[1:14:42] or Paul and Paul said I'm glad I didn't
[1:14:44] baptize any of you because some of you
[1:14:46] would have said I'll baptize you're
[1:14:47] baptized in my own name oh my isn't that
[1:14:52] just like human a humanity Church
[1:14:53] how many see it in your friend they just
[1:14:56] want to worship something since they
[1:14:58] won't worship Jesus they'll worship
[1:14:59] something like I've coworkers they won't
[1:15:03] worship Jesus
[1:15:04] so they'll worship the Grinch they'll
[1:15:06] dress up like Grinch it and I've
[1:15:09] coworkers than that that they put they
[1:15:11] put that name on their on their name
[1:15:13] plate above their classroom they call
[1:15:14] themselves the Grinch they'll dress up
[1:15:17] like that they'll act like that though
[1:15:19] we're close like that they'll get all
[1:15:21] identified with that they're identifying
[1:15:23] with that but we've got to be identified
[1:15:25] with Christ amen though they worship at
[1:15:29] Halloween know that they dress up as a
[1:15:31] scary vampire something like that
[1:15:34] they're identified with that
[1:15:36] and they'll worship that they give that
[1:15:38] honor and respect they set that day
[1:15:40] aside but we've got to set aside more
[1:15:42] time for Jesus amen
[1:15:44] that's right the Bible said more as we
[1:15:46] see that Day approaching praise God now
[1:15:49] what I see often times I'm sure you do
[1:15:50] too
[1:15:51] is that people start off giving all they
[1:15:53] have to Jesus but then things of the
[1:15:55] world come in cares of the world come in
[1:15:57] and it chokes out their walk with God
[1:16:00] and the church said yeah amen that's all
[1:16:04] we know only see it pretty soon
[1:16:09] piers of the world start coming in and
[1:16:11] they no longer have that connection they
[1:16:14] no longer have that fertile ground of
[1:16:16] the heart to bring forth fruits unto God
[1:16:19] that's normally what we see you know
[1:16:22] because remember the first I'm sorry the
[1:16:25] the second ground that Jesus talked
[1:16:26] about the four grounds the second ground
[1:16:28] as it springs up really fast they get
[1:16:30] really really excited but there's no
[1:16:32] route to it right there's no route to it
[1:16:35] the Bible says we must be rooted and
[1:16:37] grounded in what love so they get
[1:16:40] excited about the word oh it's a new
[1:16:41] messages its newest news new but they
[1:16:43] don't really fall in love with the word
[1:16:45] praise God Oh church I hope you came
[1:16:48] because you fell in love with the word
[1:16:49] not because you're scared to go to hell
[1:16:51] not because any other reason but because
[1:16:53] you love Jesus Christ word Amen that's
[1:16:56] not we ought to come to church we love
[1:16:58] the word amen but see it springs up
[1:17:01] really fast and then they get offended
[1:17:03] that was the second kind the third kind
[1:17:05] it actually starts out pretty good but
[1:17:07] then cares of the world come in and
[1:17:09] choke it out and it can't produce the
[1:17:11] fruit of the Spirit oh my god help us
[1:17:18] the third thing I
[1:17:19] oh my just in my mind there just a
[1:17:21] vision just a picture of my mind I guess
[1:17:23] was brother branham is idle for many
[1:17:26] people brother Brahim said just like in
[1:17:29] the days of Elijah and John the Baptist
[1:17:31] people worshipped the the man of God
[1:17:34] they were all mistaken for the Messiah
[1:17:36] but we know every word has not thus
[1:17:38] saith the Lord from brother Branham and
[1:17:40] just to give you an update on that the
[1:17:42] jeffersonville brothers I sent them that
[1:17:44] email and I heard back from him so I
[1:17:46] tried I did my part I said I just want
[1:17:49] to keep you from idolatry I just want to
[1:17:51] keep you from saying every word as thus
[1:17:53] saith the Lord and make your brother RAM
[1:17:54] infallible cause program so that's an
[1:17:56] awful tommyrot thing to do but see
[1:18:00] that's the great temptation today that's
[1:18:02] the temptation around the messages to
[1:18:05] worship brother Branham it's either to
[1:18:07] get rid of them to speak evil against
[1:18:09] him or to worship him but Church there's
[1:18:11] going to be somebody that finds the
[1:18:12] right balance right down the middle
[1:18:13] praise God they're going to appreciate
[1:18:15] brother man under program but they're
[1:18:17] going to not exalt him above his
[1:18:19] position they're gonna recognize what he
[1:18:22] said when it was the sate the Lord
[1:18:24] they're going to be able to do that but
[1:18:25] they're not gonna worship him and put
[1:18:27] him above Jesus all their love goes to
[1:18:29] Jesus that's right
[1:18:32] amen and then I think the last one yeah
[1:18:38] the Librium said the last one is people
[1:18:40] make an idol of God himself and church
[1:18:44] this is the one we got to be careful of
[1:18:45] right cuz you and I are not gonna work
[1:18:47] sure I've never had any conversation
[1:18:49] with any of you saying well I believe
[1:18:50] every word he said was thus saith the
[1:18:52] Lord I'm willing to challenge you on
[1:18:54] that brother Jesse
[1:18:55] no one's ever Jeff everybody here's got
[1:18:58] real good spirits
[1:18:59] you would never challenge me on that but
[1:19:01] my ram says we can make God in Idol if
[1:19:04] we're not careful
[1:19:05] and here's how he does it let me see
[1:19:09] says
[1:19:20] he says many times I'm sorry many times
[1:19:23] we went to make an idol out of God we
[1:19:25] ask God to do something and then he must
[1:19:28] do it just the way we ask it or we'll
[1:19:31] say he's never answered when we do that
[1:19:35] we weaken our faith in God and I'm sorry
[1:19:38] that's so small when we do not take him
[1:19:41] at his word God always answers brother
[1:19:44] Branham says you know church one time I
[1:19:47] had a friend and they were praying about
[1:19:51] something they didn't get it and
[1:19:53] afterwards they said they hated God and
[1:19:55] church that's the that's the clearest
[1:19:58] example I've ever seen out of out of
[1:20:00] this making God an idol they asked God
[1:20:03] to do something and because they didn't
[1:20:05] God didn't do it they got angry at God
[1:20:10] now Church it's okay to be confused if
[1:20:13] God doesn't heal somebody are you with
[1:20:14] me it's okay that made me wonder and say
[1:20:16] well Lord I don't understand that it's
[1:20:18] okay to ponder and say well lord I don't
[1:20:20] know you know but we must say your ways
[1:20:24] are past finding out your ways are
[1:20:26] higher than my ways and as brother
[1:20:29] Graham said if God he said man said many
[1:20:31] times God doesn't tell me what he's
[1:20:34] going to do he said he said that's fine
[1:20:36] he said that's none of my business name
[1:20:38] how do ya know Church that's real faith
[1:20:42] in God when you can ask God say God do
[1:20:45] this please and then he does it and you
[1:20:47] say well praise the Lord God you give
[1:20:49] and take it away that's your business
[1:20:51] that's none of my business now you've
[1:20:53] got some real faith they know but if we
[1:20:58] get mad and make an idol out of God and
[1:21:01] seem to tell God well you did something
[1:21:03] wrong like brother man said you owe me
[1:21:05] an understanding he said God will leave
[1:21:07] you alone he said for a long time he's a
[1:21:09] God left over alone for I think was two
[1:21:10] weeks or two months I can't remember
[1:21:12] what Iran said God will leave you alone
[1:21:14] when you make an idol out of him look at
[1:21:18] that
[1:21:18] he said we built God as an idol he's got
[1:21:21] to answer just according to our ways or
[1:21:23] well it's just no good he didn't answer
[1:21:25] us
[1:21:26] he said God out answers in many ways he
[1:21:30] answers in peculiar ways times and
[1:21:32] everything is odd
[1:21:34] perhaps an unexpected time and that the
[1:21:36] truth unexpected place unexpected way
[1:21:40] but when he realized that it was God he
[1:21:42] held on to it see here's what Botero
[1:21:46] says this is when it God becomes an idol
[1:21:47] when our prayers become a condition we
[1:21:50] need that out at night sick or blessed
[1:21:52] so and so blessed own so do this help
[1:21:54] John do this you make God a mascot you
[1:21:56] make God some kind of errand boy
[1:21:59] God you do this you do that you do this
[1:22:01] that's not the way Jesus told us to pray
[1:22:03] he said to pray like this our Father art
[1:22:06] in heaven hallowed be your name thy
[1:22:08] kingdom come thy will be done on earth
[1:22:09] as it is in heaven but we try to order
[1:22:11] God what to do for us that's the reason
[1:22:14] the church is cooling off hallelujah so
[1:22:20] this I think was my last one as far as
[1:22:21] on that little picture I saw my mind the
[1:22:25] worst either we can do is to make God in
[1:22:27] Idol they can just a statue just do what
[1:22:31] I wanted to just do what I want you to
[1:22:32] do you're there for my benefit no church
[1:22:35] we're here for his glory we were made
[1:22:39] for his purpose praise God and we can't
[1:22:42] tell God what our purpose for our life
[1:22:45] is that's what sends people to hell
[1:22:46] right they do what they want to do
[1:22:49] instead of doing the will of God they're
[1:22:51] workers of iniquity they do what they
[1:22:53] want rather than what God wants I think
[1:22:55] it's a great thing if you and I can
[1:22:57] point to our the Bible and point to our
[1:22:59] lives and say I chose the harder way I
[1:23:01] chose the perfect will of God
[1:23:03] hey man that's a great victory because
[1:23:06] then program says you received the
[1:23:08] mystery of his will for your life
[1:23:11] hallelujah and I think that's about
[1:23:13] that's about the end of it yeah I saw
[1:23:15] those four okay
[1:23:16] thank you was that okay by God's grace I
[1:23:19] just want to pull that up from ten years
[1:23:21] ago
[1:23:21] well I've been preaching that long huh
[1:23:23] only by God's grace but preaching longer
[1:23:27] than that but anyways I remember that as
[1:23:29] I was preparing for the message now
[1:23:31] brother branham I've been listening to
[1:23:33] the met the sermon the last few weeks
[1:23:35] it's called the ten virgins 144,000 from
[1:23:38] 1961 and brother dam goes through
[1:23:40] revelation seven and then he makes his
[1:23:43] statement he said he was talking about a
[1:23:44] man who thought the 144,000 were
[1:23:46] Jehovah's Witnesses
[1:23:48] and I said yes sir but that's not the
[1:23:49] way that we're they're replaced see you
[1:23:52] called the 144,000 the bride which they
[1:23:54] wasn't they was the Jews so something
[1:23:57] like the Jehovah's Witnesses will say
[1:23:59] well there's a 144,000 of Jehovah's
[1:24:02] Witnesses and they believe that's under
[1:24:04] 44,000 of them now their numbers are up
[1:24:08] in millions and millions and millions
[1:24:09] but don't laugh at that because that's
[1:24:12] how we are we're the same way but we're
[1:24:14] not saying 144,000 we're just saying a
[1:24:17] small group hallelujah because everybody
[1:24:22] in the message the reason one of the
[1:24:23] main reasons they're attracting the
[1:24:25] message is because they know this is a
[1:24:26] rapturing message right they don't want
[1:24:30] to be left behind they know judgment is
[1:24:32] coming they can see the handwriting on
[1:24:34] the wall judgments upon this nation
[1:24:37] judgments upon this world so what
[1:24:39] attracts people is this idea of escaping
[1:24:42] the judgment and the church said they
[1:24:45] want to escape the judgment so we're
[1:24:46] very similar so so I don't look so much
[1:24:49] so bad on the job as witnesses we don't
[1:24:50] want to think bad of anybody but they've
[1:24:53] got a good thought there's a small
[1:24:54] number there's a predestinated number
[1:24:58] but only God knows that number amen
[1:25:00] it's not 144,000 who knows we don't know
[1:25:03] how many it is but there's a
[1:25:05] predestinated number and many people are
[1:25:08] gathering around this movement this
[1:25:10] message but only the elected only the
[1:25:13] four-note only the ones as brother man
[1:25:15] said in Christ the mystery only the ones
[1:25:17] that God foreknew would love him are
[1:25:19] going to go in the rapture amen oh don't
[1:25:23] you love Jesus tonight oh we need how we
[1:25:26] should love Jesus with all of our hearts
[1:25:27] amen so see they're not so far off they
[1:25:32] got a pretty good idea except they put a
[1:25:34] number on it and then they placed
[1:25:35] themselves in the place of Israel mercy
[1:25:39] and the one that was the dragon spurted
[1:25:41] water out of his mouth to make war with
[1:25:43] which was the remnant the leftovers of
[1:25:45] the woman see now that's at the end of
[1:25:46] Revelation chapter 12 that kept the
[1:25:49] commandments and had the testimony of
[1:25:50] Jesus and the bride was in glory see but
[1:25:54] RAM said the 144,000 the 14th chapter of
[1:25:57] Revelation was standing there on Mount
[1:26:00] Sinai
[1:26:01] that's exactly true having their
[1:26:04] father's name in their forehead that's
[1:26:05] exactly right the Jew the remnant of the
[1:26:08] Jews let's go to Revelation 14 you'll
[1:26:11] see another picture of this 144,000
[1:26:14] because program takes us there in that
[1:26:17] message from I'm sorry 1960 Revelation
[1:26:30] chapter 7 it's almost 60 years to the
[1:26:37] day since he preached him I look at that
[1:26:39] December 11th interesting revelation 7
[1:26:44] by revelation 14 verse 1 and I looked
[1:26:53] and lo a lamb stood on Mount Zion Mount
[1:26:55] Zion and with him a hundred and
[1:26:58] forty-four thousand having his father's
[1:26:59] name written in their foreheads and I
[1:27:04] heard the voice from heaven as the voice
[1:27:06] of many waters and as the voice of a
[1:27:08] great Thunder and I heard the voice of
[1:27:09] harpers harping with their harps high
[1:27:13] heavenly music going on that's like what
[1:27:15] remember sister Karen oh if I told you
[1:27:16] that was sister Karen said before her
[1:27:18] mom passed away last year she was
[1:27:20] sitting in the room with her mom and
[1:27:22] they heard angels singing in the room
[1:27:24] hallelujah so here people just got the
[1:27:27] Holy Ghost in Revelation 14 and angels
[1:27:29] are singing there's harps playing
[1:27:31] there's music Heaven's rejoicing amen
[1:27:34] hallelujah amen
[1:27:35] because precious and the side Lord is
[1:27:37] the death of his Saints when we die but
[1:27:40] when they get born again there's music
[1:27:41] playing to somewhere in those great
[1:27:43] heavenly realms oh thank you Jesus verse
[1:27:47] 3 and they sung as it were a new song
[1:27:49] before the throne and before the four
[1:27:52] beasts and the elders and no man can
[1:27:54] learn that song but the hundred and
[1:27:56] forty-four and four thousand which were
[1:28:00] redeemed from the earth right
[1:28:02] these are they which were not defiled
[1:28:05] with women see they live pure for
[1:28:08] they're virgins these are they which
[1:28:09] follow the lamb whithersoever he goeth
[1:28:11] these were the redeemed from among men
[1:28:14] being the firstfruits unto God and to
[1:28:17] the land I think about that there's
[1:28:19] three virgin groups on the earth today
[1:28:20] in there there's the wise virgin the
[1:28:23] foolish virgin and the 144,000 virgin
[1:28:26] and the church set program said God's
[1:28:29] always perfected in threes there's three
[1:28:30] virgin groups and and virgin member I
[1:28:33] mean it means it means no interaction it
[1:28:35] means no association no intercourse so
[1:28:38] these three groups on the earth are free
[1:28:41] from all intercourse with the things of
[1:28:43] the world they only intercourse with the
[1:28:45] word amen they only interact they only
[1:28:47] accept the word that's all they want is
[1:28:49] just the Word of God and there's three
[1:28:51] groups and you and I better be in one
[1:28:53] praise God we don't going to be the
[1:28:55] Israel unless they're somehow God's
[1:28:57] calling you back to Israel then you
[1:28:59] better get a plane ticket pretty soon
[1:29:00] but we got to be either the Wise Ones or
[1:29:04] we got to be the foolish ones a member
[1:29:06] they're only foolish to the Holy Ghost
[1:29:07] they just didn't get they didn't just
[1:29:10] die enough amen they just didn't die out
[1:29:13] and run enough but they were they were
[1:29:15] wise to everything else except the Holy
[1:29:17] Ghost but because of that Jesus said
[1:29:19] they're foolish Oh my church doesn't it
[1:29:22] seems sometimes that we need to just lay
[1:29:24] at the altar or lay at your seat or
[1:29:25] something like that
[1:29:26] how many no you just got to lay in
[1:29:28] prayer sometimes in your home you just
[1:29:31] got to die if you're not sure if you're
[1:29:33] wrestle with something how many know you
[1:29:35] just got to die out and rot
[1:29:37] amen see people that don't do that
[1:29:40] probably never died out and rot to get
[1:29:42] born again I don't know if you're like
[1:29:44] me sometimes I just got to die out and
[1:29:46] wrestle it out and wait till something
[1:29:48] changes you gotta lay there until you
[1:29:50] die out and run until God gives you some
[1:29:52] type of hope or revelation or some type
[1:29:55] of inspiration but a real child of God
[1:29:57] can die and rot and wait on thus saith
[1:30:00] the Lord hallelujah
[1:30:04] but the foolish virgin doesn't do that
[1:30:07] she doesn't die out and rot but BAM said
[1:30:09] go pray up she doesn't pray hard enough
[1:30:12] she doesn't go all the way in prayer
[1:30:14] she doesn't fully surrender to
[1:30:16] everything of the world does everything
[1:30:19] work to everything of her surrender cuz
[1:30:21] remember she's virgin to the world but
[1:30:23] she doesn't surrender everything to God
[1:30:24] and brother Aaron tells us actually in
[1:30:26] this message he
[1:30:28] the one reason she's not born again if
[1:30:30] she doesn't keep all the Word of God
[1:30:32] so she's virgin to almost every word of
[1:30:35] God but she doesn't keep a word and it
[1:30:38] obviously refers to being being uh dying
[1:30:42] to self in prayer and totally letting
[1:30:45] Christ flow into her life
[1:30:46] hey amen Oh hallelujah I like that verse
[1:30:53] three it's a song only they can sing you
[1:30:57] ever heard somebody sing a song that you
[1:30:58] know only they can sing there's a sister
[1:31:00] from New York and she wrote this song
[1:31:02] and when we went to that sisters meeting
[1:31:05] last year and she wrote a song and she
[1:31:07] was singing this song about how God was
[1:31:08] testing her because God told her to
[1:31:11] marry this man the man loved her but
[1:31:13] then the man left and she was alone for
[1:31:15] all these years raising her kids and she
[1:31:17] just kept praying for this man to come
[1:31:19] back her husband finally he came back
[1:31:21] but she wrote this song church that was
[1:31:24] about that struggle how God let her go
[1:31:25] through the struggle and every I and the
[1:31:27] place was weeping she could sing it now
[1:31:31] she can sing that song and somebody else
[1:31:32] could sing that song but the way she
[1:31:34] sings it is much more powerful because
[1:31:36] she's experienced it praise God and so
[1:31:41] see that's the same way it is here this
[1:31:42] 144,000 they can sing a song that nobody
[1:31:46] else can sing because they know what it
[1:31:48] was like to be blind and then to be able
[1:31:51] to see they were they were they were not
[1:31:53] a part of the life but then they got
[1:31:55] grafted into the life amen I was a nut I
[1:31:59] was not attached to the life but now
[1:32:00] they're attached to life you and I ought
[1:32:02] to say amen to that because before we
[1:32:04] were sinners but God grafted us into his
[1:32:07] the Holy life into the holy tree and was
[1:32:10] not a holy lobe amen the Bible says
[1:32:12] hallelujah you should look at your life
[1:32:15] and say well I was unholy but now I'm
[1:32:18] holy
[1:32:19] thank God he grafted me in amen thank
[1:32:22] God that I'm feeding off of the life the
[1:32:26] literal life of Jesus Christ I'm a
[1:32:29] branch and I'm attached by the grafting
[1:32:32] efforts of God the great vineyard keeper
[1:32:34] the vine dresser I'm attached to the
[1:32:37] life and fruits of the spirit are
[1:32:39] flowing out of my life are Floyd
[1:32:41] all these branches and I'm attracted I'm
[1:32:43] attached to his life and I'm manifesting
[1:32:46] the life of Jesus oh thank you for
[1:32:49] hearts my goodness church that ought to
[1:32:50] make us sing a song we ought to be able
[1:32:52] to sing amazing grace better than the
[1:32:54] denomination down the road hallelujah we
[1:32:58] ought to be able to sing these songs
[1:32:59] that's why I like that song holy holy
[1:33:01] holy because the Lord gave me the words
[1:33:03] to change God's not in three persons
[1:33:04] he's in one true person and I can sing
[1:33:07] that song with the new with a new love
[1:33:10] for it then all the saints adore thee
[1:33:13] he's Harley's holy and one day I'll cast
[1:33:16] my crown at his feet praise God we can
[1:33:19] sing that with with a different
[1:33:21] experience because we've surrendered to
[1:33:23] all the Word of God glory see these
[1:33:29] 144,000 are not defiled with women
[1:33:32] brother Ram tells us and they follow the
[1:33:35] lamb weather wherever they go and they
[1:33:38] redeem their the firstfruits under God
[1:33:40] and to the lamb so the firstfruits of
[1:33:42] Israel praise the Lord now like verse
[1:33:46] five the best and in their mouth was
[1:33:48] found no guile for their without fault
[1:33:51] before the throne of God look what the
[1:33:53] Holy Spirit produces Church the Holy
[1:33:55] Spirit produces you with representation
[1:33:59] what is it it's your theophany the Bible
[1:34:01] said the theophanies are there before
[1:34:03] the throne of God praise the Lord when
[1:34:06] you're born again your theophanies
[1:34:08] before the throne of God and the Bible
[1:34:09] says you're without fault before the
[1:34:11] throne of God Satan can try to accuse
[1:34:14] you a demon can try to accuse you but
[1:34:16] the Bible says when you're born again
[1:34:18] they can find no fault with you all your
[1:34:21] sins are under the blood amen if Israel
[1:34:25] is without fault before the throne of
[1:34:26] God how much more the bride of Jesus
[1:34:28] Christ right now amen oh I like that
[1:34:31] hallelujah because that shows the power
[1:34:34] in the blood of Jesus Christ amen now
[1:34:40] see his verses 1 to 5 and that's
[1:34:42] balarama mentions that he said in
[1:34:44] revelation the fourteenth chapter there
[1:34:46] you see it now isn't this interesting
[1:34:48] jerusalem has numerous mounts but the
[1:34:52] ones that are most famous or mount
[1:34:54] moriah and mount
[1:34:55] Smith's Bible dictionary I just copied
[1:34:57] this from a message I preached a few
[1:34:59] years ago I might have been in that
[1:35:00] other sanctuary it says of these two
[1:35:03] Mount Moriah and Mount Zion on the west
[1:35:07] syan is higher and more massive on which
[1:35:10] the city of Jerusalem now stands and in
[1:35:12] fact always stood the hill on the east
[1:35:15] Moriah is considerably lower and smaller
[1:35:17] so that to a spectator from the South
[1:35:20] the city appears to slope towards the
[1:35:22] east so I just thought this was striking
[1:35:26] this is just an illustration you have
[1:35:28] Zion and then it slopes supposed to
[1:35:30] slope down to the you know from the west
[1:35:33] to the east then you have Moriah now
[1:35:35] here's a here's a here's a physical
[1:35:38] picture of it Mount Zion now it's kind
[1:35:40] of a slope it's kind of hard to tell but
[1:35:41] can everybody see how it's kind of like
[1:35:42] a slope going down from from west to
[1:35:44] east here so we have the Temple Mount
[1:35:46] you have the Dome of the rock this is
[1:35:49] Mount Moriah and then you have Mount
[1:35:51] Zion Church if I was a Jew
[1:35:54] I would sell everything and I'd move and
[1:35:57] I'd move as close as I can to Mount Zion
[1:35:58] right there because the Bible says that
[1:36:01] is where Jesus Christ is going to meet
[1:36:04] with his 144,000 holy ghost filled
[1:36:07] Israelite children amen right there I'm
[1:36:10] outside the highest point the highest
[1:36:13] peak in Jerusalem that's where Jesus is
[1:36:15] going to meet with them amen that's
[1:36:17] after they've heard Moses and Elijah
[1:36:19] preach for three and a half years and
[1:36:21] after you see them killed and then
[1:36:24] resurrected and raptured and then after
[1:36:27] they see Jesus descend himself
[1:36:30] they're gonna meet Jesus right there on
[1:36:32] Mount Zion isn't a striking Church they
[1:36:36] know the physical place we don't know
[1:36:38] the physical place but we know the
[1:36:40] spiritual place we've got a meet in
[1:36:41] Christ amen brother Ham says that in the
[1:36:46] church in the questions answer 64 they
[1:36:48] say should we move out to Arizona should
[1:36:49] we be in jeffersonville Graham said I he
[1:36:52] said it just struck me I know where we
[1:36:53] got to be he said to be in the rapture
[1:36:55] he got one place to meet he said that's
[1:36:57] in Christ how do you so see it doesn't
[1:37:00] matter physically now you want to be in
[1:37:02] God's perfect will but the main thing to
[1:37:05] do is be in Jesus Christ
[1:37:08] but if I was a Jew I tell you I'd be
[1:37:11] right there
[1:37:12] nah well it was I on my the Bible said
[1:37:18] who shall ascend into the hill of the
[1:37:20] Lord or who shall stand by his holy
[1:37:22] place he that hath clean hands and a
[1:37:26] pure heart who hath not lifted up his
[1:37:28] soul unto vanity nor sworn deceitfully
[1:37:31] he should receive the blessing from the
[1:37:33] Lord and righteousness from the god of
[1:37:36] his salvation this is the generation of
[1:37:39] them that seek Him that seek thy face o
[1:37:41] Jacob sail ah who's gonna send that
[1:37:44] he'll church those with clean hands and
[1:37:46] pure hearts those who don't get their
[1:37:49] hands mixed up in in bad things they
[1:37:51] don't they don't do the wrong things
[1:37:52] with their hands right those have a pure
[1:37:55] heart they know everything they've done
[1:37:56] they've confessed that they tried to
[1:37:58] make everything right with all their
[1:38:00] heart there's trying to seek the Lord
[1:38:02] and do God's pleasure do exactly what he
[1:38:04] wants them to do those are the people of
[1:38:06] Israel that will ascend to the hill the
[1:38:08] Lord praise God now I think I'm just
[1:38:13] going to close with this because it
[1:38:16] again just shows God's grace yeah I want
[1:38:18] to try to close here in a few minutes
[1:38:21] how many remember there's 24 elders
[1:38:23] around the throne ever remember that 12
[1:38:27] of them were the 12 liters of the 12
[1:38:29] tribes of Israel
[1:38:31] so let me close with this here you
[1:38:34] probably call it and one of them was
[1:38:36] Judah
[1:38:37] now Judah I'm gonna try to find some I'm
[1:38:42] gonna try to show you the good things
[1:38:43] and bad things about these men remember
[1:38:49] Judas tribe will be saved right twelve
[1:38:52] thousand of Judas tribe will be born
[1:38:54] again
[1:38:55] I just heard brother Adam say today he
[1:38:57] said they they have no papers on which
[1:38:59] tribe they're in he said but the same
[1:39:01] God that knows the hairs on their head
[1:39:03] knows their blood type in which tribe
[1:39:06] Aryan amen hey that's the loving God
[1:39:09] that we serve amen he knows their blood
[1:39:12] type he knows which tried they're in now
[1:39:15] Judah of course he's the fourth son of
[1:39:16] Jacob and Leah
[1:39:17] it was he who suggests the sale of
[1:39:20] Joseph to the Ishmaelite traders so
[1:39:23] Judas stood up for Joseph remember
[1:39:25] Joseph types Christ he made a touching
[1:39:29] and persuasive plea for the release of
[1:39:31] Benjamin and he could be released and
[1:39:34] later of course you know because Ephraim
[1:39:37] him Manasseh Falls Ephraim farm sorry
[1:39:39] Ephraim falls he seems to be exalted to
[1:39:42] the position of chief of the Brethren so
[1:39:46] I'm just gonna go these quickly he's
[1:39:47] very successful in war now later in a
[1:39:54] later church Judah member he lost a
[1:39:56] little bit of faith remember that and so
[1:39:59] he wouldn't give Tamar's daughter-in-law
[1:40:01] he wouldn't give Tamar you know the
[1:40:04] sudden to Mary and all these things so
[1:40:06] remember when take that I'll remember
[1:40:08] that by God's grace okay all right so
[1:40:10] you remember that and then we're at the
[1:40:12] end Judas says Tamar you're more
[1:40:15] righteous than I am I remember that so
[1:40:20] see Judah his tribe is going to be saved
[1:40:23] there in Revelation here we're coming up
[1:40:24] very soon but even he himself is one of
[1:40:27] those twelve sons of Jacob and so see he
[1:40:32] admitted Tamar was more righteous than
[1:40:34] him and of course he has good parts the
[1:40:36] Christ is the Lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:40:38] David came out of Judah and Judah member
[1:40:41] we looked at that a few months ago Judah
[1:40:42] went first into battle because Judah
[1:40:45] means praise Amen so I just say like
[1:40:49] this
[1:40:49] Judah will be there with the white robe
[1:40:51] in a crown as an Old Testament overcomer
[1:40:54] praise God even though his faith wasn't
[1:40:57] even me made a mistake there at church
[1:40:59] you're going to see with all these
[1:41:00] twelve sons of Jacob all of them had
[1:41:03] failures all they made mistakes but
[1:41:05] church they all overcame by the blood
[1:41:07] they all were overcomers and Jesus
[1:41:10] exalts him and assists them on a throne
[1:41:12] right around his own throne amen
[1:41:14] oh my just because they were pure they
[1:41:18] were pure in heart and had a clean hands
[1:41:21] hallelujah he'll be there the Bible says
[1:41:23] have a robe and a crown he'll be there
[1:41:26] Reuben now Reuben he wrong does this
[1:41:29] Reubens an example of sexual sin Reuben
[1:41:32] committed sexual sin
[1:41:35] against his father because he slept with
[1:41:36] his father's concubine Billa and because
[1:41:40] of that you know he lost his place there
[1:41:44] but also he stepped in to save Joseph
[1:41:47] he's the one that actually pleaded for
[1:41:49] his life was Reuben and so church we
[1:41:51] know Reuben will be there let me know
[1:41:53] the Bible said God can wash away all
[1:41:55] fornication all adultery or
[1:41:57] homosexuality the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:41:59] can wash that all the way a man Paul
[1:42:03] said such were some of you but you're
[1:42:06] saved you're lost you're justified in
[1:42:08] the blood of Jesus Christ and by the
[1:42:10] spirit of our God
[1:42:11] amen Oh Reuben is an example of someone
[1:42:15] who struggled sexually but God cleaned
[1:42:18] out his life and made him an overcomer
[1:42:20] Hey thank you Jesus dad had seven sons
[1:42:25] seven sons of Jacob he's got a pretty
[1:42:28] good testimony I don't remember much
[1:42:29] about him oh yeah he was a his tribe was
[1:42:33] very warlike dad was a very faithful man
[1:42:34] he trained up all these war soldiers
[1:42:37] there's not much said about GAD
[1:42:39] he later were transferred his allegiance
[1:42:41] to David there in 2nd Samuel 8 but GAD
[1:42:45] will be there GAD will have a robe in a
[1:42:47] crown how many can say amen to that
[1:42:49] he'll be there Asher there's a little
[1:42:52] bit said about him not so much about his
[1:42:55] life but his offspring were powerful oh
[1:42:58] yeah he did this really good he informed
[1:43:02] his brothers of Reuben sexual sin
[1:43:04] against his stepmother Billa in other
[1:43:06] words he's the one that had the
[1:43:08] integrity to say this is wrong our
[1:43:09] brother slept with the Our Fathers
[1:43:12] handmaid that was wrong so what does it
[1:43:14] show Church he had a heart of integrity
[1:43:17] praise God he had a heart of integrity
[1:43:20] and the the rabbi writer said that his
[1:43:24] brothers reproached him but he's an
[1:43:26] example of a virtuous man with single
[1:43:29] mindedness who strives only for the
[1:43:32] general good I like that
[1:43:34] his family was so powerful look at his
[1:43:37] family he was blessed with the most male
[1:43:39] children of all the tribes his women
[1:43:42] were so beautiful the prince and I'm
[1:43:44] sorry priests and princes sought them in
[1:43:45] marriage the abundance of oil which
[1:43:48] represents the baptism
[1:43:49] because all his land possessed by ash
[1:43:51] you're so enriched to try that know them
[1:43:53] needed to hire a habitation the soil was
[1:43:57] so fertile in times of scarcity and
[1:43:59] especially in the sabbatical year Ashur
[1:44:01] provided all Israel with olive oil my
[1:44:05] church Asher is gonna be there how many
[1:44:07] can say amen to that
[1:44:08] that man's gonna be there a good man a
[1:44:11] man of integrity ray he did everything
[1:44:13] right god bless him with oil God blesses
[1:44:15] his daughters god bless his sons God
[1:44:18] honors integrity how many got integrity
[1:44:22] where you don't want to sin against God
[1:44:24] do you have that you know you don't want
[1:44:26] to take a day off and well maybe I'll
[1:44:27] take Friday night and I'll go do some
[1:44:29] simple things and I'll just apologize on
[1:44:31] Saturday morning the Bible said make no
[1:44:33] provision for the flesh the Bible said
[1:44:35] put on the Lord Jesus Christ don't plan
[1:44:38] out well I know on Sunday night after
[1:44:40] church I can go to this I'll be all
[1:44:41] alone don't plan that out
[1:44:43] don't make any provision for the flesh
[1:44:45] but put on the anointing put on the Lord
[1:44:48] Jesus Christ
[1:44:50] Asher did that he'll be there how did
[1:44:53] you Naphtali he's now all's it says
[1:44:57] about him there's not much about him he
[1:44:59] had a really good tribe but he's a Swift
[1:45:01] runner and he's the one that first came
[1:45:03] to jacob with the good news Joseph
[1:45:04] wasn't alive he was so happy to see
[1:45:06] Joseph was alive amen
[1:45:08] reminds me of those women how they ran
[1:45:10] and said Jesus is alive kind of reminds
[1:45:12] me of that but he'll be there not much
[1:45:14] on him
[1:45:15] Manasseh of course he had some awful
[1:45:17] things now he was provoked I'm sorry
[1:45:25] yeah I mean Manasseh was I'm sorry the
[1:45:29] older son of Joseph right and then
[1:45:31] that's when when Jacob switches hands
[1:45:33] and he gave the blessing to the younger
[1:45:35] so the blessing came on the Gentile
[1:45:37] through the cross of Jesus Christ right
[1:45:38] the cross hands
[1:45:40] so Manasseh represents Israel the older
[1:45:44] but having being subordinate under-under
[1:45:48] unto the younger or anything else
[1:45:52] I thought AHA died down there I think
[1:45:56] that's it oh yeah I'm sorry oh yeah
[1:45:59] now Manasseh became a steward in
[1:46:01] Joseph's house and acted as an
[1:46:05] interpretive when the letter talked to
[1:46:07] his brothers and possess extraordinary
[1:46:09] physical strength so he had a pretty
[1:46:10] good testimony actually I think I'm
[1:46:12] getting my sons mixed up there but
[1:46:15] humming oh man asks we'll be there by
[1:46:16] God's grace he'll be there
[1:46:17] Simeon Simeon the second son of Jacob by
[1:46:22] Leah oh yeah here's one he was one that
[1:46:25] associated with his brother Levi in the
[1:46:28] massacre of the sheet you might soar in
[1:46:30] the revenge of the defilement of dinah
[1:46:32] which Jacob didn't like in other words
[1:46:34] he's a violent man he got angry he got
[1:46:36] upset and he killed a man is that remind
[1:46:38] you of anybody
[1:46:39] Moses got angry and killed a man but you
[1:46:44] know he'll be there Simeon will be there
[1:46:45] by God's grace praise the Lord remember
[1:46:49] prophets remember there's something
[1:46:50] about prophets where they struggle with
[1:46:51] killing people Moses killed somebody
[1:46:53] Paul's right there holding the coats of
[1:46:55] people that killed somebody brother bran
[1:46:57] tried to shoot people and the church
[1:46:59] said everybody wait tonight I'll try to
[1:47:01] close soon stay awake here just for a
[1:47:03] few more minutes
[1:47:03] there's something about prophets that
[1:47:05] their their temperament that they battle
[1:47:08] murder that murdering spirit I'm not
[1:47:12] sure why the Bible said prophets are
[1:47:13] like hewers they were cutters so maybe
[1:47:15] that's something to do with that
[1:47:16] they're just hewers out Levi will be
[1:47:20] there now Levi was a part of that
[1:47:22] destruction of the sheet you might so he
[1:47:24] was a little bit angry too a little
[1:47:26] violent they're a little too aggressive
[1:47:28] there but Levi had a daughter jakka bed
[1:47:31] the mother of Moses and mother Bram said
[1:47:33] give all the credit for Moses to jakka
[1:47:35] bed his mother and we all know the honor
[1:47:38] Levitical priesthood Levi will be there
[1:47:40] by God's grace amen it's a car
[1:47:48] anything in there so I think he had a
[1:47:53] pretty good tribe yeah yeah and four
[1:47:56] sons who founded the four chief families
[1:47:58] of the tribe Jacob and his blessing his
[1:48:00] children before his death compared it's
[1:48:01] a card to a strong donkey so I'm not
[1:48:04] sure about that it was a prophecy
[1:48:05] concerning the tribe of Issachar but if
[1:48:08] the car will be there I don't have much
[1:48:10] on it's a car Zebulon Zebulon was
[1:48:15] blessed in fertile grounds and much
[1:48:17] Commerce so he was very faithful with
[1:48:20] his resources I mean oh Jesus says I
[1:48:22] give talents to all my servants amen
[1:48:25] he gives everybody I'm out of town not
[1:48:27] of money amount of influence and you
[1:48:29] want to be faithful with the talents
[1:48:30] that he gives you also the prowess of
[1:48:34] this this tribe here what was it again
[1:48:38] Zebulon was sung about in the song of
[1:48:41] Deborah when Deborah and the King
[1:48:44] defeated that that barrack I think it
[1:48:47] was the evil King Maric they sung of the
[1:48:49] power of istikhara I'm sorry Beulah I
[1:48:53] keep getting mixed up Zebulon so Zebulon
[1:48:56] had a good testimony this tribe had a
[1:48:57] good testimony and Zebulun will be there
[1:49:00] by God's grace and we know Joseph Joseph
[1:49:02] will have to say much about him other
[1:49:04] than he's a perfect type of Christ he
[1:49:06] just had one flaw remember when he told
[1:49:08] his brothers tell them you're not
[1:49:09] Shepherds he told him a lie
[1:49:10] he just had one flaw but we know Joseph
[1:49:13] will be there by God's grace and lastly
[1:49:15] Benjamin let's say in our feet here
[1:49:17] Benjamin there's not much about him
[1:49:20] other than he was loved of the Father
[1:49:23] but Benjamin types out the 144,000
[1:49:27] he was so loved of his father and
[1:49:30] history the Bible says after he moved to
[1:49:33] Egypt with his father he became the
[1:49:35] father of 10 sons he was so blessed
[1:49:40] remember his name is son of my right
[1:49:43] hand so he's a type of Christ my right
[1:49:46] hand and Benjamin will be
[1:49:49] despite their failures their sins Christ
[1:49:52] gives them eternal life robes crowns and
[1:49:55] Thrones do you love Jesus tonight oh
[1:49:58] amen God can God God chooses the people
[1:50:03] we might not expect let's think about
[1:50:05] that for a moment
[1:50:06] those murderers right the violent the
[1:50:10] sexual misconduct ones the ones who
[1:50:13] under rally around and get rid of Joseph
[1:50:15] had the wrong attitude God changes their
[1:50:18] hearts because they're part of God's
[1:50:20] family
[1:50:21] he changes their hearts and he redeems
[1:50:23] their life from the grave amen and then
[1:50:25] he gives him a robe gives him a crown
[1:50:27] gives him a throne to sit on Oh My gods
[1:50:31] Amazing Grace each one has the same
[1:50:34] reward because they overcame the trials
[1:50:36] of their day they were leaders of their
[1:50:37] day now the Bible says this Malachi have
[1:50:41] you come to the piano here the Bible
[1:50:43] says this 144,000 will be born in one
[1:50:47] day Isaiah 66 eight who hath heard such
[1:50:51] a thing who has seen such things shall
[1:50:53] the earth be made to bring forth in one
[1:50:55] day or shall a nation be born at once
[1:50:57] for as soon as I and travaileth she
[1:51:00] brought forth her children that's the
[1:51:02] key word their church travail travail
[1:51:08] think about today what are we travailing
[1:51:10] for what do you ever burn for for God
[1:51:13] what is it you want to see God
[1:51:15] accomplish in your life in your family
[1:51:17] can we think on that for a moment
[1:51:19] travail what are we travailing for what
[1:51:22] are we willing to pray really hard for
[1:51:26] what are we what are we willing to to
[1:51:28] bear atlast David said bare my soul
[1:51:31] before the Lord what are we willing to
[1:51:33] do that see to be born
[1:51:38] again they've got to travail for it
[1:51:40] they've got to cry out for it just play
[1:51:46] Holy Spirit rain down sir now is eka
[1:51:49] ride twelve nine I'm gonna read that
[1:51:53] these are all familiar scriptures but
[1:51:56] let's think about this for ourselves
[1:51:57] Church think about this for ourselves
[1:52:01] [Music]
[1:52:08] and it should come to pass in that day
[1:52:10] that I will seek to destroy all nations
[1:52:12] that come against Jerusalem and I will
[1:52:15] pour upon the house of David and upon
[1:52:17] the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit
[1:52:19] of grace and supplication number of
[1:52:22] supplication is a specific prayer when
[1:52:24] you have supplication for a certain need
[1:52:26] it's it's one specific request I'm going
[1:52:28] to make a supplication to God for this
[1:52:30] request so the Holy Spirit is going to
[1:52:34] be poured upon Israel they'll have a
[1:52:36] spirit of grace favor and supplication
[1:52:40] prayer and they shall look upon me whom
[1:52:45] they have pierced and they shall mourn
[1:52:47] for him as one mourns for His only Son
[1:52:49] and shall be in bitterness for him as
[1:52:51] one that is in bitterness for his
[1:52:53] firstborn in that day shall there be a
[1:52:55] great mourning in Jerusalem as the
[1:52:57] mourning of had a dream on in the valley
[1:53:00] of megiddo and the land shall mourn
[1:53:02] every family apart the family of the
[1:53:06] house of David apart and their wives
[1:53:07] apart the family of the house of Nathan
[1:53:09] apart and their wives apart the family
[1:53:12] the house the Levi's apart and their
[1:53:13] wives apart and the family of shamea
[1:53:16] apart and their wives apart all the
[1:53:18] families that remain every family apart
[1:53:20] and their wives apart so when they see
[1:53:24] Christ he's got his wounds in his hands
[1:53:27] it's gonna make them mourn and weep and
[1:53:29] they're gonna go they're gonna join with
[1:53:31] their families and they're gonna pray
[1:53:33] and they're gonna mourn and say God how
[1:53:36] could we have crucified our Messiah
[1:53:38] how could we have been blinded for so
[1:53:39] long and the Bible calls this travail
[1:53:42] travail oh and Isaiah 66
[1:53:45] they travailed for as soon as she
[1:53:49] travailed she brought four children so
[1:53:57] let me close with that by the grace of
[1:53:59] God what are we willing to travail for
[1:54:02] it's almost 2019 has God been good to us
[1:54:07] in 2018 certainly certainly but is there
[1:54:13] anything that we feel like we must
[1:54:14] travail for the Bible said as soon as
[1:54:19] she travail
[1:54:20] as soon as Israel mourns says look at
[1:54:24] that dead liquid look what we've done I
[1:54:26] feel so awful I feel so ashamed of
[1:54:28] myself hot we're so ashamed of our
[1:54:30] country we're ashamed of our family as
[1:54:33] soon as she started surveilling she
[1:54:35] brought forth and was born to camp a pit
[1:54:37] I didn't tell you amen glory they God
[1:54:42] anointed us a man because they like that
[1:54:44] with the spirit of grace and
[1:54:45] supplication to pray to have a burden
[1:54:52] for someone to travail for something
[1:54:57] because this is the time for it amen
[1:55:00] this is the time for it once the rapture
[1:55:04] goes to be no more time for writing this
[1:55:06] is the time for it
[1:55:07] [Music]
[1:55:09] praise God let's think about those
[1:55:14] things here with our heads bowed just
[1:55:16] for a moment what a scripture what a
[1:55:25] scripture as soon as she travailed she
[1:55:28] brought forth 144,000 people are going
[1:55:32] to be born again on Mount Zion what a
[1:55:35] revival service that's going to be
[1:55:37] church not goods in church it was just
