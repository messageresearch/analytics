========================================

[Music] [Applause] [Music] I feel a little bit different than ministers I'm kind of a teacher maybe slower pace for a man no there's I'll tell you what if yours is not in power and steel bar story testimony my goodness praise Lord I'll never forget that brother in fact I had a situation not quite like that but I used that same testimony and used my applied my faith to it and overcame the saying not like that but my mind will write to that testimony and I walked right through it so immense that made an impact whether that's a tremendous testimony but just to if you've heard of high before and if you ever not heard I made the effort service contact our brother here listen to what God did is God is still gone he does what he he won't see and he's always he needs doesn't matter what this doesn't matter what the situation looks like it's not real right and God can do all things so anyhow I wouldn't want to hold you too long here let me get set up here by God's grace I just want to teach on a little dog I hope everybody's bless this weekend I know when we got back from Thailand there and brother Jesse said rather we have any services like I was thinking you want me okay like I couldn't even sleep through the night [Laughter] but God ordained it that way and your play pray you were blessed on Friday night and it's not easy to all run your pastor then we passed the service after you passed it so keeps you humble and shown your toes and crying out for the Spirit of God to speak so praise the Lord bless up let's turn to John 15 by God's grace Friday night I taught on the only the only ammo had not shot out over here he prays a blessed I hope he saw the culmination of studies that God has given me through the last four or five years and how God has supernaturally placed in the word it's a I'm still kind of an all but I know we're coming to something very important we're coming to the Lord the coming of the Lord is sealed and he reveals things he I mean if you think back to maybe when you know the Prophet may have been think God was dealing with the Prophet on serpent seed and maybe the God would show the one scripture year and then one scripture year at a time then he would seek the Lord and I add it all now we have the entire study of serpent see the entire study of Godhead oh thank you hey men so now we have the entire study of all these topics and you can run on the doctrines run perfectly there's nothing quite like the Bible there's nothing by no one quite like the Lord Jesus Christ he's a faithful dog a friend in the time of need he's never failed us not a one time so let's read this here we have two fours from the Scriptures by God's grace in John 15:12 says this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord do is mine I think about the services this weekend but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I've made known unto you he was breaking forth he was revealing what he is about to do he's revealing the end time he's revealing exactly what he's planning here always on his mind the next step the next thing to strike the earth to strike his bride and why does he does this 4:16 you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and or done ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain what is he looking forward to harvest the precious fruits he said that so whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name he may give it you these things I command you that you love one another our next portion of Scripture is in John 2 verse 23 this uh this is a this will make you shudder a little bit maybe on the inside you know the Bible says to make your calling election Shore search out your own salvation with fear and trembling here in John 23 223 now when he was in Jerusalem to Passover the feast day he believed many believed in his name when they saw the miracles which he did but Jesus did not commit himself unto them because he knew all men and needed not to any should testify of man for he knew what was in man all our heads during the Father Lord Jesus we approach your throne of grace Lord humble in order pie in the token Lord we want to be seen through the blood of Jesus Christ once again this morning lord rahl we pray over you just anoint the heroes or the ears of this little study gone and Lord Jesus but we pray you anoint their hearts God Lord anoint his little lips order this tiny little mess up your Lord and when you speak to your precious children all we love you so much in the name of Jesus Christ or and I will amen you may be seated I want to kind of you know I've been this the Lord brought this message to me you reveal the to me back at the end of 2001 readjusted exact same time his wife as well exact same time and we sat through a lot of services seen a lot of things and I kind of want to and I seen the way it seems like the time has and things I went as far as we say in this message we say as far as where the emphasis is placed okay but we want to take it a turn maybe and we have I believe we all have been those that are led of the Holy Ghost that are for the Holy Ghost we need to take this turn and I guess if we had a little teaching this morning I didn't have I had but one scripture when I woke up this morning so I set my alarm clock early and God knows if that you know I'm not a morning person maybe call like a late night eagle I like to you like to eat my last kill at evening time then just kind of sit the nest and that's kind of when I get my relaxing time so I feel good at night because where were we're here at the evening time in that the Bob said there would be light here as well so yeah so I don't know if that's just how I'm built or there's morning people there's night fitness buff it nosey built each one equal teach one accordingly so so today by God's grace I'd like to teach on a prophetic class you know when we read that scripture and John 2 is said you know the God knows what's in a man as you have all received the Word of God as you've all heard the mysteries unfold you received the Holy Ghost into your souls a sealing of a filling and as you went out and you've I'm sure you've witnessed many times to individuals and how they could not catch it they could not receive it I mean that's the majority of people we deal with the saints of God we witness and there's no no effect you plead with them you show them you unfold mysteries but like I were construction a lot of times I witnessed baptism and I was rolling on a wall because it's unfinished concrete or drywall or whatever I draw it with my permanent marker and there's one time I was witnessing to a man he and uh he and I started breaking out baptism a drawn-out possibly goes Lord Jesus Christ and this and that in it and started dramatizing it was who long manual you're blowing my mind and he just endured all like this and I said man any time you'll be baptized and this gave my car gave my number and he just walked off while his mind was done did I ever hear from him again no but God was dealing with him that day yeah I just didn't speak it I drew a plane on the walls a hand and come down and started writing in the walls again my goodness so so we're dealing with the prophetic class you know God has prophets if you think about I taught a study here a long time ago on the testimony of the earth versus your testimony and if you look at the scripture you look at the types and shadows the earth goes through the exact same stages as a Christian if you look at the earth God actually chose the earth he formed the earth a certain way and God chose you and formed you a certain way and as he's dealing with that chosen world as he's dealing with you as a chosen person as I told him son or daughter whom gone what's one of the next things to take place is that the that God in order for I was like this in order for us to receive salvation the Word of God must come right and if you look at the very first thing God does is he must bring forth the Word of God and the Word of God only comes to a prophet right and according to the scripture the first one that prophesied was denied right Amen the Word of God came to Enoch he saw 10,000 Saints coming down from heaven coming down with the king they might you see that as a second cup and then after that the Bible says now after now in reality what takes place next the Prophet the Word of God cars of the Prophet the Prophet blast it out and then what takes place next if you look at no.1 the Bible said Noah was a preacher of righteousness so then now as the Prophet were blast word the preachers on the earth I would Kant would grasp this word receive this word and go out and start preaching the gospel as well amen amen absolutely and then notice after Noah then would preach the Word of God what takes place on the earth the earth repents and gets baptized see and that is the way I'm salvation okay and then of course with that baptism come to covenant a man which is what the acts 2:38 right here Missy he's so hot hot hot runs just company together events fun then fact the Lord quick of that to me there I think I was supposed to bring it forward you know so here we see is a God when he deals with a prophet a prophet is a special built man the Word of God only comes to the Prophet first right we know that at scripture here at Jeremiah wanted forces and then the word of the Lord came unto me see he says and then I wanted he's speaking now to this man the word comes to him and Jeremiah has no doubt he said why me why what about this person what about that person my daddy I maybe my brother my cousin listen I Jesus but God says before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee gotta hand picks and chooses Lou he says and there and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified be notice this vessel could not enter into force in like maybe I did vacuum in the day ladies in the eighties in the early 2000s at that I did some weird very wicked things he said I sanctified thee and I have ordained thee a prophet unto the nations she says and then said I o Lord God behold I cannot speak he's and far I'm a child and every true prophet of God does not want to fulfill the commission in fact they don't see their shortcomings how many shortcomings in Moses bring out but I can't talk him well i don't think i don't think i'm a i-i-i-i i'm not equipped for this next monday god chooses a prophet he has equipped him for they meant he was built a certain way email he says what the Lord said they say not I am a child do not belittle yourself well on this I'm not this and I'm not that for the William you Friday night you said brother that's your brother always obscenity brother that's your brother that's your brother you said brother god bless reason your crown sir no no you brother your crown you have something to do and you've been doing it whatever prepare yourself there are things coming this is I'm almost gonna say this is not a this is not going to be a five fold ministry at the coming of the Lord just a five fold ministry he says for I am a child he says say not that I am a child for thou shalt go to all that I send thee in watching all the Kamandi thou shalt speak he says be not afraid of their faces for I am with thee to deliver thee saith the Lord if the prophet he says is a special man a prophet is a man whom the word of the Lord comes to amen and don't we love to hear the word of God my goodness when I was in denomination I thought there must be more of the Word of God resistance to that where we hunger where we're just guess he's listened to John Piper I'm trying to go to churches here and there on Friday nights and Saturday nights and Street looking for the world God remember the Bible prophesied then women should go into and looking but he's in there behaved in the land not when we're a while before the hearing of aware of God amen and that's where you get so desperate you gotta crawl this and Lord show me the truth and he brought because because the Prophet is so designed life he says that his conscience and his first conscience is so close together did not go to sleep to dream his dream so as in science there's of conscious and the subconscious behind each other he says and then the majority of people have their separated and far far apart the Prophet even said I made me have to call here later he said he said he said that some of I'm here I've had dreams majority people have dreams he says for those who don't I have dreams he said your subconscious is way he's like to the back of the room but some to have dreams are conscious and their subconscious are closer together easily but a prophet he says they're so close together they can he can jump from one to the other in no time while he's a way he sees it when he's wide awake and now seen how another something God has to do see he's see what's going on he says a Prophet sees away far off way way off see the things that is coming he sees a cup of God's wrath he says floor before his field say see he can say thus saith the Lord God will destroy the city except you repent why he's an eagle he rides way up and Odyssey and he looks way off there and he's he he sees the cup of wrath poured out he goes work he doesn't he does not look at his surroundings but he can see in the future he said that's what the prophets looking at he ain't looking what's going on here he's looking yonder he's saying it's coming the judgment is coming saints of God we are at the Last Judgment there was one of Noah's Dana's what an Abraham they turn one in Christ a to the Jews in 70 AD but now we're coming to the final one of the final and last ones for us amen it's ours bride wise he says he can go so high so we can see that shade was that a darkness he said the world will be dark darkness and gross darkness didn't promise it he said he could not see past 77 he said it would go into apostasy which is a darkness because he goes up high enough the sun's shining out when he sees a shame coming he's saying what he's looking at it ain't here yet but it'll sure be here that's right is going to be here gross darkness upon the people he knows his coming years away yet he sees it why because he is a prophet of God amen no let us take him into the spirit into the heavenlies and shows him what is coming and there's a danger he's a watchman he's looking and he sees the enemy approaching him so he sees what as we saw in Ezekiel and even even was coming and edges here a man sure yes now notice John the Baptist was a prophet sure he says even want to rate the prophet of course that was born of all men as Jesus would say and notice here in Isaiah 40 verse 40 chapter 40 verse 3 he says the voice of him that cries and the wareness prepare ye the way of the Lord make straight in the desert a highway for he says our God what is this this is a major prophecy a major prophecy of a major prophet a prophet is the woo the word of the Lord comes to a man and if there is a major profit God is going to show and foretell that he's coming right so that they went that prophet gets you leaving for tell and show what's coming as well amen sure absolutely John the Baptist would this one in fact when a major profit comes on the scene strange things take place and notice once the time is conveyed all the way to Isaiah and once that scripture would been circling the earth for years and years it was waiting fulfilled and at the time of the fulfilling its wraps down and now the Spirit of God prophesized over John the Baptist in baby form here he says for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink either wine or strong drink let his commission look he sank him he is sanctified from his mother's womb amen much like Jeremiah he says and he shall be filled will not he should be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb sure this is a major profit this is someone special coming on the scene remember this is a prophetic class of people absolutely this is one of the great ones I'll say like in the scripture a man sure these are than many of the totemism shall he turned to the Lord their God and he shall go before them in the spirit and power of eat Elias or Elijah any man he was a major profit praise God but the Bible says he that is least in the kingdom is greater than this one when did the kingdom of God start in acts 2 that's when what the spiritual Israel spiritual bride now is all in the face we heard in the least in that kingdom the least of we had the least gifts the least quality or character whatever but it's still Holy Ghost filled is greater than John the Baptist Amen right sure now look at this here and isaiah 53:1 who had believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed for he shall go up before him as a tender plant oma and as a root out of a dry ground he has no form nor comeliness this is someone you will not be drawn to this is not someone that has a big wide broad silver's and most those bouncing here and there and thighs it could shake the ground that when he walked he can leap with and dunk a basketball and 3:16 all kinds of stuff went through his legs behind his back Oh anyhow he does not have a 50 inch vertical he says no beauty that we should desire here who is this talking about this is talking about our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Amos the one that was not attacked with pain and dying for you the water was not even in any form that we would desire him he's the one that shed his precious blood he forsook live here and took on the crucifixion amen there's no one like me man he's Jesus Christ the righteous the true potentate amen he's the Great when I say like that amen and notice when God Himself comes down there was a forerunner first a great man by the name of John the Baptist and then now God starts revealing himself he men he says into the virgin spouse to meant to a man whose name was Joseph Anna and the house of David and the Virgin's name was Mary and what the angel came down and said you are going to have a son yes this was a god prophet this was the god man sure this was none other than Jehovah come down into what the vessel or the veil which was the body which was Jesus Christ amen this was God the spirit out forming what a body a god body a word body to come down remember he had to come in hell arrest that's the whole plan of God in Genesis 1:1 in a meeting God prayed the heavens and the earth he created two realms why did he create two realms why not just one room I couldn't God just do it all on one realm but he had to create two realms because we had to fall if we would have fallen up there the Bible says that God is a spirit and those that worship Him must worship in spirit and truth and a bod of the spirit and he is the eternal spirit is someone full should fall of there there be no remission of sins how could God die up there he did not die so he hadn't read a specific a special room to write this love story man that's why Jesus Christ is so important once he treated us in Genesis 2 up there and gave us a commission up there and then in Genesis 2 later on he then he places what the man informed a body and put the spirit of the man in there and then now he can fall in that body because that's not a spiritual body and if we fail in our flesh God would have to create something in the fresh or a flesh man to die and make it a substitute of refrigeration but to get us back to that realm they know that's why those two realms amen so that's why Jesus Christ that's the only way to God is through Jesus Christ they know amen secession or beautiful now Lord Savior came and did everything he needed to do 2,000 years ago that's why we're sitting here today why are we not out doing the things of the world and this and that like whoever this is because what God starting dealing with us Gentiles amen but now fast-forward another nineteen hundred years there's another major move on the scene here we're dealing with a prophetic class and I lived in a law a little log cabin the picture hangs over my house today that a person painted for me in California of a little log cabin and in there this little log cabin that morning on April 6 the Midwife opened the windows so the light is shining into to show that mama see what I look like and Papa when they lived in there was a light that coming whirling through the window the size of a pillow and it circle round where I was and went down on the bed and several Mountain people were there standing there he says they were crying my people back before me were Catholic I'm Irish on both sides he's somewhere these are my people that my mother father because he had gotten away from church he says and they did not know what happened of course you know how superstitious the mountain people is oh man go to Thailand there's a light appeared out yonder in a room wonder what kind of young initially what God was meditating he was choosing or dating and sanctified there would be another problem this would not be a God's prophet Li a prophet with God in him Amen yes sure so we see little indication there now he says I was born in a poor family raised up your religious my people will be for me we're Catholic was jump here the next one till I was a little boy about seven years old on mazing how he even said seven and when I was bored he's a firstborn very peculiar thing happened in the morning when I was born and a light came in the room all of them started crying up the mountains where I was to tucky he's where I'm born went on for seven years and at the age of seven years I appeared to me the first time as a voice speaking to me and told me not to smoke to drink to follow myself in any way because there would be work for me to do when I got older this is a major problem God is now prepping the young man for service there's something he must do and God is one-by-one dealing in this man's life showing and showing the people around him that something is happening then one day at the river I was baptizing five hundred people at the river and then all of a sudden the same light that coming when I was a little boy and I was told the people pulled the people that I had been seeing it that they said that I was dreaming of some kind of mental conception that I had but before but before better than 5,000 people bedroom five thousand people at two o'clock in the afternoon in 1933 out of the skies came this cloud coming down speaking these words as John the Baptist was commissioned before forerun the first coming of Christ for ministry will forerun the second coming of Christ where thousands times thousands of people heard it in newspapers be witness to God was going to use something and yeah he'd wait a couple years and boom something wait a couple years and boom something wait a couple using something now look at this now look at this prophets here that came 19:09 or 1906 years after his ministry started he went to the hospital Aaron got examined it's just like your conscious see your subconscious is where you dream I had a physical examination here a couple three years ago by the time wave brainwave you know the doctors come and say hey you're a funny guy for some reason they eat I don't know what happened or whatever he was in the hospital he said hey let's do a little green screen on him kind of a weird little guy here and they did a little brain scan and the doctor said what he said you're a funny guy you know what's the matter he says you know what you could dream when you was why don't we and my science by instrum our technology they can figure this out because now all we're dealing with in the spiritual realm they're picking up the spiritual realm and saying just like the television goes blasting through these right here the reign of those fearful snake go through here we do not see it but they have instruments to be able to pick it off a map and now they're diving into the prophet's brain he said you're funny you could probably dream while you're why do we I said what you can scream when you're wide awake I said I said here's your first conscience and is controlled by your seven or your six senses taste smell smell hear all those things these are your first conscious is only active as long as here in the six senses so here is your subconscious said here is when when these are inactive then you go to your subconscious when these are inactive you're asleep and you go over here and dream a dream and part of you goes over there into this other area into the subconscious and if you have dreams and they've come to pass into the future he says and then you remember what your dream when you come out of your senses is he says and when you come back from here he says all conscious said then you remember what you dreamed when you was out of your senses of taste melts see smell uh feel taste smell seeing here yes he said that's the ordinary he said said that we've never seen it before both of yours are lying right here together they're examining malachi for the seventh star in the hand and the right hand of jesus christ and they're able to sighs somehow got permission and and god-ordained is in science just like that recorder was given for the prophet the bridge a man just like that the pillar of fire came down on 1951 in the camera carton you God allow the mechanical device to catch it and now God has allowed as well the mechanical device to catch what is going on in the prophets mind in the spiritual realm both of yours are lying right here together both of your time timing waves from Kant's subconscious and your other's conscious they never heard of it before my life said man you could dream a dream standing up and why do we so by size they could say you are a prophet look how smart man is getting they could sit here and examine who's got more of a gift and who done and then who would the other one not even discerning the spirit but by mechanical device man's intelligence can now discern who and who why is why is Google why is everything tracking everything you're doing and saying this and that to whatever they're breaking you down so doctor did you ever hear of a vision you said no I don't believe I ever did he says I said are you a believer he said well I'm a Presbyterian many times the problem see but that's not what I asked everybody was too easy but but that's all he said the pastor said the pastor was got some people down here every Thursday night and and all I hear is Presbyterian Presbyterian Presbyterian said I don't even go down I said did you ever read in the Bible he said I have he said together hear what the old prophets of the Old Testament went off into another dimension like that he said is that what you're talking about Ezekiel Jeremiah Isaiah Moses was caught up into that heavenly realm he said well that would be wonderful say brother branham you ought to go I said I've already been interviewed by Mayo C and says but you look at you but look do you ever dream a dream doctor he says oh sure he says I dream I said dream me a dream then go to sleep and dream me a dream he's trying to explain this to this man tell me what to do he couldn't do it you can't do it but ever you but who but ever who controls you could give you a dream of me and then you can wake up and tell it I can't do it neither so the man of God a Malakai forward walked through the world where is he what 60 56 years I think they're 55 years right around there and God would control his very subconscious be conscious and he would see visions uncontrollably he did not choose this God ordained him for this I can't do it either I can't say what is in here it's got to be him that does it and your faith in Him confirmed this word just that a woman no matter what anyone says she believed if she could touch His garment it would be it would happened now he is the same yesterday today and forever that's the only thing there is a man now you just wanted to build a foundation on coffins okay major prophets great ones Jesus Christ he obviously their God prophet the Prophet I'll take a big profit remember the Prophet here is the subconscious cuz they've learned perfectly so who is giving a visions the Prophet Jesus Christ Isiah did not choose anything the Prophet brought it to a man of God right they did not control anything they had no part in it God did everything he orchestrated he built that man like this he built a profit so his brainwaves on the subconscious date word Hartmann tap in here and this because the Prophet did not have enough time to go to sleep every time someone needed healed amen now that's issue switch over here you guys ever hear of a guy named Enoch you know who Enoch is of course you know Genesis 5 and 23 and all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years and Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him but notice here how did God take him Hebrews 11:5 by faith Enoch was translated he should not see death and was not found because he had because God had translated him for before his translation he had a testimony please God but notice how was he translated by faith this man must had the fine Wow of the most pure substance his faith must have been under the boiling hot and refined in the fire the pilot fire all those things that must been the most purest and I hope we can obtain that kind of faith but look at Enochs life here in the days of Noah and them days look at the church Nasir what were they what the church natural hmm scientists builders smart men but the elected Enoch and Noah were shepherds and farmers humble not educated not smart thank God I can fit into that category but no their God anybody we want to fit in that category everyone knows no God shall view exploits a man yes something in their moving he is calling we've got to get after that a bit and that kind of faith the enoch head looks like the exact kind of faith that everyone else now faith is a substance through faith we understand the world's frame were framed by the Word of God so God beginning before Genesis 1:1 had faith waters mountains plan a ground air everything we had around this came from was that the same quality of faith is what Enoch had if you go I challenge you to go to the Hebrew or to the Greek here and look up every one of these faith is it the same Greek word the prophecies can take more faith in this age for a body change for translation but by faith Noah well certainly that wasn't the same faith of yeah certainly Enoch I had a little bit better faith to Noah no that's not what the Bible says the exact same faith well I mean Noah's at the end when destruction was going to hit and to build this building you know there's this big big ship this boat surely the faith would be greater than Abraham see Abraham leave your mom and Daddy go start walking Abraham by three there's no evening right everything behind was exact same thing which was the exact same faith that God you see how simple this is going to get I would go this far number the story the kid the woman here as the daughter grievously vexed says he says she's crying after the disciples saying I want to speak to Jesus and the answer said I am NOT sent back to the lost sheep of the house of Israel then she came and worship saying lord help me but he answered said it is not meet to take the children's bread and cats and dogs and she said true Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall in the master's table then jesus answered to do a woman great is i you go in the praise of fair closet and God does an answer go back and he will answer because what at that time you go back in a persistent and keep diligently seeking God that faith will become grateful and there's had a certain man at Lystra is impotent in the feet being covered from his mother's womb it never had who never had walked the same heard paul speak who steadfast if you holding proceed again faith to be healed that faith is the exact same faith that created the heavens in you the same faith that caused the body change did not a change his body Oh Oh God the only reason that these New Testament warriors these disciples those in between X 1 here the purity from 33 to 53 the reason they did not take a rapture is because it was not the time same thing for years it was there and they had to save and we have the scene all's you have to do is get all underneath that all things are possible amen now notice Abraham Isaac and Jacob the Bible says he blessed Israel because he loved my father's why because he saw faith in Abraham he's also faith and Isaac and Jacob may not so much faith in Jacob they what they hate for the name change he meant it meant prince with God sure now we could hear where we at then brother now noticed here now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father long the priest of Midian led the flock to the backside desert came the mountain of God even the horror so here he is he's being a shepherd the great prophet Moses was being a shepherd let me place you can I place you this morning what's going on here leave it in the message help 50 some years to the promise of the scene Moses know intellectually by his godly mother our beloved sister jochebed he heard her teaching in the intellectual manner you are the Brian you're going to take a rapture by faith everything's him you are the Enoch of this way you are the last group how that his life isn't spared from the crocodile how that God had made enough I'm a proper child o mine and he was born for deliverer and now and how had Miriam his sister in the prophets they had followed him down to the bathing beach where Pharaoh's daughter was bathing and how that God had brought him up and nurtured him right in the house of Pharaoh and huh and how he's going to deliver the children now intellectually he knew that but what did that produce we know that produce a dedication intellectual not do it the brine that's into lecture whether they go to the priests like this mortar denomination creature right now God loves everybody we're all God's children what is the message preaching role the bride Rob right are we all the bride intellectually people know that oh don't miss a church you might know it from the word standpoint you might know that the Bible said the prayer of faith shall save the sick but you pray until God says the prayer may save you then that's the difference this is more just new intellection that he was a deliverer who knows intellection to the bride we all do he said but when he thought that surely they would understand when he would snow the Egyptian the first little rumor come up come up and he wasn't perseverant at all when this squeeze is we're going to pray we're going to speak the word and think of it intellectually we know that but you let a really no real pressure fall upon you everybody won't draw attention trial here yeah those are prepping you for this that hand is prepping you or something right you know there's nothing about the word man you know this natural realm is not real right how many testimonies went forward of the healings of God doing this God doing that saints of God keep those things in your remembrance those should be feet building things he took for the desert because he wasn't persevered he wasn't too sure he just known it from the word a standpoint the promise now there's a difference between I was actually this week ended running Jessie if it would worked out I preached on Saturday morning I was going to preach on prayer and you know what we can pray all we want but if you do not have see back in your prayer if you ask a miss and hopefully pray but I'm talking praying and knowing that God has done what you requested you can pray all you want but if there is not fee that is what you need that if there is a goddess place of desire in your heart for loved ones for your healing for this and for that if he is place it in your heart it's not and you feel it burning on you and you cannot escape it pray and believe it's gonna happen because it will I don't know brother Jesse knows this 1995 I graduated high school that screen fall of 1995 I start college in defiance and the first thing I told my my my roommate at that time I said you watch when my brothers are smears on over in station and I told him that year after year he's alone and what they do they wouldn't see change and after they won the state championship in fact I'm going to his wedding this March I said Dave you remember when I told you this listen yes I just knew it was going to happen and I started speaking it and it happened power of your confession but notice that same champion had nothing to do with me I wanted that for my brother believe what you believe what you say that's so Carlos I mean it's what I wanted I wasn't a Christian then either I live like a devil but I believed it was going to happen figure that out there's no mystery paradox for you just reach out on Wednesday night I'll be listening Rosie he says but one day after all this intellectual preaching of Moses he knew he was called for this he knew he was the man he knew he was they were the people for the day but one day he saw a bush there was a fire and it was burning and it could not did not consume so Moses took and went up on the mountainside is studying the back bush that was the big pillar of fire was led to him the rest of his days see these things of God until the Holy Ghost comes out in reveals it to me that's when things that's when he cannot be stopped it's too late now Moses could say I've met God I met the pillar of fire I am going down to Egypt amen notice the difference now here's something for you it was Moses who lived peacefully marrying the sheikh of the midians daughters a poor and while he was out there herding his sheep one day on the backs of desert there the familiar old path he was walking down herding the Sheep notice doing something simple he's an at peace Israel was in bondage under slavery and he was thinking on his ways this is not my job as a sheep herding God called me to be a creature how do I know that I'm not preaching to a Moses this morning are there any Moses is here that's out yonder and a steel factory or now here at the pulp Factory don't ask what that is as our yonder driving a truck somewhere that God hasn't commissioned you to save souls instead of doing it you've got a job to make your daily bread living at ease help me Lord and thousand souls bearing into destruction you know how I do not know how I'm preaching to a man or a woman that's called to the mission field and yet you're selling that birthright for a morsel bread come to yourself think on your ways y'all teach to myself here this morning now let's continue to move on a lot of God's man have been simple people right shappers herdsmen a notice God's Commission to ally job he said go do this he says go do that he says a go grab Elisha he's going to be prophet he's going to be prophet in thine room showing a part of this and found elisha the son of shaphat who is hiring with 12e yoke of oxen to form and he was with the 12th he was just doing a simple task and a prophet sent elijah god was training in - rope - to what house three feels the strait rails why because he had to stay with the word of god he was to lead the twelve tribe of israel as a prophetic realm amen God was training him in the natural but remember he was just a farmer a simple farmer I die where are you going with this you ever think about dream teams just you know about the bash brothers can you hear afresh me you know in the world they had dream teams like great dynamic duo's like you have Jordan hopefully W go right I'm sure you roll the word label to see them hey hey whatever fade away right we have to take on Maguire I've asked for this bird McHale the 1992 basketball limping team Brady Bill attract they say now Montana right he's our dream team these are groups of then they were placed together through whatever means and they performed wonderfully wonderfully in fact they become legends because of who they were associated with two good ones put together and man they were just unstoppable or whole team you let the 1992 an amazing I never be duplicated carnally when's the tournament but now go back to the scripture memory told on Friday night on Ezekiel remember the open book had come down at the time of the open book we are done right there's nothing left God now reveals corruption in the ministry at that time of the revelation or the revealing of the corruption ministry now it is time to pray right and God says in Ezekiel even if I would put together a dream team and the Lord of Lord came and me saying son of man when the land sinneth against me by a trespassing grievously then will I spread forth my hand upon don't break the staff I'm rather up and we'll send famine to little comedy and though these three men this dream team but woe three two hundred and twenty years only his family saved that's by faith Daniel rips news trying to stop he said bring on the life I'll sleep right here job lost everything as the proper said he was given up honey go we was given two we will be right II lost every yes in God's East he said bring my best boys you set them in this day bring these streets in the days of the open book and let them do their jobs let them do what they did back there because if they're alive today and if you do the exact same thing because what's more ya know what's right here that's the dog bring a dream team down here in this age though these tree mana know damn well don't read they should deliver with their own Souls by their righteousness saith the Lord they wouldn't be to do except see himself right name ow please Noah the creature of rice in the days don't book could not save anyone welcome to Leila see right right how many souls we wait to see how many it sold to be witness to don't worry Noah could do any better than you Daniel could not do any better Joe could not do any better cause of you amen in the days of the open book I dream teams though these three men he says it three times though these three men were in it as I live saith God said I am a witness they would be able to do nothing more than save their homes cells saith the Lord God they should deliver neither sons nor daughters they wouldn't be able to save no would not even be able to do what he did before his three sons and his three super daughters in-laws they only shall be delivered but the land shall be desperate decimals saints of God this is an individual fair this is not Jewish time this is Gentile delivers time God deals with individuals the Prophet said he said I'm I know you're going to hate this but remember the revelation of Jesus Christ was only given to you not the rest of the title even John but it's only to be of God only God have mercy on me not a person or if I bring a sort of hung land and say sword go through the lands like aa man and beast man though these three men were in it as I live saith the Lord God they shall deliver neither something out for the show only deliver themselves you look at themselves brings a dream team down and they can't do anything that's how evil this agencies that's how wicked how dark it is remember in the days open book no our day is supposed to be partly know as if days Noah as a days a lot right but we never seen lasting he has no idea the amount of insanity is these men have never seen a combination of both of the most wicked times I remember these three didn't have the Holy Ghost four times though no and Daniel jail for in it as I live saith the Lord God they should deliver neither son of how they shall be divided live of their own souls by their righteous why is it a more time because there's four things of judgment come oh my now let's continue on here don't want to train this horse study is to transition something you okay we've been dealing with major prophets I'm talking serious men oh god bitters they can catch the light their way I mean God set them designed they had no doubt who God was and who they were and the God was speaking to them and that this was God and I me and we have something here and no one else can figure out sigh I feel like a weird strange person here I'm different I'm a what a prophet let's read this here real quick now the thing that we're talking of the question is this should men or should women do that's exactly what started the church in its chaos at the beginning they had taken all the solemnity of the from the audience and placed it in the pulpit do you see what's happened in this message the minister is the great one remember this is the most important is the word and it is what we remember who you what is this vessel he was supposed to do here assistant minister what is he supposed to do he's supposed to Lord show me him give me a thought he gets the thought don't we put it together for me okay snapped and then now I must deliver it to the most precious people on the face very this person standing here is there's nothing about he wants to be here this guy is already heard what he's talked back here he already heard this hearing those was what is in his mind well God is showing right hearing it but it's not working this is not to exalt any figure up here God is a God of the audience the fivefold is only this look at the portion what percentage of the body is is thus canvassing the Prophet the Evangelist the apostle the pastor of the teacher now how they use it right what portion of the book I mean my personal body is the most important part because when I still might hope that hurts when I sprain my ankle this really doesn't do I mean it helps but you need every portion of the body off everyone is equally important or in that and the Papa said why because the women will have a greater reward on the other side what if let's just pretend what if the woman have a greater problem in the men because they had to live and dress a certain way in this way today who is something I said who is the great one who are the little ones or should be the little ones should be the minister who are the great ones then you guys this is for you and what does the devil do he pushes pushes you under his thumb and says the man is the great one the movie stars the rock stars of the message is the minister's no this is for you that's exactly what started a church in his chaos at the beginning they had taken all the solemnity from the audience in place in the pulpit but God is the god of the audience see he works in every human being he lives in every heart they can get into he finds those tempted people who's that tough he says he prays the gifted people and works through them what does he mean what is he saying let's read further now if the devil can't catch one of them things one of them thing and then he runs out comes over here and makes a big conglomeration nothing nothing it runs the people way like Paul said when we come together if you speak return he send the unlearned comes in and st. and said you're crazy foolish somebody's speaking in tongues and this and this on all of everything he's that won't work but he said if one prophesized that revealed the secret of the heart then they'll say truly God is with you what gifted purse he's talking about those gifted with the nine spiritual gifts of the ferryman which is supposed to be new in the audience how many messengers creatures have fallen from the mess I walks administer the Holy Ghost by the enthusiast seat of God all right until eventually I have heard the greatest minister I have a hurt and tied this message boy I mean wet I said it several times nice and wet because it is so beautiful you know he's in right now divorced wife remarried in town and now he's wandering around the world doing you can write the greatest minister I've ever heard as far as being able to tie the scripture together right amen you know that shakes me to the core that text every time I think about it I check myself yeah is this real absolutely yeah he said but if one speak with tongues by a revelation he gives the interpretation of somebody to the MFI to edify what the minister no the church then the whole church has edified by it see this is for is for the entire body amen it's all walled it or not at all it were divided what does that say if you're dividing you can be conquered and if the clergy divided from the laity the conquering coming or has conquered something that will speak and God will speaking in languages and nothing no nothing about it will give to one interpret by another one and say a certain thing it happened just exactly the way I said the you got the Spirit of the Lord among you saints of God we wanted the promise that there will be a church with nine spiritual gifts operating in the local assembly a man look it up look it up and according to Damon Church it out be sure let's keep that he says oh let's strive for that friends the Prophet that there's one called prosody I love them to see a church with all nitrogen gifts operating in the local that's going to be a clean shirt you're gonna sit watching the Rubies of the church will call the domestic or I'll go into the church the pastor called out moves into the church to investigate the pastor the church was a revival seeing how dark a clean you up and when you're leaned up when he sees the character was in you then he can start it when he can trust you if we can't control her mouth now how about what you didn't invent your own clock will you be so yielded you'll come out of it say what did I say what happened hope it's alright today Ephesians four or five he said now he that uh sorry Peter four and nine now me that a scented what is about what it is what is it but that he descended first into low parks Europe you know he's right he says he that descended the same that also a son far above all heavens that he might fill my knee and fill all things and he gave some pastors not everybody's message gonna have a pastor some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and some teachers not every Assemblies going to have a teacher not every assembly is going to have an evangelist II but he gave some what were these holding these gifts these fivefold gift for well who was it for these are gifts what does it gifts given to and say like this whose most important the person receiving the gift or the gift itself if God gives somebody a gift the gift it's mine it was for the person is the person for the gift for the gift for the person a good pastor is he says is a love gift to the church a prophet is a gift to this humbling a teacher the gift for the assembly these are gifts for you for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry you for the edifying of the body of Christ the body of Christ this is for you everything is for the blind the lay of t the audience it is for you to we all come in the unity of faith and now the Christ see man behold I send you wait whose use that is that the fivefold of this day that is to the body of Jesus Christ that is to the bride of Jesus Christ and Popples go absolutely need all that I'm not saying we don't need it if we need all that but we it you includes all the bride now let's start wrapping up here man out you know now here's what I'm going here's here's actually the scripture that I actually started with you the words of Amos who is among the herd men of Toccoa and he's all concerning Israel the days of uzziah the king of Judah and the days of Jeroboam the son of go ask king of Israel two years before the earthquake so two years before the earthquake what happens and he said the Lord will roar from Zion ties right into Revelations 10 roars out Christ's coming down here oars the seven thunders this is this right but notice Amos that were Tacoma means a trumpet he was in the time or the herdsman or the Shepherd's in the time of the trumpet shout voice Trump at the last time for the last hour at the last right before the coming of the Lord this is his location and notice directly after that the earthquake hits but first the Lord roars out of Zion a trumpet and the Prophet always said if Amos was here what do you think he would do he would stay with the word that's what he would do you know what he would tell us where we've been taught off the foundation of the original Word of God he tires were far away from the first Pentecostal church I felt the whole point of mankind for was he said get back to prayer pops why do I send you Elijah the prophet the turn are the hearts of the children back to the APIs on table which was Pentecost amen so if anyone is a true minister he will point back if Amos was here about the spirit those on Amos it is in us amen he would try somewhere far away from the first Pentecost of Scripture hey man way ourselves remember Pentecost is original there is no other way and notice what also camps here in Amos Amos 3:6 buna shallots probably blowing the city the people not be afraid fella tree evil the city and where and I've done it sure the Lord God will do nothing but you reveals his secret unto his servants the prophets the law have Lord who will not fear the Lord has spoken who can but prophesy but remember the lion is going to roll out of Zion kind of classy you win Saints think about it look what liquid Amos says here he goes down then he starts blasts misery blast him and blasts them and looking first twelve and Emmas aya Amaziah said of the Amos oh thou seer he calls my prophet though they away through into the land of Judea and there he threatened prophesy there he said but promise I not again Norway Bethel or the house of God we don't want you in our apartment here at the house of God you're not welcome anymore but if Amos was here he would put him back to medical they matter and look what the Prophet says then answer name said I was no he did not have a cane jewel come into his room of his birth and say well what is going on here what he was seven years old he did not hear a voice as if this is that and he was baptizing 19 whenever I was mad no boys chained here and said he will bring forth joy he said I was no prophet neither was i have prophets son are you catching this are you touching what I'm trying to lay down here before you he said when I was a herdsmen and gather of sycamore fruit and the Lord took me as I followed the flock and the loads of me girl prophesy unto my people Israel he was just a simple shepherd a farmer a hunter-gatherer if you will and God hand-picked it brother you brother you is that possible it happened and I screamed today is it was a great prophet long ago Amos when he come down come down to that see he said I'm not a prophet he's nor so the prophet but if the line was new you are the bride of Jesus Christ and if you were around the lion on this stage how can you not with prophesy he might talk to me seems to me he said when God speaks through the prophesy he predicted judgment upon the generations of the very God you came to serve will destroy you man now put this on tape you remember the very God that these people is getting all of this great big Horace the World Council churches just a Jessica sent back here the Trump is gathering their gathering now again and you're going to have to do go into it you can't say that I'm really going to be individually get get out in it or you're going into it there is no going to be no middle ground khakis into your mind remember the story about the man in the in the field and there's a fence and God was on this side and Devils on this side and the man's looking at God or some god I don't want god too much thanks look the devil make that guy's really really simple and I don't want to hit him but into both fields in the world there was a fence and the man said he's an intellectual just heart and he said he said you know what he says I don't want to be in his view I don't have any hate you I'm just going to get up on this fence and sit on them all right about it loophole what I want right all right then Jesus Christ from those two a friend why don't you come on this side let's go let's go follow me compiled a beam and jesus walks off and the answer's no I found I found the seat ground the devil comes up to us in stairwell just these two on this side you know this matter why don't you follow me I'll tell you what I'll show you some the city I'll bring a key to the city god I'm shaking I'll make you a big man's net for the man to know if I'm on the fence that's the devil walks off to me the man's thinking man I got it all figured out Henson's is actually the genius I'm quite a first person in history to figure this out I have a couple of hours later devil come back hey aren't you coming the guys like no I think I pick my spot well don't you know that I own the fence so you can't dirty there's coming over time you try to ride the fence a devil in the fence hey men now let's wrap up here I don't want to keep you too long here now look at this here Jesus Christ came down Houdini pick there was two major denominational organizations that time the Pharisees and Sadducees and what God came down he chose two fishermen here two fishermen here they're not clergy he picks a tax collector named Matthew calls Philip and Nathaniel he rounds up his dream team here he's got 12 warriors he puts them through a little test he says about to destroy devil Kingdom they were tearing it up right you know that dream team those eleven disciples were so important that they were actually prophesied all the way back in the book of Joel a bunch of nobodies they were not religious leaders they did not know the Bible and could roll the scrolls and put a pin right there that they were shut they were simple men they were tags me oh my but God hadn't picked him why because God knows what's in a man [Music] alright let me tell you something when I saw this quote it blew me away the Alpha the Omega is the same he said I am Alpha and Omega what was the Alpha ministry Jesus Christ come down in his church pure for twenty years he never said anything in between I'm talking pure God what will you produce has the omegaco already where is the church with nine spiritual gifts where is the church operating fully under the Holy Ghost like we want to see brother like we want to see like we know what we're going to see like the book of Acts absolutely no tanking of man made anything he never said anything in between uh-huh I am Alpha and Omega that first and the last Luther was not Jesus Christ ministry that was not the Omega Wesley was not the Omega Azusa Street was nothing left oh my god our messenger was not the Omega the Omega is coming it is coming for a body movement it is a jolt to warrior in town is it soul to movement where God comes into his children and the Bible said there will be an army like there never has been or ever will be it will be us a man by the grace of God amen now continue on he calls it the great masterpiece of a family the second Adam in the second Eve now let's continue on here I want to close here by other because race putting finest pie here I want to show you this too why are the majority or a lot of message churches dead I'll say like that and what we from what I hear how can the Holy Spirit possibly be organization when it is organization that takes the place of the spirit the problem said this message will never do nominate it doesn't need you but if there's an organization of men or ministry it actually pushes the spirit out sure they don't need to change one quote they don't need to change one scripture but if they can just get the Holy Ghost out of the system and then once the Holy Ghost is out of the system now a denominational spirit can come in and replace the word of God but while the Spirit of God is here nothing can change the word because we call now ting that a man sure now let's just read a scripture here in first name there 16:7 I'm sorry I'm just phone winning teaching this teach on the kitchen tables two to three hours fit this heart so sorry but now notice daniel has come to pick the chosen king the chosen one and by his own intellectual looking at the natural physical pure istic so the man LEM come to form and surely the Lord's anointed is before him but the Lord said to Samuel look not on his countenance during the height of the stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as Nancy for man looketh on the outward appearance of the Lord looketh on the heart can you handle this last movement will you be so humble and so weak it's so metal holding those that God will use you in his last Amen let's continue on here remember Christ is the church Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts okay we're closing here he knows as a people can get the true revelation of the true church how does the child is a true church operate really we'd have to go back to the scriptures we'd have to search the message oh co d well as you can dig a lot deeper than that and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the great work she would be an invincible army but what is this if they get that revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian Church and by God's Spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit seats will be posted for him he will be as definitely Thor today as when Christ was stood as every effort in to gain power room in the desert and how are we gonna do that there's Christ forty days fasting fasting no food forty days without food God in flesh now all power is accessible you can speak this speak that I think this business is he couldíve this Hubble tell the devil get behind me but what does he use he uses the Word of God the very scripture itself amen you will recall that I mentioned at the beginning of this message that the boat we are trying to try studying is the actual revelation of Jesus himself you may stand now they're stretched a little bit by God's grace wave them arms shake the legs a little bit sorry I'm long-winded you on that's right you know when the termites are same where I come from is living waters taverley Tabernacle we call LWT long-winded technical so we were the long services and long studies this is for long and drawn-out my goodness now he says he says the book were standing here is the actual revelation of Jesus himself in the church and his work in the future ages that I mentioned that it takes the Holy Spirit to just give us the revelation or we will fail to get it bringing these two thoughts together you'll see that it won't take just ordinary study and thinking to make this book real as this would become more real to you this weekend and on the Bible it is going to take the operation of the Holy Ghost plus the Holy Ghost plus the noise of man oh yo thanks for woolly dog that means the book can't be revealed to anyone for the special class of people it will take one a group of people let me go to the audience one with prophetic insight well what about these great prophets saints of God we're dealing with the last prophetic group where the Eagles be there where the carcass is there will the eagle's be what is Eagle prophetic site they'll be able to see exactly that vision is necessarily but they'll be able to see the word just it's clear that it will take one with prophetic insight will require the ability to hear from God it required supernatural instruction not just the student comparing verses verse though that is good but the mystery requires the teaching of the Spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open to community to the spirit to hear and to know it is the revelation of God that will give you authority over the devil let's jump right I just want to look at this here one of the evidence of the Holy Ghost but God hath revealed to us by his Spirit for the spirit searches all things yay is that it is that all of it no but that's important God will continue unfold beefer and what to make it more clear and clear the Word of God let's bow our heads dear how the Father Lord forgive me Lord for being so long and drawn-out lord I just bless the people god I pray Lord to you edified them Lord God I have no part of this law but Lord just you just gave this is what you gave in going on and go we love you so much you're less every soul and pushing way out god lord I pray Lord their faith is increased God know just like Enoch needed faith Lord for that lift off God or the exact same faith God we need for healing just the exact same faith we need more when we pray God notice all we need is that simple and hyssop blowing out that simple common faith is still enough to make a wraps for this day got a Pawnee chief don't bless the people God really understand everything God if I send the wrong order you know named Jesus Christ being man phase of God I hope you were blessed today I hope the word opened up a little more a little bit clearer to see how accessible disease the rapture is going to happen we are in this season of the open book which is when the season over acid takes place we're here God or that's all only believe that's all you have to risk in it the only way you can and can get hard as hell able to keep the Baptist of the Holy Ghost I believe invite all baptized in Jesus Christ we have to worry about that but if you ever need this point Jesus Christ is here he said works are Caryatid in this year Rd and they may so if you need prayer for anything all your heart will pray which one of us may claim it what what kind of song we have is Jessica from just wanna worship God's a little bit
