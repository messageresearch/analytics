[27:31] here we'll get right to the word of god
[27:33] here tonight
[27:46] okay so let's look at part three here
[27:47] we've been looking at uh the mystery of
[27:49] the church composed
[27:51] of jew and gentile
[27:55] i think if it's okay uh let's see can
[27:58] you switch over let's see if i got that
[28:02] uh so i've been in the little time i'm
[28:04] not studying i've been building this
[28:06] little website
[28:07] on my personal website
[28:11] and so this is the mobile version but
[28:15] defending jesus's message and messenger
[28:17] there's a little tab here at the top
[28:19] uh if you go to books
[28:22] uh i gotta fix that but anyways there's
[28:24] the first book you can click on that
[28:26] and then the second book if you click
[28:28] here um
[28:30] i just want to update the church here's
[28:32] what i'm building so i'm building
[28:33] each chapter will have a link and you
[28:35] can click on the uh
[28:36] on the link here it's like let's say
[28:39] we're writing on the jew gentile
[28:40] it'll scroll down to that chapter and
[28:42] then i need to put the pdfs in here
[28:45] where you have all the brother rams
[28:46] quotes
[28:46] you have the bible scriptures i'm going
[28:48] to put a video in there
[28:50] you know just introducing the topic uh
[28:53] let's see oh yeah and then they can
[28:54] listen to it as well
[28:56] and then there's just going to be a
[28:57] button there you can click return to the
[28:59] top it'll scroll back up to the top
[29:01] so that's kind of what i'm building in
[29:02] my free time there i'm kind of building
[29:04] that
[29:05] free and if there's anybody that needs
[29:06] anything you know they'll be able to get
[29:07] it there
[29:08] uh by god's grace i'm trying to think of
[29:10] what else i've been working on there
[29:12] i think that's it let's see any other
[29:14] things i've been building there
[29:16] uh yeah if you if you didn't know i've
[29:18] been doing a little blog post
[29:20] um to kind of keep you know my
[29:22] subscribers
[29:23] updated so i just character and
[29:28] larkin i just kind of you ever want to
[29:30] share this with anybody
[29:32] and then for the message page i got um
[29:35] all the videos that teach brother grant
[29:37] well i just got one right now
[29:38] brother branham's message uh so i have a
[29:41] page for the message which is the bible
[29:43] revelations and then the messenger
[29:45] this is where i got most of it on uh
[29:47] defending them against believe the sign
[29:49] i'm defending by the graham against
[29:50] believe the sign there's our debate
[29:51] video
[29:52] uh and my video is defending brother
[29:55] branham against branham tabernacle
[29:56] can you imagine that i'm defending the
[29:58] prophet against his own home church
[30:00] but he said that he said this tabernacle
[30:02] will lose its strength
[30:04] i found another vision brother brahm
[30:05] said uh the holy spirit told him the
[30:07] branham tabernacle won't eat the bread
[30:09] of god
[30:09] i found that quote that's from 1946.
[30:13] so god told him well in advance that the
[30:14] tabernacle was going to not accept the
[30:16] bread of god
[30:17] and that they would lose their strength
[30:19] so i have all those links to the videos
[30:20] there and then i have proof that william
[30:23] branham was the message
[30:24] those youtube links there you know so
[30:26] i'm just slowly building it that's kind
[30:27] of what i like to do in the
[30:29] free time there but the main thing is to
[30:30] get that book out because it's coming
[30:32] out here
[30:33] in a couple uh about a month i think
[30:35] i'll
[30:36] be out in about a month there okay thank
[30:38] you i just saw that update that um
[30:42] and let's get into the word of god here
[30:44] tonight i'm gonna set a 45 minute timer
[30:45] i'm
[30:46] really going to try to keep it short we
[30:47] got here a good time tonight
[30:49] and i want to be faithful with uh our
[30:51] time here
[30:52] so we look let's look at part three of
[30:54] the mystery
[30:55] of the jew and gentile church one church
[30:58] composed
[30:59] of both you and gentile let's pick up
[31:01] where we left off it can i get my
[31:02] readers there
[31:04] by god's grace uh yep nature too okay
[31:06] living malachi nature and haven okay
[31:09] we'll get some readers there get your
[31:10] bibles here let's go with lydia hosea
[31:12] chapter 2
[31:13] malachi romans 9 24
[31:17] and nature do you want to get jeremiah
[31:19] 16.
[31:21] so we ended last week looking at the
[31:23] prophets who foretold
[31:25] that god would take uh the gospel
[31:28] to the gentiles right that's kind of
[31:31] what we looked at last
[31:32] week so let's look at that again uh
[31:35] today and we'll finish up i think there
[31:39] was
[31:39] uh numerous prophets four old testament
[31:43] prophets plus
[31:44] the god prophet god himself foretold
[31:48] that god would share this glorious
[31:50] message with us
[31:51] amen not church just imagine your life
[31:54] without this message what would your
[31:55] life be without jesus christ
[31:56] with no promises no covenants no
[31:59] blessings
[32:00] or be an awful existence wouldn't it uh
[32:03] we'd probably be like those drug
[32:04] addicted people out there on the streets
[32:05] right
[32:06] just roaming the streets or just you
[32:08] know or you know
[32:10] house to house all kinds of evil things
[32:12] the world does

[34:36] called to be his people do you hear
[34:38] god's calling praise god

[34:41] should hear god calling us to serve him
[34:42] calling us
[34:44] to love him called to follow him as his
[34:47] dear children
[34:49] uh nature could you get uh
[34:52] jeremiah 16 verses 19
[34:56] 20 and 21 jeremiah 16
[35:00] 19 20 and 21
[35:06] beautiful scripture here jeremiah
[35:08] prophesies of the gentiles coming to
[35:10] know the true god
[35:12] jeremiah 16 19 20 and 21
[35:28] refuge
[35:56] um
[36:10] profit
[36:34] [Music]
[36:38] my
[36:52] amen wonderful thank you beautiful
[36:56] the bible says the gentiles will come
[36:58] from the ends of the earth and realize
[36:59] our fathers have been deceived by
[37:02] idolatry
[37:03] right and it says they god will cause
[37:06] them to know his hand
[37:08] and his mind the right hand of power
[37:11] praise god so the gentiles will come to
[37:13] know god's power because right hand just
[37:16] it just symbolizes the power of god
[37:18] right and they'll know god's might
[37:20] and they shall know that his name is the
[37:23] lord he is jehovah praise god he is
[37:26] yahweh hallelujah
[37:28] oh thank god that it's written by these
[37:30] four prophets right and god so five
[37:33] that the gentiles come to know the true
[37:36] god it was all foretold and remember we
[37:38] read it in our text in ephesians
[37:40] they didn't see it it was totally hidden
[37:42] from them i don't know how they missed
[37:43] that but
[37:44] it was all god right it was god hiding
[37:46] it so that it could be a beautiful
[37:48] revelation
[37:49] in this hour aren't you glad for that
[37:51] revelation
[37:53] go to jesus now that we've seen where
[37:55] it's prophesied
[37:57] jesus though first had to offer this new
[37:59] covenant to the jews
[38:02] so matthew 10 verses five six and seven
[38:05] haven't you get that
[38:06] matthew 10 verses five six and seven in
[38:09] fact god was
[38:10] obligated the bible says the word
[38:12] necessary
[38:14] later it says necessary it could come no
[38:18] other way
[38:19] god had to first give israel the chance
[38:21] to receive it
[38:22] right because they were already under
[38:24] covenant with god it was
[38:25] absolutely necessary to offer the
[38:28] baptism of the holy ghost to the jews
[38:29] first
[38:30] but they turned it down right uh matthew
[38:33] 10 verses five
[38:34] six and seven haven when you're ready
[38:40] these twelve is that where you're at
[39:03] all right thank you
[39:06] now notice what jesus told them
[39:09] do not go to the gentiles do not go to
[39:13] these uh
[39:14] ones with no covenant with no promises
[39:19] he says uh nor to the samaritans now
[39:21] what's interesting church is that he
[39:23] says that but then he made special trips
[39:25] to visit the samaritan woman right
[39:28] so he tells them stay out of the
[39:29] gentiles stay out of the samaritans
[39:31] right remember the samaritan's
[39:33] wife looked up the history and it said
[39:35] they were the jews that stayed when
[39:36] when the jews were scattered you know
[39:38] before the new testament
[39:40] the samaritans are the one that stayed
[39:42] and they uh you know they they
[39:43] they emphasized jacob's well right and
[39:45] they didn't worship at the temple
[39:47] so that's why the jews that moved back
[39:49] despised them right
[39:50] because they wouldn't they wouldn't come
[39:52] to their temple and worship
[39:55] and so jesus says don't go to the
[39:57] gentiles don't go the samaritans
[39:59] just go to the lost sheep of the house
[40:02] of israel
[40:03] and preach okay
[40:06] now you remember this we don't have time
[40:07] to read all of it but jesus actually
[40:09] called the gentiles
[40:11] dogs right
[40:14] that syrophenician woman came up to
[40:16] jesus and
[40:17] and said lord heal my daughter and she
[40:19] wouldn't even look at him
[40:21] right remember that scripture that was
[40:23] in matthew chapter 12.
[40:25] jesus looks at and then she finally
[40:27] keeps begging and jesus says
[40:29] uh you're basically you're a dog right
[40:33] and what was her great comeback a great
[40:34] comeback she was so desperate she said
[40:36] even the dogs
[40:38] get the crumbs that fall from the
[40:39] master's table praise god
[40:41] and jesus said because of your faith you
[40:44] have what you ask for
[40:45] praise god dogs church we know dogs
[40:49] are very dirty animals the florida
[40:52] health department says
[40:53] dogs have bacteria around their mouths
[40:56] that you don't want on your face
[40:59] almost a quarter million americans get
[41:01] sick every year
[41:04] by getting uh the germs from dogs
[41:08] oh my they lick dogs lick themselves all
[41:11] over
[41:11] so these germs can be on the dog's nose
[41:13] when it's nuzzling you
[41:16] remember i'm not gonna say the story but
[41:19] there's some people that really like
[41:20] dogs that we know right
[41:22] but uh there's thousands of germs right
[41:24] on the dog's mouth
[41:26] around the dog's nose and everything so
[41:29] you know
[41:29] that word actually means little dog so
[41:31] jesus doesn't call him a big dog you're
[41:32] just a little dog
[41:34] and so jesus was recognizing that they
[41:38] were dirty unclean isn't that so fitting
[41:40] they're unclean
[41:41] the gentiles are just dirty people right
[41:45] they don't live right they don't they
[41:47] don't take care of themselves
[41:48] they'll eat anything they'll they'll do
[41:50] anything
[41:52] uh and so jesus says you're
[41:55] dogs and he says but my israel
[41:58] their children amen
[42:02] but later we know jesus went to the
[42:04] woman at samara she had
[42:05] he had need to go by samaria
[42:08] and then through her a bunch of
[42:10] samaritans get saved amen
[42:13] so jesus was showing slowly he was
[42:15] opening it up
[42:16] he was spending most of time with israel
[42:18] but he would open up at times
[42:19] to samaritan and gentile remember the
[42:22] roman centurion he healed his son
[42:24] her servant rather and said i have not
[42:25] found so great of faith
[42:27] now it's interesting jesus called them
[42:29] dogs
[42:30] in matthew 15 rather sorry matthew 15.
[42:33] but in john chapter 10 he calls him
[42:35] sheep
[42:37] right so one place when he's talking
[42:39] with some he says you're a dog
[42:42] but other times when i remember john
[42:44] john 10 is getting close to john 12
[42:45] right
[42:46] where uh in john 13 where it's the end
[42:49] of jesus's life so towards the end of
[42:50] jesus ministry
[42:52] he's now revealing some things saying
[42:54] well they're more than
[42:55] dogs they're sheep that's john 10 16.
[42:58] can you put that up there lydia i'm
[43:00] sorry casey
[43:01] john 10 16. let's see what jesus says
[43:05] here so when he says dogs
[43:07] he says don't go to them but he says
[43:09] other sheep i have which are not of this
[43:11] fold
[43:12] them also i must bring and they shall
[43:13] hear my voice and there should be one
[43:15] fold
[43:16] and word praise god now picture that
[43:18] church before jesus
[43:20] there was there was there was one fold
[43:22] it was only protected
[43:23] uh by god with his promises the old
[43:26] covenant the mosaic covenant
[43:28] everybody else just out there uh lost
[43:31] basically
[43:32] but jesus says because israel has not
[43:34] heard the voice of my shepherd
[43:36] he said because you've not heard me
[43:39] you've rejected the father as well it's
[43:41] basically what he said
[43:42] in john chapter 10. he said but i'm
[43:45] going to go
[43:46] because you've rejected me i'm going to
[43:48] get my other sheep
[43:49] and bring them into my fold in other
[43:51] words we're protected by jesus the great
[43:53] shepherd tonight amen
[43:55] who's taking care of you tonight church
[43:57] it's not it's not your job
[43:59] it's not the government it's jesus
[44:01] christ amen
[44:02] he's feeding your soul praise god he's
[44:05] providing for your natural needs
[44:07] he's providing every one of your
[44:08] spiritual needs and remember that
[44:09] promise
[44:10] he said he's given us all spiritual
[44:12] blessings
[44:13] in christ jesus amen whatever we
[44:17] love god's already supplied it through
[44:19] the great shepherd jesus christ
[44:21] we were called dogs right but
[44:25] now they're called sheep now remember
[44:27] there's some good things about dogs
[44:28] right
[44:30] there's good benefits to actually living
[44:32] with dogs it lowers your blood pressure
[44:34] apparently and your heart rate
[44:38] that still doesn't make me want to get
[44:39] one now
[44:41] all right uh heart attack survivors dog
[44:45] owners were
[44:46] eight times more likely uh to be
[44:49] alive a year later after a heart attack
[44:53] so there's some benefits to having a dog
[44:55] you know you just feel more loved like i
[44:57] i was getting milk today at that a
[44:59] friend's house and this dog comes up out
[45:01] of nowhere just
[45:02] i've seen him before but i petted him
[45:04] and he just
[45:05] he's all excited at first i pet him for
[45:07] about a minute
[45:09] and now he's just all relaxed and he
[45:10] just he just wants me to pet him all
[45:12] over you know
[45:14] i said okay i gotta go and he just gotta
[45:17] wags his tail
[45:18] and he runs back to where he was but
[45:20] this is that they just
[45:22] they if you will love them they'll just
[45:24] do anything for you right
[45:27] that's a great lesson that we get uh
[45:30] god's
[45:30] poured out his love to the gentiles
[45:32] right so we just that's why we're so in
[45:34] love with jesus praise god
[45:37] right you get that idea of the dog right
[45:39] the faithful dog
[45:41] a man's best friend they say
[45:44] dogs are very smart right and what did
[45:47] jesus say the the
[45:49] uh the greeks desire wisdom right
[45:54] but he also said jesus said there's
[45:55] gonna be a change i'm not gonna call you
[45:57] dogs anymore
[45:58] i'm gonna call you sheep that hear my
[46:00] voice amen
[46:02] now jesus's parable of the wicked
[46:04] husband when we preach the eighth
[46:06] mystery
[46:07] plainly says this same thing uh
[46:10] if you go to matthew 21 lydia or acacia
[46:14] can you pull it up sorry i'm so used to
[46:15] saying lydia
[46:18] jesus basically says i'm taking the
[46:21] kingdom of god
[46:22] and i'm giving it to the gentiles
[46:24] matthew 21 43
[46:26] therefore i say unto you the kingdom of
[46:28] god shall be taken
[46:29] from you and given to a nation bringing
[46:32] forth the fruits
[46:34] thereof oh god we should be so thankful
[46:37] shall we not
[46:38] church that the kingdom of god belongs
[46:40] to us amen
[46:42] hallelujah we should be so thankful the
[46:44] kingdom of god the rulership of god
[46:46] the divine power of god amen
[46:49] hallelujah the blessings of god the
[46:51] healing of god the peace of god
[46:54] it all belongs to us we ought to cherish
[46:56] it praise god
[46:57] because it was taken from the jews and
[46:59] given to us it's god's great gift he's
[47:02] given to us
[47:02] let us rejoice in it let us be thankful
[47:05] for it and let us
[47:06] uh uh just not be not let it take be
[47:10] taken for granted
[47:11] let us uh uh gain every benefit we can
[47:14] from this great gift that we've been
[47:15] given praise god
[47:17] hallelujah it was taken from them
[47:21] oh lord like like david said take not
[47:24] your holy spirit from me
[47:26] right that should be our desire but
[47:27] israel's like that's okay if you take
[47:29] the kingdom of god we'd rather have our
[47:31] denomination right that's the same thing
[47:32] that's going on in many
[47:33] denominational churches today they'd
[47:36] rather have their own man-made creeds
[47:38] and ideas
[47:38] than the true power of god the word of
[47:41] god
[47:42] amen now isaiah 60 verse 3 says the
[47:46] gentiles
[47:47] shall come to thy light but jesus's
[47:50] light first came
[47:52] to the jews in acts 3 verse 25 and 26.
[47:56] can you pull up acts 3 verse 25 and 26
[47:59] isaiah said
[48:00] the gentiles will come to their light
[48:02] but the light first came to the jews
[48:06] here it is verse 26 unto you first
[48:09] god having raised up his son jesus sent
[48:12] him to bless you
[48:13] and turning away every one of you from
[48:16] his iniquities
[48:18] think about that you were given the
[48:20] first the jews were given the first
[48:22] option of it and they turned it down
[48:24] praise god
[48:25] you were given they were given the first
[48:27] opportunity to have
[48:29] life-changing power to have holy ghost
[48:31] power right
[48:32] to have god's indwelling power to have
[48:35] christ in you messiah in you
[48:37] the hope of glory and they turned it
[48:39] down
[48:40] they'd rather have their uh their own
[48:42] human mind dwelling in them
[48:44] would then have christ dwelling in them
[48:47] oh we ought to be thankful we ought to
[48:48] praise god that christ can live in us
[48:50] amen it was given to them first but they
[48:54] turned it down
[48:56] notice he said i don't send you to the
[48:59] samaritans or gentiles and see
[49:01] it even had to go to the the jews even
[49:04] the baptism of the holy ghost
[49:06] it was went to them first to bless them
[49:08] look at that to bless you
[49:10] amen the holy ghost is a blessing amen
[49:13] forgiveness is a blessing hallelujah
[49:15] redemption is a blessing amen
[49:18] all these great promises are a blessing
[49:20] first to the jew
[49:22] pull up romans 1 16 if you would acacia
[49:27] god was first preached to the jew
[49:32] romans 1 verse 16 for i'm not ashamed of
[49:34] the gospel of christ it's the power of
[49:36] god under salvation
[49:37] to everyone that believeth to the jews
[49:40] first
[49:41] and also to the greek
[49:45] they were the first one but they turned
[49:48] it down
[49:48] we're the second ones to hear it we
[49:51] received it thank god i'll just say this
[49:53] thank god we got a chance at it praise
[49:55] god let's make the most of our chance
[49:58] with this kingdom of god that he's given
[50:00] to us
[50:01] hallelujah once though the jews rejected
[50:05] and blasphemed it in acts 13
[50:07] then the light went to the gentiles
[50:11] they passed on it church doesn't it
[50:13] remind you of esau
[50:15] esau had the birth right he had in other
[50:17] words his future was in command
[50:19] and he was going to be in the he was
[50:20] going to be the family leader
[50:21] spiritually
[50:22] his his loins out of his loins would
[50:24] come the messiah
[50:26] he had all the blessings lined up and he
[50:28] sold it out
[50:29] for a bowl of cottage he sold it out for
[50:32] savory meat he was the first one that
[50:35] had the chance
[50:36] to have uh the blessing of the
[50:38] birthright and he sold it out for
[50:40] temporal blessings
[50:41] all you young people don't let anyone
[50:43] tell you that the blessing of christ is
[50:45] not the greatest thing on the earth
[50:47] it is the greatest thing on the earth
[50:49] praise god don't let anybody don't let
[50:51] the devil take that from you
[50:53] make sure that that you don't miss that
[50:55] opportunity to keep the kingdom of god
[50:58] and to live for jesus because satan
[51:01] wants to try to
[51:02] take that away from you that great
[51:03] blessing from you
[51:05] but you'll you'll understand soon it is
[51:07] the greatest blessing you can have
[51:09] god dwelling in your soul nothing can
[51:11] top that praise god
[51:12] nothing at all can top god living in you
[51:16] breathing in you speaking through you
[51:17] praise god
[51:21] i was reading uh just some testimonies
[51:22] on my first book uh today i was just
[51:24] going through them
[51:25] and the one woman said it's as if jesus
[51:28] was uh speaking right through you as you
[51:30] wrote the book
[51:32] the woman said it was like jesus riding
[51:34] through you
[51:35] or i saw another testimony on amazon uh
[51:37] i think it was from last august
[51:39] the woman said i was wearing leggings
[51:41] and all these things
[51:42] uh i thought it was okay to do leggings
[51:44] she said i bought your book
[51:46] she said i'm never going back she said
[51:49] god has restored modesty to my life
[51:51] through your book praise god can you
[51:53] imagine
[51:54] what a blessing that is praise god that
[51:55] we have a chance to receive it praise
[51:57] god
[51:58] that we have a chance to go from
[52:00] nakedness to covered amen right
[52:02] we have a chance to go from unholy to
[52:05] holy let's make the most of this chance
[52:07] praise god
[52:08] amen
[52:11] first given to the jews rejected
[52:15] now it comes to the gentiles 16 he used
[52:18] them first
[52:19] uh on the day of pentecost to the jews
[52:23] second he used them in acts chapter
[52:24] eight he followed up philip's ministry
[52:27] to the samaritans he and john laid hands
[52:30] on the samaritans they received
[52:32] the baptism of the holy ghost and then
[52:35] god this was important god had to give
[52:38] peter
[52:39] vision after vision right repeat three
[52:41] times he had to tell him
[52:43] i'm cleansing the gentiles and he still
[52:46] turned it down
[52:47] right how many times has god got to tell
[52:50] us
[52:51] times to obey we've got to repeat it
[52:54] right once i hope so
[52:57] are we first time o bears children we
[52:59] talk about first time obedience
[53:01] are we first time o'bears with the holy
[53:02] spirit
[53:04] three times god said rise kill and
[53:07] eat and peter said not so lord he did
[53:11] not want to go to the gentiles
[53:13] he did not want to go now look at this
[53:15] this is something he struggled right
[53:16] he had trouble going the first time he
[53:18] needed three times the lord told him
[53:20] and then the holy ghost fell on them and
[53:23] then years later
[53:24] paul had to come correct him and say
[53:27] don't separate yourself from the
[53:28] gentiles
[53:29] go ahead and eat with the gentiles so
[53:31] see church that tells us people with the
[53:33] baptism of the holy ghost
[53:34] they can have a revelation of something
[53:37] but then struggle with it
[53:40] right in this case it was like
[53:41] discriminate he wouldn't eat with
[53:44] the gentiles the very person who saw the
[53:47] holy ghost
[53:48] fall on the gentiles then struggled
[53:51] later
[53:52] to fellowship with them ah
[53:57] and but god had to use a supernatural
[54:00] thing not just
[54:01] a word from a brother or a sister god
[54:03] had to send the prophet peter a vision
[54:07] to shake him up praise god three times
[54:10] had to tell them god god knew how to
[54:12] work with his prophet can i say like
[54:14] that
[54:14] he had he knew how to do it he's got to
[54:16] use visions
[54:18] to move this man oh my and then peter's
[54:21] preaching the holy ghost falls
[54:23] he he saw it just like he did on the day
[54:25] of pentecost the same thing happened
[54:27] praise god
[54:28] and then he goes back memory church he
[54:30] goes back to judea
[54:31] and he tells them in in acts chapter 11
[54:34] that the gentiles got the holy ghost
[54:36] you know the bible said they contended
[54:38] with peter
[54:40] why because these were dogs these were
[54:42] dirty
[54:43] filthy stinking dogs and these apostles
[54:46] are like there's no egg oh i'm sorry
[54:48] he said there's no way god would pour
[54:51] out the holy ghost
[54:52] on these dirty dogs right sorry about
[54:54] that i gotta do something about that
[54:55] wire
[54:56] [Music]
[54:57] it's on my to-do list
[55:00] and they can can you imagine holy
[55:02] ghost-filled men arguing with peter
[55:04] it's impossible there's no way these
[55:07] people got the holy ghost no way
[55:09] they're dirty they're smelly right
[55:11] they're stinky
[55:12] there's no way but peter says who was i
[55:17] who was i that i could withstand god i
[55:19] preached the word i had a vision
[55:21] i saw god saying i'm going to cleanse
[55:22] them the holy ghost fell
[55:25] just like it did at the day of pentecost
[55:27] and that was the word that convinced
[55:29] them
[55:29] the holy ghost falls the same way they
[55:32] in other words they were saying the
[55:34] gentiles are one of us
[55:35] i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so
[55:38] glad that they can say i'm one of them
[55:40] praise god
[55:41] so what was the convincing tone the
[55:42] convincing tone was peter
[55:44] humbling himself he said look these
[55:46] people acted the same way they
[55:48] prophesied they magnified god
[55:50] they spoke with tongues whatever they
[55:51] did at cornelius house they magnified
[55:54] god
[55:54] he was convinced by the presence of god
[55:57] the power of god fell and the power of
[56:00] god convinced peter
[56:01] oh there's that right hand church amen
[56:03] the gentiles would have the right hand
[56:05] of god hallelujah
[56:07] the right hand of god fell on the
[56:08] gentiles just like he said in the book
[56:10] of jeremiah praise god
[56:14] amen
[56:16] a blessing
[56:21] peter gets accused he he gets argued
[56:23] with but he's humbled by the holy spirit
[56:26] being poured out
[56:27] you know what church that's what we
[56:28] really need we need more humility in our
[56:30] lives
[56:31] praise god the falling of the holy ghost
[56:34] always makes us humble
[56:36] brother ram says sincerity brings god's
[56:39] power
[56:39] we have to be more sincere in our lives
[56:44] peter gets humble he says what would i
[56:45] what was i that i could withstand god
[56:50] oh what a blessing that is let me just
[56:52] say like this
[56:53] anyone that wants to be born again god
[56:56] is going to send the wind
[56:57] to birth them into the kingdom of god
[56:59] and not even peter could stop it amen
[57:02] hallelujah church be encouraged if
[57:04] somebody wants to be born again here
[57:06] they're going to be born again peter's
[57:09] like i can't withstand god i can't stop
[57:11] what god's doing
[57:12] god is seeking and saving that which is
[57:14] lost praise god
[57:16] amen what a blessing to me amen
[57:19] preaching these 15 years
[57:20] knowing i've given all all that i have
[57:23] it's a blessing to know that all those
[57:25] who want the holy ghost
[57:26] will get it praise god peter couldn't
[57:29] withstand god who am i
[57:31] that i i can't withstand god god is
[57:33] going to meet every child of god
[57:35] that wants to be born again god's going
[57:37] to meet them and god is going to seek
[57:39] and save his children praise god
[57:42] all those that want the kingdom will
[57:43] receive the kingdom of god
[57:47] so cornelius house is now a turning
[57:49] point
[57:50] right in this great mystery how could
[57:53] god bring in these heathens that are
[57:54] outside this
[57:55] this holy flock how could he bring him
[57:57] in this is the turning point
[58:00] and these men have not even been
[58:02] circumcised through abraham's token
[58:04] covenant
[58:06] and yet they're born again now this
[58:09] in cornelius's house this starts the
[58:11] time jesus
[58:12] said the times of the gentiles in luke
[58:16] 21 verse 34. church can i say it like
[58:18] this
[58:19] it's your time amen
[58:22] it's your time praise god you young
[58:24] people it's your time
[58:26] amen our time with the holy ghost we
[58:29] have to do something with it
[58:30] praise god the bible said we must not be
[58:33] negligent with the holy ghost
[58:35] amen it's your time it's our time we
[58:38] have to do something with the power of
[58:40] god
[58:40] we must be vessels that the power of god
[58:42] can flow through
[58:48] amen
[58:53] in churches like we saw this week we
[58:54] don't know how long our time is
[58:57] let's not take it lightly right we don't
[58:59] know whenever god can take somebody
[59:01] this is your time this is the time of
[59:03] the gentiles
[59:06] it's a limited time paul says the gospel
[59:10] is with the gentiles until the fullness
[59:12] of the gentiles
[59:13] become in there's just a short amount of
[59:17] time now it's 2 000 years but i'm
[59:19] talking about our lives now
[59:20] there's just a short amount of time we
[59:21] don't know what the window is right
[59:23] a year five years 10 years 100 years we
[59:26] don't know what the window is
[59:27] but it's our time let's redeem the time
[59:30] hey man hallelujah there it is let's
[59:33] redeem the time it's our time
[59:36] thank god
[59:40] now the next section is paul paul's
[59:43] gentile dispensation
[59:45] and peter's apostleship to the jews
[59:50] now i'm going to read these quickly
[59:52] briefly paul said in first corinthians 9
[59:54] 17 he said a dispensation of the gospel
[59:59] is committed to me
[1:00:00] that word means a stewardship
[1:00:04] so paul had a stewardship committed to
[1:00:07] him
[1:00:07] of the gospel he was to watch over the
[1:00:10] gospel
[1:00:11] ephesians 3 1-2 says this was given by
[1:00:14] god
[1:00:15] he says for this cause i paul the
[1:00:17] prisoner of jesus christ for you
[1:00:19] gentiles
[1:00:21] if you have heard of the dispensation
[1:00:22] the grace of god which has given
[1:00:24] me to you word i love this next one this
[1:00:26] was this is what it reminds
[1:00:28] me of uh
[1:00:31] colossians 1 25 whereof i made a
[1:00:34] minister according to the dispensation
[1:00:37] of god
[1:00:37] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[1:00:40] the word of god
[1:00:42] amen
[1:00:45] now i'm thinking of another one though
[1:00:46] too that's uh i think i got that mixed
[1:00:49] up
[1:00:50] i love that scripture but that's not the
[1:00:51] one i was looking for i was looking for
[1:00:52] a different one
[1:00:56] oh yeah the prisoner that's right yeah
[1:00:58] the prisoner so
[1:00:59] paul was a prisoner as a minister so
[1:01:02] god imprisoned him in a stewardship as a
[1:01:05] minister
[1:01:07] to leave that prison room he was a love
[1:01:11] slave to christ
[1:01:13] everybody catch that sometimes church
[1:01:16] you might feel like you're a prisoner
[1:01:20] and it might be your very it's probably
[1:01:22] your very calling
[1:01:24] hello he said i'm a prisoner
[1:01:28] as a minister so god had entrapped him
[1:01:32] and said
[1:01:32] these are the boundaries you live your
[1:01:34] life in you're a preacher
[1:01:36] right don't leave this person you're a
[1:01:38] love slave to me you're a love prisoner
[1:01:40] to me
[1:01:41] you're a prisoner of love a slave to the
[1:01:43] master
[1:01:44] to leave that prison to leave that
[1:01:47] calling
[1:01:48] would be to defile their life right
[1:01:50] would be to deny
[1:01:52] the plan of god for their life many
[1:01:55] times we we get discouraged and maybe
[1:01:57] some well maybe sometimes we could get
[1:01:59] discouraged in our calling
[1:02:00] but we've got to stay faithful to the
[1:02:02] calling god wants you to learn i'll say
[1:02:04] i this
[1:02:05] god wants you to be instant in season
[1:02:07] and out of season
[1:02:08] amen god wants you to be faithful you
[1:02:11] know why
[1:02:12] because god's faithful praise god
[1:02:14] hallelujah
[1:02:15] god wants you to be there when no one
[1:02:17] else shows up god wants you to be there
[1:02:19] because you're acting like him praise
[1:02:21] god hey you're his child amen you ought
[1:02:23] to act like god god is always there
[1:02:26] you won't always be there too praise god
[1:02:28] amen
[1:02:30] i'm a prisoner to being a minister
[1:02:35] hallelujah thank the lord amen thank you
[1:02:38] jesus
[1:02:39] it's a stewardship it's my
[1:02:42] responsibility i've got to make sure
[1:02:44] i'm faithful with this assignment
[1:02:48] given by god
[1:02:52] paul said i was given a stewardship to
[1:02:54] you
[1:02:56] to the churches right i'm a slave
[1:02:59] to you that's why he'd preach all night
[1:03:01] amen
[1:03:02] that's why i'll preach an hour and a
[1:03:03] half on a sunday sometimes longer
[1:03:06] because i'm a slave i'm a prisoner to
[1:03:07] the lord right i'm a prisoner to my
[1:03:10] listeners that the sheep god has sent me
[1:03:12] to preach to you i'm a prisoner to them
[1:03:15] and paul said woe unto me if i don't
[1:03:17] preach the gospel
[1:03:18] let me say this woe unto me if i don't
[1:03:20] preach the gospel woe unto you and
[1:03:22] us if we don't do what god's called us
[1:03:24] to do
[1:03:28] we were just rejoicing earlier right
[1:03:29] because we had a calling we we're called
[1:03:31] to the gospel
[1:03:33] right we rejoice under that but we've
[1:03:35] got to be faithful in it as well
[1:03:38] can't remember we can't forget that
[1:03:40] we're prisoners to the calling of god
[1:03:44] amen see when it gets hard a lot of
[1:03:47] people just
[1:03:48] leave their calling they leave their
[1:03:50] responsibility
[1:03:52] that's that's called a hireling right
[1:03:54] that's called a
[1:03:56] uh faithful pastor right that's called
[1:03:58] an unfaithful shepherd right
[1:04:00] that's an impersonator they're only
[1:04:01] there for the money right
[1:04:04] we have to be faithful in the good
[1:04:07] faithful and the bad times right
[1:04:09] because god has called us for a specific
[1:04:12] ministry
[1:04:13] paul knew what that was
[1:04:17] so paul was chosen to go to the gentiles
[1:04:20] peter to the jews
[1:04:21] now church that's not confused let's go
[1:04:23] to galatians 2 verse 7.
[1:04:25] let's not confuse this although there
[1:04:27] were two separate men sent out
[1:04:29] it was the one faith but as we've been
[1:04:32] hearing right these last few weeks
[1:04:34] the jews are allowed to express their
[1:04:37] faith differently than us
[1:04:39] and we're allowed to sell or to express
[1:04:42] our faith differently than the jewish
[1:04:44] christians right or the messianic
[1:04:45] christians
[1:04:47] god has variety within the unity
[1:04:50] praise god because there's only one
[1:04:54] faith paul says there's one lord one
[1:04:56] faith
[1:04:57] one baptism now galatians 2
[1:05:00] 7 but contrary wise when they saw that
[1:05:02] the gospel the uncircumcision was
[1:05:04] committed unto me
[1:05:05] as the gospel of circumcision was unto
[1:05:08] peter
[1:05:09] so see there's two gospels there's a
[1:05:11] gospel committed to the jews
[1:05:13] gospel to the gentiles for he that
[1:05:15] wrought effectually in peter to the
[1:05:17] apostleship of the circumcision
[1:05:19] the same was mighty in me toward the
[1:05:21] gentiles
[1:05:22] and when james cephas john who seemed to
[1:05:25] be pillars perceived the grace that was
[1:05:27] given unto me
[1:05:28] they gave to me and barnabas the right
[1:05:30] hands of fellowship that we should go
[1:05:32] unto the heathen
[1:05:33] and they unto the circumcision think
[1:05:34] about that peter on the day of pentecost
[1:05:37] how many people got saved
[1:05:40] three thousand right it sounds like a
[1:05:43] pretty good revival
[1:05:44] hard to top that one three thousand
[1:05:48] but remember paul went to certain
[1:05:49] islands and the bible said all that were
[1:05:51] on the island
[1:05:52] were healed praise god amen
[1:05:56] see in other words paul said the same
[1:05:58] god that did mighty works on the day of
[1:06:00] pentecost
[1:06:01] is the same god that does mighty works
[1:06:02] in my ministry
[1:06:04] see sent to two different groups said
[1:06:07] one
[1:06:08] paul was sent to the gentile flock peter
[1:06:10] sent to the jewish flock
[1:06:12] the same god showed great power amongst
[1:06:15] them despite their differences
[1:06:17] in their expression of worship
[1:06:23] that's why god will fall in a church
[1:06:25] that loves the holy ghost no matter
[1:06:27] their differences that they have with us
[1:06:28] right just like the same way god can
[1:06:30] fall in our church or has fallen in our
[1:06:32] church
[1:06:33] we may have things slightly different
[1:06:35] that's our liberty that's our right
[1:06:37] but god's looking at the heart god's
[1:06:39] looking at those who are
[1:06:41] hungry and thirsty for holiness
[1:06:54] look at these choices look who god knows
[1:06:57] god chose two men peter and paul
[1:07:02] as the spokesperson for the gospel of
[1:07:05] jesus christ
[1:07:10] look at his choice let's look at peter
[1:07:12] what let's look at peter
[1:07:14] he's the spokesman for jesus christ
[1:07:18] it's so shocking isn't it that peter's
[1:07:20] chosen
[1:07:21] the one who took up the sword and said
[1:07:23] lord do we got enough swords
[1:07:24] he said he said we got two swords the
[1:07:26] lord he said it's enough
[1:07:28] right peter when he said he said uh he
[1:07:31] said i'll go
[1:07:32] he said i'll even die with you tonight
[1:07:34] he said before the crows three
[1:07:36] times you'll deny me i'm sorry before
[1:07:37] you cross you'll deny me right
[1:07:39] three times
[1:07:42] and he cuts off malcus's ear right or
[1:07:45] marcus's servant's ear
[1:07:47] jesus heals it and peter runs away only
[1:07:50] to follow him closely
[1:07:52] and here's the spokesperson god is going
[1:07:54] to use god calls this man
[1:07:56] a man who was surrounded by shame
[1:07:59] a man who is surrounded by disgrace
[1:08:03] god redeems this man and makes him a
[1:08:05] spoke
[1:08:06] spokesperson for the good news amen
[1:08:09] always good news to peter the gospel was
[1:08:12] good news because he could be forgiven
[1:08:14] praise god
[1:08:15] amen so look at these people he chose
[1:08:18] peter a man
[1:08:19] disgraced right a man totally disgraced
[1:08:23] and god said i'm going to use that man
[1:08:24] i'm going to show him grace amen
[1:08:27] and i'm going to make him my
[1:08:28] spokesperson that's that's peter that's
[1:08:30] my man that's my servant
[1:08:31] that's my apostle to the jews
[1:08:34] so church don't let your past false
[1:08:38] linger too long right don't let the
[1:08:40] devil beat you up with your past faults
[1:08:42] right if they're confessed it's time to
[1:08:45] move on it's time to press forward
[1:08:47] toward the mark of the high calling in
[1:08:49] christ jesus
[1:08:50] right if anybody could have uh felt bad
[1:08:53] about their sins it would have been
[1:08:54] peter
[1:08:55] i denied the very one who let me walk on
[1:08:57] water i denied the very one who healed
[1:08:59] the sick and
[1:09:00] healed my wife i'm sorry no heal my
[1:09:02] mother-in-law
[1:09:04] right peter's mother-in-law was healed
[1:09:07] of
[1:09:08] a fever
[1:09:12] he denied the one that healed her
[1:09:16] and jesus still says if you love me feed
[1:09:18] my sheep
[1:09:20] feed my lambs i'm sending you to the
[1:09:22] lost sheep of the house of israel
[1:09:26] and remember he was boasting he was a
[1:09:28] braggart church
[1:09:31] but none of us have ever bragged before
[1:09:33] right none of us have ever been prideful
[1:09:35] right nobody's nobody's out there has
[1:09:37] ever thought they could do anything
[1:09:39] on their own without god's help
[1:09:42] no one's we're just all humble all the
[1:09:44] time right total humility all the time
[1:09:48] i don't think so
[1:09:52] god chose a boaster who denied him and
[1:09:55] cussed and swore god said i'm gonna
[1:09:57] forgive that man
[1:09:58] i'm gonna make him my spokesperson to
[1:10:00] the jews
[1:10:04] why church because weakness
[1:10:08] christ's strength is magnified
[1:10:11] when i'm weak then i'm strong
[1:10:20] yep that's who that's who jesus chose
[1:10:22] that cussing preacher
[1:10:24] that bragging preacher that boastful
[1:10:26] preacher
[1:10:28] god chose him he said i'm going to
[1:10:30] transform peter's soul
[1:10:31] with the baptism of the holy ghost i'm
[1:10:33] going to make him my
[1:10:35] uh spokesperson on the day of pentecost
[1:10:38] i'm going to birth my church using the
[1:10:40] lips of someone who used to
[1:10:41] deny me
[1:10:45] that's god's choice
[1:10:48] we shouldn't be surprised church of
[1:10:49] god's choice today people that made big
[1:10:52] mistakes
[1:10:53] right people that just made awful
[1:10:56] decisions maybe they made awful
[1:10:58] decisions in the past
[1:10:59] they brought a bunch of disgrace upon
[1:11:01] the gospel but yet god can forgive them
[1:11:04] and god can still do great things with
[1:11:05] them how many appreciate god's grace
[1:11:08] look who god chose peter boasting
[1:11:12] cursing can i say this running
[1:11:16] deserting he's a deserter remember we
[1:11:19] talked about the word apostasy
[1:11:20] that means the desert peter had deserted
[1:11:24] the message i'll say it like that he
[1:11:25] deserted
[1:11:26] the great shepherd and yet god still
[1:11:29] had mercy on him and redeemed him
[1:11:33] is there hope for you and i church
[1:11:35] absolutely
[1:11:38] no matter is there hope for the ones
[1:11:40] that besides this is there hope for the
[1:11:41] ones who've left us
[1:11:42] absolutely i don't know only god knows
[1:11:45] how far they can go
[1:11:46] but is there hope for them yeah as long
[1:11:48] as there's uh
[1:11:49] as long as uh they haven't crossed that
[1:11:51] line as long as they haven't got the
[1:11:53] reprobate mind
[1:11:54] right there's hope for them
[1:11:58] god specializes in redeeming
[1:12:01] the fallen he transforms us
[1:12:06] from failures to followers
[1:12:10] praise the lord failures we can
[1:12:13] fail and just totally fall
[1:12:16] on our face and god will forgive us of
[1:12:19] our failures
[1:12:20] and make us true followers amen
[1:12:24] this is god's choice this is god's
[1:12:26] choosing
[1:12:30] why didn't he choose john do you guys
[1:12:32] ever think about that why did you john
[1:12:33] john was at the cross
[1:12:36] john was more faithful right seemingly
[1:12:39] more faithful he's the one maokai that's
[1:12:42] hugging up in
[1:12:43] jesus's bosom he's trying to get close
[1:12:45] to him and say oh jesus i love you
[1:12:48] you're everything to me though and the
[1:12:52] disciple jesus
[1:12:53] loved and jesus didn't choose him
[1:12:57] to be the apostle of the jews he chose
[1:13:00] peter
[1:13:02] the boasting one the one who had
[1:13:05] failures
[1:13:07] to show the jews that god is a god of
[1:13:09] mercy
[1:13:10] praise god he redeems us from our
[1:13:13] failures he forgives us of our failures
[1:13:15] and he's faithful and he makes us
[1:13:17] followers of him
[1:13:20] someone that would cuss deny and what he
[1:13:24] tried to kill that guy right he was
[1:13:25] almost a murderer he almost murdered can
[1:13:29] you imagine cutting off someone's ear
[1:13:31] on purpose and that's the kind god said
[1:13:35] i'm going to make him my spokesman
[1:13:38] doesn't surprise you after we read about
[1:13:39] moses right
[1:13:41] the murderer moses the murder the
[1:13:43] murderer as simon said who became the
[1:13:45] meekest
[1:13:48] the murderer who becomes the meekest so
[1:13:51] friends
[1:13:52] children whatever you are in your
[1:13:54] failures
[1:13:55] god can turn it completely around and
[1:13:56] give you a transformation
[1:14:00] he can forgive your failures and he can
[1:14:02] set you on the road to a faithful life
[1:14:04] of service
[1:14:08] don't let anyone tell you he can't he
[1:14:10] can definitely do that
[1:14:12] let me close with paul this will be 45
[1:14:15] minutes coming up here
[1:14:17] my what a thought peter
[1:14:20] and paul paul
[1:14:24] a hebrew of hebrews
[1:14:27] in other words the most serious
[1:14:31] of jews there was the most
[1:14:34] zealous of the jews
[1:14:39] he despised the gentiles right for their
[1:14:41] uncleanness
[1:14:43] he would be a completely unlikely choice
[1:14:46] to open the doors to the gentiles
[1:14:48] because he despised the gentiles
[1:14:50] to us it wouldn't be a obvious choice
[1:14:53] he despised the gentiles he want nothing
[1:14:56] to do with the gentiles
[1:14:58] and yet god looks at paul and said i'm
[1:15:01] going to use him
[1:15:02] to open the door this steadfast jew i'm
[1:15:05] going to use him to open the door
[1:15:07] this clean one to open the door to the
[1:15:09] unclean
[1:15:11] what a choice god was all about
[1:15:15] humbling paul through his conversion he
[1:15:19] was so smart he could read everything
[1:15:20] and what did god do
[1:15:22] what god take away from paul when he saw
[1:15:24] jesus
[1:15:25] his eyesight he took away his ability to
[1:15:28] study the scriptures and
[1:15:29] to become wise right and to devote
[1:15:32] himself
[1:15:33] to reading the word and writing the word
[1:15:36] god took that away from him to humble
[1:15:38] him
[1:15:40] so he could be the right kind of a
[1:15:41] servant
[1:15:45] let's remember god may take some things
[1:15:47] away from us in order for us to follow
[1:15:48] him
[1:15:50] and paul didn't have the choice you can
[1:15:52] say that paul didn't have the choice god
[1:15:54] chose to take his eyesight away
[1:16:00] so my my my suggestion
[1:16:04] or i'll say it like this my command is
[1:16:06] children serve god before
[1:16:08] god has to take something away from you
[1:16:10] praise god remember the creator
[1:16:12] in the days of your youth praise god
[1:16:15] remember him now
[1:16:19] because god took paul's sight away for
[1:16:22] a few days and then he struggled with it
[1:16:24] over the remaining decades of his life
[1:16:33] paul had kept all the traditions all the
[1:16:35] law so paul's like
[1:16:37] kind of like the opposite right of peter
[1:16:39] peter had all these failures right but
[1:16:40] paul was like he was perfect he was like
[1:16:42] oh he's like oh he's a perfect man he
[1:16:44] don't he don't struggle he don't have
[1:16:46] mind battles
[1:16:47] he never falls short of god's glory and
[1:16:49] he he liked it
[1:16:50] that way he liked to be there he was
[1:16:52] always there early he was always there
[1:16:54] late you know he
[1:16:55] he make sure all the sacrifices were in
[1:16:57] order
[1:17:00] zealous he said i was zealous for the
[1:17:02] law i was zealous for those
[1:17:03] 613 old testament commandments
[1:17:06] plus the uh plus the law of the priests
[1:17:09] right
[1:17:10] the mishnah the tradition of the the
[1:17:12] oral tradition of the priests
[1:17:14] he was zealous for that zeal is for the
[1:17:15] law and zealous for the man-made
[1:17:17] traditions
[1:17:18] the perfect one he's the type a
[1:17:20] personality
[1:17:25] but after seeing the grace of jesus
[1:17:27] christ he said i count all
[1:17:30] that all the mission and all the
[1:17:31] man-made ideas not the law now
[1:17:33] i count all the man-made ideas as done
[1:17:36] that i might win christ
[1:17:39] praise the lord and a man glory
[1:17:42] who wouldn't even go across the street
[1:17:44] to witness to a gentile before
[1:17:46] now he crosses the oceans amen ah
[1:17:50] now he gets in shipwrecks i think he got
[1:17:52] into five or three shipwrecks wasn't it
[1:17:53] three or five
[1:17:54] he would cross great bodies of water he
[1:17:57] would uh
[1:17:58] he would he would hazard his life to go
[1:18:01] save a gentile before he wouldn't care
[1:18:03] about a gentile but when the power of
[1:18:05] christ came into his life
[1:18:06] he was constrained for the rest of his
[1:18:08] days to go save a gentile soul amen
[1:18:11] what will god do in your life children
[1:18:14] what will god do in
[1:18:14] our lives of adults he'll change our
[1:18:16] lives he'll transform us
[1:18:18] by the power of god amen
[1:18:22] that's how you know you're really born
[1:18:23] again right because you see the
[1:18:25] transformation
[1:18:26] peter saw the transformation i'm angry
[1:18:29] i'm boastful i'm cussing i'm deserting
[1:18:32] but now i'm faithful i'm holy right i'm
[1:18:35] righteous praise god
[1:18:36] i'm humble amen paul i'm zealous for man
[1:18:41] i separate myself from the things of the
[1:18:44] gentiles
[1:18:45] i won't even talk to a gentile now i'll
[1:18:47] go to any lengths to save a gentile soul
[1:18:50] because the gospel light is shine unto
[1:18:52] me praise god
[1:18:54] these are the two spokesman's god
[1:18:56] chooses
[1:18:57] peter and paul oh
[1:19:00] my
[1:19:05] paul violently opposed jesus christ
[1:19:07] right
[1:19:09] he would he would break into people's
[1:19:11] homes imagine someone breaking into your
[1:19:13] home
[1:19:13] dragging you off to jail that was paul
[1:19:18] and now he's knocking trying to get into
[1:19:20] people's houses to give them the gospel
[1:19:22] right
[1:19:22] and now at the end of his life he opens
[1:19:24] up his door let all the gentiles come on
[1:19:26] in
[1:19:28] i'll sit in my hired house i'll teach
[1:19:29] you the word of god i'm a prisoner of
[1:19:32] christ
[1:19:35] these are jesus's choices
[1:19:40] take the revelation of the mystery to
[1:19:42] the jews
[1:19:43] and to the gentiles let's stand to our
[1:19:48] feet
[1:19:56] musicians can come
[1:20:00] sing and pray church think about the
[1:20:02] transformation jesus wants to do in your
[1:20:04] life
[1:20:08] satan is always going to bring up
[1:20:09] failure failure failure even to me
[1:20:12] right and even to any of us he's going
[1:20:14] to try to bring up failure on top of
[1:20:17] a double failure
[1:20:20] but that's the beauty of the gospel it's
[1:20:23] transformation power
[1:20:26] right it's the power of brother
[1:20:29] brother ram sermon the power of
[1:20:31] transformation
[1:20:33] that's the beauty of the gospel of
[1:20:34] christ
[1:20:40] play that little song change my heart oh
[1:20:42] god let's let's why don't you play that
[1:20:43] one change my heart oh god make it ever
[1:20:45] pure
[1:20:50] [Music]
[1:20:57] so part of this mystery we can see could
[1:21:00] god
[1:21:03] take defile people like gentiles
[1:21:07] [Music]
[1:21:10] could god bring filthy dirty
[1:21:13] diseased people and make them holy could
[1:21:16] he bring them
[1:21:17] in to a holy covenant
[1:21:20] and wash them and make them pure could
[1:21:22] he transform
[1:21:23] the unlovable into lovable
[1:21:28] what's the answer he said i'm going to
[1:21:31] say to those that i never said you're my
[1:21:33] beloved
[1:21:34] i'm going to say you are my beloved
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:38] i'm going to say to people that were not
[1:21:40] my people you are
[1:21:42] my people hallelujah praise god
[1:21:47] children you are god's people
[1:21:51] he wants to transform your lives
[1:21:55] no matter what you've done in the past
[1:21:58] you're sincere repent of that
[1:21:59] god will transform you by the renewing
[1:22:02] of your mind
[1:22:08] and that's the power of christianity
[1:22:11] it's the transforming power from a
[1:22:13] cussing or from a legalistic person into
[1:22:16] someone who's so
[1:22:17] full of grace or do anything
[1:22:20] to win a soul
[1:22:27] thank you
[1:22:39] as we bow our heads how many would raise
[1:22:41] their eye and say brother
[1:22:42] pray for me that god can transform my
[1:22:46] life
[1:22:50] i want to pray that way too that you
[1:22:52] know my children never saw me as a
[1:22:54] sinner
[1:22:54] you know sometimes that makes me sad
[1:22:57] yeah i'm so thankful god saved me before
[1:23:00] they were born
[1:23:02] but i want to pray lord do something
[1:23:06] in my life now that my children can see
[1:23:08] they're transforming
[1:23:09] in me still
[1:23:15] and they'll see in one another
[1:23:20] something like peter something like that
[1:23:21] [Music]

[1:23:27] christ can shine upon our lives
