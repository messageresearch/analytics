Romans chapter 5 verse 1. we'll just read verse one my God 's been trying to get to this chapter here we'll see how far we can get Romans chapter 5 verse 1. 3 Dad if we can ready one two three therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen let's have one more word of prayer here as we approach the word of God if you ever need on your heart let's make it known unto God here tonight Heavenly Father we appreciate you God we worship you we love you thank you for the blood of Jesus Christ it's our only righteousness it's our only hope it's our only peace in this laodicean age God so we're thankful for your Amazing Grace we thank you that the blood cleanses all sin God we confess all of our sin God forgive us of our sins our transgressions Lord God our Lord our iniquity Lord God any wrong we've done God any sin we've done forgive us Lord we're the guilty ones of the Lord and just wash us now in your blood why does snow Lord God as we come before the word of God and I pray God you anoint me Lord the speaker and each of the Saints the hearers Lord God let us all be able to hear the word of God and do the word of God let us be doers of the word tonight father God bless these thoughts God you've placed upon My Heart Lord God that I placed in my notes but Lord just guide me Lord into the needs of your people Lord may you be glorified and honored Lord God and all that's said and done we are here to serve you Lord God we want to be just like you we want to be molded into the character of Jesus Christ so help us here tonight thank you that all of our hopes in you tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God I have a few slides here we'll show about God's grace good to see brother Ray God bless you sir hallelujah praise God good to see you sir so we'll see how far we can get here tonight by the grace of the Lord you know as I was looking at this chapter you know we got into chapter five there last Wednesday night but as I was looking I was curious I started going through some other quotes from Brother Branham so I just we thought I'd share a brief quote again from Brother Branham on Romans chapter four about staggering not at the promise of God uh brother random speaking of Sarah she was included in it God never gives Sarah the promise he'd give Abraham a promise but Sarah was included he made the promise in Christ Jesus and I was included in him you were too don't you love this thought here how brother Ram takes Abraham and Sarah Sarah's the bride a part of the husband and here Christ is the husband we're part of the Bride so we get promises in Christ Jesus and church the greatest one is what eternal life that's the greatest promise praise God and that's in Christ the Bible said remember in chapter the next chapter we'll get to it the Bible says the word if we die with Christ we'll also raise with Christ amen what a what a complete promise amen all of our promises are in Christ Jesus we must remember that Hallelujah he said he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith given glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone it wasn't imputed but unto him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised Jesus our lord from the dead said oh he reads again who was delivered for our fence and was raised again for our justification oh brother now look at this I could just hit the devil in the face with that 365 days a year praise God I mean like that how many how many know you have to have spiritual battles with the Devil Ram says I could hit the devil in the face with this section remember what did Brother Adam say right before he died a month before he died he said when I'm blue when I'm discouraged when I'm depressed I go to Romans chapter 4. where Abraham didn't stagger at the promise of God so I just thought you liked that you know brother random said he could use this scripture every day to overcome the devil and say devil you're a liar there's the word I'm Healed because my healing is through Jesus Christ every promise whatever I have a need of is through Christ Hallelujah trusting in the promise of God so I thought that would be encouragement to you by God's grace also it was neat to see brother random use uh the verse we read tonight Romans 5 verse 1 at least 12 times there's different ways you can search with you know partial words and everything but I found at least 12 times and these sad people may Lord may God have mercy on their souls these these sad people that leave the message and say brother Brandon wasn't a Bible teacher brother man wasn't in in preaching for uh for religious purposes but for monetary purposes these sad people uh they must for all those years there in the message they must have not even listening to the tapes because brother and quotes verbatim Romans 5 verse 1 which isn't like a verse we'd say you know all the churches memorize right they memorize John 3 16. if brother man was just trying to skirt by and just trying to you know make some money why would he labor on verses that are not so well known but he labors on these verses that bring the people to Salvation praise God Amen I love that about brother random he was into the word he'd bring the word hallelujah he'd read his text remember he said I always read a text before I preach because my words will fail but God's words can never fail amen he says that over and over and over again I love the fact that many times I can just type in a few verses in program search and I'll come up with scriptures because brother and was faithful in teaching the people the word of God Amen now what was different though that some people you know at least a few people that have left the message that have told me uh in some of the sermons brother Ram is into so many stories and Visions well what would you do if you were a prophet and you lived in the visions of Dimensions right if you had constant missions all throughout the day and you knew if you told them they'd help the people and they'd vindicate that you were sent from God wouldn't you tell those of course you would it's just like Ezekiel telling his visions and Jeremiah telling his visions and all the prophets of God you have to tell your Visions praise God and what brothers was trying to show was that God was with him the same Christ from the Bible was the Christ with brother Branham and church don't be discouraged he's the Christ with us today praise God we need not be discouraged because Jesus Christ cannot change he's the same today as he ever was praise God Hallelujah brother says if you believe that I've been in connection with almighty God if you believe that listen to me now don't let the sun rise on you until something is anchored in your heart that you are a Christian that you're at peace with your enemy you're at peace with God look what he's saying he's like just have peace with God don't don't let this Knight go without knowing you have peace with God why feel like you're an enemy with God why if he was in this for money why would he take time on these scriptures like this he's in this to try to give the people victory over the devil praise God Amen just like I'm in it for that purpose just like you're in it for that purpose you're in this to experience the blessing of Christ on your life how many in it for that reason praise God that's why we're in it to enjoy the blessings of Christ to see the spirit of God make the word a revelation to us and then to then to live the word of God like I was really encouraged last week when Austin sent me a text and said this series on Abraham's really helping me speak the word of God that's why we do it that's just one example now each of you I could probably if I said let's have a testament let's change this we'll make this a testimony meaning and each one of you can come up here and testify how something that was preached has helped you in your life and the church said I mean it's just how it is but that's just one simple modern example a recent example I should say recent that's why we're here we're here to see the people believe the word receive the word because the word is life there's no other life except through the word of God hallelujah amen thank God Amen the word is life praise God and brother Brown said to raise your faith God sends preachers so I'm here uh you know I'm here preaching when I can hear you pulling or when you're not pulling when everybody looks happy whatever it looks sad right it's my job as a minister that's why I'm here I'm here to serve you to tell you God's word and hopefully by the end your faith will be raised amen I don't know which channel you need me to go down but you can direct the channel by pulling on the gift of God hallelujah you can direct that and it's God's word if you believe it we'll give you life it'll give you Victory it'll give you life tomorrow when you need it praise God amen and then he quotes Romans 5 verse 1. if you have enmity against some neighbor against somebody else that's done you harm and that person has done you harm if you and your heart can't love that person don't take that experience in other words don't live like that don't live with hatred towards people you must love those who do not love you like Jesus said if you love those who love you Sinners do the same think about that some people are not even living above a sinner's life yet they call themselves a Christian isn't that so I mean that's sad it makes me laugh but it's like a sad laugh they're calling themselves Christians and they're not even living above a sinner's life well that's all right Church you might the Bible said you might stumble seven times but the righteous will rise again amen Rise Again find it in your heart pray at the altar no church you don't have to pray here but you know if we need Victory we need to pray more praise God if we want Victory we're going to see change in our lives we got to pray more I was thinking today how many people you know if they would just focus on just praying for God give me self-control I was thinking today if we could just pray for temper taught me to control things that I consume and things that I look at and things that I think and things that I say how many people would be Overcomers if they would just pray for more Temperance in their lives in other words controlling yourself not letting yourself get out of control how many more people would feel Victorious if they could pray for more tempers and have more self-control praise God just that one not alone you know the ones that are above that like patience and godliness and brotherly kindness uh just if people would pray for that like I told you that story about my uncle couldn't get he can't get over rum and he'd have such Better Health I mean his lifespan would be so much further I tried to tell him you know Jesus can take care of Rome Jesus can take that you know desire out of you I heard a preacher uh uh I think it was Stacy good bread if I'm not mistaken I was listening yesterday and he said as a sinner he sat in the bar for years and years and years he said and one day the Holy Spirit came and tapped him on the shoulder and he turned around nobody was there and he said something it was like a vacuum something pulled all that desire to drink out of him a church that's a real experience praise God and he said I used to love it you know you love sin for a season right it's pleasurable he loved it loved it all of a sudden the Holy Spirit just takes it out now church if God does that to get a preacher ready to minister God will do that for all of us praise God because all of us can minister in some way brother Brandon said I'd rather have you live me a good sermon than preach me a good one Hallelujah the thing we need is a life that lives the sermon praise God amen he said but you've got to now not to just act like it's a religious act but from your heart you've got to you have to love your enemies Hallelujah I know for most of us that's probably our co-workers right some enemies on the job hopefully there's no enemies in the church praise God if so let's talk about it after so let's have a counseling session after church amen let's get everybody feeling good about each other Amen brother man one time I had to go house the house you know to get you got all the problems in the in the Branham Tabernacle he said all cleaned up he said him and brother never went house to house to clean out the issues he said some people in the brand of Tabernacle wouldn't even walk on the same side of the street downtown Jeffersonville they'd have to cross the other side because they wouldn't want to pass somebody who went to the same church now God help us to never have that help us to love one another by the grace of God amen also here's another one I thought you liked this one he brings in Romans 5 1. I think this is the last one yeah he said now wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gates Hebrews 13 12 and 13. Romans 5 1. we read that already but he says he says not by shaking hands now we're not justified by shaking hands that doesn't make you saved right we're not saved by water baptism although we should be baptized we're not saved by laying on of hands not with shouting not with speaking in tongues not with any sensation that's what I love my brother and will pick up these things in these verses that we need to remember because we all fight battles how many fought a battle this week am I in battle or whatever kind of battle spiritual battle whatever kind of battle and so we need reminders you know he brings us back to the Simplicity of just believing that it's by faith we're Justified in other words there's no pressure on you to do some miracle tonight to know you're Justified justification is just by faith Hallelujah the fact you're saved is a gift of God it's God giving you Faith praise God and you just repent and you got faith and now you're Justified you're saved you're righteous amen he says we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ we pass from death into life and become new creatures because we have believed on the only begotten Son of God and accepted him as our personal Savior and his blood acts tonight as a perpetuation for our sin to stand in our place amen hallelujah oh thank God we would stand there condemned in God's presence but the blood takes our place Jesus Takes our place just like he did on the cross thank God he took your place thank God you don't have to stand there as a sinner because you'd be condemned but Jesus stood there for you amen Hallelujah now just as a reminder too I'm going to preach this Lord willing if I go down there to The Junction City in July I might preach this again I've already mentioned this to you but of course brother Adam taught Abraham's life was a type of the three works of Grace he said now notice we was talking the other day and he said therefore we're being justified by faith all right second place after being washed Sanctified so there's the second work of Grace same vacation and then filled with the Holy Ghost justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost you see it how was his message justification by hearing sanctification is what you do And in regards to what you did in appreciation of that God sealed you by the Holy Ghost so if you're seeking the Holy Ghost just say God give me more appreciation for you right because the more you appreciate somebody the more you want to be a blessing to them well the more you want to help them right so the more we appreciate God the more we'll clean out our lives the more we'll obey the word of God and church even if you've got the Holy Ghost Jesus said I sanctify myself we can all use the good sanctification from time to time all of us so we can all show our appreciation to Jesus amen he says now brother man tells the story many times he said you know you my Baptist brother I'm going to tell you something you say what more could Abraham do but believe God remember he had a preacher tell them that brother man what could Abraham do then just believe God he was trying to he was trying to go against the three works of Grace he said God imputed to him for righteous that's all he could do right here believe God but to accept his belief God give him the seal the circumcision and sealed him showing that God had accepted his faith and if you profess faith in God and has never been sealed by the Holy Ghost in Ephesians 4 30 if you want to put it down grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed and you're not sealed until you have received the Holy Ghost amen praise God how many want God to accept your faith church we yes we get saved we accept God's gift but then God wants to see you really accept that gift right right and believe the word of God and obey the word of God and grow in the stature of a perfect man God wants to see you grow as a Christian praise God and then when God says yes you really received it then I give you the Holy Ghost praise God just like Abraham got the Sea of the Holy Spirit praise God but did Abraham have constant mistakes yes he did but was Abraham an overcomer yes he was what are you you're the same you're an overcomer praise God maybe I got the quote up here I think I might just read that quote because it's such a blessing and I put I might even preach this in Iowa brother Brooks asked me to come out preach for him so I'm trying to find a date for that oh yeah right there he said he said we find that his Royal seed is travels the same Journey that's that's bride of Christ travels the same Journey that Abraham did I like that amen this shows the three works of Grace right and I'm gonna skip past my notes there I've already preached that to all of you by God's grace okay now moving on to our new scriptures actually you don't need your Bible here let me set a timer here by God's grace want to be mindful here Romans 5 3 and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience now Glory means to have joy and it's very hard Church to Joy in your trials when they're really serious trials especially like when someone's sick like when brother amen got sick there or uh you know anytime you go through someone's cursing you someone's like Russell brother Austin gets really persecuted at work uh yelled at screamed at and part of it's I think because he's a Christian that's my opinion on it because they know where he stands but it's really hard I would say I'm not going to speak for Austin or brother amen or any of the trials we go through but I imagine it's pretty hard sometimes to be joyful right in the midst of the suffering so Paul of course says talking here from the soul of the believer because when someone's making fun of you or I've had this in the last few years people lie on me tell or call me the devil or call me all kinds of things I don't really particularly feel joyful in those situations but after I go through them and overcome now I can find joy in them so I guess after the fact praise God we can find a lot of joy in those victories because we see God God fought for us we'd have to fight for ourselves we just got to stand on God's word amen amen God fights for his people praise God so we join tribulations also knowing because we know this my trials will work me to be a better patient Christian right most of us believe or most of us understand it's we don't get everything we ask right away right but I make sure like when God healed Austin there uh two Sundays ago God healed him right there on the sermon I made sure we gave God glory right away in the parking lot I don't want to wait till Wednesday I want to glorify him right when it happens praise God because that don't happen all the time right if it does happen instantly then praise God let's let's tell Jesus thank you praise God let's be like that happy leper let's come back and say thank you Jesus amen I don't want to forget this I'm I'm so thankful when you answer prayers immediately praise God but I'm also thankful that you build patience in my life that I'm not gonna I'm not I'm not a complainer that if he don't answer one week well I just gave up I'll just leave Christianity must not be real must not be anything to it see but then God has to answer some of our prayers right away to show us he cares to give us that patience oh amen thank God Amen church I'm getting to something here this is the divine order on how to receive hope how to be a hopeful Christian you know I hear it all the time on the political you know I like to listen to the politics you know after I study and pray in the mornings and you know I'm out about my errands I'll listen to the politics and often these these politician guys will say you know it's hard to have any hope in this day it's hard to have any hope that's their key word like you got to keep hope and sometimes it's hard to have hope and I agree Washington's full of a bunch of devils no doubt about that No Doubt but the main thing they try to do is keep the people hopeful now if they're doing that without the Holy Ghost what should we be doing with the Holy Ghost because I got news for you that's what God wants to be in our lives he wants us to arrive at Hope that no matter what tribulation we're going through we can go through tribulations with joy and then you know we can have a patience and then we'll have character but ultimately the end game the end goal the desired result is so that you're hopeful that you're going to heaven and that Christ is in control of your life amen that's the goal now what is the opposite of hopeful hopeless oh I'll never get out of this situation God's Never Going To Hear My Prayer that's the opposite of what God wants to build in your life God wants to build hope in our lives amen right that's why I love this book that Paul wrote here so here's the three-step process after you get patient then you've got experience which just means character you got some real character right because you you've stood the test of time now you know how to stand as a Christian people can say wow I really see Christ in this brother I see Christ in this sister they've lived it not just for five days or a week they've lived it for a few months now they've lived it for a year my they've delivered it for a long time I respect this individual Hallelujah now what's the word character mean again here's character in the Greek it means approved so first you go through tests so you can be patient and then you have patience so you can be approved you can have a real character and then if you continue to grow in your character Paul says you'll end up in the state of hopefulness and here's what the Bible says or here's what the Lexicon says hope is expectation of good you expect something good to happen in the middle of inflation brother Jess in the middle of this political war in the middle of of the economy going down you can be hopeful yes you can praise God you can hope in Christ we don't know what the economy holds we don't know the future of that but we know who holds the future and we know Jesus Christ already won this battle that we're fighting we sang it on Sunday praise God we're fighting a battle he's already won church amen I like to change that song and say I know how the Bible ends Hallelujah we will be with him again hallelujah thank God Hallelujah so God wants to use four steps to give us an expectation of good now mostly most of you know Jeremiah 29 11. that's somebody's verse they just used recently can't remember we went to some event and that was their verse I thought that's a good event that's a good verse oh it was for your graduation yeah down in uh remember the name of that City Mount Vernon yeah there you go thank you for I know the thoughts that I think toward you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end so what is what does God want us to have he wants us to have hope for the future other versions say I know the plans that I have for you now this is this scripture is so easy to quote brother Rand reads this in the message desperation he says isn't that sweet that's true church isn't it isn't this sweet but the sad part is most Christians fail to read the next two verses in other words everybody wants to know God's got me at the end if I die God's Got Me if anything bad happens I know Jesus going to be right there to help me out yeah everybody wants to know that but what about the next part then so that means after you know you have an expected end after you've got hope then you'll call on God and you shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart amen everybody see what I'm talking about every every Church wants this but how many really seek God with all their heart like when it comes to the topic of homosexuality how many people when they answer that question how many preachers are they really going to the Bible to see what the Bible says are they just working with people's emotions well they're people just like us they deserve love just like everybody else well they they do they do believe love not letting them continue and not supporting their sin love would correct their sin right right everyone wants a good end but who wants to seek God church I remember I'm sure brother radio was like this too my wife and I and when we first came in this message all we did was listen to brother Brandon all right brother Ray all's I did was read the church age book that's all I did I wasn't on video games I wasn't at the movie theater didn't have apps at that time but wasn't it I wasn't reading the newspaper whatever I was always listening brother for him and always reading and Always setting that's all I did and church as I saw God I found God Amen and if you want hope if you weren't expected end you've got to seek God with all your heart praise God my wife can tell you that's why after we got married the day after we got married we didn't go on a honeymoon the death we got married we went to church today if we got married because I'm a seeking God with all my heart now that's we've laughed about that but it was just a sign of what was to come God knew I was going to be a pastor and she had pastor's wife God knew that but we we had already sought God with all of our hearts and people want our experience or our testimony or our whatever our life our time but have you saw God with all your heart praise God right each one of us have to look at that have we saw God with all of our hearts we all want God to have my back at the end we all want God to write me write me a great story God but how many of us are going to see God now praise God this is what the foolish version doesn't do they don't see God with all their heart for if they did Jesus would give him the Holy Ghost that's exactly right praise God see they just want to one verse they don't want the all they want to want all the verses about this Hallelujah like one summer I'll tell I was here on this brother Austin I think for a couple Summers as my first few years of teaching I painted for our school district so during the summer I didn't take the summer off I would just be painting all day it'd be a room like like any classroom I'd be taping up the walls you know and then I'd get the roller out and all day eight hours I got to listen to brother Brandon all day every day for two and a half months and Friends those words are still burned in my soul amen thank God Hallelujah brother Jose says all the time he said brother he looked up this quote and he's I find it like in a few seconds he's like how do you know that brother because God wrote it in my heart all those hours I'm like Glory I take a little break on my notepad right there I got to preach this one here we go I preach 125 sermons on just the Book of Revelation and seeing God do miracles in the midst of those see God answered prayers in the midst of those if you want hope if you want God to have your back at the end see God now Hallelujah with all you've got praise God that's what the Bible says seek God to seek the kingdom of God first God will give you everything else my wife and I are a witness of that like I was telling Austin Lena when we first got married we'd be packing peanut butter jellies every Sunday to church we behold Lydia eat peanut butter and jelly we didn't go out to eat at the beginning you know that's just how it was you know but we drove three hours to Lima or we drive an hour and a half up to Sheffield are they just support God's word with all we had listen to brother Rand the whole way there or songs all the way there and all the way back that's just you give yourself all to it praise God it's been the greatest blessing of Our Lives amen the peace on the word of God because it produces something it gives us patience it gives us character it gives us hope praise God amen so this is great for wise and foolish virgin all the all the verses want God to save them but who's willing to seek God with everything they got right now praise God now again this is Hope again but no notice hope seems to be a double confirmation of God's salvation what do you mean brother Jesse here's what I mean you remember years ago when I preached on the series on numerology I preached like 30 sermons on all the Bible numbers that was a great sir that was a great series at least for me I don't know about you brother random says the number four has lot at least three meanings he says it means Deliverance he says it could mean double confirmation and it's also an Earthly number I tell you it was a Deliverance for us when we got that house where we live at right now my wife and I made three offers on the house turned down all three on the last offer they accepted it praise God so number four snacks like that sometimes God's Works in numbers like that to give us deliverance from our situation we didn't what we had what probably four or five kids or four kids at that time three yeah three kids at that time run out of room God gave us a Deliverance of the house we're at now by God's grace just a small little testimony there with number four here's our brother random said two is a confirmation but four will confirm it it's a double confirmation so it seems uh two is like a testimony in four is like a double confirmation of the testimony now these are all the examples there's so many I don't have time to go through them all the prodigal son got four gifts right restoration or double confirmation he was back in the Covenant Bathsheba had four Sons double confirmation God had forgiven her sins the two Talent man got two more that's a double confirmation of his reward the Holy Ghost has four Witnesses double confirmation signs Miracles wonders and gifts four women were mentioned in Jesus's genealogy that's the double confirmation of how male and female are all one in Christ Jesus I preached this years ago so I'm not going to spend a lot of time with us um there's all kinds of force there's all kinds of force I'm just gonna I mean the rainbows mentioned four times double confirmation uh there's all kinds the four beasts for is an Earthly number there's earth air water fire there's north south east west there's four divisions of the day there's four night watches there's four great lunar phases you all I mean we went through this years ago four kinds of vessels they're four four crosses at Calvary there's four conditions you can end up in holy righteous filthy unjust there's four cherubims praise God not there's so many a lot see there's just all kinds of look at all these slides here I preach all these sermons back there but I like four as Deliverance also because at an idea receive Mercy because he grabbed the horns of the altar how many horns were there four job's first three friends were miserable comforters but his Forefront brought the victory praise God Amen well it was repentance it was a show job you got to repent and dust and Ashes praise God and then God was the fifth amen hallelujah Satan tries to imitate the four he's got four horse riders he's got four steps to death in James chapter one he's got four insects the four men had a vow to kill Paul's life to take Paul's life and Samson lied to Delilah three times but he revealed a secret at the fourth meeting leading to his blindness in slavery okay so I could go on and on Abraham defeated Four Kings to get lot back Israel leave Egypt in the fourth generation okay so see that number four There's Hope is the fourth step right tribulation patience character or experience and then hope so when we see a Christian I'll just use Brother Ray brother Raisman the message over 40 years and by God's grace we look at his life and we can see he has hope for the end of his life and for eternal life we don't look at Brother Ray and say he's hopeless why does he even come to church he's the one shouting and playing tambourine press testify and glorifying God he's that he's arrived at home amen he's got a double confirmation God has worked him through all the trials remember the brother who told me all those trials you went through remember that even with the churches there and the rain and all the trials you went through and alert you learning you growing as an individual those are tribulations but they produce patience and then it produces christ-like character and now brother has hope for the future praise God each one of us go through that and that hope is a double confirmation now you might call it a Deliverance that's fine but whatever it is that's where God's trying to get us to a place where we have hope in the Lord praise God and we're only going to get there by seeking God with all of our hearts amen amen if someone's in a hopeless Condition it's because they're not patient enough with God they're not letting God uh mold their character more like Christ because if they did that then they'd have hope and church sometimes sometimes people will blast hope hope hope you got to have faith well see that's in a different context that's in like let's say let's say let's say I'm sick yes in that case if I'm sick I want to have faith I want to have a revelation that I'm Healed right rather than just hope I hope I get healed right so you see what I mean people will blast hope and say like oh you got to have faith that's true for Divine Healing but just for a solid Christian Life just for a character I'll say like this mature character as a Christian hope is the Pinnacle that's what Paul says there a hopeful life a hopeful Christian Life is the Pinnacle because you've got character amen you've got patience and you have joy in your trials hallelujah thank God Amen Hallelujah but Brother Ray on the same token we wouldn't call names but how many message Believers that my wife knows to how many message Believers are hopeless and they've been sitting in churches for 20 or 30 or 40 years they that's somewhere along in that four-step process Church let me go back to that somewhere in that four-step process they haven't allowed God to deal with them they weren't joyful in tribulations they were they were impatient with God or they took uh they didn't have the right character they didn't obey Jesus and so they didn't have the character of Christ and that's why some of these people leave the message after 30 or 40 years we've seen it right here in our church where's the hope and we found out later well they didn't have the character God was never number one in their life and the church said amen they wouldn't seek God with all their hearts they wouldn't say Amen they wouldn't come up to the altar repent they wouldn't they wouldn't pray for five minutes or ten minutes they wouldn't do nothing they just came to church coming to church is not the evidence hallelujah it's Christ in you is the evidence amen Jesus Christ Living in you is the evidence praise God we're learning that but it's more and more as time goes on we're learning that praise God so I don't have time to preach that sermon because I want to finish this thought here tonight so the Divine orders of force that process and it's to produce character right character and then hope but this hope also has this character because Jesus wants us to reign in this life he doesn't want us to be a slave to our sins he wants us to bring our sins into captivity that's the whole goal of Our Lives is to Reign Over sin to put sinful habits to stop sinful habits and to develop a Godly Christian character because Paul said if we suffer we shall also reign with him if we deny him he will deny us so let's remember Hallelujah there are scenes of dancing as we've been we did on Sunday right but then there's seasons of mourning and the scenes of mourning we could call a season of suffering see we God so suffering getting through suffering and becoming a better Christian actually probably produces better character than just if you dance every service right because that's the first step is tribulation and then that builds right patience now I wish dancing was in that four-step process who doesn't right don't you wish shouting was in there somewhere [Music] well I guess you know glory and tribulations I guess I guess it's built in there so at some point you rejoice in your child's day thank God this is producing a real christ-like character in me that's right suffering produces character that Jesus says is fit to rule now I want to read this again I haven't read this for a while it's a very famous quote but I want to read it just to remind you I know you'll be blessed by it unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him so this is why Paul said we glory in our sufferings you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift I put that quote up when I was teaching third grade I put that quote up in my classroom above everything above the alphabet above I said character is a victory not a gift people would ask me say Mr Smith where'd you get that quote I said from God's Prophet brother Brandon who's he uh he was a prophet we follow him okay then they just move on but I wanted I might put it up this year maybe by God's grace and you're number 20 maybe I'll put it up there again but I just love that I had to remember I'm my whole battle here when I battle spirits in my classroom right nine and a half months out of the Year this is producing a character in me I want the children I went to principal I want the teachers to see Jesus Christ and me so do you and all your family your friends your church members your co-workers your your uh your your classmates you want them to see Christ in you character is a victory November character is the third step right on those four characters the third one that's experience a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic remember if they try to Reign their sins will find them out right but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcome and is set down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him so Church let's have a fresh reminder you know you went through trials this week I went through trials this week we all go through trials this week but remember this is producing christ-like character this is producing something good you've got to go through this to get the patience and then character and then hope we've all got to go through it praise God the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that we will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid out for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation think about the millennium just The Treasure of you get to build houses and your children will live in those houses they'll never get kicked out their lease is a Thousand Years brother awesome when you build when you build a house of Millennium you got a lease for a thousand years right right the Bible said you'll build it you'll live in it and have it and nobody else will live in it praise God right and then you got some some of us will have rods of iron and will rule over five cities or maybe 10. maybe four or maybe three these are all rewards that sometimes we forget about but these are the treasures laid up how about a crowd remember uh remember the 420 Elders got crowns in heaven a wonderful where crowns are in the millennium how about that Pure White robe that righteousness of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah praise God these are Treasures that are laid up but it takes character in our lives in order to receive these Rewards and that comes through the four-step process and hope so hope is this final is this final condition we want to be in a hopeful Christian hope has no disappointments because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given to us so hope doesn't get disappointed because you have God's love in your heart now I want to read this I thought this was inspired Hope Has No disappointments indwelling love or the baptism of the Holy Ghost produces hope no matter what God allows in our lives we will have no disappointments right that's what the Bible says hope is not ashamed well God I'm ashamed that you did this I'm God I'm ashamed of you no when you've reached mature hope you're hopeful there's no disappointments in life right now we may be disappointed with our mistakes but like Abraham God will make them all work for his glory I'm so disappointed uh you know that I I made this mistake in my life I'm so disappointed don't be learn from your mistake and then understand God will make this work for his glory you had to make that mistake so you learned the lesson you don't do it next time that's the purpose of it if you'd have been strong enough you wouldn't have fallen into that mistake to be a church isn't that beautiful I love this verse I read I was reading one of the commentaries and he and he said Hope Has No disappointments I'm like there it is and so then I wrote that after reading that once you reach this mature state of hope you're not disappointed with your life you know God's got it all right right you know God's in control you know God knew about this before the foundation of the world so I have nothing to be disappointed in right remember Stephen was stoned right and many you know even even as a man I feel bad he was the only I think he was 29. history says I thought man he could have had wife and children but think about the joy of seeing Jesus stand to receive and the Bible said Jesus was standing when Philip was I'm sorry when Stephen was crossing over into heaven do you think he'd want to leave Jesus and come back and say well I'd rather start a family and I'll start a business actually you know no no there's no disappointments so if you die a martyr or if you die in a car crash or you know whatever you would however you die like there's no disappointments because you've got the love of God in your heart you know you love God God loves you and God wouldn't let anything happen unless it would work for his glory praise God oh that's beautiful praise God amen you think Stephen would say no Jesus you're you're very glorious but I would like to go back to the Earth that's like hope when hope died right by the ram called that spear back as a prophet and she said why'd you call me back it was so beautiful right there's no disappointments and she died at a young mother and she had she had Little Billy Paul was it what year and a half and she's even with a year and a half vote no Channel that's hard for mothers right that's hard even for dads to understand when the love of God is in your heart there's no disappointment because God is going to take care of it remember that verse earlier Jeremiah 29 11. God loves me he's got plans for me he has an expected end for my life in other words God has already written this story God already wrote The End Of My Life Hope Has No disappointments the church so when we can be mature and live in the hope of God there's no there's no disappointments in our life oh I didn't get in that college I wanted I didn't get that uh I didn't get that uh promotion I wanted I didn't get this that I went I didn't get that house that I wanted that well if we look at God's if we look at God's word and God's plan the Bible said God has a plan for us amen and it must not be in the plan of God and either way God's not done with me he's going to work on me and he's going to help me to see 2020 Vision that's a good thing that didn't happen because it's producing character in my life Hallelujah so see church this proves love is the greatest force in the universe this proves it right here no matter what God allows to happen in my life I won't be ashamed I won't be disappointed because God's love is in my heart I know God loves me and I love God Amen I love God and God loves me that's how I know because all things work together for God's for God's glory everything will work together for good Now give me 10 minutes here there's my timer give me 10 more minutes I'll try to close by eight o'clock let's read this again it's so beautiful and we know do we know sometimes we forget them here but thank God we know down in here praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus amen we think a lot of things we shouldn't think right but we know in our soul all things work together for good I think about like this what if Tim Myers would have stayed here as pastor I wouldn't have been the pastor which you might say Amen hopefully you me being pastor but I think my whole life could be different and look where look what the decisions our brothers made you know which is he's allowed to make whatever decisions he wants but I can look back and see look at the time it was hard to see him move down North Carolina but now I can look back and say all things work together for good to them and I was the first pastor and the only Pastor so far at this church now God can do whatever he wants but like that song says look where I'm standing now sister who remember that one look where I'm standing now amen look where we're standing in Christ Hallelujah we got the word we got the Revelation the word we got the truth we got God's blessings on our lives we got Souls being saved we got Souls that come back praise God we've got Souls that are staying we got new souls and the main thing is our souls our servant Jesus Christ hallelujah amen and he's producing his character in our lives he's building up hope in our lives all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose it's a great one with Lena too like Austin not left where would Lena be like she don't even want to think where she wants to be neither would I want to where neither would I want to think where where would I be if Simon didn't come share a serpent seat with me where would I be yeah I'd probably be at the chapel like my other friends were which not necessarily is a bad place but it sure isn't the full word of God I want to be in the forward of God amen thank God what if I would not have got hurt on football what if I would have made the NFL where would I be now think about that I'm I can look back and see all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose so see we want to remember our lives are for his purpose not for our wants my life is not about what I want to achieve or what I want my life is about saying just like Jesus prayed father let your will be done not my will praise God and then help me to accept your purpose and help me to live for your purpose what's your purpose that's the great question what is God's purpose for my life now if you can find that then you can be happy and you can have hope Lord what is your purpose for my life don't you love this book of Romans my goodness I've got numerous people feedbacks and I'm really liking this series I'm like me too thank God Hallelujah Church like I read those quotes on Sunday brother said the Holy Ghost will never point you to anything else except the word of God and so when we when we preach on the book of the Bible we get overtime Holy Ghost pointing us to the word I mean it's overtime some people just preach all programmed stories that's fine and that's okay if it points you to the to them if we're just in the Bible all the Bible and then bringing in small little stories here and there like I did on Sunday remember the remember the the cult story on Sunday Hallelujah but if we're just in the I mean the more we're in the word and letting the word change us then the more we can say the Holy Ghost is pointing us to the word the more we're Guided by the Holy Ghost because we're pointing to God's word hallelujah so all things work together for good for your life because he foreknew you and he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son so all your sufferings are producing a christ-like character that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren but what is one of those what's the first component suffering tribulation got to go through trials got to go through tests where you feel like giving up or you feel like it's really difficult or you're between a rock and a hard place you got to go through those in order to gain more patience with God doesn't want spoiled brats like God I got a problem I'm going to take out my faith and I'm going to solve this problem every time now there's no more problems I don't want to spoil brat like that God wants a patient child like the children ask me daddy when are we going to have a we're gonna have a perfect bar you know we're going to have a perfect bar yesterday I said no gotta wait till tomorrow night after church well see they got patience because they didn't throw a fit well Zion might have threw a little bit of fitment he's only two you know is he sleeping now everybody else like oh yeah I can wait because I've got patience not so much on Zion all the time that in church that's how we are right we want it now now now now let's not be impatient let's be patient that he might and he was the firstborn the Holy Ghost came down from heaven and uh anointed his soul and that means all the rest of the Saints are going to have that birthing of the Soul because he was the firstborn okay I'm almost out of time here um let me see uh let me uh let me close to this and I'm going to tell a little story here okay so church have you noticed with this little series here um you know all the history says Paul was solving the problem between these Jews these legalistic Jews and these Gentiles that didn't know the law and he was trying he's trying to find a common place for them all to gather so he first had to show them you're all Sinners you're all desperately in need of a savior you're all lost you've all fallen short of the glory of God he said but then just like Abraham if you believe on God without works God will give you his righteousness if you just repent and then he goes through this chapter here now you have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ in other words God Paul's trying to show how do I get these legalists to get out of their legalism how to get these Sinners these sin lovers to to find peace with God and he said this is the answer you're all Sinners you all need the cross of Jesus Christ This Is The Answer amen hallelujah praise God in other words you all need to repent your sins uh give me baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ get Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and now you can serve God they were trying to avoid God in their sins and then the Gentiles and the Jews are trying to please God with legalism right and church Simon preached a good thought Malachi you might have heard it you know the law was a Schoolmaster to bring us to Christ and Simon brought this thought out it was very good on Sunday at his home Church in the law you had to circumcise A boy eight days after he was born well all the time that Eighth Day fell on a Sabbath day and no one's supposed to work on a Sabbath day it was against the law to do any work on the Sabbath Sabbath but every Sabbath guess what the priest had to get there and they had to do the surgery and circumcise and do the works in other words God's law was set up with 613 Commandments it was set up where you're going to see some of them I have to break some of them in other words to fulfill other ones in other words I can't keep all the law I don't have the ability to keep all the law of God because there are so many laws that was teaching us I can't do it on my own I need Grace Hallelujah I need I need God's righteousness I can't do it on myself I need the righteousness of God and the only way I can get that is through a free gift of God Amen I love that it's just a beautiful thought just like the priests every Sabbath they had to sacrifice animals do circumcision even Jesus said they'd blaspheme the Sabbath but yet they were called to do it right and it was a school master to point us to Christ Hallelujah that we can't do it on our own no matter how hard we try we've got to trust God we've got to accept God's God's gift so hard for Americans to accept gifts like it's even hard for me to ask for help like our mower broke and so we have you know we have almost an acre so I'm out there I spent about four hours out there with my weed eater trying to mow the grass because I'm too proud to go ask my neighbor can I borrow your lawnmower now that's just me I'd rather sit out there and waste all those hours because I'm just I don't want to borrow somebody's lawnmower I don't want to I don't want to lean on somebody else now in hindsight I should have called a lawn mowing company and they should have mowed my lawn that would have been a much better use of my time and money but now I got hindsight in case my lawnmower breaks down again but that's just how we are right we don't want to accept a free gift but with Jesus you have to accept a free gift amen you have to accept the free gift praise God and you've got to rejoice in his gift and you got to just trust it trust in the word of God because God's word cannot fail praise God and so what do brother Rams say that's what I love about the book of Romans now brother Raymond ends at church age with this quote not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me or join my church or start some fellowship in organization I've never done that and will not do that now I have no interest in those things but I have an interest in the things of God and people I'm gonna stop right there brother Brandon moved out to Arizona in January of 1963. and he didn't start a church he could have all the people would have flocked to his church but he didn't and so see Church his life proves these words are right that's what I love about brother Brandon he was totally transparent his life backs up these words and then you know and then right before he passes the Holy Spirit tells him you know my family needs a home church so brother Perry green started Church I don't know how long his family went there but they should have kept going because that's what brother I said this to you brother I said this is my home church now the Tucson Tabernacles on tape you can hear it brother bam said now what did Brother Brandon want to accomplish Church he said if I can accomplish just one thing I'll be Satisfied the one thing is to see establish a true spiritual relationship between God and man where men become new creatures in Christ filled with the spirit and live according to his word I would invite plead and warn all to hear his voice at this time and yield your lives completely to him even as I trust in my heart that I've given my all to him God bless you and may his coming Rejoice your heart that's to me what the book of Romans is all about it brings a true relationship between God and man we're all sinners none of us could keep the law uh and others were just running after sins you know the only place where we can find peace is in the Lord Jesus Christ therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ let's stand to our feet musicians can come stop the live stream I'm gonna share one more story about the peace of God
