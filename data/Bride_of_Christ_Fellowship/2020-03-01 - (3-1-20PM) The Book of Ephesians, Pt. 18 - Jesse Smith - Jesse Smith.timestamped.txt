[29:05] I still got that purpose series I want
[29:06] to mention get back to that the kind of
[29:09] feeling led of the Lord to go this
[29:10] direction here with the Ephesians series
[29:25] sophie's ins for let's go to verse kind
[29:32] of ended right there at verse 29
[29:36] beatings 429 you know how sometimes you
[29:46] guys sing after service I was gonna say
[29:48] well we have everybody come up we have

[30:16] presence of the Lord praise God and he's
[30:19] great and greatly to be praised amen
[30:23] I always want to wear out my voice I'm
[30:25] sure Amen does - we just want to wear
[30:27] out our voice that's our that's our
[30:29] sacrifice let's do that by God's grace
[30:31] visions for verse 29 we'll try to
[30:37] continue
[30:38] this chapter Lord willing I kind of
[30:40] would look at the grieving of the Holy
[30:41] Spirit tonight
[30:43] and of course the the pleasing of the
[30:45] Holy Spirit and then Lord willing we
[30:48] want to get to chapter 5 verse 1 and
[30:51] look at that thought about the Veil the
[30:56] veil over the heart so by God's grace
[31:01] let's read verse 29 together
[31:04] Ephesians 4:29 let's begin on three one
[31:07] two three let no corrupt communication
[31:10] proceed out of your mouth but that which
[31:14] is good to the use of edifying that it
[31:18] may Minister grace unto the ears so how
[31:21] many you look at your life as say I'm a
[31:23] minister do we look at that our lives
[31:25] that way we minister we serve other
[31:27] people by our words that we say how many
[31:30] ministers we got here phrase God
[31:32] everybody's handed me up James hands up
[31:34] right there right James look at that now
[31:38] we're not all preachers but we all
[31:40] preach by our lives right like my mentor
[31:42] says preach me a sermon live me a sermon
[31:44] rather than preach one right so that's
[31:47] my heads forward of prayer here as we
[31:49] approach the throne of God here and
[31:52] let's ask God to minister to us Heavenly
[31:54] Father we love you we asking you Lord to
[31:56] minister to us that we might minister to
[31:58] others we want to minister edification
[32:01] we want to minister hope and grace and
[32:03] peace and love dear God I pray Lord take
[32:07] your word now bless it to our hearts as
[32:08] we go scripture by scripture and pull
[32:11] out these nuggets Lord God and these
[32:12] these truths that we love and father
[32:15] just quicken them to our hearts let's
[32:17] walk in victory we've seen these songs
[32:18] we will see miracles we will see Giants
[32:21] fall thank God
[32:22] hallelujah we'll see strongholds fallen
[32:25] Lord God is so true we see it in our
[32:27] lives now we thank you for it this is
[32:29] the revival of this entire world this
[32:31] message is the revival because we're
[32:34] revived to the true Word of God so thank
[32:36] you Lord God and our God is greater and
[32:38] stronger so we're so thankful Lord God
[32:40] that your presence be felt here tonight
[32:43] minister now to us in Jesus Christ's
[32:45] name the church said Amen god bless you
[32:47] didn't see that I'll try to just watch
[32:49] my time here so don't where everybody
[32:50] out
[32:51] nor myself so you can switch over I just
[32:56] want to put that visual up there again
[32:59] and I just want to kind of go to script
[33:02] these scripture by scripture now let's
[33:06] look here we'll go right to this
[33:11] scripture here so no corrupt
[33:13] communication the Bible says but that
[33:18] which is good to the use of edifying now
[33:21] edify means to build up the act of one
[33:25] who promotes another's growth in
[33:27] Christian wisdom and piety or happiness
[33:32] so our words are to build each other up
[33:36] to make us more wise right to make us
[33:39] more wise more pious more respectful for
[33:41] God not to corrupt or tear people down
[33:45] but to build up praise God and then we
[33:48] Minister grace which grace is unmerited
[33:51] favor so we're supposed to minister
[33:54] grace to other people through our words
[33:57] praise God that's why I don't feel bad
[33:59] you know saying god bless you to people
[34:01] that probably maybe they're not blessed
[34:03] by God I don't know but I want
[34:06] administer grace with my words praise
[34:09] God I want to administer I want to be
[34:11] some form of hope because most people
[34:13] Church are just being torn down you
[34:14] imagine that most people are being torn
[34:16] down by their friends their family their
[34:18] children their their co-workers I want
[34:20] to be a person that's remembered as
[34:22] building people up because I extend
[34:24] grace to them praise God extend love and
[34:27] so this is the scripture where it says
[34:30] edify the Bible says in with grace unto
[34:35] the hearers praise God so that's the
[34:40] first one I will look at verse 29 now
[34:42] verse 30 I want to spend a few minutes
[34:43] here and grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[34:49] God whereby you're sealed unto the day
[34:53] of your Redemption now just reminder
[34:57] you're sealed by him for the day of
[35:00] redemption that's why he seals you for
[35:03] that day praise God
[35:05] so you won't fall away before that day
[35:07] that you'll be preserved for that day
[35:09] amen
[35:11] that's why were sealed for that day
[35:12] praise God so there's where we're
[35:15] guaranteed to be there praise God
[35:17] we're sealed to that day but yet we
[35:21] still grieve him where we grieve alone
[35:23] in our minds when we put on the old man
[35:25] that's where we grieve him I don't know
[35:28] if you knew this church but grieve this
[35:29] word means to make God sorrowful and
[35:33] this one would look at for a few moments
[35:34] to affect with sadness it also means to
[35:41] cause grief to throw into sorrow to
[35:44] offend to make one one easy to cause him
[35:48] a scruple so how many know that the Holy
[35:52] Spirit gets sad you read that he gets
[35:58] grieved he gets sorrowful it's it's
[36:01] there's numerous places in the scripture
[36:02] where it talks about that I just want to
[36:04] tell a quick story
[36:05] you know Bob Arum always compares it to
[36:07] a dove right he compares the Holy Spirit
[36:09] to a dove and if you offended of or you
[36:11] growl at a dove were they gonna do
[36:13] they're gonna fly away right and so what
[36:17] I was saying he's not saying you can
[36:20] lose your seal but you lose your
[36:22] anointing in your mind your human spirit
[36:25] so the Dove can fly away from your
[36:27] thinking and here let me give you a
[36:29] concrete example where brother man uses
[36:31] that he says I wonder tonight if there
[36:33] would be someone here who'd be convinced
[36:36] in their own heart that you grieve the
[36:38] spirit away from you the Dove is gone
[36:41] now some people might say the Dove the
[36:43] seal
[36:44] how can I use my seal that's not what
[36:46] he's saying this the anointing is gone
[36:49] you don't have it sweet peace no more
[36:52] you don't go to the sink to wash your
[36:54] dishes and look out the window to see if
[36:57] you can see him coming so that's the
[37:00] sweetness of the Holy Spirit when you're
[37:02] going about your daily job washing
[37:04] dishes and I do a little bit of that
[37:05] just a little bit when you're on the job
[37:09] you should be able to look out on your
[37:10] break right and you should look I wonder
[37:12] if he's come in the sky today that's
[37:15] what real ramjets
[37:16] that's the sweetness of the Holy Spirit
[37:20] I've done that before I've been driving
[37:22] down the road just singing and look up
[37:24] at the sky eastern sky and just imagine
[37:28] him trying to break through the clouds
[37:29] there oh so wonder if this will be the
[37:31] day you ever feel like that that's what
[37:33] he says it's like you don't drive your
[37:37] car down the road going to work brother
[37:38] when you get a chance to look out the
[37:40] window to look into the skies and feel
[37:42] that sweet deep peace in your heart like
[37:45] you used to something happened the Dove
[37:49] took its flight so it's right here when
[37:51] we lie
[37:52] well we're angry with too much wrath
[37:54] right passionate wrath steal gossip the
[37:58] Holy Spirit takes his flight its
[38:00] offended I've never seen a cockatiel
[38:04] bird before anyone see you have a
[38:06] cockatiel bird what bird do you have
[38:11] okay I thought was a yeah but you have a
[38:13] bird so growing up I had a bird we had a
[38:16] cockatiel bird you ever seen they're
[38:18] white and they got these big yellow
[38:19] cheeks now my mom I'm not gonna say much
[38:22] but my mom wasn't a very sanitary person
[38:24] so she let the bird fly all around you
[38:26] can imagine the mess that made okay
[38:27] that's as far as I'm gonna go
[38:29] but at first the bird was so scared
[38:34] wouldn't even fly towards any of us and
[38:36] then pretty soon we would just be
[38:37] sitting there watching TV like couch
[38:38] potatoes you know and all of a sudden
[38:40] the cockatiel would land on your
[38:42] shoulder nose like whoa you know I still
[38:44] remember that it would land and then
[38:46] like you know you if you kind of moved
[38:49] it would fly away but the more got used
[38:52] to us it would sit there and then it
[38:54] would it would let us pet the bird like
[38:56] we could pet under it would put his head
[38:58] down and we would pet that bird and you
[39:00] could pull back the feathers and see
[39:01] it's pink skin but if somebody opened
[39:05] the door real quick it would fly away or
[39:07] if you move real quick it would fly away
[39:09] and I thought that's a perfect
[39:10] illustration of the Holy Spirit it was
[39:13] like my sister could talk to that bird I
[39:17] don't know if you how crazy people are
[39:19] here or not maybe I'm crazy but honestly
[39:24] it felt like my sister could talk to
[39:26] that bird and understand it and it would
[39:28] make noises and COO back my sister had a
[39:30] real intimate relationship with that
[39:32] bird
[39:33] because like there's some type of
[39:34] kinship and I never had that much
[39:37] kinship with the bird but she was so
[39:40] close to that bird that it was like this
[39:42] experience almost like the Dove of the
[39:44] Holy Spirit she was the favorite and the
[39:49] Dove would the cockatoo would fly in and
[39:52] always go right to her if she was there
[39:54] and she'd feed it you know and get the
[39:57] the birdseed out there and COO and just
[40:00] like brother have said just COO and
[40:01] share it's love you know and that's
[40:04] exactly like the Holy Spirit is for us
[40:06] but they it would get offended if you
[40:08] slam the door or if you yell it would
[40:11] get offended or if you move really quick
[40:13] it get offended and fly away you have to
[40:15] wait till it come back it didn't come
[40:17] back when you wanted to it came back on
[40:18] its own terms so is the Holy Spirit the
[40:24] Bible said grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[40:27] God whereby you're sealed offend him now
[40:30] now let's go through a few I'm not going
[40:32] to read them all but did you know
[40:35] Genesis 6:3 the Bible said God's Spirit
[40:37] is he said will not always strive with
[40:39] man
[40:40] that means contend God's Spirit will not
[40:43] always wrestle with a man and try to get
[40:45] him to repent Genesis 6 6 it repented
[40:49] the Lord that he had made man on the
[40:50] earth and it grieved him the Bible said
[40:53] at his heart so the same idea of God
[40:57] being sorrowful sad in the days of Noah
[41:00] and here we are in the days of no right
[41:01] as it was the days of Noah so shall be
[41:04] in the coming of the Son of man and the
[41:06] Bible says grieve not offend not don't
[41:09] make the Holy Spirit said now here's a
[41:12] good one to the the Bible said when
[41:16] Jesus looked around on them with anger
[41:18] speaking of the Pharisees being grieved
[41:20] for the hardness of their hearts he said
[41:23] to the man stretch forth thine hand and
[41:25] Mark 3:5 and he stretched it out and his
[41:27] hand was restored whole as the other
[41:30] so whenever the Holy Spirit comes into a
[41:33] service and hearts are grieved and they
[41:36] don't want to believe and they don't
[41:37] want to move on with God and they don't
[41:39] want to worship God gets grieved God
[41:43] gets sorrowful in this case Jesus got
[41:46] angry Jesus got upset that they wouldn't
[41:50] believe in the miracles and Jesus of
[41:54] course is God in flesh right the Word
[41:57] made flesh so we can see Jesus acting
[42:01] the same way as the Holy Spirit did in
[42:03] the days of Noah right and so we know
[42:06] that Jesus worked the same way his
[42:07] Spirit worked the same way today in the
[42:10] last days of Noah right so we see the
[42:14] same idea we don't want to make God
[42:16] angry doing we don't want to make God
[42:19] upset with us praise God
[42:22] so we must be careful how we respond to
[42:24] the Word of God remember Stephen prays
[42:28] and you stiff-necked and uncircumcised
[42:30] in heart and ears you do always resist
[42:32] the Holy Ghost he said as your fathers
[42:35] do so do you the Bible says quench not
[42:41] the Holy Spirit and that word is like a
[42:42] fire extinguish your brother and sister
[42:44] the Holy Spirit's like a fire it wants
[42:47] to move to every heart he said don't
[42:49] quench it don't got your fire
[42:50] extinguisher and try to cool in other
[42:52] words don't try to cool somebody off
[42:54] Amen if somebody's having a good time
[42:56] don't try to cool him off you just be
[42:58] happy for praise God you keep that fire
[43:00] going if you stir that verse enough
[43:02] praise keep praying keep singing keep
[43:04] worshiping like you do keep amen in the
[43:06] word like you do just stay on fire don't
[43:08] clench that Holy Spirit
[43:10] hey man try to keep that fire burning
[43:12] praise the Lord
[43:14] thank the Lord so you got to keep it
[43:17] burning keep it
[43:19] BIRT moving keep it growing in the
[43:22] things of God
[43:23] now hebrews 3:10 says God was grieved
[43:28] with that generation of Israel in the
[43:31] wilderness and said they do always err
[43:34] in their heart they have not known my
[43:35] ways remember this is the this is the
[43:37] generation that saw the Exodus they saw
[43:40] the Red Sea miracles
[43:41] they saw manna right they saw water out
[43:44] of a rock they saw all these things that
[43:46] they kept complaining may God help us
[43:48] not to complain when we complain we
[43:51] surely grieve the Holy Spirit right
[43:53] wherefore I was grieved with that
[43:55] generation because they always do err
[43:59] their heart honey thankful for your good
[44:00] health today how many thank mover the
[44:03] food on your table
[44:04] aim ahead let's be thankful praise God
[44:07] how many thankful for your home church
[44:08] amen how the area we're thankful we
[44:13] don't want to grieve and offend and
[44:15] upset that sweet Holy Spirit we wanted
[44:18] to stay right here with us praise God
[44:20] amen
[44:21] I mean I'm over the year search I've had
[44:27] numerous people come into our church and
[44:29] they'll email me later but Amen they'll
[44:30] be like there's such a sweet atmosphere
[44:32] in your church that I get emails from
[44:36] that debt from numerous people over I'll
[44:38] just like specially preachers it's so
[44:40] easy to preach there's a sweet
[44:41] atmosphere now church what atmosphere is
[44:44] that is that a human atmosphere or is
[44:46] that the Holy Spirit it's got to be the
[44:49] Holy Spirit and I've been to churches
[44:52] where it's hard to preach to certain
[44:53] churches because the people are so rough
[44:55] against it they don't want it their
[44:57] hearts are hardened but we never want
[45:00] that to be our the condition of our
[45:02] church where we grieve the Holy Spirit
[45:04] and we can't feel God's presence anymore
[45:07] we always want to keep an atmosphere
[45:09] where God's presence can sweep down the
[45:11] church and we can feel fresh and we can
[45:14] feel new and we can feel in love with
[45:17] the Lord and we can feel his presence
[45:18] praise God he repeats the same thing in
[45:24] Hebrews 3:17 but with whom was he
[45:27] grieved 40 years was it not them that
[45:29] had sinned whose carcasses fell in the
[45:31] wilderness now this is an interesting
[45:35] thought I want to just briefly share
[45:38] with you I heard a preacher
[45:42] say this I really liked it the Holy
[45:45] Spirit is a very straightforward spirit
[45:49] like when brother Ram lied to the IRS
[45:51] the Holy Spirit didn't say well you
[45:53] might want to consider repenting what
[45:56] the Holy Spirit say what do you say
[45:57] about his hands he said take your take
[46:00] your lying dirty hands off the baby
[46:04] right did Jesus look at the Pharisees
[46:09] and say you might want to consider
[46:10] repenting you kind of got some hard
[46:13] hearts is that exactly that I did
[46:15] address them now don't get me wrong
[46:19] God's a gentleman but many times we we
[46:23] need a reminder that the Lord is very
[46:24] straightforward
[46:26] praise God very straightforward in other
[46:30] words like the Holy Spirit won't beat
[46:31] around the bush right when he's grieved
[46:38] he's sad and the Bible said sorrowful
[46:41] he's offended to make sure how do we get
[46:44] back with his good graces again by
[46:47] repenting saying we're sorry changing
[46:51] our actions our behaviors and the Bible
[46:58] says you can see it and even how you
[46:59] treat your brothers Romans 1415 but if
[47:03] thy brother be grieved with thy meat now
[47:06] walkest thou not charitably destroy not
[47:08] him with thy meat for whom Christ died
[47:11] you ever seen you ever grieve somebody
[47:14] in our church never grieved anybody in
[47:16] your family I've done it before I've
[47:18] hurt people's feelings that you just see
[47:20] their faces kind of go like you maybe
[47:22] you don't mean to grieve them but you
[47:24] just grieve them you know you just hurt
[47:26] people's feelings and we all fall short
[47:29] of God's glory but we should be able to
[47:33] if we can sense when other people are
[47:35] grieved usually like with us maybe we
[47:38] won't talk anymore or you won't want to
[47:40] talk to her very long anymore you won't
[47:42] look you won't look somebody in the eye
[47:43] anymore you know one to be around him
[47:47] anymore they don't shake your hand for a
[47:49] little bit you know grieving you've
[47:52] offended people we've made people sad
[47:54] we've been sorrowful
[47:56] I just want to dwell on this for a
[47:57] moment longer the Holy Spirit can be
[48:02] grieved and it's done when we take off
[48:05] the new man and we get that we let the
[48:07] enemy come in and anoint and take a
[48:10] place in our minds and we say the wrong
[48:12] thing the Dove takes its flight and we
[48:17] got to invite that Dove to come back
[48:19] praise God
[48:20] through repentance amen so let's not
[48:25] forget those thoughts there I just want
[48:27] to share a few of those stories there
[48:29] and a few of those thoughts like with
[48:31] that bird in our house that's a great
[48:33] illustration and we must not offend the
[48:37] Holy Spirit because the Bible says don't
[48:39] grieve him because you're sealed by him
[48:41] unto the day of your redemption what a
[48:43] what a what a paradox
[48:45] I can upset him but yet I'm still sealed
[48:48] by him can anybody explain that I know
[48:52] we can by this than three parts of man
[48:53] what a paradox
[48:55] I can offend his anointing in one area
[48:58] but another area I've got eternal life
[49:00] that's quite the right quite the thing
[49:03] quite the thought he can he can quicken
[49:07] me and my soul I can have his nature in
[49:10] my soul but yet in my mind I've offended
[49:13] him now we're getting down to the
[49:17] mysteries of God right the great mystery
[49:20] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Christ
[49:21] in you the hope of glory it's quite a
[49:24] quite a paradox there now let's move on
[49:27] now verse 31 let all bitterness wrath
[49:31] and anger and clamor and evil speaking
[49:33] be put away from you with all malice
[49:36] let's go through these definitions here
[49:38] bitterness is extreme wickedness
[49:41] producing a bitter fruit so like the
[49:45] Bible talks about roots of bitterness
[49:47] you are extremely wicked you have
[49:50] extremely wicked thoughts and attitudes
[49:52] toward people that's bitterness wrath
[49:56] means passion anger heat boiling up and
[50:00] soon subsiding again anger is the temper
[50:07] agitation of the desire impulse violent
[50:11] emotion high clamour is an outcry so
[50:18] there's this must be some type of sinful
[50:20] clamor or outcry a crying against
[50:23] someone in a sinful way I don't know
[50:26] much about that word evil speaking is
[50:29] slander right injure someone's good name
[50:33] so that all that be put away that's why
[50:38] I didn't put those brother's names by
[50:40] Rams sons I didn't put their names on
[50:41] the video because I'm not trying to hurt
[50:43] their name but I thought what well with
[50:46] millions of people being influenced by
[50:47] them I've got to get this out people
[50:50] need to hear this because it's the I
[50:53] believe it's the spirit of idolatry evil
[50:58] speaking yes that's right now malice is
[51:01] ill will or desire to injure someone
[51:06] and it says wickedness that's not
[51:09] ashamed to break God's laws Wow put all
[51:14] that away any bitter feelings any wrath
[51:17] and the outcry anger evil speaking put
[51:21] it away from you put all malice or ill
[51:24] will toward I'm sorry towards others put
[51:27] it away
[51:28] Church we should want the best for our
[51:30] enemies that's that's tough that's tough
[51:35] think about the purse
[51:37] that's asked you last time I know amen
[51:39] got it at the work of I'll go I've got a
[51:43] couple of times to think about I only
[51:46] want the best for that person that's
[51:49] putting all mouths away the Bible said
[51:53] put that all away verse 32 and be kind
[51:57] one to another tender-hearted forgiving
[52:01] one another even as God for Christ's
[52:03] sake has forgiven you in the head
[52:05] praise God why are we willing to forgive
[52:08] them because God has forgiven me for
[52:11] Christ's sake amen I can forgive others
[52:14] because Christ forgave me that's our
[52:17] whole motivation behind this behind
[52:20] being someone who doesn't grieve the
[52:22] Holy Spirit so so someone who pleases
[52:25] the Holy Spirit will put all the ill
[52:27] feelings away all that revenge all the
[52:30] bitterness all the evil words and
[52:32] they'll please the Holy Spirit and
[52:35] they'll be tender-hearted with
[52:38] compassion for sinners amen my passion
[52:43] for sinners now I want to get to the
[52:48] main thought here yeah leave this main
[52:50] thought here maybe got 20 more minutes
[52:55] here I want to just oh maybe I'll just
[52:56] close with this thought here next 20
[52:58] minutes or so yeah Lord willing let's
[53:02] look at this thought here now let's move
[53:05] on now to chapter 5 we're still in the
[53:07] walk of the believer
[53:09] isn't it amazing you can be dwelt you
[53:12] can be I'm sorry give me indwelt by the
[53:14] Holy Spirit in your soul but in your
[53:17] mind you got to constantly flip-flop
[53:18] from old to new old to new stay new stay
[53:21] new keep it true keep it peaceful keep
[53:24] it generous it's a constant battle to
[53:27] not be taken captive by the enemy's lies
[53:30] my god help us now I just had this
[53:35] thought come to me in chapter 5 this
[53:38] morning and as I was preparing here
[53:40] visions 5 verse 1 be therefore followers
[53:44] of God as dear children
[53:48] praise God now dear means beloved so if
[53:52] you are one of God's precious children
[53:54] he said make sure you're following the
[53:57] father if you are one of the God's
[54:00] precious little ones make sure your
[54:02] father you're following your heavenly
[54:04] father
[54:06] now the word follower means imitator
[54:10] glory he said it walk in love and verse
[54:15] two walk in love as Christ also hath
[54:18] loved us and given us gift given himself
[54:21] for us and offering and a sacrifice to
[54:24] God for a sweet-smelling savour I'm not
[54:30] gonna look at the sweet-smelling savour
[54:31] that kind of deals with the Old
[54:32] Testament sacrifices which that's a
[54:34] beautiful thought I preached in a little
[54:35] bit but I just wanna look at the
[54:37] imitators for a moment
[54:42] so children of God beloved children of
[54:45] God imitate their father now how do you
[54:48] imitate the father the Bible says you
[54:50] look into the word that's how you
[54:52] imitate the father that's how you do it
[54:55] praise God so let's go over that
[54:59] scripture here let's look at the
[55:00] scriptures and confirm that to you by
[55:03] the grace Lord go to James chapter 1 I
[55:05] just preached this at Bible Club a few
[55:08] weeks ago James chapter 1 verse 22 I
[55:19] like to start there James 1:22 now if a
[55:23] little bit a little bit of history on
[55:24] James James was the half-brother of
[55:26] Jesus and he was one of the early
[55:31] pillars remember Paul went to Jerusalem
[55:32] when he found James and Peter and they
[55:35] were pillars in the church and he was
[55:37] the first martyr after Stephen or says I
[55:41] guess I say the second martyr after
[55:43] Stephen record in the book of Acts there
[55:46] Hebrews and James sorry I'm going the
[55:47] wrong way and this was a mighty man of
[55:52] Valor was James great mighty man man who
[55:57] loved the Lord and this man didn't mince
[55:59] any words
[56:00] when he wrote this letter back I tell
[56:03] people that numerous times when I fight
[56:05] tell anyone that got saved I said go
[56:06] read James you just got saved go read
[56:08] James live like that because this is
[56:11] real faith faith doesn't just talk about
[56:13] it faith acts upon it
[56:15] faith is an action word praise God you
[56:18] see someone sick help them out see
[56:21] someone cold get them warm see somebody
[56:23] hungry feed them that's faith that's
[56:26] faith in action now James 1:22 actually
[56:35] let's go up and read verse 21 wherefore
[56:37] lay apart all filthiness Paul just told
[56:39] us that right that right glory lay apart
[56:43] all filthiness and superfluity of
[56:44] naughtiness and receive with meekness
[56:46] the engrafted word which is able to save
[56:49] your souls my sometimes I gotta shake
[56:51] myself be a man the word I'm preaching
[56:53] today save souls amen I'm the word if
[56:58] you but see there's got to be it's got
[56:59] to be grafted in a man
[57:01] it's got to be received a man with
[57:03] meekness and this word is able to save
[57:06] souls praise God this engrafted word so
[57:11] see it's gotta there's that same
[57:12] illustration of getting it attached to
[57:14] you it's got to be connected to you
[57:16] praise God
[57:17] which is able to save your souls be
[57:21] doers of the word
[57:22] I think church since we are in the
[57:25] message of the hour we're in the revival
[57:28] of the hour do you believe that I
[57:29] believe we are in the root of the
[57:31] current revival it used to be a zoo zoo
[57:33] Street in 1906 but now it's the bride
[57:37] Street I don't know if you're what to
[57:38] say it's the bride street race god this
[57:41] is the bride Street revival praising
[57:44] hard as far as I know brother bank every
[57:48] Church I look around I don't see revival
[57:50] because the revivals here because I see
[57:53] them compromising with the word
[57:54] especially with homosexuality and riches
[57:57] and prosperity my so my closest friends
[57:59] preach and prosperity you know like
[58:01] that's not always gonna be the case I
[58:03] know God's a God of multiplication and
[58:05] gods a God of duplicating and God's got
[58:09] a fruitfulness he is but not in every
[58:12] case
[58:14] and so the Bible said we must not
[58:18] deceive ourselves and this is what I
[58:20] just want to labor on a little bit you
[58:24] know like even last week with brother
[58:25] brother Brian's messages and why brother
[58:27] Simon a few weeks Lord willing if we
[58:29] don't take that word and apply it to our
[58:31] lives we're just deceiving ourselves it
[58:34] is so important search each each Monday
[58:38] each Tuesday to make sure we're
[58:41] reminding ourselves what we heard right
[58:45] I could show you on my tablet right here
[58:48] brother amen I'll show it to you buddy
[58:49] cuz you're right here tomorrow
[58:54] watch for the chains of events after
[58:56] crying out for prayer for 20-30 minutes
[58:59] if it be his will and I made this
[59:02] reminder when brother Troy is here doing
[59:03] what he said that yeah he said cry out
[59:05] and then he said there'll be a change of
[59:07] events so I just didn't let Troy's
[59:10] message go in this ear and out the other
[59:12] because he said cry out to God and he
[59:15] said then watch the chain of events
[59:16] afterwards so every Monday I follow up
[59:19] and see if any of those chains events
[59:21] are happening here's what they are
[59:23] prayed here at the altar
[59:24] for 30 minutes or 20 minutes afterwards
[59:26] I prayed for the Holy Ghost for my
[59:28] children revival in our church members
[59:30] all of our church members to find their
[59:32] gifts for abortion to end salvation of
[59:36] parents and my siblings and of being a
[59:38] full-time pastor I cry out to God for
[59:40] all those things and there's probably
[59:41] more - and I applied that scripture to
[59:46] my life because if it's not happening
[59:49] yet then I got to wait on God's time for
[59:51] it praise God
[59:53] and I put those reminders on there so
[59:55] I'll remember that I was praying I don't
[59:58] want to forget the word that I've heard
[59:59] now I can't remember every sermon
[1:00:01] everybody preaches right
[1:00:02] we can't remember everything but we also
[1:00:05] can't forget everything right I'm not
[1:00:10] asking you and I'm not asking remember
[1:00:12] every sermon I ever preached but I am
[1:00:14] asking to remember some of it praise God
[1:00:17] because if we read it and then forget it
[1:00:20] we're just tricking ourselves oh I'm a
[1:00:23] Christian yeah I'm okay I'm all right
[1:00:25] with God are we
[1:00:27] the Bible says only doers of the word
[1:00:30] are justified see we had there has to be
[1:00:34] some some specific messages that speak
[1:00:38] to our hearts and we remember for a long
[1:00:40] time or else were just tricking
[1:00:44] ourselves doers of the word not here's
[1:00:49] verse 23 for if any be a hearer of the
[1:00:52] word and not a doer he's like unto a man
[1:00:54] beholding his natural face in a glass
[1:00:57] for he beholdeth himself and for goeth
[1:01:00] his way and straightway forgetteth what
[1:01:02] manner of man he was and this is what I
[1:01:05] used at the Bible Club
[1:01:08] I kind of went like this I kind of use
[1:01:13] this as a mirror and I got real funny
[1:01:17] with the kids and I looked in the mirror
[1:01:19] said ah look how ugly I am you know
[1:01:21] that's kind of Western because it's a
[1:01:23] mirror right it's a mirror you see that
[1:01:25] it's a mirror so it's like looking into
[1:01:28] the it's foolish to look in the mirror
[1:01:30] and then forget what's in the mirror oh
[1:01:33] brother bang I don't have glasses
[1:01:35] anymore brother amen I've got blue eyes
[1:01:39] rejoice with me that'd be foolish
[1:01:42] I don't what does the mirror say the
[1:01:46] mirror says I got brown eyes and James
[1:01:50] says it's foolish to look into God's
[1:01:52] Word and see what a Christian should be
[1:01:54] and then forget it the rest of the time
[1:01:56] it's foolish like I was telling the kids
[1:02:01] you look in the Bible and the Bible says
[1:02:05] to love each other and not tease it's
[1:02:08] foolish to look in the Bible say I'm a
[1:02:11] Christian and then go out and tease
[1:02:13] people because kids do that all the time
[1:02:14] at school the Bible says love your
[1:02:17] enemies
[1:02:17] don't tease your enemies and the foolish
[1:02:21] to look and say oh I've got purple skin
[1:02:23] I studied the mirror yep purple skin
[1:02:30] pink skin foolish
[1:02:34] and the Bible says don't deceive
[1:02:36] yourself and listen that's why I believe
[1:02:38] this would be the difference between the
[1:02:39] wise and the foolish the wise will
[1:02:41] remember what the word says about them
[1:02:43] amen
[1:02:44] where the foodists will look in the word
[1:02:46] but then they'll forget what the Word of
[1:02:49] God says about a Christian that's the
[1:02:52] difference I believe because the Bible
[1:02:57] said verse 25 whoso looketh in the
[1:03:00] perfect law of Liberty and continueth
[1:03:03] therein he being not a forgetful hearer
[1:03:05] but a doer of the work this man shall be
[1:03:07] blessed in his deed amen praise God so
[1:03:12] every time we come to church it's like
[1:03:14] looking in the mirror of God's Word this
[1:03:17] is what a Christian is I'm not gonna
[1:03:19] forget this week I'm gonna remember to
[1:03:21] do this I had a deacon sister went a
[1:03:24] couple months ago from another church
[1:03:26] walk up to me sister namely she was he
[1:03:28] was crying and he was saying I just want
[1:03:30] to do something for the Lord and then he
[1:03:32] stepped down for me in a deacon you know
[1:03:33] cos of certain situations and I looked
[1:03:35] at him I said sir
[1:03:36] I said if you want to do something the
[1:03:38] Lord help out the poor it's that simple
[1:03:40] jesus said give to the poor and he said
[1:03:44] like that idea I said just go make a
[1:03:46] reminder I had a reminder on my phone to
[1:03:48] give us a pour once a month if I haven't
[1:03:50] done it already I can at least set up a
[1:03:52] man-made system to remind me so I can do
[1:03:55] what jesus said do he's like I don't
[1:03:59] know my gifts what are my gifts I said
[1:04:01] well I don't know God will tell your
[1:04:02] gifts I said one thing you can do is
[1:04:04] help the poor right you can pray in your
[1:04:07] closet that's one thing you can do see
[1:04:11] sometimes we just forget what's in the
[1:04:13] book praise God God just ask him for a
[1:04:16] simple humble Christian life amen
[1:04:18] and we just can't forget what's written
[1:04:21] in here I feel like if we do the little
[1:04:26] things and God will take care of the big
[1:04:27] things don't you I'd be like if I help
[1:04:30] the poor brother amen and I pray my
[1:04:31] closet and I fast
[1:04:34] and I do these little things I do these
[1:04:37] little things in secret God will take
[1:04:38] care of the big things that's what I
[1:04:41] believe and then brother Bailey
[1:04:45] Karen you were born too fast not so she
[1:04:49] could cast out Devils so that other
[1:04:51] people could cast out Devils see see how
[1:04:54] just like God's purpose is found in
[1:04:56] humility just remember and what the
[1:04:59] Bible says praise God integrate like we
[1:05:03] don't have to memorize another book like
[1:05:05] we just got new this book praise God we
[1:05:08] just got to remember what the preacher
[1:05:09] says what you we just gotta remember
[1:05:11] what the Bible says we deceive ourselves
[1:05:15] right this reminds this should remind us
[1:05:18] of Laodicea
[1:05:19] they're rich increased with Goods having
[1:05:21] enough and they don't and they'd have
[1:05:23] need of nothing they don't have need of
[1:05:25] anything else they deceive them own
[1:05:28] their own selves they think they're all
[1:05:30] right with God they think there's a
[1:05:31] mouthpiece that mouthpiece of God and
[1:05:33] Jesus said I've spewed them out of my
[1:05:35] mouth because they're lukewarm right
[1:05:38] they're not the mouthpiece of God
[1:05:40] anymore
[1:05:41] because they don't recognize their need
[1:05:43] to become more like Christ by looking
[1:05:45] into the mirror of God's Word that's one
[1:05:49] thing I like about this mirror praise
[1:05:53] God that mirror it always reflects and
[1:05:56] it never changed his brother Amen I'm
[1:05:59] just gonna get more white hairs on that
[1:06:00] mirror but when I look in this mirror I
[1:06:03] see Jesus and then I see changes I see
[1:06:06] me becoming more like to learn hey I
[1:06:08] live by their brother brother bang
[1:06:10] there'll be no changes on that mirror
[1:06:12] it's just gonna it's always gonna be the
[1:06:14] same thing but the beauty of it is when
[1:06:16] I come back to this mirror I can see
[1:06:18] myself getting more like Christ praise
[1:06:21] God that's the difference this is an
[1:06:23] eternal mere praise God this makes us
[1:06:25] younger again right in the Word of God
[1:06:27] it makes us more like Christ and the
[1:06:30] Bible said it changes us from glory to
[1:06:33] glory I'm gonna close with that one
[1:06:36] that's the beauty of this mere please
[1:06:39] God that's why we are not I bet I say
[1:06:44] that glory now a couple more
[1:06:49] scriptures here let me pull this up by
[1:06:51] God's grace I'm trying to think what I
[1:06:52] had okay yeah heard us let us do Church
[1:06:58] let us do what we can to imitate the
[1:07:00] help that the Holy Spirit right imitate
[1:07:03] the father how do we do that by looking
[1:07:05] into the word very simply he said just
[1:07:08] look at the word hear the word of God
[1:07:10] and remember what you've heard and and
[1:07:13] make a change in your life based upon
[1:07:16] what you've heard and now you're a doer
[1:07:18] of the word don't be a hero only that's
[1:07:21] one of the biggest problems with a
[1:07:23] message it's always been the problem
[1:07:24] with no any preacher down through the
[1:07:26] age now it just us Noah's day right if
[1:07:29] they just heard it and then act on it
[1:07:31] woe to them they grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:07:34] if we hear it we have to do it because
[1:07:39] it's God's will for our lives does
[1:07:40] everyone understand we got to do it if
[1:07:44] we hear it okay my last thoughts why do
[1:07:52] we do it because Christ why do we give
[1:07:54] ourselves to the mirror why we put
[1:07:56] ourselves on the altar because Christ
[1:07:58] gave himself for us Christ put himself
[1:08:01] on a cross for us praise God and you and
[1:08:05] I imitate God by looking into the mirror
[1:08:08] of the word and then we become the word
[1:08:11] we are changed from glory to glory now
[1:08:17] let's close with that we're gonna close
[1:08:18] with that text here tonight yes we
[1:08:23] deceive ourselves if we leave church and
[1:08:26] do not act upon the word that we heard
[1:08:30] second Corinthians let's go let's close
[1:08:32] to the center in thien's three you've
[1:08:33] been a good audience I know you're tired
[1:08:34] I get tired to God give us strength for
[1:08:38] these last few minutes praise God take a
[1:08:40] deep breath breathe the Holy Spirit in
[1:08:43] yes refresh my heart I know it's like I
[1:08:51] was falling asleep when brother Brian
[1:08:52] was preaching last week but I knew it
[1:08:53] was right the whole time I was falling
[1:08:54] asleep I was battling it when I got up
[1:08:56] here Maya the Holy Spirit came on me
[1:08:58] brother Matt a matter brother man I
[1:09:00] believe with everything I believe
[1:09:01] everything he said
[1:09:03] but then I saw the effects in my life
[1:09:06] that week God God literally strike I
[1:09:09] just felt a strength you know waking up
[1:09:12] Monday morning and then the battles I
[1:09:14] got victory in the mind battles it was a
[1:09:16] real blessed week so I know it's like to
[1:09:18] fall asleep something that I'll not hold
[1:09:19] anything against anybody I'm guilty to
[1:09:22] you I I get tired I appreciate your
[1:09:24] efforts but let's go to this synchronous
[1:09:28] 3:12 let's close to this and we'll be
[1:09:30] done now this is a picture this is Moses
[1:09:33] he come down from the Mount he spent all
[1:09:35] that time in God's glory amen his face
[1:09:37] was shining with it god help us to shine
[1:09:40] like that Amen 40 days and God's
[1:09:43] presence never had to eat or drink and
[1:09:45] the whole time God was telling him this
[1:09:48] is the law this is the word I'm not
[1:09:50] glory
[1:09:51] he's just hearing God's work he saw God
[1:09:53] ride it with his finger on the tables
[1:09:56] and he comes down here it's so bright
[1:09:58] he's got to put a veil over his face and
[1:10:01] this is the illustration Paul uses to
[1:10:04] talk about the New Covenant this is the
[1:10:06] Old Covenant and Paul uses the same
[1:10:09] thing to apply it to the New Covenant
[1:10:11] but you'll see there's changes there's
[1:10:14] new changes now in the New Testament now
[1:10:18] second granese 3:12 seeing then that we
[1:10:22] have such hope we use great plainness of
[1:10:24] speech like James James was very plain
[1:10:29] if you hear it and you don't live it
[1:10:32] you're deceiving yourself verse 13 and
[1:10:36] not as Moses who put a veil over his
[1:10:39] face that the children of Israel could
[1:10:41] not steadfastly look to the end of that
[1:10:43] which is abolished but their minds were
[1:10:47] blinded for until this day remains the
[1:10:50] same bale untaken away in the reading of
[1:10:53] the Old Testament which Bale has done
[1:10:54] away with in Christ amen
[1:10:59] now here Paul tells us now the veil is
[1:11:02] different now the veil for Israel now is
[1:11:04] on their hearts right because Moses is
[1:11:07] dead right but he said that veil left
[1:11:10] Moses and now it's upon their hearts
[1:11:12] they got a veil covering their hearts so
[1:11:15] that
[1:11:15] that they can't their hearts can't sense
[1:11:17] the glory of God because it's veiled the
[1:11:20] light can't get in their hearts right
[1:11:22] because the Bible says the light has
[1:11:24] shined in your hearts let me know that
[1:11:25] the Bible says the light of Christ is
[1:11:27] shined in your hearts
[1:11:29] so now the veils move it's not on Moses
[1:11:32] anymore it's on their hearts now verse
[1:11:36] 13 but even under this day when Moses is
[1:11:41] read the veils upon what their heart so
[1:11:46] they read it they read the Old Testament
[1:11:48] law they read Isaiah oh right they read
[1:11:50] Exodus to deuteronomy genesis and their
[1:11:52] hearts are veiled they just can't see
[1:11:54] jesus christ in it but that's beautiful
[1:11:55] that's all we see Jesus guys amen
[1:11:59] he said that he said I'll he cursed the
[1:12:01] serpent he said he said the woman si
[1:12:03] will bruise your head and your bruises
[1:12:05] heal I read that and I see Christ amen
[1:12:08] Christ bruising the head of the serpent
[1:12:11] amen Bob said he triumph over them
[1:12:13] publicly praise God amen but they can't
[1:12:17] see Christ in that but we do verse 16
[1:12:21] nevertheless when it shall turn the Lord
[1:12:23] the veil shall be taken away see when
[1:12:27] Israel really turns to the Lord that
[1:12:29] they'll be taken off their heart and
[1:12:31] they'll see Christ his light will shine
[1:12:33] in their heart verse 17 and 18s where I
[1:12:36] want to go as I close here just give me
[1:12:39] a few more minutes I got five more
[1:12:40] minutes on my watch that's 45 minutes
[1:12:42] sermon right there glory now the Lord is
[1:12:45] that spirit that's a good that's a good
[1:12:48] one this scripture right there the Lord
[1:12:51] is not a second person the Lord is that
[1:12:53] spirit yeah right and where the Spirit
[1:12:58] of the Lord is there is Liberty here's
[1:13:03] what Liberty is it's a license the
[1:13:05] Liberty to do as you please hey where
[1:13:11] the Holy Spirit is you can do as you
[1:13:14] please why because when you're born
[1:13:17] again you only want to do what pleases
[1:13:19] God
[1:13:20] that's the Liberty of a Christian I only
[1:13:22] want to do what God wants me to do amen
[1:13:25] that's what it means true Liberty is
[1:13:28] living as we ought to and as we ought to
[1:13:32] and not as we please
[1:13:34] so when you say I'm under the law of
[1:13:37] Liberty that means I'm only doing what
[1:13:39] God wants me to do praise God I'm not
[1:13:41] gonna be tempted to let the devil into
[1:13:43] my life not gonna I'm not gonna let him
[1:13:45] in I'm just gonna do what God wants me
[1:13:47] to do I'm under such Liberty my man says
[1:13:51] like when you get the Holy Ghost it's
[1:13:52] like you get a you get into a room and
[1:13:54] you he can use your tongues here he can
[1:13:57] use you for divine healing up here you
[1:14:00] know he can use that's on he can use it
[1:14:04] for divine healing he can use your for
[1:14:06] wisdom here you have access and you go
[1:14:10] you have Liberty for God to take you
[1:14:12] anywhere in his room praise God see but
[1:14:17] they don't have that they got a veil
[1:14:18] over their hearts and they don't have
[1:14:20] the Liberty that desire to do anything
[1:14:23] God pleases they don't have that but
[1:14:27] that's what the word Liberty means I
[1:14:29] just I'll do anything what God tells me
[1:14:31] to do and I'll only hear what God wants
[1:14:34] me to do hey hey how dare you that's the
[1:14:38] law of Liberty I'm only doing what God
[1:14:40] wants me to do it says to omit things
[1:14:48] that have no relationship to salvation
[1:14:52] amen anything that's not related to be
[1:14:54] in saved I'm leaving it out praise God
[1:14:57] that's my Liberty I don't have to do
[1:14:59] anything that doesn't deal with the
[1:15:00] message of the hour it doesn't deal with
[1:15:03] the Bible I don't know anything I don't
[1:15:05] have anything to do with that I'm free

[1:15:09] brace God amen glory take the Lord Jesus
[1:15:15] praise God yeah I always Drive you know
[1:15:18] mother BAM explains it he that he
[1:15:20] describes the law of Liberty is driving
[1:15:22] down the road and there's a cop sitting
[1:15:24] there and you didn't know it but you're
[1:15:26] driving exactly the speed limit but

[1:16:20] says right there I have a license to do
[1:16:22] the will of God no one can arrest me
[1:16:24] because I got license to do God's will
[1:16:26] praise God
[1:16:28] now the last scripture let's close here
[1:16:30] verse 18 except me that's the end of the
[1:16:34] chapter let me I'm just I got it on my
[1:16:37] iPad not on my Bible let me get my Bible
[1:16:39] in Gridley ins 3 yeah it must be the
[1:16:44] last one yep thank you sinker in the
[1:16:47] ends 3:18 so he's he was talking about
[1:16:51] how Jews have bail on their hearts but
[1:16:54] now he says in verse 18 but we all
[1:16:56] that's you and I all Christians we are
[1:17:00] with open face beholding as in a glass
[1:17:05] the glory of the Lord in that beautiful
[1:17:10] we get to look into the mirror of God's
[1:17:12] glory we look in this mirror and it's a
[1:17:16] glorious thing they're veiled to it they
[1:17:18] to them it's like this what's so great
[1:17:20] about that I don't know that's not very
[1:17:24] great it's veiled but we actually know
[1:17:27] the life of the word praise God the
[1:17:30] glory of the Lord is revealed to us amen
[1:17:34] we get to look at it and it's not veiled
[1:17:36] anymore by the Amen it's not very used
[1:17:39] to be veiled in denomination can you be
[1:17:41] saved can you leave what is the hope
[1:17:43] when you get the Holy Ghost is the tons
[1:17:45] of evidence yeah there's all those veils
[1:17:47] but now the Bible said we behold the
[1:17:50] glory of the Lord
[1:17:52] as in a glass and were changed into the
[1:17:56] same image from glory to glory even as
[1:17:59] by the Spirit of the Lord let's say into
[1:18:02] our feet but we all with open face open
[1:18:12] face means unveiled face that's that's
[1:18:18] how we used to be right but now the
[1:18:21] Bible says our face is unveiled it's
[1:18:24] like we had a veil upon her face but now
[1:18:26] the veil has been taken off we are with
[1:18:31] open face and unveiled face beholding as
[1:18:34] in a glass the glory of the Lord the
[1:18:37] spirit of Lord we are chained in the
[1:18:39] same image from glory to glory even as
[1:18:42] by the Spirit of the Lord
[1:18:44] now that word change means to transform
[1:18:47] to transfigure the same word for Mount
[1:18:50] Transfiguration amen
[1:18:56] let's close with that praise God I want
[1:19:05] to leave you with those thoughts there
[1:19:08] you and I should have the veil off our
[1:19:11] faces we should be able to look into
[1:19:14] God's Word look what we should see what
[1:19:17] it says and then let it change us to be
[1:19:20] more like Christ let's bow your heads
