TRANSCRIPT
========================================
let's see this is [Music] directors [Music] for the water [Music] [Applause] [Music] everybody [Music] [Applause] amen just love that song could you bring that third verse up again sister the Sorrows that befall us and Satan opposed but who's leading God leads his children alone it is through Grace that we can conquer and through that Grace we defeat all of our foes amen because it's God that leads us dear children It's a Wonderful poem love that song Thank you very much I think I'm done singing for the moment you've got to try to save my voice a little bit uh but just a wonderful song and just uh it's very uplifting because some through the water some through the flood some through the fire some through great Sorrows but all in all everybody has struggles everybody goes through through hard times but it's one who will bring us out amen hallelujah let's turn to uh Isaiah chapter 55 if you would please thank you I still wasn't sure which way to go this evening but uh just kind of picked one and let's go bear with me on that Isaiah 55 starting in the fifth or excuse me of the first verse so is hope everyone that thirsteth Come Ye to the waters and he that hath no money Come Ye by and eat yea come buy wine and milk without money and without price amen wherefore do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not hearken diligently unto me an ee that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure mercies of David amen behold I have given him for a witness to the people a leader and a commander to the people behold Thou shalt call a nation that thou knew us not and Nations that do not thee shall run run unto thee because of the Lord thy God and for the Holy One of Israel for he hath glorified thee seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near Amen Let The Wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon Hallelujah not just a little bit not just one or two but abundantly pardon everybody knows what abundantly means right it's a whole lot so he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and returneth not thither but watereth the Earth and maketh that bring forth and Bud that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where whereto I sent it see his word has a purpose and even he said that that it will not return unto me void but it shall accomplish what I please yes for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains and the hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree and instead of the Briar shall come up the Myrtle tree and it shall be to the Lord for a name for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off let's look to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we just thank you for another time that we have today gathered around with uh in fellowship with one another to to hear your word father there's there's nothing that I have but but what you've laid on my heart oh God I just pray that you would be in the service and leave me and guide me I just give myself over unto you to use me as you see fit father we just pray that we could be a blessing to the people this evening we ask in your precious name our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen just gotta have a it's not the greatest of titles but uh good to see you brother Bank just a thought is uh because of all the knots because of all the knots k-n-o-t-s now as as we read through there it shows that the Lord will take care of his people we all know that we know that the Lord is going to take care of his own he won't he won't forsake his people he won't see his people begging bread right but he's going to provide for his children man you know because he's a good father so a good father will will do just that he will provide for his children so and he also said let the wicked first let the wicked and the unrighteous forsake forsake their way and return unto the Lord uh for the Lord will show Mercy through an abundant pardon right so when when he has ordained us for work he didn't ask uh he didn't ask us to bring our skills he didn't bring us ask us to bring our knowledge but he just said to go right so for his ways are higher than our ways so when he speaks uh his worship return void but it shall accomplish what he set out uh what he what he set out for it to be right so for whatever he pleases and it will prosper um and then we can go out with joy and be led with peace trusting and knowing that that we are in his hands right where it says there uh for you uh for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth with peace the mountains in the Hills shall Break Forth before you into singing and all the trees of the fields or clap their hands I can't help but think of the mountains of of being our trials and being a hard situations in our ways you know for when Jesus said you speak unto this mountain and shall be moved uh it's probably not a literal Mountain that you're gonna raise up Mount Everest but there's a problem there's a great mountain of a situation in your way you could speak to this mountain and say it be be plucked up and be moved from here out of my way and over here right amen so when we when we when we're LED forth uh with with the peace we have the joy the mountains shall be shall break out in song and it's singing and the trees shall be clapping their hands right but but for one thing for sure they know rock going to take my place ain't no Rock don't cry at my place ain't no tree gonna take my place of clapping hands ain't no birds gonna take my place a second right because we're going to sing Joys unto the Lord amen for we know where he's brought us through like we were talking this morning that I will not forget his his testimonies but I will not forget the testimony that he has given me amen so I I I've had an experience with the Lord and I I dare not forget those kind of things so I will sing I Will shout I will praise I will testify of the goodness of what he's done because he set forth a path in my life he set for the path in your life right so we're all led to do something right and he is he's given each and every one of us a purpose not just to sit in and just sit in our chairs or sitting in the Pew and just just be a pure warmer that's or uh uh I better stay off of that subject that's that's up for another time I was going to go somewhere else but I'm going to try to stay focused but we're not Bench Warmers we're not pure warmers we're here to participate we're here to partake right and that's what communion is community yeah it's a special service maybe you do it once a month once a quarter once a year I don't know what y'all do for communion service but every service should be a communion service because we should be speaking communing with the lord it's a back and forth conversation right it's a relationship it's not a it's not a monologue just one person talking and have a conversation it should be a dialogue right two people having a conversation somebody speaking and then somebody returning saying yes I heard what you said and this is how I feel about it there's a conversation there's a relationship happening amen so um but uh Caleb and I were out we were doing some firewood and bear with me Caleb I'm not trying to embarrass him at all but he kind of inspired this this message as we were doing some firewood and uh it was up on this bank and we had to roll all the stuff I pulled the trailer up beside the ditch and we're rolling it down down the hill and then loading it on there's a trailer and it was it wasn't little stuff it was big stuff that we were rolling uh so for a young man uh it was kind of hard to to roll the piece that he was rolling and uh it took both of us but uh I said come on get that thing up on there he says I can't I said he said I can't because of all the nuts and he was right there were a lot of knots on it and you know if you ever try to roll a log that has a lot of knots on it it doesn't roll very well you know it's not symmetrical to where it would just turn but it's uh I guess you could say it's an abstract but it was oblong hard to turn you know what that would make a good sermon because of all the knots you know uh everybody knows what a knot is huh if you don't know what a knot is I'll give you some some explanations of what a knot is and this is knot um a fastening made by tying together lengths of materials such as rope and a prescribed way so everybody ties shoelaces I presume or you tie your gifts at a bow you're tying some kind of a knot right so it's a fascinating by tying something together a unifying Bond especially a marriage bond so you ever hear the term you know do a couple here just tied the knot right so it's an expression of marriage so there's there's a unifying Bond okay so that's another type of another type of nut uh a tight cluster of of persons or things I haven't really used this one too much you know you see a group of people out there there's a knot of people I've never used that term before so that that's something that was something new for me uh I guess you could call them clicks or we call them clicks now so uh a feeling of tightness you get a little bit stressed you know you ever feel the the knots in your shoulders or in your back or something like that so that's another type of a knot usually comes from stress right right and here's here's another one it's a a complex problem a complex problem and we see that there are uh there's an array of different uh of what knots can be you know some of us might have uh known some of those some of us might not have known what some of those are but regardless that's a lot of excuses right so it just gives you a whole thing of a lot of excuses that you can make you know there's a lot of a lot of fallbacks but yet there's a lot of Stepping Stones Okay so nuts uh is it okay if I just talk to you this evening yeah I'll try not to get too excited but not sir not sort of type of anxiety right we get we get all knotted up and uh like we were talking this morning we all have struggles we all have Strife we all have trials and tribulations we have these things in our lives we can't escape those things that's just life life just happens so we all have those kind of things we have the the difficulties and and all that so sometimes we have so many knots in our lives that that it becomes it turns into severe mind battles you know we get so scrupled up and then we get so bound up from our anxieties that can cause those those mind battles that bring us down and then we then we lose our joy we lose our happiness we lose our fellowship because of these nuts that happen in our lives but you know sometimes we have the setbacks we had the roadblocks you know we had the speed bumps in our lives just things that slow us down for some reason or another and this just causes many people to quit because the way it gets a little bit rough the way it gets a little bit hard and people just want to quit so what happens they want to go back to where it was easy you know just like the children of Israel uh that they started whining and complaining because things started getting a little bit hard you know oh it would have been better for us to be slaves to the Egyptians where would it be easier to be a slave to somebody instead of in Freedom I would much rather have freedom than be a slave to somebody else amen amen I would much rather be I would much rather have that fight to continue to fight for my freedom instead of being a slave to somebody oh yeah I shouldn't be under somebody else's thumb you shouldn't be under somebody else's thumb you shouldn't have the oppression of the devil upon you so where therefore you have the power to release amen so like we were saying this morning well we look for the excuses all these excuses for a way out right so well I'm not good enough I'm not good looking enough you know we can never be good enough Ephesians 2 8 tells us that you know it's uh for Grace by you uh for it's by grace that we are saved and not of ourselves right but it's a gift of God so well I'm not smart enough well if any man lacks wisdom let him ask of God right uh well like I said I'm not cool enough well be clothed with humility yes sir you want to be cool be clothed with humility amen yes well not religious enough sometimes that's good in some respects that's good because we we got to get out of that starchy religious attitude that's stretching religious atmosphere and just be free in the Holy Spirit right sometimes we get just so religious that it just causes us to be more bound than free yeah yeah we get so starchy as it well everything's going to be an order of this that you got to have everything you keep brother you can't play anything out of key you can't play anything upbeat everything's got to be mediocre one two three four nothing faster nothing slower we can't do anything like that see how see how boring and kind of starchy that would be and I don't think the Lord would like something like that you know amen like we were saying this morning let everything that has breath praise the Lord praise him on the tambourine praise him on the the the the symbols the loud symbols the high sounding symbols whatever it is the drums your feet your hands your mouth whatever it is let everything give let everything give praise to God Amen so I'm not religious enough James 1 27 he says we get the wrong idea of what religion is you know people will go around they'll ask well what religion are you I'm a Christian but other people will say well I'm a Catholic I'm a Baptist how about if you just say that you're a Christian right yes yes I just had a talk with her with a brother yesterday and uh just some things that we had talked about some uh you know some different things that that uh that we believe they don't really believe and he's you know he doesn't want to force it on anybody well I'm not going to criticize what you do I said well I'm not going to criticize what you do I mean we have our set of beliefs and that's the way that we're going to that as far as my house you know that's the way that we're going to serve the Lord right so uh your house is going to be something different maybe you you might you might have different uh different strict beliefs or or whatever it might be but before we got off the phone I said um I'll tell you one thing I'll just he didn't know how to label it you know I said well I don't really like labels let's just say that we're a Christian amen so the character should follow the confession yes right so if you profess to be a Christian you ought to live a Christian Life so what is religion James says in James 1 27 it says pure religion and undefiled before God and the father is this to visit the fatherless and widows in their Affliction amen and to keep himself unspotted from the world yes that's what pure religion and undefiled before God is amen how many feel religious if you feel religious maybe you maybe you visited somebody in this situation I don't know but it's helping you know uh through the Scripture it tells us to take care of widows right yes yes it takes it says to take care of the the fatherless right so take care of one another you want to be religious it's it's serving somebody else well I'm not dedicated enough well II Peter 3 and 14 says wherefore if beloved seeing that you look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless being diligent so if you say that you're not dedicated enough or diligent enough the scripture is telling you be diligent and we and we love his testimonies right this is a precept so this is something that we ought to love well my clothes aren't good enough well we don't look on the outward appearance right but we look on the things on the inner man Hallelujah here's a common one you ever hear the young people say I just don't fit in anywhere that's a pretty common one right do you young people feel like you fit in or do you feel like you're you're out placed at a place wherever you go you don't have to answer that question but you know just answer it in your heart and your mind so a lot a lot of people especially the youth they feel out of place but I just don't fit in anywhere why because people are different well that's the way the world is made up is everybody is different even even twins have differences right right so even if they look alike and they they even act like there's still some kind of a differences everybody is different in one shape form or another that's right I was going to say something but I better leave that one alone I don't want to get in trouble but people there is just so many so many differences out there that were not alike yeah you might have some common ground in some things but everything is not identical yeah so somewhere something isn't going to fit yo and that's that's what makes the the the the variety so wonderful that's what makes America so great because it's more than just it's just more it's more than just one culture it's a whole bunch of people that can live in unity amen which they said was impossible years ago yeah it might look like that now but most people I think are living in peace I think we all get along right because we have common ground of Jesus Christ amen and we all have common decency right we all have uh care for one another even if it was somebody strange where South America wherever it might be we would take them in with open arms right amen why because it's the love of the father that's within us right well if you just don't fit anywhere first Peter 2 9 says but you are our chosen generation a royal priesthood and a holy nation A peculiar people we're purchased right yes so that you should show forth the Praises of him who hath called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light well here's another one you know Psalm sings to this Psalm says to to make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord but some people just don't like to to sing because they said I just can't sing very well well not everybody has to sound like Aretha Franklin or David Phelps or anything like that yo just like the scripture says Sing A Joyful Noise unto the Lord right so you know and who would you rather pattern yourself after I would rather follow after David's advice because David was a man after God's Own Heart right so I want to follow after that pattern I don't want to follow after Samuel's Sons I don't want to follow after Eli's Sons I'd like to follow after David yeah because David is specific it's specific calling him out that he is a man after God's Own Heart so if he's a man after God's Own Heart and he was pleasing unto the father that's what that's a pattern I'd like to follow amen so through some of these things I'm sure you know probably something hit somewhere but uh do you measure up we all fall short right that's where what we were talking about this this morning is that we all fall short of the glory of God right but it's not I think it's second Corinthians 4 7 let it uh I can't remember exactly how I said but something about the Excellency of the power to be of God can you bring that up second Corinthians 4 7 I think is what it is but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us see we say it so many times that it just becomes commonplace that oh well I know it's not us but why do we try so hard still why do we get so upset because I'm not good enough I I told brother Jesse this morning because he he uh this afternoon I I heard him say something about the Lord's Prayer and brother Jim was just preaching on that and I just had a thought the other the other day of how overly overly used that scripture is or that prayer is but it's so under believed we say it well I know it's not me I know it's the Lord in me but why are we cutting the Lord short yeah I just preached a message back home hearing my send me yo if the Lord the Lord called Isaiah Isaiah kind of made an excuse and you know I'm a man of unclean lips but the but the angel came with the with that coal of fire and touched his lips to cleanse his lips right right right amen fire is a cleansing power the Holy Ghost of fire is a cleansing power right so do we not have that Holy Ghost within us or not right you know so and then we call ourselves names right we try not to call other people's names because we want to be respectful right well we want to treat them because they're made in the image of God so we don't want to call them we don't want to call them names but what about you yeah I kind of I'm kind of diverting off this message I'm getting into another one so bear with me but but how do we view ourselves do we look so far down on ourselves that we're calling ourselves Dane don't ye not that you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost so how do we speak against the Temple of the Holy Ghost by calling ourselves names why do you always call yourself a genius well I don't want to call myself a bad name so I use something a little bit better even though it is sarcasm you know there's no way to go genius yo just did something uh not real bright the the light bulb just illuminated a little bit it was a dumb idea you know so but we do those things then we call ours we're so hard on ourselves but you know if you don't try something if you don't put forth and effort it's an automatic failure right right that's right amen so if you feel led try it Hallelujah if you have that leading go if you if you hear that voice do something about it hey man even if you think you can't do it you know perseverance is is is is is is exactly that is uh continuing on with something even though it scares you to death I don't like talking in front of people believe it or not I don't like talking in front of people it just makes me nervous but still it's a perseverance you don't know how to do this job it's a it's a solo thing maybe you're a machinist and you've got to work on the machine the first time and you're going to make this part oh man I don't want to mess this up yeah of course you're going to be nervous right but who says you can't do it as soon as you say that I can't do it you failed right there that's right you're pretty much admitting defeat right now because we look too much at ourselves we that we can't do this and we can't do that yo Moses tried to get out of his calling one time you know when the Lord was calling her and says well I'm a man of stammering lips you know I I don't it might not be him who exactly said that one but I'm I can't speak very well I'm not an eloquent speaker so you can't use me he said well that's enough of that excuse I guess we'll use Aaron but one way or another my word is going to go forth right it's not going to come back unto me Boyd because it's going to accomplish the purpose that I set forth amen because this is my pleasure and this is what I want so I'm going to receive what I want right excuse me but look look how look how well that the Lord used Moses right how powerful Moses was that he was he was a pretty much a one-man Army right but we know that it wasn't exactly Moses right but it was by the leading of the Lord because the lord gave him commission to go out and do these things he walked out in the instruction or at the instruction of the Lord and he went with that Rod right it wasn't just a stick in his hand you know if those Egyptians would have taken that stick out of his hand right he'd have been whooped but it wasn't just a stick it was God's judgment Rob see we put too much emphasis on us and not enough emphasis on him right yeah so it was absolutely God see in our weakness he is made strong right amen why because we can't do it right yo look at look at Samson you know Samson was he you know supposed to be this this scrawny guy of course everybody thinks that he was just uh Arnold Schwarzenegger type of guy and uh just muscle bound but but look what he did he had a commission from God look you go do this and I'm going to be with you through every step of the way as long as you keep this that right the Nazarite vowel as long as you keep this you stay in my good graces but he made a mess of things because he didn't live true to God right his desire his heart we know he didn't give his heart over to the Lord he only gave his strength over to over to the Lord right yes sir but brother sister we need to change our vocabulary we need to change our vocabulary from I can't do this unto I can I can do this amen I can I will I do believe right you know that song I can I will I do believe yes amen see we spend so much time telling ourselves that we can't and we put ourselves down and we put ourselves in the failure we don't build a wall up of of uh of success we're building the walls of failure through the words that we speak did not Jesus say that if you speak unto this mountain it should be plucked up right so if you speak unto your situation negativity it's not going to go anywhere it's defeat amen yeah if you want to say can't then you say the devil can't the devil can't do this and the devil can't do this amen that's that's we need to start changing our our vocabulary of the of the the way that we're saying things the way that we're calling out situations amen because we've read the back of the book right so we know where his fate Lies We already know that he's a defeated folk Jesus already took captivity captive he took our he took our captor our our prisoner prisoner right amen he took our captor prisoner amen yes but also the scripture says what is it Philippians 4 13 I could do all things through Christ who strengthens me right so I can't we just have to have that positive attitude about it right yeah but like I said uh he didn't say to bring your skills but he did say to trust him amen now see when when I said if you feel led go sometimes we get into the situation where it feels like we have to force the situation why I felt led to go here I felt led to do this but it just feels like I hit a roadblock well be careful because Balaam had the same type of situation right he had the donkey and he was getting mad at his donkey because his donkey wouldn't go but he didn't know that it was the angel of the Lord and his way because Balaam had the wrong motive he was going about it the wrong way that's right amen amen so sometimes when you push your way through when you're trying to push and you're trying to push you're trying to push be careful because it might be the angel of the Lord in the way of your donkey so it's time to take a step back take inventory see what's going on amen amen sometimes knots are needed right so there's a season to everything there's a there's a season to tie knots and there's a season two untie knots right so when you tie a knot what's the purpose of a knot to fasten something right to hold something down so it's to hold something in place so there's a time to tie the knot if you have if you have cargo we use binding straps so we'll we'll use the binding straps so hold the to hold the load down but if you need it in the package what do you do you untie the knot right so there's a season to everything there's a time for the knots there's a time for the stresses in our lives there's a time to de-stress amen so you ever try to climb a smooth rope anybody nobody's ever tried to climb a smooth rope did you ever do that back in high school brother no it's hard to climb a smooth rope try it one time not real high don't go real high tie it on a limb and see how it is trying to climb up a smooth rope with no knots in it you'll find that if you put knots in the Rope those are Stepping Stones to climb higher all right amen so sometimes the knots are needed we have to go through situations in our lives hey man sometimes those situations are needed so we know that we could overcome the next situation well I overcame that situation now see David slew the Giant Goliath right everybody knows that story yeah yeah but do you read do you realize a little bit later where David's Brothers also salute Giants right right right how is it because they knew that David was able to slay the one giant so if he's able to slay that giant we are more than able to be conquerors amen right right because we saw somebody else do it we saw that it was possible we look at our situation and said this is so impossible to get out of but you look somebody who's had successes and you follow after that pattern yes David showed that it could be done and his brothers just followed suit and figuring hey there's no adversary that could stay in our way especially when it comes against our God Amen thinking not strange these fiery trials that are in our lives right yeah tie the knot then it's loosed it's no longer bound but it's free amen amen Jesus said verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound into heaven and whatsoever you shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven right see we underrate our privileges we underrate ourselves we don't recognize the authority that we have in this scripture and that's what puts us down well I can't I can't attain that perfection well I know Christ has he he was perfect but he also made us perfect through his sacrifice right you know he asked a strange question to the disciples are you worthy to drink of the same cup that I drank of you know many of us would say oh no I'm not worthy to drink of that same cup because he's so much higher than we are right yeah and that would be humility but that's going under our privileges you know when I was reading that the one time I was saying wow they answered quite boldly brother they answered quite boldly and so should you and so should you amen live your life that is that's of boldness in your life not putting yourself down but putting it in not not living in Pride understand that I'm I'm trying to distinguish between pride and Authority right we have this Authority in the scripture to say unto these mountains to say unto these situations that we can do something about these situations amen amen what can we do you are you can't go defeat City Hall no but I know one that can right that's right how are we going to defeat Jericho they got this huge wall up there right yo could you imagine what the people were thinking Joshua you are nuts if you think we're gonna go knock that wall down you know it was something that seemed unsurmountable it seemed like something so impossible right but they just believed him because he was the one who was called To The Lord right he was the one after Moses came Joshua he was the one who was anointed to be in that spot right he was the one who was chosen to be in that spot right amen so all those people put their trust in him oh wait did I say something wrong they put their trust in a man oh that almost seems wrong doesn't it they put their trust in a man did not Paul say follow me as I follow Christ and we can follow people through a holy convocation or uh maybe I said that wrong excuse me but as they are LED of the Holy Spirit we could follow men that are LED of the letter of the Holy Spirit right amen but see it says to try the spirits to see what they are Hallelujah so it's okay to to Rally behind a man knowing that it's not the man accomplishing these things it wasn't Joshua that accomplished the task of tearing the wall down it was the instruction that was given to Joshua and it was The Obedience so by your obedience to the word you could overcome these things it was those statutes that Joshua was following right it was the precept that Joshua followed it was the word that entered into his ears he said I heard that word that's a revelation I'm going to follow after that amen right amen did the walls come tumbling down or did they not yes sir amen yo we have uh I don't know what time it is baby I'll just kinda go through some of these skip a little bit it's a unique service everybody gets a little tired the evening service but as we talked about with knots nuts are not just something that you tie it's not just stresses in life but we also talked about how it could be a type of strong Unity praise God right yep there I go with that Unity again that's so important that we have Unity with one another amen amen so we can't do anything by ourselves we we read into this and uh in Proverbs how a a a how's it called a three-fold cord is not easily broken that's right so if you have one strand probably be easily broken two strands easily broken you find a you find a nice nice thick rope tightly wound rope it's not easily broken is it so the more unified we are the less we are out to be broken in Fellowship right The More We Stand upon the word of God you know there was a time that that Moses needed his brothers right but I I can't remember the mountain that they were on but you remember the battle and uh Moses went up onto the mountain and Aaron and her went up with him and he's up there and as long as Moses raised his hands they were victorious right but as soon as his hands went down what happened right they were in defeat right so when we praise the Lord we're Victorious when we stop praising the Lord we're in defeat right if you can't praise the Lord get somebody right we need encouragement by our brothers Aaron and her were on one side or the other holding up his arms right helping them to be victorious see we need that Unity with one another to overcome our struggles to overcome our strikes sometimes it just seems too much for us to bear bear ye one another's burdens amen but see like the way we were talking about this morning some folks have a hard time uh obeying the Commandments right everybody falls short some time or another uh by uh by breaking one of the Ten Commandments right but some folks have a hard time with the Commandments well I can't I can't go with the you have too many rules I can't go Thou shalt not do this Thou shalt not do that thou shalt this Thou shalt this they have a hard time with the authority is what they have a hard time with all right because they want to go do their own pleasure and that's where the the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life yeah that's what breaks the Commandments is the lust of this body because our body desires something else right yes sir and sometimes we give in to that so yeah some people have a hard time with Commandments because they can't they can't take all the knots Thou shalt not do this Thou shalt not do that right but you know you still live under rules some way or another that's right yes yo if you uh I can't remember if I talked about this here or not I know I preached on this at the home church but you have that chop Zone where everything was uh uh uh the the summer of love and everything was free it was uh energy pretty much people want Anarchy Anarchy is without a ruler right Anarchy is pretty much self-rule no rules there are no rulers over us but you know what come to find out they still had somebody in charge over there yeah that's right brother oh we're not going to have any rulers over us we're all of us we're self uh uh individuals we're all Gonna Roll here but there's still somebody in charge there right no matter how you try to slice it somebody's going to try to take charge sir amen but still those people were living by the do's and don'ts hey guys don't let anybody in don't let anybody out you see where that comes from people don't want rule but yet they live on the rule that's right they just don't want to live under the right kind of a rule right amen because they want to fulfill their own less amen in John 14 and 15 it says if you love me keep my Commandments right now see the further you the further the further you get away from the messenger which the holy spirit is always a messenger yes brother Brandon was a messenger But ultimately even he himself said that the holy spirit is always the messenger the holy spirit is always the messenger but the further you get away from the messenger the easier it is to walk away and quit the easier it is to walk away and come against it amen see like we were talking uh earlier the Witnesses are getting fewer and fewer and the challenges are becoming harder right and the challenges are becoming more frequent look how bold the people are in this day that they're coming against what brother Brandon said where were they 20 40 years ago how come they weren't contesting it then that's right but now Witnesses are kind of leaving the scene now it's easier for these people to come against it just like the children of Israel just like the experience in the wilderness everybody has to have their own experience you have to have your own experience you you everybody has to have their own experience you can't go off of what mommy and daddy did right see it's because people aren't having their own experience it's just because they believe that when they grew up in the end of the message that's right well this is what I grew up believing well did you ever go on the back side of the desert sir like brother Brandon said that you have to right people want to come against preachers oh are you qualified did you have a holy ghost experience well how can you call yourself a Christian did you have a holy ghost experience right it goes the same way right yes sir yes sir not many people want to look at that one they just want to criticize they want to they've got to find something to criticize all right brother right so you know just like Janice and Jammers came against the word of dude just came against Moses right but you can't take a neutral ground you can't say well I'm just going to sit on the fence and Watch What Happens because sooner or later you're gonna have to make your own decision you have to get on one side of the fence or the other with Cora and David Janice jammers and they came against Moses and they're saying Moses you take too much upon yourself you know his father-in-law said the like the exact same thing Moses you take too much on yourself what was the difference between the two Jethro wanted to help Moses not take over for Moses Moses told Janice to Jammers court and dancing you know you've been giving you've been giving uh your Levites or whatever and you want to take the priesthood you want to take control of everything now when you wanted to go back to Egypt now you want to take control now that things are going pretty good now you want to step up where were you when I needed you to to encourage the rest of the people where are you that but the way it's been plowed already right now we want to step in and Grant the easy reins if we want to take the easy Road goodbye good but you know the Lord told Moses he said you gather every you gather you gather the men of Israel you gather everybody together and we're gonna we're gonna come here we're gonna see whose letter the Lord or not amen amen and we know what happened that the that the ground open up and then swallowed the people that were came against Moses the one that was ordained and set above the people there was there was something else I was gonna I was thinking of preaching this morning that man I can't remember the scriptures but it it says Thou shalt not come into something about not coming against the rulers coming Against The Gods and those that have ruled over you this I think it's back in Psalms like I can't remember exactly where it is but man I wish I remember what it was now because it was it would fit right here so you know even the scripture says don't come against those that I have set you know touch not mine anointed and do them no harm do my prophets no harm right yes sir so like we were talking this morning about the fivefold ministry those gifts are ordained of God to be in place right who who is man to try to take something like that out right right except somebody trying to take the place of God amen I'm gonna go ahead and start closing uh we were talking about knots right all right kind of uh hit a couple rabbit Trails but that's okay right oh there's the the let not right Psalm 119 133 says order my steps in thy word and let not any iniquity have dominion over me I love that scripture because that's my desire amen I want to be led by the word and I don't want any iniquity having charge I don't want to be enslaved to any iniquity in my life amen amen so when we confess our faults one to another we confess our faults before God there is therefore no more condemnation upon us but we are free individuals amen amen and then you have the fail not First Kings 8 and 56 it says blessed be the Lord that hath given rest unto His People Israel according to all that he promised there hath not failed one word of all his good promise which he promised by the hand of Moses his servant amen then you have the fear not Isaiah 41 10 it says fear thou not for I am with thee be not dismayed for I am thy God I will strengthen thee yay I will help Thee I will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness then you have the faint nut Galatians 6 and 9. and let us not be weary and well doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not amen see we get a little bit of wheat but be persevering continue on there are times that it gets so hard that we want to quit but I say keep going keep going amen yo you'll reap what you sow if you if you're sowing good things you're gonna reap the good things amen if you faint not yeah stay strong my brothers and sisters amen then you have to walketh not Psalms 1 1-6 it says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sinneth in the seed of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law does he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whether whatsoever he doeth shall prosper see a tree planted by the water is going to produce much fruit so if you're in the water and the water of the word by being cleansed by the water of the word right we're uh we're getting into that thirst we're we're satisfying our thirst with the word of God not the things of the world we should produce much fruit verse 4 says the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish then you have the forget not Psalm 103 that's right says bless the Lord O my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name amen bless the Lord O my soul and forget not all his benefits amen hallelujah who who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles amen hallelujah then the Forsaken nun Psalms 9 9-10 it says the Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed a refuge in times of trouble and they that Know Thy Name will put their trust in thee for thou Lord has not forsaken them that seek thee amen amen amen praise the Lord just have the musicians come you know there was a man that stood up boldly one time they claimed that he was a prophet and talking about the robe that he had the robe on and then the the people realized and said you know what let's take them to Martin do you remember that story sir let's take him to Mark Martin we'll see if he's a real Prophet or not so what happened he back down right when he was faced with the reality when he was going to be exposed so there are men and women in this day that are going to sound so authoritative right to try to take you away to try to steer you away from the truth all that is is a scarecrow yes stay rooted like the tree planted by the water stay rooted and grounded and bring forth much fruit amen amen so a lot of those are just clouds threatening rain that's all they are is clouds that's right praise God they bring no storm they bring no Authority they're just rain clouds threatening rain they have no authority over you this is the authority over you the word of God and your pastor those are the ones that have set at authority over you spiritually speaking right so when some comes and they they sound like they have so much Authority behind them yeah it could sound good it could sound like a good argument no but that's what happened with the serpent Neve it sounded like a good a good argument it sounded so much like truth but just the one word that's right amen we all have we all have knots in our lives but don't let those knots be your excuses let them be your Stepping Stones don't don't use them because of all the knots I can't I can't live this I'm not good enough I'm not I'm not this I'm not that I'm not talented enough he's not looking for your talent he's looking for Your Surrender right amen amen amen if you would stand to your feet it doesn't matter how old you are either awesome yeah I just I love that story about Caleb 80 years old he said give me my Mountain that's right he was one who did not forget the promise of God he's the one who did not forget the benefits of God he remembered what was he remembered the promise that was given unto him if you do this if you're diligent you're obedient you take over the lamb you're going to get your portion right that's right you follow after me you're going to receive your portion now see we as the bride we type that double portion all right we're going to get that double portion we don't want just a portion but we want a lot of it right yeah we want more of him right yeah we want more of him yes sir praise God praise God I just like to read a couple quotes if that's okay before we close amen I don't want to read this Philippians 4 10. he's saying but I've rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at the last year care of me have flourished again wherein you were all so careful but you lacked opportunity not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned and whatsoever State I am therewith to be content I know both to be amazed and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I could do all things through Christ which strengthen me so he's saying I've been in the low times I've been in the High Times I know what it's like to be low I know what it's like to be high but whatever situation I'm in there with be content amen and what are we going to be content with be content that we can say that we are Christians amen and how will they know that we are Christians by our love right now sometimes the words can uh cut real deep and hard but remember we're circumcised that's cutting the knots off see we're we're circumcised by the word of God and it cuts but it's good for you it shapes you out cut a tree back and it'll bear better it'll produce better fruit is what he's saying yes don't let too many Loose Ends get uh get run out on it that's what the what's the matter today we get too many Loose Ends running out this way and that way too many societies and too many of this and too much of that let's come back to one thing Calvary where we can sing with our heart and humbler you make yourself and then at another place he says and so here we are tonight and the place is converted from trying to bind one another by wrestling knots trying to bind one another we shouldn't be trying to bind one another we should be trying to liberate one another by wrestling knots and trying to to tie the devil in such a knot by the scripture he can't get out of him until he takes the count that's right and now we pray the Lord will help us to do this we shouldn't be trying to tie one another in a knot we should be trying to tie the devil into not right but when he says if if you'll just come up on this mountain and worship me but it is written right Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God alone for the Lord God is one God bring the scripture to him amen when you bring the truth to him you tie him in knots see when we submit ourselves unto God then we could resist the devil and he will flee when we submit ourselves unto the word of God then we could use the word of God and it's a truth in our life that we can make the devil escape from us amen Hallelujah then we can bind them but it's through that submission of the word the except accepting the word now he says this and I'll be done the questions that's been on our minds how can he do it what would uh what would this uh I'm not exactly sure what he's saying but how could he do it somehow mysteriously they'll all fade away the knots that's been tied in the back of our minds see he's talking about the Mind battles there uh and uh the knots has been tied in the back of our minds will it be this how could it be how's it is it going to be this is he going to come this way is he going to do this is it going to be that somehow or another Majestic fingers will just untangle unravel those knots The Majestic fingers The Majestic fingers will just untangle and Ravel those knots and it'll all fade into one big crown of love then we shall see him then we should be like him then we shall worship him then washers we shall see mother as God wants her and he was talking about that on Mother's Day amen let's sing that song uh they'll know that we are Christians by our love uh you know that song [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] understand [Music] birthday [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] spirits [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] Stepping Stones as a springboard to to come back amen so sometimes it puts us down but we're going to spring back amen just like this in in scripture where it says that a righteous man will follow seven times but he'll get right back up you might get discouraged one or two times but we're gonna get right back up amen we're gonna be renewed just as the Eagles let's find our heads Heavenly Father we just thank you so much in our hearts and I thank you man I would say truly we could say that it's been good to be in the house of the
