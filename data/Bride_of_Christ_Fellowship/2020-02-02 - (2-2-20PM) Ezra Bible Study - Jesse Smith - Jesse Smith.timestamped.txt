[25:26] 19th year in my life Lord you got a hold

[25:31] Lord I've never been the same I've never

[25:50] we're so happy to do it so Lord take
[25:53] this word here tonight we'll break into
[25:54] your people Nonna's refresh your hearts
[25:56] as we worship we serve you and learn
[25:59] from your great word in Jesus Christ
[26:02] he's investing our mind was real estate
[26:05] I know I said I'll sit down but you know
[26:08] since we have a lot of people here
[26:09] tonight
[26:09] I think I'll just stay here at the
[26:10] pulpit I'll try to keep it short by
[26:12] God's grace pot I'll need the children's
[26:13] help reading the scripture so anyone
[26:15] who's got your Bible and you like to
[26:17] read I may call upon you so let me know
[26:22] if you don't want to read too I don't
[26:24] want to force anybody to read them I
[26:26] like to you know last week we had just a
[26:29] nice little confirmation on one of
[26:31] brother Troy's messages so he was
[26:33] preaching a little bit about Ezra and
[26:35] zerubabbel
[26:36] and then after service you know sister
[26:38] Karen and we're talking and she's like
[26:40] brother Jesse I just read Ezra and
[26:43] Nehemiah this week and she said I wonder
[26:45] how it types to us and I said well
[26:48] praise the Lord I preached on that you
[26:50] know back in 2013 and so I explained a
[26:53] little bit but I thought you know we
[26:54] just go over that again you know so I
[26:56] think I'd like to just go over this
[26:57] briefly tonight and just do a little
[26:58] Bible study on it and so if you got your
[27:01] Bible go to Ezra here
[27:04] and well look at that it's a beautiful
[27:06] story it's one of the one of the most I
[27:10] should say helpful series I ever
[27:13] preached because it helped me place
[27:15] together like the chronological order of
[27:16] the Old Testament and as you'll see a
[27:19] lot of this deals with the hunt this is
[27:21] all foreshadowing the 144,000 so you see
[27:25] a lot of that now brother Adam doesn't
[27:26] mention a few things about as you'll see
[27:28] about grace grace the headstone grace
[27:30] grace so we kind of see that and our day
[27:32] a little bit but when I preach it I saw
[27:34] a lot of it was it was like a
[27:37] foreshadowing of the great Millennial
[27:40] temple so I think we'll see it here
[27:42] tonight as as a more willing as we open
[27:44] our hearts to the Lord I'm sure he'll
[27:46] help us here but let's go to Ezra a
[27:48] chapter one and one thing you know Cara
[27:54] and I were talking about was just the
[27:57] emphasis of Ezra I'm sorry and zoomable
[28:00] Ezra Nehemiah the emphasis on
[28:02] re-establishing the house of God and she
[28:05] was saying how brother Jesse that's
[28:06] really opened my eyes to how important
[28:09] it is for to be ready for every church
[28:10] service and I thought well that's it I
[28:12] said Laurie I really meant a lot to me
[28:15] because that's what I got out of it when
[28:18] I preached it you know their emphasis on
[28:20] building a physical house is not so
[28:22] important for us it's building the
[28:23] spiritual house which is the Holy Ghost
[28:26] getting in others getting people saved
[28:28] feel what the Holy Ghost getting their
[28:29] gifts and in their places and their
[28:31] positions getting the spiritual house
[28:33] build up so that we can minister and
[28:35] help one another by God's grace so Ezra
[28:39] chapter 1 let's read verse 1 now in the
[28:48] first year of Cyrus king of Persia that
[28:50] the word of the Lord by the mouth of
[28:51] Jeremiah might be fulfilled the Lord
[28:54] stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of
[28:56] Persia that he made a proclamation
[28:58] throughout Oz Kingdom and put it also in
[29:00] writing saying thus saith Cyrus king of
[29:03] Persia the Lord God of heaven hath given
[29:05] me all the kingdoms of the earth
[29:07] yea charge me to build him in house of
[29:09] Jerusalem which is in Judah who is there
[29:12] among you of all his people his God be
[29:15] with him and let him go up to Jerusalem
[29:17] we
[29:17] is in Judah and bill bill the house of
[29:20] the Lord God of Israel he is the God
[29:22] which is in Jerusalem and whosoever
[29:24] remaineth in any place where he
[29:26] sojourned has let the men of his place
[29:29] help him with silver with gold and with
[29:31] goods and with the beasts beside the
[29:32] free were offering for the house of God
[29:34] that is in Jerusalem that's all read
[29:36] verse five together ready one two three
[29:39] then rose up the chief of the fathers of
[29:42] Judah and Benjamin and the priests and
[29:45] the Levites with all them whose spirit
[29:49] God had raised to go up to build the
[29:51] house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem
[29:54] Amen thank God as best in dream his word
[29:56] may be seated so this is just a
[30:02] beautiful beautiful story I think I'll
[30:05] just start by you know saying again what
[30:09] a great confirmation we had with sister
[30:11] Karen a brother Troy preaching that
[30:13] that's really a wonderful confirmation
[30:16] so she was reading it all week saying
[30:18] what does this mean was this mean and
[30:20] then the brother preached honest that
[30:22] was a great vindication now just a
[30:25] little bit of background this story
[30:27] Ezra Nehemiah Esther well kinda asked
[30:31] her to not not really gonna look at that
[30:33] one's an eye but Ezra Nehemiah and
[30:34] zoobel all their three men the three
[30:38] main main men in the restoration of
[30:40] Israel back to the promised land
[30:42] remember they got kicked out in Jeremiah
[30:45] Jeremiah told them because of their
[30:48] idolatry and their wickedness and so God
[30:52] kicked him out and he said seventy years
[30:54] remember Hannah and I come around said
[30:56] it's gonna be too right Jeremiah said
[30:58] that's funny he said amen he said the
[31:00] way we'll know is which one will come to
[31:01] pass right and then we know what
[31:05] happened Hannah and I had died that same
[31:07] year he died that same year but Jeremiah
[31:10] lived on and it was seventy years so
[31:13] right about the time seventy years come
[31:14] up was when Daniel was pranks he can God
[31:16] but also then God at that time Daniel
[31:19] was a different location God moved on
[31:21] the heart of a Persian heathen King
[31:23] right Cyrus and Cyrus says God has
[31:28] spoken to me in other words holy spirits
[31:30] anointed me
[31:31] to do my part to help God's Word be
[31:33] fulfilled right and that's that's like
[31:36] how we could say like Trump or Obama or
[31:38] Bush whoever it is God can use them even
[31:40] if they're and don't have the right
[31:41] faith God can use anybody he wants right
[31:44] Nebuchadnezzar was a tool a servant in
[31:47] the hand of God but yet he was prideful
[31:49] you know he worshiped himself you know
[31:51] he thought he was all highly exalted so
[31:53] God had to make him like lowly like a
[31:55] beast like an animal for seven years to
[31:57] get him to see it's not about you it's
[31:58] about God's Word right
[32:00] it's about prophecy so this story
[32:03] Ezra and Nehemiah and also Haggai
[32:06] Zechariah and Malachi all those are
[32:08] about the same time period so would it
[32:11] be nice if we had a Bible that was in
[32:13] chronological order would that be nice
[32:14] you can buy them you can buy them I
[32:17] found actually a chronological order so
[32:20] Daniel I'll just read it briefly Daniel
[32:22] 10 to 12 then Ezra one two three Ezra
[32:24] four to six Psalms 137 Haggai Zechariah
[32:27] Esther and then back to Ezra 7 and 10
[32:31] Nehemiah lamentations like if you line
[32:32] it up that's the order that they go
[32:34] through so in other words God had
[32:37] different people all over the time all
[32:39] over the place right and delivering the
[32:41] Word of God God was ministering to all
[32:43] those people and all trying to get them
[32:45] to serve the Lord but then also see the
[32:48] restoration back in Israel now he had to
[32:50] do that Church we know he had to do that
[32:51] because he had to send his son Jesus
[32:53] Christ praise God so it's all pointing
[32:56] together to send like what Malachi look
[32:58] we're talking about he's got to come
[33:00] suddenly to his temple praise God
[33:01] remember Malachi said that Jesus he's at
[33:03] my messenger I'll suddenly come to my
[33:06] temple that was Christ coming suddenly
[33:08] right right there to the temple of Herod
[33:10] and so all these work together but we
[33:13] follow three main men's aru Bible Ezra
[33:16] and Nehemiah these are the three men and
[33:19] this is Israel returning to the land
[33:23] after 70 years of Babylonian captivity
[33:26] of course there's a Syrian captivity
[33:27] there's different captivity there and
[33:31] this fulfills the prophecy we saw of
[33:33] Jeremiah now there's at least a
[33:36] three-fold restoration so this is what I
[33:39] was trying to share her sister care a
[33:40] little bit they first reached once they
[33:42] got back they restored the altar which
[33:44] was blood
[33:45] second was the temple which is like the
[33:48] worship next was the law
[33:52] ezra brought in the law after that and
[33:53] the last thing was the wall so that's my
[33:57] brother branham when he if you listen to
[33:59] the restoration of ride tree he
[34:00] references this because he's he's using
[34:03] again the force he's sitting them
[34:05] sometimes there's three sometimes
[34:06] there's four right there's sometimes
[34:09] there's three sometimes four you got to
[34:11] use in the right way but this story
[34:13] looks like a four right looks like a
[34:15] four if you have the blood you know the
[34:17] whole temple you have the word restored
[34:19] and then you have the walls restored and
[34:22] if I could you know I think there's a
[34:25] little bit of type here and let me uh
[34:27] let me just go back to the Proverbs if
[34:30] you would hear this scripture just come
[34:34] to my mind I didn't really have a prayer
[34:35] yeah proverbs 25 if you could who's got
[34:38] to Bible children you got to go out
[34:39] there
[34:39] Lydia proverbs 25 could you do it
[34:42] twenty-eight can you read that whenever
[34:48] you're ready Lydia yeah so I was looking
[34:58] at this even as a spiritual application
[34:59] here the last thing that's restored is
[35:06] the wall and the Bible says it's like a
[35:10] mind so I'm gonna apply this to like
[35:12] spiritual maturity but hey men when you
[35:15] and I and when the Bride of Christ you
[35:17] know when we get real mature
[35:18] well we'll be overcoming in mind battles
[35:22] like you know like the Bible said like
[35:24] immature people are tossed by every wind
[35:26] of doctrine but when you really get
[35:28] established in the gospel those winds of
[35:32] doctrine don't move you right like we're
[35:35] not moved by the jeffersonville thing no
[35:36] like I said I have questions and other
[35:37] things you know things I've never heard
[35:39] before those will kind of shake you up
[35:40] but but they're out of it I like what
[35:43] this you know it goes from blood to the
[35:45] temple to the law the word and then
[35:48] restoring the walls or giving them this
[35:50] protection and it's like Paul says be
[35:53] transformed in the renewing of your mind
[35:56] okay so that's one way I explain this
[35:58] sister Karen just briefly and I think
[36:00] Wendy might even stay in there too and I
[36:01] said that I said it's a beautiful
[36:02] picture how we need the blood the first
[36:04] thing they establishes get the blood of
[36:05] Christ amen
[36:06] get forgiven get the blood flowing amen
[36:09] get that get the people forgiven praise
[36:11] God and then build the house of God and
[36:15] then they bring the Nezzer brought the
[36:17] law and then protect yourselves be so
[36:21] firm and and established and protected
[36:23] that nobody can break down and harm you
[36:26] praise God
[36:27] you're strong you've got a law you rule
[36:29] over your own spirit
[36:31] you're not tossed by every wind of
[36:34] doctrine but you're strong in the faith
[36:36] all right maokai you ready buddy all
[36:39] right let's look at a wine I just going
[36:40] to order with my children will the start
[36:42] the oldest and go down
[36:43] Lydia is always so good about that you
[36:45] know it's my first job right there Yeah
[36:46] right brother bang firstborn you know
[36:50] you got to be right there any other
[36:53] firstborns in here nature yeah Lily wait
[36:57] it's your turn next year pretty soon
[36:59] yeah so I was looking at like that it's
[37:02] it's a restoration that we can learn
[37:05] right the first thing we need to get is
[37:07] do is get saved right we need the blood
[37:09] of Jesus Christ and then God will just
[37:12] reach to restore more build it back up
[37:14] build it back up until finally we can be
[37:17] so mature
[37:18] we're transformed day by day not just
[37:20] once in a while but every day were
[37:22] transformed to Christ image that's why I
[37:25] think this is a beautiful type but
[37:26] mainly it applies 144 thousand but like
[37:29] I said I'm there's a lot of gems or a
[37:32] lot of nuggets we can pull out here for
[37:33] us and shine them up and say my that's
[37:35] beautiful I can see how that applies to
[37:37] my life okay now as run
[37:40] we're in ezra here okay Malachi let's
[37:43] see I like to but before I go here
[37:46] Zuba bowl here is let's go to chapter 2
[37:52] Malachi Ezra 2 1 yeah can you read
[37:56] verses 1 and 2 buddy to chapter 2 1 knit
[37:59] 1 & 2
[38:05] now these are the children of the
[38:08] prophets that went up out of the
[38:09] captivity of those which have been
[38:12] carried away who Nebuchadnezzar the king
[38:14] of Babylon had carried away into Babylon
[38:16] and came again to Jerusalem and Judah
[38:18] everyone into a city which came was
[38:22] really before Joshua Nehemiah
[38:24] Sariah Rita Leia Mordecai Bill shun this
[38:29] part
[38:35] alright so buddy Caesar will run their
[38:37] Zoo rule means descending from Babylon
[38:41] see the Babel like the rubra bull the
[38:43] bull about the bull that's like Babel so
[38:46] his name means I was born or I'm
[38:49] descending from Babylon so he was a
[38:52] child or he was a man but he was a when
[38:54] he was a child he was B was born in
[38:56] Babylon and his name name means I'm from
[38:59] Babylon and Church he was one and his
[39:02] this is what the history says he was one
[39:05] of 42,000 Jews that was willing across
[39:08] the desert from Babylon back to Israel
[39:12] so I think that I think the number I
[39:15] don't have it in front of me but I
[39:16] thought it I could be wrong I thought
[39:17] was a hundred a couple hundred thousand
[39:19] a couple hundred thousand Jews got taken
[39:21] over to Babylon and when the King said
[39:24] God's anointed me who wants to go back
[39:26] only a small fraction wanted to go back
[39:30] see and that's how it is today only a
[39:33] small fraction of church members really
[39:34] want Christ right only only a small
[39:38] number of people I come to church really
[39:40] want to labor for God because both bang
[39:42] there was nothing there everything was
[39:44] burnt down they burnt you know it was
[39:47] burnt down to the ground by
[39:49] Nebuchadnezzar nothing's left there's
[39:51] nothing to build apart like when we
[39:53] walked in here it was pretty dirty but
[39:54] there was walls and we painted the walls
[39:57] Lydian children remember that Karen
[39:59] scrub the floors and everybody you know
[40:01] find a little spot here to help out when
[40:04] you I think he painted some yeah that's
[40:05] right you painted this room that's right
[40:07] but see we had so much more advantage
[40:09] because we had a building they had
[40:12] nothing so if this was really asking who
[40:16] wants the labor for
[40:18] the kingdom of God and a small little
[40:20] group led by a zerubabbel raises up now
[40:23] what's beautiful Church that I'll
[40:24] encourage you look in chapter 2 in verse
[40:27] 36 so goes through all the lists in
[40:30] verse 36 it shows the priests in verse
[40:33] 40 it shows the Levites verse 41 it
[40:36] shows the singers brother Amen and
[40:38] Malachi and all of our singers sister
[40:40] Wendy sister Naomi all of our songs
[40:42] special singers
[40:43] yeah banger your songs special singer
[40:45] aren't you BAE I'm just kidding man see
[40:48] his name wouldn't be in the singer sexy
[40:50] right neither would mine see but look
[40:54] God has a place for everybody can you
[40:55] see that and now the beautiful thing is
[40:57] you know we it's hardly a meant for us
[40:59] to read this all these names at John but
[41:01] it shows God is keeping track of you and
[41:03] I hey man God is not gonna forget you if
[41:08] your names on his book amen
[41:10] if you're not sure repent and get right
[41:11] with God then for sure your names on the
[41:14] book Alleluia because he said he will
[41:17] not turn away 1 no man can pluck them
[41:20] out of my father's hand that's what I
[41:21] love about that it's hard to read sister
[41:23] Wendy I know him for me too I have a
[41:25] hard time Reena but it shows how mindful
[41:27] God is that he sees the singers he sees
[41:30] the priests the preachers the Levites he
[41:33] sees everybody and we all got to be in
[41:35] our position praise God it's beautiful
[41:38] now if you notice though back in verse 2
[41:40] there's a couple Nehemiah's the nehemiah
[41:43] we know didn't come till quite a while
[41:46] after Ezra so you can see in verse 2 is
[41:50] then which came with zoobel Joshua
[41:53] Nehemiah that's a different Nehemiah
[41:55] than the one who builds the wall just so
[41:56] you know there's a lot of years in here
[41:58] that pass so for example Ezra didn't
[42:03] come till 60 years after zerubabbel okay
[42:06] so zoomable was the leader of the first
[42:08] group to come back okay and then 60
[42:12] years after him then
[42:13] Ezra came okay but there's a lot that
[42:15] happened in there in these chapters let
[42:18] me set the time of your side I'm
[42:20] starting to feel good to you so then you
[42:24] see Solomon's servants in verse 55
[42:31] yeah then you see a returning priests
[42:34] and everything in the rest of the
[42:36] chapter all right now what's interesting
[42:41] in chapter 2 verse 62 there's a group
[42:44] which cannot find their names in the
[42:46] genealogy and so's ruble keeps them out
[42:49] of the priesthood that's how important
[42:52] is that your name on the book
[42:54] praise God we're not talking our natural
[42:56] book now we're talking about spiritual
[42:57] book the book of life if your name's not
[42:59] there if your name's not in the book of
[43:01] life
[43:02] there's no eternal life the name has to
[43:04] remain because it says these sought
[43:06] their register among those that were
[43:08] reckoned by genealogy but they were not
[43:09] found therefore were they as polluted
[43:12] put from the priesthood so no matter
[43:14] what they said if their names aren't on
[43:16] the records they're not serving in that
[43:18] capacity as that's how it is with us if
[43:21] our name's not in the Lamb's Book of
[43:23] Life
[43:23] we won't be in the bride but if our
[43:25] names in there we're in the bride praise
[43:27] God how do you know but man says this is
[43:29] how you know as we listened to it last
[43:30] night a home church should remember in
[43:32] the first seal brother Branham says how
[43:34] do you know he said when you hear the
[43:35] word you just want to do it right away
[43:37] that's how you know hey man he said
[43:40] you'll be so happy to do it you just
[43:42] can't wait to do it amen that's how you
[43:44] know there has to be a difference
[43:46] between the wise and the foolish version
[43:48] the wise can't wait to keep the word
[43:50] hallelujah yeah so verse 64 says 42 and
[43:55] thousand came back three hundred and
[43:57] threescore so out of the hundreds of
[44:00] thousands only a fraction came now they
[44:06] all give their substance can case you
[44:10] how are you able to read I know you got
[44:13] a Bible okay
[44:15] yeah could you do verse 68 I just read
[44:21] 68 and 69 and just some really just some
[44:23] beautiful words here
[44:56] [Music]
[45:01] hey man I just want to bring that verse
[45:03] 69 they gave after their ability I want
[45:08] to say the church God's not asking you
[45:09] do something you don't have God's I ask
[45:11] you to give something that you don't
[45:12] have he he wants to see you give from
[45:16] your ability praise God
[45:19] now Paul talks about you know the
[45:21] physical giving you know in 2nd
[45:23] Corinthians 10 I believe it is but I'm
[45:25] talking about even spiritual - you know
[45:27] we shouldn't we God's not asking us to
[45:29] do something that we can't do we just
[45:31] have to be willing to give it and you
[45:32] know I'm just finishing up Exodus and I
[45:34] saw the same thing when Moses about the
[45:35] tabernacle the Bible said they had so
[45:37] much to left over they had to tell the
[45:39] people stop giving to church you know
[45:40] stop stop we got enough I just finished
[45:42] it Exodus 29 no I'm sorry 39 38 39 there
[45:46] was they were so willing to do anything
[45:48] for God and that's what we got we got to
[45:50] be willing to do all we can for Christ
[45:51] so after your ability now chapter 3 is
[45:54] when the altar is set up so there there
[45:56] there and in the second year they start
[45:59] building the altar so they're there a
[46:01] year they get their tent set up they
[46:03] kind of get used to the rubbish and
[46:05] everything laying around but it's in
[46:06] their second year of ministry they erect
[46:09] the altar and lay the foundation of the
[46:11] temple okay so this is chapter 3 the
[46:14] altar is set up and then they establish
[46:18] the reestablish some worship praise God
[46:24] now I'm gonna go ahead and read verse 2
[46:28] and 3 then stood up joshua the son of
[46:31] josedech and his brethren the priests
[46:33] and zerubbabel the son of shealtiel and
[46:35] his brethren and builded the altar of
[46:38] the God of Israel to offer burnt
[46:40] offerings thereupon as is written the
[46:42] law of Moses the man of God and they set
[46:45] the altar upon his bases for fear was
[46:48] upon them because of the people of those
[46:50] countries and they offered burnt
[46:53] offerings thereon unto Lord even burnt
[46:55] offerings morning
[46:56] and evening and that's what I read it
[47:00] recently this week when God told Aaron
[47:02] he said every morning you offer a
[47:04] sacrifice lamb and incense blood and
[47:10] prayer right forgiveness and prayer
[47:14] morning and night hey Lord forgive me
[47:18] for my sins and know God offer up a
[47:20] prayer to God every morning every night
[47:23] praise God like when you share with me
[47:25] one time about the do when is the due in
[47:27] the morning and in the evening what are
[47:29] you gonna have your sweet times to the
[47:30] Lord well hopefully all throughout the
[47:32] day but definitely the morning and
[47:34] definitely the evening but you got to
[47:36] take time to enjoy it
[47:37] praise God it's a good point so morning
[47:41] and evening and then they start keeping
[47:44] the TAT the Feast of the Tabernacles in
[47:46] verse 4 praise God alright so that's the
[47:53] next chapter there chapter 3 they get
[47:56] the they get the altar and the
[48:00] Foundation's laid now if you notice
[48:02] verse 4 I'm sorry chapter 4 this is when
[48:06] the adversity starts coming so it
[48:08] searches like they get they're really
[48:09] enthusiastic at the beginning but then
[48:12] God allows tests right God allows tests
[48:15] so you can have a testimony there's no
[48:19] test if there's no test there's no
[48:20] testimony right now I'd like to let's
[48:25] look at this here real quick actually
[48:26] just go back to chapter 3 I don't want
[48:28] to forget this here's one thing I want
[48:29] to in chapter 3 we see that this
[48:33] rebuilding is actually speaking of the
[48:36] Millennial temple okay so go to chapter
[48:39] 3 verse 10 Haven can you read hon do you
[48:42] got your back for there oh you hit well
[48:46] it's okay I know where my Mormon says
[48:47] Wendy can you read a few sister Wendy
[48:49] can you read 10 and 11 in chapter 3 10
[48:53] and 11 with trumpets and the Levites
[49:03] with the Sun they stood with symbols to
[49:07] praise the Lord after the organist
[49:10] David king of Israel and they sang
[49:13] together by the horse in praising and
[49:15] giving thanks unto the Lord because he
[49:19] is good for his mercy endureth forever
[49:21] Israel and all the people shouted with
[49:26] great shout when they praise the Lord
[49:28] because of foundation of the house of
[49:30] the Lord was late amen so in verse three
[49:34] they finished the altar and then in
[49:37] verse eleven they finished the
[49:39] foundation okay and we just saw remember
[49:43] children we just thought are across the
[49:44] road member they finished the foundation
[49:46] a couple months ago now we saw that were
[49:49] like oh they got a pretty good start but
[49:50] when Israel laid the foundation of their
[49:52] temple they shout and said hallelujah
[49:54] praise God we got the foundation we're
[49:56] getting started here and it's a great
[49:58] thing they had a great shout but look at
[50:01] verse 12 and 13 when a man can you read
[50:02] 12 brother 3:12 when the foundation of
[50:13] this house was laid before their eyes
[50:14] well with a loud voice and many sounded
[50:17] a lot for joy verse 30 so that the
[50:20] people could not discern the noise of
[50:22] the shout of joy from the noise of
[50:23] weeping of the people for the people
[50:25] shouted with a loud shout and the noise
[50:26] was heard afar off so you got the older
[50:29] generation like oh this is such a small
[50:31] tiny temple this isn't anything like we
[50:34] had but the young people that never had
[50:35] a church were like we got a charge
[50:37] praise God we're doing to suffer the
[50:39] kingdom of God but the old generation
[50:41] instead of enjoying it they got
[50:42] discouraged but can you blame them they
[50:44] didn't have the Holy Ghost they didn't
[50:46] they didn't know what God was doing and
[50:48] so see that shows that that the older
[50:52] generation was was seeking something as
[50:54] great as Solomon but it wasn't for that
[50:56] that wasn't for them that at that time
[50:59] that was gonna be in the Millenium
[51:01] praise God so they had their minds
[51:03] thinking like oh this is gonna be a
[51:05] great a solemn and and God wasn't doing
[51:07] that God was doing a smaller thing right
[51:10] God wasn't doing as a great thing he was
[51:12] doing a smaller thing and they should
[51:14] have rejoiced
[51:15] they shouldn't rejoice because God was
[51:17] doing a great thing brother bang they
[51:19] they had been the slaves right for 70
[51:21] years they've been either land but
[51:23] now they're back and they got the
[51:25] foundation laid they all have been happy
[51:28] let's see it's a pre figure there's
[51:31] gonna be a great temple one day praise
[51:33] God
[51:33] hey man and gods son how to do the son
[51:36] of David will sit on the throne in that
[51:38] Millennial temple and a rule with a rod
[51:40] of iron amen
[51:41] are they within all nations will flow
[51:44] into Israel for judgments praise God
[51:46] that's actually that's absolutely
[51:48] scriptural court and Isaiah and other
[51:50] scriptures we have now a little more
[51:53] unsuitable chapter for the adversaries
[51:57] come now a new king raises up named
[52:02] artaxerxes okay and the adversaries lie
[52:09] to artaxerxes and say all the jews won't
[52:12] pay tolls if you don't let them or if
[52:15] you let him build a house they're not
[52:16] going to pay you and the King believed
[52:17] him and so they shut down in verse in
[52:21] chapter 4 17 to 22 our deserts he sends
[52:24] a decree and stops them from building
[52:28] the house so they're in the midst of
[52:29] revival and then discouragement comes
[52:35] Lydia can you do verses 23 and 24 in
[52:38] chapter 4 he's gone I remember that when
[53:03] Troy was here
[53:04] Troy was right as far as we he and I
[53:06] both had the history the Bible
[53:08] Dictionary says they shut him down for
[53:10] 16 years 16 years they were all there
[53:14] all revival mode for a couple years they
[53:17] got the altar they got a foundation and
[53:19] then Satan got in there and tried to
[53:21] fight against him and he shut him down
[53:23] for 16 years at the end of that 16 years
[53:28] God raised up two prophets look at
[53:31] chapter 5 and
[53:35] rebukes them there so it looks like to
[53:37] me Church they should have fought
[53:39] against those guys and kept trying to
[53:42] rebuild the temple because God rebukes
[53:44] him in Haggai and Zechariah now I go to
[53:49] the chapter 5 verse 1 then the prophets
[53:54] Hagee I the Prophet and Zechariah the
[53:56] son of Odin to the Jews that were in
[53:59] Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the
[54:01] God of Israel even unto them then rose
[54:04] up zerubabbel so you've been sitting
[54:05] down for 16 years then he rose up the
[54:08] son of shealtiel and joshua the son of
[54:10] josedech and began to build the house of
[54:12] God which I drew some and with them
[54:13] which I'm sorry were the prophets of God
[54:16] helping them I like that the prophets
[54:19] then just preach they were right there
[54:20] on the front lines
[54:21] let's bill what can I do where can i or
[54:24] can I help out where can I paint where
[54:26] can I clean what trash can I take out
[54:29] what bathroom can I clean what can I do
[54:31] see they're right there what to do their
[54:34] part everybody had to play a part and
[54:36] everybody was willing to help praise God
[54:37] now keep your place there I'm gonna get
[54:40] my Bible what's this called to Bible
[54:43] string where they call this thing that
[54:45] where they call that thing this yeah the
[54:48] book mark that's it right there
[54:49] ribbon or Brook mark leave your Bible
[54:52] ribbon there let's go to Aggie I can
[54:55] remember the name of that thing bookmark
[54:59] Aggie I so for 16 years I sit around
[55:10] doing nothing but actually they were
[55:11] doing something
[55:12] Haggai rebukes him because they're
[55:14] focusing on their house rather than
[55:16] God's house remember he we read it last
[55:19] week now verse 2 this people say the
[55:22] time has not come the time that the
[55:26] Lord's house should be rebuilt
[55:27] so once the government said I'm shutting
[55:30] you guys down you guys can't build
[55:32] everybody got discouraged it must not be
[55:34] the Lord's time but what had just
[55:35] happened gotta just put it on Cyrus's
[55:38] heart to let them build and so now
[55:41] another King comes in and shuts it down
[55:43] I think it must not be God's time but
[55:45] God was trying to show them you got to
[55:47] be willing to fight for his
[55:49] Victory's praise God like Joshua you got
[55:52] to do something to God said the whole
[55:53] lands yours but you got to go fight God
[55:56] was showing them you got a I want to see
[55:59] your faith I want to see you overcome
[56:00] with you the faith of God now look he
[56:04] says in verse three then came the word
[56:06] Lord by haggai the prophet saying is it
[56:08] time for you o ye to dwell in your
[56:09] sealed houses and this house house lie
[56:12] waste now therefore thus saith the Lord
[56:14] of God consider your ways this is where
[56:16] this is what he read last week here in
[56:20] other words were trying to save money
[56:21] but your your wallets full of holes
[56:24] then he verse 8 go up under the mountain
[56:26] and bring wood and build the house I'll
[56:28] take pleasure in it and I'll be
[56:30] glorified saith the Lord you look for
[56:35] much and lo it came a little and when
[56:36] you bought it home I did blow upon it
[56:38] why say at the Lord of Hosts because of
[56:40] my house that has laid waste and ye run
[56:42] every man unto his own house this is the
[56:46] point I was making I think I shared this
[56:47] with Amen one time when we first moved
[56:50] into this church right here I'm I told
[56:52] bang to my house needed a lot of work I
[56:55] think I told her a man lived in my house
[56:57] for a couple of months so he knows what
[56:59] but I put this house first before I
[57:01] fixed my up my own and so I put all the
[57:05] money on my tie I painted many of these
[57:07] walls and you know we went to the store
[57:10] and and made all the purchases here my
[57:12] whole focus was to get this house
[57:14] established first and then I got this
[57:16] house established first and then I felt
[57:19] the leading of the Lord once we knew
[57:20] Genevieve was on the way then I felt the
[57:22] Lina Lord to work on our house and and
[57:24] it worked out good with the builders
[57:26] plan and we got some loans there and
[57:28] everything worked out perfectly and it
[57:30] would just reminded me of this that God
[57:33] if God's doing something we've got to
[57:36] put God's house first and our house
[57:38] second it has to make your house nice
[57:41] for your kids yeah we should do that but
[57:43] first make God's house a good place
[57:45] praise God
[57:45] put your focus on God's house because
[57:48] that's what was that was the trouble
[57:50] they are running from the house of God
[57:51] rather than focusing on the house of God
[57:53] and then memory verse 11 there was a
[57:56] drought so God held back the rains
[57:58] because they were not focused on
[58:00] rebuilding the house of God
[58:03] because of persecution or legal trouble
[58:07] all right who's up is Lydia maokai okay
[58:14] can you go to Hagee i won Lilya verse
[58:18] twelve read twelve and thirteen I know
[58:19] it's a lot but let's make a guy the
[58:38] Lord's messenger and the Lord's message
[58:40] or do the people say I Amen praise God
[58:44] so I like that the Lord's messenger
[58:45] brother Branham in the Lord's message I
[58:49] like that but a man was God's messenger
[58:52] in the message right the message so is
[58:55] Hagee i he was the Lord the messenger in
[58:57] the Lord's message is the message of
[58:59] your hour right and like this in verse
[59:01] 14 the Lord stirred him up so that means
[59:04] they were discouraged zoomable was
[59:07] discouraged he got part of the victory
[59:09] but he hadn't seen the whole church
[59:12] built yet but it took two prophets by
[59:15] the bank prophesying and when they
[59:18] prophesied it stirred the people up to
[59:20] do something for God and that's the way
[59:22] the word should be for us all the time
[59:24] we should get word after service after
[59:27] service and it should stir us up praise
[59:28] God Amen I know there's a time and
[59:31] season for everything right I wish
[59:32] there's more signs and wonders and
[59:33] miracles I wish there's more Souls being
[59:35] saved by God knows I pray for I was
[59:37] praying for this morning I pray for it
[59:38] all the time but I know God's got a time
[59:40] in season four at all but one thing we
[59:42] can do is we can receive the word God
[59:45] sends us faithfully and let it stir sup
[59:47] for the next week and for the next few
[59:49] days and keep stirred up by the word of
[59:52] God that's something we can do because
[59:54] if the word is being preached it's not
[59:55] there just to fall on dead ground right
[59:57] it's there to be quickened by the Holy
[59:59] Spirit the seed of God's Word is to be
[1:00:02] quickened by the Holy Spirit and we can
[1:00:03] do that we can allow God to do that and
[1:00:06] look and they the spear of all around at
[1:00:08] finishing 14 at the end and they came
[1:00:11] and did the work of the house of the
[1:00:13] Lord of Hosts their God pray

[1:08:43] men they're like we're just a small
[1:08:45] little church you guys are nothing
[1:08:46] compared to what we used to me when we
[1:08:47] were first in a message I'm just gonna

[1:08:52] the old people were said you guys think

[1:09:10] things it's a smaller church less and
[1:09:13] less people being saved all the time
[1:09:14] fewer fewer will be that find it we have
[1:09:16] a today as small things but God is with

[1:09:19] that's right then that's how we can see
[1:09:22] how applies to our life because we can
[1:09:26] see it's a day of small things as far as
[1:09:28] small number okay all right good so
[1:09:37] that's a pretty good start and give me I
[1:09:39] got a couple minutes on here give me ten
[1:09:41] more minutes here by God's grace all
[1:09:44] right now go back if you would here we
[1:09:48] hit Zechariah and Haggai are let's go
[1:09:51] back to Ezra
[1:09:52] hope you got your Bible ribbon there
[1:09:53] your bookmark what's the name of that
[1:09:55] again okay gotcha
[1:09:57] I thought Chapter five Ezra fine now in
[1:10:08] verse three the governor who was set up
[1:10:12] by the Persian king his name's tat and I
[1:10:15] he sees them building again after
[1:10:18] sixteen years into verse threes like who
[1:10:20] have commanded you to build this house
[1:10:22] and to make up this wall verse five says
[1:10:27] but the eye of their God was upon the
[1:10:30] elders of the Jews that they could not
[1:10:32] cause them to cease praise God hey man
[1:10:36] they were so stirred up by these
[1:10:37] prophets that even the governor's
[1:10:39] couldn't stop him down they couldn't
[1:10:41] stop him
[1:10:42] see this proves light like Moses if
[1:10:44] God's with you all those Egyptian
[1:10:46] servants couldn't kill Moses cuz God
[1:10:48] would God send them there
[1:10:49] and all those servants of Pat and I and
[1:10:51] all of his soldiers they couldn't stop
[1:10:53] the builders because God was with them
[1:10:54] praise God and if God's with us we won't
[1:10:57] be able to be stopped praise God who
[1:10:59] keep doing the Word of God preaching the
[1:11:01] Word of God living it spreading it doing
[1:11:03] all we can if God is with us praise God
[1:11:05] Amen because the eye of their God is
[1:11:09] upon them hallelujah now here is
[1:11:16] where the temple is finished go to
[1:11:20] chapter six in chapter 6 a new leader
[1:11:24] raises up so we went from cyrus
[1:11:26] artaxerxes and now to darius that all
[1:11:29] sound familiar right from the days of
[1:11:31] daniel darius now he's helped supports
[1:11:40] it yeah he confirms the decree of Cyrus
[1:11:41] that's right yeah he that's right he
[1:11:43] finds the scroll of Cyrus that's right
[1:11:45] hey man I forgot about that bye and then
[1:11:51] he starts supporting it now
[1:11:52] first let's go 6 13 where I'm at Lydia
[1:11:55] is it your turn
[1:11:56] I don't know either go ahead sweetie sir
[1:11:59] Lydia 613 so did obeying the prophets
[1:12:36] help them out yes the Bible said they
[1:12:38] prospered and we can apply that because
[1:12:40] 2nd John says I would that you prosper
[1:12:43] in health even as your soul prospers
[1:12:45] right and then Chronicle says if you
[1:12:48] honor God's prophets God will honor you
[1:12:50] right so we can learn from that if we
[1:12:53] honor our brother his message the Word
[1:12:54] of God that he taught no no as we saw
[1:12:57] not every idea not every you know
[1:12:58] personal opinion a brother branham but
[1:13:00] honor the word that brother Ram brought
[1:13:01] God will prop Russ and I'm a living
[1:13:03] example of that are you - is your life
[1:13:06] prospering it ought to you know less
[1:13:10] you're going through like a job
[1:13:10] situation or something like that so we
[1:13:14] should see their lives prospered through
[1:13:17] the preaching of the word the prophets
[1:13:18] and they build it and they finished it
[1:13:21] praise God so Zuba was there to lay that
[1:13:23] last stone that headstone I wonder if I
[1:13:26] was rounded or pointed but he used the
[1:13:28] same one that laid the cornerstone and
[1:13:29] he lays the head so never shouting grace
[1:13:31] grace God gave us grace to finish this
[1:13:34] work amen hallelujah now verse 16 the
[1:13:38] children Israel the priests and the
[1:13:39] Levites in the rest the children of the
[1:13:41] captivity kept the dedication in this
[1:13:43] house of God with joy and offered at the
[1:13:46] dedication the house have got a hundred
[1:13:47] bullets there's a hundred bullocks my
[1:13:50] goodness I can't imagine how much blood
[1:13:52] that would be can you imagine it
[1:13:53] 2,000 Rams 2,000 revs I don't even know
[1:13:58] what $2,000 looks like little in 2000
[1:14:00] Rams I'm sorry 200 yeah thank you 400
[1:14:05] lambs
[1:14:06] and for a sin offering for all Israel 12
[1:14:08] he goads accorded a number of the tribes
[1:14:11] of Israel and they set the leave of the
[1:14:14] priests in their divisions the Levites
[1:14:15] in their courses for the service of God
[1:14:16] which was at Jerusalem as is written in
[1:14:18] the Book of Moses now look they're
[1:14:19] trying to restore David's worship that's
[1:14:22] what we're trying to restore the book of
[1:14:23] Acts worship amen
[1:14:25] see there's so many are so many
[1:14:26] applicable types it's a smaller thing
[1:14:28] it's a smaller work is not as big as the
[1:14:30] zoo the street you know but we're trying
[1:14:32] to restore what they had the beginning
[1:14:34] praise God this would be smaller it's
[1:14:37] gonna be despised we said don't get
[1:14:38] discouraged about size just keep working
[1:14:40] for the kingdom of God amen and then
[1:14:45] they restore the Passover in at the end
[1:14:47] of chapter 6 now for those you who know
[1:14:51] chapter 7 begins
[1:14:53] Ezra so verses or chapters 1 to 6 is 0
[1:14:57] bible and then Ezra fast-forward 60
[1:15:00] years and now you have Azra coming back
[1:15:03] and Ezra is a teacher of the law so he's
[1:15:09] back at Babylon and he just raised
[1:15:11] enough you know and he's just learning
[1:15:13] the Word of God and he gets a
[1:15:17] opportunity to go back to Jerusalem
[1:15:21] that's going on a 7 verse 9 Wendy could
[1:15:25] you read Ezra 7 90/10 please
[1:15:43] good and of his thought upon him or as
[1:15:47] her had prepared his heart to seek the
[1:15:50] law of the Lord and to do it teach an
[1:15:53] issue status
[1:15:54] and that beautiful Ezra had prepared his
[1:15:58] heart not just to seek God but to do it
[1:16:01] we could all grain a we can all gain a
[1:16:03] great lesson right there how many read
[1:16:06] your Bible everything you read your
[1:16:07] Bible
[1:16:07] how many pray every day now how many
[1:16:08] ready to do it every day now that's a
[1:16:10] whole new thing right there that's the
[1:16:12] Azra as I said I prepare my heart I know
[1:16:14] the word and I'm gonna do the word now
[1:16:17] one thing I didn't did you catch that
[1:16:18] and verse nine it was a four month trip
[1:16:22] can you imagine starting now for your
[1:16:23] homeland sister Naomi and trying to go
[1:16:25] back to Ghana four months later so
[1:16:27] February March April meant you get there
[1:16:29] in May you get there in two days right

[1:16:33] right but four months he had to travel
[1:16:35] all the way back to his homeland four
[1:16:37] months but he was prepared in his heart
[1:16:40] the Bible says he was already scribe in
[1:16:43] verse six Ezra went up from Babylon for
[1:16:45] he was already scribe in the law of
[1:16:46] Moses so all those years in Babylon he
[1:16:49] prepared study the word study the word
[1:16:51] that's what I tell you children and even
[1:16:53] you adults you brothers to God might
[1:16:55] raise you up to be preachers someday now
[1:16:56] I got a night raised to be a preacher
[1:16:57] something you don't know what God is
[1:17:00] gonna do with you but keep that word in
[1:17:01] your heart read the word obey the word
[1:17:04] live the word be ready because Bible
[1:17:06] says be ready instant in season and out
[1:17:08] of season amen that's what Azra he
[1:17:11] didn't know if it's gonna be him or not
[1:17:12] he didn't know he just kept his heart
[1:17:14] ready always be ready right like we said
[1:17:18] this morning always be ready to give an
[1:17:19] answer
[1:17:20] Lord willing I'm gonna debate that guy
[1:17:22] and that's why I got a I got to go
[1:17:24] through these and I appreciate you
[1:17:25] listening to me it really helps me I
[1:17:27] appreciate sharing the comments
[1:17:28] afterwards I got to have a Bible answer
[1:17:30] for everything because my dad said God
[1:17:32] won't do anything outside the Bible he
[1:17:34] could but he won't
[1:17:36] so anything that happened in whether his
[1:17:38] ministry there has to be some Bible
[1:17:40] example for it because brother answered
[1:17:43] God won't leave the Bible and he won't
[1:17:44] have an ER shall pass away my were never
[1:17:46] best way so as I said there I don't have
[1:17:50] to understand everything but I got to
[1:17:52] have proof about why God would do
[1:17:54] something like that
[1:17:55] okay so I appreciate that here I go
[1:17:59] again I just get on the spirit of
[1:18:01] preaching
[1:18:01] okay now let's close with a couple more
[1:18:05] things here I want to just lay this in
[1:18:09] okay so 60 years later
[1:18:11] Ezra comes and let me just show you
[1:18:15] where can I just show you where maokai
[1:18:16] fits in here okay now
[1:18:19] Nehemiah comes 14 years after Ezra so
[1:18:23] now you got it
[1:18:24] Zuma Bowl 60 years after him Ezra 14
[1:18:29] years after Ezra comes Nehemiah and he's
[1:18:32] the one he's like he's like he's praying
[1:18:33] oh god kind of he said Oh King can I go
[1:18:35] see the ha I've heard about the walls
[1:18:37] broken down and the King goes yeah go
[1:18:38] ahead and he gets there and he rides
[1:18:40] through the the city at night and he
[1:18:41] starts weeping and crying because all
[1:18:43] the walls are down the temples there but
[1:18:45] the walls are broken down and he built
[1:18:47] that thing as fast as he could the Bible
[1:18:50] said they fought with one hand and they
[1:18:52] bill with the other can you imagine
[1:18:54] get off me devil but they're building
[1:18:56] get out that's that's that's how
[1:18:58] enthused they were about the work of God
[1:19:01] but let me show you where Malachi fits
[1:19:05] in so I'm closing with us go to Nehemiah
[1:19:06] 13 6 here's where Malachi comes in
[1:19:12] because all these prophets are so
[1:19:14] closely connected
[1:19:16] Ezra Nehemiah Haggai Zechariah Malachi
[1:19:20] so according to this Bible Dictionary in
[1:19:23] Nehemiah 13 6 all right just a moment ok
[1:19:40] so yeah so the walls are already
[1:19:41] finished the yeah I'm almost the walls
[1:19:45] get finished in chapter 12 they dedicate
[1:19:49] the walls in chapter 12 now 13 verse 6
[1:19:51] they start cleaning out the temple again
[1:19:53] so even though they're so encouraged
[1:19:55] they got the wall up the people back
[1:19:57] slid in the church they and I got to go
[1:20:00] back and clean up the church they just
[1:20:02] when they built it what less than what
[1:20:03] 80 years ago and the people are working
[1:20:05] on the Sabbath they're intermarrying
[1:20:07] these heathen
[1:20:08] don't believe the word they're selling
[1:20:10] money like the moneychangers with Jesus
[1:20:11] it's all that stuff and so once they
[1:20:14] once Nehemiah he's so encouraged he got
[1:20:16] the walls up that he got I got to go
[1:20:17] back and clean out the beginning again
[1:20:19] see judgment begins at the house of God
[1:20:22] always judgment begins right here with
[1:20:25] you and I but if we obey it will bypass
[1:20:27] the judgment later the Nehemiah thirteen
[1:20:31] six now this is when they were stealing
[1:20:37] some money to here not thirteen six but
[1:20:39] in all this time was I not in Jerusalem
[1:20:41] for in the two and thirty at 30th year
[1:20:43] of artaxerxes king of Babylon came I
[1:20:45] under the king and after certain days
[1:20:46] obtained I leave of the king so there's
[1:20:48] about two years Nehemiah left after
[1:20:51] getting the walls done he went back to
[1:20:53] king artaxerxes and history says during
[1:20:57] that time Malachi comes in and preaches
[1:21:00] he's the last prophet he's the last
[1:21:03] prophet before Jesus Christ comes right
[1:21:05] before John the Baptist and most you
[1:21:07] know the book of Malachi but if you go
[1:21:10] down to Nehemiah 3:10 Lydia you got your
[1:21:14] Bible now okay oh yeah okay Lydia Matt
[1:21:17] Nehemiah 1310 and can you read that then
[1:21:32] consider the reason why is the house of
[1:21:34] God forsaken and I gather them together
[1:21:36] and set them in their place and then
[1:21:38] look at verse 12 then they brought all
[1:21:39] the tithes of the corn the new wine
[1:21:42] right in the oil and does that sound
[1:21:46] familiar if you run the reference in
[1:21:48] your Scofield Bible where does it take
[1:21:49] you
[1:21:50] Malachi 3 so let's stand with a sinner
[1:21:52] of feet and clothes right there so it's
[1:21:54] beautiful
[1:21:55] while Nehemiah is not there God sends
[1:21:58] Malachi there to preach to them and say
[1:22:01] you've robbed the house of God with your
[1:22:03] tithes and offerings and nobody nobody
[1:22:05] says anything about it two years there
[1:22:06] in Nehemiah comes back he's not ever
[1:22:08] seen people aren't paying their tithes
[1:22:09] and offerings in here and the people
[1:22:12] repent and they because all the Levites
[1:22:13] are out there working so see the people
[1:22:16] when Nehemiah was gone they disobeyed
[1:22:18] Malachi but then when God's man gets
[1:22:20] back Nehemiah he
[1:22:22] brings up the same thing and said we got
[1:22:23] to support the house of God now you all
[1:22:25] you do a great job paying your tithes
[1:22:26] offerings
[1:22:27] god bless you so do I paid my ties
[1:22:29] yesterday but uh but look I just want to
[1:22:33] see how it fits together when there was
[1:22:35] no met that meant no man they're like
[1:22:36] Nehemiah God send in Malachi you know
[1:22:38] Malachi means my messenger remember
[1:22:42] Hagee I was the Lord's messenger in the
[1:22:44] Lord's message God said one more he said
[1:22:46] my messengers going there to try to warn
[1:22:49] those people before I send John the
[1:22:51] Baptist's in Jesus Christ so Malachi 3 7
[1:22:55] now Church you can know how it kind of I
[1:22:57] hope this helps does this help you can
[1:22:59] see how it's just beautiful stories to
[1:23:03] understand the Old Testament because all
[1:23:06] these guys are thinking what who are
[1:23:07] these guys preaching to it's all that
[1:23:09] that returning group that returning
[1:23:11] small little group God was doing
[1:23:13] something small but he's preparing them
[1:23:15] to receive the Christ and then that was
[1:23:18] all prefigure of preparing receiving the
[1:23:20] Son of David in the Millennium the glory
[1:23:24] of the latter will be greater than the
[1:23:26] former praise God
[1:23:28] Malachi 3 7 even from the days of your
[1:23:33] fathers are you going away from my
[1:23:34] ordinances I've not kept them returned
[1:23:36] unto me and I'll return them to you say
[1:23:37] the Lord of Hosts but you say we're and
[1:23:39] shall we return will a man Rob God yet
[1:23:42] you have robbed me but you say wherein
[1:23:43] have we robbed thee and tithes and
[1:23:45] offerings your curse with a curse for
[1:23:47] you have robbed me even this whole
[1:23:48] nation but the Amen you were saying
[1:23:49] about the storehouse tonight I thought
[1:23:51] that's some indication right there bring
[1:23:53] you all the tithes into the storehouse
[1:23:54] that there may be meat in mine house and
[1:23:57] prove me now herewith saith the Lord of
[1:23:59] Hosts if I will not open you the windows
[1:24:00] of heaven and pour out a blessing that
[1:24:02] there should not be room enough to
[1:24:05] receive it
[1:24:06] alright let's have our musicians come
[1:24:07] praise God now I just I didn't get to
[1:24:13] all of it but I hope you can see it now
[1:24:15] Zorua bow first then Ezra well I guess
[1:24:19] you could say servile Haggai Zechariah
[1:24:21] then 60 years later
[1:24:23] Ezra and then 14 years later
[1:24:26] Nehemiah Nehemiah comes rebuilds the
[1:24:29] walls he's got to go back and then
[1:24:30] Malachi comes in and gives him thus
[1:24:32] saith the Lord then Nehemiah comes back
[1:24:35] you know that guy did
[1:24:36] he broke up those marriages the Bible
[1:24:38] said he ripped out their beards can you
[1:24:39] imagine a preacher doing that he rips
[1:24:41] out their beers rip out their hair he in
[1:24:44] other words he just does anything to try
[1:24:45] to get them obey the Word of God I was
[1:24:47] at the right spirit probably not
[1:24:48] I never seen Jesus ripping out people's
[1:24:50] hair although he was whipping him you
[1:24:53] know whipping the animals things not
[1:24:54] hurt the animals but trying to clean out
[1:24:57] the house of God hope that's a blessing
[1:25:00] Church and each one's ruble and Ezra
[1:25:02] brought a wave of people back they were
[1:25:05] bringing people back to restore God's
[1:25:09] worship do you think God's interested in
[1:25:11] worship absolutely
[1:25:13] you think God wants people to act like
[1:25:14] that at the beginning absolutely he
[1:25:17] wants it to be restored that's why we're
[1:25:19] here tonight let's bow our heads here
[1:25:21] for a word of Prayer
[1:25:23] God is a great restorer how many babies
[1:25:26] a great Redeemer a great restorer he's
[1:25:28] so great Church he wants it restored so
[1:25:30] bad he'll even anoint heathen kings to
[1:25:32] do his purpose raise god don't have to
[1:25:35] be a Christian like I believe that with
[1:25:37] Donald Trump perhaps maybe honey no he's
[1:25:39] the Christian but God's using him to
[1:25:40] protect Israel
[1:25:43] got to use anybody but we want to be the
[1:25:48] faithful servants that hear the prophecy
[1:25:51] of this hour through God's prophet and
[1:25:54] we want to prosper in God's ways by
[1:25:58] obeying the Word of God
[1:26:00] how many raise your hand say yes Lord
[1:26:02] let that be me let me prosper by obeying
[1:26:05] the Word of God Heavenly Father Lord my
[1:26:09] hands are up Lord but I see it I see
[1:26:12] you're prospering hand each shot I get
[1:26:14] you just pour out more grace each
