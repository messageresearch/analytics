[30:32] let's go to our memory verse here for
[30:34] the pins 4 7 8
[30:54] with the ins 4 7 & 8 where my main text
[30:57] will be Hebrews 10 like to preach on
[31:00] price the all-sufficient sacrifice
[31:03] I should have preached on true seal for
[31:07] Easter Steve let's try to keep all my
[31:10] Easter sermon is a good Friday serving
[31:12] all the same documents I can always
[31:13] remember what did I preach before better
[31:16] give us a more larger perspective of
[31:19] what Christ has done praise God
[31:21] Philippians Philippians 4:7 8 let's read
[31:34] that together on three one two three and
[31:38] the peace of God which passeth all
[31:41] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[31:44] minds through Christ Jesus finally
[31:48] brethren whatsoever things are true
[31:50] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[31:53] things are just whatsoever things are
[31:58] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[32:00] whatsoever things are of good report if
[32:04] there be any virtue and if there be any
[32:08] praise think on these things praise God
[32:11] let's go to Hebrews chapter 10 verse 7
[32:18] hebrews 10:7 you know I love this time
[32:30] of the year I know we've said it before
[32:31] you know a lot of churches make this a
[32:33] more special week than any week I
[32:35] believe every week is special every week
[32:37] is holy week every season is Lenten
[32:39] season but it is wonderful just to
[32:43] review a lot of these foundational
[32:46] principles and it really reminds me of
[32:48] Christ power praise God and what he's
[32:51] done to my sins praise God they were far
[32:55] away as our brothers were singing it
[32:56] he's taken my sins far away he took them
[32:58] down to hell praise God and then he
[33:00] blotted out all the handwriting just
[33:02] washed it away with the bleach of his
[33:04] blood as we saw last night nailed it to
[33:07] his cross
[33:07] he's got such a beautiful reminder I
[33:10] love this time of year as well
[33:11] hebrews 10:7 then said i lo i come in
[33:17] the volume of the book it is written of
[33:19] me to do thy will o God above when he
[33:23] said sacrifice and offering and burnt
[33:25] offerings and offering for sin thou
[33:27] wouldest not neither hats pleasure there
[33:30] and which are offered by the law verse 9
[33:34] then he then said he lo I come to do thy
[33:37] will O God he taketh away the first that
[33:41] he may establish the second let's read
[33:44] verse 10 together on three one two three
[33:46] by the which will we are sanctified
[33:50] through the offering of the body of
[33:53] Jesus Christ once for all once for all
[33:57] this all sufficient sacrifice praise God
[34:00] they go down to verse 14 let's read that
[34:02] as well this is what I cling to church
[34:04] when I see my mistakes or I get down and
[34:06] I love to revisit these I can clean to
[34:09] these scriptures right here I only need
[34:11] a one sacrifice and it has forever
[34:14] perfected me for ever forgiving me I'm
[34:17] in the process of it but Jesus sees me
[34:19] as a finished work praise God he's
[34:21] working with me he's helping me to die
[34:23] daily
[34:23] but he sees me he sees you by the blood
[34:26] of Christ as perfect sanctified a
[34:29] finished word praise God verse 14 that's
[34:32] Rita on three one two three four by one
[34:35] offering he hath perfected forever them
[34:38] that are sanctified amen let's have one
[34:41] more word of Prayer
[34:42] if ever need on your heartless making no
[34:44] names of God Heavenly Father we love
[34:46] this time we love this holy season every
[34:48] Sundays holy to me I lay on my face O
[34:52] God and cry out to you Lord we do it all
[34:54] the time Lord every days holy but here
[34:57] probably get there remember Lord all
[34:59] that you did through the resurrection in
[35:01] the cross and father we pray God let
[35:04] these truce be Lord more evident to our
[35:06] minds remind us of your all-sufficient
[35:09] sacrifice your resurrection Lord God how
[35:12] you justified us by raising Lord
[35:15] defeating death and hail Lord God bless
[35:17] us today in your divine presence Lord
[35:20] just renew our hearts
[35:21] our God with these truths that we might
[35:23] be better Christians Lord God we're
[35:25] thankful that it only took one sacrifice
[35:27] Lord God to finish all of our sin
[35:30] problem father we give you glory for
[35:32] that and we'll faithfully serve you all
[35:34] the days of our life from this easter on
[35:36] to every one until your coming in Jesus
[35:39] Christ's name and the church said Amen
[35:42] god bless yous B&C did praise God praise
[35:46] the Lord so I like to look at Christ the
[35:51] all sufficient sacrifice and just again
[35:54] back to the coronavirus I was just
[35:56] looking again this morning I think a
[35:58] hundred thousand worldwide have died but
[36:01] remember in two thousand nine and ten
[36:02] almost six hundred thousand died from
[36:05] the swine flu before that over a million
[36:09] died in the Hong Kong flu in 1968 and 69
[36:12] two million in the Asia flu from 1957
[36:15] and 58 and 50 million in the Spanish flu
[36:19] of 1918 and 1919 and I don't say that to
[36:23] you know make it seem like the world's
[36:27] you know doing anything wrong it's
[36:29] obviously a very awful sickness but we
[36:32] need to keep that in perspective that
[36:33] the church has gone through this before
[36:35] by the blood of Jesus Christ and we'll
[36:37] get through this praise God I've never
[36:40] thought you know I've just never thought
[36:41] that the way some people are approaching
[36:43] it like it's the end of the world or
[36:45] I've just never thought that you know it
[36:47] could it could eventually lead to that
[36:49] but we have to keep these things in
[36:52] perspective and recognize that God is
[36:54] still on his throne he's faithful and
[36:56] it's our duty right now is our brother
[36:58] prayed the prayer crest our duty is to
[36:59] be kings and priests right now were to
[37:02] intercede if no one else is gonna do it
[37:04] will intercede for the sinners praise
[37:06] God hallelujah because we know the power
[37:08] of intercession amen so I do have a few
[37:12] quotes or slides here to share by God's
[37:16] grace let's look to the word this
[37:19] morning and trust the Lord will minister
[37:21] to us here by God's grace so Christ the
[37:27] all sufficient sacrifice I'd wanted to
[37:30] preach on all the sacrifices yesterday
[37:33] but then I just felt inspired to preach
[37:35] on
[37:35] the keys to the kingdom the keys of
[37:38] death and hell rather keys of death and
[37:40] hell and really enjoyed the fellowship
[37:42] last night in the Word of God brother
[37:44] man said Jesus Christ fulfilled every
[37:47] sacrifice when he preached the the red
[37:50] heifer and the waters of separation he
[37:53] said from one side to the other typing
[37:55] everything even the waters of separation
[37:57] the red heifer it couldn't be a brown
[38:00] one had to be a red one not a spot on it
[38:02] had to be burned and then made into the
[38:04] waters of separation he said its to
[38:07] sprinkle the people after they had
[38:10] sinned and gone outside the camp how the
[38:14] hyssop and the cedar wood and all mixed
[38:16] in together how the wood and the
[38:17] tabernacle how the brazen altar the
[38:20] Laver the shewbread everything pointed
[38:23] to Christ and in him we are complete in
[38:26] Jesus Christ praise God we know
[38:29] everything pointed to him so I just want
[38:31] to build up I want to start we're
[38:34] looking at these at these three kinds of
[38:36] sacrifices and then I want to finish
[38:37] with the feasts of the Lord we're just
[38:40] gonna revisit the seven feasts of the
[38:42] Lord it's been a while I think I only
[38:43] preached on actually once a year you
[38:44] know and I just caught the revelation
[38:46] today that I need to add the seven
[38:48] feasts of Israel into the current
[38:50] chapter I'm writing right now it's about
[38:51] the two the two people become one the
[38:54] Jew Gentile become one church because
[38:56] that's what happened at Pentecost and so
[38:58] just has just been refreshing revealed
[39:00] to me this morning and that's where that
[39:02] ties in we saw it last night there was a
[39:04] wall of partition between Jew and
[39:05] Gentile Jesus Christ tore down the wall
[39:08] praise God
[39:09] oddly he tore the veil between man and
[39:11] the holiest of holies praise the Lord
[39:13] and here as we'll see later with the
[39:16] Feast of Pentecost he took all these
[39:18] individual grains and baked them into
[39:21] one body praise God amen so we'll see
[39:24] that here
[39:24] I love God's imagery praise God I love
[39:26] what God has done it's a beautiful
[39:28] picture so let's go to Exodus 29 here by
[39:31] God's grace let's go to Exodus 29 verse
[39:33] 38 let's look at the daily sacrifices
[39:37] remember it was through Abraham that God
[39:39] finally decided there's going to be Jew
[39:41] and Gentile right because everybody was
[39:44] just one people but it was that time of
[39:47] Abraham Abraham God's own
[39:49] separate yourself and I'm gonna make of
[39:51] you a kingdom praised God I'm gonna make
[39:54] of you a family to bless all the other
[39:57] families in the earth so starting with
[39:58] Abraham God now has what we would say a
[40:01] group of separated individuals
[40:03] later through Moses he said I'm making
[40:05] you a kingdom of priests praise God
[40:07] natural praise got natural priests and
[40:10] so God with Abraham started focusing on
[40:13] this particular people they became known
[40:15] as Jews Israel later but but here
[40:21] through Moses God makes a kingdom of
[40:23] priests he develops a priesthood and a
[40:26] tabernacle because he wanted this nation
[40:29] to be a peculiar nation amen a peculiar
[40:32] a special nation unto me praise God
[40:35] because he knew you member he saw at the
[40:37] tower Babel he saw all men were still
[40:40] corrupt even after the flood they're
[40:41] still all corrupt so he said I'll I'll
[40:43] have to just choose one family that can
[40:45] be special unto me that I can reveal
[40:47] myself to that will love me and obey me
[40:50] that will be Abraham's seed praise God
[40:53] amen and now we know of course we're a
[40:55] peculiar people by the blood of Jesus
[40:57] Christ amen thank the Lord
[41:00] so Exodus 29 here 38 to 46 just a little
[41:05] reading I like to just spend one more
[41:07] time reading this morning the scriptures
[41:09] and then it just gives us church a
[41:11] beautiful picture of what Jesus Christ
[41:14] has done I've said it here before I
[41:18] think I'll say it again I'm so thankful
[41:19] I'm under the new tongue of the New
[41:21] Testament praise God
[41:22] can you imagine as we read these you
[41:24] imagine the priests having to kill all
[41:26] these animals and their their hands is
[41:28] covered in blood all the time all the
[41:30] time we know they work seven days at a
[41:32] time right and then they take seven off
[41:34] or whatever sometimes 14 days or 30 days
[41:36] the different times of the Old Testament
[41:38] calendar they'd work different shifts
[41:40] but can you imagine just all the blood
[41:42] it was all blood all the time and then
[41:45] during the feast it was even more blood
[41:47] it was just constantly bloody all the
[41:49] time I remember by the time Isaiah comes
[41:51] around David said I'm tired of your
[41:54] sacrifices and he had that great
[41:57] revelation that he read it real to saw
[41:59] King Saul David he said the Lord
[42:02] not delight so much in blood but the
[42:04] Lord delights in obedience praise God
[42:06] amen his obedience comes from the heart
[42:10] amen and that's why Paul said you've
[42:12] obeyed from your heart
[42:14] the gospel that was preached unto you to
[42:17] Haven
[42:18] that's the beauty of the New Testament
[42:20] it's by the heart the heart now serves
[42:23] God amen
[42:24] as we saw last night in the Old
[42:25] Testament they didn't have the fertile
[42:27] ground did they because they just
[42:29] remember years of the sins and a guilty
[42:33] conscience and it could never purge the
[42:35] conscience but now in the New Testament
[42:36] our conscience can be pure we can smile
[42:39] and rejoice and be happy and have the
[42:42] joy of the Lord because we know God has
[42:44] totally done away with our sins amen it
[42:47] could not be done under the blood of
[42:49] bulls and goats but it is done through
[42:51] Jesus Christ amen so we truly do
[42:54] experience and a spiritual experience
[42:57] that they cannot experience because the
[42:59] blood of animals could never purge their
[43:01] conscience but we can have confidence
[43:04] and know that we're forgiven
[43:06] we're accepted not just on earth amongst
[43:09] each other but we're accepted in the
[43:10] beloved praise God we're accepted in
[43:13] heaven because we sit spiritually our
[43:15] souls sit in spiritual places called
[43:18] heavenly places in Christ Jesus amen
[43:20] hallelujah Exodus 29 38 you know with
[43:27] preaching Friday Saracen I just lost

[43:44] God hallelujah now he says now this is

[44:01] offer in the morning and the other lamb
[44:03] thou shall offer it even and with the
[44:05] one lamb a tenth deal flour mingled with
[44:08] the fourth part of a hint of beaten oil
[44:10] and a fourth part of a hint of wine for
[44:13] a drink offering
[44:15] so look you had a a meet offering and
[44:18] then a meal offering right the grain and
[44:20] the flower that was meat that was called
[44:22] a meal offering so God said everyday you
[44:25] have to have a lamb to die and then a
[44:27] bread and then wine praise God
[44:31] I don't know that's that's what we have
[44:34] everyday Bray's God bread and wine

[44:46] of lamb available you only died once but
[44:48] his blood is available to us every day

[44:51] remember Jesus said to Satan don't touch
[44:54] that oil in wine
[44:56] amen praise God Satan can't touch our
[44:59] experience with God that's what God was
[45:02] showing remember he was prefiguring it
[45:04] here natural wine as we had last night
[45:06] in friday natural oil and flour it was a
[45:10] figure of what we experienced today
[45:12] praise God thank the Lord my goodness
[45:16] verse 41 in the other land thou shall
[45:18] offer even shall do thereto according to
[45:20] the meat offering of the morning in the
[45:22] corn to the drink offering thereof for a
[45:23] sweet savour and offering made by fire
[45:25] unto the Lord
[45:27] so there's fire there's oil there's wine
[45:30] there's lamb there's meat there's bread
[45:32] oh what an experience to have with God
[45:35] every day praise God every day these are
[45:38] the blessings are available to you and I
[45:40] and that beautiful he said I'm just
[45:43] trying to show them something he wanted
[45:45] continual fellowship with them and he
[45:48] wanted them to enjoy it praise God
[45:50] Oh verse 42 this shall be a continual
[45:54] burnt offering throughout your
[45:55] generations mine so burnt that means
[45:58] they didn't eat any of that meat so they
[45:59] guess they just ate the bread right they
[46:01] ate the bread and drink the line here he
[46:05] says continue a burnt offering
[46:06] throughout your generations at the door
[46:07] of the tabernacle of the congregation
[46:08] before the Lord where I will meet you to
[46:12] speak there unto thee praise God and
[46:15] there will I meet with the children
[46:17] Israel in the tabernacle shall be
[46:18] sanctified by my glory I will sanctify
[46:21] the tabernacle the congregation and the
[46:23] altar I will sanctify also both Aaron
[46:26] and his sons that Minister me to me in
[46:28] the priests office
[46:29] and I will dwell among the children of
[46:30] Israel and will be their God and they
[46:32] shall know that I am the Lord their God
[46:34] that brought them forth out of the land
[46:36] of Egypt that I may dwell among them I
[46:39] and the Lord their God every morning a
[46:42] lamb died to Oly burnt nothing was left
[46:44] over and they hate they gave a meat
[46:46] offering bread and then wine offering a
[46:49] drink offering every morning praise God
[46:51] and then every evening the same there
[46:53] was wine there's fire there's bread oh
[46:56] it's just it's continual worship unto
[46:58] God every single day they didn't skip
[47:01] any days it was every single day praise
[47:03] God now this is really small
[47:06] let's get past that but see once the
[47:11] consecration of the altar was described
[47:13] it tells us that about the lambs the
[47:15] daily lambs that were going to be
[47:17] offered praise God and he says he's
[47:19] gonna meet with them I like that see he
[47:22] meets with this church when we have the
[47:24] appropriate sacrifices so many people
[47:26] start living a Christian life and they
[47:28] wonder how come I'm not meeting with God
[47:29] anymore are you making the sacrifices
[47:32] right remember Romans 12:1 he said it's
[47:35] your reasonable service present
[47:37] yourselves a living sacrifice unto God
[47:40] that's the reason people get far from
[47:42] God they don't make the continual
[47:44] sacrifices but God said in the Old
[47:46] Testament continue to make these
[47:48] sacrifices and I'll meet with you there
[47:51] praise God amen I'll meet with your
[47:54] daily amen that's right so it has to be
[47:57] a daily sacrifice praise God now let's
[48:02] let's reiterate these personal
[48:04] sacrifices and there were and there's
[48:08] various scriptures about the personal
[48:09] sacrifices was that my fault
[48:14] hmm I didn't know what I was doing there
[48:18] okay forgive me I'm not sure what
[48:20] happened there
[48:21] praise God now there's five Old
[48:24] Testament personal sacrifices now
[48:26] remember the the priests always did
[48:28] those two lambs every single day but
[48:30] then men and women could bring
[48:31] sacrifices to the temple as well for
[48:34] worship there was burnt there was a meal
[48:38] which also called grain peace sin and
[48:44] trespass offering all these were part of
[48:48] the experience so the God had daily
[48:52] worship with with his people the daily
[48:55] sacrifices and then when the occasion
[48:57] called for it the people would fall
[49:00] short and they would want peace with God
[49:02] again praise God
[49:03] they want their sins taken care of amen
[49:06] they had a way to take care of their
[49:09] guilt amen they had a way to take to
[49:12] have a meal with the Lord praise the
[49:14] Lord they had a way to give to show God
[49:18] they're fully devoted to God amen now so
[49:23] let's look at he's the burnt was the the
[49:25] burnt sacrifice is the oldest sacrifice
[49:27] it's from Genesis 8:20 with Noah and
[49:30] this was complete and total submission
[49:33] to God's will see none of this was eaten
[49:37] by anyone because it represented the
[49:40] whole will being sacrificed to God
[49:43] praise the Lord
[49:46] so church whenever there was a moment
[49:48] where the believers one to show I'm
[49:50] fully devoted I'm fully sold out to God
[49:53] they would offer the burnt offering
[49:55] praise God to show that God that I'm not
[49:58] I'm not we're not keeping any of this
[50:00] I'm giving all that I am to you praise
[50:02] God and we know Jesus Christ was the
[50:05] burnt offering praise God
[50:07] he freely gave him himself all of
[50:09] himself because he said not my will but
[50:12] thy will be done he gave all of himself
[50:15] praise God to be a burnt or we say to be
[50:19] sacrifice to the Lord praise God Amen
[50:23] this word actually means burn actually
[50:25] means an offering of a cent that's what
[50:29] it means it was a expressing of total
[50:33] devotion to God
[50:35] the directions are given in Leviticus
[50:37] 1:3 to 17 it could be a bowl and look at
[50:41] this depending on how much money you had
[50:42] you could give a bull or a sheep or goat
[50:45] or a dump or a pigeon isn't God so
[50:48] merciful god could let the poorest
[50:51] person have a total devotion to him
[50:54] praise God amen
[50:56] you give according to what you're able
[50:59] I'll say like this just like Jesus said
[51:01] remember that woman gave the two mites
[51:03] and Jesus said she gave more than all
[51:05] the Pharisees with their thousands of
[51:07] millions of dollars amen because it's
[51:09] always based upon what you have not on
[51:12] the actual amount of what you give and
[51:14] God's saying the same thing here you can
[51:17] be devoted to me whether it's a small
[51:18] thing or whether it's a large thing as
[51:21] long as you give a burnt offering as
[51:23] long as you give full devotion I'll
[51:25] receive it praise God amen thank God
[51:30] hallelujah that's why I'm so thankful
[51:33] Jesus said if you're faithful with the
[51:35] little I'll make you ruler over much
[51:37] praise God we don't have much in this
[51:40] world as far as even our church or we
[51:42] don't have a much compared to lots of
[51:43] people now we're blessed in America no
[51:45] doubt about that tremendously but we
[51:47] might feel like we have little but we
[51:49] must still be fully devoted whenever we
[51:52] have we must give our full devotion to
[51:54] God's Word amen then that way we can
[51:57] express ourselves as being fully devoted
[52:00] to God now we know of course Christ
[52:02] fulfilled all these but we can see how
[52:04] we can see how believers would want to
[52:07] come and bring a burnt offering I hope
[52:08] you come to church like that don't you
[52:10] come to church like that that's what I
[52:11] was thinking some of these you come to
[52:12] church with this feeling you should come
[52:14] to church when you feel guilty you
[52:16] should come to church when you want to
[52:18] have peace and just Thanksgiving with
[52:20] God you should come when I just want to
[52:22] be fully devoted praise God amen I like
[52:25] it because it gives every believer
[52:26] chance I feel sinful will come to the
[52:28] house of God make a sacrifice amen
[52:30] right common approach before God and you
[52:34] know God will receive you amen
[52:36] if he received them under the blood of
[52:38] bulls and goats he'll gladly receive us
[52:40] under a more sufficient blood the blood
[52:42] of Christ amen hallelujah
[52:45] so the meal was grain but it wasn't meat
[52:48] it was flour and then this is also
[52:51] called a food and drink offering and
[52:53] this represented the devotion of the
[52:56] works of your hands to God so you were a
[52:58] farmer in those days right your family
[53:00] farm so it showed that you were devoted
[53:02] with your grains and also with your your
[53:05] vineyards wait for the wine
[53:07] so this was your work and you're coming
[53:10] here to have fellowship with God amen
[53:13] this word means means a great offering
[53:17] here and this was a devotion to God and
[53:20] it recognized his goodness and His
[53:22] Providence
[53:23] so when Israel wanted to show God I'm so
[53:26] thankful you've given me food on my
[53:27] table amen when you you've been so good
[53:31] to me
[53:31] and I want to and another way you can
[53:34] look at it they could bring baked bread
[53:37] they could bring grilled bread or fried
[53:40] bread or roasted bread and it was oh it
[53:44] could be a seasoned that was always
[53:46] seasoned you always had to season it and
[53:49] there was there's no sweetness and no
[53:51] leaven and here a portion of the
[53:56] offering was the root be burnt the rest
[53:58] went for the priests and their meal so
[54:01] this was a time where everybody got part
[54:03] of the meal the priest could eat it the
[54:06] worshiper could eat it and God and
[54:08] they're saying we're gonna fellowship
[54:09] and we're gonna have this communion with
[54:11] God amen
[54:12] we're thankful Lord all you provided
[54:14] because of your provision I've come to
[54:16] recognize that you provided all four for
[54:19] me and for our priesthood and that we
[54:21] want to have continual fellowship with
[54:23] you amen
[54:26] hallelujah and these are instructed to
[54:30] be freewill offerings so these were ones
[54:34] where God where you really saw the ones
[54:36] who really loved the Lord praise God
[54:40] they did whenever it's free whenever
[54:42] it's on your heart come bring a meat on
[54:44] a meal offering unto the Lord come and
[54:46] have fellowship and just come tell God
[54:48] how thankful you are for all that he's
[54:49] provided for you praise God amen thank
[54:53] the Lord I love this because God gave
[54:56] everyone a fair chance God let them live
[54:59] according to the dictates of their heart
[55:00] praise God
[55:02] and however however much in love they
[55:04] were with God God allowed them to
[55:06] express it praise God see this was a
[55:09] mandate and this was whoever would like
[55:10] to come and show me thanks and whoever
[55:13] like they come worship you can come and
[55:15] worship praise God from your heart
[55:17] hallelujah oh thank the Lord thank you
[55:22] thank you Jesus praise God I just have
[55:23] nothing so happy today praise God
[55:25] now have a peace offering the peace
[55:28] offering was expressing your gratitude
[55:30] and thanks to God it was again free will
[55:33] and many times they finished there was
[55:36] the finishing worship of a vow some was
[55:40] given to God someone's given to the
[55:42] priest some of the worshiper and his
[55:45] family this had nothing again to do with
[55:48] sin praise God these were also called
[55:51] Thanksgiving offerings freewill
[55:53] offerings and waive offerings
[55:55] it could be cattle sheep or go according
[55:57] to Leviticus 7 it could be male/female
[56:00] but it must be without defect that's
[56:04] what God wants God wants a pure
[56:06] sacrifice praise God hallelujah if it
[56:10] was Thanksgiving it could also be a
[56:11] variety of breads and the purpose of
[56:14] this was to consecrate a meal between
[56:15] two or more parties before God and share
[56:18] that meal together in fellowship of
[56:20] peace and a commitment to others future
[56:24] prosperity praise God
[56:27] amen so again we see a lot of
[56:30] similarities in the meal and the peace
[56:32] there as far as God recognizing God
[56:36] providing for you and our opportunity to
[56:39] come back and tell the Lord thank you
[56:41] for what he's provided for us amen
[56:43] praise God that's why we seen that song
[56:45] we bring the sacrifice of praise we
[56:47] bring the sacrifice of Thanksgiving into
[56:49] the house of God amen
[56:51] thank the Lord now next
[56:56] in offering now this is for the
[56:59] atonement to purge our sins and many
[57:03] times these are unintentional sins this
[57:07] is expressing our sorrow and desire for
[57:10] fellowship with God and the size
[57:13] mattered based upon the severity of the
[57:15] sin a few could not be eaten but most
[57:20] were eaten by the priests so this is
[57:22] found in Leviticus chapter 4 we're not
[57:24] going to read that of course by just
[57:26] reading over some overviews of it now it
[57:31] contains elements some things were like
[57:33] the burnt offering yet not the same and
[57:36] even elements of the peace offering Wow
[57:39] some of the sins from which one needed
[57:42] atonement were not moral sins but
[57:43] matters of ritual impurities as well
[57:48] some have also called this the
[57:50] purification offering as as long as
[57:52] along with the sin offering praise God
[57:57] so the the purpose is to purify yourself
[57:59] and re-enter the presence of God amen so
[58:04] your unintentional your your your impure
[58:07] you brought a sin offering say Lord I
[58:09] want to re-enter into your fellowship
[58:10] praise God hallelujah so I'm bringing a
[58:14] sin offering before your throne today
[58:17] receive me I want to feel your presence
[58:19] again amen like David said restore to me
[58:22] the joy of my salvation praise God
[58:25] receive it praise God and we know he
[58:27] does now the last one the gill or
[58:30] trespass offering this is for
[58:33] intentional sin and again you're
[58:38] supposed to be sorrowful and these were
[58:40] eaten by the priests this also is
[58:43] translated as a guilt offering this is
[58:46] something that you owe on account of
[58:48] your sins for something you did on
[58:50] purpose also called the trespass
[58:54] offering or the reparation offering all
[58:58] right now sometimes this had a specific
[58:59] monetary value when someone owed another
[59:03] person on account of a debt due to a sin
[59:06] and it could be repaid with silver as
[59:08] well my with or sacrificing of a
[59:11] in addition a 20% fee was added on to it
[59:16] so 20% freeze god so a double tithe can
[59:19] you imagine that when you actually did
[59:21] somebody wrong God made sure you paid
[59:23] extra to cover because you did it on
[59:25] purpose
[59:27] this one was extra expensive to offer
[59:30] think about the time you pay think about
[59:33] what's that number you pay every
[59:34] paycheck when times at times two to go
[59:36] along with the ties you regularly pay
[59:39] that's what God is saying see God is
[59:42] trying to teach them as a schoolmaster
[59:43] sin is awful and there's certain sins
[59:46] that are more awful than others praise
[59:48] God
[59:48] right remember Jesus said because his
[59:53] generation rejected him they'll suffer
[59:55] more than those of Sodom and Gomorrah
[59:57] because a greater than Solomon is here
[59:59] right so there's some sins that were
[1:00:02] greater and God was trying to show them
[1:00:04] by like it - God was showing them
[1:00:07] there's a way back from all sins praise
[1:00:09] God amen
[1:00:11] no matter how awful David did it
[1:00:13] intentionally right he did he he stoled
[1:00:15] Bathsheba had Uriah killed he did it
[1:00:17] intentionally but God made our way back
[1:00:20] amen he always had a way back praise God
[1:00:23] hallelujah as long as they repent humble
[1:00:25] themselves and get and give a sacrifice
[1:00:29] God had a way to receive them because he
[1:00:31] was merciful and loving praise God the
[1:00:35] merciful God thank the Lord so now
[1:00:40] church you can see I'm skipping besties
[1:00:43] because that's what come what I was
[1:00:43] referencing it's so smart it when it
[1:00:45] hurt your eyes now you can see how Jesus
[1:00:47] fulfilled all of these Old Testament
[1:00:49] sacrifices you can clearly see right now
[1:00:53] he had to become our burnt offering he
[1:00:55] saved the game is full well for you and
[1:00:57] I praise God he was our meal offering he
[1:01:02] was our peace offering he was our sin
[1:01:04] offering and he took all of our
[1:01:06] trespasses as well praise God Jesus
[1:01:09] Christ fulfilled every one of these amen
[1:01:13] now you remember this and let's go to
[1:01:16] numbers 31 this is the first time first
[1:01:19] time in a long time I've actually seen
[1:01:20] this in real practice on
[1:01:23] of all those sacrifices I remember those
[1:01:25] are all the sacrifices that we've seen
[1:01:26] the people who just could come and give
[1:01:28] a free will they could come and give a
[1:01:29] sin-offering whenever they wanted to be
[1:01:31] right with God
[1:01:32] but remember there was also a special
[1:01:34] red heifer sacrifice we preached on this
[1:01:37] extensively I believe this is what a
[1:01:39] beautiful revelation for our homes if we
[1:01:42] let sin in our homes and today it's
[1:01:45] usually with TV screens right in
[1:01:46] smartphones and evil books and evil
[1:01:48] magazines if we let that in our home
[1:01:51] it's going to defile our home and that
[1:01:53] destroys everybody spiritual growth it's
[1:01:56] so important for our homes to be a real
[1:01:59] family author of God amen because
[1:02:02] remember even Paul said he said if two
[1:02:04] people are married one save one's that
[1:02:05] he said the believing wife sanctifies
[1:02:08] the husband hallelujah praise God oh the
[1:02:11] believing husband sanctifies the wife
[1:02:13] amen that's the power of the believer
[1:02:16] and just their home the prints of God
[1:02:18] dwelling in that house praise God we had
[1:02:22] one of our children my wife told we've
[1:02:23] had one of our children this week go up
[1:02:25] to my wife and they're talking and and
[1:02:27] they said I really need the Holy Ghost
[1:02:29] amen and we prayed and everything like
[1:02:32] that we'll keep praying but we had a
[1:02:34] child I look that's that's from dwelling
[1:02:36] in our home they can feel the presence
[1:02:39] of God they see some of their
[1:02:40] shortcomings and they can recognize I
[1:02:42] really need to be born again why because
[1:02:45] all the sin all the death is being kept
[1:02:48] out of the house the Friends of God is
[1:02:50] found in the home praise God amen
[1:02:53] I mean even that if the Lord willing if
[1:02:55] I ever get this book done and I go I'm
[1:02:57] next one I do I want to do a family book
[1:02:58] that will be one of the great chapters
[1:03:00] because it's so beautiful outside of all
[1:03:04] the other sacrifices Israel would get
[1:03:06] unclean by touching a dead thing right
[1:03:09] or they let a dead thing coming to their
[1:03:10] home or something would die in their
[1:03:12] home and because of that they had to go
[1:03:16] get purified and remember them to get
[1:03:18] sprinkled on the first day the third day
[1:03:20] and the seventh day and finally after
[1:03:22] the seven day they could come back to
[1:03:24] the temple of God amen oh thank god now
[1:03:27] here I read this this week's number is
[1:03:29] 31 now we're not going to read all this
[1:03:32] this is quite a sobering story I I was
[1:03:36] really sober after
[1:03:37] because Moses you know the God set him
[1:03:43] against the Midianites you know the many
[1:03:44] nights wouldn't let them remember they
[1:03:46] were traveling through the prophetess
[1:03:48] and the many nights would not let them
[1:03:50] stop and eat the food and and the cattle
[1:03:53] have the grass and drink the water and
[1:03:55] so God sent later he sent he sent an
[1:03:57] army to destroy him and he did and this
[1:04:02] is where Balaam was also killed as well
[1:04:04] Batum was killed in this battle because
[1:04:07] he went on the enemy's side he joined
[1:04:09] the enemy side and didn't take the
[1:04:10] commands of God he took the second Word
[1:04:12] of God he took the permissive will of
[1:04:14] God not the perfect will of God and God
[1:04:16] help us to take the perfect will amen
[1:04:20] now I'm gonna skip ahead to the end of
[1:04:22] the chapter so let's go to the end of
[1:04:23] the chapter and I'm sorry it's 2:24 okay
[1:04:28] that's right
[1:04:34] okay I was going
[1:04:36] 19 yeah numbers 31 19 sorry I have
[1:04:38] something confused there 19 and do he
[1:04:42] abide without the camp seven days so
[1:04:45] he's talking now to all the soldiers
[1:04:47] that have come back and they brought
[1:04:49] back a bunch of spoils the Bible says
[1:04:52] and he says stay out seven days
[1:04:54] whosoever hath killed any person who
[1:04:56] sever have touch any slain purify both
[1:04:59] yourselves and your captives on the
[1:05:00] third day and on the seventh day what's
[1:05:02] he talkin about the waters of separation
[1:05:04] verse 26 and purify all your raiment and
[1:05:07] all that is made of skins and all the
[1:05:09] work of goats hair and all things made
[1:05:11] of wood and elli of the leaves of the
[1:05:13] priests and under the men of the war
[1:05:14] which went to the battle this is the
[1:05:16] ordinance of the law which the LORD
[1:05:18] commanded Moses only the gold and the
[1:05:20] silver and the brass and the iron of the
[1:05:21] ten and the lead
[1:05:23] everything that ye that may abide the
[1:05:25] fire he shall make it go through fire
[1:05:27] and it shall be clean never less it
[1:05:30] shall be purified with the water of
[1:05:33] separation amen and all that abide is
[1:05:36] not the fire shall you make go through
[1:05:39] the water
[1:05:39] praise God so God says if whatever we're
[1:05:44] gonna bring in this house amen how many
[1:05:46] of you whenever we're gonna bring this
[1:05:48] church it's got to be first purified
[1:05:50] before the part of the church amen
[1:05:52] how did I tell you thank God he's saying
[1:05:55] if you're bringing these spoils in these
[1:05:57] metals they must be first go through the
[1:06:00] fire and if they make it through the
[1:06:01] fire then they got to go through the
[1:06:02] water praise God
[1:06:04] the washing of water by the word Amen
[1:06:07] thank the Lord so see that's why this
[1:06:10] red heifer was there they had to have
[1:06:12] the ashes burn it mix it with water
[1:06:14] outside the camp and then before
[1:06:16] anything could come into the church it
[1:06:18] had to be sprinkle with the waters of
[1:06:20] separation wait three days make sure
[1:06:22] it's clean sprinkle it bring it back
[1:06:24] four days later on the seventh day
[1:06:25] sprinkle it and then after those seven
[1:06:28] days then they can be declared holy they
[1:06:30] could be purified they could be cleaned
[1:06:33] may God help that to be a lesson to us
[1:06:35] in our families that we will not let
[1:06:37] anything into our families or in our
[1:06:39] homes except it's been purified and we
[1:06:41] know it's right by God's Word now I know
[1:06:44] there's areas of Liberty like we've
[1:06:45] talked about that over the years there's
[1:06:47] areas of Liberty but makes your Liberty
[1:06:49] doesn't
[1:06:50] just humble praise God right so I just
[1:06:54] wanted to show you there's a beautiful
[1:06:55] real example before even metals could
[1:06:58] come into the church they had to be
[1:07:00] sprinkled with the waters of separation
[1:07:02] see that's my brother man said we got to
[1:07:05] be careful what we allow in our homes
[1:07:06] like even clothes right and even toys
[1:07:10] and even things because some of them can
[1:07:12] carry spirits right like I've heard
[1:07:15] different preachers I don't know anyone
[1:07:16] but I've heard different preachers that
[1:07:17] have they've just received like art from
[1:07:20] overseas there are different art and
[1:07:22] they just you know like dragons or you
[1:07:24] know swine or something like that
[1:07:27] evil art they've got a souvenirs or
[1:07:29] people have given them they bring it in
[1:07:31] their home and then they recognize
[1:07:32] there's trouble right because the evil
[1:07:35] spirits they carry spirits right one
[1:07:37] time brother Branham had that well the
[1:07:39] the family that had the child that that
[1:07:42] had the spasms to burn the clothes that
[1:07:44] they had on right and then the devil
[1:07:46] left so see this gives us an idea that
[1:07:50] we have to keep our homes very clean and
[1:07:53] something had to die there's a thank god
[1:07:56] there's a sacrifice to keep our houses
[1:07:58] clean amen thank God there's a way if I
[1:08:01] touch something dead there's a way to
[1:08:03] make me pure again amen a special
[1:08:06] sacrifice a red heifer amen hallelujah
[1:08:09] without blemish praise God died for me
[1:08:13] and I can be sprinkled which we know
[1:08:15] means an anointing right Peter said your
[1:08:17] sprinkle with the blood of Christ just
[1:08:20] like Moses sprinkled the people that
[1:08:22] sprinkle men they join them to the
[1:08:23] Covenant right and when we're sprinkled
[1:08:25] that covenant to renew right then
[1:08:27] anointing comes back upon us praise God
[1:08:29] amen and that's what David that's right
[1:08:32] I know that's what Moses is saying here
[1:08:34] this red sacrifice a red heifer
[1:08:36] sacrifice died so that we could be pure
[1:08:40] again we can be clean again praise God
[1:08:42] for everything else that wasn't covered
[1:08:44] now you've got the red heifer sacrifice
[1:08:46] amen so anyone who contacted the dead
[1:08:50] whether soldiers anyone else they had a
[1:08:53] way to be pure again praise God thank
[1:08:58] the Lord
[1:08:58] now here
[1:09:00] I want to get you I guess I'm not
[1:09:02] watching my time or he's God
[1:09:04] yeah I'm trying not to wear myself out
[1:09:07] after last few days yeah getting getting
[1:09:11] weak gotta get stronger praise God ah
[1:09:14] along with all those sacrifices now we
[1:09:19] come to the feasts and number with the
[1:09:21] feast God told Moses you don't get rid
[1:09:24] of all the other ones when you do this
[1:09:25] you add to it so he said do all this
[1:09:30] besides what you've already done so with
[1:09:34] God it was never all you got a day off
[1:09:36] now you you have to go to church now you
[1:09:38] have to read your Bible now you got a
[1:09:39] day off you know God wasn't doing that
[1:09:41] he was saying I need more devotion if
[1:09:44] you want to stay true if you want my
[1:09:45] presence
[1:09:46] you must stay continually devoted praise
[1:09:48] God amen now there was three annual
[1:09:54] feasts the Bible just calls them
[1:09:57] the unleavened bread the weeks and the
[1:10:00] Tabernacles but we know there's seven
[1:10:02] within the three there's seven within
[1:10:04] the three and remember God told Moses he
[1:10:07] said tell tell the male's three times a
[1:10:09] year those men have to come up to the
[1:10:11] the temple and they have to worship he
[1:10:14] said don't let them come empty praise
[1:10:16] God amen
[1:10:18] don't let anybody come in the church and
[1:10:20] they're just going to come in empty he
[1:10:22] said make sure they're bringing some
[1:10:24] type of sacrifice amen
[1:10:26] make sure they're devoted make sure they
[1:10:28] want to get right with God make sure
[1:10:29] they want to show their appreciation to
[1:10:31] God amen hallelujah he would have they
[1:10:36] said oh if they saw a man say Oh where's
[1:10:38] your sacrifice I'm not bringing any this
[1:10:39] time he said you can't worship if you're
[1:10:42] not willing to sacrifice you can't
[1:10:44] worship right like Jesus said you got a
[1:10:46] worship in spirit and in truth it takes
[1:10:48] a sacrifice our worship always takes a
[1:10:52] sacrifice amen and God said don't come
[1:10:55] empty listen after all God's done for us
[1:10:58] how can we come empty to church praise
[1:11:00] God after all God has done for us saved
[1:11:03] us fill us with the Holy Ghost give us
[1:11:05] blessings and answered our prayers now
[1:11:06] protecting us from the coronavirus how
[1:11:08] can we come here empty we know we come
[1:11:11] bringing a sacrifice of praise
[1:11:13] amen so see on top of these the daily
[1:11:19] personal redheffer now you have the
[1:11:22] feast three times a year these three
[1:11:24] feasts now I'm gonna put this up here a
[1:11:28] visual for you to see the three are the
[1:11:31] Passover in the first month now Moses
[1:11:34] also called it the feast of unleavened
[1:11:36] bread that was in the first month
[1:11:38] usually end of March early April we'll
[1:11:40] just say April ok so April May June
[1:11:44] so Pentecost was the third month in June
[1:11:46] June July August September October
[1:11:50] so Tabernacles October so yeah those
[1:11:54] three
[1:11:57] you have those three feasts and then
[1:11:59] within those you had special days as
[1:12:01] well so the Passover was on the
[1:12:04] fourteenth day of the first month
[1:12:07] unleavened bread was a seven-day feast
[1:12:09] from the fifteenth of 21st here's what
[1:12:12] we're rejoicing in the day the
[1:12:13] firstfruits praise God the sheaf of the
[1:12:16] first fruits on the 18th day of the
[1:12:18] month and then fifty days later was the
[1:12:22] Feast of Pentecost and then four months
[1:12:25] later on the first day the seventh month
[1:12:27] the blowing of trumpets and the tenth
[1:12:29] day the Day of Atonement of the seventh
[1:12:31] month and then the fifteenth through
[1:12:33] 21st was the Feast of Tabernacles how's
[1:12:36] that helped by God's grace I tell you I
[1:12:38] got to review these every couple of
[1:12:40] months because I forget them there's so
[1:12:41] much to remember
[1:12:42] but God has laid these out church and
[1:12:45] let's read now let's go to Leviticus 23
[1:12:48] let's go there let's review these and we
[1:12:50] can see the beauty of what Christ has
[1:12:53] done and we can see where we're living
[1:12:54] at by God's grace and through Paul's
[1:13:02] preaching that's my last point through
[1:13:04] Paul's preaching we can see how there's
[1:13:06] not there's really not a special time of
[1:13:09] the year where we shouldn't be more
[1:13:10] devoted to God our devotion should be
[1:13:12] steady all year Leviticus
[1:13:17] 23 now verses 1 through 3 speak of the
[1:13:23] Sabbath's and the feasts soda speaks of
[1:13:26] the the Sabbath here because he's
[1:13:30] introducing them now to Moses now the
[1:13:33] Passover verses 4 and 5 these are the
[1:13:35] feasts of the Lord even holy
[1:13:37] convocations which he shall proclaim in
[1:13:39] their seasons in the fourteenth day of
[1:13:41] the first month that even is the Lord's
[1:13:44] Passover now we can recall out of those
[1:13:48] things this is a type of the crucifixion
[1:13:51] of Jesus Christ before Moses brought him
[1:13:54] out the night before they left they had
[1:13:56] to kill the lamb in the evening time
[1:13:58] right as Jesus was killed in the evening
[1:14:00] time praise God and there to eat it with
[1:14:03] bitter herbs and they had to be ready to
[1:14:06] travel the next day praise God then to
[1:14:09] be ready to leave because if once they
[1:14:12] ate of the lamb they had to put the
[1:14:14] lambs blood upon the doorpost and the
[1:14:16] lentils amen
[1:14:17] where it is there it is again God
[1:14:19] dealing with every house praise God he
[1:14:22] said a lamb for a house praised I'll say
[1:14:24] like this I've got a lamb for my house
[1:14:26] and you and I we should all have a lamb
[1:14:28] for our houses praise God let me if
[1:14:31] there's a lamb for a house then we got
[1:14:32] to let the Lambs blood come in praise
[1:14:34] God we got let the Lambs blood be
[1:14:36] applied to our house we have to apply
[1:14:38] the Holy Spirit to our lives especially
[1:14:41] our homes amen
[1:14:44] remember that night the Death Angel
[1:14:46] passed over about midnight and anyhow it
[1:14:49] didn't have the blood of lamb the death
[1:14:52] angel took the firstborn and God said
[1:14:56] because I spared all your firstborn he
[1:14:59] said I'm not gonna take your firstborn
[1:15:01] he said I'm gonna take the Levites and
[1:15:02] they're gonna be my ministers praise God
[1:15:04] he said so you'll remember that I spared
[1:15:07] your firstborn amen God is so gracious
[1:15:11] to us praise the Lord so that represents
[1:15:13] the cross of Jesus Christ that Passover
[1:15:17] because
[1:15:19] passed over and anyone under the blood
[1:15:21] was saying praise God anyone not
[1:15:23] everyone on the blood was spared thank
[1:15:26] God that we're spared by the Passover
[1:15:28] sacrifice today are you glad amen glory
[1:15:32] the fourteenth day now here's the one
[1:15:38] verse 6 verses 6 to 8 and on the
[1:15:43] fifteenth day of the same month is the
[1:15:45] feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord
[1:15:47] seven days he must eat the unleavened
[1:15:49] bread and the first day shall have a
[1:15:52] holy convocation you shall do no servile
[1:15:55] work therein but you should offer an
[1:15:58] offering made by fire unto the Lord
[1:16:00] seven days in the seventh day is a holy
[1:16:03] convocation you shall do no servile
[1:16:05] work therein praise God so we know along
[1:16:10] with all the daily sacrifices then to
[1:16:12] sacrifice the lambs at the Passover and
[1:16:15] now here you have the unleavened bread
[1:16:18] which every day you would have you would
[1:16:20] eat the unleavened bread
[1:16:22] now look everybody notice how many days
[1:16:24] was it seven days it's a type of the
[1:16:26] seven Church ages right if you're gonna
[1:16:29] accept the Passover blood of the lamb
[1:16:31] then you got to enter into a time called
[1:16:34] a time of unleavened bread amen where
[1:16:37] you eat God's Word where there's no
[1:16:38] there's no leaven in it oh yeah there's
[1:16:42] no sin in it praise God and this is the
[1:16:45] second part of the first feast the feast
[1:16:48] of unleavened bread and this of course
[1:16:51] represents communion can you imagine
[1:16:54] they're just eatin and there's eating
[1:16:56] the same the bread we had last night the
[1:16:58] same bread just for seven days no leaven
[1:17:00] no leaven no special effects to the
[1:17:02] bread right just unleavened bread
[1:17:04] unleavened bread communion plain humble
[1:17:07] simple pure communion with God Almighty
[1:17:10] that's right
[1:17:12] unleavened this is the second part here
[1:17:17] praise God now next
[1:17:21] is where we are today praise God let's
[1:17:23] go to verse nine amen and the Lord spake
[1:17:27] unto Moses saying speak on the children
[1:17:29] of Israel and say to them when ye come
[1:17:30] into the land which I've given unto you
[1:17:32] and shall reap the harvest thereof then
[1:17:34] he shall bring a sheaf of the first
[1:17:36] fruits of your harvest under the priest
[1:17:39] remember a sheaf was like a handful
[1:17:41] right is a handful of the stalks of
[1:17:45] wheat that had the grain still attached
[1:17:47] to them it's just like a handful and
[1:17:49] they would buy and bundle up together so
[1:17:50] he says bring a handful of the
[1:17:52] firstfruits and he shall wave the sheaf
[1:17:56] before the Lord to be accepted for you
[1:17:59] amen so this sheep was accepted for you
[1:18:02] amen hallelujah even in other words God
[1:18:06] was accepting Jesus Christ for us amen
[1:18:10] oh yeah yeah when Jesus was wave he said
[1:18:13] I'm I'm alive I'm risen he's risen he
[1:18:16] was accepted he was way before all the
[1:18:18] people that because he lives we shall
[1:18:21] live also praise God God accepted him
[1:18:25] God accepted him and raised him and so
[1:18:28] God accepts us and will raise us as well
[1:18:30] amen see it's accepted for you this is
[1:18:36] wave for you so you know the first
[1:18:39] fruits made it and if the first fruits
[1:18:41] made the rest of it is going to make it
[1:18:43] praise God amen and you should offer
[1:18:47] that day when you wave the sheaf and he
[1:18:49] lamb without blemish so see now there's
[1:18:51] another sacrifice right another lamb
[1:18:54] without blemish in the first year for a
[1:18:57] burnt offering see burnt offering so on
[1:19:00] the resurrection we need a total total
[1:19:03] devotion to God oh we don't we need
[1:19:06] today a Friday Christ Fellowship amen
[1:19:08] we need Saints who are fully devoted to
[1:19:11] God all the time amen
[1:19:13] they're not going to hold any area of
[1:19:14] their lives back they're gonna be fully
[1:19:17] devoted and give this offering on the
[1:19:19] day of the resurrection hallelujah thank
[1:19:24] the Lord I love this verse 13 and I get
[1:19:26] some meat and I get some fellowship here
[1:19:28] and the meat offering there shall be two
[1:19:29] tents deals of fine flour mingled with
[1:19:31] oil there's oil oil on the Day of
[1:19:34] Resurrection
[1:19:35] action and offering made by fire unto
[1:19:37] the Lord for a sweet savour and the
[1:19:39] drink offering thereof shall be of wine
[1:19:42] the fourth part of an hints Oh bread oil
[1:19:45] line on this Resurrection Day I love it
[1:19:49] I love it George don't you oh my verse
[1:19:52] 14 and you shall eat neither bread nor
[1:19:54] parched corn nor green ears until the
[1:19:57] self-same day that you have brought an
[1:19:58] offering unto your God
[1:20:01] remember is all unleavened bread right
[1:20:03] 11 bread unleavened bread 11 bread he
[1:20:06] said until you bring this offering you
[1:20:08] won't eat it any of that until you
[1:20:10] fulfill all your vows praise God until
[1:20:11] you feel fulfill all the time praise God
[1:20:16] it should be a statute forever
[1:20:18] throughout your generations in all your
[1:20:20] dwellings so he said forget the corn
[1:20:22] forget the green ears he said first
[1:20:25] bring these offerings and now you can go
[1:20:27] back to that diet that you were on
[1:20:29] before I love the Lord don't you oh my
[1:20:33] showing us these great things in his
[1:20:34] word okay now that was the third
[1:20:40] firstfruits that's where we are today
[1:20:42] so the Passover represents Jesus blood
[1:20:45] the unleavened bread represents
[1:20:47] separation from leaven separation from
[1:20:50] sin and the first fruits represents the
[1:20:53] magnification of Christ in the
[1:20:55] resurrection this magnifies Christ in
[1:20:58] the resurrection and now you had seven
[1:21:01] weeks right
[1:21:02] seven weeks 49 days plus the next one
[1:21:06] was the fiftieth day now you have seven
[1:21:08] weeks you have to wait till June for the
[1:21:10] next feast Pentecost let's read that
[1:21:13] verse 15 now as far as I know this is
[1:21:16] the portion Leviticus 23 that has the
[1:21:19] most information about the Feast of
[1:21:21] Pentecost praise God
[1:21:24] now we know this represents so as we
[1:21:27] read it let's think about the baptism of
[1:21:28] the Holy Ghost or Acts chapter 2 and ye
[1:21:31] shall count unto you from the morrow
[1:21:32] after the Sabbath from the day that you
[1:21:34] brought those chief of the wave offering
[1:21:35] seven Sabbath be complete even under the
[1:21:40] morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall
[1:21:41] ye number fifty days he shall offer a
[1:21:44] new me offering so it's something new
[1:21:46] praise God
[1:21:47] remember me twas
[1:21:48] like chicken or wasn't like lamb it was
[1:21:51] bread so this is a new offering so you
[1:21:54] halfway or three months in this year
[1:21:57] you're gonna bring something new it's
[1:21:59] gonna represent something different
[1:22:01] praise God and you shall bring out of
[1:22:04] your habitations two wave loaves of 2/10
[1:22:07] deals they shall be a fine flower and
[1:22:10] they should be bacon with leaven they
[1:22:13] are firstfruits under the Lord so see
[1:22:16] what's God's showing he's saying there's
[1:22:18] no leaven in Christ there's no leaven in
[1:22:21] his death burial and resurrection
[1:22:23] there's no leaven at all praise God
[1:22:26] but about three months down the road
[1:22:28] there's going to be some leaven in your
[1:22:30] year praise God
[1:22:32] every year you're gonna recognize that
[1:22:34] there's leaven and I love what Schofield
[1:22:36] says I want to read it
[1:22:37] he said observe now to lows not a sheaf
[1:22:41] not a handful like the firstfruits of
[1:22:43] separate grouse loosely browned together
[1:22:46] right that's where the that's what this
[1:22:47] was they're loosely bound together all
[1:22:50] these stocks you know it's just a
[1:22:51] handful of there's a sheaf there of the
[1:22:54] of the stocks but now they're not all
[1:22:57] separate now they're all one he says not
[1:23:02] a separate growth but a real union of
[1:23:05] particles making one homogeneous body
[1:23:10] praise God even so on the day of the day
[1:23:14] of firstfruits it was all separated
[1:23:15] right everybody was still separated but
[1:23:18] three months later God says now you're
[1:23:21] not all separate now you're one praise
[1:23:23] God
[1:23:23] now those two lows represent remember
[1:23:26] that I believe the Jew and Gentile
[1:23:29] they represent the former rain latter
[1:23:31] rain you can represent the off the alpha
[1:23:35] bride and the Omega bride praise God
[1:23:36] they can all they can all be represented
[1:23:39] there because you have to male female
[1:23:41] praise God right beginning and end God
[1:23:45] is the beginning and end of the Gentile
[1:23:46] dispensation and sin leaven represents
[1:23:50] sin so this represents the Gentile
[1:23:52] dispensation now God is going to have
[1:23:54] there's going to be bread there's gonna
[1:23:56] be unity but there's gonna be eleven
[1:23:57] amongst unity right
[1:24:01] as much as I love each one of you as
[1:24:04] much as you love me I still see some
[1:24:05] leaven sometimes Church right as much as
[1:24:09] I love Hosea
[1:24:10] much as Hosea we love each other
[1:24:11] sometimes I fall short of God's glory
[1:24:14] you see leaven in it but church that if
[1:24:17] the leaven is confessed let's be honest
[1:24:19] let's confess we have leaven let's not
[1:24:21] lose the unity let's keep the unity that
[1:24:25] God wants us to have as a loof unto God
[1:24:27] praise God not loosely but United were
[1:24:30] united under one mater under one faith
[1:24:33] one spirit the Holy Spirit so he must
[1:24:37] exist with one another despite the
[1:24:39] leaven we must stay unified as
[1:24:41] Christians hallelujah
[1:24:44] and he said wave them this is accepted
[1:24:48] for you praise God this is accepted for
[1:24:50] you this is what God is waving before
[1:24:53] the people were united now praise God we
[1:24:57] had the firstfruits we saw the rest of
[1:24:59] it's going to come to harvest in other
[1:25:00] words there's going to be bread now let
[1:25:02] me say like this there's gonna be bread
[1:25:04] for four months there's gonna be bread
[1:25:05] for two thousand years Amen it's gonna
[1:25:09] be a long season that we get to the end
[1:25:10] of the the the religious year now you're
[1:25:14] gonna have bread for these two thousand
[1:25:16] years I'm glad we got bread today praise
[1:25:18] God the Bible said there's a famine
[1:25:20] right now in almost every church but
[1:25:22] we've got the fresh bread of God amen
[1:25:24] thank God
[1:25:25] the fresh revelations of God's Word amen
[1:25:28] we are witnesses that this feast is a
[1:25:31] reality and it's being fulfilled and
[1:25:34] there's still bread today amen
[1:25:37] like Simon prayed and even I talked to
[1:25:40] Mike McCluskey yesterday the man who was
[1:25:41] in the wheelchair I talked to him
[1:25:42] yesterday
[1:25:43] just like he prayed he was at his wits
[1:25:45] end he's like he's like they're saying
[1:25:47] like this there's no bread in these
[1:25:48] denomination churches send me the truth
[1:25:50] and a few days later brother Jose Simon
[1:25:53] comes up said you need help with your
[1:25:54] plumbing he said I need more than that
[1:25:57] he said I need a Bible study praise God
[1:25:59] amen that was Simon's testimony to
[1:26:02] remember he prayed for three months in
[1:26:04] the closet send me the truth there's no
[1:26:06] truth in these denominations there's no
[1:26:08] fresh bread it was all rotting out they
[1:26:11] meant it had
[1:26:12] hotels in the right the old manner but
[1:26:14] we need fresh bread and God's obligated
[1:26:16] if we ask for god's obligating to send
[1:26:19] it because it's the season of pentecost
[1:26:21] it's the season of weeks it's time for
[1:26:24] bread hallelujah
[1:26:25] amen thank the Lord and this represent
[1:26:30] out the pouring of the Holy Spirit the
[1:26:34] firstfruits of raised there way before
[1:26:36] the people just wait a little bit longer
[1:26:38] and now the people are gonna be united
[1:26:40] it's one bread and Paul says that we are
[1:26:44] one bread Paul says that in Ephesians so
[1:26:48] I love this now program calls it a long
[1:26:51] hot season of Pentecost it's long C
[1:26:55] third fourth fifth six four months long
[1:26:58] it's a long hot church age right
[1:27:03] but it's the season that we're in and
[1:27:06] let me read that to you just so you know
[1:27:07] this is prophetically where we are right
[1:27:10] now we are so close to the blowing of
[1:27:12] the trumpets but let me read you the
[1:27:16] quote so you can see that
[1:27:17] oh I'm far behind ya recognizing your
[1:27:21] day listen to this morning but BAM said
[1:27:23] we have been going through that long
[1:27:25] Feast of Pentecost he says at numerous
[1:27:29] times we are in the prophetic season of
[1:27:32] Pentecost the program talks about the
[1:27:36] Jews being scattered and how all the
[1:27:37] trumpets sound under the sixth seal and
[1:27:39] they says where we've been 2,000 years
[1:27:43] in the Pentecostal feast he says it
[1:27:48] again Feast of Trumpets now this is
[1:27:51] beautiful here one of these was really
[1:27:53] beautiful he noticed the scripture
[1:27:57] the long period of Pentecost which
[1:27:59] Israel did reject back there see they
[1:28:00] rejected it he called the Gentile church
[1:28:02] out through this Pentecostal feasts how
[1:28:04] many understand what the Pentecostal
[1:28:06] faeces it's the first fruit of the
[1:28:07] harvest it's dipped first through the
[1:28:09] resurrection the Pentecostal feast don't
[1:28:11] miss his people and you on tape listen
[1:28:13] close this has been the time of the
[1:28:16] pentecost feast the Jews laid silent
[1:28:18] they rejected it now they've got to be
[1:28:20] called back to the atonement we know who
[1:28:23] the toment was they didn't and the
[1:28:25] trumpets sound after the jubilee or
[1:28:27] Pentecost was jubilee cause the Jews
[1:28:29] together the church said one more the
[1:28:32] one more yep one more now he said now
[1:28:35] years ago he was a good one I like this
[1:28:37] well the foolish version be saved no
[1:28:39] they start about saved from the
[1:28:41] tribulation they got to go through the
[1:28:42] tribulation they will be saved their
[1:28:44] souls being saved but they'll have to
[1:28:45] die during the tribulation whatever
[1:28:48] she happens now after that time she's in
[1:28:51] the state now she will have to go
[1:28:52] through the Tribulation Period and the
[1:28:54] reason of it is is because she's
[1:28:55] rejected the atonement in its fullness
[1:28:59] all right so let me go back to that one
[1:29:02] here she's rejected that atonement in
[1:29:04] its fullness now we know the day of
[1:29:08] atonement is later for the Jews but see
[1:29:10] our atonement was made right here praise
[1:29:12] God our atonement our blood was shed
[1:29:16] right there
[1:29:16] we're in the process of the the the
[1:29:20] religious calendar right we're in the
[1:29:22] season of God's prophetic prophetic
[1:29:24] feasts and we have the atonement praise
[1:29:27] God amen we've recognized the Passover
[1:29:30] lamb we are eating the unleavened bread
[1:29:33] and that's what is church most churches
[1:29:35] are not eating unleavened bread most
[1:29:37] churches are eating leavened bread right
[1:29:39] now you slip in oh it's okay to marry
[1:29:42] two three times they it's over they slip
[1:29:44] in that leaven Oh God three persons pray
[1:29:48] to that one and and bow to that one and
[1:29:49] then do that to that one now that one
[1:29:51] doesn't hear anymore it's 11 it's 11
[1:29:55] next in so how are they ever going to
[1:29:57] get to the resurrection when they when
[1:30:00] they did haven't even got here they
[1:30:03] haven't even recognized that once you
[1:30:05] get saved you got to get sanctified amen
[1:30:08] hallelujah
[1:30:11] ah I know right where I'm sitting
[1:30:12] tonight where today by God's grace amen
[1:30:15] they have not really been they're not
[1:30:16] even eating unleavened bread there's a
[1:30:19] lot of message churches that are eating
[1:30:20] unleavened bread too as soon as they let
[1:30:24] leaven in there they've broken this and
[1:30:26] they don't move on this is why they'll
[1:30:29] never get here to get born again they
[1:30:31] don't live long enough they gotta live
[1:30:33] seven Church ages they got live they got
[1:30:36] a little distance they got to keep going
[1:30:38] in the sanctification praise God they
[1:30:41] got to live long enough to get all the
[1:30:43] live in all their lives and then they
[1:30:44] can have a Pentecost and then they can
[1:30:48] see the resurrected Christ
[1:30:50] thank God amen then they could have
[1:30:54] their own resurrection praise God this
[1:30:56] is why church that's why I was saying
[1:30:57] earlier see the foolish version they're
[1:30:59] not a lot of them already even preaching
[1:31:01] unleavened bread they're giving out dead
[1:31:03] you know dead Wiggly rotting bread we'd
[1:31:05] say every now and then you know we'll
[1:31:10] buy that well bye-bye the Aldi bread my
[1:31:13] wife makes homemade bread but I'll buy
[1:31:15] the Aldi bread the organic and if I'm a
[1:31:18] little busy during the week I don't get
[1:31:19] a chance to eat the bread I'll come down
[1:31:20] open up and I'll see white all over the
[1:31:22] bottom of it like oh can i spare it can
[1:31:25] i save any pieces no you can't save it
[1:31:29] but if you just leave it sit there or do
[1:31:31] it it's not finished and you lose track
[1:31:34] of it it just automatically becomes
[1:31:36] moldy that's what happened to people you
[1:31:39] give them the word you give them water
[1:31:40] baptism in Jesus name they'll have it
[1:31:42] they'll be excited for a while but if
[1:31:43] they don't keep eating on the bread the
[1:31:46] rest of its just gonna get old and
[1:31:48] disgusting now they're not interested in
[1:31:50] it anymore they don't like to hear
[1:31:52] preaching about baptism in the name of
[1:31:54] Jesus Christ they don't want to hear
[1:31:55] preaching about the cross they don't
[1:31:57] want to hear that why because laven has
[1:32:00] entered in and it's defiling the bread
[1:32:04] so that statement brother man makes is
[1:32:06] true the foolish virgin is still eating
[1:32:09] bread that's got leaven in it
[1:32:11] so how they ever going to experience the
[1:32:13] real resurrected Christ and then go to
[1:32:15] Pentecost themselves and get the Holy
[1:32:17] Ghost my praise God all right
[1:32:24] now let's go back to the Leviticus 23
[1:32:26] here lo will try to finish up here I
[1:32:28] want to read this whole chapter but I'm
[1:32:30] seeing work kind of short on time here
[1:32:34] now look at this verse look at 18 I need
[1:32:38] to offer with this bread seven lambs
[1:32:40] without blemish of the first year and
[1:32:42] one young Bullock and two Rams look at
[1:32:45] that seven eight nine ten ten offerings
[1:32:47] they shall be for a burnt offering my
[1:32:50] unto the Lord there it is again Watchers
[1:32:52] oh my what a revelation
[1:32:54] what's God asking for from us in this
[1:32:56] Pentecost full devotion complete burnt
[1:33:00] offerings amen how do you praise God
[1:33:06] unto the Lord with their meat offering
[1:33:09] drink offering even offering made by
[1:33:11] fire of sweet savour unto the Lord
[1:33:15] then you shall sacrifice one kid of the
[1:33:18] goats for a while there's even a sin
[1:33:19] offering and two lambs of the first year
[1:33:22] for a sacrifice of peace offerings and
[1:33:24] the priests shall wave them with the
[1:33:25] bread of the firstfruits Wow
[1:33:27] for a wave offering before the Lord with
[1:33:30] the two lambs they shall be holy to the
[1:33:33] Lord for the priests so the priests got
[1:33:36] to eat on that as well I just know I
[1:33:38] didn't check that and catch that right
[1:33:40] there verse 20 the other offerings get
[1:33:44] waved with the bread of the firstfruits
[1:33:47] that's the two loaves before the Lord
[1:33:51] with the two lambs they shall be holy to
[1:33:54] the Lord for the priests praise God so
[1:33:59] look at this look there's a lot more
[1:34:01] sacrificed Church under this Pentecostal
[1:34:04] feast right there's a lot more
[1:34:06] sacrifices how many are willing to
[1:34:08] sacrifice more for God praise the Lord
[1:34:12] hallelujah now verse 22 and when you
[1:34:17] reap the harvest of your land thou shalt
[1:34:19] not make clean riddance of the corners
[1:34:21] of thy field when thou reposts neither
[1:34:22] shalt thou gather any gleaning of the
[1:34:24] harvest thou shalt leave them under the
[1:34:26] poor and the stranger I am the Lord your
[1:34:29] God so he tells them at the end of this
[1:34:30] make sure there's a little gleaning left
[1:34:33] that's what's happening right now
[1:34:35] there's a little bit of gleaning left
[1:34:36] right
[1:34:37] gleaning a soul here gleaning a soul
[1:34:38] there meeting a soul there praise God
[1:34:41] amen
[1:34:42] now finishing up let me just finish this
[1:34:45] here it's a good review by God's grace
[1:34:50] now next is the trumpets the blowing of
[1:34:53] the trumpets now I agree with this
[1:34:55] these are historically fulfilled the
[1:34:57] Passover 11 bread sheaf of firstfruits
[1:35:00] Pentecost the next thing on God's
[1:35:03] prophetic calendar is the blowing of
[1:35:05] trumpets to gather Israel together
[1:35:07] praise God
[1:35:10] after that is the Day of Atonement and
[1:35:13] we know that's when all the sin of
[1:35:16] everyone was washed away everyone in the
[1:35:20] entire camp that's when the sin was
[1:35:22] washed away everything was forgiven at
[1:35:24] that moment praise God and then the last
[1:35:29] was Tabernacles that of course
[1:35:31] represents dwelling in houses right
[1:35:33] temporary houses that represents the
[1:35:35] Millennium praise God so from the cross
[1:35:38] of Jesus Christ to the Millennium we
[1:35:41] must go through these seven feasts and
[1:35:43] right now we're on number four praise
[1:35:45] God is it interesting the fourth seal as
[1:35:48] well we're under the fourth seal right
[1:35:50] now as well not the fifth and not the
[1:35:52] sixth not the seventh we're under the
[1:35:54] fourth seal right now as well let's
[1:35:56] stand to our feet praise God I'll stop
[1:35:58] right there
[1:35:58] and go one more scripture first
[1:36:00] Corinthians five let's yeah that's right
[1:36:01] I want to close with that now this is
[1:36:04] something I'm I'm very honest I'm
[1:36:06] growing in this understanding because
[1:36:10] right now and I'll put it on the screen
[1:36:12] so you can see it right now there is
[1:36:14] spiritual observance of these feasts
[1:36:17] Paul says it that's why it's not just
[1:36:21] Holy Week from April whatever
[1:36:24] April 9th to the 12th it's not just Holy
[1:36:27] Week it's continual Holy Week because
[1:36:31] that's what Paul says in 1st Corinthians
[1:36:33] 5 1 to 8 now you know the story a man
[1:36:35] was sleeping with his stepmother and
[1:36:39] Paul says you're not even morning if
[1:36:41] your sin doesn't make you feel bad
[1:36:43] something's wrong if you still cuss and
[1:36:46] you don't feel bad something's wrong
[1:36:48] with you with your life if you
[1:36:50] watch dirty movies and anything and you
[1:36:53] don't feel bad something's wrong with
[1:36:54] your life if you can tear down
[1:36:57] somebody's character and put them in
[1:37:00] hell something's wrong with your life
[1:37:02] any sin any leaven we're under the feast
[1:37:08] the ball says we're still under the
[1:37:10] feast of unleavened bread and Passover
[1:37:12] he shows it right here
[1:37:13] first Corinthians 5 verse 2 and he are
[1:37:29] puffed up and have not rather mourned so
[1:37:32] see now you know what leaven is in a
[1:37:33] church leaveners churches people that do
[1:37:36] not mourn for their sin they don't feel
[1:37:38] bad about it they'll come here sermon
[1:37:40] they'll get their sins preached on and
[1:37:42] they won't feel bad about it they'll
[1:37:43] just go right out there and Paul said
[1:37:45] that is leaven leavens enters in the
[1:37:48] church that ye have done this deed might
[1:37:53] be taken away from among you that's my
[1:37:56] prayer anybody that's gonna live in sin
[1:37:57] God taking them out of our church okay
[1:38:00] how small we get I don't care how big we
[1:38:01] get we don't want sin among us cuz it'll
[1:38:03] destroy us it starts with one person
[1:38:06] right the worst thing is when it's in
[1:38:08] the pastor that's why I got to keep my
[1:38:10] life right because he's the one giving
[1:38:12] the word he's the one giving the word
[1:38:14] and so if he's got letter in his life
[1:38:17] it'll jump to the next person then the
[1:38:19] next it'll just keep growing it grows
[1:38:21] slowly and Paul says that's when a
[1:38:24] church is puffed up when sin is not
[1:38:26] mourned over see how important it is for
[1:38:30] us to keep sin out of our lives every
[1:38:32] single service is an opportunity to
[1:38:35] bring a sacrifice in offering Hey raise
[1:38:38] God hey man thank God amen whether it's
[1:38:41] a trespass or sin every service is a
[1:38:44] chance for us to keep the lemon out of
[1:38:45] our church he said
[1:38:51] there or not he says you know how I
[1:38:52] judge he said take that brother and
[1:38:54] deliver him to Satan in verse five
[1:38:59] number six and your glorying is not good
[1:39:02] no you not that a little leaven love it
[1:39:03] leaveneth the whole lump they were glory
[1:39:06] about it they were laughing about it he
[1:39:12] says that destroys the whole church let
[1:39:16] me give it just a real thing a real
[1:39:18] story there's a married couple I had uh
[1:39:21] I counseled years and years ago I got to
[1:39:26] know him pretty good counseled them you
[1:39:28] know before they got married a little
[1:39:30] bit after they got married not to our
[1:39:31] church and I didn't know it but later
[1:39:33] they the husbands started introducing
[1:39:36] pornography into the marriage he got he
[1:39:40] tried to started convincing his wife to
[1:39:42] do it to watch it and then church that
[1:39:46] spread very small he pretty soon they
[1:39:48] started missing church pretty soon that
[1:39:50] woman started wearing high heels yes she
[1:39:53] had long skirts on and pretty soon her
[1:39:56] clothes got tighter and tighter and
[1:39:58] tighter and pretty soon they had a fight
[1:40:01] and now they stand divorced today
[1:40:05] because and you think what did it just
[1:40:07] one little a few minutes on the cell
[1:40:09] phone watching the evil thing and now
[1:40:12] the children now they got boys and girls
[1:40:14] now the boys not not that I'm not being
[1:40:17] critical but they wear shorts and and
[1:40:18] the girls wear just one small little
[1:40:21] thing if not taking care of they weren't
[1:40:23] warning over it sin must be more no sin
[1:40:27] must be addressed it's going to spread
[1:40:31] and we've got to keep it out of our
[1:40:33] families praise God and
[1:40:40] now their divorce struggling financially
[1:40:41] I mean all these other problems all
[1:40:43] because they compromised on one thing
[1:40:49] what is it Church leaven because you say
[1:40:52] well we don't know any message people
[1:40:53] that sleep with their mother-in-laws and
[1:40:55] it doesn't matter as long as they have
[1:40:57] any evil fantasies or any little desires
[1:41:00] or lusts that are evil they don't even
[1:41:02] have to do it jesus said you're guilty
[1:41:04] just by looking praise God and then it
[1:41:11] grows and grows silently till it
[1:41:13] destroys and consumes the whole family
[1:41:15] and that sister I've heard her speak in
[1:41:19] tongues I've heard her prophecy or
[1:41:21] prophesy I've seen her pray for people
[1:41:24] and God come down and give them
[1:41:25] experiences and shout and scream and
[1:41:27] praise the Lord
[1:41:31] and now divorce and wears pants all the
[1:41:34] time and living with different men all
[1:41:36] kinds of things that used to belong to
[1:41:37] the message so see it's just not like
[1:41:41] doing the physical act it's letting
[1:41:43] anything contrary to God's Word into our
[1:41:46] homes now was he saying verse 7 purge
[1:41:50] out therefore the old leaven that ye may
[1:41:53] be a new lump that's why but Eamon and I
[1:41:55] were talking about it we talked about
[1:41:56] before brother Jose when when sometimes
[1:41:58] when people leave or things things get
[1:42:00] confessed we can feel like a brand new
[1:42:01] church amen any time sins out it's like
[1:42:05] it's a brand new church amen
[1:42:08] yeah it's a new love Abdo praise got a
[1:42:12] new lump of flour ain't my head ready to
[1:42:14] be full and then baked and united as one
[1:42:17] body praise God hallelujah as ye are
[1:42:22] unleavened
[1:42:24] that means we mourn over sin we're sorry
[1:42:27] God forgive me help me to overcome for
[1:42:29] even Christ our Passover is sacrificed
[1:42:33] for us so now Paul saying because we
[1:42:36] have a Passover sacrifice we can find
[1:42:39] forgiveness so he's saying we're still
[1:42:42] in the Passover right the Passover
[1:42:46] effects are still lasting hey amen
[1:42:48] praise God
[1:42:50] and then verse eight therefore let us
[1:42:54] the feast what the Passover Feast with
[1:43:00] so I lost my place let us therefore keep
[1:43:02] the peace not with the old leaven
[1:43:04] neither with the leaven of malice and
[1:43:06] wickedness but with the unleavened bread
[1:43:08] of sincerity and truth hey Church this
[1:43:13] is why we always have Holy Week
[1:43:15] musicians you can come this is why we
[1:43:17] always purge leaven from our lives our
[1:43:20] houses and our church now there's
[1:43:27] something to theirs I'm making this
[1:43:29] later if the Lord opens up perhaps for
[1:43:31] those a we've already heard the trumpet
[1:43:32] of the gospel
[1:43:33] I remember this happens after we're born
[1:43:35] again so I believe there's more
[1:43:36] revelation in here you can be born again
[1:43:39] and then hear trumpets to gather you
[1:43:41] somewhere to see the feast of atonement
[1:43:43] and then I don't know how it works out I
[1:43:46] don't know other maybe Tabernacles is
[1:43:47] crossing over to the new body I don't
[1:43:49] know but bro man said they haven't
[1:43:52] accepted the atonement and we see Paul
[1:43:56] says we must accept the Passover lamb we
[1:43:59] must eat unleavened bread you know why
[1:44:06] because the Saints shall judge the earth
[1:44:10] they're the only ones that will keep the
[1:44:12] feasts there are the only ones that will
[1:44:14] keep out all the leaven and so God uses
[1:44:16] those that keep the Feast to be judges
[1:44:19] at the end a praise God
[1:44:31] it's a long feast this Pentecostal feast
[1:44:35] is a long feast sometimes seem like when
[1:44:40] is this gonna end
[1:44:41] what is this hot hard difficult battles
[1:44:44] gonna end you don't know but there's got
[1:44:47] to be bleeding right at the end time
[1:44:48] praise God and we where we see the
[1:44:50] gleaning happening where no we're really
[1:44:52] close to those two trumpets Moses and
[1:44:55] Elijah blowing out the trumpets praise
[1:44:57] God where you won't see that from here
[1:44:59] Lord willing we'll see it from heaven
[1:45:02] but those two trumpets will blow gather
[1:45:04] Israel so they can be forgiven by Jesus
[1:45:07] Christ the fountain open the house of
[1:45:09] David that will lead us all into God's
[1:45:12] Millennium
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:16] how many would our heads here how many
[1:45:18] to say lord help me to give or help me
[1:45:21] to accept your sacrifices and help me to

[1:46:30] and know that you've forever perfected
[1:46:33] them that are sanctified now at all we
[1:46:37] look at our sacrifice are we sacrificing
[1:46:40] what we're called to give up
[1:46:43] help us Lord God help us just to eat the
[1:46:48] unleavened bread help us not to laugh at
