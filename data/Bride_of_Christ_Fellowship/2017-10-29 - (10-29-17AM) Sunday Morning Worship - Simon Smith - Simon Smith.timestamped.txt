[45:29] this time I think I got a lot more power
[45:34] granny actually procrastinating

[46:48] once to get there by God's grace I guess
[46:53] it's all your reading that it did you'd
[46:56] be the first to return confronted him by
[47:35] God's grace this one took actually a lot
[47:37] more faith than the other ones
[47:39] I waited for three months for brother
[47:44] not to make a decision I'm going to go
[47:46] back he gave me the dates
[47:47] for the Randi in Texas found me a cheap
[47:50] ticket

[47:57] had a dream this is I'm not going so
[48:05] I've already got this ticket sitting
[48:07] there and I had no idea what to do I'm
[48:10] like well if you're not going I don't
[48:14] enjoy traveling when I was pretty much
[48:20] gonna go sister Esther who was our
[48:25] interpreter of the first trip came as
[48:27] Dane was us for 10 days at her house she
[48:29] caught wind that I wasn't going and she
[48:31] called the missionary heard the message
[48:35] that she interpreted message and brought
[48:37] hurry and he text me and said no we need
[48:41] you please calm well and then he had me
[48:43] to rearrange the dates and that's how
[48:46] this all numbers 12 this is kind of
[48:53] where my mind set my up press process
[48:56] was on as I went this fine Hebrews 5:12
[49:02] says for Wednesday for when for the time
[49:08] when you ought to be teachers we have
[49:10] need that one teach you again which be
[49:13] the first principles of the Oracles of
[49:15] God and our become such as have need of
[49:19] milk and not of strong meat so you might
[49:23] my intention servicer was to grace a
[49:26] little bit of meat but obviously they
[49:29] needed the milk more in verse 13 says
[49:33] for for everyone that it uses milk is
[49:35] unskillful in the word of righteousness
[49:37] of faith but strong meat belongeth to
[49:40] them that are foliage even though it by
[49:43] reason who my reason of use have their
[49:45] senses exercised which are both good
[49:48] so let's bow our heads with amen you're
[49:52] a father aren't you this lonely just
[49:53] love you Lord we thank you for getting
[49:56] everyone here see God lower north
[49:58] they're still standing guard this this
[50:01] work the word you said in this day Lord
[50:05] God they have not left to went back to
[50:07] the denominational in this evil evil
[50:17] food the fresh man of the fresh kill of
[50:20] our day and that's what we feasting on
[50:22] every day voice what we're resting on
[50:25] board that this meat is strong enough to
[50:27] give us strengthen our ego Whedon's
[50:29] godless and lure that we can start
[50:31] laughing don't worry when you start
[50:33] stirring this nest like you have been
[50:35] lording when it's time to make this my
[50:37] door will be ready to fly with glory on

[50:45] God and we're going to hold to these
[50:47] things you've given us of the son of
[50:51] Jesus Christ that's just a little
[50:55] personal here of God Lord showing what

[55:39] all the stuffs of the walls the drywall
[55:43] is coming in the drywall on it bathroom
[55:47] and at breaktime musical right wall
[55:50] sometimes about where to lay down for
[55:52] this
[55:52] this bit felt like late on drywall so
[55:55] hard so it took me about three nights to
[55:57] get used to it very hard so this
[56:07] Thursday and what they all kind of
[56:13] things much a new era Church a little
[56:18] imitation sister so they started to
[56:24] worship I'm sue back there thanks to God
[56:27] the main purpose of InFocus is it
[56:29] matches
[56:30] what else is there you want if you don't
[56:34] want to do too much you don't want to
[56:35] feed over feed them you don't know how
[56:37] this resume the same time I may never
[56:39] ever get a chance of well by the grace
[56:42] of God he got on me to get into these
[56:43] churches on the radar share the Word of
[56:47] God and that's what we're doing I said
[56:51] brother Luke are you sure you don't want
[56:52] to preach he's a noble of you
[56:54] you okay so he goes up he does a little
[56:57] introduction for me by God's grace he's
[57:01] to be just greeting the people he says
[57:03] made about a missionary company from
[57:05] assignment uh so then I picked up what I
[57:09] thought would be a good thing
[57:10] and since of God I started teaching
[57:12] remember that burial study I on this
[57:16] trip I used every angle I could to teach
[57:20] math every kind of this way that way
[57:24] from this rate from underneath from
[57:28] every kind of way he'll not only just
[57:30] hit the people but to get rid of loop in
[57:32] he's never even brother Lou Gramm was
[57:35] blown away by these teachers he's never
[57:39] sat under a teacher to go verse by verse
[57:44] by verse all right he's a preacher he is
[57:50] a real inspirational preacher he goes up
[57:53] there and doesn't eat dogs he just
[57:55] starts preaching but he's never sat
[57:58] under a teaching ministry
[57:59] thanks God not to brag or anything you
[58:01] know you know what little I do but
[58:03] little my gift is he was blown away just
[58:05] by that just by a tiny little Ohio
[58:10] teacher right he was he would sit on his
[58:13] little he's got a little tablet and as
[58:16] I'm teaching he would he would type
[58:18] everything all my studies together and
[58:20] then he'd send about twelve Springs like
[58:22] listen to this a lot and he was so blown
[58:24] away by the teachers he was sending it
[58:26] all over the world Wallace process so
[58:30] we're able to teach this
[58:31] the pastor's daughter right there nice
[58:34] some lady she married her husband was
[58:37] actually Wow sit in the back there he
[58:40] saw as he was taking the song speak
[58:42] English so did that wonderful boys miss
[58:44] me so as I'm teaching have a look at her
[58:47] say the words say the word look at her
[58:49] and her eyes I was just leaving
[59:00] you know the climax to the end so she
[59:13] was really touched by the Word of God
[59:16] and sinks of God I did that
[59:19] touch the difference between father son
[59:22] Holy Ghost I didn't question
[59:24] I just went Lord Jesus Christ as Lord
[59:27] Jesus Christ did not disagree they were
[59:40] so blessed I guarantee I'll have another
[59:42] bite the daughter was so blown away that
[59:48] afterwards she came up to me like I got
[59:50] like a magnet it said no what no what no
[59:57] what do you think on the speaking in
[59:58] tongues dish Levites only goes she was
[1:00:04] trying to take it back I said only
[1:00:05] there's five times they spread the
[1:00:07] tongue sorry there's five times where
[1:00:09] the Holy Ghost falls in our backs yes
[1:00:11] only three and not make it in initial
[1:00:16] evidence you cannot make it an absolute
[1:00:19] so she had many questions for me
[1:00:22] afterwards because she's seen Saints God
[1:00:24] the things we know the things we've been
[1:00:26] taught it's brand-new what we played 15
[1:00:33] years ago to us
[1:00:37] something fresh from what I've seen
[1:00:40] Italian all they teach jesus loves me
[1:00:45] grace and mercy prosperity back
[1:00:54] celebration and if you study what we
[1:00:57] read in Hebrews 5 and 6 when I start out
[1:01:00] with they are not even pause the very
[1:01:03] milk foundation it's not even funny
[1:01:07] everything but really really good here
[1:01:12] glory the very next day was like to
[1:01:22] Pattaya
[1:01:23] well they say patio which is a two hour
[1:01:26] drive itself this is one that's like a
[1:01:29] vacation resort town over there we
[1:01:31] actually drove there the first trip and
[1:01:33] got to meet this pastor he used to be at
[1:01:43] the Embassy in South Africa that's how
[1:01:45] you met as one very intelligent very
[1:01:48] smart the first time we met Friday night
[1:02:15] prayer meeting Jesus but most later
[1:02:17] which reduce himself and Saints I
[1:02:28] started to teach on the mystery of the
[1:02:30] Gentile dispensation I have three
[1:02:33] servants unlike what I want to build
[1:02:35] something
[1:02:40] it has a juicy and kinda scripture
[1:02:42] together his I forgetting elevate teach
[1:02:50] and then people chatter go first and st.
[1:02:58] Thomas James I just I've got to the
[1:03:01] point the first service where I was
[1:03:04] going to introduce them now to the
[1:03:08] Gentiles hidden in the Old Testament and
[1:03:12] I was dealing with this scripture right
[1:03:14] here you know there's two great
[1:03:16] mysteries of Bible yes mr. Massad head
[1:03:18] is a great mystery other great mysteries
[1:03:21] this is a great mystery but I speak
[1:03:23] concerning Christ and His Church and as
[1:03:55] I was going back all the way I was of
[1:04:15] this what he's the first Eve the second
[1:04:24] he was within the episode Cory as I was
[1:04:28] revealing to this something happened
[1:04:31] there was a huge there was a stairway
[1:04:35] the one up to the second story were
[1:04:36] reading and the brothers slept up top
[1:04:38] there's a stair right there there was a
[1:04:40] sound like someone's breaking through
[1:04:42] those stairs and it was so loud when I
[1:04:46] was when I just revealed that by the
[1:04:48] grace of God open that up to them the
[1:04:52] stairs like they're going to explode
[1:04:54] and then everybody turns it goes Satan
[1:05:01] was so upset would have come to find out
[1:05:05] the very floor tile buckled up from
[1:05:08] underneath and I go alright now this I
[1:05:13] think this after the service design one
[1:05:15] day the world has happened the tile
[1:05:17] started buffer for me and I kept the
[1:05:19] Satan's foundation is and after the
[1:05:31] noise stops
[1:05:41] instant respectful district reverence
[1:05:45] because what now meets know the word he
[1:05:50] was hearing thing and it was touching
[1:05:56] not only it's hard for the harlot who's
[1:06:00] that so they lined up another service
[1:06:04] for me but this time of being a hotels
[1:06:07] and you can see here in the back it's
[1:06:09] ten if you can't believe Siemens it shot
[1:06:11] up an angle but the floor is actually
[1:06:14] coming up now here's where we stayed up
[1:06:17] in the upper room there of the churches
[1:06:20] so and the green had desperately Gilbert
[1:06:23] is back he stepped on that when I stuff
[1:06:26] on the other one brother Luke round
[1:06:27] stuff in the other room because he's and
[1:06:32] this is how we lived right here for
[1:06:33] about three or four days and brother
[1:06:36] Luke Brown would come in and start
[1:06:37] preaching to me know I'm trying to study
[1:06:41] start recording it on his little little
[1:06:44] digital device there and send it all
[1:06:46] over and keep preaching to me he's a
[1:06:48] preacher wonderful brother no the very
[1:06:53] next day they let an outreach service

[1:17:15] lord so I started hittin baths is nice
[1:17:18] but I brought it in a different angle
[1:17:21] again and this is it was just a hot that
[1:17:24] was just a by the time we did got there
[1:17:26] and I were to have late due to traffic
[1:17:29] they were already in advance of a study
[1:17:32] but when they shot when they found out
[1:17:33] we were there they said they they said
[1:17:36] alright we want to do another study so
[1:17:39] blue-crowned gets up there you
[1:17:42] introducing me and they brother deal
[1:17:43] what this is best to be a no interpreter
[1:17:45] really Gilbert did his best to interpret
[1:17:47] he's an absolute wonder at us let this
[1:17:50] help to us and now here's the the owner
[1:17:55] and his wife and if you see up there or
[1:17:58] they haven't been he's right there they
[1:18:00] pictured the many hanging in the houses
[1:18:02] whatever
[1:18:03] and here I'm touching up on the mystery
[1:18:06] of baptism
[1:18:07] wrapping it up in a different angle the
[1:18:10] fact that I've ever taught us before so
[1:18:13] I got to teach that by God's grace not
[1:18:17] caring I just went boulders that could
[1:18:19] be just hit just taught and at the end
[1:18:23] of the study you don't know what they're
[1:18:26] gonna do they could run you out they
[1:18:27] could know everything was good the old
[1:18:31] man came up to me this brother right
[1:18:33] here
[1:18:33] the old man came up to me in my left ear
[1:18:36] and he said no sorry my right ear he
[1:18:38] says he says brother I've heard this
[1:18:41] before but now I understand on the
[1:18:47] inside I was just rejoicing because now
[1:18:50] this man is accountable yes he has his
[1:18:54] own little group here that called cell
[1:18:55] groups and he leads that group and now
[1:18:58] he has to know he's got next choice but
[1:19:01] you understand the spirit of one thing
[1:19:04] but not seeing it is enough but when you
[1:19:06] see it now absolutely so all that well

[1:20:29] walls right here after these pillows
[1:20:30] walls outside of that is always
[1:20:32] completely window they didn't have a
[1:20:35] service that day but he said I'm
[1:20:37] supposed to teach and another cell group
[1:20:39] when you keep for me so he is welcoming
[1:20:44] with white old white white open arms and
[1:20:48] I think I actually have an invitation to
[1:20:50] preach at his church that grace will see
[1:20:55] because I taught the same study the
[1:20:58] angle I pot now we went to the cell
[1:20:59] group all very very welcome people there
[1:21:03] we are
[1:21:03] I'm company Randall trainer before we
[1:21:05] teach we teach by God's grace start
[1:21:11] downloading the Word of God and this
[1:21:13] time saying see that big square here I
[1:21:16] taught him the seven revelation rock
[1:21:19] foundations first principles of the
[1:21:23] gospel just Harlem yes and I use this
[1:21:26] because if you look at what we started
[1:21:28] with Hebrews 5 in the beginning right
[1:21:29] says and then he was six to go to the
[1:21:32] first principles yes sir
[1:21:33] and I started teaching on those first
[1:21:35] principles - and notice there's only six
[1:21:37] of these principles but the Bible said
[1:21:39] the st. Paul he said I laid the
[1:21:42] foundation he doesn't know other as
[1:21:44] ladies I did the foundation then in
[1:21:46] another scripture ISA he said and Jesus
[1:21:48] Christ is the chief Cornerstone of that
[1:21:50] foundation even Jesus Christ
[1:21:55] this was Christ
[1:21:57] I said now when the first church and I
[1:21:59] started working the first church and I
[1:22:01] said and then there are six other tiles
[1:22:04] the Gentiles passed this way I started
[1:22:06] working and now the foundation and I
[1:22:08] said when Satan got to some hanging on
[1:22:10] the hands he started rocking and he
[1:22:12] ripped that foundation out the church
[1:22:14] was still full power and he went to
[1:22:17] another about were some work that dead
[1:22:19] works and this and that he ripped that
[1:22:21] one out and this truth will still hold
[1:22:23] power but when the church finally when
[1:22:25] he say the start of yield that
[1:22:27] foundation on baptism
[1:22:30] let's start rocking and reeling that
[1:22:32] rock out stripping the people that back
[1:22:35] to the foundation
[1:22:37] he found the key to the power yes and
[1:22:41] when notices but member with the
[1:22:42] Catholic Church he took that foundation
[1:22:45] out and then he took his headstone
[1:22:47] I said I'd called this brother I said
[1:22:49] any naka industry pieces I said this is
[1:22:56] sinking sand this is not Baraka
[1:22:59] foundation I started to I brought it
[1:23:01] from that angle this brother of these
[1:23:04] are these are all Trinitarian strict
[1:23:05] father son Holy Ghost baptism
[1:23:07] Trinitarian brother I started teaching
[1:23:10] today teaching to him at the end of the
[1:23:13] end of the study he said that is the
[1:23:16] truth even anything did not fight he
[1:23:22] said so he knows he understands he's God
[1:23:30] your sister Suzanne oh well just one of
[1:23:36] those things guys as long as I could
[1:23:38] mean Balu Craig touching the ITO going
[1:23:41] to buy guns various and of course you
[1:23:45] got to eat after you teach us how would
[1:23:47] they do it over now usually now here's
[1:23:52] the question got a real to me this after
[1:23:54] I taught a baptism twice on them seven
[1:23:56] foundations originally I'm dealing the
[1:23:59] baptism and I always had this question
[1:24:02] Romans 6:3
[1:24:04] nobody not that many of us as were
[1:24:05] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[1:24:08] into his death okay verse four therefore
[1:24:14] we are buried with him by baptism into
[1:24:17] you so what our baptism in name of Jesus
[1:24:21] Christ represents what the death of
[1:24:24] Jesus right and they use the name of
[1:24:28] Jesus Christ because that's the name of
[1:24:30] the sacrifice right he's the one to die
[1:24:32] for you right yes
[1:24:34] when did Jesus Christ get baptized in
[1:24:37] his name
[1:24:42] John the Baptist the first hormone to of
[1:24:47] Jesus Christ into water
[1:24:49] he didn't say right the father did not
[1:24:57] say the voice from heaven did not say no
[1:25:02] he said this is my beloved son right
[1:25:09] Bal Transfiguration Jesus Christ our
[1:25:13] Savior reaches adoption but all the
[1:25:18] father said which is important this is
[1:25:21] my beloved son well pleased hear ye
[1:25:27] so where did it take place but look what
[1:25:33] he's saying here well we're very with
[1:25:36] him by my bachelor's in two days yes
[1:25:43] you're very baptized into his death
[1:25:47] Jesus Christ on the cross at the guard
[1:25:52] is sending the Holy Ghost the father's
[1:25:55] son now Christ King of the Cross there
[1:26:05] is no this is my beloved son and that go
[1:26:08] from heaven there is no voice from
[1:26:12] heaven because what in God now the
[1:26:14] father was then all rest upon the son Oh
[1:26:19] Jasmine he talked stripes yes he took
[1:26:24] our Nick when the world didn't want him
[1:26:28] they lifted him up high off the ground
[1:26:29] he was not worthy of Earth he's not
[1:26:31] worthy but having he just come they're
[1:26:33] like oh God

[1:27:07] there it was placed above him on the
[1:27:10] cross amen his death Jesus Christ died
[1:27:31] another man that was the one I've always
[1:27:34] wondered
[1:27:35] and then God revealed to me that's power

[1:35:04] so I call him a brother Peter this is
[1:35:09] there this is their group these are for
[1:35:12] Eagles
[1:35:12] I guarantee it I taught all the way into
[1:35:16] the Gentile dispensation they were all
[1:35:19] just blown away these two I hear these
[1:35:24] three actually these four here
[1:35:26] absolutely treated me like a she lives
[1:35:31] here at the Wellington her husband's
[1:35:32] very very wealthy they lived there she
[1:35:35] treated me with Alba most probably the
[1:35:38] best I've ever been treated my life this
[1:35:40] brother right here can barely speak
[1:35:42] English but each with me driving all
[1:35:44] over he turned to me some these saints
[1:35:51] of God just being around you guys I got
[1:35:55] the same feeling the exact same these
[1:36:01] are real Eagles these have a pastor they
[1:36:04] were so blown away by this study know
[1:36:08] not only the disc supernatural thing
[1:36:10] happen with this history I taught on the
[1:36:12] seven churches jet compensation and I
[1:36:15] had written up here this is my board I
[1:36:16] had seven as a hall over the slide
[1:36:18] showing the seven the candlesticks
[1:36:20] uh uh Navin going down with seven times
[1:36:22] some of this seven that time that and
[1:36:25] after the study this sister says she
[1:36:27] said burn assignment one day years ago
[1:36:29] she had looked at her hand and a
[1:36:32] scarlet-colored seven appeared on her
[1:36:34] hand her right hand she goes I wondered
[1:36:37] about that my entire life I said sister
[1:36:41] look already sure I looked seven seven
[1:36:43] seven
[1:36:44] I said you're probably Brian I said how
[1:36:47] caught in this rapture boys and then
[1:36:51] from now these two supernatural things
[1:36:53] happen they said whenever I come in so
[1:37:01] these Jesus absolutely love me that
[1:37:04] right after the study they said we must
[1:37:06] take you to meet her pastor they took me
[1:37:09] to meet this brother bill in wand he's
[1:37:12] the baby of the biggest number of
[1:37:13] churches in Bangkok 80 church
[1:37:18] he's the biggest pastor and I got to
[1:37:20] meet him out of nowhere just got just
[1:37:23] ordaining in the footsteps yes Lauren
[1:37:25] just cookie in her place they took me to
[1:37:28] meet him underneath this pavilion and he
[1:37:30] he meets me here and there's a there's
[1:37:34] like a little round table
[1:37:35] he said sit I sit quick everybody
[1:37:38] scatters leave me there at home sleep
[1:37:39] then you just these look at me pacing
[1:37:42] back and forth almost like you know I'm
[1:37:45] just kind of smile and all of a sudden
[1:37:47] he starts talking to me we talked about
[1:37:50] 40 30 minutes a Sunday he says I'll give
[1:37:58] you 40 sister Joann runs right up to me
[1:38:04] as he's saying this is it
[1:38:05] she was I don't think you ever see what
[1:38:08] happened here he never talks to nobody
[1:38:10] he said missionaries nobody he was she
[1:38:14] was you must be Timothy nespa this is
[1:38:16] your son you know like in braces he
[1:38:22] loves me for some reason I just God has
[1:38:25] given me favor with this brother right
[1:38:26] here and those four peoples those four
[1:38:29] my Eagle clan right there so then he
[1:38:32] arranges me for Sunday night I'm free to
[1:38:34] teach at his truth
[1:38:36] God just opening doors so also that
[1:38:41] night we got to know eight I think it's
[1:38:42] the next thing I got to go to another
[1:38:43] cell group meeting I thought I should be
[1:38:45] on the free stuff I did it there's a
[1:38:47] little song worship some prayers and
[1:38:50] then this brother right here is the
[1:38:51] leader of it in the blue big man okay he
[1:38:55] started hitting Catholic Church there
[1:38:58] Protestant I said you're positive
[1:39:00] he said yes brother I said you know what
[1:39:01] that means you do I think so I know we
[1:39:04] protest the Catholic churches and yes
[1:39:05] yes so then I waited he started dropping
[1:39:08] bombs on the great of Babylon and
[1:39:12] I waited for a moment and really good
[1:39:14] with some practices so I started dealing
[1:39:16] with with first Timothy for showing the
[1:39:19] doctrines of the any day is doctrines of
[1:39:21] devils not abstain from meat forbidding
[1:39:25] to marriage and I just brought that and
[1:39:26] your scorn
[1:39:27] well what is this
[1:39:29] they have never he taught against the
[1:39:32] Catholic Church further he said like
[1:39:35] four or five years and they never even
[1:39:37] heard the scripture then I was able to
[1:39:40] show them why in the Catholic Church
[1:39:41] quit letting the priests in area because
[1:39:45] in two thousand five two thousand four I
[1:39:47] was sitting listen to NPR radio station
[1:39:50] and a man died even though burns comes
[1:39:52] up and he was given that they were
[1:39:54] interviewing it means that he's an actor
[1:39:55] but he's Catholic he said I was raised
[1:39:59] up in the other order of the Jesuits the
[1:40:01] opposite order reasons but I learned all
[1:40:02] the history of the judgment he says he's
[1:40:04] saying it's over here he said you know
[1:40:06] what they taught me
[1:40:07] he says it's right over there he's done
[1:40:10] I'm just saying I'd like to turn it up
[1:40:11] like he said he said the reason the
[1:40:15] Catholic Church quit having a priest
[1:40:18] marries is because if the priest would
[1:40:20] die early the church would have to pick
[1:40:23] up and take care of a wife and children
[1:40:25] so he did it to save money so that was
[1:40:39] really good as well so they gave us an
[1:40:41] interpretation invitation to come to
[1:40:43] their church on Sunday mornings we went
[1:40:45] to their church Sunday morning by the
[1:40:48] grace of God so we had a little nice
[1:40:50] little service there God did got throw
[1:40:52] away some nuggets things by God's grace
[1:40:55] so then we went to this is an this is
[1:41:00] called the book of Acts church on Sunday
[1:41:03] so we met their pastor we weren't
[1:41:06] allowed to preach but he taught on grace
[1:41:08] by the grace of God so that's the
[1:41:10] passion trees are all businessmen
[1:41:12] businessmen that are preachers so
[1:41:15] there's a pastor right there a little
[1:41:17] crew there we sat down in appreciation
[1:41:19] grace you're good we ain't and then we
[1:41:22] went to service I brother wants church
[1:41:25] and this is their main headquarters
[1:41:26] right here had a wonderful time they can
[1:41:30] worship very well by God's grace they
[1:41:35] love God for their sister laughter there
[1:41:38] is two verses back here
[1:41:45] so they gave me 45 minutes we weren't
[1:41:48] there and we taught and trying to bring
[1:41:51] it right back to baptism but I didn't
[1:41:54] anything I just kind of want to give him
[1:41:55] I just I don't wanna get doctrine I want
[1:41:56] to get white is that one a little more
[1:41:57] favored because I know that happened bad
[1:41:59] he said he'll have you back next time I
[1:42:01] come so I just wanted it a little bit I
[1:42:03] wouldn't hit and when I taught on your
[1:42:05] chest and they burst of the earth again
[1:42:07] I taught him that
[1:42:08] and that was things of God that wasn't
[1:42:11] even a little too deep for that if you
[1:42:13] can imagine if you can imagine the mind
[1:42:15] Center this this area they're just not
[1:42:18] taught the Word of God so actually to go
[1:42:21] back and explain even the system join
[1:42:22] Joann and sister less about what that
[1:42:25] and bring her tight again through and
[1:42:28] try explain to it and they took me out
[1:42:29] to dinner after that sister Joanne
[1:42:32] Stubbe Weston brother Peter and then and
[1:42:36] there I was able to explain one more
[1:42:37] time and say oh not like now I see so
[1:42:40] we're able to do that we had another I
[1:42:42] fly out Monday morning so they had
[1:42:47] another they wanted to get together
[1:42:49] again that night so he went now this is
[1:42:51] another media group they had when them

[1:44:22] prosperous but Lou Gramm s full
[1:44:24] confidence in this hey man in fact the
[1:44:30] next trip he's already drawing it out
[1:44:31] for me he's a scribe in fact his first
[1:44:37] dream he said God came to him and he
[1:44:40] lifted him up and put him on a high
[1:44:42] table a chair he said they said Lord
[1:44:45] what am i what am i administer over my
[1:44:46] mister of finances and my ministers and
[1:44:49] the Holy Ghost
[1:44:49] he says you're a minister to your team
[1:44:51] chemistry which he said was and
[1:44:55] something to do with postage and
[1:44:58] something to ascribe you or something
[1:45:00] like that
[1:45:00] so what he does is he he does internet
[1:45:02] witnessing rewrite call as soon as
[1:45:05] downloads from the years and she come
[1:45:07] out that every person he's ever met you

[1:45:10] also possible he's practice started 20
[1:45:12] or 30 churches themselves he's a
[1:45:14] rewarder of God so now the next meeting
