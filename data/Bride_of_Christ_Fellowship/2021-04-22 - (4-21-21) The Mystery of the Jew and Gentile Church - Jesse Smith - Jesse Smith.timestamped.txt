[16:14] i'd like to go uh
[16:16] to ephesians chapter three i want to
[16:18] start the new series
[16:19] on the next mystery i'm down to three
[16:21] more mysteries and then i preached all
[16:22] 12 to you
[16:23] in their fullness at least in what i
[16:26] could write in about 26 months
[16:28] by god's grace so ephesians chapter 3
[16:30] and they'll read our memory verse
[16:32] brother jose gave us by god's ephesians
[16:34] chapter three
[16:39] and we'll remember we have numerous
[16:40] requests tonight so we want to remember
[16:42] those as well
[16:43] try to keep it about 40 minutes or so 45
[16:46] we'll kind of see how the lord leads
[16:50] it's a real joy to be in the house of
[16:51] the lord tonight amen
[16:53] thank god it's three
[17:03] we'll start at verse one and imagine
[17:05] tonight we'll read a
[17:06] a little more than we will in the future
[17:09] kind of like how we did for the the
[17:11] fourth mystery
[17:13] start ephesians three verse one i'll do
[17:15] a little bit of reading myself and i'll
[17:16] let you know when
[17:17] you can kind of join in your voices here
[17:19] i'll start at verse one for this cause i
[17:21] paul the prisoner of jesus christ
[17:25] for you gentiles what a statement
[17:28] he's calling himself i'm a prisoner for
[17:30] your sakes now church we can
[17:32] all just get that revelation you are a
[17:34] prisoner for someone else
[17:36] right you are here to serve someone else
[17:38] for christ's sake
[17:40] praise god we can easily see with the
[17:41] mothers they're here to serve their
[17:43] children raise the next
[17:44] generation right wives are here serve
[17:46] their husbands
[17:48] right but paul says i'm here he wasn't
[17:50] married didn't have children
[17:52] he said i'm a prisoner of jesus christ
[17:54] for you gentiles
[17:56] which were before the dirtiest people on
[17:58] the face of the earth
[18:00] verse two if you have heard of the
[18:02] dispensation that means stewardship
[18:04] of the grace of god which has given me
[18:07] to you word
[18:08] how that by revelation he made known
[18:11] unto me the mystery
[18:12] as i wrote a four in a few words whereby
[18:15] when ye read you may understand my
[18:17] knowledge in the mystery of christ
[18:20] so i like that how are they going to
[18:21] understand this mystery by reading
[18:23] paul's letter
[18:24] amen praise god how are we going to get
[18:25] the revelation reading the word of god
[18:27] amen
[18:28] you can you know you can go off and pray
[18:30] and that's a good idea you know you can
[18:31] see god revelation that way
[18:32] but paul says you're going to catch this
[18:34] revelation by reading my
[18:36] words praise god hallelujah what a
[18:39] blessing verse 5.
[18:40] now notice this which in other ages was
[18:43] was not made known unto the sons of men
[18:45] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[18:48] apostles and prophets
[18:49] by the spirit that the gentiles should
[18:52] be fellow heirs of the same body
[18:55] and partakers of his promise in christ
[18:58] by the gospel whereof i was made a
[19:01] minister according to the gift of the
[19:03] grace of god given unto me
[19:05] by the effectual working of his power
[19:09] anyone who has a gift should rejoice in
[19:12] the giver of it
[19:14] christ jesus if any good came out of
[19:17] paul's preaching which much did
[19:19] it was because of god's grace giving him
[19:21] a gift
[19:22] and he became a prisoner that gift made
[19:24] him a prisoner
[19:25] it didn't made him it didn't make him
[19:27] independent from everybody else it
[19:28] actually made him
[19:30] a prisoner to everybody else praise god
[19:33] so your gift makes you a servant to
[19:34] other people
[19:36] amen now let's go to the memory verse uh
[19:40] uh psalm 24 here seven psalm 24 7. lift

[26:20] seated praise god
[26:24] hallelujah we'll uh try to get to this
[26:27] thought here
[26:28] by the grace of the lord i just want to
[26:29] pull up a few things
[26:33] so i want to start this new uh series
[26:36] here we'll
[26:37] we'll just call it the mystery of the
[26:39] jew and gentile
[26:40] church of course it has a longer uh has
[26:43] a longer
[26:44] uh title if you remember brother branham
[26:46] reading it in
[26:47] uh is this the sign of the answer as a
[26:49] really long title he actually calls it
[26:51] the mystery of the new testament church
[26:53] composed of jew
[26:54] and gentile so it's a much longer title
[26:57] right but i don't kind of want to
[26:58] shorten it for the sake of
[27:00] just maybe remembering it the mystery of
[27:02] the jew
[27:04] and gentile church so
[27:07] uh we read our text uh we get this
[27:09] mystery out of ephesians chapter three
[27:11] let me set a timer here so
[27:13] i can have a good idea about how long
[27:14] we're going
[27:18] and uh we want to just uh briefly kind
[27:19] of uh
[27:21] background and remind you of the
[27:22] covenants okay so i want to just
[27:25] revisit those briefly remember there was
[27:27] there's eight covenants now brother bram
[27:29] didn't say that i always want to
[27:31] uh you know share that that i brother
[27:33] ma'am never said how many covenants
[27:35] there were
[27:36] uh i felt like there's eight after going
[27:38] through it so i'll just go through those
[27:40] briefly
[27:41] first you had the edenic covenant in
[27:44] genesis one and two
[27:46] god gave the covenant between adam and
[27:48] his wife eve
[27:49] before sin entered after sin
[27:53] we had the adamic covenant right where
[27:55] adam was to rule his wife and have
[27:57] dominion over the earth
[27:59] but yet the ground was cursed for his
[28:01] sake then you had the noahic covenant
[28:04] was that was the third covenant that god
[28:06] would never flood the earth again you
[28:07] had other changes
[28:09] you know about eating meat and so forth
[28:10] afterwards
[28:12] uh but the the fourth covenant really
[28:14] started a a real personal
[28:17] covenant towards israel because the
[28:19] fourth covenant is called the abrahamic
[28:21] covenant
[28:22] and that kind of narrowed it down before
[28:24] god had just given the three covenants
[28:25] to all mankind
[28:27] but at this point god narrows it down to
[28:28] one family
[28:30] god saw how the whole world was corrupt
[28:32] right
[28:33] even after even after the the flood in
[28:35] the tower of babel it was he had to
[28:36] spread it all out
[28:38] and shortly after that he called one
[28:39] family out of babylon basically they
[28:42] were they were in the land of shinar
[28:44] he called he said i'm gonna find one man
[28:46] that i'm gonna just start a real
[28:47] a real nation out of a real spiritual
[28:49] priesthood
[28:50] and he found abraham the bible said
[28:52] remember the bible said he god called
[28:54] him away from his idols
[28:56] so he was an idol worshiper and he said
[28:58] i'm going to start a new
[29:00] uh priesthood with this man abraham and
[29:03] he was called
[29:04] a friend of god amen because he was a
[29:06] man of faith hallelujah
[29:08] and he said i'm going to use you and i'm
[29:10] going to start with you and i'm going to
[29:12] bless everyone else amen and it's a it
[29:15] started this great uh
[29:16] covenant here with abraham and his seed
[29:19] and we know there came out you know
[29:20] isaac and ishmael there kind of came out
[29:23] two lines out of there one by the
[29:25] the uh the bondwoman the slave woman one
[29:27] by the free woman
[29:28] and we're children of the free woman
[29:30] today praise god
[29:32] amen we have a connection to this
[29:33] covenant church you always have a
[29:35] connection to abraham because the bible
[29:37] said
[29:37] the children of faith in jesus are
[29:40] children of abraham amen
[29:42] so i know whoever blesses me is blessed
[29:45] amen
[29:46] hallelujah i know whoever curses me is
[29:49] cursed amen
[29:50] right whether some degree right some are
[29:52] decree a curse more than others some
[29:54] permanent some temporarily
[29:56] because i'm a child of faith i have
[29:59] faith in jesus christ he's my lord and
[30:01] savior amen
[30:02] he died for me i'm i'm a son of abraham
[30:05] praise god
[30:06] now after that after 400 years later god
[30:09] kind of narrowed it even more down
[30:11] to the mosaic covenant praise god
[30:14] and this was the giving of the law here
[30:17] uh through moses
[30:18] on mount sinai and this was the the
[30:21] blood sacrifice and
[30:23] and then the uh the aaronic priesthood
[30:26] came out of this covenant praise god
[30:28] and then 500 years after that came the
[30:31] davidic covenant uh where god has
[30:35] god promises israel i'm always going to
[30:36] have a king from out of david because
[30:38] he was a man of integrity we always say
[30:40] a man after god's own heart that's true
[30:42] but i saw in scripture this morning what
[30:44] made him a man after god's own heart was
[30:46] his integrity
[30:48] right in other words uh his honesty
[30:51] praise god he's an honest man amen
[30:54] uh he was a faithful man now another
[30:57] word is pure man
[30:58] he was an innocent man praise god and
[31:01] that's what he had he was a man of
[31:03] integrity
[31:04] he wanted to love god he wanted to serve
[31:06] god he wanted to please god
[31:08] he wanted the heart of god amen like we
[31:11] just sang about praise god
[31:12] he he was after the heart of god that
[31:15] was his you know he made no shame about
[31:17] it
[31:17] he was wanting to do god's will and god
[31:19] said i want a king like that
[31:21] i'm going to have a i'm going to make a
[31:22] covenant i'm always going to have my
[31:23] people
[31:24] led by a king out of the family of david
[31:28] amen
[31:28] now we know it lasted for a while right
[31:30] lasted for about a thousand years
[31:32] uh or so well maybe about 1600 years and
[31:35] then god had to put it on pause
[31:38] because of israel rejecting the messiah
[31:41] and then came our covenant we say our
[31:44] specific covenant the one paul's writing
[31:45] about
[31:46] the new covenant praise god where god
[31:49] said instead of writing the covenant the
[31:50] promise on tables of stone like moses
[31:53] i'm going to write it on the fleshly
[31:55] tables of your heart
[31:56] say amen hallelujah i do that way you
[31:59] know
[31:59] that way church no man can get rid of
[32:02] our covenant
[32:02] they could take the stones and they you
[32:04] know people could throw them away you
[32:05] know
[32:06] titus could destroy their oh they were
[32:08] their covenant was all kind of messed up
[32:11] ah but once you get the holy ghost
[32:12] nobody can destroy your covenant amen
[32:15] because it's written on your soul amen
[32:18] they can't they can't knock it down they
[32:20] can't destroy it it's forever sealed in
[32:22] your soul
[32:23] by the holy spirit amen hallelujah jesus
[32:26] said destroy this temple
[32:28] in three days i'll raise it up is that
[32:30] right hallelujah that's right they can
[32:32] destroy this body
[32:33] but they can never destroy your soul
[32:35] hallelujah
[32:36] because your soul is god's property amen
[32:39] that's the glory of the new covenant
[32:42] before it was stone
[32:43] and building natural natural but now
[32:46] it's spiritual
[32:47] and it's not natural it's eternal praise
[32:50] god
[32:51] now future church coming coming closer
[32:54] that was uh
[32:55] uh the fifth one right no i'm sorry that
[32:58] was the seventh one already yeah that
[32:59] was the seventh one yeah the seventh
[33:00] coming i'm sorry
[33:01] the seventh covenant was the new
[33:02] covenant the eighth i believe
[33:04] is the eternal covenant because he said
[33:06] behold i'll make all things new
[33:09] and you won't remember the former things
[33:11] anymore
[33:12] oh thank god one day brother amen the
[33:14] devil will never be able to tell you
[33:16] those things he used to do
[33:17] right one day church the devil will
[33:19] never be able to tell me well jesse you
[33:21] did that
[33:21] remember that one day i'll remember it
[33:24] no more
[33:25] hallelujah that's the new covenant these
[33:28] former things
[33:29] will re we remember no more praise god
[33:32] all the struggles and all the all the
[33:34] mind battles some of these
[33:36] awful things that we have to go through
[33:37] the persecution
[33:39] for being forsaken being rejected and
[33:41] mocked and
[33:43] and just thrown out his trash all of
[33:45] that will be forgotten
[33:47] and we will glory in christ for all
[33:49] eternity
[33:50] amen now that's a covenant to me praise
[33:53] god that's the covenant i want to be a
[33:55] part of amen
[33:56] where i never have to leave his side i
[33:59] can serve him for all eternity
[34:01] amen oh that'll be a real joy there
[34:04] praise god
[34:04] uh you can't even put words to it it's
[34:06] so great you can't even put words
[34:08] how joyful this eighth covenant is
[34:11] praise god but we gotta accept the
[34:13] seventh
[34:13] to have a part of the eighth hallelujah
[34:16] now so now as we get into this
[34:20] ministry i want to just uh read a few
[34:23] things i thought was important here
[34:27] uh the the the confusion about the jew
[34:30] and gentile church
[34:32] is whether or not god would allow a
[34:35] previously
[34:36] unholy or sinful people like the
[34:39] gentiles
[34:40] would god allow them into his holy
[34:43] separated family that's kind of the
[34:46] mystery here now
[34:47] to us church i realized this and and and
[34:49] you and you and i you really
[34:51] you realize this too to us this isn't a
[34:53] big mystery
[34:55] but if you were a jew it'd be a huge
[34:57] mystery
[34:59] right that's why for us it's not a great
[35:02] mystery but in the bible
[35:04] this is a huge mystery because this
[35:06] boils down to discrimination
[35:09] that's what this boils down to it's the
[35:12] elimination
[35:13] of discrimination amen i committed my
[35:16] title amen
[35:17] the elimination of discrimination praise
[35:20] god
[35:21] because through abraham and moses those
[35:23] covenants
[35:24] god was discriminating his people away
[35:27] and yes they were more holy the bible
[35:29] said
[35:30] remember the bible said the the the
[35:32] sacrifice of the heifer did
[35:34] purify the flesh because they had the
[35:38] animal sacrifices and they followed the
[35:40] law
[35:40] they were more holy than the gentiles
[35:45] and god separated them for them on
[35:47] purpose god separated them and made them
[35:49] holy and so
[35:50] to some degree they were more holy
[35:54] in the flesh the bible says but the
[35:55] bible said they can never be purged
[35:58] or purged rather in the conscience of
[36:00] their minds because those
[36:02] animal sacrifices could never take away
[36:04] sin oh
[36:05] but thank god we have one sacrifice the
[36:08] bible said
[36:08] one sacrifice once and for all that he
[36:11] forever sanctifies
[36:13] the those who are sanctified by faith in
[36:16] christ jesus amen
[36:17] hallelujah oh what a blessing to be a
[36:20] part of this
[36:21] this covenant church amen so before god
[36:24] god discriminated against the gentiles
[36:27] now he did it for a purpose we know why
[36:29] now
[36:30] right we know why because showing he was
[36:32] a school teacher
[36:34] to bring us to grace right god was going
[36:37] to use the jews
[36:38] as a teaching lesson yes you can be
[36:41] holy through the flesh but you'll never
[36:43] earn it through your flesh
[36:44] it's going to take my intervention it's
[36:46] going to take my sacrifice
[36:48] it's going to take my spirit i've got to
[36:50] provide you a sacrifice
[36:51] to make you holy praise god you won't
[36:54] have
[36:54] you won't accomplish holiness on your
[36:56] own but you will accomplish it through
[36:58] my sacrifice amen
[37:00] not through yours i'm going to provide
[37:02] you a sacrifice amen
[37:05] yes so this is the elimination of
[37:07] discrimination that's a good title there
[37:09] huh
[37:09] thank you holy spirit praise god that's
[37:12] what this is all about
[37:16] and so that's the confusion could god do
[37:19] that
[37:21] could god take a dirty sinful people
[37:23] like the gentiles
[37:24] unholy and make them holy when the bible
[37:27] says keep it up deuteronomy 14 2 lydia
[37:29] i may have you a little busy here in the
[37:30] next few moments we'll see
[37:32] deuteronomy 14 2 says for thou art and
[37:35] holy people unto the lord
[37:37] thy god the lord have chosen thee to be
[37:39] a peculiar people and himself
[37:41] above all nations that are upon the
[37:43] earth so god was saying israel
[37:45] i'm separating you you are far above
[37:47] everyone else
[37:48] because i'm calling you to a more
[37:51] dedicated walk
[37:52] i'm calling you to a holy life a clean
[37:55] life
[37:56] would god would god make the unholy
[37:59] people that were so low
[38:00] would he be able to bring them up to the
[38:04] level of israel would he do that now we
[38:06] know the answer right
[38:08] we'll get to that here now god would
[38:11] only do it
[38:12] as israel obeyed the commands there were
[38:15] conditions
[38:16] on the commands deuteronomy 28 1-2 can
[38:18] you pull that up there
[38:20] this was only going to work if israel
[38:22] kept the commands and now you know it
[38:24] did they keep the commands
[38:25] no they didn't they got kicked out of
[38:27] land they got scattered
[38:28] right they didn't they did they couldn't
[38:30] keep the commands for very long
[38:32] he said it should come to pass that thou
[38:34] shalt hearken diligently unto the voice
[38:35] of the lord thy god
[38:36] to observe to do all his commandments
[38:38] which i command you this day that the
[38:40] lord thy god will set thee on high above
[38:42] all nations of the earth he did for a
[38:45] while right
[38:46] there was a certain time they were so
[38:47] like joshua right
[38:49] david solomon for certain periods of
[38:51] time hezekiah right
[38:53] ezekiel uh not ezekiel hezekiah usia
[38:56] for certain times josiah certain times
[38:59] asa right
[39:00] another coming to my mind asa there were
[39:02] certain times where they were highly
[39:03] lifted up but when they sinned
[39:05] they they failed the conditions and they
[39:07] were brought low
[39:10] right and then uh
[39:13] it was what about 400 or 600 years or so
[39:16] before christ they got totally
[39:18] separated out of the land and it was
[39:21] just awful
[39:22] they fell from this exalted position so
[39:25] could god
[39:26] would god or would would abraham's god
[39:29] raise up other nations to the same honor
[39:32] and blessing as
[39:33] israel because it seems like it was just
[39:36] going to be
[39:37] israel right is he like it's just going
[39:39] to be abraham
[39:40] isaac and jacob and jacob's 12 sons it
[39:42] seemed like it was only going to be them
[39:46] and if so if god could raise up in other
[39:48] nations
[39:50] could the jews and gentiles become one
[39:52] family
[39:53] with the jews and entitled to the same
[39:56] benefits
[39:57] and inheritances praise god could it
[40:00] could it happen
[40:02] so this is the revelation we know it the
[40:04] revelation of the mystery of one church
[40:06] composed of jew and gentile
[40:08] is that every born-again believer no
[40:10] matter their nationality
[40:12] is a part of god's family and entitled
[40:15] to all the rights
[40:16] benefits and future inheritances amen
[40:20] it doesn't matter what nation you come
[40:22] from right because the bible said now
[40:24] god's looking for a holy nation
[40:27] amen before it was segregation right it
[40:29] was discrimination in one way
[40:31] now god did it by favor and by grace but
[40:34] he said
[40:34] i'm only dealing with israel but
[40:38] now god is bringing in every other
[40:40] nation
[40:41] into this holy priesthood amen this may
[40:44] not seem
[40:45] confusing to you but this was a major
[40:48] issue
[40:49] right we're living in a judeo-christian
[40:52] society that's been christian for 400
[40:55] years
[40:57] right so think of all the generations
[40:58] how many generations 10 generations in
[41:00] 400 years right if you take 40 years as
[41:02] a generation
[41:04] so we're like 10th generation
[41:06] judeo-christians
[41:08] so in other words we're used to we're
[41:10] used to gentiles go
[41:11] being accepted at church and and god
[41:13] will hear the gentiles god will hear the
[41:14] gentiles
[41:15] but for 2 000 some years before this god
[41:18] didn't hear the gentiles
[41:20] right they weren't his people and it was
[41:22] hard for the believers at first to think
[41:24] how could god
[41:26] accept them remember jesus parable the
[41:28] good samaritan
[41:29] they those jews walked on the other side
[41:32] of the street
[41:34] i mean it was just they were so dirty
[41:36] they were so
[41:37] they were so wicked they were so immoral
[41:39] and they were
[41:40] most of them they would actually go to
[41:44] the other side of the street in
[41:45] discrimination
[41:46] but god was saying i'm gonna eliminate
[41:48] the discrimination amen
[41:50] i'm gonna i'm gonna tear down this the
[41:52] walls of separation
[41:53] and i'm gonna make these people who are
[41:56] who are segregated
[41:58] and who hate each other i'm gonna take
[42:00] away the hate and i'm gonna bring unity
[42:02] in love amen
[42:04] that's a great mystery it doesn't seem
[42:07] like it to us but it was it was and
[42:09] still is in many cases
[42:10] a great mystery now most of this chapter
[42:14] i go through how god used paul and peter
[42:17] to break down these walls which they do
[42:20] but tonight i'm going to focus mainly on
[42:23] how westerners like us
[42:24] we're westerners right uh
[42:29] we we're kind of surprised and maybe
[42:31] confused
[42:33] uh now now it's switched right for us
[42:35] because we've been 400 years
[42:36] in judeo-christian uh culture
[42:40] where christians yeah christians are
[42:41] always accepted yeah jew genta
[42:43] mostly gentile gentiles are always
[42:44] accepted by god yeah but before this it
[42:47] was only jews
[42:48] right before the the new covenant and so
[42:51] now we've got to get our thinking
[42:53] thinking
[42:54] well could god bring jews into our
[42:56] church right
[42:57] could god bring jews so it's actually
[42:59] switched for us
[43:01] we we need help understanding how could
[43:03] god bring a jew into this grace
[43:10] and the answer is christian liberties
[43:14] that's how god can do it hallelujah so
[43:16] get your bibles ready
[43:18] it's confusing to us because we're
[43:21] accustomed to gentiles only gentile oh
[43:24] every gentile yeah no matter your your
[43:25] skin color no matter your background
[43:27] uh no matter how tall you are you don't
[43:30] know
[43:30] how short you are you know it don't
[43:32] matter we're used to that but
[43:34] to the jew it wasn't that way you had to
[43:36] look a certain way dress a certain way
[43:38] act a certain way
[43:39] observe so many days and that's how you
[43:41] got favor with god
[43:43] so our life is totally different from
[43:45] theirs right
[43:48] we don't we uh we don't feel like we've
[43:50] got to have to do all these things we're
[43:51] just thankful for grace now we want to
[43:53] do something for god
[43:54] but we're not under the same school kind
[43:57] of
[43:57] education type of requirements and
[44:00] constraints that they were under
[44:02] so we have a different mindset praise
[44:04] god and i'll say like this
[44:05] we need a better balance right
[44:08] especially message people because we get
[44:10] so lazy
[44:12] see the jews were legalistic right
[44:15] now some churches due to legalistic they
[44:17] go all the way back to the law
[44:20] but we need a better balance of being
[44:22] more diligent like the bible said over
[44:24] and over give more diligence
[44:26] be fervent in spirit be so so you see we
[44:28] need to be zealous
[44:29] with the right attitude i want to do
[44:32] something for jesus
[44:33] amen i know i'm saved i know the great
[44:36] god has caught my heart
[44:38] i know he's led me to the cross now what
[44:40] can i do for jesus amen
[44:43] because i'm so happy and i'm so thankful
[44:45] what can i do for my lord
[44:46] but it's not the fear like oh if i don't
[44:48] do anything if i don't do something
[44:50] quick i'm going to go to hell
[44:52] we're not under that remember that was
[44:54] all to point you to christ
[44:56] where you can't earn heaven jesus earned
[44:58] heaven for you
[44:59] you must trust in his sacrifice he made
[45:02] the way to heaven he's the way the truth
[45:04] and the life
[45:05] he's the only way we're getting to
[45:06] heaven praise god and god just gives us
[45:08] the grace
[45:09] god gives us a little job we just got to
[45:11] be faithful with our little job
[45:13] but the destinations already determined
[45:15] we're already sealed into the kingdom of
[45:16] god amen
[45:18] amen we just got to be faithful with our
[45:20] little job here on earth
[45:22] can i say this your little assignment
[45:25] just just
[45:25] do your little assignment right we
[45:27] already know where your destination is
[45:29] it's heaven right
[45:30] we are going to heaven because it's not
[45:32] by our works it's by the blood of jesus
[45:34] christ
[45:34] but we must be faithful with our
[45:36] assignment
[45:37] and we know as we said on sunday with
[45:39] those false prophets
[45:41] many times when people uh
[45:44] when when false prophets
[45:47] uh twist the assignment see they're
[45:50] supposed to prophesy
[45:51] truth in the name of jesus but when they
[45:53] twist it and they lie in the name of
[45:55] jesus
[45:55] then we know they aren't going to heaven
[45:58] right
[45:59] because the jesus said you'll know them
[46:00] by their fruits
[46:03] see see so we we have to we have to have
[46:05] that balance too well i've got to be
[46:06] faithful with my assignment
[46:09] which we want to be right we want to be
[46:12] but we also have the guarantee that
[46:13] heaven is assured for us praise god
[46:16] it's because we're doing our very best
[46:18] to do the assignment
[46:19] right like i love that parable of the
[46:21] tales the the two come back and say lord
[46:23] ah you gave me five here's here's ten he
[46:26] said well done buddy see he he knew what
[46:28] he was doing i knew exactly
[46:29] i did invest in that praise god now
[46:32] and i heard a good uh idea look at that
[46:35] one talent man who buried in the land
[46:37] he didn't commit adultery
[46:41] he didn't murder
[46:45] he didn't blaspheme hello
[46:49] he just had a fear of god and he had the
[46:52] wrong idea about god well god doesn't
[46:54] deserve it he takes things that don't
[46:56] belong to him everything belongs to god
[46:59] my whole life belongs to god i have
[47:01] nothing good except god gave it to me

[47:06] breath right now is the gift of god he
[47:08] deserves everything amen
[47:10] i deserve nothing he deserves everything
[47:12] and because of that i can invest with
[47:14] confidence
[47:15] i'll do something for jesus because i
[47:17] know he gave me something amen
[47:20] he's just he can do whatever he wants

[47:42] never married 12 women
[47:44] all right he never killed anybody
[47:48] but jesus said throw him into outerness
[47:51] where there's weeping and gnashing of
[47:52] teeth because he had a fearful attitude
[47:54] in other words he had a very evil
[47:56] attitude towards god

[49:10] so see now we we're having more trouble
[49:14] understanding how could god bring jews
[49:16] back in
[49:17] it's been so free for two thousand years
[49:19] right there's been
[49:20] a there's been no legalism right as far
[49:23] as with real believers now
[49:25] satan always tries to get people to be
[49:26] legalistic right but with real believers
[49:28] there hasn't been
[49:29] legalism and oh you have to you have to
[49:31] worship that day you have to worship you
[49:33] have to have special services that day
[49:34] you know the the the five feast days and
[49:36] the two holy days of israel you know
[49:38] we don't have that right but we have to
[49:41] understand how god is gonna he has to
[49:43] bring
[49:44] jews into this because the bride must be
[49:47] made out of every nation
[49:48] that's right all right now get your
[49:51] bible here let's
[49:52] uh get a little thought here i just want
[49:54] to go through a few scriptures here
[49:56] tonight
[50:01] now what's happened church is brother
[50:03] adam taught this this is a beautiful
[50:04] thing
[50:05] brother brown said the gospel always
[50:06] travels across the earth
[50:10] in 500 uh 500 years ago god started a
[50:13] revival in germany
[50:16] by a man of the name of martin luther
[50:18] praise god
[50:20] the holy spirit traveled west
[50:23] to england right
[50:27] 200 years later john wesley had a
[50:30] revival because the holy spirit moved on
[50:32] right they didn't they crucified the
[50:33] effects of it so the holy spirit
[50:35] not not martin luther but his f the
[50:36] people after him crucified the effects
[50:38] of the holy spirit
[50:39] so the holy spirit's always moving on
[50:41] like the major revival right
[50:43] that was in the uh so martin luther was
[50:46] in the 16th century
[50:48] uh john wesley 18th century
[50:51] the 20th century 200 years later it came
[50:54] to california usa
[50:56] azuza street praise god see how it's
[50:59] moving west
[51:01] right it's moving that's how it started
[51:03] in jerusalem right so jerusalem started
[51:05] moving
[51:06] paul brought paul took it west
[51:09] just like the sun right traveling starts
[51:11] in the east
[51:12] goes to the west see
[51:15] and then it just keeps going now uh
[51:18] listen to this here america has
[51:22] crucified the revival there's a few of
[51:25] us still gleaning though thank god for
[51:27] that amen
[51:28] but the revival overall has been
[51:31] crucified
[51:32] right by the denominations they've
[51:34] crucified not us we're crucifying our
[51:36] flesh
[51:37] but they've crucified the revival they
[51:39] don't want the revival they don't want
[51:40] jesus in their church
[51:41] but that's right we want him here amen
[51:43] and he's here tonight praise god amen
[51:46] he promised to be praise the lord
[51:49] but now if you notice in the last few
[51:51] years
[51:52] it's continuing to go east i'm sorry
[51:55] west
[51:55] it's continued to go west so it went
[51:57] across the ocean
[51:59] right and i don't know if you've seen
[52:02] this
[52:02] but the council of foreign relations
[52:04] says china
[52:06] is having a major revival because it
[52:08] crossed the ocean
[52:10] and it's hitting china this council says
[52:14] china may have the largest christian
[52:16] population
[52:17] by 2030 that's only nine years away
[52:22] because the revival you can see it on
[52:24] youtube have you seen it
[52:25] they'll have people they have people's
[52:26] cell phones now they got to go they have
[52:28] to go hide out
[52:29] to do this they have to go hide out in
[52:32] houses they have to have watch people
[52:34] so the government doesn't get in there
[52:35] and rest them and kill them and take
[52:37] them off the slave camps
[52:38] but you'll see them they will scream and
[52:40] cry and sing like days of elijah
[52:43] amazing grace they will scream and cry
[52:45] for hours
[52:46] and getting salvation amen
[52:49] it's just it's it's and that's what
[52:51] azusa street looked like
[52:53] that's what you look like when you got
[52:55] saved amen
[52:57] hallelujah that was your revival and
[53:00] it's going across
[53:01] west and next did you know
[53:05] the voice of the martyrs they're a
[53:07] christian organization
[53:10] their canada outlet now middle
[53:13] easterners
[53:14] are coming to christ by thousands upon
[53:18] thousands
[53:20] so see how it's gone now china now it's
[53:22] moving either further west now to the
[53:24] middle east
[53:26] back to jerusalem
[53:29] and the next revival will be the hundred
[53:31] forty four thousand amen
[53:33] i don't know because the holy ghost is
[53:36] going back
[53:36] church it's going back but thank god we

[59:47] holy spirit's burning over on that side
[59:49] of the earth
[59:51] but don't don't let your fire go at
[59:52] yours don't let it go out you keep it
[59:54] burning praise god
[59:55] keep feeding the fire keep putting your
[59:58] dead habits in that fire right burn your
[1:00:00] dead habits

[1:00:27] thank god amen
[1:00:30] yeah the fire will come back how many
[1:00:31] believe that amen
[1:00:38] they can't stop the fire of god no one
[1:00:40] can stop it god's gonna keep burning
[1:00:42] saving
[1:00:43] and they're seeing huge revivals as the
[1:00:45] holy ghost left
[1:00:46] uh i'll say like this left north america
[1:00:48] coming around
[1:00:50] asia and now coming back to the middle
[1:00:52] east where it started
[1:00:54] that's right on the day of pentecost
[1:00:56] amen
[1:00:57] that's where it started praise god
[1:00:59] jerusalem
[1:01:00] went around west coming back east here
[1:01:02] we are
[1:01:04] coming back for the final revival the
[1:01:06] 144 thousand
[1:01:09] the final revival but you know we'll be
[1:01:10] having a revive up in
[1:01:12] a revival supper i should say like that
[1:01:15] the marriage suffered the lamb by god's
[1:01:17] grace
[1:01:18] now get your bibles here let's hit some
[1:01:19] of these liberty scriptures so we can
[1:01:21] see them here
[1:01:23] now this is one of my most important
[1:01:25] ones colossians 2. you probably remember
[1:01:27] this
[1:01:28] uh i was preaching about the sabbath not
[1:01:30] long ago
[1:01:31] colossians 2 16 but we'll probably read
[1:01:33] a few before that
[1:01:45] let's uh and i think the the main idea
[1:01:47] of this mystery is that
[1:01:49] god loves variety and he's bringing
[1:01:53] all nations into the kingdom of god but
[1:01:56] he still allows for a variety of
[1:01:58] expressions
[1:01:59] right a variety of different
[1:02:04] ways to worship and live and express
[1:02:07] themselves
[1:02:08] and yet they're all still entitled to
[1:02:11] the benefits and blessings of god
[1:02:14] praise god you could like you can eat
[1:02:16] meat or not
[1:02:18] you can still be filled with the holy
[1:02:19] ghost either one you can eat plants the
[1:02:21] rest of your life
[1:02:22] and you can be filled with the holy
[1:02:23] ghost right
[1:02:26] you can eat a kosher diet the rest of
[1:02:28] your life now that's of course you can
[1:02:30] still have some meat and kosher
[1:02:31] you can eat a kosher jewish diet and you
[1:02:33] can still have the baptism of the holy
[1:02:34] ghost
[1:02:36] you can wear some jewelry and still have
[1:02:37] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:02:39] or you can shun all jewelry and you can
[1:02:41] still have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:02:44] amen man you can drink a little wine for
[1:02:47] your stomach's sake
[1:02:50] right that's a tough one that's a tough
[1:02:52] one especially in america
[1:02:54] you can drink a little wine for your
[1:02:56] stomach's sake and you're often
[1:02:58] infirmities and still
[1:03:00] have the baptism of the holy ghost have
[1:03:02] eternal life in your soul
[1:03:04] your soul can be so can you imagine that
[1:03:05] sisters brothers
[1:03:07] your soul can be so free and eternal
[1:03:09] life in your soul and then your body's
[1:03:11] just weak and tired
[1:03:12] you can drink a little wine at night now
[1:03:14] you don't want to see you don't don't
[1:03:15] want to show that to your children right
[1:03:17] i don't i don't want to show to your
[1:03:18] children
[1:03:20] maybe you could if you have mature
[1:03:21] children
[1:03:23] but if you got wayward children you
[1:03:24] probably wouldn't want to do that
[1:03:25] because they might get drunk
[1:03:27] or they might model after you but you
[1:03:29] can have the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:03:31] and have different areas of your life
[1:03:33] that are a little bit different than
[1:03:35] other people
[1:03:36] but god's grace still smiles and said
[1:03:38] that's my child amen
[1:03:40] they're forever mine and they're
[1:03:42] entitled to every blessing
[1:03:44] that i'm giving my other children that
[1:03:46] maybe decide things a little differently
[1:03:49] i'm eliminating the discrimination
[1:03:53] amen hallelujah praise god amen
[1:03:56] i love jesus don't you now there's
[1:03:59] certain doctrines that are absolutely
[1:04:00] necessary a holy ghost for a
[1:04:02] filled person has to do this but then we
[1:04:03] know there's liberties
[1:04:05] colossians 2 and i love the guy who's
[1:04:08] writing this is the guy who used to be a
[1:04:10] pharisee of pharisees
[1:04:12] amen he used to be the the most
[1:04:14] discriminatory
[1:04:15] i'll say like this he used to be the
[1:04:17] most racist of all of them
[1:04:20] races against christians especially but
[1:04:23] you know gentiles too
[1:04:25] he's embarrassing of pharisees no he
[1:04:27] would
[1:04:28] he would have had all the coats he would
[1:04:29] have been like don't touch me he said
[1:04:31] leave me alone
[1:04:33] he'd have been telling those guards keep
[1:04:34] the gentiles out of
[1:04:36] out of the court of the women the court
[1:04:37] of man keep them out please keep them
[1:04:39] out
[1:04:40] one got in last week and he kind of
[1:04:41] defiled our sanctuary our fellowship
[1:04:44] and now god's using that guy the most
[1:04:48] racist and the discriminatory of all of
[1:04:50] them he's saying come on in boys
[1:04:54] come on into christ come on into grace
[1:04:57] amen
[1:04:58] come on into acceptance you're welcome
[1:05:00] in the family of god
[1:05:02] amen come on in boys i love it
[1:05:06] before he's keeping him out now he's
[1:05:08] saying come on in come on enjoy this
[1:05:10] grace that we have
[1:05:12] the blessings of god now it's not grace
[1:05:15] to sin you know the bible said shall we
[1:05:17] continue in sin
[1:05:18] that grace may abound god forbid
[1:05:21] but there's areas of liberty where you
[1:05:23] express yourself to god differently
[1:05:25] colossians 2 and that's why people today
[1:05:28] in the message some of them can't
[1:05:30] understand it
[1:05:30] because they don't have the revelation
[1:05:32] of this they've got to have certain
[1:05:34] lengths of their sleeves and
[1:05:35] certain lengths of their dresses and the
[1:05:37] church said
[1:05:39] they got to listen to certain preachers
[1:05:41] they've got to have certain meetings and
[1:05:43] eat certain foods and do this
[1:05:46] that's fine they can have that
[1:05:47] expression but if they condemn everybody
[1:05:50] else that don't act like them
[1:05:51] they're condemned maybe not eternally
[1:05:54] but at least temporarily because they
[1:05:56] don't have the revelation
[1:05:58] that god accepts more than just them
[1:06:02] praise god he's a god of love and grace
[1:06:05] amen so see this this this uh
[1:06:09] this revelation closes the door on
[1:06:12] legalism right
[1:06:13] it says we're not in the legalism
[1:06:14] anymore we're into grace
[1:06:16] and we're allowing expression of peoples
[1:06:19] all kinds of different that's why
[1:06:20] music's so important about this
[1:06:22] music's so important uh diet so
[1:06:25] important
[1:06:25] how you present your your physical
[1:06:27] appearance is so important
[1:06:29] because god is a god of variety
[1:06:33] amen i know it's right because i've
[1:06:37] studied the scripture
[1:06:39] i know it's right because god has
[1:06:40] approved i've studied myself
[1:06:43] approved unto god god's approved this in
[1:06:45] my heart i believe it
[1:06:47] colossians 2 16. i'm just trying to get
[1:06:49] there still i just can't stop talking
[1:06:51] uh let me get here colossians 2 16.
[1:06:56] going the wrong way now remember verse 8
[1:06:59] he told them beware foolish traditions
[1:07:02] of men
[1:07:03] philosophies of men rudiments of the
[1:07:05] world people that are
[1:07:06] after those things and not after christ
[1:07:09] in verse 8.
[1:07:12] now remember verse 14 he's blotting out
[1:07:14] all the handwriting and ordinances that
[1:07:16] were against us
[1:07:18] he took it out of the way nailed it to
[1:07:20] the cross
[1:07:21] so all those legalistic requirements man
[1:07:24] the waters of separation
[1:07:26] that's great stuff but you couldn't go
[1:07:28] to church for seven days
[1:07:29] man that about killed me right because i
[1:07:32] send i might send the day before church
[1:07:34] then i have to sit out what if i spend
[1:07:36] the day before going to church the next
[1:07:37] time i never get to go to church
[1:07:40] i don't even know how people went to
[1:07:42] church in those days to be honest with
[1:07:43] you
[1:07:44] i don't even know how they went but god
[1:07:46] took all those
[1:07:47] uh legalistic requirements that was a
[1:07:50] teacher to train us
[1:07:52] how jesus fulfilled all that
[1:07:54] righteousness and jesus was so
[1:07:56] he kept it all amen and because of that
[1:07:59] he deserves our highest praise amen
[1:08:07] and then our text for the god's receipt
[1:08:09] sermon was verse 15.
[1:08:11] he made a show of them openly verse 16.
[1:08:13] so he said because jesus christ
[1:08:15] made a show of all these demons that
[1:08:19] were trying to
[1:08:20] condemn you and make you a legalistic
[1:08:22] person because jesus condemned all these
[1:08:25] all these ordinances and man-made things
[1:08:27] right
[1:08:28] man-made ideas he said let no man
[1:08:31] therefore
[1:08:32] judge you in meat or in drink or respect
[1:08:36] of a holy day
[1:08:38] or of the new moon or of the sabbath day
[1:08:42] now i'm the type of person i don't know
[1:08:43] about you but i'm the type of person
[1:08:45] many times i care what people think
[1:08:48] right i'm a people pleaser i want
[1:08:50] everybody to be happy
[1:08:52] right and if i know somebody's got
[1:08:54] somebody against me i'll do everything i
[1:08:56] can to make it right
[1:08:57] but when it comes down to this the bible
[1:08:59] said
[1:09:00] don't let anybody judge you in meat
[1:09:03] drink
[1:09:04] holy days new moons or of sabbath days
[1:09:07] in other words don't let it bother you
[1:09:10] there's certain christian liberties that
[1:09:12] we have
[1:09:13] if somebody judges you just tell them
[1:09:16] that's fine brother don't let it eat
[1:09:19] away that you're not pleasing
[1:09:21] people that are criticizing you aren't
[1:09:23] you glad you got this blessing
[1:09:25] you don't have to our church doesn't
[1:09:26] have to be exactly like another church
[1:09:28] and other churches don't have to be
[1:09:30] exactly like ours god accepts us
[1:09:32] in our liberties right our freedom of
[1:09:35] expression
[1:09:36] and god's not cutting us off because
[1:09:39] maybe certain days we consider more holy
[1:09:41] or maybe certain things we eat or drink
[1:09:44] right or we have certain days that are
[1:09:47] extra special to us
[1:09:49] you know god's not god's not cutting us
[1:09:51] off paul's saying
[1:09:52] he's saying jesus christ hallelujah
[1:09:56] took all those man-made requirements
[1:09:58] away amen
[1:09:59] jesus christ fulfilled all of it praise
[1:10:01] god so you'd have to worry about
[1:10:03] uh keeping all the legalistic things he
[1:10:05] said you have freedom of expression
[1:10:07] don't let a man judge you
[1:10:08] christ is your judge amen in other words
[1:10:11] i'll say like this
[1:10:12] christ took your judgment so there's no
[1:10:14] condemnation for you amen
[1:10:16] hallelujah so whether you eat
[1:10:20] meat or not you're not condemned
[1:10:24] thank god whether you drink this or that
[1:10:27] or a little wine or no wine
[1:10:29] you're not judged whether you keep
[1:10:32] certain days or not
[1:10:33] you're not judged it's a liberty in
[1:10:36] christ
[1:10:39] and he said verse 18 don't let no man
[1:10:41] any any man beguile you in reward
[1:10:44] in the voluntary humility look how these
[1:10:47] deceivers there they try to be so humble
[1:10:49] worshiping of angels intruding in those
[1:10:51] things which they've not seen
[1:10:52] vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind so
[1:10:55] see all these false teachers they're so
[1:10:57] carnal
[1:10:58] they don't have a spiritual mind but
[1:11:00] thank god we have the mind of christ
[1:11:02] in other words what that means is when
[1:11:03] you hear something preach you run it all
[1:11:05] the way through the bible
[1:11:07] your mind's like a computer it's running
[1:11:09] all through let's run that genesis to
[1:11:11] revelation
[1:11:12] can you imagine like a light going
[1:11:13] through like a search engine that's what
[1:11:15] happens when you hear something preach
[1:11:16] oh i gotta let me run that through the
[1:11:18] scripture let me pray about that real
[1:11:19] quick here
[1:11:20] see it's gotta run down through and make
[1:11:22] sure it lines up with the word of god
[1:11:25] right because you can sense when people
[1:11:26] are not sincere as we said on sunday
[1:11:29] you can watch those videos those people
[1:11:30] are not sincere they're putting on a
[1:11:32] show
[1:11:33] they're pretending to be holy but
[1:11:35] they're not holy because they're lying
[1:11:38] right and any christian can pick that up
[1:11:40] i like i got some good feedback on that
[1:11:42] sunday morning message i appreciate that
[1:11:44] some people are like i like how you're
[1:11:45] bawling them out i like how you're
[1:11:46] rebuking them i said well praise the
[1:11:47] lord i
[1:11:48] i was a little nervous about it but i'm
[1:11:50] uh someone's got a call right and wrong
[1:11:52] right someone's got to call it right
[1:11:54] wrong someone's got to warn the people
[1:11:57] so in closing here let me try to close
[1:11:59] here and give me a let me set a little
[1:12:00] timer here
[1:12:01] give me 10 minutes we'll try to close
[1:12:05] so holy days right meat
[1:12:09] drink so wine and meat
[1:12:12] and sabbath days
[1:12:16] right we know the seventh-day adventists
[1:12:17] are big on saturday right
[1:12:19] big man they're so big on that's that's
[1:12:21] their major
[1:12:22] that's fine i don't think that condemns
[1:12:24] them i think they're really
[1:12:25] often false doctrine but i don't think
[1:12:27] that condemns them because the bible
[1:12:28] says right here
[1:12:29] they got a right to make that a holy day
[1:12:31] they're just going overboard with it you
[1:12:33] know
[1:12:33] and of course they're not born again
[1:12:34] they do all kinds of sins you know they
[1:12:36] keep them from being sanctified all the
[1:12:38] way
[1:12:38] but they they want to make saturday of
[1:12:40] the day go ahead that's fine
[1:12:42] make saturday your day that can be your
[1:12:44] your sabbath day
[1:12:45] but remember romans uh romans 14 let's
[1:12:48] go romans
[1:12:49] now that was colossians romans wait a
[1:12:51] couple more
[1:13:01] romans 14. now the whole chapter is on i
[1:13:03] believe meat
[1:13:06] the freedoms of meat eating and wine
[1:13:12] now he says we have to be careful about
[1:13:15] those who are weak in faith
[1:13:17] now again this doesn't apply to us right
[1:13:20] but we got to think about think about
[1:13:22] new converts are coming think about what
[1:13:24] they might look at our lives and say wow
[1:13:26] they're pretty
[1:13:27] look how they're christian but they're
[1:13:29] doing this now for us it'd be the music
[1:13:31] many times
[1:13:32] we listen to how we eat
[1:13:35] how we treat our bodies right because
[1:13:38] that could be a stumbling block if we go
[1:13:40] out to eat with people and we just
[1:13:42] gorge ourselves and that person will
[1:13:45] gorge themself is that a good testimony
[1:13:46] for them
[1:13:48] if they're weak in faith no that's not a
[1:13:51] good testimony
[1:13:52] so see i think as we go on the holy
[1:13:54] spirit is going to show us
[1:13:55] more things where we have to be careful
[1:13:56] how we live
[1:13:58] i'll say like this we especially got to
[1:14:00] watch our words
[1:14:03] when we joke around it's okay to joke
[1:14:05] sometimes but we got to be careful what
[1:14:06] we say
[1:14:08] right because some of our words can be
[1:14:09] close to cuss words
[1:14:12] right and how we say it we got to be
[1:14:15] very close we got to be very careful
[1:14:16] with our words
[1:14:18] not like oh you're going to hell but we
[1:14:20] don't want to cause anybody stumble
[1:14:22] like you said we got to keep our
[1:14:23] assignment right we got to
[1:14:25] we want to follow our assignment right
[1:14:28] the bible says we want our word seasoned
[1:14:30] with what salt
[1:14:32] so that means they make you thirsty i
[1:14:34] want to be like you
[1:14:36] now we want that to work for the right
[1:14:37] way right for holy words
[1:14:40] not unholy words
[1:14:44] so see our our culture is different
[1:14:47] because we've been under christian
[1:14:48] culture gentiles for 400 years
[1:14:50] so we've got to be a little more
[1:14:51] thoughtful about well how does this
[1:14:52] apply to us
[1:14:53] new christians coming in i love you know
[1:14:56] we've talked to
[1:14:57] uh benjamin and austin over the years
[1:14:59] the different ones that have come in and
[1:15:00] they just think wow
[1:15:01] they've told me and some maybe some of
[1:15:03] you wow you guys live such a holy life
[1:15:05] and
[1:15:05] i don't know how you could do that we
[1:15:06] don't know how you could do that like
[1:15:08] benjamin told me one time he told his
[1:15:09] friend he said pastor jesse does this
[1:15:11] and this and that he's like no way
[1:15:14] like yeah that's how i live my life you
[1:15:16] know i mean now it's nothing big to us
[1:15:18] like it's just
[1:15:18] maybe prayer fasting and not drinking
[1:15:20] wine and you know
[1:15:23] not doing video games i forgot i can't
[1:15:24] remember what it was i think it was in
[1:15:25] the other sanctuary we were talking
[1:15:27] about that
[1:15:28] and benjamin was like no come and meet
[1:15:29] him you know he never came but he's like
[1:15:31] yeah you can come see that's how that's
[1:15:32] how they live
[1:15:34] so we would never want to live in a way
[1:15:37] that would cause somebody weak in faith
[1:15:39] to stumble
[1:15:41] right and look at verse five uh romans
[1:15:44] four
[1:15:44] five one man esteemeth one day above
[1:15:46] another
[1:15:47] like some people really reverence
[1:15:48] brother brahms birthday which just
[1:15:50] passed this few days ago
[1:15:52] right some people really reverence
[1:15:54] easter which is great that's a great day
[1:15:58] another esteem is every day alike so
[1:15:59] every day is just the same
[1:16:02] let every man be fully persuaded in his
[1:16:04] own mind see
[1:16:05] see uh you know a man that thinks every
[1:16:07] day is the same he's probably seen
[1:16:08] people get real excited for easter
[1:16:10] meetings but then the next sunday they
[1:16:11] don't even come to church
[1:16:12] so he's like well why should i get
[1:16:14] excited i'll just be steady every
[1:16:15] service
[1:16:17] see so so no matter how the person feels
[1:16:20] they're just steady in the house of god
[1:16:22] they might not show a lot of zeal every
[1:16:23] sir
[1:16:24] or just you know on holidays but they're
[1:16:26] just steady every time
[1:16:27] other people they're down they're not
[1:16:29] pulling some services but you bring a
[1:16:31] guest preacher in there
[1:16:32] they're shouting it down they're like
[1:16:34] what happened to this person
[1:16:36] right that's what the pastor of the home
[1:16:37] church thinks what happened to this
[1:16:38] person
[1:16:39] mercy but see they now they could still
[1:16:42] be born again and saved right
[1:16:44] but they just esteem some days above
[1:16:47] others
[1:16:49] now that's likely they might not be
[1:16:51] saved if they only get excited when the
[1:16:53] guest preacher comes with then are they
[1:16:54] feeding on the pastor ministry or not
[1:16:57] so just a point to make
[1:17:00] so so paul says some people are just the
[1:17:02] same every day
[1:17:03] every day's holy every day is christmas
[1:17:07] every day is mother's day right every
[1:17:09] day is thanksgiving some people just
[1:17:10] like that
[1:17:11] other people like oh brother jess oh
[1:17:14] this day is really important
[1:17:15] thanksgiving's really important to me
[1:17:16] you know
[1:17:17] not no one said that to me fourth of
[1:17:20] july is really important to me you know
[1:17:22] people can have their own their own
[1:17:23] convictions but just be fully persuaded
[1:17:26] in your own mind
[1:17:31] now i want to uh go to verse
[1:17:34] 23. here's what we really need to
[1:17:36] understand and he that doubteth is
[1:17:37] damned if he eat because he eateth not
[1:17:39] of faith
[1:17:40] for whatsoever is not a faith is sin you
[1:17:41] just want to have faith in whatever
[1:17:43] you're doing
[1:17:44] praise the lord whatever you allow paul
[1:17:47] said
[1:17:47] have faith i know this is right because
[1:17:50] this is okay because paul did this or
[1:17:51] because paul taught that
[1:17:53] okay 1st corinthians 8 1st corinthians
[1:17:57] 8.
[1:18:03] oh i love that this is such a beautiful
[1:18:04] chapter meats and christian liberties
[1:18:07] meat and christian liberty talks also
[1:18:09] talks about wine
[1:18:11] i love this chapter because this last
[1:18:12] verse oh my
[1:18:16] now now here's a very interesting verse
[1:18:19] 9 says
[1:18:20] sometimes we can have a liberty and
[1:18:22] it'll be a stumbling block to them that
[1:18:24] are weak
[1:18:25] and the example he gives is a christian
[1:18:27] eats food that was sacrificed to idols
[1:18:30] now for us that might be like i said
[1:18:31] before you eating
[1:18:34] at us can i just say like uh you guys
[1:18:37] are at applebee's i'm not gonna
[1:18:38] but like a sports bar i know you didn't
[1:18:40] eat there right
[1:18:42] but i've eaten there before and i look
[1:18:44] at the people drinking at the bar
[1:18:45] well let's say i'm a christian i go
[1:18:47] there i just eat at the bar and i'm
[1:18:48] watching the game
[1:18:50] and then a young christian walks in and
[1:18:52] sees that now you guys would never do
[1:18:53] that we i'd never do that
[1:18:54] but let's say somebody did that that
[1:18:55] could cause somebody to stumble
[1:18:57] huh that christian's out there he's
[1:18:58] watching the game he had a beer
[1:19:00] well maybe i could have a beer and that
[1:19:03] would be a stumbling block to a new
[1:19:04] christian that don't happen at our
[1:19:05] church
[1:19:06] happens in denominational churches right
[1:19:08] that'd be an awful stumbling block
[1:19:11] right now we know better than that we
[1:19:13] know birds of a feather flock together
[1:19:16] so we get it to go right
[1:19:19] or if you do have to go in there you sit
[1:19:20] way back far away from the bar right
[1:19:22] like i go to restaurants all the time
[1:19:24] and i have to sit in a place where i
[1:19:25] can't see the tv
[1:19:27] because i'm just i'm just a as a man my
[1:19:30] eyes are just
[1:19:31] i got to be very careful what i look at
[1:19:34] i purposely will try to you can ask my
[1:19:35] wife on our dates we'll go to this
[1:19:37] certain restaurant i like baja west
[1:19:38] it's a like a taco place you know
[1:19:41] awesome many times i'll say i'm not
[1:19:42] gonna sit there because i'm starting at
[1:19:43] the tv
[1:19:44] and it might be a cooking show but they
[1:19:46] got a half naked woman on there you know
[1:19:48] or in the commercials in between they
[1:19:49] show half naked women i'm like well what
[1:19:52] you know or they got the old basketball
[1:19:54] game makes me want to watch and
[1:19:56] i'm supposed to be talking to my wife
[1:19:58] i'm supposed to be uh
[1:19:59] you know being a good husband that ain't
[1:20:02] going to help me the basketball game
[1:20:05] you know so we have to use wisdom on how
[1:20:07] we live our christian lives
[1:20:11] now here look now look at verse 11 this
[1:20:13] can be very serious
[1:20:15] like i said especially with the alcohol
[1:20:16] right
[1:20:18] the alcohol and maybe the sexual things
[1:20:20] coming off across the tv
[1:20:22] because that could cause somebody to
[1:20:23] fall fornication adultery
[1:20:25] homosexuality right this day people
[1:20:29] fall to that people in the message i've
[1:20:31] met numerous people the message that
[1:20:32] struggle with homosexuality
[1:20:33] because it's a spirit it's been around
[1:20:36] for
[1:20:37] ever it's been since abraham's day right
[1:20:39] before that
[1:20:41] so people in the message struggle with
[1:20:43] it verse 11 and through thy knowledge
[1:20:46] shall the weak brother perish
[1:20:47] for whom christ died that proves you can
[1:20:50] be
[1:20:51] saved and then lose your salvation just
[1:20:53] like jesus said if you don't
[1:20:54] if you don't repent i've bought your
[1:20:55] name off the book just like the parable
[1:20:58] a sea can fall in there
[1:20:59] satan can snatch it out you can believe
[1:21:01] for a while
[1:21:02] and then lose it we don't want to be the
[1:21:05] people that live
[1:21:06] so loosely that we stumble other people
[1:21:10] right and that's what this revelation
[1:21:12] now this revelation was open up the
[1:21:13] liberty
[1:21:14] but inside the liberty there's
[1:21:16] responsibility
[1:21:17] just like you got the liberty in your
[1:21:19] car you're going to drive home tonight
[1:21:20] but you better
[1:21:21] control that liberty right don't be
[1:21:24] driving 75
[1:21:26] don't be driving 70 you know dude don't
[1:21:28] be driving too fast
[1:21:30] because if you misuse that liberty
[1:21:32] you're going to get an accident
[1:21:35] did i tell you this i got a ticket last
[1:21:36] summer did i tell you i was all in this
[1:21:38] big hurry oh i got to run but i got to
[1:21:40] deposit the church
[1:21:41] giving or something like that i drove a
[1:21:43] 45 and a 25.
[1:21:46] and i had to pay the fine i used my
[1:21:51] i didn't i didn't take care of my
[1:21:52] liberty if i tell you i felt about that
[1:21:54] big guy
[1:21:56] you know he's like oh you're you're a
[1:21:57] teacher and a pastor huh
[1:21:59] yeah yeah i was in a hurry sir
[1:22:02] and he didn't he didn't let me off the
[1:22:03] hook oh then we went with brother brooks
[1:22:06] or brother brooks oh
[1:22:07] i mean i should say that i'll tell you
[1:22:09] afterwards in other words brother brooks
[1:22:10] got off the hook
[1:22:12] it was god's grace he was turning and he
[1:22:15] turned and it was a two-lane turn a
[1:22:16] two-lane turn
[1:22:18] he wouldn't mind if i told this and he
[1:22:19] was in that we were in the inside lane
[1:22:21] and he was talking to me maybe i
[1:22:22] distract him he went to the outer lane
[1:22:24] and all of a sudden a cop slammed on his
[1:22:27] break
[1:22:28] he would have hit the cop so the cop
[1:22:31] pulled us over
[1:22:32] and he said i'm sorry sir and the cop
[1:22:33] said i'm not going to give you a ticket
[1:22:35] this time i'm just giving you a warning
[1:22:39] he almost hit a cop and i was right
[1:22:40] there in there
[1:22:42] that's grace that's grace when a cop
[1:22:45] lets you off the hook
[1:22:47] see that's one of those blessings of
[1:22:48] being a christian
[1:22:53] oh yeah i forgot about that love you
[1:22:55] buddy i love brother books i love
[1:22:57] he probably will watch it anyway we just
[1:22:59] gotta be honest you know we just gotta
[1:23:00] be honest
[1:23:04] now when you sing it when you sin
[1:23:05] against the weak brethren you sin
[1:23:06] against christ now i love verse 13
[1:23:08] wherefore if meat make my brother to
[1:23:10] offend i will eat no flesh
[1:23:13] while the world standeth
[1:23:16] lest i make my brother to offend
[1:23:21] while this world's standing now church
[1:23:22] you know how long this world's going to
[1:23:24] stand
[1:23:25] it's always going to stand it's going to
[1:23:28] stand for eternity
[1:23:30] so paul's saying i will never ever do
[1:23:32] anything in my christian liberty
[1:23:34] that includes your words some of our
[1:23:38] jokes
[1:23:40] our food our physical appearance
[1:23:44] our hobbies what we eat
[1:23:48] all of those things i'll never do any of
[1:23:50] those if it would cause a weak christian
[1:23:52] to stumble
[1:23:54] now is that love or what that's love
[1:23:58] so in his case maybe he would say i'll
[1:24:00] never eat meat
[1:24:02] publicly because i don't want to cause a
[1:24:04] christian to stumble
[1:24:06] wow now for us it's for brother jessie
[1:24:10] it's i'll never drink
[1:24:11] wine in public no i like to taste the
[1:24:14] wine i don't know some
[1:24:15] my kids have talked about they don't
[1:24:16] like i like the taste of our wine but
[1:24:18] you know what
[1:24:19] i'm not i've never drinking one drop
[1:24:21] outside the house of god you know why i
[1:24:22] do that
[1:24:23] for the week's sake for the benjamins
[1:24:26] austins people that come in
[1:24:28] and fall away because i would hate to
[1:24:30] give them an excuse
[1:24:31] to leave because of my liberties that
[1:24:34] i'm not keeping i've never done it
[1:24:38] now i know people that do because their
[1:24:40] stomach hurts that's fine
[1:24:42] that's what the bible says that's okay
[1:24:44] but never do anything
[1:24:45] that would cause somebody to stumble and
[1:24:47] the church said amen
[1:24:49] now we're closing with this we're going
[1:24:52] to get to this revelation this
[1:24:53] revelation
[1:24:54] breaks down all the discrimination it's
[1:24:57] the elimination of discrimination
[1:25:01] peter battled this he was racist for a
[1:25:04] while
[1:25:05] with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:25:08] racist in the sense that i mean he
[1:25:10] wouldn't eat with gentiles
[1:25:12] we don't know how long this lasted but
[1:25:13] god had to send a holy ghost-filled
[1:25:15] prophet
[1:25:17] and rebuke him right to his face and say
[1:25:19] why aren't you eating
[1:25:20] with those spanish or mexican people can
[1:25:22] i say can i just bring him make every
[1:25:24] why don't you eat with those half
[1:25:25] spanish people
[1:25:28] why don't you eat with the asian people
[1:25:30] why aren't you eating
[1:25:32] peter oh my goodness
[1:25:36] i didn't realize that that church let me
[1:25:38] tell you the racism that we battled
[1:25:40] today james talked about it he said a
[1:25:43] rich person will come in and you'll
[1:25:44] treat him really good
[1:25:47] see how racism sneaks into the church
[1:25:50] have you ever smelled some people that
[1:25:52] come into the church sometimes they
[1:25:54] don't smell very good like visitors
[1:25:56] we've had visitors that don't smell too
[1:25:58] good do you think people want to sit by
[1:25:59] them
[1:26:00] do you think people want to talk to them
[1:26:02] it ain't easy but that's a form if we
[1:26:05] purposely separate ourselves from them
[1:26:07] because they smell
[1:26:08] they don't have as nice clothes as
[1:26:10] brother jesse or brother sister
[1:26:11] so-and-so
[1:26:13] that's discrimination and that's not the
[1:26:15] christ in fact the bible says the
[1:26:17] opposite you're supposed to go to them
[1:26:22] don't make a special trip because
[1:26:24] somebody's famous is here
[1:26:26] somebody that we know someone that's
[1:26:28] rich don't treat them any better
[1:26:30] than you treat the poor person or the
[1:26:34] person that don't have as nice as
[1:26:35] clothes as you
[1:26:36] or the person who didn't brush his teeth
[1:26:38] i've seen that
[1:26:40] the person that didn't floss the person
[1:26:43] don't get me wrong you don't want to get
[1:26:44] too close to those people right they
[1:26:46] might have germs but you still have to
[1:26:48] show them god's love right
[1:26:50] and are they going to have gingivitis
[1:26:51] they might are they going to have you
[1:26:52] know
[1:26:53] they can have cavities and lose their
[1:26:54] teeth they might
[1:26:57] but our attitude it can't be anything
[1:27:00] that exalts us
[1:27:01] above other people the love of christ
[1:27:03] has to constrain
[1:27:05] us to love all of god's people
[1:27:08] that jesus christ is the door and he
[1:27:09] said if any man
[1:27:12] we have to remember this man or this
[1:27:13] dirty man or woman they might
[1:27:15] come into the door of christ and we've
[1:27:17] got to be there on the other side saying
[1:27:19] come on in
[1:27:20] there's nice green pastures over here
[1:27:22] come on and feast on this one i'm
[1:27:23] beasting on you're going to love this
[1:27:26] that's the end of our feet praise god
[1:27:29] aren't you glad for the elimination of
[1:27:31] discrimination
[1:27:33] musicians can come by god's grace
[1:27:36] i love how the word of god is constantly
[1:27:39] opening to us
[1:27:41] some of these things we never we never
[1:27:43] would have considered unless the holy
[1:27:44] ghost would take us that direction
[1:27:47] how we sometimes battle discrimination
[1:27:50] right
[1:27:51] we think we're better than other people
[1:27:56] we must never think that can you stop
[1:27:58] the live stream god bless you i just
[1:27:59] want to say a few things
