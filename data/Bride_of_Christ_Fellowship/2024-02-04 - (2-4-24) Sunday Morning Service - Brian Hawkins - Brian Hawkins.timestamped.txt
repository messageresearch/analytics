[25:28] amen praise the Lord praise the Lord
[25:32] amen God is
[25:33] good all the time uh before I get
[25:37] started I just wanted to thank you all I
[25:40] just wanted to greet you all uh from
[25:43] Brother Jim and all the brothers and
[25:45] sisters back uh East so far away but uh
[25:51] they all send their greetings and one
[25:52] that wanted would have liked to have
[25:55] said it he's here in person so
[25:59] and
[26:01] uh let's see if you would uh let's turn
[26:04] to Revelations chapter
[26:08] 18 said okay if we just talk about some
[26:10] things this morning uh just might might
[26:14] not be preaching like we're like you're
[26:16] used to but
[26:19] uh might be some readings some people
[26:21] don't like when people or when preachers
[26:24] read things they would much rather them
[26:26] flow with the with the Holy Spirit of
[26:28] the preaching and I like that too but
[26:30] some some things that I want to take out
[26:32] of the message as far as
[26:35] quotes uh that supports what I want to
[26:38] talk about this
[26:40] morning I might have spoken on this here
[26:43] before I can't remember uh but if I did
[26:47] my apologies if I didn't well praise the
[26:50] Lord but if it didn't bear repeating it
[26:52] shouldn't have been preached in the
[26:53] first place right so uh just kind of
[26:57] having a struggle uh yesterday this
[27:00] morning and uh I believe this is where
[27:03] the the Lord wants me to be to speak on
[27:06] this morning so
[27:08] uh you know how in the scripture that
[27:11] we're
[27:13] uh with the children of Israel that all
[27:15] the the land was being divvied out or
[27:18] the Lord said something about uh giving
[27:20] the uh each each tribe their portion but
[27:24] he if you notice the Levites did not
[27:27] have a portion of land uh they did not
[27:30] get the material part of it but uh and
[27:32] the Levites we know are the are the
[27:34] priests and uh so we're called to a
[27:38] royal priesthood as it says in in 1
[27:40] Peter 2:9 that we're a holy nation a
[27:43] priesthood but the whole point of of of
[27:46] the Levites was that their portion was
[27:49] God he himself said I am your portion
[27:52] and that is good enough right so my
[27:54] grace is sufficient for thee so I think
[27:56] of the same thing in this hour that we
[27:58] are called to be a royal priesthood that
[28:01] our portion is God our portion is not
[28:03] the things of the world it's not the
[28:05] riches of the world uh it's not the
[28:07] wisdom of the world but it's all in the
[28:09] spiritual treasures and the blessings of
[28:12] the Lord amen amen so let's uh
[28:16] Revelation chapter 18 uh starting in the
[28:19] first
[28:21] verse Oh yall know by now that I'm
[28:24] nowhere near being perfect right so
[28:28] uh and I'm I'm depending solely on the
[28:31] holy spirit this morning uh that the
[28:34] Lord would be uh gracious enough uh uh
[28:38] to us this morning we're people of
[28:40] Second Chances but we've probably had
[28:43] hundreds if not thousands of Second
[28:45] Chances amen so just thankful for the
[28:49] god of Mercy this morning and every day
[28:52] every
[28:53] morning first first verse it says and
[28:56] after these things I saw another Angel
[28:58] come down from heaven having great power
[29:01] and the Earth was lightened with his
[29:02] glory and he cried mightily with a
[29:05] strong voice saying Babylon the great is
[29:07] Fallen is fallen and has become the
[29:11] habitation of
[29:13] devils and the hold of every foul spirit
[29:17] and a cage of every unclean and hateful
[29:21] bird so we see this is a a
[29:24] demonic uh at atmosphere or whatever
[29:28] it's been loosed for the the demons to
[29:31] be and uh we are in their presence they
[29:34] they're just and and that's what's
[29:36] around us but it's up to us to overcome
[29:38] those things so uh for all the nations
[29:41] have drunk of the wine of the wrath of
[29:44] her fornication and the kings of the
[29:46] Earth have committed uh fornication with
[29:51] her so and and the kings are are leaders
[29:55] so we we have the different you know the
[29:56] president of the United States the prime
[29:58] ministers things like that th those are
[30:00] the kings of of of the Nations and
[30:02] they've all part partaken with all these
[30:06] evil spirits uh the habitation of devils
[30:10] right so they they've they've
[30:12] partaken uh with her in that fornication
[30:16] and the kings of the Earth have
[30:18] committed fornication with her and the
[30:20] merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich
[30:22] through the abundance of her Delicacies
[30:25] so not just the kings of the nation but
[30:27] also the merchants those are your
[30:29] businesses you know uh things like uh uh
[30:32] I I can't even think of Tesla and uh
[30:37] Walmart and different things like that
[30:39] all these all these businesses these big
[30:42] corporations uh your 401 your your
[30:45] financial advisers and all these people
[30:47] have also taken uh part with that evil
[30:51] uh fornications with all of these with
[30:55] Babylon as it's talking about
[30:57] uh with the habitation of devils and the
[31:00] hold of uh every foul spirit so we see
[31:03] uh what's prevalent in this day is the
[31:06] wickedness uh there's corruption in in
[31:08] politicians there's corruption in
[31:09] business so you could see in the
[31:12] scripture how very much applies in this
[31:15] day of of of those that are trying to uh
[31:19] take control of society in this day so
[31:23] verse four it says and I heard another
[31:26] voice from heaven saying come out of her
[31:28] my people that's us uh that you be not
[31:31] partakers of her sins and that ye
[31:33] receive not of her plagues he's saying
[31:35] come out of her my people we just talked
[31:37] about that we are the Lord's portion so
[31:39] we are his people so if you are his
[31:43] people then this applies to you come out
[31:45] of those things we're not to partake of
[31:47] those things for her sins have reached
[31:49] unto heaven and God hath remembered her
[31:54] iniquities reward her even as she
[31:57] rewarded
[31:58] you and double unto her double according
[32:01] to her works in the cup which she hath
[32:04] filled fill to her double how much she
[32:08] hath glorified herself and lived
[32:11] deliciously so much uh torment and
[32:14] sorrow give her for she saith in her
[32:16] heart I sit a queen and am no Widow and
[32:20] shall see no
[32:21] sorrow therefore shall her plagues uh
[32:24] come in one day death and mourning and
[32:27] in famine and she shall be utterly
[32:29] burned with fire for strong is the Lord
[32:32] who judgeth her for we know he is mighty
[32:35] mightier than the mightiest amen let's
[32:37] look to the Lord in prayer most gracious
[32:40] heavenly father I just want to thank you
[32:42] one more time for all the blessings that
[32:44] you give unto us we thank you for the
[32:45] privilege that we could stand here
[32:46] before your people to minister your word
[32:49] but father without you I am absolutely
[32:51] nothing but Lord we just call upon the
[32:53] name of Jesus Christ that you would come
[32:55] and that you would speak to your people
[32:56] through me oh God help me to get to step
[32:59] aside and uh just let your voice uh
[33:03] speak uh this morning and help us that
[33:06] uh the people would be blessed and uh
[33:09] that we could say truly it has been good
[33:11] to be in the house of the Lord this
[33:12] morning for Lord we love to come to
[33:14] worship we love to come sing songs onto
[33:16] you and uh Lord we love to hear your
[33:18] word so father we just pray that uh we
[33:21] could be uh a blessing because we have
[33:24] been blessed by so much Lord in Jesus
[33:26] Christ's name we do pray amen you may be
[33:30] seated uh this morning what I'd like to
[33:32] to speak on is uh
[33:36] demonology uh and recognizing
[33:40] Spirits
[33:44] uh see in verse three and now I don't
[33:47] have all Revelation I can't explain
[33:49] everything in here but uh those those
[33:52] things that the Lord gives me those
[33:54] that's what I'll speak on so verse three
[33:56] it says says for all nations have drunk
[33:58] of the wine of the wrath of her
[33:59] fornication and the kings of the Earth
[34:02] have committed fornication with her and
[34:03] the merchants of the Earth are waxed
[34:05] Rich through the abundance of her
[34:07] Delicacies see it's her strength
[34:10] possibly her wealth her luxuries uh but
[34:13] if you notice the the stronghold that uh
[34:17] the rich have on people uh I guess you
[34:20] could say especially upon the poor
[34:22] people in this day and it just uh seems
[34:24] like it's uh oppressive
[34:28] uh the huge difference between the rich
[34:30] people and the poor people
[34:33] so uh just because of the amount of
[34:35] money that they have and the Mighty
[34:37] Dollar it makes many people crumble
[34:39] right so if some people have a an issue
[34:42] with gambling and they might come into
[34:44] some money and then they lose the money
[34:46] of course that gambling is a very
[34:48] terrible uh investment option uh because
[34:51] it can it can come you might be able to
[34:54] win some but you're going to lose some
[34:55] too you're going to lose big big uh so
[34:58] that's not a very sound investing advice
[35:01] is to go to casinos but it's it's
[35:04] definitely not a place for a Believer
[35:06] amen so talking about the the the
[35:10] strength of the rich uh but the uh the
[35:15] scripture tells us that it's it's not
[35:17] money that is evil but is the it's the
[35:19] love of money that is the root of all
[35:21] evil right so uh with money it also
[35:25] there also comes power so with that
[35:27] power uh uh character without power is
[35:32] satanic right but uh Power with
[35:35] character is fit to rule we we believe
[35:37] that we understand that so uh those that
[35:40] have power tend to uh don't have the The
[35:43] Godly character uh so they tend to run
[35:48] people over uh with their riches right
[35:50] and then they try to gain all that power
[35:53] and it's all uh through a demonic power
[35:56] because because they they just want
[35:57] control now if you had a believer in uh
[36:00] as the richest person in the world a
[36:02] True Believer they would try to uh share
[36:05] their money with people right at the
[36:07] same time to make uh the good
[36:09] Investments that they can continue to
[36:11] have their money to grow that they can
[36:12] continue to share you know so um that
[36:17] that's just how if if if you give all
[36:19] your money away and then you have no way
[36:20] to get get a return to give more money
[36:22] away than uh I mean it's it's a great
[36:25] sacrifice we read in the scripture about
[36:27] the woman that gave her last two mites
[36:29] right so uh you have that but if there's
[36:32] if there's a continual blessing then God
[36:34] has to be in it and and uh so with the
[36:37] money you make more money I don't know
[36:38] why I'm getting on money but uh but the
[36:42] understanding with the riches and the
[36:43] Treasures of the world that it uh that
[36:46] with that comes power and with that
[36:49] power comes pride and it invites all
[36:52] kinds of demonic spirits and and Devils
[36:55] right so uh it's it's like I was saying
[36:58] or like the scripture says it's the love
[37:00] of money that's the root of all evil
[37:02] because that that we call that greed
[37:04] right because you want more you want
[37:06] more so how much is a how much is enough
[37:09] to a rich person is is you know $100,000
[37:12] enough or or today and by today's
[37:15] standards $100,000 doesn't constitute
[37:17] somebody being rich apparently so you
[37:19] have millionaires you have uh
[37:21] billionaires trillionaires you know how
[37:23] much is enough for these people but they
[37:26] continue they don't say well I've got
[37:28] three3 trillion doll and that's enough
[37:30] for me you know even a billionaire
[37:33] they're not going to say three billion
[37:34] dollars is enough for me but they
[37:36] continue to try to make more because
[37:39] they're trying to compete against the
[37:40] other guy that's the richest guy in the
[37:42] world so they're trying to make more so
[37:44] they're worth more than the other guy
[37:46] see and and that it's just a a
[37:48] competitive
[37:49] spirit and and and it's just like uh uh
[37:53] in in the scripture where the disciples
[37:55] were arguing f Ing and and uh just at
[37:58] one another because they were arguing
[38:00] well I'm the greatest no I'm the
[38:01] greatest and it's just that there's so
[38:04] much of that in this day I know brother
[38:06] Jesse's talked about it uh for him and I
[38:08] have talked about it so I'm pretty sure
[38:10] he's talked about it over the pulpit
[38:12] about uh the goat uh uh you know the
[38:15] greatest of all time and people are
[38:17] looking so much of of who's the greatest
[38:20] of all time I don't care what history of
[38:23] NFL player NBA player uh Major League
[38:26] baseball I don't care because Solomon
[38:28] was great but there's one greater than
[38:30] Solomon that is here amen see there's
[38:32] none greater than the Lord Jesus Christ
[38:34] so that's the one that I want to look to
[38:36] that's who I want to be my example amen
[38:39] so it it's just a rat race of somebody
[38:42] trying to be better than the other
[38:44] instead of trying to serve the other you
[38:46] know the Lord Jesus told us that if if
[38:48] the one that's greatest among you him
[38:50] shall be your servant not to not to
[38:53] exercise Dominion uh the scripture also
[38:56] teaches us to be not many Masters right
[38:59] uh to not have control over people but
[39:01] in treat one another as brother and
[39:03] sister you know having love for one
[39:05] another not treating somebody as a slave
[39:07] not treating somebody uh be con being
[39:10] condescending to somebody or patronizing
[39:12] you know looking down your nose at
[39:14] somebody and saying I'm greater than
[39:15] that person you know each one of us has
[39:19] our strengths our weaknesses we could
[39:20] look at somebody and say man I'm I'm
[39:22] glad I'm not going through that but the
[39:24] Lord has put something in their life
[39:26] that trust he trusted them to go through
[39:28] whatever
[39:29] situation you know the same thing with
[39:31] us whenever we go through a trial he's
[39:33] entrusting us to overcome right so it is
[39:36] to show forth Jesus Christ not to show
[39:38] that we have any power for we don't have
[39:40] any power right but we have the
[39:42] authority through the spoken word of
[39:43] Jesus Christ he said if you'll ask
[39:45] anything in my name amen so uh that's
[39:49] where it's it's not a competitive thing
[39:51] but it's a it's a love thing it's it's
[39:54] not a race of of who's going to be
[39:56] greatest of all we're not worried about
[39:58] who the greatest of all is except one
[40:01] amen so uh then it becomes it becomes a
[40:04] prideful thing this whole Rat Race thing
[40:06] and and through the whole race it takes
[40:08] people further and further away from God
[40:11] and we don't want that right because our
[40:12] heart is to draw closer unto God Amen so
[40:16] in in verse
[40:18] four uh it it's just saying and I heard
[40:21] another voice see there are many voices
[40:23] in this in this day but we got to focus
[40:25] on one voice voice we are sheep we are
[40:27] listening to the voice of Our Shepherd
[40:29] right so and I heard another voice from
[40:31] Heaven saying come out of her my people
[40:34] that you be not partakers of her sins
[40:36] and that you receive not of her plagues
[40:38] see if you partake of what she's doing
[40:40] you're
[40:41] partaking of her plagues right uh you're
[40:44] going to partake of her sins so if you
[40:46] were following after that influence
[40:48] that's going to lead you down to the
[40:50] path of the right wide right or wide
[40:54] left right so but we want want to say
[40:56] straight
[40:57] on
[41:04] so I know this is not the greatest of
[41:07] subjects that people like to talk about
[41:09] but uh I I don't like talking about it
[41:11] myself uh but this is
[41:14] it's what I was called out of uh but I
[41:18] think we take it too lightly when we
[41:20] talk about Witchcraft and we talk about
[41:22] demons uh that it's just a POS thing but
[41:26] look what's out there you have your
[41:28] Harry Potter uh you have all these
[41:30] different things that uh are lifted up
[41:34] if if you would and uh even even
[41:37] Christians are saying oh I love Harry
[41:39] Potter you should you should despise
[41:41] Harry
[41:42] Potter because it it it it tries to uh
[41:47] what's the word I want to try to say
[41:48] disseminate is is the word that comes to
[41:50] my mind I'm not sure if that's the right
[41:52] it it tries to undermine what the Lord
[41:54] is and everything that the Lord has done
[41:56] and we know that's that's what the
[41:57] adversary does is he he takes everything
[42:00] that the Lord made and he perverts it
[42:03] right he makes it uh look at Harry
[42:05] Potter of how cool it looks right they
[42:07] they try to make it look look so great
[42:09] and look so cool that all the kids flock
[42:11] to it and that's and that's what it is
[42:13] see brother brandom said sin is
[42:15] beautiful right sin is a pretty thing
[42:18] but that's not what what we want to look
[42:19] look at right we want to look at the
[42:23] outcome of of uh an influence right and
[42:26] we want it to be a positive thing you
[42:28] know uh how many believes that demons
[42:31] are real beings you know so it it it's
[42:35] it's a real it's not a it's not a
[42:37] mythological thing or some uh something
[42:40] that uh parents talk to their kids at at
[42:43] night to try to scare them to go to
[42:44] sleep you know it's it's not anything
[42:47] like that or isn't that a terrible thing
[42:49] if our parents try to uh some parents
[42:51] not all parents they try to scare their
[42:53] children uh in in some respects we
[42:55] should teach them
[42:57] uh respect but using things like demons
[43:00] and and uh you know evil things to try
[43:03] to scare them into obedience that
[43:06] shouldn't be right because we should
[43:08] teach in everything let it be done in
[43:10] love right with the admonition and the
[43:12] nurture of the Lord so this is not
[43:15] something that's outdated or
[43:17] oldfashioned as some people like to to
[43:19] portray it uh but evil spirits are
[43:22] everywhere and in everything everything
[43:24] that we do see we're stuck in this
[43:27] carnality right so we're we're stuck in
[43:29] this flesh so it's a constant battle we
[43:32] every we go to the store we go to work
[43:34] we go to school uh wherever we're going
[43:38] just down the street whatever it is
[43:39] there are spirits that we're battling
[43:42] there are spirits that we're
[43:43] entertaining there are spirits that
[43:45] we're we're trying to Cast Away right so
[43:47] we're trying to cast evil away so we
[43:51] know that Spirits can be in
[43:53] animals right because we know that Jes
[43:56] Jesus cast uh the the evil spirits into
[43:59] the swine and they and they ran into the
[44:01] water and perished right uh but you also
[44:04] have God as a spirit when he when uh
[44:07] when balam was having a hard time with
[44:09] the donkey because he was out of the
[44:10] will of the Lord and then the the angel
[44:12] of the Lord was in the way of the donkey
[44:15] and Bam balum was whooping his donkey
[44:17] and then uh the the donkey tried to go
[44:19] somewhere else and just everywhere he
[44:22] tried to go the angel of the Lord was in
[44:24] the way and just beating him and beating
[44:26] him balum was beating his donkey because
[44:28] he was disobedient but the lord gave him
[44:30] power to open his mouth to speak what
[44:32] have I done to you balam have and you
[44:34] know I'm not like this I've always I've
[44:37] always been obedient I've always taken
[44:39] you places where you wanted wanted me to
[44:41] go but then you see the Lord opened up
[44:44] this the donkey's mouth to give a rebuke
[44:46] unto baam boy wouldn't that be something
[44:49] to being rebuked by your dog or your
[44:51] kitty cat you
[44:53] know but we ought to be able to discern
[44:56] between good and evil be far from us
[44:58] that it would be so low that our dog or
[45:01] our cat would have to rebuke us because
[45:03] we can't see the spiritual
[45:06] realm but like I said demons are
[45:10] real and this is a quote that brother
[45:12] brand talks about he says friends they
[45:13] are just as real as you are real and I
[45:16] see them many times when they leave
[45:18] right from this platform here I see them
[45:20] some of them in the shape of bats they
[45:23] look look like long hairs hanging on
[45:25] their legs leg but an epileptic demon
[45:29] looks like a tortoise with round legs
[45:31] hanging up like that however he's doing
[45:33] it um but usually a demon of Oppression
[45:36] seems to be more of a cloud form like a
[45:39] wave and it just makes a real funny
[45:41] sound when you're in that other
[45:43] dimension to see the spirit see we
[45:47] aren't able to see the spirits like
[45:49] brother Brandon was there are some
[45:50] people that could see spirits but not
[45:52] everyone uh and be careful what you ask
[45:55] ask for cuz you just might get it but I
[45:57] don't I'm not sure if I want to see the
[45:59] the spirit cuz it probably give me a
[46:02] heart attack it' probably scare
[46:04] me but he says now you may think that's
[46:07] wrong but some of these days you'll
[46:09] realize if you can only take a spiritual
[46:11] Looking Glass and look into your soul
[46:14] you doubt and you find find out what it
[46:17] looks like and the greatest devil you
[46:20] hearing the greatest devil and the chief
[46:24] of all Devils is UN
[46:26] belief he says that's the only sin there
[46:29] is there's no other sin but unbelief all
[46:31] these little morals and things smoking
[46:33] drinking gambling and committing
[46:34] adultery that's just attributes you do
[46:37] that because you don't
[46:40] believe unbelief is what makes you do
[46:42] that if you was a Believer you wouldn't
[46:44] do that right he says now it's
[46:49] uh it's just like I think the gifts of
[46:52] the Spirit the gifts of the Spirit is
[46:54] not the Holy Ghost
[46:56] it is a gift but it's not the
[46:59] gifts right so the gifts of the holy
[47:01] spirit is not the Holy Ghost it's the
[47:04] attributes of the Holy Ghost see Gifts
[47:06] of healing speaking in tongues and all
[47:07] those other things are attributes of
[47:10] having the holy spirit it's a fruit that
[47:12] the tree Bears see the trees the main
[47:15] thing we're looking at the tree we're
[47:17] not focused on the branches but the main
[47:20] Life Source is in the tree and then the
[47:22] life extends unto the branches
[47:27] amen no wonder Jesus said I am the vine
[47:29] and you are the branches because he is
[47:31] the lifegiving
[47:35] source and the Holy Spirit is God and
[47:38] God is love now I'm speaking directly to
[47:40] Christians so that you could see the pro
[47:42] and con the negative and the positive
[47:44] where there's anybody asked you then you
[47:46] can give them an
[47:47] answer uh now of everything that God has
[47:50] the devil has a counterfeit we know that
[47:52] right you go and whatever you want to do
[47:55] uh you you find these old uh dances
[47:58] that's of the
[48:02] devil but he says but God has a holy
[48:05] dance for the people see from that Holy
[48:09] dance the adversary perverted it to an
[48:11] ungodly dance a a a dance of perversion
[48:16] a a a dance of uh provocative uh
[48:20] influence I guess you could say and
[48:22] that's not what we
[48:24] want but if we dance we dance in the
[48:26] Holy Spirit a Godly dance amen so he
[48:30] says but God has a holy dance for the
[48:32] people the Bible said so and and brother
[48:34] Brandon says this I was one of the
[48:36] greatest Critics on that you ever seen
[48:38] till God told me just what to do I find
[48:40] out that Miriam danced in the spirit
[48:43] David danced when he had Victory all of
[48:45] it was through victory see through
[48:49] victory we dance through victory we
[48:52] worship through victory we give praise
[48:55] am amen it was dancing holy dancing for
[48:59] instance in the Bible if a dreamer
[49:01] dreamed a dream or a prophet prophesied
[49:04] they had a plate called the
[49:06] UR that went over the breast of Aaron
[49:08] and when they went before this plate and
[49:10] spoke in them lights flashed on the
[49:12] plate God would sanction it that it was
[49:14] the truth is that right if it didn't
[49:16] speak on there then it was wrong now
[49:19] look the the devil come around in a
[49:21] pattern of that took a crystal ball see
[49:24] everything that God has everything in
[49:26] the natural types the spiritual and he
[49:29] says I know I'm a typologist and I
[49:31] believe that every natural thing types
[49:33] the spiritual don't you and it goes
[49:36] right over the audience and almighty God
[49:39] excuse me it goes right over the
[49:41] audience and almighty God who we're
[49:43] preaching about and surely to be in the
[49:45] deepest of sincerity I seen those things
[49:47] move over the audience and I've seen
[49:50] them sometimes when the congregation
[49:51] will be just in one
[49:53] Accord in one Accord right
[49:56] uh that they'd see that thing themselves
[49:58] many times hundreds and hundreds of
[50:00] people would see it
[50:02] move see when we're in one mind one
[50:04] Accord when we get caught up into the
[50:07] spiritual realm we get to see things
[50:10] spiritually the Lord will open our eyes
[50:12] just like a ha ey
[50:14] right and he says
[50:17] uh and therefore must take the very
[50:20] deepest of sincerity it isn't a bluff
[50:23] you can't Bluff the devil at all he
[50:25] won't Bluff but whenever you really can
[50:27] produce the blood of Jesus Christ Satan
[50:30] can't stand before that now that is just
[50:35] true I see but when you when you really
[50:37] can't produce the blood of Jesus Christ
[50:40] Satan can't stand before that and that's
[50:44] where we rest amen for Jesus Christ is
[50:46] our rest we rest in that blood that was
[50:49] shed for us you know brother Jim was
[50:51] preaching here uh this this was last
[50:53] year when I think last year when I
[50:55] preached this and I just had a little
[50:57] side note in
[50:59] here and I was set to preach that
[51:02] evening and I had this thought on my
[51:04] mind and uh I was I
[51:07] was probably not the right thing to do
[51:09] but sometimes that's that's what happens
[51:11] you're thinking about you know if you're
[51:14] going to be preaching in the evening
[51:15] you're kind of thinking about what
[51:16] you're going to be preaching on even
[51:18] when somebody else is preaching but how
[51:20] terrible is that right you're supposed
[51:21] to be focused but uh you know something
[51:25] just sparked the thought in my mind and
[51:26] I was thinking about rules and uh you
[51:30] know we we have people amongst us I'm
[51:32] not saying here in church but people uh
[51:35] through this world they just don't like
[51:37] rules okay uh they don't want to comply
[51:40] they don't want to be obedient to they
[51:43] they don't want to be subject to
[51:45] something else having control over them
[51:48] all right so but scripture teaches us
[51:50] that Rebellion is as the sin of
[51:53] Witchcraft Rebellion is as witchcraft
[51:56] how many how many wants to
[51:58] rebel I don't want to be rebellious
[52:00] because I don't want to go back to witch
[52:02] witchcraft from where I was called
[52:05] from
[52:07] so
[52:13] uh everybody like
[52:16] games you're in the front row so I guess
[52:19] I'll be picking on
[52:21] you you ready to play a
[52:23] game okay it's your move go
[52:29] ahead okay so I don't know you tell me
[52:33] what what are we playing I'm in control
[52:35] of this but you tell me what the rules
[52:40] are you don't know what the rules are
[52:42] right you got to know what the rules are
[52:44] to be able to play the
[52:46] game you see so people want to do these
[52:50] things they they want to do what they
[52:51] want but they still fall under rules you
[52:54] want to live as an American citizen you
[52:56] got to follow under rules if you want to
[52:58] live down in Mexico you got rules to
[53:00] follow whether it's the government or
[53:02] the cartel one or the other but you're
[53:03] going to have rules to
[53:05] follow you go to Italy you're going to
[53:07] have to follow
[53:08] rules I don't like this country I got to
[53:11] get out of here because I don't like the
[53:12] rules what's stopping you but if you try
[53:16] to go to another country you have to
[53:18] fill out all the proper paperwork you
[53:20] have to go through all the the the red
[53:22] tape that you got to go through here so
[53:24] it's the same thing everywhere we go
[53:27] there's a set of rules we fall under
[53:30] law right so we are governed by
[53:36] something but what is it that we let
[53:38] govern
[53:43] us but see you might not like or want
[53:46] rules but that's what we're governed by
[53:49] between good and evil demon demons know
[53:51] the rules of
[53:52] engagement they know that they could go
[53:54] so
[53:56] far before that line is drawn and the
[53:58] Lord tells him uhh you can't touch my
[54:03] people amen just like job Satan was
[54:06] saying oh if it wasn't for all these
[54:09] riches and you spoil him if if you took
[54:11] everything away he would leave you right
[54:14] but we know that that the Lord used job
[54:17] even though he took his children took
[54:18] his cattle took his money pretty much
[54:20] stripped him of everything that he
[54:22] had but he never cursed God
[54:25] amen he stayed true he kept the
[54:29] faith amen so no matter what adversity
[54:32] we go through that doesn't mean that the
[54:34] Lord has left
[54:36] us the Lord is still there
[54:41] amen but see even the demons knew the
[54:43] Rules of Engagement see when uh when
[54:46] when Jesus would go about and he would
[54:48] uh go about for the healings or the
[54:50] teaching to the people you would notice
[54:52] when you read through the evil spirits
[54:54] would come come up and say
[54:56] hey this here is the
[55:00] Christ the son of God and what did he
[55:03] tell him be quiet now is not my time
[55:07] it'll be my time soon enough see they
[55:09] was trying to ruin his plan trying to
[55:11] trying to ruin God's plan trying to
[55:14] expose things early but he still had
[55:17] power over those
[55:19] Spirits so all men are influenced by one
[55:22] side or the other so you have God's side
[55:26] Heaven which is the you know the third
[55:27] heaven 2 Corinthians 12:12 it talks us
[55:30] about the third heaven so it's beyond
[55:32] the solar system then you have Angelic
[55:35] beings which is the second heaven which
[55:38] is the solar system okay Christ which is
[55:41] the Holy Spirit the influence of of the
[55:44] believer going upward first Heaven that
[55:47] is the clouds in the Earthly atmosphere
[55:49] then you have Satan's side spirits of
[55:52] the Dead the Wicked unregenerated Man
[55:55] and then you have demons and then you
[55:57] have hell so you have Heaven and Hell
[56:00] and you have everything in between which
[56:02] is a constant battle between one
[56:04] another everybody okay this morning so
[56:07] brother brand says this I I told you I
[56:09] had some things to to read so bear with
[56:12] me uh he says now let me just show you a
[56:15] simple thing friend now the first thing
[56:17] that if if the two Spirits Jesus said in
[56:19] the last days course some Demon Spirits
[56:21] is arising sure they are we we we see it
[56:24] we see the may be uh becoming more and
[56:26] more wicked and and then each day we
[56:28] wake up man how much more wicked be
[56:31] careful what you ask for how much more
[56:33] wicked is this going to get before we
[56:35] get called home I don't want to see more
[56:37] wickedness but we know that it's going
[56:39] to come it's a vexation of our spirit
[56:42] it's a vexation of our soul because we
[56:44] long to be somewhere else because we are
[56:46] of another Spirit he says of course some
[56:49] Demon Spirits is arising sure they are
[56:51] they've always been here uh they will be
[56:54] until Jesus comes and they live right in
[56:56] people and people don't know it and see
[57:00] that's the issue is people don't
[57:01] recognize the spirit that they are under
[57:04] they can't recognize when that demon
[57:06] Spirit comes in and then they're Bound
[57:09] by that Spirit and the person can't
[57:11] recognize it and that's where they're
[57:13] and then they're a servant to that
[57:15] demonic spirit and then they do things
[57:18] that they don't want to do because they
[57:19] are a servant to this thing that demon
[57:22] that now has control over them
[57:26] and then all of a sudden they start
[57:28] cussing or they might start smoking or
[57:32] they might start doing something else
[57:34] and it's not in them to do that because
[57:36] they've been
[57:37] changed from an unbeliever to a
[57:40] Believer but yet somehow they get caught
[57:43] under a
[57:45] demon spirit and then they do things
[57:48] that they don't want to do that
[57:51] something that that uh uh when they when
[57:53] they finally come to the realization hey
[57:56] I'm under this demonic Force why am I
[57:58] doing these things I don't want to do
[58:00] that that's not my heart see the Lord
[58:02] knows what's on your heart
[58:04] amen see he says uh they've always been
[58:08] here they will be until Jesus comes and
[58:10] they live right in people and people
[58:12] don't know it they give them unclean
[58:14] habits and sicknesses and diseases and
[58:16] all kinds everything everything is
[58:19] caused by a
[58:21] spirit everything that we do is
[58:23] influenced by an evil spirit or a godly
[58:26] Spirit everything is caused by a spirit
[58:30] deafness is a spirit did you know that
[58:32] the doctor says that the nerves went
[58:34] dead but what made it go dead what made
[58:37] it go dead the Bible said when the deaf
[58:39] Spirit come out of the man he could hear
[58:41] is that right so it's a
[58:45] spirit a cancer is a spirit a tumor is a
[58:49] spirit all those things epilepsy is a
[58:52] spirit Jesus rebuked the devil the boy
[58:54] with epilepsy and he fell on the ground
[58:56] and had the hardest fit he ever had but
[58:59] when he got over that one he was
[59:01] finished with it amen glory see a lot of
[59:04] them said well he didn't get healed look
[59:07] at him he's got the worst spell he ever
[59:08] had but that was all of them see that
[59:12] was all the rest of them that he was
[59:14] ever going to have and that's why it was
[59:15] the worst one that he
[59:17] had it was all of them accumulative
[59:20] being CAU up out of
[59:23] him it's got to get worse before it gets
[59:26] better
[59:28] amen see it's a spirit amen he says
[59:31] notice now the woman if I gave you uh
[59:35] gave any of you men here tonight a
[59:36] dollar bill and would say uh or excuse
[59:38] me he says if I give you this envelope
[59:40] and I'd say is that a dollar bill why
[59:43] you'd say certainly not the devil's too
[59:45] smart for that but Jesus said the two
[59:47] Spirits be so close together deceive the
[59:50] elect if it were
[59:51] possible then if I give you a dollar
[59:54] bill it would have to look uh uh uh it
[59:57] would have to look a whole lot like a
[59:58] real genuine dollar or you'd recognize
[1:00:01] it right now is that right that's how
[1:00:04] the Devil comes around friends it ain't
[1:00:05] a communistic spirit it's an antichrist
[1:00:09] but but that ain't the Antichrist that
[1:00:12] Jesus spoke of it's an antichrist Spirit
[1:00:14] but it is not the
[1:00:19] Antichrist where we know anything not
[1:00:21] like God is anti-god anything that comes
[1:00:23] against
[1:00:25] God is anti-god so the Antichrist spirit
[1:00:29] is so religious Cain as I've been
[1:00:31] telling you about was just just as
[1:00:33] religious as Abel was and those things
[1:00:35] come right down and they are brothers
[1:00:37] right so Esau and Jacob
[1:00:40] everything uh Judas and Jesus some
[1:00:42] people only see three crosses on
[1:00:44] golgatha but he says there were four
[1:00:47] there was Jesus and the one Thief uh uh
[1:00:50] the one thief on the right the one thief
[1:00:51] on the left and uh we know the scripture
[1:00:53] says curses cursed is he that hangeth on
[1:00:56] a tree and Judas hung himself on a
[1:00:59] sycamore tree is that right he was on
[1:01:01] just as much AC cross as Jesus was on a
[1:01:04] tree he says
[1:01:06] now there was the son of God come from
[1:01:09] Heaven returning back to Heaven taking
[1:01:12] with him the repentant sinner
[1:01:15] okay Jesus came got the repentant sinner
[1:01:18] now he's saying there was the son of
[1:01:20] predition from
[1:01:21] Hell Come From Hell returning back to
[1:01:24] hell and he's taking back The unrepented
[1:01:29] Sinner see if thou be the question mark
[1:01:32] on God's word if thou be the Son of
[1:01:36] God but he says but this other one never
[1:01:38] tried to figure it out he said Lord
[1:01:41] remember me when thou comest in see the
[1:01:45] difference between the two thieves on
[1:01:47] the cross one one is saying well he's a
[1:01:50] sinner just like us and the other one is
[1:01:51] saying Lord forgive me for being a
[1:01:53] sinner
[1:01:55] one was mocking one was ridiculing but
[1:01:57] one was asking for
[1:02:00] mercy so we doing okay uh probably not
[1:02:05] too much
[1:02:09] longer so Deuteronomy chapter
[1:02:13] 18 starting in the ninth
[1:02:17] verse it says when thou art come into
[1:02:20] the land which the Lord thy God giveth
[1:02:23] thee Thou shalt not learn to do after
[1:02:26] the Abominations of those Nations don't
[1:02:29] partake of their
[1:02:31] ways verse 10 it says there shall not be
[1:02:33] found among you anyone that maketh his
[1:02:36] son or his daughter to pass through the
[1:02:38] fire which is the the sacrifice that
[1:02:40] they would do or that useth divination
[1:02:43] which is witchcraft or an observer of
[1:02:46] times that's a sorcerer or magician or a
[1:02:49] soothsayer or an enchanter which is an
[1:02:52] observer of signs or a wick witch which
[1:02:55] is
[1:02:56] sorcery or
[1:02:59] charmer which they submit others by
[1:03:01] spells or incantations trickery or
[1:03:04] deception see these are the spirits that
[1:03:06] we contend with out there and he's
[1:03:08] saying be not partakers with them amen
[1:03:13] so or a consulter with familiar spirits
[1:03:16] or a wizard a which is a conjurer or a
[1:03:21] necromancer a necromancer one who vokes
[1:03:24] the dead a Ghost spirit of a dead
[1:03:28] one y'all familiar with the term
[1:03:31] necromancing necromancing is
[1:03:33] communication with the dead necro means
[1:03:35] death if you're trying to summon or
[1:03:37] inquire of a dead person that is
[1:03:39] necromancing brother Brandon said that
[1:03:42] Cath Catholicism is
[1:03:44] spiritualism and and this is why because
[1:03:47] it's a communication with dead people
[1:03:50] see they pray to dead
[1:03:52] Saints right they ask help help from
[1:03:54] dead Saints St Christopher St Jude all
[1:03:58] these different Saints they call for
[1:04:00] help and each Saint will protect them
[1:04:02] from certain things or uh one might be a
[1:04:06] financial Saint you know you pray unto
[1:04:08] that hey I need more money bless me you
[1:04:11] know I need protection St I can't
[1:04:14] remember who which one it is I I don't
[1:04:16] know it could be St Christopher for all
[1:04:18] I know but they call upon these Saints
[1:04:21] they are praying to these Saints instead
[1:04:24] of calling up calling out to
[1:04:27] God their prayers are to a human form
[1:04:30] that has done gone on wherever their
[1:04:33] destination is that is the spiritualism
[1:04:36] and that's what brother brandom was
[1:04:37] talking about and that's what he
[1:04:39] preached against he said you're so far
[1:04:42] into spiritualism which is necromancing
[1:04:44] because you're trying to communicate
[1:04:46] with the dead but we have one
[1:04:49] mediator one mediator between man and
[1:04:52] God and that is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:54] amen it not s it's not some Saint Nick
[1:04:57] or anything like that y'all but see in
[1:05:00] in doing this it's an Abomination unto
[1:05:02] the Lord oh
[1:05:06] my oh
[1:05:12] my verse 12 it says for all that do
[1:05:15] these things are an Abomination unto
[1:05:17] unto the Lord and because of these
[1:05:19] Abominations the Lord thy God doth drive
[1:05:21] them out from before thee
[1:05:24] verse 13 it says Thou shalt be perfect
[1:05:27] with the Lord thy God for these nations
[1:05:30] which Thou shalt possess hearken unto
[1:05:33] Observer observers of times and
[1:05:36] unto uh divers but as for thee the Lord
[1:05:40] thy God hath not suffered thee to do so
[1:05:43] or so to
[1:05:45] do God didn't ordain us to communicate
[1:05:49] with them or we would have been a witch
[1:05:51] or we would have been a sorcerer but we
[1:05:52] are a child of God and we don't get into
[1:05:55] these evil things we don't get into
[1:05:57] tarot cards we don't get into Ouija
[1:05:59] boards we we don't get into
[1:06:02] seances but our communication is with
[1:06:04] our Lord amen see these these demons out
[1:06:08] there are trying to get us to try to
[1:06:10] sift us as wheat to try to get us out of
[1:06:12] the relationship with our Lord and
[1:06:15] savior I think this is the last quote he
[1:06:19] says brother I tell you sometimes we
[1:06:20] need to be skinned down and rubbed a
[1:06:22] little bit to see where we're standing
[1:06:24] don't you think so make right right now
[1:06:28] I'm not condemning the Catholic saints
[1:06:29] but look the reason that the witch of
[1:06:31] Endor could call the spirit of Samuel
[1:06:33] because Samuel couldn't go into the
[1:06:35] presence of
[1:06:37] God and that's what happens with people
[1:06:40] is when they feel that they can't get
[1:06:41] into the presence of God anymore they're
[1:06:43] going to go seek something
[1:06:45] else something else that they can get
[1:06:48] under the influence
[1:06:50] of see I'm not condemning Catholic
[1:06:52] saints but look the reason that the
[1:06:53] witch of Endor could call the spirit of
[1:06:55] Samuel because Samuel couldn't go into
[1:06:56] the presence of God he was in Paradise
[1:06:59] for the blood of bulls and goats would
[1:07:01] not take away sin but since Jesus died
[1:07:03] he divorced sin and taken away sin and
[1:07:06] the believer now goes into the presence
[1:07:08] of God
[1:07:10] Amen and he can't come back Jesus said
[1:07:14] in Luke when he was talking about the
[1:07:16] rich man he can't return once you're
[1:07:19] there you're there that is your
[1:07:22] destination and he can't come back Jesus
[1:07:25] said in Luke when he was talking about
[1:07:26] the rich man he can't return so if
[1:07:28] you're interceding with any kind of a
[1:07:30] spirit of someone that's gone on outside
[1:07:32] of God Christ the only mediator between
[1:07:36] God and man then you are in spiritualism
[1:07:38] called
[1:07:41] religion now where is spiritualism at so
[1:07:44] be careful what you say about the spirit
[1:07:45] of God because we know people would talk
[1:07:48] about they they would mock the spirit of
[1:07:50] God when there were healings going on
[1:07:51] when discernment was going on people
[1:07:54] were mocking those things saying saying
[1:07:56] that brother Brandon was in
[1:07:59] spiritualism but what is spiritualism
[1:08:01] it's communicating with the dead but
[1:08:03] brother Brandon was communicating with
[1:08:05] our Lord who is not dead but is risen
[1:08:08] amen and is alive forever
[1:08:11] more oh
[1:08:14] my but there's one thing that I've
[1:08:17] always thought about that God by the
[1:08:20] power of his death at Calvary has given
[1:08:21] to the church power to cast out evil
[1:08:24] spirits amen because Mark 16 said in my
[1:08:28] name they shall cast out not I will but
[1:08:32] they will in my name they shall cast out
[1:08:34] Devils which is
[1:08:36] you he's given you power to cast out
[1:08:39] those
[1:08:40] Devils he says in my name they shall
[1:08:42] cast out Devils is that right if they
[1:08:44] lay their hands on the sick they shall
[1:08:47] recover
[1:08:49] amen and in Matthew 8:1 16 it says when
[1:08:53] the even was was come they brought unto
[1:08:55] him many that were possessed with devils
[1:08:57] and he cast out the
[1:09:00] spirits with
[1:09:02] what his
[1:09:04] word oh my how powerful the word
[1:09:08] is but and he cast out the spirits with
[1:09:10] his word and healed all that were
[1:09:15] sick this is the power that he's given
[1:09:19] us
[1:09:21] amen now you might say that I oh I
[1:09:23] believe in the spoken word everybody
[1:09:25] believes in the spoken word right the
[1:09:26] scripture tells us that uh that we
[1:09:29] receive not because we ask not or
[1:09:32] because we ask but we ask a Miss we
[1:09:35] don't know what we're asking for we're
[1:09:36] just asking we're we're just kind of
[1:09:38] going through the motions you know well
[1:09:41] I want this power but what do you want
[1:09:42] the power for what do you want the power
[1:09:44] of the spoken word for so you could be
[1:09:46] like balum and try to curse God's people
[1:09:49] but he couldn't do
[1:09:51] it the Lord wouldn't let him right
[1:09:54] because he was bound as a prophet he can
[1:09:57] only the word comes to the prophet the
[1:10:00] word of he couldn't speak anything but
[1:10:02] the word of the Lord when the Lord said
[1:10:04] speak to the people this he couldn't say
[1:10:07] anything but that so we should be so
[1:10:09] close to God that we can't say anything
[1:10:11] but what the Lord has spoken amen so
[1:10:14] what is the reason people like the the
[1:10:17] spoken word for well there's so much
[1:10:19] power in the spoken word what's the
[1:10:20] reason why people want to be able to use
[1:10:23] the spoken word is it that they could
[1:10:25] have the power to say well look at me
[1:10:28] like King Nebuchadnezzar look at the
[1:10:29] Kingdom that I built up look at the
[1:10:32] people look at the congregation that I
[1:10:34] built up all these people follow me
[1:10:37] because I had the power of the spoken
[1:10:40] word see it's people trying to bring
[1:10:42] attention to themselves and not bringing
[1:10:44] it to the Lord Jesus
[1:10:47] amen but what is the purpose people want
[1:10:50] the spoken word see Power without
[1:10:52] character is Satan but with power with
[1:10:55] character is fit the rule see when we if
[1:10:58] we have the right character that's that
[1:11:00] that's why brother Brandon was able to
[1:11:01] do certain things because he had the
[1:11:03] right character the Lord entrusted him
[1:11:06] because he had the right character now
[1:11:08] if uh what was it the disciples if now
[1:11:12] we have to be careful if we had that
[1:11:14] power are we going to be like uh the
[1:11:16] disciples when when the prophet called
[1:11:18] fire you know from Heaven under those
[1:11:21] that kept knocking on the door I think
[1:11:23] that was with King aiah and uh because
[1:11:26] he sought another God other than the god
[1:11:28] of Israel he sought another entity he he
[1:11:31] sought out a different deity now these
[1:11:34] disciples were saying the same thing
[1:11:35] Lord should we call fire from heaven
[1:11:38] because they had something uh people
[1:11:40] were doing something that they didn't
[1:11:41] like well should we just annihilate them
[1:11:43] he says you don't even know what Spirit
[1:11:45] you're of you're wanting to call fire
[1:11:47] from heaven and I didn't come to destroy
[1:11:49] the law I didn't come to destroy people
[1:11:52] I came to save save and redeem my people
[1:11:56] amen so we have to be careful what we're
[1:11:59] trying to do with the spoken word is it
[1:12:02] going to be
[1:12:04] self-fulfilling or is it going to be a
[1:12:06] benefit to
[1:12:07] others because we know eternal life is
[1:12:10] serving others right
[1:12:15] so just a few more minutes uh Acts
[1:12:18] chapter 5 and verse
[1:12:21] 15 I hope this is helping somebody this
[1:12:27] morning it says in so much that they
[1:12:29] brought forth the sick into the streets
[1:12:32] and laid them on beds and couches that
[1:12:33] at the least the shadow of pet Peter
[1:12:36] passing by might overshadow some of them
[1:12:39] there came also a multitude out of the
[1:12:41] Cities round about unto Jerusalem
[1:12:42] bringing sick folks and them which were
[1:12:44] vexed with unclean spirits and they were
[1:12:47] healed everyone amen see if we meet the
[1:12:51] same conditions that that they met back
[1:12:53] back then then the same thing can apply
[1:12:55] to us it's not something that's some far
[1:12:58] off distance that that we can't reach
[1:13:00] it's if we're believer this is one of
[1:13:02] our tools amen this is one of our
[1:13:04] weapons
[1:13:07] amen see in verse 17 then the high
[1:13:09] priest rose up and all they that were
[1:13:11] with him which is the sect of the
[1:13:13] Sadducees and were filled with
[1:13:14] indignation and laid their hands on the
[1:13:17] apostles and put them in the common
[1:13:18] prison now why did do they do that
[1:13:21] because evil can't stand good right evil
[1:13:24] can't stand how prosperous good can be
[1:13:26] because it why do people get so upset
[1:13:29] that people read the Bible or live a
[1:13:31] Godly life it's because it's the same
[1:13:34] reason Cain and Abel Cain couldn't stand
[1:13:36] Abel because Abel was more righteous
[1:13:38] than Cain amen but Abel probably didn't
[1:13:41] go around and said bragging about it hey
[1:13:43] I'm more righteous than you nny nanny
[1:13:44] boo boo you know I'm better than you it
[1:13:46] wasn't that I don't think he had that
[1:13:48] kind of a spirit because that's not an
[1:13:49] attribute of the holy spirit amen so and
[1:13:53] we we know that Abel was a Son of
[1:13:55] God so he would carry the same
[1:13:58] attributes as God I I believe amen so uh
[1:14:03] and we have that so much in this day
[1:14:05] that the good is going or yeah the The
[1:14:08] Good the evil is going to come against
[1:14:09] good and no matter what we do because we
[1:14:12] know that Spirits are everywhere Spirits
[1:14:13] are in everything that we do we
[1:14:15] encounter Spirits in everything that we
[1:14:17] do you could even be at home you could
[1:14:19] be listening to a message and there's
[1:14:21] going to be a spirit that's going to try
[1:14:22] to come in a spirit of Doubt spirit of
[1:14:24] fear whatever it might be but don't you
[1:14:26] let it in don't you let that in you see
[1:14:30] we entertain Spirits excuse me yeah we
[1:14:32] entertain Spirits we entertain angels
[1:14:34] unaware now see isn't that something we
[1:14:37] enter entertain enter it means to come
[1:14:41] in right so you are allowing something
[1:14:43] to come in entertain we instead of
[1:14:45] practicing or getting involved in
[1:14:47] entertainment we need to start
[1:14:48] practicing exertainment getting these
[1:14:51] spirits that don't belong get them out
[1:14:53] amen amen so we got to be careful what
[1:14:55] we're entertaining uh musicians
[1:14:57] come see it's when we spend uh the time
[1:15:01] with those those that are in the world
[1:15:03] uh or those that are not of of such good
[1:15:06] character these things Vex our souls and
[1:15:08] our Spirits amen see if we're not
[1:15:11] careful that influence you can stand to
[1:15:13] your feet with me this morning if we're
[1:15:15] not careful we will begin to act like
[1:15:17] them if you get yourself into that
[1:15:19] presence under that influence all the
[1:15:21] time and you know that you should be in
[1:15:23] that
[1:15:25] atmosphere and you constantly get into
[1:15:27] it eventually it's going to get
[1:15:31] you well I'm going to talk to so and so
[1:15:33] and I'm going to try to witness them to
[1:15:35] them I'm going to try to talk to them
[1:15:38] you better be prayed up before you
[1:15:40] go if you that's why we should be you
[1:15:43] know pray without ceasing that's why we
[1:15:44] should be praying before we go do
[1:15:47] anything going to talk to somebody going
[1:15:49] to our our place of of work or wherever
[1:15:52] it is we should be in prayer because of
[1:15:55] the spirits that we
[1:15:57] encounter we need to be careful of the
[1:15:59] influence that tries to bring us
[1:16:02] down remember in the Scripture it
[1:16:04] teaches us that evil Communications
[1:16:06] which it which is companionship it
[1:16:08] corrupts good manners which is our
[1:16:12] character so let's bow our
[1:16:16] heads the scripture Hebrews 1301 it says
[1:16:19] let brotherly Brotherly Love continue
[1:16:22] and be not forget to entertain strangers
[1:16:24] for thereby some have entertained angels
[1:16:28] unawares most gracious Heavenly Father
[1:16:31] Giver of every good gift lover of our
[1:16:33] soul we just love you we appreciate you
[1:16:35] we just thank you for the time that
[1:16:36] we've had this had here this morning
[1:16:39] Father I just pray that you would help
[1:16:41] us uh we're not the most spiritual
[1:16:43] people in in the world we're not trying
[1:16:46] to brag we're not trying to uh be
[1:16:49] prideful
[1:16:51] um but Lord I just just pray that you
[1:16:53] would help us that we would recognize
[1:16:55] the spirits that we encounter and when
[1:16:57] we recognize those Spirits uh help us to
[1:17:00] discern uh which Spirits we should be
[1:17:02] entertaining and those that we should be
[1:17:04] casting away father we know that your
[1:17:07] scripture says try every Spirit to see
[1:17:09] if they are of God or not Lord I just
[1:17:12] pray that when we do such that uh no
[1:17:15] evil uh spirit would overtake us that
[1:17:17] would influence us to to take us away
[1:17:20] from you but Lord I just pray that that
[1:17:23] uh you would give each one here this
[1:17:25] morning in in presence those that are
[1:17:27] streaming uh just pray that you would uh
[1:17:30] give each one of us the the strength and
[1:17:33] help us to be spiritually strong enough
[1:17:35] to recognize what Spirit we are of and
[1:17:37] what spirits that we encounter but
[1:17:39] father uh just pray that uh you would
[1:17:43] help us as we uh walk through uh this
[1:17:47] life day by day that uh our discernment
[1:17:50] would be exercised and exercised well
[1:17:53] uh that we wouldn't be carried about by
[1:17:56] every wind of Doctrine but we would stay
[1:17:57] steadfast upon Thy word and thy word is
[1:18:00] truth father we just pray as we depart
[1:18:03] from here that we would never depart
[1:18:04] from your presence for you yourself even
[1:18:07] said that you would not leave us nor
[1:18:08] forsake us and Lord we're counting on
[1:18:10] that that you would be with us so
[1:18:11] whenever we encounter danger whenever we
[1:18:14] encounter uh some influence that we
[1:18:16] shouldn't be under Lord we look unto you
[1:18:18] and we're depending on you to keep us
[1:18:20] safe from those things keep us from harm
[1:18:23] Lord be it far from us that we would uh
[1:18:26] get into things such as witchcraft or
[1:18:28] sorcery or anything that has an
[1:18:30] attribute to it Lord God I just pray
[1:18:32] that you would cleanse us and keep us
[1:18:34] pure from all those things that we could
[1:18:36] uh stand before you as pure uh uh
[1:18:39] unadulterated uh children of God or as
