grace so this week we finished the Sardis Church age I think that was the end on Sunday these how I'm feeling right now and this week I listen to the Philadelphia Church age up to detailed notes on it the sermon so now I got to go read the book so I have another book in years I can't preach at Philadelphia Church Jason tonight probably Sunday but I got the whole sermon listen to and listen to it diligently and took all the notes this weekend so we'll try to begin preach on that Lord willing on Sunday by God's grace but let's go to fees chapter 2 verse 14 I like to look at part eight tonight by God's grace the book of Ephesians I would like to start at verse 14 but we preach on verses 14 and 15 last time and so I want to spend a little more time on verses 16 to the end and will probably begin chapter 3 tonight as well by God's grace for there say amen I'll read 14 15 16 then we'll all read 17 and 18 about that by God's grace I'll read 14 15 16 we can all read 17 and 18 verse 14 says for he is our peace who has made both one and hath broken down the middle wall partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments contained in ordinances for to make in himself of Twain one new man so making peace so now Jew and Gentile are not two separate men now there are one man there one body verse 16 and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby now let's read 17 on three one two three and came and preached peace to you which were afar off and to them that were not let's read 18 for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the father let's have a word of Prayer if you would just bow your heads here if you have a need on your heart just make a known unto God by raising your hand how many father you see our hands Lord you Lord you heard all these requests that we prayed for here tonight many many requests we know Lord and we're confident that you could meet every need o God we thank you in the past how you've met different prayer requests answered prayers given us testimonies sometimes you answer right away other times Lord you strengthen our faith through trials and you raise our faith by waiting upon the Lord Lord you told us in patience we actually possess our souls we actually grab a hold of that eternal life as we wait upon you dear God we're waiting on you and we're waiting for you Lord the prophet teaches in the church age book so father we're waiting on you tonight Lord God and we're waiting only for you so father take these words we've read in the book of Ephesians quicken them to our hearts Lord God I just pray you teach us give us the wisdom and understanding and revelation we have need of here tonight Lord God as your prophet said these are teachings that evangelist can't do Lord God this is specifically for the teaching and Pastoral Ministries so Lord feed your children sheep food here tonight the Word of God we love you Lord we'd ever need in Jesus Christ name everybody said amen god bless you being seated praise God look at the word of the Lord here tonight God's grace now how you can switch over when you're ready it's good to see our brother amen I've always been working a lot let's give him a round thought thank God so thankful you know tonight offer work praise the Lord Amen thankful for that and just like when anybody misses you know we just longed to see them you know we haven't seen Kevin Murray for a couple of weeks but we prayed for them and we're thankful you know when the Saints make it to the house of the Lord praise God many times that go through battles but we're more than conquerors amen more than conquerors in Christ Jesus so let's look at these here I got a few thoughts here and I just want to refresh your thinking you know we're looking at the book of Ephesians remember there's three themes in Ephesians the first theme is the believers exalted position in Christ and you see that in chapter one and it goes you know from chapter one verse one all the way to the end of chapter one and then chapter two it starts talking about the second theme which is the one body of Christ both Jew and Gentile and that's what we're on right now we're still on the second theme in the book of Ephesians we get in the chat once chapter four verse one hits then you start looking at the walk of the believer and the warfare the believer amen I'm grateful to be walking as a Christian today praise God and I'm glad I can be a part of the warfare that the believer goes through recently a recently this week I got another testimony from the online YouTube videos I think I pray for somebody and God answered their prayer there on the video so we appreciate the testimonies and church says that happens all of us right you know we don't always hear about it but we are kings and priests unto God and as we said were we are no more special than anybody else but we do have a special calling our calling is a holy calling we all know there's wise and foolish virgins the wise virgin has a holy high calling they're not any better because we're both saved by grace can you say men in fact I was reading this week in Galatians and Paul said o foolish Galatians who hath bewitched you to be so far removed from grace he said did you receive the spirit by the works of the law or the hearing of faith how'd you get the Holy Ghost you heard the word you believed it Ava had you got justify sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost through faith you just believed it right and it went to work in your life it wasn't just a checklist of look what I've done look what I've done you didn't earn it that way love led you to obey all those doctrines all the justification sanctification love leads you to these things and it was just by hearing it and just being excited about it and God which excitement just another word for inspiration of the Holy Ghost anointed because you won't find the word I'm excited about Christ which you'll find I'm anointed by Christ that's what you'll find in the scripture the anointing of the Holy Spirit so that's what we have by God's grace that's how that's the themes we're looking at here through the book of Ephesians now as I said in Chapter I'm sorry in part 7 of this series we looked at verses 14 and 15 again at the middle wall perdition how it's been broken down and God has made peace between Jew and Gentile now I want to read a few scriptures let's look at verse 16 that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby so the cross destroyed the hatred that was against the believer the cross destroyed that so let's look at a few scriptures that prove that go to Romans 6:6 we'll start there Romans 6:6 I've got some numerous scriptures here I want to show you how the cross slough or killed the hatred against us the cross did that because I remember I read that I thought my god the cross slaying the end of the cross slay the entity and I just want to show some scriptures here that encouraged us by God's grace Romans 6:6 okay can I have a reader for that when we like to read Malachi and we'll go to Adam Malachi Romans 6:6 and then we have Adam after that amen so how did the cross slay the hatred against you well it actually slew the old man that you once were right if the Bible said we were crucified with him why cuz we were in the plan of God we are in the mind of God praise the Lord Jesus looked ahead for the joy that was set before him he died for all of us all of our sins were placed upon him and the Bible said your old man was crucified with him that old brother Jesse I used to be or wouldn't say brother the old sinner Jesse I used to be he died on Calvary is that right none of the Bible said it was crucified with him hey man so my old nature died there I just came to recognize it in 1999 Amen although I was born in 1980 so 19 years later I recognized my old man was already dead he already got crucified back there the cross slew the hatred against me because the cross took all the old man he killed the old man Amen that's where the old man died on the cross is that true Romans 8:3 my brother Adam want to read Romans 8:3 for us a men so Christ condemned sin in his flesh so Jesus judges sin and said you're paid for you can't have you can't have any authority over a brother Jessie anymore right now you put yourself in there it's condemned I condemn you Satan right you had all these charges against the people I condemn you those charges are paid for how did he do it in his flesh hallelujah he condemned sin in his flesh Jesus broke sins power by his holy flesh his holy life the fact that he lived pure faith that we could be pure because we were in him amen we're in his mind we're in the plan of God amen because all the sin of the whole world was placed upon Christ amen now let's go to Colossians 2:14 did I see a new hand that one to read Colossians 2:14 anybody wanna read sister Bo thank you Colossians 2:14 this has always been one of my favorite scriptures about the cross hey Colossians 2 whenever you're ready sister Colossians 2:14 amen so what did God do with all the handwriting that was against us the Bible said he nailed it to the cross it was put on the cross that's how the cross slew the hatred against us cuz what hey what hey 'tried was against us all the condemnation that was against us that was written on those handwriting of Ordinances that we failed to we failed to live up to but Jesus the Bible said God nailed them to Jesus's cross you didn't see it but that whole list against us was nailed to the cross that's always one of my favorite scriptures and he blotted it out so it's no longer there so the devil can't say brother amen there's a big long list against you you can't say that because it's already been nailed to the cross amen he can't hold that it was already taken on the cross Jesus already paid for that there's no kind of nation to them that are in Christ Jesus amen who can lay any charge to God's elect because the charge that was against us was already placed on the cross hallelujah there's no charge against the believer tonight hallelujah in the last one this is one of my favorite ones too Hebrews 2:14 do you have a different reader like to read that one tonight Hebrews 2:14 with Amen all right thank you the Liddy you'll be next up for that Hebrews 2:14 Hebrews 2:14 soberly amen whenever you're ready [Music] amen so Jesus destroyed Satan his influence and his power of death in other words when we die Satan can't grab ahold us and drag us down to the regions of the Lost anymore right now of course we know there was Abraham's bosom but that power of death has been broken the Bible says that and Jesus destroyed that means destroyed his influence so Satan can no longer influence us right if we live by the word if we walk in the spirit who's gonna make you who's gonna make you cuss and watch a dirty movie nobody because you've got power to overcome that you see like he his influence has been destroyed today at the meeting everybody's laughing about getting drunk and laughing about all kinds of evil sex acts and I just stand there and I just stare at the paper and I just say God have mercy on this people they're all laughing and looking around and I'm just I'm just bird and it just breaks my heart Satan can't tempt me there why because Jesus destroyed his power over me that could come here and rejoice and intercede for Souls and praise God and worship and preach the Word of God why because Satan his power has been destroyed over my life amen we walk in the power of the Holy Spirit so I just want those are the scriptures I wrote down those are the first four that I found that they that support Ephesians 216 I believe that was so I'm gonna go back there visions 216 what uh what a thought Paul gives us that the cross slain or destroyed the hatred against us because it was nailed to the cross and also defeated Satan's influence over us because now we walk in the power of the Spirit not in the flesh we walk in the spirit praise God amen now next let's go to this next thought verse 17 and preach peace to you which were afar off and to them that were nice oh Jesus he and his ministry ministers preach peace to those that were far off the Gentiles and those that were nigh the Jews and he preaches peace to all of them and we ought to be thankful for peace with God tonight because there are so many people that don't have peace with God tonight and they're trying to fulfill with drugs they're trying to shoot up with drugs because they have no peace with God right but we don't have to shoot up with anything natural we just say God fill me with more of your love amen feel let me get drunk on the Holy Ghost let me just just get so joyful and worship amen fill me with your joy man that's why we come to church to get drunk on the Holy Ghost Oh glory that's exactly right Church I have this place where I feel the best and all the world is in the house of God amen because in his presence is fullness of joy oh it's so true it's so true now let's look at verse 18 I want to lay a few scriptures about verse 18 because as I read this this struck my heart and then I heard brother Brooks preach on it you probably will remember some of the things he said but I want to read them again okay the next one is access to God there's my next slide there access to God for through him we both have access by one spirit unto the Father so through the blood of Jesus Christ he forgave our sins now we have access to the Father through the spirit through the Holy Spirit now I want to look at two examples of how people in the Old Testament had access to a king just because it shows types brother Brooks brought out one of them so let's go that one first Samuel 25 let's go there first Samuel 25 this is Abigail and Abel other Brooks was right it was Nabal was the name I couldn't remember it while he was preaching it so I looked it up on my Bible my Bible app on my phone and it was in Abel he was right First Samuel 25 First Samuel 25 watch the approach and watch how Abigail gets access to the king how many want access to Christ I want to open door to I swear I know I can come before Christ and he won't turn me away we know the veil has been tall we know there's no mental wall partition we know all these things but spiritually there's an approach to take unto Christ and it we did it tonight through prayer and worship but let's look at it as a type in the Old Testament okay so you can see this truth of it first samuel 25 verse 18 it's kind of a long lengthy scripture but I know Lydia's got some healthy lungs there and can read on it has a lot of endurance so 25 I'm on the wrong page 18 okay so you remember the story David asked nabel's Shepherd's can you just give us some water and food and they say no who's David navels like no who's David and so David's thinking I'm gonna go kill Nabal because he was he was in the flesh that was the flesh that wasn't the holy spirit that was the flesh and nabel's wife Abigail years of it and she knows her husband's a fool but she doesn't badmouth her husband that's what a good lesson for our sisters and even for our brothers always show respect and love never badmouth anybody right so here's the the story here's what she says here's her here's her approach to get access to King David okay so Lydia verse 18 can you read 18 and 19 all right so we get this idea of when you want favor from the king you have to show love to the king you have to show you have to give gifts to the king and gods not asking for raisins from us right he's died he's asking for our humility he's asking for our praise our songs our testimonies our worship our love that's all God's asking for us right from us that's the only real gifts he wants yes we should give tithes and offerings that we know that that's a minor Doctor memory Jesus told us that he said that's one of the least of the commandments you know what really God wants is justice judgment and mercy amen those are the weightier matters Jesus told us when we preach on that last month so see that's what she brings she knows if I'm gonna have any access to God if I'm gonna touch the heart of God I've got to bring my best and that's what that's what David needed David needed food so she brought the best food she could find loaves right uh a corn wine she brought the best and church that's why we bring our best to the house of God we give God our best attention during the service amen that's showing God that we love Him that's giving him an offering praise God and that's how you get access now we know the story she brings it now look when she gets there verse 23 I'll read 23 and when Abigail saw David she hasted and lighted off the ass and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground so once again now we see the humility not only does she give lots of gifts lots of praises Lots gives the Lord when it gives David whatever she wants whatever he needs right now with that but she physically humbles herself praise God and we could we could go for some amore that could we they don't have to be a church right because nobody said on Sunday anybody can love to stand in front of pray and pray in front of people the publicans loved to pray there long prayers in front of everybody else but see if we didn't pray this morning then god help us that'd be more sincere pray at home and for a church that's the idea pray all day that's the idea pray all day just don't save your only prayers you know for church if you had a busy morning you got up late God understands that right God's got a mercy but let's make it a habit of praying all day so God knows how sincere we are we must do that so see she humbles herself falls on at his feet now look at verse 20 this is beautiful my and fell at his feet and said upon me my lord upon me let this iniquity be and let thine handmaid I pray thee speak in that audience and hear the words of thine handmaid you see that David's mad at her husband but she said Lord put all of his iniquity on me does that sound familiar what did Paul tell Philemon he said Philemon put all the charges that was against the servant put him on my account I'll pay for right and Paul said I wish I was cursed so that the Jews could be saved you see that's thought that's the real Christian heart right here don't be upset with this person forgive this person put it on me and would you please after I've given all my gifts after I've asked you to have mercy on others will you now listen to me can I just say a few words see that's and that's the model of Prayer we should first worship God forgive others as they Ferraz God forgives us right and then bring your requests before God could everybody see that give him your worship first there's a little song we've been listening to called first by Lauren Danko I don't know has anybody heard it but it says before I bring my needs I'll bring my heart and I thought that was of just a beautiful song and that's what Abigail is doing here before she tells you tells David all the things she needs first she blesses him with all these gifts oh god help us to just come and give a sacrifice of praise amen in the house of the Lord lift our hands say thank you Jesus for another day thank you for letting me come to church thank you for giving me the strength to be in the house of God there's so many people that can't mean the house of God or refuse to come to the house of God and Lord I bring my best raisins I bring my breast wine I bring my best corn I bring my best song tonight by God's grace Oh hallelujah God give us Avigail hearts amen all right now you know the story well you might know the story you might not I'm not sure last time you read it but David thanks her for the advice in verse 33 so see that's what women can do women can be a source of wisdom not preaching at the man but giving them wisdom right brother Brandon brother Branham say my wife is my correction remember that quote the man said my wife is my correction see because these two are one so the woman remember she doesn't bring the word and say hubby you know I'm preaching at you know what she said darling I feel I have this little thought on my heart could I share this with you you see there's a difference in the approach right it's bringing the love first bring the love bring the love and then you bring a little advice you have some requests it's all about love church it's all about love to God and then love to one another that's how she brings it and then David thanks her blessed be your advice in verse 33 alright so how does she get access to God bring gifts gifts and then pray for others forgive others right intercede for others then the third thing and I bring my request before God how many raise your hand say God helped me to do better job of just entering into worship and prayer just with praise how many would say that I'm gonna say help me to be in an Abigail my hands up sometimes I'll just go down and I just got a burden that's the first thing I wanted to do is ask God God will you take this burden off my heart but I even I know I need that too when I pray the first things out of my mouth I want to say thank you Jesus let's give him praise let's give him the best gifts we can give all right now the second example you're probably familiar with is Esther but before we go to Esther let's go to Roman's 5 to Romans 5 - I don't want to leave this out I want to make sure I read this because once again the ester I might you know just get excited I might forget to do Romans 5 - honestly because that's just such a beautiful story Romans 5 - Romans 5 - and you remember these scriptures are on my heart this evening so when I come down to pray you know I was entering into prayer through praise I was just thanking the law I'm sure you did too you know for prayer because that's that's the right approach to God that's how you gain access and access means an open door that's how you gain God's ear that's how you that's how you show the Lord you love him is by praising him first amen so Romans 5:2 how about Malachi could you read that sir Romans 5 - buddy thank you amen so the reason read this is accessed by what faith access by faith what is faith it's the substance things hope for its the revelation of God's will for your life right so that's the way we have access it's through these gifts so when we give the gifts we've got to remember we have to have faith to remember God loves my prayers God loves me God died for me all that high-riding was placed upon the cross amen that's faith that's a revelation I know God loves me and that's how I'm getting access he's invited me to come I didn't ask to come he invited me to come amen he said let every other children come unto me he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the churches praise God so it's accessed by faith we have to have the understanding God called me to be a Christian in Akron I know God placed me here I know God sent me here I know I'm in the perfect will of God I've got faith in that and I know God wants me to pray for others as well right okay one more now let's go to Esther - Esther - verse 9 Esther - verse 9 ester to verse nine how does ester now you actually have to two thoughts on access with ester at least two the first one is you have access to relationship so in chapter 2 you see how she gains access to the relationship with King Artaxerxes I think that's the right way to say that's a hard word to say artaxerxes and then later in chapter 5 his access for requests or intercession ok so there's two different ones there first she gets access to have a relationship with the king and then she gets access to ask the King a question and to save souls so let's look at these two different ways of access and I think you'll see the typer similar to Abigail I think you see the types the type is that we need something outside of ourselves we need something because we are not worthy can the church say Amen we're not worthy we need some we need something to help us to come in the presence of God amen asked her to verse I say 19 I'm sorry 9 is it 9 ok Esther 2:9 and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and she speedily gave her her things I'm sorry he speedily gave her her things for purification with such things as belonged to her in seven maidens which were meat to be given her out of the king's house and he preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house of the women verse 10 Esther had not showed her people nor her kindred for Mordecai charged her that she should not show it and Mordecai walked every day before the core of the woman's house to know how Esther did and what should become of her now let's stop there just a moment [Music] Esther had a worker Hege I the keeper of the women he had a or she had a helper to help get her clean before her approached before the King okay so before she could have a relationship with the king she needed a keeper of the women the man who kept the women pure the man who knew how to get the women clean she needed a man to help get her clean so she could have a relationship with the king so she could get access to the king now can you see how that's a type of the preaching ministry today women represents the church so the women the women the church needs a man that will prepare her to come before Christ so you see that has to type out the preaching of the word of God because God sends men to preach the gospel God never sent a woman to preach the gospel you'll never find the Bible of course right we know that you never find that Jesus had all 12 men right as apostles he never called a woman Paul said I never allow a woman to a SERP or take authority over a man so a woman never stands up there and said listen I've got the authority of Jesus you man you need to listen to me no it's the other way the man says I got the authority of Christ because God made me the head of my family God made me the head of the church right that's what a man stands there and he's got that authority now he don't have to pound on the pulpit but I'm just showing that as a illustration the man has the authority and it's god-given it's not nothing we asked for it's God given praise God so we understand that it doesn't make us any better it just makes us to have that calling and church hears when it comes down to it's just more responsibility that's what it comes down to the man just has more responsibility just like the wise version she has a higher responsibility than the foolish virgin she's got to bring the oil she's got to pack the oil are you with me she's got to make sure she has enough oil to last throughout the entire watch the foolish virgin doesn't bring enough she does she can't handle that responsibility it's not important to her but the wise virgin has that responsibility and she follows through with it praise God she makes sure she's got oil plenty of oil too so Jesus comes hallelujah amen so see she needs to be made pure so every day this Hege I and Mordecai's checking on her every day her uncle her family relation which he types out the Old Testament I think but I can't remember I haven't preached on that in a while but the point is every day she's made pure made pure every day a little bit more clean oh you like the sign of that church every service a little more clean every day a little more clean I'm getting more pure more pure more pure and then I get access to relationship with God hallelujah I like that now verse 12 is the stinger most people say this is where women are allowed to wear makeup but you never find that in the Bible what it is is she gets to wear oils okay oils so that's verse 12 now when every maids turn was come to go into King has you eres another name is artaxerxes there's two different names he's got after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of those women for so were the days of her purification 'he's accomplished to it six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women so oil and odors never says anything are there about what the world thinks right oil and odors for 12 whole months 365 days amen a whole year we and the church that's how we are we need to fully get purified we need to go through I'll say like this we to go through the full process of getting clean before God amen that's how we get access to a relationship with God because remember relationship is the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right can anybody handle a really deep quote can anybody handle a deep quote tonight okay it's from marriage and divorce I'm gonna read a deep quote put on your spiritual jackets this might shock you we're talking about relationship husband and wife how is a husband wife relationship consummated through intercourse right intercourse between a man and woman the wedding night yeah that's right one flesh very good that well that's what makes them one flesh now put your jackets on I'm gonna burn they up there be careful brother Rams talking at the bromance preaching and marriage and divorce and he's talking about how King Ahasuerus could put any woman away for disobeying him but she could never marry another man but he could marry another woman because he's the man and God and brother Rams comparing that to God God can put any Church away he once but the church can't get another husband because there's only one husband praise the Lord now listen this quote it might shock you notice he can put her away but she cannot put him away he did it has proved it in the days when Luther Wesleyan Pentecost let's stop right there Luther's church was right for a while but then when they denominated what did what did God do what did Christ do he put them away and raised up Wesley but see Luther after Luther got revival at one point they stopped refusing and said I'm I can't go any further with the Holy Ghost I'm not this is all I'm doing so so Christ put her away and got a new wife now look what he says next brace yourself here it is in the days when Luther Wesley and Pentecost when they refused listen to become the further part of him by having spiritual sexual affair to become pregnant with the further part of the word so can you can you grasp that what I'm saying is that the physical intercourse between a man and a woman brother branham likens unto the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the soul every understand that because remember jesus said he told the he told the workers of iniquity you did miracles but I never knew you that new word is actually is actually marriage knowledge of intimacy see he never got into the bedroom with them they never they never received the true seed of Christ are you with me Church I know that's deep and I hope you guys hope we have we all appear mines tonight we do even quote there in other words they refuse to get born again in the soul they could go so far and this is how brother Adam explained it he said there's three rooms in a house there's kitchen and there's the living room then there's bedrooms there's really only three rooms in a house really you eat in one you fellowship in another and then you have intimate relations in another can everybody say Amen and brother Graham likens that unto justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost never understand that Luther wouldn't go out wouldn't even go into the parlor wouldn't even go into the living room with Jesus they said I'm only going to eat with Jesus I'm only gonna get saved with Jesus when they refused to go into the parlor Jesus put her away he went the parlor and called a Wesley into the parlor praise God but when he invited Wesley Wesley come on in here he had to raise up another generations ever understand that by God's grace into the baptism of the Holy Ghost right so was that too bad was that too harsh or not was that okay I just you know I just hope it wasn't you know misunderstood I want you understand justification segregation vacation baptism Holy Ghost is a type of the bedroom that's where you get the life of God in the soul amen when you're born again this soul that's the same as a husband and wife being one flesh now you're one soul with Christ amen when you get burned again does that help by God's grace that's what we're talking about access to God that's what we're talking about with Esther Esther knew of the king but she didn't know him until she got married and had the wedding night with the king does that make sense okay that's what we're talking about she had now she died dollars-- she got married she got access to the King for relationship now I have a relationship with the king I'm not just a woman out there but I'm his actual wife praise God Oh Laurie now and what did she need she did every day more purification more word Maureen you're behaving more sermons more prayin every day just Phil Phil Phil now you're pure now you can go before the king and she was so sanctified she walked in there and the Bible said that those keepers were like okay another woman another woman another woman but as soon as Esther walked in there they picked up their heads and said oh this woman is different and church that's how you are Jesus looks at us said there's a church there's a church there's a church but then he looks at you I said there's the bride she's sanctified he's gonna meet my wife Sheila makes all the Word of God he don't add to the word we just live what it says praise God and then when he sees that bride walk in she said he said oh my this one's different all the angels of heaven said this one is different all those churches are compromised on sin and love and sent over this church loves Christ she's she's purified she's obeying every word and now she has access to me through the concept purification and now she can have relationship ring hallelujah but it's through a daily walk right daily purification purification a long time the full cycle although all the cleaning out of God that's how you get relationship with Christ if not if you he said if you refuse a further spiritual sexual affair he said he'll put you away at church that's where we gotta watch to what if we're in the bedroom what is God calling us to do now that we're in the bedroom it's bring forth more children can every say amen to that that's the Great Commission finishing the Great Commission going into all the world going into Akron and preaching the gospel to every creature we need to do that by God's grace and we need to do that we need to be led though we need to be led and know how to do it by God's grace that's what I need I need to be led on how to do that how to invite people how to get more people here like Jose bringing Helen you know that's that's it just form a relationship with somebody invite him to the house of God praise the Lord but see we cannot refuse to go further with God and this is why I said earlier I'm gonna make one more statement about this that's why I think we need to pray more Church come too early and pray I've asked that before I'll keep asking that but see if the Holy Spirit's asking us for a more relationship we've got to be willing to do that but like you know the most important prayer is at home that's the most important prayer but there's something special about group prayer here where the Jose how many times we prayed here at church and God's answered your prayer how many times many times where the hose they used to tell me too many times but yes he said too many times so there's something special about the house praying here but there's only power here if we're already praying at home but see the Holy Spirit might act may ask us to go a little higher will you go further in mire in your relationship with me can we go a little further and we got to be willing to do that okay hope that was all right that was a merit member marriage and divorce paragraph 256 if anyone listened to that okay now you know the story of Esther let's skip ahead to chapter 4 remember in verse 14 4:14 mordecai sent that letter remember to asked her and said you know don't think you're gonna escape this if if Haman is able to destroy all the Jews he said you're gonna die too he said but don't you know that God sent you to the kingdom for such a time as this don't you know you're here for such a time as this praise God we're here in Akron for such a time as this as they're getting darker and darker our light should be shining brighter and brighter we're here for such a time as this and what was this ministry now for it was access for intercession this is not access for relationship she already has the relationship she's already married and this is where I think you and I they're working we can turn a lot of strength from this this is what we need to do get more in tune for intercession for other people's souls that's true now look at verse 16 this is Esther's answer to Mordecai go gather all the Jews that are present in Shushan and fast for me and neither eat nor drink three days day or night I also and my maidens will fast likewise and so will I go in unto the king which is not according to the law and if I perish I perish all right now look at chapter five verse one we'll skip that last verse go to chapter five verse one who can read it for me but Adam thank you sir can you read just verse one [Music] great now reverse - and it was so when the King saw Esther the Queen standing in the court as she obtained favor in a site and the King held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in her hand I'm sorry in his hand so Esther drew near and touch the top of the scepter so now how does she get access for intercession she had to consecrate her life she had to say I'm gonna have to miss some meals because I want some people to be saved and churches it's not like it's not law because listen now it's just overcoming this label to see an age that's why we have to pray and fast because if we don't this layer of sea an age is gonna distract us right you understand what I'm saying we have to reconsecrate ourselves because the way of men and women is to just drift away right if we don't invest and give God more time we just naturally drift away right so this is what it's saying if we want to intercede for others we've got to make some sacrifices when you want to intercede for someone I was up there in New York and I think I told you this story maybe I didn't and brother Avon told me his teenage daughters and sons were getting really worldly so his wife went on a three-day fast she cooked all his meals for three days and put him in the freezer and said hubby you just got to heat him up when you're hungry she said I'm going in the basement I'm fasting for three days straight and she did the second day she had a vision or a dream or something she came up and said I saw my daughter coming out the room with her hands up saying praise the Lord I'm gonna repent and she's getting really worldly and real worldly and like threatening all I'm gonna leave and and her dad had a word from the Lord saying you know if you leave we're cutting you off judgments gonna fall on you if you leave this church because you're gonna go out in the world and sin like a sinner worshipping the devil and so the wife got really sincere fasted three days and also by the way she fasted for every Wednesday and Sunday for 30 straight years she never ate a meal while her husband preached for 30 years can you imagine that that's dedication how many how many say Laura helped my delegation that's what I say and no wonder God has given such great testimonies in New York I mean God has done some tremendous things one of a one of the people almost died in the 9/11 bombings and then came the message right afterwards I believe it's probably because all those prayers those faithful prayers papal prayers anyways on the third day of her fast her the pastor was sitting out there he said and and her his wife had already told told him I saw this dream of our daughter coming out and they said on the third day that that exact dream happened they turned around and the daughter came out crying with her hands up saying praise the Lord praise God forgive me I've been so awful to your parents and now she plays in the band and they got two CDs and they make just such beautiful worship music it is really beautiful so see it's not that it's not that we earn our parents our children salvation or it's not that we're working to save them but it's we're trying to get in the mind of God in the channel of God how many want the channel of God how many want intercession with God well you've got to get in the channel of Esther just didn't say well I'm the wife I can just walk in and I she knew if she went the wrong approach she could die right she knew there's an approach I have to approach unto God if I'm gonna receive the blessing from God and that's the pray fast and dedicate to God all myself and then member put all my royal garments remember what did brother bantam say those garments were eternal life makes you got that anointing I know I'm saved I know I've got Christ in me I've got the Holy Ghost that's how you go before the King Oh Lord you gave me your life now I'm coming to you I'm applying the token glory I'm applying the token life the Holy Spirit I come with eternal life and I plead for the soul this individual so see access to relationship versus access to intercession does that help you if we want the Holy Ghost we gotta do this access every day every day every day now when you're Christian of course you do that too but that's the get relationship to get borned again now when we want intercession now that we're born again now it's consecrate and pray and see God and approached him with the robes of righteousness eternal life okay now believe that's that how much time do I got let me okay let me set a timer I'll give me ten minutes by God's grace give me ten minutes okay yeah I'll just finish with this okay let's go to back to Ephesians to hope that's a blessing Church hope that's a blessing and if it is then you go you and I need to go home tonight and pray that in our homes remember to pray that way tomorrow come with worshiping giving our best give every day we can to be purified or if we need to intercede for somebody let's let's pray and fast about it remember the last time we did that Christopher and Samuel last time I called a fast God answered both prayers within a matter of a month or two God is faithful God honors access if we access for that intercession the way he said God honors his word he cannot deny his word he has to keep his word praise God visions 2 verse think I'm at 19 yep 19 yellow tire here sorry take a deep breath verse 19 now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners like the Gentile used to be but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of faith and our bill upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets Jesus Christ Himself being the chief Cornerstone and that's the scripture I want to close with look at a few thoughts here now if I can hopefully this will work out I want to show that again with the statue perfect man I think I got the statue curved man on here just give me a moment remember we're built upon the foundation of the Apostles so I'm sorry I'm sorry that's got a load up on the Wi-Fi remember Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira Sardis Philadelphia Laodicea we're built upon the foundation of them I just want to show that pyramid again one more time we are not strangers we're fellow citizens we are part of the building of God and then I want to look at another scripture in Revelation chapter 3 by the grace of the Lord okay I got 400 slides on that church age right there 400 quotes in scriptures and teachings on that so I thank the Lord for that okay I know I'm not sure our sister Helen have you ever have you ever seen the the statue of a perfect man the pyramid have you ever seen that okay all right well then just give me a minute I just got to scroll up here what it means is that the apostles were the foundation they're like our foundation and God keeps building and building and building and we're at the top but we're only as strong as our foundation and our foundation is right here in the Word of God amen the apostles let me show that again I guess got a scroll in just a moment here the sake of our sister hearing these things help me Lord where did I put this here I've been faster to search Google I would have come up there on Google I'm in the 200s I thought I put it in here maybe I didn't yeah that was last week okay no I didn't forgive me I thought for sure that was in there sorry church I thought it was in there oh I think it's in the sanctification one let's try that when I'm pretty sure it's in oh yeah I'm pretty sure it's in that one that's why I do what the the the children yeah there it is okay they might have a better one no yeah there it is that's the one okay so thanks for your two minutes there forgive me forgive me I hate to do that but okay so this is what it's saying sister Helen we are built upon the foundation of the Ephesus church age so these are the believers who live in the days out right after Jesus was on the earth they're called the Ephesian believers okay then the Samarin church age Pergamos Thyatira Sardis was Martin Luther's day the Reformation around the 1500s okay Philadelphia was John Wesley's day John Wesley's day and then Laodicea is our last day this is the last time before Christ returns according to the book of Revelation okay so we're built upon the foundation of st. Paul okay so we're way up here so see 2,000 years have passed this is like a timeline 2,000 years have passed but Paul was our foundation did you know Paul said that if anybody changed anything he preached they were cursed did you know that now he said that in Galatians chapter 1 that's why he's our foundation if if we take away the foundation what's gonna happen to the building it's gonna it's gonna fall over yeah it's gonna fall over that's why we can't change one thing that's why it's important to preach the book Ephesians Church and Galatians and Colossians and a flip in that's why it's important if you take any of that out your foundations gonna fall right so it proves they're not the true churches they can still be saved though but they have to do they have to be kind to Jesus's children and that's what Jesus said we don't over that on Sunday we actually went over on Sunday that's the only way they can be saved if they if they if they destroy the foundation the only way they can be saved is by that last act of grace at the end and that's scriptural yeah that's actual Bible Scripture okay so it's our duty to never change the foundation right don't change anything about the foundation keep it all the same praise the Lord okay now the last scripture I want to read now to go along with this is what I just listened to yesterday in the Philadelphia Church age the prophet quoted Ephesians 2 19 and 20 that we just read and he quoted it out of Revelation 3 so we've got your Bible go to Revelation 3 verse it's first yeah verse 12 revelation 3:12 and I'm trying to close I got three minutes here so bear with me and I appreciate your patience I hope that was it help to everybody so Paul and Ephesians said we're built upon the foundation of the prophets and holy apostles this is the foundation the building were way up here at the top we're the small little church at the top it's a small minority all right we'd like to read 312 for me 312 anybody I'd like to read 312 but Adam again okay how about Amen cause Adam did last time thanks but Adam Amen yeah whenever you can read 312 amen thank you sir now not to jump ahead too much but I'll preach this probably again or maybe a different life this last statement I want to make is the pillar in the house of God for the believer who overcame in the days of Wesley Jesus said I'm gonna make you a pillar in the temple of God okay so the Prophet reads this and here's what he says I have this some of the exact quotes he said a pillar is part of the foundation and isn't it you know you have your foundation here then you have your pillars but the pillar is connected to the foundation okay he says a pillar of foundation in the house of God he said let's read Ephesians 2:19 which we already did they said let's see what Paul said about the foundation in that first church age he said Jesus Christ as the chief Cornerstone were built upon the chief Cornerstone and the holy poss was in a prophets and he said jesus said if you overcome I'll make you a pillar he said or part of the foundation he says which means I'm giving you the doctrine of the Apostles hallelujah if he makes you a pillar in the house of God that means you're connected to the doctrine of the Apostles you're gonna have the same teaching as st. Paul had all right he said Jesus is the everlasting father the mighty God the same thing the Apostles taught he said he will keep you from the synagogue of Satan he said I'll put the overcomer in the foundation where he can stay right with the word oh you ought to be happy if you can stay with the word amen because we're staying with the foundation that Paul laid we're not changing the foundation we're maintaining the foundation because where he makes us a pillar for overcomers we become pillars in the house of God we maintain and hold the same doctrine teaching that the Apostles had it's exactly right he said Jesus said if you're a pillar you can no more go out of God's house see you're sealed in the temple of God I knew ya if the pillar what happens if the pillars moved out Church what happens if they move the pillar out the whole buildings gonna crumble at least the Front's of the buildings gonna crumble right take the pillar out of the White House what's gonna happen well the part on top she's gonna fall down right but the Prophet says if you're a pillar he said you can't go out anymore the house needs you in other words you're sealed into the house of God you've got eternal life hallelujah you're you were in Christ when he was on the cross hallelujah see he said he's the pillar there's my time he said he's a pillar he's the bride this represents the bride if you're a pillar you're your build upon the foundation he said you're part of the bride you're part of the house of God hallelujah so he said that's why we baptized in the literal name of Jesus Christ he said there is the bride there before the throne of God he said they're inside the house of God there's the bride let's stand to our feet praise the Lord amen I hope you enjoyed that by God's grace the overcomer becomes a pillar which the we must support the same doctrine that Paul preached we cannot change one thing about it that's why it's good to go through these things especially the books that are oh of course you know the whole New Testament especially those because it usually said if you change anything in that foundation you said then you're gonna fall you're gonna stumble praise God okay so the next time we're willing we do Ephesians will do chapter three and look at no more than body Christ by God's grace that's just our henceforward prayer you know I think tonight's message if you know kind of felt the Holy Spirit I think tonight's message was a lot on access I think that's where God was dealing with us the most access to relationship and access to intercession now Church one thing I know let me just say is if you're a sincere Christian one thing I know is that everyone here can grow in their access for intercession I hope everybody heard me everybody here should say raise your hand and say brother Jesse pray for me that out I'll learn to access God for it more intercession I'm gonna pray for everybody on that one now for relationship that's where the baptism the Holy Ghost I don't know I can't tell necessarily where everybody's at with the baptism the Holy Ghost but if that's your earnest desire I need access into the relationship of the Holy Ghost seek God for it with all your heart see God for it with all your heart if you see sinful habits and things a believer a Christian shouldn't have then you probably still need sanctified it there's a sill of for the world and things in the world then you there's still more sanctification then may God help you the seek relationship access to relationship how they do the churches so you know I don't like people my life for me but I believe our greatest need of our church is access for the baptism of the Holy Ghost because the Prophet said that all these people have the Holy Ghost we'd be seeing signs multiplied he said we'd be seeing miracles multiplied and now we kind of see in time to time but see we want to see a multiply well we want to see more and more and that's just my thought if I probably said that then that's just my thought I really feel like our church can grow in access to the born-again experience hallelujah and then access to intercession let's pray together Church you think about what you need prayer for I'm gonna pray for both access to relationship and access for intercession for all of us yeah yeah yeah we can do that and just so you know sister this might help you to as you pray to be pregnant Satan told Jesus that he had power over every government that's in the book of Matthew members say he said bow down to where she meet I'll give you all these kingdoms so that grew Satan is really in charge of government's but we didn't pray that some of those individuals in the government will have a real relationship sure yeah I used to pray for brocco bomber he's made a lot of decisions I didn't agree for his soul let's pray that some individuals in that government will get safe father in heaven thank you for today North this is what we need

they're not one time if you have a burden to fast and pray for so much let me know I'll join you the prayer there's power in the past Esther interceded in one souls for such is this okay yeah you would have to what the Bible said you'd have to wait till God put it on your heart too fast because if God puts on your heart you'll be okay but if you don't be a legend fast then you just you just do the show I just do that yeah yeah and we went over in the Book of Daniel gay or way was it 14 days or 12 days or 21 days ever again but he had what was he facets from major foods so he just ate light foods so like if you got you know you don't suffer you have chicken we just would eat the chicken you just eat the rice or them you just eat lighter and that might be the way you would fast okay so there are different kinds of fats Daniel did a juice only fast and when were that one in the scripture he just had liquids but some people if when you're really anointed you don't eat or drink nothing you can do that to the longest ever did that was there just a day and a half I didn't drink any water didn't eat one thing per day that I know my brother's cam in Simon they've gone two or three days without eating or drinking nothing just because that anointing was on there that anointing was on them you know and when that anointing leaves that's when you go eat so all parts of mine is clear does every understanding if you have a burden let's do that I think it's inspired if it's been preached night by God's Word if it's poked to your heart let me know you can pray and intercede for that if you can't come to church you I'll let you know what time I'll be praying you pray at the same time let's get those requests they may know before the Lord all right let's just let's just have a word of Prayer let's just close it prayer will be dismisses right oh that's great how many father we love you again tonight we close with this prayer we just want to say thank you for the service just want to thank you let us see like Abigail Lord let us be like Esther let us bring our love let's bring gifts of love first before I bring my need let us bring our hearts teachers learn to pray like that that's how we get access that's how we get noticed by the key because we can't pray a selfish prayer and expect to be heard we can't prepare with sit in our arms it expect to be heard we must pray a prayer with nothing doubting nothing in our hearts that we hidden in the prayer cloud and you have us the faster over something there are the people's hearts so we can all do it together we're thankful for what you did last we know you're the same God you understand what we go through you understand or trials you understand how dark they ever see this the Lord we should understand how powerful your spirit it will give us strength or God it'll be a standard that raises up against the flood of the enemy it will overcome temptations we will always be stronger than the temptation Thank You Preston to the house of God and those that live Street listen later I pray for those who won't that you create such a hungry because if you have the holy spirit we're talking it only feeds on the ring so for those whom are extremely god will humble then Lord draw them closer to you can you stop the Word of God nor Qaida's now Lord if we should intercede with your fasting sorry to intercede martyr pray for acts to the relationship thank you for help our church to grow grace and knowledge of you Jesus Christ god bless you to this world
