[24:40] our god is a great provider praise god
[24:43] he supplies all of our need praise the
[24:45] lord
[24:45] god is so good yeah i think of it all
[24:47] down through history every age you know
[24:49] this is the age of plenty
[24:50] uh technology we have all this
[24:52] technology to get everything we need
[24:54] yet all the times before this god has
[24:57] provided
[24:57] every person's need just amazing to know
[25:01] how great he is how wonderful he is
[25:03] and we can give praise and honor because
[25:05] he's the faithful provider praise god
[25:07] he's a faithful heavenly father and he
[25:09] deserves all the praise today
[25:11] philippians 4 19 let's read 19 and 20
[25:14] and then we'll
[25:15] have a little word of prayer let's read
[25:17] verses 19 and 20. let's begin on three
[25:19] one
[25:20] two three but my god shall supply
[25:23] all your need according to his riches
[25:26] in glory by christ jesus now
[25:30] unto god and our father be glory forever
[25:33] and ever amen praise god just a few
[25:36] prayer requests let's remember brother
[25:38] amen's work situation he's got
[25:40] some things he's praying about there
[25:41] also brother stephen's work situation
[25:44] the girls would like prayer for
[25:45] salvation for their friends
[25:48] and any other needs tonight does anybody
[25:49] else have anything they'd like
[25:50] remembered in prayer
[25:53] praise god i don't know if everybody
[25:56] heard the testimony on wednesday but
[25:57] jose came in here wednesday and said
[25:59] doctors one month ago told him he had
[26:01] glaucoma and they told him on tuesday he
[26:03] didn't have glaucoma
[26:04] so let's thank the lord for that praise
[26:06] god amen
[26:11] we just sing that song we will see
[26:13] miracles we'll see giants fall praise
[26:15] god
[26:16] if so doctor told you you had glaucoma
[26:18] and then the next month he told you you
[26:20] don't
[26:20] you'd say a giant fell wouldn't you amen
[26:22] praise god amen so thank the lord for
[26:24] that
[26:25] god is great god is merciful and so we
[26:27] give god praise no matter the situation
[26:29] as we said on wednesday no matter if the
[26:30] doctors got it wrong or if it was there
[26:32] and now it's completely well god gets
[26:35] all the glory
[26:36] and uh remember we know devils like to
[26:39] work by getting you to believe a lie
[26:41] right first
[26:42] and then this evil spirit can come upon
[26:44] us
[26:45] so either way it is a true blessing from
[26:46] the lord
[26:48] because that's how many demons enter
[26:50] just by getting you to accept their
[26:51] thought
[26:52] right but we cast down anything that
[26:54] exalts itself against the word of god
[26:57] glory uh let's have a word of prayer for
[26:59] these uh situations here
[27:03] uh i believe that would be it i'm just
[27:06] looking at the list from wednesday about
[27:07] the same okay

[27:20] miracles lord you are living hope today
[27:23] father god
[27:24] the world has a political hope it's a
[27:26] fading hope it's a false hope
[27:28] they have all they have nothing really
[27:30] to hope in but our hope is alive
[27:32] our hope is eternal life as well thank
[27:35] you lord
[27:35] for this living hope that we have the
[27:38] son of god

[28:19] and supply the need for our brother lord
[28:21] god bless him lord and brother amen for
[28:23] their faithful service to you lord god

[28:28] girls the lord that they come to a
[28:29] saving
[28:30] knowledge of you that they would turn
[28:31] from their wicked ways and have a
[28:32] testimony lord god
[28:34] and the girls would be intercessors lord
[28:36] as as we saw with my cousin adam lord to
[28:38] prove it again to our family lord and to

[29:19] like uh the children's teaching i said
[29:21] well let's wait for the blands you know

[29:23] it was kind of on his heart to do it you
[29:24] know he's one that kind of spurred that
[29:26] teaching there
[29:28] um so well let's wait till they get back
[29:31] by the grace of the lord and then we'll
[29:33] get back to do that was a lot of fun
[29:34] when that a lot of fun and
[29:36] i shouldn't say fun i guess i should say
[29:38] it was glorious and joyful i guess it
[29:39] was
[29:40] those are real bible words there it's
[29:42] joy i'll tell you it's a joyful thing
[29:44] to see the children have those things
[29:45] written on their hearts
[29:47] i was really blessed i was really
[29:50] blessed so i thank the lord for that
[29:51] uh what a great uh thing to see that by
[29:54] god's grace
[29:56] so i'd like to um preach here tonight
[29:59] like let's finish this book here
[30:01] uh the book of philippians and uh it's
[30:04] been a great great blessing to me
[30:06] i think if i can i'm gonna have to
[30:09] switch over here
[30:12] just give me a minute here uh we'll look
[30:13] to chapter four verse
[30:15] 19. we'll kind of pick up there where we
[30:17] left off
[30:18] how did i do this last week i'm trying
[30:20] to remember how i did this okay
[30:22] i got two different apartment i got two
[30:24] different adapters there and
[30:25] i gotta hook up the one that goes to the
[30:27] computer here so
[30:29] i'm just finding a little bit easier to
[30:31] use the computer um for the uh
[30:33] the powerpoint here so it just kind of
[30:36] keeps me it slows me down you know it
[30:37] keeps me a little organized i can just
[30:38] put one thought on one screen so
[30:41] it just helps me by god's grace i hope
[30:42] it helps you i know about you but i love
[30:44] seeing quotes when cam and simon will
[30:45] come i love seeing the quotes
[30:47] here's something about it i can remember
[30:49] it better if i just see the cloaks
[30:50] so you can switch over acacia and i just
[30:53] got a few slides here i think
[30:54] uh i didn't know which direction to go
[30:56] tonight i was kind of preparing for like
[30:57] the children's study and then i was
[30:58] preparing to maybe
[31:00] preaching on uh the mystery of the bride
[31:02] as a church but i just got a few minutes
[31:04] in there and i just kind of
[31:05] put this together quickly so bear with
[31:07] me if it's not as organized as i'd like
[31:08] okay
[31:09] let's finish it tonight by god's grace
[31:12] so uh we looked at our memory verse
[31:14] now here's what i wrote this morning
[31:16] after i'll preach one more sermon
[31:18] lord willing uh focusing on god choosing
[31:20] some rich wise great men like paul
[31:23] and herod's servants so that's what
[31:24] we'll look at tonight and then there are
[31:26] saints today like uh
[31:28] there's a preacher today named aaron
[31:29] mcgarry from texas
[31:31] uh he's of course he's alive today you
[31:32] know really wonderful actually no he's
[31:34] not
[31:34] well he moved out for texas now he's in
[31:36] arizona he's uh
[31:38] the walker's pastor now out in arizona
[31:40] scott
[31:41] and kristen by god's grace and it's
[31:43] scott's birthday today so
[31:44] if you think of it send him a text i'm
[31:46] going to send him a text it's brother
[31:47] brooks's birthday today too
[31:48] i got to text him later tonight by god's
[31:50] grace so january 31st so
[31:53] but just the point that brother mcgarry
[31:55] is a very smart man
[31:56] he's a lawyer he's way beyond your
[31:58] pastor
[32:00] and most preachers as far as
[32:02] intelligence
[32:04] uh and then we'll get to like brother uh
[32:06] brother dao bill dao
[32:09] who was a millionaire that god saved
[32:12] through brother branham his ministry
[32:15] and then you know helps support brother
[32:17] brahms message
[32:19] and then even supports a message church
[32:20] today you know the church where my wife
[32:22] and i were married where we were
[32:23] baptized you know
[32:24] lima by god's grace so i just want to
[32:27] take that thought let's go to
[32:28] philippians 4 here i just want to
[32:30] get to that thought here it's just a
[32:33] really wonderful
[32:34] testimony here and i got some good
[32:36] history on paul as well
[32:38] just a little bit about paul and his
[32:40] witness in rome
[32:42] so philippians 4
[32:46] and i want to just gain some
[32:47] encouragement from this that if god can
[32:49] use
[32:50] paul in prison to win souls hopefully
[32:53] god can use us to save a few more souls
[32:55] in akron praise god
[32:56] in this laodicean age in other words
[32:58] what i mean is hopefully god can use us
[33:00] to find a few more
[33:02] uh grains of wheat right that we can
[33:05] glean a few more brother bang praise god
[33:08] we can find a few more grains out there
[33:10] because we know america's been harvested
[33:12] over
[33:12] year after year decade after decade we
[33:14] know she turned it down
[33:16] in 1950 uh but
[33:19] by god's grace you know the combines
[33:21] have gone over america
[33:23] but here we are god wouldn't leave us
[33:24] here to do nothing we have something to
[33:26] do
[33:27] and we must labor till jesus comes in
[33:30] fact jesus i read it this morning in my
[33:31] reading jesus he had compassion he said
[33:34] oh i don't like to see the sheep without
[33:36] a shepherd right
[33:37] he said we need to pray that god will
[33:39] send laborers into the harvest
[33:41] amen praise god and so we got to find
[33:43] that
[33:44] we got to find that we got to find that
[33:46] there's sheep out there
[33:47] and they need a shepherd praise god they
[33:50] need
[33:51] to be fed the word of god that was my
[33:52] prayer that god would feed us again
[33:54] on his unfailing word tonight now verse
[33:58] 19 as we ended there this morning but my
[34:00] god shall supply all your need according
[34:02] to his riches
[34:04] in glory by christ jesus god has
[34:07] provided every person's need down
[34:09] through the age
[34:09] now there's been a few like the i'm
[34:11] sorry not the leper like the beggar
[34:13] lazarus there's been a few
[34:14] that god has given the testimony of you
[34:17] know starving and battling
[34:19] you know not enough food but overall
[34:21] overall the majority of people
[34:23] god has graciously given to everyone and
[34:26] supplied
[34:27] everyone's need on the earth for six
[34:29] thousand years
[34:30] he just provided poured out blessing
[34:32] after blessing he sent rain after rain
[34:35] after rain right snow after snow uh
[34:38] season uh
[34:39] harvest uh i'm sorry planting and then
[34:41] summer then harvest
[34:43] the cycle has and uh uh i'm sorry has
[34:46] gone
[34:46] unending in other words god has
[34:48] faithfully
[34:49] poured out his blessings upon his people
[34:52] and for that
[34:53] he's worthy of our praise yes we've
[34:55] never seen it fail in our life
[34:57] and where i believe we're not going to
[34:59] see it fail
[35:01] again by god's grace i remember in 2008
[35:04] my my wife will remember this
[35:05] 2008 was the the last crash right the
[35:08] last crash
[35:09] uh the economic thing and and a brother
[35:11] come to lima and preached on that you
[35:13] remember that honey brother joe adams
[35:14] preached on
[35:15] and he was saying how people were so
[35:16] concerned about the economy falling and
[35:18] we would lose all of our money and
[35:20] and he kind of brought the scripture how
[35:22] the bible says
[35:24] it's the laodicean age it's rich and
[35:27] increased with goods
[35:29] and he said it's going to go back up and
[35:31] it has gone up
[35:33] right a lot the uh under trump
[35:36] i mean the administration the wall
[35:38] street reaches highest
[35:39] levels now of course we know the
[35:40] billionaires are getting more more rich
[35:42] right
[35:43] that's not really helping but when uh
[35:45] but with some of them they can promote
[35:47] growth and
[35:47] we know church the antichrist is gonna
[35:49] find some secret the bible said
[35:51] he's gonna be able to make craft prosper
[35:55] right so before the end here before the
[35:57] end time he's got to find a way to
[35:59] increase
[35:59] manufacturing he's going to be a
[36:02] provider right and we saw the pope meet
[36:03] with the trillionaire companies or
[36:05] is that a word train i think it is a
[36:07] billionaire companies i should probably
[36:09] say i think there's only a couple of
[36:10] companies that are in the trillions now
[36:12] but anyways uh
[36:14] in other words we don't have to worry
[36:15] you know there's going to be there may
[36:16] be hard times and we don't know all the
[36:18] details about the future
[36:20] but we know this age is the age rich and
[36:22] increased with goods
[36:23] their main mantra is going to be peace
[36:25] and safety
[36:26] and also craft and prospering right
[36:28] that's going to be their main
[36:30] uh mantra and so god likens this age to
[36:34] an age that's rich and increased with
[36:36] goods
[36:37] but remember we got to remember job job
[36:40] came into this trial right
[36:41] when he was at ease and we've got to
[36:43] make sure church that when
[36:45] as we said this morning as paul said
[36:47] when i'm full
[36:48] we have to be able to be spiritual and
[36:50] yet have blessings
[36:52] amen praise god i'm sure sister
[36:56] beatrice sitting there has seen hard
[36:57] times in ghana right
[36:59] i'm sure there's been a lot of poor
[37:00] right but here look at her now
[37:02] in america and uh
[37:06] you know all of us i was i was raised
[37:08] poor right we were on food stamps my
[37:09] almost my whole life except a few
[37:11] seasons where my dad was able to keep a
[37:12] job and
[37:13] wasn't being made fun of because of his
[37:14] name but uh
[37:17] we have to be able to live in this this
[37:19] age where there's so much available
[37:21] and yet we don't take confidence in that
[37:24] right
[37:25] we have to be able to uh we really have
[37:27] to live by faith and not by sight
[37:31] we have to look beyond the natural
[37:33] things and say i'm not taking comfort in
[37:35] the natural things
[37:36] i'm taking comfort in the one who sends
[37:38] these things amen
[37:41] because paul tells him god is going to
[37:43] supply
[37:44] all our needs praise god how many got
[37:47] enough food out there
[37:47] we got enough food out there everybody
[37:49] got enough uh money to pay your bills
[37:51] nobody's going into debt right no one's
[37:53] anybody filing for bankruptcy this month
[37:55] anybody gonna file for bankruptcy
[37:57] thank god amen thank god he supplied
[38:00] every need now we know some people go
[38:02] through those things because of mis
[38:04] managing money in other words disobeying
[38:06] the word that they already know
[38:08] we know a couple people that been
[38:09] through bankruptcy uh i know
[38:11] we have a couple friends and it's
[38:13] because they purposely
[38:14] uh ran up credit cards on purpose and
[38:17] yet they knew better
[38:19] right and so a christian uh you know god
[38:21] will allow people to suffer
[38:24] sometimes because of their own decisions
[38:27] what awful thing what an awful testimony
[38:29] right
[38:30] for a christian but thank god for his
[38:32] amazing grace amen
[38:33] amen because we all fall short we all
[38:35] make mistakes
[38:37] but paul is uh he's telling the the
[38:39] philippians you've sacrificed for me
[38:41] i'm full he said god is going to supply
[38:44] everything you need
[38:45] according to his riches in glory by
[38:47] christ jesus
[38:48] that ought to remind us where paul where
[38:50] jesus said don't worry about what you're
[38:52] going to eat
[38:53] don't worry about what you're going to
[38:54] wear but seek first be worried be
[38:57] concerned not worry but
[38:58] be concerned about the kingdom of god
[39:00] amen
[39:01] and the righteousness you living the
[39:04] righteousness of jesus christ
[39:06] and he said all these things will be
[39:07] added unto you
[39:09] praise god what a confirmation what a
[39:12] consolation
[39:13] that paul gives us here and if we
[39:16] continue i love that thought from this
[39:17] morning
[39:18] if we continue to make constant
[39:19] sacrifices to the lord
[39:21] constantly praising him thanking him
[39:24] praying and then giving
[39:25] if we constantly plant those seeds god
[39:28] is going to bring forth the fruits of
[39:29] righteousness in our lives
[39:32] and that's what i found in my life i
[39:33] know i say it often but i found
[39:35] going from very little income to a more
[39:37] comfortable income
[39:38] i found the more i give the more god
[39:41] gives me
[39:43] that's true i i i'm not
[39:46] not boasting on me or anything i'm
[39:47] boasting on god amen
[39:49] the more god gives me even children the
[39:52] more the more we give to him the more he
[39:54] blesses us amen
[39:56] and of course god is free to take it all
[39:58] away because our
[39:59] he has a testimony he has a he has a
[40:02] work he's trying to do in our lives
[40:04] we have to be we have to know him in the
[40:06] power of the resurrection but also
[40:08] in the fellowship of his sufferings amen
[40:11] and so the real faith of god uh anchors
[40:15] in your heart
[40:16] and so you learn we're learning
[40:18] contentment right
[40:19] we're learning contentment whether we're
[40:21] full or whether we're not so full
[40:23] because i don't think anybody here has
[40:24] been empty right
[40:26] has anybody here been empty and you have
[40:27] no money ever
[40:30] and you you know you don't put any you
[40:31] don't put any gas in your car you have
[40:33] no money for gas in your car
[40:35] has anybody been that low before i hope
[40:37] no hands come up because i feel bad
[40:39] because i want to know if you do because
[40:40] i can help you out by god's grace we
[40:42] want to help you out
[40:43] i can call church i can call pastors i
[40:45] can call pastors in five minutes
[40:47] and i can have money on the way in a
[40:48] couple of days to help you out
[40:50] that's how much people love you that's
[40:52] how much people love us
[40:53] as christians i know i i've talked to
[40:56] them before about it
[40:56] i could call them we could have whatever
[40:58] you know we could meet your need
[41:01] and that's because jesus said if you
[41:03] forsake your worldly family that doesn't
[41:05] believe in me he said i'll give you a
[41:06] hundred fold in this life amen
[41:09] and also in the life to come praise god
[41:12] the thing is i've never really asked
[41:13] people for money so i thank god for that
[41:15] i hope i don't have to brother bang
[41:17] that's my prayer that god will allow us
[41:19] to be so
[41:20] uh in tune with his holy spirit and
[41:22] we'll just keep investing seeds
[41:24] that god will keep sending it and i
[41:26] won't have to ask for money
[41:29] i made that a rule of my life i'll never
[41:31] ask anybody for money
[41:32] i don't think i have yet once by god's
[41:34] grace other than god
[41:37] i got to ask him of course but i can't
[41:40] think of one time i did ask somebody for
[41:42] money
[41:43] and i don't want to because i know god
[41:46] is going to supply
[41:47] all my needs praise god and that's the
[41:50] great word there
[41:51] need god promises to supply our needs
[41:55] amen now let's go to verse that was
[41:58] verse 19. i'm going to go to
[41:59] verse 20. uh i don't have a verse i
[42:03] don't have a i don't have
[42:04] a slide for 20. so let me just read 20.
[42:06] these are just very simple things
[42:07] now unto the god and our father be uh
[42:10] glory forever
[42:11] amen so it's interesting he gives a amen
[42:14] and then he
[42:15] gives a salute after this amen usually
[42:17] means so be it that's the end
[42:19] did you notice too earlier this is just
[42:21] interesting paul said
[42:23] uh finally he said finally like a few
[42:25] times
[42:27] in the scripture oh yeah he said finally
[42:29] in chapter three
[42:31] yeah three verse one he said finally my
[42:33] brethren rejoice in the lord
[42:34] and then he says uh finally in chapter
[42:37] four verse eight so if i say i'm gonna
[42:39] close two or three times
[42:40] i got a scripture for it okay because he
[42:43] said finally in chapter three
[42:45] and then he says finally in chapter four
[42:47] and then he says amen
[42:48] in verse 20 and then he says amen in
[42:52] verse 23.
[42:55] so i got scripture now
[42:58] not that i want to get that reputation
[43:02] is that something paul says finally he
[43:05] he brings these thoughts and he just
[43:06] said then finally again
[43:09] and then he says amen and then he says
[43:10] it again i'm not trying to make a
[43:12] doctrine of that
[43:13] i'm just saying it's interesting that
[43:14] that a man can say that think he's going
[43:16] to close and then he gets a little more
[43:18] by god's grace
[43:20] so i just feel like i'll just say like
[43:21] this the more we pull on god
[43:23] the more he gives out amen let me say
[43:25] like this some people might have been
[43:26] done with the service
[43:27] and i might have said i'm going to close
[43:29] but then people might start pulling
[43:30] because they're more hungry for more of
[43:32] god amen
[43:33] so i have to go a little longer by god's
[43:35] grace
[43:36] amen and i'm glad i've done it many
[43:40] times i'm glad because like amen and who
[43:41] are like when you guys received the holy
[43:42] ghost wasn't it after people went out
[43:44] so it's like we said amen but it wasn't
[43:46] praise god there's some more praise god
[43:50] hallelujah thank the lord amen
[43:54] i'm not making a doctrine that i'm just
[43:55] saying it's just interesting god and our
[43:57] father be glory forever and
[43:59] forever and ever amen
[44:03] so all this boils down to all the wisdom
[44:05] paul pours out
[44:06] he boils it down to we're giving god and
[44:08] our father
[44:09] glory forever and ever amen now verse 21
[44:12] salute all every saint in christ jesus
[44:16] the brethren which are with me greet you
[44:18] how would they have done that they would
[44:19] just would have read the letter right
[44:21] and we said paul sends his greetings we
[44:23] salute you we encourage you now let me
[44:25] look up that word salute here let me
[44:26] i never looked that one up actually
[44:32] okay just to embrace to salute to bid
[44:34] welcome to wish well to okay
[44:36] i don't know if there's some spiritual
[44:37] meaning behind it of course they had
[44:38] holy kisses to greet one another with a
[44:40] holy kiss you see that there
[44:43] uh respect okay just recognizing them
[44:45] okay so i thought maybe it was something
[44:47] more than that
[44:49] he says greet them recognize them in
[44:52] verse 21 slew every saint
[44:54] uh now verse 22 is where we're going to
[44:56] get to i want to spend a few minutes on
[44:57] this by god's grace
[45:00] he said all the saints salute you now
[45:02] paul's in rome he's in a prison
[45:04] in rome at least according to uh these
[45:06] commentators that i was reading today
[45:08] all the saints in rome now he's in a
[45:11] prison right but he's got helpers
[45:12] epiphanists go back and forth
[45:14] ever first they go back and forth
[45:16] philippi and rome and then he's got
[45:18] other saints there as well that are with
[45:20] him there in rome
[45:21] all the saints salute you chiefly that
[45:24] are of caesar's
[45:26] household okay so now we get this idea
[45:28] caesar
[45:29] right caesar who's caesar this is an
[45:32] interesting thought
[45:34] now i hope that's not too small but i'm
[45:36] going to read this here
[45:37] nero was at this time emperor of rome he
[45:40] was actually the
[45:41] one of the worst most bloodiest emperors
[45:43] of all
[45:44] nero a more worthless
[45:48] cruel and diabolic wretch never disgrace
[45:51] the name
[45:52] or form of man so you thought hitler was
[45:55] bad maybe this guy was the precursor to
[45:56] hitler
[45:58] this is what the uh the historian adam
[46:00] clark a preacher in the 1800s this is
[46:02] what he says
[46:03] there was never a more wicked man
[46:05] because remember he did the 10 years
[46:07] nero did the 10 years of bitter
[46:08] persecution where they killed everything
[46:10] that was even close
[46:11] christian jew out of rome it was uh
[46:14] jesus said that was the 10 days remember
[46:16] in the church ages
[46:17] he said that's the 10 days you got to
[46:18] overcome you'll have troubles 10 days
[46:21] but i love how jesus gave him a warning
[46:23] praise god they knew it was coming amen
[46:26] hallelujah i like how the holy spirit
[46:28] gives you uh
[46:29] a warning of what's coming to prepare
[46:31] your faith because then he said be
[46:33] faithful
[46:34] not until death you don't give up at
[46:36] death he said you're faithful unto
[46:38] death praise god in other words you
[46:40] accept your role as a martyr
[46:42] if god's called me to die then i'll lay
[46:44] my life down for the cause of christ
[46:46] because if jesus did it i can do it
[46:48] praise god
[46:50] there was never a more wretched man than
[46:53] nero
[46:54] so there's christians in the did i read
[46:58] that right of
[46:59] nero's household
[47:03] hallelujah he says yet his fam
[47:06] yeah it is family there were christians
[47:09] but whether this relates to the members
[47:10] of the imperial family or to the guards
[47:12] or courtiers or the servants
[47:14] we cannot tell so no one really knows
[47:16] but there's people close to the
[47:18] the uh the caesar that's the word i want
[47:22] to say
[47:22] caesar i was thinking herod that's the
[47:24] next scripture we'll get to
[47:27] there's people close to the caesar the
[47:29] most powerful man in earth i wonder if
[47:31] there's any saints up in the white house
[47:32] anymore
[47:34] i don't know that's going to be a tough
[47:35] one there was a
[47:38] they at least had bible studies under
[47:39] the past administration now
[47:41] and they talk you know they talk some
[47:43] things i got i have articles on that
[47:44] they thought some things that are pretty
[47:46] close to the message
[47:47] like men are supposed to rule the church
[47:48] and rule uh their homes and everything
[47:51] like that
[47:52] i got i got articles on that he said but
[47:55] even if some of his slaves were
[47:57] converted to christianity it would be
[47:59] sufficiently
[48:00] marvelous oh think about that church the
[48:03] most wicked man of all
[48:05] but let's say it's some of his servants
[48:06] some of his servants are walking around
[48:08] doing his bidding and maybe it's a
[48:09] secret maybe they had to keep it a
[48:10] secret
[48:11] but can you imagine there's the presence
[48:13] of god there amen
[48:15] there and that person represents god's
[48:17] mercy to that house praise god
[48:20] right because because the bible said god
[48:21] will not leave himself without a witness
[48:24] nero won't get there hitler won't get
[48:25] there and say well nobody told me or
[48:26] nobody
[48:27] no the god placed people there to
[48:29] witness to them to try to bring them the
[48:31] repentance
[48:32] that was a great sign of god's love
[48:36] he said salute those chiefly
[48:39] specifically those of uh caesar's house
[48:42] specifically those of nero's house
[48:44] make sure you salute them praise god
[48:48] amen
[48:51] he said converse to christianity in this
[48:53] family there certainly were
[48:55] and this shows how powerfully ah
[48:57] hallelujah the divine word had been
[48:59] preached and spread
[49:00] amen even amongst murderers a murderous
[49:03] king even around him god still sent the
[49:05] word so close to him
[49:06] to give him a chance to be able to
[49:08] witness that there was christians
[49:10] in in the midst praise god they must
[49:12] have kept it a secret
[49:15] right because he was he went on the
[49:16] rampage or maybe it was before the
[49:18] rampage or after the rampage i'm not
[49:19] quite sure
[49:20] i didn't get that far in the study of
[49:21] history but that's like what this says
[49:23] now look at this is beautiful that the
[49:25] empress
[49:26] papaya i'm not sure papaya i'm not sure
[49:29] if i'm saying that right
[49:31] this is nero's second wife may have been
[49:33] favorably inclined to christianity
[49:35] is possible for josephus he was a
[49:38] historian
[49:39] he was the one he even he was a jewish
[49:41] historian and he
[49:42] wrote about jesus he he said he said uh
[49:45] all the jew or there was jews that
[49:47] followed a man named jesus and they ate
[49:49] his
[49:49] flesh and drink his blood they were
[49:51] cannibals so see he would he
[49:54] was a witness that jesus was a real
[49:55] person and josephus was even there a
[49:58] historian
[49:59] when an uh uh titus came and destroyed
[50:02] jerusalem in 87
[50:03] he was a witness to that he's the one
[50:04] that wrote that blood flew out of the
[50:06] temple like a river
[50:07] it was so awful he was a witness to
[50:09] those things remember he was also the
[50:11] man
[50:12] that said five years before titus came
[50:14] every christian was out of jerusalem
[50:16] praise god
[50:17] because they took heed to jesus's
[50:19] warning amen and jesus said when you see
[50:21] them come
[50:22] go to the mountains amen run when you
[50:25] see those
[50:26] armies come in run and pray that your
[50:28] flight be not in winter praise god
[50:32] so even joseph and josephus relates of
[50:35] papaya papaya that's a strange name
[50:39] she was a worshiper of the true god it's
[50:41] not likely therefore that she threw any
[50:43] hindrances in the way of her servants
[50:44] who might wish
[50:45] to embrace the christian faith so it's
[50:47] likely herod's i'm sorry
[50:49] nero's second wife knew there were
[50:50] saints there just didn't tell hubby
[50:54] right of course a lot of those marriages
[50:56] were arranged
[50:57] based upon status right many times there
[50:59] was status so some
[51:01] so somehow a second wife got saved
[51:04] according to josephus and she would
[51:06] protect
[51:07] those that were christians
[51:10] church it's been happening all down
[51:12] through the age remember when athaliah
[51:14] uh jezebel's daughter came into power
[51:17] what'd they do they hid
[51:19] the next king he was a little baby they
[51:21] hit him for seven years and then when
[51:22] he's seven
[51:23] they brought him out and condom is king
[51:25] and
[51:26] believers are always hiding away when
[51:28] there's times they gotta hide away
[51:30] there's times they fight against it
[51:31] there are times they give their lives
[51:33] but there's other times they hide away
[51:35] for another time in season ordained to
[51:37] the lord praise god
[51:39] so wouldn't stumble me if somebody had
[51:42] to be hidden away praise god
[51:46] look what he says here saint jerome and
[51:49] philemon
[51:50] states that saint paul had converted
[51:52] many now look at this
[51:53] jerome a saint not actually don't know
[51:56] his history
[51:56] but interesting he says paul converted
[51:59] many in caesar's family
[52:00] which would make sense why he said uh
[52:03] all the saints salute you chiefly they
[52:05] that are of caesar's household
[52:07] these converts i got here uh they're
[52:09] they're closely connected to the white
[52:11] house can i just say it like that
[52:12] they're closely connected to the white
[52:14] house he said and they want to send
[52:16] their greetings to you praise god
[52:18] now they're new believers and they'd
[52:20] love to meet you they'd love to
[52:22] fellowship with you praise god
[52:25] in other words be encouraged although
[52:26] there's a murderer in the white house
[52:28] and that's about what we got now
[52:30] did you see the abortion i mentioned
[52:32] this morning that uh they're sending
[52:33] more money so more countries can do
[52:35] abortion church
[52:36] it's got to fulfill that all nations
[52:38] will worship the the beast right
[52:40] so he's got to send him money so so that
[52:42] they can fulfill their evil desires to
[52:45] for death and destruction it's got to
[52:47] happen
[52:49] you know it actually works both ways
[52:51] right church the deep calls to the deep
[52:52] it actually works both ways
[52:54] if you've got a deep calling for
[52:55] righteousness god's going to make sure
[52:57] you get it praise god
[52:58] but if you've got a desire for evil god
[53:01] will allow you to have that too
[53:03] because he gave us free more agency and
[53:05] he can't force us to do these things
[53:07] so either way thank god whatever longing
[53:09] you have in your heart
[53:10] it's going to come to you and if you
[53:12] long to go to heaven if you long to
[53:14] worship jesus
[53:15] if you long to worship at his feet if
[53:18] you long to live with him eternally
[53:19] there's got to be a deep to respond amen
[53:22] and that's why you're here tonight
[53:23] praise god hallelujah
[53:28] so he tells them i want to let you know
[53:31] these people in the white house there's
[53:33] some believers up there by god's grace
[53:35] that's kind of what he's saying right
[53:37] they really want to send their salute to
[53:39] you
[53:39] praise god now remember chapter one paul
[53:42] said i've seen that my arrest
[53:44] has gone for the furthest of the gospel
[53:47] praise god
[53:48] right he said because now prisoners are
[53:50] not prisoners yeah prisoners and
[53:52] and guards have heard the gospel because
[53:55] i've
[53:56] been in a roman jail and i know people
[53:59] i've converted some of
[54:00] the president's own people oh
[54:04] my what a saint praise god
[54:07] in prison yet converting i wonder how he
[54:09] baptized them i wonder if they had like
[54:11] bathtubs in the prisons or something
[54:13] like that or horse troughs like they got
[54:16] today right
[54:16] people will get the horse trough and oh
[54:18] we were gonna do that with an uh
[54:20] uh picture right we're gonna one time we
[54:22] got i went and got that that thing's
[54:23] that one thing was actually wasn't too
[54:24] heavy it's actually kind of light that's
[54:26] how they got to do it a lot of churches
[54:28] do that
[54:29] any method to do it there's something in
[54:32] the christian i've just got to keep the
[54:33] word of god amen
[54:35] jesus said he that believeth and is
[54:37] baptized shall be saved amen
[54:41] he said listen there's these people at
[54:43] the white house they want to send their
[54:44] greetings
[54:45] they got converted under my ministry ah
[54:48] thank the lord amen
[54:50] thank god for his amazing grace now look
[54:52] at this adam clark ends it by saying
[54:55] being by the emperor cast into prison
[54:58] paul
[54:58] became the more known to the emperor's
[55:02] family
[55:03] oh my goodness and he turned the house
[55:05] of christ's
[55:06] persecutor into a church
[55:10] amen praise god i don't know if this is
[55:12] before or after nero did those 10 years
[55:16] but history says god sent him in there
[55:18] to the house of the murderer
[55:20] and converted part of it and it became a
[55:23] church
[55:24] praise god amen hallelujah
[55:29] so see church let's not just give up
[55:30] let's not give up let's remember that
[55:33] all things work together for good to
[55:35] them that love the lord amen
[55:36] amen coven's going to work together
[55:38] somehow cope is going to work together
[55:40] to give god glory amen
[55:42] it looks like they're being shut out it
[55:44] looks like that but let's see what
[55:45] happens praise god
[55:47] maybe god will have to use the uh the
[55:49] internet more as we
[55:50] obviously know he may have to use that
[55:52] more or may he may open it up
[55:53] soon uh you know the the flights are
[55:56] soon again i've seen things about if you
[55:58] got a
[55:58] vaccine you'll be able to fly and uh
[56:02] or if you wear a mask you'll certainly
[56:04] be able to fly
[56:06] mercy goodness gracious you know i'm the
[56:08] one if anyone needs a mask it's me
[56:10] because all this spitfire out of my
[56:11] mouth you know
[56:12] that's about it but not really on a
[56:14] plane
[56:16] interesting it's amazing that in the
[56:18] house in the house of death
[56:20] god and jesus send life into the house
[56:22] of death praise god
[56:23] because god is he's a god rich in mercy
[56:26] praise god
[56:28] not all those around the president of
[56:30] that day were murderers
[56:32] so god sent the word not only the word a
[56:34] prophet
[56:36] the word prophet praise god into the
[56:40] into we'd say the white house of that
[56:41] day amazing
[56:43] i know about you church but i like to
[56:45] sing that song amazing grace how sweet
[56:46] the sound
[56:48] that saved a wretch like me praise god
[56:51] now just want to look at this here this
[56:53] reminded me of a message i preached long
[56:55] ago about herod
[56:56] this was even before i was a pastor i
[56:58] preached a message called the leaven of
[56:59] herod
[57:01] heaven i'm sorry herod's leaven was
[57:04] uh lust of the flesh then you might have
[57:06] remembered when i preached out lima you
[57:07] might
[57:08] i don't know if you remember that's a
[57:08] long time ago uh
[57:11] but i preached a message called the
[57:12] levin of herod and i never it was just
[57:14] amazing message the thought that the
[57:16] holy spirit gave me it was amazing to me
[57:18] but uh herod was known
[57:22] remember herod had a second wife right
[57:24] herodias
[57:26] uh he liked to watch his stepdaughter
[57:29] dance seductively
[57:31] but yeah and all that the bible said he
[57:34] actually obeyed john the baptist a
[57:36] little bit
[57:37] remember in other words can i say like
[57:40] this he respected brother branham
[57:42] but he liked his worldly dressed women
[57:43] and dancing and
[57:45] sexuality you guys say like that
[57:48] married twice we got a lot of that
[57:50] around the message too married twice and
[57:52] three times four times many times that's
[57:55] a sign of people's
[57:57] uh state with the lord now of course
[57:59] don't get me wrong church god can
[58:01] forgive all that praise god
[58:02] if god can forgive david as a doctor who
[58:05] did it on purpose right as we saw this
[58:07] morning
[58:08] talk about a need for a guilt offering
[58:10] or a trespass offering
[58:12] all right boy if anybody needed a ram it
[58:14] was david right amen
[58:17] they come out of his loins praise god
[58:19] amen hallelujah
[58:21] of the sea of david it came out if
[58:23] anybody needed a ram
[58:25] it was david so it proves god can
[58:27] forgive adultery they can be saved
[58:29] i don't know if they can be raptured
[58:31] program tries to give them some hope
[58:32] maybe
[58:33] but they certainly can be saved if they
[58:36] confess their sins
[58:39] but herod was a man who
[58:42] loved licentiousness i think the actual
[58:46] word is in the king james licentiousness
[58:49] which just means passions and lust of
[58:51] the flesh
[58:54] but i i i saw the same thing in jesus's
[58:57] ministry
[58:59] there were certain women healed of evil
[59:01] spirits and infirmities mary called
[59:02] magdalene
[59:03] out of whom went seven devils i wonder
[59:05] how many devils went out of me i just
[59:06] wonder about that
[59:08] all my addictions i wonder how many went
[59:09] out of me praise god
[59:11] amen at least one at least one
[59:15] and joanna let's look at this joanna the
[59:17] wife of chuza
[59:20] herod's steward herod herod
[59:24] the great herod right herod the great
[59:26] the time of jesus
[59:29] and susannah and many others which
[59:31] ministered unto him
[59:33] of their substance so so a wife
[59:36] a wife of chooser who worked for the
[59:39] president i'll say like that or one of
[59:40] the great mayors or
[59:42] governor we might say some great man
[59:45] the wife of a great man left him
[59:49] and what left her husband there so he
[59:50] could keep working for the for herod
[59:53] and then started following jesus in
[59:56] other words there were only one person
[59:57] away
[59:58] from we'd say the governor's mansion
[1:00:00] right
[1:00:02] or the white house they're only one
[1:00:04] family away
[1:00:06] and so see we we see again how god he
[1:00:09] has witnesses everywhere
[1:00:11] his word is going to get to every corner
[1:00:14] every uh nook and cranny of the earth
[1:00:16] praise god
[1:00:18] we can see how god is going to make sure
[1:00:20] this message gets to every nation amen
[1:00:23] amen it's so it's such a small world oh
[1:00:26] yeah in fact
[1:00:26] i went to the doctor this week uh my
[1:00:28] physical therapist because i got a i got
[1:00:30] a
[1:00:30] hip flexor injury and just to say what a
[1:00:33] small world it was i said how are you
[1:00:35] doing sir his name's greg
[1:00:37] he's like where are you from and we
[1:00:38] start talking he's like you know what
[1:00:39] i'm from a nearby
[1:00:40] town than that i said really uh he's
[1:00:43] right
[1:00:44] uh he said he's uh what three years
[1:00:46] younger than me or three years older
[1:00:47] than me
[1:00:48] and he played football or like like
[1:00:50] we're just so connected and then he was
[1:00:51] that he went to ohio state and he was
[1:00:53] there when i played football at ohio
[1:00:54] state he was at that game literally at
[1:00:56] that game
[1:00:56] and i said man where i said it's just
[1:00:58] such a small world praise god
[1:01:00] so i got i got some meetings with him
[1:01:02] i'm hoping to take my book on uh
[1:01:03] tuesday i'm going to try to give my book
[1:01:05] to him and see if he wants it he's got
[1:01:06] four daughters so i'm just going to pray
[1:01:07] for him
[1:01:08] i thought my what a small world we both
[1:01:10] played football at the same time
[1:01:11] we both were like state champions and
[1:01:13] then we were both there at
[1:01:14] ohio state together and now we're we're
[1:01:17] both living in this area and we both
[1:01:18] meet together we have so much in common
[1:01:21] it was uh just interesting that god is
[1:01:24] going to find a way
[1:01:25] to get his word to all those who want to
[1:01:27] hear it praise god
[1:01:29] and he's also going to take it to those
[1:01:30] that don't want to hear it because they
[1:01:31] have to have a witness against them
[1:01:34] but here we see herod stewart now
[1:01:37] joanna's husband was probably the
[1:01:40] landscaper for herod now this is what
[1:01:42] the history says
[1:01:43] like joseph joseph and potiphar's house
[1:01:47] so you know her husband chuseo probably
[1:01:50] wasn't a great man like we'd say like a
[1:01:52] president or vice president
[1:01:55] but uh this is what i believe this is uh
[1:01:57] albert barnes he was another 1800s
[1:02:00] preacher
[1:02:01] herod antipas who reigned in galilee he
[1:02:03] was a son of hair of the great that's
[1:02:05] the one who killed all the babies
[1:02:06] about the time of jesus birth the word
[1:02:09] steward means one who has to
[1:02:10] charge of the domestic affairs of a
[1:02:12] family to provide for it
[1:02:15] the office was generally held by a slave
[1:02:17] who was esteemed the most faithful
[1:02:20] and was often conferred as a reward of
[1:02:22] fidelity
[1:02:24] okay so likely uh chuza was just a slave
[1:02:29] but he was a real faithful brother
[1:02:31] i don't know if he was a christian but
[1:02:32] his wife was a christian at least she
[1:02:34] loved jesus
[1:02:36] and so jesus think of this
[1:02:39] god in flesh the word made flesh the god
[1:02:43] of heaven praise god
[1:02:45] was on earth and one of herod's
[1:02:48] servant's wife followed the god of
[1:02:50] heaven
[1:02:52] all she had to do was tell her husband
[1:02:54] and then the husband he just had to
[1:02:55] maybe
[1:02:55] pass by the the herod at some time and
[1:02:58] tell him
[1:02:59] my wife's following god yeah i mean just
[1:03:01] think how close this was together
[1:03:05] he was making himself known he was
[1:03:08] making himself known to the humble
[1:03:10] thank god for us because there's nobody
[1:03:12] great here tonight
[1:03:14] right no great millionaire or
[1:03:16] billionaire here or
[1:03:17] entrepreneur here tonight right there's
[1:03:20] no elon musk or uh
[1:03:22] jeff bezos or anybody major that's major
[1:03:24] here
[1:03:25] we're just common people but that's the
[1:03:28] way we like it praise god amen
[1:03:32] now what's interesting church is that i
[1:03:34] shared this a few years ago
[1:03:36] um the god
[1:03:39] sent me to akron and i was around
[1:03:42] football players
[1:03:44] three of whom would be go to super bowls
[1:03:46] and win super bowls
[1:03:47] and i've been in contact with them and
[1:03:49] trying to you know over the years i've
[1:03:50] been in contact not recently
[1:03:52] but some of them wanted to talk to me
[1:03:54] and i've i've tried to set up things but
[1:03:55] then they don't get back to me they
[1:03:56] actually stopped texting me so i was
[1:03:58] i was doing my part brother bang these
[1:04:00] they got super bowl rings and they're
[1:04:01] millionaires and every
[1:04:03] and i did my part to try to reach out to
[1:04:04] them but they don't want to talk to me
[1:04:05] about it
[1:04:06] but look at that here's the here's the
[1:04:08] message of the hour
[1:04:10] that's going to judge them right i mean
[1:04:12] it's going to judge us
[1:04:14] we want to be judged righteous praise
[1:04:15] god hear the word of the hour sent to
[1:04:18] millionaires and they're just a step
[1:04:20] away from
[1:04:21] owners and billionaires and and think
[1:04:24] how close
[1:04:26] people are to the word of god if they're
[1:04:29] just hungry
[1:04:30] if they're just thirsty jesus said if
[1:04:32] you just hunger and thirst i'll fill you
[1:04:35] think about that all's it took and and i
[1:04:37] even went to church with one of the
[1:04:38] brothers
[1:04:39] he was a he won two super bowls
[1:04:42] i went to church with that guy we went
[1:04:44] to church together
[1:04:45] really nice guy uh
[1:04:49] but then i was asking about some things
[1:04:51] they stopped texting me back but that's
[1:04:52] okay
[1:04:53] i thought man it just it's striking
[1:04:55] think think how close
[1:04:58] and i told him about the message they
[1:04:59] knew i believe william branham was a
[1:05:00] prophet they knew that
[1:05:03] and look how close they were so look
[1:05:04] church what i'm trying to say is that
[1:05:05] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:05:08] and forever
[1:05:08] he's revealing himself to the humble but
[1:05:10] he's also given
[1:05:12] the great of this world a chance to hear
[1:05:14] it as well
[1:05:15] and i rejoice in that praise god don't
[1:05:17] you i rejoice in that praise god
[1:05:20] that he's so merciful he even gives
[1:05:23] the great of this world a chance to
[1:05:25] receive it
[1:05:27] so this was only two we'd say two
[1:05:30] relationships away
[1:05:32] choose his wife chuza and then herod
[1:05:36] who worked you know jesus who worked for
[1:05:38] the great one of the greatest man on
[1:05:39] earth right there
[1:05:41] it was so close god's word was so close
[1:05:44] and this just wasn't a prophet this just
[1:05:45] wasn't brother ram
[1:05:46] this was god amen god and he's never
[1:05:50] leaving himself without a witness praise
[1:05:52] god
[1:05:53] i love god's word now look at this this
[1:05:55] is this came to me as i was studying
[1:05:57] for ye see your calling brethren how
[1:05:59] that not many wise
[1:06:02] men after the flesh not many mighty
[1:06:09] not many noble are called now naturally
[1:06:13] right there's not many natural mighty
[1:06:16] men
[1:06:16] wise men noble men there's not many that
[1:06:19] are called we know brother and was sent
[1:06:20] to some kings right i went through the
[1:06:21] list i saw that
[1:06:22] list of all the mighty men he was sent
[1:06:24] to but not many are called
[1:06:27] why because god has chosen the foolish
[1:06:30] things of the world
[1:06:32] to confound them in other words they
[1:06:34] can't humble themselves to accept the
[1:06:36] simple truth of god's word
[1:06:37] oh you mean women never have to cut
[1:06:39] their hair oh you mean god sent a
[1:06:40] prophet today
[1:06:41] really but god has chosen the weak
[1:06:45] things of the world
[1:06:46] amen that's you and i praise god amen
[1:06:49] to confound the things which are mighty
[1:06:52] praise god
[1:06:53] they can't in other words they can't
[1:06:54] figure us out can i just say like that
[1:06:57] let me just use my situation the super
[1:06:59] bowl guys can't figure us out
[1:07:01] for my situation that's the closest i've
[1:07:03] been in contact with
[1:07:05] they saw me they saw me wear i wore my
[1:07:07] sweatpants when they wore their shorts
[1:07:10] i kept my shirt on when they took their
[1:07:12] shirts off
[1:07:13] praise god that's a witness brother bang
[1:07:15] because it was hot
[1:07:17] we were sweating it up but it's a
[1:07:19] witness
[1:07:20] he shows something weak something humble
[1:07:23] to confound
[1:07:24] them that are wise
[1:07:28] i love it because remember jesus said
[1:07:30] jesus didn't he wasn't sad about this
[1:07:32] the bible i don't have the scripture but
[1:07:33] jesus said i rejoice
[1:07:35] that you've hid these things from the
[1:07:37] wise and prudent and reveal them unto
[1:07:39] babes such as would learn praise god
[1:07:42] it made jesus happy to think that the
[1:07:44] world will turn it down
[1:07:45] but i'll give it to somebody who really
[1:07:47] cares somebody that's able to humble
[1:07:49] themselves i'll give it to somebody that
[1:07:51] knows me and loves me
[1:07:53] that's you and i there's not
[1:07:56] many the bible said there's not a lot
[1:07:59] of smart people like i showed you
[1:08:02] there's aaron mcgarry he's a real smart
[1:08:03] guy
[1:08:04] he's a lawyer he can he can
[1:08:07] he can understand the law he can try to
[1:08:10] pardon people that have been falsely
[1:08:11] accused
[1:08:12] he can make arguments before a judge can
[1:08:14] imagine i like to watch him sometime
[1:08:16] i wonder if he's live on tv or something
[1:08:17] like that they got court tv or something
[1:08:19] i'm sure they got that
[1:08:21] i like to watch him argue his case
[1:08:23] before a judge you know
[1:08:24] like it's kind of like rightly dividing
[1:08:25] the word isn't it like
[1:08:27] we did with our debate and just like any
[1:08:29] service you have to rightly divide you
[1:08:31] have to show this is right
[1:08:32] this is wrong this is mistly applied
[1:08:34] there right this is it's not applied
[1:08:35] correctly this law wasn't applied and
[1:08:37] i'd like to watch that but you have many
[1:08:39] wise men bibles and not many wise men
[1:08:42] after the flesh are called to be
[1:08:45] christians
[1:08:47] so that's why i don't feel bad i'm not
[1:08:50] the smartest guy
[1:08:51] you know if i can't understand something
[1:08:53] i don't feel bad
[1:08:54] because the bible says not many of the
[1:08:56] wise are called
[1:08:58] i just i want but i do want to get
[1:08:59] smarter i want to do the best i can
[1:09:00] right i want to i want to grow in grace
[1:09:02] with the knowledge of the lord
[1:09:04] right i want to grow in that
[1:09:07] but it's a spiritual growth more than a
[1:09:09] natural growth more than
[1:09:10] natural understanding so in other words
[1:09:12] you're not going to see me get on an app
[1:09:13] to try to be smarter although i was
[1:09:15] doing that for a while for editing the
[1:09:16] book but i stopped doing that
[1:09:17] a while ago i'm not going to try to be
[1:09:20] smarter and try to
[1:09:21] understand all those things although you
[1:09:23] might need it for your job
[1:09:24] but what i want to understand is how can
[1:09:26] i take up my cross daily and follow
[1:09:28] jesus better amen
[1:09:30] that's what i want to know praise god
[1:09:34] and how can i abound in utterance
[1:09:36] brother bang how can i abound
[1:09:38] for the amen in in faith how can i
[1:09:40] abound in that that's what i want to
[1:09:41] understand praise god
[1:09:44] like we looked at last week i want to
[1:09:46] abound you want to uh you want to
[1:09:48] overflow in these things
[1:09:52] abound in giving abound in wisdom
[1:09:55] right abound in uh faith and utterance
[1:09:58] and
[1:09:58] all these blessings we want to abound in
[1:10:00] the things of god how many want to bound
[1:10:02] by god's grace amen
[1:10:04] but see not so much the wise things the
[1:10:07] wise things of the world but remember
[1:10:10] the bible said this
[1:10:12] we're not wise in the natural but
[1:10:14] spiritually we are wise
[1:10:16] and we're not noble of let's say donald
[1:10:19] trump's bloodline or joe biden's
[1:10:20] bloodline or
[1:10:21] the clinton bloodline we're not noble
[1:10:23] that way but the bible says we're
[1:10:25] spiritually noble
[1:10:26] if we search the word every day praise
[1:10:28] god amen
[1:10:31] right i'm i'm by the blood of jesus i'm
[1:10:33] connected to the most
[1:10:34] royal family there ever was amen
[1:10:37] because we search the scripture daily we
[1:10:39] want to grow in grace and knowledge of
[1:10:41] the lord
[1:10:44] i'm sitting amongst noble nobility here
[1:10:46] tonight
[1:10:47] i shall i'm standing but here we are
[1:10:50] we're amongst kings and priests unto god
[1:10:53] oh my just picture your bang's crown you
[1:10:56] know
[1:10:57] just picture the crown that you got
[1:10:59] we're sitting amongst
[1:11:00] royalty tonight by god's grace isn't
[1:11:02] that wonderful
[1:11:04] hallelujah paul said i know there's a
[1:11:07] crown waiting for me
[1:11:08] and not to me only but all those that
[1:11:11] love is appearing
[1:11:13] there's a crown for you church there's a
[1:11:14] crown if you overcome by god's grace
[1:11:17] you got to overcome you got to fight the
[1:11:18] battle and jesus places a crowd on you
[1:11:21] oh my
[1:11:23] everybody wants to cry on them right
[1:11:25] everyone everyone wants something that
[1:11:27] looks like they're ruling and look like
[1:11:28] they got authority well that's
[1:11:30] the thing to do is get authority now use
[1:11:32] the authority of god's word now praise
[1:11:34] god
[1:11:34] if you take god's authority now he'll
[1:11:36] make you a ruler over much praise god
[1:11:39] amen i never started my timer so i'm not
[1:11:43] even sure where i'm at on time
[1:11:44] what do we start for okay so i was
[1:11:46] probably preaching about 4 30. okay
[1:11:48] all right here let me set timer now give
[1:11:49] me about 15 more minutes here
[1:11:51] all right now not many smart men are
[1:11:54] called
[1:11:56] and the examples that came to my mind
[1:11:58] was moses was a smart man that was
[1:11:59] called
[1:12:00] but then he had to get it all beaten out
[1:12:02] of him by a bunch of sheep
[1:12:04] and an argumentative wife now he was
[1:12:06] argumentative
[1:12:08] remember he became meeker as it went on
[1:12:10] he wasn't always meek
[1:12:12] and his wife wasn't always saving his
[1:12:14] life like she did save his life with the
[1:12:16] circumcision with gershom but she wasn't
[1:12:18] always that sweet
[1:12:21] but a lot of arguments on the back side
[1:12:23] of the desert
[1:12:24] [Laughter]
[1:12:25] he left all the pleasures of egypt
[1:12:30] he was so smart but god had to beat it
[1:12:33] out of him
[1:12:34] trial after trial argument after
[1:12:37] argument
[1:12:38] until finally he could get to the place
[1:12:40] where he looks since he's a burning bush
[1:12:41] that's not consumed
[1:12:42] i'm gonna go check that out
[1:12:46] and then brother brahm said he learned
[1:12:47] more about god in five minutes of that
[1:12:49] fire
[1:12:50] than all that he heard the rest of his
[1:12:52] life amen
[1:12:53] i hear you five minutes is greater than
[1:12:55] 80 years amen
[1:12:56] once you stand in the presence of jesus
[1:12:59] christ the king of glory amen
[1:13:02] hallelujah shows you how wise you are
[1:13:04] the man said he
[1:13:05] he you know in his human thinking of
[1:13:07] egypt he said i'm going to go take some
[1:13:09] of those branches and
[1:13:10] i'm going to go test him in the
[1:13:11] laboratory in egypt
[1:13:13] that's why that's what his human mind
[1:13:15] would have thought but god had to beat
[1:13:17] them out of there
[1:13:18] so he'd go and look upon it and then
[1:13:20] when it spoke to him he didn't run away
[1:13:22] he spoke back to it and took
[1:13:25] instructions
[1:13:26] he took off his shoes and said this is
[1:13:28] holy ground
[1:13:30] yeah there's a few of that are wise in
[1:13:31] this world but god has to humble them
[1:13:34] god has to make them fall on their face
[1:13:36] in order to look up to heaven
[1:13:39] and like paul he said i just wasn't i
[1:13:40] just wasn't in
[1:13:42] i just wasn't in the denomination he
[1:13:44] said i was the presbyter of presbyters
[1:13:48] i was the pharisee of pharisees you
[1:13:50] could say like this
[1:13:51] he was president of the baptist council
[1:13:53] right or the what do they call it the
[1:13:55] baptist convention what do they call it
[1:13:57] yeah the southern southern baptist
[1:13:59] convinced a popular convention you know
[1:14:01] for evangelicals he wasn't just in the
[1:14:03] convention brother bang he was the
[1:14:05] president of it praise god
[1:14:07] amen and god knocked him off his literal
[1:14:10] praise god
[1:14:12] in order to humble him and blinded his
[1:14:15] eye
[1:14:15] took away all of it and then later on he
[1:14:17] had to keep losing his eyesight right
[1:14:19] off and on again you get the victory for
[1:14:21] a while then they would lose it victory
[1:14:23] again
[1:14:24] loses sight wow what a trial what a
[1:14:27] trial
[1:14:29] paul why can't you just get the victory
[1:14:30] how come jesus don't heal you
[1:14:33] well it's to keep me humble praise god
[1:14:36] could we accept that lord you don't heal
[1:14:38] me all the way
[1:14:40] keep me humble i wonder if we could
[1:14:42] accept that
[1:14:44] you sure you love jesus paul yes i asked
[1:14:47] him three times
[1:14:49] that's how i know praise god i've been
[1:14:50] praying over and over about it
[1:14:52] and he finally told me he said take my
[1:14:55] grace it'll be sufficient when your
[1:14:57] eyesight
[1:14:58] is loot when you're losing your eyesight
[1:14:59] in other words when you can't read those
[1:15:01] scrolls
[1:15:02] when you can't depend upon your ability
[1:15:03] to study he said depend on me
[1:15:06] and that's why i said later he said i
[1:15:08] can do all things through christ
[1:15:10] who strengthens me praise god i can be
[1:15:13] strong in christ
[1:15:15] because it's christ giving me his
[1:15:16] strength amen amen
[1:15:20] not many wise men but there were a few
[1:15:24] that could forsake the cares of the
[1:15:27] world
[1:15:29] and receive the humble message of god
[1:15:32] thank god there's a couple like that
[1:15:34] i was looking online and before i come
[1:15:37] out i was like
[1:15:38] i just typed in uh christians famous
[1:15:40] christians who converted to christianity
[1:15:42] and they put some up there i'm like well
[1:15:45] they're really not christians
[1:15:49] oh catholics and all these things well i
[1:15:51] mean they could be saved right but
[1:15:52] these aren't holy ghost-filled
[1:15:53] christians like we're talking about
[1:15:57] people that go to they star in movies
[1:15:59] right where they lust and kill and
[1:16:01] sleep with other people oh yeah they're
[1:16:03] a christian no they're not
[1:16:06] if so they're totally backslidden
[1:16:07] they're just they may they may they
[1:16:09] might scrape into heaven they might just
[1:16:10] barely
[1:16:11] get into heaven but there'll be no
[1:16:12] reward the bible says only rewarded with
[1:16:14] eternal life
[1:16:16] based upon repentance
[1:16:19] so i try to look at for a recent and
[1:16:20] it's hard to know anybody recent because
[1:16:23] most people are very sincere right
[1:16:27] but i want to just bring up a few uh i
[1:16:29] remember the children will remember this
[1:16:31] this is
[1:16:31] a slideshow i did a few years ago many
[1:16:33] scientists believed in god so some of
[1:16:35] the wisest and respected people of all
[1:16:37] time
[1:16:37] now the bible said not many but there's
[1:16:39] a few
[1:16:41] there's a few smart people remember this
[1:16:43] galileo he was the
[1:16:45] mathematics is the alphabet which god
[1:16:47] has written the universe father of
[1:16:48] astronomy so the man who had all these
[1:16:52] revelations about astronomy
[1:16:53] he was a believer praise god he believed
[1:16:56] in god
[1:16:57] so look at this there's people that can
[1:16:59] be smart
[1:17:00] but yet be humble at the same time god
[1:17:02] help us just to be humble praise god
[1:17:04] most of us aren't doctors right most of
[1:17:08] us aren't
[1:17:09] rocket scientists unless you got a new
[1:17:11] job at nasa lately and
[1:17:12] you didn't tell me right but you might
[1:17:15] have
[1:17:19] but these we would say were the rocket
[1:17:21] scientists of their day can i say like
[1:17:23] that
[1:17:25] there's some not many there's some
[1:17:28] that could accept the humble gospel of
[1:17:30] christ kepler was the father of
[1:17:33] planetary motion he said thank thee my
[1:17:36] creator look at that he realized he was
[1:17:37] cr
[1:17:38] he had a creator and lord that thou has
[1:17:40] given me this joy thy creation this
[1:17:42] thrill
[1:17:42] in the works of thy hand amen
[1:17:46] i've made known thy glory to men as far
[1:17:48] as my limited spirit
[1:17:49] can grasp thy divinity praise god oh let
[1:17:52] it be our testimony
[1:17:54] that we show somebody god's glory even
[1:17:58] if it's just like it's testifying about
[1:17:59] your dad brother that can be your
[1:18:01] your your your uh lot in life to share
[1:18:04] god's glory
[1:18:05] you too sister sorry i i always forget i
[1:18:07] got to do both you know
[1:18:09] that's you that's your life you can for
[1:18:12] the rest of your days brother bang your
[1:18:13] sister who
[1:18:14] you can say that he was at the at the
[1:18:16] very edge of death
[1:18:18] and we prayed and we anointed the cloth
[1:18:20] and we prayed
[1:18:22] and we believed amen and god raised him
[1:18:24] back a hundred percent praise god
[1:18:27] i wonder if he's better now than he was
[1:18:28] though before he had that stroke
[1:18:30] i wonder if he's sharper or works harder
[1:18:32] i wonder i don't know you'd have to we
[1:18:33] have to talk about afterwards
[1:18:35] he might have got better health
[1:18:37] afterwards who knows
[1:18:40] but see he saw it oh oh i'm working with
[1:18:43] planets i'm a scientist
[1:18:44] i see my role as a doctor or a scientist
[1:18:47] rather
[1:18:47] to make god's glory known
[1:18:50] so that's what we see i'm a teacher to
[1:18:53] make god's glory known praise god
[1:18:58] we're workers in the factory right
[1:18:59] wherever we are we're there to make
[1:19:01] god's glory known
[1:19:04] just got to tell people about god's
[1:19:06] glory
[1:19:08] may god anoint you and god anoint me to
[1:19:10] tell somebody about god's glory
[1:19:12] tomorrow praise god that's what we're
[1:19:14] here for
[1:19:16] isaac newton he's probably one of the
[1:19:18] most famous uh
[1:19:20] father of modern physics explains the
[1:19:22] motions of the planets but it cannot
[1:19:23] explain who set the planets in motion
[1:19:25] god governs all things and knows that
[1:19:27] this
[1:19:28] is or can be done
[1:19:31] he's the one i think that talked about
[1:19:33] gravity right
[1:19:34] isaac newton i could be wrong on that
[1:19:36] one my wife's not in so hopefully i can
[1:19:38] hopefully i'm right
[1:19:41] uh okay so yeah i went further on these
[1:19:42] guys um
[1:19:44] i'm gonna skip past that uh aristotle
[1:19:45] yeah that's right
[1:19:48] he believed in god legendary scientist
[1:19:51] they still study his teachings i read
[1:19:52] well i shouldn't say read the whole
[1:19:53] thing i heard a little bit of the book
[1:19:55] of aristotle in college
[1:19:57] humanities i don't know if you did him
[1:19:58] yet did you did you guys do humanities
[1:20:00] uh i didn't like reading all those books
[1:20:02] too much
[1:20:05] but uh he said the reason god gave
[1:20:08] man intelligence was to understand
[1:20:09] himself in the universe
[1:20:12] newton uh he studied
[1:20:16] uh light uh gravitation calculus
[1:20:19] i never studied calculus so he's way
[1:20:21] smarter than i'll ever be oh yeah they
[1:20:23] spent the last years of his life church
[1:20:25] remember that that's right i forgot
[1:20:27] about that so he god helped him discover
[1:20:29] gravity but then he spent the last years
[1:20:32] studying the prophecies and he wrote all
[1:20:34] these commentaries and that encouraged
[1:20:36] me because i'm kind of like writing a
[1:20:37] commentary right now
[1:20:38] of brother branham's taking me through
[1:20:39] about two and a half years here
[1:20:41] about brother bran's mysteries and i
[1:20:42] feel like when is this thing going to
[1:20:44] end
[1:20:44] but i'm encouraged after reading this
[1:20:46] because after he studied all these
[1:20:47] science things he's like i want to give
[1:20:49] the last years of my life to writing
[1:20:50] about god amen
[1:20:52] i want to understand god's word i want
[1:20:55] to be able to share with others
[1:20:57] the revelations that god has given me
[1:20:59] praise god
[1:21:00] that's encouraging to me praise god he
[1:21:02] need a haircut though he probably need a
[1:21:03] haircut
[1:21:05] right now this guy i don't know if you
[1:21:07] remember this guy
[1:21:08] he was a famous uh atheist philosopher
[1:21:12] for years
[1:21:13] he fought god almost his whole life and
[1:21:15] then six years before he died his
[1:21:17] heart changed and he publicly stated he
[1:21:19] believed in god due to the complexity of
[1:21:21] human dna
[1:21:22] in 2006 he joined other scientists who
[1:21:24] urged tony blair to introduce
[1:21:26] intelligent design
[1:21:28] i like what the bible said not many not
[1:21:30] many that are wise
[1:21:31] after the flesh are called but there are
[1:21:34] some praise god
[1:21:36] just want to encourage you right god
[1:21:38] saves whoever wants to be saved praise
[1:21:41] god
[1:21:41] and and that's i love it the more you
[1:21:43] study god the more you get the details
[1:21:45] the more you see that god is interested
[1:21:47] in every detail
[1:21:48] and not just a dna i'm talking about the
[1:21:51] details of our lives amen
[1:21:53] the reason you're here tonight right
[1:21:54] there's got to be a reason
[1:21:56] every detail god's handiwork is in every
[1:22:00] detail of our lives amen
[1:22:02] hallelujah he's in the details of dna
[1:22:06] the very tiniest some of the tiniest
[1:22:08] living things right atoms and molecules
[1:22:10] electrons if he's in those very details
[1:22:14] he's got to be in the details of our
[1:22:16] lives
[1:22:18] and that should make us what content
[1:22:20] that should make us happy
[1:22:22] that should give us peace that god is
[1:22:24] with us
[1:22:26] now this is what i mentioned earlier so
[1:22:28] there's bill dao there's the man brother
[1:22:30] branham baptized when he was 90 years
[1:22:32] old
[1:22:33] 90. he didn't believe the message until
[1:22:36] he was 90. so don't give up church don't
[1:22:38] give up you got older parents my mom and
[1:22:40] dad are 70.
[1:22:42] oh man may god grant it i hope god does
[1:22:44] grant it

[1:22:49] until he's 90 years old brother and
[1:22:51] baptized him numerous times he almost
[1:22:53] died brother
[1:22:53] you know the stories with the third pole
[1:22:56] uh he was dying remember they had him in
[1:22:59] a tent he was dying and brother graham
[1:23:00] said thus saith the lord
[1:23:01] you're not gonna die you're gonna live
[1:23:03] he said and i'll shake your hand on the
[1:23:05] street praise god remember that one
[1:23:07] listen i look away to jesus 1963 it's in

[1:25:43] base things of the world the things
[1:25:44] which are despised
[1:25:46] hath god chosen yea the things which are
[1:25:49] not
[1:25:50] to bring to naught things that are god
[1:25:53] uses things that don't seem like nothing
[1:25:55] and he brings him to light and makes
[1:25:56] them happen praise god
[1:25:59] that no flesh should glory in his
[1:26:01] presence
[1:26:03] like i said on wednesday i don't know if
[1:26:04] i'd you you guys heard it on wednesday
[1:26:06] but
[1:26:06] there's a there's a preacher he's not in
[1:26:09] the message
[1:26:10] but he went through all of 2020 and
[1:26:12] brought all the false prophecies of all
[1:26:14] the
[1:26:15] of all the charismatic preachers and
[1:26:17] showed how they all missed it i believe
[1:26:18] god might have raised up biden
[1:26:20] just to show all these christians that
[1:26:22] these are false preachers
[1:26:25] so when 2020 came you know every year
[1:26:27] they make a prediction oh
[1:26:28] 2020 is going to be prosperous and all
[1:26:30] it's going to be great and
[1:26:31] great revivals they said the stadiums
[1:26:33] are going to be full that's what the
[1:26:34] lord shows me
[1:26:36] and then three months later the stadiums
[1:26:38] are empty
[1:26:39] and they're still empty right
[1:26:44] and then when coveted came all those
[1:26:46] guys they cursed covered in the name of
[1:26:48] the lord
[1:26:49] saying it's got to go now and the
[1:26:50] vaccine's going to be here immediately
[1:26:52] and they missed that too and then came
[1:26:55] the election brother
[1:26:56] everybody amen and they all said 100
[1:26:58] trump was going to be in office for two
[1:27:00] consecutive terms
[1:27:01] and god made him miss
[1:27:05] because they're pretending to speak for
[1:27:06] god when they're not
[1:27:08] speaking for god right
[1:27:11] it's amazing i just watched i listened
[1:27:13] to the video yesterday when i was
[1:27:13] washing dishes
[1:27:14] he just put it all together in one thing
[1:27:16] i wanted to show it to you guys but i
[1:27:17] just didn't have time today to prepare
[1:27:19] so why does he do this that no flesh
[1:27:22] will glory
[1:27:22] in his presence
[1:27:27] he choses the weak despised oh that
[1:27:30] makes me happy praise god
[1:27:32] that means me weak despise things of the
[1:27:34] world
[1:27:35] to bring the knot things that are
[1:27:44] i was going to say something there but i
[1:27:45] better not because i don't got people
[1:27:46] listening here
[1:27:47] maybe i'll say it after we stop the
[1:27:48] livestream he said we hobby we speak the
[1:27:51] wisdom among them that are perfect
[1:27:52] yet not the wisdom of this world nor are
[1:27:54] the princes of this world
[1:27:56] that come to naught but we speak the
[1:27:58] wisdom of god in a mystery
[1:27:59] even the hidden wisdom which god
[1:28:01] ordained before the world
[1:28:02] unto our glory like just let me give an
[1:28:05] example wednesday night remember we're
[1:28:06] preaching on husbands and wives
[1:28:09] i'm preaching the mysteries of god
[1:28:11] brother vayne that a man needs to love
[1:28:13] his wife and
[1:28:14] sacrifice i'm preaching the mysteries of
[1:28:16] god
[1:28:17] that these worldly people can't fix they
[1:28:19] can't figure it out
[1:28:20] like these wise people they're never
[1:28:22] going to really love their wives like
[1:28:24] christ love the church
[1:28:25] but i can preach it here and i've got
[1:28:27] the holy spirit here
[1:28:28] and i got the wisdom of the holy spirit
[1:28:30] and we're speaking mysteries here
[1:28:32] and it seems so simple to us but to them
[1:28:34] i can never do that
[1:28:35] you've got to treat your wife like that
[1:28:37] oh brother jesse you don't have to do
[1:28:38] that for your wife
[1:28:39] oh no you do because that's the mystery
[1:28:41] of the revelation amen
[1:28:43] praise god all those women they don't
[1:28:45] you don't have to listen to your husband
[1:28:47] and these things
[1:28:48] but the bible says she says submit in
[1:28:51] all things right all things that are
[1:28:52] godly
[1:28:54] but do you think those why smart
[1:28:55] billionaire billionaires will say that
[1:28:57] no in fact those women will divorce
[1:28:58] their billionaire husbands on purpose
[1:29:00] just to get half their money
[1:29:02] and go find another one they did it i
[1:29:04] use
[1:29:05] i'm not gonna name names but they do it
[1:29:11] but see we speak here in mystery and
[1:29:14] it's so simple to us we understand it
[1:29:16] but to them they don't understand it
[1:29:18] they just can you they just
[1:29:19] they scratch their heads brother man the
[1:29:22] name of the fathers and holy ghost is
[1:29:23] father and only ghost that's a name
[1:29:25] that's not a name that's a title like
[1:29:28] that
[1:29:28] they can't get it they can't get it that
[1:29:30] all those are titles
[1:29:32] to one name the lord jesus christ they
[1:29:35] can't get it of course we know this
[1:29:38] none of the princes of this world knew
[1:29:40] for they had they known it they would
[1:29:41] not have crucified the lord of glory
[1:29:44] even the mystery of the resurrection the
[1:29:46] death and resurrection of jesus christ
[1:29:48] they missed that now of course almost
[1:29:50] everybody missed that right
[1:29:52] but i just want to say that church when
[1:29:54] we preach on the mystery the rapture
[1:29:55] there's 12 mysteries right
[1:29:57] we preach on the map the rapture the
[1:29:58] mystery of his will the
[1:30:00] even mother harlot they can't they can't
[1:30:02] understand it
[1:30:04] because they're too smart for it they
[1:30:06] can't humble themselves
[1:30:08] enough down to receive it and accept the
[1:30:10] truth
[1:30:12] but you who are weak
[1:30:16] in their eyes but you who are despised
[1:30:20] in their eyes but not god's eyes
[1:30:23] you receive it and it becomes the wisdom
[1:30:25] of god unto you
[1:30:27] and you and i speak it as the mystery of
[1:30:30] god amongst one another
[1:30:32] how privileged are we church how
[1:30:34] privileged are we
[1:30:35] that we get to speak the mysteries of
[1:30:37] god it's the greatest privilege of my
[1:30:39] life
[1:30:40] to speak the mysteries of god in wisdom
[1:30:45] now i'm going to close here that was my
[1:30:48] last slide so i'm just going to detach
[1:30:50] here because i have just a few notes i
[1:30:51] don't have these organized so i don't
[1:30:52] want you to see them they're not really
[1:30:55] organized
[1:30:57] he said all the saints salute you
[1:30:59] chiefly they that are of caesar's
[1:31:00] household
[1:31:01] the grace of our lord jesus christ
[1:31:04] be with you all amen
[1:31:07] amen what does he end with
[1:31:10] grace what are the highlights of this
[1:31:13] book just remember the summary i'm just
[1:31:14] going to quickly go with this real quick
[1:31:18] finally i'm going to go through this
[1:31:19] finally
[1:31:22] finally so remember paul's prayer from
[1:31:26] the beginning he prays for he said i'm
[1:31:28] always thankful for you i'm confident
[1:31:29] for you
[1:31:30] and then he talks about his imprisonment
[1:31:32] how his imprisonment spread the gospel
[1:31:35] and he won souls because he went to
[1:31:37] prison praise god
[1:31:39] church whatever situation we go through
[1:31:41] we can trust god
[1:31:42] he's going to do his his will and his
[1:31:44] glory he's going to use us
[1:31:46] praise god to win souls that's what i'm
[1:31:49] living for praise god
[1:31:51] then he says follow my example remember
[1:31:54] this is the book of the mind
[1:31:56] you mentioned in the mind how many times
[1:31:57] remember ten times
[1:32:00] unity of mind think the same thing think
[1:32:03] on these things things that are holy
[1:32:05] things that are pure think on these
[1:32:07] things in chapter two he gives jesus
[1:32:09] is the example servant how can we come
[1:32:12] to unity
[1:32:13] how can we serve each other by esteeming
[1:32:15] ourself
[1:32:16] lower than others by humbling ourselves
[1:32:19] as jesus humbled himself to the cross
[1:32:22] then he talks about timothy and
[1:32:24] epiphanitis how they humble themselves
[1:32:26] they were servants
[1:32:27] to paul they were certain can you
[1:32:29] imagine being a servant to a prisoner
[1:32:32] think about that anybody had any family
[1:32:36] member in jail
[1:32:37] you really become their servant right if
[1:32:40] you're helping them out
[1:32:41] that's what timothy and ephraphaditis
[1:32:44] became
[1:32:44] they became servants to the prisoner
[1:32:48] and paul says these are examples of
[1:32:50] christian character
[1:32:52] let's not see how great we can be let's
[1:32:54] see how humble we can be
[1:32:56] praise the lord in chapter three he goes
[1:33:00] through those examples
[1:33:02] he uses his example and has some of the
[1:33:03] most beautiful
[1:33:05] verses in the scripture
[1:33:08] are in this book for me to live as
[1:33:11] christ
[1:33:11] to die is my gain amen
[1:33:17] in chapter four he ends with some of the
[1:33:19] most beautiful words i can do all things
[1:33:22] through christ
[1:33:23] who strengthens me and my god shall
[1:33:25] supply
[1:33:26] all your need according to his riches in
[1:33:28] glory by christ jesus
[1:33:30] and he leaves us with the grace of our
[1:33:33] lord jesus christ let's stand i better
[1:33:34] stop right there by god's grace

[1:34:16] a tremendous message
[1:34:20] but here we are church we're despised by
[1:34:24] the world
[1:34:25] but yet we're accepted by god
[1:34:28] we're not the smartest of the world but
[1:34:30] yet we speak the wisdom of god in
[1:34:32] mystery

[1:34:47] and adopted me into his family we were
[1:34:50] all orphans right
