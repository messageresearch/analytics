[Music] yeah I tried forever [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] thank you [Music] let's take our Bibles here tonight by God's grace holiday it's good to be in the house of the Lord it's good to be with you again I'm sure they missed you on Sunday and I got to listen to Simon's message it's a beautiful message the lord gave you on Sunday that was a real blessing I told him what a blessing that was to me thank God for individual Revelation praise God thank the Lord God for that Hallelujah truly blessed by that if you wanted to go to proverbs 2 verse 8. you know when Simon preached the last time I wrote down three scriptures afterwards I'd just like to take a general thought tonight I'm not really going to teach on any Doctrine we'd say just like some a general principle that God preserves the way of his Saints I'm just going to preach a general message on that just an encouraging hopefully it's an encouraging message praise God I plan to come here and encourage all the saints tonight by God's grace and uh I guess I was encouraging over the weekend with that event my wife put on I'm going to share just a couple of testimonies on there just how it helped me and uh just gave me a just a fresh perspective on God's grace that God is keeping us in the way God is faithful to us and God is doing his perfect will praise God in our lives and we're very thankful for that Hallelujah he preserveth the way of his Saints now the word preserve means to watch it means to guard from loss or injury so God is watching your way to make sure you're not you don't lose and you're not injured he's got also means he's your Fortress this implies you have a fortress around you Hallelujah also means you're in his custody Hallelujah right Naomi's girls are in her custody tonight sure my children and or my wife and my custody praise God they're in our care you're in the care of the Lord Jesus Christ be preserved with him you're in his custody praise God amen let's read this one well let's all read it together here by God's grace ready one two three he keepeth the pass of judgment and preserve it the way of his Saints amen let's have one more word of prayer when you're on your heart let's make anointing to God father God we thank you God for this Crimson River Lord God we thank you for the blood of Christ Lord God I am not the same I am changed o God Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb Lord each person I believe has that testimony here tonight you've changed their hearts and lives whether they're raising the message or not Lord they know there's been a change Lord God because of their love for you something's been quickened something's been made alive something's been a personal revelation to them Lord as we heard on Sunday the individual Revelation so we thank you God for Lord just revealing yourself to us individually God anoint us here God anoint me that I could be a a minister I can serve the people your word I can feed them sheep food Lord God I can feed them the words of eternal life and I pray someone will be encouraged here tonight and strengthened father God Lord of all the things you could have chose to preach you chose you chose man you chose fallible men father Lord it was your plan Lord you designed it so father God we just want to go along with your plan Lord God and enter into the anointing of the Holy Ghost Lord God we know that all things are possible even here tonight Lord God we just want to be led by your Holy Spirit father of God hallelujah to the world it's foolishness Lord but to you Lord God you're pleased with it Lord God so we thank you God and we know the things of the world are foolishness to you Lord God so we thank you God that we can be in your perfect will tonight Lord God in the house of the Lord and Lord that you're preserving us you're guarding us Lord you're watching us so we want to say thank you for that and Lord bless his service in Jesus Christ's name the saint said amen God bless you you're being seated praise God I really don't know how long this will be you know I was thinking it might not be too long but you never know um so yeah again I sound like everybody had a good time in the Lord and my wife said the kids really enjoyed the Sunday School on Sunday night too so I was very happy about that and hopefully they're being really really trained up well and think about that sister how much they know compared to us when we were raised in denomination think about that that's a pretty great blessing so I'm rejoicing and I thank the Lord for that I appreciate Simon being able to Humble himself like that and and teach the children praise God so they're just little sponges you know you just keep pouring water on them and they're going to soak up all the all the truth they can get by God's grace and you adults too right let's not put ourselves as these hard stones that you know we can't receive anything let's let's be sponges too by God's grace in fact that was part of the testimony on Sunday you know I preached I just preached a second part in their little basement down there I preach the second part on the finished mystery of God and afterwards the brother the leader he's 59 and he was crying and he just said he said brother Jesse at 59 years old I feel like I've lost so much time he said but at the same time he said I'm seeing things I've never seen before and the Bible makes sense it's been a reality he's like I love I drew pictures about the three parts of man and the timeline from the Rapture to the Future home they have a big chalkboard up there I took the chalk and I got a picture of it if you want to see it uh and he was just crying he's like to think he said everyone I know in the Amish community he said they can't get out of their old ways but to think God chose me at 59 years old to see this he said and God gets to teach me fresh revelation oh church that's that's just it that's eternal life praise God that's it's just so so special and so thankful for God's grace I really appreciate awesome going down there with me that was a real blessing brother and got the fellowship and it's better than being alone praise God so I really I really appreciate that we're thankful for him by God's grace so uh yeah wonderful weekend there and like I said last night 17 we're baptized I guess I'll just share a few testimonies here briefly that kind of just may want to preach this tonight you know regarding this Amish group remember this is a half of the church that came out of the Amish community so there was an entire Amish church and just so there's thunderstorms tonight so you could lose the power if that happens I'll just turn on my flashlight and still see the preacher up here I won't do any scary faces kids I never well I guess I get to I get emotional sometimes so the faces probably can be intense sometimes they won't be that that scary but uh you know so what happened was an entire Amish Church left the Amish community and for them it's like you're cut off from your family money they never want to talk to you again so they come out but they're still under a leader who is legalistic and so like I told you uh the church prayed and they they anointed every chair in the basement with oil and they said the Holy Spirit move uh upon this this preacher who's still a legalist because they were just starting to read brother Ram's Supernatural books and and hear about water baptism and that that next day the preacher come in and he was all confused he's like I don't even know what's going on I can't even preach and they said the sermon didn't make any sense and then I come the next Sunday and just laid it out you know through the word of God and it all made sense and they you know they were rejoicing and um and so that's what's happened and then last night for the Austin and I uh there was another Amish group that came to support this Amish group and they drove six hours from Indiana when was the last time you or I drove six hours for a water baptismal ceremony and they were just in Alabama on Sunday so Sunday they drove from from Alabama back up to Indiana and then Tuesday they drove from Indiana to Ohio and brother Austin could see some of them like were actually shouting and because right now the church that we're working with the 17 they're just they're not totally free yet because you know the Amish community with their legalists like you can't shout her you can't dance you're in the flesh if you do that and then you know and we feel bad if we get a little happy or something like that or dancing around you know it's a joy it's joy unspeakable full of Glory praise God we need more freedom of the Holy Spirit but I thank God for what we have I Feel Free by God's grace but that's how it is and so you know this Indiana group was kind of cheering them on or praising the Lord cheering them on and um it was just really beautiful to see well one of those gentlemen the oldest not the oldest but one of the oldest guys he came up to me he said brother Jesse he said thank you for doing these baptisms I said I don't do nothing do nothing he said but for 18 years I believe the message and he said I've been praying for 18 years for an Amish Church to receive the message and it hasn't happened until tonight church let me just encourage you I mean this really encouraged me don't give up don't give up on any promise of God 18 years 18 years and so that just blew me away like wow Lord our church has only been we're coming up on 17 in June we've only been here 17. and I thought it was interesting too I baptized more in that church than I think we even have at our church and it was just really special to see what God is doing there and it's you know I told him I said I want to come back I want to I want to keep them from evil spirits you know so I hope the Lord will help us do that but just be encouraged you know 18 years if he can if he can wait 18 years I can weigh 18 more by God's grace and you just got to trust the Lord you know we just have to trust the Lord and even this like I was telling Austin you know when I first got invited to go down there I was so tired you know I didn't really want to go down there I'm like oh they're not going to receive it and you know I was just tired and I guess I was just a little bit selfish or tired or pouty or whatever and then to see what you know you know and this brother kind of had to just keep calling me till I called him back because I was just I get you know I'm working I'm preaching I don't call people back right away all the time and I'm not perfect that guy I'm tired but anyways he kept calling me and then to see you know he only took two sermons and 17 people get baptized it just showed me like it doesn't really like God God is going to do what he wants to do and I just want to fit into his plan and it's it's like in other words this whole situation just showed me like God is sovereign God is going to do what he wants to do and when he wants to use your church he's going to come get you to use you I want to end with some quotes on that brother Ram says that God knows right where you are at I just want to encourage you that I say that in a good way God God's going to use you and he's going to come get you to do it all right think about David David's out there in the field God had to come get it hey come come on in here there's a prophet here to anoint you I mean God's going to find where you're at Moses tried to hide on the back of the Desert god came looking for him Hallelujah church if God wants when God God does want to use you and when God does use you he's going to come find you so don't ever fret don't ever feel like oh God you know he knows you're not watching me he don't care God knows exactly where you are God knows exactly I'd baptize more in one day than I have for how many years combined sister and brother well okay think of all the baptism we've done these last five or six years why baptized the more last night than the last five to ten years combined just amazing because God does what he wants and has taught me just on a greater way just to respect God even more just respect God respective his timing and when he wants to use you he's going to come find you all right so I just want to start with that and then also I think Naomi heard the story you know on Saturday at that event uh seeking Whole Health the keynote speaker was a young man he must have been 30 or 40. I don't know 40 year old men are young men let me tell you that they're young and strong they got a lot of life left uh I don't remember how old he was but anyways the whole I'll just summarize it you know he was out and he was out in California and he was a a military police officer and his health just deteriorated so he was like a hundred pounds he was almost as tall as me I don't know we've got two kids one on the way maybe I'll say he's 30. I'll say he's 30. you know and he tried everything he was on so many medications and none of them helped him so the last thing he tried was going to an organic lifestyle and he also separated from Wi-Fi he separated from everything and he finally started seeing Improvement when he went to the organic lifestyle I'm not even talking about organic in the store I'm talking about straight from the ground organic I'm talking no labels right because they could lie on those labels I talked about that a few weeks ago they can lie on their labels right and that's when he recovered a lot of his health now he still has good days and bad days um but he would he's so sensitive to all these chemicals that he had to build his own house out of Timber and then his insulation is sheep wool so not not insulation like we get because there's all these chemicals in it and everything in his house is natural like it's not a mattress because if you buy a mattress it's got chemicals All In he can't have that he has to pack his food even if he goes to a wedding he won't even eat food at a wedding he'll pack his own food he can't even wash his hands with soap because all the chemicals in the soap so he has to make his own soup I wonder if he I wonder if he shakes people's hands I actually wasn't watching him but anyways um and now the whole point of this is that he moved from California to Ohio to build this house and he suffer he has suffered beyond measure physically suffered wanted he prayed to die like I said last week with Elijah Elijah put a prayer request in God can I die that's my Saints can you pray for me that I'll die uh that's a that's his private class well this young man wanted to die too he found no hope in life but God restored his strength and then now he's got his house built there and he's only got electricity in one room imagine that electricity in one room the kitchen and running water in one room the kitchen now I went out to the Amish I went to an Amish guy's house and I went in the bathroom and they had no running water in the bathroom and no heat in the bathroom that was on Sunday that was and it smelled too there was no Plumbing so that was it reminded me of Guyana being out there on the campgrounds where there's no Plumbing out in the campgrounds anyways that's how they live you know so anyways fast forward now he's got this house and everything he's finally starting to be encouraged and then a tornado comes through and it knocks down his entire uh Woods now he wanted to get away from people so he built his house in the woods and my wife can correct me later if I'm wrong on this yeah there's already some mistakes that's how all my stories go the only thing you can trust when I preach is the the actual the Bible that I quote and or if a quote if I read it off the screen if not you can't trust it fully so that's why the Bible says prove all things but I try to understand you know the best I can I get the gist of the story hopefully but anyways a tornado knocked down his Woods or par part of his Woods and he was frustrated with that can you imagine you know wow I just got this I finally got my help back and now this well then one night he's awake right he looks across the the woods where it was knocked down and someone's house is on fire the neighbor's house is on fire so he has his health back enough where he can run over there and knock on the doors and scream he said it's kind of like you brother but but more advanced and wakes them up and uh it's a couple and three kids the roof's on fire they get them out of the house and just a few minutes later when the the fire department gets there the house is burned down to the ground and I just took that as just you know he used it to show how God was in control of every part of his life no church he don't even believe the message right which I hope I believe he's a Christian if God's in control of that much of his life how much more is he in control of Our Lives as well right think about awesome you know going out to Arizona it was all ordained to God I mean all these steps all of our actions and I'll say this all of our difficulties are all ordained of God it's to make us more like Christ praise God to trust him more to develop the character of Christ and who would have thought you know if if it would have been up to him he would have said I don't want any pain I'll just be a military police officer right but he had to suffer suffer suffer and then finally get into a good spot and then suffer some more natural disaster like you would like if a tornado hit by my house I'd think Lord are you mad at me right at me lord well and then God uses him to save lives so that's again like just like the point I'm making like I just feel like my life God is ordering my life God's ordering that man's life God is ordering your life as well and we are to trust the Lord okay so I just thought I'd share those two things you know 18 years waiting for the people to come out God answered you know moving across the the country natural disasters God is in control of everything you know God calling the littlest I think I'm the littlest message preacher in all of Ohio to baptize 17 people he could I mean he could have had anybody do it me God is in control of everything praise God so we just want to give God the glory so let's look at this for a thought for a few moments here like I said I don't know how long I'll preach you that usually goes longer than I think but maybe be shorter this time we'll see so we looked at the scripture of Proverbs 2 verse 8 God gives or God preserves the way of his Saints and again this means to to watch God watches the way of his Saints aren't you glad God's watching you tonight Hallelujah the Bible said he doesn't slumber nor sleep God doesn't go to sleep and say oh I'll let I'll let Jesse figure it out on his own today I'm just going to take a little nap now he doesn't do that he is he has his holy spirit so great it can watch over all of his Saints of course we know he dispatches Angels do that too but God is watching all of our ways amen you know I was I thought of that how God preserves the way of a Saints like we said with Moses god preserved him even as a murderer God still watched over him for 40 years we'd say I'm sure there was good I'm sure there was good years with Sephora you know but there were some rough years of arguing you know there's High tempers and like brothers says high temperatures in wilderness um but God preserves him you know 40 years and 40 years later God brings him to the ministry that he always thought he was called for what an encouragement to us that we just got to trust in God like I've said that many times you know God didn't call Abraham until he's 75. God didn't call Moses till he was 80. and sometimes we get impatient God when are you going to use me or God when is something going to happen just be patient praise God just be patient God is preserving your way your path God is preserving you on the path he's keeping you on the path praise God you know he said like David David was preserved you know he was preserved from his brothers over there where he had such a as we saw with that play he had such a fellowship with God he learned to worship God by himself within the Sheep Hallelujah God preserved him out there as a worshiper so that when he comes to the battle with Goliath nobody can talk him out of it because he's already had a genuine experience with God God preserved him from the Lion God preserved him from a bear now God's preserved you from what God is what does God preserve you from praise God maybe bitterness broken heart you know broken home broken family what does God preserve you from death what does God preserve you from now let me share this one too one of the Amish families two weeks ago their daughters five and she got her hand caught in a meat grinder and all she has left is a pinky I shook her and I said what's wrong did you break your hand sister your finger she said no I got it caught in the meat writer just has one pinky left and the parents are like God can God can restore her hands and finger back oh that's right I talked to the dad I said I'm so sorry sir he said he said well you know we were sad too but then that same day with that Indiana that Indiana Family the Indiana Amish group three of their teenagers were in a were hit they were in a car accident two of them died that same exact day so he said we were we were so heartbroken but at the same time we thank God she's still alive I thought think of how merciful god is you know the three of them are they're in the buggy or the horse and buggy and the car hits them two of them two teenagers they're gone never seen them again to get to heaven and that God allowed that to encourage his family at least she's alive and I guess you know within those two weeks she's got her cast on there and she's still she likes to bake cakes so she she baked up this cake iced it and I guess her mom shared the text with everybody and nothing's gonna slow this little girl down you know just this is life just these are these are these are battles these are struggles we go through but God is preserving his people so David they're preserved from a lion preserved from a bear how many car accidents have we been preserved from right how many uh how many awful financial decisions have we been preserved from yeah right you think about just God's protection over our lives Daniel was preserved right even as a young child you know he and even as a young teenager we'd say he was preserved from defiling himself like he just wanted to be clean in God's eyes and so God preserved him and God gave him wisdom to say let's do a test I'll just eat the pulse I'll just eat vegetarian uh and then compare me after was it 10 days or seven days compare me with these other uh Babylonian teenagers and scientists and let's see who looks better and God preserve him see church if if you want to live right God's going to help you live right if you want God to preserve you and protect you from sin God will do it like I was telling with Austin you know last night I was telling him I said I said brother I don't even know how many times I have prayed and said God protect my children I've just said God preserve him I plead with you I beg you protect them protect their bodies protect their minds we've had a lot of I should say a lot but we've had numerous emergency room trips these last few years but God has been gracious to us God has been gracious but that's my constant prayer I'm praying that God would preserve them and that's what I believe God I believe God likes that praise God that's what job did he constantly gave sacrifice for his children constantly that's what we can do as Christians we can say Lord preserve my steps preserve me praise God hallelujah and so God preserved him as a Young Man wanting to be pure and undefiled and then God preserved her as he got older God preserved him in the Lion's Den God was very gracious to Daniel praise God because Daniel stood for him Hallelujah and it's not legalism church but just remember he prayed three times a day you know he got on his knees three times a day and asked God for his grace ask God for his Mercy and that's that's a testimony how many want to have a testimony like that praise God that's it I mean this is a man who trusted in the Lord and then we can see well God's rewarder of those who diligently seek him God didn't have to preserve him but God in his grace preserved him because he was one who diligently sought the Lord and you know church with that we could go down through every person in the Bible how God preserved their life and even back to Moses god preserved him when he was in a a basket in the Nile River from all those alligators and your crocodiles glory amen God knows how to preserve his people praise God and God has preserved you God has preserved me I want to read this let's go to First Samuel 2 verse 1 this is of course Hannah's Prayer after God gave her a son Samuel a prophet on top of all that the branch that's an extra blessing first Samuel 2 1. this is her prayer or I'm sorry her song of worship yeah this is her song of rejoicing yeah it's a prayer of rejoicing yeah there you go praise God first Samuel 2 verse one and Hannah prayed and said my heart rejoiceseth in the Lord and my horn is exalted in the Lord my mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation now was it easy for her to get to that spot no remember it was year after year coming up and all the women looking at her no child no child no child and then even her husband's other wife speaking bad about her but there's a purpose behind it praise God God was going to preserve her Hallelujah God was going to give her a testimony Hallelujah and God exalts enlarges her mouth another her testimony verse two there is none holy as the Lord there is none beside thee neither is there any Rock like our God so think about that you know her life was so unstable she didn't have the desire of her Hearts like she wanted to but after God answers her prayer now she feels like I'm standing on a rock isn't that awesome God you know he'll show you that he really is your rock really the whole time you've been standing on a rock praise God really the whole time but now you just recognize it now you recognize it but when God's eyes it was already in God's mind it was already finished before the foundation of the world but now she just recognize it God's my rock I'm standing on the rock of the Lord talk no more so exceedingly proudly let not arrogancy come out of your mouth for the Lord is a god of knowledge and by him actions are ways he's testing us uh like like with Hezekiah right sometimes God will be near to us and sometimes he'll draw his anointing back to see what we'll do in that opportunity he's testing us to see how we'll respond verse 4 the bows of the mighty men are broken I'm gonna try to get down to verse 10. and they that stumbled are girded with strength Hallelujah see Church don't be discouraged you stumble them a bit God's going to strengthen you praise God Hallelujah just because you stumble a little bit doesn't mean you're not going to finish doesn't mean you're not going to get your your stride back or your Victory back praise God he's going to uphold you even when you stumble he's going to help you get your feet back under you praise God amen verse five they that were full have hired out themselves for bread and they that were hungry see so that the baron hath born seven and she that hath many children is wax feeble the Lord killeth and maketh alive he bringeth down to the grave and bringeth up so here we see how God deals with with certain people sometimes he makes you poor sometimes he makes you rich sometimes he takes people down sometimes he raise the people up it's the Lord's doing verse 7 the Lord maketh poor and maketh Rich he bringeth low and lifteth up verse 8 he raise up the poor Out of the Dust and lifted up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes think of Joseph my in the prison in the pit right and to make them inherit the Throne of Glory for The Pillars of the Earth are the Lords and they have set the world upon them in other words never give up in other words don't lose hope praise God don't don't let yourself and myself let us not become hopeless let's have hope in God hallelujah because God can take us out of the most awful place and then exalt us to a place on high amen verse 9 he will keep here's where I want to go to verse 9. he will keep the feet of his Saints and the wicked shall be silent in darkness for by strength shall no man Prevail I like that he keeps the feet of your saint of the Saints he's going to make sure you don't fall on the path he's going to make sure you don't fall down and embarrass yourself speaking of runners or races all right thank God I don't think I ever did that all my recent I don't think I ever fell down by God's grace he kept my feet in all those natural races but he wants to do that in all of our spiritual races praise God that we don't stumble on the journey right now the Bible does say the righteous followeth seven times but the Lord raises them up praise God so even if we do have a stumble don't be discouraged raise up try again God will keep your feet next time praise God trust in the Lord amen Hallelujah verse 10 is where I want to end there the adversaries of the Lord shall be broken to pieces Out of Heaven shall he Thunder upon them the Lord shall judge the ends of the Earth and he shall give strength unto his King and exalt the Horn of his anointed praise God so we see here a humble destitute woman now and she has a mouth enlarged with praise to God church that's what I believe God is uh he accomplishes that in our lives God lets us go through difficult times so that when we get the victory when we get a testimony then we can truly understand God's grace we can truly Praise Him and we can have a great testimony praise God a great testimony I think of my my mother you know she got the overcoming uh victory over cancer I think she was 38 or 39. that was and that that has been her song God Has enlarged her testimony now first she's 72. right so 32 through 34 years that's been her testimony that God's A Healer that God answers prayer if you if you cry out for a miracle God will give you a miracle might not be the one you want but God will give you a miracle praise God she didn't even know say what kind of Miracle she just asked God for a miracle well I think it's beautiful that God raises up the poor and God has raised my mama from poor conditions Hallelujah she's able to give people vehicles and stuff like that right right who would have thought who would have thought of all of our relatives God is in control you know God anointed my mom to give Lydia Malachi a truck it didn't cost him anything now my mom would be the poorest of all of us and she's giving away trucks just God's mercy God's mercy uh now Psalm 66 let's go there Psalm 66. I just want to read a few scriptures try to encourage you tonight by God's grace I know I shared some you know truth I mean those are all true stories they're real serious stories but I just thought I felt led I'd just preach on those here tonight Psalm 66 okay I'm going the wrong way psalm 66. I want to get to verse 9. Hallelujah let's start at verse uh let's just start a verse say oh bless our God ye people and make the voice of his praise to be heard that's why I always want to have loud worship Services I know there's times for Whispering I know soft prayerful I like I like the most time to be let's be loud about it praise God because God has done so much for us should we come here after all God's done for us and be quiet to the Lord that all he's done like I was telling Austin I get emails almost every day from people from Kenya or Uganda we haven't had any food for three days and they're not fasting Church they're not trying to fast he said all we had is hot water now I tell them sometimes I said well I don't know I mean people could be lying to me just to get the money I don't know but then some of them send me pictures and so let's just be thankful in all God has done for us praise God let's remember to give thanks and God has done great things for us and God is in other words God has blessed us that we can be a blessing to other people praise God and I know I know you do and I know I do too there's 30 minutes wow verse 9 which holdeth our soul in life so that means among the living if you look in the Hebrew he holds our soul among the living in other words God is keeping you here tonight God's the reason we haven't at a funeral for brother Jessica or whoever God's the reason you're still here God's holding your life praise God think of all of our friends from high school or friends that we know that gone to the Grave God's holding here God's preserving your life Hallelujah just let God preserve that man to save somebody out of a burning fiery house God's preserved you for something praise God that's verse 9. I like verse 10. for thou oh God has proved us thou has tried us as silver has tried a lot of these tests we go through they're just they're just tests right there they're just trials God wants to see how we're going to react God's trying to train us up and make us a better servant to him praise God we want to we want to pass the test we want to give God glory in the good times and the hard times Glory now let's go to the Rapture scripture uh brother man uses this psalms 27 verse 1. Psalm 27 if you haven't listened that I told Emma about that I think she listened to it today or yesterday she had me she had a question about the rapture I told I gave her some sermons on that video teaching videos on that yeah this is the scripture belram uses for the Rapture because we'll get to it where God God will hide us the Rapture is a hiding place it's hiding the bride of Christ from the destruction upon the world the Godless sinful World God's going to hide us from that destruction praise God he's going to hide Us in him praise God verse one the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear is anybody afraid of anybody tonight you don't have to be you don't have to be I know we all we all go through our trials like I said spirits of fear come on honest sometimes at nighttime or daytime but really if God is our strength we don't have to be afraid the Lord is I like that the Lord is the strength of my life how am I going to be strong enough to make it God's going to be my strength he's my strength praise God of whom shall I be afraid so we don't have to be afraid tonight there's nothing to be afraid of because the Lord is on our side who shall lay any charge to God's elect Hallelujah if God be for us who could be against us praise the Lord trying to encourage the Saints tonight by God's grace verse two when the wicked even my enemies and my foes come upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and fell so David saw David saw his enemies come after them and as they come they fall down and they don't get to him talk about Amazing Grace right talk about Amazing Grace all this all the struggles look like they're going to come and I'll just say that's I mean that that's a lot of Our Testimony in America I mean it looks like people say all the doomsday in America right oh is this going to be the end is this going to be the end is 2020 going to be the end is Kobe going to be the end like all these doom day prophecies or all these doom day things when they come upon us they all stumbled and fell to this date stumbled and fell God has preserved us right kovid's going to get you or uh monkey pox is going to get you or whatever you know all these enemies we've got to trust in the Lord if the Lord is our strength the Lord is our song let's trust in him like you know and they know what they're doing like I was I was looking at news this week and there's a video on from Newsmax that said uh a deadly bacteria in America I'm like oh let me click on that where is that at and then it just turns out like it's this deadly bacteria that's only it's only contacted in uh in hospitals with really really sick people and the Anchor's like well whoo well that's good news that I don't have to worry about that I'm like yeah why was I worried about that but just the the headlines make you think oh there's a deadly bat now there's a deadly bacteria and we're affected by those things right but the Bible says God will cause the enemies to stumble before they get to you amen just like David and Goliath right before glad you get there the word of God stopped Goliath praise God though and host should Camp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident what that their enemy is going to be stopped no matter how much opposition comes my way God is going to protect me verse four one thing I love this verse one thing I have desire to the Lord that I will seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life see church we just can't get enough of church right and like this weekend if we think oh man there's a lot of services really that's not a lot of services praise God because the the heart of the believer is to constantly be with his people and be with God's presence that's the one desire a Psalm of David a manner for God's Own Heart because he wants to behold the beauty of the Lord and inquire in the temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion yeah that's the that's the Rapture description so brother Ram uses that verse in the time of trouble God will hide you in his Pavilion all right in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up upon a rock so God's going to hide you in a secret place and he's going to set you on a rock not a sinking sand and this is the rapture scripture how many want to stand on the rock of Christ Hallelujah in the time of trouble that's when he'll hide you that's when he'll protect you Hallelujah verse six and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yea I will sing praises unto the Lord hallelujah here oh Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me when thou said as seek seek ye my face my heart said unto you Thy Thy face Lord will I see now think about that with our meetings coming up this is a time we can seek God and we have to I believe God is asking me to seek his face more during this time praise God or else I would not have wanted to do these meetings when was the last time God said seek my face to you and then you and I responded see like this is a season to really seek God this is a season to draw close to God Hallelujah did we realize that let's not forget that there's Seasons we need to spend more time with the Lord Hallelujah I know that's the theme of almost every sermon right let's draw closer to God I want a closer walk with God I'm going to come up for a closer walk who doesn't want a closer walk with God but there are seasons where it's that time it is that time to see God time to be seeking after God's face in other words for the perfect will of God for a situation these are just such beautiful promises verse 9 hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been my help leave me not neither forsake me o God of my salvation when my father my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up brother amen could shout a good Amen to that one praise God Hallelujah when you're forsaken the Lord will he'll fight for you praise God he'll fight for you teach me thy way in verse 11 O Lord and Lead Me in thy in a plain path because of my enemies that's what I want a plain path praise God a simple straight forward plain bible-based path Hallelujah amen Deliver Me Not Over unto the will of mine enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and such as breathe out cruelty I had fainted unless I had believed to see goodness of the Lord in the land of living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thine heart way I say on the Lord how many ever hear does anybody ever feel like your heart's given up or faint the Bible said God will strengthen your heart praise God just wait on God even if you don't feel it just trust God God's going to strengthen it praise God just trust God he's going to make you stronger right wait on the Lord he'll renew your strength praise God wait on God be of good courage you know I was listening to this uh Malachi and I were I think Malachi might hurt we're listening to this political commentator today and there's a certain uh it's a certain mindset and it's it came from a guy who was a prisoner of war during Vietnam and he said there he actually was in a Vietnam prison for years and survived but he saw he saw three kinds of attitudes in in the in the uh in the in the prisoner camp and only one of them allowed the people to survive so he saw all his comrades die except the ones who had this mindset so the first mindset is the worst mindset there's no hope we're never getting out of here all those soldiers died if they took that mindset of hopelessness now the other mindset was they set they set their they set their Hope on a certain date we'll be out by Christmas was one of them did you hear that okay um and they had they had it okay well I'll be out by my by my birthday or I'll be out by next year and when that when that specific date came and went they they lost hope and died now think about that that's why no man knows the day or the the hour right in other words we're in this for a life praise God we're in this until he comes whether I go to the Grave or whether I go to meet him in the air I'm waiting on Jesus praise God but the attitude that got got them out was uh it was brutal honesty about conditions but yet also having a never give up attitude amen so the one the one idea oh I'm open for Christmas they would ignore all the symptoms they would ignore the beating they would ignore the chains they would ignore the the uh the the the Modi bread or whatever they were eating they would ignore that and just say oh I'm just hoping on this one day hoping on this one day and then they would eventually lose hope but it was the people who were realistic that they they said this is exactly what I'm going through it's hard but I'm not going to quit those are the only people that survived now may God give us a good lesson in that praise God we like when I preached on that sermon on complaining right I just read that again this week I read it again when I was in my in my devotion time it's okay to complain to God tell God this is exactly what I'm going through but I'm not giving up the Lord is my salvation he is the he's my life he's the strength of my life amen he'll renew my heart praise God Hallelujah the main thing is don't give up praise God keep trusting the Lord wait on the Lord he said be of good courage and God will strengthen your heart how many want to strengthen Heart Tonight God is going to do it praise God he's going to do it now does if God gives you a date or something like that well then yes it's thus saith the Lord you can you know God's going to show up on that date but if God doesn't give you a date you can't put your heart on a date you got to put your heart on God I think I'm going to preach at the point I thought that was really beautiful uh go to Psalm 37 23 you'll be familiar with this Psalms 37. 23 we're close just been noticing the Lord's been giving us some good Psalms scriptures lately these last few weeks verse 23 the steps of a good man are order of the Lord how many good men and women we got out there we got some good yeah I know we got all good ones here tonight actually Hallelujah got some good Brothers got some good sisters some good teenagers some good children a good man a good woman or or God is order your steps he has a certain order things you got to walk through praise God he's going to strengthen your heart along the way and he delighteth in his way look now look at that God Delights in your testimony don't ever think oh my life's not anything special our life is our life's all God Delights in your life that does saith the word of God that's not I don't want anyone to leave here to Scourge tonight praise God I'm really trying to lay it in thick God loves you God's delighting in your testimony he Delights in it you've chosen the right way yes things don't always work out as we want them to but let's trust God 's bringing us to a character he's bringing us to a stature of the image or the statue of the the character of Jesus Christ praise God like Birdman said I can't take Billy Graham's place and Billy Graham can't take my place you know how I found out this week brother Ram was a I have even more respect for brother Brandon because I watched a video on Billy Graham you know what he actually said it was okay to abort babies from rapes and other things and I'm like man this guy if he was a if he was a preacher to manage time a good preacher he really fell away from it just like Oral Roberts these guys fell far he's sitting there with a a suit and tie on slick back hair he's like yeah I believe in abortion's okay if a woman's been raped my brother Austin is a product of that and look at his life and look at his testimony look at him sing for Jesus praise God and sing for Jesus and that man that man money popularity he's got all that and he can't take a stand on the word of God thank God for a prophet who stood on the word of God praise God 's ordered our ways Hallelujah verse 24 though he fall though he fought church he should not be utterly cast down for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand take my hand when I got the strength to stand when you feel like you're gonna fall there's God he's got you just like Peter sinking he's got you he's gonna lift you up he's right there he's right there that's why he didn't fall and embarrass yourself that's why you didn't fall away from the faith because God was right there God preserves the path of the Saints verse 25 now this is true for us right I've been young I've been old yet I've not seen the righteous forsaken nor is seed beg and bread who's whoever here has been on the streets begging for food have you ever been lost okay that's that's begging you about that but that was kind of because of your home life yeah because yeah yeah but I also nice well anybody any anyone else beg for food before you don't think about that God has been gracious to us God loves us God has ordered your steps and he Delights in your way amen Hallelujah look at verse 26 he is ever merciful and lendeth and his seed is blessed depart from Evil and do good and dwell forevermore for the Lord loveth judgment and forsaketh not his sins now look at that now you got Old Testament and New Testament for they are preserved how long Church how long do you preserve for forever forever God's guarding you watching over you forever forever they are preserved forever but the seat of the wicked shall be cut off the righteous shall inherit the land and dwell there and forever now again think about that during the Millennium there's going to be no Wicked people here during the Millennium God's Saints are going to possess the Earth the meek The Humble people shall inherit the earth a bunch of humble rulers by God's grace hallelujah praise God he gives it to the humble I read this last night before we did the baptism Psalms 103 verse 4 and 5. I'm gonna read that Psalm 103. I'll just read three four and five my children could probably recite this I know you memorized this one time did you remember I saw him 103. what's your you can just join me here Psalm 103 verse 3 who forgiveth all that iniquities who healeth all eye diseases who redeem thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles amen God will he'll make you strong again we just read it he's going to give you strength in your heart again he's going to give you hope again praise God this is what God does Amen This Is Our God this is what he does amen he strengthens us he renews us praise God this is God he redeems our life from destruction looks like we're on a slip looks like we're going to fall he's right there to redeem us praise God amen we could honestly read that whole chapter but we're not going to let's look at a few New Testament verses uh we're almost done here Luke 5 38 Luke 5 3 so let's turn to the New Testament Luke 5 38 the course is the parable of new wine we don't put new wine we don't put fresh Revelation in in an old heart right now we've seen people fall away that that that's what happened they never got a new heart if the fresh tea preaching on water baptism and godhead and and serpent seed and signs Miracles and wonders and uh the Seven Seals if that doesn't preserve you then you never got a new heart but if you're still here you got a new heart with it too praise God Amen you got a new heart and a new spirit praise God okay new wide in a new bottle praise God oh thank God Hallelujah I'm not an old bottle I'm a new bottle praise God Luke 5 38 but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved that's how God preserves you it gives you a new heart and then he gives you the wine of stimulation of Revelation hallelujah oh that God is he's guided my steps praise God he's ordered all my steps he's not going to let me fall he's not going to let my my my my feet slip praise God he's going to let me dwell in the house the Lord forever he's going to hide me in the time of trouble praise God when my heart's weak and faint he's going to encourage me praise God he's going to lift me up praise God he's not going to let me fall praise God my enemies I'm going to see my enemies fall down as they're approaching unto me praise God Amen that's what God does hallelujah he preserves the way of the Saints amen and this is our testimony we get the fresh revelation of the hour we get a new heart and it preserves us year after year right in a decade I'm coming up to my second decade or I'm over my second decade yeah 2001. second decade 21 years praise God and I feel like I can't even scratch the surface of it you know I still got so much to know so much to understand so many people to share with praise God so many things I want to preach about and teach about praise God hallelujah uh Luke 1733 if you want to be preserved your your life preserved you've got to lose your life that's what Jesus says Luke 17 33 whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it so he won't be preserved if you seek to keep your natural desires of your life and whosoever shall lose his life shall preserve it so now we see now we have a we have responsibility in this God promises to preserve us if we lose our own desires if we crucify our our fleshly lusts and desires every day if we crucify the old man every day God will preserve us praise God what a promise amen remember Jesus said and this was this just struck me while I was preaching on Sunday God says I'm you just got to repent I'm going to give you the free gift of Grace right this is this amazing gift and then he says die every day crew be crucified every day I got this free gift now die crucify your flesh you desires every single day and you can do that because it's a free gift praise God because it's so great because of the Cross because of what Jesus did it should it motivates us to crucify our desires every single day because it's such a great gift amen right receive the gift now die every day but now the world the worldly church is going to tell you receive the free gift and now go make 10 million dollars or whatever right that's what they want to tell you oh yeah get uh speak that mercedes-bender speak it into existence name and claim it right that was different of God's leading you to something right but that's rarely the case in the scripture rarely is the case where do you see Peter say I'm going to speak to that uh Temple and I'm going to have that Temple as my church I'm going to speak to that church that's going to be my church no no you don't see him doing that you see him go to jail you've seen him speak I mean he spoke life to the paralyzed man thank God for that but see we have so we have this element in preserving Our Lives where we got to die to ourselves and it allows God of course to work in our lives more when we die out to ourselves because that's that's the gospel Jesus said you cannot me you cannot be my disciple unless you die every day right so we're gonna so in other words there's gonna be the foolish version we have a lot of foolish virgin who never really learned to be disciples they just got saved at the last moments they didn't die every day you know and I'm talking about like people like thief on the cross people like that I'm not talking about foolish versions like a lot that actually you know they tried to serve God they stood up for the truth and they didn't go into homosexuality and things like that he spoke against that that was good but it's this idea of receiving the gift of Grace and then you're so thankful for that you want to Die daily you want to become a follower of Christ you want to know Christ in his resurrection and also the powers resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings amen first Thessalonians 5 23 I remember years ago brother Craig preached a sermon called this and I couldn't remember but he called it preserved I think you call it preserved it was over in the other sanctuary first Thessalonians 5 23. the very God of Peace sanctify you holy remember sanctify means that make pure I think I read that last week it says and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ so God's going to guard your life and God Amen God is going to make sure that you're blameless Hallelujah remember I preach all those all those verses in Ephesians and Colossians the bride of Christ is Holy and blameless praise God she's unreprovable you can't correct her because the blood's already perfected or praise God the blood's already forgiven her like we said as though you did it as you never did in the first place remember last two weeks it's as though you're Justified as though you'd like to be justified like I'm sinless God sees my soul as sinless praise God that's what the Bible says second Timothy 4 18 doing a good job back there teenager thank you and the Lord shall deliver me and I love this from every evil work and will preserve me unto his Heavenly Kingdom yet he was going to be beheaded shortly after this letter was finished now look at that he didn't get delivered from the beheading but he said the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work that means it must have fit into God's plan for his life right he'll preserve me on his Heavenly Kingdom he was definitely preserved he was definitely protected in the midst of being a martyr remember God had given him prophecy God God gave Paul a prophecy after prophecy to prepare him for this moment right remember agabus said the man who's wearing this girdle will go and we'll go to Jerusalem right give his life God prepared him church God will prepare you for your life's calling God will prepare you for it and he'll preserve you there will be a place at the table for you by God's grace Hallelujah and Jude 1 verse 1 Jude 1 verse 1. Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James to them that are Sanctified by God the Father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called Hallelujah where are you preserved Church where where does God where does God guard you at in Christ again that's got to be your soul right I mean where where else your flesh is in Jesus all the time right your mind's not always on the things of God all the time right so I'm preserved in Christ I'm preserved in the plan of God in the mind of God he's got a place for me I got a place in his Heavenly Kingdom Hallelujah by the grace of God he'll preserve me blameless Hallelujah it's a beautiful beautiful promise let's close with these quotes I'm just going to read a few quotes in closing here almost at an hour wow that's kind of surprising to me but anyways um these quotes you know a few weeks ago I was like really desperate to find these quotes I hope there will be a blessing to you I was just thinking about how God knows right where you are Church so this is from Jehovah Jireh 1962. not sure if that means any much to anybody if I don't know if we go listen to it or not but brother I was talking about um God visiting Abraham you know in Genesis 18 in the flesh body and then God the angel Lord visiting uh Elizabeth and Zechariah to have John the Baptist okay here's this quote live so that if God would want to use you he knows right where to come get you you're in a position living a clean life before God your words are honest your life is true that's the kind of place that Angels come right look at Elizabeth and Zechariah see an honest upright walking all the Commandments of the Lord that's the way we want to live so when God gets ready to use us he say this is my people I can do this with this church what I want to they believe me they stand on my word see that's the way you want to do live the life now church what do you picture do you picture Jesus looks down at Akron and says that church is Right Where I want them now I can use them I believe so by God's grace if not well then oh come to the altar tonight right don't say don't let's not say in our sins and the proof of that is just what happened last night that's the proof of it God can use us however he wants to God gives us a faithful brother like brother Simon I can just call him he can be here next time God said I need a little church there that can uh they can have a preacher that could help out these Amish people to know the truth right amen I wasn't even thinking about that with that quote praise God so you needed a church he needed to use somebody to do that so he used us he said let's live in that way that when God gets ready to use us he'll say this is my people I can do this I can do with this church what I want to how many want to say that Lord just do in our church whatever you want to do praise God I love what Simon said I love what he said he said he said Lord if you want me to speak in tongues I'll speak in tongues that's how I want to be yielded to God lord if you want to uh if you want me to lay hands on the sick I'll lay hands on the sick praise God whatever you want me to do Lord I want to do it by God's grace how many feel that way praise God let me read another one here he's talking about how he says healing this is from Hebrews chapter six part two if you're interested in that that's okay from that healing should be in every local church all these gifts operating we've seen healing in our church but don't go to seed on those gifts don't pay any attention to the gift if God wants you or if God wants to use you for something he will do it he said but look at the giver now that I hope that encourages somebody if God wants to raise the dead in you God's going to do it why because you're yielding to him each day you're crucifying the flesh are you not each day your sister's got to put on modest clothing right keep your hair long I know I see my girls takes a long time to do your hair takes a long time to wash it a long time to dry it long time to brush it God sees that God sees that each day and when God wants to use you for something God's going to use God's going to come and find you right just like when Lena's mom was missing God really used Austin and Naomi's prayers remember that night God really used him that night when Haven need to uplift God really used sister who are there remember they're in the bathroom as an uplift when God needs you somebody you want to just be right there so God can use you he said don't look at the gift he said look at The Giver so Lord Jesus just use me however you want to use me praise God now here's a great prayer I've preached this numerous times just in passing from trying to do God of service 1965 's praying said father God keep these in your hands they are yours Lord talk about the people I pray God that will always walk humble before you how many want to be humble before the Lord here we don't know how long now look at that that was 1965. it's now then he says we don't desire to know how long now how many would honestly say Amen to that kind of like to know how long I think I just said that last year right Lord am I going to live to see the Rapture or not I think I prayed that to the Lord last year but man says we don't desire to know how long it is he said it's not our business he said that's your business Lord it's not our Wills to know when you will come it's our will Lord to keep humble till you do come and walk with you and I love this quote this is what I've always prayed it's our desire for you Lord to just let yourself be known once in a while father Among Us that we can see that we're still walking with you so and I'll just says Lord just show us every once in a while that you're preserving Our Lives like God just showed me these last few weeks he's preserving my life he's using me when he wants to he he watches all over my life like I said with Simon preaching nine things I nine things secrets in my heart that show me God loves me I mean I know God loved me with the kitchen and God loves me with my wife and my children but that that was a fresh reminder that God loves me when he'll come and preach and preaches all my sermons right in front of me he repeats my sermons to me and then plainly says exactly what I just went what I just suffered through I guess I'm with Austin if I ever knew God loves me it's right now oh yeah my finances were getting low and I was you know we go through Seasons like that I just kept praying I'm like oh Lord just give me Grace and the next day I wake up I always check my finances and then my tax return was in my bank account I'm like thank God I started crying I started crying I said Lord it was like a few days after that I just said Lord You Love Me thank you for loving me because Nobody Loves Me Like You you know we just we all get frustration we all get nervous we all have doubts and beers and it just it just it's just wonderful when God reminds us of his grace we've seen that last Wednesday remind me who I am he reminds us of his grace he reminds me that he's preserving my life he's ordaining my life for something for his will so my prayer tonight should probably be Lord help me not to desire to know when the Rapture is right because he said we don't want to know help me to be humble until it does happen praise God but in this quote this is from the sign and I just gotta this is my last quote basketball Let's Dance Alaska musician could go this is from the sign of this time on November 13 63. saying you can only speak thus saith the Lord if God gives you thus saith the Lord and he says if the Holy Spirit told me I'm gonna I want you to go to the presidential graveyard tomorrow and I'm going to bring up George Washington he said I'd invite the whole world to come see it he says but until he says that you just wait you see see you know listen until God gives you thus saith the Lord I'm going to just walk around here till God gives you thou say the Lord you just wait you see just wait Church see you know you're saved and you know you're filled with his goodness okay so let's not get anxious about thus saith the Lords and and all these answers of prayer which I do too I'm preaching to myself tonight this this thought was just on my heart tonight about God preserves the way of the Saints you know you're saved and you're filled with his goodness and you know how if he's in you he'll act his life out in you so just be satisfied he wants to use you he'll sure he'll short I'm sorry he'll sure do it he knows where you're at and the church said that's such an encouragement so I was I was I spent one morning like I spent an hour where I want to find all these quotes and I finally found him I put him in one email right there how many appreciate those quotes praise God let's live a life so God can look down and say I know how to use bride of Christ Fellowship Lord just show us every once in a while we're still walking with you and Lord show us how you're preserving Our Lives and Lord help me to live a life that when you want to use me you know right where to find me I won't be hiding from you actually I'll be hiding in you praise God I'll be hiding in your promises praise God let's buy our heads here for a minute church I hope you are encouraged tonight like I said I've just seen God excuse me in this way and that's not I'm not exalting myself at all but just I was just shocked to be used in this way like this of all the preachers not even the closest one there's a preacher in Columbus there's
