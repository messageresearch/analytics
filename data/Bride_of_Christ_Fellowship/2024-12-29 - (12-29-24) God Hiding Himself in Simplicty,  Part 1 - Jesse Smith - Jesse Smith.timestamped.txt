[2:12] too young strong handsome healthy by the
[2:16] grace of the Lord thankful for all God's
[2:17] blessings Hallelujah so I just you know
[2:20] I just thought it'd be good to revisit
[2:21] this here and
[2:22] um look at this sermon here it's a
[2:25] three-hour long sermon U brother BR
[2:27] takes about the first hour and he
[2:28] dedicates it to uh talking about the
[2:30] Tabernacle it's been under construction
[2:33] and let's see if uh so that's this is
[2:35] before the construction there in 1963
[2:38] that's what the brandom Tabernacle
[2:39] looked like uh by the grace of God uh
[2:42] brother R said people made fun of it and
[2:43] said it's just a garage and all these
[2:44] things like that but uh God was with
[2:46] them Hallelujah let people make fun let
[2:49] people criticize let people say whatever
[2:51] they want if God's with you who can be
[2:52] against you Hallelujah God's with you
[2:54] you're more than a conqueror in Christ
[2:56] Jesus Hallelujah and God has always uh
[2:59] even in the days of of Ezra Nehemiah you
[3:01] know God said don't despise the day of
[3:03] small things right so there's days of
[3:06] great things like we'd say the Open Door
[3:08] Church age the sixth Church age of uh
[3:10] Philadelphia that was a day of great
[3:12] things brother B said the greatest
[3:14] sermons The Greatest preachers the
[3:15] greatest books that were ever written
[3:17] some of the biggest churches like
[3:19] brother rod and I went down to Oberlin
[3:20] there uh L summer and uh Charles Fin's
[3:24] church was a massive Church beautiful
[3:26] church it's one of the most beautiful
[3:28] churches I've ever had the honor and
[3:30] privilege to step into uh just beautiful
[3:33] seats everything was uh the pulpit was
[3:35] beautiful everything I should have
[3:36] brought pictures of that I forgot to
[3:37] bring that maybe next time uh brother
[3:39] mam said Charles finny was a mighty man
[3:40] of God right here in Ohio right here in
[3:43] Ohio uh because he preached he said he
[3:45] had one of the greatest revivals since
[3:47] St Paul right here in Ohio so I'm
[3:49] thankful God placed me in Ohio I can
[3:51] have some of that Revival by God's grace
[3:52] I do have it Hallelujah but it's a it
[3:55] was a day of small things uh we'd say uh
[3:58] because it's the end of the church age
[3:59] right and Jesus said it's going to get
[4:01] fewer and fewer uh till uh the gospel
[4:04] goes around the world and then the last
[4:05] one gets saved the last one who wants
[4:07] the Holy Ghost we'll get the Holy Ghost
[4:09] praise God and then Jesus will come
[4:11] he'll snatch arazo he'll snatch away his
[4:14] bride and then pour out the wrath of God
[4:16] I put out a video about that yesterday
[4:18] about the order of events for the uh
[4:19] Great Tribulation period so it just it's
[4:22] humbling by God's grace it's it's
[4:24] humbling to think about what uh God's
[4:26] going to uh bring upon this unbelieving
[4:28] world so we should be thankful that
[4:30] God's revealed the truth unto us babes
[4:33] such as would learn we're spiritual
[4:35] babies Hallelujah in one way other words
[4:38] we can't compare to our great father we
[4:40] never will be able to compare to our
[4:42] great father as far as his infinite
[4:44] knowledge his grace and his power his
[4:47] ways are past finding out Hallelujah and
[4:49] so in in our sight we should always be
[4:51] humble we should always be like a little
[4:53] children that that can uh learn from the
[4:55] Lord that want to know more about God
[4:58] hallelujah so we read our text there of
[5:00] Jesus of course praying and he had just
[5:02] got done rebuking all those cities that
[5:04] had rejected him he said it'll be more
[5:06] tolerable on the day of Sodom a bunch of
[5:09] hor mongering sodomites it'll be more
[5:11] tolerable for them they'll have a a less
[5:13] punishment on the day of judgment than
[5:15] the people that maybe weren't sodomites
[5:17] but rejected the ministry of Jesus
[5:19] Christ amazing truth there I don't know
[5:21] how to explain that also I know it's an
[5:23] amazing truth that this gospel have must
[5:25] have been so powerful uh that even
[5:27] people that would live we'd say s uh
[5:29] normally uh nice lives uh holy lives yet
[5:33] they would get a worse punishment than
[5:34] even homosexuals because they rejected
[5:37] the word of God it should encourage us
[5:38] to receive the word of God today
[5:40] Hallelujah every Miracle God does every
[5:42] truth he gives us we should receive it
[5:44] and say thank God for it amen and say
[5:46] God give me more of it hallelujah we're
[5:48] not going to be like Leo DEA where we we
[5:49] don't have any we don't have any more
[5:51] need of anything we should we should uh
[5:52] we should not have that attitude we
[5:54] should have an attitude where I need
[5:55] more of God I'm hungry for the things of
[5:57] God I desire the things of God
[5:58] hallelujah
[6:00] Glory so the first hour will be a
[6:03] dedication if you get a chance to listen
[6:04] to it he has a he reads some scripture
[6:06] we'll get to it probably the next
[6:07] service here and then uh he starts
[6:10] preaching a he says I'm only going to
[6:12] preach for an hour but he preaches two
[6:14] hours so that's pretty good that's what
[6:16] I say when I say I'm going to close I
[6:17] usually need about 30 more minutes
[6:19] brother B said I'm going to close he G
[6:20] gave one more hour of preaching
[6:22] Hallelujah so I like that uh the first
[6:25] hours dedication and then in two hours
[6:26] sermon that was in the morning and then
[6:28] in the evening he preached the breach
[6:30] between the church ages and the Seven
[6:31] Seals which I already preached that to
[6:33] you by God's grace it was kind of in
[6:34] that order of the song so we got it on
[6:36] the YouTube if you'd like to listen to
[6:37] that so he begins here um in God hiding
[6:41] himself he begins by thanking brother
[6:43] Neville he said good morning friends I
[6:45] certainly deem this one of the
[6:47] highlights of my life to be in the
[6:49] Tabernacle again this morning to see its
[6:51] beautiful structure and the Order of the
[6:55] children of God setting in his house
[6:57] today so brother Ram this is the picture
[6:59] brother had in his mind all these years
[7:02] uh before 19 March of 1963 early 1963
[7:05] remember he left Jeffersonville uh in
[7:08] December I'm sorry um it would have been
[7:10] December no it would have been January
[7:12] 1st of 1963 he left there was gone three
[7:15] months and then he came back in March so
[7:17] he'd been gone three months January
[7:19] February March three and a half months
[7:21] because he gets there on the 17th of
[7:23] March 1963 and in 3 months time they had
[7:26] a tremendous transformation as we'll see
[7:29] it by God God's grace you'll see it uh
[7:30] what they did is they expanded uh that
[7:32] way I think it's to the north side of
[7:34] the church I've been there numerous
[7:35] times now they expanded it by 30% and
[7:38] they finished the construction in March
[7:40] of 1963 and brother man said I was so
[7:43] astonished when I got here yesterday and
[7:45] seen the looks of the building I never
[7:48] dreamed it would be this way and brother
[7:50] uh brother we've been there brother Jose
[7:52] we never dreamed it right we got to
[7:54] experience uh what brother BR never
[7:56] dreamed uh his church would look like by
[7:58] the grace of God I encourage you I
[7:59] encourage everybody to go to brandom
[8:00] Tabernacle if you haven't been there I
[8:02] would encourage you to try to get there
[8:03] by God's grace you'll be blessed you'll
[8:05] be see you you'll see I'm going to show
[8:06] it today you'll see the Simplicity
[8:08] you'll see the humility of Christ makes
[8:11] you appreciate the Lord and all that God
[8:13] has done through brother Brandon's
[8:14] Ministry he said I never dreamed I saw
[8:17] the blueprints uh and I just seen a
[8:19] little room sitting on the other side so
[8:21] brother saw the blueprints where they
[8:22] would just draw another uh they'd have
[8:24] another room over here on the side he
[8:26] said but I never imagined he said I find
[8:28] what a beautiful place we're sitting in
[8:30] I'm grateful to almighty God for this
[8:32] beautiful
[8:33] place and then he says this morning I'm
[8:35] bringing greetings from my wife and my
[8:37] children who long to be here at this
[8:39] time for this dedicational service a
[8:41] week of consecration to Christ now we've
[8:43] never done that at our church I've never
[8:46] uh felt the leading of the Lord to do
[8:47] that but perhaps I will in the future
[8:48] they had Services Sunday to Sunday every
[8:51] day two on the first Sunday two on the
[8:54] last Sunday that's quite a a number of
[8:56] services right and he called it a week
[8:59] of
[8:59] consecration but he said my children are
[9:02] in school and it's hard to get
[9:04] away uh so think about this think about
[9:07] this uh the Seven Seals was fulfilling I
[9:10] believe Revelation 10 1:7 God was
[9:13] stepping down and revealing the open
[9:15] book through the Seven Seals and brother
[9:17] Braham didn't feel L the Lord to have
[9:19] his wife and children come to the
[9:21] revelation of the Seven
[9:22] Seals isn't that something his wife and
[9:25] children stayed in Arizona for school
[9:27] purposes while brother alone came to do
[9:30] that so I just want you to to see what a
[9:32] emphasis brother brandham placed on
[9:35] education now of course he balls out if
[9:37] youve listen to any sermons lately he
[9:38] balls out doctors of divinity and PhD
[9:41] scientists because Mo most of the time
[9:44] they try to they try to discourage your
[9:46] faith in
[9:47] God right that's why brother R balls out
[9:49] education and Science and all these
[9:51] things but in in but in his in his daily
[9:54] actions with his family education was
[9:56] very important CH church let me say this
[9:59] we we should give our children the best
[10:00] education we
[10:02] can because they never know you'll never
[10:04] know how God's going to use it don't
[10:07] slack on education if you slack as
[10:09] parents if we slack on education that
[10:11] shows our children our attitude towards
[10:12] learning and then how are they going to
[10:14] learn when they get on a job and they
[10:15] got to go to maybe they got to go to
[10:16] trade school how are they goingon to
[10:18] what's their attitude going to be it's
[10:19] probably going to be a lazy attitude if
[10:21] we slack on educating our children but
[10:24] look at brother B's example I left my
[10:27] children I you know and he tells us
[10:28] later revelation 10 1-7 is history it's
[10:31] already it's going to be fulfilled in
[10:32] this week but yet his wife and children
[10:34] have the important duty of staying true
[10:36] to their educational
[10:39] foundations Hallelujah and this wasn't
[10:41] just something brother Ram did once
[10:44] numerous times if you L listen to the
[10:45] message brother Ram would do this later
[10:47] on the same year at the end of
[10:49] 1963 uh brother Ram's preaching Look
[10:51] Away to Jesus that's a powerful message
[10:53] on on the uh the third poll and the
[10:55] squeeze that's the sermon brother man
[10:57] preached the longest on The Squeeze he
[10:59] talks about the five times the third
[11:00] poll was used but he says this and Look
[11:03] Away to Jesus he says I'm going home
[11:05] tomorrow so this was a Sunday he said
[11:06] I'm going home on Monday so he won't be
[11:08] here for the New Year's meeting but
[11:10] we're remembering you I believe there'll
[11:11] be a meeting here on New Year's night
[11:13] that's right a watch Service as they
[11:15] always have a New Year's night we'd like
[11:16] to stay but we just can't get back in
[11:19] time to get the kides in school and my
[11:22] wife has got to wash up their clothes
[11:24] you know how it
[11:26] is so any parent with children knows how
[11:29] it is brother Ram couldn't stay for the
[11:31] watch Night Service at Brenham
[11:33] Tabernacle at the end of 1963 CU they
[11:36] had to wash clothes and get ready for
[11:38] school and the church said see we only
[11:41] hear sometimes we only hear one side of
[11:43] brother Ram sermons on on on school or
[11:45] education how come we don't hear this
[11:47] side well you hear it if you're a real
[11:48] child of God hallelujah like somebody
[11:51] sent me a uh a quote this week where
[11:53] brother baham said
[11:55] um brother Braham said something about
[11:57] how Sunday school isn't in the word of
[11:59] God and it's not right you don't you
[12:01] don't see the early church uh starting
[12:03] Sunday school look up Sunday school does
[12:05] anyone see Sunday School in the book of
[12:06] Acts no And so there's times brother man
[12:09] is bringing out he's being a little
[12:10] critical of it and it's not in the word
[12:11] of God that's because denomination
[12:13] sometimes place too much on that but
[12:15] then other quotes uh he tells the
[12:18] parents he said it's a sin just to take
[12:20] your children to Sunday school and the
[12:22] brother texted me and said why is it a
[12:23] sin to take your children to Sunday
[12:24] school I said keep reading the quote
[12:26] brother R said it's a sin just to take
[12:28] your kids to Sunday school and you don't
[12:30] go to Sunday
[12:32] school Hallelujah in other words brother
[12:34] said there was he knew families that
[12:35] would just drop their kids off for
[12:37] Sunday school and leave and go to the
[12:38] grocery store or just go home and do
[12:40] something in other words everybody needs
[12:42] to learn the word of God hallelujah
[12:44] adults children everybody should be in
[12:46] the house of God
[12:48] hallelujah so you got you got quotes on
[12:50] both sides and then in this sermon
[12:52] brother B says I've been criticized we
[12:54] don't have rooms for Sunday school he
[12:56] said but now we got them
[12:59] see the devil is always going to find
[13:01] something to criticize the people of God
[13:03] on for years they said oh just a small
[13:05] little building they don't have Sunday
[13:07] school rooms what kind of a how could
[13:09] this man be a prophet they couldn't
[13:10] afford
[13:11] it
[13:13] Hallelujah said we had to have all these
[13:15] people move in when all these people he
[13:17] said most of our church isn't even from
[13:20] Jeffersonville he said God had to send
[13:22] people into Jeffersonville just so they
[13:24] could build on to the church and afford
[13:25] a little better building praise
[13:28] God oh but see if God wants to do
[13:30] something wait on the Lord God will
[13:32] provide every need every need every
[13:34] every penny every dollar if God's going
[13:36] to do it God will provide it
[13:38] Hallelujah that's right so see here's
[13:42] just two quotes So for the Seven Seals
[13:44] and then later on the year the end of uh
[13:46] 1963 the watch night services brother
[13:49] Brandon missed services to get the kids
[13:52] ready for school Hallelujah remember
[13:54] there's that that great quote brother
[13:56] Ram says he says after to if you want it
[13:58] you can add you can text me later like
[13:59] Jose always does that's good good job
[14:02] Jose brother man says it he says I wish
[14:04] I didn't have to send my children to
[14:05] these evil high schools I'm just
[14:07] paraphrase it he said but you know what
[14:09] no matter if we were in high school or
[14:11] my children were out on an Indian
[14:13] Reservation he said whatever's inside of
[14:15] them is going to come
[14:17] out Hallelujah got the balance right
[14:21] brother says oh there's awful things at
[14:23] the high school but then he says there's
[14:25] also awful things out there on the
[14:26] Indian
[14:27] Reservation see I've seen this week
[14:30] people have tried to they you ever seen
[14:31] it they try to move off grid there's
[14:34] this young uh generation of you young
[14:36] married couples their whole their whole
[14:38] desire life is to move away from all the
[14:40] electricity and and yet somehow they
[14:42] move away from electricity then they
[14:43] post internet videos I don't understand
[14:45] that that's hypocrisy they say they want
[14:47] to get out from the grid but then they
[14:50] get back into the
[14:51] grid right so they try to get off the
[14:55] grid but then they want to be a part of
[14:56] the grid to make money but brother says
[14:59] no matter where you are sin's going to
[15:01] find you out think about Cain and Abel
[15:04] there was hardly any sin really I mean
[15:06] that's was the very beginning and what
[15:07] happened murder still came out of that
[15:10] and their parents were Adam and Eve
[15:12] their parents could tell them about the
[15:14] the pillar of fire uh the logos the
[15:17] spirit of God God talking I was talking
[15:19] face to face with God's
[15:21] logos and even that wasn't enough so it
[15:24] depends on what seed you are amen thank
[15:26] God for the seed of God today Hallelujah
[15:29] you ought to Rejoice if you got the seed
[15:31] of God and how you know you got the seed
[15:32] of God brother said you want to do
[15:34] everything according to the word of God
[15:36] the spirit of God will never lead you
[15:38] outside of the Bible brother R said it
[15:41] over and over again the spirit of God
[15:42] will always lead you to the Bible not
[15:44] away from the Bible
[15:47] Hallelujah so this was common brother
[15:49] Ram often dedicated his uh schedule to
[15:53] when his children were in
[15:57] school then he goes into talk talking
[15:59] about his friends he says I appreciate
[16:01] friends everywhere but there's something
[16:03] about old friends no matter where you
[16:05] make new friends it's still isn't the
[16:07] old and brother R starts crying thinking
[16:09] about the old friends he had at brandom
[16:10] Tabernacle all those years
[16:12] ago he said no matter wherever I'd roam
[16:16] this spot will always be sacred how many
[16:18] know what I'm talking about Hallelujah
[16:20] when we first started our church there
[16:22] uh on water and the other roads even up
[16:24] there where Jose used to live what was
[16:25] the name of that road brother you
[16:27] remember MO Drive God bless you you got
[16:30] a good memory brother those places
[16:32] sometimes I drive by there even waterl
[16:34] Road there's that that Village Discount
[16:36] sometimes I drive by there and I just
[16:37] say thank the Lord those are sacred
[16:39] places to me God met me there God heard
[16:41] my prayers there God healed the sick
[16:43] there uh that's where some of my
[16:44] children got saved those are sacred
[16:46] places hallelujah amen any place where
[16:49] God meets you it's kind of like Jacob
[16:51] you want to set up an altar Hallelujah
[16:53] let's set up an altar let's worship God
[16:55] God's met me Hallelujah God's been with
[16:57] me he's been faithful Hallelujah so
[16:59] these are sacred places where God meets
[17:02] you and brother bam said for about 30
[17:04] years ago in a Muddy Pond bed I
[17:07] dedicated this piece of ground to Jesus
[17:10] Christ and it wasn't nothing but a mud
[17:13] bed so if you've ever seen uh you know
[17:16] that the brandom Tabernacle there right
[17:18] now it's all flat and everything but
[17:19] before that this was there was a pond
[17:22] there a mud Pond and brother raham tells
[17:25] us there was lies growing out of it he
[17:27] said that's this was all a pond that's
[17:30] the reason the streets out of cader
[17:32] there the road had to go around to get
[17:34] away from the pond that was there and
[17:37] here there used to be lies Pond Lies
[17:39] come up remember this is also the same
[17:41] place where brother brandom saw a vision
[17:43] of Jesus Christ when he was a little boy
[17:46] remember when he was a little boy his
[17:47] dad was making him pack uh uh all the
[17:50] water for the the wine and the whiskey
[17:52] and everything like that one time he
[17:53] stopped right here and this is where he
[17:55] saw Jesus Christ in a sage field down
[17:57] here by the pond this is the first time
[18:00] amen where he saw Jesus Hallelujah and
[18:03] he passed out and and he woke up uh in
[18:06] the morning you know so he was he was
[18:07] basically sleeping all night because he
[18:09] saw the Lord Jesus right here amen
[18:12] that's a shame to see what they've done
[18:13] to it but uh God had foretold God and
[18:17] church if you look at it a lot of times
[18:18] the the children of prophets get off the
[18:20] word of God in the
[18:22] Bible right a lot you got to look at the
[18:24] Bible because Satan is attacking them so
[18:26] hard he points all his guns as we said
[18:28] he points all of his guns on the family
[18:30] of the Prophet so we got to be in prayer
[18:33] of course continue to pray I continue to
[18:35] pray for
[18:36] them brother Bram said uh he said there
[18:38] would be lies Pond Lies come up here the
[18:41] LI is a very strange flower though it's
[18:43] though it's born in mud it has to press
[18:46] its way through the mud and then through
[18:48] the waters and slime to get itself up to
[18:50] the top to show its beauty Glory
[18:54] hallelujah amen and I think this morning
[18:56] that's a whole lot of what's happened
[18:58] here that since that time a little Pond
[19:00] Lily has pushed itself and when it got
[19:03] to the top of the water it spread its
[19:05] wings forth its little pedals went out
[19:07] and it reflected the lily of the
[19:11] valley so brother said there was lies on
[19:14] this Pond where the church was and it
[19:16] reminded him of the lily of the valley
[19:18] in the scripture which we'll get to so
[19:21] here's the current brandom
[19:23] Tabernacle so it was expanded so
[19:25] basically this section right here was
[19:26] added on this whole section on the the
[19:29] we'd say for us it's the left side or
[19:30] the North side I believe of the building
[19:33] here so that's the current bream
[19:34] Tabernacle today so when you walk in
[19:36] right in the front there's a small
[19:37] little vegetable you go to either side
[19:40] off to this side is the mother's room uh
[19:42] I forget what's off to the side there I
[19:44] don't remember that
[19:45] one and then after that you both sides
[19:48] move around to the sanctuary you have
[19:50] the sanctuary here long sanctuary and
[19:52] then the back then you have we'll show
[19:53] it to you the baptismal room uh and then
[19:56] the uh the communion room where we got
[19:58] the bread and the wine the baptismal and
[20:01] on the very far back right side is the
[20:03] pastor's study very simple Church very
[20:05] humble Church by the grace of God
[20:07] hallelujah but to me it's a sacred Place
[20:09] Hallelujah because the word that came
[20:11] out of this church has transformed my
[20:13] life and I'll say like this it's changed
[20:15] my destination Hallelujah because in my
[20:17] mind I was determined to go a certain
[20:19] way with whatever church but when the
[20:20] message came to me it changed my destiny
[20:23] and now I'll take my way with the Lord's
[20:25] despise for few Hallelujah people can
[20:27] despise me whatever want but I've got a
[20:29] Bible I know what the Bible says and I
[20:31] know the Bible is thus sayith the Lord
[20:33] hallelujah so people can say whatever
[20:35] they want Hallelujah now I don't know if
[20:37] these were the lies or not church I just
[20:39] typed in Indiana Pon lies that's all I
[20:41] typed into the internet and this is what
[20:44] came up so perhaps this was the lies so
[20:47] perhaps brother Ram saw a pond of Lies
[20:49] like this and brother Ram said your life
[20:52] is like a lily you start off your life
[20:55] in sin in the mud and muck of sin but
[20:58] you you've got to grow up pretty you
[21:00] want to show everybody uh the beauty
[21:02] inside you right I'm not talking about
[21:04] the natural I'm talking about the Christ
[21:06] in you and so you've got to grow up you
[21:08] got to grow into God and pretty soon you
[21:11] you'll break the top of the water but
[21:12] you're not done yet you still got a
[21:15] blossom you still got to Blossom and and
[21:17] then give out your fragrance give out
[21:19] your beauty in this case to all the the
[21:21] flies that would pass by or the Birds uh
[21:25] that would help pollinate this or the
[21:26] bats whatever it may be the different
[21:29] Wildlife that would need this you got to
[21:31] you got to Blossom and express your love
[21:34] to God and then people coming by people
[21:36] in your life can say wow that's a real
[21:38] Christian Hallelujah I enjoy
[21:40] fellowshipping with brother so- and so I
[21:42] enjoy fellowshipping with sister so and
[21:44] so why because you've expressed the
[21:45] beauty of Christ and the Beauties out
[21:47] there it's just for other people to
[21:49] enjoy amen the beauty of your life is
[21:52] just for other people to enjoy the life
[21:55] that you live for Christ so people can
[21:56] look at that person say that's a real
[21:59] if I ever met somebody that really loves
[22:00] God it's that brother or sister
[22:02] hallelujah
[22:06] hallelujah now if I show you when I next
[22:08] I'll show you the picture of the lily of
[22:10] the valley so look now look at this
[22:11] study this and you've probably seen
[22:14] these on ponds before you know if you go
[22:15] to different ponds and uh even Parks you
[22:17] know you'll see different lies growing
[22:19] up and brother Ram said it was lies but
[22:21] he said it reminded him of lies of the
[22:23] Valley now these are much smaller plants
[22:25] but they can go pretty tall If You Ever
[22:27] Seen The Lily of Valley so these are
[22:28] very small
[22:30] pedals okay so brother R he's just
[22:32] making a connection there was lies on
[22:34] the pond and it reminded him of the word
[22:36] lily of the valley
[22:40] Hallelujah and so the Indiana water lily
[22:43] and the lily of the valley they're not
[22:44] even in the same plant family totally
[22:46] different
[22:47] families they're only share the name
[22:49] Lily because of their appearance and
[22:51] Beauty so somebody you know who was over
[22:53] in Jerusalem or whatever uh who you know
[22:55] whichever Englishman came to United
[22:57] States and then they saw Pond Lily you
[22:59] know they say oh that's beautiful like a
[23:01] lily they just gave it the name of the
[23:02] Lily but it's not even actually in the
[23:04] family of the lily of the
[23:06] valley it's just given the name Lily
[23:10] Hallelujah because of the beauty and its
[23:13] appearance Lil of the valleys are much
[23:15] smaller of
[23:17] course now the Bible uses the lies 15
[23:21] times eight of them are in the Song of
[23:23] Solomon so this one right here Song of
[23:27] Solomon 2:2 and a lily among Thorns so
[23:30] is my love among the
[23:32] daughters
[23:34] Hallelujah so these lies were uh they
[23:37] were so uh what's the word I'm looking
[23:39] for uh they were so versatile that's the
[23:41] word I'm looking for Glory these lies
[23:43] could grow anywhere they could grow in
[23:46] the forest they could grow in the valley
[23:48] they could grow amongst thorns and
[23:49] that's the way a Christian is hallelujah
[23:52] a Christian can can be around
[23:53] non-christians and still give off the
[23:55] beauty of the Lily the valley Hallelujah
[23:58] no matter where you grow they grow all
[24:00] over the place lies of the valley even
[24:02] grow in Aran Ohio praise God they grew
[24:05] up they grow in Liberty Center Ohio
[24:07] Hallelujah they grow all over the place
[24:09] and that's what the thing about the Lily
[24:10] the valley they'll grow almost anywhere
[24:12] praise
[24:14] God so the first time it's recorded
[24:17] where Solomon says as the Lily among
[24:20] Thorns so is my love so so Solomon found
[24:23] his wife there the shulamite Solomon
[24:25] found her remember he he was he was just
[24:27] riding by in his car and all these women
[24:29] and men are working the fields they're
[24:31] just you know the peasants of the world
[24:32] but he saw this one beautiful woman and
[24:34] he said you're like the Lily that grows
[24:37] amongst all of these Thorns I wish Lily
[24:39] was here she could hear her name about
[24:41] 50 times in the sermon hopefully she's
[24:43] streaming by God's grace Lily have a
[24:44] beautiful scriptural Name by God's grace
[24:47] Hallelujah and that's what Solon said
[24:49] it's like I'm just riding along there's
[24:51] Thorns everywhere there's maybe rose
[24:52] bushes or just thorns and there's a
[24:54] beautiful lily of the valley in the
[24:56] midst of all this pain and
[24:59] suffering that's what Christ is to us
[25:02] Christ is our Lily the valley amongst
[25:04] all the Thorns of this life and that's
[25:06] what you can be to those who need it to
[25:09] Sinners around you you can be a lily of
[25:11] the valley as well Hallelujah among
[25:14] Thorns that's what I try to be I try to
[25:16] be as a teacher in the public school I
[25:18] try to be a lily amongst all the
[25:21] Thorns right all the evil influences
[25:24] kids will tell me I watch this and I'll
[25:25] say oh I'm so sorry you watch that those
[25:27] things break my heart heart you know I
[25:28] just try to influence them in any way I
[25:30] can to be a lily to be sweet uh to give
[25:34] off the right fragrance to show the
[25:37] Beauty and the character of Jesus Christ
[25:39] Hallelujah amongst Thorns Song of
[25:42] Solomon 6 verse2 my beloved has gone
[25:44] down into his garden to the beds of
[25:47] spices to feed in the garden and to
[25:49] gather the lies so Salon would go down
[25:51] and he'd pick out these lies just for
[25:53] his
[25:54] wife there's a good tip for Mali when he
[25:56] starts cing a girl here by God's grace
[25:58] pick her some beautiful flowers and they
[26:01] say where's Solomon oh he's down there
[26:03] picking the lies of the valley he's
[26:04] picking them he going to have all these
[26:07] they look like beautiful Bells don't
[26:08] they like golden bells or white Bells
[26:10] you know he's down there picking them
[26:12] because they're so beautiful I'm going
[26:14] to start looking for these coming up
[26:15] here in Spring by God's grace see if
[26:17] they grow around us so they were so
[26:20] beautiful that even a king would go out
[26:22] looking for these beautiful
[26:24] flowers Hallelujah now I know after this
[26:26] I'm going to get a good text from my
[26:27] wife explain to me where I miss taught
[26:29] about the lily of the valley so thank
[26:31] you hun if you're watching I know you'll
[26:33] help me I'm just basing all this on my

[26:36] experience in Jerusalem I don't have any
[26:38] experience really with Pond llies other
[26:40] than seeing them Hosea 14:5 says I will
[26:43] be as the doe unto Israel he shall grow
[26:46] as the Lily and cast forth his roots as
[26:49] a Lebanon because remember lies in the
[26:51] valley grew
[26:53] anywhere so uh God said grow as a lily
[26:57] does so wherever you're planted grow

[28:25] character and the expression the beauty

[29:00] Christian praise God am that's right

[29:16] for that he said we have to rest in
[29:18] Christ and not let not let anxieties get
[29:22] to us we have to rest in the forn
[29:25] knowledge the sovereignty of God if God
[29:27] planted me here he's going to feed me
[29:29] he's going to take care of me he's going
[29:30] to make sure I grow to be what he called
[29:32] me to be hallelujah amen amen you know
[29:36] my wife was telling me uh we've talked
[29:37] about this we've had so many people
[29:39] leave our church and then we talk to
[29:40] them later and they're so thankful they
[29:42] got to come to church here just for a
[29:44] few years or a few months and uh just
[29:47] enjoy the beauty of the spirit of God
[29:49] that that we feel amongst each
[29:52] other so our friends from Texas right
[29:55] now they're here we don't know how long
[29:56] they'll be here but we want to be we
[29:59] want to show the character of Christ as
[30:00] long as they're here we want them to
[30:02] know there's people that really love
[30:03] Jesus amen there's people that really
[30:06] have the character of the lily of the
[30:08] valley Jesus
[30:10] Christ Hallelujah I hope they're here
[30:12] forever by God's grace we hope
[30:15] so but Jesus says consider the lies they
[30:18] don't toil they don't
[30:20] spin other words a Christian life is not
[30:23] a bad life it's the best life my wife
[30:26] shared a podcast with me you know what
[30:27] the new this is I'm going to get into
[30:29] marriage here about family you know what
[30:31] the re you know what the real research
[30:32] on marriage says the happiest marriages
[30:35] are Christians who are dedicated but the
[30:37] man has the biggest influence over the
[30:40] marriage if that man really loves God if
[30:43] he spends time with his family if he
[30:45] spends time with his children and he can
[30:47] listen to his wife and take advice when
[30:49] before he makes the decision if if he
[30:51] can spend time with his family those are
[30:53] the happiest marriages and those
[30:55] marriages last much longer they always
[30:57] say oh uh Christian marriages they
[30:59] divorce just as much as uh the the
[31:01] Sinners no they don't not with the happy
[31:03] Christians I'm talking about the real
[31:05] Christians Amen in other words there's
[31:07] two kinds of Christians and this is a
[31:09] study Church these people don't even
[31:10] know the message but yet they say
[31:12] there's two kinds of Christians devoted
[31:14] and nominal that means in name
[31:16] only that's like the foolish virgin
[31:19] right in other words if you just take
[31:21] the stats of the Holy Ghost filled
[31:23] people they're married the longest and
[31:25] they're happiest praise God
[31:28] Hallelujah and the the biggest indicator
[31:30] on if that family is going to be happy
[31:32] is if the man truly loves God because
[31:35] he's a
[31:36] leader Hallelujah all the research shows
[31:39] that Christians are the happiest why
[31:41] because it's a lily it's it's a beauty
[31:45] right uh the man has to show the be of
[31:47] course the woman too but I'm talking
[31:48] about the leader as Christ the man
[31:50] represents Christ he's got to be the
[31:51] leader he's got the one that shows the
[31:53] love of God to the rest of the family
[31:55] praise God hallelujah I'm going to
[31:58] preach more on that eventually by God's
[31:59] grace I feel this might be the this
[32:01] podcast and the research might be the
[32:03] nudge I can finally get to write that
[32:05] book on family I've been wanting to
[32:06] right I wrote one chapter but I never
[32:07] picked up after that I've just been kind
[32:09] of waiting for
[32:10] inspiration uh by the grace of
[32:13] God lies uh grow in valleys in the field
[32:17] they grow among
[32:18] Thorns uh they can be cultivated to grow
[32:20] in
[32:22] gardens and uh God's blessing was spoken
[32:25] he'll grow as the Lily so when lies grow
[32:28] up uh it's a sign of God's fruitfulness
[32:31] lies grow rapidly and commonly so they
[32:33] spring up everywhere all these beautiful
[32:35] testimonies Hallelujah they spring up
[32:39] everywhere now here uh let's look at
[32:41] some of these symbols here a lily is a
[32:44] sweet and fragrant flower with a strong
[32:47] scent this is typical of Jesus Jesus
[32:50] gave himself for an offering and is
[32:53] sacrificing to God for a sweet smelling
[32:55] Savor so this types Jesus Jesus
[32:58] hallelujah it's fragrant it's got a
[33:00] beautiful smell and all your worship to
[33:02] God all your songs all your ties and
[33:04] offerings all your love for God
[33:06] everything you do to give God glory it's
[33:08] a sacrifice it's a spiritual scent that
[33:11] goes up to heaven amen your prayers are
[33:13] as incense Hallelujah is that right
[33:17] Hallelujah so these are beautiful uh
[33:20] flowers just to smell and lean in and
[33:23] enjoy the fragrance and that's what your
[33:25] life is supposed to be Hallelujah
[33:28] the Lily is white and very beautiful it
[33:30] exceeds all other flowers for whiteness
[33:33] it's the whitest white you're going to
[33:34] see on a
[33:36] plant this is because of course uh the
[33:40] white is a picture of the purity of the
[33:42] righteousness of Christ remember
[33:44] Revelation 19 uh the Bible said in
[33:46] Revelation 19 uh that the righteousness
[33:49] is like white fine
[33:51] linen
[33:52] Hallelujah so this is Purity Hallelujah
[33:56] and the Bride of the Lamb will be
[33:57] clothed in white Revelation 19:8
[33:59] Hallelujah so this represents Jesus who
[34:02] knew no sin the white represents Purity
[34:06] and this is what Christ gave for us
[34:07] Christ gave us a testimony a pure
[34:10] testimony he always did that which
[34:12] pleased the
[34:14] father a lily is very fruitful one root
[34:18] may put forth 50
[34:20] bulbs 50 fold that's a really good
[34:22] increase 50 fold amen 50 times that
[34:26] amount I was looking at Bitcoin I think
[34:28] Bitcoin went up 130% this last
[34:31] year right so that's only like one and
[34:34] that's only like one and a half it's not
[34:35] even one and a half times it but this is
[34:37] 50 times this is how much more fruitful
[34:41] Jesus is than even Bitcoin
[34:45] Hallelujah the Lily is one of the
[34:47] tallest of flowers and yet look it hangs
[34:49] its head down everybody noticed that
[34:51] look how humble it is it's one of the
[34:53] tallest but it hangs its head in
[34:55] humility this is a picture of of Jesus
[34:58] because the Bible said he humbled
[35:00] himself and took upon him the death of
[35:02] the
[35:04] Cross right and remember the wheat seeds
[35:06] what do the wheat seeds do in Harvest
[35:07] they bow their heads church we ought to
[35:09] Bow ourselves we ought to submit
[35:11] ourselves to the leadership of the Holy
[35:16] Ghost Jesus said it was of him being in
[35:18] the form of God thought it not robbery
[35:20] to be equal with God but made himself of
[35:22] no reputation took upon himself the form
[35:25] of a servant and was made in the light
[35:27] less a men and being found in fashion as
[35:30] a man he humbled himself and became
[35:33] obedient unto death even the death of
[35:35] the Cross Hallelujah so he humbled
[35:39] himself that he might die for you and
[35:41] see that's our question today who are
[35:43] you dying for who are you living for
[35:45] today most of us if it's our husband or
[35:47] wife right our families that's who we're
[35:50] supposed to serve like we tell the PE
[35:52] young men when they get married once you
[35:54] get married you're no longer living for
[35:56] yourself you're living for your family
[35:58] so that's how a Christian most often
[36:01] expresses his love uh for Jesus his
[36:04] whole service now is to take care of his
[36:06] wife his children he's supposed to
[36:08] Humble himself and take care of them
[36:10] remember a man that won't provide for
[36:12] his own is worse than an Infidel and an
[36:15] Infidel says there's no God an Infidel
[36:18] won't worship God an Infidel will blashe
[36:20] the Holy Ghost but the Bible says a man
[36:22] that comes to church and won't provide
[36:24] for his own is worse than that God help
[36:27] us to provide for our own praise God God
[36:31] help us to see who are we here sent to
[36:33] serve who am I to serve Hallelujah I
[36:36] just find it amazing whenever strange or
[36:38] whenever uh difficult things happen God
[36:40] always provides always provides I've
[36:43] just seen God always step in God
[36:44] supernaturally does this God
[36:46] supernaturally does that God
[36:47] supernaturally does that there's been
[36:48] people overseas that have needed uh
[36:50] offerings and I'll say well I don't have
[36:52] it right now I said but you pray and if
[36:54] God sends me unexpected money then I'll
[36:55] send it to you and it's happened a
[36:56] number of times
[36:58] God hears the voice of people who are
[37:00] really crying out and really need
[37:02] something from him and the last thing
[37:04] the Lily has many medicinal
[37:07] qualities it could be used to restore a
[37:10] lost Voice Hallelujah the voice of the
[37:13] Bride it could help give you strength if
[37:15] you're
[37:17] fainting it's good for the liver and
[37:19] help helps
[37:21] dropy because the Lord Jesus Christ is
[37:23] the great physician and he's fully
[37:26] capable of curing all disease diseases
[37:28] and maladies of the Soul so consider
[37:31] this a beautiful type of the Lord Jesus
[37:33] Christ how many consider that today amen
[37:35] let's see what I got next after here
[37:37] okay yeah I'm going to get to this in a
[37:38] moment okay this is the picture taken on
[37:40] that uh dedication morning when uh you
[37:43] seen the picture probably brother R
[37:44] brother R's getting the Cornerstone and
[37:46] he's laying in the Cornerstone on the
[37:48] day uh they laid the foundation of the
[37:50] Tabernacle this was taken right after
[37:51] that and there's brother BR look a 21y
[37:53] old brother BR 21 or 22 that's what he
[37:55] looked like doesn't he look so full of
[37:58] hope so hopeful for the future he hadn't
[38:02] even gone out yet this is in the 1933 if
[38:04] I'm not mistaken maybe 34 it was going
[38:08] to still be till 1947 that he actually
[38:10] went out and preached with his gift with
[38:13] his uh three with his two gifts the
[38:15] angel said and then the third poll came
[38:16] later so he's going to spend the next 13
[38:19] or so years pastoring shepherding the
[38:22] little flock we'd call it by God's grace
[38:25] can I zoom in there no I okay I thought
[38:28] I could zoom in I can do it on my other
[38:30] one but just look he's hugging his Bible
[38:33] I don't know who that is but look
[38:34] they're hugging the Bible these are all
[38:36] Saints the and some of these people were
[38:38] there at the Ohio river that we where I
[38:40] baptized Jose he want to be re-baptized
[38:42] at the Ohio River 2017 brother I saw it
[38:44] on my I was going through the old
[38:45] pictures yesterday brother Jose just
[38:47] said I want to be re-baptized where
[38:49] brother BR baptized where the pillar of
[38:50] fire came now I said yes sir I'll do
[38:51] that I cut my foot on some piece of
[38:53] glass though but I I didn't get any
[38:55] infection by God's grace
[38:58] that's a beautiful day so a lot of these
[39:00] people came out of that Revival when the
[39:03] Holy Spirit came down and was visible
[39:06] there and uh it said as John the Baptist
[39:09] was sent to forun the first coming of
[39:11] Christ so your message will forerun the
[39:13] second coming of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[39:17] and these are some of the faithful
[39:18] Saints of course that could misw work
[39:19] you know I don't know when they had the
[39:21] day but do you remember also the story
[39:23] too brother baham said his wife hope
[39:24] this is before he's even married he was
[39:26] a pastor before he was even married
[39:27] married the Bible said a pastor should
[39:29] be married though and have
[39:30] children so we preached on that a little
[39:32] bit by God's grace I was telling that
[39:33] brother Simon brother Simon is aware of
[39:35] that but see this is before that and
[39:37] remember Sister hope uh even after they
[39:40] got married they would walk around and
[39:41] they would pass out little tracks to see
[39:43] if you want to donate to the building of
[39:45] their
[39:45] church now I I don't think I'd go that
[39:48] far in fact I've never done that I've
[39:50] never asked anybody uh there's one time
[39:52] a brother in church here I think it's
[39:53] brother Adam yeah he want to do a uh he
[39:56] want to do a building fund so we started
[39:57] a building
[39:59] fund and uh I think maybe got a couple
[40:01] hundred do in there over the course of a
[40:02] couple years and then when they left and
[40:04] I asked him he said oh just donate it
[40:05] back to the church if I'm not mistaken
[40:06] so you know some people if they have a
[40:09] desire to build God will send it if if
[40:11] they want to build by God's grace if
[40:13] God's in it God's going to send it by
[40:15] the grace of God I appreciate people
[40:16] that want to build a house for the Lord
[40:18] but it's got to be at the right time and
[40:19] season
[40:20] Hallelujah and this is the time they had
[40:22] it uh by God's grace they had the right
[40:24] time and season there to start building
[40:26] that uh the the original Tabernacle the
[40:28] one I showed you at the
[40:29] beginning Hallelujah so after brother R
[40:32] talks about the lies there at the pond
[40:35] he says may this house long stand may it
[40:37] be fully dedicated to God the Tabernacle
[40:40] itself was dedicated in 1933 but
[40:43] thinking this morning it'd be very good
[40:44] thing a small service of dedication
[40:46] again and especially to the people who
[40:49] with their love and Devotion to Christ
[40:51] has made this all
[40:53] possible so brother wants to thank all
[40:56] the people that worked hard to renovate
[40:59] the Tabernacle and bring it to the place
[41:02] where it was there in March of
[41:05] 1963 brother am again says I'm greatly
[41:08] appreciative to the congregation to
[41:10] speak these words in behalf of our good
[41:11] Brethren here who dedicated their
[41:13] services brother Banks Woods our Noble
[41:16] brother Roy Roberson many others with
[41:19] unselfishness and singleness of heart
[41:21] has put months in constructing this
[41:23] place to the way it's been stayed here
[41:25] to see that it was built just right
[41:27] so brother Bram thanked the people that
[41:30] had put their efforts into building the
[41:32] renovated brandham Tabernacle and don't
[41:35] you know God keeps track of that as well
[41:38] I believe God will bless brother Adam
[41:39] for wanting to have a a a building
[41:43] fund but God's also going to bless those
[41:45] people who actually partake in building
[41:47] the church how many remember Moses built
[41:50] a
[41:51] tabernacle remember some of the names in
[41:53] there God wrote down their names so we
[41:55] would remember God's Gonna bless those
[41:56] people how many remember
[41:59] bezel a holab was those were the two
[42:01] main Builders of Moses's Tabernacle and
[42:04] God records their names oh Church May
[42:07] our names be recorded in the Lamb's Book
[42:09] of Life for what we've done for this
[42:10] church hallelujah or whatever church God
[42:13] started you out whatever Church God's
[42:14] going to call you for in other words do
[42:16] something for the church help the church
[42:18] because God sees what you're doing
[42:20] Hallelujah so brother Banks and brother
[42:23] Roberson they had the ability they were
[42:25] construction workers they had the
[42:26] ability uh to hire the right men find
[42:29] the right men they were Trustees of the
[42:30] church and they had the right men that
[42:33] were in the right position to make the
[42:34] renovation the best it could possibly
[42:38] be in the days of Solomon hyim of Ty
[42:42] Tyrie and then the king of Tyrie was
[42:45] also named hyam so two men by the name
[42:46] of hyam helped Moses build uh I'm sorry
[42:49] helped Solomon build his Temple uh
[42:52] here's the one Aden Iram was also uh one
[42:56] of the main men skilled Artisans and
[42:59] stone cutters in other words God
[43:01] remembers everyone who invested any
[43:04] little effort into the kingdom of God
[43:06] into the house of God and it's very
[43:08] beautiful brother is mentioning names
[43:10] just like Moses mentioned name just like
[43:12] Salomon mentioned names God sees all
[43:15] those who want to benefit the house of
[43:16] God hallelujah and church what's
[43:18] beautiful about Moses and Solomon and
[43:20] even Bram Tabernacle
[43:22] here all these efforts of these men
[43:25] allowed the Holy Ghost to fall in the
[43:29] services did you understand that all
[43:32] these men worked for months it was yeah
[43:33] it was nine months Cam's preached out
[43:34] here numerous times Moses had to Moses
[43:36] labored nine months to get the
[43:38] Tabernacle and that types Jesus is the
[43:40] Tabernacle of God how long does a baby
[43:42] uh grow in the womb nine months so
[43:44] Moses's Tabernacle took nine months just
[43:46] like the birth of our Lord amen
[43:49] hallelujah after nine months it was
[43:52] finished and then remember the Holy
[43:54] Ghost fell and Moses and Aaron were
[43:56] outside just glorifying God the same
[43:58] thing happened I think it was seven
[43:59] years Solomon built his Tabernacle or
[44:01] Temple and what happened at the end the
[44:04] Holy Ghost fell but Church don't forget
[44:06] what also has to happen the blood had to
[44:08] be applied to every part of the
[44:10] Tabernacle Aaron had to sprinkle blood
[44:13] on everything in the outer Court
[44:14] everything in the Holy Place everything
[44:16] in the holiest of holies the blood had
[44:18] to be applied to the entire church and
[44:20] then the fire fell Hallelujah God help
[44:22] us to have the blood applied to every
[44:24] part of our Lives amen and then the fire
[44:26] can fall here praise God it does fall
[44:29] here like I told you even last two
[44:31] Wednesday nights ago I was I felt like
[44:33] God's spirit just poured out on me at
[44:34] the end of service I was so refreshed I
[44:36] got to give God a sacrifice of praise
[44:38] I'm weeping praising God I didn't care
[44:40] who is watching I enjoy the freedom and
[44:42] liberty of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I
[44:44] love those moments where God will pour
[44:46] out a special blessing on you and God
[44:47] will vindicate that was that sacrifice
[44:49] was accepted Heaven accepted the
[44:51] sacrifice all the preparation all the
[44:54] work God sees it God will bless it and
[44:57] and then God will vindicate it
[44:58] hallelujah
[45:00] amen like we have these different
[45:02] Brothers come in here brother Simon
[45:03] brother uh Brian when I see their
[45:06] sermons come along and discern
[45:08] situations Hallelujah then I know God
[45:11] has received our sacrifice Hallelujah
[45:13] that's right when I see people get in
[45:14] the prayer line oh thank God God has
[45:16] Vindicated the word of God all the labor
[45:18] every service is important praise
[45:21] God every effort every effort you give
[45:25] God will honor it but the blood had to
[45:28] be applied to every part of the
[45:31] structure whether it was Tabernacle or
[45:33] whether it was Temple brother man then
[45:35] says brother wood Bank Woods made a uh
[45:39] he made a Pulpit the one he'd always
[45:41] wanted I'm going to show it to you a
[45:42] little bit here then brother says
[45:44] there's no way there's no words to
[45:46] express my feeling about the new
[45:47] Tabernacle there's just no way to do it
[45:50] but God understands May each of you be
[45:52] rewarded for your contributions and all
[45:55] that you have done to make this place
[45:57] what it is in the way of a building a
[45:59] house of the
[46:00] Lord and then he says I like to say
[46:02] these words the building as beautiful as
[46:05] it is inside and
[46:07] out he says I don't see how it could
[46:09] have been any better than what it is a
[46:11] perfect
[46:13] job then brother B even talks about the
[46:15] sound
[46:16] system but noticing even in a flat
[46:19] building like this there's no rebound to
[46:20] the accoustics they're in the ceiling
[46:22] different ways no matter where I stand
[46:23] it's just the same every room is
[46:25] constructed that the speakers are in
[46:27] them and you can make it any way you
[46:29] wish to hear I believe it was the hand
[46:31] of almighty God who did these things how
[46:34] many believe that brother man's talking
[46:36] about how you could go in the nursery
[46:37] and you could move uh the volume so the
[46:40] women the sisters with children could
[46:42] still hear the sermon brother Ram said
[46:44] God Almighty did that who set up ours it
[46:47] was mostly brother Vang right I didn't
[46:49] do it so brother brother in other words
[46:51] God hope hopefully he's watching or on
[46:54] the archive God anointed brother V to
[46:57] run the wies so everybody could hear the
[46:59] word of God no matter where you are
[47:01] Hallelujah God did that I still like to
[47:04] do something too if brother van listen
[47:06] just because I I don't think of it I
[47:08] don't think of it till I'm actually
[47:09] preaching but it would be nice at some
[47:10] point to do some Bluetooth where we
[47:12] could have speakers even in the
[47:13] bathrooms just real light where people
[47:15] could still hear the worship still hear
[47:17] the sermons remember at Lima well nobody
[47:19] remember here yeah no one remember here
[47:21] just brother brother Vang and my wife
[47:24] but even in Lima where I first got
[47:25] ordained and uh we first made our home
[47:27] Church even in the bathrooms you could
[47:29] still hear the sermon I really like that
[47:31] because then you don't feel like tempted
[47:32] to get on your phone or tempted to think
[47:34] about other things I like that so maybe
[47:37] that's something we can do for
[47:39] 2025 but it was almighty God who did all
[47:42] these things think about that brother
[47:43] man said it was almighty God that gave
[47:44] us this Pulpit it was almighty God so
[47:46] the sisters can hear the preaching in uh
[47:50] in in the nursery Church don't you know
[47:52] it's almighty God whenever you want to
[47:53] do something for somebody that's God
[47:55] leading you to do it praise God amen CU
[47:57] it's not an act of selfishness it's an
[47:59] act of service and that's why we're here
[48:01] to serve other people praise God
[48:04] hallelujah that that's what we should
[48:05] look Lord how can I be of a better
[48:07] service to your
[48:08] kingdom how can I serve your people
[48:11] better how can I be a better servant
[48:13] because Lord I know you're watching all
[48:14] my uh all my actions I want to use all
[48:17] my gifts for the kingdom of God
[48:21] hallelujah I'm almost ready for that
[48:23] video but let me read
[48:25] this now he said we started off on a mud
[48:28] floor sawdust here by old coal
[48:33] stoves now my dad and mom when I first
[48:35] was born my first house I lived in
[48:37] hogate we had a wood stove and I
[48:39] remember my dad cutting the wood and
[48:41] putting it in there but they had old
[48:43] coal stoves back in 1933 and a mud floor
[48:47] think think about how we how blessed we
[48:49] are church I've never been in a mud
[48:51] floor church every church I've ever even
[48:52] in South America they all had concrete
[48:55] on them by that time they'd all had
[48:56] concrete on
[48:57] look how humble this started dirt floors
[49:01] worshiping
[49:05] Hallelujah and then he says
[49:08] uh he said when they were fixing the
[49:11] Bram Tabernacle they had to add uh they
[49:14] had to add some Rafters they said he
[49:17] said those old stoves used to set on
[49:19] those Rafters that went across and they
[49:21] caught fire and it burned back maybe two
[49:23] or three feet why it didn't burn down
[49:25] only God had kept it so you ever see go
[49:27] in your garage remember in our garage
[49:28] maai the rafters up there so the Bram
[49:30] Tabernacle had a a stove and it was so
[49:33] hot it set the wood on fire but it had
[49:35] only partially burned the rafters that
[49:38] were holding up the building and brother
[49:40] R said these people wondered how did
[49:41] this place not burn down and brother Ram
[49:45] said God kept it up
[49:50] Hallelujah and then after burning off
[49:52] all the weight of the Tabernacle laying
[49:54] there why did it not fall in only the
[49:56] hand of God so brother B recognizes our
[49:59] start was so humble but yet God wouldn't
[50:02] let it fail oh that ought to be an
[50:03] encouragement to us no matter how hard
[50:05] your struggle is no matter how humble it
[50:06] starts God if he if God's in it God will
[50:09] not let you fail Hallelujah I can't fail
[50:12] no more than God can fail because God's
[50:14] inside of me Hallelujah God's guiding me
[50:16] he's leading me praise
[50:18] God you know when we did we we renovated
[50:21] our house in 2018 it was the same the
[50:23] same year I was looking through our
[50:24] pictures when we went to Bram Tabernacle
[50:26] we we hired an electrician named Tom
[50:28] Shumway and I remember he said well we
[50:31] got to we got to run some new electric
[50:32] wires I remember he went up there he
[50:33] caught up in our ceiling he come down he
[50:35] said Jesse he said I hate to tell you
[50:37] this but your house should have burnt
[50:38] down many times because the wiring the
[50:41] electric wiring in your house was with
[50:43] extension
[50:44] cords think about that the heater the
[50:47] air conditioner the appliances the
[50:50] dishwasher the stove everything was
[50:52] running on extension cords he said the
[50:55] guy who wired this was only using using
[50:56] extension cords your house should have
[50:58] burnt down I said it's only God's grace
[51:02] that kept us alive I had Sons and
[51:04] Daughters of God in the house so it
[51:05] couldn't burn down amen and we had we
[51:08] had numerous problems with electricity
[51:09] before it was totally replaced so I can
[51:12] say the same thing who kept us Malachi
[51:14] and L's not here in when they were
[51:15] little babies who kept us almighty God
[51:18] kept us from burning down praise God it
[51:20] was God With Us God's in us hallelujah
[51:22] God's for us hallelujah no man can be
[51:24] against us if God is for us
[51:31] Hallelujah brother man said I pray that
[51:34] this will just not only be a beautiful

[51:49] worship for no matter how beautiful the
[51:52] structure is that we certainly do
[51:54] appreciate the beauty of the church is
[51:56] the character of the people I trust
[51:58] it'll always be a house of God of
[52:02] beauty so let's go through the video now
[52:04] hopefully I can do this without messing
[52:05] it up here okay eyes get real big am I
[52:09] gonna mess it up let's

[52:25] now this is of course before uh we went
[52:28] to the BR Tabernacle that's shi's C sh
[52:30] shi's candy store those are Red Hots
[52:32] brother Bram loved Red Hots and Red Hots
[52:34] were part of the third poll that's why
[52:35] we took a picture of it uh the owner of
[52:38] this his name is sunny Shimp he was
[52:39] dying of cancer and uh brother and they
[52:42] have a testimony hanging up on the wall
[52:44] you can see it he was dying and brother
[52:46] BR walked in there and he saw a vision
[52:47] he said thus sayith the Lord he said
[52:50] God's going to heal you they thought he
[52:51] was going to die he said but you'll
[52:53] again sell me Red Hots
[52:56] what a thus sayith the Lord and after he
[52:59] got well and everything brother R kind
[53:00] of snuck in there he'd say I like some
[53:02] Red Hots and he said oh yeah the kids
[53:04] love them he looked up and he said oh
[53:05] brother brandom and he says look thus
[53:07] sayith the Lord is now
[53:09] fulfilled that's how accurate the
[53:11] Visions
[53:13] were so that's why brother William is
[53:15] smiling this is a part of a vision and
[53:18] they're still making Red Hots to this
[53:20] day all
[53:22] right now that that's Shimp you can see
[53:24] shimps in the back shimps candy store
[53:28] there's brother Bam's uh grave there
[53:30] God's grace the pyramid shape there's a
[53:32] handsome guy right
[53:35] there now there there it is there's
[53:37] there's the
[53:40] Cornerstone dedicated 1933 Bram
[53:44] Tabernacle and I loved it even when we
[53:46] remember we announced we're going uh
[53:48] remember brother William's like make
[53:49] sure you dress
[53:51] up I love that they just see it's a
[53:53] sacred Place think about that for all
[53:55] these 60 some years he's heard brother
[53:57] BR he's heard about the brand Tabernacle
[53:59] he's heard it but now he can say I've
[54:00] heard about it but now I've seen it
[54:03] Hallelujah I've seen a sacred place
[54:05] where God met his Prophet hallelujah oh
[54:08] I love it amen I love
[54:14] it yeah there's Jose there's the eagle
[54:17] oh and the sword sorry I got to skip
[54:21] ahead all three of us
[54:23] there the sword of the king brother had
[54:25] that now that's a wag wheel that was
[54:27] part of brother Ram's dream brother Ram
[54:29] said he saw a his family was in a wheel
[54:32] his family was in a carriage and the
[54:34] Wagon Wheel broke he said that' be a
[54:36] sign for you to go out west so brother
[54:38] Ram always kept that and this is
[54:40] Joseph's house Joseph bram's current
[54:41] house in well as far as I know um they
[54:44] got it gated off because they get so
[54:45] many visitors there to they try to
[54:47] discourage people but that
[54:50] uh uh that reminded brother brandom of
[54:53] the vision to go out to Arizona so he
[54:54] can meet the seven angels and then
[54:56] preach the revelation of the Seven Seals
[54:58] that old broken Wagon Wheel by God's
[55:01] grace yeah there's brother R's house and
[55:04] then the Wagon Wheel oh now it's
[55:06] Joseph's okay now that's important
[55:08] because that's the middle school where
[55:09] brother Brandon preached um marriage and
[55:12] divorce just this humble little middle
[55:14] school and that that's where he said
[55:15] thus sayi the Lord on marriage and
[55:16] divorce there's only one way to divorce
[55:19] and remarriage that's unconfessed
[55:20] fornication on behalf of the woman right
[55:24] given thus sayith the Lord right there
[55:25] at that location
[55:27] these are these are special places now
[55:28] we didn't go in we just took it outside
[55:30] uh by God's
[55:32] grace okay now I just want to show this
[55:34] because this is what the next part when
[55:36] you walk like I said when you walk right
[55:37] in the front doors they have two signs
[55:39] enter into the house of the Lord
[55:41] reverently in prayer and
[55:44] meditation so see when you walk church
[55:46] when you walk into those doors you
[55:47] should get in here to pray you should
[55:50] get in here to read your Bible I tell my
[55:53] little girls to yeah flip to the page
[55:55] you want to take notes on but don't flip
[55:57] so many pages just get right to the page
[55:59] because people are here to pray and
[56:02] meditate on the things of God don't
[56:04] whisper to your neighbor because we're
[56:06] trying to pray
[56:08] hallelujah we're trying to be reverent
[56:10] uh we want to meditate on the things of
[56:12] God we want to talk to God lord I need

[56:27] and then the mothers with babies only Z
[56:29] to two years old that's the mother's
[56:31] room there here's another one so they
[56:32] have two they have two signs please do
[56:34] not talk be reverent pray study or
[56:38] meditate so they have two signs just Med
[56:41] this is your time to hear from God
[56:44] that's why I tell my girls and all the
[56:45] young girls too you know when you come
[56:47] in here it's time to talk to God don't
[56:49] worry about everything else pray
[56:51] meditate on the things of God this is
[56:53] where God meets with us praise God
[56:56] hallelujah it's not a time to talk it's
[56:58] not a time to now afterwards brother Ram
[57:00] would tell greet the people shake their
[57:01] hand but later brother Ram say if you
[57:03] want to have a conversation walk out
[57:04] there he said talk anything you want in
[57:06] the parking lot as long as it's holy and
[57:08] good sometimes I'll tell the brothers
[57:10] hey let's go in my office let's talk in
[57:12] there by God's
[57:13] grace those are all hanging up right
[57:15] there when in Bram Tabernacle when you
[57:16] walk
[57:17] in now look at that look at that picture
[57:19] of Jesus brother had that hanging up in
[57:21] there all those years look how long the
[57:23] hair is on Jesus and the man there he
[57:25] told us a Catholic gave this to brother
[57:27] brandom a Catholic person they wanted to
[57:30] donate to brother bram's church and
[57:32] brother BR said okay I'll take that it's
[57:33] still hanging up
[57:35] today Hallelujah and we don't know how
[57:37] long Jesus's hair
[57:40] was but that's the picture has been
[57:42] hanging there for many many
[57:45] years right when you walk
[57:48] in okay now that's when you go to the
[57:51] left side so if you walk in on the left
[57:52] side there's actually three rows like
[57:54] this there's one row two row rows three
[57:56] rows right there is a pillar of fire
[57:58] picture Houston 1950 you got the Lord
[58:01] Jesus Hoffman's head there above it you
[58:03] have be still know that I'm God and
[58:05] there's brother Ram's uh Pulpit there
[58:06] that's the piano you have chairs and
[58:08] back there for the ministry so that
[58:09] that's all it is is so like in here we
[58:11] have one row right where one set of
[58:12] chairs there at brandom Tabernacle you
[58:14] got three sets one two
[58:21] three okay so there's a little closer
[58:23] view there you can see oh yeah on the
[58:25] other side is a picture let me go back
[58:26] there on the other side is a picture of
[58:27] brother brand I think I it's on here
[58:31] later okay so there's a picture just a
[58:33] painting of brother brandom uh right
[58:35] there's the uh seven Church agents we'll
[58:37] show that in a little bit there that's
[58:39] really all they got they don't have a
[58:40] lot in
[58:41] there is that brother William praying I
[58:43] think that's brother William praying
[58:45] right there about
[58:49] God okay so we're walking up to the
[58:50] pulpit
[58:52] there it was a prayer meeting they only
[58:54] do a onour prayer meeting now and it has
[58:56] to be absolutely silent there's a
[58:57] crucifix you saw that there's two
[58:59] crucifixes of the Lord Jesus Christ on
[59:01] both those pillars now this is the uh uh
[59:04] the feet washing room but it was
[59:06] actually overflow back in 201 uh 18
[59:09] they'd have so many people come there to
[59:10] set people here but this is actually the
[59:12] feet washing
[59:14] room normally the feet washing room for
[59:16] the Sisters I think yeah
[59:19] sisters and then there's a communion
[59:24] room and they did because they had so
[59:27] many people brother R said they used to
[59:28] do one cup like we do one cup because we
[59:29] have a small Church uh but if anybody's
[59:31] sick remember we'll go to individual
[59:33] cups but they had so many people it took
[59:35] so long they moved to doing individual
[59:37] cups for
[59:42] communion we got towels and everything
[59:44] over for water baptism as well
[1:00:00] off that's the plate for the bread let
[1:00:02] me skip ah head here so there's the wine
[1:00:05] okay now right behind this is the water
[1:00:09] baptismal it's directly behind the
[1:00:11] pulpit this got to pull away the curtain
[1:00:13] and then there's the baptism that's
[1:00:15] where brother Loris was
[1:00:16] baptized Lis was baptized there by
[1:00:19] Brother Willard Collins he was the
[1:00:20] pastor after brother Brenham I'm sorry
[1:00:22] after Orman Neville passed away
[1:00:28] just a humble little baptismal
[1:00:41] there all right this room I think was
[1:00:44] the brother's room yeah this brother's
[1:00:46] room to prepare for water
[1:00:48] baptism we got to exit there brother
[1:00:51] could get out the
[1:00:53] back towels for water baptism
[1:01:05] he was telling a story okay now then the
[1:01:06] last thing is brother bram's
[1:01:10] office just look at how humble his desk
[1:01:12] is here and his uh his office is just so
[1:01:15] so
[1:01:21] humble there's that painting remember a
[1:01:24] brother named Stephie painted that and
[1:01:25] brother said I wish I had the money he
[1:01:27] said you're such a good artist I'd send
[1:01:29] you to college so you could really
[1:01:30] develop your your painting skills that
[1:01:33] was in 1964 if you want to look look
[1:01:35] that up so people that say brother Ram
[1:01:36] is against education they just don't
[1:01:38] know all the quotes right they're just
[1:01:40] being critical because they probably
[1:01:41] don't have an education which I mean you
[1:01:43] don't have to have an education but God
[1:01:45] can use
[1:01:46] it it's a beautiful poem brother Orman
[1:01:49] Neville read that poem our precious
[1:01:50] brother
[1:01:51] Bill clock Elijah and then that's the
[1:01:54] woods look at brother Ram's desk there
[1:01:57] they they try to keep it in the same
[1:01:58] order it
[1:02:01] was uh some statues
[1:02:05] Bibles
[1:02:16] chairs you know what I got I'll just say
[1:02:18] like this I got criticized even this
[1:02:19] morning on a YouTube comment like why do
[1:02:20] you talk about brother Ram so much if
[1:02:22] you lived in the days of Moses wouldn't
[1:02:24] you talk about Moses
[1:02:26] if Moses brought you out of the Red Sea
[1:02:29] wouldn't you remember Moses a little bit
[1:02:32] brother BR brought me out of
[1:02:34] denominationalism church he brought me
[1:02:36] out of the blindness of thinking it's
[1:02:38] okay to get drunk and women preachers
[1:02:39] okay and crossdressing is okay women
[1:02:42] cutting hairs he brought me out of this
[1:02:44] bondage of Egyptian
[1:02:46] bondage so people just they're they're
[1:02:48] just man said the human mind just wants
[1:02:50] to
[1:02:52] criticize but I want to show it to the
[1:02:54] young people just see how humble look
[1:02:55] there's wood wood you know Wood Walls
[1:02:56] just a very humble beautiful sacred
[1:02:59] place so yeah there's his a desk now if
[1:03:01] you don't if you got a desk just real
[1:03:03] small look there's just six drawers or
[1:03:04] seven I'm sorry three three one just a
[1:03:07] small little little you a tissue box and
[1:03:09] of course Joseph put that in the phone
[1:03:11] water because Joseph would study here
[1:03:12] too he had his Bible always laying open
[1:03:14] on his desk just a lamp just a real look
[1:03:16] at this chair simple chair this is how a
[1:03:19] prophet of God was set up his church and
[1:03:21] he said this is one of the most
[1:03:22] beautiful churches in all America he
[1:03:24] says see why cuz it was it was home for
[1:03:27] him the people had dedicated their lives
[1:03:30] to supporting this this ministry so that
[1:03:32] the word of God could be preached he
[1:03:34] said from here came forth the word of
[1:03:36] God
[1:03:38] Amen just so
[1:03:41] simple yeah honor to yeah so it's on
[1:03:43] tape in 1964 if you want to hear that
[1:03:45] poem there's oh yeah there's that
[1:03:47] beautiful uh do I have this scope I
[1:03:49] don't think this is the dedication one
[1:03:51] no I got it at
[1:03:52] home well that's the letter I showed you
[1:03:54] where brother Ram wrote his he said dear
[1:03:56] God and he writes his letter of
[1:03:57] dedication he said may I preach this
[1:03:59] word and may I make it real to this
[1:04:01] generation uh he said
[1:04:04] uh his unworthy
[1:04:07] servant so again beautiful prayer of
[1:04:09] dedication there brother B
[1:04:15] gave okay so now we're leaving the study
[1:04:17] back out in the sanctuary there's the
[1:04:18] organ I'm not
[1:04:23] mistaken few seats there
[1:04:27] there's yeah there's a crucifix on both
[1:04:28] of the pillars there up at the
[1:04:36] platform The
[1:04:38] Altar and there's the there's the pulpit
[1:04:41] he always
[1:04:50] wanted another picture of the two
[1:04:52] crucifix there the Lord Jesus
[1:05:03] here's the Hoffman's
[1:05:17] head brother Jose you still know that
[1:05:20] I'm God
[1:05:26] brother
[1:05:33] will okay now that this is important too
[1:05:36] originally the word Elijah brother Bram
[1:05:38] said put Elijah under that seventh star
[1:05:40] and it's on tape you can hear I think
[1:05:41] it's
[1:05:43] 1962 right after he preached the church
[1:05:45] ages he said but somebody come by he
[1:05:48] even names the brother he said he said
[1:05:49] brother he said don't put my name there
[1:05:51] he said I have nothing to do with that
[1:05:53] look how humble brother R was and later
[1:05:56] we know that was he was the seventh
[1:05:57] Church age messenger but this is hanging
[1:06:00] up as well the seven Church ages but
[1:06:02] originally he wanted Elijah under there
[1:06:04] not his name but we know we can put it
[1:06:06] we can put brother bram's name in there
[1:06:08] of
[1:06:10] course and there's a painting of brother
[1:06:14] Brandon ping of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:06:18] Hallelujah now that's important because
[1:06:20] that's that's uh that's the do doors and
[1:06:23] windows of the woman's Nursery the S the
[1:06:25] mother's nurs
[1:06:26] and this is where the pillar of fire
[1:06:27] appeared and made those uh seven circles
[1:06:30] with the shadows and lights right here
[1:06:32] is where it appeared said it right here
[1:06:34] that was in uh 1961 yes June of 1961
[1:06:38] right after he finished preaching the
[1:06:39] seven Church
[1:06:41] ages of course now was probably it was
[1:06:43] the same area but now the church had
[1:06:44] expanded that way in 1963 but that's
[1:06:47] where the Holy Ghost that's that's why I
[1:06:48] made I made sure I take a picture that's
[1:06:50] on tape too you can listen to that on
[1:06:51] tape I played it here before the church
[1:06:52] people are screaming crying they're
[1:06:54] shouting Pillar of Fire showed up right
[1:06:56] there in seven circles it's on tape
[1:07:00] hallelujah what what do the Bible say
[1:07:02] we're not following cunningly devised
[1:07:04] wives fables Hallelujah God has visited
[1:07:07] this generation Hallelujah that's right
[1:07:11] church that's right and we know because
[1:07:13] it lines up with the word of God praise
[1:07:15] God is that the end that's the end okay
[1:07:18] all
[1:07:20] right so I think that's my
[1:07:24] last all right so let me bring this down
[1:07:26] to a close here by God's grace how many
[1:07:28] enjoying this so far I thought it'd be a
[1:07:30] little different you get to see the Bram
[1:07:31] Tabernacle if you haven't been there
[1:07:33] look what brother Ram saying about it
[1:07:34] but then he says as beautiful as this is
[1:07:37] what's important is the beauty of the
[1:07:38] character of the people
[1:07:42] hallelujah so I want to give me a few
[1:07:44] more minutes here we'll close up by
[1:07:45] God's
[1:07:51] grace now brother Bram says I'm going to
[1:07:53] pick up he says now in the dedication
[1:07:55] service of the original Cornerstone
[1:07:56] being laid a great vision came he says
[1:08:00] and remember brother had multiple
[1:08:02] Visions on that morning not long ago I
[1:08:04] preached to you I I went over the seven
[1:08:05] major Visions again remember that that's
[1:08:07] a vision brother Ram had on that June
[1:08:09] morning 1933 the morning of the
[1:08:12] dedication The Voice also said um
[1:08:15] remember 2 Timothy 4 so let's go there 2
[1:08:18] Timothy
[1:08:20] 4 and this was extremely prophetic
[1:08:27] it was he the holy spirit said write
[1:08:29] down verses 1-7 I charge thee therefore
[1:08:31] before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:08:33] shall judge the quick and the dead at
[1:08:35] his appearing and his kingdom preach the
[1:08:37] word be instant in season out of season
[1:08:40] reprove rebuke exhort with all
[1:08:42] longsuffering and
[1:08:46] Doctrine see Paul is giving a charge to
[1:08:49] the young Pastor Timothy preach the word
[1:08:52] because God will judge you by what you
[1:08:54] preached how many believe preaching is
[1:08:57] important it's what we're judged by I'm
[1:08:59] going to be judged by what I preach
[1:09:01] hallelujah thank God we got the word of
[1:09:03] God verse three for the time will come
[1:09:05] when they will not endure sound Doctrine
[1:09:07] now look at the brandom Tabernacle today
[1:09:09] the time had come 25 well I would say by
[1:09:12] I think it was 19 I can't remember the
[1:09:14] date it's I'll look on the website but
[1:09:16] it was in the late 1960s or early 1970
[1:09:18] 70s they uh adopted the wrong pastor and
[1:09:22] this pastor didn't preach as much he
[1:09:23] started playing tapes only and that's
[1:09:26] that was their first step on the way
[1:09:27] outside of the bible message when they
[1:09:30] got a pastor that he would just teach a
[1:09:32] a maybe an hourong Sunday school he
[1:09:34] would sit down he would press play and
[1:09:36] just let the church sit there and listen
[1:09:37] to a machine brother abam said machines
[1:09:39] weren't ordained to preach the gospel he
[1:09:41] said men were called to preach the
[1:09:43] gospel
[1:09:45] Hallelujah but look the Holy Spirit told
[1:09:47] him there will come a time when they
[1:09:49] won't endure sound Doctrine you won't be
[1:09:51] able to teach them simple things out of
[1:09:53] the
[1:09:54] Bible Hallelujah but after their own
[1:09:57] lust shall they Heap to themselves
[1:09:59] teachers having itching
[1:10:01] ears why do people not want a pastor
[1:10:04] today so they have nobody to tell them
[1:10:06] that they're wrong right see because the
[1:10:10] people don't want a pastor so they can
[1:10:11] just itch their ears and they can just
[1:10:13] have a a tape or whatever they want so
[1:10:15] no so that they don't have any uh they
[1:10:18] don't have any
[1:10:19] correction right they don't want to be
[1:10:21] corrected they just want to live how
[1:10:23] they want to live but God said I'm
[1:10:25] charging preachers to preach the word
[1:10:27] tell them the truth hallelujah amen
[1:10:31] that's right look at verse four they
[1:10:32] shall turn away their ears from the
[1:10:34] truth and shall be turned unto fables
[1:10:36] they'll believe fables old wives tales
[1:10:38] instead of the
[1:10:40] word preacher he says verse five Timothy
[1:10:43] the pastor but watch thou in all things
[1:10:45] endure afflictions do the work of
[1:10:47] evangelists make full proof of thy
[1:10:49] Ministry that's interesting he was
[1:10:51] called also to evangelism I've been
[1:10:53] teaching on the fivefold ministry also
[1:10:55] on line and remember even Paul told
[1:10:57] Timothy he said a pastor must be apt to
[1:10:59] teach how many remember that scripture 1
[1:11:02] Timothy 3 so a pastor has to have a gift
[1:11:04] of a pastor to preach but also teach the
[1:11:06] word of God so here Timothy shows
[1:11:08] Timothy has more than one gift he has a
[1:11:10] pastoral gift and he has an Evangelistic
[1:11:13] gift now remember there has to be
[1:11:15] separate times for that though right if
[1:11:17] a pastor is going to leave a church and
[1:11:19] evangelize it either can't be for a very
[1:11:21] long time or he's got to let uh somebody
[1:11:23] else he's got to put another Pastor in
[1:11:24] charge while he's gone
[1:11:30] Hallelujah Glory verse six for I'm now
[1:11:33] ready to be offered and the time of my
[1:11:34] departure is at hand I fought a good
[1:11:36] fight I finished my course I have kept
[1:11:38] the faith
[1:11:40] Hallelujah so surely the Holy Spirit
[1:11:42] told Brother Bram write this put it in
[1:11:44] the Cornerstone of the brandham
[1:11:46] Tabernacle but we know brandham
[1:11:48] Tabernacle is not kept sound Doctrine 24
[1:11:51] plus lies but we got to make sure we
[1:11:52] don't believe
[1:11:53] lies we're not responsible for brandom
[1:11:56] Tabernacle we're responsible for bride
[1:11:57] of Christ
[1:11:58] Fellowship responsible to be lies in the
[1:12:02] church brother manam said many of you
[1:12:04] might have wondered a few minutes ago
[1:12:05] why I was so long coming out this
[1:12:07] morning to preach my first Duty as I
[1:12:09] come into the new church I married a
[1:12:11] young man and woman standing in my
[1:12:12] office that office we just saw with the
[1:12:15] the study desk may it be a type that
[1:12:18] I'll be a loyal minister to Christ to
[1:12:19] get a bride ready for the ceremony of
[1:12:22] that day I loved how brother R tried to
[1:12:24] see typ and shadows in his life and
[1:12:27] church remember in 1965 I think it's the
[1:12:29] message of shamed brother said I'm out
[1:12:30] here in Arizona he said uh I feel like I
[1:12:33] wasted five years of my life he said God
[1:12:35] have I done something wrong remember in
[1:12:37] M church he said I'm just going to open
[1:12:39] my bible Lord and you I'm going to point
[1:12:40] to something and you just show me uh
[1:12:42] show me what my purpose is in this life
[1:12:44] remember what he did Church remember
[1:12:45] what he went to who remembers anybody
[1:12:47] remember Genesis
[1:12:49] 24 he said he pointed Genesis 24 he said
[1:12:52] it was elaser the model servant
[1:12:56] the model servant from Abraham to get a
[1:12:58] bride for Isaac amen hallelujah is
[1:13:02] everybody okay today glory and that's
[1:13:05] what Jesus that's what Jesus here Jesus
[1:13:07] is the type of Isaac Hallelujah and
[1:13:10] brother R's the type of elaser he had to
[1:13:12] go out to Arizona he had to go out and
[1:13:14] continue to evangelize to try to find a
[1:13:16] bride to get the bride ready to go meet
[1:13:18] Isaac the Lord Jesus Christ and that's
[1:13:20] why we're here today praise God because
[1:13:23] brother random went to Lima Ohio I'm
[1:13:25] here
[1:13:26] today Hallelujah people asked me all the
[1:13:29] time how'd you hear the message brother
[1:13:30] Jesse how'd you hear it I went to Lima
[1:13:31] Ohio where brother Ram preach numerous
[1:13:33] sermons in in Lima Ohio Hallelujah and
[1:13:37] then Orman Neville he would go up and
[1:13:38] preach and he they started preaching in
[1:13:40] a little Barn up there in Lima Ohio and
[1:13:42] eventually turned into the church that I
[1:13:44] first got to hear the message in
[1:13:46] hallelujah amen thank
[1:13:48] God so that's why brother Ram was sent
[1:13:50] he was sent as a prophet a messenger
[1:13:53] Hallelujah glory to God a seven Church
[1:13:55] age messenger he was also meant as a
[1:13:57] elaser to prepare the people to marry
[1:14:00] Jesus Christ
[1:14:03] Hallelujah now he says
[1:14:06] this he said now let us do as we did at
[1:14:08] the beginning we started the first
[1:14:10] dedication of the church I was just a
[1:14:11] young man my 21 22 years old when we
[1:14:14] laid the Cornerstone it was before I was
[1:14:16] even married I always wanted to see a
[1:14:18] place correctly in order for God to be
[1:14:20] worshiped see with his people we can
[1:14:23] only do that not by a pretty building
[1:14:25] but by a consecrated life is the only
[1:14:28] way we can do it now I'm going to close
[1:14:31] with this here let's get your Bibles
[1:14:32] ready let's go through some scriptures
[1:14:33] on the house of God 1 Peter 4 you can uh
[1:14:36] actually in case you want to pull those
[1:14:37] up
[1:14:38] there 1 Peter
[1:14:40] 4:17 I'm sorry 17 and
[1:14:44] 18 I want especially our young people to
[1:14:46] see this as well by the grace of
[1:14:52] God so s church we got to make sure we
[1:14:55] constantly renew our attitude toward the
[1:14:57] house of
[1:14:58] God hallelujah remember you'll be judged
[1:15:00] by what you do with this word that I
[1:15:02] preach and all the preachers that
[1:15:03] preached to us will be judged by the
[1:15:05] word of God that we've heard 1 Peter
[1:15:08] 4:17 and 18 for the time has come that
[1:15:11] judgment must begin where at the house
[1:15:13] of God this is where judgment starts
[1:15:15] amen hallelujah am this is where our
[1:15:18] lives are judged in other words is it
[1:15:20] good fruit or is it corrupt fruit it's
[1:15:23] judged right here in the house of God
[1:15:26] and remember Paul told Timothy you'll
[1:15:27] stand before Jesus Christ before the
[1:15:29] quick and the dead you'll stand before
[1:15:31] all the raised that are raised from the
[1:15:32] dead and you'll stand there and you'll
[1:15:33] answer for what you preach out of the
[1:15:35] Bible Hallelujah and church you'll
[1:15:37] answer for what you did with it
[1:15:39] hallelujah amen remember the Bible said
[1:15:41] the Pastor I have to give an account of
[1:15:43] everyone's life that sat under me
[1:15:45] whether it was for good or whether it
[1:15:47] was not for
[1:15:48] good so the Bible says make sure you
[1:15:51] live a life where the pastor can give an
[1:15:53] account of your life with joy
[1:15:55] let's read verse Verse 18 then we'll go
[1:15:57] to that verse in Hebrews 1 or Hebrews 13
[1:16:00] yes and if the unrighteous scarcely be
[1:16:02] saved where shall the ungodly and The
[1:16:04] Sinner appear see there's going to be
[1:16:07] people even in the message that are
[1:16:08] barely saved think of that they're
[1:16:10] barely
[1:16:12] saved those are the ones that going to
[1:16:13] have to die in the tribulation period
[1:16:16] but they're barely going to be saved
[1:16:17] because they live too close to the world
[1:16:19] see we got to be like Abraham Liv so far
[1:16:21] from the world that we don't even see it
[1:16:23] Hallelujah we don't we don't play around
[1:16:25] with the things of the world we don't
[1:16:26] flirt with the world like Samson flirted
[1:16:28] with Delilah we don't flirt with those
[1:16:30] things we only love Jesus Christ
[1:16:32] Hallelujah that's right see judgment
[1:16:36] starts right here in other words your
[1:16:38] attitude toward the word will show what
[1:16:40] your experience is going to be on the
[1:16:41] day of judgment remember the Bible says
[1:16:43] we can have boldness on that day how
[1:16:45] could we be bold on the day of judgment
[1:16:47] because we receive God's word we let
[1:16:49] God's word judge our lives right now
[1:16:51] Hallelujah Hebrews 13
[1:16:54] I think it's verse 17 if I'm not
[1:16:56] mistaken
[1:17:01] honey think about that all those people
[1:17:03] in the days of Moses all those two
[1:17:05] million people that died there around
[1:17:06] two million people they'll all have to
[1:17:08] stand before Moses and Moses will give
[1:17:09] an account of their
[1:17:12] lives verse 17 obey them that have the
[1:17:15] rule over you and submit yourselves for
[1:17:16] they watch for your souls as they that
[1:17:18] must give an account that they may do it
[1:17:20] with joy and not with grief for that is
[1:17:23] unprofitable for you so I'll Stand every
[1:17:26] Pastor will stand in the presence of
[1:17:27] Jesus and have to give an account we're
[1:17:28] either going to give an account with Joy
[1:17:30] or with
[1:17:31] grief so what should we do obey the word
[1:17:33] of
[1:17:34] God and remember this is Jesus Christ
[1:17:37] the same yesterday today and forever go
[1:17:38] to verse 7 Hebrews 13:7 remember them
[1:17:41] which have the rule over you who have
[1:17:42] spoken unto you the word of the Lord
[1:17:43] whose Faith follow considering the end
[1:17:46] of their conversation or their conduct
[1:17:47] what does their life turn out to be
[1:17:49] verse eight Jesus Christ the same
[1:17:51] yesterday today and forever
[1:17:55] so this is God's uh constant uh plea to
[1:17:58] the people follow those that are
[1:18:00] preaching the word of God follow their
[1:18:01] faith hallelujah amen follow their faith
[1:18:04] watch how they live their lives look at
[1:18:06] the end look at the good fruit that
[1:18:07] comes out of their lives follow that
[1:18:09] praise God just like Moses just like all
[1:18:12] the leaders right Joshua amen all these
[1:18:14] Godly men down through the years follow
[1:18:17] their lives hallelujah it's Jesus Christ
[1:18:19] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:18:22] Glory now a few more verses here
[1:18:26] if we could let's go to Psalms yeah
[1:18:28] we'll just go right over to Psalm
[1:18:30] 7713 I Shar this with a brother I can't
[1:18:32] remember who it was but they were asking
[1:18:35] me why do we come to church because in
[1:18:36] church is where you find the way of the
[1:18:38] Lord Jesus said I am the way the truth
[1:18:41] and the life well some people say well
[1:18:42] as long as I have Jesus I know the way
[1:18:44] but there's another verse that says it's
[1:18:46] in the
[1:18:48] sanctuary the people that I see loving
[1:18:50] Jesus Christ the most they're the ones
[1:18:52] that are most dedicated to the house of
[1:18:53] the Lord
[1:18:55] for sure it's not even close not even
[1:18:58] close thy way oh God is in the sanctuary
[1:19:02] who is so great as God a God as our God
[1:19:06] where's God's
[1:19:09] way brother Claude brother Patrick what
[1:19:11] are you g to do after high school what
[1:19:13] way you g to take you're going to find
[1:19:15] it in the
[1:19:16] sanctuary Malachi he's 18 he's going to
[1:19:20] find his way where you going to find
[1:19:21] your way in the sanctuary worshiping
[1:19:23] Jesus
[1:19:25] right like like like we heard Mary lay
[1:19:27] at jesus' feet hear the word of God and
[1:19:30] the word of God is like a lamp unto your
[1:19:32] feet it's a light unto your path is that
[1:19:35] right amen
[1:19:37] hallelujah you know it's I know it's
[1:19:39] Elementary church this is more of a
[1:19:40] beginning but we need it by God's grace
[1:19:43] we need to remind us I was just so
[1:19:44] blessed I listened to this sermon a
[1:19:45] couple times yesterday uh God hiding
[1:19:47] himself I was so blessed I'm like oh
[1:19:49] this a good refresher need to go through
[1:19:50] this I thought it'd be good to show the
[1:19:51] pictures of when we went by God's grace
[1:19:55] w we have so many good memories by the
[1:19:56] grace of the Lord Psalms uh 89:7 Psalms
[1:20:02] 89:7 and see now here's where we get
[1:20:04] this idea brother R say you you young
[1:20:06] people don't talk in those days don't
[1:20:07] pass notes I'll say like this don't text
[1:20:09] in church either right don't text each
[1:20:11] other in church now no one does that
[1:20:12] here
[1:20:13] but in other words don't distract people
[1:20:16] from worshiping we'll get to that maybe
[1:20:17] uh next Sunday by God's grace don't
[1:20:19] distract people from worshiping help
[1:20:21] them
[1:20:22] worship and the best way you can do that
[1:20:24] is medit
[1:20:25] and talk to God for
[1:20:27] yourself we don't want to distract
[1:20:29] people from worship remember people are
[1:20:30] worshiping and praying uh people are
[1:20:32] trying to seek God they got questions
[1:20:34] for their life they might be sick and we
[1:20:36] got to help them to get in the presence
[1:20:37] of God so they can hear the voice of
[1:20:41] God think about think about remember
[1:20:43] Wednesday night brother Jose gave those
[1:20:44] testimonies on how God has recently
[1:20:46] healed him now how could God do that
[1:20:48] because nobody here was grieving the
[1:20:50] Holy
[1:20:51] Spirit but remember if somebody had
[1:20:53] aching type of sin or something like
[1:20:54] like that then maybe God wouldn't have
[1:20:56] healed our brother but I want to
[1:20:58] encourage you stay true to
[1:21:00] God because God would be pleased enough
[1:21:02] to answer his prayer he said while I was
[1:21:04] praying for him the pain left him
[1:21:06] Hallelujah remember that why because God
[1:21:10] was respected in our service we showed
[1:21:12] God respect we showed him our love we
[1:21:15] meditated on him we gave him praise we
[1:21:17] honored him we're trying to hear his
[1:21:20] voice God is greatly to be feared in the
[1:21:22] Assembly of the Saints and to be had
[1:21:24] reverence of all them that are about him
[1:21:27] that's why that's why brother BR had
[1:21:28] those two signs read your Bible pray be
[1:21:32] quiet
[1:21:34] right study meditate please no
[1:21:38] talking
[1:21:40] right that's why we do it by God's
[1:21:42] grace Psalm 96 verse6 here's another one
[1:21:46] too some people say I'm weak some people
[1:21:49] say oh my life is I love how brother
[1:21:51] Brian preach uh I'm damaged goods
[1:21:53] remember he said that about the woman
[1:21:53] with the alabaster box I'm damaged goods
[1:21:55] the world has beat me up or the world
[1:21:57] I've given myself to the world I've I've
[1:21:59] damaged my life but the Bible said here
[1:22:02] honor and Majesty are before him
[1:22:05] strength and beauty are in his sanctuary
[1:22:08] if you need to be strong come to church
[1:22:10] Hallelujah if you need some strength
[1:22:12] come to the sanctuary meditate a little
[1:22:14] bit pray to God talk to God listen to

[1:25:40] give you testimony I just telling my
[1:25:41] wife about a financial need and while
[1:25:43] right after we talked to my wife I think
[1:25:45] it was Friday I got a text from a man
[1:25:47] who's Fallen this year into he was a
[1:25:49] false prophet and he fell into adultery
[1:25:51] it was all over the internet I mentioned
[1:25:53] him a couple weeks ago I preach on it he
[1:25:55] reached out to me and said I want to
[1:25:56] donate to your ministry give me your
[1:25:59] link to your church I said I don't have
[1:26:01] one but my wife noticed it look I was
[1:26:04] just talking about how a financial need
[1:26:05] come up and I could have been I felt
[1:26:07] like I was being tempted of the devil to
[1:26:09] accept offering from a false
[1:26:12] prophet but what did God do I've been
[1:26:14] praying I was in the and oh yeah this
[1:26:16] week I've been reading on I finished uh
[1:26:18] Daniel uh Ezekiel I finished that and I
[1:26:20] started back on Jeremiah and it's all
[1:26:22] about false prophets and Israel getting
[1:26:24] away from God into idolatry and warning
[1:26:26] about false pastors and all these things
[1:26:28] so I had all these things on my mind and
[1:26:31] so it was a Temptation I was just I was
[1:26:33] just telling my wife about a financial
[1:26:34] need and here comes a false prophet can
[1:26:36] I give you some money I said no thanks I
[1:26:38] don't want your money I'm glad we don't

[1:26:43] Temptation I could have said oh we could
[1:26:45] I just I just had that need come
[1:26:48] up
[1:26:50] Hallelujah but see what was it God puts
[1:26:52] our minds on the word of God don't don't

[1:26:56] give them any time you'll know them by
[1:26:59] their fruits Hallelujah you know that's
[1:27:01] what these false prophets do they go
[1:27:03] from one Church they give a financial
[1:27:04] offering and because the wow we got a
[1:27:06] nice offering well then I'll accept him
[1:27:08] in other words they buy your
[1:27:11] friendship you need to love Jesus Christ

[1:27:28] mind for mine house should be called a
[1:27:30] house of prayer for all people so that's
[1:27:34] why I was saying to our young people my
[1:27:35] children all the children remember when

[1:27:38] adults they may have a hard week
[1:27:39] children but you can pray and you can
[1:27:41] create a real good atmosphere where the
[1:27:44] adults can hear from
[1:27:46] God and same thing for adults you might
[1:27:48] have had a good week but come in here
[1:27:50] come in here reverently so people can
[1:27:52] hear God they can talk to God they can
[1:27:54] joyfully pray and they can lift up
[1:27:56] worship and they can honor the God who
[1:27:58] sent them here praise
[1:28:00] God hallelujah one more
[1:28:04] um uh now this one I got to look up it
[1:28:07] was behaving yourself you know how to
[1:28:09] behave yourself yes 1 Timothy 3 yes I'm
[1:28:11] sorry 1 Timothy 3 last
[1:28:12] verse now in the next ver uh few sermons
[1:28:16] when I get back to this series here 1
[1:28:18] Timothy 3 it's end of the chapter I
[1:28:20] think it's uh 15 14- 15
[1:28:26] brother R's going to go through all
[1:28:27] these specific examples here of how we
[1:28:29] can be reverent in the house of
[1:28:33] God bless
[1:28:36] you first Timothy
[1:28:46] 3 Let's do 34 yes these things I write
[1:28:50] unto thee hoping to come to thee shortly
[1:28:52] now what was he writing he was about
[1:28:54] requirements for pastors these are
[1:28:56] requirements pastors have to meet and
[1:28:57] then deacons and their wives too pastors
[1:29:00] and pastors wives deacons and deacons
[1:29:04] wives verse 15 but if I car long that
[1:29:06] thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
[1:29:09] behave thyself in the house of God which
[1:29:12] is the Church of the Living God let's
[1:29:15] say Living God can we living God this is
[1:29:17] the church of living God which is the
[1:29:19] pillar and ground of
[1:29:22] Truth anybody been to the local uh the
[1:29:25] city hall lately where they have courts
[1:29:27] what do they have outside they got a
[1:29:28] woman holding the balances right and
[1:29:30] she's got a blindfold on because uh
[1:29:32] justice is blind right now most most
[1:29:35] times today it's corrupt you can pay off
[1:29:37] a judge if you're a Democrat or whatever
[1:29:39] if you're a millionaire you can pay
[1:29:40] somebody
[1:29:42] off but Paul is saying if anybody is
[1:29:45] going to be treated right if there's
[1:29:46] ever going to be a place where there's
[1:29:48] truth it's in the house of God we are
[1:29:50] the Pillar of Truth we're the foundation
[1:29:53] of Truth truth if anybody ever finds any
[1:29:55] truth in the world it ought to be right
[1:29:57] here hallelujah right here hallelujah
[1:30:00] you're the pillar and ground of the
[1:30:02] truth that's why we got to keep this a
[1:30:04] reverent Atmosphere by the grace of God
[1:30:07] we got to keep a reverent attitude
[1:30:09] towards the things of God strength is
[1:30:10] here beauty is here God's here he
[1:30:13] answers prayers here amen Joy is here
[1:30:15] hallelujah there's so much to here it's
[1:30:18] right here for
[1:30:20] us which is the pillar and God of Truth
[1:30:23] okay and now back up to 1 Timothy
[1:30:26] 3 verse two what should a bishop what
[1:30:29] should a pastor be blameless the husband
[1:30:31] of one wife Vigilant sober of good
[1:30:33] behavior given to hospitality apt to
[1:30:36] teach so all these things this is this
[1:30:39] is the behavior the pastor and if the
[1:30:41] pastor models this then you can follow
[1:30:44] that Hallelujah remember we just read it
[1:30:47] in Hebrews 13 you follow the faith of
[1:30:49] those preaching the word of God you
[1:30:51] follow Simon's faith brother Brian's
[1:30:53] faith my Faith the men of God that God
[1:30:56] has called to lead the church you follow
[1:30:57] their faith and this is the character
[1:30:59] that they have Hallelujah not given to
[1:31:02] Wine no Striker not greedy a filthy
[1:31:05] looker but patient not a brawler not
[1:31:09] covetousness I'm sorry not Covetous one
[1:31:12] that ruleth well his own house having
[1:31:14] his children in subjection with all
[1:31:16] gravity for for a man know not how to
[1:31:19] rule his own house how shall he take
[1:31:21] care of the Church of God how Hallelujah
[1:31:24] verse 6 na novice left he lest being
[1:31:27] lifted up in Pride he fall into
[1:31:29] condemnation of the devil moreover he
[1:31:32] must have a good report of them that are
[1:31:34] without so go to Copley and see what my
[1:31:36] uh reputation is in copi as a teacher go
[1:31:39] ask him go in the school ask the
[1:31:41] principal about me right Hallelujah
[1:31:44] that's right he says lest he fall into
[1:31:47] reproach uh of the snare of the devil
[1:31:50] there's a snares we preached on last
[1:31:51] week how many stay out of the snares
[1:31:52] this week I was thinking about that did
[1:31:54] you stay out of the snares this week
[1:31:55] Hallelujah no complexes no self-pity
[1:31:58] right no
[1:32:00] depression you stay out of the snares of
[1:32:02] the Devil stay away from the lust stay
[1:32:04] away from the pride and you'll be right
[1:32:06] the Satan won't be able to trap you
[1:32:07] you'll overcome every snare praise God
[1:32:10] we saw the Eagles yesterday at the zoo
[1:32:11] they were all caged up I felt remember
[1:32:13] that story I told Brother BR said he s
[1:32:14] saw the eagle fly up and hit his head I
[1:32:16] felt bad for those poor Eagles but at
[1:32:18] least they're alive right they'd be dead
[1:32:19] if they're out in the wilderness by
[1:32:20] God's grace
[1:32:24] look at deacons now now I'm the only
[1:32:25] Deacon in our
[1:32:27] church so let's how how a deacon would
[1:32:30] be likewise must a deacons be grave not
[1:32:33] double tonged not given to much wine not
[1:32:36] greedy a filthy
[1:32:37] luer who have I ever begged for money
[1:32:40] here have I begged anybody for money
[1:32:41] here have I gone out to any of the uh
[1:32:44] Sinners out there and beg the Sinners
[1:32:45] for
[1:32:46] money no and even like this have I
[1:32:49] compromised and taken money from false
[1:32:51] prophets no I don't want it I even
[1:32:53] turned people down they had full-time
[1:32:55] jobs made a lot of money I even turned
[1:32:56] them down don't come to our church
[1:32:58] because they had unconfessed sin at
[1:33:00] other churches I've even turned down
[1:33:01] ties that
[1:33:03] way because it's not about the money
[1:33:06] it's about Jehovah Gyra praise God he'll
[1:33:08] provide hallelujah it's about keeping
[1:33:10] the church
[1:33:11] clean that's what it's
[1:33:14] about that's right what does he do verse
[1:33:17] n even a deacon he holds the mystery of
[1:33:20] the faith in a pure conscience so see a
[1:33:23] deacons got to have a revelation of the
[1:33:24] message of the hour he's got to hold
[1:33:27] that mystery the revelation of the
[1:33:29] godhead right all the 12 New Testament
[1:33:30] Mysteries he's got to hold that in his
[1:33:32] head he has to remember the mystery of
[1:33:36] God and let these also first be
[1:33:39] proved then let them be I'm sorry then
[1:33:42] let them use the office of a deacon
[1:33:43] being found
[1:33:45] blameless even so must their wives be
[1:33:47] grave not slanderers sober faithful in
[1:33:52] all things let the deacons be the
[1:33:54] husbands of one wife that's why these
[1:33:55] people say oh there's such a thing as
[1:33:57] deaconesses there's there's women
[1:33:59] deacons in the church no I'm sorry the
[1:34:01] Deacon is the husband of one wife these
[1:34:04] people it's just the same Greek word the
[1:34:06] same word for Greek uh is uh the same
[1:34:09] Greek word for Deacon is like a business
[1:34:10] person and the Bible said Phoebe Paul
[1:34:13] said help Phoebe with her business so
[1:34:14] they say see same Greek word uh she's a
[1:34:17] deacon I'm sorry this is the requirement
[1:34:18] for a deacon just because it's the same
[1:34:21] word doesn't mean a woman can be a
[1:34:22] deacon you have to look at the context
[1:34:25] of the scripture let the deacons be the
[1:34:27] husbands of one wife ruling their
[1:34:29] children and their own house as well for
[1:34:32] they that have used the office of a
[1:34:33] deacon well purchased to themselves a
[1:34:35] good degree and great boldness in the
[1:34:38] faith which is in Christ Jesus let's
[1:34:40] stand to our feet ma Malachi musicians

[1:35:09] might have like 28 or 30 parts in that
[1:35:11] sermon alone but see church if you're
[1:35:13] pulling on God's word God will give you
[1:35:15] what you have need of I've always found

[1:35:24] the people are pulling God will feed his
