[0:06] acts chapter 18 verse 24.
[0:23] acts 18 and 24. like to look at this
[0:26] mighty man of god and that beautiful
[0:28] last week you got to see that this
[0:29] mighty man of god he's not even born
[0:31] again but the bible calls it a mighty
[0:33] man of god twice
[0:35] amen
[0:37] so george that's why we say it doesn't
[0:39] matter your age today as long as you're
[0:41] a christian as long as you're saved and
[0:43] the process of being sanctified you can
[0:45] be mighty in the lord
[0:47] no matter your age
[0:49] male or female right young or old
[0:52] you can be mighty as you yield to the
[0:54] holy spirit amen as you give god
[0:57] everything that you have how do you want
[0:58] to give god everything that you have
[0:59] amen even the little children want to
[1:01] give god everything you have
[1:02] you could be mighty for jesus christ
[1:04] amen verse 24 and a certain jew named
[1:07] apollos born at alexandria an eloquent
[1:09] man and mighty in the scriptures
[1:13] came to ephesus this man was instructed
[1:16] in the way of the lord and being fervent
[1:18] in the spirit he spake and taught
[1:20] diligently the things of the lord
[1:22] knowing only the baptism of john and he
[1:24] began to speak boldly in the synagogue
[1:26] whom when aquila and priscilla had heard
[1:29] they took him unto them and expounded
[1:32] unto him the way of god more perfectly
[1:34] and when he was disposed to pass into a
[1:36] ki
[1:37] the brethren wrote exhorting the
[1:38] disciples to receive him who when he was
[1:42] come helped them much which had believed
[1:45] through grace let's all read verse 28
[1:47] together ready one two three for he
[1:50] might convince the jews and that
[1:53] publicly
[1:54] shown by the scriptures that jesus was
[1:57] christ may god as blessing to read his
[1:59] word you may be seated god bless you i
[2:01] have some slides of course today
[2:09] i'd like to continue on this thought
[2:12] you're regarding uh mighty men yesterday
[2:16] today and forever
[2:18] you know with the passing of brother
[2:19] clement i just thought i'd just share
[2:21] you know his picture in case anyone
[2:23] didn't remember him
[2:26] i think he preached one time in this
[2:28] sanctuary if not it was the other one i
[2:30] can't quite remember but we just want to
[2:32] remember him and his family you know
[2:34] his family rather
[2:36] there's a picture of him if you haven't
[2:38] seen him
[2:39] so i think he's one that gave sister
[2:40] naomi our our phone number here to
[2:42] contact us if i'm not mistaken he was 76
[2:45] when he passed away 76.
[2:47] and this just reminds me of you know
[2:49] brother samuel's dad brother james when
[2:50] he passed away five years ago it's
[2:52] already been five years
[2:53] hard to believe that
[2:54] another minister who passed away at 75
[2:58] and he's the brother that told me
[2:59] brother jesse take care of yourself now
[3:01] he didn't tell me not to race
[3:03] malachi and austin in the parking lot so
[3:06] i wish somebody would have told me that
[3:09] no but he didn't tell me to take care of
[3:11] my body which i've done i've honored
[3:13] that that was a wonderful wisdom there
[3:15] but just you know i was looking thinking
[3:17] about i've known two ministers you know
[3:18] the last five years that
[3:20] that i've known closely
[3:22] passed away
[3:24] and uh let's pray for his family you
[3:26] know his wife had passed away his first
[3:28] wife passed away
[3:30] a couple years ago sister beatrice said
[3:32] that
[3:33] she would she was a real woman of faith
[3:35] just a sweet woman there
[3:37] but you know this reminds me of the
[3:38] bible says teach us to number our days
[3:41] uh that we may apply our hearts to
[3:43] wisdom
[3:44] and i just want to show that you know
[3:45] every believer thinks jesus is going to
[3:47] return to their day
[3:49] brother random thought this was in 1963
[3:51] brother thought i don't know when he
[3:53] will come he doesn't tell us that but i
[3:55] do believe so he was believing
[3:57] we're so close to the coming lord that i
[3:59] would never die with old age
[4:02] yet at 54 years old i'll never die with
[4:04] old age until he's here
[4:06] brother ran thought for sure he'd come
[4:08] within my lifetime that's right he was
[4:10] born in 1909 so 2009 would have been 100
[4:14] years old
[4:15] for brother branham right and then
[4:17] 2019 would have been 110.
[4:21] so 11 12 113 years old this year
[4:24] but he just believed i don't think
[4:27] i'll die i think jesus is going to come
[4:29] in my lifetime now don't you think these
[4:30] preachers did as well
[4:33] don't you think how many think jesus is
[4:34] going to come into life come in your
[4:35] lifetime
[4:37] i i think so
[4:39] i pray and ask god lord show me i think
[4:40] i've heard that again this week i was
[4:41] like just show me if he's if you're
[4:42] going to come in my lifetime or not you
[4:43] know just i don't know if he will but i
[4:45] just that's my request
[4:48] but brother and told us you know in this
[4:50] questions and answers don't change a
[4:52] thing he said
[4:53] if jesus is coming in the morning preach
[4:55] today like it's going to be 10 years
[4:56] from today
[4:59] in other words in other words don't be a
[5:00] fanatic about it you know don't don't
[5:02] act like you know all about it be humble
[5:05] but he said but live like it's going to
[5:07] be at this hour amen now i also take
[5:09] this to
[5:10] uh
[5:11] to believe as well
[5:13] live your life like you're going to
[5:14] spend your whole life here naturally
[5:17] in other words take care of your body so
[5:20] if you do live to the old age then the
[5:22] bible the bible calls them evil days
[5:23] when we talk about that wednesday night
[5:24] brother after church
[5:26] remember the creator of the days of your
[5:28] youth because there's going to be
[5:29] there's going to come evil days
[5:32] right
[5:32] or we'd say some will be more evil than
[5:35] others you know depending on what god
[5:36] allows and what also we choose in our
[5:38] lives right so i just thought i'd share
[5:40] that you know
[5:42] and i've shared this before i've known
[5:43] people that you know when i first come
[5:44] to the message they're like oh don't
[5:45] even build a house or don't even finish
[5:47] college you know jesus is going to come
[5:48] before we finish college
[5:50] you know it's been many years you know
[5:52] since we've been covering the message so
[5:54] i just you know from from that little
[5:55] reminder there i just thought well god
[5:57] help us to live such godly lives
[6:00] uh help us to live that we we live like
[6:02] we hope he's gonna come in our life but
[6:03] let's live like he may not that's right
[6:05] in other words like brother man said
[6:07] let's leave footprints on the sands of
[6:09] time
[6:10] so the next generation would come
[6:12] they'll know how to serve jesus christ
[6:15] let's leave
[6:16] a testimony here by the grace of god
[6:19] and church this is the best indicator of
[6:21] the rapture not only been the message
[6:23] but about
[6:24] uh
[6:25] about 20 years now
[6:27] almost 20 years
[6:30] and i've seen things come and go i've
[6:32] seen people take quotes and major on
[6:33] certain quotes and to me at this point
[6:36] this is the scripture that will give us
[6:38] the best indicator of when the rapture
[6:40] is going to come
[6:43] it's the brother random said i believe
[6:46] the real bride of christ will be forced
[6:47] to stop preaching the word of god
[6:50] because brother and said it was
[6:51] prophesied in revelation 13 16. now this
[6:54] is this could change but as a minister
[6:56] of the gospel as the best of my ability
[6:58] i could be wrong
[6:59] i'll say i believe just like brother ram
[7:01] said i believe he'll come in while i'm
[7:03] alive you know
[7:04] i believe when we see the united states
[7:06] start changing laws to persecute
[7:08] christians that's when i believe the
[7:10] rapture will come
[7:12] okay i'm not looking for atomic bombs
[7:14] you know atomic bombs could come and the
[7:16] rapture is still going to come look what
[7:17] happened to world war ii
[7:19] just because the topic bomb falls
[7:21] doesn't mean we miss the rapture
[7:23] it may be part of some scripture or
[7:25] prophecy we haven't understood yet
[7:27] the thing to do is be ready confess all
[7:30] your sins
[7:31] watch and pray amen serve god with all
[7:34] your heart soul mind and strength amen
[7:36] amen but live your life like you only
[7:39] have so many so i'm 41.
[7:41] so if i live to be one i'll just say 75
[7:45] i got 34 more years
[7:47] i got three more decades to preach it's
[7:49] been a wonderful two decades preaching
[7:52] i hope i can preach uh three more
[7:53] decades by god's grace i hope i can live
[7:56] longer because i try to take care of
[7:57] myself i hope i can the bible says right
[7:59] and then you have a little more strength
[8:00] you get to 80 if you have a little more
[8:01] strength so
[8:02] i'm hoping god will give me that extra
[8:04] boost of strength praise god
[8:06] just because i want to share the gospel
[8:08] i want to teach people you know it seems
[8:09] like my ministry is an online ministry
[8:11] united which is fine as far as other
[8:13] than pastoring i want a pastor but i
[8:15] want to be able to impact as many people
[8:16] as i can by god's grace
[8:19] but this is still the best indicator
[8:21] when that's why i watch the news from
[8:23] time to time you know i keep track with
[8:25] the laws they write and
[8:26] uh
[8:27] you know the voting that's why i still
[8:29] pray about elections
[8:30] and just like with roe v wade if we ever
[8:32] wondered if god hears our prayers we
[8:34] should now know god hears our prayers
[8:36] so i cried tears up here before service
[8:38] i cried tears that god would take away
[8:40] these murders these murderers out of the
[8:42] government
[8:44] and i'll keep doing that by god's grace
[8:46] because i know god hears my prayers
[8:48] hallelujah
[8:51] so
[8:52] let's look at part three i guess i'll
[8:54] just kind of transition into the
[8:56] preaching here by god's grace let me set
[8:57] a timer for an hour
[8:59] um never know how long
[9:01] it may go here by god's grace but
[9:03] uh we read our texts here now we're
[9:05] again we're trying to increase our faith
[9:07] i'm not really going to be teaching you
[9:08] something like wednesday and i was
[9:09] teaching about the doctrines of devils
[9:10] and how that can uh satan can kind of uh
[9:14] slip into our lives if we make brother
[9:16] branham's life a tradition
[9:19] we can't make his life and try to
[9:20] interpret his life how we want we gotta
[9:22] just look at his life and we're gonna
[9:24] take everything back to the word of god
[9:26] praise god we've got to be humble
[9:28] um we never want to exalt ourselves as
[9:30] we're something great
[9:32] now it's interesting i say that now i'm
[9:33] telling you that you're mighty okay so
[9:35] you need to know that you're mighty but
[9:37] don't exalt yourself like you're great
[9:38] praise god in other words let god's
[9:40] power flow through you mightily praise
[9:42] god recognize that i have the ability as
[9:45] i yield to the holy spirit god can use
[9:47] me mightily
[9:49] but let us never pat ourselves on the
[9:51] back and say oh he's so great she's so
[9:52] great or they're the greatest thing
[9:54] since sliced bread they're the greatest
[9:56] ever you know they we saw that on
[9:57] wednesday let's never let's never be
[9:59] guilty of that by god's grace
[10:01] so that's maybe the lord will help us
[10:03] here raise our faith here i want to
[10:05] start with apollos you know he was a
[10:07] mighty man made more mighty
[10:10] okay so here we are you know we think
[10:12] how can i be a mighty man how can i be a
[10:13] mighty woman in the new testament
[10:16] you know the thought just came to me now
[10:17] look at the woman at the well
[10:19] did god use her mightily yeah
[10:22] in just a moment's time jesus discerned
[10:24] her she runs into the city she tells the
[10:27] city come and see a man
[10:29] that's told me everything i've done
[10:30] isn't this the messiah
[10:32] and look how mightily god used her
[10:34] testimony praise god amen almost the
[10:36] whole city gets saved amen she convinces
[10:39] almost a whole town to come out and hear
[10:41] jesus preach and discern that's a mighty
[10:44] woman can i say it like that praise god
[10:46] amen that's a mighty woman just thought
[10:48] of that one here
[10:50] but the one we looked at last sunday was
[10:51] priscilla right
[10:53] priscilla
[10:55] a holy ghost wife
[10:56] who opened up her home as a church
[11:00] it's actually in the book of corinthians
[11:03] paul says paul says i greet
[11:05] aquila and priscilla and the church that
[11:08] is in their house
[11:10] they didn't have big buildings right
[11:11] when the message first started you know
[11:12] when the christianity started they
[11:14] didn't have great big buildings that was
[11:15] until constantine allowed that but then
[11:17] they were perverted
[11:18] churches by that time
[11:21] so priscilla opened up her house to the
[11:24] the preachers to paul
[11:26] her and her husband got the holy ghost
[11:28] praise god but then they had to leave
[11:30] rome because rome had an outlaw against
[11:32] all jews talk about a racial time you
[11:34] know they they kicked out all the jews
[11:36] out of the city they hated jews
[11:39] but they overcame that praise god they
[11:41] still found a new place they met paul
[11:43] they became tet makers praise god
[11:46] and they became so one with the message
[11:48] that when they come to ephesus and met
[11:50] apollos they said now that's a mighty
[11:52] man
[11:53] as far as he knows
[11:56] [Applause]
[11:57] praise god and this man and woman take
[11:59] this mighty man to the side
[12:02] and they help tell him there's a more
[12:05] perfect way there's a more wonderful way
[12:07] to serve god praise god amen you're
[12:10] mighty in your current condition but you
[12:12] can be mightier praise god amen amen
[12:14] hallelujah let me know that god's
[12:16] message has made you more mighty praise
[12:17] god amen amen see i imagine i just
[12:19] imagined by the amen was a mighty soul
[12:21] leader in this in his
[12:22] denomination but god's made it more
[12:24] about it here praise god hallelujah man
[12:27] was a mighty servant to the
[12:28] church that he was in you know serving
[12:30] them but see god wants to make you more
[12:32] mighty in spiritual matters praise god
[12:35] hallelujah
[12:38] so remember he was mining the scripture
[12:41] instructing the way of the lord
[12:43] and then around 80 54 he helped or he
[12:46] was taught more perfectly by aquila and
[12:49] priscilla
[12:51] and then we see him he goes to acai then
[12:54] corinth
[12:55] and then when the apostle wrote his
[12:56] first first epistle to the corinthians
[12:59] apollos was right there with him so
[13:00] apollos was not a pastor it's likely he
[13:03] was a teacher and an evangelist because
[13:06] he kept going from you know ephesus to
[13:07] k.i to corinth
[13:10] and then we hear about the last we hear
[13:11] about him is in titus 3 verse 13.
[13:14] paul tells them perhaps
[13:17] apollos will be able to come to you at a
[13:19] convenient season
[13:20] and there's nothing then known about him
[13:22] as far as these historians know
[13:25] uh tradition makes him a bishop of
[13:27] caesarea but you know we don't it's just
[13:29] man's tradition there's nothing in the
[13:30] scripture about that
[13:32] but i want you to notice he had six
[13:34] attributes of a mighty man now some of
[13:36] you have these attributes
[13:38] you don't have to have all these
[13:39] attributes you just have to have some of
[13:41] these attributes
[13:43] and you can be mighty in the things of
[13:45] god
[13:47] if you are mighty in the scriptures
[13:49] and this would i likely be the uh
[13:52] the gift of knowledge because knowledge
[13:54] is understanding of the scripture
[13:57] if you are mining the scripture you just
[13:59] the scripture just seem to come to
[14:00] you just when you need them right at the
[14:02] right time just to know what to say you
[14:04] know the right scripture
[14:06] that'd be mighty in the scripture right
[14:08] if you've been instructed in the gospel
[14:11] you could be mighty having that
[14:13] instruction that
[14:14] knowledge some of you are fervent in the
[14:17] gifts that god has given to you you want
[14:19] to be fervent with him boiling right you
[14:21] want to be active
[14:23] you want it to be something that's
[14:24] constantly moving in your life how do
[14:25] you want to be moved by the spirit
[14:26] praise god
[14:28] you know we're all going to battle you
[14:30] know fatigue and tiredness and stress
[14:32] wrong about that but we also we want to
[14:34] be able to get refreshing from stress
[14:36] and we all want to be fervent in our
[14:38] human spirits praise god amen that's
[14:41] part of being mighty or letting god's
[14:43] spirit move through you mightily
[14:46] he was diligent which means he was just
[14:48] constantly there constantly teaching
[14:50] constantly in the scripture
[14:52] he was diligent you didn't find him
[14:54] taking seasons off praise god
[14:57] uh you didn't find him you know lazy or
[14:59] missing where's he at where's where's he
[15:02] at today did he you want to come to
[15:03] church today you know if you didn't find
[15:05] out about apollos he was diligent with
[15:07] it praise god
[15:09] if he made a commitment he was faithful
[15:11] to that commitment praise god
[15:13] and he was bold
[15:15] publicly
[15:17] so in public he would be able to stand
[15:20] there and defend
[15:21] and be a witness for what he believed
[15:24] he did in other words he didn't care who
[15:25] was around praise god right
[15:27] i think about your job sometimes you can
[15:29] be a witness you don't care who's around
[15:30] you're going to stand for jesus
[15:32] i know you have because you've been
[15:33] singing on the job
[15:34] because we get to see some of the fruits
[15:36] of that you know
[15:37] hallelujah
[15:38] just bowl for jesus saying not ashamed
[15:40] of the gospel amen hallelujah
[15:43] and not only was he that but he could
[15:44] convince people
[15:46] in a public debate that's right
[15:49] now of course
[15:51] uh that day was a day where many people
[15:53] would be safe it was the it was like an
[15:55] open door age we're in the closing door
[15:57] age that's right so few and fewer would
[15:59] be saved but he was able to convince
[16:01] them publicly through all these
[16:04] attributes that he had praise god amen
[16:07] amen now we get uh three important
[16:09] things here
[16:10] believers can be mighty in operating
[16:13] their gifts before the new birth
[16:15] the church we got to be encouraged even
[16:17] if we're not born again or praying about
[16:18] if we're born again or not let's not
[16:20] forget that god still wants to use us in
[16:22] our daily lives amen
[16:25] he can still use you mightily like i was
[16:27] sharing you know with some of my
[16:29] children i've seen different testimonies
[16:30] where god has used them and caused them
[16:32] to help adults and they're just children
[16:35] you know uh
[16:37] so i want us to have that understanding
[16:39] no matter your age no matter if you're
[16:40] male or female preacher not it doesn't
[16:42] matter god wants to use you amen amen so
[16:45] let your faith rise hallelujah god wants
[16:47] to use you amen
[16:50] and now notice god god magnifies public
[16:53] preaching
[16:55] and debating
[16:56] some people are against debates now
[16:58] brother adam sometimes was for sometimes
[17:00] he was against it brother graham was
[17:01] against the spirit of competition debate
[17:04] that's what he was against but brother
[17:06] brother had at least three debates i
[17:07] proved that a couple years ago when i i
[17:09] went through this quote he got at least
[17:10] three debates one on the oneness of god
[17:12] uh one on tongues and i can never
[17:14] remember the third one but he had at
[17:16] least three debates that he was a part
[17:17] of
[17:19] and god
[17:21] god thought so much of apollos because
[17:23] he would debate the bible publicly that
[17:26] he called him mighty on two occasions
[17:29] mighty
[17:32] and then third
[17:33] god can use a woman like sister
[17:35] priscilla
[17:37] that's a pretty good name if we have any
[17:38] more girls that's a pretty good name for
[17:40] said
[17:41] i like that one with gifts of the holy
[17:44] ghost to make a man more mighty god can
[17:47] make a man more mighty by using a woman
[17:50] hallelujah
[17:52] and it wasn't even his wife church
[17:55] let that soak in for a minute
[17:59] he's a mighty preacher but a holy
[18:01] ghost-filled woman god used her and her
[18:04] husband to point this guy to a greater
[18:06] truth a more perfect revelation amen
[18:11] hallelujah
[18:13] why because she learned from the prophet
[18:15] of god she learned from the church age
[18:17] messenger praise god amen
[18:19] she knew what the holy ghost was amen
[18:22] the bible says they
[18:24] so they were working together so jesus
[18:27] church you can be a woman and be a
[18:28] mighty woman for god
[18:30] you can be a man and not even be a
[18:32] preacher aquila wasn't even a preacher
[18:34] but you can testify and help people and
[18:36] point them to the truth and god can use
[18:38] you to make somebody more mighty praise
[18:40] god amen
[18:41] amen
[18:45] now it's possible she had the gift of
[18:46] wisdom
[18:47] knowledge
[18:49] maybe other gifts maybe prophecy maybe
[18:51] god gave her a prophecy or you will be
[18:53] born again and a certain maybe thus
[18:55] saved the lord maybe you'll be born
[18:56] again in in court or something like that
[18:59] we don't know
[19:00] but the way they testified the way she
[19:02] spoke with aquila it caused him to go
[19:05] deeper in the faith and cause him to
[19:07] meet up with paul and no doubt he was
[19:08] born again praise god amen
[19:10] hallelujah
[19:12] and women always sisters you always have
[19:15] the liberty to testify well let me tell
[19:17] you what jesus did for me praise god
[19:19] amen that is not a serving authority
[19:21] over men this is a serving authority
[19:23] when you get up here you preach the word
[19:24] of god you tell them what to do you have
[19:27] you have control over all these all
[19:29] these people praise god
[19:31] that this is a serpent authority but
[19:33] just testifying after service or
[19:34] testifying uh
[19:36] at the job or something that's not a
[19:38] surfing authority that's being that's
[19:40] being submissive to god's gifts that
[19:42] he's placed in your life amen amen
[19:44] hallelujah
[19:46] see born again through the prophet of
[19:48] god of her age
[19:50] just like we are
[19:52] and she would find opportunities to
[19:54] testify with her husband
[19:57] and she wasn't going out there trying to
[19:58] preach on the streets by herself she
[20:00] just waited for the right opportunities
[20:02] she opened up her home
[20:04] right and then she can testify in her
[20:06] home after the services
[20:08] and then she could pull the preacher
[20:09] aside with her husband and testify to
[20:12] the the preacher right
[20:14] she just found opportunities
[20:16] to talk about the lord
[20:18] how many believe that's probably the
[20:20] most exciting times in your life when
[20:22] you get to witness and share the word
[20:23] with somebody
[20:24] those are some of the greatest times
[20:26] that's when i feel the most alive many
[20:28] times of course preaching i always feel
[20:29] alive up here too but you know outside
[20:31] of preaching
[20:32] when i feel most alive is when i get to
[20:34] share the message with somebody when
[20:36] they actually want to hear what i have
[20:37] to say
[20:38] and it sounds like they're really
[20:40] interested in the word of god
[20:42] like
[20:43] like brother nj is a more recent example
[20:46] i just got to testify right there and
[20:47] i'm like i'm going to go get this guy
[20:48] the book and then he said did god tell
[20:50] you to bring me the book because i was
[20:51] just
[20:52] the holy spirit just told me don't wear
[20:53] tight clothing and that's exactly have a
[20:55] whole chapter on that you know
[20:57] and he knew it was god
[20:58] but those are the times you feel alive
[21:00] like i know god was using me
[21:02] i was walking in god's divine plan for
[21:04] my life at that moment praise god
[21:06] man
[21:08] testify that there's a greater power
[21:09] than denominational power
[21:12] there's holy ghost power amen amen
[21:14] that's when you feel alive like god's
[21:16] using you
[21:19] and how do i know i'm not preaching to
[21:20] some preachers here today
[21:22] right all the brothers here
[21:25] that are qualified right
[21:27] all that are qualified i could be
[21:28] preaching to you trying to make you more
[21:30] mighty praise god
[21:32] because someone came along named brother
[21:34] brooks and brother craig they helped me
[21:35] become a mighty man
[21:38] right not that i'm staying almighty but
[21:40] it's the holy spirit working through me
[21:41] mightily
[21:42] that's helped me overcome all my trials
[21:45] the reason i'm still standing here is
[21:47] because the holy ghost has worked
[21:48] mightily in my life praise god amen the
[21:51] reason you're here today is because the
[21:53] holy ghost has stood up for you have
[21:55] stood in you praise god i've given you
[21:57] grace to receive the word of god he's
[21:59] working vitally through you right now
[22:00] praise god
[22:02] the fact you're still standing amen this
[22:04] is an age where men's hearts are failing
[22:07] for fear praise god
[22:09] all the fear and all the torment about
[22:11] the future we're not made to fear we're
[22:13] not built to fear we cannot continue
[22:15] going on fear we've got to have faith
[22:18] amen and that's what it is it's the
[22:20] mighty god and baal before us amen
[22:22] unveiled in our lives god working
[22:24] through our lives mightily praise god
[22:26] amen amen amen
[22:29] hallelujah don't ever think yourself so
[22:31] uh no powerless
[22:33] yes you have no power of your own but
[22:34] god works through you mightily in your
[22:37] day-to-day life amen hallelujah
[22:41] day-to-day life
[22:44] god's power works through us mightily
[22:47] just like sister priscilla that mighty
[22:49] system there
[22:51] i'm gonna go shake her hand in hand one
[22:52] day and say you were a mighty sister
[22:55] because you made this brother more
[22:56] mighty
[22:58] right she was like come on up here she's
[22:59] like come on up there maybe they both
[23:01] reach down grab your head come on up
[23:02] here to the higher round come on up here
[23:04] to the third work of grace
[23:06] come up higher in the message of the
[23:07] hour
[23:08] so apollos was a convincing mightily
[23:12] convincing which means he disproved with
[23:14] rivalry and effort in a contest so the
[23:17] public debates are like a contest
[23:21] right but apollos had the holy spirit on
[23:23] him in a mighty way in order here he
[23:26] said to win the contest
[23:28] to win the argument like we like we like
[23:30] watching the charlie kirk arguments and
[23:32] we like debates rather because we know
[23:35] truth will prevail
[23:36] amen
[23:37] and that's how it is with the word of
[23:38] god if you stand for god's word god's
[23:41] truth will prevail in you and when you
[23:43] stand up to the enemy or any obstacle or
[23:45] anyone speaking an evil against you and
[23:47] you speak the word of god and you
[23:48] manifest the love of god then god has
[23:50] used you mightily amen
[23:53] because church you've seen it it just
[23:54] takes one person to sway someone away
[23:57] and they'll fall away from the faith
[24:00] or like some of the brothers we've had
[24:01] it just takes one sexy dress woman and
[24:03] then he falls away
[24:05] right
[24:06] right or some of our sisters just takes
[24:07] one handsome man you know and she'll
[24:09] fall away it's happened at our church
[24:11] before numerous times
[24:13] that's all it takes
[24:15] and so when you're able to stand against
[24:17] the enemy
[24:18] and refute the enemy praise god
[24:22] and win the contest then you've won the
[24:24] battle and that makes you more than a
[24:26] conqueror praise god
[24:28] hallelujah in your everyday life praise
[24:30] god like that song we sing something
[24:33] keeps holding me like each one of us
[24:34] know there's probably times of our life
[24:36] if if god didn't intervene we probably
[24:38] would have we probably would have lost a
[24:39] real awful battle amen we probably would
[24:42] have made a disgrace of our lives but
[24:44] who stood up for us jesus stood up for
[24:46] us amen
[24:47] he said his word the right time he gave
[24:49] us a testimony he helped us what we feel
[24:52] win a debate or win a contest he helped
[24:54] us fight the good fight of faith and we
[24:56] overcame by the blood of the lamb and
[24:58] the word of our testimony god made us
[25:00] strong god made us mighty that's what
[25:02] he's here to do today make us fighting
[25:04] praise god amen
[25:06] amen
[25:10] you know those guys got confused one
[25:12] time a
[25:12] year ago i was preaching brother cams
[25:14] and i said i'm just like joshua there's
[25:16] no man that's going to stand before me
[25:17] all the days of my life now some of the
[25:19] guys i've debated and gone against they
[25:21] said well well you said that i that
[25:24] i fell before your feet i never said
[25:26] that i just said no man can stand before
[25:29] me no man can get in my way of where i'm
[25:32] going praise god that's right
[25:34] hallelujah
[25:35] no man or no woman can get in my way in
[25:37] other words i'm moving on with god i'm
[25:39] walking the perfect will of god i'll
[25:41] just say excuse me get out of my way i'm
[25:43] moving on with jesus praise god
[25:45] i'm not forsaking the message i'm not
[25:47] forsaking truth i'm standing for truth
[25:49] and no obstacle will stand before me i'm
[25:52] moving on with god i'm going to possess
[25:54] all that god has called me to possess
[25:56] amen that's what i mean by that that's
[25:59] right man it's a spiritual battle praise
[26:01] god
[26:02] not a physical battle
[26:06] and god mightily anoints men to do this
[26:08] like paul would debate there in acts 17.
[26:10] he every saturday he would go debate
[26:12] that was his debate day
[26:15] you know that's what i'm hoping if god
[26:16] ever helps me to
[26:17] retire
[26:18] with the lord jerry's if i ever retire
[26:20] at 17 or 17 more years of work then i
[26:22] can retire so
[26:25] maybe warn that
[26:27] lord willing but if god ever allows me
[26:29] to retire i'd like to just have a day of
[26:31] witnessing in the public wouldn't that
[26:32] be awesome
[26:33] yeah i could just go to panera just sit
[26:35] there and wait for somebody to walk
[26:36] sit down and just kind of go hey
[26:38] you ever heard about jesus you know
[26:40] i just wouldn't that'd be nice just to
[26:42] to debate or suck a flag and say change
[26:44] my mind right man okay change my mind
[26:46] set up a big flag and say change my mind
[26:48] just sit at the table there
[26:52] but some you know we have and i i
[26:53] appreciate people that do that today
[26:56] it takes real courage it takes real
[26:57] moments
[26:58] like apollo said
[27:00] but see god anoints men to do this men
[27:03] and women that know the truth they're
[27:04] not afraid of the truth
[27:08] you can't you cannot deceive the very
[27:10] left there it is
[27:11] you cannot deceive the very election
[27:13] it's impossible praise god
[27:16] we don't have all the answers we don't
[27:17] know everything but you cannot deceive
[27:19] the very elected that's the reason they
[27:21] are the elect that's the reason they are
[27:23] the chosen because they are chosen
[27:25] before the foundation of the world and
[27:26] the mind of jesus christ and they've
[27:28] received not the spirit of lies not the
[27:30] spirit of delusion but the spirit of
[27:32] truth amen
[27:35] amen
[27:36] amen
[27:37] now you are madly everybody say i am
[27:40] ever saying ready i am i am i am
[27:43] mighty in one of these areas you're
[27:45] mighty one of
[27:46] them even you little girls little boys
[27:49] version even him you're mighty in one of
[27:51] these areas
[27:54] wisdom is the sound advice what to do
[27:56] and when to do it now's the time to do
[27:58] this
[27:59] let's do this
[28:01] by the leadership of the holy spirit
[28:03] now just the scripture says this
[28:06] oh and then and then it's like a door's
[28:08] open oh now i can enter into that yes
[28:10] the scriptures this is what i should do
[28:13] faith is a revelation that god is going
[28:15] to answer prayer
[28:17] because faith moves mountains
[28:19] i know it's going to move because god
[28:21] already showed me god put it on my heart
[28:22] it's going to move amen
[28:24] healing is over time god will heal the
[28:27] person because you prayed for it
[28:29] miracles that's going to happen right
[28:31] now and the laws of nature are going to
[28:33] be suspended
[28:34] hallelujah amen
[28:37] i repeated miracles how did i do that
[28:39] one two three four five
[28:41] six okay i missed one in there oh
[28:43] discernment i forgot discernment the
[28:44] sermon is judging the spirit is this the
[28:47] spirit of jesus christ or is this his
[28:48] antichrist spirit
[28:50] how did i forget that
[28:52] um
[28:53] seven is prophecy for telling the future
[28:55] whether with thus save the lord or
[28:57] dreams
[28:58] tongues is a language of men or angels
[29:02] and nine is the interpretation of an
[29:04] unknown tongue
[29:05] okay so you are mighty in one of these
[29:08] areas
[29:09] remember these are the least of the
[29:11] gifts
[29:12] but when they were restored in 1906
[29:15] that's what god used god was using those
[29:18] to let them know i'm restoring the gifts
[29:20] amen praise god
[29:22] and i'll say like this whatever gift you
[29:23] have god will lead you into its
[29:25] operation
[29:27] god had to lead god had to like really
[29:29] lead moses into operating his gifts
[29:31] really like on the backside of desert go
[29:33] show himself as a fire that would not be
[29:35] consumed god really had to lead him to
[29:37] use his gifts
[29:40] in other words god has something in your
[29:41] life god's gonna bring it out at the
[29:43] right time just keep trusting god honor
[29:45] god fear god be strong in the lord and
[29:48] god will bring your gifts to pass in
[29:50] your life if you wait upon him praise
[29:52] god
[29:53] because when you wait you renew strength
[29:55] praise god
[29:57] amen it's like you're building up

[34:01] see so when you feel like i can't serve
[34:03] god today i don't want to serve god
[34:05] today that's when we need the strength
[34:06] of the lord that's why we need god's
[34:08] spirit and church we have something to
[34:10] do with that
[34:11] god's given us control over our three
[34:13] realms amen we know we know how to get
[34:15] it moving put on some music amen do
[34:18] something put on a sermon amen call a
[34:20] brother text a sister do something try
[34:22] to get the faith of god stirred up in
[34:24] your heart let that mighty man or woman
[34:26] come out of you amen amen amen amen
[34:30] come with my soul don't you get shy on
[34:32] me because you've got a lion
[34:36] you've got an ego amen inside of that
[34:39] soul praise god amen
[34:41] get up and praise the lord amen you're
[34:43] mighty man of valor
[34:44] amen you mighty woman about valor get up
[34:48] and praise it all right amen amen
[34:50] hallelujah you don't know the end we
[34:52] don't know what i was going to do but we
[34:53] know he's going to do great things
[34:55] like our memory verse says we know god
[34:57] has plans for us not of evil but
[34:59] thoughts of peace hallelujah amen
[35:02] to give us an expected end
[35:05] hallelujah
[35:09] now here's if you have the gift of faith
[35:11] the bible calls it the prayer faith that
[35:13] means you can just pray for something
[35:15] and you when you feel you're anointed
[35:17] then that god's going to move on your
[35:18] behalf
[35:20] the prayer of faith shall save the sick
[35:22] what saves them god anointing your
[35:24] prayer to be mightily answered amen
[35:27] that will save the sick
[35:29] praise god
[35:30] and the lord shall raise them up
[35:33] but god needs you to pray
[35:35] that's right and the church said
[35:37] god's going to raise them up but who's
[35:38] he need to pray you and i
[35:41] what kind of prayer a prayer of faith
[35:45] that's trust right trust
[35:49] and if he had committed sins they shall
[35:51] be forgiven and that's why i will say
[35:52] confess your sins right first because
[35:53] verse 16 confess your thoughts one to
[35:55] another pray for another that you may be
[35:57] healed the effectual fervent prayer of a
[36:01] righteous man availeth much
[36:04] so see when a fervent prayer prevails it
[36:08] could be a gift of faith
[36:10] now in the greek fervent is the same
[36:12] word as effectual so uh some reason the
[36:15] translators just added two words to
[36:17] describe it so the word effectual means
[36:19] to be operative to be at work
[36:21] to put forth power
[36:24] so can i say it like this the putting
[36:26] forth of a powerful prayer prevails much
[36:29] in heaven amen
[36:31] glory
[36:33] to work for one to aid one
[36:36] to display one's activity a fervent
[36:38] prayer is displaying and one's activity
[36:41] in prayer to show oneself active so we
[36:44] must be active in our prayers we must
[36:46] know our prayers are at work our prayers
[36:48] have power that's right hallelujah but
[36:51] the key there is what a righteous man or
[36:54] woman
[36:55] we've got to confess all of our sins
[36:57] praise god
[36:58] and then that kind of prayer prevails
[37:00] much with the mighty saints
[37:03] hallelujah now let's look at paul's
[37:07] display
[37:09] i believe he was a mighty man of god
[37:10] amen
[37:12] i believe he was the greatest christian
[37:13] of all time i could be wrong on that but
[37:14] i believe it just because of all the
[37:16] bible evidence
[37:18] his sufferings uh his labors of love his
[37:21] missionary work he labored more than all
[37:23] the apostles and we know the apostles
[37:24] sit right around jesus
[37:26] so i'm entitled to my opinion praise god
[37:28] just like people are entitled to their
[37:30] opinion but i'm entitled to mine
[37:31] there's ten miracles recording the
[37:33] scripture now there could be more uh
[37:34] that's what i've just found online
[37:36] his first miracle recorder was a
[37:38] wondrous miracle
[37:40] uh elias the sorcerer was struck with
[37:43] blindness so paul could get the
[37:45] counselor saved the deputy saved
[37:48] that was his first noted miracle in the
[37:49] scripture
[37:50] he smoked somebody blind with literal
[37:53] blindness for a season
[37:55] okay a wonder they just wondered wonder
[37:57] wow i didn't know remember the deputies
[37:58] like i didn't know god did this in his
[38:00] doctrine and his power
[38:03] mighty miracle mighty wondrous miracle
[38:05] second the bible just said he did signs
[38:07] wonders uh through paul and barnabas in
[38:09] acts 14. so elimus was acts 13 acts 14
[38:13] is signs wonders and miracles with
[38:14] barnabas acts 14 paul heals a crippled
[38:17] man
[38:18] through his ministry
[38:20] so a healing a miracle
[38:22] next in acts chapter 16 paul casts out a
[38:24] devil they call it an exorcism a casting
[38:27] out of a devil uh
[38:29] that's a powerful work of god that's a
[38:30] miracle right because the miracle's
[38:32] instant when that devil leaves it's
[38:33] instant deliverance
[38:35] jesus said that too because he said you
[38:37] no man can do a work in my name a mighty
[38:40] work in my name except he honored me now
[38:42] i'm kind of misquoting that a little bit
[38:43] but you understand unless he shows
[38:45] reverence toward me
[38:46] so casting on the devil is an absolute
[38:48] miracle
[38:49] the devil that's been living there for
[38:51] we say weeks months years has to go he's
[38:54] been kicked out of his house because
[38:55] it's not his house it was purchased by
[38:57] the blood of jesus christ amen
[38:59] hallelujah
[39:02] fifth
[39:04] there was a wonder uh in acts chapter 16
[39:07] paul and silas's prison doors were open
[39:10] and the prison keeper and his family
[39:11] were saved that's a wonderland whoa god
[39:14] shook the whole prison and all and the
[39:16] chains fell off and everything that's a
[39:18] wonder that's right right wonder signs
[39:21] wonders miracle scientists telling you
[39:23] something to come right
[39:25] a miracle instant healing or instant
[39:27] instant raising up of a or
[39:29] something signed wonder miracle praise
[39:32] god i appreciate god versus greg say man
[39:35] so to me like my grandpa's testimony he
[39:37] was on 77 south by grandpa garza
[39:41] uh he was going down the mountain and
[39:44] the truck either he got out of the lane
[39:46] or the truck out lane he said he was
[39:48] coming going 70 miles per hour and gonna
[39:50] hit the truck head on he said he flew up
[39:52] his threw up his hand and said jesus
[39:54] and the next thing he remembers he's
[39:56] parked on the side of the road with his
[39:58] wife and there's not one thing wrong
[40:00] there's not even a scratch
[40:02] this is my grandpa yeah
[40:04] you know he would and he would just have
[40:05] testimony after testimony after
[40:07] testimony that's a wonder like whoa how
[40:10] did that happen
[40:11] wonder how in the world did god do that
[40:14] did he just rapture did he translate the
[40:15] cover after the card and said how do you
[40:18] do that
[40:19] how do you do it
[40:20] so we have signs wonders and miracles
[40:25] see god makes us wonder at his power and
[40:27] his glory how many believe that by god's
[40:28] grace amen i believe it praise god
[40:32] next in acts chapter 19 12 men are
[40:33] filled with the holy spirit
[40:35] uh that's i'm not sure but
[40:38] that would be a sign wonder miracle it
[40:39] wouldn't be a miracle
[40:40] i'll just be the preacher in the gospel
[40:42] but number seven uh god worked unusual
[40:46] miracles through paul's hands and also
[40:48] the cloths that were
[40:50] a part of his body touched by his body
[40:52] those are wonders
[40:55] and then eighth he resurrects eutychus
[40:57] eunice fell out of the second floor
[40:59] building was dead they come and prayed
[41:01] for him they raised him up he's a
[41:02] long-winded preacher that night amen but
[41:04] god raised up raised it from the dead
[41:06] praise god
[41:08] that's great miracle
[41:10] next in acts chapter 28 paul shook up
[41:12] off a viper off his hand and threw it in
[41:14] the fire that's a wonder
[41:16] wonder why he should have died they
[41:18] thought he was a god right
[41:22] and then paul heals the father of
[41:24] publius uh his bloody flux and he healed
[41:26] many more on the island of molita so
[41:29] just a
[41:30] island revival that he had divine
[41:31] healing
[41:33] 10 americans i'm going to say paul is my
[41:35] lead by god amen amen
[41:38] that's what he said remember colossians
[41:39] 1 from part 1
[41:41] he says he has christ in him the hope of
[41:43] glory i labor so he still labored
[41:47] striving according to god's working
[41:50] so he had so many miracles but he would
[41:52] still preach
[41:53] warn and teach every man in all wisdom
[41:56] so his life just wasn't all miracle
[41:58] today miracle tomorrow his life had
[42:01] miracles scattered around but every day
[42:03] the bible said he would open up his
[42:04] apartment there in acts chapter 28 and
[42:06] for a year and a half i believe he just
[42:08] took in everyone that wanted to hear the
[42:09] gospel he'd warn them he'd teach them
[42:12] it's still the same power of god
[42:14] amen still the same mighty god amen
[42:18] in between mighty miracle signs and
[42:20] wonders he was constantly warning
[42:21] teaching preaching just being faithful
[42:23] to the gifts of god in his life that was
[42:25] still mighty because he said it's christ
[42:28] working in me mightily praise god amen
[42:30] amen amen and that's what jesus is doing
[42:33] in your life he's working in you
[42:35] mightily
[42:37] should have heard louder amen
[42:40] there we go that's better i'll take that
[42:42] that's better
[42:43] he's worked just be encouraged he's
[42:45] working in you mightily he has something
[42:47] he's accomplishing praise god amen
[42:50] remember just remember that illustration
[42:51] he's building you up he's as you wait
[42:53] upon the lord you're getting stronger
[42:54] and then he's going to release his power
[42:55] amen
[42:57] just waiting for the next miracle praise
[42:58] god like i told brother austin alina
[43:00] just hang around one of these services
[43:01] there's going to be america praise god
[43:03] amen give me a sign god's going to come
[43:04] through the window or god's going to
[43:06] heal somebody fill somebody with the
[43:07] holy ghost or god's going to do
[43:08] something praise god but we're storing
[43:10] up power we're storing up strength and
[43:12] then god will pour on his grace finally
[43:14] towards us
[43:16] because he's working in me day after day
[43:17] week after week month after month year
[43:19] after year decade after decade he's
[43:22] working in me mightily he's working in
[43:24] us mightily to accomplish his will for
[43:26] this generation amen
[43:29] amen amen all those who were born again
[43:31] and on their way to being born again as
[43:33] we saw with apollos
[43:35] god's working in us mightily
[43:40] now here's some people might start
[43:42] questioning paul's might
[43:44] here in acts 23 paul's before
[43:46] some jewish leaders
[43:49] and paul reviles the high priest and he
[43:51] didn't know it
[43:53] kind of just rebuked him a little bit
[43:55] and what'd they do they smacked paul
[43:57] right on the face
[43:59] and paul said oh i didn't know i didn't
[44:02] know he was the high priest
[44:04] right
[44:07] now but look at the power of god
[44:09] look at the power of god in him he did
[44:11] not fight them back
[44:14] when was the last time you were smacked
[44:16] across the base or beat up and you
[44:17] didn't punch him back
[44:20] see we we love the viper and the fire we
[44:22] love the viper we love the jailhouse and
[44:25] uh we love that but here still the
[44:28] mighty power of god was flowing through
[44:30] the prophet amen
[44:31] to take a slap and just say i didn't
[44:33] know it
[44:34] i didn't know and the next scripture in
[44:37] the bible said god gave him a word to
[44:39] divide the mob so he could get away
[44:41] he says i was a pharisee of the
[44:42] pharisees those said she's like what you
[44:44] believe in angels you believe in
[44:45] resurrection let's fight about that and
[44:47] so paul is able to get away
[44:49] fight each day will live and fight
[44:50] another day praise god
[44:52] hallelujah mighty man
[44:54] he said it works in me mightily praise
[44:56] god
[44:58] and even if somebody says something bad
[44:59] about me on facebook or on instagram or
[45:02] twitter or whatever
[45:04] you can still there with love forgive
[45:06] them and pray for them praise god
[45:09] even if it's smacking you on the face
[45:10] because that's what jesus said he said
[45:12] when you show love let turn the other
[45:14] teeth to them so they can smite the
[45:15] other cheek and we're not told that paul
[45:17] got smacked twice but we know he got
[45:19] smacked at least once
[45:21] and he did not smite him back
[45:24] we're talking about mighty new testament
[45:25] believers how many believe you are
[45:26] you're one of those by god's name i
[45:28] believe you are praise god if you stood
[45:29] this long you're mighty in the word of
[45:30] god amen amen
[45:32] your mighty in the gifts god is place in
[45:34] your life praise god
[45:36] and just build up the power
[45:38] keep exercising those spiritual muscles
[45:40] praise god
[45:41] god's gonna use them
[45:47] paul says we have this treasure the holy
[45:49] ghost and earth and vessels that the
[45:52] excellency of the power may be of god
[45:54] and not us so when i say when i say
[45:56] you're mighty i'm not talking about your
[45:57] power i'm talking about the holy ghost
[45:58] inside
[46:00] no he was mighty paul was mighty we
[46:02] believe it but yet he had trouble on
[46:05] every side of him
[46:07] right
[46:09] not some sides every side
[46:11] so he had trouble after church now he's
[46:13] probably enjoying the preaching right
[46:15] but he had trouble after church
[46:18] he had trouble with being robbed there's
[46:20] a whole other scripture that talks about
[46:22] that he was robbed so many times he had
[46:23] trouble traveling there's always some
[46:25] trouble traveling
[46:27] ships sinking and all kinds just awful
[46:30] awful things
[46:32] trouble everywhere he looked there was
[46:34] trouble
[46:35] yet he would not let himself be
[46:37] distressed no matter how much trouble
[46:39] there was he wasn't going to lose hope
[46:42] why because he had something mighty
[46:44] inside amen
[46:46] god was still working mightily in him he
[46:48] said it works in me mightily
[46:52] despite troubles
[46:54] everywhere i look i got troubles on my
[46:55] phone i got troubles at the job i got
[46:57] troubles at my house i got troubles at
[46:59] the church no matter where he went no
[47:01] matter where the troubles were he never
[47:03] let the troubles overcome the power of
[47:05] god in his life
[47:09] he was perplexed wow sometimes the
[47:11] prophet didn't understand what god was
[47:13] doing in his life that's what he said
[47:15] i'm perplexed
[47:17] i'm not sure exactly what i don't know
[47:19] what the next step is remember remember
[47:20] brother said that
[47:22] i don't know what the next step is
[47:24] he says you think you got a lot of
[47:25] pressure think about me millions of
[47:27] people are watching me as a prophet
[47:30] so he said it makes me in desperation
[47:33] the message desperation 63 right
[47:36] preached on that a couple months ago
[47:38] we're perplexed but we don't get in
[47:40] despair
[47:41] amen oh i don't want to live anymore
[47:44] right i don't want to go on i don't want
[47:46] to
[47:47] we got to overcome that by god's grace
[47:50] and we can why because we've got a
[47:52] treasure in our hearts amen
[47:55] we've got something more valuable inside
[47:57] of us praise god
[47:59] like we say in that song when we come
[48:01] into god's presence we're richer than
[48:03] all
[48:04] amen
[48:05] there it kings
[48:06] the treasure that we have and earth and
[48:08] vessels were more rich because it's
[48:10] heavenly riches it's eternal riches and
[48:13] not riches that are eaten up by moth and
[48:16] destroyed and corrupted by dust we've
[48:18] got eternal treasure church we ought to
[48:20] praise god that we've got such riches in
[48:22] our souls praise god
[48:24] amen amen
[48:26] the power of god
[48:28] that won't let you give up
[48:30] that won't let you be perplexed or
[48:32] despair or distressed the power of god
[48:36] keeps you from that amen
[48:38] you can even be persecuted but you know
[48:41] i'm never forsaken
[48:45] i can be cast out i can feel like all my
[48:47] hopes are thrown down but i'm not
[48:49] destroyed i'm getting back up
[48:53] you might have failed and the devil
[48:54] might have kicked you and beat you down
[48:56] but don't stay down praise god
[48:58] get up in jesus name praise god amen get
[49:02] up stand up praise god
[49:05] fight the good fight of faith that
[49:06] mighty man of valor get up and show the
[49:08] devil that you're you can take a punt
[49:10] and you can keep fighting praise god
[49:14] amen
[49:17] you know you seen all those boxers
[49:18] brother william they'll walk out with
[49:19] these big huge muscles that's right and
[49:21] then they get one punch and they're
[49:22] knocked out you know that's not what we
[49:24] want to be
[49:26] they all
[49:27] act like they're so big you
[49:29] just let them get hit a couple times all
[49:31] your strategy goes out the window they
[49:32] say
[49:34] but see we should be able to be knocked
[49:35] down or don't stay down
[49:38] don't feel bad for too long encourage
[49:41] yourself amen i tell you
[49:43] hallelujah god's going to come he's
[49:45] going to raise you up praise god amen
[49:48] get back up fight the good fight of
[49:49] faith praise god you are not destroyed
[49:52] you are not forsaken god is with him
[49:54] amen the lord is with you praise
[49:58] see i'm not trying to teach you that i'm
[49:59] trying to preach the gospel i mean
[50:02] priest means declare
[50:03] i'm trying to declare all your power
[50:05] that god has inside of you amen
[50:08] always paul said i'm bearing inside this
[50:10] load always i'm bearing about in my body
[50:13] the dying of jesus see as we get older
[50:16] our bodies get older and we're getting
[50:18] older in age and we realize when we may
[50:19] die at some point here that's actually
[50:21] showing the death of christ that's right
[50:25] see because even though we're dying
[50:26] we're still acting like jesus
[50:29] jesus knew he would die so he was
[50:30] obedient unto death praise god if god
[50:33] allows us to die we must be obedient
[50:35] unto death amen but still act like jesus
[50:39] keep the faith keep the commands of god
[50:42] we should say this let thy will be done
[50:44] not my will be done amen hallelujah as
[50:47] we get older
[50:49] always
[50:50] bear this about in our bodies
[50:52] that as i get older i i feel like i'm
[50:54] dying well that's what jesus did so i
[50:56] can be like him
[50:58] see we die who art like paul said i die
[51:00] daily we die that the life of jesus
[51:03] might be made manifest in our body
[51:07] for we which live are always delivered
[51:09] unto death for jesus sake
[51:12] that the life also of jesus might be
[51:15] made manifest
[51:16] in our mortal flesh
[51:19] so we die we're dying physically right
[51:21] as we get older we die physically
[51:22] but each day we're supposed to die
[51:24] spiritually
[51:26] in order to let christ manifest himself
[51:29] in our flesh amen church don't you just
[51:32] long for someone to say i see jesus in
[51:34] you oh yeah yes
[51:36] is that just a wonderful thing when
[51:37] someone says i see jesus
[51:39] we got our we got our uh uh
[51:41] our septic pump this week you know
[51:43] because we have a we have a well and we
[51:45] have a septic system so we don't get we
[51:46] don't have city water in other words so
[51:48] we got to get rid of all the waste you
[51:49] know
[51:50] and so i i'd walk out there i talked to
[51:52] the young guy named daniel he's probably
[51:53] 30 or something like that
[51:56] and as he was leaving he's like
[51:58] he's like hey i just want to say i
[51:59] appreciate your shirt i assured all this
[52:01] at christ and had a cross a crown on it
[52:03] christ the king you know
[52:05] he's like oh yeah i said oh yeah praise
[52:07] the lord jesus give my mom a cancer
[52:08] around that whole spiel again you know
[52:10] let me know all about that i always want
[52:12] to be the first thing i always testify
[52:14] you know
[52:14] but i've seen my generation
[52:17] and i said yeah i preached the gospel
[52:18] he's like i knew that as soon as i saw
[52:20] you i there's something to write about
[52:21] you different i knew you were a preacher
[52:23] that's right
[52:24] and i just got a t-shirt on i got these
[52:26] baggy pants on i got like these shoes
[52:29] my hair's not combed
[52:31] i hope i brushed my teeth that day
[52:34] but all i did was smile and say hi to
[52:36] daniel welcome
[52:38] austin was smiling he said i knew from
[52:39] the moment i saw you jesus was on you
[52:42] amen
[52:43] that's what that dean guy said to the
[52:44] doctor's office too he said i knew jesus
[52:47] was i knew you were a christian right
[52:48] when i saw you
[52:49] so i don't know what it is they must see
[52:50] in other dimensions i don't see that
[52:52] very often
[52:53] just like the pastor's wife told me she
[52:54] said the first time i met you i knew
[52:56] you're going to be a preacher just a kid
[52:58] told my wife that i didn't know that
[53:01] but it's it's the power of christ it's
[53:03] the prophecy on our lives we have gifts
[53:06] in our lives and then praise god and if
[53:08] we could see in that other dimension
[53:09] we'd see them praise god and sometimes
[53:11] god gives us a glimpse in that dimension
[53:13] that's right that's right and we know
[53:15] this person is called for this this
[53:16] person's called for that
[53:18] god's gifted them with this faith god's
[53:20] gifted them with this wisdom or this
[53:22] knowledge or this understanding praise
[53:24] god amen
[53:26] but if we die to ourselves and we die to
[53:28] our sinful desires the power of christ
[53:30] will manifest in our lives amen
[53:35] now i love what brother brown says about
[53:36] paul i preached this years ago over in
[53:38] that sanctuary
[53:41] in the book of acts paul got to a spot
[53:43] where
[53:44] uh
[53:45] the coppersmith
[53:46] was against paul and paul actually left
[53:49] the city i don't remember what city it
[53:50] was but brother ram picks it up and says
[53:53] demas uh
[53:55] saw that paul didn't smite the man blind
[53:57] because he wanted to didn't jesus say i
[53:59] do nothing until the father shows me
[54:01] first
[54:03] bill ramsey says haven't i told you
[54:04] years ago with my own mother was dying
[54:07] laying dying would say bill what's my
[54:08] outcome i couldn't say nothing until god
[54:11] said so first
[54:13] and that's just what happened man can't
[54:15] man is a failure to begin with he's only
[54:17] an agent to work god's works through and
[54:19] god works his own will
[54:21] but when you see these super-duper
[54:23] people that always having this and that
[54:25] the other you better stay away from them
[54:28] in other words when somebody says oh
[54:29] i've always got the word of god i've
[54:31] always got a supernatural i've always
[54:32] got super duper faith but i said you
[54:34] leave that guy alone
[54:36] because brother adam said i couldn't
[54:37] even tell my mom what was going to
[54:38] happen if she's going to live or die
[54:40] because i'm waiting on god
[54:44] see that's why i thought the message
[54:45] movement that called themselves the
[54:46] greatest ever
[54:48] when they see a man say someone's going
[54:49] to get healed and they die i just
[54:51] thought that would wake them up
[54:53] but apparently it hasn't so i still got
[54:55] to send my letters something i do this
[54:57] summer that's
[54:58] i got to put that higher am i to do this
[54:59] but i still send those letters out i
[55:01] just want to say it real humbly though
[55:03] see we can't do anything until god says
[55:05] it
[55:06] right we know there's power laying there
[55:08] but god's the one who turns the faucet
[55:10] on and off
[55:11] it's when it's his time not our time we
[55:13] can plead for we can ask for it but it's
[55:15] god's determining
[55:18] he said see jesus himself didn't do that
[55:20] he said i only work as the father works
[55:22] he shows me what to do and then i go do
[55:24] it i can't do anything otherwise than
[55:26] that that's right and here demons saw
[55:28] paul a man that had a ministry like that
[55:30] could smite people blood yep so poor he
[55:33] only owned one coat
[55:35] and wanted timothy to bring it to him
[55:36] one coat but paul set the example like
[55:39] christ loved amen amen
[55:41] and one quote then why does riches and
[55:43] lots of money and things mean so much to
[55:45] people today
[55:46] why do big churches and big fancy
[55:48] buildings and big crowds why does that
[55:50] mean so much today because it's laodicea
[55:53] and people have the label to see in
[55:55] spirit
[55:56] right
[55:57] now notice
[55:58] and he had power to anybody that was
[56:00] contrary to what he preached he turned
[56:02] around and said you'd be blind for a
[56:03] season and the man was blind and here
[56:05] was the coppersmith done 10 times to him
[56:07] what that man done and yet got away with
[56:09] it demas must have thought well see that
[56:11] old fellow is washed up now he's lost
[56:13] his ministry no no he hadn't lost his
[56:15] ministry not at all god don't do things
[56:17] like that god's not an indian giver yeah
[56:20] notice now
[56:22] so see church i just want you to see
[56:23] that paul would have times where god
[56:25] would pour out his power and then times
[56:27] he didn't sure he would sit there
[56:29] perplexed and be like how is this going
[56:31] to work out how is the church i better
[56:33] get to praying
[56:34] right because he said i always prayed
[56:36] for the philippians i always pray for
[56:37] you colossians he'd have times where i'm
[56:39] perplexed what is the situation going to
[56:41] turn out to be but god would always
[56:43] direct him back to prayer amen
[56:45] and god would work in him mightily
[56:48] through his prayer life
[56:50] amen hallelujah
[56:52] and at the end of his life he said i'm
[56:54] ready now to be offered as a sacrifice
[56:56] remember church he was beheaded remember
[56:58] i showed you that list on wednesday
[56:59] night he was beheaded for the gospel
[57:02] he knew his time of departure was at
[57:04] hand
[57:04] but he could say i fought a good fight
[57:08] in other words i've given the best fight
[57:09] i could give god
[57:11] i've left it all out like we say when we
[57:13] play leave it all on the field
[57:15] you shouldn't have all this energy after
[57:17] the game you should leave it all in the
[57:18] field
[57:19] right that's what they that's what they
[57:20] tell us to do sometimes that was
[57:22] most time we won so much i always had
[57:24] extra energy
[57:25] we just blew out the competition but
[57:27] when you're fighting in the christian
[57:28] battle praise god give all you have
[57:30] praise god in church like we saw with
[57:32] those preachers some will fight all the
[57:34] way till death
[57:35] they'll like i'm sure those brothers
[57:37] confess i'm healed i'm healed i'm healed
[57:39] but then it was their time to go
[57:40] god pulled their car brother said god
[57:42] pulled their cart off the rack it says
[57:43] time to come home now
[57:45] angels take this car down get my servant
[57:47] and bring him up to heaven
[57:51] it's your time to come back come back
[57:53] home i'm home praise god
[57:56] i fought a good fight i finished my
[57:57] course i've kept the faith
[58:00] henceforth there's laid out for me a
[58:01] crown of righteousness which the lord
[58:03] the righteous judge shall give me at
[58:04] that day and not to me only but to all
[58:06] them also that love is appearing
[58:09] praise god
[58:11] so paul said it works in me mightily how
[58:13] did it work and how did it work in him
[58:14] mightily through his everyday trials and
[58:17] battles
[58:18] in the good times church and the hard
[58:20] times that's right i like when jose
[58:22] sings that he's god of the mountain he's
[58:25] still got into that you sing it to you
[58:27] right here you've all seen that
[58:29] i like that
[58:30] that's what he does that's what his
[58:32] power is for his powers for the
[58:34] mountains he can feel like you're on a
[58:35] mountaintop i'm so close to headed but
[58:38] his power is also from the valley i feel
[58:40] so far away from god but i know he's
[58:41] moving in me praise god amen i know he's
[58:44] accomplishing something in this
[58:45] situation praise god i'm going to hang
[58:47] on to christ with all that i have amen
[58:50] hallelujah
[58:52] whether i'm perplexed i feel cast down i
[58:55] feel forsaken i feel stressed distressed
[58:59] remember the mighty men what they have
[59:01] they were stressed out they had a bunch
[59:03] of debts and they were bitter against
[59:04] everybody
[59:06] and god can take a bitter stressed out
[59:09] indebted individual and raise them up
[59:11] into a mighty man or woman
[59:13] that's what my god does
[59:15] that's what your god does amen
[59:22] he's got enemies to drive out church
[59:24] there's enemies god wants to drive out
[59:26] today but he needs mighty men and women
[59:28] that are delivered from bitterness
[59:29] they're delivered from their deaths
[59:31] they're delivered from stress that's who
[59:33] god wants to use today to get victories
[59:35] for the kingdom of god amen
[59:38] hallelujah
[59:42] and we're slowly but surely get him out
[59:44] of debt aren't we brother
[59:46] jesus slowly and there's more to come by
[59:48] god's grace i believe that
[59:50] there's more to come
[59:52] he's got to trust god god all we're
[59:54] going to do is ask god
[59:56] amen do everything we can do like paul i
[59:58] like what paul said paul said uh
[1:00:01] paul told philemon he said put
[1:00:03] onesimus's debt on my account
[1:00:07] that's a real christian right there
[1:00:09] a christian will put someone else's debt
[1:00:11] on their account
[1:00:13] so may god lead us may god help us
[1:00:17] he fought to the end church
[1:00:19] i want to look at a little bit more here
[1:00:20] i got i didn't preach the hour yet can
[1:00:22] you do that
[1:00:23] i still got eight minutes on my hour
[1:00:26] paul gives five things that if you want
[1:00:28] to be a mighty man now i'm going to
[1:00:30] speak kind of directly to the brothers
[1:00:31] but sisters don't uh uh don't go to
[1:00:33] sleep on me if i got you guys
[1:00:35] uh you can you can get a lot of insight
[1:00:37] from this as well now remember my palace
[1:00:39] was right there when he wrote this
[1:00:42] he says watch ye corinthians watch stand
[1:00:45] fast in the faith
[1:00:46] quit you like men
[1:00:48] be strong
[1:00:49] let all things be done with charity amen
[1:00:52] we looked at that a few weeks ago right
[1:00:54] charity hopes all things charity
[1:00:56] believes all things charity endures all
[1:00:59] things
[1:01:00] the greatest of all these anointings is
[1:01:02] charity praise god
[1:01:05] is love
[1:01:06] in other words if you want to be a
[1:01:07] mighty man or a mighty woman of god we
[1:01:09] need the love of god in our hearts
[1:01:12] i love it all these you know what's the
[1:01:14] greatest commandment love the lord your
[1:01:16] god
[1:01:17] what's the whole duty of man to love god
[1:01:19] keep his commands
[1:01:21] how do i be a man do all things with
[1:01:23] love
[1:01:24] love
[1:01:25] love for jesus and love for his people
[1:01:29] so i don't want to be godly man i got
[1:01:31] one two three that's right five six
[1:01:34] seven all right i'm gonna count zion two
[1:01:36] there's eight gear
[1:01:38] godly men do these five things they
[1:01:40] watch
[1:01:42] they watch
[1:01:44] they stand fast
[1:01:46] they're brave
[1:01:49] and they're strong
[1:01:50] and they do all this with love
[1:01:53] hallelujah
[1:01:55] so brothers we don't have to wonder
[1:01:57] what are the requirements of being a man
[1:01:58] right here
[1:02:00] gotta do all these
[1:02:02] and i just had a few moments here this
[1:02:03] thought kind of came fresh to me last
[1:02:04] night to get a chance to really study
[1:02:05] this out all the way so i may preach a
[1:02:07] part four on this later but we'll see
[1:02:09] watch the body jesus said watch and pray
[1:02:12] right
[1:02:14] watch the spiritual skies now we always
[1:02:16] watch the natural sky it's gonna rain
[1:02:17] today what's gonna do but we need to
[1:02:18] watch the spiritual state that's why we
[1:02:20] watch the united states government
[1:02:21] right that's why we pray
[1:02:24] also watch for the roaring lion paul
[1:02:26] said he's like a roaring lion seeking
[1:02:28] whom he may devour
[1:02:31] and also the man in israel would be
[1:02:34] watchmen on the watchtowers
[1:02:37] so watching for enemies to come in so we
[1:02:39] need our brothers and especially
[1:02:40] husbands and dads
[1:02:43] especially we must have eyes to make
[1:02:46] sure there's no evil getting into our
[1:02:47] lives that's right
[1:02:49] as a preacher pastor i got to watch make
[1:02:51] sure no evil's getting the church
[1:02:53] yeah
[1:02:54] right
[1:02:56] that's what a man does he watches out
[1:02:58] for other people and the church said
[1:03:00] amen he takes care of other people
[1:03:05] not just himself he takes care of others
[1:03:10] second you're to stand fast paul said be
[1:03:12] unmovable in the work of the lord in
[1:03:14] other words when god has revealed his
[1:03:16] ministry for your life you just stand in
[1:03:18] it don't quit we see too many people
[1:03:20] quit and give up
[1:03:22] not in our church but other churches
[1:03:24] you think oh they believe the message
[1:03:25] for that many years and they quit and
[1:03:26] give up
[1:03:27] they don't do that anymore how come that
[1:03:29] brother's not preaching anymore he quit
[1:03:31] you gave up
[1:03:33] why would you give up
[1:03:34] we're supposed to stand fast praise god
[1:03:36] if you gain some ground if someone
[1:03:38] trusts you to be in the pulpit stay in
[1:03:40] the pulpit praise god just clean out
[1:03:42] your life amen
[1:03:44] someone trust you to give you some type
[1:03:46] of a position or some type of
[1:03:47] responsibility
[1:03:49] stand fast in that praise god
[1:03:52] husbands fathers stand fast in the work
[1:03:54] of the lord be stable
[1:03:58] right we've talked to different friends
[1:03:59] the one thing they wish they had in life
[1:04:00] was stability i'm glad we got stability
[1:04:02] here
[1:04:04] we're not going anywhere we're standing
[1:04:05] on the word of god hallelujah it's a joy
[1:04:07] to stand for jesus amen
[1:04:09] now paul said when you've done all to do
[1:04:12] with the armor of god he said do one
[1:04:14] thing just stand
[1:04:16] in other words don't sit down don't go
[1:04:18] to sleep don't give up don't be lazy
[1:04:21] don't get distracted don't be lukewarm
[1:04:24] stand be at your post of duty be ready
[1:04:26] to run amen
[1:04:28] be ready to fight this is what godly men
[1:04:31] do this is what real men do
[1:04:33] they watch they stand
[1:04:36] and they're very brave
[1:04:38] like like joshua said be thou strong and
[1:04:41] very courageous
[1:04:44] see you're brave because you met someone
[1:04:46] greater than your adversary
[1:04:49] hallelujah
[1:04:50] you're brave and situated in public
[1:04:52] situations because you've already been
[1:04:53] the presence of somebody greater than
[1:04:55] your enemy praise god that's jesus amen
[1:04:58] you fear god only
[1:05:01] you don't fear man you don't fear the
[1:05:02] boss
[1:05:04] praise god
[1:05:05] you don't fear the woman or man at the
[1:05:07] gas station
[1:05:09] you don't feel the septic system man
[1:05:12] you don't feel the electrician or the
[1:05:13] plumber you don't you don't fear them
[1:05:15] because god is with you you're very
[1:05:17] brave praise god
[1:05:19] mighty men and women
[1:05:23] and he said be strong
[1:05:25] remember satan comes to weaken you but
[1:05:27] the holy spirit's here to strengthen you
[1:05:29] amen
[1:05:30] so see just keep your mind out of
[1:05:32] anything that's satanic right which
[1:05:33] would be any sin just keep your mind out
[1:05:35] of any sin
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:37] and keep your mind on the things of god
[1:05:39] and god will strengthen you praise god
[1:05:42] you won't get weaker
[1:05:44] you'll get stronger by the grace of man
[1:05:48] and then do all things in love
[1:05:50] charity can do all things how many still
[1:05:52] believe you can do all things through
[1:05:54] christ who strengthened you amen
[1:05:56] i can do it
[1:05:58] through christ
[1:05:59] i can't do it myself but i have access
[1:06:02] to power so i can do this
[1:06:05] i can do all things through christ i can
[1:06:07] be a godly man
[1:06:10] how do you believe that
[1:06:12] i'm going to go over a couple more
[1:06:13] things here i didn't get this one on the
[1:06:14] slideshow i came across this thought i
[1:06:16] heard a preacher say i'm going to go
[1:06:17] ahead and preach this
[1:06:19] if you are a man that means you're not a
[1:06:21] woman
[1:06:25] women are called by god to be followers
[1:06:28] of the man
[1:06:29] so brothers we can't be followers of our
[1:06:32] wives
[1:06:34] families or the society we've got to be
[1:06:35] leaders
[1:06:37] praise god
[1:06:38] amen we've got to say follow me because
[1:06:40] i've already been there amen
[1:06:43] i've already been there in prayer i've
[1:06:46] already seen it in the word i've already
[1:06:48] seen it in that brother's life but this
[1:06:49] brother i've already seen it follow me
[1:06:51] praise god
[1:06:52] amen
[1:06:55] that's right
[1:06:58] all right like when we go to baptize
[1:06:59] people i usually like to be the first
[1:07:00] one down there i just say follow me
[1:07:02] everybody
[1:07:03] excuse me can we remember we have this
[1:07:05] moment and we go certain places
[1:07:06] sometimes i like to be right at the
[1:07:08] front
[1:07:08] if i can
[1:07:10] because i want to lead the way i don't
[1:07:11] want there to be any confusion i don't
[1:07:13] want to be any uh misunderstanding
[1:07:17] right
[1:07:18] we want to lead because we're men we
[1:07:20] should be leaders by the grace of god
[1:07:22] we should find the leading of god for
[1:07:24] our lives hallelujah for our families
[1:07:27] for our marriages
[1:07:29] amen
[1:07:32] yes god anoints women mightily as we
[1:07:34] said we believe that priscilla woman at
[1:07:36] the well there's so many examples mary
[1:07:39] look at that
[1:07:40] she had more faith in zachariah a
[1:07:42] teenage girl had more faith than an old
[1:07:43] man a priest
[1:07:45] right
[1:07:47] he got his he got his uh his mouth
[1:07:49] became dumb he couldn't talk because he
[1:07:51] died of the angel but mary believed the
[1:07:52] angel all right teenager
[1:07:55] doesn't matter your age it matters your
[1:07:57] faith amen that's right that's what
[1:07:59] matters
[1:08:01] now peter told us in first peter 3 that
[1:08:03] brothers we must understand our wives
[1:08:05] and give honor to our wives
[1:08:08] so real man understands god made me
[1:08:10] stronger with these gifts i also have a
[1:08:13] higher calling of responsibility but i
[1:08:15] still understand them and i'm still show
[1:08:17] them honor
[1:08:20] right physically men are usually
[1:08:21] stronger than women usually there are
[1:08:23] some strong ones i saw in the olympics a
[1:08:25] few years ago
[1:08:26] i wouldn't mess with them
[1:08:31] but god gives us men here we're to
[1:08:33] understand our wives and give honor to
[1:08:36] them
[1:08:38] so men let's be men let's not be women
[1:08:41] let's act like men
[1:08:44] second man don't be a beast
[1:08:46] because bees act upon instinct
[1:08:50] and they only they only act for
[1:08:52] themselves they're so selfish yeah i
[1:08:54] watched a video of a lion one time a
[1:08:55] lion is an old male lion and he had like
[1:08:58] these numerous women uh
[1:09:00] female line lionesses
[1:09:02] and all these cubs
[1:09:04] and so the mother cubs would go out and
[1:09:06] kill the meat and then the dad would go
[1:09:08] out there and he'd eat all the good meat
[1:09:10] and then let everybody else eat the rest
[1:09:12] i thought that's not really the right
[1:09:13] example
[1:09:15] he's a beast right yeah right there's my
[1:09:18] hour
[1:09:22] i thought that's just uh that's not
[1:09:24] really the way it should go a man should
[1:09:26] get out there and do the work praise god
[1:09:28] and then he should share with everybody
[1:09:30] praise god
[1:09:32] jesus said the greatest among you is
[1:09:34] your
[1:09:35] servant
[1:09:37] but he was but that lion said i get the
[1:09:39] first i'm always first i'm always first
[1:09:41] me me me me but rap said you're third
[1:09:43] brothers
[1:09:44] god family me he said

[1:09:50] right
[1:09:51] you're always going to come in third
[1:09:53] let god come in first amen that your
[1:09:55] wife and family come in second brothers
[1:09:57] you come in third amen
[1:09:59] hallelujah
[1:10:00] yeah beasts act upon instinct and beasts
[1:10:02] eat their own some animals eat their own
[1:10:04] children yeah
[1:10:06] yeah
[1:10:07] some of the moms got to protect the the
[1:10:09] babies from the decks
[1:10:11] that's beastly
[1:10:12] right right it's all about them
[1:10:15] it's all about instinct what i need
[1:10:16] right now i gotta have it right now but
[1:10:18] see when you're a real child of god
[1:10:19] you're patient praise god
[1:10:22] you don't move on your fleshly instincts
[1:10:24] you move on the will of god
[1:10:26] hey that's a real
[1:10:27] real man here now right amen
[1:10:31] strong
[1:10:32] full of charity praise god

[1:13:38] hallelujah amen
[1:13:41] i got some amens from the brothers

[1:13:48] clothes i got
[1:13:49] 10 minutes on my 15 minutes let me close
[1:13:51] this first chronicles 12. if you've got
[1:13:52] your bible you don't have to give me one
[1:13:53] two
[1:13:55] this is before david is king over hebron
[1:13:58] so right after saul dies remember the
[1:14:00] mighty men have already come to him but
[1:14:02] he gets as time goes on remember the
[1:14:03] memory verse he gets greater and greater
[1:14:05] right girls
[1:14:07] david wax greater and greater because
[1:14:09] who is with him who is with david
[1:14:21] so as
[1:14:22] as he was a fugitive david was he was a
[1:14:25] he was a law breaker
[1:14:26] the government was after him he was
[1:14:28] running from solace is a fatherless a
[1:14:30] fugitive
[1:14:32] remember there's that that i have to
[1:14:33] find that one in psalms he said i'm like
[1:14:35] a bird that's being hunted down i'm like
[1:14:37] a prey being shot at and i'm like a bird
[1:14:40] church he's like flying from he's he's
[1:14:42] running from cave to cave from house to
[1:14:44] house that's no way to live
[1:14:48] yet in the midst of that remember he was
[1:14:49] training up mighty men as well the
[1:14:51] church don't tell me uh you and i we
[1:14:54] should not complain if we're going
[1:14:55] through trials god can still make us
[1:14:56] mighty in the midst of ourselves
[1:14:58] there is no excuse if david can raise up
[1:15:00] 300 or 400 mighty men
[1:15:02] while running for his life what can we
[1:15:04] do amen when we're not running for any
[1:15:06] physical life
[1:15:07] we're just having mind battles or you're
[1:15:10] getting sick
[1:15:12] he was literally running for his life
[1:15:14] and still the midst of that could raise
[1:15:16] up and teach this is how your hands wore
[1:15:18] that's right this is how your fingers
[1:15:19] this is how your feet do not slip like
[1:15:21] you said last week
[1:15:22] hey man i'm not slipping every place i
[1:15:25] step is going to be exactly the right
[1:15:26] step i won't fall down the enemy won't
[1:15:29] have me on a lower position i'll stand
[1:15:31] for christ because i'm standing on
[1:15:33] christ the solid rock
[1:15:35] that's why my foot stays dead
[1:15:41] [Applause]
[1:15:45] every time i make a step it's in line
[1:15:46] with the word
[1:15:48] that's how i know my foot won't slip
[1:15:50] amen that's how i know the enemy won't
[1:15:52] defeat me
[1:15:53] because i'm stepping where the word says
[1:15:55] to step praise god
[1:15:59] so no matter what we're going through
[1:16:00] church we can be strong and we can be
[1:16:02] mighty
[1:16:03] no matter the struggle that we're going
[1:16:05] through god god is making i'm going to
[1:16:06] say like this god is making us stronger
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:10] i was i was shaking the first rose hand
[1:16:11] god is making you more mighty amen amen
[1:16:15] he is making you more mighty right to
[1:16:17] these the ones up close he's making you
[1:16:19] more mighty amen it's just through the
[1:16:21] daily battles as you as you go against
[1:16:25] the devil as you defeat the devil you're
[1:16:26] getting stronger every single day amen
[1:16:29] every day
[1:16:32] yeah you might run from that problem you
[1:16:34] try to escape this this temptation you
[1:16:36] might be running all the time but still
[1:16:38] make time to stop and pray
[1:16:40] stop and praise the lord stop and get in
[1:16:42] this presence remember you've got a
[1:16:44] treasure in you that the kings of the
[1:16:45] earth don't have amen
[1:16:48] the treasure of his presence amen
[1:16:51] kings don't have it
[1:16:53] kings remember the kings of the earth
[1:16:54] they're going to be bird food now we
[1:16:55] appreciate that a few weeks ago they're
[1:16:56] going to be bird food
[1:16:58] that's what the mighty men that's what
[1:17:00] they turn into the worldly mighty men
[1:17:03] but not us we're going to be kings and
[1:17:05] priests unto god and we're going to rule
[1:17:07] on this earth for a thousand years
[1:17:11] praise god
[1:17:12] a thousand years
[1:17:14] ruling why because christ worked in us
[1:17:17] mightily praise god amen
[1:17:23] now
[1:17:24] in time there's a beautiful type
[1:17:28] in first chronicles 12 15 the bob said
[1:17:30] these are they that went over jordan the
[1:17:32] first month when it had overflown all
[1:17:33] his banks now notice this is
[1:17:35] hundreds of years after after joshua
[1:17:37] crossed jordan and now that time of year
[1:17:40] when it's overflowed like joshua's time
[1:17:44] had overflowed all the banks and they
[1:17:45] put to flight all them of the valleys
[1:17:48] both east and toward the west and there
[1:17:50] came by the children of benjamin and
[1:17:52] judah to the hold of david
[1:17:55] now look at this these men i love the
[1:17:57] picture
[1:17:59] these men had to cross over jordan how
[1:18:01] they do it church they swam
[1:18:03] there's no other way to get over jordan
[1:18:07] they didn't have an ark by the way they
[1:18:09] had no art to step in there and when
[1:18:10] they stepped in there the waters moved
[1:18:11] back they actually had to swing
[1:18:13] yeah
[1:18:15] well god you're the same yesterday today
[1:18:16] and forever why don't you just park to
[1:18:18] jordan because that was for a different
[1:18:19] time in season
[1:18:20] i'm doing something different now
[1:18:22] i'm not bringing you in i'm establishing
[1:18:24] a king amen
[1:18:26] i'm establishing a king who's after my
[1:18:27] own heart
[1:18:30] two different times different seasons
[1:18:31] different battles
[1:18:33] i want you to see the mighty men
[1:18:36] they swam across jordan
[1:18:38] they cross over jordan on their own
[1:18:41] accord
[1:18:42] the crossing of jordan is a type of the
[1:18:45] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:18:47] see they were mighty before look they
[1:18:49] were mighty before verse uh they'd
[1:18:51] already put to fly all these
[1:18:53] all these men
[1:18:54] they've already
[1:18:55] they're just like apollos they're
[1:18:56] already mighty the word amen
[1:18:59] but they said david is coming into power
[1:19:02] david's got the same anointing in fact
[1:19:04] anointing is greater on him it's on me
[1:19:06] but i see in david i see a greater man i
[1:19:09] see a mighty man he's coming into power
[1:19:12] let's go join up with him amen
[1:19:15] so what must we do we must cross over
[1:19:17] jordan into the baptism of the holy
[1:19:19] ghost praise god
[1:19:21] hallelujah
[1:19:22] i like what david says when he goes out
[1:19:24] to meet him these brothers just swam
[1:19:26] across the mighty jordan
[1:19:29] like me they'd be dog tired no doubt
[1:19:30] about that i'm not a good swimmer i
[1:19:32] almost drowned one time and god saved my
[1:19:33] life
[1:19:37] kept me from drowning uh pulled me up
[1:19:38] out of the waters pull me out of the
[1:19:40] waters yeah i'll forget what song that
[1:19:41] lesbian
[1:19:44] david goes out to meet these men to get
[1:19:46] the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:19:48] and he says if you come peacefully unto
[1:19:50] me my heart shall be meant to you knit
[1:19:52] to you rather knit to god
[1:19:55] if you're coming in peace our hearts
[1:19:57] will be sewn together we will have one
[1:19:59] heart there it is one heart and one soul
[1:20:02] just like the book of acts amen
[1:20:04] that one heart one soul
[1:20:07] but if you become to betray me to my
[1:20:09] enemies saying there is no wrong in my
[1:20:11] hands the god of our fathers look
[1:20:13] thereon and rebuke it
[1:20:16] if you're coming to join us praise god
[1:20:18] you'll be on the right side amen but if
[1:20:20] you fight against us he says you'll be
[1:20:22] cursed
[1:20:23] god will curse you because i'm innocent
[1:20:25] of the blood of all men
[1:20:27] what a place to be in a beautiful type
[1:20:29] of christ that's right
[1:20:30] whoever blesses jesus will be blessed
[1:20:33] whoever curses jesus will be cursed amen
[1:20:35] but don't you see yourself as one of
[1:20:37] those mighty men you're able to cross
[1:20:39] over an overflowing river you're able to
[1:20:42] cross over jordan you would go to any
[1:20:44] lengths to be on david's side you'll do
[1:20:46] anything you'll come across any obstacle
[1:20:49] you'll do anything so i can be on his
[1:20:51] side i just i know that david's coming
[1:20:54] into power i want to be on david's side
[1:20:56] he's not in power now but i want to be
[1:20:59] on the side and i wanted to use me for
[1:21:00] his kingdom's sake
[1:21:02] hallelujah
[1:21:04] and what was this answer
[1:21:06] verse 15 let's stand right for you
[1:21:10] david says if you're on my side
[1:21:14] you'll be blessed but if you come
[1:21:16] against me
[1:21:17] god's going to fight against you and
[1:21:18] rebuke you
[1:21:20] i love this then the holy see shall they
[1:21:23] cross jordan then the holy ghost comes
[1:21:24] on them see it the perfect day
[1:21:26] a perfect time in other words before you
[1:21:29] get the holy ghost jesus is going to say
[1:21:30] which side are you going to be on
[1:21:32] right just like cadence barney is that
[1:21:33] right brother
[1:21:34] gloria
[1:21:36] when it came to kadesh barnea they he
[1:21:38] still asked which side are you going to
[1:21:39] be on
[1:21:41] do you really want to go in the back to
[1:21:43] some holy ghost and fight these giants
[1:21:44] do you really want to go against that
[1:21:48] and these these men were so dedicated
[1:21:50] they're mighty men they fought many
[1:21:51] battles they killed many enemies many
[1:21:53] foes they defeated armies but they're
[1:21:56] able to swim across on their own they're
[1:21:57] able to cross over jordan
[1:22:00] and the holy ghost comes upon a messiah
[1:22:02] he was the chief he says we are yours
[1:22:05] david
[1:22:06] oh jesus i belong to you amen my whole
[1:22:09] life is yours amen i don't owe myself
[1:22:12] jesus owns me he bought me he purchased
[1:22:15] me amen with his own blood amen amen

[1:22:20] because i belong to jesus amen can i say
[1:22:24] this my body spirit and soul belong to
[1:22:26] you jesus amen amen
[1:22:29] that's what mighty men do
[1:22:30] that's what mighty women do
[1:22:32] amen they cross over jordan into the
[1:22:35] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:37] and they say i'm all yours jesus
[1:22:40] i'm on your side
[1:22:42] i will not be on the left side
[1:22:45] i won't be on the right side politically
[1:22:47] i'll be on jesus's side amen
[1:22:50] praise god
[1:22:52] i will be on thy side thou son of jesse
[1:22:56] peace peace the unto thee and peace be
[1:22:59] to thy helpers
