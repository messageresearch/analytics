[0:00] him back I think in March or April. And
[0:03] then the brother Austin, the new
[0:06] gentleman, he's going to preach for us
[0:07] next month. I want to invite him to
[0:08] preach and uh he's on the calendar for
[0:11] February by God's grace. So,
[0:14] amen. Let's bow our heads here.
[0:16] Lord God, we thank you for today. Thank
[0:18] you for the saints coming out to the
[0:20] house of the Lord. Bless them, Lord.
[0:21] Thank you for the faithful saints who uh
[0:23] go through the cold, Lord, to hear your
[0:25] word. Hallelujah. Lord, in other
[0:27] countries, they got to go through the
[0:28] heat to hear the word of the Lord, and
[0:30] they sit out in all the heat and sweat
[0:31] and uh Lord, we got a little bit of
[0:34] that, but we got the cold as well. So,
[0:36] bless your people, Lord God, for all the
[0:38] sacrifices they make, Lord God.
[0:40] Hallelujah. Thank you for the Holy
[0:41] Spirit that's here tonight, Lord God.
[0:43] Hallelujah. Thank you for the blood of
[0:45] Christ that was shed to forgive our
[0:47] sins, Lord, and could allow the Holy
[0:50] Spirit to fill our souls, Lord. We're
[0:51] thankful for that. We give you glory. We
[0:53] give you honor and praise, Lord God.
[0:55] Hallelujah. Take this service now, Lord.
[0:58] Use it for your glory. Hallelujah.
[1:00] Anoint our musicians. Anoint me. Anoint
[1:01] the people, Lord God. Hallelujah.
[1:04] Father, we want to lift these requests
[1:05] up before you, Lord God. We ask for
[1:07] healing for Kristen and Tulsi in Jesus
[1:09] Christ's name. Touch their bodies, Lord
[1:11] God. Please remember my wife's needs,
[1:13] Lord God. She labors so much. So
[1:15] strengthen her, I pray, God, in the name
[1:17] of Jesus. And let the baby be healed in
[1:20] Jesus name. Touch her body. Thank you
[1:22] for the blessings you have given us Lord
[1:24] God with the health Lord the improved
[1:26] health. We give you thanks and praise
[1:29] Lord. We just ask God Lord you'll
[1:32] minister to Austin and Alena Lord be
[1:33] with them Lord tonight Lord we pray Lord
[1:36] Jesus give our sister grace Lord to
[1:38] bring forth this child and bless her
[1:40] every step of the way Lord God for your
[1:42] glory. Hallelujah.
[1:45] Lord God we're so grateful to be here
[1:47] Lord again. We give you thanks and
[1:48] praise God this weekend Lord with the
[1:50] weather God. But we ask that the weather
[1:52] could not be as bad so we could gather
[1:54] on Sunday. We could worship the Lord on
[1:56] Sunday together, Lord, with saints of
[1:58] like precious faith. God, we lift that
[2:00] up to you, Lord, because you know we'd
[2:02] rather be in the house of God than at
[2:04] home, Lord God. I'd much rather be in
[2:07] the courts of the Lord, hallelujah, than
[2:09] at my house, Lord God, with with your
[2:11] people, with the saints, Lord God. So,
[2:14] Father God, let your will be done, God.
[2:16] We make our requests known unto you,
[2:17] Lord. Uh let the peace of God that
[2:20] passes all understanding bless our
[2:22] hearts. Lord we pray. Keep us in the
[2:24] love of God and let the peace of God
[2:26] rule of our hearts today. Father God, we
[2:28] love you. We give you thanks and praise
[2:30] in Jesus Christ's name. And the saint
[2:32] said, "Amen." Let's give God a round of
[2:34] applause. Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:39] Amen.

[6:53] Yes, I feel like traveling

[7:19] It's glittering
[7:21] towers. The sun out shines. I feel like

[7:42] Hallelujah.
[7:44] Oh yes. I feel like traveling on.
[7:51] I feel like traveling on.

[8:26] and waves overflow.
[8:30] I feel like traveling. Oh yes, I do. I
[8:35] feel it. Oh yes, I feel like traveling.
[8:40] Hallelujah. Glory.
[8:43] I feel like traveling
[8:47] on
[8:49] my heavenly home is bright and fair. I
[8:56] feel like travel. Is there one more? One
[8:59] more verse. Last verse.
[9:02] The Lord has been so good to me. I feel
[9:10] like traveling
[9:12] on
[9:15] until that blessed
[9:18] home.
[9:21] I feel praise God. Hallelujah.
[9:26] Oh yes. I feel like traveling
[9:31] on on and on. I feel like traveling
[9:38] on
[9:40] my heavenly
[9:43] home is bright and fair. I feel like
[9:49] traveling home.
[9:52] Amen. Let's sing God. Hallelujah. Amen.
[10:00] Praise God. Hallelujah. Let's sing the
[10:01] next song. We got two more songs we'll
[10:03] sing here. By God's grace. Amen.
[10:06] See, I want to feel like I'm traveling
[10:08] on with the Lord, right? And I want to
[10:10] reach higher ground as I'm traveling.
[10:11] Amen. I'm walking up the king's highway.
[10:14] Amen. That's another song we could sing.
[10:20] I'm pressing on
[10:23] the upward way.
[10:27] New heights. I'm gay
[10:31] every day.
[10:34] Still praying as
[10:38] I'm on.
[10:41] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[10:48] Lord, lift me up. Lord, lift me up
[10:53] and let me stand
[10:57] by faith on heavens
[11:01] table and a higher bl
[11:06] and I have found
[11:09] Lord that my feet are higher ground.
[11:16] My heart has no
[11:20] desire to stay
[11:23] where thoughts and doubts and fears and
[11:27] fears dismay.
[11:30] Though some may dwell
[11:34] where those abound
[11:37] by prayer my aim is higher ground.
[11:43] Glory.
[11:45] Glory. Thank you Lord.
[11:48] And let me stand. Let me stand
[11:53] by faith on heaven table.
[11:58] A higher place
[12:02] that have found
[12:05] Lord. Plant my feet on higher ground.
[12:12] I want to live
[12:16] above this world.
[12:19] Though Satan's dogs
[12:23] at me are heard,
[12:26] for faith has called
[12:30] the joyful sound. Hallelujah.
[12:33] The sound of saints. Oh yes. Hallelujah.
[12:40] Lord, lift me up. Lift me up.
[12:46] Let me stand.
[12:49] Heaven stable.
[12:53] Able and a higher plane. Higher plane.
[13:00] And I have found. Lord, plant my feet on
[13:04] higher. One more verse. Last verse. I
[13:09] want to scale
[13:11] the utmost high
[13:15] and catch a glide.
[13:22] But still I pray
[13:26] to heaven I found.
[13:29] Lord lead me on to higher ground.
[13:36] Lord, lift me up. Lift me up and let me
[13:41] stand. Let me stand
[13:45] by faith on heaven's table
[13:50] and a higher place
[13:54] than I have found.
[13:57] Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
[14:03] Amen. Let's thank God. Hallelujah.
[14:07] Let's change that last song. Let's do
[14:09] Walk it up the King's Highway. That kind
[14:10] of felt impressed on that one. I had a
[14:13] thought about that one. Let's sing the
[14:14] King's Highway. Is it two verses? My
[14:17] memor is right. Oh, three. Okay. Aren't
[14:19] you glad, church, you're walking up the
[14:21] King's Highway? Hallelujah. I'm not on
[14:23] the devil's highway. I'm on God's
[14:24] highway. Hallelujah. Amen.
[14:28] My way gets brighter.
[14:32] My load gets lighter.
[14:35] Walking up the kings highway.
[14:42] There's joy in knowing
[14:45] with him I'm going.
[14:48] Walking up the king's highway.
[14:53] Oh, it's a highway
[14:57] to heaven.
[15:01] None shall walk up there
[15:04] but the pure in heart. It's a high
[15:10] way to heaven heaven.
[15:14] Walking up the king's highway.
[15:20] You don't have to worry.
[15:24] Don't have to hurry.
[15:27] Walking up the king highway. Glory.
[15:33] Oh, Christ walks beside me.
[15:37] Angels there to guide me.
[15:40] Walking up the king's highway.
[15:45] Oh, it's a high
[15:49] glory. Thank you, Lord.
[15:53] Oh, none shall walk up there
[15:57] but the pure in heart. It's a highway
[16:02] to heaven heaven.
[16:06] Walking out the king high.
[16:11] Oh yes. And if you're not walking,
[16:16] start while I'm talking.
[16:19] Walking up the king's highway,
[16:26] there'll be a blessing
[16:29] you'll be confessing.
[16:32] Walking up the gates highway.
[16:38] It's a high
[16:40] way to heaven.
[16:44] Glory and shall walk there.
[16:51] It's a high
[16:53] way to heaven.
[16:58] Walking at the King's Highway.
[17:03] Amen. Amen.
[17:08] Hallelujah. Thank you, musicians. God
[17:10] bless you. Let's take our Bibles here
[17:11] tonight.
[17:13] Probably preach a little shorter message
[17:14] here. We got here a little later, so I
[17:16] apologize about that. But just thankful
[17:18] everybody could be in the house of the
[17:19] Lord tonight. 1st Samuel chapter 4.
[17:22] Let's go back. I want to preach a third
[17:24] uh segment on this little thought here
[17:26] tonight.
[17:27] It's the thought we looked at the last
[17:29] few weeks about confidence without
[17:31] character. Of course, the opposite is
[17:34] confidence with character. That's what
[17:36] we want to have. Uh by the grace of the
[17:38] Lord, I believe we have it.
[17:41] But it's good to check up. Hallelujah.
[17:43] preach the word.
[17:47] And uh we know we're following the will
[17:49] of God when we're keeping the word of
[17:51] God. We have to keep the word of God.
[17:53] Hallelujah.
[17:55] 1st Samuel chapter 4.
[18:01] As I was reading through 1 Samuel, I'm
[18:03] not quite done. I think I chapter 18 or
[18:05] 19, but a couple weeks ago, I read over
[18:08] this. I thought my that thought came to
[18:09] me about brother McBride preached to us
[18:13] and uh kind of struck me with that
[18:15] thought. So I wanted to preach on this
[18:18] here by God's grace a false sense of
[18:19] security. So Israel had a false sense of
[18:22] security.
[18:26] We'll just read verse five uh to
[18:28] preserve time here tonight by God's
[18:30] grace.
[18:32] 1st Samuel 4:5. If you got it, say amen.
[18:35] &gt;&gt; Love those Bibles open. I love how those
[18:37] Bibles are just laid across the top of
[18:38] the chairs there. So, that's really
[18:39] wonderful, children. I appreciate that.
[18:43] Hallelujah. God's word is a lamp unto
[18:45] our feet and a light unto our path.
[18:47] Hallelujah.
[18:48] &gt;&gt; Let's read verse five, and then we'll
[18:50] have you be seated. Ready? One, two,
[18:51] three. And when the ark of the covenant
[18:54] of the Lord came into the camp, all
[18:57] Israel shouted with a great shout, so
[19:01] that the earth rang again. May God add
[19:04] his blessing to the ring of his word.
[19:05] May be seated. God bless you. Set a
[19:07] little timer here. Maybe I preach about
[19:09] 45 minutes.
[19:12] Well, we were certainly blessed on
[19:13] Sunday. You know, the morning's message
[19:15] was called the true prosperity gospel.
[19:18] And I thought that was a beautiful
[19:19] thought. How many enjoyed that? Praise
[19:20] God. What a wonderful lesson that was.
[19:22] Just a reminder about godliness with
[19:25] contentment is great gain. Amen. I
[19:27] thought that was wonderful. And it's
[19:28] been on my heart. You know what? I want
[19:29] to preach on finances. I want to preach
[19:31] on at least once a year just to kind of
[19:33] uh revisit that and talk about
[19:35] stewardship. Uh so it was on my heart to
[19:38] preach on finances and then I had up my
[19:40] list of things to preach on and our
[19:41] brother come and preach on finances. I
[19:43] thought that was really great. You can't
[19:44] separate that from the spiritual aspect.
[19:46] Praise God. So I thought that was so
[19:48] beautiful. Uh you know we should one
[19:50] invest in our talents and uh the Lord
[19:52] makes some rich, the Lord makes some
[19:54] poor. Um but I love Solomon's prayer.
[19:57] Solomon's prayer was, "Lord, don't make
[19:59] me rich that I forget you. Don't make me
[20:01] poor that have to steal." In other
[20:04] words, he's asking, "Uh, make me middle
[20:06] class by God's grace." Amen. So, uh, we
[20:09] should all be thankful. I believe
[20:10] everybody here is middle class. Amen.
[20:11] Everybody has food in the refrigerator.
[20:13] Everybody's got a refrigerator. Amen.
[20:15] So, uh, we're thankful for that. And
[20:18] I'll probably preach on finances maybe
[20:20] in a few weeks here, uh, by God's grace,
[20:21] just revisit where we want to be,
[20:23] especially getting out of debt. The
[20:25] Bible says the borrower is servant to
[20:27] the lender. So, we don't want to be in
[20:29] debt uh to someone uh except for the
[20:32] house. That'd be the only thing you want
[20:33] to be in debt for and then pay that off
[20:35] as soon as possible. Most people can't
[20:37] pay cash for a house these days in this
[20:39] economy. Uh but the main thing to do is
[20:41] be debtree as soon as possible by the
[20:44] grace of God. They can really build
[20:46] wealth after that if it's the Lord's
[20:48] will. if it's the Lord's will because
[20:50] God u might not open certain doors for
[20:53] you certain ways. That's why it's so
[20:55] important to be content.
[20:58] So, uh we'll preach more on that here by
[21:00] God's grace in the next few weeks, Lord
[21:02] willing, if the Lord carries. Um we
[21:05] looked at parts one and two. Now, part
[21:07] one, we focus a lot on Eli. And
[21:09] remember, there was numerous sins in
[21:11] Eli's day. The Bible said uh the whole
[21:14] land was full of idols. Remember that?
[21:16] So Eli's land, Eli's time was full of
[21:19] idols. Eli was overweight. He wasn't
[21:22] taking care of his temple. Um he let the
[21:25] lights go out in the holy place. So we
[21:27] see he let down on keeping the standard
[21:29] in the house of the Lord. Uh we saw that
[21:32] was a great sin. So idolatry,
[21:34] uh ignoring the house of God, neglecting
[21:37] the ministry, uh we'd say, uh gluttony,
[21:41] that's the word I'm looking for,
[21:42] gluttony, uh amongst the leadership. The
[21:45] worst part, it seems like though, was
[21:48] him letting his sons uh commit sins in
[21:52] the church. We'd say that was uh
[21:54] probably the worst part. Remember, they
[21:57] would take the offering before it was
[21:58] even sacrificed to God. So, they set
[22:00] themselves above God. Uh they God was
[22:03] supposed to get the fat, but they chose
[22:05] the pieces even with fat on it. And it
[22:07] made the men, the Bible said they
[22:09] abhored the house of God. They hated
[22:11] coming to church because Eli let his
[22:13] sons do awful things in the house of
[22:15] God. Now, how does that apply to me as a
[22:17] pastor? I have to make sure my life, my
[22:19] children, all my life, all my family
[22:22] keeps the right spirit, the Holy Spirit.
[22:24] Hallelujah. As I said, if anyone ever
[22:26] offends you, go talk to them one-on-one.
[22:28] Amen. We know even God sent a prophet to
[22:31] Eli, right? And also Samuel to tell him
[22:34] of his sins, right? So, he had chances,
[22:39] he had opportunities. And even the Bible
[22:40] said Eli could have fronted his sons and
[22:42] said, "Why do you do these wicked
[22:43] things?"
[22:44] Uh, but we'll look at a little a little
[22:46] more at that here tonight by God's
[22:47] grace. And another awful sin was the uh
[22:51] adultery, right? The Bible said the two
[22:53] sons were laying with the women. So the
[22:56] sisters that would come, he would try to
[22:57] get their numbers after service or
[22:59] something like that. Real wretched men
[23:01] like that. Wicked men like that. The
[23:03] Bible said they were sons of Bile or
[23:05] sons of Satan. Hallelujah. Uh, and we
[23:09] saw, we ended part one, and I'm just
[23:11] kind of rehearsing just for my sake. We
[23:13] ended part one by showing Eli trembled
[23:16] at the ark, but he didn't tremble at the
[23:19] sin that was in his family.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; And church, so it is today. People will
[23:23] tremble at the anointing, right? They'll
[23:25] tremble at crowds.
[23:27] &gt;&gt; They'll tremble at big city, big
[23:29] churches, right? Or big revivals.
[23:31] They'll tremble at all these things or a
[23:33] famous preacher who walks in. They'll
[23:34] tremble at that. But do they tremble at
[23:36] obedience to the word of God?
[23:39] &gt;&gt; If not, then they're doing the same
[23:41] thing Eli did and they'll get the same
[23:43] results.
[23:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; That's that's true.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "If you love me, keep my
[23:48] commands." Hallelujah.
[23:49] &gt;&gt; So, it's good to tremble at the presence
[23:50] of God. It's good to tremble when people
[23:52] are weeping and that that's very good.
[23:54] It's very good to tremble. But we should
[23:55] tremble at the sin amongst the people
[23:58] and keep sin out of the church.
[24:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. All right. All right. And then
[24:03] part two was last Wednesday on the the
[24:05] evening service there uh from I preached
[24:07] from home because of the snow. And so we
[24:10] looked at verses in Hebrews about uh
[24:13] confidence. The Bible says you have
[24:14] confidence if if you keep your
[24:16] confession to the end.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:18] &gt;&gt; Right? So we looked at confidence. So we
[24:20] looked at how believers should have
[24:22] confidence with character. But it's that
[24:25] Judas's group, the makebeliever group.
[24:27] They're the group that has confidence
[24:29] without character.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; Right? Hallelujah. And church, remember
[24:33] even did you remember that the foolish
[24:35] virgin didn't even have confidence on
[24:36] the day of judgment
[24:38] &gt;&gt; because Jesus said, "Come, come blessed
[24:40] the Lord." And they said, "When did we
[24:42] uh when did we feed you? When did we
[24:43] give you water? When did we take you in?
[24:45] When did we visit you in prison?" They
[24:46] didn't even know.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; That they were going to be saved, right?
[24:51] &gt;&gt; The foolish virgin. Remember, there's
[24:52] two kinds of Christians. There's wise
[24:53] virgins. They they're spiritfilled. They
[24:56] believe all the word of God. They live
[24:57] all the word of God. Then there's
[24:58] foolish virgins
[25:00] &gt;&gt; who they're virgin to the word. They
[25:02] don't have any idolatry with the world,
[25:03] which is a small group, right, brother
[25:04] Rob? As much as we see people uh
[25:07] intimacy with the world and worldly
[25:09] pleasures, right? What a small group.
[25:11] Hallelujah. My both groups very small.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; But the foolish virgins even surprised
[25:17] when did we do this? And Jesus said,
[25:18] "When you've done it to the least of
[25:20] these, my brethren, you've done it unto
[25:21] me."
[25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So remember, do alms uh give to
[25:25] the poor, give to the needy, visit
[25:27] people, pray for uh yeah, visit sick
[25:29] people in the hospital. Uh if you can
[25:31] invite invite people into your house for
[25:33] a little while, invite them in. Let them
[25:34] in. Whatever you can do because when you
[25:36] do it to the least believer, you've done
[25:38] it unto Jesus.
[25:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; So we looked at that last week and we
[25:42] also looked, I think, five examples of
[25:44] how people had confidence without
[25:46] character. To me, the my favorite was
[25:48] the one where both men are praying in
[25:50] the temple, right? And one man says,
[25:52] "Thank God I'm not like this publican. I
[25:54] fast twice a week. I give all these
[25:56] alms." He said, 'Thank God I'm not like
[25:58] that unholy man. And then the publicans
[26:01] down there beating his chest say, "God,
[26:02] be merciful to me a sinner." Jesus said,
[26:04] "Only one of them went home forgiven."
[26:08] &gt;&gt; It was the humble one. It wasn't the
[26:09] confident, cocky one, or we'd say the
[26:11] bold one. It was like, "Oh, thank God
[26:14] I'm not like brother so and sister so
[26:15] and so."
[26:16] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; It was the humble one who was asking God
[26:19] for mercy.
[26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So help let us keep that in mind
[26:22] tonight. Yes, I'm going to rebuke sin. I
[26:24] always rebuke sin. I hope you rebuke sin
[26:26] in your house too. Amen. In your life,
[26:28] you should rebuke sin as well. But be
[26:30] humble and say, "God, I've fallen short,
[26:32] so forgive me when I fall short."
[26:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:34] &gt;&gt; Be merciful to me.
[26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:36] &gt;&gt; I don't deserve it no more than anybody
[26:37] else.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[26:38] &gt;&gt; In fact, church, we got to be more
[26:40] accountable because we have more of the
[26:42] revelation of the word of God.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Now, let's move into part three. That
[26:45] was five five minute uh introduction
[26:47] there.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Uh eight minute introduction. Amen. All
[26:50] right. Now, go to uh
[26:54] go to uh let's go to 1st Samuel uh
[26:56] chapter 2.
[26:59] In verses 15-1 17, the Bible said,
[27:02] "Before they burnt the fat, before they
[27:04] even gave God an offering, Samuel's sons
[27:07] would take the good parts." Now, see,
[27:09] church, can't you see that? Not every uh
[27:12] the sons of every church leader don't
[27:14] always turn out good. I'm believing mine
[27:17] are by God's grace. But I'm talking
[27:19] about brother Brandham, right? Even
[27:20] brother Brandham's sons.
[27:23] &gt;&gt; Just because a prophet or a man of God,
[27:26] even Samuel's sons fell short of the
[27:27] glory of God.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; Remember the people come and said,
[27:30] "Samuel, we love you, but your sons are
[27:32] not good, godly men. We want a king."
[27:35] &gt;&gt; So just because someone's got a good
[27:37] father, a good mama, don't mean you're
[27:39] going to heaven. Each person's got to
[27:40] repent of their sins and get right.
[27:43] &gt;&gt; Right. God don't have any grandchildren.
[27:45] Right. Very famous saying. Brother Ram
[27:47] quoted that all the time. God don't have
[27:49] any grandchildren. He got it from
[27:50] somebody else too. I forgot he got it
[27:52] from somebody. It might have been
[27:52] brother Shakarian. Uh but the men were
[27:56] saying if you don't give it to us in
[27:57] verse 16 will take it by force. Remember
[27:59] brother says Satan is the god of force.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Satan will force these evil thoughts in
[28:04] your mind. Right
[28:07] now verse 17 the sin of the young men
[28:08] was very great before the Lord for men
[28:10] abhore the offering of the Lord. Church
[28:12] we want our church to be a place where
[28:14] there's so much holiness. People love
[28:16] coming to church.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; I hope you love coming to church.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:20] &gt;&gt; If not, like I said, talk to that
[28:21] person. Uh get everything figured out
[28:23] and then you can love coming to church
[28:25] again.
[28:26] &gt;&gt; All right. Now, verse 22. Now, Eli was
[28:28] very old and heard all that his sons did
[28:30] under Israel and how that they lay with
[28:32] the women that assembled of the door or
[28:34] at the door of the tabernacle of the
[28:35] congregation. So, Eli hears, "My sons
[28:37] are committing adultery." Remember,
[28:39] they're married. though his two sons are
[28:41] married to women,
[28:43] but they're laying with women. They're
[28:45] committing adultery.
[28:48] And then he said in verse 23, "Why do
[28:49] you do such things? For I hear of your
[28:51] evil dealings all or by all this people.
[28:54] Everybody in the churches tell me your
[28:56] sons are sleeping around." And he didn't
[28:58] do anything about it.
[29:00] &gt;&gt; Now see church, that's the difference
[29:01] between a real leader and a bad leader.
[29:04] &gt;&gt; A real leader when he hears about sin,
[29:06] he goes try to take care of it and reach
[29:07] out to those people.
[29:09] He doesn't let it continue.
[29:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[29:13] &gt;&gt; This is major sin. Sexual sin is a major
[29:16] sin. Paul calls it levan.
[29:19] And that will that levan that pride will
[29:21] impact the whole church and the whole
[29:23] church will be backed on God.
[29:26] Hallelujah. That's why people sin. I
[29:28] tell them don't come to church or
[29:30] confess. Don't keep coming to church
[29:32] because you're gonna create such an
[29:33] atmosphere of levan where people think
[29:35] it's okay to sin and they forget about
[29:37] the holiness of God.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[29:44] Don't bring that levan in here. That's
[29:45] always been my prayer. God, keep the
[29:46] leaven out of the church.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Even if we're a small church, I'd rather
[29:50] have a small church levven free,
[29:52] unleavened. Amen. Than a big church with
[29:54] a bunch of sin and leaven in it.
[29:57] I'd ra if you gave me the choice, I'd
[29:59] rather have the way with the Lord's
[30:00] despised few.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Don't bring sin in this church.
[30:03] Hallelujah.
[30:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, church, when I'm
[30:07] talking about us now, the faithful ones,
[30:09] not just confess it before you get here.
[30:10] Praise God. Right? Come to church. Amen.
[30:14] I'm talking about sexual sin and all
[30:16] these major sins. We're all gonna battle
[30:18] every single day, but we can confess our
[30:20] sins every day when we come to church.
[30:22] Amen.
[30:23] &gt;&gt; Now he says in verse 24, "No name, my
[30:26] sons, it's no good report that I hear.
[30:28] You make the Lord's people to
[30:29] transgress."
[30:31] &gt;&gt; Verse 25, "If one man sin against
[30:33] another, the judge shall judge him. But
[30:35] if a man sin against the Lord, who shall
[30:36] entreat him? Notwithstanding, they
[30:38] hearken not to the voice of their father
[30:40] because the Lord would slay them." In
[30:42] other words, God was going to slay them.
[30:45] Right? God knew their actions. God knew
[30:47] they wouldn't repent. So God had
[30:48] ordained for them to be slain. They get
[30:50] slain in the battle. The very next
[30:51] battle coming up here.
[30:54] Now,
[30:57] let's go on now. Uh let's go down to
[30:59] verse 27. And there came a man of God
[31:01] unto Eli said unto him, "Thus sayith the
[31:02] Lord." Now, that's a quite a statement.
[31:06] I uh I don't think I've ever got a thus
[31:08] sayith the Lord, but I did have brother
[31:09] Ray tell me a He said, "The Lord wanted
[31:11] me to tell you this, but he didn't say
[31:13] thus sayeth the Lord." And we went
[31:15] search it out and it was exactly right.
[31:18] He said, "Go ask your daughter this,
[31:19] this, that." I asked Lydia that. She
[31:20] started crying and it was vindicated to
[31:22] me.
[31:24] But I've never really had that before.
[31:27] But he Eli gets a thus sayeth the Lord.
[31:29] Did I plainly appear unto the house of
[31:31] thy father when they were in Egypt and
[31:33] Pharaoh's house? And did I choose him
[31:35] out of the tribes of Israel to be my
[31:37] priest, to offer upon an altar, to burn
[31:39] incense, to wear an epha before me? And
[31:41] did I give unto the house of thy father
[31:43] all the offerings made by fire of the
[31:45] children of Israel? Wherefore kick ye at
[31:47] my sacrifice and at my offering. Now
[31:49] that just struck me. Doesn't that sound
[31:51] familiar? Kick.
[31:53] Who else was kicking against God? St.
[31:55] Paul was when he was Saul.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Why you kick against the pricks? And the
[31:59] church said.
[32:01] So it's thus sayith the Lord. Eli was
[32:04] fighting against God, not for God.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; How was he fighting against God, brother
[32:10] Jesse? He never he never committed any
[32:12] sin. He let the sin go on.
[32:16] Hallelujah.
[32:18] &gt;&gt; So imagine that he's kicking against God
[32:20] like God. No. No. Same thing Saul was
[32:22] doing. He was fighting against He was
[32:23] arresting Christians, taking them to
[32:25] jail, holding the coats of those who
[32:27] stoned Stephen. That's kicking against
[32:28] the gospel. That's fighting the gospel.
[32:30] So Eli's guilty of something similar.
[32:36] I just saw that right now. I actually
[32:37] didn't have that in my notes. and at my
[32:39] offering which I have commanded. So any
[32:41] leader that lets the church service get
[32:43] off and it's there's sin in it like
[32:45] that, you know, robbing God or the
[32:47] worship or sexual sin, let it go in the
[32:51] church.
[32:53] Any leader that does that is fighting
[32:55] against God.
[32:57] That's right. And honors, now look at
[33:00] this. And it even goes this far.
[33:01] Honoring your sons above me.
[33:05] So see, when the when the leaders of the
[33:07] church, myself or anyone, any pastor,
[33:09] when they let sin go on, they actually
[33:12] honor the people more than they honor
[33:15] God.
[33:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[33:21] So again, that's why I don't let sinners
[33:23] come to this church. Now, church,
[33:24] there's been a couple times I've had to
[33:26] even turn people down. They said, 'Well,
[33:28] I want to attend your church and I can
[33:29] pay tithe. And I said, 'Well, do you
[33:31] have anything wrong with your former
[33:32] church? Yes. I said, 'Well, then fine.
[33:33] Don't come to our church.
[33:36] I don't care how much money you offer
[33:37] me. Don't come to church. Right? Because
[33:41] I don't want sin. I don't want
[33:42] questions. I don't want problems. I want
[33:44] a church that loves Jesus Christ.
[33:46] &gt;&gt; Don't you?
[33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[33:52] Honorest your sons above me to make your
[33:54] Now, this is thus sayith the Lord.
[33:55] You've honored your sons above me by
[33:58] letting them take God's meat, God's fat,
[34:02] &gt;&gt; right? to make yourselves fat with the
[34:05] chiefest of yourselves. So Eli's
[34:08] included in this. So Eli and his sons
[34:10] were overweight,
[34:12] right? With the chiefest of all the
[34:14] offerings of Israel, my people getting
[34:17] fat off the uh the the the the offerings
[34:21] of the people. That was wrong. So other
[34:24] words, they're living off the high
[34:25] horse.
[34:27] We'd say living large as the servants of
[34:29] God,
[34:31] &gt;&gt; right? All
[34:33] right. Verse 30. Wherefore the Lord God
[34:35] of Israel saith, I indeed said that thy
[34:38] house and the f house of thy father
[34:40] should walk before me forever. But now
[34:41] the Lord saith, be a far from me. For
[34:44] them that honor me, I will honor. That
[34:47] they despise I'm sorry. They that
[34:49] despise me shall be lightly esteemed. A
[34:52] church, I've told this to many young
[34:53] men. I told to my nephews re at the
[34:55] funeral a couple weeks ago. I tell to
[34:57] all these young men I meet and I say,
[34:59] "Hey, God bless you. where you going to
[35:00] college or you know what you're doing. I
[35:02] said I said honor your mother and father
[35:05] and God will honor you.
[35:07] &gt;&gt; That's why I tell the people that still
[35:08] live at their home. You want God to
[35:11] honor you? Honor your mother and father.
[35:13] Young people,
[35:14] &gt;&gt; adults, if your mother and father aren't
[35:16] living in your house anymore, you honor
[35:18] God in your finances, your health, uh
[35:20] your relationships, honor God in
[35:22] everything, and God will honor you.
[35:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:25] &gt;&gt; He'll hear your prayers. Hallelujah. He
[35:28] He'll let you be a light and a witness
[35:29] and a real Christian testimony. Praise
[35:31] God. That's right.
[35:35] Honor God and God will honor you.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; People can't honor God's house by coming
[35:41] to church. They can't honor God with our
[35:43] finances by t paying ti and offerings,
[35:46] right? So many ways we can list people
[35:48] that dishonor God. How's God going to
[35:50] honor you if you don't honor him?
[35:54] &gt;&gt; He's not going to. Verse 34. And this
[35:58] should be a sign unto you, Eli, that
[35:59] shall come upon thy two sons on Hoffne
[36:01] and Phineas, in one day they shall die,
[36:03] both of them. I'll raise me up a
[36:05] faithful priest. Amen. In other words,
[36:07] God saying, Eli, you're not faithful.
[36:09] So, I'm going to raise me up a faithful
[36:11] one.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; That shall do according to that which is
[36:15] in mine heart and in my mind, and I'll
[36:17] build him a sure house, and he shall
[36:19] walk before mine anointed forever. Amen.
[36:23] Hallelujah. So see church, whenever
[36:25] leaders let sin happen, they're not
[36:28] doing what God's heart wants them to do.
[36:30] Amen. Oh, now we can see it. Now we can
[36:32] see how we can be a church after the
[36:34] heart of God. Keep all the sin out. Keep
[36:37] believe every command. Believe every
[36:38] promise. Then we're a church after the
[36:40] heart of God.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:45] Keep every sin out. Keep all the leaven
[36:47] out. And then we'll be a church after
[36:49] the heart of God. That's the scripture.
[36:55] I'm sure church, if you're like me, you
[36:57] want to have a faithful church to the
[36:59] word of God. Don't you want your life to
[37:01] be faithful to God? I want my life to be
[37:04] faithful to God.
[37:06] &gt;&gt; Now, with my remaining time, I got now
[37:07] on my 30. I've only been preaching about
[37:09] uh let's see uh 20.
[37:12] What am I at? Oh, 19 minutes. Yeah. Oh,
[37:14] not too long. Let's go to first I want
[37:16] to spend the rest of time on family here
[37:17] because that's the the important part of
[37:19] this uh story. 1st Samuel 3, please.
[37:23] Verse two. 1st Samuel 3:2.
[37:30] We'll read uh 2 and 3.
[37:35] 1 Samuel 3:2. And it came to pass at
[37:37] that time that when Eli was laid down in
[37:39] his place, his eyes began to wax dim
[37:42] that he could not see. And air the lamp
[37:44] of God went out in the temple of the
[37:46] Lord where the ark of God was. and
[37:49] Samuel was laid down to sleep. Okay, now
[37:51] I'm just going to pause right there.
[37:52] Now, if you remember in, I believe it
[37:54] was Deuteronomy or Numbers, God told
[37:56] Moses, the people are going to beat down
[37:58] with their feet the olives to get oil
[38:01] and then they're going to bring the oil
[38:03] in, right? And then that oil will keep
[38:05] the lamp stand going, the seven lamped
[38:08] golden candlestick, right?
[38:12] &gt;&gt; So Eli, he probably had the oil there,
[38:15] but he didn't apply it. Oh, that sounds
[38:17] like good like a good sermon, doesn't
[38:18] it? Having oil, having the Holy Ghost,
[38:20] but not applying it to your life. Amen.
[38:22] Not setting it on fire. Oh my.
[38:25] Hallelujah. Having the spirit of God
[38:27] with you, but not letting it burn.
[38:29] Hallelujah.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Right. Didn't the Bible say, uh, did not
[38:33] the word of God burn inside of our
[38:34] hearts? We heard on Sunday.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; Did not it burn within us?
[38:39] &gt;&gt; See, we be too interested, we're too,
[38:40] sometimes we're too interested in other
[38:42] things. We let that burn in our hearts
[38:43] and mind. We got to let the Holy Spirit
[38:45] burn in our hearts and minds.
[38:48] Amen.
[38:49] Hallelujah.
[38:52] But see, the people were probably doing
[38:54] their part, but the Bible makes it look
[38:55] like it's Eli's fault.
[38:58] He let it go out.
[39:01] Imagine Eli, in other words, Eli was
[39:03] supposed to keep the lights on.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; But the but I guess only his sons would
[39:08] know like in the holy place, once they
[39:10] got in the holy place, there was no
[39:11] light on. It was dark,
[39:13] right? So the service of the Lord was
[39:16] missing light. Hey, there was enough
[39:17] light in the service of the Lord. And
[39:19] the church said
[39:21] light. What is light? The Bible said
[39:23] it's knowledge. It's understanding for
[39:25] the New Testament believer. Hallelujah.
[39:28] The light of their eyes being
[39:30] enlightened. The Bible says, right? The
[39:31] light the eyes of their understanding
[39:33] being open.
[39:36] So, in other words, he was keeping uh
[39:38] the the candle from burning. The light
[39:41] wasn't shining in order to the service
[39:43] of the Lord.
[39:46] I don't know if that means also, did
[39:47] they replace the 12 loaves every week
[39:49] like they were supposed to? Were they
[39:51] also lacking bread? One thing's for
[39:53] sure, they didn't have the light of the
[39:54] seven church ages. Amen. Hallelujah. So,
[39:57] does that mean uh the shoe bread was out
[40:00] to the bread of his face? In other
[40:02] words, they weren't in the presence of
[40:04] God uh seeking his face through the word
[40:06] of God, eating and feasting on the bread
[40:08] of life. And does that mean they let
[40:10] down on their prayer life then after
[40:12] that?
[40:13] &gt;&gt; Because the altar of incense was next,
[40:16] &gt;&gt; right?
[40:17] &gt;&gt; See, so one mistake, one neglect leads
[40:21] to another.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Now verse 12,
[40:31] I want to focus just on this thought
[40:32] here. Verse 12. In that day, I'll
[40:34] perform against Eli all the things which
[40:36] I have spoken concerning his house.
[40:39] Isn't it interesting? Eli and Elijah are
[40:41] so close together.
[40:43] Eli and Elijah,
[40:46] he says, concerning his house, when I
[40:48] begin, I will also make an end. Now,
[40:51] verse 13. Now, here's the point I want
[40:52] to get to. I preached a series on this
[40:53] many years ago. For I've told him that I
[40:56] will judge his house forever for the
[40:58] iniquity that he knoweth.
[41:01] In other words, he knew about the
[41:03] idolatry. He knew about no light uh in
[41:06] the candlestick. He knew about his sons
[41:09] taking the meat. He knew about his sons
[41:11] sleeping around. And he didn't do
[41:13] anything about it
[41:14] &gt;&gt; other than just say, "Guys, why you
[41:16] doing this?"
[41:17] &gt;&gt; That's all he just spoke it.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; But church, he had more power than that.
[41:21] &gt;&gt; He was their dad,
[41:23] &gt;&gt; right?
[41:23] &gt;&gt; He could have removed them from serving
[41:25] in the house of God.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Find somebody else who's faithful. Find
[41:29] somebody else who's sexually pure.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; Not these perverts,
[41:34] &gt;&gt; these adulterers.
[41:37] Get the ADULTERERS OUT OF THE CHURCH.
[41:46] &gt;&gt; I'm not even finished with the verse.
[41:47] He's going to be judged because of
[41:49] iniquity. Sound familiar? The workers of
[41:51] iniquity are going to be judged too,
[41:54] right? false sense of security,
[41:57] confidence without the character. They
[41:59] were confident. They cast out devils,
[42:01] healed the sick, did many wonderful
[42:02] works. But Jesus said, "I never knew you
[42:04] because you were workers of iniquity."
[42:06] Sound like Eli.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; Now, I hope he was saved at the end. I
[42:09] don't know. I hope he was saved. He was
[42:10] still trembling at the ark, but he
[42:12] didn't remove the sin out of his family.
[42:16] So, here we could see of a of a we'd say
[42:18] a deadbeat dad. Can everybody agree with
[42:21] that? He wasn't a good dad. Now, I hope
[42:24] you had a good dad. Some people, some of
[42:26] us didn't.
[42:28] But here's an example of, "Well, my dad
[42:30] wasn't very good, right? My dad didn't
[42:33] correct me like he should have." That's
[42:35] what the boys could have said, but the
[42:36] boys knew better. The dad tried to use
[42:38] his words.
[42:40] But the dad should have did more than
[42:42] just say words. That's according to thus
[42:44] sayith the Lord.
[42:46] &gt;&gt; It was iniquity. He let this go on. He
[42:49] honored his sons more than he honored
[42:51] God.
[42:53] All right.
[42:56] Now, here's the one. Here's I want to
[42:57] read. Because his sons made themselves
[42:59] vile, and he restrained them not.
[43:04] Now, Eno Eli neglected God's house and
[43:08] his fatherly duty to restrain his
[43:11] children.
[43:12] So, iniquity is when you know you're
[43:14] wrong. And iniquity means lawlessness. I
[43:17] don't I don't care what the word of God
[43:19] says. I'm going to do whatever I want to
[43:20] do. That's iniquity.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; You already know the will of God.
[43:25] Judgment goes upon workers of iniquity.
[43:29] &gt;&gt; Now, Eli would have escaped this if he
[43:31] would had restrained his sons from their
[43:34] vile acts. In other words, guys, stop
[43:36] taking the meat. I'm not going to let
[43:38] you take the meat.
[43:40] And stop sleeping around here. You guys
[43:42] aren't even going to greet anybody in
[43:44] the tabernacle. Stop it. Get out of
[43:45] here.
[43:47] Stop coming. You're not allowed to do
[43:49] this anymore.
[43:51] Hallelujah.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Well, Chris.
[44:00] Yes. Amen, brother. Exactly right,
[44:03] brother. And even their own children
[44:04] many times too. And wives. Yes. Even the
[44:07] Yes. Even the pastors themselves many
[44:09] times. Very good. Just give Brother
[44:11] Chris two claps. Sorry. Very good. It's
[44:13] the picture of the modern church today.
[44:16] They know sins in the church and they
[44:18] let us sit there. Like I said, that's
[44:20] why brother Rans marriage and divorce
[44:21] was so important because it showed us
[44:23] the difference between adultery and then
[44:25] purity. It showed if anyone gets married
[44:28] two or three times or whatever or get
[44:30] divorced and then sleep around, it shows
[44:32] they're guilty of adultery,
[44:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:36] &gt;&gt; And therefore, God is not blessing those
[44:39] people.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Right? He's not going to bless their
[44:43] souls. I'm talking about,
[44:45] &gt;&gt; right? The Bible says some some men's
[44:48] sins go before them, some come behind.
[44:50] So some of them God will rebuke, you
[44:52] know, during their life. Some of them
[44:54] God will just let him go just like the
[44:55] rich young ruler, right?
[44:58] But then they'll find out at the
[45:00] judgment that they were wrong. Right?
[45:04] Other words, they'll they might get
[45:05] spanked here or they might get spanked
[45:07] there.
[45:08] &gt;&gt; But they're going to get spanked by God,
[45:11] &gt;&gt; right? Disciplined,
[45:13] judged.
[45:15] Now the word restrain, church, in the
[45:17] Hebrew means to grow weak.
[45:20] Eli's job as a father was to lessen the
[45:23] impact of the sins of his sons.
[45:27] Okay? So that's what it means. He should
[45:28] have restrain them. In other words, you
[45:30] got to stop doing that. I'm going to
[45:32] remove. You're not allowed to work with
[45:34] the offerings until you stop doing this.
[45:37] And he should have watched them to make
[45:39] sure they didn't do it wrong.
[45:43] He had to. you must restrain them. Now,
[45:46] for our church, it would be like me. If
[45:48] I just let Malachi live a sinful life
[45:49] and he can see keep playing the the
[45:51] organ or let my girls or my daughters
[45:54] live a sinful life and they'll keep
[45:55] playing, that would be the same thing
[45:56] that Eli did. Or if I myself lived a
[45:59] double life,
[46:00] &gt;&gt; it'd be the same thing.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God requires holiness.
[46:05] Hallelujah.
[46:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:07] &gt;&gt; And we got to stand for holiness. We got
[46:09] to keep the sin out of the church.
[46:10] Hallelujah.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[46:15] So we we must restrain our children.
[46:17] I'll say like this. We must restrain the
[46:19] church as well because Paul told uh
[46:21] Corinthian church, get that man sleeping
[46:23] around. Get him out of the church.
[46:25] Deliver his soul to Satan.
[46:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:28] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Give deliver his body to
[46:29] Satan that his soul might be saved.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; So I'm sorry I said that wrong because
[46:33] Paul called him a brother. Still a
[46:35] brother sleeping with his stepmother.
[46:39] Shocking.
[46:40] Now, I want to go this route. I've been
[46:43] preaching 28 minutes here. Um, maybe
[46:46] about 15.
[46:47] I love your encouragement, Brother
[46:49] Chris. 1 Peter 3:1. If you got your
[46:52] Bibles, 1 Peter 3, verse one.
[47:01] So, we looked at parents. Parents need
[47:02] to stop to go to any lengths to stop
[47:05] their children from sinning.
[47:07] you uh you have to restrain them so
[47:09] they're sinning less and less and less.
[47:12] Go to any lengths,
[47:14] right? You parents have to do that. They
[47:19] can't just say, "Well, Johnny's going to
[47:20] do it. Johnny's gonna do Susiey's going
[47:22] to do it. Susie." No, you better stop.
[47:23] You better go talk to them and stop them
[47:25] from doing it
[47:27] &gt;&gt; as much as you can. Hallelujah.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; Any real parent will do that.
[47:34] If not, the iniquity is also on the
[47:36] parents like it was on Eli. That's thus
[47:39] sayith the word of God,
[47:40] &gt;&gt; right? Eli got a thus sayith the Lord.
[47:43] You're just as guilty because you
[47:45] allowed it to continue.
[47:47] &gt;&gt; That's right. And the Bible said a
[47:49] pastor can't rule the house of God until
[47:51] he can rule his own house.
[47:54] &gt;&gt; So, there's a prerequisite to being a
[47:55] pastor. You have to have a holy house
[47:57] first and then that'll keep this house
[48:00] holy.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; By God's grace, we're coming up on 20
[48:02] years. I've tried to keep the house of
[48:04] God holy just like I've tried to keep my
[48:05] own house holy.
[48:08] That's right. Now, 1 Peter 3:1, let's
[48:10] get into husbands and wives here.
[48:13] Let's review this here. By God's grace,
[48:15] I thought uh it would kind of connected
[48:17] really well.
[48:21] Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to
[48:23] your own husbands. Now, I've seen this
[48:25] play out where in marriages,
[48:28] a wife will a wife will take the
[48:31] pastor's word instead of the husband's
[48:33] word. And I've seen that sometimes cause
[48:35] people problems,
[48:37] right? But the Bible says the wife needs
[48:39] to obey her own husband. Now, if her
[48:42] husband's breaking the word, that's
[48:44] different,
[48:45] &gt;&gt; right? Sometimes the devil tries to get
[48:48] in a marriage and uh uh make make it
[48:50] look to get the husband mad to make it
[48:53] look like the wife loves the pastor more
[48:54] than the husband, right? Not doesn't
[48:58] happen very often, but well, maybe it
[48:59] does. I don't this church. I hope it
[49:01] doesn't. If it does, I don't know about
[49:03] it,
[49:04] but I've seen it sometimes. Now, that's
[49:06] that's what my parents went through.
[49:08] Actually, I'll just share that. Uh
[49:10] because uh because my dad had his uh
[49:13] different ideas. Um he he would always
[49:16] tell my mom, "You love the church more
[49:18] than you love me." But my dad didn't
[49:21] realize, well, he realized it, but my
[49:23] mom was supposed to go to church. My dad
[49:25] was saying, "Stay at home." And so my
[49:27] dad would accuse my mom of not uh of
[49:29] loving the the church and the pastor
[49:31] more than him. But he he knew he knew he
[49:33] was wrong. The Bible says we should
[49:35] gather more as we see that day
[49:36] approaching. Amen. Where two or three
[49:38] are gathered, there I am in the midst of
[49:39] them. So I saw that in my family growing
[49:42] up.
[49:45] But see my my mom of course she was
[49:47] right by going to church but she was
[49:48] wrong in other things just like my dad
[49:51] was wrong on other things.
[49:54] Now now but for us let's get back to the
[49:55] scripture that if any man obey not the
[49:58] word. Okay so in a marriage if the
[50:00] husband doesn't obey the word they may
[50:02] also without the word be one by the
[50:06] conversation of the wives.
[50:09] Okay. Now the word one means to gain or
[50:12] acquire to win someone over to the
[50:15] kingdom of God. So they can gain faith
[50:18] in Christ.
[50:20] So a a believing wife can win over her
[50:24] husband to loving God in Christ by her
[50:28] conversation which is her conduct and
[50:31] her behavior. Sound familiar? We just
[50:33] preach on Corinthians, right? 1
[50:35] Corinthians 7 says, "A sanctified woman
[50:37] sanctifies her husband and the
[50:39] children."
[50:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; In other words, that woman, if she's
[50:42] living godly, she won't bring sin and
[50:44] make the husband and the children more
[50:45] sinful. Her presence and her hatred for
[50:48] sin makes them more holy
[50:50] &gt;&gt; just by she just by her not allowing sin
[50:53] in the house.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; And same thing about a godly man who has
[50:57] a wife that doesn't believe. That man
[50:59] will sanctify his wife and children just
[51:01] because he's a godly man. And he won't
[51:03] allow he won't speak evil to them. He
[51:05] won't abuse them. You know, he won't say
[51:07] verbal abuse or anything like that.
[51:08] They're more closer to God and
[51:10] sanctified because of his faith.
[51:16] Now verse two, while they behold your
[51:19] chase conversation coupled with fear.
[51:21] Now chase means reverence, sacredness,
[51:25] purity from carnality,
[51:27] immaculate or clean.
[51:31] So if a husband or wife is living living
[51:34] true to God, but the other spouse isn't,
[51:38] especially the woman, the Bible said
[51:39] here, she must be so chased, she must be
[51:42] so clean before God that the husband
[51:44] will pick on pick up on it and say like,
[51:46] "Wow, she's living clean before God."
[51:49] And in time, by God's grace, if that if
[51:52] that husband is elected to salvation, if
[51:55] he's predestinated to eternal life, it
[51:57] will cause him to be won over to the
[51:59] faith.
[52:00] Right now, we saw this in Lima a few
[52:02] years ago. Now, since uh there was a
[52:05] sister who came in the message, followed
[52:07] the Bible teachings of Brother, her
[52:09] husband hated it, fought against it, but
[52:11] then he got cancer and died. But a
[52:14] couple years before he died, he actually
[52:16] got saved. Now, he never accepted
[52:17] everything we believe, but his heart was
[52:19] totally softened and he got saved before
[52:21] he died. And church, you know what his
[52:23] reason was? Because his wife and
[52:25] daughters and son live so holy.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I've seen it. In other
[52:29] words, I've seen it. I've heard it.
[52:32] &gt;&gt; Your holy life will impact your spouse.
[52:35] It'll sanctify them because you live
[52:37] different.
[52:40] Yes. Yeah. The children, too. Yeah.
[52:42] Yeah. Anyone that's around you. Yeah.
[52:45] Now, 1 Corinthians 7 is just about the
[52:46] husband and wife and the children in one
[52:48] house. But yeah, anyone you live with,
[52:50] brother. Yep. Anyone live with like
[52:53] maybe a sister, brother. Anyone that
[52:54] would live with you, as long as you're
[52:56] serving God, it will sanctify them. In
[52:58] other words, they won't have to deal
[53:00] with any demons on you because you got
[53:01] the Holy Ghost. You're living pure.
[53:06] That's right.
[53:08] Now, uh, let me move on here.
[53:12] Well, let me let me go back to verse
[53:13] one. Let me just say this. In other
[53:15] words, women
[53:17] women can win over their husbands
[53:20] without the word. In other words, they
[53:22] women don't preach at their husbands.
[53:25] They live the life. They preach the
[53:27] life. I'll say like that.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; They don't preach with their words. They
[53:31] preach with their life
[53:33] or they just live the life. Maybe I
[53:35] shouldn't use the word preach just so
[53:36] people don't misunderstand. A woman
[53:38] doesn't preach at her husband with her
[53:39] words. She just lives the life
[53:42] with a chase conversation,
[53:45] a holy immaculate immaculately clean
[53:48] life.
[53:50] Brother Brother gave the example.
[53:51] Brother Chris, you ever hear brother
[53:52] tell this story? He said a sinner was
[53:54] married to a Christian. He was down at
[53:55] the bar drinking with two men and these
[53:58] two men started talking about
[53:59] Christians. They said, "There's never
[54:00] been a Christian. There's no such thing
[54:01] as a Christian. They're drinking,
[54:03] getting drunk." And the man in the
[54:04] middle finally says, "Stop. No, there
[54:05] is." They're like, "Who is it?" "My
[54:08] wife."
[54:10] "No way. I don't believe you." They
[54:12] said, "Let He said, "Yes, she's a real
[54:13] one. She's a real believer." "No, she's
[54:16] not. She's just a pretend." "No, let's
[54:18] go down. I'll prove it to you right
[54:19] now." So, three drunk men go down to the
[54:21] house and he and he told his friends,
[54:24] "Now, watch this. I'm going to get mad
[54:25] at her and she's not going to get
[54:26] upset."
[54:28] He walked, he said, "Honey, give me some
[54:30] eggs. Where's my food? Bring it to me
[54:32] now. Bring it right now." And she walked
[54:34] over, made it as quick as she could. She
[54:36] brought it over. He said, "Watch this,
[54:38] guys." She He took the plate and she
[54:40] said, he said, "YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE MY
[54:42] FOOD LIKE THIS. NOW, WHAT KIND OF IT
[54:43] what kind of treatment is this? I'm
[54:44] supposed to be your husband."
[54:47] And he said, "Now, boys, let's walk out.
[54:48] let's go into the living room. She'll
[54:50] make me some more food." And he said,
[54:51] "Now watch her." Brother Ram said she
[54:54] went over and she got down on the
[54:56] ground, started picking up the pieces,
[54:57] and she started saying, "Should Jesus
[55:00] bear his cross alone and all the world
[55:02] go free? No. There's a cross for me to
[55:05] carry. I'm sorry. There's a cross for
[55:07] him to carry and there's a cross for
[55:08] me."
[55:11] And the and the man looked at his two
[55:13] friends said, "See, there's a real one."
[55:14] And brother Ram said she led all three
[55:16] of them on their knees and they got
[55:18] saved right there in that kitchen. And
[55:21] the church said, "Hallelujah."
[55:24] Because they never they always they
[55:25] thought Christians were all hypocrites
[55:28] &gt;&gt; that if you get mad at them, they'll get
[55:29] mad at you. And she chose not to get
[55:31] upset. Amen. She didn't preach at them.
[55:33] Amen. SHE LIVED A LIFE IN FRONT OF THEM.
[55:35] IN OTHER WORDS, SHE LIVED FORGIVENESS.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; When she was mistreated, she didn't she
[55:39] didn't bite back. She didn't revile. She
[55:42] forgave them.
[55:44] And she said, "This is my cross to bear,
[55:46] church. WE HAVE CROSSES TO BEAR.
[55:48] HALLELUJAH. BUT LET'S LIVE HOLY AND
[55:50] we'll impact the people we love."
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; Like I was telling brother Chris, there
[55:58] are so many in my family when we first
[56:00] came in the message, they hated it.
[56:04] Never ever would I thought they would
[56:06] come. But now that person, some of you
[56:08] know what I'm talking about. Now that
[56:09] person will come to our church and even
[56:12] put on a skirt
[56:14] and tell me how much she loves my
[56:16] preaching. And one time she sat through
[56:18] a two and a half hour sermon I preached
[56:20] in Napoleon and said I loved every
[56:23] minute of it. I thought God is moving.
[56:25] Hallelujah. What's going on?
[56:27] Two and a half hours. Brother Chris I
[56:29] preached. And she sat there the whole
[56:31] time saying it. I like this.
[56:34] But hated it for 15 or 16, maybe 17
[56:36] years. hate it FOR ALL THOSE YEARS. BUT
[56:38] CHURCH, YOUR LIFE WILL SPEAK LOUDER THAN
[56:41] ANYTHING YOU CAN SAY. HALLELUJAH.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; The love and the forgiveness and the
[56:45] patience
[56:47] will speak louder than anything you can
[56:49] try to get mad and try to prove
[56:51] something wrong. Try to prove somebody
[56:52] they're wrong and you're right.
[56:56] Now, there can be times, of course, you
[56:57] can speak the word to your family. I'm
[56:59] not saying you're you're not. Now, the
[57:01] woman shouldn't re shouldn't uh preach
[57:04] at the husband, right? That's what the
[57:06] Bible says there. Now, can the woman
[57:08] give the husband a word from the Lord?
[57:10] Yes. Remember uh in Genesis when Genesis
[57:13] 21 when Sarah told uh Sarah told
[57:16] Abraham, "Cast out Hagar and Ishmael.
[57:19] Cast out the bond woman." Abraham's
[57:21] like, "What are you talking about?"
[57:22] Abraham went and talked to God and God
[57:24] said, "Hearken unto Sarah, for in this
[57:26] way she's right."
[57:28] So, see, if the woman does give a word,
[57:30] well, the husband, well, I'll take this
[57:32] before the Lord. Let me see what the
[57:33] Lord tells me.
[57:35] And that can show unity that can bring
[57:38] unity in a marriage as well. But it has
[57:41] to be a word from the Lord or a leading
[57:43] of the Lord. Right?
[57:48] All right. I'm at 40 minutes here. I'm
[57:49] going to try to maybe five minutes here.
[57:54] All right. Now, I want to deal with this
[57:56] here. Recently, I've been studying uh on
[57:59] family. Let's go to 1 Timothy 5 67 and
[58:02] 8. 1 Timothy 5:67 and 8.
[58:09] Church, it's so important to keep sin
[58:11] out of the house and out of your family.
[58:19] Now, verse six is speaking of a widow
[58:21] woman who instead of serving God and
[58:23] praying and fasting, she marries some
[58:26] sinner man just so she can have money.
[58:28] I'm just paraphrasing it. Other words,
[58:30] she chooses to lose leave the church
[58:32] just so she can have some money and a
[58:34] husband. Now, in that day, it was a hard
[58:35] thing to be a widow because women
[58:37] couldn't have jobs like men and own
[58:38] property like men. So, it was a really
[58:41] big thing for a widow to stay a widow
[58:45] and uh to wait on God for a godly
[58:47] husband. It was it was a really
[58:48] difficult thing. But the Bible said,
[58:50] "She that liveth in flesh," in other
[58:52] words, a woman, a widow woman in the
[58:54] church who marries a sinful rich man
[58:56] just for money, the Bible says she's
[58:58] dead. Wow. She's alive. There's a real
[59:00] zombie for you right there, brother
[59:01] Chris. That's where the word That's
[59:03] where Satan got zombies from the word of
[59:04] God. Because they're alive, but they're
[59:07] dead in their souls. They're dead in
[59:10] sins and trespasses. But you and I,
[59:11] we're not dead. We've been quickened by
[59:14] the word. Amen. THE BIBLE SAID, "YOU
[59:16] WERE DEAD IN SINS AND TRESPASSES, BUT
[59:18] NOW HE HAS QUICKENED YOU." HALLELUJAH.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; SO, WE'RE NOT DEAD. WE'RE NOT WALKING
[59:23] DEAD PEOPLE. WE'RE WALKING LIVING
[59:25] PEOPLE. HALLELUJAH.
[59:29] And these I'm sorry and these things
[59:32] that I'm sorry these things give in
[59:34] charge that they may be blameless. Now
[59:35] verse eight is where I want to go. That
[59:37] if any man provide not for his own. So
[59:39] you have a husband and wife with
[59:40] children. If that man doesn't provide
[59:42] for his children especially they of his
[59:44] own house, he hath denied the faith and
[59:47] is worse than an infidel.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; Now think of how bad Eli was. Eli
[59:52] provided for his children physically but
[59:55] not spiritually.
[59:56] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:58] So what did the Bible say? He was guilty
[1:00:00] of iniquity and he dishonored God
[1:00:03] because he didn't make them he didn't
[1:00:06] make them do less sin because he had the
[1:00:07] he he had the opportunity. He could have
[1:00:09] made them do less sin.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; But here's what struck me as I was
[1:00:14] studying this week.
[1:00:16] Any man who doesn't do that is worse
[1:00:18] than what could be worse than an
[1:00:20] infidel? The only thing worse than an
[1:00:21] infidel would be a blasphemer.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:27] So now I could be wrong in this. This is
[1:00:29] not doctrine. I'm just saying it seems
[1:00:30] to me that a a man who won't
[1:00:34] provide spiritually and physically for
[1:00:38] his wife and children is second worst
[1:00:41] thing you can possibly do outside of
[1:00:44] blasphemy of the Holy Ghost.
[1:00:47] I'm not saying that's doctrine, but
[1:00:48] that's the way I can see it right now.
[1:00:50] GOD SO LOVES THE FAMILY. AMEN. God so
[1:00:53] honors the marriage covenant. The church
[1:00:55] said,
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Because you don't just get you so don't
[1:00:58] vow to each other. You vow to God.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:04] God so hates that. God so hates divorce.
[1:01:08] God so hates a man that will leave his
[1:01:10] wife and children and won't provide
[1:01:12] physically and spiritually. Paul says
[1:01:15] he's worse than an unbeliever.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And remember Eli. Eli
[1:01:21] provided na naturally, but he didn't
[1:01:24] provide spiritually. So God was against
[1:01:26] him. He was fighting against God. So
[1:01:29] even if a father, we'd say, or a mom
[1:01:31] would provide physically, that doesn't
[1:01:34] mean as much. You have to provide
[1:01:36] spiritually. You have to train the child
[1:01:38] in the way that they should go.
[1:01:43] Right? Proverbs 22:6, train up a child
[1:01:46] in the way he should go, and when he's
[1:01:48] old, he will not depart from it.
[1:01:52] Everybody understand by God's grace.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; So, not only do I have to give food to
[1:01:56] Malachi and Acacia and Caris and all the
[1:01:58] all my not only that, that's only part
[1:02:01] of it. That's half of it.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; The other half is I have to show them
[1:02:05] the gospel. I have to correct them if
[1:02:07] they need it. Hallelujah. I got to help
[1:02:09] them get away from sin and get closer to
[1:02:11] God. That's right.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; That's just as important if not more.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; Now, both are important.
[1:02:18] Can everybody see that? By God's grace.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Because if not, you can be like Eli.
[1:02:24] Right. Now, Eli's one of them. Cain.
[1:02:26] Cain's the opposite. Cain went away from
[1:02:28] the presence of the Lord.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; Now, of course, I'm focusing more
[1:02:32] spiritually on Cain, but he physically
[1:02:34] left the presence of God and all none of
[1:02:37] his family was ever in any spiritual
[1:02:39] things. Right.
[1:02:42] You have all these examples.
[1:02:44] But the real man of God, the real
[1:02:46] family, the real husband and wife of
[1:02:47] God, they will provide naturally for
[1:02:50] their family and spiritually.
[1:02:53] What does that mean? Well, then you go
[1:02:54] to the house of God. You you take your
[1:02:56] family to the house of God and you train
[1:02:58] them up in the things of God.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:03] Amen.
[1:03:04] God is good.
[1:03:07] And since sister Naomi walked in, I just
[1:03:09] appreciate how she brings her family to
[1:03:11] the house of God every time the doors
[1:03:12] are open. Let's give her a round of
[1:03:13] applause. Amen.
[1:03:15] That's right. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:03:19] So, it's worse than an infidel to not
[1:03:22] provide naturally and spiritually. We
[1:03:25] see it in Eli's life
[1:03:29] because what? What is it? It's iniquity.
[1:03:33] That's right.
[1:03:34] Now to me it's the second worst sin that
[1:03:36] I can find out outside of blasphemy of
[1:03:38] the Holy Ghost. You're worse than a inf
[1:03:41] well infidel is probably going to
[1:03:42] blasphe,
[1:03:44] right? But a person who knows better
[1:03:46] that was part of the church or heard the
[1:03:47] word of God to not provide physically
[1:03:51] and spiritually is worse than that.
[1:03:55] Is worse than a person over at the bar
[1:03:56] right across this the street there
[1:03:59] whether he knows about the gospel or
[1:04:00] not. Right?
[1:04:02] That man who knows better and doesn't
[1:04:04] provide both, he's worse than that
[1:04:07] sinner. That's right.
[1:04:11] Amen. Now, I'm closing with this here.
[1:04:13] Uh, I'm at 45 minutes. All right, Lord.
[1:04:16] What time you got to get up tomorrow,
[1:04:17] man? Oh, you got the day off tomorrow.
[1:04:19] Well, glory. Amen. Hallelujah. I'm free
[1:04:22] now, Brother Jose. Amen. I can preach.
[1:04:25] Amen. No, I'm always free. I'm just
[1:04:27] joking.
[1:04:29] Let me just encourage you now, church.
[1:04:33] If there's a situation where a father,
[1:04:35] mother's not doing their part, don't be
[1:04:38] too discouraged. God will step in and
[1:04:40] provide. Psalm 68:5. And I can say this
[1:04:43] in my life. My dad left me when I was 12
[1:04:45] or 13. Psalm 68:5. A father of the
[1:04:50] fatherless
[1:04:52] and a judge of the widows is God in his
[1:04:55] holy habitation. So if there's no father
[1:04:58] there or no mother there who becomes
[1:05:01] father mother God said I'll step in and
[1:05:03] I'll do it
[1:05:06] because the one who doesn't provide it
[1:05:08] is worse than infidel God says so I'll
[1:05:11] send someone into God sent coaches into
[1:05:13] my life sister Naomi when my dad went
[1:05:15] out um my best friend named Brian his he
[1:05:19] started inviting me over all the time
[1:05:20] his dad became like a father figure to
[1:05:22] me it's like God put godly men father
[1:05:25] figures my pastor growing up was a a
[1:05:27] father figure to me. My uncles came to
[1:05:29] my games. Father God God God brought in
[1:05:31] other people as well. But God's the one
[1:05:33] who really stepped in and said, "I'm
[1:05:35] going to take fatherhood over this.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; I will do it.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; I'm the father to the fatherless." And
[1:05:42] the church said,
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; "It's either wrong or it's right,
[1:05:45] church.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; It's right."
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; Now, that don't mean you don't got to
[1:05:50] pray for it. You still need to pray for
[1:05:51] it.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; But trust the Lord.
[1:05:57] Uh Isaiah 40 verse 29. Isaiah 40:29. I
[1:06:02] think I'm reading that right there.
[1:06:05] Now church, if you ever get faint, don't
[1:06:07] don't be discouraged. The Bible said he
[1:06:09] giveth power to the faint and to them
[1:06:12] that have no might he increases their
[1:06:15] strength. And the church said
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; now a single mother we say or a single
[1:06:19] dad all you know so much stress so much
[1:06:23] so much so many requirements so much on
[1:06:25] you I feel faint I feel like I don't
[1:06:28] have strength God says I'll GIVE YOU
[1:06:30] STRENGTH I'LL PROVIDE IT WHEN YOU'RE
[1:06:32] WEAK. AMEN. LET THE WEAK SAY I'M STRONG.
[1:06:34] HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; LET THE POOR SAY I'M RICH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; God promises I'll provide it. Just wait
[1:06:41] upon the Lord. Now he didn't say how
[1:06:42] long you got to wait but you got to just
[1:06:44] wait in faith. because he's the high
[1:06:46] priest of your profession.
[1:06:49] Hallelujah. I read today. No, I'm sorry.
[1:06:51] I saw it today.
[1:06:53] Corey Tenblum. Am I saying that right?
[1:06:58] Boom. Tboom. I said bloom. Boom. She was
[1:07:01] a uh Christian woman, right?
[1:07:05] And she was in Germany during World War
[1:07:06] II. The Nazis were taking all these Jews
[1:07:09] away. Church, I'm just talking about
[1:07:11] waiting. Think about this thought about
[1:07:12] waiting. She would bring Jews in to
[1:07:14] protect them from the Nazis. When they'd
[1:07:15] hear the Nazis walking down the hallway,
[1:07:17] she had a hiding place, but in the
[1:07:19] walls, they had 70 seconds to hide all
[1:07:22] the people in this tiny little space.
[1:07:24] They had one little pot to use the
[1:07:25] bathroom in. Some of them had to wait in
[1:07:27] there 47 hours silently until the Nazis
[1:07:30] left in a room and they have to share a
[1:07:33] pot and go to the bathroom. They still
[1:07:34] got the pot in there.
[1:07:36] I'm talking about waiting on the Lord.
[1:07:40] and she saved hundreds of Jews lives.
[1:07:43] And this is a natural thing. Now,
[1:07:45] church, if they can wait that long just
[1:07:47] to save their natural life, what about
[1:07:49] us with the spiritual life? Hallelujah.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; Other words, help us to wait on God. And
[1:07:55] that's why I'm preaching this tonight. I
[1:07:56] think it'll help you to wait on God.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; God said, "I step in." If there's a a
[1:08:01] man or a husband or wife not doing
[1:08:03] something right, God says, "I'll step
[1:08:04] in.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; I'll be the father to the fatherness.
[1:08:08] I'll be the mother to the motherless.
[1:08:13] Now go to verse 30.
[1:08:15] What context is this, brother Jesse? Oh,
[1:08:17] you're gonna like this one. Even the
[1:08:19] youth shall faint and be weary.
[1:08:20] Everybody know which verse is next. And
[1:08:22] the young men shall utterly fail, but
[1:08:25] they that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[1:08:28] their strength. They shall mount up with
[1:08:30] wings as eagles. They shall run and not
[1:08:32] be weary. They shall walk and not faint.
[1:08:35] In other words, God says when you're
[1:08:36] weak, just wait on me and then I'll give
[1:08:38] you just the strength you need at just
[1:08:40] the right time.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; And then pretty soon you have so much
[1:08:43] strength, you'll forget you were tired.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says you'll run. Now
[1:08:47] you can run. And now you don't get tired
[1:08:49] BECAUSE GOD STEPPED IN. GOD ANOINTED
[1:08:51] YOU. GOD SENT HIS SPIRIT TO PROVIDE
[1:08:53] STRENGTH FOR YOU.
[1:08:54] &gt;&gt; RIGHT? AMEN.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:58] The promises of God are yay and amen.
[1:09:01] I'm almost done.
[1:09:04] Second Timothy 15.
[1:09:07] Notice Paul doesn't say uh Timothy. Wow.
[1:09:10] Uh your dad had such faith. He doesn't
[1:09:12] say that. His dad was a Greek.
[1:09:15] Who's how did faith or how did faith
[1:09:17] come into Timothy's life? Remember Paul
[1:09:19] SAID NOBODY IS LIKE-MINDED as me except
[1:09:21] that Gentile Timothy,
[1:09:24] the one I had to go circumcise.
[1:09:27] Huh?
[1:09:29] Who's most like me? Is it the Jews that
[1:09:31] knew the the Old Testament law or is it
[1:09:33] this gentile young man, this young
[1:09:35] pastor who does the work of evangelists
[1:09:37] as well?
[1:09:41] Paul says, "When I call to remembrance
[1:09:43] the unfeign." Now, that means sincere.
[1:09:46] No mask on his faith. Well, I'm trying
[1:09:49] to believe. I'm just trying to make it.
[1:09:51] No, church. He had genuine faith. I'm
[1:09:53] going to make it by God's grace.
[1:09:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; No matter what I go through, I'm going
[1:09:57] to make it.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; I've got faith in Jesus Christ. No
[1:10:00] matter who leaves me, no matter HOW MANY
[1:10:01] PEOPLE REJECT ME, I BELIEVE IN JESUS.
[1:10:03] HALLELUJAH.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; I I said I I remember your unfamed faith
[1:10:09] which first it was in your grandmother
[1:10:11] Lois and thy mother Ununice. And I am
[1:10:13] persuaded it's in thee also. Who's the
[1:10:17] one that invested in Timothy? It was his
[1:10:20] mom and his grandma.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; But no doubt God was right there as
[1:10:25] well. God was being a father to Timothy.
[1:10:28] Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; And God gave him a grandmother and a mom
[1:10:32] that loved the Lord. Church, I was
[1:10:34] reading through some of my old newspaper
[1:10:36] magazines. Z likes to Where's Z? He
[1:10:38] likes to look at my old magazines when I
[1:10:39] was high school. I was a sinner in high
[1:10:40] school. Even when I was a sinner in high
[1:10:42] school, when I was 17 years old, they
[1:10:44] interviewed me after we won the state
[1:10:45] championship. And they said, you know,
[1:10:46] uh, how does your family do this? You
[1:10:48] know, and I said, I have a wonderful
[1:10:50] Christian mother.
[1:10:52] I wasn't even saved. And I knew the
[1:10:55] whole secret to my success was my mom's
[1:10:57] prayers. I had been hit enough times in
[1:11:00] the head, brother Chris, to know that if
[1:11:02] there's anything good to come out of MY
[1:11:04] LIFE, IT WAS MY MOM THAT LOVED ME.
[1:11:06] HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; Not my dad who left me. I was, as much
[1:11:09] as I love my dad, and I forgiven him.
[1:11:10] BUT IT WAS MY MOM. And I text her last
[1:11:12] night. I said, "Mom, thanks for never
[1:11:13] leaving me." She said, "Oh, hun." She
[1:11:16] said, "I'm just trusting the Lord."
[1:11:18] I like that. Amen. I'm just trusting in
[1:11:21] the Lord. Well, me, too. Hallelujah. I'm
[1:11:23] just trusting in God.
[1:11:26] And her SANCTIFIED LIFE SANCTIFIED MY
[1:11:28] LIFE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; And now the faith of my mom, I believe,
[1:11:34] is in me, too.
[1:11:36] Hallelujah.
[1:11:39] See, Timothy's spiritual formation is
[1:11:42] traced back to faithful women, not a
[1:11:45] daddy.
[1:11:47] So, that means he had a heavenly father
[1:11:50] that was watching over him. If his
[1:11:52] natural dad wasn't there, spiritual
[1:11:54] daddy was there because I'm a father to
[1:11:57] the fatherless.
[1:11:58] And I gave you a grandma and a mom that
[1:12:02] helped develop real faith in your life.
[1:12:05] And they restrained I'll say like this.
[1:12:07] They restrained Timothy. Right. Try to
[1:12:10] keep parents try to keep them from doing
[1:12:11] as much sin. Try to keep as much sin out
[1:12:13] of their lives as possible. GO TO ANY
[1:12:15] LENGTHS to keep sin out of their lives.
[1:12:16] Don't become an Eli.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:21] go to every lengths to keep sin out of
[1:12:24] their lives. So, so, so they can be a
[1:12:26] Christian and they can have they can
[1:12:28] have confidence with Christian
[1:12:30] character.
[1:12:31] That's what we want to be in our church.
[1:12:34] Christians who have confidence in God
[1:12:36] because God has developed character in
[1:12:38] their life. Like I said, remember I said
[1:12:41] last week, I said we don't look at
[1:12:42] brother Rod and say, "Wow, you know,
[1:12:44] brother God gave Brother Rod the gift of
[1:12:46] character." No, he he has got that
[1:12:48] character through victory of prayers
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; and reading the word of God and
[1:12:52] confessing sin and pleading the blood of
[1:12:54] Jesus Christ.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; He just wasn't born with that. Nor are
[1:12:58] you and I born with character. We've got
[1:13:00] to go through the hard times. We got to
[1:13:01] have our faith tested. Amen. IT'S MORE
[1:13:03] PRECIOUS THAN THAT WHICH GOLD PERISHES.
[1:13:05] HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:13:19] Let's do one more.
[1:13:28] All right, let's uh finish with faithful
[1:13:31] good old faithful verse here.
[1:13:36] Well, you know what? I'm sorry. Let me
[1:13:37] go to Let's go to Psalm 25. I'm gonna
[1:13:38] close with Psalm 25. I got like numerous
[1:13:41] verses here. Let me close with Psalm 25.
[1:13:43] Uh
[1:13:46] verse 9,
[1:13:48] Psalm 25:9.
[1:13:55] Remember, Eli trembled at the ark. He
[1:13:57] trembled at the presence of God, but he
[1:14:00] didn't tremble at the sin in his
[1:14:02] children's life.
[1:14:04] Now, we should do both. We should
[1:14:06] tremble at the ark. The presence of God.
[1:14:07] People are emotional. The presence of
[1:14:09] God. I feel the Holy Spirit's here. We
[1:14:11] should tremble at that. But we should
[1:14:12] tremble when we see sin in the church as
[1:14:14] well
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; and get it out.
[1:14:18] If not, if we let the sin continue, we
[1:14:20] honor those sinners more than we honor
[1:14:22] God.
[1:14:24] And then God will I'll say like this.
[1:14:26] The Bible said he'll take away our
[1:14:27] candlestick.
[1:14:28] Brother said, "That's your pastor." Or
[1:14:30] that's the church. He'll just take the
[1:14:31] whole church and the pastor out of the
[1:14:32] city or out of the location.
[1:14:36] All right. Psalm 259.
[1:14:38] The meek will he guide in judgment. Who
[1:14:41] does who does God guide with the the
[1:14:42] right judgment? The humble.
[1:14:45] And the meek will he teach his way. Go
[1:14:47] to verse uh 10, 11, 12. All the paths of
[1:14:50] the Lord are mercy and truth. Amen. And
[1:14:53] the church said,
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; "Well, Jesse, you know, my the paths in
[1:14:55] my life are pretty hard." Well, the
[1:14:57] Bible calls them mercy and truth as
[1:14:59] well. All let's all say all. Can we all
[1:15:03] all your past? It's God's mercy to you.
[1:15:07] It's God's truth to you.
[1:15:10] unto such as keep his covenant. See, we
[1:15:13] got to keep it. And his testimonies.
[1:15:17] So covenant is the word. Testimonies are
[1:15:20] the things he's done in your life. Keep
[1:15:22] testifying of what God has done.
[1:15:25] Hallelujah. God did this for me. God did
[1:15:27] that for me. God's done this. God's
[1:15:29] faithful. Don't be discouraged. Just
[1:15:31] keep telling people the testimonies of
[1:15:33] what God has done.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Verse 11 and 12. For thy name's sake, oh
[1:15:38] Lord, pardon my iniquity, for it is
[1:15:40] great. And the church said,
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; right? We all commit iniquities. The
[1:15:44] church sometimes we commit great
[1:15:45] iniquities. Now, God help us to keep
[1:15:48] from the murder, adultery,
[1:15:51] the major ones.
[1:15:54] What man is he that fearth the Lord? Him
[1:15:57] shall he teach in the way that he shall
[1:16:00] choose? Didn't we end last week with the
[1:16:03] fear of the Lord? Let me get that verse.
[1:16:08] This will be my last verses here. Let's
[1:16:10] stand though. Musicians can come. Let's
[1:16:12] put those verses back up. Proverbs
[1:16:14] 14:16. Quesa. So, what I'm going to end
[1:16:18] it with same thing I did last week. What
[1:16:20] confidence do you have tonight?
[1:16:25] A wise man fearthth and departs from
[1:16:27] evil, but the fool rageth and is
[1:16:30] confident. You'd be surprised how many
[1:16:33] people purposely disobey God's word and
[1:16:35] they're still confident that things are
[1:16:37] going to work out well.
[1:16:40] Impossible.
[1:16:44] A wise man fears God so when he sees
[1:16:47] evil, he doesn't walk in it or she
[1:16:51] doesn't walk in it.
[1:16:54] Go to verse 26 and 27. I'm just
[1:16:56] reviewing last week.
[1:16:59] You've been a good audience tonight.
[1:17:00] Thank you for your attention.
[1:17:01] Hallelujah. I appreciate that.
[1:17:04] In the fear of the Lord is strong
[1:17:06] confidence. So see the sinner, the
[1:17:09] worker of iniquity is confident, but the
[1:17:11] believer should have a different kind of
[1:17:12] confidence.
[1:17:14] It's the confidence of true Christian
[1:17:16] character
[1:17:19] and his children shall have a place of
[1:17:21] refuge. Now, oh, I didn't even see that.
[1:17:23] My goodness. Oh my. If the father and
[1:17:26] mother don't keep the word of God, they
[1:17:28] don't have the fear of the Lord. The
[1:17:30] children will be open season for the
[1:17:32] devil,
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; right? Just like Eli's children, right?
[1:17:36] Because Eli didn't fear God. What
[1:17:38] happened? His children got they the
[1:17:40] children got into sexual sins. They got
[1:17:42] into the obesity. They got into stealing
[1:17:45] the things of God
[1:17:47] because Eli didn't fear the Lord.
[1:17:51] Hallelujah.
[1:17:54] The fear of the Lord is a fountain of
[1:17:56] life to depart from the snares of death.
[1:18:00] Amen.
[1:18:02] Church, how many you want to have
[1:18:03] confidence with real Christian character
[1:18:05] tonight? God sees those hands. Let's
[1:18:07] have a word of prayer. I trust you were
[1:18:08] blessed tonight by God's grace.
[1:18:11] That might be my last part in this
[1:18:13] series. We'll kind of see. I've got
[1:18:15] numerous other series I want to preach,
[1:18:19] but for tonight, let's bow our heads.
[1:18:38] Dear Lord Jesus, we want to have the
[1:18:39] fear of the Lord tonight. The fear of
[1:18:41] the Lord departs from evil.
[1:18:45] The fear of the Lord is strong
[1:18:46] confidence.
[1:18:51] Lord, I felt led to look at the family
[1:18:53] here tonight.
[1:18:55] So, I trust that the Holy Spirit now
[1:18:57] will strengthen our families, God.
[1:19:01] Lord, I remember I preached that sermon,
[1:19:03] training and restraining years ago. It
[1:19:06] is our duty to train the children, make
[1:19:08] sure they develop good habits, and then
[1:19:10] also restrain them when they do evil to
[1:19:12] make it less. Do whatever we have to do
[1:19:15] to lessen their sins.
[1:19:18] And then we'll be honoring God.
[1:19:25] Lord, you see the families in our little
[1:19:26] church here, Lord. You see the families
[1:19:28] of those listening online, dear God. I
[1:19:30] know numerous people look to our
[1:19:32] archives and our live streaming, Lord
[1:19:34] God. So, I just pray that the word that
[1:19:37] was preached tonight, may it fall on
[1:19:38] good ground.
[1:19:40] Hallelujah. Which Jesus called, Lord
[1:19:43] Jesus, you called it an honest heart.
[1:19:47] May everyone who heard this sermon be
[1:19:49] honest with what they've heard. And if
[1:19:51] they're obeying it, may they rejoice and
[1:19:53] keep the fear of the Lord with strong
[1:19:55] confidence. If they've sinned against
[1:19:56] God or if they're tempted as a snare to
[1:19:59] disobey the word of God, may they run
[1:20:02] from that wickedness.
[1:20:06] Grant, Lord Jesus.
[1:20:09] That's my prayer, Lord God. May the
[1:20:12] mothers, fathers, husbands, and wives,
[1:20:14] may they honor God above everything
[1:20:16] else, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:20:20] Keep us from loving. Keep us from
[1:20:21] compromise, Lord God. Hallelujah.
[1:20:25] Keep us in the word of the Lord.
[1:20:28] Grant it, Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. And
[1:20:31] let us remember that you're the father
[1:20:33] of the fatherlessness. Hallelujah.
[1:20:35] You're the mother of the motherless.
[1:20:37] Hallelujah.
[1:20:39] You said you never leave us nor forsake
[1:20:41] us. You said all things work together
[1:20:43] for good to them that are the called
[1:20:46] according to thy purpose.
[1:20:50] That's what you said.
[1:20:52] You said the faint would get strength
[1:20:55] that increases and if they wait on you,
[1:20:57] they'd rise up like an eagle.
[1:21:00] That's what you said, Lord God. We
[1:21:03] choose to believe the word of God. We
[1:21:05] choose the fear of the Lord tonight.
[1:21:09] We want to be alive while we live, not
[1:21:13] dead while we liveth. Dead in sins and
[1:21:17] trespasses. Oh God. Hallelujah. Let's be
[1:21:20] quickened by the Holy Spirit, quickened
[1:21:21] by the word of God to live every word
[1:21:24] that we know.
[1:21:28] For Lord Jesus, you told us, Lord, the
[1:21:30] more we know, the more responsibility
[1:21:33] that we have.
[1:21:36] It is required that a steward be found
[1:21:39] faithful.
[1:21:41] Lord, we are stewards of the mysteries
[1:21:43] of God as Paul tells us. God, let us be
[1:21:46] found faithful. Let us live such holy,
[1:21:48] sanctified lives that other people will
[1:21:51] be sanctified by our lives.
[1:21:54] Hallelujah.
[1:21:56] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:21:59] Hallelujah.
[1:22:01] Blessed be the name of the Lord. We
[1:22:03] worship you tonight, Jesus. Bless your
[1:22:05] people for their attention, their
[1:22:07] devotion to the word of God. Strengthen
[1:22:09] the home church, I pray. Keep us
[1:22:11] unleavened, hallelujah, in your
[1:22:13] presence. Thank you for the word we've
[1:22:15] heard last weekend and tonight. Lord
[1:22:17] God, bless the saints in the house,
[1:22:19] Lord, tonight in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:22:22] And the saint said,
