cuz God is able to say things that's that he knows needs to be said am but as a man I'm aw I'm unaware of right and that's why you come you come to hear from God amen amen so I pray that you would help us and bless us and meet the needs that's present Among Us let's just if we will bow our hearts and our head in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we love you and Lord we ask that you would please help us to love you more you're worthy of so much more father than what we've given you up into this point but God that's why we come Lord God to submit ourselves to you Lord that you might make us better we can't make ourselves better Lord you're not looking for self-righteousness you're looking for your righteousness that comes by the indwelling of your spirit Lord having its way on the inside of us so father let that be the case Lord may we experience that on a greater level Lord God just submitting ourselves to a mighty God that's able to really satisfy the Deep longings of our hearts Lord there are many needs Among Us this this evening father God and you know everybody in particular you know their names you know their situations you know their prayers you know their burdens Lord you know their cares you know about every one of us Lord God so Lord you know exactly what to say and how to say it please help me Father God to just be yielded to you Lord and may you be able to speak according to your will we love you Lord God forgive us of our sins and of our iniquities Lord father we want to be strength and Lord we want to have a more Victorious walk with you father and you're able to give us that Lord so we ask in all these things by your grace in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Let the church say amen amen amen let's give the Lord another hand [Applause] clap amen um I'm grateful for what God did for us on last night and uh I pray that he come again and just Minister uh and and only the way in which he can uh to give us something uh that will be of a benefit to our practical everyday lives right that's what's important things that we can actually apply amen so let's with that being said let's go to Proverbs Chapter 6 and verse 16 we'll start there thank God for the visitors God bless you anden I'm a I'm a visiting Minister from Columbia South Carolina amen so uh thank God for allowing you to be among us tonight okay so Proverbs Chapter 6 I want to start at verse 16 it says these six things doth the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him and so if God hates something that should be an important focal point for you and I right because God has given us information that'll help us to better navigate right it'll help us to avoid certain things because we don't want to we don't want to displease him right we want to be pleasing to him so when he gives us this information this itting to make us feel bad or to kind of bring an atmosphere of Gloom right but is actually to give us something that'll help us to defeat the enemy because there one is God has one enemy right and that's the devil and his that realm of demons right and their number one goal is to make God's creation hurt him so evil spirits they they know the word right and they use the word against God amongst his people that's what happened in the Garden of Eden God said don't eat of this tree right and Satan came and persuaded them to do the very thing that God said don't do because he knew that would hurt God so even though we're human right and all of us like the Bible says we all come short of the glory of God yes sir right but because God loves us so much it's like regardless of what we've done or what present fault we have in our lives he come to make us better he come to heal us hallelujah whenever God deals with things in our lives he's actually bringing about a healing and he said himself right he said himself he said I didn't come for people that that feel like they're already all right he said but I came for those that know they have a need for a physician right anybody that go to the hospital they don't go to the hospital because they are they they feel like they healthy you know they go to the hospital because it's something that's that's not quite right I got a pain in my ear loob I got a a tingling in my finger that ain't supposed to be there so let me go to the doctor and make sure that everything is okay or to see what's going on and that's when we that when we come to Christ like that Christ said that's what I welcome sir cuz he knows that we are imperfect people listen we're in our transition back to Perfection he's redeeming us Saints right and that means that we were already with him but through Adam and Eve the fall took place but now he came to bring his children back so as I go over this lesson tonight keep that in mind that God is bringing us back to our rightful positions as Sons and Daughters of God Amen all right six things he says these six things does God does the Lord hate he says yay seven are an Abomination unto him and he lifts them out he says a proud look it's number one a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood Verse 18 and heart that devid rth Wicked imaginations it says feet that be Swift in running to Mischief it says a false witness which speaketh lies and it says and he that sth Discord among Brethren may the Lord bless his word tonight Saints you may be seated I'm really apprecia of the lesson that we had on last night because as brother Jesse knows even though you're a minister many times the messages that are delivered are coming from a heart that's been dealt with by God in that same area sir so God comes to me and he helps me and he deals with me and it becomes so real until I got to tell somebody you know I'm like Lord I see it so when what we're going to talk about tonight regretfully I say that I've I've fallen victim to this at times in my life and the Lord had to come to me and deal with my heart and help me to be able to see no you're my son that's not how you're supposed to walk that's not how you're supposed to conduct yourself amen amen so this is instruction tonight if you haven't dealt with this yet this will help you to Shield yourself from any future attacks by evil spirits to try to bring you subject to it and if you have dealt with this already then this won't be anything new to you because I'm sure as a daughter or a son of God God has already dealt with you in the ways that we're going to talk about right so this is to help us to be uh brought breast to help us to be more aware okay so as an overall title now I want to go to another scripture here I just didn't want to keep you standing uh let's go to Proverbs Chapter 11 as I was reading this scripture this morning I really appreciated it appreciate all the word but it's just kind of was in a channel and according to the inspiration God was placing on my heart Proverbs chap 11 starting at verse 12 it says he that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbor that says a lot because to be void of wisdom means to be void of the understanding of the word of God you're not instructed you understand what I'm saying you don't understand the importance of certain things and the Bible clearly says that we should love our neighbors as ourself right so God continuously promotes love amongst all mankind right but mainly amongst his family because he knows that those that are not ordained to be with him they're going to be tools of the enemy until the day they pass right but there are people in the earth that are actual children of God right and amongst his family God promotes love I'm a father of five and that's one thing that I thoroughly promote in my household and atmosphere of love right uh not not just imitating love right uh I I try to pay careful attention to my children right because you know sometimes they can try to act like everything is okay but with the Lord's help if you pay close attention sometimes you can pick up on things that's lying beneath the surface right in the Holy Spirit I have a parent to go in and begin to deal with those deeper issues isn't that right because we want a healthy family we want a healthy family both naturally and spiritually right so how much more God as he looks over his family right he wants to promote love he wants a family that's unified he wants a family that has a real care one for another isn't that right so so in our everyday lives understand that's God's number one goal and in order for that to really transpire or take place you must be born again that's that's that's the piece the vital piece that when that's present it enables all of this to be able to come to pass and be made flesh in our own lives so God will give us instru the the the a major part of it is the teaching of the word but you have to go beyond the teaching of the word right to entering into a real relationship with Jesus Christ and then once you have that real relationship with Jesus Christ he ushers you into amen the fulfilling of the further part of his word you'll be baptized in his name isn't that right and once you're baptized in it well for one he'll lead you to repent amen those men at Pentecost you know as as Peter was anointed by the Holy Ghost and he's ministering to thousands amen and he's not he's not counting numbers of how many people out there God just had a message he wanted to speak through his servant that had received his spirit and as he was delivering that message the Holy Ghost because the people were open and receptive Amen to whatever was being said God had the atmosphere set and as he ministered those words amen the Bible says it wasn't as though he was rebuking the people all together but the Bible says they were pricked in their hearts and when that pricking of God took place meaning it was God encouraging them to come to a a better life right and when that pricking was taking place the the the the people that were being pricked they said what must we do to be saved and then God gave them the answer because previous to that he told Peter I'm going to give you the keys to the kingdom so now it was time for those keys to be put into use what was those key Saints Peter responded when they cried out in despair he says repent every one of you that means to turn away from your wrong ways and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and he said ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost now what is the Holy Ghost Jesus told the disciples he said ye shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you so it's actual power to begin to live like God because Jesus Christ himself he said I will be with you even in you so now when Christ comes in us and we yield to that Spirit now that takes a bold on the inside of us he's able to live his own life his own word through us now that's Christianity and then you just grow strong stronger more mature and he reveals more of himself to you from that point well I know everybody is saying brother McBride what's your title it's a strange title I've never dealt with it before so I need your prayers my title is the spirit of a tail Bearer The Spirit of a tail Bearer so uh for our visitors on last night uh the subject that the Lord had us to deal with it just dealt with how we allow ourselves to speak right because what we say with our mouths Jesus said it's not what goes inside of a man that defiles him he said but it's the thing that comes out of a man whatever you say right because whatever you say those are words and your words come from thoughts but where do those thoughts come from you can tell by the nature of what you getting ready to say or what you thinking about saying or what you already said you can pretty much tell where it comes from in respect to good or evil in source as a source because whenever Satan anoints us the things that we say aren't too kind they lack kindness they lack compassion they lack love they lack consideration why that's what the the enemy likes to swow amongst mankind he want he wants mankind to be full of all those things amen he wants us to be full of hurts and wounds and he wants us to be you know uh uh uh the one that actually causes hurts and wounds so the the the the tongue itself the Bible says death and life is in the power of the tongue every day we speak words who did now for a little baby that can't talk they'll be exempt but for the most part everybody in here have said words today yes and according to the Bible Jesus said himself every man and woman in the day of judgment you're going to have to give an account for Every Idle Word you speak so every single word that come you know how many words we speak in a day we can't even count right but Christ said every word that's spoken you're going to be held accountable for those words and the devil knows that so what does he want to do he wants to anoint us to be able to speak speak very Loosely in ways that we shouldn't speak and I I want to bring I'm trying to be very balanced yes in my approach to this because we're human and because we human we got real feelings you can be minding your business trying you you I'm I'mma do right you know you can say I'mma do right you know I'mma Be Kind because you can see a need well Lord I am a little rough I get too edgy I'm too irritable Lord and you know because see God is Not irritable God is Not edgy God is Not frustra and because he's supposed to be our father he don't want our he don't want his children to be characterized by that also right but the devil he don't want you to live in a peaceful manner so he's always devising he studies us evil spirits study us and they'll cause somebody to come from somewhere to provoke you to try to pull you out of the right frame of mind into a wrong frame of mind so that overall you can hurt God but I want to say this and I know we all appreciate it aren't you appreciative of the love of God Amen the Bible says when we were yet sinners didn't even consider God wasn't thinking about God living living a life that totally was against him allog together the Bible says he commended his love toward us while we were in that state in sending Jesus Christ to die for the ungodly cuz even though that was our then State he knew that we would come out of that into a better state so he was placing he he was initiating his Plan of Redemption which started with a cleansing blood I want you to understand if you don't already understand you're forgiven of every sin you you ever [Applause] committed when Jesus Christ died on Calvary I want you to listen it's sins you ain't even committed yet we in 2024 we ain't hit 2025 yet it's things that God know that you going to do in 2025 and he already took care of it at [Applause] Calvary it was an alls sufficient sacrifice can we say praise the Lord to that Saints amen that's that's Weaponry that that that's an M16 against the enemy that's a nuclear that's a nuclear bomb against the the forces of Darkness they don't want that to be understood cuz that bring listen that'll bring about a power and a change that's something man okay let's let's kind of get I'm not going to be long tonight the Lord was dealing with my heart all day on this I did much studying but I ain't gonna try to lay all this on you guys tonight I know we got service tomorrow morning and it's a lot of things got to be done tonight once you get home so we'll just hit some of the highlights let's go here if we will to Numbers chapter 16 amen so again keep in mind this is the help to protect us from falling subject so God has given us the information we need and by his Spirit he'll bring it to our I'll say our rembrance right and as and as we see this Spirit approaching I pray God help you to identify it and withstand it number 16 starting at verse one it says now Kora the son of ishar the son of coath the son of Levi and Dayan and Abram the sons of eliab and an uh the son of pth Sons of Ruben took men and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel 250 princes of the of the assembly famous in the congregation men of renowned and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron so there's detail that obvious obviously is there but it's not written right so Kora was a leader in this movement I would call it so just think about this Saints cor was born a baby right born and sin all that stuff right but he grew up he he came Through the Ages and whatever phases of his life or whatever so now he's at the age that he is now and God by his grace he helped these people to be delivered from Egypt am right so Coral was there in Egypt right he he he he saw the lifestyle they became subject to he saw the change and God allowing a pharaoh to rise up that didn't know Joseph isn't that right he he he saw that whole shift amen when they when now now now they begin to be despised and look down upon and all the only reason why that happened is that God was getting them ready to be delivered you know God will allow things to happen in your life to cause you to be very unsettled many times when people really come to Christ to become more serious or to give their lives to Christ it's because trouble done drove them in that direction in whatever way form of fashion that might actually come in that's what happens right in most cases so God was getting them ready to be delivered so that they can get uncomfortable in Egypt so they can cry out for a deliverer so God can send Moses so now cor was there and Dayan was there through this whole situation they saw God send Moses in they saw God use Moses right they saw things that was just Beyond human ability they they saw God use Moses Amen to bring about such miracles to take down a whole mighty nation you understand they they they they witness a god parting a red sea and and saw the Egyptians being driven into the Red Sea and saw God swallow them up in the Red Sea to they wasn't no more they came out on the other side rejoicing because God wrought such a great deliverance from the Egyptians amen but now they're coming on out and they're on their way and unfortunately they had a part to fulfill that wasn't a good part god already knew this wasn't a surprise to God people that are not going to follow God God already knows that but his concern are those that he knows are going to follow him everybody has a role to to play but his focus is on his family so Kora now now they're pass the Egyptian situation and whatever and they're moving on with life but now all of a sudden somehow someway a spirit of jealousy begins to get a hold of cor's mind it's just a whisper any sin that you and I have ever committed it started off as a whisper Spirits just come and suggesting things and where we make our mistakes is where Eve made her mistake the devil began to whisper through the serpent and what did Eve do she stopped for a moment to pay attention that's why the Bible says that when thoughts come to us that try that that are against Christ in the way that we know Christ wants us to live the Bible says we're to cast those thoughts away you might say well brother I can't do that well if you love to live and a thought comes to you drive your car to that bridge and then get out your car and jump off the bridge if you love to live now you you going to be like hold on what you'll go home and say honey you know what something crazy happened to me something tried to tell me to jump off of a bridge is't that crazy right but there are things there are ways that the enemy can approach us because he studies us he'll try to approach us in a way that's irresistible something you can easily cuz he don't watch you and he sees what you have a tendency to gravitate toward you know he knew our previous life he knew our strongholds he's a spirit he ain't got a memory like a human he he was there all the way back in the Garden of Eden you know so he studied mankind he's a great psychologist he understands the human makeup he understands the human mind you know he knows how to manipulate you see it all through the Bible right so now he's coming to Kora and he's planting this seed of a thought to make him feel as though you know he wanted to be somebody obviously you know even though he came and worded it the way that he worded it obviously he wanted to have more of a recognition amongst the people so the devil begins to talk to him in this particular way and when he does it's able now now a spirit of jealousy is able to come upon Kora and that became his his inspiration that became what motivated him and now he went on and he went to go and try to find other people that he can kind of begin to share these things with that that that that'll that that'll be able to join in in that likeminded and he might have gone to Dayan and said you know I I just got I got something that's on my heart you know it's kind of been bothering me a little bit you know I want to share it with you you know I don't know I could be wrong he didn't feel like he was wrong but that's the approach see a a devil has to come in a very deceptive way as though he's not meaning no harm but he's meaning full harm I don't mean no harm you know I might be wrong you know but doesn't it seem like Moses kind of like I don't know like he think he's somebody like he he's trying to make himself a prince over us or he's trying to be a leader to us like what what do you think he's trying to do because I just been watching him lately and something just ain't sitting right in my spirit about Moses trying to sound spiritual but it was a devil sir listen that cor himself he didn't even know that he was being dealt with by devil isn't that how it is if we could see the spirits because every Spirit has a form but sometimes God has Grace on you and I he don't let us be able to see those Spirits because it'll it might probably make you have a make you have a heart attack or something but Spirits are real like persons like it's it's a real being they're in this room right now but angels are in here too the spirit of God is here you understand what I'm saying so that presents a battle to the human mind cuz even as I'm ministering there'll be spirits that will come and try to attract your attention off somewhere because it wants to render the word ineffective it don't want you to catch on to the lesson that you might be able to use what's being taught to come against that enemy and gain the victory praise the Lord so now he's got Dayan and daythan is like you know what I can see that I ain't never saw it like see now when you open up yourself to gossip the spirit that's bringing it now it transfers to you we understand that but they say birds of a FEA do what h so then that just began to build now it's two so then now because they have a good standing amongst the people now the see the enemy he Cho the enemy uses people that are in influential positions cuz he knows that people that look up to them man major all of them may not follow their leading but majority of the people they'll just blindly follow along and not question nothing but because they look up to this person they just value their opinions and their views yes sir glory to God we in the presidential races right now let let me bear with me for a moment yes sir I didn't even finish reading that particular scripture did I I didn't partially read two scriptures oh man um there's this particular scripture here it is just bear with me for a moment we want to come back and touch on all these areas by the grace of God to try to bring it together you know for you Proverbs 16 verse 27 because I just mentioned the presidential elections and it's just how many understand it's an ungodly Spirit you can tell by the characteristics of it look at what they do in order to be successful over a candidate you got to go back and you're going to and and they're they're fulfilling Proverbs 16 verse 27 it says an ungodly man do what dith up evil that's their whole objective oh I'mma have a debate again so and so he get their team okay now you go out and you search everything you pull me up all they don't say pull me up all the achievements all the achievements they had you make sure you get all them to me because I want to bring all their achievements out in the debate no they want to search and scan and comb over the candidates that they're going against lives to do what pull up all the bad things so that they can bring them before the public and their and their number one objective is to make that person look way worse than what they are you understand what I'm saying that's a spirit of a tail Bearer and God say I hate that glory to God so God listen God is nowhere in any form of fashion he's not he's not in politics at all now God controls who gets in into position because there are certain things that has to has to be fulfilled and that person was made to be the one to step forward to fulfill that but God is not within the inner workings of politics God ain't a Democrat a liberal or a Republican or whatever else they got out there he's God you understand praise God okay so it says an ungodly man dith up evil and in his lips there is listen as a burning fire we went over that last night right it says that tongue is set on fire of Hell meaning the spirit that's behind the thoughts that's bringing the words by the nature of it it's bringing a slander it's trying to hurt somebody it's trying to make somebody look bad that's the spirit of a tail Bearer and God say I hate that so right now all of these elections and them going about doing things in that manner God is displeased with the whole thing that's right and they're ignorant of it they still profess Christian faith and I won't take that away from nobody but they're ignorant to the enemy's devices so now cor begins to go out with Dayan and they begin to move about the crowd move about Israel and they begin to capture any and everybody that they can persuade to fall subject or to enter into this Same Spirit and they gained a lot of success right Saints and notice who they went for notice how how it says this um in verse two it says uh and they rose up before Moses it says with certain of the children with it says certain it was strategic with certain of the children of Israel it says 250 princes of the how many who were princes they were rulers in the assembly it says famous in the congregation because of we have these people stepping forth with us it gives us more weight it gives us more it gives us a power it increases our power of persuasion amongst the people so now that one spirit that started off with cor and it begin to move and multiply you know it begin to take up that whole group that whole group was under that same anointing amen and now they're coming against God's chosen Prophet they would deceive Saints you know the was getting them in trouble the devil was setting them up for a destruction and they didn't even realize it that's what this this Spirit of tail bearing amen it's evident right here and this is what it does it's trying to lead people to a destruction CU for one it knows that God hates it and it wants God it wants God to be hurt by his children being made to be trophies of evil spirits that had a riddle in their lives with improper Behavior but I thank God for his grace CU even though like I said I know I've been a victim of it cuz the way that Spirits play they play and and this is this situation but Spirits are ride in on you when when they see you are the most vulnerable when you've been hurt when you've been done wrong and now it seems merited where they did me wrong so they deserve to be talked about uh in whatever way I'm feeling they deserve to be talked about we'll get into some things here I'm running out of time okay so now they go and they present themselves to Moses and they say look you take too much upon yourself Moses say you make us feel like you think you're the only one that God deal with God talked to all of us Moses never said that what they were accusing him of it was that evil spirit that had come upon them to bring about listen that was just an imagination that wasn't even reality Moses wasn't fulfilling none of that it wasn't even a real case but Spirits build cases in people's minds you know how many Lord have mer you know how many people are in prison wrongfully right now when I'm at my job there's certain things that happen and I don't know how they do it but somehow they link my name into certain things and I did certain things and I said you know what I hope you never become a juror because you just as wrong as two left shoes and I hope nobody has to depend on your decision in their court case but isn't that how it is we're all subject how many times have we looked at things and seem like we can pin it down thoroughly amen and and and and and just to come to find that it you absolutely are wrong you mean I'm looking right at it you were doing this and you said this and you mean to tell me that wasn't the case at all that happened to me that happened to me with my wife years ago a spirit was coming to her to try to make her accept a particular line of thought concerning me and that same I didn't even know that and that same Spirit was working with me in the same way in the same line of thought concerning her it was trying to pit us against one another she was she came out the better person cuz I came home and I thought about that thing while I was at where I said man this got to be the case you know and she was just as good as guilty in my mind I said you know I'm I'm going to go home we going to have a talk about this and I got home and I got my case all built up in my mind and I was like yeah man we going to deal with this cuz you got to see what you were wrong at and I told her what was on my mind and she looked at me she said McBride CU I was I was in the Marine court she called me by my last she said McBride you're not going to believe that she said but that same thought came to me concerning you today and the Lord showed it to me he helped me to understand it I said what I said you telling me I was just used by a devil and that bother that bothered me you mean to tell me this whole thing was wrong and that from that point it it it it it it it it provoke me to be more careful last night we went over that scripture it says slow to speak slow to ride quick to listen don't be so quick on the trigger consider your own thoughts go and take time to pray about it to see if the Lord will give you Clarity before you go and rush into a situation and bring a false accusation Dayan and they should have prayed they should have prayed because because they didn't pray and they allowed the devil to get a hold of them to come against God servant like that you know what God did God God allowed the whole earth to be opened up and Dayan and K and their families innocent people they died because of these men being moved by an evil spirit to come against God in a false accusation because that was God's servant and he placed him there that SP Spirit of tail bearing is very dangerous sir and we want to be able to be free from it at all cost that means you're going to have to fight because like I said we're human we get hurt and we go through things or whatever and it gets so strong in your heart you just want to tell somebody about but if you ain't in the right Spirit when you tell it you're going to tell it in a victim standpoint H is that right when you feel when you feeling a certain way you just you feel like you the V I'm the victim and you know those feelings and listen know that that devil knows it sees you it it wants to capitalize on your situation it want to int it wants to intensify your hurt it wants to intensify your pain it wants you it want to get your feeling so worked up until now you let now you can easily open yourself up you say you know what I got to talk to somebody that's the first mistake if you if you feel you can't talk to the person the next person that should be on your list to talk to is God because when you talk to God about it he's able to give you Clarity he's able to ease you in your spirit so you're not going into a person to create a bigger issue I'mma read to you this I found this I'm going have to close his Saints I ain't nowhere near nowhere near but there's a few points I want to make here I found this and I just the way that it was worded I just was like man that's good it's just randomly off of the internet right it's talking about backbiting gossiping and tail bearing and just so you know just to kind of help you to follow me a little more closely the word tail Bearer it means a person who maliciously gossips or reveal Secrets the word maliciously maliciously mean in a manner characterized by malice or ill will with the intent to do harm if you're hurt and somebody hurt you it shouldn't be that way but because we're human if the Lord don't help you kind of want them to feel a little something too know like no you need to feel something because you did you hurt me or whatever you know and that's how that Spirit slips in it takes advantage of people in those situations so all right so that's that's what maliciously stands for a means and then malice you know that's the root word is the intention or desire to do evil but the person themselves aren't really design to do evil they just don't know that they're being used and it's the enemy that's putting their minds in that in that cycle of thought so this particular person was kind of dealing with backbiting gossiping and tail bearing and notice how they word this it says back Bing go backbiting gossiping and tail bearing are very deadly and very dangerous besetting sins it just caus multiple people to die as we read in the scripture so it's very dangerous right it says um these are sins that we use our tongue to commit it says these besetting sins recruit others to fulfill its Endeavor uh while destroying a person a community Nations and even countries didn't we just witnessed that in the Scripture it says listen now it destroys families because nobody in here knows my natural family like like my aunts and uncles and whatever I have a particular aunt and I love her but all my life my memory of her ever since I was a child is that she was the one that took advantage or that she was the one that gossiped about all the weaknesses of those that had problems she would gossip to me about my own mother you know I love her and in my own way since the Lord start dealing with my heart I try to encourage her in the word you know in a way to where she don't realize I'm dealing with that but to try to help her to see herself and become more aware of what God's word says in that area we don't want to be that individual that's used to tear other people down in the minds of someone else cuz God hates that it says destroys families it destroys churches friendships businesses careers Etc it says these besetting these besetting sins begin like the waterfall above and pour and pour until it spreads all around far and wide soaking and affecting everything as the waterfall does below below where it's falling from all right I'm going end with this right here because it's just past 8:00 and I know we got service tomorrow and I want to just be respectful in that way and I I wouldn't be saying that if I wasn't mindful of it so I'm not so much so catering but just in my heart I'm feeling when I'm feeling to draw it to a close and I'mma end on this I got so much more I won't be able to get to it but uh you can just do a Bible search in the Bible on tail Bearer yes tail Bearer uh I I was going to deal with backbiting but I'm not going to be able to get into that um so much so but uh you know they kind of go hand in hand right very similar um but I want to leave you with this right here this is the Song of Solomon uh chapter 2 starting at verse 15 it says um take us the foxes the little foxes yes and it says that spoil the vines for our Vines have tender grapes and I found this and I wanted to share this with you because I appreciated how it was worded it says this phrase little foxes spoil the vine is a metaphor from the Bible Song of Solomon it calls out the chapter and verse that describes how small seemingly harmless things can cause significant problems in the verse the speaker says catch for us the foxes the little foxes that ruin The Vineyards are Vineyards that are in bloom the foxes symbolize potential issues that could harm a relationship such as gossip selfish thoughts or Li the speaker instructs people to take preventative measures yes amen and that's the purpose for us bringing this message tonight Saints so that we can begin to take preventative measures right to protect their love amen from anything that could harm it the fox is a little because it's often the small things that are overlooked that cause the most damage can we say praise the lord lord so may the Lord help us to keep the little foxes of tail bearing away from our Vineyards of love because they seek to destroy it to ruin it it don't want to have the it don't want the fruits to come forth amen the fruits of the spirit when when when these things are present within lives within churches or what have you right in this case I'mma I'm I'mma emphasize churches all right I'm I'mma leave you with this like this will be the real thing I leave you with all right this is when the message of Christ is the mystery of God reveal he says love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say he says now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning Satan won't let that stay that way no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in and make them a Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit them down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it with it he says don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with it anything he says you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another that's the father dealing with his family right God is saying okay you got a difference or whatever hey just pray for one another forgive one another that's why he said in the Bible when you stand praying how many of us pray in here how many pray now the Bible says when you stand praying in order for your prayers to even be heard by God he said when you stand praying he said forgive so that you can be forgiven also we're not even though somebody do us wrong and hurt us we're not justified in in and and holding that against that person because how many times do we transgress against God in a day glory and what's the comfort that we have that we can go to a god that so love us that even though we made a mistake and we've heard him oh man we've heard him his love is so great and so rich until he'll forgive me for what I've done wrong and allow me to go as though I never did it in the first place you understand that it's a sea of forgetfulness God will never bring that back up to you again so if he does that for us when you stand praying he said forgive so that you'll be forgiven also amen amen he goes on and he says the enemy will come and he and when he does just cling that much closer together and the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you if somebody comes against you with an accusation or is a tail Bearer against you God wants you to pray for that person now that takes a power cuz if that person is slandering you and and spreading about false rumors or whatever you want to set them straight I want you to understand you ain't gonna do me like that right and God comes and say put your finger down put your arm down calm your tongue down huh this my house you my daughter my son and I ain't going for that behavior now I want you to hug and make up praise God I'm glad to be a part of this family the family of God that's the best family in the whole world ain't nothing like it aren't you glad to be a part of the family of God he's a good father he's a provider whatever you have a need of can he Supply it huh and Beyond listen a natural father now I can pray for my children and the Lord by his grace allowed me to pray for them or whatever but man our father he holds healing from physical ailments from spiritual conditions he can heal you completely and make you whole you talking about a satisfaction you ain't experienc satisfaction until you've entered into this this body of the Lord Jesus Christ many people are going about trying to satisfy things in their heart that they're longing for they feel like they missing something but even Jesus told a woman at the well and I'm stopping here he says now if you knew who you were talking to he said you would ask me for a drink yes and when you drink of this water this living water he said you ain't you ain't going to want nothing else to drink amen you will never thirst again meaning your life will be made complete all the areas in your life that you're failing in and the enemy has taken advantage of you in I'll heal all those places up and give you a spirit and the Bible says when that woman who was a ill Fain woman left he said out of your belly shall flow rivers of Living Water that woman left changed she was so changed until the very City that she she had a a well-known reputation within when they heard that woman's testimony along with the spirit she was anointed by it caused them to want to come and see amen oh my
