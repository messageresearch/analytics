[34:00] forgive me I'd like to take your Bibles
[34:06] to Revelation chapter 14 I like to
[34:08] continue on that revelation series
[34:16] Revelation chapter 14
[34:18] I like to greet all the saints good to
[34:20] see the Saints in house the Lord tonight
[34:21] praise God thank God for His mercy for
[34:26] another opportunity to be in the house
[34:27] of the Lord
[34:35] we like to Lord willing look at verse 13
[34:39] it's kind of where we left off last
[34:40] Wednesday night Sunday we looked at
[34:47] numerology and then God's purpose in the
[34:49] evening and here I think we'll pick up
[34:51] tonight here on the book of Revelation
[35:02] 13 is such a strange verse you know
[35:07] verses 1 to 12 we looked at last week
[35:11] and we saw the 144,000 on Mount Zion and
[35:16] then three angels fly in the heavens and
[35:20] preach the gospel brother Ram said was
[35:23] Martin Luther John Wesley and the
[35:26] seventh angel brother branham and then
[35:31] now verse 13 gives another warning so
[35:36] it's almost like knew that there would
[35:38] be saints reading about the Tribulation
[35:40] Period but yet
[35:41] they'd still be in the Gentile church
[35:43] age and they would need some
[35:45] encouragement from the Lord so verse 13
[35:48] is encouragement 14 to 20 is Armageddon
[35:53] so let's look to here tonight Lord
[35:55] willing we'll finish 14 and begin 15 15s
[35:59] one of the shortest chapter in the book
[36:00] of Revelation
[36:03] and then Lord willing maybe 16 we'll see
[36:05] let's just read verse 13 together on
[36:08] three ready one two three
[36:11] and I heard a voice from heaven saying
[36:14] unto me write blessed are the Dead which
[36:17] die in the Lord from henceforth
[36:20] yayyyy saith the spirit that they may
[36:22] rest from their labors and their works
[36:25] do follow them amen may God as blessing
[36:28] the rejas word may be seated so we'll
[36:37] look at these here tonight by God's
[36:39] grace we're trying to make as much
[36:41] progress as we can let me pull up my
[36:44] notes here and trust you've been
[36:51] enjoying the book of Revelation amen I
[36:53] believe this is part 94 tonight by God's
[36:57] grace we ended last week with the
[37:02] teaching that the prophet of God taught
[37:05] under the fifth seal the importance of
[37:08] having the commandments of God the Old
[37:09] Testament and the testimony of Jesus
[37:11] Christ the New Testament now verse 13 I
[37:15] said it's quite a peculiar verse as
[37:19] where it's placed we see that John is
[37:24] told right blessed are the Dead which
[37:26] die in the Lord from henceforth now of
[37:29] course this is speaking to John here in
[37:31] the Isle of Patmos on 80/90 right right
[37:36] around the ninety so right about the
[37:38] turn of the first century and it's right
[37:41] written blessed are the Dead which die
[37:43] in the Lord from henceforth so anyone
[37:48] after this book is written blessed are
[37:50] them now of course you know they were
[37:51] blessed as well that died before this
[37:54] book was written but remember there's
[37:56] blessings just for hearing this book and
[37:58] for obeying this book right we looked at
[38:01] that last week so he's saying blessed
[38:03] are they which died that have heard this
[38:06] word and he says yeh saith the spirit
[38:08] that they may rest from their labors and
[38:11] their works do follow them all reminds
[38:14] me of that song I'll
[38:16] my way just a few more weird days and
[38:18] then right the Holy Spirit's telling
[38:20] John to tell them just keep laboring
[38:23] once you die you'll rest and then
[38:26] remember that your works will follow you
[38:30] praise God
[38:31] they're either gonna follow you for for
[38:35] a reward or they're gonna follow you for
[38:38] condemnation so may God help us to know
[38:41] that our works may God help us to do the
[38:44] right works that when our works follow
[38:46] us they'll testify that it was our faith
[38:49] that was the right kind of faith and
[38:52] remember there's three steps to works
[38:53] remember the first step is love because
[38:56] faith worketh by love so the first thing
[38:58] is to love God with all your heart soul
[39:00] mind and strength
[39:00] once you love God then you've got faith
[39:03] because faith works by love and then
[39:05] when you got faith faith goes to work
[39:08] because if there's no works after faith
[39:10] that faith is dead and it's really not a
[39:12] faith is that right James said faith
[39:15] without works is dead and he said you're
[39:18] justified by works and faith which we
[39:21] know that doesn't contradict with what
[39:22] Paul said because brother Branham says
[39:24] when Paul says were justified by faith
[39:27] alone what he means is that we're
[39:29] justified by the faith that God sees but
[39:32] James says when he says were not
[39:34] justified by faith alone but faith in
[39:36] works
[39:37] he says James is justifying us by what
[39:39] man sees a vet so God sees our faith but
[39:45] man see how it works
[39:46] and that's true even the days of Jesus
[39:49] remember when in Peters house remember
[39:52] when they brought that man and they
[39:53] brought him down through the roof Jesus
[39:55] the Bible says Jesus saw their faith and
[39:59] church have you prayed tonight when we
[40:01] brought these prayer requests if you
[40:03] came in faith and you brought this name
[40:05] up before the throne of God then Jesus
[40:08] saw your faith tonight as well amen
[40:10] because we don't have to bring somebody
[40:12] physically to Christ we can take them
[40:14] spiritually to Christ because we can
[40:17] take them by prayer by intercession and
[40:20] when we go to Christ and we feel what
[40:23] the sick persons feeling even though
[40:25] they're not here when we feel it the
[40:27] Bible says the high priest can be
[40:28] touched by the fee
[40:29] feeling of our infirmities amen so thank
[40:34] God that he can be touched and then what
[40:36] we must do is believe because the high
[40:38] priest loves to be touched by the
[40:40] feeling of our infirmities amen he ever
[40:42] lives to give intercession for us amen
[40:45] but he says I can only intercede based
[40:48] upon your profession amen
[40:50] so I want to say it again tonight god I
[40:54] believe God is gonna heal havens wrist
[40:57] they met I believe God's gonna
[40:59] strengthen brother Simon I believe God
[41:01] is gonna minister to that man that I was
[41:03] witnessing to that he'll come to church
[41:05] and take a book I'm just gonna believe
[41:07] that I believe God is going to save the
[41:09] souls of those friends of the girls and
[41:11] I believe if I confessed if I profess
[41:13] him believe it I believe God will do it
[41:15] I don't believe God's gonna strengthen
[41:17] our sister Connie minister to her
[41:18] tonight
[41:19] amen so see he can only minister as we
[41:23] profess his promise God is faithful I
[41:26] don't know when I don't know how but God
[41:29] is faithful amen liddie you can switch
[41:32] over here I got some slides here force
[41:35] now that's that verse there your works
[41:38] do follow them now since we're here
[41:41] revelation just flip over to chapter 20
[41:50] verse 13 now this is at the white throne
[41:55] judgment remember some people are gonna
[41:57] get saved at the white throne judgment I
[41:58] preached on that quite often to remind
[42:00] you and myself that even if people don't
[42:03] make a confession of Christ on this
[42:05] earth it's possible army it's possible
[42:10] on the day of judgment they'll be
[42:12] surprised and Jesus will actually ask
[42:14] them to go on the right side his right
[42:17] side rather with those that are as the
[42:21] Sheep right not the ghost but as a sheep
[42:23] and they'll say when did we do this and
[42:25] he said when you gave close to those
[42:27] naked Christians you did it unto me
[42:29] right Amen because it's a surprise now
[42:35] verse
[42:36] 20 chapter 20 verse 13 and the sea gave
[42:38] up the Dead which were in it and the
[42:40] death and he'll delivered up the Dead
[42:41] which were in them and they were judged
[42:43] every man according to their works to
[42:47] see your works follow you right like
[42:50] that saying goes whatever you do in life
[42:52] echoes in eternity that's nothing but
[42:54] the truth
[42:55] thank God we got the blood though to
[42:57] wipe out all of our sins before we go on
[42:59] that side thank God for that and those
[43:01] evil works will follow us because he's
[43:04] forgiven all of our trespasses which is
[43:07] why he sent his son as an offering for
[43:10] our sin so we even see books open and
[43:13] all the works are recorded right and
[43:16] your works follow you everything you do
[43:20] follows you praise God
[43:22] oh it's so important that we do the
[43:24] right works amen because now that God is
[43:28] not unjust to forget your labor of love
[43:31] praise God now I just want to just say a
[43:36] few things on that let me pull up that
[43:42] scripture I believe it's in first
[43:43] Corinthians so why don't you pull that
[43:44] up here the labor of love scripture now
[43:51] I'm sorry it's Hebrew 6:10 so forgive me
[43:54] here 6:10 I thought it was first
[43:56] Christians
[43:57] Hebrews 6:10 I think I mentioned this
[44:05] yeah Sunday night let's just go over
[44:07] this though November Hebrews 6:1 to 12
[44:10] is Paul basically showing how people can
[44:13] partake of heavenly gifts and spiritual
[44:16] powers and partake of the Word of God
[44:18] but yet they would be a thorn they would
[44:21] produce thorns or thistles right and
[44:24] that's what we know that's the doctrine
[44:25] called the anointed ones at the end
[44:27] times at the rain falls on the just and
[44:30] the unjust and look at verse 6 if they
[44:35] shall fall away to renew them again unto
[44:37] repentance seeing they crucify to
[44:39] themselves the Son of God afresh and put
[44:42] into an open shame when people publicly
[44:46] live contrary to the Word of God it's as
[44:50] if they're crucifying Christ in 2019
[44:55] because they put Christ to an open shame
[44:58] when a woman knows better about wearing
[45:00] sexy clothes but yet she wears it and
[45:02] she says I don't care what the Word of
[45:04] God says those churches that's just a
[45:06] fanatic Church
[45:07] she's crucifying Christ afresh right
[45:11] when a man knows better about cussing
[45:13] and committing adultery and drinking and
[45:15] bar hopping and he drug taken and yet he
[45:19] continues to do it
[45:20] he's crucifying Jesus Christ himself he
[45:24] might as well get out nails and and a
[45:26] hammer and and shout crucify him crucify
[45:28] him right because they're crucifying the
[45:32] holy spirit that's telling them the Word
[45:35] of God is right they might as well they
[45:39] might as well get out across and it
[45:40] might as well put up a a dummy of Jesus
[45:45] you know like a a physical body of Jesus
[45:48] and they might as well shout crucify
[45:50] Christ they might as well nail Bible to
[45:52] that cross because when you live
[45:54] contrary to what the Holy Spirit has led
[45:57] you to live it's open shame it's
[45:59] disgrace and it's a crucifixion for
[46:03] Christ
[46:03] but I say that we don't crucify Christ
[46:06] we crucify ourselves
[46:08] that's the crucifixion you and I have
[46:11] day after day week after week we take up
[46:13] our cross daily and follow him you and I
[46:16] are experienced a self crucifixion
[46:19] of our will but people that go to church
[46:23] and hear the word but reject it and
[46:25] won't live it they're actually
[46:27] crucifying the effects of the Holy
[46:29] Spirit to themselves today amen
[46:33] not how awful and they taste of heavenly
[46:36] gifts they see miracles they see
[46:38] knowledge they see wisdom they do all
[46:40] these things and they sing about
[46:42] miracles right and yet if they don't
[46:46] obey that spirit they're in danger of
[46:48] crucifying Christ today what do they
[46:53] produce in verse eight but that which
[46:55] bear thorns they produce a thorn instead
[46:58] of fruit of the Spirit they produce a
[47:00] thorn they produce death and briars is
[47:04] rejecting as nigh to cursing whose end
[47:06] is to be burnt but beloved then we just
[47:08] think about you call me beloved you call
[47:11] me friend beloved will persuade to
[47:13] better things of you and things that
[47:15] accompany salvation though thus we speak
[47:17] for God is not unrighteous to forget
[47:19] your work and labor of love what's the
[47:24] order again Church love faith works
[47:27] God's not going to forget your labor of
[47:29] love love us must motivate you coming to
[47:34] church tonight if it didn't it's time to
[47:37] get right with God love has to motivate
[47:40] it all your works are motivated by love
[47:42] which love faith work with my love and
[47:45] then faith produces works if it's alive
[47:48] it produces works and your works will
[47:50] follow you all the way either to the
[47:53] marriage supper of the lamb or the where
[47:55] you have the judgments of God give it
[47:57] out or your works will follow you to the
[47:59] great white throne judgment I want mine
[48:01] to follow me to the rewards before the
[48:04] throne of Christ at the marriage supper
[48:06] of the lamb in the head see God's not
[48:09] going to forget anything you do if you
[48:11] clean the church for Jesus if you give
[48:14] money to the poor Christians for Jesus
[48:18] if you pray for the sins of the your
[48:22] family and the church and and the city
[48:24] anything you do God will not forget your
[48:29] work in labor of love which you show
[48:31] toward his name
[48:32] in that you minister to the Saints and
[48:35] do Minister amen
[48:36] God will not forget that because
[48:39] whatever you do for God's people you do
[48:41] it for him ain't ahead honey yeah so
[48:44] when I preach to it I'm tired
[48:46] we'll have to sacrifice time for my
[48:47] family or or whatever whatever I
[48:50] sacrifice if I'm doing it for God in the
[48:52] Saints then God forget that he'll
[48:54] remember that hallelujah
[48:56] same thing for you whatever you do for
[48:59] God's people he won't forget it because
[49:01] your works follow you he'll he'll have
[49:04] those books open they'll say look at
[49:05] this they did it all these years all
[49:07] this faithful service enter the joys of
[49:09] the Lord prepared for you from the
[49:11] foundation of the world amen
[49:14] God doesn't forget those works and labor
[49:17] of love let's go to Ephesians 2:10 I
[49:22] just want to reiterate this again
[49:35] passages in the at least an evangelical
[49:37] circles Ephesians 2:8 for by grace are
[49:40] you saved through faith and that not of
[49:42] yourselves as a gift of God not of works
[49:44] lest any man should boast
[49:47] so we're not going to boast of our works
[49:49] we're not saved by our works but verse 8
[49:52] for we are his workmanship right created
[49:55] in Christ in Christ Jesus rather unto
[49:59] good works which God hath before
[50:01] ordained that we should walk in them so
[50:03] you're not saved by your works but your
[50:05] saves you can do a work for God hey not
[50:09] in there yeah you are his workmanship
[50:12] you are his masterpiece can I say like
[50:14] that amen a Christian a Holy Ghost field
[50:19] Christian is God's masterpiece for this
[50:22] world to see amen
[50:24] thank the Lord so see your works will
[50:29] follow you whatever works you new for
[50:31] Christ for his name for the Saints
[50:33] however you minister to God God's people
[50:36] here it will follow you and it's
[50:38] recorded and it'll be announced there at
[50:40] the judgment seat of Christ for we must
[50:43] all stand before the judgment seat of
[50:45] Christ amen now let's look at the next
[50:51] symbol here we these are the symbols BR
[50:54] did we already the lamp reported four
[50:55] thousand three angels announcements
[50:58] battle Armageddon we'll get there in
[51:00] just a moment we did the the father's
[51:05] name in the forehead and of course the
[51:06] Horus forehead for Babylon the three
[51:08] angels we ended with the commands of God
[51:11] in the faith of Christ and then today
[51:12] let's look at the harvest now so we got
[51:14] your Bibles remember let's go back to
[51:16] revelation 14 now look at
[51:25] and I looked and behold a white cloud
[51:27] and upon the cloud one sat like unto the
[51:31] Son of man having on his head a golden
[51:33] crown and in his hand a sharp sickle now
[51:38] look at him he's on a cloud right and
[51:42] isn't that how Jesus left in Matthew 28
[51:47] remember the angel said however he left
[51:50] he left on a cloud a cloud take him to
[51:52] heaven and Jesus said however he let
[51:55] hover I leave that's how I'm coming back
[51:57] amen
[51:58] so see he keeps his word he left on a
[52:02] cloud he's coming back on a cloud then
[52:04] he's got a sharp sickle for harvest and
[52:07] another angel came out of the temple
[52:09] crying with a loud voice to him that sat
[52:11] on the cloud thrust in thy sickle and
[52:13] reap for the time has come for thee to
[52:16] reap for the harvest of the earth is
[52:19] ripe now here's a quote on the harvest
[52:27] this is from the Laodicean Church age
[52:30] this is the age I'm sorry this age is
[52:34] the last of the seven church ages what
[52:36] began the first or Ephesian age must and
[52:38] will come to full fruition and harvest
[52:41] in this last or later seen age the two
[52:44] vines will yield their final fruit the
[52:47] two spirits will terminate their
[52:48] manifestation in each of their final
[52:50] destinations the so watering the growing
[52:54] is all over summer is ended the sickle
[52:58] is now thrust into the harvest amen so
[53:03] now we know when the harvest happens the
[53:05] harvest happens after the bride has
[53:08] expressed unproduced all of her fruit so
[53:12] when the bride gets to the spot that
[53:14] there's no more growing for the bride
[53:15] there's no more fruit for the bride
[53:17] that's when the harvest comes amen
[53:21] so the rapture is like a form of the
[53:23] harvest right because Jesus talked about
[53:25] that in Matthew 13 the angels have come
[53:27] and the harvest they'll take God's wheat
[53:29] to the garner which is the marriage
[53:31] supper of the lamb and the tailor's will
[53:34] be bound first and of course they'll be
[53:36] taken to the tribulation
[53:39] and eventually burn after the white
[53:41] throne judgment so we see the harvest is
[53:45] plain right here in the scripture look
[53:49] at verse 16 in Revelation 14 16 and he
[53:52] that sat on the cloud thrust in the
[53:54] sickle the earth and the earth was
[53:55] reaped and nones another angel came out
[53:58] of the temple which is in heaven he also
[54:00] having a sharp sickle
[54:01] and another angel came out from the
[54:04] altar which had power over fire and
[54:06] cried with a loud cry to him that had
[54:09] the sharp sickle saying thrust in thy
[54:12] sharp sickle and gather the clusters of
[54:13] the vine of the earth for her grapes are
[54:16] fully ripe and the angel thrust in his
[54:20] sickle and the to the earth and gathered
[54:22] the vine of the earth and cast it into
[54:24] the great winepress of the wrath of God
[54:28] and the winepress was trodden without
[54:34] the city and blood came out of the
[54:36] winepress even unto the horse bridles by
[54:39] the space of a thousand and six hundred
[54:42] furlongs
[54:44] that's quite a thought now let's get the
[54:50] why
[54:50] just for a moment here the winepress is
[54:53] the wrath of God and it's a symbol the
[54:56] winepress is a symbol of the slaying of
[54:59] the sinners who took the mark of the
[55:00] beast and worshipped His image the
[55:03] Battle of Armageddon because verse 20
[55:07] tells us where this is taking place it's
[55:12] taken without the city well we know what
[55:14] city they're talking about there's only
[55:16] one the city in the book of Revelation
[55:19] and that's Jerusalem amen
[55:22] Jerusalem is the city so this winepress
[55:25] is outside of the city not in the city
[55:28] it's without the city and it produces
[55:33] blood so this is a press now winepress
[55:36] was just a VAT and they would put the
[55:38] grapes in there and they would just have
[55:40] men or women that would you know they
[55:42] would gird up their loins and they would
[55:44] just smash right and then there was a
[55:46] little distilling a little dispenser and
[55:50] I that would come out the what the the
[55:52] blood of the grapes right and they would
[55:55] take that of course and that would
[55:56] become their wine well this is when
[56:00] Jesus comes back for Armageddon the
[56:04] Bible said here that the the wine is
[56:07] pressed and now wine I'm sorry grape
[56:12] juice doesn't flow out of here but blood
[56:14] flows out of here and it's so high then
[56:19] it goes up to a horse's bridle right
[56:21] horse's bridle so think of how tall the
[56:24] horses the children I don't know this is
[56:27] symbolic or this is physical but the
[56:31] Bible sentence for one thousand six
[56:33] hundred furlongs which represents about
[56:35] two hundred miles so this is a stream of
[56:39] blood that's two hundred miles long and
[56:42] as tall as a horse bridle that of the
[56:46] horse so this is some major major
[56:49] destruction now is it possible it is
[56:52] possible because the Bible said in
[56:54] Daniel 11 that all nations will gather
[56:56] against Israel they'll gather on Israel
[57:00] including the
[57:02] Christ and the armies and so it's
[57:04] possible or so that's a lot of blood
[57:05] that's a lot of destruction we don't
[57:09] like to think about that
[57:10] but when sinners fail to repent when
[57:15] sinners fail to accept the merciful
[57:18] loving nail-scarred hand of God that's
[57:21] constantly reaching out Jim for 2,000
[57:24] years this hands been reaching out to
[57:25] Gentiles 2,000 years God's been
[57:29] extending hand after hand
[57:31] God sent love know after love note to
[57:33] this town people saying receive it
[57:36] receive and each time they slapped away
[57:39] his hand can you imagine they slapped
[57:41] God face to say we don't want the gospel
[57:43] we don't need Jesus Christ
[57:45] we don't need that for 2,000 years and
[57:48] slowly that cup is filled up where God's
[57:50] patience is running out
[57:53] man for that final call once the Gospels
[57:56] reach every nation every nation slaps it
[57:58] away I don't want that don't give us
[58:00] that Holy Roller preaching don't tell us
[58:02] about that we've got our movies and
[58:04] we've got our sports we've got our money
[58:06] we've got our jobs we've got our
[58:07] civilization our culture we've got
[58:10] everything we need we don't need the
[58:11] gospel and finally God says that's
[58:15] enough take the sickle and harvest the
[58:17] earth and when that happens blood flows
[58:21] for two hundred miles because God was
[58:26] merciful this is not God's love this is
[58:29] God's wrath God's love was 2,000 years
[58:33] trying to get the Gentiles to accept
[58:36] pardoning grace for their sins that was
[58:39] God's love this is not God's love this
[58:42] is God's wrath
[58:44] this is not God's mercy this is God's
[58:47] judgment we
[58:54] after what waiting half an hour for
[58:56] something I sat in a car line today on
[58:59] the drive home for like two minutes I
[59:01] was garroted getting on patient like
[59:02] what I'm driving out you know cross it
[59:04] over the middle line do I need to turn
[59:06] around I need to get home I've got
[59:08] things I got church tonight and I get
[59:11] I'm getting upset with just one minute
[59:14] of waiting it and then pretty soon it
[59:15] clears up and like why did I get so
[59:17] upset you know but God waits 2000 years
[59:21] and then finally says that's fine if you
[59:24] don't want it that's the only thing left
[59:26] is judgment if you don't want mercy the
[59:28] only thing left is judgment now for God
[59:31] to be just to do that God would have to
[59:33] knock on their hearts door would he not
[59:35] God would have to do everything he'd
[59:37] have to send preachers he'd have to have
[59:39] an Internet to send preachers into their
[59:41] homes through their phones and their
[59:43] computers he's so merciful he'd send
[59:46] preachers by plane by boat by automobile
[59:49] anyway every nation had to hear the
[59:52] gospel and then when they refused God
[59:55] then God sends judgment how great is the
[1:00:00] mercy of God Church how great is his
[1:00:04] wrath though his judgment is fair this
[1:00:08] is fair this is not unjust this is fair
[1:00:11] God tried time after time mercy after
[1:00:15] mercy week and year after year month
[1:00:18] decade after decade till finally he ran
[1:00:22] out of patience
[1:00:29] keep your spot there go to Revelation 19
[1:00:33] you get a little more you get the idea
[1:00:37] of the winepress in Revelation 19 verse
[1:00:39] 15 now the word tread let's look at 19
[1:00:47] 15 and out of his mouth goes a sharp
[1:00:49] sword that with it he should smite the
[1:00:52] nation's and he shall rule them with a
[1:00:54] rod of iron he treadeth the winepress of
[1:00:55] the fierceness and the wrath of Almighty
[1:00:57] God go down to verse 17 and I saw an
[1:01:01] angel standing in the Sun and he cried
[1:01:02] with a loud voice saying to all the
[1:01:04] fowls that fly in the midst of heaven
[1:01:05] come and gather yourselves together unto
[1:01:07] the supper of the Great God and you may
[1:01:09] eat of the flesh of the kings and the
[1:01:11] flesh of captains in the flesh of mighty
[1:01:13] men and the flesh of horses and of them
[1:01:15] that sit on them and the flesh of all
[1:01:18] men both free and bond both small and
[1:01:20] great and who do you see there I saw the
[1:01:22] beast and the kings of the earth and
[1:01:23] their armies gathered together to make
[1:01:25] war against him that sound the horse and
[1:01:27] against his army so there it is this is
[1:01:31] how you have two hundred miles of blood
[1:01:34] because all the armies of the world they
[1:01:37] all gather to try to come against the
[1:01:38] Word of God see how to fight they are
[1:01:42] Church may God help us and never have an
[1:01:44] arrogant prideful spirit against God's
[1:01:46] Word may God help us not to have an
[1:01:49] arrogant spear against a preacher who's
[1:01:51] just trying to get us to repent because
[1:01:53] this is the end of pride this is the end
[1:01:56] of epic sword of God this is what it
[1:01:59] heads up this is spiritual death saying
[1:02:03] oh we're gonna try to fight against
[1:02:05] God's Word we're gonna try to fight
[1:02:06] against God's Son I don't like what the
[1:02:08] Word of God says so I'm gonna try to
[1:02:10] fight against it this is the this is the
[1:02:12] culmination of it the last or also the
[1:02:15] last battle before the or the the
[1:02:19] Millennium is Armageddon and they're
[1:02:22] coming imagine they got their tanks they
[1:02:25] got their their helicopters and all
[1:02:28] we're gonna beat we're going to defeat
[1:02:29] Jesus and there's so many of them so and
[1:02:33] they think they can do it and all of a
[1:02:35] sudden out of heaven comes a white horse
[1:02:37] rider amen I literally and he's got
[1:02:41] blood on his thigh
[1:02:43] and he doesn't need ammunition and tanks
[1:02:46] and all these things and fighter pilots
[1:02:48] he's one thing the word out of his mouth
[1:02:51] and with that he smacks him and it
[1:02:54] creates such a feast for the birds that
[1:02:56] he calls it the great feast two hundred
[1:02:59] miles of dead horse riders 200 miles of
[1:03:03] dead soldiers and he says come Birds
[1:03:06] swallow them up this is the great supper
[1:03:09] of the wrath of God in verse 15 the
[1:03:15] Bible said and he treadeth the winepress
[1:03:17] that means he stamps out the riot
[1:03:20] winepress of the fierce and wrath of
[1:03:23] Almighty God Jesus gets stamp out the
[1:03:30] wrath of God because he's already
[1:03:32] experienced the wrath of God Amen Jesus
[1:03:38] is just in stamping on those grapes
[1:03:41] because he was already stamped on can
[1:03:44] you say Amen
[1:03:46] program tells us this in the Patmos
[1:03:49] vision he breathes revelation 19:15 and
[1:03:52] then he says what did he do the wrath of
[1:03:54] God was upon us for being sinners is
[1:03:56] that right no one can save himself
[1:03:58] there's nothing we can do we're all born
[1:03:59] in sin shape iniquity come to the world
[1:04:01] speak of Lies and what'd he do he came
[1:04:03] to the earth hallelujah and tread the
[1:04:05] winepress all the wrath of Almighty God
[1:04:09] was poured out upon him now our worthy
[1:04:11] Oh Lamb of God for you were slain so
[1:04:16] Jesus can stop on the other wrath on the
[1:04:19] grapes of all these men he can smash
[1:04:22] them because he knows what it's like
[1:04:24] because God God's law smash-up him
[1:04:27] already
[1:04:28] amen law condemn him the sin of the
[1:04:34] world was placed upon him and he was
[1:04:37] smashed he was crushed he was bruised
[1:04:41] they meant he was chasing he was bruised
[1:04:44] for our iniquities but with His stripes
[1:04:46] we are healed
[1:04:49] taking the sins of the world upon him
[1:04:51] and he bore our sin that God poured out
[1:04:53] the fierceness of his wrath upon him
[1:04:54] he's wounded for our trance
[1:04:56] questions bruised for our iniquities the
[1:04:57] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:04:59] and with His stripes we were healed
[1:05:01] never a man die like that man
[1:05:04] he suffered until the blood in the water
[1:05:05] separated in his body right and the
[1:05:08] drops of blood dropped out of his brow
[1:05:10] before his death now a member who
[1:05:13] remembers what the word guess 70 means
[1:05:15] oil press that's what the word means
[1:05:18] Jesus prayed in the garden Gethsemane
[1:05:21] Jesus prayed in the oil press praise God
[1:05:25] Jesus his will had to be crushed there
[1:05:28] it got crushed it got stamp stopped on
[1:05:31] Jesus got stomped on until the Holy
[1:05:34] Spirit left him right after their right
[1:05:36] or I forget 70 his will had to get
[1:05:39] pressed through prayer not my will but
[1:05:42] not be done prayer was God's way to get
[1:05:45] his will to be crushed amen so church
[1:05:48] what makes you and I think any different
[1:05:50] that if we want our will to become God's
[1:05:53] will it's gonna have to be crushed in
[1:05:55] prayer is there a circuit certain secret
[1:06:00] where we can take an easier Road than
[1:06:01] Jesus and be called the bride of Jesus
[1:06:03] Christ or do we have to go through the
[1:06:06] same thing Christ went through the same
[1:06:08] thing we have to die in prayer if we're
[1:06:14] ever going to manifest all of God's will
[1:06:17] for our life for Jesus to finish the
[1:06:21] work amen
[1:06:22] for Jesus to finish the job that God
[1:06:24] sent him to knew he had to be crushed
[1:06:26] his will had to be crushed in prayer in
[1:06:29] the oil press and the oil that was the
[1:06:33] same thing at the winepress right they
[1:06:34] just put olives in this time and they
[1:06:37] just smashed it and they caught the oil
[1:06:38] that came out same thing and so Jesus
[1:06:41] had to get smashed his will and to be
[1:06:43] crushed by the by his love for God so
[1:06:46] that the Holy Spirit came out so that he
[1:06:49] can be cursed for our sins this is why
[1:06:54] Jesus can tread the winepress of the
[1:06:57] wrath of God because he knows what it's
[1:06:59] like
[1:07:06] someday those brass feet of justice
[1:07:08] glory when he comes as a judge I love
[1:07:12] this
[1:07:12] he'll tread the Antichrist glory and all
[1:07:17] of his enemies hallelujah
[1:07:18] he'll walk through the earth with a rod
[1:07:20] of iron in his hand amen
[1:07:22] oh repent Center friend while you got a
[1:07:24] chance to repent try put it off and
[1:07:26] think it's a little story that won't
[1:07:28] happen it will happen it just couldn't
[1:07:30] happen to me it will happen to you she's
[1:07:34] warning them this is going to happen now
[1:07:36] for those that die it won't happen at
[1:07:38] Armageddon but it'll happen at the great
[1:07:40] white throne of judgment where they'll
[1:07:43] be separate as goats and they'll be
[1:07:45] tossed alive into the fire that burned
[1:07:47] at the lake of fire imagine is being
[1:07:50] tossed a lot of fire in the fiery
[1:07:52] furnace it's going to happen to those
[1:07:56] who reject the Word of God
[1:07:58] I like what buh-bam says here feed a
[1:08:03] brass so Jesus had feet of brass tread
[1:08:06] down his enemies divine judgment because
[1:08:10] he suffered and tried out the winepress
[1:08:11] of the fierceness of God to pay for our
[1:08:13] sins and then we guilty poor miserable
[1:08:16] worms as we are stick our little nose up
[1:08:22] and read some kind of atheist book now
[1:08:24] he calls it a Theon ik I don't think
[1:08:26] that's a real word he said people read
[1:08:29] them atheism book and stick their nose
[1:08:31] up and try to think there's no God and
[1:08:34] say there's nothing like this and
[1:08:36] judgment can't come he'll take those
[1:08:38] brass feet and crush out his enemy he'll
[1:08:41] wade over the Antichrist he'll take
[1:08:44] those apostate churches and sling them
[1:08:46] into turning to think about that he'll
[1:08:48] take churches and sling them out in the
[1:08:51] lake of fire because they failed to
[1:08:55] accept his nail-scarred love his
[1:08:59] knocking open your hearts door and let
[1:09:02] me come in and clean out your closet
[1:09:04] make you wear the right clothes clean
[1:09:07] out your vocabulary make you say the
[1:09:09] right thing
[1:09:10] give me some wisdom to fear God and fear
[1:09:15] man right fear God and man
[1:09:18] they just turned it down time after time
[1:09:20] and they drive it with drugs and sexual
[1:09:23] sin and they draw on it well Jesus says
[1:09:26] you're worthy then of condemnation and
[1:09:27] he slings them into the lake of fire
[1:09:32] he'll crush out his enemy he'll wait
[1:09:35] over the Antichrist he said some they're
[1:09:37] gonna sling it there somewhere the
[1:09:38] consuming followers she'll be consumed
[1:09:40] and done away with and he will reign on
[1:09:42] the earth him and his church forever
[1:09:45] amen remember the Bible said God is not
[1:09:48] far from every one of us praise God
[1:09:52] so getting so get that the people you're
[1:09:55] supposed to witness to God is already
[1:09:57] close to them so when you walk up to
[1:09:59] them if you've got the Holy Ghost God
[1:10:01] gets a little closer to the head hey man
[1:10:03] I owe you God is trying to get to every
[1:10:08] person and he will praise God but God
[1:10:13] wants to send you and I sometimes a
[1:10:15] witness to people now let's look at this
[1:10:19] atheist thought I preached this a few
[1:10:21] years ago I'm just gonna hit a few
[1:10:22] scriptures just in review the Bible says
[1:10:32] this the Bible teaches plainly Psalms
[1:10:36] 14:1 The Fool has said in his heart
[1:10:38] there is no God they're corrupt they've
[1:10:42] done Obama works there's none that doeth
[1:10:44] good proverbs 28:26 he that trusts us in
[1:10:51] his own heart is a fool the Atheist will
[1:10:56] say oh there's no God you need to search
[1:10:58] out the truth and know what you believe
[1:11:00] for yourself the Bible said you're just
[1:11:02] as foolish if you say well I'll just
[1:11:04] trust in your own heart nonsense
[1:11:08] remember this proverbs 18 - I love this
[1:11:11] because it's so true about today a fool
[1:11:13] hath no two understanding they don't
[1:11:15] want to try to understand God but that
[1:11:18] is heart may discover itself they walk
[1:11:21] around and say go to college and you'll
[1:11:23] discover yourself just stay away from
[1:11:25] God you're gonna discover that you're
[1:11:27] nothing but a worm
[1:11:28] that deserves to be slung into hell for
[1:11:31] all your rebellion in a and wickedness
[1:11:33] and sin in adultery oh but gods knocking
[1:11:36] on their heart thank God for those
[1:11:37] campus preachers that are out there
[1:11:40] trying to get them you can't discover
[1:11:42] yourself in your heart because your
[1:11:43] hearts to sip deceitfully wicked above
[1:11:46] all things but you can discover yourself
[1:11:48] in the word of Jesus Christ that's right
[1:11:53] let me review some of these here
[1:11:56] remember there's a man named Anthony
[1:11:58] flue I think he passed away but in 2004
[1:12:01] he converted from an atheist to
[1:12:04] Christian by studying DNA he was one of
[1:12:08] the most outspoken atheists but once he
[1:12:11] started studying DNA he realized DNA is
[1:12:13] nothing but a book of instructions and
[1:12:16] if you study DNA long enough you're
[1:12:19] started learning the alphabet of DNA and
[1:12:23] just studying God's creation makes you
[1:12:27] realize there's a creator every living
[1:12:30] thing has DNA and DNA is the instruction
[1:12:35] manual for how to build brown eyes how
[1:12:40] to build brown hair how to build pink
[1:12:44] lips or shaggy beard it's all written in
[1:12:50] your DNA and that's contained in
[1:12:52] yourselves so scientists study deeper
[1:12:56] all they find is more and more
[1:12:58] intelligence amen
[1:12:59] it's God's hand it's God's fingerprint
[1:13:02] the more they study science the more
[1:13:05] they discover God Almighty there's that
[1:13:11] evangelist named Ray Comfort now he
[1:13:13] don't know the message but he went
[1:13:15] around asking the smartest doctorates on
[1:13:19] the UCLA campus he said can you give me
[1:13:22] one observable evidence for evolution
[1:13:23] and they could not give one the smartest
[1:13:28] man in all of the nation the world
[1:13:30] couldn't give you one evidence for
[1:13:33] evolution what they do is they try and
[1:13:35] prevent says they try to give you some
[1:13:37] atheon ik book like the
[1:13:41] winds or Origin of Species right which I
[1:13:45] don't know how they like him because he
[1:13:46] exalted he exalted white people over
[1:13:50] black people and said the black people
[1:13:53] need to die right there in his book and
[1:13:55] there they're not even real people he
[1:13:57] said how in the world could people be
[1:14:00] behind Darwinism it's foolish it's from
[1:14:04] the pits of hell but yet though they'd
[1:14:07] rather take that than God's holy word
[1:14:09] they deserve destruction to say things
[1:14:12] like that hey man the Bible said while
[1:14:16] all nations are one Baradei men and so
[1:14:21] they cannot give any examples of that oh
[1:14:25] it's so so evil I had a few other things
[1:14:32] on that now the Bible says that God has
[1:14:39] to reveal themselves to every person
[1:14:40] we've gone over too few times in
[1:14:42] revelation chapter I'm sorry Romans
[1:14:43] chapter 1 the Bible said the invisible
[1:14:46] things of the world are seen through the
[1:14:49] things that are created amen
[1:14:51] so you want to say well where's God go
[1:14:53] look at the tree you'll find God where's
[1:14:56] God go look at the sky you'll see God go
[1:15:01] look at the universe you realize they're
[1:15:03] discovering now that the universe is so
[1:15:06] so much greater than they even thought
[1:15:08] it was they think there's article this
[1:15:10] week about how it's expanding even more
[1:15:12] than they thought it's larger than they
[1:15:13] thought and it keeps stretching I just
[1:15:17] read that this morning in Psalm 43 God
[1:15:19] said I am THE LORD thy God that
[1:15:21] stretches out the heavens
[1:15:22] he's just stretching it out so if he's
[1:15:25] stretching it out that means it used to
[1:15:27] be back in one little small little piece
[1:15:30] which was in his mind hey do you know
[1:15:34] that did you know all the you know all
[1:15:36] the science points to the Big Bang but
[1:15:38] that Big Bang was let there be that was
[1:15:42] the big all science says it came out of
[1:15:45] one big explosion Dazs explosion of His
[1:15:48] Holy Word amen and so
[1:15:54] that evangelist goes out there and he
[1:15:55] just holds up any book and he says he
[1:15:59] says do you believe the scientific
[1:16:01] impossibility that nothing created
[1:16:03] everything because an atheist says
[1:16:05] there's no divine creator so an atheist
[1:16:08] really believes wherever said there'll
[1:16:09] be a theist and atheist believes that
[1:16:13] nothing created everything that's what
[1:16:16] they believe that they're so foolish
[1:16:19] they believe nothing created everything
[1:16:21] and when you really go to them into a
[1:16:23] corner like Richard Dawkins and some of
[1:16:25] these famous atheists what they actually
[1:16:27] believe is that some living thing from
[1:16:30] another dimension mention and created
[1:16:33] something and that's exactly what God
[1:16:35] did amen he came out of a dimension that
[1:16:39] had no time and he came into a different
[1:16:43] dimension he created and made time
[1:16:45] matter and space amen see they believe
[1:16:49] an alien came and brought life in this
[1:16:51] dimension but that's really what
[1:16:53] happened God and alien right from
[1:16:55] another dimension came and created as
[1:16:57] dimension and that's why we have life
[1:16:59] today that's right and now I like what
[1:17:04] the manager says he said so you believe
[1:17:06] that this book could just have created
[1:17:09] itself that all of a sudden something
[1:17:12] started raining down and you know black
[1:17:15] ink started raining down from the sky
[1:17:16] and you believe this book and all the
[1:17:18] Aces say no that niklas that could never
[1:17:21] happen that by a chance all these are
[1:17:24] black you know and then colors would
[1:17:26] fall and all these beautiful pictures
[1:17:28] you really think this book could create
[1:17:30] itself and everything could fall in just
[1:17:33] create beautiful maps like this and the
[1:17:35] church ages and all the atheist say no
[1:17:37] and he says I'll give you perfect
[1:17:40] evidence of creation he said because
[1:17:43] inside of your every cell of yours is
[1:17:45] DNA and it's more detailed than the book
[1:17:48] we read right here amen and so if you
[1:17:53] don't if if you're foolish to believe a
[1:17:56] book or create itself
[1:17:58] then you're a complete fool but we know
[1:18:01] a book can't create itself we know a
[1:18:04] book needs a writer and all the
[1:18:07] DNA and your body needed a writer and
[1:18:10] that writer was not almighty if our DNA
[1:18:13] is an instruction book that somebody had
[1:18:15] to be the creator of that instruction
[1:18:17] book amen I like that now I didn't do
[1:18:21] that justice but I had that thought
[1:18:25] today and I was I was going through
[1:18:26] these quotes about brother Branham said
[1:18:27] there'll be a theists the Sun is 93
[1:18:33] million miles away from the earth the
[1:18:35] Earth rotates at a hundred thousand
[1:18:38] miles per hour on its axis the Earth
[1:18:42] rotates on the Sun at 63,000 miles per
[1:18:45] hour and the Sun cents raised at just
[1:18:50] the right time so it can get here just
[1:18:52] in perfect time to ripen your tomatoes
[1:18:55] and your green peppers right on time and
[1:18:58] there's a scientist scientific principle
[1:19:00] I forgot what it was I forgot the name
[1:19:02] of it starts with a a but if if the
[1:19:04] earth was moved just one degree it was
[1:19:08] the repeting off the would throw
[1:19:10] everything off
[1:19:11] there'd be no life there'd be no nothing
[1:19:13] and if Earth was moved just one a
[1:19:16] millionth of an inch or something it
[1:19:18] would throw everything off in other
[1:19:20] words
[1:19:20] whoever created this universe they place
[1:19:23] it perfectly they created it perfectly
[1:19:25] it was designed to produce life God knew
[1:19:28] what he was doing when he placed us here
[1:19:30] a medic in other words evidence we can't
[1:19:36] say the evidence proves God but we say
[1:19:38] evidence points to God and it leaves no
[1:19:41] other choice either this world wears
[1:19:43] created itself or a creator created this
[1:19:46] universe and so only a fool would say
[1:19:49] well I think it created itself only in
[1:19:52] person reading a atheon ik would say
[1:19:55] well the universe created itself nothing
[1:19:58] created everything but we know God
[1:20:00] created everything amen
[1:20:03] I just thought I'd throw that in there
[1:20:04] praise the Lord now there's a whole
[1:20:11] I could go through there I didn't have
[1:20:12] time to get everything I liked in there
[1:20:14] and I kind of chopped it up but I want
[1:20:17] you to know Church that we have more
[1:20:18] evidence for God existence than we've
[1:20:20] ever had and if you want to find it you
[1:20:22] just got to dig a little bit and I've
[1:20:24] got some good books if you'd like to
[1:20:25] study on that amen now let's move on
[1:20:29] here so Jesus already tread the
[1:20:32] winepress himself but it was an oil
[1:20:34] press and that was good Angus and now to
[1:20:38] stamp out or tread God's wine press for
[1:20:41] all those who take the mark of the beast
[1:20:43] and so yeah I just went over the atheist
[1:20:46] allusion that's kind of some of the
[1:20:47] highlights of the atheist delusion video
[1:20:49] it's a great video now the timing so
[1:20:54] here's the timing here's the timing of
[1:20:58] the events of chapter 14 the three
[1:21:00] angels message go forth first right
[1:21:02] before the tribulation the lamb in the
[1:21:05] 144,000 meat during the tribulation and
[1:21:09] then armed again comes at the end of the
[1:21:11] tribulation all right so that's the
[1:21:14] timing of this chapter so if you were if
[1:21:16] you were to able to take all the verses
[1:21:17] apart and line them up you'd actually
[1:21:19] start with the three angels message then
[1:21:21] you go to the lamb 144,000 and then you
[1:21:24] go to Armageddon all right now let's go
[1:21:28] to Revelation chapter 15 here also
[1:21:35] thanks
[1:21:36] be a Christian and to be forgiven by the
[1:21:38] blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:21:41] revelation 15 now I'm just gonna go
[1:21:49] scripture by scripture the themes of
[1:21:51] this book are the seven last plagues the
[1:21:55] victors over the beasts and the seven
[1:21:57] golden vials as these are the themes of
[1:22:00] the book now verse one introduces the
[1:22:02] seven angels so verse 115 1 and I saw
[1:22:06] another sign in heaven great and
[1:22:08] marvellous seven angels having the seven
[1:22:10] last plagues for in them is filled up
[1:22:12] the wrath of God that's verse 1 now
[1:22:17] verses 2 through 4 is the group of
[1:22:20] victors who got the victory over the
[1:22:23] beast standing on the sea of glass in
[1:22:25] heaven who sing the song of Moses they
[1:22:31] sing the song of Moses and the lamb
[1:22:35] Jesus Christ this group seems to be not
[1:22:38] believed this is the 144,000 Israeli
[1:22:42] believers who will receive Jesus Christ
[1:22:44] as their Messiah during the Tribulation
[1:22:46] Period and there's two reasons I believe
[1:22:50] that this is what I remembered last week
[1:22:51] I was looking for the harps it was right
[1:22:53] here the whole time I just didn't see it
[1:22:55] I think to read two things prove this is
[1:22:59] 144,000 first is harps second is the
[1:23:03] song of Moses so let's look at these
[1:23:06] here verse 2 and I saw I was aware of
[1:23:10] the sea of glass mingled with fire and
[1:23:11] then they've gotten victory over the
[1:23:14] beasts and over his image and the mark
[1:23:16] over his mark and over the number of his
[1:23:17] name stand on the sea of glass having
[1:23:20] the harps of God now it just came to me
[1:23:22] I just realized brother Branham said
[1:23:24] it's mingled with fire and brother have
[1:23:26] said that fire represents the fire of
[1:23:28] the tribulation so this proves this
[1:23:31] group came out of the Tribulation Period
[1:23:33] they're singing the song of Moses and
[1:23:35] they got harps so I believe this is the
[1:23:39] hundred forty-four thousand verse three
[1:23:41] and they sing the song of Moses the
[1:23:43] servant of God and the song of the lamb
[1:23:45] saying great marvelous are thy works
[1:23:47] Lord God Almighty just and true of our
[1:23:49] ways
[1:23:50] king of saints and brother Jose taught
[1:23:52] him to about singing to the king tonight
[1:23:54] so they're singing to the king of saints
[1:23:58] Jesus Christ who shall not fear thee O
[1:24:01] Lord and glorify that name for thou art
[1:24:03] O only art holy for all nations shall
[1:24:07] come and worship before thee for thy
[1:24:09] judgments are made manifest so let's
[1:24:13] stop right there
[1:24:14] now notice they got harps so those harps
[1:24:22] are also listed in Revelation 14 so this
[1:24:25] is 15 Revelation 15 speaks of harps and
[1:24:27] in Revelation 14 they have harps as well
[1:24:31] that's right now verse so I'm going back
[1:24:33] to Revelation 14 - if you want to follow
[1:24:35] along with me
[1:24:35] so you wrote man said you gotta look at
[1:24:38] every scripture and then tie it to
[1:24:39] another so the harps in Revelation 15
[1:24:42] connect to the harps in Revelation 14
[1:24:44] verse 1 says the 144,000 and verse 2
[1:24:47] says and I heard a voice from heaven as
[1:24:49] the voice of many waters and as the
[1:24:50] voice of great Thunder and heard the
[1:24:52] voice of harpers harping with their
[1:24:53] harps can everybody see that so you have
[1:24:56] harps in Revelation 15 and harps in
[1:24:59] Revelation 14 with the 144,000 so I
[1:25:02] believe this is that 144,000 they're all
[1:25:05] Mount Zion but now they're up in heaven
[1:25:07] amen hallelujah and they still got harps
[1:25:10] praise God they got heart thank the Lord
[1:25:14] these worshipers of the Lamb
[1:25:17] now second they got the song of Moses
[1:25:24] now chapter 5
[1:25:26] team they got the song of Moses now
[1:25:28] concerning the song of Moses the City of
[1:25:31] Jerusalem is the home of the remnant
[1:25:34] smoking up in revelation 11 13 in
[1:25:37] Revelation 12:17
[1:25:38] a believing Jews it's the Jews that
[1:25:41] receive the two witnesses one of which
[1:25:44] is Moses according to revelation 11 6 so
[1:25:50] we got your Bibles let's read in
[1:25:51] revelation 11 6 if you got your Bibles
[1:25:52] these 100 please this group is singing
[1:25:56] the song of Moses well Moses was
[1:26:00] mentioned with a ministry to the Jews in
[1:26:02] revelation 11 6 and these have power to
[1:26:06] shut heaven that it rain not in the days
[1:26:07] of their prophecy and have power over
[1:26:11] waters to turn them to blood and to
[1:26:12] smite the earth with all plagues as
[1:26:15] often as they will all right everybody
[1:26:18] that's the Ministry of Moses hope you
[1:26:21] can it's Moses and Elijah so here this
[1:26:25] group in Revelation 15 they're up in
[1:26:27] heaven they got harps harping and
[1:26:29] they've got the song of Moses it's got
[1:26:32] to be the 144,000 amen
[1:26:35] we never see believers singing the song
[1:26:38] of Moses in the book of Revelation we
[1:26:41] never see that we see Moses connected to
[1:26:43] the Jews okay hope that makes sense by
[1:26:47] God's grace now
[1:26:50] the chapter concludes with verses 5
[1:26:53] through 8 let's read those and we'll go
[1:26:55] a little bit further here by the grace
[1:26:56] of Lord revelation 15 5 and after that I
[1:27:03] looked at me hold the temple the
[1:27:04] tabernacle the testimony in heaven was
[1:27:06] open my imagine that heaven gets opened
[1:27:10] right now we can't see into there but
[1:27:13] brother one day that's gonna open and
[1:27:15] they're gonna see directly into heaven
[1:27:18] man talk about dimensions opening see
[1:27:21] where all these guys get their ideas
[1:27:22] it's already written right here in their
[1:27:24] Baja all these fiction riders you know
[1:27:25] changing dimensions and opening doors to
[1:27:27] heaven what they get it they get it from
[1:27:29] God's Word amen the copied it I wonder
[1:27:33] if they cited it if not they're
[1:27:34] plagiarizing verse
[1:27:38] verse six and the seven angels came out
[1:27:40] of the temple having the seven plagues
[1:27:41] clothed and pure and light linen and
[1:27:44] having their breasts girded with golden
[1:27:46] girdles and one of the four beasts gave
[1:27:50] unto the seven angels now look at that
[1:27:51] one of the four beasts I wonder which
[1:27:53] beast it was I think it was the Eagle
[1:27:55] beast one of the four beasts the lion ox
[1:27:59] man or ego I wonder which beast it was
[1:28:01] which beast gives the vials seven golden
[1:28:06] vials full of the wrath of God who
[1:28:08] liveth for ever and ever
[1:28:12] verse eight and the temple was filled
[1:28:15] with smoke from the glory of God and
[1:28:18] from his power and no man was able to
[1:28:20] enter into the temple to the seven
[1:28:22] plagues of the seven angels were
[1:28:24] fulfilled Wow God smoke and God's
[1:28:28] presence was so great no man could go in
[1:28:30] there into the heavenly realms there
[1:28:32] until all these were poured out not what
[1:28:37] a thought so the timing seems to be
[1:28:43] really simple in this chapter the timing
[1:28:45] seems to be you have your victors in
[1:28:47] heaven worshiping God with the harps and
[1:28:51] while that's going on you have
[1:28:53] Armageddon pouring out upon the earth
[1:28:56] there in verses 1 to 4 I'm sorry verses
[1:29:00] 5 to 8 5 to 8 would be Armageddon with
[1:29:04] the seven last plagues alright is that
[1:29:11] helpful bye
[1:29:11] great now we're through chapter 14 now
[1:29:14] we're to chapter 15 I'll just get
[1:29:16] started on 16 the Lord willing we'll do
[1:29:18] 16 next Wednesday at the Lord tarries
[1:29:23] now if you've never seen this that let's
[1:29:25] look at revelation 16 there's two main
[1:29:28] themes there are seven vials poured out
[1:29:31] Revelation 16 and there's also a
[1:29:35] blessing pronounced by Christ there's
[1:29:37] two main themes in Revelation 16 now I
[1:29:44] want you to see here's a good example
[1:29:45] Church of how brother Branham grew in
[1:29:47] his understanding how many of you want
[1:29:49] to grow in your understanding
[1:29:51] look what program says now look I
[1:29:53] highlighted it just everybody can catch
[1:29:54] it 1954 remember he's already preached a
[1:29:58] year and a half it must've been before
[1:29:59] 47 when they started recording the
[1:30:01] sermons he already preached a year and a
[1:30:02] half straight on the book of Revelation
[1:30:04] but brother Graham tells us here now he
[1:30:07] changed this later but he says he's
[1:30:09] going to preach on the seven church ages
[1:30:10] now the book of Revelation how it's made
[1:30:13] up daniel ties in with it
[1:30:15] isaiah ties in with it all the old
[1:30:17] testament ties in with it and it's the
[1:30:19] book of revelation of jesus christ see
[1:30:21] the book of the revelation of jesus
[1:30:22] christ and then in there there's the
[1:30:24] seven churches the seven plagues of
[1:30:25] seven seals seven trumpets now trumpet
[1:30:27] represents war a mystery unfolding a
[1:30:30] plague is what follows every war now
[1:30:37] here's what he changed later on brother
[1:30:42] Branham says we're living at the seventh
[1:30:44] trumpet other words Meldrum saying six
[1:30:46] trumpets have already passed he says
[1:30:50] we're living in the seventh plague with
[1:30:52] RAM saying six plagues have already
[1:30:53] taken place and the seventh seal to be
[1:30:56] opened and the seventh vow to be poured
[1:30:58] out so 1954 brother Branham believed and
[1:31:02] he changes later but he believed the
[1:31:06] seventh are the six trumpets the six
[1:31:09] plagues and the six vials were already
[1:31:11] poured out upon the earth and that were
[1:31:14] just waiting for the seventh church hey
[1:31:18] brother Branham King bro then you and I
[1:31:20] should be able to grow as well yeah but
[1:31:23] see this is why I love right here by God
[1:31:25] help brother ran was so humble he says I
[1:31:31] he sees seasons I think I can I can
[1:31:33] prove that we're living in the seventh
[1:31:34] trumpet this so he believed in 1954 that
[1:31:40] six trumpets have already been poured
[1:31:42] out but later we know brother Ram said
[1:31:45] all the trumpet sound under what seal
[1:31:47] six seal and the sixth seal doesn't come
[1:31:51] until after the rapture of the church
[1:31:55] aren't you glad brother Ram could grow
[1:31:57] in his understanding and if brother Ram
[1:32:01] and how did he grow church
[1:32:02] how'd he grow he humbled himself and he
[1:32:06] prayed those eight days in a row and
[1:32:09] that when he when he had the questioned
[1:32:11] by the air he just waited on the Lord
[1:32:12] and the Holy Spirit brought the answer
[1:32:15] each morning each seal before he
[1:32:18] preached it he said would have made an
[1:32:19] awful mistake we mentioned that last
[1:32:21] week until the Holy Spirit came in the
[1:32:23] room about noon amen all right before
[1:32:27] the Sun rose the Holy Spirit came to
[1:32:29] meet me or the angel came and the ball
[1:32:31] of fire had he said hanging there and my
[1:32:33] flesh got numb and he showed me the seal
[1:32:37] in a vision and I spent the rest of the
[1:32:39] day tracing it out through the
[1:32:41] concordance to make sure lined up with
[1:32:43] the Word of God does he at one point he
[1:32:49] believed all these things that he later
[1:32:51] taught were for the Israel he believed
[1:32:53] they'd already happened but by God's
[1:32:56] help he got straightened out hey yeah if
[1:33:01] we can only be that humble Church and
[1:33:04] God help us to do that
[1:33:05] I believe God will but you know and I
[1:33:07] know churches that are so rigid they
[1:33:09] will only take what they believe you try
[1:33:12] to show them accord outside of that they
[1:33:14] won't take God's help right because
[1:33:17] there they won't take any help because
[1:33:19] they feel like they're so arrogant and
[1:33:21] smart and proud they know all about it
[1:33:25] that was in
[1:33:26] in 54 he said all the plagues have
[1:33:30] already passed the vowels have already
[1:33:31] passed all these things have already
[1:33:33] passed and we're just waiting for the
[1:33:36] seventh of all of them in 1961 mother
[1:33:40] may have said he said Daniel seventy
[1:33:42] weeks has nothing to do with the
[1:33:44] Gentiles these seven seals seven plague
[1:33:48] seven woes seven Trump says has not one
[1:33:50] thing to do the Gentile church will be
[1:33:52] in glory at that time don't have nothing
[1:33:56] to do with it the Gentile Church it only
[1:33:58] deals with Israel Daniel thy people
[1:34:00] Israel so seven years later he's already
[1:34:04] got an understanding all these things
[1:34:06] deal with the Jews the Gentiles don't
[1:34:11] suffer that I hope we get got to Airy
[1:34:16] seven years I hope we can look back and
[1:34:18] say oh by God's help he straightened me
[1:34:20] out on this by God's help I was able to
[1:34:25] learn something and not think I knew it
[1:34:27] all remember on Sunday we preached on
[1:34:28] that that know-it-all demon the demon
[1:34:33] that knows all about it
[1:34:34] can't teach them nothing don't need to
[1:34:36] seek God anymore cuz they got to all
[1:34:38] figure it out we don't want to be a
[1:34:40] self-righteous to Ziya do we well God's
[1:34:44] blessed me all these years
[1:34:45] I can I can go to the priests it even
[1:34:47] though I'm not called by the word I can
[1:34:50] go into that
[1:34:50] that's okay God will still forgive me
[1:34:52] God will still love me well he may
[1:34:54] forgive you but you're gonna suffer for
[1:34:55] your arrogance and so I thought it was
[1:35:01] important in closing to show this how if
[1:35:04] brother Branham could humble himself and
[1:35:05] how'd he do it through prayer seeking
[1:35:09] God studying the word saying God show
[1:35:11] this show this to me line this up Lord
[1:35:13] how do these seals work out how does it
[1:35:16] scripture work out I need to remember he
[1:35:19] said the seals were greater than any
[1:35:21] ministry he'd ever had before that that
[1:35:27] was just seven years later now in 1964
[1:35:32] he said I went into prayer I told the
[1:35:34] wife I'm going in because remember he
[1:35:35] wondered how come the Lord won't let why
[1:35:37] can't we get a school or ten to preach
[1:35:39] these seven trumpets
[1:35:40] and sincerely I knelt down that's the
[1:35:42] key right there
[1:35:43] sincerely kneel down and pray before God
[1:35:48] to pray and he revealed to me that them
[1:35:50] seven trumpets sounded under the sixth
[1:35:52] seal and I've done preachers
[1:35:54] supernaturally see it's the hand of God
[1:35:56] the whole thing it pertains to Israel
[1:35:59] and we picked it up under the sixth seal
[1:36:01] and you all who have that how the
[1:36:04] persecution of the Jews the time of the
[1:36:06] Gentiles has been this Pentecostal feast
[1:36:09] amen
[1:36:13] now I'm going to close with this I stand
[1:36:15] to our feet brother bran brings out this
[1:36:17] thought the seven valves are very
[1:36:20] similar to the ten plagues of Egypt so
[1:36:23] Lord willing we'll take our time and
[1:36:24] we'll go through this next Wednesday
[1:36:26] night or maybe Sunday Lord willing we'll
[1:36:28] see maybe quite a Mother's Day sermon
[1:36:30] wouldn't it the vows and the and the
[1:36:32] plagues for Mother's Day just trying to
[1:36:35] encourage your mothers keep your
[1:36:37] children out of the vials you know how
[1:36:39] do the tribulation that might be
[1:36:41] something good encouragement but I'll
[1:36:43] try not to do that by God's grace but
[1:36:48] member ban tells them in the seven
[1:36:50] trumpets why are these so similar why
[1:36:53] are the seven vials and the ten plagues
[1:36:57] of Egypt so similar
[1:36:58] he said because in both cases God is
[1:37:01] calling Israel out of Egypt amen
[1:37:05] why do those trumpets have to blow why
[1:37:07] do the vowels have to blow why does all
[1:37:09] this destruction have to happen because
[1:37:11] God is calling his people out of their
[1:37:13] blindness to meet Jesus at Mount Zion
[1:37:16] amen
[1:37:17] just like he called Moses in Israel out
[1:37:21] of Egypt to meet them on Mount Sinai
[1:37:23] hahaha
[1:37:26] just like he called him out to meet him
[1:37:28] about Messiah and there I'm sorry
[1:37:32] not Mount Zion yeah it is Mount Zion so
[1:37:36] is he gonna call him out and meet him
[1:37:37] out on the Mount Zion again amen
[1:37:39] thank the Lord Oh sir Sinai that's right
[1:37:43] Sinai Sinai and Zion I keep mixing up
[1:37:46] forgive me he called him out to meet him
[1:37:49] on Sinai under Moses and he calls him
[1:37:51] out to meet Christ on Mount Zion
[1:37:54] forgive me so the first flag turned
[1:37:57] water to blood the second and third vial
[1:37:59] does that the second one frogs I can't
[1:38:03] find frogs in the in the vials
[1:38:05] the third ones lice which could not be
[1:38:08] imitated by Janice and Jambres they can
[1:38:11] only follow to the first two steps they
[1:38:13] couldn't follow that third one
[1:38:15] his third is life the third step the
[1:38:19] work of grace the fourth the storm of
[1:38:21] flies the fifth all the cattle died the
[1:38:24] six they have boils on their flesh in
[1:38:26] the sixth plague and that's like the
[1:38:28] first vial grievious sores the seventh
[1:38:33] vial is thunder hail and fire because
[1:38:35] it's just like the seventh vial had hail
[1:38:39] the eighth plague had locusts there's
[1:38:42] nothing to mention of that the ninth
[1:38:43] plague had darkness over Egypt and
[1:38:46] that's like the fifth vial has darkness
[1:38:48] over the world and the 10th the tenth
[1:38:52] vial I'm sorry the 10th plague doesn't
[1:38:56] have a connection because that's the
[1:38:57] death of the firstborn but I imagine
[1:38:59] that spiritual death I'd imagine and
[1:39:01] then destruction in the Battle of
[1:39:03] Armageddon praise the Lord all right so
[1:39:08] next time we'll go over more on the mark
[1:39:09] of the beast and then which of the
[1:39:10] beasts you love the Lord tonight praise
[1:39:13] God I hope that was a blessing Malik I
[1:39:14] want you come up here well we're working
[1:39:18] our way Church is it a blessing to hear
[1:39:21] the word of God tonight amen
[1:39:24] you know church many times these are
[1:39:26] like warnings and I just thought I would
[1:39:28] close on that thought about brother
[1:39:29] Branham being humble enough by the grace
[1:39:32] of God to grow and I do believe as I
[1:39:37] preach out on Sunday morning I do
[1:39:39] believe that's one of the greatest
[1:39:40] hindrances of the Antichrist fear today
[1:39:42] is to get people to stop wanting to grow
[1:39:46] in the grace of God we think oh well we
[1:39:52] got to be a denomination to be the
[1:39:55] Antichrist spirit know we can sit right
[1:39:57] in here and as soon as we say I'm not
[1:39:59] hungry for any more word you're starting
[1:40:01] to denominate
[1:40:03] you're starting to organize when you're
[1:40:06] starting to take church lightly and not
[1:40:08] come expecting God to move or we don't
[1:40:10] come hungry for the things of God we
[1:40:12] don't come to cloud to say God we need
[1:40:13] more as soon as that starts happening we
[1:40:16] start dying we start losing our first
[1:40:19] love and there's only one way to get it
[1:40:21] back
[1:40:22] repentance but there's memory saw on
[1:40:27] Sunday there's just a short little time
[1:40:29] period remember the jubilee they just
[1:40:31] had one year to redeem that back if they
[1:40:33] did it it's forever state in
[1:40:35] denomination
[1:40:38] how many friends do we know that have
[1:40:40] denominated in their understanding the
[1:40:42] message and they'll never grow any more
[1:40:44] they'll never gain a greater
[1:40:45] understanding they're never humble
[1:40:47] themselves and grow closer to Christ oh
[1:40:50] I don't need it I know everything about
[1:40:52] it I know all about God and I I know the
[1:40:56] message I can quote it just faster than
[1:40:57] the preacher that's not what we want
[1:41:01] Church we want our works to follow us we
[1:41:09] want the works of righteousness to
[1:41:10] follow us let's bow our heads for a
[1:41:14] moment the Bible said in Hebrews 6 10 I
[1:41:22] will not forget your work and labor of
[1:41:25] love with your head bowed what work of
[1:41:30] love have you show toward his name this
[1:41:32] week amen in that you have ministered to
[1:41:37] the Saints how have you ministered to
[1:41:39] the Saints this week this month
[1:41:44] what work of love are you working for
[1:41:47] God's people it don't have to be our
[1:41:50] church it could be you're trying to
[1:41:52] encourage others from another church but
[1:41:56] church let's think about that for a
[1:41:57] moment when you're so in love with price
[1:42:02] you would have to be loved as people
[1:42:06] because as people are part of it love it
[1:42:12] all goes back to that first enough
[1:42:14] let's pray tonight and let's ask the
[1:42:16] Lord if we're not in our first love to
