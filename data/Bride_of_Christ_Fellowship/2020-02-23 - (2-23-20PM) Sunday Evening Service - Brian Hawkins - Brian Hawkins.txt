appointment about his lungs and he said it all came back clear so we can thank the Lord for that breaking on but he did ask for last prayer because they think he might have diabetes in the harvest

Amy just thank the Lord for His goodness thank you for his grace thank you all for the hospitality all the fellowship that I've had the day it's good reconnecting with those that you haven't seen in a while but uh y'all are a blessing and just appreciate coming all the time and you know every time I'm invited it's it's been a it's been a blessing okay yeah but uh tonight it's my poor family they gonna listen to this again so I just preached on this last week but uh I just felt supported I was struggling which message to use and that's what I felt led to to come out with and last night this is what I felt led to come up here with so it might be a little different than unusual you know years ago when I first came in or when I first started ministering I was talking to brother Amen about it earlier is that it was a big to-do if you were an inspirational preacher it was you know you kind of looked down on if you do if you had a handful of notes but please don't look down on me I got a handful of notes because I just can't do that I can't remember everything this is just a task to get me in front of talking to people anyways so this is not something I mean don't take it wrong I enjoy ministering to you but being in front of people is not something that I look forward to so therefore I have notes so I hope it's okay if I have notes I've said it at home I'm not I don't think on my feet real well so I can't think of things real fast or if I do I lose track so I gotta have some kind of a guide but you know just as those that feel inspiration is the best way to go and not carry any notes but I do take time to study you know I would have a hard time with just coming out with just a couple things and just reading but just so you know that I look over things and I look and look because and I can't tell you how many times I've had things down and and then go to look something up well that's not right so here AC race you gotta get that out of there that doesn't line up so you got to go another Avenue so I do spend time researching and studying and I spent a lot of time my biggest thing is I'll have all kinds of thoughts written down but then just trying to organize it people have said to me or just get some scriptures together and and just get out there and talk it doesn't work that way it doesn't brother Jesse it just does not work that way because and and my mind and my heart is I want to bring you the best that I I that I'm able to I'm not going to go out on a whim and just grab some scriptures and and throw them out at you and call it good and leave I would I would be doing you a disservice if I did something like that so I imagine brother Jesse does the same thing read it and read it and go back to the message and read it and read it and going back to the message and you know you're comparing everything and you want to make sure everything lines up because I want to be right I want to be right before you and you may disagree with some things I may not have things exactly right but I've tried so it's not some aimless time that I've thrown after that I'm throwing out here so with that being said sometimes I need to babble to kind of calm down but I before I start I want to make sure that there are some things that I'm going to reference and one of one of them is brother Branham his message possessing the gates of the enemy in 1960 and March excuse me in 1964 see that's why I have notes because I would say something wrong but I also have it's a web page that I saw that that helped me along with it it just sparked some I already had the thought so it's not like they gave me the thought so please take that with a grain of salt but I just want a reference it that I have taken some part from that web page it's called set apart people I don't know their stance on God but the word is word so you know just took out this cherry pitch we like pie so let's eat some pie so may the Lord bless it let's bow our heads with saying that those graces Heavenly Father we just thank you once again that we could be here and Lord what a privilege it is to be able to preach your word to your people Noren just a wonderful people that they are Lord it truly is a privilege to be able to come and speak to them especially with a godly pastor and a man that stands on the Word of God and is very diligent and what he does Lord it's not tough fact that I'm following but it's just a different calling that I that I have that what he does and and the Lord this was that's what I believe that you laid on my heart and lord I pray that you would bless it to the years of those that are here to listen and father may we listen with an act of listening and not a passive the Lord just pray again that you would bless this evening bless your word protect my lips then I wouldn't say anything contrary to your word father we just want to be blessed and we just want to praise you and give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name we do pray amen let us turn to Ephesians chapter 6 and like I said to the home church I'm going to tell you the same thing shortly there's going to be a lot more to this you could say over brother you could have so much more to that and you're absolutely right because there's no way I'm going to exhaust it and there's a lot to it so the Ephesians chapter 6 and verse 12 here pages still turning we all set okay it says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places now what I'd like to speak on this evening is possessing the gates of your enemy and to possess a gate of the enemy in ancient time it meant to have control over your enemy so this evening we'll take a look at what the what different gates are and who our enemy is I'm sure you already know who our enemy is is all right so we know that our enemy is is not our brother and not our sister it's a Satan and his army now but these gateways that I'd like to talk about there there's spiritual gateways and again have in mind that the natural types of spiritual so in second excuse me go ahead and have your seats thank you second Corinthians chapter 2 and verse 11 is something that we well we should be living this whole scripture but it says lest Satan should get an advantage of us we certainly don't want him to have an advantage over us so we should we should have the advantage over him so we should take every step of precaution to stay one step ahead of him so he has nothing to hold against us amen and then it says for we are not ignorant of his devices now there are times I'm sure each one of us has fallen we've been in a fallen state but we have an advocate with the father and when we have been in that fallen state we recognize or we know how we got into that condition whether it was a flesh desire or or something less of the eyes or just a bad decision we remember how we got there how we got into that condition so when you remember how you got there you were no longer ignorant of his device amen so when you have that knowledge knowledge could be power but knowledge puffs up to as we said this morning so you want to carry that knowledge with humility and have the understanding that if I come across this situation again I know what happened last time when I fell into it I'll know what to do the next time so you'll you'll be better prepared so if you haven't noticed we are in a spiritual warfare and we all signed up when we said Lord I believe you when we became believers and I remember giving a testimony when I first came into the message and I had no idea of brother Branham said it so which just confirms what he had said is that smoking was a big thing for me so that would that was a that was a big hindrance for me and I wanted to quit but when I quit you know I felt the Lord leading to give a testimony and then it's just it's just mode nobody cares that I quit smoking two weeks ago and I haven't had a sir you know just the different thoughts that come into your mind that you know and that's how the enemy will work that he doesn't want to testify why would he come against us so much if it wasn't going to have some kind of power behind it you know if it wasn't going to mean anything he wouldn't fight against it so much but I just remember getting up and and I said man I've never had so many battles before and here brother branham said the same thing you haven't had any battles until you become a believer man and that's when the battle started you know everything else was kind of easy because you mixed into the crowd pretty much not to say that every person has an easy life I'm not saying that because there are some that have more struggles than others but we're here we're believers and we're pressing the battle we've got so many battles around us but rest assure we can conquer those battles amen so part of the the blessings given to Abraham was given by the angel of the Lord was that his seed would possess the gates of their enemy and which says it in Genesis 22 and 17 it says that in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because remember we were talking about this morning about the still small voice because thou passed obeyed my voice now Abraham please God by obeying his voice and we learned in Scripture that obedience is better than sacrifice and even even God himself said in the Old Testament that he did not take pleasure in the sacrifices but it was it was what became a requirement the sacrifices became a requirement it wasn't a pleasurable thing that that's something that God took in it wasn't a pleasure for him to partake in but it was something that was required of man to have fellowship with him because of the fall in the Garden of Eden amen so God loves obedience and for you to believe his word without question now we're gonna get somewhere with that because Abraham was an example of that he was he was an absolute example of believing without questions that right so when when God told him give up Isaac your only Son you know the promise son you know could you imagine me and my son yeah I just got him but he did what the Lord had had told him to do he didn't he didn't he didn't just immediately go to prayer and uh Lord this can't be it you know but he went he took it he believed God had his word and that's how he was blessed so much and in that same way we ought to be as a that we ought to believe God's Word and that's how Abraham became known as father of faith now because he believed he took God at His Word even if it meant giving his only his promised son I should say and not his only son because we know he had more than more than one but of the promised son now man that possesses that faith still we'll take God's Word regardless of circumstances now if you can't do that then you're not Abraham see that's the faith that Abraham had is his see the promise of Abraham was that his seed which is also the royal seed and this seal that he gave Abraham was a seal of promise remember we were talking about Supreme Being and a supreme promise and the supreme faith brings supreme results so who was the one in the Supreme God the Father right so the promise of Abraham excuse me that he gave it was a seal of promise and the royal seed according to Ephesians 4:30 is sealed by the Holy Ghost and after they have stood the test try to think of that he says after they have stood the test many think they got the Holy Ghost many claim to have the Holy Ghost many can show many evidences and signs of it but still if it can't stay with this word it's not the Holy Ghost amen so you believe every word then you are sealed after the test so we have many battles right we have many tests but it's when we accomplish those those tasks that we that we overcome those tests so then he says when we believe every promise in the word then we are sealed by the Spirit to confirm the promise that's the way Abraham did it then and only then have we the right to possess the gate of our enemy you cannot do it until first you become that seed now seed here it's speaking of offspring descendants posterity or future generations he's talking about children everybody kind of knew that right that wasn't some great hidden mystery but similar blessings were it was pronounced over Rebecca Genesis 24 and 60 but in this one it's her family that says it and in the mouth of two or three witnesses let everything be established but in Genesis 24 and 60 it says and they blessed Rebecca and said unto her thou art our sister excuse me be thou the mother of thousands of millions and let thy sea possess the gate of those which hate them now see over was her family giving that giving that blessing but with Abraham it was the angel of the Lord oh my now take note in in these two scriptures the same Hebrew word I guess you pronounce it zero but we know it as seed it's used in both of these scriptures in in Genesis 1 for Rebecca 1 for Abraham the Hebrew word is in both cases in singular form even though it was translated differently it could be translated as seed offspring or descendants but let's specifically look at the blessing God gave Abraham who is the seed of Abraham God is referring to to answer this we will use the scripture to ensure or to interpret scripture Galatians 3 and 16 it says now to Abraham and his seed where the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ see there there he was talking about Isaac would be the promised son but long term he was talking about Christ down the road amen that there was going to be one that was going to possess the gate of the enemy Isaac didn't possess the gate of the the enemy it was Jesus Christ who came and possess the gate of the enemy is that right so the royal seed of Abraham and from this interpretation it's clear that Jesus Christ is the one who possesses the gates of the enemy has all authority we were kind of talking about that this morning about who who made everything who was a creator of all and in Matthew 20 18 excuse me 28 and 18 it says and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is given unto me in heaven and earth and in Philippians 2:10 and 11 it says that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father now it doesn't matter what their stance is in this day if it's believer or unbeliever or atheist or agnostic or whatever it might be it says every tongue shall confess and every knee shall bow to the one who has the authority so we want to lift our God up this and this this evening right now it says notice the natural seed of Abraham let's check some of the natural seed that believed the full promise of God and had no question see that's the seed of the believer that's that's the trait of a believer I should say now remember there were tens of thousands times thousands times multiplied that was circumcised and everything else and still was not Abraham's seed sure that which is do outward is not Jew that which is Jew is inward the same thing for a Christian it's not that outward adorning but it's an inward man it's it's what's on the inside look we were talking this morning it's the makeup the composition of what's on the inside not necessarily blood and the organs and because I hate to say it I'm missing some of that we're all y'all might have some so it's not the inside part but it's what's on the soul the inside man is that right now many of them bitterly failed the day at the drinking of the fountain at st. John 6 it says they were all rejoicing jesus said i'm that rock that was in the wilderness I'm the bread that come from God out of heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die they said our fathers ate manna in the wilderness for forty years that's really something that's a long time forty years they've got the experience they know exactly how to handle things but but where did Jesus say you know in there and they're bragging they said our ancestors ate ate that bread for 40 years and Jesus said and every one of them are dead every single one of them are dead so they had nothing to stand on in front of Jesus they didn't really have that so see what I mean see what we were talking about this morning that knowledge puffeth up so it makes you think you're something when you're really nothing now dead take that word and run and see what it means it means eternally separated yet they were Abraham's seed because they had the the circumcision which was a promise it was a covenant the circumcision eternally separated yet they were Abraham's natural seed death means separation annihilation and completely destroyed jesus said they were dead every one of them yet they were circumcised Jews so can you can imagine them puckering up well how dare you talk to us like that we've we fulfilled our end of the covenant but see just because we're Methodists Oh Baptists Presbyterian or message got a little confession or something like that the devil believes just as much as we do amen so but you've got to be identified with it God has got to witness to it by a sealing of the Holy Spirit no question of the word he sees ins 430 I know we said it but we repeat it again sealed unto the day of your Redemption you have to have identification with them Redemption you had to be part of what brought you back anything redeemed has to come back to where it fell from to be bought back you're not bought by somebody else it comes back to the original purchaser oh my but we also learned from Scripture that Jesus has given us authority over the enemy hearing some amens that tells me you believe that and that wonderful thing that we have power over the enemy now the context of this next verse is spiritual warfare Luke chapter 10 and verse 19 Jesus says behold I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy not just a little bit here and there not just in one portion here but all power over the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you could you imagine those seventy that were out there or that those those disciples that were given the authority you know and they came running back to Jesus oh man they're just rejoicing they're having a good old time could you imagine a man you should have seen what I did to this demon over here that tried to get diabetes on that one you say to see what I did to that demon over their own food you should have seen him run like a chicken because he was scared to death when he said boo to me I said boo back when you have victory you rejoice right so why wouldn't you be happy so I can see where that those disciples would be happy that they had power of the enemy but let's look at verse 20 it says notwithstanding in this rejoice not that the spirits are subject unto you but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven see we have a place how much more bless it's not it is to know that he knows our name right having that personal relationship with him and it's not all about the power we rejoice in knowing that he knows our name but it's not so much about the power as we said this morning power without character is satanic right we know that so when we desire to have power and power and power what's the matter okay you got power whoo what else about it but let's go on a little bit deeper John 14 and 12 this is very familiar we even said said it this morning John 14 and 12 it says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me he that has a relationship with me you know it's having a relationship with our husband alright he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son so even still the father is being glorified it's not us having power and say glorify me and look upon me because that's not what love is love Lauren death not itself love doesn't point to itself but love points to the one creator amen love points to something else it's not taking on all the credit and then he says if you show ask anything in my name I will do it that's a supreme promise do you have the supreme faith oh my but more and more of the meat we need to be perfected is that right to be more like him staying calm in the storms like we were talking this morning when Jesus came out and said peace be still now is that something that we we could that how we are do we get all frantic over something that happened in our lives and we we just get off I can't handle it anymore you know if we want to be like him we need to be calm in the storms you know if we have an emergency at work the people that I want to be around are those that are nice calm cool calm and collective you know you're you're around somebody who gets all crazed up and worked up and you feel like you did about three weeks exercise in two hours you know because you're running to and fro into things which if you just calm down relax put your trusting on you know and just think about it a little bit we don't have to be up in arms and in a tizzy over everything you know that's how that's one way that we could be more like cameras just be calm I know it's easier said than done right but not being shaken by every wind of doctrine that comes about you know just because you hear something well just some events that have taken place recently I'm not I don't mean to bring anything up to stir anything up but don't let anything like that shake you you stay grounded in the Word of God amen for if the you know if you were talked into this I hate to tell you you're going to be talked out of it so if it's a true revelation to you you're not going to be talked out of it at least not very easily you know you're grounded and anchored in God you have nothing to worry about you just stay calm through this storm it'll pass it'll pass Paul said not one of these things bothers me for he was tied to an absolute are you tied to the absolute this morning this evening every day morning noon and night and every true excuse me for he was tied to an absolute which is Christ and every true achievement is tied to an absolute and my absolute is the word my AMSA your absolute isn't brother Jesse even though that might hurt his feelings I don't think so he would think the same thing as me my absolute is not brother Jim other people's absolute is not their pastor our absolute is not brother branham or absolute is Jesus Christ amen so that's who that's who is the author and finisher of our faith that's who we look unto that's our husband amen I'm sorry but I just think of brother Branham as le a czar with when he was introducing Isaac and Rebecca you know when he went and he got Rebecca and he's taking her back I sure hope he wasn't flirting with her you know but he was telling her all about Isaac right it was all about Isaac the ones have been getting ready to introduce her to her husband so a few if we're sitting here trying to flirt with brother Brando saying brother Branham is our deity he is our absolute oh my we're cheating on God there now aren't we it wouldn't be a cure it wouldn't be a pure bride hey man I hope that was okay but believe me I think brother branham has his place but and brother Jim's been hitting on it and I believe the same way that we shouldn't lift him up to date heat when somebody said something about him being close to Dede he says you're not far off he didn't say why you got that right you know he just said you weren't far off because Brett I think brother Brandon thought being a part of God you were God not being the supreme deity of God there has its it has its place amen where was I say I got off track oh absolutely and every true every true achievement is tied to an absolute my absolute is the word and everybody else that's really born of the Spirit their absolute is God's Word I'm tied to it I laid my hands upon it and it took my place and I've identified myself with him we knew that he promised to identify himself with us that brings genuine faith remember what we were talking about this morning about shining your light it's not your light and do the works but it's not your works brother Branham says that brings genuine faith but not your own faith but it's his face faith something that you don't control he does it now when we don't stand in the authority of Jesus that he's given us we we give the enemy free reign in our lives you understand what I mean there so if we don't if we don't exercise or so and in the Word of God and we just completely ignore what God doesn't are alive in our lives were you just set your Bible down you don't read you don't pray well guess what you're opening yourself up for the enemy to come in and take over you know for for what resistance does he have so the more you're into the word the more you're into praying the more you're into fellowship the more of a defense you're building up against the wiles of the devil you'll be able to quench the fiery darts of the enemy amen so now that we have all that established let's look at some of these these gates that we should possess now what is a gate in its original sense an opening a door or gate a city a door or gate or door port and hence the name porter when you read in the scripture that they're the ones who opened the door I kind of feel I think brother Jesse said it years ago I feel like Captain Obvious well no kidding we knew that all right so we're on the same page it wasn't anything of great mystery or anything right so everybody understands what a gate is a door is a gate but we'll get into some more but a gate of an entrance anything that you can enter an exit by of space inside a gate or since you come through that door we are in the sanctuary so it's an area around the gate which is also known as the gate well again we'll we'll get into that a little bit it's a space inside the gate a marketplace or a public meeting place a city or a town of might have you a gate of a palace or Royal Castle a temple or quarter of a tabernacle and then you have the gate of heaven that's the gate we all want to enter through right so gateways provided access and protection gates provided access into towns and and and villages and temples and houses you know in the evening time they would close the gates and if I'm sure you've read in the scripture at the evening time that close the gates and it's at some that sometimes I had the gates closed all the time or just open it up to let people in and out but then they closed it right back it depends on what was at depending on what was going on at that time it was a time of war they kept the gates closed if it was a type of piece of that they were more relaxed on it the gates served both to allow and to limit access when you control the gate you control the flow so if you have that door locked out there the only way somebody's going to get in so you're controlling the flow you're not letting any just anybody come in you're controlling the flow of who comes in now if they get in they'd have to go come in some other way all right so and then then they wouldn't have the proper wedding garment on is it because they're coming another way so they're not coming through the provided way that's the provided way so when the door is unlocked it's freely open to anybody to come in right so you control the flow through the gate in your own home in your body or wherever it might be you control the flows all right so and that's what it gets purpose is to serve but gates provided a physical barrier with guards to keep watch of of what came in and what came out hence hence the Watchmen on the on the walls and in the towers gates were made of wood sometimes covered with metal which would be overlaid with bronze gates like this we're seen as indestructible until a man like Samson comes across the gate oh yeah but that was something later the Lord right that was by the strength of strength of the Lord because no mortal man is going to rip the gates off of off of a at least the iron gates off of the gate off the post but what mortal man is going to be able to do something like that and it's just not gonna happen not without some other kind of a help so in this day they would need some kind of hoists or something to carry the gate if it's made of iron and if you have something of significant size not going to do it now we have a watchman a watchman that clamp climbed excuse me gettin tired watchman that climbed the ramparts of glory the Holy Spirit was sent back as the control tower and men and women who would believe God where's the control tower inside right that's the watchman the Holy Spirit was sent to us as a why spend that watches over us see that still small voice when it says don't do that you better move now don't listen to that and don't repeat that you know that's something that we got it that's that Watchtower that's that Watchmen in the watchtower he is our Guardians the Holy Spirit was sent to lead man to be the watchman of our soul now it's up to us if we listen to that school small voice or not it's up to us if we're going to listen to the watchman now if you read now I can't remember where it was now I want to say Ezekiel but I'm probably wrong it could be a Isiah that was talking about watchman one of the night but I'm talking about the watchman if the watchman gave out the warning to everybody and everybody heard it but those if they listened then everything was okay but if they didn't listen to the watchman then their blood was on themselves but if the watchman didn't give the warning and they were killed they were slain then the blood was upon the watchman right so the Holy Spirit was sent to lead man to be our watchman to be the watchman of our soul exactly right man wasn't to watch one another it was the Holy Spirit to watch over us he's our tutor he's our teacher the Holy Spirit is to teach right it says so in the scripture then we cry out to the Holy Spirit looking at these things watchman what are the night watchman what do you see what's going on in my life why am I going through this when will it be over but everything will be okay Psalms 30:5 it says for his anger endureth but for a moment in his favor his life weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning so hold on just a little bit longer joy cometh in the morning amen we have something to look forward to so when you're going through the trial this is temporary because the things that are seen are only temporary but the things unseen are eternal is that right so the things that the the being that we don't see we have something way down the line there where he's going to console every sorrow every pain amen praise God the joy cometh in the morning but what good is a gate if there are no walls we need fortified completely is that right if you'd have no wall what purpose is a gate just sitting in the middle of nowhere I know some weddings now that just have the what do you call that the arch you call that okay we'll call it an arch they just have that set in there so that's that's something in my mind so if you were to go out into the country and you just saw a door to nothing you know what good is it yeah you just have a the the doorway and you have the door and there are no walls and and you see table with all this stuff in there well what's going to keep the person out what goodness the door gonna do if there are no walls to fortify to keep what's inside all the hidden treasure to keep it safe what's the purpose of the gate then if you just let anybody in but where's the protection nothing would be restricted no self-control it'd be a free-for-all for wickedness to have full rein and that's what we do sometimes as we leave the door open I'm trying to think it would when brother Benson but had in the head of the goats get in because we let the bars now and leaving the bars now you know and that's how the goats get in that's how the wickedness gets in that's how folly gets in when we leave our defenses down but the gate has to have a purpose amen for how else could Jesus say that he's the door of the sheepfold so gates were places of where judgment was spoken is everybody okay the same I just don't want to bore you to death but gates were places where judgment was spoken people would go to the gates when the determination was to be made regarding right and wrong it was at the gate that government and law was decided on and communicated to the people here judicial decisions were made the King often had a seat or a throne in the gate for these purposes and that the example of that is in 2nd Samuel 19 and 8 it says then the King arose and sat in the gate and they they told unto all the people saying behold the King doth Center in the game so knowing that the King is sitting in the gate and all the people came before the king for Israel had fled every man to his tent so in the king when it was announced that the king was in the gate all the people ascendant so when we say when brother Jesse says we're going to have Church all the believers ascended right all the believers came together in head Church 1st Kings 22 and 10 it says in the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sent each on his throne having put on their robes and a void place and the entrance of the gate of Samaria and all the prophets prophesied before them so there's some more issues being taken care of at the gate now in 2nd Samuel 15 and verse 2 and 2 through 6 we'll read it says and Absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate so notice he was standing in the game and it was so that when any man that had a controversy controversy came to the king for judgments a judgment and at the gate then Absalom called out to him and said oh what city art thou and he said thy servant is is one of the tribes of Israel and Absalom said unto Him see thou matters are good and right but there is no man deputed of the King to hear thee so Absalom taking advantage of this situation Absalom said moreover all that I were made judge in the land that every man which have any soot or cars might come unto me and I would do him justice now I do believe that the king was judge at that time so he was trying to work his way oh that I would be king it's a self-serving knowing your enemies devices and it was so that when any man came Knight to him to do him obeisance he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him he performing the duty that he shouldn't have been that that wasn't his right position and on this manner did Absalom to all Israel that came to the king for judgment so Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel see he was trying to undermine King undermine King David at that time he was trying to put him out so yes treachery even happens inside the gate where all these things happen now for this temporary point of time Absalom had kind of had control of what was taking place at the gate without the knowledge of King David so things like that have it and remember in where board Esther where Mordecai he heard the the two men planning against the king so he heard them inside where inside the gate I do believe is where the Mordecai was sitting inside the gate and he heard the two men just working to the overthrow the king so that's where a lot of treachery takes places inside the gate inside fellowship where gossip happens oh my so you control the flow you control what happens in the gate you hear gossip you don't have to listen to it elders gathered in the gates to make rulings and decisions Ruth chapter 4 and verse 1 is a good example here I'm talking about bow has then went Boaz up to the gate and sat him down there and behold the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by unto whom he said hosts such a one turn aside sit down here and he turned aside and sat down and he took 10 men are the elders of the city and said sent you down here and they sat down because they had business to perform let's go to the tenth birth first then talking so much my words are going together verse 10 it says moreover ruth the moabite is the wife of my Malone have I purchased to be my wife to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance that the name of the Dead be not cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place Geir are witnesses this day see just rulings and decisions and different things it took place inside the gate so I'm just trying to establish to you of how important that happenings are and what happens in the gate that it's important in verse 11 it says and all the people that were in the gate and the owner said we are witnesses the Lord make the woman that has come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah which too did build the house of Israel and do thou worthily in Ephrata I'm not sure how to pronounce it and be famous and Bethlehem now see with Ruth and Beth excuse me Ruth and Boaz came Oh bed and after Oh bed became Jesse and from Jesse came David the root and the offspring oh my down on the line to the seat of Christ amen even though we know that Jesus was not born of man through the lineage of man but born of the Holy Spirit is that right but even still through the genealogy I preached on line of triumph of Judah here didn't I so I don't know if everybody here heard that me going through the genealogy of that whole thing so you see what happened there and without obeyed or without Jesse how is it going to come yeah so this was it was predestinated but the gate was also a general meeting place when you when you say general meeting place I can't help but think of the youth you know they need some place to go yeah so you think of Facebook you think of MySpace and MySpace was before Facebook I think something like they're around the same time and but Facebook somehow over overtook him just pushed them out I think and became so much more popular but then you have Instagram and what are all those other ones that don't get it it's a snapchat yeah all these different ones see you know so you get the idea you see him where I'm going with that is back in the day they had the gate was a place of gathering but now there's a gateway to another gathering we'll get to that but gateways were the social fiber of the community here norms and values were determined friendships and social connections were made reputations were made or brought down how do you perform in your gig Psalm 69 and verse 11 and I know I have a lot of scripture so it's but it's all relative just just bear with me for a few more minutes Psalm 69 verse 11 it says I made sackcloth also my garment and I became a proverb to them they that sit in the gate speak against me and I was the song of the drunkards see even gossip as I said happens inside the gate and reputations are built up or destroyed one or the other proverbs 31 and 23 excuse me it says her husband is known in the gates as known he had a reputation built up when he sitteth among the elders elders of the land and in verse 31 of that same chapter says give her of the fruit of her hands and let her own works praise her and the gates say even when the people talk amongst themselves the the social connection or how people view one another it's all talked about inside the gate this is a social connection and it's all how you when did we read this morning that if you say you love God but you hate your brother he is a liar right so when you're saying oh I love so-and-so I love so-and-so and then you tear this one down inside that social connection now to stay there with me hang out in the gate with me what's destroyed a persons influence a person's reputation hey man we don't want to be we don't want to do that so see you control the flow you can control what you say and you can help guide what others are saying you don't have to participate on what they're saying you don't have to piggyback on on the things that they say now the Gateway was the marketplace that was one of the definitions that we gave is it's a marketplace the economy was controlled in the Gateway my movement too fast isn't everybody okay when I get focused I just go I just don't yeah yes you get what I mean second Kings chapter 7 verse 1 it says then Elisha said here either word of the Lord thus saith the Lord tomorrow about this time shall a measure of fine flour be sold for a shekel and 2 measures of barley for a shekel we're in the gate of Samaria see so even the economy was controlled inside the gate so there is a lot that takes place inside the gate so there are many references to I think that's the last one but there are many references in Scripture to gates and and what I brought forth tonight that that's only a miniscule of what's in there so you know there's much more that you could read on it but uh but just to show you how how significant gates were in the Bible but when we consider how gates function we understand how important it was for a city or a community to be in possession of their own gate waste if their enemy had possession the enemy would be able to control em free area of their lives everything every facet of their lives they'd be able to control it they would tell it dictate how they would live how they would believe try to tell you how to believe how you should dress they would control everything so we also know that the natural types of spiritual and understanding the natural gives us an insight into the spiritual realm so when we go further and consider these physical gateways as representative to spiritual gateways we understand how essential it is for us to possess our own gates and not to let us slip into possession of the enemy allowing this would allow the enemy to have control over every area of our lives our economy or our finances our social norms our values our friendships and our social connections every day key decisions government and laws our physical protection see that's what the gate is protecting you from all those things that you hold dear it's protecting it it's not letting the outside world come in but it's shunning the very the the very appearance of evil anything that would be contrary to God it's trying to keep out as long as you let it stay out but as soon as you open that door it's welcome to come in and just take control but a gateway in ancient context had a major influence over the lives of the people within the gates so whoever controlled the gateway controlled the lives of the people now as I said there are many references to gates being mentioned in the Bible so if you want to read this for further reading later or whatever but there's also the gate of heaven and we I think I talked about that before about keys so there's the gates of hell and there's gates of righteousness and there's gates of death but these references confirm the gates can indeed be spiritual so these ones that I just mentioned are more relative to spiritual spiritual gates now when I hear the word gateway I think of a router that's because I was I was in the computers I was kind of getting into IT a little bit so when you think of a router what a router is going to do is it's it's also known as a gateway it has that's part of the computer that talks to other protocols to allow this permission and deny this one and allow this one it allows all the software and the hardware to communicate but do you know this as the Internet I know you all know what I'm talking about but as I said when I think of Gateway that's pretty much what my mind first goes to as a router so and when you have a router you could set up certain permissions to control the flow of what enter what access you allow the Internet to come in they've kind of made it a little bit more difficult now with with the technology trying to get things set up to control the flow because these hackers they could pretty much get through anything and so those walls that you try to put up and it's almost useless you got to stay on top of these on top of these guys and by the new the latest and greatest software for a small fortune an arm here or finger there so you know you've just got to be careful with you which you allow through the internet see the TV brother branham talked about the TV allowing Satan into your home through the TV instead of going out to the movie house you brought it into your home now see we have something that's even worse than the TV called the Internet because you can access anything through the internet you know people say it all the time you can find anything you want on the Internet but why is it that I have a hard time finding what I'm looking for yeah you can find anything but what you're looking for yeah I'm trying to work on a vehicle and I'm trying to find a specific thing and when you know what I can't find it for that specific vehicle I can find it for all these other hundreds of vehicles but I can't find it for the specific one that we have so you can find anything what you want except what you need but this is my take on on gateways is the internet that's like I said that's like the first thing that comes to my mind talking about gateway because truly that what we allow to come in into our minds that's going to dictate whether we have mind battles or whether we have peace of mind you know it plays a big part so if you allow yourself to watch something are I shouldn't watch that movie you know some of them I don't even want to name any names because I don't want to give any credit to them but you watch some ungodly movies made back in the where I could think up now but I still don't want to say but back in the 80's 90's you know I grew up watching movies always movie fanatic but if you watch one now when you get done your why don't I just watch that I knew that was wrong and now you're gonna be thinking about that movie you're gonna think about all the things that you saw in there and you can't unsee those pictures that you see unless it's by the grace of God you know just so all those all those movies you know and I wish I could remember I wish I could forget some of those scripts because if I was if I was to watch some of those movies I'd be able to quote some of the lines up to you why can't I do that with the Word of God you know I don't I don't know why that's such a struggle same thing with music you will be talking at work somebody will say something then I'll just break I won't sing it but I'll just break out the line of a song and I don't even know the whole song but it's just stuff that I remember when I was younger I wish I could forget those things but but for some reason they're still there and I've prayed about it Lord take this out of my I don't want to think on those things because I want to meditate on those things that are that are good those things that are lovely you know I want to meditate upon God's Word but uh a few more minutes is that Alright but we can define gateways as a place of Dominion mm-hmm by Dominion we mean a territory or sphere of influence or control a position of power and strength and this is something else I want to get to about the the Gateway as far as the Internet I think this is yeah this is brother branham here excuse me and of course there isn't a whole wall of belief here tonight and if I ever ask you to bow your head don't think heart of that because there's many people really there's many people really think that they believe it's kind of what I was talking about this morning they say they think that they really believe but way down in the sub-conscience some conscious is a little something there that says no there's something in the subconscious no matter what you say but something deep inside says I don't believe that that's not for me or it might be the days of miracles have passed you know that's good for so-and-so but not good for me if you only knew what I did what I've done it doesn't matter what you've done as long as you've repented of it I had a fellow at work just asked me the other day we were talking about forgiveness he says now how do you how do you what's your view on God and forgiveness and do you think God remembers it I said not a fit stone in the sea of forgetfulness you come with a contrite heart and a contrite spirit a broken heart contrite spirit and you come before you before him in sincerity and you come in him come before him and truth and lay confession down I believe you're forgiven of it no matter what it was and it's thrown in the sea of forgetfulness now we can't think of God as a man because man remembers but what we do is we just don't we might forgive sometimes it's hard to forgive but when we forgive we don't forget but we just don't trust and that's the hard thing is that you have a hard time trusting that person and no matter how much they've groveling at your feet please forgive me please forgive me I'll never do it again we still have a hard time trusting that's just our makeup of man it's one of our defense mechanisms it's just the way we are so sometimes I have to get to get the people to bow their head because the eye is the gateway to the soul so what you allow your eyes to see it's entering in through your soul and it's influencing what's down in your soul we're gonna get to that here in a minute but they're looking to see what they can see let's see people have to see something tangible they want to see what's going on they want to see the move of God happen and they just can't take it for what it is they actually have to to see so any caution about that and I'm sure I think you've taught on that brother Jesse about closing your eyes during prayer especially when when casting out demons you don't want your eyes open and why is that because they could transfer from one person to the next and if you're irreverent in prayer and you're just watching what's going on is it man I don't believe this is just a hoax well ah there with the demon out of that person guess where it went right into you because as irreverence the disrespect for God and just the irreverence of not bowing your head that's what's going to bring damnation upon you that's just what happens and he says and sometimes you have to ask them you won't think bad about that as what he was asking but uh as far as the internet and TV different things magazines whatever it might be the eye is the gateway to the soul you know and just some of those things that you see you can't take it back you cannot unsee it you know sometimes we talk about that I don't even know if that's a word but that that's what we say it worked you know if when somebody describes somebody you know a not-so-pleasant ways like oh man now I can't unsee that thank you for putting that image in my mind now I can't now that's gonna be in my mind and that's true that's what happens to us is then you'll start thinking about it and then when somebody brings something up guess what that's what you think about it's a mind battle that you so why would you increase your battles that you have already so stay away from it but don't be ignorant of the enemy's devices hey men now gateways can be very personal we individually have spirit soul and body gateways our body for example has five gateways touch taste smell sight and hearing fine our spirit has five senses now if you read through the message and you start searching through this you're gonna find he says different things at different times and so I just had to and I knew he said it somewhere I just couldn't find it and I was getting in a hurry so I took the ones the the most recent I should say the latest in years so but he said that the five senses spirits the five senses of the spirit our thought memory conscience reasoning and affection if I have that wrong brother please let me know but our soul has only how many gateways one gateway and that's free moral agency or self we'll say somebody who is pulling stuff out this afternoon trying to get ahead of everybody else but when is he says this but when it's directed from the inside it throws all the rest of it together that's the guidepost that's the control tower which is on the inside the inside of the inside he says the soul controls the spirit and the spirit controls the body and that's in works as faith expressed 65 November 26 now see faith is the one that's not exercised very much that's also known as The Sixth Sense which is hardly pulled out as one of the wild cards in our deck we tend to forget about faith it's often set aside well as we said this morning it takes faith to flip on a light switch it takes faith to start your card put the key in the ignition and start to start to start the vehicle or whatever it might be simple faith like that we tend to forget we get in a tizzy like I was talking earlier about about being calm in the storms we just let it take control of us instead of us taking control of the situation we allow it to control us because we forget we forget who we are we live under our privileges we forget that we're sons and daughters of God and then oh how am I going to get out of this one well who got you out of the last one it's the same it's not Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever so if Jesus Christ delivered you last week what's going to prevent him from delivering you this week is he not still the same Amen that's our God amen but now all of our gateways everything our spirit soul in our body everything all of our gateways must be subject to God's Authority defilement of any of these gateways will not only affect our lives but also our relationship with God we certainly wouldn't knowingly allow the enemy to have access or control of our gateways yet we allow him access because we are not Watchmen on the walls of our own gateways we're not paying attention again what we read earlier this morning we should not be ignorant of our enemy's devices we should have we should be knowledgeable of how he works but Satan knows these spiritual principles and works hard to control us and sadly we allow it due to our ignorance hmm all right a few more minutes a few more minutes okay okay I did like this study it was a pretty good study you know many times we just read over scripture because we get in our minds I gotta have my devotions I got to get my devotion time in let's see well looks like a good spot Isaiah 29 what a arial 'arial is city winter David dwelt in New Year all right I did my duty let's go to work sometimes we do that because we get so much under a hurry but we don't give God our time yes I'm guilty of that I'm preaching to myself so if I could preach myself I could preach to you right all right we got that taken care of so yes what happens is we don't give God the time that we have that we need to give him and in our prayer life we forget about the sixth sense of faith we forget about God who delivered us from previous issues that we had and now we forget about prayer prayer is one of the most one of the biggest weapons we have against the enemy is all right it's one of the biggest weapons we have and one of the less least used oh my but when we pray regularly regularly to God at a specific place or an altar it an altar is established a prayer altar creates a gateway to heaven you are accessing a channel that accesses the gateway to heaven you don't need a priest you don't need to confess your sins to somebody else yes the scripture says confess your faults one to another but you don't need a priest for we have one mediator between man and God and it's the man Jesus Christ is that right you don't need to go to somebody else to get forgiveness of it the forgiveness of sins you go to one and that that's that's one of the downfalls we have is we don't know how to pray to God well you think you got to come up with these these flowery words and and these great big words to please God to make yourself sound educated he already knows you're in your ignorance right he knows our human infallibility he knows our faults and our failures but you know let us have a little talk with Jesus tell them all about struggles troubles what does it say but so we're sitting down talking to God you could talk to God you have direct contact with God you don't have to conjure up you know a burn incense you don't have to conjure up some spirits just for you to talk to God you don't have to deal with some man to get access to God no but you have direct access to God and just to talk to him that's all yeah and what a privilege it is you don't we don't understand the privilege that we have that we were able to speak to God yes because all you have to do is just just like you're talking to me just like you're talking to brother vang brother Jesse and my wife that's all you had to do just talk to him normal not like he's some far-off distance he's right there and you don't have to shout cuz he's right there he could hear you you don't have to slam on the older you don't have to beat on the pulpit you don't have to beat on drums he can hear you amen it's your direct access it's you speaking to God live dear is there a friend that sticks closer as a brother it's our Lord Jesus Christ right amen but when we enter that prayer we opened up that channel we opened up that gate for communication with him we open that line of communication but it's not just us talking it's not a monologue but it should be a dialogue or at least if it is a monologue it should be more God speaking than us speaking so we should be listening for his voice when we talk to him when when we have conversation with one another do we allow the other person to speak or do you just overrun the whole conversation you see what I mean so we shouldn't spend all of our time in prayer just talking and babbling all these vain babblings and and this and this and this and this God knows your struggles he knows your troubles he's not ignorant to them but he just wants you to talk to him for a little while you know what's wrong with a relationship with your husband with what kind of relationship would a wife in it and a husband be if they didn't talk to one another there's separate rooms that are passing well that's a close marriage isn't it we want everybody's marriage to be like ours it's so sweet but we don't talk to one another some people might feel that's bliss I don't know but but it shouldn't be you know we should be able to talk to God sorry that yeah that was that wasn't in my nose brother yeah I think I said the same thing at the other church but it's still cousin my mind is that people just have the wrong idea about prayer I think and that's what hinders us a lot of why we don't receive things one you got to believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of those that diligently seek him right so that that's kind of the first step so or if you don't believe in God that he's gonna answer your prayer than why talk to him in the first place when we call upon Jesus name which means to worship Him and pray to Him a prayer altar is established and a gateway is formed into the heavenlies second Corinthians chapter 10 and verse 3 says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ so every thought that is unlike God or tries to exalt itself above God you must consciously take a hold of that thought and bring it into subjection unto the word it's something that you control you control that gate in your mind you control what you allow yourself to see granted sometimes there are billboards out there that that you really didn't want to see but when you allow yourself you completely drop the barn you allow yourself to to look at those things that's where it comes in you know if you innocently look at something - lord I didn't want to see that you know it's not a desire that was down in your heart for you to look at unless you take a second look but casting excuse me bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ and having an ax readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled so you can have revenge by being obedient through your obedience you revenge against disobedience musicians you can come home I'm gonna start closing winding down here but like I said whoever has control of the gate has control of the inside you know just like the the black and the white dog it's it's uh that goes what was that with with Abraham and Sarah yeah with King Abimelech thinking was what it was when he was innocent going to the innocence part of it when Abimelech saw Sarah he desired to have Sarah and he he set set forth to marry her right so what happened is in the dream God came and said you're as good as a dead man if you do it what you're planning on doing and what it Abimelech said I'm innocent I didn't know he lied to me he told me it was his sister and what did God say he said I know you're innocent that's why I'm coming to you that's why I'm telling you to you talk to Abraham my prophet and didn't pray for you now we were talking about free moral agency earlier today bin Malik that this is an example of the free moral agency granted God came and told him and said if you do this thing you're as good as a dead man but if you don't you go have Abraham come and pray for you that was a decision that was laid in a BIM Alexa now somebody came to me later he was messing with me saying well did he really have a decision did he really have an option well not really but he made the he made the right decision because one was of life and one was of death right that was the decision that he was faced with could he have said no and went to marry I forgot her name Sarah if if he would have said no and I'm gonna marry Sarah anyway that was his free moral agency that was a choice he had to make but he decided to go in the way of that's that's still small voice is that right he went according to the voice and in that way proves that that it was life is that right now getting back to the the white and the black dog you know everybody should be familiar with that story that brother branham talked about the indian man and said that he had a dream of a black dog and a white dog and and the fella asked him well which one wins he said well that depends it's it's it depends on whichever one I feed the most so whichever one I give the most attention to that's the one that's going to have control of my life so which one whichever one I opened myself up to whichever one I let the the gate down to whether it's the the prayer opening channel of a gate then the white dog wins but if I close that gate of a prayer channel reading and just talking with the Lord and just completely disregard his word that way is death right for the wages of sin is death so it's unbelief when you follow that black dog you're allowing unbelief to come into your life so we want to feed on the word right a true son and daughter of God is going to feed on the word the Holy Ghost inside of you can't feed on anything else but the Word of God yeah that's we'll go ahead and close with the sustaining your feet I'm just gonna read this 2nd Corinthians 2 at verse 14 it says now thanks be unto God which always causeth us to triumph in Christ oh my now thanks be unto God which always causeth us to triumph in our own way in our own words through Christ and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place brother Branham says this it says God has given God has give you your healing but you'll fight every inch of it I think he was talking to a sister he says God has given given you your healing but you'll fight for every inch of it everywhere the soles of your feet sets that I give you for possession he says foot prints means possession it's all yours every promise belongs to you but you'll fight for every every inch of the way in now foot prints as possession these are your print these are God's promises these are for you to have in the home forevermore amen amen [Music] Sperry Heavenly Father is just thank you for this this word that you've brought forth allow us to read through tonight and allowed us to preach on tonight I just pray that it would be a help to my brothers and sisters here tonight and Lord you're the magnificent one you're the one we should be looking to the Lord be with each and every one of us that would that we would every whenever we wake up in the morning whenever we're going throughout our day whether it be noontime or evening time or bed time no matter what it would be that we would set our our thoughts upon you for your scripture says to pray without ceasing and lord help us to do just that that we would have a spirit of Prayer about us all the time through every aspect of our life every decision that we have to make may we seek the kingdom of God first and and then all the other things will be added unto it so lord help us that we would seek you first and everything that we would do no matter how minuscule it is Lord we know that you want to hear about our day we you want to know every aspect even though you already know it but you want to hear us communing with you talking to you about what we're going through Lord I truly believe that and when we have when we talk to you more the closer we get to you reading into your word asking you for revelation not asking some man for revelation for God kit excuse me for man
