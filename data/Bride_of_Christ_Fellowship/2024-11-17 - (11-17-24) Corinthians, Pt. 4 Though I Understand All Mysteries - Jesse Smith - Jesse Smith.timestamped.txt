[0:52] Lord because you're merciful you're
[0:53] gracious you're the merciful and
[0:55] faithful high priest Lord I pray you
[0:57] minister to all the needs Lord and feed
[0:59] your people the word of God as you
[1:00] promised Lord you said I'd water my
[1:02] people day and night every moment you'll

[1:06] guarding us thank you for keeping us now
[1:08] Feed Us Lord water us with thy Spirit we
[1:11] pray in Jesus Christ's name and the
[1:13] Saints said am amen God bless you as
[1:15] you're being seated praise
[1:18] God so Cas I have some slides here today
[1:20] by God's
[1:23] grace so I've had this thought I've told
[1:25] you a few times over the last few months
[1:27] I'd like to preach on this thought of uh
[1:29] the understand all
[1:31] Mysteries um because we're a people that
[1:34] understand the mysteries of God as far
[1:36] as all that is uh known to us uh in the
[1:40] scripture by God's
[1:42] grace uh so we want to look at that here
[1:44] today uh by the help of the
[1:51] Lord and afterwards I might sing a good
[1:53] old song Jose always sings me a battle
[1:56] himym of the Republic he always sings
[1:57] that song there I love those verses
[2:00] brother Ram sing some special verses
[2:01] there by God's
[2:05] grace so I just thought I'd see if that
[2:07] will come up there PC
[2:11] in it's okay if it doesn't come
[2:16] up is that all connected
[2:23] here
[2:25] no okay all right no problem all is well
[2:31] so uh Scofield gave us a little uh copy
[2:34] or a little outline and we're I'm
[2:36] skipping ahead the first part is the
[2:37] introduction the believer standing in
[2:39] Grace and we are preaching on the carnal
[2:41] state of the Corinthians uh how they
[2:44] were extremely carnal but also extremely
[2:46] gifted they had a lot of Charisma you
[2:48] know the Greek word gift comes from uh
[2:51] I'm sorry the English word gif comes
[2:53] from the Greek word Charisma that's
[2:55] where we get uh Caris you know Caris is
[2:57] part of that it's a it's a gift of Grace
[2:59] the word grace in the Greek is Caris um
[3:02] but when you're gifted with a gift it's
[3:05] Charisma so these these uh Corinthians
[3:08] were extremely gifted uh many gifts uh
[3:11] but uh they they were lacking in some
[3:13] areas so I love how God uh corrects all
[3:16] those that he loves Hallelujah if he
[3:17] loves you he'll correct you amen so we
[3:20] see that God does this here uh with the
[3:22] Corinthians now I want to get the
[3:23] context here U uh second I'm sorry 1
[3:26] Corinthians 12:28 and God hath set some
[3:29] in the the church first apostles
[3:31] secondarily prophets thirdly teachers
[3:34] after that Miracles then Gifts of
[3:36] healing helps governments diversities of
[3:39] tongues so the context of chapter 13 is
[3:42] God has set each person right where he
[3:45] wants them brother Ram said the best
[3:46] thing we can do is be ourselves and not
[3:48] try to be like somebody else Hallelujah
[3:51] so all we can do is draw close to God
[3:53] and and uh as God leads us by the Holy
[3:56] Spirit to manifest the love of God to
[3:58] other people and to be used by the holy
[4:00] spirit in the gifts God has given to us
[4:02] hallelujah because God set you as we'd
[4:05] say a pastor for my sake or God set
[4:07] brother Brandon as a prophet uh god Set
[4:10] each one of us maybe with the gift of
[4:11] faith or Divine Healing right or uh
[4:14] wisdom remember above all the gifts the
[4:17] nine gifts wisdom rule rules over all of
[4:19] them praise God so brother BR reminds us
[4:22] to uh to to remember that wisdom is
[4:24] above all else no no wonder the Bible
[4:26] said uh the main thing the principal
[4:28] theme of man is wisdom with all you're
[4:31] getting get wisdom so we use the gifts
[4:33] to honor God in a way that edifies the
[4:36] majority the biggest number of people
[4:38] the church Hallelujah for for example as
[4:41] Paul said tongues only edifies one
[4:43] person unless it's interpreted but a
[4:45] gift of wisdom could bless everybody
[4:47] brother B said a prophecy or the Bible
[4:49] said the prophecy can bless the entire
[4:51] church Hallelujah so seek to edify the
[4:54] entire church so the the context is God
[4:58] sets us in the gifts that we have verse
[5:00] 29 all are all Apostles are all prophets
[5:03] are all teachers are all workers of
[5:05] Miracles have all the gifts of healing
[5:07] do all speak with tongues do all
[5:09] interpret of course these are all no
[5:11] answers but covet earnestly the best
[5:15] gifts so God has set you with a gift
[5:18] right God has set our brothers and
[5:19] sisters with a gift uh and we're to
[5:21] covet the best gifts we're to pray God
[5:24] give us gifts that edify the whole
[5:26] church Hallelujah and then but yet now
[5:30] Paul makes a turn he's turning a corner
[5:32] and he says yet I'll show you a more
[5:35] excellent
[5:37] way and so chapter 13 is the excellent
[5:41] way you've been heard it called that of
[5:42] course before I'm sure if you've been
[5:44] around churches any very long the more
[5:46] excellent way in the Greek more
[5:48] excellent means Superior so Paul says
[5:50] I'm going to show you a superior way
[5:53] right so there's a there there's
[5:54] something Superior than to just Desiring
[5:56] gifts right Desiring gifts is good and
[5:58] finding your place is good but Superior
[6:01] above that is manifesting the love of
[6:04] Christ another word is Excellence so
[6:07] it's the excellent way it's the
[6:09] preeminence way Hallelujah so charity is
[6:12] the way of preeminence giving God
[6:14] preeminence uh by love it's he's going
[6:17] to show you uh the way beyond measure
[6:20] the exceedingly way the preeminently way
[6:24] and the beyond all measure way I'm going
[6:26] to show you a more excellent way uh
[6:29] Hallelujah a superior way a way that's
[6:31] above all other ways the ways of Love
[6:35] Hallelujah the word way of course if you
[6:37] ever studied history that's what
[6:39] Christianity was first called before it
[6:40] was called Christianity it was called
[6:42] the
[6:42] way the early Believers after Pentecost
[6:45] it was just called the way because
[6:47] everybody else was a Jew or everybody
[6:48] else was a heathen or a Greek or
[6:50] whatever they were in the certain areas
[6:52] and
[6:53] Roman but Christianity was called the
[6:55] way so Paul says I'm going to show you
[6:57] the the more excellent way there's a
[6:59] super ior way to live than just Desiring
[7:02] gifts of God there's something greater
[7:04] than gifts Hallelujah now the word way
[7:06] means a course of conduct it's a manner
[7:09] of thinking feeling or deciding and I
[7:13] like I like how it places it it places
[7:15] this more excellent way in the human
[7:17] mind right because we spend most of our
[7:20] time in our mind
[7:21] Hallelujah right about how how do I
[7:24] respond to this how do I how do I
[7:26] address this and uh what should I think
[7:28] about that and how should I think about
[7:31] that how long should I think about this
[7:33] we spend a lot of time in our minds
[7:35] contemplating things and so Paul said
[7:38] I'm going to show you a superior way of
[7:41] thinking feeling or making decisions in
[7:43] your life and that Superior way is the
[7:46] love of
[7:47] God see Paul knew this group this this
[7:51] Corinthian group they needed a more
[7:53] excellent they need a superior way of
[7:55] thinking in order to exist together
[7:58] because they were already divided on who
[7:59] is the best preacher and who baptized
[8:02] them uh they already had sexual
[8:04] immorality among them and they weren't
[8:06] they weren't upset about it the Bible
[8:07] said they were puffed up in other words
[8:10] they're like well it's okay everybody
[8:11] has mistakes it's okay if this man's
[8:13] sleeping with his stepmother I mean aren
[8:14] we all who are you to judge us we all
[8:17] got problems well that's true in one way
[8:19] but it's not true in another way
[8:21] Hallelujah if we claim to be Christ he
[8:23] that nameth the name of Christ let that
[8:25] man or woman depart from iniquity
[8:27] Hallelujah we can't claim to know Christ
[8:30] and then no continue to live in sin it's
[8:32] contrary one to the other Hallelujah
[8:35] they were also planning to sue each
[8:37] other uh and Paul said you need a more
[8:39] excellent way than than just seeking
[8:41] gifts and seeking for Supernatural in
[8:43] the church services there's a greater
[8:45] way than that Hallelujah and then he
[8:47] said they got drunk at the Lord's table
[8:49] and the rich people looked down upon the
[8:51] poor people in the church and these
[8:53] things should not be in a Christian
[8:54] Church Hallelujah he said they needed a
[8:57] more excellent way because uh their
[8:58] gifts were out of order and too many
[9:00] tongues and too many interpretations
[9:02] Paul said at the most three and but they
[9:04] would just let it go on and go on and on
[9:06] and
[9:06] on he said they lacked even generosity
[9:09] to St Paul Paul had to get uh uh uh his
[9:13] his his daily needs met by other
[9:15] churches because the Corinthian Church
[9:17] failed to give Paul just basic food and
[9:20] shelter and clothing and things and then
[9:22] he also said that they suffered false
[9:24] teachers because the false teachers were
[9:27] so eloquent and they were just uh so
[9:29] precise and no doubt they were rich as
[9:31] well uh he said they allowed the false
[9:35] teachers to influence them and Paul's
[9:37] saying you need a more excellent way you
[9:40] need a superior way to live your lives
[9:42] as a church Hallelujah well Satan is
[9:44] going to rip the church apart Hallelujah
[9:47] now uh 1 Corinthians 14 now now so after
[9:50] 13 let's look at the context so before
[9:52] it's I you know you should seek these
[9:54] gifts these gifts are great uh we don't
[9:57] remember we don't want to bury our
[9:58] talent in the ground that's the worst
[9:59] thing we can do remember out of the
[10:02] parable of talents the worst thing you
[10:03] could have done is bury your talent in
[10:05] your ground say I'm not going to do
[10:06] anything for Jesus I'm too afraid to do
[10:08] anything for Jesus I'm gonna fail that's
[10:11] the worst attitude you can have how can
[10:13] I fail if Jesus is on my side amen how
[10:16] could I fail amen if he give me money if
[10:19] he give me Talent if he give me ability
[10:21] it's impossible for me to fail I just
[10:23] got to take him at his word and believe
[10:25] his promises amen invest my life into
[10:28] the things of God into the ways of God
[10:31] and surely I'll be a Victor I'll be a
[10:33] hero right as Henry wodsworth wodsworth
[10:35] Longfellow said Hallelujah be a hero
[10:38] Hallelujah but now right after he gets
[10:40] into love and we'll of course Circle
[10:42] back to love
[10:43] there in First Corinthians 14:1 he says
[10:46] follow after charity so after he gives
[10:49] us the description of Charity which
[10:50] we'll get to he said follow after it and
[10:54] desire spiritual gifts so I love this he
[10:56] sets up the gifts and then he says well
[10:57] here's the most excellent way and then
[10:59] after that now he says now here's how
[11:01] here's the order follow charity make
[11:03] sure you're you're constantly following
[11:05] after the love of God and then after
[11:07] that then desire the gifts of the Spirit
[11:10] so make F make make sure you're seeking
[11:12] first the love of God and his
[11:15] righteousness Hallelujah and then desire
[11:18] spiritual gifts but rather that you may
[11:21] prophesy he said because uh in verse
[11:23] five he says that the church may receive
[11:26] edifying Hallelujah so Paul understood
[11:29] all gifts are important all gifts are
[11:31] are are from God but he said pray for
[11:34] the ones that will bless the most people
[11:37] hallelujah so we want we want to look at
[11:39] our lives like that we want to we want
[11:40] to be able to uh Express the love of God
[11:43] and we want to be a blessing to as many
[11:45] people as we possibly can
[11:48] Hallelujah now I want to read what
[11:50] scoffield said I want to now get to 1
[11:52] Corinthians
[11:54] 13 and Paul scoffield notes he says
[11:57] gifts are good but only only if
[11:59] ministered in
[12:01] love Hallelujah so gifts are gifts are
[12:04] no good uh unless they're ministered by
[12:08] the love of God
[12:11] hallelujah and then then he says
[12:13] benevolence so giving to the poor giving
[12:15] your body to be burned and giving
[12:17] clothes to the poor uh he said that's
[12:19] good but it's only good when it's done
[12:21] with
[12:22] love not not not just feeling well I I'm
[12:25] compelled I better give because I should
[12:27] be a cheerful Giver it's because I am a
[12:30] cheerful Giver because God has given so
[12:32] much to me I want to be able to be a
[12:34] blessing to other
[12:36] people hallelujah and then you know we
[12:38] get later in the chapter love is
[12:39] described and then love charity is
[12:42] better than our present incomplete
[12:44] knowledge and then Charities greater
[12:47] than even Faith and Hope hallelujah
[12:50] we're saved by grace through faith right
[12:52] and faith is the first attribute on the
[12:54] statute of perfect man we're saved by
[12:56] grace through faith Hallelujah but love
[12:59] is greater than that Hallelujah love is
[13:01] greater than Faith even Hallelujah and
[13:03] hope oh it's a blessing now uh 1
[13:06] Corinthians 13:2 if there's ever a verse
[13:10] for message people this is the verse and
[13:13] though I have to gift of Prophecy
[13:15] brother Rah had the gift of Prophecy and
[13:17] understand all Mysteries and all
[13:18] knowledge and though I have all Faith so
[13:20] that I could remove mountains now that's
[13:21] speaking of the third
[13:24] poll so so here though I understand all
[13:27] Mysteries there's revelation 10:7 can
[13:30] everybody see that the Bible said the
[13:32] mysteries of God are
[13:34] finished so there's Revelation 10:7 have
[13:37] all knowledge that kind of ties in with
[13:39] that and though I have all Fai that I
[13:40] can remove mountains uh what is the
[13:42] third F speaking of the
[13:44] word so we have revelation 10:7 we have
[13:47] I believe it's Mark uh 13 if I'm not
[13:49] mistaken if you say to this mountain and
[13:51] don't doubt in your heart it will move
[13:54] Hallelujah so we have revelation 10:7 we
[13:57] have the spoken word Hall there is the
[13:59] Original Seed amen we have the third
[14:02] pole if ever there's a verse for us this
[14:05] is the verse for us
[14:07] hallelujah he says though I can do all
[14:10] that though I have all that with if I
[14:13] don't have charity if I don't have the
[14:15] love of God I'm
[14:17] nothing in other words my life is a
[14:19] failure my life was in vain so let let's
[14:22] just break it down again so even though
[14:23] I understand all the Mysteries if I
[14:25] don't have love it does it didn't help
[14:26] me at all in my walk with God
[14:29] if I spoke to Every Mountain and God
[14:31] moved every mountain and every obstacle
[14:33] in my life and made my life so much
[14:36] easier and gave me every blessing that I
[14:38] desired if that if even that happened it
[14:40] didn't help me because love was not a
[14:43] part of
[14:44] it right because if love's not a part of
[14:46] it well then what's it about it's
[14:49] selfishness right because love is God's
[14:52] love for other people right so we must
[14:55] have the the understanding of the
[14:57] mystery and have love and want to share
[14:59] with other people we must we must have
[15:02] faith to speak to mountains and and
[15:04] obstacles in our life but it must be
[15:06] based upon God's love God's
[15:10] will so we can clearly see if there was
[15:12] ever a verse for bride of Christ
[15:15] Fellowship it's 1 Corinthians 13 verse2
[15:18] I would say also for the Bride of Jesus
[15:21] Christ Hallelujah know you hear
[15:23] different people talk about uh you know
[15:25] the time before the squeeze and people
[15:27] might speak that into existence and
[15:29] speak that into existence Church it
[15:31] would only do anybody any good if it's
[15:34] if it's done by
[15:35] love right if anything's to be spoken
[15:38] brother Ram said there may come a time
[15:39] when missing limbs will grow back well
[15:42] that God would only do that that would
[15:43] only profit the bride if it made us love
[15:46] God more not to magnify a certain
[15:49] personality or a certain church or
[15:51] something like that it would only
[15:53] benefit if it was the love of God God's
[15:55] love grew back a
[15:57] limb Hallelujah God's love did a miracle
[16:01] that was uh very much needed it would
[16:03] have to be the love of God and the
[16:05] people would all all rejoice and God
[16:08] would get all the glory because God does
[16:09] not share his glory with anyone
[16:13] hallelujah
[16:15] hallelujah now I believe we understand
[16:18] all the Bible defined Mysteries just for
[16:19] a brief moment I'm going to rehearse
[16:21] there's 12 uh the Bible says mystery 27
[16:24] times in the New Testament 12 of them
[16:26] are doctrines like the Kingdom of Heaven
[16:28] there's one body of of Jew and Gentile
[16:29] the Rapture mystery the church as the
[16:31] Bride of Jesus Christ Israel's blindness
[16:34] the will of God the Seven Stars and the
[16:36] Seven golden candlesticks the mystery of
[16:38] iniquity mystery of Babylon mystery of
[16:40] godliness mystery of the godhead and
[16:42] Christ in you the hope of Glory
[16:45] Hallelujah and brother Ram says he says
[16:47] these Mysteries uh from the unveiling of
[16:51] God he says uh the shikina glory talking
[16:54] about living in the holiest of
[16:56] holies he said the shikina glory the
[16:58] Pres of God and the holiest of holies it
[17:00] ripens the shoe bread that we Feast on
[17:04] and drive across the country for so
[17:07] brother baham is basically saying his
[17:09] ministry is preaching the living bread
[17:11] of God and the people the Mysteries that
[17:14] he's preach are causing people to be so
[17:17] fulfilled amen the Mysteries are such
[17:20] wonderful shoe bread he calls it that
[17:23] people are willing to drive across the
[17:25] country
[17:26] Hallelujah my wife and I were willing to
[17:28] drive with Lydia three hours one way six
[17:30] hours every Sunday for a year and a half
[17:32] we were willing to drive across the
[17:34] state for the Sho bread of the word of
[17:36] God hallelujah for a year and a half we
[17:39] did that that was a it seemed like I I
[17:41] can't remember doing it seems like so
[17:42] long ago and I I know my wife's probably
[17:44] different on that
[17:45] but but brother said this shoe bread
[17:48] that we're feasting on he said you're
[17:50] driving across the country for
[17:52] it he said it's the believer's food it's
[17:56] only for a Believer we're talking about
[17:58] the Mysteries here here remember the Sho
[18:00] bread was for the believer only the shoe
[18:02] bread seed what does it do that that
[18:05] shakina of Glory over the shoe bread it
[18:07] kept it from
[18:08] spoiling so brother says he's preaching
[18:10] the word of God that doesn't spoil it's
[18:13] the mysteries of God that's been
[18:16] finished this might be deep so maybe
[18:18] that's okay if I don't hear a lot of
[18:19] amens he said what's this sh kind of
[18:21] Glory today to break Beyond the Veil to
[18:24] see who God Is Standing before you to
[18:27] see who God is standing here before us
[18:29] the pillar of fire he's veiled in human
[18:32] flesh but what does the shikina what did
[18:35] it do he said the shikina seed the word
[18:38] that we're to live on in this day by
[18:40] these promises the shikina glory ripens
[18:43] that shoe bread brings it to pass makes
[18:46] it bread to the believer he said that
[18:49] laid in the pages of your Bible year
[18:52] after year the word for this
[18:55] age amen hallelujah how many believe
[18:58] that by God's grace so brother said you
[19:01] drive across the country for the bread
[19:03] it laid in seed form in the Bible but it
[19:06] could only be eaten it could only be
[19:07] fresh in this day when God's spirit is
[19:11] quickening that seed and bringing that
[19:13] bread to life and you and I can eat the
[19:15] bread it's fresh
[19:17] bread brother said but what's it to be
[19:20] done in the last days what is to reveal
[19:23] to bring forth what's Malachi 4 to do to
[19:26] turn back the people from that that
[19:28] stumbling block to break down the
[19:31] traditions and to reveal the bread with
[19:34] the shikina
[19:35] glory watch it ripen and produce just
[19:38] exactly what it said it would do oh my
[19:41] the shoe bread for this
[19:43] age Hallelujah so see that's what the
[19:46] message did for me it broke down the
[19:48] Traditions I had at the Assemblies of
[19:50] God the tradition was we all got to
[19:52] speak in tongues that was the tradition
[19:54] and if you don't speak in tongues you
[19:56] don't got all of it brother or sister
[19:59] but see the message broke that down
[20:02] because we just read it Paul says not
[20:04] everybody speaks with
[20:05] tongues well see that breaks down the
[20:07] whole the whole goal of every service is
[20:10] for somebody to speak in tongues or God
[20:12] to do America of a tongu interpretation
[20:14] that's the whole height of it right uh
[20:18] and and so the the message came to me
[20:20] the seed came to me and it broke down
[20:22] that tradition and now you see the whole
[20:25] goal of the service is to magnify Christ
[20:28] that Christ would be in us the hope of
[20:30] Glory Hallelujah that we would manifest
[20:33] Jesus Christ for this age Hallelujah and
[20:36] that our hearts would be turned back to
[20:39] the apostolic
[20:41] fathers so we would have faith can I
[20:43] just say like that so we would have
[20:44] faith like Peter James and John and Paul
[20:49] Hallelujah he says brother man goes on
[20:51] to say but now as Revelation 10 has
[20:53] promised all the mysteries of God that's
[20:56] been hidden in the pages down through
[20:58] them years would be ripened bring forth
[21:00] in the age of the seventh Angel's
[21:03] message is that right Hallelujah so
[21:07] brother Ram ties in Revelation 10 with
[21:10] with the the shoe bread in the Holy
[21:12] place that we come and we feed on that
[21:15] fresh bread he said it's finished and
[21:18] that that that seed bread has ripened
[21:20] into shoe bread and we partake of that
[21:22] and when do they partake on it on the
[21:24] Lord's Day
[21:26] Hallelujah and this is the Lord's Day
[21:28] Hallelujah
[21:29] brother Bram said but until you come in
[21:31] behind that Badger skin I wish I we
[21:33] probably need to get up a picture of the
[21:35] the the three the three courts of
[21:37] Moses's Tabernacle he said but until you
[21:40] come behind that Badger skin speaking of
[21:41] the Holy place until you get out of your
[21:43] old skin your old thoughts your old
[21:45] Creeds and come into the presence of God
[21:48] then the word becomes a living reality
[21:50] to you then you're awakened to the
[21:52] shakina of Glory then the Bible becomes
[21:54] a new book so see anyone that doesn't
[21:57] love their Bible they've not be they've
[21:59] not come into this sh kind of
[22:01] Glory anyone that doesn't love the fresh
[22:04] word of God you've not come into the sh
[22:06] kind of Glory Hallelujah what it's the
[22:08] same Bible right that's it's laate here
[22:10] year after year but in brother Ram's day
[22:12] it became ripe the Holy Spirit quickened
[22:14] the the the prophecy on the pages it
[22:16] became a new book people were willing to
[22:18] drive across the country to hear the
[22:20] Revelation the finished mystery of God
[22:23] it's our food it's what we live on it's
[22:25] what we Feast on and if we eat the new
[22:28] book we become a new creature
[22:33] amen he said then the Bible becomes a
[22:35] new book then Jesus Christ is the same
[22:38] yesterday today and forever you're
[22:40] living is his in his presence eating the
[22:42] shoe bread that's only provided that day
[22:44] for believers for priests only and he
[22:47] said we are priests royal priesthood a
[22:50] holy nation peculiar people giving
[22:53] spiritual sacrifices to God but you must
[22:56] come in everybody say must come in ready
[22:58] must coming you must come in to behind
[23:00] that Veil to see the veiled God and God
[23:03] is unveiled that's his word made
[23:07] manifest so Church we're not seeing God
[23:09] through a veil we'd say necessarily
[23:11] today like a Assemblies of God Veil or a
[23:16] presbyterian Veil or a Baptist Veil
[23:19] we're not seeing God through a veil
[23:20] we're seeing God as if we're priests in
[23:23] the Holy place and then we can actually
[23:25] go into the Hol of holies we can go into
[23:28] the presence of God and experience the
[23:30] glory of
[23:36] God in 1961 brother Ram said and the God
[23:39] had
[23:40] explained no matter how much you're
[23:42] right here's one thing we fail and Miss
[23:45] Brothers No matter how right I am and
[23:47] how scriptural I am and how much I know
[23:49] about God's Bible if I haven't got the
[23:52] spirit of God of love in my heart for
[23:54] the whole human race and all than I'm
[23:57] wrong to begin with
[24:00] so we need to have love for the human
[24:02] race if we don't love everyone right
[24:06] every country every language every skin
[24:08] color right every tongue if we don't
[24:10] love every Kindred tribe and tongue then
[24:12] we're wrong to begin with our purpose is
[24:15] wrong thank God we got a very diverse
[24:18] church here today Hallelujah the devil
[24:20] can't say you don't have a diverse
[24:21] church we have a very diverse church and
[24:23] we're thankful for that we love the
[24:25] whole human race Hallelujah he said Paul
[24:27] said in first Corinthians 13 though I I
[24:31] have all knowledge and understand all
[24:32] the Mysteries and have not charity I'm
[24:35] nothing he says uh so if I know all the
[24:40] mysteries of God and can unroll them and
[24:42] make them all hit together and I don't
[24:44] have love what good does it
[24:48] do Jesus said this will all men know
[24:51] that you are my disciples when you have
[24:53] love for another
[24:56] Hallelujah and brother look brother Ram
[24:58] says in 1961 and of course I know it's
[25:00] before the indictment of 63 where
[25:02] brother R indicted all the
[25:04] denominations he says when the
[25:05] assemblies have love for the Oneness and
[25:08] the Oneness has love for the
[25:11] assemblies see Church you want to have
[25:12] love for each and every
[25:15] person I think some of our some some of
[25:17] our relatives might even be Catholic
[25:19] still is that
[25:20] right some is your mom a Catholic
[25:22] brother I've been telling people that
[25:25] your dad okay that's I was telling
[25:27] somebody somebody was asking about you
[25:28] who was it somebody was asking me they
[25:30] said is that brother still coming that
[25:31] new brother with his siblings somebody
[25:33] was asking me about you yesterday buddy
[25:35] I said he's doing great by God's
[25:37] grace I thought of the how there's some
[25:39] Catholic connection Jose do you have
[25:40] family still in the Catholic
[25:47] church I like his sense of humor 9 yeah
[25:51] Nicaragua yeah
[25:53] absolutely so as message Believers we
[25:57] the message churches should love
[25:58] Catholics and I'm not talking about Sin
[26:01] we never love sin we love the
[26:04] Sinners right this will all men know
[26:07] that we're God's disciples jesus'
[26:09] disciples when we have love one for
[26:11] another Jose's probably sent prayer claw
[26:14] to Catholics I'd
[26:16] imagine i'
[26:19] imagine hallelujah amen that's what I
[26:22] thought but I didn't know couldn't
[26:24] remember he says but when you have love
[26:26] one for another be right or wrong is as
[26:29] long as the objective is wrong the
[26:31] motive is wrong rather then you're wrong
[26:33] to begin with isn't that right he says
[26:35] though I speak with tongue of men and
[26:36] angels have not chared on nothing yet
[26:38] because God is love we know that do you
[26:41] know that God is love
[26:45] today in this next quote brother bam
[26:47] says Revelation 10:7 is equal to Malachi
[26:50] 45 and 6 this is from the uniting time
[26:53] in sign July 18th is that Casa's
[26:56] birthday amen Hallelujah he says what a
[27:00] day what a time that we're living this
[27:01] great mystery of God being finished
[27:03] bringing the godhead showing what it is
[27:05] how these little isms went off and
[27:07] somebody made him this and somebody made
[27:08] him this and somebody made him that but
[27:10] the angel of the Lord come down and
[27:12] brought up all their isms and pulled out
[27:14] that truth out of it and presented it
[27:16] and there it is just as perfect as it
[27:18] can be no other way you could go I could
[27:20] say Amen to that I can't preach any
[27:22] other way to go than the godhead is one
[27:26] person there it is that's what he is see
[27:29] serpent seed all these different things
[27:31] that's been so mysteriously amongst the
[27:33] people what is it this is the sign to
[27:37] unite then he says in the next paragraph
[27:40] what did he say in Malachi 4 would
[27:42] restore restore back the original
[27:44] Pentecostal Faith back to the people
[27:46] with the same Pentecostal message the
[27:48] same Pentecostal sign the same
[27:50] Pentecostal evidence the same God the
[27:53] same power the same teaching everything
[27:55] exactly with the Vindication of the same
[27:57] Pillar of Fire that struck Paul down on
[27:59] the road down to Damascus amongst us
[28:01] today doing the same things he did in
[28:04] that day uniting
[28:08] Hallelujah okay so there he he puts all
[28:11] the Mysteries being finished he even
[28:12] puts serpent seed in there with the
[28:14] godhead now I put serpent seed in the
[28:16] mystery of iniquity because that's how
[28:17] iniquity came in the world through lust
[28:19] the Bible says where was the first lust
[28:21] Genesis chapter 3 right she lusted uh
[28:25] after the fruit right now the next quote
[28:28] qu brother says marriage and divorce
[28:29] needs explained and because this is the
[28:32] hour of Revelation 10:7 so brother Ram
[28:34] even places marriage and divorce as part
[28:36] of Revelation 10:7 I agree I believe
[28:39] marriage and divorce is a part of the
[28:41] revelation of the church as the bride
[28:43] because it's marriage and divorce it's
[28:45] our marriage with Christ Christ won't
[28:47] divorce US amen he's only he only
[28:49] divorced Israel but then he's going to
[28:51] bring her back Hallelujah he's going to
[28:53] let her back into the Covenant amen
[28:56] Third Exodus brother Ram says
[28:59] he said before I leave Lord willing I
[29:01] like to take the scripture and don't
[29:02] tape it now look what he says this this
[29:04] is almost two years before he preach it
[29:06] don't tape it if they do don't sell the
[29:08] tape don't let it out I want to explain
[29:10] the real truth of marriage and divorce
[29:11] it's a question and this is the last
[29:13] hours that when all the mysteries of God
[29:16] should be
[29:17] finished and yesterday coming up across
[29:19] the mountains about daylight the Holy
[29:21] Spirit seem to say to me take that and
[29:23] lay it away I don't know why but the
[29:26] real truth of marriage and divorce see
[29:28] what the Lord said about this marriage
[29:29] and divorce it's more sacred than people
[29:32] think it
[29:33] is and it'll blend right in with the
[29:35] serpent seed Hallelujah does just the
[29:38] same thing just moving right on then
[29:41] that's the Mysteries remember in the
[29:42] days of the seventh angel all the
[29:45] mystery of God should be finished those
[29:47] unknown things that the Lord would wind
[29:50] up
[29:51] Hallelujah so it's like church at the
[29:53] fourth Church age it's like uh there was
[29:55] all these Springs in here right uh and
[29:57] they just they J all kind of sprung out
[29:59] and all the Springs BR broke forth but
[30:02] brother R said his ministry was to take
[30:03] all these Springs and place them back in
[30:05] here tie them back together make
[30:07] everything on God's clock tick just
[30:09] perfectly Hallelujah that's what God is
[30:12] doing he's winding it back up he's
[30:14] putting everything back together so it
[30:16] all fits so there's no confusion God is
[30:18] not the author of confusion Hallelujah
[30:21] he's helping us understand the word in
[30:24] the next quote brother man says all the
[30:25] Mysteries are supposed to be finished
[30:27] including marriage and divorce this is a
[30:28] man running from the presence of
[30:30] God and about that marriage and divorce
[30:33] I wanted to speak on it ever since the
[30:34] time of those Seven Seals you know all
[30:36] the Mysteries was supposed to be made
[30:38] known in them opening them Seven Seals
[30:40] All The Mysteries of the
[30:42] Bible Hallelujah he said and I thought
[30:44] I'd better at least put it on tape
[30:46] whether if something would happen to me
[30:48] then the church might wonder wonder what
[30:50] we had on his mind what would he say
[30:52] aren't you glad the Lord allowed him to
[30:53] do that
[30:56] Hallelujah and all those subject that
[30:59] seems to be so hard he said I think by
[31:02] the Lord's help I'm going to try to
[31:03] bring them to you and then if something
[31:05] happens and if I happen to go before he
[31:08] comes you'll have it on record
[31:12] then in the next quote brother said
[31:14] finishing the mysteries of God is the
[31:16] father's business how many remember the
[31:18] father's business
[31:19] scripture Jesus was 12 years old in the
[31:21] synagogue and Mary and Joseph are like
[31:24] where is this where's this boy he he
[31:26] close to a man by that point where is
[31:28] this boy and they found him uh in the
[31:30] temple correcting the the elders and the
[31:32] priest and he said uh you know why
[31:35] aren't you with your father and he says
[31:36] he said I must be about my father's
[31:39] business so Jesus in the temple bringing
[31:42] the word bringing truth that was the
[31:45] father's business and brother said
[31:47] Revelation 10:7 is the father's
[31:51] business he said then why he said what
[31:53] is it now we must be about the father's
[31:55] business the wheat would cry back the
[31:58] grain yes sir what must it do vindicate
[32:00] Malachi 4 vindicate Luke 17:30 vindicate
[32:04] Hebrews 138 vindicate St John 14:12 The
[32:07] Works that I do shall you do also
[32:10] vindicate all of his words so he names
[32:12] those four and then he says all the
[32:14] word vindicate he said vindicate
[32:17] Revelations the 10th chapter of the
[32:19] opening of The Seven Seals and the
[32:21] mysteries of God even to the serpent
[32:23] seed and all would be manifested
[32:26] marriage and divorce and all these other
[32:28] Mysteries that's been hid under the
[32:29] pillars for all these years from the
[32:31] theologians and so forth but now it's
[32:34] the hour that's the father's business
[32:36] Church don't you know there's so many
[32:38] churches around the world today and it's
[32:40] like it's like this they don't
[32:42] understand marriage and divorce they
[32:43] don't un they don't understand serpent
[32:45] SE that's why they let them marry two
[32:46] three times but Church we're so blessed
[32:48] God has come and taking the veil off
[32:50] Hallelujah and now we see the truth
[32:53] hallelujah and now we know what God
[32:55] wants us to do Hallelujah the book's a
[32:58] new book imagine this is what you
[33:00] thought of the book beforehand this is
[33:01] what you saw about the book you didn't
[33:03] see it but now that the God has sent a
[33:05] prophet to finish the mysteries of God
[33:07] now you see the book
[33:09] Hallelujah no wonder it's a brand new
[33:11] book Hallelujah before that you just
[33:13] believe whatever the pastor whatever the
[33:15] Theologian whatever the Evangelist said
[33:17] whatever the doctor had said before that
[33:19] we just believed all that but now God is
[33:21] let us go behind the veil Hallelujah and
[33:23] now we're feeding on the word of God
[33:25] hallelujah
[33:30] he says but that's the father's business
[33:33] so Revelation 10:7 is the father's
[33:35] business think they would receive it
[33:38] they want to be dignified and say our
[33:39] denomination don't teach us that but the
[33:42] Bible does that's right
[33:47] Hallelujah in the next quote brother
[33:49] says marriage and divorce and every
[33:51] hidden Mystery will be revealed and he
[33:53] says this in marriage and divorce
[33:56] Revelation the 10th chapter Jesus
[33:58] Promised it that all of these hidden
[33:59] mysteries on marriage and divorce all
[34:01] these other Hidden Mysteries that's been
[34:03] would be revealed in the end time and
[34:05] you remember the voice said go to Tucson
[34:08] remember the Mystic light in the sky
[34:09] speaking of uh the cloud from Arizona
[34:12] February 28th
[34:13] 1963 the seventh angel standing there
[34:16] come back and the opening of The Seven
[34:18] Seals watch what's taking place that is
[34:23] true next quote the TR the true mystery
[34:27] revealed with thus sayith the Lord
[34:29] Easter seal
[34:30] 1965 and that's what I'm in Arizona for
[34:33] now there's many people sitting here
[34:35] stood here right here in Phoenix and
[34:37] heard me tell you from this platform
[34:39] thus sayith the Lord how many remembers
[34:41] it now go something is fixing to happen
[34:44] I shared that quote with you a few weeks
[34:45] ago brother r at the beginning of 1963
[34:47] said I come here in the name of the Lord
[34:49] anybody remember that quote he said I'm
[34:50] here in the name of the Lord to fulfill
[34:51] a vision that I
[34:53] had brother R said I saw seven angels
[34:56] come didn't life magaz packet as the fog
[34:59] of it floated across here 27 mil high
[35:02] and 30 Mi across and then he names
[35:04] brothers that were there those Brothers
[35:06] stood right there when them seven angels
[35:08] appeared right there on the hill it
[35:09] shook the hills for miles around like
[35:11] that there stood seven angels and
[35:13] throwed a sword in your hand and said go
[35:16] home and open these Seven Seals that are
[35:18] given and here they are the true mystery
[35:21] of marriage and divorce and the serpent
[35:23] seed and all these things that's been
[35:24] fussed about it's thus saith the Lord
[35:29] what a blessing we've received church
[35:31] sometimes I wish we would just pinch
[35:32] ourselves in real life realize we've got
[35:34] thus sayi the Lord we're not an regular
[35:36] Church we're not we're not part of the
[35:38] Harlot system we've got the word of the
[35:41] Lord th we have thus saith the Lord
[35:45] hallelujah I've been listening to
[35:46] Ezekiel I think I'm in chapter 16 yeah I
[35:49] never I was I didn't get to finish
[35:50] chapter 16 yesterday and it's amazing
[35:52] God tells Ezekiel do this thus sayith
[35:55] the Lord go tell them thus sayith the
[35:56] Lord the word the Lord came to thus
[35:57] sayith the lord it's thus sayith the
[35:59] Lord constantly and that's exactly how
[36:01] God dealt with brother random gave him
[36:02] thus sayith the Lord so we have thus
[36:04] sayith the Lord the Seven Seals are open
[36:06] marriage and divorce is part of that a
[36:08] serpent seed in other words all the
[36:10] mysteries of God should be finished
[36:14] Hallelujah and then he goes on to saying
[36:16] Easter now here's the thing I like I
[36:17] remember preaching this at uh brother
[36:19] Jim shemakes church back in
[36:21] Pennsylvania and this was such a help to
[36:23] me what is it he's talking about
[36:25] Revelation 10:7 serpent seed marriage
[36:27] and divorce Seven Seals what is it now I
[36:29] hope somebody can say Amen to this what
[36:31] is it it's the quickening power coming
[36:34] to the church making her
[36:37] ready this hour that we're approaching
[36:39] quickening
[36:41] power what is the Seven Seals What is
[36:43] marriage and divorce what is serpent
[36:45] seed it's quickening power to get us
[36:48] ready for the Rapture Hallelujah think
[36:50] about that marriage and divorce if
[36:52] people are adulterers if they stay in
[36:54] adultery they're not going in the
[36:56] Rapture so they need the quickening

[38:46] power for the
[38:47] Rapture I guess there's one I think it
[38:49] was
[38:50] uh was it the Seventh Day Adventist they
[38:54] actually believe uh their Charles they
[38:56] believe Charles T's Russell was
[38:57] Revelation

[40:16] God himself that's open those seven
[40:19] mysteries of what the church was how it

[41:29] hallelujah how am I doing on time oh
[41:31] really good on time
[41:33] Hallelujah now let's go back to the
[41:35] scripture here 1 Corinthians
[41:43] 13:4 can you try one more time uh Casa
[41:47] oh yeah maybe I plugged it in the wrong
[41:49] side here can you try one more time to
[41:50] put this up here I just thought of that
[41:53] there's a keyboard attachment and maybe
[41:55] I think the keyboard only supports
[41:56] charging it doesn't to support other
[41:57] devices well there we go hallelujah
[42:00] praise the
[42:01] Lord so you want to go back and see all
[42:03] those quotes I got lots of quotes from
[42:04] Brother B quickening
[42:07] power now let's go back and now let's
[42:11] see
[42:12] here let's examine our lives do we have
[42:14] the love of God in our midst Hallelujah
[42:17] what's the most valuable thing brother
[42:18] Jesse is it is it Miracles is it moving
[42:21] Every Mountain is it understanding your
[42:24] book The 12 new test Mysteries no
[42:28] no that that's not even the most
[42:29] important thing the most important thing
[42:31] is
[42:34] Charity charity suffereth
[42:39] long so charity doesn't lose heart oh wo
[42:42] is me my life is so
[42:45] hard I got it I got it bad I don't even
[42:48] know if God loves me does God care for
[42:50] me the love of God doesn't let you do
[42:54] that too
[42:55] long we're all human
[42:58] but charity is able to suffer a long
[43:01] time it's able to keep the heart keep
[43:03] the heart
[43:04] encouraged a long
[43:07] time
[43:08] see bravely charity is brave in enduring
[43:13] misfortunes and troubles well if this is
[43:15] happening that's fine I'm going to be
[43:17] brave amongst this I'm going to get
[43:19] through this God will bring me through
[43:20] it you've heard the saying if God
[43:23] brought me to it God will bring me
[43:24] through it
[43:25] Hallelujah that's a love of
[43:28] God hallelujah everybody see
[43:30] that this is this is the superior
[43:35] way this is superior than all the gifts
[43:37] thank God for all the gifts thank God
[43:40] for all the Miracles that we've seen
[43:41] thank God for healing Robbie Davis and
[43:44] Carolyn out there and and and uh nine
[43:46] pages of of the brother from Illinois
[43:49] brother Phil Carlson thank God for nine
[43:51] pages of symptoms vanished in a prayer
[43:53] in a moment hallelujah thank God for
[43:55] that but love Superior
[43:58] Hallelujah so this is this takes a
[44:01] greater expression of God's love here a
[44:03] greater expression of God's spirit to be
[44:06] patient so so love is patient and
[44:08] bearing the offenses and injuries of
[44:10] others to be mild and slow to
[44:13] punish Hallelujah is that right charity
[44:17] suffers a long time now your definition
[44:20] of long is not the same as
[44:24] God's a week and a half might seem like
[44:27] a long time to you a month might seem
[44:29] like a long time to you a year might
[44:31] seem like a long time to you but God
[44:33] determines how long it
[44:36] is love will be brave and endure the
[44:41] misfortunes in my life and the troubles
[44:43] that I go
[44:46] through and love is also kind which
[44:49] means mild not harsh mild now remember
[44:52] now Church remember you got to balance
[44:53] this all out was Jesus uh harsh or mild
[44:56] when he took the rope and scourged out
[44:57] the money chamber was he was he Meek or
[45:00] he was very
[45:01] harsh right but what did he do he he
[45:04] gave them many mild warnings did he not
[45:07] he preached to them he told them you
[45:08] know the Pharisees that they love the
[45:09] greetings in the marketplace don't be
[45:11] like them you know he gave them many
[45:13] mild warnings but there comes a time for
[45:15] the Church of God the house of God to be
[45:18] purged so we got to balance this this
[45:21] means for the M most of the time charity
[45:23] is kind it's mild it doesn't Envy it
[45:27] doesn't boil up with Envy wasn't it Nate
[45:30] no it was Eden that one of the the bible
[45:31] study on Envy
[45:34] right yeah we did that was it what's the
[45:36] another name for it jealousy yeah that's
[45:38] right jealousy so charity doesn't get
[45:41] jealous boil up with Envy that's not the
[45:43] love of God the love of God rejoices
[45:46] with those who Rejoice
[45:49] Hallelujah charity doesn't vaunteth
[45:51] itself up it's not puffed up I got got
[45:53] to go to the next slide vaunteth means
[45:55] to boast on oneself it doesn't display
[45:57] itself in other words it displays
[46:00] Christ it doesn't make embellishments
[46:03] and extol ones excessively so the love
[46:07] of God is going to deflect attention off
[46:09] of you you and I must deflect the
[46:11] attention off of us and we must put all
[46:13] the attention on
[46:15] Christ is that the love of God that's
[46:18] the love of God God's love will always
[46:20] push the attention onto
[46:23] Christ love of God doesn't extol magn
[46:26] magnify
[46:28] oneself the love of God is Not puffed up
[46:32] it does not inflate or blow up in other
[46:34] words Pride to be
[46:37] proud to Bear oneself lofly to cause to
[46:41] swell up like when I was growing up uh
[46:42] they would say oh you got a you got a
[46:44] swollen head what they meant was you
[46:46] thought oh you're so smart you know
[46:48] you're you're the you're greater than
[46:49] everybody else right that's an
[46:51] expression that's what the Bible says
[46:53] not puffed
[46:55] up the love of God doesn't make us proud
[46:58] the love of God makes us
[47:03] humble does not behave itself unseemly
[47:07] which is
[47:08] improper not fittingly so the love of
[47:11] God makes you fit in it doesn't do
[47:13] something that's out of the cater
[47:15] selfish or sinful it makes you fit in to
[47:17] the body of
[47:20] Christ the love love of God the charity
[47:24] seeketh not her own it doesn't demand
[47:25] its way it doesn't doesn't crave its own
[47:28] way the love of God wants God's
[47:31] way
[47:34] Hallelujah God's love is not easily
[47:37] provoked in other words you don't get
[47:39] irritated very quickly it takes a lot to
[47:42] irritate
[47:45] you we're digging really down deep into
[47:47] your soul
[47:49] today
[47:51] Hallelujah the love of God is not easily
[47:53] provoked to anger the love of God
[47:56] doesn't do burn with
[47:58] anger right with provoked anger with
[48:00] with selfish
[48:02] anger and I love this the love of God
[48:04] doesn't think any evil and it doesn't
[48:07] assume the worst about someone it
[48:10] assumes the best about people that's the
[48:12] love of God remember all this church
[48:15] remember all this is greater than if
[48:17] somebody stood here and said thus sayith
[48:18] the Lord tomorrow at 3 p p.m there's
[48:20] going to come a fire and burn this
[48:21] person's house in the church tell them
[48:23] to get out by at least 2 2 p.m. thus
[48:25] sayi the lord it's going to come to pass
[48:26] and how we would Rejoice if that
[48:28] happened but even greater than that is
[48:31] if we can have love one for another not
[48:34] exalt
[48:35] ourselves not be envious not be jealous
[48:38] but Express the love of God to each one
[48:40] of us
[48:43] hallelujah this is the more excellent
[48:45] way this is the superior way to live our
[48:49] lives
[48:55] Hallelujah God's love does not rejoice
[48:57] in iniquity that means Injustice or
[49:01] unrighteousness you I thought it was
[49:02] funny you know uh the the Democrat Party
[49:06] was they called themselves the campaign
[49:07] of
[49:09] joy and remember outside of their uh
[49:12] convention they had they had a van set
[49:15] up to do
[49:16] abortions and they called it the
[49:18] campaign of
[49:20] Joy it was the campaign of
[49:22] iniquity Injustice ending babies lives
[49:26] before they can can even speak but they
[49:29] but they rejoice in that right that's
[49:32] just one example and I know the
[49:33] Republicans got just as many right you
[49:35] can find just as many but just an
[49:38] example God's love does not rejoice in
[49:41] Injustice or any
[49:44] unrighteousness so friends let's
[49:46] remember how many know that sometimes
[49:48] you you sin every day now notice I said
[49:50] sometimes can't preach on that again
[49:52] there and I said possible there it's
[49:54] possible you could have a day I felt
[49:55] like I've had a couple days right in sin
[49:57] by God's
[49:59] grace but see we we want to rejoice in
[50:02] the truth we don't rejoice in iniquity
[50:05] we rejoice in the
[50:08] truth hallelujah we don't get happy
[50:10] about our sins if we're so anytime we
[50:13] we've sinned throughout the day and we
[50:14] haven't confessed it we have to know
[50:16] God's love does not rejoice in that
[50:19] God's love is trying to lead us to
[50:21] repent of our
[50:22] sins
[50:24] Hallelujah here we go verse seven
[50:28] charity Bears all things so the love of
[50:31] God can cover over any
[50:35] sin the love of God can keep Silence
[50:37] about any sin the love of God can hide
[50:41] or conceal any sin done to us that's the
[50:45] love of
[50:46] God it Bears all things it can bear it
[50:51] think about that Jesus bore the cross
[50:53] right now the whole time he was bearing
[50:54] the cross was he saying oh you Roman
[50:56] Soldier shame on you look what you made
[50:58] me go through was he doing that so we
[51:00] shouldn't
[51:02] either we should say father what father
[51:04] forgive them they don't know what
[51:06] they're doing if anybody ever bore
[51:09] everything it was Christ bore all of our
[51:13] sins all of our iniquities he bore them
[51:16] all so Paul says love should help us to
[51:19] Bear the iniquities of others now don't
[51:20] you think church when they read this at
[51:22] at the Corinthian Church don't you think
[51:23] that burned the height of those guys
[51:25] that were suing each other
[51:27] because they were going to the judge
[51:28] saying he stole this you know he
[51:30] promised me to pay back $10,000 I I want
[51:32] my $10,000 back he swindled me in this
[51:36] deal and I never got it
[51:37] back and I wonder what those guys faces
[51:40] were no they probably they probably the
[51:41] best seats they were all probably
[51:42] sitting right up front the Bible said
[51:45] right with their their gold on and and
[51:47] their jewels and I wonder if if uh uh if
[51:51] Christmas didn't look over and say it
[51:53] Bears all things and won't sue your
[51:56] brother or sister I wonder if he just
[51:58] wouldn't make eye contact with
[52:00] him Bears all
[52:02] things won't take people to
[52:06] court God's love bears all
[52:08] things you know what every every uh week
[52:11] I drive past a house there in
[52:12] doown privac we're coming up a hill and
[52:16] this guy bless his heart I'm not crit
[52:19] I'm not trying to criticize he's got two
[52:20] signs in his yard and this I'll just say
[52:22] John Doe owes me
[52:25] $684 he drive a little further and he
[52:27] says John Doe owes me $ 6,840 some he
[52:31] just put it out there for everybody to
[52:32] see he really wants his money back he's
[52:35] will to get out his paintbrush and paint
[52:37] that and put it put it in there but see
[52:39] the love of God would hide hide that the
[52:42] love of God would pay I'm sorry would
[52:44] pray about
[52:45] that
[52:48] Hallelujah God's love believes all
[52:51] things now of course that's the word
[52:53] right doesn't believe lies it believes
[52:55] all the word
[52:57] Hallelujah and that's where hope so see
[52:59] now we can see hope believing all things
[53:01] is is Faith right I'm sorry hope it's
[53:03] not Faith Hope believing all things is
[53:05] having faith so now we can see having
[53:07] faith is part of the love of God but the
[53:09] love of God is all encompassing the love
[53:12] of God is the greatest attribute of God
[53:15] hallelujah faith is part of love right
[53:18] here because because love believes all
[53:20] the word of God
[53:22] Amen and love even hopes all things it
[53:25] hopes in the love of God it hopes in the
[53:27] plan of God it hopes in the the the
[53:29] purpose of God it hopes in in the
[53:31] direction of God the future God has for
[53:33] us God's love hopes in that
[53:36] Hallelujah we can be hopeful this
[53:38] morning praise God
[53:40] hallelujah because the love of God is in
[53:42] our hearts
[53:44] Hallelujah and God's love can endure all
[53:48] things Hallelujah so no matter what

[54:06] the love of God and I'm not going to I'm
[54:09] not going to be tempted by their dirty
[54:10] jokes and somebody said a customer right
[54:12] in front of me I just put my head down I
[54:15] try to keep the conversation on God they
[54:17] didn't say anything you know he's come
[54:19] up to my face a couple times that that
[54:21] other Barber and he's tried to say

[54:58] mom I told him the Miracles we've seen
[54:59] in our church I told him these Miracles
[55:01] he just goes on cutting hair right so
[55:03] Miracles isn't enough to move right
[55:05] sometimes a miracle can cause somebody
[55:06] to believe but we know the real thing is
[55:09] the love of God hallelujah God's love
[55:12] the gospel the goodness of God leads
[55:14] people to repent
[55:16] Hallelujah that's right God's love hopes

[55:58] which one did I miss L you're my second
[56:00] brain which one did I

[56:04] doesn't matter I'm to to je I can always
[56:06] remember eight but not nine Satan has a
[56:09] he can copycat that now notice Satan
[56:12] can't have that everybody understand
[56:13] that Satan doesn't have the gifts of God
[56:16] but he can try to impersonate
[56:19] it there's a quote where brother R says
[56:21] Satan can give out those gifts but you
[56:24] understand what brother R is saying
[56:25] Satan can't give out gifts God gave you
[56:27] the gifts what Satan is doing he's
[56:29] impersonating
[56:31] gifts right that's what he's doing Satan
[56:34] can impersonate every one of those gifts
[56:38] Hallelujah he can try to prophesy he can
[56:41] try to predict that try to speak that
[56:43] try to we i' I've seen people uh pretend
[56:45] to speak in tongues my whole life
[56:47] growing
[56:48] up because some of them weren't genuine
[56:50] you can tell they're not genuine other
[56:51] ones may might have been genuine because
[56:53] God comes along and backs it up whether
[56:55] it's right or wrong
[56:57] Hallelujah see but he can't
[57:01] love God is love that's right see Satan
[57:06] can't
[57:10] love it's
[57:13] impossible he's the Fallen Angel right
[57:17] he he's the wicked one he's that old
[57:20] dragon that old serpent the devil he
[57:23] cannot love he looks at 1 Corinthians 3
[57:26] and he says I know nothing about that
[57:28] God help us to know something about 1
[57:30] Corinthians 13 amen if anybody should
[57:33] know something about First Corinthians
[57:34] 13 it should be a real blood bought
[57:37] Blood Washed Holy Ghost filled Church of
[57:40] the Living God hallelujah
[57:44] amen Satan cannot express these
[57:48] attributes of God's
[57:52] love
[57:54] Hallelujah so Satan cannot suffer
[57:57] long Satan runs out of
[58:02] suffering Hallelujah everybody with
[58:05] me he runs out because I can't suffer no
[58:08] more I've got to do this I've got to say
[58:10] that I've got to go do that I got to get
[58:12] my
[58:13] revenge right and Satan certainly isn't
[58:19] kind
[58:20] right he slandered Jesus he Slanders all
[58:23] the uh prophets he slandered he's he's
[58:25] he's accuser of the Brethren so Satan's
[58:29] main his main title there in in
[58:32] Revelation is dragon serpent that old
[58:35] devil and he's called the accuser of the
[58:39] Brethren he's not
[58:41] kind and Satan will cause you to Envy
[58:45] Satan envies he wants to be Lord he said
[58:48] I I'll be like the most high I'll make
[58:49] myself greater than God I'll send to the
[58:52] heights of the heaven he eny God I'll be
[58:55] like God I'll receive worship God said
[58:58] no you
[59:00] won't that's selfish that's not vot
[59:03] motivated by the love that I offered you
[59:06] God originally created him to express
[59:08] the love of God and we don't know how
[59:10] many thousands or millions or billions
[59:12] of years Satan was faithful in his
[59:13] position as the the anointed cherub in
[59:15] heaven but at some point he got this uh
[59:18] Envy in his heart he's lifted up because
[59:21] of his Beauty lifted up because of his
[59:23] pride and then from that moment on Satan
[59:25] could no longer
[59:29] love Satan will always vaunt others up
[59:34] and make themselves prideful I'm right I
[59:37] know more I know all about
[59:40] it they need to come to me I they need
[59:42] to ask me I'm the one that's got knows
[59:45] it all right Satan will do that but love
[59:48] doesn't do
[59:49] that
[59:50] Hallelujah Satan will always puff people
[59:53] up to make themselves great greater than
[59:56] what they really
[59:58] are Satan will always do something that
[1:00:01] is unseemly it's not the right time not
[1:00:04] the right season it's not received by
[1:00:06] the body of Christ
[1:00:09] Hallelujah and Satan is always seeking
[1:00:12] his own his own interest to steal kill
[1:00:17] and
[1:00:19] destroy he can't love he can't put his
[1:00:22] interest on the back burner he always
[1:00:24] does what he wants
[1:00:27] didn't Jesus say uh Satan uh doesn't he
[1:00:31] doesn't crave the things of God I'm
[1:00:33] saying the wrong word but he told that
[1:00:34] with Peter Jesus told that with Peter
[1:00:38] Hallelujah he wants his own way and and
[1:00:40] of course Satan thinks all
[1:00:42] evil and Satan tries to inject our
[1:00:45] thoughts with evil thoughts about others
[1:00:48] that's Satan's
[1:00:49] job but again friends the love of God
[1:00:52] does none of this Hallelujah amen if
[1:00:57] anybody needs that it's us hallelujah
[1:00:59] we're we're we're people that believe
[1:01:00] the mystery of God the mystery of God is
[1:01:02] finished
[1:01:03] hallelujah we're people some of us some
[1:01:05] of us have spoken to mountains and
[1:01:07] they've
[1:01:09] moved Hallelujah and if not get ready if
[1:01:12] it's your gift it's going to happen
[1:01:13] Hallelujah you just stay
[1:01:15] consecrated that's right some of us have
[1:01:19] had all
[1:01:20] Faith some of us have given to the poor
[1:01:22] more than what maybe we should have but
[1:01:25] God sees all it Hallelujah as long it's
[1:01:27] done in love God will bless that
[1:01:29] Hallelujah but Satan's trying to
[1:01:31] impersonate that and then he does the
[1:01:35] opposite Satan will not rejo I'm sorry
[1:01:37] Satan will rejoice in
[1:01:41] iniquity to try to make people feel
[1:01:43] liberated when they
[1:01:45] sin well I've got the I've got the right
[1:01:47] I've got the Liberty to do this that's
[1:01:49] Satan if it goes against God's
[1:01:52] word Satan does not rejoice in the truth
[1:01:55] s fights the truth with all that he has
[1:01:58] he will try to fight the truth of God's
[1:02:00] word
[1:02:02] hallelujah he wants to deceive people
[1:02:05] with lies he's the father of
[1:02:08] lies and Satan will cannot Bear all
[1:02:11] things right kind kind of goes along
[1:02:12] with that first one he can't suffer long
[1:02:14] he can't bear it he can't cover over
[1:02:16] he's got to make everybody's faults
[1:02:18] known right he's accused of the Brethren
[1:02:22] think about that he's doing that in
[1:02:23] heaven that's what cam was mentioning
[1:02:24] don't you know that uh cam was hitting
[1:02:26] that I don't know if we ever got to it
[1:02:28] but the heavens in one way are
[1:02:29] spiritually dirty the Bible says that
[1:02:32] because demons are allowed to go in the
[1:02:34] in in heaven but the Bible said God is
[1:02:36] going to purge all of it when all those
[1:02:38] demons are cussed in Lake of Fire God
[1:02:40] creates a new Heaven and a new Earth
[1:02:43] Hallelujah that's right that's what the
[1:02:45] book of Hebrews says cam mentioned it
[1:02:47] there I uh and I stepped out a couple
[1:02:50] times maybe he did preach it but even
[1:02:52] the heavens in one way are defiled
[1:02:54] because there's demon powers coming up
[1:02:56] to accuse you and I thank God we have a
[1:02:59] high priest thank God we have an
[1:03:01] advocate who ever lives to make
[1:03:02] intercession
[1:03:04] Hallelujah glory to
[1:03:07] God so Satan won't allow people to
[1:03:09] believe all things oh just God will
[1:03:12] never forgive me God will never provide
[1:03:14] for me uh God will never uh God will
[1:03:17] never save my loved ones right but God
[1:03:21] but it's got to be God's will right we
[1:03:22] got to seek God for his will Satan won't
[1:03:25] believe all things he won't hope for all
[1:03:27] things oh my life is just my life is
[1:03:30] worthless no it's
[1:03:32] not God has he promised you if he
[1:03:34] promised Israel hope for a
[1:03:37] future and an expected end and good
[1:03:41] things if God provided that for Israel
[1:03:44] doesn't he provide the same for the
[1:03:45] Bride of Jesus
[1:03:47] Christ Satan won't hope for all things
[1:03:50] he won't let people hope for all things
[1:03:52] Satan will not let people endure all
[1:03:54] things he'll try to get them to
[1:03:56] blaspheme but try to get them to give
[1:03:59] up and then Satan won't let people have
[1:04:03] love that never
[1:04:05] fails again that goes very similar with
[1:04:08] can endure all
[1:04:09] things Satan's lives will fail people
[1:04:13] hallelujah but God's love never
[1:04:16] fails God's love cannot fail Satan
[1:04:20] cannot
[1:04:22] love
[1:04:24] Hallelujah charity never
[1:04:27] faileth aren't you glad God's love is
[1:04:30] still strong for you aren't you glad
[1:04:32] something is holding you Hallelujah
[1:04:34] God's love is holding me it never fails
[1:04:36] Hallelujah but whether there be
[1:04:38] prophecies they shall fail now that
[1:04:41] doesn't mean like they're going to fail
[1:04:43] as far as like true prophecies it just
[1:04:44] means they'll be fulfilled and then
[1:04:46] they're no longer right we won't need
[1:04:47] prophecies at some point whether there
[1:04:50] be tongues they shall cease we won't
[1:04:51] have to speak in tongues in heaven
[1:04:53] because we already have the tongues we
[1:04:54] need Hallelujah there there will be a
[1:04:56] universal Heavenly language
[1:04:58] Hallelujah whether there be knowledge it
[1:05:00] shall pass away well the Bible tells us
[1:05:02] to grow in knowledge grow in grace of
[1:05:04] God
[1:05:05] hallelujah but you know some at some
[1:05:07] point you know we won't need more
[1:05:09] knowledge on this Earth because we won't
[1:05:10] need to know all things God will make
[1:05:12] known all things to
[1:05:14] us now I like what Paul says here for we
[1:05:16] know in part right now Paul says we know
[1:05:19] imp part and we prophesy in
[1:05:22] part but when that which is perfect is
[1:05:25] come
[1:05:26] then that which is in part shall be done
[1:05:29] away with notice he says the perfect
[1:05:31] hasn't come
[1:05:32] yet right that we're waiting on the
[1:05:35] perfect to come
[1:05:37] Hallelujah but then that when it's come
[1:05:40] then then that which is in part the
[1:05:42] human element the time element is done
[1:05:44] away
[1:05:45] with when that which is complete comes
[1:05:49] Hallelujah are you looking forward to
[1:05:51] the coming of the Lord when he I'll say
[1:05:53] like that when he which is perfect shall
[1:05:55] come that which is in part shall be done
[1:05:57] away
[1:05:58] with
[1:06:00] Hallelujah verse 11 when I was a child I
[1:06:03] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:06:06] I thought as a child but when I became a
[1:06:09] man I put away childish things
[1:06:13] Hallelujah and again like that example
[1:06:15] speaking in tongues is the evidence
[1:06:17] that's a childish thing I had to move
[1:06:19] away from that and put that away
[1:06:22] Hallelujah all these traditions of man
[1:06:24] from your former churches they got to be
[1:06:26] put away that's childish real maturity
[1:06:29] is manifesting the love of
[1:06:32] God it's it's believing all things it's
[1:06:35] hoping all things it's enduring all
[1:06:38] things it's suffering long it's being
[1:06:40] faithful it's trusting in God it's
[1:06:43] having God's love anchor your soul to
[1:06:46] God's word
[1:06:47] hallelujah I've always told this to
[1:06:49] Malachi is our manto man talks but when
[1:06:51] I became a child I'm sorry when when I
[1:06:53] became a man I put away video games
[1:06:55] right
[1:06:56] I put him away don't do that
[1:06:58] anymore right put away all these sports
[1:07:01] and entertainment put that away that's
[1:07:04] all childish things those are uh foolish
[1:07:06] things I became a man and I put on the
[1:07:10] maturity of the Holy Spirit endeavoring
[1:07:13] to express the love of God to every
[1:07:15] individual but says to the whole world
[1:07:17] the whole human
[1:07:19] race
[1:07:21] Glory the love of God puts away childish
[1:07:24] things in other words God God's love
[1:07:25] won't let us be
[1:07:27] babies he won't let us be immature
[1:07:29] brother R calls them hotbed plants he
[1:07:32] said you always got to pet a hot beded
[1:07:34] plant right he said uh he calls it the
[1:07:37] hybrid it doesn't have the real genetic
[1:07:40] makeup like like an original seed hasn't
[1:07:43] brother said you got to pet that and
[1:07:44] baby that brother says would you come to
[1:07:46] church he said you don't got to Baby
[1:07:47] people to come to
[1:07:49] church right you got to put away
[1:07:50] childish things and remember what was
[1:07:52] the Corinthian childish thing they were
[1:07:53] arguing about who's the best preacher
[1:07:56] who baptized me right who uh who's going
[1:07:59] to pay me back you know uh they're
[1:08:02] arguing about these little things they
[1:08:04] were letting the wrong preachers come in
[1:08:06] right they're hearing the wrong word of
[1:08:08] God they're totally off the word of God
[1:08:10] we need to stay focus on the word of God
[1:08:14] put away childish things let's read that
[1:08:17] I feel like I should read that just to
[1:08:18] give you um and there's actually two
[1:08:21] places yeah let's go to 1 Corinthians
[1:08:23] 3 verse one I'll just read that I don't
[1:08:26] have that in my notes but I the second
[1:08:28] one was just reminded to
[1:08:29] me 1 Corinthians 3:1 and I Brethren
[1:08:32] could not speak un you as unto spiritual
[1:08:34] but as unto carnal even as babes in
[1:08:39] Christ I fed you with milk and not with
[1:08:42] meat for hither to ye were not able to
[1:08:44] Bear it neither yet now are ye
[1:08:47] able now brother R will bring this in
[1:08:49] he'll say look he can't preach
[1:08:50] predestination to them he can't preach
[1:08:53] before the foundation of the world to
[1:08:55] them he can't preach the seals to them
[1:08:58] Hallelujah verse three for ye are not
[1:09:01] yet I'm sorry for ye are yet carnal for
[1:09:04] where and there is among you envy strife
[1:09:07] and divisions are ye not carnal and walk
[1:09:10] as men so Paul says we're not supposed
[1:09:13] to be regular men we're not supposed to
[1:09:15] act like the people at your work or at
[1:09:17] the school just regular Sinners we're
[1:09:19] supposed to walk like Sons and Daughters
[1:09:21] of God hallelujah we should have a
[1:09:23] spiritual maturity where we're different
[1:09:25] and notice what's the verse in there it
[1:09:27] was Envy the love of God doesn't Envy
[1:09:30] right see that they're envying the Bible
[1:09:33] said charity envieth
[1:09:37] not and
[1:09:39] divisions so Satan was dividing uh the
[1:09:43] the church the church didn't have love
[1:09:44] they didn't have the same love one for
[1:09:47] another and Paul's saying if Satan's
[1:09:50] dividing you from doing these things
[1:09:52] you're still a babe you got to grow up
[1:09:54] in Christ God help us to put away
[1:09:57] childish things Hallelujah think about
[1:10:00] that they were arguing well Isaiah
[1:10:03] Brooks baptized me is that okay don't
[1:10:06] beat me up later okay but now push me he
[1:10:09] say Jesse Smith baptized me Jessie
[1:10:11] that's right I did baptize
[1:10:14] you but see that that this is the this
[1:10:16] is the the
[1:10:18] devil well I I had brother Brandon
[1:10:20] baptizing me or brother Brandon makes my
[1:10:22] he mentions my name on tape what does
[1:10:24] that have to do with anything anything
[1:10:25] to do he mentioned a lot of people that
[1:10:28] turn out to be real scallywag
[1:10:32] people real Wicked people but that's
[1:10:35] what they were arguing about that didn't
[1:10:37] unite them people thought they were
[1:10:39] better than the others but the love of
[1:10:41] God makes you humble than others not
[1:10:44] greater than
[1:10:45] others it's Satan who makes them
[1:10:49] babes see dividing verse four so for
[1:10:52] while one saith I'm a Paul another saith
[1:10:54] I am Apollos
[1:10:55] are you not
[1:10:57] carnal
[1:10:59] Hallelujah who then is Paul and who is
[1:11:01] Apollo but ministers by whom you
[1:11:03] believed even as the lord gave to every
[1:11:06] man I've always believed that if there's
[1:11:08] any message believer around the world if
[1:11:09] they really hunger after God God will
[1:11:11] send them a
[1:11:13] preacher
[1:11:15] right look at God God fornew there be
[1:11:17] Believers in Aran what' God do send us a
[1:11:19] preacher God sent me here I didn't ask
[1:11:21] to come here God sent me here right God
[1:11:24] sent brother Brooks out to Iowa because
[1:11:26] there was Believers out there Hallelujah
[1:11:29] God will give it to every man if
[1:11:31] somebody really wants to serve God I
[1:11:32] believe God will raise it up or God
[1:11:34] allow you to get to some church that has
[1:11:36] a faithful Pastor God's required to do
[1:11:39] that would God let a sheep wander around
[1:11:42] there with a bunch of wolves do you
[1:11:43] think God would do that as a great
[1:11:44] Shepherd I don't believe so I think God
[1:11:47] is faithful to his word and now with
[1:11:49] Internet it's even better right
[1:11:51] but I have planted Apollo water but God
[1:11:54] gave the increase
[1:11:56] now let's look at verse S now I'm going
[1:11:58] to get into my message here coming up
[1:12:00] soon so the then neither is he that
[1:12:02] planteth anything Nei neither he that
[1:12:03] WTH but God gave the
[1:12:07] increase so I'm going to preach on this
[1:12:09] later but like last week I hope church I
[1:12:12] hope this is my sincere desire I hope
[1:12:15] brother cam preached something and if
[1:12:16] you never heard it before and you
[1:12:18] received it it was God putting a seed in
[1:12:20] your
[1:12:22] heart I also hope if brother cam
[1:12:24] preached something that I've already
[1:12:26] preached then brother cam watered what I
[1:12:29] preached but I know I'm just going to
[1:12:30] use sister N I know there's last year
[1:12:32] sister Nomi told me a few things few
[1:12:34] sermons that blessed her a lot I know
[1:12:35] the fear of God and some other ones the
[1:12:38] dancing
[1:12:39] services and sister Nomi personally told
[1:12:41] me these were these were important
[1:12:43] sermons for her so we got to apply that
[1:12:45] here I hope for everybody there's God
[1:12:47] has used me to plant some truth in your
[1:12:50] soul or at least if you already knew it
[1:12:52] but you grew in it God allowed me to
[1:12:54] water it but the only way it got gave
[1:12:56] life was if God gave the increase
[1:12:59] hallelujah
[1:13:03] hallelujah that's why God sends the
[1:13:05] preachers they'll plant a seed in your
[1:13:07] soul another brother come around and
[1:13:09] water that but it'll only bring forth
[1:13:11] when God gives the
[1:13:13] increase only God can do
[1:13:16] that does that make sense by God's
[1:13:19] grace and this is maturity so maturity
[1:13:21] is receiving the word from a preacher
[1:13:24] it's God's word it's not the the
[1:13:25] preacher seed is God's seed and another
[1:13:27] preacher will water that see that's true
[1:13:29] that's true here it is more on it more
[1:13:30] Revelation and then God will cause that
[1:13:32] to grow in your
[1:13:33] life
[1:13:35] Hallelujah here let's look at another uh
[1:13:37] scripture about the babies in the church
[1:13:39] uh Hebrews
[1:13:42] 5 now of course this only applies to
[1:13:45] teachers Saints it doesn't apply if
[1:13:46] you're not a preacher this don't apply
[1:13:47] to you now everyone's required to
[1:13:50] witness and especially uh I say like
[1:13:52] this the moms are required to be uh uh
[1:13:54] the gospel to their children they're
[1:13:57] required to know the
[1:14:00] scriptures verse 11 Hebrews 5:11 of whom
[1:14:04] we have many things to say and hard to
[1:14:06] be understood seeing you are dull of
[1:14:07] hearing for when for the time ye ought
[1:14:10] to be teachers you have need that one
[1:14:11] teach you again which be the first
[1:14:12] principles of the Oracles of God and are
[1:14:15] be as become having such need of milk
[1:14:18] and not of strong meat for everyone that
[1:14:20] uses milk is unskillful in the word of
[1:14:22] righteous for he's a babe so when
[1:14:25] preachers don't go deeper in the things
[1:14:27] of God the people remain babies
[1:14:30] spiritual babies and that will cause
[1:14:32] divisions in the church whether it's
[1:14:34] suing or sexual sin or something like
[1:14:36] like those lists that we have here it's
[1:14:38] going to be one of those let me pull
[1:14:40] that up there I'm on slide
[1:14:44] 58 can I find that
[1:14:47] one
[1:14:49] yeah it's going to be one of
[1:14:51] these the babies babies will be divided
[1:14:54] they won't have love love one for
[1:14:55] another babies will have sexual morality
[1:14:57] they'll be suing each other getting
[1:14:58] drunk and using substance abuse and
[1:15:01] pride about their
[1:15:03] superiority Pride with their gifts or
[1:15:06] Pride uh not
[1:15:08] generous and they'll love false
[1:15:12] teachers that's baby
[1:15:14] Christianity but God said put away
[1:15:16] childish things and be mature in Christ
[1:15:20] Jesus Hallelujah but strong meat
[1:15:23] belongeth to them who are of full age
[1:15:25] even those who by reason of use have
[1:15:27] their senses exercised to discern good
[1:15:31] and evil Hallelujah the good and the
[1:15:33] evil praise God God help
[1:15:36] us all right where was I at yeah put
[1:15:39] away childish
[1:15:41] things so God's love as we mature we put
[1:15:44] away childish lust childish uh
[1:15:49] Temptations and sins like this we must
[1:15:51] put it away by the grace of God verse 12
[1:15:55] for now we see through a glass Darkly
[1:15:57] that's a Looking Glass in the old days
[1:15:58] they looking glasses they weren't as
[1:16:00] nice as we have now so it's like he said
[1:16:02] now we're looking through a glass but
[1:16:04] then face to face so right now we don't
[1:16:07] see God face to face he said but one day
[1:16:09] we will see Jesus face to face right now
[1:16:12] I know in part I have a partial
[1:16:14] understanding but then shall I know even
[1:16:17] as God knows me how many believe that
[1:16:20] God knows the very depths of your soul
[1:16:22] God knows if you let him he'll search
[1:16:24] the very depth of your soul he'll bring
[1:16:26] out things that need to be fixed and
[1:16:27] he'll he'll reward you for the things
[1:16:29] you've done right but he wants to search
[1:16:31] every heart
[1:16:32] today
[1:16:34] Hallelujah God knows us intimately
[1:16:37] Hallelujah and now abideth faith hope
[1:16:40] and charity these three but the greatest
[1:16:44] of these is
[1:16:46] Charity see having all faith is a good
[1:16:49] thing Hallelujah we need more of that
[1:16:50] Hallelujah having all faith is a good
[1:16:52] thing we need more of that
[1:16:54] but greater than all these is to have
[1:16:57] the love of Jesus Christ charity in our
[1:17:02] souls I'm going to try to close this I'm
[1:17:04] almost to my time there I thought I'd
[1:17:05] close a little
[1:17:06] sooner there's at least six reasons love
[1:17:09] is greater than Faith and
[1:17:11] Hope love fulfills the whole law Faith
[1:17:13] doesn't fulfill the whole law hope
[1:17:14] doesn't fulfill the whole law love
[1:17:18] does owe no man anything but to love one
[1:17:21] another I owe you brother Mercy
[1:17:25] right sister Haven I owe you what do you
[1:17:27] what Daddy what do you owe me God's love
[1:17:30] that's what I owe you Hallelujah we
[1:17:33] should look at that I owe my brother I
[1:17:35] owe my sister I owe them something I owe
[1:17:36] them love I need to pay them their God's
[1:17:40] love that I love that beautifully spoken
[1:17:44] by the word of God here for he that
[1:17:45] loveth another hath fulfilled the
[1:17:48] law remember the bad thing about the law
[1:17:51] the bad thing about the law was that
[1:17:52] you're curse if you didn't keep all of
[1:17:53] it the law is good it tells us right
[1:17:56] from wrong the law is Holy but the curse
[1:18:00] of the law is that if you break one
[1:18:02] you're guilty the whole but Jesus became
[1:18:04] the curse the curse was put on Jesus
[1:18:06] that the blessing might come upon
[1:18:08] us verse 10 love worketh no ill to his
[1:18:12] neighbor therefore love is the
[1:18:15] fulfilling of the law when you just want
[1:18:18] to be good to your neighbor you ever
[1:18:20] done that before just mowed a little bit
[1:18:21] of your neighbor's yard or ra a little
[1:18:24] bit of your neighbor neighbor leaves
[1:18:25] just to be good to them or picked up
[1:18:28] some of their
[1:18:30] trash ever done
[1:18:32] that that's love love only wants good
[1:18:35] for your neighbor I'm talking about the
[1:18:37] Neighbors in your seats
[1:18:39] too love is the Fulfillment of God's law
[1:18:43] love if you have love it fulfills
[1:18:45] everything you know you passed the test
[1:18:48] God's giv you Grace to overcome
[1:18:49] Hallelujah the second reason love is
[1:18:52] eternal see there's going to come a time
[1:18:54] we won't need Faith anymore Faith is a
[1:18:56] revelation right we won't need it's a
[1:18:57] revelation of the will of God we at one
[1:18:59] point we won't need a revelation that
[1:19:00] we'll know God's will to live
[1:19:02] eternally and we'll have to hope am I
[1:19:04] going to make it am I going to live
[1:19:05] forever like we'll we'll we'll we'll
[1:19:07] know it by God's grace Hallelujah we'll
[1:19:09] have eternal life Hallelujah but one
[1:19:12] thing that's Eternal is the love of
[1:19:17] God see when that which is perfect has
[1:19:19] come then that which is in part shall be
[1:19:21] done away all these things that are
[1:19:22] temporary based on temporary things they
[1:19:25] will eventually end but love has no end
[1:19:27] because love had no beginning God is
[1:19:31] love third love is the greatest
[1:19:34] expression of God's
[1:19:36] character beloved let us love one
[1:19:38] another for love is of God and everyone
[1:19:41] that loveth is born of God and knoweth
[1:19:44] God he that loveth not knoweth not God
[1:19:48] for God is God is
[1:19:51] love and if you're born of God you will
[1:19:54] love your brother and sister with all
[1:19:56] those 16
[1:19:58] attributes 16 attributes now what is 16
[1:20:02] here's my numerology I think it's a
[1:20:03] double
[1:20:04] portion because Elijah did eight
[1:20:06] Miracles and God said Elijah said I want
[1:20:09] a double portion he did 16 Miracles so
[1:20:11] that's just one that's just one I could
[1:20:13] be wrong that's that's my only guess
[1:20:14] right now 16 is a double
[1:20:16] portion that's my
[1:20:19] guess so see love is the greatest
[1:20:21] expression of God's character because
[1:20:23] that is God's essence he is
[1:20:27] love so see when when someone says I
[1:20:30] know God or I know the message you'll
[1:20:32] see it by their actions do they love
[1:20:33] their
[1:20:34] enemies do they love the
[1:20:38] unlovable number four love is also the
[1:20:41] greatest commandment Master which is the
[1:20:43] great commandment in the law Jesus saith
[1:20:46] unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy
[1:20:47] God with all thy heart soul with all thy
[1:20:50] mind this is the first and great
[1:20:52] commandment and the second is lik UN to
[1:20:54] it that Thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:20:58] thyself number five love is what is the
[1:21:03] root of faith and works and even hope
[1:21:07] right the Bible says faith which works
[1:21:11] by love so the whole the whole beginning
[1:21:14] if you ever had Faith to be saved the
[1:21:15] whole beginning is God gave you some of
[1:21:17] his
[1:21:18] love this holy spirit's in you that's
[1:21:21] the love of God it's an attribute of the
[1:21:23] love of God I love God because he first
[1:21:25] loved me and purchased my salvation on
[1:21:27] calvary's tree Hallelujah is that right
[1:21:30] amen I love God because he first loved
[1:21:33] me and then if you have love love will
[1:21:36] motivate your faith and faith will get
[1:21:38] to work Hallelujah theam says faith is
[1:21:41] Works expressed Hallelujah I'm sorry
[1:21:44] works is Faith expressed sorry got out
[1:21:46] works are Faith expressed and that all
[1:21:49] comes from love love Faith
[1:21:52] Works finally
[1:21:55] Love In Action is the greatest Victory
[1:21:57] there
[1:21:59] is there's three men in this Parable I
[1:22:01] actually preached this par par very
[1:22:03] briefly on Wednesday night the oil and
[1:22:05] the
[1:22:07] wine the man asked him you know what's
[1:22:09] the greatest commandment Jesus says uh
[1:22:11] to love God with all your heart soul
[1:22:13] mind strength he said unto him uh I'm
[1:22:15] sorry the man answered that he said thou
[1:22:17] Hast answered right Jesus said this do
[1:22:19] and thou shalt live but he willing to
[1:22:21] justify himself said unto Jesus who is
[1:22:24] my name neighbor now I think it's
[1:22:26] interesting I'm not saying this is
[1:22:27] exactly thus sayi the Lord but there's
[1:22:29] three people that passed by this wounded
[1:22:31] man there's
[1:22:33] three we know this we know the Good
[1:22:36] Samaritan has to be love because the
[1:22:38] question is about
[1:22:39] love Hallelujah the question is on well
[1:22:42] who's my neighbor how do I love my
[1:22:44] neighbor how do I express the love of
[1:22:45] God and first a priest comes by if
[1:22:49] anybody knows how to get this guy clean
[1:22:51] it's the priest he knows what sacrifices
[1:22:54] need made he's he's got faith in I I I
[1:22:56] just type him as Faith he knows what God
[1:22:58] wants done with his
[1:23:00] word but Faith sees it and it goes to
[1:23:02] the other side of the street I'm not
[1:23:04] touching that with a 50-foot
[1:23:06] Pole right so Faith wasn't enough he had
[1:23:10] Faith to offer the sacrifices Faith to
[1:23:12] pray the next man the levite comes the
[1:23:15] levite was they had the sacred utensils
[1:23:17] they cleaned the utensils they kept
[1:23:19] Everything clean they scrubbed it they
[1:23:21] put water on it uh they got the loaves
[1:23:23] the bread ready we t talked about they
[1:23:26] open and shut the gates so these are the
[1:23:28] men that would say I'd rather be a
[1:23:30] doorkeeper in the house of God than
[1:23:31] dwell in the tents of the wicked preach
[1:23:33] that on Wednesday right Hallelujah
[1:23:36] better is one day in his courts than a
[1:23:38] thousand elsewhere Hallelujah they would
[1:23:40] also sing all the sacred hins of the
[1:23:43] temple and they would do many other
[1:23:45] things so these I I type these out to
[1:23:47] hope they were right next to the priest
[1:23:50] and they had hope that God heard all the
[1:23:51] prayers they sang the songs they opened
[1:23:53] the doors but this man also goes to the
[1:23:56] other side of the street but then comes
[1:23:58] we say
[1:23:59] Jesus then comes the Good Samaritan the
[1:24:02] Jews always look down on the
[1:24:05] Samaritans right so here's a guy who
[1:24:07] really doesn't he's not a good guy we
[1:24:10] call him the Good Samaritan but to the
[1:24:12] Jews he was an awful guy and he comes on
[1:24:15] him and he says here's what's wrong and
[1:24:17] I can fix it Hallelujah that's what the
[1:24:20] love of God does here's a broken
[1:24:22] individual this person's almost dead
[1:24:24] I'll do whatever it takes to bring them
[1:24:26] back to life Hallelujah it'd be much
[1:24:29] easier to forget about it bypass on the
[1:24:31] other side of the road it'd be much
[1:24:32] easier to follow the religious Realms
[1:24:34] like that but the love of God had to be
[1:24:37] expressed Hallelujah and God's love
[1:24:39] filled the Samaritan's heart and he says
[1:24:42] I'll pour in oil I'll give you what you
[1:24:43] need right now and then I'll give you
[1:24:45] what you have need for the future Amen
[1:24:48] brother Braham said it's God giving him
[1:24:49] two pence he Tak him to the inkeeper
[1:24:51] that's the spirit and truth and he says
[1:24:54] if I owe you anything I'll give it to
[1:24:56] you when I come back oh when Jesus comes
[1:24:59] back he'll have rewards for you if you
[1:25:00] ever did something for Jesus he'll
[1:25:02] reward you at the rasher the meeting in
[1:25:04] the air Hallelujah let's stand to our
[1:25:06] feet Hallelujah musicians can
[1:25:10] come you you'll be guaranteed that if
[1:25:12] you ever did anything for Jesus he'll
[1:25:15] reward you when he comes back to get
[1:25:21] you I'm going to read this quote and
[1:25:22] then I'll be done
[1:25:25] you might remember this adoption
[1:25:28] 1960 that's what bothers me to preach to
[1:25:31] you people don't remain on in the same
[1:25:34] condition you've been going in change
[1:25:36] now so let's bow our heads here what
[1:25:38] condition have we been going in church I
[1:25:40] hope you're on that upward Arc like I
[1:25:41] preached on a few weeks ago is your life
[1:25:44] going upward closer to God with more
[1:25:46] love and yes you should have Faith and
[1:25:48] Hope too but love should be the greatest
[1:25:51] motivator with our heads bowed are we on
[1:25:54] the in the right condition we should be
[1:25:57] in he says hear me say it thus sayith
[1:26:00] the Lord I've never called myself this
[1:26:02] I'm not but you call me your Prophet or
[1:26:04] a prophet the world believes that the
[1:26:05] world around millions of millions of
[1:26:06] people I've spoken directly indirectly
[1:26:09] to 10 or 12 million people or more
[1:26:11] directly speaking I've seen tens of
[1:26:12] thousands of visions and signs and
[1:26:14] wonders not one of them ever failed he's
[1:26:16] for told me things that's never that's
[1:26:18] never happened I'm sorry it's never
[1:26:20] failed to happen just exactly I'll bring
[1:26:21] any man to trial for that that's right I
[1:26:23] don't claim to be a prophet but you
[1:26:24] listen to me thus sayith the Lord it'll
[1:26:26] take you what church perfect what
[1:26:28] perfect love to put you in that place
[1:26:31] he's talking about beyond the curtain of
[1:26:32] time brother calls it the sixth
[1:26:34] Dimension you might call it uh
[1:26:37] Paradise for that's all there was there
[1:26:41] no matter what money how much religious
[1:26:43] demonstrations how many Good Deeds
[1:26:44] you've done or whatever You' done that
[1:26:46] won't count nothing on that day it'll
[1:26:48] take perfect
[1:26:51] love so whatever you do you lay aside it
[1:26:54] anything else until you're just so
[1:26:55] filled with the love of God so you can
[1:26:58] love those who hate
[1:27:01] you doesn't love bear all
[1:27:04] things doesn't love believe all
[1:27:07] things let's
[1:27:15] pray Heavenly Father Lord you see the
[1:27:17] conditions of our hearts today Lord the

[1:28:43] souls Lord God we know what to
[1:28:48] do we know Jesus liking us to a house
[1:28:52] and if we if someone has bound up our
[1:28:53] faith faith if our faith is dormant if
[1:28:56] we're not in the right condition we have
[1:28:58] to expose the enemy we have to repent of
[1:29:00] our
[1:29:01] sins call upon the name of the Lord for
[1:29:05] deliverance and when we do that Lord the
[1:29:07] love of God and we really mean it to
[1:29:09] repent of our sins our iniquities when
[1:29:11] we really mean it the love of God comes
[1:29:13] into our soul and it casts out fear

[1:29:22] sin whether it's puffed up whether it's
[1:29:27] Envy whether it's childish things Lord

[1:29:49] condition of our lives today may we
[1:29:50] leave here in a better condition than
[1:29:52] when we came Lord God
