[0:00] revealing himself in the same uh it's a
[0:03] beautiful message if you haven't
[0:04] listened to it lately. I was listening
[0:05] to it yesterday and a huge blessing.
[0:09] There's so many uh quotes that come out
[0:10] of this sermon. No doubt, no wonder the
[0:13] person put it in a song. You know, they
[0:14] they put God hiding himself in
[0:16] simplicity in a song. Verse 25, I'll
[0:19] read 25 and we can all read uh 26
[0:21] together. At that time Jesus answered
[0:23] and said,"I thank thee, oh father, Lord
[0:25] of heaven and earth, because thou has
[0:27] hid these things from the wise and
[0:29] prudent, and has revealed them unto
[0:31] babes." Let's read verse 26. Ready? 1 2
[0:34] 3. Even so, Father, for so it seemed
[0:37] good in thy sight. May God add his
[0:40] blessing to Rem's word. You may be
[0:41] seated. You can switch over. I just got
[0:43] a quick visual. And now I remember what
[0:44] I want to say, but it's okay. I'll say
[0:45] it on live stream. Just a little more
[0:47] vague, I guess. Uh, that's right. Yeah.
[0:50] Um this week, you know, I was over
[0:51] lifting at the gym, you know, and I ran
[0:53] into our brother who visited us, and he
[0:55] was still talking about what a wonderful
[0:56] time it was in the Lord. And um
[1:00] I don't want to say too much, but um you
[1:03] know, he's gone to Catholic church his
[1:04] whole life, and yet he comes here,
[1:06] Brother Vang, and he feels he feels the
[1:07] girls behind him praying or singing, and
[1:09] he said all of his hairs were standing
[1:10] up the whole song service because he
[1:13] hadn't felt the presence of God, the
[1:15] spirit of God like he felt in this
[1:16] little church. Now, think about that.
[1:17] He's been to massive Catholic
[1:18] institutions, right? You've seen the big
[1:20] buildings, but yet he comes here and he
[1:22] feels the Holy Ghost in a brand new way
[1:24] he's never felt before. And then he was
[1:26] testifying to this man who joined the
[1:28] gym. He's like, "You need to go to his
[1:29] church."
[1:31] I don't know if that's going to happen,
[1:32] but but Jesus thanked God that he hid it
[1:35] from the eyes of the wise and prudent
[1:36] and revealed it unto babes. Such as we
[1:38] learn. Remember, don't forget my cousin
[1:40] here was just in August here in August.
[1:42] He said he couldn't even sing during the
[1:44] song service because of all the worship.
[1:46] Sometimes we take uh for granted the
[1:48] Holy Ghost anointing that's in this
[1:49] place. Right? Like brother Bam said, he
[1:52] said uh my wife, I become common to my
[1:54] wife. She becomes common to me.
[1:56] Sometimes we forget what a blessing that
[1:58] we have by God's presence. So there we
[2:00] have two witnesses. People can hardly
[2:02] sing and hardly uh hardly just deal with
[2:04] the presence of God that's so fresh
[2:06] here. Church, if you have a prayer
[2:08] request today, let's believe God.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; God is here. Hallelujah.
[2:12] &gt;&gt; God is here. And as and oh yeah, I also
[2:14] want to say thank you. On Wednesday, I
[2:15] changed the service because uh my
[2:17] mother-in-law was here. And I don't know
[2:18] if you caught that, but I was going to
[2:19] preach this. But when I realized my
[2:21] mother-in-law was coming, we're like, I
[2:22] I thought, well, Lord, what could I say
[2:24] that would be uh on her level, you know,
[2:27] something that would uh uh maybe be so
[2:30] simple because I was going to get into
[2:31] this sermon. Well, it's hard to it's
[2:32] hard for somebody to come in and and
[2:34] then listen to a preacher preach about
[2:36] what another preacher preached 60 years
[2:38] ago.
[2:39] uh and it wasn't like all it was wasn't
[2:42] like a lot of deep scriptures. You know,
[2:43] these are a lot of quotes I'm going to
[2:44] go through this morning. But, uh I
[2:46] wanted to be more scriptural and so I
[2:48] just tried to go with the leading of the
[2:49] Lord. But thank you for doing that. You
[2:51] know, even my mother-in-law said on
[2:52] Wednesday night when I got home, she
[2:53] really enjoyed the service and you all
[2:56] have treated the guests so well. I want
[2:58] to thank you for that. Um like Brendan
[3:00] and Adam said, I you know, they said,
[3:03] "We instantly felt the love of the
[3:04] church." So, thank you for loving
[3:06] people. Praise God. I'm happy to be a
[3:08] part of a church that we let the Holy
[3:10] Ghost do the rebuking, right? We let the
[3:13] Holy Ghost do the correction. Well,
[3:14] you're not dressed exactly right or you
[3:15] got the wrong attitude or you don't go
[3:17] to the right church. You know, you need
[3:18] to come to our church. I'm glad that we
[3:20] let the Holy Ghost reveal it to people.
[3:23] &gt;&gt; Now, some people might need that type of
[3:24] a straight rebuke or something like
[3:26] that, but I'm glad to be a part of a
[3:27] church that we just let the Holy Ghost
[3:28] do it. Praise God. If they're the seed
[3:30] of God, you can't miss it if you're the
[3:32] seed of God. If you're if you're a real
[3:34] rose rose plant seed, you will produce
[3:37] rose petals. Hallelujah. And then you
[3:40] will go to the right church. You'll
[3:41] believe the word. You'll find the truth
[3:42] because the seed of God is already in
[3:44] you. And brother Chris, you're a great
[3:46] example of that, brother. All your
[3:48] family, you know, nobody nobody was
[3:50] blooming in their rose, right? But you
[3:51] had a seed of God inside of you.
[3:53] Hallelujah. And so when Austin talked to
[3:55] you, you heard the word of God, you
[3:57] received it. Hallelujah. So, thank the
[3:59] Lord for that. Amen. Amen. Okay. So, I
[4:01] think I can preach now here. We'll see.
[4:03] By God's grace.
[4:05] So, we want to look here again at this
[4:07] thought of God hiding himself uh in
[4:08] simplicity. Uh part, this is part four.
[4:12] Pardon me. I want to set my timer. So,
[4:14] we've looked at recognize your day. It's
[4:16] a message. Now, that I'm I just gave
[4:18] these like a one-s sentence review in my
[4:20] mind. This was about recognizing we're
[4:22] in Leodysa. God has sent a prophet and
[4:24] he's restoring us back to the apostolic
[4:26] faith. That's what that sermon was
[4:28] about. Serpency, we know that. That's
[4:30] basically um how sin came into the
[4:33] world. Sin sin came in by adultery, but
[4:35] God's going to bring it back by
[4:36] virginity. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[4:39] By the seed of God, the spiritual seed
[4:41] of God. Perfect faith. We know. We found
[4:43] out what that was. That was just a
[4:44] revelation. So when God makes something
[4:46] known to you, you don't have any doubts.
[4:48] You have perfect faith. It's not trying
[4:51] to have faith. It's God revealed it to
[4:53] you so you do have faith.
[4:55] &gt;&gt; Right? That's where we got to learn. I
[4:56] got to learn. We all got to learn. We
[4:57] all got to be led by the Holy Spirit.
[4:59] The breach again was uh uh the breach
[5:02] was revelation four and five. Brother
[5:04] said it's the breach or the division
[5:05] between the church ages and the seven
[5:07] seals. And in those sermons, brother Bam
[5:09] focused on the the power of the lamb.
[5:12] The lamb redeemed us to God. The lamb is
[5:14] the only one worthy to come and open the
[5:16] seven seals. And that shows us that
[5:18] Jesus Christ has redeemed us back to our
[5:20] original position as kings and priests
[5:22] unto God. Hallelujah. And then if we're
[5:24] faithful here, if we have the right
[5:25] character here, he'll take that same
[5:27] character and he'll cause us to rule and
[5:29] reign in the millennium. Amen. The
[5:32] message of grace, by the way, I went
[5:33] through all these examples of God's
[5:34] grace on Noah, Moses, David, all these
[5:37] beautiful examples. And then I love what
[5:39] he used. Uh he used Zerubabel. The the
[5:41] headstone was put on with shoutings of
[5:43] grace, grace unto it. And we know the
[5:46] headstone represents the second coming
[5:47] of Jesus Christ. So we get a revelation
[5:49] that God will give us more grace for the
[5:51] rapture. Amen. God has given grace for
[5:53] the foundation to be established through
[5:55] St. Paul build the church ages. But as
[5:57] that capstone comes, it's going to be
[5:59] shouting. There's going to be shoutings
[6:00] of grace, grace. Thank you, God, for all
[6:02] the grace you've given to us. Amen. And
[6:04] the coming of the Lord, uh we kind of
[6:06] focused on the pre-tribulation rapture.
[6:09] It's come under a lot of attack lately.
[6:11] Uh so has the Scofield Bible, but we
[6:13] looked at there and we can see it all
[6:14] through the scripture. It's mysterious
[6:16] because the rapture is called a mystery.
[6:18] You won't just pick up your Bible and
[6:20] understand it. You need revelation from
[6:21] the Holy Spirit, right? Just like the
[6:23] Godhead. You won't just pick up the
[6:25] Bible and know uh uh well, Father, Son,
[6:27] Holy Ghost, what you won't you won't
[6:29] exactly know the revelation, but you
[6:30] need the Holy Spirit to reveal it to
[6:32] you. Thank God that the mysteries of God
[6:34] are finished in this hour.
[6:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now we're looking at God
[6:38] hiding himself in simplicity. Uh in the
[6:40] first three sermons, we've only looked
[6:41] at the Brother Rams, we're looking at
[6:42] his first 58 minutes before he even
[6:44] start starts preaching. It's a three
[6:46] hour. It's over a three-hour sermon. The
[6:48] first hour is basically a church
[6:50] dedication. He's talking about how the
[6:52] church has changed. It's renovated and
[6:54] so forth. And then the spoken word
[6:57] original seat, if you haven't listened
[6:58] to that, it's two sermons. One's three
[6:59] hours, one's three and a half, and they
[7:01] put them together. It's a six and a half
[7:02] hour sermon. Praise God. And uh just so
[7:05] many nuggets in that one, too. I was
[7:06] listening to that this week and uh
[7:08] enjoying what I was so blessed by what I
[7:10] was hearing. I I guess I'll just show
[7:11] this here uh again.
[7:14] So with uh
[7:17] this this cloud was a a fulfillment of a
[7:20] prophecy from brother Brandham. He said
[7:22] in the name of the Lord. He said I'm
[7:24] here tonight in the name of the Lord. I
[7:26] was I had a vision, right? I had a
[7:28] vision of a snow white pyramid and I'm
[7:30] going to meet the angels and something's
[7:32] going to happen. He didn't he didn't
[7:33] know what it was. But when he finally
[7:34] met the angels, they said, "Go back and
[7:36] open the seven seals for God." In other
[7:38] words, preach the revelation of the
[7:40] seven seals. He thought he thought this
[7:42] vision and meeting these this these
[7:43] angels would be his death. He said it's
[7:45] not my death. It's a furtherment of my
[7:47] ministry. Hallelujah. The third poll.
[7:49] And then you know we looked at Brandham
[7:51] Tabernacle before the 63 renovation and
[7:53] then it was expanded 30% and then they
[7:56] have the current Brandom Tabernacle
[7:57] which is only used one time. It's used
[7:58] on Wednesday night for silent prayer
[8:00] meetings. Uh it's been abandoned as we
[8:02] looked at re recently. We preached on
[8:03] that as well. And then we looked at the
[8:05] lily. Okay. Uh by God's grace. All
[8:07] right. That's all. I think that's all.
[8:08] Well, I'm sorry. No, let me put that up
[8:09] there real quick. Yeah. Let me put this
[8:11] up here real quick. I'll just leave this
[8:13] up here for a brief moment. Okay. So,
[8:15] I'm I'm looking at this sermon here. God
[8:17] hiding himself in simplicity. I got my
[8:19] notes on another uh device. I think I'll
[8:21] just use my notes here that you can see
[8:22] that just for a little bit. Now, is that
[8:24] helpful by God's grace to see where
[8:26] we're at? Hopefully, you can see where
[8:27] we're at here uh looking at this uh
[8:30] topic here as we get into part four.
[8:33] All right. So, Brother preaches God
[8:35] hiding himself in simplicity Sunday
[8:37] morning and then the breach on Sunday
[8:39] night. We've already preached through
[8:40] that. Uh and then he preaches the
[8:43] opening of the seven seals, questions
[8:44] and answers in the morning. He ends with
[8:46] the seventh seal. Okay. Now, I'm just
[8:48] going to briefly go through a few quotes
[8:50] here by God's grace. Uh here, brother
[8:52] Ram says, "Many times," now he's
[8:53] preaching in this morning service. He
[8:55] says, "Many times our teenage children
[8:57] and sometimes adults, you know, young
[8:59] people will pass notes or cut up or
[9:01] something in the church. You're old
[9:03] enough to know better than that. You
[9:04] should know better than that. you
[9:06] shouldn't come here if you expect to be
[9:08] a real man someday and raise a family.
[9:11] So, Brother Vang, that's what we are.
[9:12] We're we're real men, right? But man
[9:15] said, if you expect to be a real man and
[9:17] raise a family someday, hallelujah, and
[9:19] all of our future uh dads, right?
[9:21] Hallelujah. And if you're called to
[9:23] that, some people might not be called to
[9:24] be a father, but brother says, "A real
[9:26] man will raise his children." If you
[9:28] expect to be a real man someday, raise a
[9:30] family to the kingdom of God, then start
[9:32] it off at the beginning. See, act right
[9:35] and do right. Now, of course,
[9:38] &gt;&gt; so he's talking about in service. Now, I
[9:40] want to remind our our young people,
[9:41] too, that are here to pray at 10:00. I
[9:44] want everybody to pray during that time.
[9:46] Okay? So, you shouldn't be reading your
[9:47] Bibles during that prayer time. I want
[9:49] everybody to pray by God's grace. That's
[9:51] what it's for. I want everybody to spend
[9:53] more time praying. So, I think we're
[9:55] doing a good job. And I wasn't looking
[9:56] around today. I was praying myself. But,
[9:58] uh, that's why I'm doing that. I wanted
[10:00] everybody to pray. If we can't get here
[10:01] at 9:30, then at 10:00, let's all get
[10:03] here by 10 so we can pray. Hallelujah.
[10:05] Let's make an effort to do that. If your
[10:07] boss at work asked you to come in a
[10:09] little bit early, you do it,
[10:11] &gt;&gt; right? Especially if money was involved.
[10:13] And I'm not I mean, the church is
[10:14] operated by tithe. I'm not asking for
[10:16] your money. God's asking for your money.
[10:18] But if God's asking us to pray more,
[10:20] let's do it. Let's be the first to do it
[10:21] by God's grace.
[10:23] &gt;&gt; Think about that. What is our testimony
[10:25] going to be in heaven? What? Yeah, we've
[10:26] overcome a lot. But but but could we
[10:28] have a testimony of I there came a time
[10:30] in my life when I devoted myself to more
[10:32] prayer.
[10:33] &gt;&gt; Or I came to my life when I devoted
[10:35] myself to really studying the scripture,
[10:37] really listening to brother Am's
[10:39] sermons.
[10:40] &gt;&gt; Let's have a testimony like that where
[10:42] we came into a closer walk with God. We
[10:44] became more dedicated and diligent in
[10:46] the things of God. Amen. Well, I
[10:49] appreciate those amens. Hallelujah. Now,
[10:51] Brother R says, "Uh, the deacons," he
[10:53] says. Now, I'm the only deacon in the
[10:56] church, but you know, uh, our sisters
[10:57] and mothers and fathers are kind of
[10:59] like, uh, honorary deacons to their own
[11:01] children. You got to watch over your own
[11:03] children as parents. Uh, and if there's
[11:05] no adults around, then there's a deacon,
[11:07] that'd be me, to Brother says they are
[11:10] commissioned to ask the person to be
[11:11] quiet. So, as a deacon, as I've told
[11:14] you, you know, the last few months when
[11:15] I've had to talk to people, I'll just
[11:16] I'll say something like this. Oh, could
[11:17] you please be quiet? Or can I help you
[11:19] be quiet? Or can I get you some paper? I
[11:21] was told uh uh somebody needed some
[11:23] paper and some kids needed drawing in
[11:24] paper last week and somebody went and
[11:26] got it. That's a good thing to do.
[11:27] Praise God. These little children have
[11:29] trouble with all that energy they got,
[11:30] all their all they're growing. They can
[11:32] hardly sit still, right? So, let's do
[11:34] our best by God's grace to keep them
[11:36] busy on something good by the grace of
[11:38] the Lord. Something quiet. Hallelujah.
[11:40] So, that way that that way everybody can
[11:41] come to hear the word of God. That's why
[11:43] you came today to hear God's word. Amen.
[11:46] &gt;&gt; And we read it out of Matthew 11.
[11:47] Hallelujah. We'll be reading some more
[11:49] here by God's grace. And brother Ram
[11:52] says,
[11:53] he says, uh, somebody came for that
[11:55] purpose, to hear the word. That's what
[11:57] we're here for is to hear the word of
[11:58] the Lord. So everybody wants to hear it.
[12:00] Want to want it just as quiet as they
[12:02] can be. Just as quiet as they can be.
[12:04] That is not a bunch of talking and
[12:06] carrying on.
[12:08] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, brother Bam tells us that uh
[12:10] especially during the service, we want
[12:12] it to be people where we can listen and
[12:14] we can hear the word of God. We want
[12:16] God's people to hear the word because
[12:17] the word is the only thing that gives
[12:19] life.
[12:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But then you got to act upon
[12:22] it. See, I know as a preacher, I can say
[12:23] things over and over again, right? I can
[12:25] say, but if it won't it won't have any
[12:27] effect until somebody takes it and says,
[12:29] "That's mine. I believe God's talking to
[12:31] me. I'm going to act on this. I'm going
[12:33] to believe this scripture."
[12:35] &gt;&gt; Right? Brother said, "But of course,
[12:37] somebody worshiping the Lord. That's
[12:38] expected. That's what it should be.
[12:40] That's what you're here for, to worship
[12:41] the Lord. Just if you feel like praising
[12:44] God or shouting, just go right on
[12:46] because that's what you're here for.
[12:48] See?
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you feel led to shout, just
[12:51] give out a shout. Hallelujah.
[12:53] &gt;&gt; If you feel led to praise the Lord, just
[12:55] go praise the Lord. Amen.
[12:56] &gt;&gt; That's why you're here. So you you hear
[12:58] the word quietly until something strikes
[13:00] you. Then you say, "Praise God."
[13:01] Hallelujah.
[13:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen.
[13:05] That's what you're here for. but to
[13:07] worship the Lord in your own way of
[13:09] worshiping. There's nobody worships the
[13:11] Lord while you're talking or passing
[13:13] notes, children. That's why I talked
[13:14] about that a couple weeks ago. You're
[13:16] not worshiping God by saying, "Hey, look
[13:18] at this drawing I did." Or, "Hey, look
[13:19] at this scribbling that I did." You
[13:20] know, you're not worshiping God that
[13:22] way. You're worshiping God by listening
[13:24] to the word and agreeing with what God
[13:26] said.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:30] He said, "When you're talking and
[13:31] passing notes, you're helping somebody
[13:33] else to get away from the worship of
[13:34] God." So we feel that would be wrong and
[13:37] we want to make a ruling in our church
[13:39] that in our congregation, this building,
[13:41] this church will be dedicated to the
[13:43] kingdom of God and to the preaching of
[13:44] the word. Pray, worship. That's the
[13:47] reason you come here to worship then.
[13:50] Amen. Glory.
[13:54] And brother said, I've seen in churches
[13:56] the children were permitted to run all
[13:57] over the sanctuary and the adults
[13:59] standing and hollering across the room
[14:01] one to another. That's a good way to
[14:03] ruin the service coming up that night or
[14:05] whenever it is. And I went over that on
[14:07] Wednesday or last uh Wednesday by God's
[14:09] grace. In our church, if everybody's
[14:11] happy at the end of service and it's a
[14:12] faith-building service and uh there's
[14:15] nobody praying, you look around,
[14:16] nobody's praying, then let's shake
[14:17] hands. Let's be happy. How was your
[14:19] week, brother? Love you, brother. But if
[14:21] if we see somebody praying up here, I'm
[14:22] going to try to do a better job. Let's
[14:24] exit quickly. If you're not going to
[14:25] stay and pray, let's let's uh leave
[14:27] quickly. Go talk out there so we can
[14:29] have people seeking God. they can find
[14:31] God.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:32] &gt;&gt; But it's not going to work. It's a lot
[14:34] harder to find God when there's talking
[14:35] and and the seriousness has left.
[14:38] &gt;&gt; Uh the sincerity of the word is left.
[14:40] It's harder to find God during those
[14:42] times.
[14:43] &gt;&gt; But you can find God when people are
[14:45] sincere and focused on God and they want
[14:47] to go pray for somebody or they want to
[14:49] go lay their hands on somebody. That's
[14:51] when you can find God when the people
[14:52] are looking for God to move. But there
[14:55] is a time, you hear it on tape. There's
[14:56] a time, brother Ram says, "Turn around
[14:57] and shake people's hand and uh greet
[14:59] them in the name of the Lord and all
[15:01] these things." There are times to do
[15:02] that and I just want to be more mindful
[15:04] of that because I've let that slip over
[15:06] the years. I'm not perfect as a pastor.
[15:08] You know, sometimes I I I forget people
[15:10] are praying and I'm just greeting the
[15:11] visitors like, "Thank you for coming."
[15:12] Or, "Brother Chris, how you doing, sir?
[15:14] Brother Vang, love you, brother." You
[15:15] know, something like that. I just want
[15:17] to be more mindful. If people are
[15:19] praying, this is the house of prayer.
[15:20] This should be the place where they can
[15:22] have some quiet prayer.
[15:24] You might not be able to get it in your
[15:26] home.
[15:28] Then brother Ram said, "As soon as the
[15:29] service is dismissed, leave the
[15:31] auditorium. You're through in the
[15:33] worship." Then then go out and talk to
[15:35] one another. Whatever you want to do. If
[15:36] you got something you want to talk to
[15:37] somebody, see them. Well, you go with
[15:38] them to their home. Whatever it is, but
[15:40] don't do in the auditorium. Let's
[15:41] dedicate this to God. See, this is his
[15:44] meeting place where we meet with him.
[15:45] See, and the law goes forth from the
[15:47] sanctuary. Of course, I believe that
[15:49] would be pleasing to the heavenly
[15:51] father. So, if you want to talk to me
[15:53] after service, pat me on the shoulder,
[15:54] say, "Brother Jesse, can we go in your
[15:56] office real quick? I want to talk to
[15:57] you, right? Or if you want to talk to
[15:59] Brother Malachi or who you want to talk
[16:01] to, Sister Zir or Sister or Brother Nia,
[16:03] you want to talk to somebody? Let's
[16:04] let's go do it out in the in the in the
[16:06] right out in the hallway." Now, it's
[16:07] going to be winter time. You're going to
[16:08] want to do it in the hallway. Better
[16:10] enjoy the parking lot conversations
[16:11] while you got it. Amen. Last few weeks
[16:13] here by God's grace.
[16:16] And then, Brother ends this. He's
[16:18] rededicating the church because it's now
[16:20] it's 30% bigger. He ends it by saying
[16:23] this before he prays. He says,
[16:24] "Remember, love is corrective. Genuine
[16:27] love is corrective. So, you must be able
[16:29] to stand correction." So, he's talking
[16:32] about taking care of the church. Talking
[16:34] about keeping the atmosphere holy. If
[16:36] you can't be corrected on how you behave
[16:38] in church, how do you have the love of
[16:40] God?
[16:41] &gt;&gt; You don't have the love of God.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; Because love of God is corrective. Jesus
[16:45] said, "If you love me, you'll do what?
[16:46] you'll keep my commands. Right?
[16:51] He says,
[16:53] "You young kids, you know better than to
[16:54] run around the building unless we're
[16:55] having a dance service." Hallelujah. Or
[16:58] if you just feel led to, we're having a
[16:59] song service. You feel led to run and
[17:01] you go do that, children. Praise God.
[17:03] It's been a while since we seen him
[17:04] dance. Genevie want to do a dance
[17:05] service pretty soon. So, I just forgot
[17:07] about it. Maybe we'll schedule that on
[17:08] upcoming uh Sunday night service. Or you
[17:11] can just dance anytime you want. I'll
[17:12] join you. Hallelujah. just feel a letter
[17:15] of the Holy Spirit by God's grace. You
[17:18] adults know better than to talk and
[17:19] carry on your conversations in the
[17:21] auditorium. Don't do that. It's wrong.
[17:23] It isn't pleasing to God. He says,
[17:25] &gt;&gt; that's why I was saying, you know, if
[17:27] we're going to have a conversation, and
[17:28] I I've been guilty. That's why I'm
[17:29] saying, let's try to carry it out there,
[17:32] &gt;&gt; especially if we see, let's look around.
[17:33] Let's be more mindful. Who's praying? Is
[17:34] brother so and so, sister so and so
[17:36] praying? Let's be mindful of the
[17:37] presence of God. Jesus, and he ends this
[17:40] by quoting the scripture. Jesus said,
[17:41] "It is written, my house shall be made a
[17:44] house of worship, prayer, called the
[17:47] house of prayer by all nations." And the
[17:50] church said,
[17:50] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. So then, right then, brother Ram
[17:52] ends here this uh he ends it with a
[17:55] prayer. He re he said, "Let's stand.
[17:56] We'll dedicate our hearts to God." And
[17:58] he and he thanks God for this uh this
[18:01] Brandham tabernacle and the
[18:02] construction. And then he gets into his
[18:04] text. Hallelujah. Yeah, I think I'll
[18:07] just leave that up there. that might be
[18:08] helpful here uh by God's grace just so
[18:10] you can see
[18:12] now after the dedicational prayer
[18:13] brother Bam reads his text his text is
[18:15] Isaiah 53:1 so let's let's go there if
[18:18] you got your Bible just to read it give
[18:19] us another scripture it'll be setting up
[18:21] the next few services as I try to finish
[18:23] this thought I just you know it meant so
[18:26] much to me we've sang that song you know
[18:27] we've heard recognizing your day serpent
[18:29] seed and perfect faith and I thought how
[18:30] many people have actually listened to
[18:31] all those sermons and I knew for myself
[18:33] it' been a while since I listened to
[18:35] those sermons right because I'm usually
[18:37] listening to the one I'm preaching on by
[18:38] God's grace. So, I hope this was a
[18:40] blessing here to go back and uh listen
[18:42] to these quotes from these sermons.
[18:45] Uh Isaiah 53:1, who hath believed our
[18:47] report and to whom is the arm of the
[18:50] Lord revealed? So, brother man makes a
[18:53] statement. He says, the one who believes
[18:57] is the one who has the revelation. Amen.
[19:00] That's what this verse is saying. Who's
[19:02] believed it? Who is it revealed to? The
[19:04] one who believes it has the revelation
[19:06] from God. Hallelujah.
[19:08] &gt;&gt; All right. And then he went to uh
[19:10] Matthew 11:25 and 26 that only the
[19:14] humble people catch the revelation of
[19:16] the gospel.
[19:17] &gt;&gt; Only the humble people can catch that
[19:19] revelation. Hallelujah. It's not given
[19:21] to the prideful. It's not given to the
[19:23] wise and the prudent. Right? It's given
[19:26] to humble people that can just believe
[19:27] the simple word of God.
[19:30] &gt;&gt; That's right. Now, brother, after he
[19:32] reads his text, he says, "Nobody likes
[19:33] to sing like Christians does."
[19:36] Brother said, "We love singing, but
[19:39] we're in something else now. We're in
[19:40] the word." Now, he's talking about these
[19:42] these uh revival services coming up. He
[19:45] says, "We love singing, but we're in
[19:46] something different now." He says,
[19:48] "Let's stay with that word. We're in
[19:49] teaching." And you can realize what a
[19:51] strain it is on me. So, Brother
[19:54] starting, he's starting this week of
[19:55] services with one, two, three, four,
[19:57] five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10
[19:58] services he preaches in a row. Now, I'
[20:01] I've never even got close to that. Not
[20:03] even close. I preached maybe three days
[20:05] in a row, right? But I've never preached
[20:08] 10 sermons in a row. But he calls this
[20:10] upcoming week, this is going to be a lot
[20:12] of teaching.
[20:14] He says, "And you can realize what a
[20:17] great strain it is on me. If I teach the
[20:19] wrong thing, I'm going to have to answer
[20:21] for it." Now, let's stop there just a
[20:23] moment. And while you while you're
[20:24] there, go to James chapter 3:1, if you
[20:26] got your Bible.
[20:28] This is something that gets
[20:29] misunderstood in the message just
[20:30] because I hear preachers use it the
[20:32] wrong way. Church, if we answer for
[20:34] something, it's not like a mistake we
[20:37] made. It's not going to be for
[20:38] condemnation.
[20:40] &gt;&gt; It's going to be for just a loss of
[20:42] reward.
[20:43] &gt;&gt; Does everybody understand?
[20:45] &gt;&gt; I just want you to catch that. You know,
[20:47] the Bible said there's no condemnation
[20:48] to them that are in Christ Jesus.
[20:50] &gt;&gt; But yeah, brother Ram says, "I'm going
[20:51] to have have to answer if I make a
[20:53] mistake." Well, what is that? That's
[20:55] answering at the judgment seat of Christ
[20:57] for rewards,
[20:59] &gt;&gt; right? So, as a father, if I make a
[21:01] mistake or as a husband, if I make a
[21:03] mistake or as a pastor, if I make a
[21:05] mistake, yes, I'm going to have to
[21:06] answer for it. Now, the punishment or
[21:08] the the the punishment's already been
[21:09] taken care of on the cross.
[21:12] &gt;&gt; But I have to face that and realize,
[21:14] okay, I made a mistake there, but thank
[21:15] God for his mercy. I I missed out on a
[21:17] little reward, or maybe I missed out on
[21:19] a lot of reward, but I'm forgiven and
[21:21] I'm still a part of the kingdom of God.
[21:23] Hallelujah.
[21:24] &gt;&gt; Like, you you have verses on both sides,
[21:26] right? You know, we have to answer. We
[21:28] all stand before the judgment seat of of
[21:29] Christ. Then you have verses there's no
[21:31] condemnation. Which one is it?
[21:34] &gt;&gt; Well, it's both. All of our sins are
[21:36] forgiven, but we got to answer for the
[21:37] mistakes that we made.
[21:39] &gt;&gt; In other words, we will realize, oh, I
[21:41] made a mistake there, and so I missed
[21:43] out on a reward by God's grace. Right?
[21:45] That's what Lot Lot's going to see.
[21:46] Lot's the perfect example. He had all
[21:48] those family members, and he's going to
[21:49] realize, wow, I have no reward. I missed
[21:52] out on everything because I got too
[21:53] involved with the cares of the world. I
[21:56] got too involved with Sodom and
[21:57] Gomorrah. I forgot about the promised
[21:59] son. I forgot about the seed of Abraham.
[22:01] Hallelujah.
[22:02] &gt;&gt; In other words, got mixed up in
[22:04] denominations and money. And he got
[22:06] mixed up in those things instead of
[22:08] focusing on the seed of Abraham. Amen.
[22:10] The coming of the promised son.
[22:12] Hallelujah.
[22:14] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[22:16] Now, uh James 3:1 and2 James here. Ah,
[22:20] that's a great name. James, wonderful
[22:22] name. My brethren, be not many masters.
[22:24] Now that means teachers if you look it
[22:26] up in the uh Greek. So there shouldn't
[22:29] be lots of teachers knowing that we
[22:31] shall receive the greater condemnation.
[22:33] So a lot of pastors are teachers, right?
[22:36] Uh God has given them uh numerous gifts
[22:38] to teach and preach. And then we know
[22:41] the evangelists, they're the ones who
[22:42] travel, right? We know the five-fold
[22:44] ministry. Apostles, they they're sent by
[22:46] God out. Prophets can be a local church
[22:48] or they can they can kind of go anywhere
[22:50] by the grace of God. But especially
[22:52] pastors, you know, they and and
[22:54] teachers, they'll be judged more
[22:56] strictly because they're the ones giving
[22:58] out the word of God.
[23:01] &gt;&gt; But listen, church, you you have two
[23:02] promises. You have a promise. God will
[23:04] use the teaching gift in my life and
[23:06] Simon's life and Irvin's life and all
[23:08] the upcoming brothers, right? You have a
[23:10] promise. God will use their teaching
[23:11] gift. But you also have a promise in the
[23:13] book of First John that says, "You have
[23:15] no need that any man teach you because
[23:17] you have the anointing in your life as
[23:20] well."
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, what am I saying? We get both.
[23:22] If the preacher gets something wrong,
[23:24] then you've got the Holy Spirit in order
[23:25] to correct that and believe it right.
[23:28] And most cases, church, it's just going
[23:29] to be a minor.
[23:31] &gt;&gt; If it's a major, you better go talk to
[23:32] the pastor one-on-one, right? If it's a
[23:34] major and get it right back in line, but
[23:37] if it's a minor, well, you can agree to
[23:38] disagree and still have the love of God
[23:40] in your heart.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the preachers will be judged
[23:43] more strictly because they're the ones
[23:45] teaching the word of God.
[23:47] &gt;&gt; Well, I tell you, I missed those Sunday
[23:48] night sermons. I can't wait to get some
[23:49] more questions from my church.
[23:50] Hallelujah. It's been a long time since
[23:52] we had some questions. I can't wait.
[23:53] What is everybody thinking about all
[23:54] these months? I wonder about that
[23:55] sometimes. What are they thinking? What
[23:57] am I What are they gonna ask me, brother
[23:59] Chris? Oh, yeah. You got a question?
[24:01] Okay. Well, does it relate to this? Can
[24:03] I answer it real quick?
[24:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[24:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[24:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. That That's the balance. Yeah.
[24:20] He said, "Doesn't Yeah. The Bible said
[24:21] he throws our sins to the sea of
[24:22] forgetfulness as far as the punishment
[24:24] for them. There's no condemnation.
[24:25] There's no guilt for them. But when we
[24:27] stand before the seat, you know, a lot
[24:29] of people are going to realize, oh, I I
[24:30] put too much emphasis on brother
[24:32] Brandon. I put too much emphasis on the
[24:34] tapes, right? And they'll miss out on
[24:36] reward just like Lot Liz, oh my, my wife
[24:38] wasn't saved because of, you know,
[24:40] because of her own belief, but I went
[24:42] along with it and I didn't do enough to
[24:44] I didn't I should have done more to try
[24:46] to help her out, right? But they are
[24:48] they are saved. The Bible calls Lot a
[24:50] righteous soul and yet he was going to
[24:52] give his girls over to these bunch of
[24:54] evil abominable men. How does that make
[24:57] sense? Well, he's a human and he wasn't
[24:59] under the anointing of the Holy Ghost.
[25:00] He wasn't under the word of his hour,
[25:02] right? He left the prophet of God for
[25:04] that day. Uh so they can be saved, but
[25:07] they'll realize, brother, in the prince
[25:08] of God, they were this. They were wrong
[25:10] on these things and they missed out on
[25:11] rewards. Does that make sense? That's a
[25:14] good question. Give it to a class.
[25:15] That's a good question. Yeah. you that
[25:18] that's what the Bible says. They'll the
[25:20] Bible says they'll they'll get the deeds
[25:21] done in their body, but they'll also not
[25:24] get the they'll not also reap the
[25:26] benefits that they could have got as
[25:28] well.
[25:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah, great question, brother. Great
[25:30] question. Sorry. Yeah, wonderful
[25:32] question, brother. Isaiah 53. Yes, there
[25:35] we go. Okay, now James 3:1, uh, they'll
[25:37] receive the greater condemnation for in
[25:39] many things we offend all. So, this is
[25:41] the first century. James wrote the first
[25:43] book of the New Testament that was
[25:45] actually written down. The gospels
[25:47] weren't written down till 20 or 30 years
[25:49] later after Jesus had left the earth.
[25:52] James was the first written New
[25:54] Testament epistle written on paper and
[25:57] scroll. And he said in many things we
[26:00] offend all. So listen church, I'm going
[26:01] to offend you sometimes. Pray for me.
[26:03] Amen.
[26:04] &gt;&gt; Come to me if I make a mistake. Come to
[26:06] me. Talk to my face. Amen. Come talk to
[26:08] me by God's grace. Let let me know.
[26:10] We'll talk it over. Maybe you
[26:11] misunderstood. Maybe I misunderstood
[26:13] something. But surely if the presence of
[26:14] God is here, he'll bring us into sweet
[26:16] harmony of the Holy Spirit.
[26:18] &gt;&gt; Right? We can say I can say sorry or you
[26:20] can say sorry. Surely God will bring us
[26:22] right back into correction because
[26:23] preachers offend in awe. And I'm just
[26:25] going to share this because I don't know
[26:26] if I'll get to this. You know, there
[26:29] there's all these big uh message
[26:30] conventions all year round, right? I
[26:32] listened to one of them recently and
[26:33] this evangelist, he's a good man and
[26:35] many and I even listened to the
[26:36] testimony service after the convention
[26:38] and there was many many testimonies of
[26:40] God helping people. But for me as when I
[26:42] listen to it, I hear a lot of mistakes.
[26:46] He offended in many things. And let me
[26:49] give you some examples. He said God he
[26:51] said deity is not in heaven. Deity is on
[26:53] earth. Now can you imagine a preacher of
[26:56] the gospel saying that? In other words,
[26:58] God's not in heaven. God's on earth.
[27:00] Well then what's going on in heaven?
[27:02] &gt;&gt; And who's interceding for your sins in
[27:04] heaven?
[27:05] &gt;&gt; You have no intercessor if he's not in
[27:08] heaven. And the church said
[27:09] &gt;&gt; you have to have a lamb blood you have
[27:11] to have something in heaven
[27:14] &gt;&gt; and church hundreds of message pre
[27:17] people up all the preachers up standing
[27:18] saying amen and can you imagine me I'm
[27:20] like
[27:22] &gt;&gt; you've offended all you're offending but
[27:24] everybody accepts it and then brother
[27:26] they still get the anointing and many
[27:28] healings and testimonies afterwards.
[27:29] That shows God looks past all of our
[27:31] mistakes.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; He looks at the intents of our heart
[27:35] &gt;&gt; and then he says something. He says,
[27:37] "The message is the Bible." A few
[27:38] minutes later, he says, "We believe uh
[27:41] from Genesis to Revelation." Now,
[27:42] listen, just like we believe from 1947
[27:45] to 1965. Did everybody catch that? He
[27:49] just put every word on the tapes equal
[27:52] to the Bible.
[27:53] &gt;&gt; And Sister Nelman, I'm watching that and
[27:55] these preachers are saying, "Yeah,
[27:56] yeah." They're like pointing them. I'm
[27:58] like, "He just put the message on equal
[28:01] playing with the Bible. He just exalted
[28:03] every word on tape." And I'm like,
[28:05] "These people offend in all."
[28:07] &gt;&gt; Now, do I do I believe what they're
[28:08] saying about divine healing? Yes. Praise
[28:10] God. And people get saved and miracles
[28:12] and healed and healed bodies. I love
[28:14] that. But church, I'm trying to let you
[28:15] know, preachers offend many things.
[28:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:19] &gt;&gt; But God's not looking at our mistakes,
[28:20] Brother Chris. Amen.
[28:22] &gt;&gt; God's not looking at our mistakes. He's
[28:23] looking at our our desire, our desires
[28:25] to help people. Praise God.
[28:27] &gt;&gt; So, there's going to be parts of sermons
[28:29] that aren't exactly inspired. Although
[28:31] people might, it might sound like
[28:32] they're inspired, but it might be the
[28:34] human spirit trying to get back at
[28:35] somebody, right? Is that right? Because
[28:39] that because that's what the brother was
[28:40] doing. He was trying to get back on
[28:42] preachers on YouTube and and different
[28:43] preachers from South Africa, different
[28:45] things like that. Preachers with
[28:47] powerpoints, you know, they're they're
[28:48] taking their own personal agenda. Well,
[28:50] where does the Bible say a powerpoints
[28:52] of the devil, you see? And so, uh,
[28:55] people can offend in many things, but
[28:59] God will forgive all of our sins, but
[29:01] then we'll realize, well, I made some
[29:02] mistakes here, but thank God I'm saved.
[29:05] Right? And church, we got that
[29:07] assurance. We have that assurance. All
[29:09] that the father has given me will come
[29:11] to me. Hallelujah. And no man can pluck
[29:14] the believers out of the father's hand.
[29:16] Praise God.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Now, that's an assurance I love, brother
[29:18] Chris, because even in my mistakes, I I
[29:21] I couldn't cause somebody to fall. If
[29:23] somebody's going to be saved, they're
[29:24] going to be saved despite any mistakes I
[29:26] make.
[29:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus promised it. Praise
[29:29] God.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Ram says, and we know it. The
[29:31] Bible's true. Every man or woman has to
[29:33] answer to themselves before God. In
[29:35] other words, you'll stand there alone.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Did you believe the word? Did you
[29:39] receive the word?
[29:40] &gt;&gt; Right? And then preachers will stand
[29:42] there and they'll have to answer for
[29:43] their their sermons. Praise God.
[29:47] In many things we offend all. If any man
[29:50] offend not in word, the same as a
[29:51] perfect man. So see there's no perfect
[29:53] men and able also to bridle the whole
[29:55] body. So preachers especially are going
[29:58] to offend many things. You could go
[30:01] through the last year of my sermons. You
[30:03] can find numerous things I said wrong.
[30:05] Maybe I got this wrong. Maybe I got that
[30:06] wrong. But I'm trusting in the blood of
[30:08] Jesus Christ just like you are. That the
[30:11] blood of Jesus Christ will forgive all
[30:12] my sins. Praise God. And the spirit of
[30:15] God will bring me to a greater
[30:16] understanding that I can learn from my
[30:18] mistakes. I can gain more revelation.
[30:20] Hallelujah. And that's what I'm trusting
[30:22] in. So should we all trust in that.
[30:29] &gt;&gt; Yes. Hallelujah. Now, Brother says, "And
[30:31] God hid himself." Paragraph 95. Now, the
[30:34] services are long. Each one was about
[30:37] two and a half almost three, three and a
[30:38] half hours each one of these.
[30:42] They're going to be drawn out because
[30:43] it's a hard service. Much teaching and
[30:46] consecration.
[30:49] Wow. So all these sermons, we're going
[30:51] to be teaching sermons with much
[30:53] consecration. Other words, you got to
[30:55] you got to be consecrated. You got to
[30:56] forget about the things of the world.
[30:57] And you got to focus on God. Be
[30:59] consecrated to God. I'm not going to get
[31:01] distracted by uh all these uh news
[31:04] flashes. I'm not going to be distracted
[31:05] by anything else. I'm just going to
[31:06] consecrate myself unto God.
[31:09] Well, man, I thought it might make a
[31:10] text that we study this before we go
[31:12] into the great teachings of the seven
[31:14] seals. Three times he's already called
[31:17] these teachings.
[31:19] Okay.
[31:21] And now he says it again at the end of
[31:23] this God hiding himself in simplicity
[31:25] calls it teaching. He says, "Now this
[31:27] week we're going to get in some awful
[31:29] deep te awful deep teaching of the word
[31:31] of God." Amen.
[31:34] Awful deep teaching. And church, if you
[31:37] haven't listened to these lately or read
[31:38] them, you should. Right? If your family
[31:41] hasn't listened to these, you need to
[31:42] listen to them by God's grace. We're
[31:43] reading through the Bible right now, but
[31:44] after that, I'll probably go back to the
[31:46] seven seals. If you want some deep
[31:48] sermons, start listening to these
[31:50] because brother brings history together.
[31:52] He brings the church agents together.
[31:54] Then he brings the seven seals together.
[31:57] And then he brings all his visions
[31:58] together in this last sermon. He shows
[32:00] seven vision, I'm sorry, seven dreams
[32:02] and visions people had to show here that
[32:05] the coming of the Lord was very soon.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And to show what God was
[32:10] doing. God gave him that vision of uh
[32:13] the vision of the snow white pyramid and
[32:15] the the sword of the king to show him
[32:17] that this was the fulfillment of
[32:18] Revelation 10 1-7.
[32:20] Oh, we're getting deep already. Amen.
[32:22] Deep things. Praise God.
[32:25] Hallelujah.
[32:27] The seven seals, he says, are awful deep
[32:29] teaching sermons. Praise God. Now, I
[32:33] want to read this quote, too, because
[32:34] these are all important quotes. And and
[32:36] I want you to be aware if you haven't
[32:37] listened to this, like I said, I hope
[32:38] you would go listen to God hiding
[32:40] himself in simplicity before the seven
[32:42] seals. There's one right after the seven
[32:43] seals. So, uh I think it was one day
[32:46] after this. No, it was maybe it's the
[32:47] weekend after this. Brother preached in
[32:49] Albuquerque, New Mexico. That's a
[32:50] phenomenal sermon. If you want to hear
[32:52] how to receive the baptism of the Holy
[32:53] Ghost, listen to that one. It's from
[32:55] April 1963. God hiding himself in
[32:58] simplicity. Listen to the last 45
[33:00] minutes. He talks about how to receive
[33:02] the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a beautiful uh I played it
[33:07] years ago. I remember when brother Kevin
[33:08] was here. Remember brother brother Kevin
[33:09] and sister Marie? I played it when they
[33:11] were here. Uh I think I played it re
[33:13] maybe not recently but I played it since
[33:15] then as well. Hallelujah. Now brother
[33:18] Ram says this is he said this service is
[33:20] just a little service but it will blend
[33:22] with the rest of them. So listen to
[33:24] every word. Catch it. And then if you're
[33:27] taking it on the tapes then you stay
[33:29] right with the tape teaching. Okay.
[33:31] Okay, now here's where the
[33:32] Jeffersonville will really h they'll try
[33:33] to hammer me. They'll say, "Brother Ram
[33:35] said, stay with the tape teaching." He
[33:37] did. But what did he say next? Everybody
[33:41] say next. Ready? Next. What do you say
[33:43] next? Don't say nothing but what the
[33:45] tape says. Just say exactly what the
[33:47] tape says now. Because some of those
[33:48] things, we're going to understand a
[33:50] whole lot of this now. Why it's
[33:51] misunderstood. And you be sure, just say
[33:53] what the tape says. Hallelujah.
[33:57] Now
[33:59] then he says, "See, and you be sure,
[34:01] don't say nothing else because I don't
[34:03] say that on my own. It's him that says
[34:04] it." So brother Bram says, "God revealed
[34:06] him and showed him that they need to say
[34:09] what's on the tapes." Hallelujah. Now
[34:12] church, anyone who listens to me long
[34:13] enough, you're going to realize Brother
[34:15] Bram has lots of tapes
[34:17] &gt;&gt; and he said lots of different things on
[34:19] lots of different topics. Hallelujah.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Because recently I found this quote.
[34:24] Brother said you'll the sinners will
[34:26] burn an in eternal hell.
[34:30] He says they'll burn in an eternal.
[34:32] Well, I thought hell wasn't eternal.
[34:33] It's not. He just made a mistake.
[34:36] &gt;&gt; But then there's other ones he says
[34:37] hell's not eternal. So which ones? Well,
[34:39] I want to say what the tapes say. You
[34:41] see how you you still got to rightly
[34:42] divide the word of God.
[34:44] &gt;&gt; You got to listen to the tapes and see
[34:46] which one lines up with the Bible.
[34:48] That's the one you take,
[34:50] &gt;&gt; right? And then then I when I'm
[34:53] preaching just the Bible, then I am
[34:55] saying just what's on the tapes. That's
[34:56] scriptural.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, there's so many
[35:01] examples. I think I was up to 90
[35:02] examples or hundred examples where I
[35:04] have a brother just making Bible
[35:05] mistakes. So proving again, not every
[35:07] word is thus sayith the Lord. But under
[35:09] trying to understand what did he say?
[35:11] Why did he say just say what the tapes
[35:13] say? Now he says it later
[35:16] uh down in this paragraph.
[35:18] He says, "So many times there'll be
[35:20] confusion. People raise up and say,
[35:22] 'Well, so and so said it meant so and
[35:24] so." Just leave it the way it is. That's
[35:26] the way we want the Bible. Just say what
[35:27] the Bible says. That's the way we want
[35:29] it. Don't put no interpretation to it.
[35:32] It's already interpreted. So, here's the
[35:35] point Brother Ram's making. Don't put
[35:37] your own ideas to the tapes,
[35:40] &gt;&gt; right? Don't interject your own idea.
[35:42] Don't try to figure it out yourself. But
[35:44] we are supposed to prove all things.
[35:46] We're supposed to take what's on the
[35:47] tapes, right? and go search the Bible
[35:49] and make sure it's in the Bible.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; Everybody got that?
[35:52] &gt;&gt; I mean, if you've been around me long
[35:54] enough, you you you know that that's
[35:55] that's the way we believe it. It h it's
[35:57] the only way to believe it. Any other
[35:59] way is idolatry of William Brandham.
[36:02] Brother Graham taught us though the
[36:03] Bible's the absolute. The Bible is the
[36:06] final authority on every subject in our
[36:08] lives.
[36:10] &gt;&gt; But see, then we have to understand
[36:11] these quotes. Why would he say just say
[36:12] what the tape says, nothing else?
[36:14] Because he's talking to a people and
[36:15] church, think about this. 60ome years
[36:17] later, Brother Austin, 57 years later,
[36:20] Brother Austin, almost everybody,
[36:22] Brother Vang, that was every preacher
[36:23] almost that was in that congregation
[36:25] went crazy in false doctrine.
[36:28] Crazy. I'm just talking about crazy
[36:30] awful doctrines.
[36:32] Awful. Uh like the one brother named
[36:34] Junior Jackson. Now, he he seemed like a
[36:36] good man. Brother talks so highly of
[36:38] him, but he uh he started making
[36:40] prophecies about when the exact year of
[36:42] the coming of the Lord was and missed
[36:44] every time. I think 2005 was the first
[36:46] time and then he changed it just I mean
[36:50] and brother Ram saying just say what's
[36:51] on here. Does brother ever tell us on
[36:53] the tapes to make predictions about when
[36:54] the rapture is? So see he wasn't doing
[36:57] what brother Random said. Everybody got
[36:59] that?
[37:00] &gt;&gt; Joseph Coleman I showed you this picture
[37:01] one time from New York. He made that
[37:04] idea that the seven thunders were the
[37:05] seven virtues.
[37:07] And uh and he was waiting he was waiting
[37:11] for the last thunder. Everybody believed
[37:12] he was going to preach the last thunder
[37:14] of the brotherly kindness and then the
[37:16] rapture would take place.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; And church, it caused this awful and and
[37:20] remember our brethren from Pennsylvania,
[37:21] they were a part of that and God showed
[37:22] them the false prophecies in there and
[37:25] all the sin and brought them out of
[37:26] that. But those people are right there,
[37:29] church. I'd say like this. Very few are
[37:31] going to find the narrow road. Thank God
[37:33] if we can just stay right in the middle
[37:34] of the road
[37:36] &gt;&gt; and not develop. Brother Jesse's going
[37:38] off on some crazy doctrine. Brother so
[37:39] and so went on some crazy. Let's just
[37:41] say what the Bible says. Hallelujah.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:44] &gt;&gt; And church, you know me, I'm trying to
[37:45] preface it. If I say something uh that
[37:47] I'm not sure on, I'll say, "This is my
[37:49] thought. This is my own opinion."
[37:52] &gt;&gt; Even my own mother-in-law. Uh she told
[37:54] that to my wife. She says, "I like how
[37:55] Jesse says, "I could be wrong." Because
[37:57] she goes to a lot of churches and they
[37:58] don't say that. They they're absolutely
[38:00] right, Brother Austin, on everything. Uh
[38:02] no, they ain't.
[38:04] &gt;&gt; You ain't right on everything.
[38:06] &gt;&gt; I'm not right on everything.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; The church said,
[38:09] &gt;&gt; "I could be wrong. But we can't be wrong
[38:11] if we got thus sayith the Lord on water
[38:13] baptism and the mother harlot and the
[38:15] baptism of the Holy Ghost. Come on
[38:17] church. Amen. On modesty on women's
[38:19] hair, men's hair. We can't be wrong on
[38:21] that if we've got thus sayith the Lord.
[38:23] Hallelujah.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; But on these other topics, you know,
[38:25] like you know, there's so many other
[38:27] topics. Seven thunders, we don't have
[38:29] thus sayith the law on that. So, you
[38:31] know, different different things, you
[38:32] know, we uh we try to just do our best
[38:34] to the word of God. And you look at how
[38:37] how does a remember the Bible said
[38:39] follow the preachers's faith. So you
[38:40] should see my faith just uh with my
[38:43] faith. I'm just trying to stay close to
[38:44] the Bible as possible. Believe in the
[38:46] supernatural. Teach the word of God. I'm
[38:48] just trying to stay right in the middle
[38:49] of the road. And hopefully you can see
[38:50] that faith in my life that it produces
[38:52] good fruit in my life.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says follow those who
[38:57] preach the word of God to you.
[38:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Follow their faith. Watch how they
[39:02] uh live their lives in faith and copy
[39:04] that or follow that. Now, you don't have
[39:06] to do everything I do, but I'm just
[39:08] saying look at overall my faith and
[39:09] let's put let's all of us put faith in
[39:11] God's word.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:15] Hallelujah.
[39:17] Now, this is very beautiful. In this
[39:20] sermon, Brother Ram says, "Don't say
[39:22] nothing but what's on the tape." Now,
[39:24] look what he says a week later in
[39:26] questions and answers the morning. A
[39:28] week later,
[39:29] now Brother said, "These questions are
[39:31] really nice." So, now he's in this
[39:32] sermon. Brother Chris,
[39:35] he said, "I appreciate the wisdom in
[39:37] things."
[39:39] He says, "If you have a different
[39:41] interpretation and believe that your
[39:43] idea of it's right, just go right
[39:46] ahead."
[39:48] I'm going to read that again. Everybody
[39:50] catch it. He's saying, "Don't say
[39:52] anything more at this tape. Say over
[39:53] here." And over here, he says, "If you
[39:55] have a different idea, just go right
[39:58] ahead. That won't hurt." Let's say that
[40:00] won't hurt. Ready? that won't well here
[40:02] he here he says don't say anything but
[40:04] what I say and here he says well if you
[40:06] got a different idea that won't hurt
[40:09] you see how people are so unbalanced
[40:11] especially Jeffersonville I'm talking
[40:12] about just and now these goat preachers
[40:14] about you know I I don't say that mean
[40:16] I'm just saying like they're so
[40:17] overbalanced with uh the the the the
[40:20] message of ser the sermons of brother
[40:21] being equal to the Bible
[40:25] and I I'll play that quote you know it
[40:27] won't hurt if you disagree or you you
[40:29] see things a little differently brother
[40:30] Vang Sister Case, you see things a
[40:32] little differently. That's okay. That
[40:34] won't hurt as long as it's a minor
[40:36] topic,
[40:38] right?
[40:41] Hallelujah.
[40:42] He says that won't hurt because there's
[40:44] not only but one or two of them that
[40:47] pertains anything to salvation.
[40:51] Amen. So, what is the what's the major
[40:53] thing we need to agree on? How do you
[40:54] get saved?
[40:56] How do you get saved? Repent of your
[40:58] sins. be baptized in the name of Jesus
[41:00] Christ.
[41:01] &gt;&gt; And if you accept that, if you truly
[41:02] repent of your sin, you'll do everything
[41:04] in your strength to leave sin behind
[41:07] &gt;&gt; because you you're thankful Jesus died
[41:09] for your sins. He was cursed with the
[41:11] punishment you deserve and he gave you
[41:13] his righteousness.
[41:15] You'll be happy to serve God. You'll be
[41:17] happy to obey the word of God because
[41:19] Jesus took all your sins. Now, I'll say
[41:21] like this. He gave you a new heart.
[41:24] &gt;&gt; And that's a heart that loves the word
[41:25] of God.
[41:31] That won't hurt because there's not only
[41:33] but one or two of them that pertains to
[41:35] anything to salvation.
[41:37] Just say what the tapes say. Don't don't
[41:39] put your own opinion to it. Oh, it won't
[41:41] hurt if you dis disagree.
[41:45] Does that surprise anybody? It doesn't
[41:46] surprise me because I I listen to
[41:47] brother with honest heart. These other
[41:50] people from Tabernacle, they won't they
[41:52] don't listen with an honest heart. They
[41:54] just hear what they want to hear.
[41:56] They can't be taught more of the truth
[41:58] of God. They just take the quotes they
[42:01] want to hear and they won't go back to
[42:03] the word of God. But God wants us to
[42:05] take everything back to the word of God.
[42:09] Brother says most of the questions is
[42:11] asked on the other side of the rapture
[42:13] of the church. Okay? So most of the
[42:16] questions that morning he says weren't
[42:18] even about salvation. So if you got a
[42:20] different opinion, go ahead. He says
[42:22] that won't hurt. And church, one time I
[42:25] think I told you I listed over 110
[42:28] preaching topics of brother Brandham and
[42:30] I agreed with the we'd say the goat
[42:32] preachers. I agree with them on 97%. You
[42:35] would think brother Vanga 97 would be
[42:37] pretty good. My goodness, we see 97% in
[42:40] what accord. And that's still not enough
[42:42] for them, right? Because why? Because
[42:44] they have fear. They have insecurities.
[42:46] They got pride. It's never enough. and
[42:49] the things I disagreed on like
[42:50] interracial marriage and ministers
[42:52] marriage requirements all these minors
[42:54] and on that that's what they get up most
[42:55] upset about see because they've they've
[42:58] exalted theirelves in many things we
[43:01] offend all it's not even related to
[43:04] salvation hallelujah
[43:09] I trust everybody's hearing me this
[43:10] morning by God's grace amen now look
[43:12] what brother says in 1961 questions and
[43:14] answers now not 63 but two years earlier
[43:17] brother Ram said And these answers are
[43:19] not infallible
[43:24] because the scriptures is infallible.
[43:27] Thank you, brother Brandham, for
[43:28] clearing that up for us. Hallelujah. In
[43:31] this day, preachers are saying, "Oh, I
[43:34] believe every word from 47 to 65, just
[43:36] like I believe every word from Genesis
[43:38] to Revelation. Thank you, brother Ram,
[43:39] for sharing that you're not infallible."
[43:42] Because now we can see these preachers,
[43:43] they got something wrong, right? They're
[43:46] offending. No. And but does God bless
[43:48] their gifts? Yes. And I'm glad God
[43:50] blesses their I'm glad message people
[43:52] get victory and revival. I'm glad they
[43:54] get healed, Brother Vang. But I also
[43:56] want them to come up and get some
[43:57] teaching as well. Praise God. Because
[43:59] look at us. Are we healthy? Yes. You're
[44:01] in the house of God. You know, I was
[44:02] thinking about that. Think how many
[44:04] healthy people we have in our church.
[44:05] Almost everybody's healthy.
[44:08] So if if God looks at our church and
[44:10] everybody's healthy, do you think he's
[44:11] going to have me preach on divine
[44:12] healing all the time and try to have
[44:14] prayer lines for divine healing if
[44:15] everybody's healthy? What do you think?
[44:19] Do you remember brother asked brother
[44:21] brother asked right here how many wants
[44:22] a a prayer or a healing service at the
[44:24] end of the at the end of the week he
[44:26] said and he said almost every hand went
[44:28] up.
[44:30] Now maybe sometime I should ask our
[44:31] church raise your hand if you want a
[44:32] healing service because you're sick.
[44:34] Maybe I should do that sometime. Right?
[44:38] Does that make sense? Like in other
[44:40] words God is going to give us the
[44:41] sermons that we need. If I start seeing
[44:43] people get sick then yes. My goodness,
[44:45] I'll pray, you know, I want to pray and
[44:47] say, "God, give me a message that will
[44:48] bring healing to the people that will
[44:50] raise their faith." Brother Rod told me
[44:52] up in Kaoga Falls, uh, where we used to
[44:55] live, brother
[44:57] in the 1920s and 30s, you know, his
[45:00] friends told him, and there there's
[45:01] articles about as well, every Friday
[45:02] night was miracle night at this
[45:04] Pentecostal church and is miracle and
[45:07] healing night. Now, they didn't get a
[45:08] miracle every Friday night, but there
[45:10] were so many sick people. There were so
[45:12] many people needing miracles, they had
[45:13] to have miracle services.
[45:15] Hallelujah.
[45:18] &gt;&gt; So, we look to the Holy Spirit and say,
[45:20] "Holy Spirit, you know, I look to the
[45:22] Holy Spirit, Lord, what do you want me
[45:23] to preach? What do you want me to put it
[45:24] on my heart?" And now, church, how many
[45:26] times have I come here, I preach, and
[45:27] somebody tell me that's exactly what I
[45:29] needed to hear after the service. And it
[45:31] wasn't on divine healing because
[45:33] everybody was healthy. Praise God.
[45:36] Hallelujah. It's it and church. It's
[45:37] just like the letters that Paul wrote to
[45:40] the Ephesus church. Did Paul and think
[45:43] church, think just a second. Did God
[45:45] have Paul write to Ephesians about their
[45:47] 12 or the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit?
[45:49] Yes or no?
[45:50] &gt;&gt; No. Good Caris. Good. Caught that. No.
[45:53] Because God's going to give the church
[45:55] what it needs.
[45:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Right. Hallelujah. Everybody see that?
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Did God have to uh preach to the
[46:02] Ephesians about legalism? No. That was
[46:05] the Galatian church.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; So God's going to give us what we have
[46:10] need of at our church. If I just confess
[46:12] my sins every day, Brother Chris, if I
[46:14] just get on my face and pray and go in
[46:16] my prayer closet and ask God to give me
[46:18] what does the church need, I'm expecting
[46:20] God to do it.
[46:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You should, too. Hallelujah.
[46:24] And as as we saw a couple Wednesdays
[46:25] ago, you should pray for me and pray for
[46:27] all the preachers. Pray for Brother
[46:28] Simon this week that God will give him
[46:30] the words that we need to hear.
[46:33] And church, just as a reminder, I
[46:34] preached on Job on CAMs on Sunday
[46:36] morning and it really helped me this
[46:38] week. There was some mornings, Malachi,
[46:40] I was in my prayer closet and I was
[46:42] saying, "Let the blood of Jesus Christ
[46:43] cover Lydia. Let the blood of Jesus
[46:45] Christ cover Malachi." And I went
[46:47] through every one of my children just
[46:49] like Job. I'm on my knees, Brother Vang
[46:51] in tears saying, "Oh God, cover Aacia
[46:53] with the blood of Christ." Can I go
[46:55] through all of them? Cover Haven. Cover
[46:57] Caris. Cover Victoria. I did it this
[46:59] week on multiple occasions. What a good
[47:02] reminder. Amen. I cover Genevie with the
[47:04] blood of Jesus Christ. I cover Zion. I
[47:06] cover baby Tulsi and I said I cover my
[47:08] wife. I cover me. Let the blood of Jesus
[47:11] Christ cover over all of us. Hallelujah.
[47:14] &gt;&gt; And that's when we're like Job, brother
[47:15] Chris.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; That's what Job did essentially every
[47:18] morning. He would burn burn an animal,
[47:20] kill an animal, burn it as a sacrifice,
[47:22] and say, "God, if my children have
[47:23] sinned, forgive them." Amen.
[47:26] &gt;&gt; And God looked down from heaven and
[47:27] said, "That's the greatest man there is
[47:28] on the earth." Now, I'm not trying to
[47:31] I'm not calling myself great. You know,
[47:32] I'm not great. But what I'm saying is
[47:34] let's learn from Job. Let's be more
[47:36] sensitive to heaven.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Let's be more like Job.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:41] &gt;&gt; With that kind of faith. And remember,
[47:43] God looked down and called him the
[47:44] greatest man before he'd even had any
[47:46] supernatural experience.
[47:49] &gt;&gt; He hadn't seen God in a whirlwind. He
[47:51] hadn't seen the I know my redeemer will
[47:52] live. He didn't see the vision of the
[47:53] redeemer. He'd seen none of that. And
[47:55] yet still, God said he's a man. He's the
[47:57] most perfect man on earth because he
[47:59] hates evil.
[48:01] &gt;&gt; So, brother Chris, I want to encourage
[48:02] you, brother Austin probably does it,
[48:03] too. And Lena,
[48:05] with each person in your family, pray
[48:07] the blood of Jesus Christ to cover over
[48:09] them.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; That'll take three to five minutes. You
[48:11] say, "How can I pray 10 minutes? How can
[48:13] I pray 30 minutes?" That'll take at
[48:14] least five minutes.
[48:17] &gt;&gt; And then you'll be feeling so good after
[48:18] that. You say, "God, help me at the job
[48:19] and help me, Jesus. Help me with my
[48:20] struggles. Oh, send revival to my heart.
[48:22] Amen. Oh, send us miracles. Amen. Send
[48:25] us revelation. Hallelujah.
[48:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; Start putting the blood over each and
[48:30] every one. Every person you want to see
[48:32] saved, ask that the blood of Jesus
[48:34] Christ. Now, where did I get that from?
[48:35] Brother Rod and Job.
[48:37] Rod said it. Now, you remember this, and
[48:39] he's going to give his testimony here. I
[48:40] think it's coming up on Well, we haven't
[48:42] set the date, but it's going to be on a
[48:43] Sunday night, maybe in September.
[48:47] Remember, I think I told you this. Rod
[48:49] was a a corrections officer in a prison
[48:51] and he was he was seeing so many demons.
[48:53] He got he he was shook up. So he had to
[48:56] get up at 3:30 every morning, brother
[48:58] Chris, to read his Bible for 45 minutes
[49:01] and pray for 45 minutes so he could go
[49:03] into that that prison and change the
[49:06] atmosphere. He said they they blasted
[49:09] the name of Jesus all day. He said
[49:10] within six months time of praying,
[49:12] Sister Beatatric, they only did it once
[49:14] or twice per day.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; Talk about a change of atmosphere.
[49:19] Now, who would like who would like the
[49:21] the second atmosphere more than the
[49:22] first atmosphere? I would.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; But what' it take? It took applying the
[49:25] blood of Jesus Christ.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; And he's telling Malachi, do the same.
[49:29] Yes. Yes, sir. Amen. He has to do that
[49:31] on his job. Hallelujah. Each one of us
[49:34] can do that on our job or in our home,
[49:36] girls. Right. Even if you're
[49:37] homeschooling, you can apply the blood
[49:38] to your house, to your siblings.
[49:44] That's right.
[49:46] Brother man says, he says, 'Now the tape
[49:49] is to be kept now. Anybody that would
[49:51] want it, why, they could have it. But
[49:52] now I know the scriptures are
[49:53] infallible, but my answers are not
[49:56] infallible.
[49:57] I'm sure everybody understands that.
[50:00] Yes, brother Ram, everyone that's born
[50:02] again understands that.
[50:06] &gt;&gt; But Sister Beatatric, not everybody
[50:07] understands that because they're not
[50:09] born again. Let me read that again for
[50:11] everybody.
[50:12] I know the scriptures are infallible,
[50:15] but my answers are not infallible.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Well, that means we got to take every
[50:21] question and answer, we got to take that
[50:23] back to the word as well. Yes, we do,
[50:25] brother Jesse. Amen. Hallelujah.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; Everything has to be taken back to the
[50:31] word of God. Now, we know with the thus
[50:33] sayith the Lord's, we don't necessarily
[50:35] have to because we've already proven all
[50:37] these thus sayith the Lords are right.
[50:39] Now, we might not not understand it,
[50:42] right? But if we if we're sincere before
[50:43] God, God will show us that the thus
[50:45] sayith the Lords are right.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother Brandham. I I'm sure I
[50:52] understand because I'm born again, but
[50:54] not everybody understands because
[50:55] they're not born again. They exalt your
[50:58] tapes, Brother Brandham, equal to the
[50:59] Bible. That's heresy. That's idolatry.
[51:04] And brother Bam says, And brother B
[51:07] Yeah. He says, "I'm sure everybody
[51:08] understands that if it's not infallible,
[51:11] then you have a right maybe to ask me at
[51:13] any time." And brother Ram later says in
[51:14] 1963, it's December of 63, questions and
[51:17] answers. Uh, Brother Ram says, he says,
[51:19] "You're duty bound whether you're the
[51:21] janitor," he said, or the deacon. Now,
[51:24] the janitor is like the lowest person in
[51:25] the church, right? The deacon is one of
[51:27] the higher people with a lot of
[51:28] responsibility. But the Ram says,
[51:30] "Whether you're the the deacon or the
[51:32] janitor," he said, "you're duty bound to
[51:34] come talk to me oneon-one if I make a
[51:36] mistake in the word of God,
[51:38] &gt;&gt; to keep the church clean."
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Right?
[51:43] So, this this is how a prophet Amen.
[51:45] This is how a real Bible-based prophet
[51:47] preaches to his church. Amen. Amen. I
[51:50] love it. Praise God. I love it. See, so
[51:53] we got we got one quote. Just say what
[51:55] the tape say, Sister Lena. Just don't
[51:57] add nothing to it. Just say what the
[51:58] tape say, sister. It's okay if you're
[52:00] different with me. It it don't pertain
[52:02] to salvation.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; My answers aren't infallible.
[52:07] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; All right.
[52:10] Now, church, that'll teach you. Anytime
[52:12] there's a question about something,
[52:13] brother Ram said, that'll teach you. And
[52:14] this and may the Holy Spirit give you
[52:16] this question. What else did brother
[52:18] Bram say about that topic?
[52:21] Right? Because a preacher will he, you
[52:22] know, he's he he might have a real burn
[52:24] for this or that. Like we said, you
[52:25] know, the thunders the uh the fourth
[52:28] work of grace. I made a video about that
[52:29] last week. They might have such a burden
[52:30] for their own, you know, little
[52:32] understanding. But there's other quotes
[52:34] on the subject as well
[52:37] or like the bride age. There's, I think,
[52:39] five quotes in 1965 where brother says,
[52:41] "We're not in Leodysia. We're in the
[52:43] bride age." And people have taken that
[52:45] and made it so crazy. They they've
[52:47] taken, "Oh, we're in some other age."
[52:48] And and now denominations can't be
[52:50] saved. We're the only ones that can be
[52:51] saved. There's churches in Ohio that
[52:53] believe that nonsense. You can only get
[52:56] saved through a message believer. What
[52:58] is that? That's a That's pride. Oh,
[53:00] you're not. They say you're And I got
[53:01] the videos, church. They say you're the
[53:03] ark of God now. Like, I'm not God. I'm
[53:07] not Jesus. I'm not the mercy seat. Am I
[53:09] his representative? Yes. Am I his
[53:11] offspring? Yes. Am I a child of God?
[53:13] Yes. But I'm not Christ. Hallelujah.
[53:16] &gt;&gt; I'm not.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; And you'll never find that in the Bible.
[53:19] That's this that's this uh constant
[53:21] thing that preachers will try to take
[53:23] things too far just to maybe make the
[53:25] people excited, give them something new
[53:27] to hear. But remember, God makes all
[53:30] things new. Praise God.
[53:33] We're not to exalt our own thoughts and
[53:35] preach our own doctrines and so forth.
[53:38] We're to say what the Bible says. Praise
[53:40] God. Say what brother Ram says when it
[53:42] lines up with the Bible.
[53:45] That's made me even more awfully
[53:47] unpopular. That's okay, brother Vang. At
[53:48] least I got peace in my heart. Praise
[53:50] God. I will not worship William
[53:52] Brandham. I won't do it. I'm only
[53:54] worshiping Jesus Christ. Praise God.
[53:56] Hallelujah. And if people don't like
[53:57] that, they don't have to stay. They can
[53:58] go if they want to worship Brother
[53:59] Brandham. If they would exalt the tapes
[54:00] and make the tapes the absolute, they
[54:02] can do that if they want, but it won't
[54:03] happen here because Jesus Christ is the
[54:05] absolute. Hallelujah.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; And I'll stand if nobody else stands
[54:10] with me, and I know that's not the case,
[54:11] but brother Ram says that if nobody else
[54:13] will stand with me that the Bible's the
[54:14] absolute and not the taste, then I'll
[54:17] stand on that. Hallelujah.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; I'd rather stand on the word of God than
[54:21] anything else because Jesus said,
[54:22] "Heaven and earth shall pass away, but
[54:24] my word shall never pass away."
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. You've been a good
[54:30] audience. Praise God.
[54:32] How long have I been preaching? Oh, I
[54:34] reset my timer. What happened? How is
[54:37] that possible? Must be something.
[54:40] Now,
[54:42] remember, Brother Ram in 1964,
[54:45] questions and answers. Brother Ram said,
[54:46] "I I like the other day, I got something
[54:48] mixed up. I happen to hear it. It's
[54:50] caught in right there and it's on the
[54:52] tape and I'll probably hear from it."
[54:55] So, Brother Ram says, "I preach
[54:56] something wrong on tape." Now, how these
[54:58] people can say every word is thus thus
[55:00] say the Lord. The only way they can do
[55:02] that is with an evil demon spirit
[55:04] because brother Ram says, "I mix
[55:06] something up on the tape."
[55:08] And he said, if you can follow this,
[55:10] after the feast of first fruits, church,
[55:12] so remember it goes Passover, unleavened
[55:15] bread, first fruits, Friday, Saturday,
[55:17] Sunday. And the church said,
[55:19] &gt;&gt; seven weeks from that first fruits was
[55:21] Pentecost.
[55:23] In that sermon, brother made a mistake
[55:25] and he says those seven weeks represent
[55:27] the seven church ages. Oh, wait, that
[55:30] doesn't sound right. And brother says it
[55:32] wasn't because the feast of weeks
[55:34] represented Pentecost and the church
[55:36] said,
[55:38] Hallelujah. So, Brother Man makes the
[55:40] mistake. He said, "I got it mixed up and
[55:42] I'm probably going to hear from it."
[55:44] That's why I like preachers that will
[55:45] ask questions. I like that. Brother
[55:47] Jesse, did you mean to say it that way
[55:49] or maybe I heard it wrong. Did you mean
[55:51] to say that? I like that. Somebody can
[55:53] humble themselves.
[55:56] Brother explains it and he says, "Oh,
[55:57] it's a great teaching there. I didn't
[55:59] touch the edge of it, but if you happen
[56:01] to catch that on tape, remember, look in
[56:04] the Bible."
[56:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:06] So, brother Am admits, "I made a
[56:08] mistake." He said, "If you caught that
[56:10] mistake, look in your Bible." Church,
[56:11] I'm glad if we can catch some mistakes.
[56:14] &gt;&gt; That's not all we're looking for. That's
[56:15] what that's what uh accusers of brother
[56:17] Brandham, they're looking for every
[56:19] mistake. I'm not looking for mistakes.
[56:20] But the Holy Spirit will help me catch
[56:22] mistakes so I can teach things the right
[56:24] way so I can look in the Bible.
[56:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:29] That's what the Holy Spirit wants me to
[56:30] do, saints. Look in the Bible.
[56:34] Is that right?
[56:37] So the Holy Spirit will not say just
[56:39] believe everything on the tape. Even if
[56:41] you don't understand it, just believe
[56:42] everything. The Holy Spirit will not say
[56:43] that. The Holy Spirit will say, "Look in
[56:44] the Bible."
[56:47] &gt;&gt; So you going to Who? Who you going to
[56:48] believe? Famous preachers or the Holy
[56:50] Spirit. I'm going to believe the Holy
[56:51] Spirit.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Look in the Bible. Now, I appreciate
[56:54] preachers. They got a place. They're
[56:56] going to have to answer for a lot, too.
[56:57] If they make mistakes, I'm going have to
[56:58] answer for my mistakes, too. As far as,
[57:00] like I said, losing any reward, right?
[57:03] We have to answer for that. Answer for
[57:05] everything we've done in the body.
[57:08] But let's be so sensitive to the Holy
[57:09] Spirit where we can limit our mistakes
[57:12] and we can wait on the Lord till we're
[57:14] really sure about something.
[57:17] All right,
[57:19] what's the time on there? Oh, I'm not
[57:21] even an hour. Well, glory to God. Let's
[57:23] say praise the Lord, can we? Praise I
[57:25] thought I was already at a hour and a
[57:26] half. Oh my.
[57:30] Now brother is talking about uh the
[57:32] seven seals. This is in feast of
[57:34] trumpets 1964.
[57:36] He said immediately after the sword came
[57:38] in my hand. Remember talking about the
[57:39] sword of the king in Sabinhino Canyon.
[57:42] That was probably uh January or February
[57:45] 1963. I can't remember the exact one
[57:47] now. It's not coming to me. After he got
[57:49] the sword of the king, he said
[57:51] immediately after that the angels of the
[57:53] Lord appeared and told about the seven
[57:55] trumpets and of the seven seals. So let
[57:57] me go back to that picture.
[58:00] These are the angels of the Lord
[58:01] appearing to brother Random. After the
[58:02] angel of the Lord appeared, those seven
[58:03] angels, they told him about the seven
[58:05] seals that I was to return back here to
[58:07] Jeffersonville and preach the seven
[58:09] seals. And there, so there in the seven
[58:12] seals, if there if I've ever said
[58:14] anything that was inspired, it was in
[58:17] that.
[58:18] Okay. So after brother saw those angels,
[58:21] they sent him back and he comes here and
[58:24] preaches this. And brother Ram says, "If
[58:26] I ever said anything from the Holy
[58:28] Ghost, it was in this week right here."
[58:31] &gt;&gt; How many believe that now? If you
[58:33] believed it, you listen to it again.
[58:35] Right
[58:35] &gt;&gt; now, how many remember earlier this
[58:37] year, I did some teaching on the seven
[58:38] seals. Remember that when Claude and
[58:39] Patrick were coming? Remember I went
[58:41] through the first seal? I showed all the
[58:42] meanings of it. Remember the second
[58:43] seal? I showed all the mean. I got to
[58:45] the fourth and then we had the babies.
[58:47] Well, the mothers had the babies. I
[58:49] didn't have any baby, right? Moms went
[58:52] through all the labor, had the babies.
[58:54] But I was show brother Chris I showed
[58:56] these I show the symbols for all of
[58:57] these. Now we didn't get to those. We
[58:59] can do those maybe again when we
[59:00] resemble our Bible studies.
[59:03] Brother Ram said if I ever said anything
[59:06] from God it was during this week.
[59:09] And I love at the at the end of this one
[59:11] he's this is this one and the seventh
[59:13] seal. At both of these
[59:15] he finishes the seventh seal and he says
[59:17] he says uh that's the truth. He said
[59:19] that's thus sayith the Lord. Brother man
[59:22] preaches the revelation the second seal.
[59:23] He said, "That's thus sayith the Lord."
[59:25] He said, "If all these other prophecies
[59:27] are right, so will this be right because
[59:29] it's from the Holy Spirit."
[59:31] &gt;&gt; And then in this sermon, the seventh
[59:33] seal, Brother Ram says, "The word plus
[59:35] the church ages plus the history plus
[59:37] the seals." He said, "To the best of my
[59:39] understanding, it's thus sayith the
[59:41] Lord."
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Ah, what a statement. And you know my
[59:45] understanding, this was the first
[59:47] thunder. Amen. This was the second
[59:49] thunder, third thunder, fourth thunder,
[59:51] fifth thunder, thunder, sixth thunder,
[59:53] and the seventh thunder utter their
[59:54] voices. Hallelujah.
[59:56] Now, that's just my humble opinion. But
[59:58] I got quotes to back it up. Amen.
[1:00:01] Because what is the thunder? Read the
[1:00:03] Bible. A thunder is a voice of God. Now,
[1:00:06] again, I'm going to tell you, that's my
[1:00:08] understanding. I could be wrong, but
[1:00:10] that's so beautiful to me because
[1:00:11] because now now that the thunders
[1:00:13] Malachi utter their voices, now the open
[1:00:15] book can be given to the seventh angel.
[1:00:17] And now he can finish the mystery of
[1:00:19] God.
[1:00:21] So either this either e either the
[1:00:23] mystery is not finished or it's
[1:00:24] finished. I say it's finished.
[1:00:27] Hallelujah. Because brother Brandham
[1:00:29] said it's finished. And because we know
[1:00:31] the mysteries are fulfilled. We we know
[1:00:34] what they mean. We know what the mystery
[1:00:35] of the godhead is. The mystery of the
[1:00:37] seven church ages. We know what the
[1:00:39] mysteries are. God's voice thundered it
[1:00:41] out. And church, I received it. I hope
[1:00:44] you did, too. Praise God.
[1:00:46] If I ever said anything inspired, it was
[1:00:48] in that
[1:00:50] there where the angel of the Lord I
[1:00:53] guess I'll just keep doing that one
[1:00:56] said there where the angel Lord met us
[1:00:58] the Bible became a new Bible. Remember
[1:01:01] said the angel met him before he
[1:01:02] preached every sermon
[1:01:04] to give him the revelation of those
[1:01:06] sermons.
[1:01:09] The Bible become a new Bible. Now I tell
[1:01:11] this to my children but my wife would
[1:01:13] know too.
[1:01:15] I was raised in denomination. So I
[1:01:17] didn't I just I had one understanding of
[1:01:18] the Bible. But since I received the
[1:01:20] message, it's a brand new Bible. I'll
[1:01:23] say it like this. Malachi so Malachi
[1:01:25] understand and everybody it's brother
[1:01:27] Bang too. It's like brother Bang when we
[1:01:29] went to church when we were younger the
[1:01:30] Bible was just a story book but now it's
[1:01:33] a love letter.
[1:01:35] &gt;&gt; In other words, Noah's about me.
[1:01:37] Abraham's about me.
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Esther's about me. David's about me. We
[1:01:43] can we can gain all this wisdom. We get
[1:01:45] all this revelation and a lot of these
[1:01:47] types and shadows point to us.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Rebecca's about me. Amen. Glory.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Getting a wife ready for Isaac. That's
[1:01:55] about us. Hallelujah.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; That's not how it was, Brother Vang.
[1:01:58] When we grew up, was it? That wasn't
[1:02:00] about that. They They didn't preach
[1:02:01] Rebecca and say, "This is about the
[1:02:03] rapture." They preach Rebecca and say,
[1:02:05] "Okay, you should leave the things of
[1:02:06] the world and serve God. Let's all go
[1:02:09] home. Don't don't forget don't forget to
[1:02:12] get coffee on your way out." Our is
[1:02:14] don't forget to uh not spill your coffee
[1:02:16] here in in service, right? Because they
[1:02:18] bring coffee right into the sanctuary.
[1:02:20] Oh my goodness. But now it's a brand new
[1:02:24] Bible. The Bible's totally new, Sister
[1:02:26] Beatatric.
[1:02:28] It's about Christ and the church. Amen.
[1:02:30] That that's what the Bible calls a great
[1:02:32] mystery. That's one thing Simon was
[1:02:33] preaching that I really enjoyed. The the
[1:02:35] mystery of Christ in the church is a
[1:02:37] great mystery. It's not a small mystery.
[1:02:39] It's a great mystery. Yes.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; The unity of Jesus Christ and the church
[1:02:44] is a great mystery.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; So other words, we're going to be so
[1:02:48] blessed by knowing all the union that we
[1:02:50] have with Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[1:02:55] I can't even get through this quote.
[1:02:57] Hallelujah. The Bible becomes a new
[1:02:59] Bible. There it opened up and revealed
[1:03:01] all the things that the reformers and
[1:03:04] things have left out. It was the
[1:03:06] complete revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:03:08] altogether new to us
[1:03:11] but perfectly exactly with the scripture
[1:03:15] that was the word which has always been
[1:03:18] I was so inspired and directed. So
[1:03:22] brother said all these revelations about
[1:03:24] the seals gave us the complete
[1:03:26] revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:29] So now we know, brother Chris, Jesus
[1:03:31] Christ is not denominations
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; because they have traditions of men.
[1:03:35] Like Jesus said in Matthew 15, their
[1:03:37] traditions, their their creeds
[1:03:39] transgress the word of God. Like they
[1:03:41] sprinkle babies. That's not that's not
[1:03:43] going to do nothing for the baby. The
[1:03:45] baby can't repent of nothing. The baby,
[1:03:47] our little baby, Tulsi can't repent. She
[1:03:48] can't even say sorry. She can't even say
[1:03:50] she can't even say hallelujah or amen.
[1:03:52] How's she going to repent of her sins?
[1:03:55] It it's just it's it's ridiculous. But
[1:03:57] they but and they'll get mad. If you
[1:03:59] don't accept this, then we're mad at
[1:04:00] you. That shows they got a
[1:04:01] denominational spirit.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Now, some of them might have a good
[1:04:04] attitude. Thank God for that, right? But
[1:04:06] it all depends. But for us, the Bible
[1:04:09] became a new Bible. So, Brother Vang
[1:04:11] knows, you know, or Malachi know as I
[1:04:13] was growing up, it was tongues. Got a
[1:04:14] tongues, tongues, tongues, tongues,
[1:04:15] tongues. Well, when I received the
[1:04:16] message, it became a brand new Bible.
[1:04:18] Now, tongues is just one of the nine
[1:04:20] gifts of the Holy Spirit. It's not. It
[1:04:22] took it took the the tongues down as the
[1:04:24] Holy Spirit and now it's just in our
[1:04:26] pockets as one of the gifts of the Holy
[1:04:28] Spirit.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; It became a brand new Bible. Jesus is
[1:04:32] not a tongue. Jesus is God. Amen.
[1:04:35] &gt;&gt; Does Jesus have a tongue? Yes.
[1:04:37] Hallelujah. But tongues doesn't mean
[1:04:39] you're born again. Tongues is one sign
[1:04:41] you've got a gift of God.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:45] Oh, it's a brand new Bible church. Oh,
[1:04:48] glory to God.
[1:04:52] And then brother Ram said in questions
[1:04:54] answers this morning, "Of all the times
[1:04:57] I've been behind the pulpit at the
[1:05:00] tabernacle, I have never never in any
[1:05:03] time of my ministry ever worked into the
[1:05:05] realms of God and the spiritual realms
[1:05:07] that it's been at this time."
[1:05:11] Yeah. It's beyond anything I ever did in
[1:05:14] any time of my ministry. Whoa. What did
[1:05:16] you say, brother Ram? I remember hearing
[1:05:18] that, Sister Lena, for the first time.
[1:05:19] I'm like, wait, what?
[1:05:22] He had uh 300,000 in India and a bl a
[1:05:26] blind man received a sight and this is
[1:05:28] greater than that. As far as I know,
[1:05:30] nobody received their their physical
[1:05:31] sight. Nobody received their physical
[1:05:34] sight in these meetings. But how many
[1:05:35] received their spiritual sight?
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Amen.
[1:05:41] This was greater than 1950 at the
[1:05:43] Houston uh uh Houston Tabern not
[1:05:46] tabernacle. I can't remember the Houston
[1:05:49] uh museum auditorium
[1:05:51] when the pillar of fire came down Jesus
[1:05:53] in the spear form came down and took his
[1:05:56] picture with brother Brandham
[1:05:58] this was greater according to brother
[1:06:00] Ram this was the greatest services of
[1:06:02] his entire ministry
[1:06:05] because the angel was there every
[1:06:06] morning here's the first seal thus
[1:06:08] sayeth the Lord here's the second seal
[1:06:11] thus sayith the Lord third seal fourth
[1:06:14] seal fifth seal sixth seal seventh seal
[1:06:17] Here's the seals. Thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:25] It's beyond anything I ever did in my
[1:06:27] time of ministry in any meeting at
[1:06:30] anywhere like this. Mostly it's on
[1:06:32] healing. So says most of my other
[1:06:34] services are just about healing. He said
[1:06:36] but this is the revealing of truth by
[1:06:38] the same spirit. The same spirit.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:42] Now
[1:06:44] part of this you remember part of this
[1:06:45] are the four beasts right those are the
[1:06:48] four anointings on the first four seals
[1:06:50] right the four beasts and then also you
[1:06:52] also going to hear the work of the
[1:06:53] antichrist the four horse riders that's
[1:06:56] why this is so powerful brother Chris
[1:06:58] because we see the anointing that's
[1:07:00] supposed to be on the believer and it
[1:07:02] gives us strength to overcome the
[1:07:03] antichrist
[1:07:06] the antichrist was the right horse rider
[1:07:08] in the first seal and he's trying to
[1:07:10] deceive us into following Antichrist
[1:07:13] doctrine and creating our own doctrines
[1:07:16] of men. That's the first step of the
[1:07:18] Antichrist spirit. But what was the
[1:07:20] first step of the Holy Spirit? Give them
[1:07:22] lion like boldness. Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; The Bible said the righteous will be
[1:07:26] bold like a lion. Hallelujah.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:31] Church, I've seen it in my life, you
[1:07:33] know, as I preach even at brother Cams
[1:07:35] and even here. I preach so long, hour
[1:07:37] and a half.
[1:07:40] I preach so long I get bold and then
[1:07:42] when I'm bold then I'll pray and God
[1:07:44] will heal people like brother Jose
[1:07:45] praise God or brother Johnny when you
[1:07:48] come up for prayer. See that's the
[1:07:50] boldness. That's that anointing brother
[1:07:52] Chris. That's an anointing of the Holy
[1:07:53] Spirit. You stay on that anointing. It
[1:07:55] starts anointing you. Praise God. Or it
[1:07:57] might be the anointing of the axe to
[1:07:58] sacrifice more of your time to give your
[1:08:00] life away right to die out to self.
[1:08:03] Labor acts as a beast of labor.
[1:08:06] The man, the man anointing is wisdom of
[1:08:08] the Holy Spirit. God will anoint you
[1:08:10] with wisdom to so, okay, this is right.
[1:08:12] This is rightly dividing the word of
[1:08:13] truth. This is what you ought to do.
[1:08:15] It's the wisdom of God. And the last one
[1:08:17] is flying eagle. In other words, fly up
[1:08:19] into heavenly places. Dwell in heavenly
[1:08:22] places. See things that other people
[1:08:24] can't see. Amen. Have revelation that
[1:08:27] other you can see far off. Oh, it's
[1:08:28] perfect faith. Amen. Because faith is
[1:08:31] like binoculars. can see things a far
[1:08:33] off and an eagle can see things far off.
[1:08:36] It's perfect faith. It's revelation.
[1:08:38] Hallelujah.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my, I didn't see that all tied
[1:08:41] together like that.
[1:08:43] So, this is why the Bible becomes a new
[1:08:45] Bible. Now, we unmask Satan and we show
[1:08:48] the power and the anointing that we can
[1:08:51] walk under.
[1:08:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:55] So, what anointing are you walking under
[1:08:56] today, church? That's a good question.
[1:08:59] What anointing are you under today by
[1:09:01] God's grace?
[1:09:04] Let me say like this. Uh Isaiah 61, I
[1:09:07] want to preach a series on that
[1:09:08] sometime, too. There's so many series I
[1:09:10] want to preach. But the Bible said you
[1:09:12] either got the garments of heaviness or
[1:09:14] the garments of praise.
[1:09:18] What did you bring to church today? Were
[1:09:19] you Were you so excited to praise God or
[1:09:21] did you have the garments of heaviness
[1:09:22] on? I don't It's hard for me to praise
[1:09:24] God what I'm going through. the church
[1:09:27] that said, "Did you know that?" That's
[1:09:29] an anointing that you're carrying.
[1:09:33] That's why I like song leading because
[1:09:34] it kind of gets me right into I better
[1:09:35] worship.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; You all would know if I was dead and
[1:09:38] tired and didn't feel like praising God.
[1:09:40] But what do I have to do? I have to
[1:09:41] surrender and worship God. Let's read
[1:09:44] that just so people can see. Isaiah
[1:09:46] 61:1.
[1:09:47] I'd like to preach a whole series on
[1:09:49] this.
[1:09:51] I want you to see, church, you got to
[1:09:52] get the We got you and I, all of us got
[1:09:54] to get the anointing on.
[1:10:01] And I know I preach long. You know, let
[1:10:03] me just share this. You know, I know I
[1:10:04] preach long, but if they could listen to
[1:10:06] brother Ram for three hours,
[1:10:08] then you should be able to handle an
[1:10:10] hour and a half, right? If if you got
[1:10:12] the same Holy Spirit now, I'm talking
[1:10:14] about you got the same Holy Spirit. And
[1:10:16] if I go a little longer, like two hours,
[1:10:18] you should be able to hand that handle
[1:10:19] that too, right? There are brothers
[1:10:23] shouting. I listen to this. There are
[1:10:24] brothers shouting from the beginning to
[1:10:26] the end. Now it's off and on. But that
[1:10:29] tells me he didn't go to sleep, right?
[1:10:32] That tells me he didn't leave church and
[1:10:33] and go do something else. He stay right
[1:10:35] listening to the prophet of God because
[1:10:38] the word of God is life.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's supporting the word of God.
[1:10:43] And church, everybody should be learning
[1:10:45] things as well or be reminded of things
[1:10:47] that will stir up our hearts by way of
[1:10:48] remembrance.
[1:10:50] Look at verse uh one. Isaiah 61:1. The
[1:10:53] spirit of the Lord God is upon me. See,
[1:10:55] we need to be able to say that because
[1:10:57] the Lord hath anointed me to preach good
[1:10:59] tidings unto the meek. That's what I
[1:11:02] want to do. And this is what Jesus did.
[1:11:05] Preach good things to meek people. Now,
[1:11:07] what was one of those good things? He
[1:11:09] said, "The meek shall do what, church?"
[1:11:10] Inherit the earth. Did Jesus fulfill
[1:11:13] that? Yes, he did.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you remain meek, Nia,
[1:11:17] you'll inherit the earth." That's what
[1:11:18] Jesus said. "Remain humble, God will
[1:11:21] give you the earth." That's the
[1:11:22] millennium. Amen. He preached good
[1:11:25] things to the meek. Not the prideful,
[1:11:28] not the popular, not the arrogant and
[1:11:30] the rich and famous. It was to the meek.
[1:11:32] He preached to
[1:11:35] glory.
[1:11:38] He hath sent me to bind up the
[1:11:40] brokenhearted. So, see, it takes a
[1:11:42] special anointing to take somebody who's
[1:11:44] broken and bring them the scripture and
[1:11:47] bring them to a healed heart. It takes
[1:11:50] the anointing of the Holy Ghost to do
[1:11:51] that.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And church, I I mean, many
[1:11:55] sometimes I can tell when people come
[1:11:56] here with broken hearts. I can tell
[1:11:58] during the preaching. I can tell at the
[1:11:59] end. I can tell something's broken in
[1:12:01] them, right? So, I need the anointing of
[1:12:03] God to be able to help me to preach the
[1:12:05] word to let to let his mind be in me so
[1:12:08] that somebody can get a healed heart.
[1:12:09] Praise God.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:13] to proone I'm sorry to proclaim liberty
[1:12:15] to the captives and the opening of the
[1:12:17] prison to them that are bound. So
[1:12:19] sometimes I see people bound, right?
[1:12:21] We've had people come up. Remember I
[1:12:22] told you testimonies the devil is on my
[1:12:24] shoulder all service. The devil's trying
[1:12:25] to bind them, but we pray and the devil
[1:12:27] leaves.
[1:12:28] &gt;&gt; The devil has to loose them. Let the
[1:12:30] captives go. Hallelujah.
[1:12:34] Verse two. And to proclaim the
[1:12:35] acceptable year of the Lord. That's the
[1:12:37] church ages. And the day of the
[1:12:38] vengeance of our God, that's the
[1:12:39] tribulation period. To comfort all that
[1:12:42] mourn. Now verse three is where we're
[1:12:44] going. to appoint unto them that mourn
[1:12:47] in Zion to give them beauty for ashes,
[1:12:53] the oil of joy for mourning. Right? God
[1:12:57] knows we got to go through morning time,
[1:12:59] but God said, "I'll send the anointing
[1:13:00] so you can get your joy back." Ain't
[1:13:02] that beautiful?
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; You don't have to mourn all the time.
[1:13:07] You don't have to be brokenhearted all
[1:13:08] the time. The spirit of God is here to
[1:13:10] heal your broken heart, to bring back
[1:13:12] your joy. Hallelujah.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the anointing's for.
[1:13:16] God, send your anointing to get me out
[1:13:17] of this whatever I'm in. Uh to get this
[1:13:20] garment of of heaviness off me. Send
[1:13:22] your Holy Spirit to give me a fresh
[1:13:24] anointing today.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:30] And he's still not done. Oh, there's one
[1:13:32] more. And the garment of praise for the
[1:13:36] spirit of heaviness.
[1:13:38] See, during song service, church, I
[1:13:40] often close my eyes because I don't want
[1:13:42] to be moved by what anybody's doing. I
[1:13:44] just want to focus on Jesus and myself.
[1:13:47] Am I giving Jesus praise or not?
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I look out and I might be
[1:13:51] discouraged if people aren't praising
[1:13:53] God. I'm like, "How come people can't
[1:13:54] clap? How come people can't raise their
[1:13:56] hands?"
[1:13:57] &gt;&gt; It's because they got the spirit of
[1:13:59] heaviness on them.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; But if you got the spirit of praise on
[1:14:03] you, you want to praise God. Hallelujah.
[1:14:06] We would all know, listen, we'd all know
[1:14:08] if Malachi's hands can see your hands.
[1:14:10] We would all know if he was going to
[1:14:12] play a mournful song
[1:14:14] nearer
[1:14:16] to thee. What if every song he played it
[1:14:19] like so sad? No, he don't do that. Now,
[1:14:22] that's a good song, too, brother. I said
[1:14:23] it's a good song if you got the right uh
[1:14:25] attitude toward it. And it is. We played
[1:14:27] with brother Loris, remember? I guys
[1:14:28] remember. But what if he what if he
[1:14:31] brought just mourning every time to the
[1:14:33] piano? You'd be like, "Uh, can somebody
[1:14:34] get up there and encourage him?" You
[1:14:36] know,
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; can he put some joy on those hands?
[1:14:40] I want those hands anointed with joy.
[1:14:42] What if every song I brought just a
[1:14:43] mournful song? And we're just singing,
[1:14:46] "Oh, slow, mournful song." Now, it could
[1:14:48] be a good slow song, too. You
[1:14:50] understand?
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; But see, it's an anointing to come to
[1:14:53] church and give God praise.
[1:14:56] It just shows me, church, it shows
[1:14:58] everybody how we worship, how we uh how
[1:15:01] what the condition of our heart is.
[1:15:03] We're showing people what spirit we're
[1:15:05] anointed by. Let's be anointed by the
[1:15:06] spirit of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:11] Thank God. Thank you, Jesus.
[1:15:16] I'm at an hour and 10. Hour 15. Okay.
[1:15:19] Good. Good. Good. Good. Okay. Well,
[1:15:24] then I think
[1:15:26] I'll try to bring it down to a close.
[1:15:30] Abraham
[1:15:34] says, "Of all the times I've been behind
[1:15:35] the pulpit," I'm read this quote again.
[1:15:37] "I've never in any time in my ministry
[1:15:39] ever worked into the realms of God and
[1:15:41] the spiritual realms as it's been in at
[1:15:43] this time. It's beyond anything I ever
[1:15:46] did in my ministry.
[1:15:48] Mostly it's on healing.
[1:15:51] This is the revealing of the truth by
[1:15:53] the same spirit."
[1:15:56] So the greatest listen church the
[1:15:58] greatest meanings brother Random ever
[1:15:59] had it was good to pray and fast for
[1:16:02] miracles and healing that was good but
[1:16:05] brother Ram said remember he was praying
[1:16:06] and fasting for these as well he's
[1:16:07] staying at the Banks Woods house
[1:16:10] he would say there he said for he said
[1:16:12] for one two three four five six seven
[1:16:14] eight he said for eight days I've been
[1:16:15] in a room all by myself all day uh in
[1:16:18] the dark room uh with with the with the
[1:16:21] the window blinds closed so he could
[1:16:23] just study and pray he said I've been in
[1:16:25] there for eight days. And eight days
[1:16:27] just spending time praying with God and
[1:16:29] then going to church every night was the
[1:16:30] greatest meetings he ever had in his
[1:16:32] life.
[1:16:35] It was the greatest time he'd ever spent
[1:16:37] with God was day after day. I'm just
[1:16:39] going to study and pray day and then I'm
[1:16:40] going to go to church every night.
[1:16:43] Church, here's a here's a challenge for
[1:16:44] us and for me once our babies get old
[1:16:46] enough. When I was in denomination,
[1:16:48] Sister Lena, we would have revival
[1:16:50] weeks. We'd have church Sunday twice,
[1:16:52] Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday
[1:16:54] night, Thursday night, Friday night,
[1:16:55] Saturday, Sunday. We had we had services
[1:16:56] when I was in Pentecost. We had revival
[1:16:58] like this same preacher that he'd preach
[1:17:00] all of them.
[1:17:02] We did that in denomination and I've
[1:17:04] never done that in the message because I
[1:17:06] realized I got the revival already in my
[1:17:09] heart,
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; right? And they're they're just going
[1:17:12] for revival for tongues really and
[1:17:14] miracles, which which they're okay, but
[1:17:15] it's okay for you pray for miracles and
[1:17:17] tongues, but not as the evidence of the
[1:17:19] Holy Ghost.
[1:17:20] Right. And I realized that. And I
[1:17:22] realized, church, and I've realized
[1:17:24] this, Sicily, over the years, we've had
[1:17:25] so many people come and go in our
[1:17:26] church. A lot of them will go to these
[1:17:28] big conventions and get so stirred up
[1:17:31] and talk about, "Brother Jesse, this is
[1:17:32] the greatest sermon." People have told
[1:17:33] me this. That was the greatest sermon I
[1:17:34] ever heard at the convention. The next
[1:17:36] Sunday, they're falling asleep in
[1:17:37] church. I'm like, "What did that
[1:17:40] convention do for you then?
[1:17:43] Either I'm the most boring preacher, and
[1:17:45] if that's the case, you better come
[1:17:46] correct me after service,
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; or you have backsliden already in one
[1:17:50] week,
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; and the church said,
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; "Am I preaching the word or not?"
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; People that will, we've had people that
[1:18:00] will fly to other continents just to
[1:18:02] attend special meetings, come back
[1:18:05] sleeping during the service. What did
[1:18:08] you even get out of What did you get out
[1:18:09] of your convention then? What? What?
[1:18:12] What? And and you know people like that,
[1:18:14] they're always trying to find the next
[1:18:15] experience, next experience. But what
[1:18:17] about the daily experience? Brother said
[1:18:19] every morning, every day, just simple
[1:18:21] prayer and dedication to God. His
[1:18:23] meetings there in his tabernacle were
[1:18:25] the greatest meetings of his life.
[1:18:26] Hallelujah.
[1:18:28] &gt;&gt; And well, he didn't he didn't have to
[1:18:29] travel overseas. It was every day he was
[1:18:31] seeking God, wanting more from God. Oh,
[1:18:33] and God showed up. Oh, hallelujah.
[1:18:36] Praise God. So, I've learned over the
[1:18:38] years, I appreciate special meetings,
[1:18:40] but they of themselves will not hold
[1:18:42] you.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; You got to hold on to Christ every day.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; It's an everyday experience. Now, I want
[1:18:48] to have more special meetings. I do. I'd
[1:18:50] love to.
[1:18:52] But I've seen just because people go to
[1:18:54] big conventions, that doesn't make them
[1:18:56] born again.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; And even church, even one of these
[1:19:00] people, they would fly over to uh
[1:19:02] continents, right? And then I I they've
[1:19:05] even told me I I went there for a
[1:19:07] meeting and then they skipped out on the
[1:19:09] meeting and went two weeks without going
[1:19:10] to church.
[1:19:13] Two weeks. And they called them and I
[1:19:15] think my children might have heard that
[1:19:16] when they shared that. I don't know if
[1:19:17] they remember that or not. People that
[1:19:19] used to go to our church, fly all around
[1:19:21] the world, skip out on the actual
[1:19:23] services, and skip out on church alto
[1:19:25] together and try to tell me they're born
[1:19:28] again. Sister Lena, they try to tell me
[1:19:30] that and that I'm not preaching the
[1:19:32] right things and stuff like that. I got
[1:19:34] better sense than that.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; If you got the Holy Ghost, you can't
[1:19:38] wait to get to the house of God and
[1:19:40] worship God.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; If I got the Holy Ghost, I never think
[1:19:43] about want to go two weeks away with my
[1:19:45] wife and never go to church. It's is
[1:19:47] actually the opposite. I like to get
[1:19:48] away with my wife and my kids and go to
[1:19:50] church every day.
[1:19:52] As long as somebody would just cook for
[1:19:53] us, right? Then my wife would not have
[1:19:55] to cook all day or my girls.
[1:19:59] He's working his tail off, right? I wish
[1:20:00] he could maybe take a vacation. Wouldn't
[1:20:04] that just be great? You know, so it's
[1:20:05] never my thought, brother Neil, like,
[1:20:07] well, I like to travel away and I really
[1:20:08] like to get alone and just get with my
[1:20:09] phone for two weeks and just miss church
[1:20:11] for two weeks. Can you and these people
[1:20:13] tell me they're born again?
[1:20:16] What did it do? What did the Holy Ghost
[1:20:18] do for brother Brandham? It made him
[1:20:20] want to spend the whole week Glory. It
[1:20:22] made him want to spend the whole church,
[1:20:24] whole week in service sharing the
[1:20:26] revelations. Amen. Sharing the Bible
[1:20:28] truths that God was revealing to him.
[1:20:31] Sister Beatatric the greatest meetings
[1:20:34] he ever was a part of was in his home
[1:20:37] church. Just every day was revival.
[1:20:39] Every day I'm meeting with God. I'm
[1:20:41] going to go worship God's night. I'm
[1:20:42] going to share what God put on my heart.
[1:20:45] So this is my question as I close.
[1:20:48] If these were the greatest
[1:20:50] services, if these were the greatest
[1:20:52] depths brother ever worked in as a
[1:20:54] Christian, what were the greatest depths
[1:20:57] you've ever worked in as a Christian?
[1:21:01] What are the greatest depths of the love
[1:21:03] of God and the revelation of God? When
[1:21:06] was the time, brother Chris, that the
[1:21:08] Bible became a brand new Bible
[1:21:11] and everything was fresh? Everything was
[1:21:13] glorious. And you stayed in that channel
[1:21:17] for more than we'd say one one day. You
[1:21:20] just worked. You just stayed in
[1:21:21] fellowship with God day after day. How
[1:21:24] many want to experience something like
[1:21:26] that by God's grace?
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; I do, too. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:21:30] Musicians can come
[1:21:33] and I've shared that myself. The
[1:21:35] greatest meetings I've ever been a part
[1:21:36] of was not of course I was overseas. I
[1:21:37] had no responsibilities there in South
[1:21:39] America and Trinidad. The greatest
[1:21:41] meetings I ever saw. Now CAM's meetings
[1:21:43] have been some of the greatest meetings
[1:21:45] here in the US I've ever seen where I
[1:21:47] get a Friday, Saturday, Sunday and I
[1:21:49] just get to study and pray all those
[1:21:51] days. Now church, this doesn't mean all
[1:21:53] the other days are bad. It just means
[1:21:54] there's days God has in your life to
[1:21:57] show you that spending time with him is
[1:21:59] the greatest thing you can do. The Bible
[1:22:02] becomes a new Bible.
[1:22:05] The love of God is planted more in your
[1:22:08] heart. You want to spend more time with
[1:22:11] God and with God's people. That's what
[1:22:14] this tells me. The greatest services of
[1:22:16] his life were home church services. Just
[1:22:18] day after day, study, pray, see what the
[1:22:21] Holy Ghost will reveal to me. I never
[1:22:23] told this testimony here, but uh you
[1:22:25] probably don't remember Shawn Martin.
[1:22:26] Anybody remember Shawn Martin? You
[1:22:28] remember him? Shawn Martin. He preached
[1:22:30] a youth series.
[1:22:32] a preacher in uh West Virginia asked
[1:22:35] Shawn Martin to hold services and preach
[1:22:38] for a whole month straight every night.
[1:22:41] It was it was about 20 years ago. And he
[1:22:44] said there was hard services, especially
[1:22:45] but he said it was around day 16 or 17.
[1:22:47] 17 is the bride's number in the Bible. I
[1:22:50] preached on that before. I think it was
[1:22:51] the 17th day. He said he was preaching
[1:22:53] and a blind man received his sight in
[1:22:55] the back. That was in early 2000,
[1:22:58] something around there, early 2000,
[1:22:59] 2005.
[1:23:01] And he said it just lit a fire in the
[1:23:03] church.
[1:23:05] Now church, that's what this reminds me
[1:23:07] of. Such a dedication. Every day we're
[1:23:11] going to spend time with God. We're
[1:23:12] going to devote time to worship and
[1:23:14] prayer. Now, we'll wait on God for
[1:23:17] something like this for our church. Like
[1:23:18] I said, I've got to be in a spot. How am
[1:23:20] I going to feed nine kids? How am I
[1:23:21] going to do that? I ain't got the money
[1:23:22] to buy fast food every night. My bank
[1:23:25] account's going to be at negative or
[1:23:26] zero real fast if that's the case. How
[1:23:29] can I do that? and we got jobs and all
[1:23:31] these things. So, we just need the we
[1:23:32] need the leadership of the Lord. What
[1:23:34] I'm telling you, Brother Ram didn't
[1:23:36] spend any other time of his life like
[1:23:38] this than just that week. And remember,
[1:23:40] church, he didn't even invite his wife
[1:23:41] and his son and his daughter because
[1:23:42] they were in school. They his wife
[1:23:45] missed out on his greatest meetings
[1:23:48] ever.
[1:23:51] So, let's bow our heads. When was a time
[1:23:54] you worked in the realms of God as far
[1:23:57] as study, prayer, devotion to God? When
[1:24:00] when was the greatest time you had in
[1:24:02] fellowship with Jesus?
[1:24:06] Oh, church, it was God hiding himself in
[1:24:08] simplicity. Just simple services at the
[1:24:10] tabernacle became so special,
[1:24:13] the Bible became a new Bible. Oh, God.
[1:24:18] Friends, I tell these stories about
[1:24:19] people because I want you to learn.
[1:24:21] These are things I see as a pastor. I
[1:24:23] want you to learn from these things. And
[1:24:25] I don't think anybody in the church here
[1:24:26] does that. I don't think anybody runs to
[1:24:28] big services for just another
[1:24:29] experience.
[1:24:31] But I want to encourage you. There's a
[1:24:32] time and season for everything.
[1:24:36] And some people just run
[1:24:38] for popularity. They run for experience
[1:24:41] rather than just having a daily
[1:24:43] dedicated devoted life to Jesus Christ.
[1:24:46] And church with our financial state,
[1:24:48] what are we going to do all we can't go
[1:24:49] to these big meetings all the time. We
[1:24:51] can't hardly afford it. So, what do we
[1:24:52] got to do? We got to see God in every
[1:24:54] one of our services. We got to live
[1:24:56] devoted every day to Jesus Christ.
[1:25:00] Church, do you think the book of Acts
[1:25:02] church, do you think they would run from
[1:25:03] Jerusalem to Judea uh over to
[1:25:07] uh Jericho for special meetings all the
[1:25:09] time? Do you think they could do that
[1:25:10] without cars? No. No. So, what do they
[1:25:14] have to have? They had to have the
[1:25:16] spirit of Jesus Christ in their
[1:25:17] services. Praise God. service after
[1:25:20] service. They had to have it. So
[1:25:23] sometimes I look at that with our
[1:25:24] church.
[1:25:27] How can I take nine kids to a convention
[1:25:29] down in Louisiana? How can I go across
[1:25:32] the state? How can I go to Arkansas or
[1:25:35] Virginia? How can I take my whole
[1:25:36] family?
[1:25:38] How can I do that?
[1:25:40] But I don't have to be pressured to do
[1:25:42] that. I can see that Jesus wants to meet
[1:25:45] with me every single day. He wants me to
[1:25:47] live a dedicated, sanctified life.
[1:25:52] Let's pray. Father God, we thank you for
[1:25:54] the word today, Lord God.
[1:25:56] Lord, we thank you, God, that you showed
[1:25:58] us how simple it is to have a deep walk
[1:26:00] with you, Lord. Simple everyday study
[1:26:03] and prayer. Hallelujah. Lord, I've seen
[1:26:05] that in my life, Lord God.
[1:26:08] Despite the busyiness of work and
[1:26:09] things, Lord, just in the morning
[1:26:10] spending time with you reading your
[1:26:12] word, the scripture opens up like the
[1:26:15] spirit of burning is a prime example
[1:26:18] comes out and people say, "Oh, I needed
[1:26:20] to hear that. That was the Holy Spirit."
[1:26:23] Lord, the Bible then become a new Bible.
[1:26:25] Oh my, this is something fresh.
[1:26:27] Hallelujah. Or the fear of the Lord
[1:26:30] series, Lord God. Or something along
[1:26:31] those lines.
[1:26:33] That one saint online said David,
[1:26:36] David's battle against David was so
[1:26:38] helpful for them, Lord God.
[1:26:42] Lord, it's just in these daily talking
[1:26:44] to you, daily praying, daily seeking
[1:26:46] your face, let the anointing, the spirit
[1:26:49] of the Lord rest upon us, Lord God. I
[1:26:51] pray
[1:26:54] may the spirit of God anoint us to
[1:26:56] praise you, Lord God. May the spirit of
[1:26:58] heaviness leave each individual, Lord
[1:27:00] God, where it's too heavy to raise their
[1:27:03] hands, too heavy to to cry out to God,
[1:27:06] too heavy to clap their hands, Lord God,
[1:27:09] but that each person would have the
[1:27:11] spirit of worship,
[1:27:14] the spirit of joy, the oil of joy.
[1:27:17] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Thank God.
[1:27:20] Oh Lord, let heaviness leave your
[1:27:22] people, dear God. Let the anointing
[1:27:25] break every chain as the scripture says.
[1:27:28] The anointing breaks every yoke.
[1:27:29] Hallelujah. In the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:27:31] We believe that Lord God.
[1:27:34] Lord, we'll rejoice at the big meetings
[1:27:36] Lord when we get a chance to go sometime
[1:27:37] Lord. No doubt.
[1:27:41] But God may we see you in the simplicity
[1:27:43] that you you God hide in simplicity in
[1:27:45] our lives. You just want to talk to us
[1:27:47] every day.
[1:27:49] You just want us to work in deeper
[1:27:52] realms of love, deeper realms of
[1:27:54] devotion to you. Lord God,
[1:27:58] thank you for the example your prophet
[1:28:00] set pointing us to the scripture. Lord
[1:28:01] God, we know the scripture is
[1:28:04] infallible.
[1:28:06] We're thankful for the tapes. We're
[1:28:07] thankful for the sermons. But God, thank
[1:28:10] you for giving us grace. I'm thank you
[1:28:11] that we understand that the scripture is
[1:28:13] infallible and the answers are not
[1:28:15] infallible.
[1:28:17] Thank you God for your mercy and grace
[1:28:19] upon our church. Thank you that Lord
[1:28:20] visitors as I told them visitors can
[1:28:22] come and they can feel so refreshed.
[1:28:24] Lord God, they can hardly praise. They
[1:28:27] can hardly feel what's happening because
[1:28:30] it's the Holy Ghost. Oh God, we're
[1:28:32] thankful for the Holy Ghost. I'm
[1:28:33] thankful for the Holy Ghost, Lord God.
[1:28:35] May it always remain our desire, Lord,
[1:28:37] that the Holy Ghost could dwell in our
[1:28:38] midst. Lord God,
[1:28:43] may each person long to be shut in with
[1:28:45] God.
[1:28:50] Lord, may not just be one person who
[1:28:51] shuts in with God, but may every person
[1:28:54] shut in with God each day, Lord God.
[1:28:59] And may we develop, Lord, such a love
[1:29:00] for you, God,
[1:29:03] that will say, "My, I've never lived in
[1:29:05] the realms I'm living in now with the
[1:29:08] word becoming more powerful my life."
[1:29:11] Lord, I believe you're trying to raise
[1:29:12] our faith through Adam's testimony, Lord
[1:29:14] God.
[1:29:17] Brother Rod, some of these testimonies
[1:29:19] we've shared, Lord God, trying to
[1:29:20] encourage us that our faith might be
[1:29:22] raised, Lord God, that we could wrestle
[1:29:26] not against flesh and blood, but wrestle
[1:29:28] and defeat the spiritual wickedness in
[1:29:30] high places. Grant it, Lord God. Let
[1:29:32] your anointing bless your people. Give
[1:29:34] them strength to praise, strength, Lord
[1:29:36] God, to have healed hearts. We pray in
[1:29:38] Jesus Christ's name.
