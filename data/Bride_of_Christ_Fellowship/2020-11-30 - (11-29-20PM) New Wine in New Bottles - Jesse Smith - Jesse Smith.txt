like to preach on new wine in new bottles tonight so you have your bibles let's go to the book of matthew here by god's grace brother branham labored on it in 1957 more than other years not sure all the significance behind that but we know 56 was the 50th year after the revival of 1906 so there's a lot of significance in that uh those that rejected the revival brother brown was saying the nation rejected it but it's clear the individual can still have it like we're having tonight hallelujah thank you jesus matthew let's go to matthew um let me pull my notes here sorry it's mentioned three times in the gospels matthew 9 sorry matthew 9 14. by the end i think you understand what i'm saying uh we need new wine we need new wine more than yesterday we need new wine today amen praise god so matthew 9 14 i believe yes 9 14. there's this little song i want to learn i've been listening to a lot at home it's called new wine i think hillsong sings it um beautiful song just an absolute masterpiece of the song um that guy might try to sing that one at the original guy oh he stepped out i might try and sing that at the end here we'll see how much how bold i get i guess that's probably the word how bold do i feel like being trying a new song in case you laughed at me matthew 9 14. but it's just such a beautiful song jesus is constantly wanting to do new wine in our lives praise god 9 14. matthew 9 14. i'll read uh 14 through 16 and then we'll all read 17. so let me read those first few verses then came to him the disciples of john saying why do we and the pharisees fast oft but thy disciples fast not and jesus said unto them can the children of the bride chamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them and then shall they fast no man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment for that which is put in i'm sorry in to fill it up taketh from the garment and the rent is made worse let's read verse 17 together can we one two three neither do men put new wine into new bottles i'm sorry old bottles else the bottles break and the wine runeth out and the bottles perish but they put new wine into new bottles and both are preserved let's have one more word of prayer let's ask god to give us new wine can we pray that tonight here heavenly father lord we're grateful for your mercy and your love and father we just come lord worshiping you today lord i notice all these songs are about joy and worshiping god many of them the lord what a vindication lord because we're looking at new wine the joy and gladness of the lord tonight so father we're grateful for your amazing grace and this word that you've given to us the revelation of it and the life-giving power that it brings us lord as new wine makes new life and it expands and grows thank you that the holy ghost expands lord and grows in our life as we grow in love and grow in knowledge and grow in judgment lord of all these things we're grateful lord speak to your people tonight i know many have traveled many miles lord like sister wendy lord and sister karen lord i just pray you bless their sacrifices speak to them speak to all of us tonight lord god we're grateful to be gathered in your house lord and all that we receive tonight we know the devil will never take it from us so let us receive revelation tonight that will keep it lord and we'll give you all the praise honor and glory in jesus christ's name for the saints said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god i do have some slides here so um we'll look at new wine in new bottles tonight so ever since i heard that song uh by hillsong i thought ma i want to study that out and preach that you know a little more uh i'm going to preach on music pretty soon amen just so you know um i've been studying listening to it when i have the free time you know it's like when i'm washing dishes or something like that and uh let me just give you a little brief review or you guys should say preview i don't think there's anything wrong in singing a hill song song as long as you sing it in the right style with the right beat and as long as the words are scriptural so let me just give you that so i believe as christians we can pull from any group whether they're off the word or not any real inspiration they get from god that's scriptural i believe we can benefit from that right uh just like balaam balaam was a false prophet right but he got under the true anointing and he prophesied there's gonna rise a star out of jacob the wise men follow that prophecy right so see any person that gets real inspiration from god it's useful to the real believer right but you don't focus on the vessel right like i don't go to hillsong and try to what can i learn what they're preaching how their women cut their hair and you know and all their you know if it's a pro i don't know if it's a prosperity church or not but would i go to them for teaching no but if they have a gift of god that points us to the word as we worship and sing i'll take that and i know maybe you disagree some people might disagree with me that's fine but i i see scripture because the bible says sing a new song under the lord if we just keep singing the same old songs that's fine but that's actually against the scripture we need to learn a new song praise god so i know a few people in the message who write new songs but not many so we're really limited on new songs at least in the message and that's okay it might not be our gift like who can add a cubit to your stature who's going to sit down and say well i'm going to write a new song today because we don't have any news who's going to do it i don't see many of us doing it um so if they're inspired to sing those songs and they're scriptural songs then i'll sing it and if not well how do you deal with uh when hillsong 20 years ago wrote shout to the lord and it was just piano and there was no rock and roll into it you're going to throw that song out i mean all the message church has sung that shout to the lord well now they're going to throw it out just because he'll sing it back before they use the rock and roll and all these things but i think that's wrong so i just want to i just want to encourage you by amen i know you're the song leader buddy so i just want to encourage you as long as that song is sung with the right style and worship and holiness doesn't have the rock and roll uh it's called the back beat so i'm going to preach on that too as long as it doesn't have that back beat and it's rock and roll or rap like or hip-hop or something like that as long as you can sing that song in the right style and its words are scriptural that's a blessing okay so i just thought i'd just preview it to you on that no i don't get discouraged you know uh i i i as as if you can feel the presence of god in a song and it lines up with the word it's okay to sing as long as we sing it the right way praise god so uh bear with me here uh we'll be looking at new wine and new bottles now there's no symbolism behind this uh you know this powerpoint i just i want to try something different you know i think it's called drafting like someone making a draft to build a building so i guess we're trying to build the house of god we're trying to build a statue perfect man but you know there's no really significance to it i just want to look at new wine and new bottles tonight have your bibles handy there's three parallel passages uh to the new wine uh parable jesus told okay and it's called a parable in luke we'll get to we'll end with that one uh so we read the one in matthew 9 here and uh it sounds like jesus is just carrying over the thought of disciples don't fast um i don't i honestly don't know if if the old garment parable and the new line is connected to the fasting or not um personally i don't think it is it could be i'll explain why when we get to luke i just want you to notice uh from from this text here um that jesus tells john's disciples we're not fasting because it's a joyful time right so jesus was god and flesh and him being on earth was a joyful time amen so he said i don't expect my twelve disciples to fast because the bridegroom's here amen right if we went to a wedding when was the last wedding we attended that'd have been amen who was i remember bangs back i think the five or six year reminder came up on my facebook a few days ago buddy so happy anniversary it's coming up pretty soon too i think it's december 4th or 5th right somewhere in there i saw that on my facebook i'm like praise the lord bang's anniversary but when we went to vang's uh celebration we weren't fasting man we gotta we ate all the meat you know and the fun and whatever was there i'm just guessing on the pho whatever was there whatever laos you know hmong type food was there we gorged ourselves well maybe not all of us but in other words a wedding is not a time to fast it's a time to feast and so jesus christ on the earth literally god and flesh was a time to rejoice multitudes church were being saved he'd walk into a building brother amen and everybody would get healed praise god as long as they had the faith it was a time of uh feasting it was a time of spiritual feasting and rejoicing but then he said but after the bridegroom leaves then they're going to learn how to fast and pray and so church we know his body's not here now so it's a time for we us to be fasting as well at times because the bridegroom is not here his body's not here his spirit's here but his spirit's been here for 2000 years we're waiting for the body praise god we're waiting to see him face to face and uh one and i'll never forget this i told brother amen i was in arkansas preaching at a church and i said he said brother okay where do you want to eat i said i'm not going to eat today i'm fasting and praying he's like what do you mean the bridegroom's here i said what do you mean the bridegroom's here he said when the cloud came down in 63 the bridegroom came back i said well i don't know about that but church the sad part was many people in his church were overweight uh obese didn't take care of themselves very well um and things i've heard since then they're really struggling now with covet many of them in the church their churches kind of dying dwindling away and there's a connection here to taking care of your body right and seeking god there's a connection and we'll get simon preach it last week we'll get to that little bit luke 21 we'll get to that in just a minute it's a worldwide spirit of noah that's coming over the world right now and we've got a battle against it do i believe the holy ghost is here in a great way absolutely uh do i believe something great happened in 63 with the cloud absolutely but it's not the physical return of jesus christ and so we must keep fasting and praying and being spiritual people okay now uh let's go to mark two i'm gonna try to just read these three passages and then show brother braham's interpretation like i said there's i think there's 21 hits in 1957. he mostly dealt with this and then i looked into 64 65 63 and he has the same interpretation of it so it remained unchanged even after the seals so mark 2 18. so let's read the scriptures and then we'll see brother branham's interpretation new wine in new bottles mark 2 18 it says and the disciples of john and the pharisees used to fast and they come and say unto him why do disciples of john and of the pharisees fast but thy disciples fast not and jesus said them can the children of the bride chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them as long as they have the bridegroom with them they cannot fast but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days no man soweth a piece of new cloth on an old garment right else the new piece that filled it up taketh away from the old because it'll shrink right if you have a fabric that's brand new it's never been shrunk and you put it on an old garment and it gets wet or you heat it up whatever you do it'll shrink right and it'll it'll rip that piece it'll rip itself plus the garment around it that's what the scripture says it's made worse it doesn't actually help it hurts and no man with new line into old bowels else the new eye just birth burst the bottles and the light is spilled and the bottles will be marred but new wine must be put into new bottles glory praise god go to luke 5 33. see i know where we're going so i'm really happy you know and you probably know where we're going to luke 5 33 now here's why actually i put it up here verse 36 seems to say that these two parables are not related to the the fasting now that's just my opinion so you know i haven't found anything different from brother branham on that so i mean i'm just letting you know that's i do not think they're related but it's good to go over fasting because amen asked me about it last week so it's good to go over it so we will go over it just really briefly here tonight okay luke 5 33 then they said unto him why do the disciples of john fast often and make prayers and likewise the disciples of the pharisees but thine eat and drink and he said unto them can you make the children of the bride chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them but the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them and then shall they fast in those days right verse 36. now listen and he spake also a parable unto them so i'm just saying this scripture 36 makes it seem like also he also said something else a parable so it makes it seem like to me they're not connected but they could be i don't know for sure i don't think it's a major issue verse 36 no man put it that piece of a new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a rent and the peace that was taken out of the new agreeth not with the old and no man put his new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles shall perish but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved so we're talking about the preservation of one we're talking about the preservation of skins praise god the goal of new wine is to preserve the power praise god amen it's preservation verse 39 no man having drunk old wine straightway desireth the new for he saith the old is better praise god so the old wine is better wine praise god the one that's been uh growing longer amen one that's been around longer is the better wine praise god amen now uh let's just if you got your bibles go to isaiah 58. this is what i was showing with brother amen and sister who last week i believe if i'm not mistaken there's at least four reasons for fasting of course many others could be i'm sure it's been a while and i actually didn't go back and look at my notes i just these are the first four that came to my mind isaiah 58. this whole chapter is about fasting god rebukes them for fasting because they're not doing it the right way for the right reasons right like the pharisees they fasted and the bible said they would disfigure their faces right so i wonder what is that what does this figure mean would they put like ashes would they rub ashes if everybody could see it or they just i didn't eat lunch today oh uh pharisee dear sir why are you so sad i'm hungry you know he's sucking his cheeks a little bit haven't eaten today they put on a show they want everybody to know they're fasting for their glory and jesus said you got your reward here oh oh oh my yours you're so spiritual and yet when the word comes they turn down the word right it shows they're not spiritual now uh the main verses let's go to verse four see behold you fast for strife and debate so see they they would they would argue uh about who was better at fasting they would try to uh debate each other based upon who was more spiritual because i fast more and to fight with the fists of wickedness you should not fast as you do this day so jeremiah's telling i'm sorry i days down this is how fasting right now the wrong way to make your voice be heard on high so see they fasted to promote themselves well look i fasted today everybody needs to hear me right when they read that they read the uh the scroll the synagogue like jesus right when it's their day to read i'm fasting today and you know they try to be real spiritual now everybody listen to me now i've skipped a meal for all of you and they would oh this man is so holy i'm in the right place and actually they're in the wrong place right verse five is it such a fast that i have chosen is this what i've chosen to fast to magnify man and get you to debate and argue and fuss and exalt man a day for a man to afflict his soul is it to bow down his head as a bull rush and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him will thou call this a fast and acceptable day unto the lord is that this the fast that i've chosen here's why god chose fast here it is to loose the bands of wickedness to undo the heavy burdens so if you're burdened and you are addicted to something you need to fast or you can do it for other people i'll never forget when we fast for rose and uh whole days nephews and and grandson we just had fast days and god answered they're all alive by god's grace all three of those that had the cancer they're all alive by god's grace that's just god's amazing grace and all three of them in remission he said uh and to the let the oppressed go free and that you break every yoke amen see every addiction can be defeated praise god through fasting verse seven is it not not here's a new one that's new to me focusing on the poor so if you want to get your eyes off yourself and minister to other people the bible says fast and then go work while you're fasting in other words go take food to people or go you know take them a check or take them cash if you want to get closer to god the bible says fast and then go serve other people right because it's the most sincere you'll ever be because when you eat a lot it's the least sincere you probably are right because you're oh you're just so relaxed and feeling so good and you're feeling heavy right you're you're weighted down by your meal but when you fast he says that's a time to go minister to the poor that was the last time we did that see is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry so i could eat that bread but if i fast and give it away god will move on on our behalf and that thou bring the poor that are cast out to thy house when that so you're fasting but you're going to bring the poor to your house to feed them about that one my goodness when thou seest the naked that thou will cover him and that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh right your own family your own whatever you see when you're fasting you're in tune with other people's needs you're aware of what they need right because it's not about you you're telling your body hey buddy i'm in charge not you right hey stomach yeah i'm in charge of you you're not running in this life i'm running this life the soul right and then you can actually get your focus off yourself and get it on other people when you're fasting even if it's just one me i always tell the people start out light just start with one meal right and then go see if you can go to two let's even go to three i rarely go beyond three i rarely just so you know i rarely go beyond three um just because i haven't felt led to do that and if god's gonna leave me do that i'm sure he will i'll be happy to do it by god's grace um verse 8 then shall thy light break forth as the morning huh you're gonna you're gonna feel like a brand new morning when you're fasting and serving other people church if you want a revival it's very simple fast and go help other people very very simple oh i want to i want a fresh start brother jester i i want to feel god's love afresh again okay fast and goes to help other people pray fast and pray and go serve other people the bible promises you'll break forth as the morning amen i feel like i'm in a real dark time brother jess i feel like it's a nighttime well i know how to get to a morning time right here i know how so you can have a new morning praise god amen i know how you can feel god's mercies are brand new praise god don't feed your flesh don't enter to the flesh cater the holy spirit and thine health your health shall spring forth speed us so when you're sick fasting is a good option too now when i fast normally just do water or coffee or kombucha just liquid i do liquid fast brother uh daniel and daniel nine and ten he did the the vegetable fast right he didn't have all the dainty meats you know he just did a vegetable fast that was three weeks so he did vegetables and water and didn't enjoy the i said like this the chicken and of course he wouldn't eat pork you know but uh all the dainty meats he'd stay away from that and that was 21 days of seeking god and god answered his prayer by sending gabriel praise god gabriel held uh the prince of persia that demon power so the other angel could come down and bring him the answers to his questions praise god and thy righteousness shall go before thee okay so then see that god will prepare your way how many want to know how many would know the way to walk in the bible said are you fast then the bible said righteousness will go before you it'll prepare it'll prepare the way the right actions are right in front of you praise god amen right choices are right in front of you if you just fast and pray that's why you'll find out brother brandon fasted every friday every friday verse 9 oh i want to hear from god verse 9 then thou shalt call and the lord shall answer i need an answer from god fast thou shalt cry and he shall say here i am if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke the putting forth of the finger and the vanish so see the yoke is yoked or addicted to the sin right yoke to sin and then vanity right and putting forth the finger accusing others that's like satan satan's a great accuser right if you put that away and stop saying such evil things you're gonna get a victory fasting and if thy if thou draw out this thou soul i'm sorry thy soul to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise in obscurity and thy darkness shall be as the noon day praise god see so when you fast you want to be satisfied with god right there's something you want god to satisfy but the bible says when you fast satisfy other people and then you'll get a blessing praise god right uh i think brother dick said that if you want a blessing go be a blessing to somebody praise god lebron said that you want somebody to say something nice about you say something nice about them amen praise god cast your bread up on the waters it'll come back in due time praise god when i got that check in the mail for 500 from that brother up in illinois you know he said 650 brother 650. so you just cast it and all for what all just for the videos we made he said i've enjoyed those youtube videos for five years he said i just want to he said i wanted to come and take your family out to eat he said but i had back yeah he said i broke my back i had cancer all these things he's like i'm not kicking so i'm going to say this offering verse 11. the lord shall guide thee lord i want to be guided fast you see any good promise lacking here do you see anything that's lacking if we fast i don't see much lacking he shall guide thee and satisfy thy soul in drought and make thy bones i'm sorry make fat thy bones and thou shalt be like a water garden and like a spring of water whose waters fail not i'm gonna keep being so refreshed so satisfied i'm gonna be drinking on the waters of god i'm just going to be so happy all the time praise god because i'm fasting i'm satisfied i want i want my inside to be satisfied so i'm cutting off my natural desires verse 12 and they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places oh talk about restoration thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations you want to see your children saved fast praise god we want to see we want to see generations impacted fast and thou shalt be called the repair of the breach the restore of pass to dwell in praise god wow people that fast uh bring restoration to places right they renew places they give renewed hope people get new beginnings all through fasting but that sure is not a popular message in this day and later to see an age they don't want to hear that verse 13 this is part of it if thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my holy day and call the sabbath a delight so we've got to call sundays it's a delight to go to church the holy of the lord honorable and shall honor him not doing thine own ways nor finding thine own pleasure nor speaking thine own words so really it's good to come here and fellowship but really the fellowship is with christ and then when you get that then it just pours out to everybody else praise god but if you just come just to fellowship with people you're going to miss the real fellowship with christ verse 14 then shalt thou delight thyself in the lord amen is that striking uh psalms says delight yourself the lord will give you the desires of your heart but the heroes tells you how to delight yourself in the lord fasting praise god so after you fast and turn your way from evil all these things focus on the lord as we said this morning then you'll delight yourself in the lord and i will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the earth oh you just go on uh flights praise god you'll soar up into the heavenlies praise god far above the worldly things and the church said on that eagle anointing and feed thee with the heritage of jacob thy father for the mouth of the lord has spoken now who's going to say that doesn't work who's going to say fasting doesn't work the lord spoke it praise god the lord spoke it so we're not going to read these because time but brother if we need power the bible says fast forward because certain kind only go out by prayer and fasting if we need healing to our own bodies fast if we need to focus on the poor get our eyes off ourselves and want a blessing we need to focus on other people fast while you're doing it and if you need answers like daniel fast so normally i fast for preaching for these reasons right here usually right so i just have a reminder on my phone to give to the poor every month by god's grace i've been doing that but these are the main reasons i fast i want to be prepared if somebody comes up for prayer and i'm going to put oil on them and they don't have any sins i want to trust that god's going to drive that demon away that's why i fast right for healing and then answers i want to know god what do you want me to preach so i fast and i look for god to answer it when i study praise god so that you'll have the word that you need amen okay now much more can be said you can i've preached numerous sermons on fasting but here's where brother brown says he's talking about some victory or some services in new york well i'm sorry he's in new york talking about previous services one night they just piled up crutches and things to try to hold them around for me for them to hold like this they want to take a picture of it some old canes clubs everything they've been walking with then i remember i've been fasting it was just like tonight friday's a fast day has been for me for a long time so brother man would fast go into the weekend fasting he said he would eat a little sandwich before services on the weekend and then he would see crutches he would see people healed from canes so that was his avenue for having miracles so if you want to see miracles we got to consecrate our lives and we got to pray for it amen praise god you got to consecrate it and pray for remember when bangs or who is dead uh got healed things that i was fasting that morning you know i was passing that morning and that sunday when jose brought out brother man's cloth i was fasting that morning too i just always want to be ready praise god you never know when uh you need to drive the power of the enemy away the bible said be instant just on sunday begins to in season out of season praise god you got to be ready oh i know we're gonna have special meetings i better fast then but it's a good idea to fast often praise god right not just special meetings it's a good idea to fast often the bible says so friday was brother adam's fast day now this is what brother brother simon brought out i'm sorry last week brother ham said it too i preached this years ago i preached on overeating years ago but i mean probably 2009 2010 i remember i preached it in north carolina at tim hughes church and i there was a there was a big man that came up after service and he said wow bro justin i'm going to follow everything you said and i'm going to cut my portions and i'm going to cut but sadly he didn't because i asked later some of the people in the church did he ever keep up with that they said no see people people want to do what's right but many times they can't because they've got hindrances in their life right if god's word promises you something and you can't get to it something you're doing is hindering that that's what you looked at on blessings and cursings right if you can't get a blessing of god is because something you're doing is hindering it because god wants you to be blessed so take heed to yourselves listen any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting that just means drinking over drinking and drunkenness so eat right cares of this life so eating and drinking so that day come upon you unawares for as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth so this overeating and laodicea where richard increased with goods that's impacting most people on the earth right you know there's a few places that have famine still you know there's little places like that but the bible says this is going to go over the face of the whole earth he said watch ye therefore and pray always that he may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that should come to pass and instead you've got to choose not to get drunk you've got to choose so fast you've got to choose that and then you're worthy of god's mercy amen so i'm not talking salvation i'm talking about escaping the tribulation yes you got to be worthy to escape the tribulation the bible says because this overeating and self-indulgence this lovers of self more than lovers of god comes upon the whole earth and the best way you can love god more than yourself is to fast i'd probably get more amens if more people were fasted so there's two applications to this there's application of new wine to the soul now yeah i'm getting transferring back to new wine now there's new wine to the soul but there's also new wine to the spirit so stay with me i'll start with the soul that's probably the most obvious because any time you talk about new wine you talk about gladness and joy and refreshment well you just don't have gladness in your soul right you can have gladness in your mind right so let's look at this uh so let's look at new wine in the soul here uh brother branham says on the day of pentecost god had 120 brand new pentecostal bottles setting with their necks up i wish i had a bottle of that yup i got a bottle right here so he said brand new pentecostal bottles and when the holy spirit fell from heaven it filled those bottles and they bounced all over the place preaching the gospel to the known world declaring that jesus christ was the same yesterday today and forever so bibam says the new skins got filled with new wine on the day of pentecost so the new wine didn't come until pentecost praise god so that means church sanctification is the oil right brother man said you got to get new skins first then he said you got to oil the skins so the skins the new skins is justification and the oil to oil the skins to make sure they're flexible is sanctification and then the oil the new one i'm sorry the new wine poured in is the baptism of the holy ghost so there's three steps to the new wine praise god and i'll prove it to you brother brahm says so now he said you can't hardly get the message to the old form of believing he's talking about people that live under the old word like word that was uh it's not up to date right like they just say under luther just stay under wesley jesus spoke of that a long time ago in the bible he said you can't put new wine in old bottles i often wonder what that meant what did our lord mean when he said put new wine in old bottles well i thought what the difference does it make because today we only have glass bottles like this right here and whether it's a new or old it doesn't make any difference when i but when i visit the eastern countries the orient i find out that the water bottles of that day was made out of animal skin and then when the animal skins fresh and a new skin or it got old and dry and set to take new unfermented wine and put it in there with that new wine unfermented still had the germ of life in it and when it begins to ferment why the old bottles that were so set and stiff why there was an explosion it could not hold it and it would just burst open then the wine would perish and the bottle would perish praise god now that's the way it is today you can't take this brand new heaven-born pentecostal wine and mix it with them old-time creed of some sort some old set in the way died in the wool now can i get an amen for set in the way church we cannot be set in our way in other words this is all i'm going to give to god i'm not giving any more to god this is how i serve god i can't give any more to god church we cannot get set in our ways we got to be constantly surrendering more to god amen amen we don't because most we see it message people if they're along or hanging around long enough they get set in their ways and we're not careful the same thing happens to us we gotta break out of the old and we gotta have a brand new bottle praise god now that's later to the human spirit this is still speaking of the soul why if you do you go to preaching about the baptism of the holy spirit divine healing and signs and wonders that old skin will try to stretch and it'll blow ah the days of miracles has passed i can't stand it no more i can't even stand through this sermon now how many people would have battled that before they don't even want to listen to the sermon right they don't even want to hear it they won't even agree with it see it's just set in the way see the reason we don't want to hear more word is because we're set in our ways and we got to hunger for more of the word we got to be honest and say god there's more i can learn about serving you i don't serve you perfectly i want to serve you better i can't stand it no more i can't even stand through this sermon blowy out the door it goes that's right you can't do it but to put new pentecostal wine you got to have new bottles right and the new bottles is new skin is still got animal oil on it that's the new skin praise god and you begin to preach the baptism of the holy spirit the love of god divine healing signs and wonders a new skin when the bible said jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever that new skin will say amen that's right and it'll stretch out amen see in other words that power will grow in you when you say amen i believe that and i really believe that brother jess that power is going to grow in you and you're going to feel it grow into your daily life amen oh hallelujah thank the lord the old skin will say oh dr jones don't teach it like that that's not that's not how i learned it first there you are that's the difference what we need today is a brand new set of pentecostal hides that's right to preach a pentecostal message and he said now pentecost is not your denomination now pentecost is an experience it's not a denomination pentecost is what you received amen praise god i'm a pentecostal bottle praise god hallelujah praise god although i was raised in a pentecostal church they didn't have the pentecostal models praise god but we've got the pentecostal bottles and the pentecostal wine amen glory it's what you receive i've got pentecost living in me praise god that's right it's for the methodist baptist lutheran catholic just just as much pentecost sometimes a whole lot more than those who call themselves that's right it's an experience when you can take it oh that's a good thing and when that new life begins to work and you read the bible says i'm the lord that heals all thy diseases then that new skin as that life begins to enter in it stretches out and says amen i believe it lord now so one example is this morning when i'm preaching you know keeping your focus if you really got the wine if you really receive that wine you'll say amen and you'll be more focused tomorrow right i mean if it's going to grow in you if it's going to stretch out and grow it's got to grow in you almost fell out there you got it's got to grow in your life if it has real power it's going to grow because the word is power the word is life just put it on your lips one time you'll see it it is life right keep it on your lips speak the word speak the word talk about the word the word is power the word is life it changes things amen see each time we hear it we gotta take what we hear and really receive that wine and then if it's real if we really received it and our heart was right it'll push out to more power yes that's what we need today is experience is a new birth now here's where he teaches it out of ezekiel this is the same sermon it's just a few paragraphs later about 10 paragraphs later that's what we need today now i want you to watch the order that ezekiel brought it in so brother says ezekiel preached on the new wine first before jesus did he said i'll give you a new heart i'll give you a new spirit i'll put my spirit in you i want you to watch there's three of it a new heart i'll take the old sony heart away that's the old different heart you have and i'll give you a new spirit now many times and there's been a terrible mistake the people has thought sometimes that the new spirit was the holy spirit but it isn't it's a new spirit okay go to ezekiel 36 here let's look at that verse 26 now actually if you look at verse 25 this is speaking of zechariah as well so this is speaking to when israel receives the baptism of the holy ghost the 144 thousand but we know they turned it down so peter gave it to the samaritans and the gentiles in other words the gentiles had got a new heart a new spirit and god's spirit amen amen because god will put them away if they don't want to receive it he'll put them away he'll cut off that branch as we said on wednesday and he'll put in that he'll attach the new branch he'll graft in the new branch that will live on the life of jesus i'm so glad i got that life praise god verse 26 so verse 25 is sprinkling new water on you that should be zechariah 12 right very familiar verse 26 a new heart also will i give you and a new spirit will i put within you and i will take away the stony heart of your flesh and i'll give you an heart of flesh and i'll put my spirit in you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them okay so the holy spirit as long as you surrender to it it's causing you to obey right so getting up in the morning right with your morning routine seeking god in the morning or whenever you seek god hopefully it's sometime in the morning your flesh may not want to do it but you've got to yield over and surrender and as soon as you let surrender and the holy spirit starts anointing you then he causes you to keep it praise god and then he then he blesses you in your obedience and surrender to him he causes it right he causes you to keep the word amen so every anytime that was anything good that came out of my life it wasn't me i just surrendered and then god caused me to do the work praise god so it's not my works really it's christ in me the hope of glory see it's the holy spirit but you you do have to yield your your will you do have to yield your will that's the one work that we can do yield our will to god and surrender people say remember that i preached on this a few months ago people say oh you don't have to do anything to go to heaven well that's the case judas is going to heaven hitler's going to heaven no you do you have to repent you have to believe you have to surrender your will to god's will you have to do something to go to heaven right but when you surrender then god gives you the gift of faith because it's not of yourself but it's a gift we're saved by grace through faith in the blood of christ so that's the key church surrendering our will to god amen he said i want you to watch there's three of it a new heart so see three steps just like justification signification baptism of the holy ghost praise god now many times yeah okay i already read that all right next one god gives you a new why couldn't why you couldn't even get along with yourself with your old spirit now listen church if we're having trouble just getting along day to day maybe something's wrong with our sanctification you should you should get along with yourself right you should obey god's word we should obey god's word and we should enjoy many days we should enjoy the wine and power that jesus gives us right but if you can't get along with yourself how are you going to get along with the holy ghost so sanctified people can get along with themselves right but they're still not really getting along with the holy ghost as far as obedience to the word of god he said sometimes people a new heart a new heart of flesh so so you will receive it then a new spirit in that heart then i'll put my spirit in that you see new heart new spirit and my spirit three things he spoke of so there it is so ezekiel first preached jesus's new wine teaching right the new heart is justification which is the new animal skin you gotta have a new skin first and then the new spirit is you gotta have oil you gotta have the animal oils in those skins and then lastly is my spirit then last when you have those new new uh then you pour in the wine and then the wine can grow in power glory i hope that makes sense brother branham taught that right i just showed you the quotes brother branham teaches this this is how jesus's parable on the new wine is understood and church that's what i love about god there's so much continuity with god amen his three numbers right justification sanctification baptism holy ghost father son holy ghost right faith hope and charity all these numbers all go together it's the same story we just see new scriptures bringing it out like the new wine ah thank the lord amen praise god okay thank you lord so that's the baptism of the holy ghost so new wine is the seal of god in the soul right so the soul is the nature so when you have christ's spirit in your soul uh that spirit takes more control more control it grows how many how many believe it to grows it grows in your your your nature and your desires for god should grow if it don't i question whether it's there how can you have wine and it not grows praise god that's what i'm going to close with a little bit new wine goes to the soul but it also goes to the spirit let me prove it to you because it was taught in the old testament as well so look at ecclesiastes 10 19 a feast is made for laughter and wine makes merry that's in the natural but money answers all things so see wine represents joy gladness refreshment right so new wine new joy new happiness i'm refreshed right i was tired worn out negative depressed now i'm refreshed by what new wine david's sin with bathsheba he said created me a clean heart oh god renew a right spirit within me cast me not away from thy presence and take not the holy spirit for me there's that only all right restore to me the joy of thy salvation he's saying restore the wine to my human spirit my thinking right and uphold me with thy free spirit then will i teach transgressors thy ways and sinners shall be converted to thee so once i get that new line i'll start reaching out to other people praise god so this is old testament right there was old testament joy in the holy spirit but it was still in the human spirit it was in the second realm of man right look at this remember i preached this a few weeks ago with blessings and curses because thou serve is not the lord thy god with new wine can i say it like that i'm talking about in the in the human spirit because you didn't let your human mind get fresh joy and fresh revelation with gladness of heart for the abundance of all things therefore you'll serve your enemies therefore you will be addicted to sin which the lord shall send against thee and he shall put a yoke an addiction of sin until you've destroyed thee sounds like that brother in the corinthian church that was sleeping with his stepmom right he sent a devil he said let his soul go out to the devil that is i'm sorry let his body go to the devil that his soul might be saved if you won't take the fresh revelation if you won't take the new wine that's fine god's gonna he's got to chasing you right huh you can you can be a servant a happy servant you ever seen one a happy servant sometimes i get rebuked when we go to chick-fil-a and they seem happier to serve me than i am to get the food they're like oh it's my pleasure i'm like really right or you ever seen a happy waiter or happy waitress they just love to serve you now i know the guy at the car dealership he likes to serve you too but he's doing it for another reason he's happy for that reason i'm making a big sale today you know but try to find somebody of low estate that just loves what they're doing right they just love to serve well that's rare that's rare but god demands it god requires it if you won't serve with joyfulness and gladness of heart that's fine if you don't want my wife you can have the world but you're going to be addicted to the world and you're going to serve your enemies rather than serving me if you won't if you won't serve god then you'll serve man right and jesus said you're going to hate you hate one of them i don't want to hate jesus i'm going to love jesus i want to serve jesus with happiness amen it's my joy to wear out my voice i've been wearing it out for now what 16 years it's a joy to do that's a joy to wear myself out for the kingdom of god and i should always look at service as an opportunity to be joyful right and to uh to be glad about the things of god i love this the queen of sheba heard all about solomon she's like i'm gonna go test this guy out i'm going to go see she traveled all the all the way across the desert what did she find she said i couldn't even believe it i'm not going to have time to read it but this is what she concludes with your men are so happy so are your s even your servants are happy so around around her uh you know palace the servants were not very happy but when she got in the presence of saints that loved god even their servants were happy she said something's different here all my questions are being answered all the doctrines are lined up the gifts of god are working and even the lowest of the low they're happy praise god happy servants in the house of god i know god's with you amen because your servants are happy the lowest of the low the brother says happiness will reign when people rally around the gifts right the man said jesus was exhorting them uh in the saying of queen esheba the queen of the south come from the uttermost parts of the world to hear the wisdom of solomon god had give a gift and that gift was manifested and when god ever gives a gift he manifests it and may become known for the world and some days of solomon's gift the nations begin to learn that great things begin to take place and all the people with one heart and one accord begin to yes lord we thank you because we see this gift made real and sure jehovah is still for us if he'll send us a gift like that that's what made him happy because we see god moving in our midst church when we see god moving in our midst it ought to make us happy praise god it all do something for us to make us happy servants of the lord i'll serve you jesus all my days because you've done this in my life and you ministered this way and you answered my question here you've done all these things that makes me so joyful lord i'll do anything i'll serve you all my days and that was under the old testament church that was under the blood of bulls and goats not the blood of jesus now look honoring god with your natural possessions brought new wine right so you only got new wine if you honored god with your possessions well the same is applies to spiritual if you want new wine in the spiritual you've got to honor god with all spiritual things right in other words you if you want new wine you have to make a spiritual investment and honor god with your time or else you're not getting new wine look honor the lord with my substance and with the first fruits of all thy increase in other words give god first place right give god your first so shall your barns be filled okay so if you don't your barns won't be filled you got to give god first and that and thy presence shall burst out with new bursts they'll be mercy bursting out with new wine if you just give god the first give god the first part of your time praise god give god the best part of your day put him first in everything and the bible promises new eye will come gushing out praise god how many witnesses we got out there there you put god first you're gonna get a blessing later on praise god if you put him first the bible says if you sow to the spirit you'll reap of the spirit so see a natural law teaches you get natural wine if you obey the spiritual law you get spiritual wise so now we know why some people aren't so happy all the time right they say i believe the message they say i believe brother is the prophet i believe i got the holy ghost i believe well where's all the joy then well you only get the joy it now i'm not talking about the soul you only get the joy in the mind when you uh honor god with your mind and think god's thoughts first psalms 4 6 there be many that say who will show us any good lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance thy presence upon us that or thou hast put gladness in my heart more than in the time that their corn and wine increased so he's saying lord let your presence raise up in me in other words i'm going to seek your face your countenance i'm going to seek your face and i'll feel better in your presence than natural wine isn't that exactly the spiritual wine church the spiritual wine is better than natural wine praise god peter tried to tell him that on the day of pentecost you're saying knew what and that's line he said it's spiritual one it's what joel prophesied of this spiritual is much greater than natural oh my thank the lord this church this is much the spiritual is much greater than the natural line but you gotta honor god with the first right you gotta under god first in the mind and then the new wine is promised to come now i didn't get to this but i didn't actually i didn't have time to get to these quotes but brother adam said after the revelation of the seals remember he shut in for eight days eight days he shut in and tried to fast and see god he did have a few meals but he said the revelation was the greatest revelation ever had he said the bible became a new bible the services were the greatest services he ever had with amen and he didn't fly one mile oh we think oh well i gotta fly at least to the next state to get a good revival oh for the bible for me to have a fresh start i've gotta at least go there or there or there or at least gotta no you just gotta get along with jesus whatever jesus is that's where you got to go praise god amen right right can i hear my echo is there an echo out there kind of so if we want the bible to if we're if we're you know a little bored reading the bible a little bored listen brother ram sermons it's because we got to change our thoughts we got to get back to a new spirit new thinking right because if you try to put new revelation in an old dried up mind a set in your ways thinking it's going to burst hallelujah now i got lots of scriptures but i'm going to try to close here the bible said stir up your mind by way of remembrance that means stir it up that means agitated see the only way you're going to be excited in your mind is by remembering scriptures because the bible says stir your minds up by way of remembrance right so to order to remember scripture you most often have to go back to scripture or listen to a sermon oh i remember that oh that was such a blessing praise god so if you want a stirred up mind if you want a new mind the bible says that you got to stir it up you got to spend time with god if you want new wine you got to put god first in your thoughts right if you want new wine in your experience with god remember what the bible say tran how do you renew your how do you transform your mind present your body a living sacrifice right and then transform your mind and then you can prove the perfect will of god but it doesn't come until you lay you present your body as a sacrifice unto god see put him first put god first pray first read your bible first study first do that first present your body as a living sacrifice first and then your mind gets transformed then you know the next step you know how to do god's will see how it all see how it all ties together i love that we don't have to change our doctrine by god's grace i've had to i've rarely had to change any my doctor and that's a blessing so brother i went through the hard times he had to change his doctor a lot so we don't have to right because remember in 1952 he said oh he said oh great third person of the trinity he said just come and reign in our hearts how we love you in our hearts and so i sent that to brother joseph i said is the third person of trinity right in your heart and he said i believe every word brother ham said was thou saith the lord hebrews 13 8 i said well i don't agree i believe the one person of god lives in my heart not the third person you can believe whatever you want but it's not right so see all these scriptures about daily renewing your mind paul says it twice be renewed by the spirit of your mind new new new wine new skins fresh oil right or fresh oil fresh revelation it comes by having a new mind renewing your mind that's the first thing uh on the armor of god right put on uh gird up the loins of your mind that's the first thing he says get your belt on so you're ready to travel right you're ready your mind is ready to start traveling through these thoughts and dealing with all these thoughts get your mind ready with truth make it new brother branham likens the revival in that same sermon back there in 57 to what a lake that has a storm and it pushes out all the trash he said that's a that's a revival right so we want new wine if we want a new revival we've got to push out all the things we're thinking about watching listening to uh sharing with other people we got to push out anything that doesn't honor god and we have to have a new mind we have to have new skins in order to get the new wine praise god let me just look at my notes all right so in closing i think that's my last one yeah that's my last one so jesus said no man puts new wine in old bottles a man would not be that wasteful may god help us not to waste our time god's not going to waste his time church if a man won't even waste his time oh this is the old this is the old dry condition i'm not going to put wine in there i'm going to waste both if a man won't even do that jesus said god won't even do that this means god doesn't send a fresh anointing until our hearts are made new with repentance think about it church when is anybody you've ever known received a fresh anointing when their attitude and their mind is off on the things of the world can you name me one i can't think of one but it's people that they have fresh anointings they're like oh i just read this in the bible or my i just heard this on the tape and they're just they're just bubbling over right it's new it's fresh wine because their minds are totally consumed with the things of god god will not send a new wine revival to have growing power until your mind is made new until all the trash is cast out and it's a new skin and it's got oil in it then he'll pour in that fresh revelation of his word he'll wait until there's a new skin and oil and this goes into we jesus said if you want to if you want to do the if you want your first love if you want your your new wine back all right if you want the new wine back do the first works right get your mind back on christ he said stir up your minds by way of remembrance i was listening to a sermon yesterday uh invisible union i listened to it what's part of it friday the rest of it yesterday brother branham spent 15 minutes at least just with the altar call church i how much time do i usually spend on the call like two minutes we'll sing one song now i know it was a different age but i just it just it just spoke to me like he's just giving people a chance to recognize do i have new skins or do i have old skins right and pretty soon one would come up and another and remember he said it was thanksgiving message he said oh usually it's mostly women up here it's mostly men up here today so god was dealing with men through that message the men realized i got to renew my mind or my mind rather so i can have new wine and what is wine church power power it's power of joy the joy of the lord is my weakness i know the joy of the lord is my strength see when you ask for new wine when you ask for fresh wine you're asking i want to be stronger to stand up against the wiles of satan i want to be a stronger witness i want to be a stronger testimony i want to show people god's love in a stronger way lord give me fresh wine like david said restore the joy restore the gladness restore my happiness while i'm serving the lord let's stand that was good thank you holy spirit see we don't have to change our doctrine it all fits see what jesus preached was already preached by ezekiel everything with this that's why we know the bible's that's why we know the seals have been torn off and the mystery is finished because these things jesus said they are already preached back there by ezekiel by joel by isaiah jeremiah musicians you can come here power power [Music] oh i didn't i didn't get to this but there's so many joy or gladness of heart in the new testament on the day of pentecost they gladly received his word see they had that new spirit they went from house to house with their meat and gladness and singleness of heart my the gentiles were glad and glorified the word of the lord so what does what does wine make you do makes you praise god makes you worship god oh church that's my prayer for you and i hope that's your prayer for me that we'll be glad we'll be joyful with god's wine with god's power let's bow our heads here for word of prayer i'm going to ask the lord to help us not be stuck in our ways to break out of that remember
