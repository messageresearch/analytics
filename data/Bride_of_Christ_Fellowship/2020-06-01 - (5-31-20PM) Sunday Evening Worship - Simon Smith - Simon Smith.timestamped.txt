[33:43] all right we'll get into the study here
[33:46] by the grace of God actually talking
[33:55] about this up there Daniels and I
[33:58] actually had our Sunday school teacher
[34:03] there mr. Barve and then my niece there
[34:07] Allison are doing the Sunday school
[34:09] together now Allison does the projects
[34:13] the artwork projects and then lack of
[34:34] voice singing abilities or even lack of
[34:37] teaching abilities but we just want to
[34:39] be be a blessing see okay
[34:44] so we'll start here in 1st Kings 20 and
[34:47] verse 1 well read the scripture then
[34:52] we'll say a word of Prayer ok to convey
[34:59] the thought is the Lord even to me at
[35:02] first Kings 20 verse 1 and ben-hadad the
[35:05] king of Syria gathered all his hosts
[35:07] together and there were thirty and two
[35:10] kings with him and horses and chariots
[35:13] and he went up and besieged Samaria and
[35:15] Ward against it and he sent messengers
[35:18] to Ahab king of Israel into the city and
[35:20] said to him and thus saith been a dad
[35:22] look what this king is saying is he the
[35:26] king is saying Koufax l'chaim my silver
[35:29] and thy gold is mine my wives also in
[35:32] thy children even the goodliest our mind
[35:35] and the kingdom of israel answered and
[35:40] said my lord o king according to thy
[35:42] saying I am thine and all that I have
[35:45] it's all yours but notice this is the
[35:49] first battle and notice for it takes
[35:52] place the compass Harry Deerling father
[36:02] Lord Jesus so we just love you Lord Lord
[36:05] is freshness the start is so fresh Lord
[36:07] to me Lord and I just really thrilled
[36:10] Lord and Lord Jesus or just decided to
[36:13] bring it forth children here and largest
[36:16] blessed service God Lord and or just to
[36:18] annoy me Lord accordingly in order the
[36:20] ears of the word as well God Lord and
[36:22] look we just want to magnify you and
[36:24] glorify your Lord and orders the angels
[36:30] the elders all around about that throne
[36:32] God or worshiping you Lord and others
[36:34] are crying of holy holy holy holy holy
[36:36] Lord day and night Lord Jesus or we want
[36:40] to be counted worthy of God or jek to
[36:42] even give you a praise God and we want
[36:44] to give you all the
[36:46] we cannot pray enough Lord we can't
[36:50] worship you we love you so much blessa
[36:52] social service called a name Jesus
[36:54] Christ amen
[36:57] now here King Ahab of Acts the King not
[37:06] a really good man a lure as the Provost
[37:09] at a lower caliber of a man to come as a
[37:11] king to Israel to lead the very children
[37:14] of God the very people of God but though
[37:19] the main thought at the end I wanted to
[37:21] convey the main thing is I want is I
[37:22] want to show you the end the end the
[37:26] very end result so today I liked her
[37:28] tonight I'd like to teach on real
[37:31] realization and if you could imagine
[37:36] what it would be like to be maybe God
[37:39] all-powerful all-knowing not a doubt has
[37:43] ever entered his mind he's never even
[37:46] known fear outside of Jesus Christ when
[37:48] he's at the cross there the Bible said
[37:50] it was in that time when he was said to
[37:52] a feared but that was in his flesh that
[37:54] was separated from the Holy Ghost then
[37:57] he appeared but outside of that he
[37:59] doesn't he knows no fear he's a lion a
[38:02] tribe of juda he he can do it all and if
[38:07] he was to convey a thought if there's
[38:11] always one thing he seems like if you
[38:13] read the scripture I've been seeing more
[38:15] and more scriptures ending like this so
[38:20] let's go in here a little a scripture
[38:21] reading here look at Deuteronomy 4 and
[38:24] 33 he says did ever people hear the
[38:28] voice of God speaking out of the midst
[38:30] of the fire this is what God came down
[38:31] to Moses Moses now approach God in the
[38:35] kind of way and approach it was because
[38:38] it was a holy ground why because God was
[38:39] there he says and then out of this bush
[38:42] that was burning in this fire that was
[38:44] culminating there's a voice come out of
[38:46] the fire start speaking to Moses
[38:48] revealing who he was
[38:49] Moses obviously blown away he was moved
[38:53] and touched by God coming down and
[38:55] meeting him in this kind of way and
[38:58] now here God is iterating things he said
[39:00] did ever people hear the voice of God
[39:01] speaking out in the midst of the fire as
[39:04] thou has heard and live or hath God a
[39:07] swayed to go and take him a nation from
[39:09] the midst of innovation by temptations
[39:11] and by signs and wonders by war and by a
[39:13] mighty hand and by a stretched out arm
[39:15] and by great terrors according to all
[39:17] the Lord your God did for you in Egypt
[39:18] before your eyes but now notice what God
[39:20] wants to become a here he says unto thee
[39:26] that thou mightest know that the Lord he
[39:29] is God
[39:31] there is only one person that was in
[39:33] before Genesis 1:1 and that was Jesus
[39:36] Christ right God Almighty the invisible
[39:38] one came and he was as he said Elohim
[39:41] the self existing when he dwelt all by
[39:44] himself with all these attributes coming
[39:46] forward the end he wanted to splay
[39:48] everything he golfs however you did he
[39:49] had it all he is everything he said that
[39:53] thou mightest know they he's the Lord he
[39:55] is God he says there is none else beside
[39:58] him so as God springs forth creation he
[40:03] brings forth creating everything from
[40:05] from the first seven days everything
[40:07] sprung forth out of that right he
[40:09] created the heavens and then there was
[40:10] the angels that the devil was there the
[40:13] Fallen Angels were there at the time all
[40:14] that so God had everything in motion he
[40:17] was creating one big story who's writing
[40:19] what is pistol like that and he wanted
[40:23] to show some things all right but after
[40:28] the fall took place in heaven now Satan
[40:31] his angels would come down and they were
[40:39] started the sons and daughters of God he
[40:42] reverted the race called the serpent
[40:45] that's not the original serpent the
[40:47] original serpent did not have a soul but
[40:49] now we have these men on earth the
[40:51] beasts modern movies that there are
[40:53] serpents may have now a soul so we see a
[40:58] perversion on the scene
[41:01] and as these I'll say this beings now
[41:07] mingling on the seat we can't we don't
[41:09] know who's who and as these things are
[41:11] to bring forth and come forth of them
[41:14] intermarrying and all those things the
[41:18] fall seed line will bring forth other
[41:20] thoughts of creation of God now start
[41:28] bringing forth this religion and that
[41:31] religion and as uh the last count I've
[41:33] heard it was like almost fifty thousand
[41:35] different denominations churches within
[41:37] the Christian ranking I'm not talking
[41:41] Muhammad and Muslims I'm just talking
[41:43] within the Christianity there's over
[41:45] fifty thousand now different styles or
[41:47] different branches different this or
[41:49] that alright so as he conveys this he
[41:52] says there is none else besides him so
[41:55] also here in Isaiah 45 verse five he
[41:57] says I am the Lord he says there is none
[41:59] else there is no God beside me i curtly
[42:02] now as not though thou has not known me
[42:05] that they may know from the rising and
[42:07] Sun from the going and for the West that
[42:09] there is none beside me he says I am the
[42:11] Lord and there is none else's one thing
[42:14] God wants to prove there's one thing God
[42:16] always wants to show is that He is God
[42:19] Almighty amen there is one God there's
[42:23] not three persons in the Godhead there's
[42:25] not four persons two persons there's
[42:27] only one person in the Godhead and that
[42:29] is just a great revelation it is coming
[42:32] this age I can't I can't I can't
[42:34] remember when I first heard it earlier
[42:36] in 2001 and I and it was just blow me
[42:39] away that there's that all the sports
[42:41] teaching is just grasp the entire world
[42:44] the whole religious realms this false
[42:46] teaching of Trinity but now here in
[42:50] verse seven he says now look what God
[42:51] says he says I formed the light I create
[42:54] darkness I make peace I create evil I do
[42:57] I the LORD do all these things right
[43:00] he's done at all he he's the one that
[43:02] set this thing in motion absolutely
[43:04] he says drop down he heavens from above
[43:06] and let the skies pour down righteous
[43:08] let the earth open pieces and let them
[43:11] bring forth salvation let righteousness
[43:13] bring up together
[43:13] I the LORD have created it Amen what he
[43:16] was trying to convey notice is the Book
[43:19] of Isaiah one two or three thousand
[43:21] years afterwards he is trying to convey
[43:23] that he is God even now after creation
[43:27] after all these things he's trying to
[43:28] get instilled in the people there is no
[43:32] on else there is no other God and this
[43:35] is after what the mighty delivered so
[43:37] Moses and and bringing all those things
[43:39] Abraham Jacob and Isaac and all those
[43:41] everything that God has done even to
[43:43] this point he was still trying to get
[43:45] this instilled in their minds that there
[43:49] is no other God there's one God hey man
[43:52] now let's continue reading here he says
[43:56] woe unto him that striveth
[43:57] with his maker well lord I thought you
[44:01] were this and I thought you were that
[44:02] God what God says is what he means he
[44:06] says let the potsherd strive with the
[44:07] pressures of the earth shall the clay
[44:10] see him to him that fashioned him what
[44:11] make us now or thy work he had he hath
[44:14] no hands woe unto him that hath said to
[44:17] his father what be get a sty or to the
[44:19] woman what has now brought forth in
[44:21] other words we don't have anything that
[44:23] the place into the mind of God God knows
[44:26] it all he's thought of all he's never
[44:28] had a new thought he'd never have an old
[44:30] thought he knows it he's eternal being
[44:34] so they're always with him he says thus
[44:39] saith the Lord God the Holy One of
[44:41] Israel and his maker ask of me things to
[44:44] to come concerning my son's and
[44:47] concerning the work of my hands command
[44:48] ye me I have made the earth and created
[44:51] a man apart
[44:52] I even my hands have stretched out the
[44:54] heavens and all their hosts of I have
[44:56] commanded and yet even at this time
[44:58] there are many false religions and
[45:00] beliefs about the stars and Bowl and the
[45:04] Moon and Mars and the wandering stars
[45:07] and that these are God's just traveling
[45:09] around and with Greek mythology Roman
[45:12] mythology all those things and yet God
[45:14] is trying to a to convey and to teach
[45:17] and to show that what I have done all
[45:20] this everything else is false there's
[45:23] only one God and he goes on and on even
[45:26] in verse
[45:27] he says he says for thus saith the Lord
[45:30] that created heavens God Himself that
[45:32] formed the earth and made it he has
[45:35] established that he is created not in
[45:37] vain but he formed it to be inhabited he
[45:40] says I am the Lord and there is none
[45:42] else now look what he says here I have
[45:45] not spoken in secret in other words he
[45:46] gave us this entire book out of all the
[45:51] religious books in the world the Koran
[45:53] you name any other religious book
[45:55] Eastern religion God still has his word
[45:58] here for us to learn from he did not
[46:01] leave this a mystery this this word has
[46:04] been here since what the oldest book
[46:05] they say is the book of Job and that was
[46:08] now written down and then start
[46:10] compiling after Moses and now we have
[46:12] the complete sixty-six books of the
[46:13] Bible right which is all we considered
[46:15] this the absolute infallible Word of God
[46:17] absolutely he says I've not spoken to
[46:20] speak secret and in dark in in a dark
[46:22] place of the earth I said not unto the
[46:25] seed of Jacob seeking me in vain I the
[46:28] Lord speak righteous I declare all these
[46:30] things declare the flare things that are
[46:33] right so here we know that the Word of
[46:35] God is true
[46:35] I'm spilled a foundation here all's well
[46:38] but notice the Book of Isaiah he
[46:40] continually reiterates and trying to
[46:42] tell these people and pound it into
[46:44] their skulls there is only one God he
[46:50] says tell me and bring them near me yay
[46:52] let them take counsel together who has
[46:54] declared this from ancient time who had
[46:57] told it from that time have not I the
[46:59] Lord and there is no God else besides me
[47:02] oh just God and a Savior there is no one
[47:06] else
[47:06] he's there's none beside me look unto me
[47:09] and be ye saved all ends of the earth
[47:11] Jesus for I am God and there is none
[47:13] else but remember at the end of this
[47:17] revelation at the end when there we when
[47:20] he says there's one God one God one God
[47:22] I am he I am he
[47:24] I'm he there's none else none else right
[47:26] what is the end result gonna be here in
[47:29] verse 23 he says I have sworn by myself
[47:31] the word has gone out of my mouth and
[47:34] righteousness and shall not return
[47:36] this is this is the whole thing that
[47:39] unto me every knee shall bow every
[47:43] tongue shall swear at the end when this
[47:49] thought this false doctor this false
[47:52] religion this crazy thing or back or
[47:56] whatever springs up religiously even
[47:58] even even even uh evolution you name any
[48:03] thought outside the Word of God he says
[48:08] but the end result will be that every
[48:09] that unto me every knee shall bow and
[48:12] every tongue shall swear because every
[48:16] religion has a claim every every thought
[48:18] has a claim well this is gonna take
[48:20] place and this is gonna take place but
[48:21] in the end God will show who is the true
[48:24] not omnipotent potentate of all amen
[48:26] now let's continue on here by the grace
[48:28] of God now back to this here Brenna dad
[48:31] and he was attacking Israel he was he'd
[48:34] light up all his waters he camps Samaria
[48:36] and and of course you know he says all
[48:43] they call that you have a ham it's mine
[48:45] he has like well okay and this snapped
[48:47] well then wasn't the next thing we see
[48:48] out that after a ham says yes absolutely
[48:52] all that I have is mine he speaketh a
[48:57] ham he said I told you all your wife all
[49:00] your children all your gold silver
[49:01] everything house oh I'm gonna send guys
[49:04] to get it now no he's serious he's in
[49:11] cat me now he wants demands he wants all
[49:13] these things and a hams not having it
[49:17] now now look up her saying all the
[49:19] elders and all the people send him
[49:21] hearken not in him nor consent so at
[49:24] first he's like sure you know just to
[49:25] make peace just kind of mend things over
[49:28] you just just whatever but now when it
[49:30] came down to it was serious to where
[49:32] that King Brenna dad said I want it now
[49:34] I'm coming to get it hey HAP said I
[49:37] better not let this happen he says but
[49:40] now look look what takes place here yep
[49:44] yeah is a Backson king he's a heathen
[49:46] king as far as one
[49:48] the worse there and behold there came a
[49:51] profit on the ham king of Israel saying
[49:54] thus saith the Lord has now seen all
[49:56] this great multitude November 1/2 was
[49:58] serving other gods he married Jezebel he
[50:00] he was serving other gods and now death
[50:03] come into his camp to take everything
[50:07] take his life but now look what God says
[50:10] thus saith the LORD hath now seen all
[50:13] this great multitude behold he says I
[50:15] would deliver into thine hand this day
[50:17] and what was the end result and thou
[50:20] shalt note that i am the lord so at the
[50:26] end of this battle god was a had to know
[50:28] one thing i am the god not these other
[50:32] gods that you're worshiping he's but i
[50:34] am coming down to deliver a man
[50:37] absolutely we know about the story god
[50:40] comes down he defeats them then round
[50:44] out comes round two with king bennett
[50:52] well remember it took place in Samaria
[50:55] what fishes what the hills correct now
[50:57] we've been through all heard the story
[50:59] and the prophet came in to the king of
[51:02] Israel and said to him go strengthen
[51:03] myself and Mark and see what thou dost
[51:05] for at the return of the year the king
[51:07] of Syria will come up against thee and
[51:09] the servants of the king of Syria send
[51:11] him their gods or gods of the hill Hills
[51:15] therefore they are stronger than we but
[51:19] let us fight against him in the plane
[51:20] and surely we were stronger than they
[51:22] see one thing if any head that had not
[51:24] learned was that this is God now he is
[51:31] thinking or whatever he is surrounded a
[51:34] city where the king was asked Samaria
[51:37] and he lost the battle instead well
[51:39] there's a hill right there we lost the
[51:41] hill there gods must have power in the
[51:43] hill he said well he said let's meet him
[51:52] in the plane because whatever God they
[51:55] have probably will not be able to beat
[51:57] us there but now once a gun
[52:00] a year later returned
[52:02] Benna dad number the his Syrians and
[52:04] went to a to fight Israel and the
[52:07] children of number four but the Bible
[52:09] says the Syrians filled the country
[52:11] there's so many of you rounded up and
[52:14] there came a man of God and speaking the
[52:16] king of Israel said to him thus saith
[52:18] the Lord because the Syrians have said
[52:20] the Lord is God of the hills but he is
[52:23] not God of the valleys even though very
[52:26] god that created the valleys therefore I
[52:30] will deliver all the screep multitude in
[52:33] nine hand and ye shall know that I am
[52:36] the Lord
[52:39] you mean they have still did not learn
[52:41] that he was that this was God after that
[52:44] first battle in Samaria they won he
[52:47] still went and worshipped as false idols
[52:49] false gods but even now once again God
[52:53] is going to show his his king of his
[52:56] people that he is God not of just the
[52:58] hills but he's a God of the valleys a
[53:00] man he's a God of the good time than the
[53:02] gap gotta leave the tough times amen
[53:04] sure now let's continue on here look
[53:11] here I'm building up to something here
[53:14] and Exodus 6 and 5 now look what takes
[53:19] place here God is speaking you if you if
[53:22] you read the scripture and just type in
[53:23] these kind of these words here you'll
[53:26] see this runs all the way through he
[53:28] says and I have also heard the groaning
[53:30] of the children of Israel whom the
[53:32] Egyptians kept keep in bondage and I
[53:34] have and I have remembered my covenant
[53:36] wherefore saying to the children of
[53:38] Israel I am the Lord and I will bring
[53:40] you out from under these burdens of the
[53:42] Egyptians and I will rid you out of
[53:43] their bondage and I will redeem you and
[53:45] you will redeem you with the stretched
[53:48] out arm and with great judgments and
[53:49] I'll take you for to me for a people and
[53:52] I'll be to you or God and ye shall know
[53:55] that I am the Lord your God so he let
[54:00] the Israelites become slaves for 400
[54:05] years taking all those things they were
[54:08] laboring hard mortar for brick and all
[54:11] those things and bringing the straw and
[54:15] how they were mixed in how
[54:17] but at the end one thing he wants to
[54:20] show the people at the end of this
[54:23] mighty deliverance he wants the people
[54:26] to know that He is God no one else no
[54:32] Egyptian god when they the Israelites
[54:35] were with you in Egypt right there for
[54:36] those forty years they saw Egypt worship
[54:38] every single God that they're ever
[54:40] probably they could ever make up
[54:41] including pride cats but at the end God
[54:45] was going to show that Jehovah the great
[54:48] I am the eternal one
[54:50] He is God amen he says and I you shall
[54:54] know that I am the Lord your God which
[54:57] bringeth you out from under the burdens
[55:00] of the Israel burns of the Egyptians
[55:02] Amen now let's continue on here and the
[55:05] Lord said to Moses see have I made the
[55:07] god to Pharaoh and Aaron thy brother
[55:09] shall be thy prophet thou shalt speak
[55:11] all that I command thee and Aaron thy
[55:13] brother shall speak in the Pharaoh that
[55:15] he sent the children Israel out of his
[55:17] land and I will harden Pharaoh's heart
[55:19] and multiply my signs and my wonders in
[55:21] the land of Egypt but Pharaoh shall not
[55:23] hearken unto you that I made lead that I
[55:26] may lay my hand upon Egypt and bring
[55:29] forth my own armies and my people and
[55:31] the children Israel out of the land of
[55:33] Egypt by great judgments and the
[55:35] Egyptians not only is this judgment or
[55:39] this Redemption this salvation this
[55:42] deliverance going to prove to Israel
[55:44] that he's God but Jesus also said he
[55:46] says he's and the Egyptians shall know
[55:49] that i am the lord because remember
[55:53] after that last death hit that last
[55:55] plague hit of death the word got out and
[56:01] all the nations around about even in the
[56:03] promised land as israel would start
[56:05] gathering and start moving start camping
[56:07] and informing the one church nation the
[56:11] work that the nations round about would
[56:13] hear about what their God did to Egypt
[56:16] and his brother Brooke said one time he
[56:18] says and they never Egypt never
[56:20] recovered they never did absolutely
[56:23] their pours poor can be why God went and
[56:27] wiped them out
[56:29] and if they didn't learn by then that
[56:32] Jesus Christ is God they never will
[56:34] until the end
[56:37] amen amen all's well now God always
[56:44] wants to make himself known some he
[56:51] reveals you're on this side many many
[56:54] others I think the God we know we know
[57:02] the mystery this is in fact program
[57:04] sentencer cheese book he says the
[57:05] Godhead was the greatest mystery we know
[57:09] and we know it he said that was the
[57:12] highest mister I came from the exact
[57:15] words but he said it was like the
[57:17] greatest revelation was the Godhead to
[57:22] know that there is only one God and not
[57:24] just one God but it was a God that could
[57:28] form a body a human body called Jesus
[57:31] that was perfect that was sinless and
[57:32] then that invisible God that can come
[57:34] and dwell inside of it and now he's
[57:36] become the complete man why did we come
[57:39] and flesh because the salvation would
[57:41] come in flash anyhow okay he says now
[57:47] bring me against my land that the
[57:49] heathen may know me so a lot of times
[57:54] Redemption delivers he God wants the
[57:58] even the heathen to know that his gut
[58:00] that Jesus Christ is gone a man now
[58:04] [Music]
[58:06] mister he said thou shall fall upon the
[58:09] open field for I have spoken to saith
[58:11] the Lord God and he said I will send a
[58:12] fire on Magog and among them that dwell
[58:16] carelessly in the aisles and they shall
[58:19] know that i am the lord so will I make
[58:23] my holy name known in the midst of my
[58:25] people Israel Jesus and I will not let
[58:27] them pollute my Holy Name anymore and
[58:29] the heathen shall know that I am the
[58:32] Lord the Holy One of Israel behold he
[58:34] has come it is done saith the Lord it is
[58:36] the day that I have spoken
[58:39] we're up I have spoken so at the end of
[58:43] all things all the entire world know
[58:47] there is one God the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:50] amen now we're we getting this from as
[58:53] far as uh scripture in Psalms 46:10 it
[58:58] says be still and know that I am God he
[59:00] says I'll be exalted among the heathen I
[59:02] will be exalted Jesus Christ everything
[59:14] they go out and they get a job they make
[59:16] money all these things become wealthy
[59:21] and all that who gave that Jesus Christ
[59:24] absolutely God even allowed this age to
[59:27] bring forth cars nice lush vehicles we
[59:31] can ride around and who gave that to us
[59:32] that was God he allowed those things to
[59:35] be contacted and now made for smartboard
[59:39] he says hey all Kings shall fall down
[59:43] before him all nations shall serve Him
[59:46] that men may know that thou whose name
[59:49] alone is Jehovah art the most high over
[59:51] all the earth
[59:52] a man so the heathen shall fear the name
[59:55] of the Lord and all the kings of the
[59:57] earth I glory when the Lord shall build
[59:59] up Zion he shall appear in glory amen
[1:00:03] all the kings they shall praise thee O
[1:00:05] Lord when they hear the words of I all
[1:00:11] the kings a man I want that see what the
[1:00:13] Millennium it'll be obvious in the
[1:00:16] Millennium he's God his kingdom his
[1:00:20] government will be set up for 1,000
[1:00:23] years
[1:00:24] and there'll be the throne there'll be
[1:00:26] the the bride the bride a 144,000 be the
[1:00:30] Chamberlain's to the bride there or
[1:00:32] however and and it'll all be set up and
[1:00:37] at certain times they'll be feasts at
[1:00:40] certain times will be this times that
[1:00:42] come up for worship and this and that is
[1:00:43] all gonna be set up around Jesus Christ
[1:00:46] no
[1:00:49] you on here notice here even in the Old
[1:00:52] Testament or New Testament wherefore God
[1:00:55] also hath highly exalted him and given
[1:00:57] him a name which is above every name
[1:00:59] that at the name of Jesus every knee
[1:01:02] shall bow pieces of things in heaven and
[1:01:05] things of earth and things under the
[1:01:07] earth and that every tongue should
[1:01:09] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[1:01:12] glory of God the Father how hard would
[1:01:16] it be for our politicians right now to
[1:01:19] do this for the wicked
[1:01:21] could you see I'll just say you see the
[1:01:23] pride the arrogancy of our government
[1:01:26] the world leaders our president right
[1:01:32] now occur one he is just saying thank
[1:01:34] God thank God thank God he's actually
[1:01:36] acknowledging that there is a God it's
[1:01:38] Jesus I don't know the condition of his
[1:01:41] heart or our past president he was not
[1:01:43] like that president before that was not
[1:01:46] like that but there's coming a time
[1:01:51] where everybody's gonna have to humble
[1:01:53] themselves now here's what I want to get
[1:01:58] to I don't know how long this will be
[1:02:01] but I want to bring this in to show you
[1:02:03] something here by the grace of God
[1:02:07] in Daniel there's Cobra Graham said he's
[1:02:14] a Dan the Book of Daniel is like the
[1:02:15] Book of Revelations in fact I want to
[1:02:20] show you let me let me fir let's go off
[1:02:21] target here real quick I want to show
[1:02:23] you something here in Daniel that's boss
[1:02:28] chapter no programs in the angel Burton
[1:02:31] seven thunders said he heard the same
[1:02:34] thing at John looking for a while but I
[1:02:38] think I found here Daniel 12 Daniel 12
[1:02:47] verse 4 look what God says he says but
[1:02:50] Thou O Daniel shut up the words and seal
[1:02:52] the book even to the time of the end
[1:02:55] many shall run to and fro and now it
[1:02:58] shall be increased did you know that the
[1:03:01] end times now show me increase we can go
[1:03:03] up in the sky and fly and all those
[1:03:05] things then I Daniel looked and behold
[1:03:07] there stood another to the one on this
[1:03:10] side of the bank in the river and the
[1:03:11] other on the side of the bank of the
[1:03:12] river and one said to the man clothed in
[1:03:15] linen which was upon the waters of the
[1:03:17] river how long shall it be to the end of
[1:03:20] these things now look what it says and I
[1:03:22] heard the man clothed in linen that was
[1:03:24] upon the waters of the river when he
[1:03:27] held up his right hand and his left hand
[1:03:30] in heaven and swear by him that liveth
[1:03:32] forever and ever and it shall be for a
[1:03:33] time and times and a half-dozen that
[1:03:36] sound like revelations 10 mighty you
[1:03:39] comes down with his hands he swears by
[1:03:40] himself the time shall be no more and
[1:03:43] when he shall have accomplished to the
[1:03:45] scatter the power of the holy people all
[1:03:47] these things shall be finished now look
[1:03:48] at verse 8 and I heard but I understood
[1:03:52] not that is when Daniel heard the seven
[1:03:57] thunders but he never understood them
[1:04:00] and let me throw a little bonus a little
[1:04:02] hint in there Daniel never walk with
[1:04:06] Jesus Christ Daniel never heard Jesus
[1:04:09] Christ speak but when Daniel heard those
[1:04:12] thunders he understood
[1:04:15] now in Revelations 10 John is now caught
[1:04:19] up into the heavenlies and in the spear
[1:04:21] raptured up and type and he hears the
[1:04:24] seven thunders augur it never said he
[1:04:27] did not understand them when John saw
[1:04:31] revelation 17 that woman with all the
[1:04:34] harlots and and riding on the beast with
[1:04:36] ten horns and all those things in the
[1:04:38] waters and città the waters all those
[1:04:39] things John said he was amazed he said
[1:04:45] he said he was astonished at what he saw
[1:04:48] he did not understand he does this but
[1:04:52] when he heard those thunders and never
[1:04:53] said that amen
[1:04:59] now I'll go that far Daniel 4 verse 10
[1:05:03] thus were the visions of my head in my
[1:05:06] bed I saw and behold a great behold a
[1:05:09] tree in the midst the earth and the
[1:05:10] height thereof was great
[1:05:11] and the tree grew and was strong in the
[1:05:14] height thereof reached unto heaven the
[1:05:16] sight thereof until the ends of the
[1:05:17] earth
[1:05:18] notice this what this would represent
[1:05:20] all the way to the end of time meema the
[1:05:23] leaves are fair the fruit there as much
[1:05:25] and it was much and it was meat for all
[1:05:27] and the beasts of the field has shadow
[1:05:29] on her and the fowls there dwelt in the
[1:05:31] boughs thereof and all the flesh was fed
[1:05:33] of yes right now look what look what he
[1:05:38] sees here he's he's seeing the vision he
[1:05:39] said it's all of these dreams or
[1:05:41] whatever and I saw in the visions of my
[1:05:43] head upon my bed and behold a watcher
[1:05:46] notice how the Bible says hey watch her
[1:05:48] remember he's a heathen king and he sees
[1:05:51] something spiritual two beings come down
[1:05:55] he said a holy one he's in the nurses
[1:05:58] this one he says it's a watch notice the
[1:06:02] words he picked he said a watcher a
[1:06:05] watcher what is he what is he what is
[1:06:08] that identifying what was he picking out
[1:06:09] about this being what is he saying about
[1:06:12] this being he's a watcher a watcher has
[1:06:17] to have eyes
[1:06:21] amen and I saw in the vision my head
[1:06:24] upon my bed and behold a watcher and a
[1:06:26] holy one came down from heaven and he
[1:06:28] cried aloud and said thus and said thus
[1:06:31] hew down the tree and cut off his
[1:06:34] branches shake off his leaves and
[1:06:36] scatter his fruit let the beasts get
[1:06:39] away from it in the fowls the air his
[1:06:40] branches nevertheless leave the stump of
[1:06:42] the room the earth even dying brass and
[1:06:44] all those things right so the Holy One
[1:06:47] says cut down this tree and there's a
[1:06:50] watcher watching everything heard it and
[1:06:54] he was watching but notice he says let
[1:06:57] his heart be changed from man's and let
[1:07:01] a beasts heart be given unto him what is
[1:07:05] a man the man said he's that there's a
[1:07:09] real man is like Christ he said Jesus
[1:07:12] Christ was the realist was the man of
[1:07:14] all men not brawny and strong and all
[1:07:17] this and that's like muscle rippling and
[1:07:19] all that but he was a man a character a
[1:07:22] character humble meek loving all the
[1:07:26] fruits of the spirit dwelling in that
[1:07:28] man but let his heart be change from
[1:07:32] man's from a man's and let a beasts
[1:07:36] heart be given unto him and let seven
[1:07:38] times pass over him
[1:07:40] what is God showing here remember never
[1:07:43] never can either was that head of gold
[1:07:46] and as God used him to signify the start
[1:07:50] of the Gentile kingdom all the way out
[1:07:51] to the end he chooses Nebuchadnezzar as
[1:07:55] that first King a head of gold had the
[1:07:58] most glory the most powerful the most
[1:08:00] wonderful the most beautiful kingdom of
[1:08:02] all the rest he says let this King's
[1:08:07] heart turn into a beast and let seven
[1:08:13] times pass over him and we know that
[1:08:14] word that number seven always represents
[1:08:16] the seven church ages so what's gonna do
[1:08:21] what is what is God trying to show
[1:08:22] through this what are you trying to say
[1:08:23] now look he says this matter was by the
[1:08:26] notice you when the King first mentioned
[1:08:28] he says a watcher but now he says this
[1:08:31] matter is by the decree of the Watchers
[1:08:33] plural
[1:08:36] now just watch her but Watchers and the
[1:08:40] man by the word of the Holy Ones to the
[1:08:44] intent that the living may know and what
[1:08:46] is this hew down the tree that the
[1:08:48] living may know what that the most high
[1:08:51] rules in the kingdom of men and gives it
[1:08:54] to whomsoever he will and so does the
[1:08:56] set it up over the basis of man he's
[1:09:01] going to do this to show that what he is
[1:09:03] God he's the King of Kings the Lord of
[1:09:05] lords a man now look what gill says this
[1:09:08] matter is by the decree of the Watchers
[1:09:11] plural that is the cutting down the tree
[1:09:14] what it is signified by was with the
[1:09:17] advice consent and a permission of the
[1:09:20] watchers by whom is generally understood
[1:09:23] angels not they were authors of this
[1:09:27] decree but approvers of it and we're
[1:09:31] ready not only to subscribe it but to so
[1:09:36] God came down with one of his Watchers
[1:09:40] and he told these Watchers he said take
[1:09:43] this tree now for seven sure changes
[1:09:50] amen
[1:09:52] you're catching it already why were they
[1:09:56] called Watchers superstitious man called
[1:10:01] Daniel one of his gods right and two men
[1:10:04] come down two feet and he said you're a
[1:10:07] watcher why because it has eyes and the
[1:10:15] appearance of the wheels and their works
[1:10:16] was like unto the color of the barrel
[1:10:18] and the four had one lightness and they
[1:10:20] four had one lightness and their
[1:10:22] parents' was their work as it were a
[1:10:24] wheel in the middle of the wheel when
[1:10:27] they went they went on their four sides
[1:10:28] they turned that when they went and as
[1:10:30] for the Rings they were so high that
[1:10:33] they were dreadful and the rings were
[1:10:35] full of eyes round about them for here's
[1:10:38] your watchers said they called the
[1:10:43] wheels the wheels he says because the
[1:10:44] Ark of the Covenant was in motion it
[1:10:47] but now it is set up in heaven and when
[1:10:51] the living creatures went cause them
[1:10:58] living creatures and the wheels went by
[1:11:02] them and when the living creatures were
[1:11:03] lifted up from the earth the wheels were
[1:11:05] lifted up honestly God and all that was
[1:11:08] with him Ziqi Oh 10 11 when they went
[1:11:19] they looked upon their four sides they
[1:11:21] turned not as they went but by the place
[1:11:23] where whither the head look as they
[1:11:25] found it and he turned not they turned
[1:11:27] not as they went and their whole body
[1:11:29] their backs and their hands and their
[1:11:31] wings and the wheels were full that they
[1:11:36] had they forehand so here is these
[1:11:39] beings these watchers and eyes all
[1:11:41] around for these these are the exact
[1:11:46] same feasts or living creatures notice
[1:11:52] as John was caught up now into heavenly
[1:11:53] at the time of the rapture look as he
[1:11:56] sees God and all his glory surrounded by
[1:11:59] the elders verse 6 and before the throne
[1:12:03] there was a sea of glass like in the
[1:12:05] crystal and in the midst of the throne
[1:12:06] round about the throne were four beasts
[1:12:09] full of eyes before these are what the
[1:12:15] watchers the first piece was like a lion
[1:12:18] the second beast was a calf the fruit
[1:12:20] the third beast was like a man the
[1:12:21] fourth was like a flying eagle and the
[1:12:24] four beasts had each of them six wings
[1:12:25] around about them and they were full of
[1:12:26] eyes within a man and they rest not day
[1:12:30] or night saying holy holy holy Lord God
[1:12:32] Almighty which was which is and is to
[1:12:34] come a man showing what the beast these
[1:12:36] were the closest was to God and what
[1:12:38] they were worshiping holy man then when
[1:12:41] you get closer and closer to the present
[1:12:44] God you will worship amen
[1:12:46] because we see these are the closest
[1:12:48] right now to him even right now and they
[1:12:51] will not stop worshiping night and day
[1:12:53] amen yes sir
[1:12:56] praise the Lord and when those beasts
[1:12:59] give glory and honor and thanks to him
[1:13:00] that sat on the throne who live
[1:13:01] forever look at the Prophet says here
[1:13:06] now notice they have eyes in the front
[1:13:09] and back within who are these I'm saying
[1:13:12] like this well just use the scriptural
[1:13:13] time term in Revelation for who are
[1:13:15] these beasts now we see it you'll call
[1:13:17] them living creatures but the Bible says
[1:13:20] here they call it beast he says now
[1:13:22] notice they have eyes and he's EQ one
[1:13:24] here in front in the back within let's
[1:13:26] just read that looky here let's see here
[1:13:28] I believe they spoke through their hear
[1:13:30] beasts for faces like an eagle wings
[1:13:33] full of eyes running without look and
[1:13:36] they flew and so forth and they had eyes
[1:13:39] within without and behind his spoke of
[1:13:42] their intelligence they know it was
[1:13:45] which is and which shall come they known
[1:13:50] all for they was right at the seat so
[1:13:54] close to they wasn't even human now I
[1:13:58] had never understood this or even seen
[1:14:00] this - I just was studying this here
[1:14:02] he says temple guards or not tumble
[1:14:06] guards the temple guards 144,000 but
[1:14:08] this is the mercy seat guard the throne
[1:14:12] guards the throne right up next to God
[1:14:16] he calls him what living creatures next
[1:14:21] thing - calm next thing to God standing
[1:14:23] there their intelligence they know what
[1:14:25] was which is and we shall come they had
[1:14:27] eyes without showing that they could see
[1:14:30] what it was to come watch eyes within
[1:14:35] knows everything now and eyes and back
[1:14:38] node which one was Watchers they could
[1:14:41] see all through time which was which
[1:14:48] isn't which shall come reflecting
[1:14:50] through the church ages he that was
[1:14:52] which is and shall come Jesus Christ the
[1:14:54] same yesterday today and forever these
[1:14:56] Watchers now now look what I if you look
[1:15:00] in the study in the in the in
[1:15:01] description and he has made into us
[1:15:03] kings and priests and we shall reign on
[1:15:05] earth and I beheld on what is mentioned
[1:15:07] here and I beheld and I heard the voice
[1:15:11] of many angels
[1:15:14] I set round about the throne and the
[1:15:19] beasts and the elders and another of
[1:15:25] them was ten thousand times ten thousand
[1:15:26] ten thousand dollars right now I never
[1:15:29] knew this till just recently here and
[1:15:31] here in Revelations four it means a
[1:15:33] living creature not a beast but it's
[1:15:36] called a beast but it isn't same thing
[1:15:38] is it you won and what we just read
[1:15:39] there right okay but these are living
[1:15:42] creatures what are they
[1:15:44] he says they are not angels this Jesus I
[1:15:50] tell you what let's read in Revelations
[1:15:52] 5 and that's just what we read I heard
[1:15:55] the voice angels throne conjunction
[1:15:57] beasts and elders see and a conjunction
[1:16:00] they were not angels neither were they
[1:16:02] elders they are they were living
[1:16:04] creatures at the throne a totally
[1:16:07] different kind these living creatures
[1:16:11] not angels because it proves it right
[1:16:12] here this is a totally different kind of
[1:16:16] breed of creature these are not fair
[1:16:19] serums or cherubims this is something
[1:16:22] different now now there's three
[1:16:26] different categories here I hope you got
[1:16:29] this system down here now I want to show
[1:16:32] you there's three different categories
[1:16:33] three different species
[1:16:36] look now around the throne I had never
[1:16:40] known that these are absolutely separate
[1:16:42] different kind of creatures I had no
[1:16:43] idea and now look at the prophecies
[1:16:46] here's the throw now the first at this
[1:16:49] throne is the four living creatures
[1:16:50] outside of that there are 20 and around
[1:16:57] this is great host of he says see what I
[1:17:01] mean there every one different one from
[1:17:03] another
[1:17:04] there is angels there's elders and here
[1:17:06] is living creatures let's not leave that
[1:17:11] for a minute let's just hold it right
[1:17:12] there a minute living creatures what
[1:17:14] what are they if they're not angels
[1:17:16] they're not redeemed man like an outer
[1:17:19] would be what are they would you like to
[1:17:22] know here's my interpretation I hope
[1:17:23] it's right I believe it is they are
[1:17:25] God's
[1:17:26] guards
[1:17:28] his stroke and that's about as far as
[1:17:31] you went now these are going to now
[1:17:35] we're going to erase this in just a
[1:17:38] little bit you know they're not angels
[1:17:39] nor man they're not wild beasts they're
[1:17:41] creatures living creatures and a holy
[1:17:49] one came down to Nebuchadnezzar and a
[1:17:53] watcher which is one of these holy
[1:17:55] creatures or all four of them however
[1:17:56] you want to call it come down and this
[1:18:00] man said shoo down this tree the
[1:18:03] Watchers were watching everything note
[1:18:05] all about it the seven would be today
[1:18:07] than what they would take the the the
[1:18:08] heart of a beast for seven church ages
[1:18:11] and he says cut it down and the Prophet
[1:18:19] brought this out is Matthew Mark Luke
[1:18:21] and John correct right he said that
[1:18:23] these are actually the four Gospels is
[1:18:25] the protection of the holy spirit or the
[1:18:27] book of Acts right amen now what is the
[1:18:31] beautiful thing about this this is the
[1:18:32] seven churches like this the seven seals
[1:18:34] a brother asked me this one time said
[1:18:36] brother Simon what was the importance of
[1:18:38] the seals tell me what you know about
[1:18:39] the seals what is the main point of the
[1:18:42] seals I said well the first one was a
[1:18:44] white horse rider was brought forth to
[1:18:46] deceive the second was the red horse
[1:18:48] rider was that the kill to wipe out the
[1:18:50] Christian sixteen million killed
[1:18:51] understand and then the next one was to
[1:18:54] to uh to take the money the wealth of
[1:18:58] the world the other ones to bring for
[1:19:00] death right he said brother you got it
[1:19:02] all wrong I go what he said you missed
[1:19:05] the revelation of the seals
[1:19:06] I got what and I took it very humbly I
[1:19:09] was like of what the seven seals was
[1:19:17] about he said brother it was it only
[1:19:19] revealed the semi sea was only revealed
[1:19:23] not only he's not only the working of
[1:19:26] the Antichrist spirit but it revealed
[1:19:30] that God had a combating anointing for
[1:19:35] each one that would that would overcome
[1:19:36] it the revelation behind the seals was
[1:19:39] that God had something
[1:19:41] you see that's like I never thought that
[1:19:45] was pretty good and you know that's
[1:19:47] exactly what the problem said he says
[1:19:49] now notice as the Antichrist went forth
[1:19:52] he went forward on his feasts of
[1:19:54] ministry there God sent forth a beast to
[1:19:57] combat it Oh God had this all planned
[1:20:04] what one beast four beasts four seven
[1:20:08] Church ages Satan had four different
[1:20:11] types for seven church ages for what is
[1:20:13] the number of deliverance hey man I just
[1:20:16] got done with a job in Clyde Ohio
[1:20:18] setting these these big huge generators
[1:20:21] and there was for everything I was doing
[1:20:22] was for for for for you know forests is
[1:20:26] the number of deliverance
[1:20:27] how many beasts now watch he says then
[1:20:32] every time the Beast rode on his horse
[1:20:34] the Antichrist rode on his horse and on
[1:20:36] his beast to announce his ministry God
[1:20:39] sent his beast also and he was on that -
[1:20:43] announced to combat to it now the
[1:20:46] scripture says when the enemy comes in
[1:20:48] like the squad the Spirit of God raises
[1:20:50] a standard against a man every time the
[1:20:53] antichrist spirit rode out with a horse
[1:20:55] a horse a different kind of annoying
[1:20:57] thing what God would send us like this
[1:20:59] would send a living creature anointing
[1:21:01] defeated so when the enemy would have
[1:21:06] the Antichrist gods had a certain type
[1:21:08] of power out to meet him and he went out
[1:21:11] again is a right Horace berry color of
[1:21:13] all power another ministry God step one
[1:21:15] set another app another one after him to
[1:21:18] come combat it to hold his church
[1:21:22] all right you know these things now look
[1:21:26] here back to Daniel
[1:21:33] as the king Nebuchadnezzar tells Daniel
[1:21:35] this dream Daniel
[1:21:41] starts the interpretation he says he
[1:21:45] says King he is this tree the street
[1:21:47] trees as it is thou o King that are
[1:21:51] grown and become strong for thy
[1:21:53] greatness is grown in a three Stern to
[1:21:55] heaven and they didn't Dominion to the
[1:21:57] end of the earth and where is the King
[1:21:59] saw a watcher and a holy one coming down
[1:22:02] from heaven and saying hew down the tree
[1:22:05] and destroy it look at verse 24 this is
[1:22:10] the interpretation or Kang and this is
[1:22:12] the decree of the Most High that has
[1:22:14] come up upon the upon my lord the king
[1:22:16] that they shall Drive thee from man
[1:22:22] who's they
[1:22:23] and thy dwelling shall be with the
[1:22:26] beasts of the field and they shall make
[1:22:27] the eat the grass the oxen and they
[1:22:30] shall wet thee with the dew of heaven
[1:22:32] these are the Watchers so who's gonna
[1:22:37] bring this kingdom down for seven
[1:22:41] churches what is God going to use to
[1:22:44] bring the kingdom down seven churches
[1:22:48] look at this here
[1:22:51] and all this came upon King
[1:22:54] Nebuchadnezzar and at the end of 12
[1:22:56] months he walked into the palace of the
[1:22:58] kingdom of Babylon and the King spake
[1:23:00] and said is not this great Babylon that
[1:23:04] I have built for the house of the
[1:23:07] kingdom of my might of my power and by
[1:23:10] and for the honor of my majesty while
[1:23:12] the world was Word was yet in the Kings
[1:23:14] mouth there fell a voice from heaven
[1:23:16] saying O king Nebuchadnezzar to deed has
[1:23:19] spoken the kingdom is departed from thee
[1:23:21] and they shall Drive thee from men and
[1:23:26] thy dwelling shall be as the beasts of
[1:23:28] the field they shall make the grass as
[1:23:29] oxen seven times shall pass over thee
[1:23:31] the type here now look what it says if
[1:23:37] you notice what takes place as the Word
[1:23:41] of God went forth the decree of the Holy
[1:23:43] One of God Almighty comes down since
[1:23:45] your
[1:23:46] kingdom has departed notice there's four
[1:23:49] stages
[1:23:50] it's a Nebuchadnezzar the same hour was
[1:23:55] fulfilled a thing upon Nebuchadnezzar
[1:23:58] and he was driven from men driven a lion
[1:24:10] which is the strongest among beasts
[1:24:13] turneth not away for any sure the Lord
[1:24:20] God will do nothing but he revealed the
[1:24:21] secrets upon his servants the prophets
[1:24:23] the lion roars who'll not fear the Lord
[1:24:27] God has spoken
[1:24:28] who can but prophesy the God said your
[1:24:31] kingdom is a part of what the God has
[1:24:33] spoken
[1:24:34] woe unto you to desire the day Lord to
[1:24:37] what end is it for you for the day of
[1:24:39] Lord is darkness and not light as if a
[1:24:42] man did flee from a lion
[1:24:45] God sent that first lion anointing -
[1:24:49] what - run Nebuchadnezzar out of his
[1:24:52] palace into the wilderness notice lion
[1:24:57] anointing lion came and down now look
[1:25:01] here what it says in the first church
[1:25:02] age I know thy works and thy labour
[1:25:04] their patience and how thou cannot bear
[1:25:06] them which are evil I mean if this is a
[1:25:09] type of the seven churches which it is
[1:25:13] and that has tried them which say they
[1:25:15] are not which are apostles and are not
[1:25:16] and found them liars look a the prophet
[1:25:20] says now cannot spare them which are
[1:25:22] evil these Asians believe that God's
[1:25:26] people ought to be holy according to
[1:25:28] this verse they took steps to keep the
[1:25:31] body unleavened from sin a man they
[1:25:33] drove out the wicked what would that
[1:25:36] lion anointing a man praise be to God he
[1:25:39] says most evidently the EPOXI was
[1:25:41] already started seeing that enter into
[1:25:43] the church but they were obedient to the
[1:25:45] words of paul when they said put away
[1:25:48] put away the wicked from amongst them
[1:25:51] that lion anointing on that first church
[1:25:54] age ran the false out ran the sin out
[1:25:57] ran
[1:25:57] I'm free to the Word of God everything
[1:25:59] contrary to the Spirit of God ran it out
[1:26:01] and now we see what that lion anointing
[1:26:05] had run out
[1:26:05] Nebuchadnezzar as well they come out of
[1:26:08] the world and now that we're going to
[1:26:10] going to let the church enter among them
[1:26:13] they would not put up with the signature
[1:26:15] holiness wasn't a phrase to them or a
[1:26:18] figure of speech it was a way of life
[1:26:20] hey man he said no notice he says the
[1:26:25] Antichrist road first him teaching
[1:26:27] ministry now watch the one that went to
[1:26:29] meet him the lion the lion true true
[1:26:31] tribe of Judah which is the word when
[1:26:33] his false teaching went forth the true
[1:26:35] word went out to meet him and exposed
[1:26:37] him he said they are not a not true
[1:26:40] apostles and they're not true Jews amen
[1:26:42] now he said that's the reason the early
[1:26:46] church had healings and miracles and
[1:26:48] visions and power is because it was a
[1:26:51] Living Word oh my like a living creature
[1:26:55] hallelujah he says in the tie and he
[1:26:58] says in the form was his form in the
[1:27:00] form of the lion I would you to riding
[1:27:02] out to combat that aim so the first
[1:27:05] thing judges Nebuchadnezzar drive him
[1:27:07] out a man running for chase him with
[1:27:09] that lion anointing and he's four and
[1:27:12] that first watcher did exactly that now
[1:27:16] the next thing to take place that that
[1:27:18] took hold of him was he did eat grass as
[1:27:21] an ox
[1:27:23] hmm what if her just runs it sure does
[1:27:27] lion now this has kind of two types here
[1:27:32] let's look at both of them here's a
[1:27:37] Balak talking with with mo heaven and
[1:27:41] all these things and they're looking at
[1:27:43] Israel and they're seeing Israel
[1:27:46] destroying everything every battle and
[1:27:49] more of some of the elders a minion now
[1:27:52] shall this company link up all around as
[1:27:55] an oxen lick a--the up the grass of the
[1:27:58] field so what will this false sure
[1:28:03] Oh Dominion that Nebuchadnezzar
[1:28:04] represents and falls Gentile church
[1:28:08] changes at both Gentile oxen anointing
[1:28:24] hit him and made him what eat grass
[1:28:28] notice now this is religious and Hebrews
[1:28:35] 5 11 and 12 13 14 notice if a true if
[1:28:40] you were truly religious if you're if
[1:28:42] you're son of God daughter of God if
[1:28:43] you're if you're saved what does the
[1:28:45] Bible set you will eat he says you will
[1:28:48] either milk or meat but this anointing
[1:28:53] hit this King and I was like that's when
[1:28:55] you refuse the truth you'll never have
[1:28:57] milk or meat again you able to eat right
[1:29:00] off the dust of the ground just like an
[1:29:03] animal but sons and daughters of God
[1:29:05] they'll take the milk and don't eat the
[1:29:09] meat just like Eagles amen
[1:29:11] absolutely now moving on in the same out
[1:29:16] of the single spilled upon
[1:29:17] Nebuchadnezzar and he was driven from
[1:29:19] men and did he grass like an oxen and
[1:29:21] his body was wet with the dew first
[1:29:28] anointing he was run out by the lion
[1:29:30] second he started destroying licking up
[1:29:33] the grass of the children of God like
[1:29:34] crazy and he would not but now notice
[1:29:43] and his body was
[1:29:55] [Music]
[1:30:15] [Music]
[1:30:20] as the
[1:30:22] [Music]
[1:30:30] [Music]
[1:30:54] [Music]
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:47] [Music]
[1:31:57] now has a little strength and has kept
[1:31:59] my word and has denied my name
[1:32:09] [Music]
[1:32:13] already mentioned how these strength was
[1:32:16] returning it was what this mist and the
[1:32:20] power of the Inquisition had wane people
[1:32:23] had left their homelands notice that
[1:32:26] Nebuchadnezzar quit eating at this time
[1:32:28] he was done eating licking the grass but
[1:32:31] now watching he was covered with Dew the
[1:32:35] people had left their homelands and
[1:32:36] demanded freedom worship the yoga the
[1:32:38] hierarchy was being broken the
[1:32:39] governments were fighting it was not
[1:32:42] wise to champion one segment against
[1:32:44] another in fact well-meaning but poorly
[1:32:47] led people are willing to wage war to
[1:32:49] defend perhaps the greatest show of
[1:32:54] strength the greatest show of strength
[1:32:58] of religion in this age was the fact
[1:33:01] that though France fell and revolution
[1:33:04] break Leslie and revival kept the
[1:33:06] revolution away from Great Britain and
[1:33:09] saved her to be an instrument of God in
[1:33:11] the hand of God for many wars the
[1:33:15] preaching of the word memories of the do
[1:33:17] shall come from haven't dropped on that
[1:33:19] body cover it the preaching of the word
[1:33:21] was never greater and that man age and
[1:33:27] that do just God using his Watchers
[1:33:33] you'll see the eyes
[1:33:40] living creatures the throne guards were
[1:33:43] sent to destroy us as sage and raised up
[1:33:48] his hordes of free thinkers as the
[1:33:50] originators of commies rose up as
[1:33:52] liberal theologians spread their filthy
[1:33:54] where's God raise up mighty warriors of
[1:33:56] faith and the greatest works of Krissy's
[1:34:00] is the greatest works of Christian
[1:34:02] literature and teaching and preaching
[1:34:04] came from this era never has his
[1:34:11] preachers and teachers been matched and
[1:34:14] never will they be all the doctrines of
[1:34:23] God they were identifying the Catholic
[1:34:25] Church's Antichrist before this message
[1:34:29] even though he says never has his
[1:34:44] preachers and teachers in math and never
[1:34:46] will he be the Spurgeon the Parkers the
[1:34:49] Clarence the Edwards the bunions the
[1:34:51] Muellers brenards
[1:34:53] the bars the bishops all came from this
[1:34:59] era they preached taught and wrote the
[1:35:03] word they glorified the same hour was
[1:35:15] the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar

[1:37:26] and kill millions upon billions upon
[1:37:28] billions they have the heart of the
[1:37:30] beast that is not even that is a

[1:37:51] the heaven and my understanding returned
[1:37:52] unto me
[1:37:54] they're gonna have a revelation right

[1:38:11] every King every tongue will confess
[1:38:14] that Jesus Christ is Lord praise be to
[1:38:18] God
[1:38:18] and all the heavens the earth are
[1:38:20] reputed as nothing and he doeth
[1:38:23] according to his own will in the army of
[1:38:25] heaven and among the inhabitants and
[1:38:28] none can stay his hand or say to him
[1:38:29] what does no one can mess with Jesus he
[1:38:33] is God he does as he pleases and he'll
[1:38:35] do what he does until he's done with it
[1:38:37] hey man and at the same time my reason
[1:38:41] returned unto me and for the glory my
[1:38:44] kingdom is mine honour and brightness
[1:38:45] returned to me and my counselors and my
[1:38:47] Lords sought unto me and I was
[1:38:49] established in my kingdom and actually
[1:38:50] excellent majesty was added unto me now
[1:38:54] I never Knesset November God did this
[1:38:57] all to the head of gold

[1:39:08] [Music]
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:32] he was showing what God was showing at
[1:39:35] the end all these Kings would say Jesus
[1:39:40] Christ is the king of kings
[1:39:42] now I never can answer phrasing is off
[1:39:44] the honor and honor the king of heaven
[1:39:46] all whose works are truth in his ways
[1:39:49] judgment and those that walk and pride
[1:39:51] he is able to abase what will it be like
[1:39:56] that
[1:39:56] when that door shuts let's say the
[1:40:01] heavens are rolled away as a scroll
[1:40:03] what's that blew up in the sky what's
[1:40:05] that black in the night what if that all
[1:40:07] rolls away
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:22] mine was the original and there is where
[1:40:25] the Antichrist came up in combat and he
[1:40:28] raised up another power we sent a power
[1:40:29] to meet it and then the last power
[1:40:33] brings down the Eagle to restore the
[1:40:35] children back to the original faith
[1:40:37] again of their fathers he says the Eagle
[1:40:40] then you notice there is no more beast
[1:40:43] that's all of it
[1:40:45] see this is all prophesied all the way
[1:40:47] back in Daniel in the Book of
[1:40:48] Revelations amen
[1:40:51] that's all over that's the end now
[1:40:52] you'll have to take now if you would
[1:40:55] have would take now revelation I'm be
[1:40:58] referring to it he says all the
[1:41:00] mysteries God revealed the eagle a man
[1:41:03] now let's stand it's been an hour just
[1:41:07] over an hour's stand stretched a little
[1:41:08] bit I know it was just a long teacher
[1:41:10] I'm sorry I just that's just how I built
[1:41:12] we're just hobos all right here now
[1:41:17] here's what I want to hit the saints of
[1:41:21] God as as the heathen will come to the
[1:41:26] revelation the realization that he is
[1:41:30] going and God would use his throne
[1:41:32] guards to break down these kingdoms if
[1:41:37] the seven churches these religious
[1:41:40] entity
[1:41:40] these religious leaders although God is
[1:41:42] using these annoyances to destroy him to
[1:41:44] prove they can't even mess with the
[1:41:46] strong guard the lone God and I remember
[1:41:48] those strong guards are what extensions
[1:41:50] are attributes of God himself not was
[1:41:53] the Lion of the tribe of you he is the
[1:41:54] lion tribe of Judah
[1:41:55] he was an oxen lay down his life a
[1:41:57] burden sacrifice he was the very wisdom
[1:42:00] of God he is he knows all it is
[1:42:04] he's also neatly oh he's a prophet he's
[1:42:07] a seer you can see at all he's wrote at
[1:42:08] all he knows it all and unto the Angel
[1:42:12] of the Church of the Laodiceans write
[1:42:13] these things saith the Amen the faithful
[1:42:15] and the true witness I put that in here
[1:42:20] just cuz he is the true witness now this
[1:42:23] word true is the same word we saw back
[1:42:26] there in Revelations 3 7 now you recall
[1:42:30] it does not mean true as in contrast
[1:42:32] with false Jesus as a richer deeper
[1:42:34] meaning by far it expresses perfect
[1:42:38] realization and contrast partially this
[1:42:44] came up in the Laotian churches perfect
[1:42:47] or real realization is coming now back
[1:42:51] in Philadelphia nage and the Lord was
[1:42:53] drawing nigh what great love that age
[1:42:56] manifested for him it reminds me of
[1:42:57] those words in 1st Peter 1:8 who whom
[1:43:00] whom having not seen you love and whom
[1:43:02] also you now not see yet believing you
[1:43:05] rejoice with unspeakable joy and full of
[1:43:07] glory with them we rejoice also we
[1:43:11] haven't seen him but we have felt him we
[1:43:16] know him as much as our limiting senses
[1:43:17] can let us but one day it will be face
[1:43:20] to face this is there that is for this
[1:43:25] age he is coming at the end of this age
[1:43:27] partial realization will be made perfect
[1:43:31] realization complete realization how
[1:43:37] though he says we've been looking
[1:43:38] through a glass darkly but soon we'll be
[1:43:40] face to face we have been going from
[1:43:43] glory to glory but soon be right in the
[1:43:45] glory and in his glory will shine we
[1:43:48] shall be like him honestly like him
[1:43:50] Jesus our Savior divine isn't that
[1:43:52] wonderful we are completing him that is
[1:43:54] true he would not lie to us about it but
[1:43:57] one day we'll be changing the atoms we
[1:43:59] will put on immortality we were swallow
[1:44:00] be swallowed up in this life then we
[1:44:02] will realize realization I think on this
[1:44:08] we all know him as a provider I'm gonna
[1:44:13] have a job or has who gave us a job
[1:44:16] Jesus Christ every one of us has been
[1:44:19] sick and who was healed us in Jesus
[1:44:22] Christ we know him as so much as a
[1:44:26] friend when I was when I'm lonely I say
[1:44:28] Lord and you feel his presence come down
[1:44:30] you want to commune with him in a lot of
[1:44:34] time not even for his sake just for
[1:44:35] yours so you can feel comforted you know
[1:44:36] sometimes you need to gotten flesh
[1:44:38] sometimes needs to God one time I my
[1:44:43] apprentice had died and I was
[1:44:44] brokenhearted he was my little brother
[1:44:46] and I couldn't sleep at night I was
[1:44:49] praying in the woods I just I was a mess
[1:44:51] I got up one time at 3:00 in the morning
[1:44:53] what went down and read first John the
[1:44:55] entire book and God just said everything
[1:44:58] to rest just that book of love and just
[1:45:01] how it it just did something for my soul
[1:45:04] just calm to me and just settle me down
[1:45:06] and was able to write back to sleep
[1:45:08] battle anymore after that but we know
[1:45:11] God is a deliverer
[1:45:14] but we are look that kind of stuff is so
[1:45:18] minimal so tiny amount of information we
[1:45:22] know about him but when we get to the
[1:45:25] point when we get these bodies that we
[1:45:29] are going to realize we are really going
[1:45:35] to see all that he's about we're really
[1:45:38] going to get back and look at see how
[1:45:40] much he really loved us how much he
[1:45:43] cared for us how he washed our every
[1:45:45] step every question your past house in
[1:45:50] the world just when he was in world how
[1:45:53] many of us how old but there's a lot of
[1:45:56] things that happen
[1:45:57] they're in time I don't have but I did I
[1:46:01] have as you look back always can see how
[1:46:06] he kept us from making this decision no
[1:46:13] everything is going to be made
