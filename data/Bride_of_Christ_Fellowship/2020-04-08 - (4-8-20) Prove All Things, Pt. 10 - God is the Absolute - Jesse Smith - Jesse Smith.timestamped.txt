[18:39] prove all things series just oddly you
[18:45] know I was in study this week and
[18:46] started looking at the absolute again
[18:48] and and then today I listen to look at
[18:52] that again here tonight by God's grace
[18:55] renew Psalms 89 34 and then we'll read
[19:01] our memory verse I'm sister Naomi

[19:33] together on these two verses four seven

[19:40] it as we meditate on this scripture
[19:43] let's ask the Lord to write it upon
[19:46] their hearts and memory flippy ins four
[19:52] seven and eight
[19:53] let's read it on three one two through
[19:56] Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things
[20:00] are true whatsoever things are honest
[20:04] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[20:07] things are pure whatsoever things are
[20:11] lovely whatsoever things are of a need
[20:14] on your heart let's make it known to the
[20:16] Lord here every father we love you
[20:19] tonight we're gathered on this beautiful
[20:20] Wednesday night Lord God seeing Lord
[20:22] this beautiful change of season we're
[20:25] grateful for this weather Lord and the
[20:28] warmth and now Lord we're thankful for
[20:30] the warmth of your Holy Spirit your
[20:32] great Amen god bless yours being seen in
[20:34] Frank
[20:50] so by God's grace this week as I was
[20:53] preparing and you know just studying
[20:55] every day all throughout the morning I
[20:57] just kind of got on the topic of after
[21:00] laying of just a scriptural foundation I
[21:03] want to just go through numerous quotes
[21:06] from brother Branham just to solidify
[21:08] but it was always dealing with God
[21:11] Christ the Bible and divine things and
[21:17] never one time did brother Branham say
[21:19] my tapes are the absolute or did he ever
[21:23] place them on equal equal inspiration as
[21:29] the Bible Lord I believe that's one
[21:31] great sin today in my humble opinion
[21:34] it's idolatry to make every word any man
[21:38] said other than Christ thus saith the
[21:41] Lord so I want to just lay that little
[21:43] foundation here tonight by God's grace
[21:46] and just kind of focus in on this
[21:50] topic here now remember there's the
[21:53] false movement of the the tape church
[21:55] movement and they say everything brother
[21:59] Ram says is thus saith the Lord and he
[22:02] says my mess he said this message has to
[22:05] be my absolute and we'll get to that in
[22:07] a little bit but we know it depends what
[22:13] we mean by the app by the message if we
[22:16] said the message is my absolutely
[22:18] depends what you mean by the message if
[22:20] you mean every word on the 11-hundred so
[22:23] tapes a brother branham then that would
[22:25] not be we could say amen to that praise
[22:27] God
[22:27] so we want to focus on that tonight as
[22:32] the Lord will help us so there's a great
[22:38] confusion amongst that movement and I
[22:43] think I'll just start just with a couple
[22:45] very simple quotes just to kind of give
[22:48] you a foundation here and we'll get to
[22:51] it later now these are two in the
[22:53] absolute he said if you're absolute is
[22:57] some organization or some sensation or
[23:00] something else besides the person of
[23:02] Jesus Christ you'll come to the same
[23:05] portion of shame only worse if your
[23:09] absolute is not Jesus Christ he said
[23:13] upon this absolute I'll build my church
[23:15] upon Christ the word praise God so the
[23:19] absolute is a person it is the
[23:22] supernatural divine person of Jesus
[23:25] Christ here's another quote from March
[23:30] 4th 63 the absolute he said that's
[23:36] what's the matter in the Christian faith
[23:37] today is God here's another one and then
[23:43] we'll move on to some other thoughts but
[23:44] in January 27 63 in the absolute where
[23:49] the RAM said now if he is our absolute
[23:52] there can be no other absolute
[23:57] praise God so again again it's very
[24:01] important to lay down these foundational
[24:03] quotes along with the scriptures that
[24:05] we've read for our text how God can't
[24:09] break his covenant he can't change
[24:11] anything that's gone out of his lips
[24:13] because his word he a collection of mp3
[24:16] files we can't say it's a stack of paper
[24:18] books that are copies of William
[24:22] branham's sermons it's one person kind
[24:24] of gifts in 1963 brother Branham says
[24:27] Webster says an absolute is perfect in
[24:30] itself that means it has no heirs it's
[24:34] unlimited in its power it's primarily an
[24:38] ultimate unlimited in its power perfect
[24:41] in itself he said really is the ultimate
[24:45] praise God so to be absolute you have to
[24:48] have unlimited power praise God and
[24:51] brother Ram plainly says this in 1949
[24:54] I have no power within myself to do
[24:58] anything
[24:59] praise God Saints I have no power so no
[25:03] one is the absolute other than the
[25:05] person of Jesus Christ later in 1964
[25:09] persevere brother Graham says the same
[25:11] remember I have no power to heal I don't
[25:15] have power you don't have any power none
[25:19] of us does to show how to be the
[25:22] absolute you have to have full unlimited
[25:25] power and the only one that has that is
[25:28] Jesus Christ now here's a modern
[25:31] Webster's dictionary definition freaked
[25:35] me from imperfection
[25:37] perfect praise God it means free from
[25:44] mixture pure praise God and so this
[25:49] reminds a scripture in I believe it's
[25:52] Psalms where the Bible said God's Word
[25:54] is purified seven times praise God
[25:57] proverbs 30 every word of God is pure
[26:01] praise the Lord
[26:03] see brother Branham says there's mix-ups
[26:06] on his tapes but absolute is free from
[26:09] mixture praise God
[26:12] he said we always be careful what you're
[26:14] listening to because so much of it is
[26:17] the human side praise God
[26:21] so I want to just lay that down here and
[26:26] I did get a letter back from Jefferson
[26:29] every word on the tapes or the absolute
[26:30] and here's what the tape or here's what
[26:32] I'm quoting what the that one of the
[26:34] letters said I quote it must be all or
[26:37] nothing I have to believe everything on
[26:40] the tape is thus saith the Lord and the
[26:44] absolute of the token for our day
[26:45] I must unquestioning beliefs that's very
[26:49] dangerous it's a it's a false doctrine
[26:56] they did a false little quotation and
[27:02] they they try to put fear upon the
[27:05] people this is why I'm bringing this out
[27:07] because the Jeffersonville movement this
[27:10] weekend is you know shutting in and
[27:12] they're listening to their tapes and
[27:13] they have their schedules of tapes and
[27:15] that you're only abraham's royal seed if
[27:19] you believe every word on the tape is
[27:22] the stay at the Lord now that's that
[27:24] same spirit was in Jesus Christ will
[27:27] live among that every word will be
[27:29] punctuated with a Amen they believe it
[27:32] whom it takes that quote and they say
[27:36] that it applies to every word on the
[27:40] tape the word which was Christ was put
[27:45] on the outside knocking at the door
[27:47] trying to get some cooperation from
[27:49] somewhere to come in and make him
[27:51] I've known and so C and then brother
[27:56] Adam says that's when he says the truth
[28:00] liar they'll believe the whole thing
[28:02] because it's the Word of God so if you
[28:04] take this quote in context brother Brad
[28:06] was talking about the Bible this holy
[28:08] book right here praise God this is the
[28:11] absolute the scripture the word which is
[28:14] Christ it's the Word of God now this is
[28:17] inspired that's inspired the whole thing
[28:19] is inspired by the Holy Spirit so once
[28:22] again we see the leadership in
[28:25] jeffersonville misinterpreting the Word
[28:28] of God to their people but not to the
[28:32] Bride of Christ praise God amen so I
[28:37] quotes very quickly here brother random
[28:40] said he was not infallible we already
[28:42] heard to be absolute you have to be
[28:44] infallible unlimited second Ram said
[28:48] they're mixed up on his tapes he said
[28:50] look in the Bible for me beautiful words
[28:52] well Ram said prophets are not
[28:54] infallible people and most of these are
[28:57] direct quotes the RAM sent prophets make
[29:00] mistakes and every prophet made their
[29:02] mistakes but Lydia why don't you read 24
[29:06] Malachi 25 this just is a very simple
[29:09] scripture and it shows how God doesn't
[29:12] need anyone god is complete God is
[29:14] perfect God doesn't need you and I
[29:16] necessarily to do anything he's gracious
[29:19] and he gives us works to do Ephesians
[29:22] 2:10 is clear about that he's ordained
[29:24] works that we should do but really God
[29:26] is completing himself and I know we're a
[29:29] part of God right but it's not that God
[29:31] needs a man a human man or woman to
[29:34] accomplish anything it's his plan that
[29:38] will be accomplished because he himself
[29:41] wrote the plan and he will bring it to
[29:43] pass and he'll use man but he doesn't
[29:45] have to have them okay so acts 17:24
[29:49] Lydia verse 25
[30:00] neither's worshipped with men's hands
[30:03] seeing he giveth to all wife and rest in
[30:06] all things so Paul's good so whatever is
[30:12] the absolute is unlimited in its power
[30:15] and we know Jesus Christ is the absolute
[30:20] and that's true because he will be the
[30:22] standard everyone is judged by so Romans
[30:25] 2:16 whenever your education a man thing
[30:36] so that it so that if we're born again
[30:38] we don't come to the judgment praise God
[30:40] as far as the white throne judgment will
[30:42] go to the judgment seat for rewards Paul
[30:45] cause at the judgment seat of Christ we
[30:47] won't come to the white throne judgment
[30:49] but we'll be sitting with him with
[30:52] Christ on his throne in his throne at
[30:55] the white throne judgment praise God
[30:58] now the jeffersonville movement also
[31:01] uses a quote where brother Branham says
[31:02] if you have answers he said look on the
[31:05] tape but then they'll and they'll
[31:07] misinterpret that and say see all of our
[31:09] answers are on the tapes but let me tell
[31:12] you there's other quotes and so see
[31:15] that's what false movements always do no
[31:17] matter if it's from Jeffersonville or
[31:18] New York or any country Europe Africa
[31:23] Australia New Zealand Philippines any
[31:26] false movement misinterprets quotes and
[31:30] they contradict other quotes so here's
[31:33] some other quotes or brother Graham says
[31:35] he doesn't have all the answers services
[31:39] is the end time 62 but I haven't tried
[31:41] to introduce to you people a gimmick
[31:43] that has all the answers I've tried to
[31:46] be honest and to tell you what was the
[31:47] truth and I can only tell you as he God
[31:51] tells me another one why I'm against
[31:54] organized religion when you hear a
[31:56] prophet rising up that's got all the
[31:58] answers to every gimmick that you can
[32:00] bring up remember he's not a prophet so
[32:04] brother Branham has to warn the people
[32:06] if you see somebody who says it says
[32:07] their prophet and they got every answer
[32:09] to everything he said that's not a
[32:11] prophet in
[32:14] questions and answers on this seals in
[32:15] 1963 they asked brother Branham about
[32:18] his Moses and Elijah the literal men or
[32:21] not and he says I don't know he says if
[32:24] I don't know I'm just gonna tell you I
[32:26] don't know I don't know all the answers
[32:28] folks so on tape brother Ram says many
[32:31] times I don't have all the answers yet
[32:33] the church or the tape church movement
[32:35] will still try to propagate that idea
[32:38] that all the answers are on the tapes
[32:41] see they're trying to make the tapes the
[32:44] absolutely unlimited in power but
[32:47] they're not there a faithful recording
[32:50] right of God's prophet and we thank God
[32:52] for that
[32:53] and they're pointing to the absolute
[32:55] praise God but all the tapes and every
[32:57] word are not the absolute because the
[32:59] absolute is a divine eternal person
[33:02] praise God all right so I want to make
[33:05] sure I bring that out because that's
[33:07] another quote that's often
[33:10] misinterpreted okay and also to go along
[33:22] with this jeffersonville misquoted that
[33:26] quote that said this is inspired that's
[33:29] not inspired well brother Brandon
[33:30] plainly says there's times where God is
[33:33] speaking on the tapes and there's times
[33:35] where he's just speaking in his own
[33:37] human side his own human opinion okay
[33:41] and I we went through this one with 1977
[33:43] of my brother Graham said this is not
[33:44] the Lord this is me talking making a
[33:48] prediction about 1977 total annihilation
[33:51] by 1977 brother Ram plainly says this is
[33:54] not the Lord this is me here's another
[33:57] one in the very quote where brother
[34:00] Graham says I I become God's voice to
[34:03] you
[34:05] he said if I offended you by saying that
[34:08] forgive me but I felt that might been
[34:12] resented but I am God's voice to you see
[34:14] I say that again that time was under
[34:17] inspiration see I felt bad about the
[34:20] first time but it repeated it so both
[34:24] man makes it plain the first time he
[34:26] says I'm God's voice to you
[34:27] he said it wasn't under inspiration he
[34:30] felt bad about it he said but the second
[34:32] time he said it it was right it was
[34:34] under inspiration so see Church we have
[34:37] to take that approach we have to take
[34:39] that approach to our dreams some of them
[34:41] are under inspiration some of them are
[34:42] not praise God we must take that
[34:46] approach as we listen to brother Branham
[34:47] as we listen to preachers right as the
[34:50] pastor and the Evangelist and the
[34:52] fivefold ministry we have to be careful
[34:55] what's under inspiration and what's not
[34:57] we have to be very careful now with the
[35:00] Prophet it's it's very simple most the
[35:03] time he'll actually say thus saith the
[35:05] Lord or in the name of the Lord and then
[35:08] the other times if he doesn't say that
[35:10] we have to take it back look in the
[35:12] Bible if it's in the Bible
[35:14] then we're gonna believe it's thus saith
[35:16] the Lord because it's got it has Bible
[35:19] has a Bible foundation as a Bible ty
[35:22] Post has a Bible absolute praise God
[35:25] amen praise the Lord all right now let
[35:34] me just go through quickly this sermon I
[35:37] listen to I'm just going to give you
[35:38] some highlights from the message I
[35:40] listen to today this is from December
[35:43] 1963 so I wanted to let I had a choice
[35:46] there's four sermons brother BAM
[35:47] preaches called the absolute and I
[35:49] looked at it I thought wow didn't listen
[35:51] the one that was after the seals because
[35:53] I wanted to see what he said so let me
[35:55] just give you a brief overview of it
[35:57] program starts by with by looking at
[36:00] Paul's life and brother Graham said
[36:02] Paul's experience he was astonished Jew
[36:06] Hebrew Hebrew Pharisee of Pharisees he
[36:10] was zealous for the law he said but
[36:13] Paul's experience of meeting Christ on
[36:16] the Damascus Road gave him an absolute
[36:19] he said something he can look back the
[36:21] rest of his life and give him an
[36:24] absolute okay so now we get the idea
[36:27] that we have to look at all these quotes
[36:28] and sometimes we have to use
[36:31] understanding so that experience was an
[36:34] absolute for Paul so in other words Paul
[36:40] met the
[36:41] absolute and that experience praise God
[36:43] and that's what every Christian should
[36:47] have any Christian that's born again
[36:51] when they meet Jesus Christ in the
[36:54] baptism of the Holy Spirit that
[36:56] experience becomes absolute because they
[36:58] met the person of the absolute praise
[37:00] God hallelujah but you know that the
[37:05] hard part is we all seen people that say
[37:07] they met the absolute and then they fall
[37:09] away from the from the Word of God
[37:11] well that proves they never met the
[37:12] absolute Amen hallelujah your life and
[37:16] then program goes on to say that because
[37:19] Paul met the absolute he had a
[37:21] christ-centered life and brother man
[37:24] said his Christ and her life was his
[37:26] absolute amen praise God
[37:28] in other words being born again having
[37:30] the eternal one inside of him guiding
[37:33] and directing his life that was the
[37:35] absolute to him praise God so brother
[37:38] Graham spends a lot of time on Paul in
[37:40] this sermon and then he starts giving
[37:43] examples of absolutes in life like a
[37:46] anchor on a ship when in the storms the
[37:49] shipments down the anchor the RAM said
[37:50] the anchor is the absolute and then he
[37:55] has this beautiful quote he said and a
[37:58] born-again Christian is tied to Christ
[38:00] and the Bible is the anchor so you and I
[38:04] are the ship right we're God like we had
[38:06] an awful storm last night we're getting
[38:08] tossed in the storm right but our anchor
[38:12] rod Ram says are the Bible is the anchor
[38:15] it's the thing we're tied to amen
[38:18] praise God we're tied to Christ and the
[38:20] Bible is our anchor so brother Graham
[38:22] says that rock on the bottom of the the
[38:24] sea is Christ
[38:26] the Bible's our anchor and we're the
[38:29] ship praise God amen hallelujah praise
[38:32] God
[38:33] thank the Lord then he says Christ is
[38:36] your North Star and the Holy Spirit is
[38:39] your compass so see there's multiple
[38:44] symbolisms or images that brother
[38:46] Branham uses here he said the Holy
[38:49] Spirit will always point you to the word
[38:50] he said which is Christ
[38:53] he said the Holy Spirit only points to
[38:56] the word praise God and then brother
[39:01] Branham said a woman named Emily Post
[39:03] was the absolute for table manners he
[39:06] said if she said you got to eat your
[39:08] beans with a butter knife then you
[39:10] better do that because she was the
[39:11] absolute that's a different definition
[39:13] of absolute just means a final say right
[39:16] that's the one brother Branham uses of
[39:19] course Emily Post is not unlimited in
[39:21] power right we know that so brother
[39:24] Branham starts using the word absolute
[39:25] in a little different way than his
[39:27] definition it just kind of means like
[39:29] the final say or the one who has the
[39:31] authority he says Adolf Hitler was the
[39:35] absolute for Germany Egypt's absolute
[39:38] was Pharaoh he said but they all fail
[39:41] and come to dust because they're
[39:42] man-made absolutes and he says the
[39:47] Supreme Court is this nation's absolute
[39:50] he said the king or queen maybe another
[39:53] nations absolute he said the umpire is
[39:56] absolute at a baseball game number of
[39:59] the RAM starts feeling good he starts
[40:00] going through the example he said I feel
[40:01] real good right now he said there's got
[40:04] to be something that's final I'm so glad
[40:07] that oh now there's somebody who can say
[40:10] it's a sin or it's not a sin
[40:12] I'm so glad of that I'm glad for an
[40:15] absolute so nomogram start showing how
[40:17] the Bible and Jesus Christ is the
[40:20] absolute because there are limited in
[40:22] power and they tell you what sin is and
[40:25] what sin is not and brother man tells us
[40:28] it's a sin to make him infallible he
[40:30] calls it tommyrot
[40:31] awful things it's a sin to make brother
[40:34] branham the absolute now we'll get to
[40:38] the one quote there's one quote where
[40:40] brother Branham says you brethren kind
[40:42] of look to me as your absolute kind of
[40:47] but in all these quotes of brother
[40:49] Branham in scriptures you'll never say
[40:51] where the Bible says God is kind of our
[40:54] absolute you'll never find any quote
[40:56] where Jesus is kind of or a little bit
[40:59] of our absolute you never find quotes
[41:01] like that so gotta be we have to be very
[41:03] careful what we do at that one
[41:05] particular quote
[41:07] and we'll go to that in just a few
[41:08] moments here so buh-bam says when God
[41:12] says anything that's the way it is no
[41:14] need of arguing about it that's what it
[41:16] is and that's the Christians absolute
[41:18] absolute if he's a Christian God said do
[41:22] it this way that's the way it's got to
[41:23] be done no arguing he said well say it
[41:26] ain't nothing about it God said so that
[41:28] settles it that's the absolute of the
[41:30] real believer yeah so see the the the
[41:34] Jeffersonville movement is saying
[41:36] preacher stop preaching right play the
[41:38] tapes they got to catch the vision they
[41:40] got to play the tape so they say so see
[41:43] but the absolute is the Word of God
[41:45] Jesus said go you know all the world
[41:47] teach all nations preached to all
[41:48] nations baptizing them in the name of
[41:50] the Lord Jesus Christ that's the
[41:52] revelation of the Bible right so they
[41:55] they can never change that no movement
[41:57] they can try to but they'll never change
[41:59] God's Word on that so see that settles
[42:04] it for the real believer the real
[42:06] believer will never try to change God's
[42:08] Word they'll just accept God's Word now
[42:12] here's a beautiful quote well around
[42:13] then goes into traffic signal how's that
[42:15] a traffic signal is the absolute he said
[42:19] then we get a traffic jam of everybody
[42:21] he said everybody wants to be their own
[42:24] absolutely he says o worthy absolute I
[42:27] love this quote brother Branham says it
[42:28] very plainly God is the absolute for
[42:31] more beautiful words God is the absolute
[42:34] praise God
[42:35] so when brother have said the person of
[42:37] Jesus Christ is the absolute the Bible
[42:39] is the absolute we know what it means
[42:41] God is the ultimate God is the unlimited
[42:44] of power but he reveals himself he's the
[42:47] invisible he reveals himself through a
[42:50] visible son Jesus Christ who then gives
[42:52] us a witness of his character in the
[42:55] Bible praise God and that Bible was
[42:57] written by the unlimited one praise the
[43:01] Lord and so see we can all see that and
[43:04] agree on that if we have eyes to see and
[43:07] ears to hear tonight he said let let
[43:12] every absolute other than mine be a lie
[43:15] mine is truth oh my so see when they say
[43:19] the tapes are the absolute that's a
[43:20] I gods absolute is his word that's truth
[43:23] praise God he said so there is a
[43:28] absolute to Christianity he said that's
[43:30] the end of all arguments the Bible said
[43:33] so there must be an absolute in
[43:35] everything hallelujah
[43:44] all right I thought that was beautiful
[43:49] then brother M goes in his personal
[43:52] testimonies at the end of this he said
[43:54] when he first got saved the seventh-day
[43:55] preacher tried to bring him into his
[43:57] church and the Baptist he said I'm so
[44:00] glad God showed him it wasn't the church
[44:03] that was the absolute it was the word
[44:07] then brother Ram said I found out I took
[44:09] God's absolute God's Word and then he
[44:12] read in the Bible that Jesus is the word
[44:14] praise God but man said upon this
[44:17] absolutely I'll build my church so in
[44:21] other words upon this rock so what is
[44:22] the absolute the rock the revelation of
[44:25] who Jesus Christ is hallelujah so that's
[44:29] again II that's again getting into how
[44:31] the baptism of the Holy Ghost is our
[44:34] absolute in our soul right but it's God
[44:37] it's God's eternal sphere unlimited
[44:39] sphere unlimited power in our soul upon
[44:42] this absolute I'll build my church upon
[44:45] the baptism of the Holy Ghost I'll build
[44:47] my church praise God number of the
[44:49] rammstein revelation 22 8 9 says I'm
[44:52] sorry 18 and 19 says you cannot add or
[44:54] take one word away he said that's the
[44:56] absolute and then you'll you'll see in a
[44:58] few moments here brother brand will
[45:00] bring out different scriptures like
[45:01] Hebrews 13:8 he says is the absolute
[45:03] revelation 22:18 and 19 is the absolute
[45:06] the man brings out all these different
[45:08] scriptures that are the absolutes and so
[45:14] see that the the Jeffersonville movement
[45:16] is taking away the Bible so you can't
[45:18] take one word away from the absolute and
[45:20] they're taking preachers out that's
[45:22] taking words away that's taken away from
[45:24] the absolute the brother Branham said
[45:27] he's always been the oddball he saw
[45:29] visions he preached serpent seed
[45:31] predestination but God had a purpose
[45:34] he said for saving him and that was to
[45:36] do his ministry and to know that the
[45:39] word is the absolute and he knows
[45:41] nothing other than Jesus Christ and him
[45:43] crucified
[45:44] hey amen that's the season we're getting
[45:46] into the season where the absolute was
[45:48] crucified for us died for us that we
[45:51] could trust only in the absolute praise
[45:53] God hallelujah and then he closes by
[45:57] saying I'm not gonna make an altar call
[45:59] he said let's make a call of recon
[46:01] secretion and rededication he said let's
[46:04] take Jesus as our absolute praise God
[46:08] now I want to take just about 10 more
[46:11] minutes it's already 8 o'clock so I got
[46:12] about 20 or 25 more minutes I want to
[46:16] take a few minutes here and I want to
[46:22] read direct quotes from brother Adams
[46:28] for sermon I'm sorry I want to take
[46:29] direct quotes from every time brother
[46:31] Ram said my absolute there was 29 I'm
[46:34] sorry there was 32 times I believe yeah
[46:37] brother Ram said those exact words my
[46:39] absolute there was 2029 he said your
[46:42] absolute and I just want to go through
[46:44] some of these I just want to hammer this
[46:46] down Church there's no doubt in our
[46:48] hearts and minds we're thankful for the
[46:50] tapes the tapes point to the absolute
[46:52] just like tonight I'm making a tape
[46:54] right I'm making a recording but my
[46:56] recording is not the absolute it's
[46:58] pointing you and I to the absolute Amen
[47:00] it's pointing you to Jesus Christ praise
[47:04] God and just like just like we
[47:14] understand the same thing is true of
[47:16] Paul right if any man could have said
[47:20] you know by deception he was the
[47:22] absolute it would have been Paul because
[47:24] Paul said if you add one word or take
[47:27] one word away from what I wrote your he
[47:29] said you're cursed right
[47:31] but Paul also put though we or an angel
[47:35] so Paul put himself in there showing how
[47:38] Paul was not the absolute it was the
[47:40] revelation that was the absolute praise
[47:42] God amen and I have scriptures where
[47:46] Paul says he
[47:47] is not perfect in other words he's not
[47:49] the absolute he's not the the unlimited
[47:53] and power person yet he wrote he wrote
[47:57] about the absolute praise God but not
[47:59] every word Paul said was the absolute
[48:01] same thing with brother Branham
[48:03] Philippians 3:12 let's read that video
[48:06] to get that yeah Linnea will read
[48:20] Philippians 3:12 and when you read us
[48:23] listen please Paul says he's not perfect
[48:26] but he's following one who is perfect
[48:28] amen Paul's out the absolute but he's
[48:30] following the absolute same thing with
[48:33] brother branham he's not the absolute
[48:34] but he's following it and then as he
[48:37] said then we follow his teachings as
[48:39] they line up with the word but we test
[48:41] every one to make sure it's in the Word
[48:44] of God
[48:44] okay Philippians 3:12 a men Paul said
[48:59] don't add one thing or take one thing
[49:01] away your curse but here you said listen
[49:03] I'm not perfect I'm not the absolute but
[49:05] I'm pointing you to one who is the Lord
[49:08] Jesus Christ praise God okay you know
[49:19] what since we're on that thought let's
[49:22] go back I 1st Corinthians 11 please one
[49:25] let's just read that quote and then
[49:27] we'll get to these other ones here
[49:29] there's one quote where you know the
[49:32] false churches might be able to say or
[49:34] false doctrines and churches might be
[49:37] able to say brother Branham said he was
[49:38] the absolute but let's read it and get a
[49:40] good understanding this is from church
[49:42] order 63 it was a meeting with just
[49:45] brother Branham and brothers and leaders
[49:48] in the church at the brand tabernacle
[49:50] and he was saying how he's the head of
[49:52] that church he said because somebody's
[49:54] got to be the head around here and he's
[49:56] laying out the groundwork
[49:59] or the rules for the gifts of the Holy
[50:01] Spirit especially speaking in tongues
[50:03] and prophesying in Brandon Tabernacle
[50:06] okay
[50:08] so boom Ram says he said but if you get
[50:11] to man you got two opinions it's got to
[50:13] come to one final absolute and my
[50:16] absolute is the word the Bible so notice
[50:18] this quote by the Rams laying down rules
[50:21] he said we got to have an absolute can I
[50:22] have two men one man he said but my
[50:25] absolute is the word the Bible and as a
[50:29] pastor here of the church my absolute is
[50:32] the word he says and I want I know you
[50:36] are brothers you kind of look to me to
[50:39] be your absolute Sabri I'm just says my
[50:42] absolute is the word but you brothers
[50:44] are looking to me kind of he said to be
[50:48] your absolute and then brother man
[50:50] quotes this beautiful scripture it's 1st
[50:53] Corinthians 11:1 now can you read that
[50:55] for us ok so brother bible quotes that
[51:02] scripture he said he said as long so
[51:05] listen listen he said I'm your absolute
[51:06] as long as I follow God as Paul said in
[51:09] the scripture follow me as I follow
[51:12] Christ amen so in other words when God
[51:16] sends as a prophet we follow his
[51:18] teachings but we line all them up by the
[51:20] Bible
[51:21] if not then who is the white horse
[51:23] writer is it the Antichrist or was it
[51:27] the whole spirit his brother Graham said
[51:29] both I thought I came across another one
[51:31] where brother man just made a slip-up he
[51:33] says I spoke thus saith the Lord that
[51:35] America has last chance in 1946 but in
[51:39] other places he said that she had a last
[51:41] chance in 1956 and so there's a little
[51:44] slip-up there he just quoted the wrong
[51:46] one which one was it was it 46 or 56 and
[51:51] so see we just allow a man to make those
[51:53] mistakes and we take everything back to
[51:56] the Word of God now Paul knew the
[52:00] brothers would follow him but Paul still
[52:02] said he was a wretched man in Romans
[52:05] 7:24 he said I do that which is evil
[52:08] sometimes Romans 7 19 and if you
[52:11] Evo you can't be unlimited in power
[52:14] because your sin separates you from the
[52:16] a holy one the unlimited one praise God
[52:19] and Paul even says not every word I said
[52:22] was thus saith the Lord
[52:23] 1st Corinthians 7:10 says that we won't
[52:27] read that just for times sake I want you
[52:30] to also know church were to follow
[52:33] brother rams teachings and line them all
[52:34] up with the Word of God but the Bible
[52:37] also says follow Holy Ghost filled
[52:39] churches first Thessalonians 2 13 and 14
[52:43] I'll read 14 for ye brethren became
[52:46] followers of the Churches of God which
[52:49] are in Judea are in Christ Jesus
[52:53] see that's why we can look to wonderful
[52:56] churches like Sheffield Albion brother
[52:58] cams brother Brooks's I hate to leave
[53:01] anyone out you know we can look to
[53:03] churches that we know have people that
[53:05] are born-again pastors that are
[53:06] born-again and we can follow examples
[53:09] that are godly in their churches so we
[53:13] follow the absolute Jesus Christ and the
[53:15] Prophet and other churches we follow we
[53:17] looked we looked at them and as long as
[53:19] they're doing things that follow the
[53:21] absolute Jesus Christ then we can we can
[53:24] also do those things Peter said that we
[53:30] are to follow Jesus Christ as well in
[53:33] 1st Peter 2:21 he said Christ also
[53:37] suffered for us leaving us an example
[53:40] that we should follow his steps
[53:43] praise God here's one thing we can't do
[53:47] this is what I believe the
[53:48] jeffersonville movement is done 2nd
[53:50] Peter 1:16 he says for we have not
[53:52] followed cunningly devised fables that's
[53:59] what I believe that's a fable when they
[54:00] say the tapes are the absolute that's a
[54:03] fable the tapes mention the absolute the
[54:05] tapes point to the absolute but not
[54:07] every word on there is the absolute
[54:09] that's a fable which a Greek word is an
[54:12] invention that's a man-made invention
[54:14] because brother brand never said my
[54:15] tapes are the absolute
[54:23] and I hope that helps everybody by God's
[54:25] grace so that is the one quote people
[54:29] may stumble out a little bit
[54:33] now I'm gonna gotta go real quick here
[54:35] so everybody take a deep breath here I
[54:37] want to go quickly through these four
[54:40] sermons brother Branham preached called
[54:43] the absolute and I just want to go like
[54:48] machine-gun fire brother Craig used to
[54:50] always say that so I always had that
[54:51] stuck about mine he said I go scripture
[54:53] after Scripture but this time it's gonna
[54:55] be cool after quote after quote but
[54:57] they're all saying the same thing Jesus
[54:59] Christ is the absolute the word is the
[55:01] absolute thus saith the Lord is the
[55:03] absolute the revelation is the absolute
[55:05] so I want you to see all these these are
[55:07] all on December 30th 1962 brother
[55:12] Branham said my absolute he is so
[55:14] wonderful notice he didn't say my tapes
[55:18] are so wonderful or they are so
[55:20] wonderful he said he is so wonderful
[55:23] program said of for palmas rock I'll put
[55:27] my absolute he said spiritual revelation
[55:30] of who he is of knowing so again the
[55:33] spiritual revelation is your absolute
[55:35] right you've got a revelation it's the
[55:37] Word of God
[55:37] it's the said Lord that word is
[55:39] unlimited it's powerful all powerful
[55:41] praise God he said God will love me
[55:45] that's my absolute so here brother BAM
[55:47] said God's love is his absolute praise
[55:50] God he said can't rest on an arm of
[55:54] flesh you got to rest on the word what
[55:57] God said dude I hope God's love is your
[55:59] absolute tonight I know it isn't our
[56:01] church praise God it's preached that way
[56:02] we got to receive an Amen every one of
[56:05] us but I mean I've said if I'd die in my
[56:07] tracks my absolute is Jesus Christ amen
[56:11] I love that one brother Graham said when
[56:13] he got saved and he was in the woods and
[56:15] he nailed that paper on the tree he said
[56:18] what was it he said I met he said that's
[56:20] where I met God he said what was it I
[56:23] heard my soul and a haven arrest that
[56:25] settled it there that was my absolute
[56:28] there I found something not some
[56:30] mythical some idea I had talked with the
[56:33] man I had talked with that man that told
[56:36] me never to
[56:37] drink smoke or do anything else that
[56:38] would defile myself he said yes sir he
[56:42] was the one so see the Holy Spirit he
[56:45] met in the woods was the absolute praise
[56:47] God God's Spirit is the absolute hey man
[56:50] we can we can meet it right now praise
[56:52] God amen you can meet him in your in
[56:55] your prayer closet you can meet him in
[56:56] the church you can meet him right now in
[56:58] your living room
[56:59] praise God he's the absolute Amen the
[57:02] unlimited one he goes on to say Christ
[57:04] is my absolute he is my absolute he said
[57:08] God he is my absolute he's always the
[57:11] absolute a man so he's the oh there's no
[57:14] other absolute there's one absolute he's
[57:16] always the absence I'll never see where
[57:20] he says my tapes and my opinions and my
[57:22] human side is the absolute he'll never
[57:24] say that now move to the second sermon
[57:27] January 27th 1963 he said the Word of
[57:32] God Christ my absolute and of course I'm
[57:36] just shortening these I spent hours
[57:39] today just going through all the my
[57:40] absolute quotes now I know that that was
[57:46] an absolute that that word could not
[57:48] change it's been my absolute here
[57:52] brother Branham says revelation 22 that
[57:55] he said I knew that could not change
[57:58] it's been my absolute so now he's
[58:01] quoting individual scriptures he said a
[58:06] long ago I taken Christ for my absolute
[58:10] the absolute has to be eternal unlimited
[58:13] and power boat man said I'm tied to that
[58:17] word let every man's word be alive but
[58:19] mine be truth that was my absolute from
[58:23] 30 years ago or better I'm still in that
[58:25] same word and there I want to live and
[58:27] die that being my absolute that's where
[58:29] I want to live and die to church amen
[58:31] but God's Word is my absolute praise God
[58:34] he said Christ he's our absolute there
[58:37] can be no other praise God I read that
[58:39] one earlier praise God he says
[58:44] but I'm determined in my heart I'll
[58:45] never back on that word I'll stay right
[58:47] there that's my absolute brother branham
[58:50] here's a beautiful brother ram quotes
[58:51] the rapture scripture 1st Thessalonians
[58:54] 4 they which are dead in Christ shall
[58:56] rise first and we which are alive will
[58:58] meet them together in the clouds the RAM
[59:01] said what a promise what a absolute that
[59:03] is to believe in Christ to have my heart
[59:06] say amen to every word his book that I
[59:09] know the Holy Spirit compass it guides
[59:11] me to us absolute his North Star
[59:14] he is my absolute praise God now brother
[59:20] brother mantle quotes Matthew 24 where
[59:22] Jesus said heaven earth will pass away
[59:23] my words and ever passed away he says
[59:26] put your heart right on God's Word
[59:28] heaven earth will pass away but that
[59:30] shall never pass away that's the
[59:32] absolute again the world the scripture
[59:34] read in Psalms a night at the beginning
[59:35] I'll never break the Covenant I'll never
[59:38] alter the words that come out of my
[59:39] mouth the Word of God is the absolute
[59:42] little absent Jesus Christ he said it
[59:45] isn't the Baptist churches say me it was
[59:47] Jesus Christ say me
[59:48] he's my ultimate he's a my stand he's my
[59:51] absolute he's my typos amen praise God
[59:55] here he says Hebrews 13:8 don't you see
[59:59] the same God is right among us proving
[1:00:01] himself that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:00:03] yesterday today and forever that's my
[1:00:05] absolute hallelujah well Graham said my
[1:00:09] absolutely is the Word of God that word
[1:00:15] now here's a beautiful one brother Ram
[1:00:18] said that's my absolute brother in this
[1:00:20] word thus saith the Lord praise God so
[1:00:23] now anytime there's a thus saith the
[1:00:25] Lord that's an absolute it's a promise
[1:00:27] it's an eternal word and that word is
[1:00:30] unlimited and power because it's part of
[1:00:32] God amen
[1:00:33] now moving on to the third sermon this
[1:00:36] is from December 63 I'm sorry this is
[1:00:43] from a
[1:00:44] this is just once more Lord yeah yeah so
[1:00:48] this is the morning sir I'm sorry no
[1:00:49] this is the evening service from
[1:00:50] December 1st 63 Rams quoting John
[1:00:57] chapter 4 he said he that can receive my
[1:01:00] words and believe on him that sent me
[1:01:01] hath eternal life and shall not come to
[1:01:03] the judgment but it's passed from death
[1:01:04] unto life that's good enough for me
[1:01:06] right there that's my absolute that's my
[1:01:10] absolute he promised it so every promise
[1:01:13] of God is part of his absolute now in
[1:01:19] the sermon here mm-hmm
[1:01:26] here's another one yeah there's a
[1:01:29] different services to the fourth sermon
[1:01:37] I'm gonna go quickly here he said my
[1:01:40] words or God's words or promises he said
[1:01:43] that's my absolute he said Jesus Christ
[1:01:45] by his word he is my absolute but
[1:01:49] brother hams talking and said he's at ya
[1:01:51] he's quoting Psalms 23 yea though I walk
[1:01:53] through the shadow Valley the shadow of
[1:01:55] death I'll fear no evil
[1:01:57] you are my absolute amen he's my
[1:02:00] absolute he said the holy spirit stirs
[1:02:03] me to that promise
[1:02:05] he's my absolute he's my aw anything
[1:02:08] outside of that nothing to my arms I
[1:02:10] bring I know nothing else besides Christ
[1:02:13] he said he said that's my absolute
[1:02:16] praise God
[1:02:17] but man says the Word of Living God the
[1:02:19] Holy Spirit he says your absolute is in
[1:02:22] him so now he says your absolute is in
[1:02:25] God it's the life of God praise the Lord
[1:02:28] oh here's a new one I haven't mentioned
[1:02:31] this one program says the pillar of fire
[1:02:33] is the absolute he said when I seen that
[1:02:37] pillar of fire like Paul the road to
[1:02:38] Damascus I know that was God's absolute
[1:02:41] Amen so god every manifestation of God
[1:02:45] genuine manifestation is the absolute
[1:02:47] praise God it's the absolute though it
[1:02:50] was a paradox he said sure it was for
[1:02:53] the pillar of fire to hang up there in
[1:02:54] the sky and papers and everything taken
[1:02:57] the
[1:02:57] picture of it amen he says the brother
[1:03:02] Rams doing the prayer line he says I'm
[1:03:04] checking my absolute Lord if there's
[1:03:06] anything in me besides the i-word take
[1:03:08] it out
[1:03:09] Haman he said Jesus Christ let's take
[1:03:12] Jesus Christ our absolute he is my
[1:03:14] absolute on December 30th 1960 he said
[1:03:20] Christ the Holy Spirit his word is my
[1:03:22] absolute he is my absolute Christ Christ
[1:03:25] is the absolute over and over and over
[1:03:29] again Christ is my absolute here and
[1:03:32] then in 1964 possessing the gates of his
[1:03:35] enemies that says last time he says my
[1:03:37] absolute he said we need an absolute
[1:03:39] Christ he said the word is the app my
[1:03:42] absolute God's Word is my absolute
[1:03:46] praise God okay now that was wonderful I
[1:03:58] hope you enjoyed that I think we just
[1:03:59] spent 10 minutes on that by God's grace
[1:04:01] not not too long all right now let me do
[1:04:07] one more here Christ the mystery of God
[1:04:09] revealed the other grams getting ready
[1:04:13] to pray now remember this was a very
[1:04:14] long sermon if you remember I think it
[1:04:15] was three and a half hours I preached it
[1:04:17] a couple years ago before brother Graham
[1:04:19] prays that he said I got a quite a bunch
[1:04:21] of scriptures here rather he says
[1:04:23] questions we said scriptures and then he
[1:04:26] prays he says God were holding to your
[1:04:28] unchanging hand their absolute the word
[1:04:31] okay and then he says help us lord as we
[1:04:37] read the word he says and may as you
[1:04:42] gave us the vision some two years ago
[1:04:44] store up the food fine healthy-looking
[1:04:47] vegetables that I saw in the vision
[1:04:51] being stored here in this tabernacle may
[1:04:54] we receive a whole barrel full of that
[1:04:56] granite Lord or a tape load that it
[1:05:02] might reveal Jesus Christ to us in the
[1:05:04] hour that we live to give us a steini
[1:05:08] strength the spiritual
[1:05:11] strength for the task that lays ahead
[1:05:13] granite father so I want to bring a
[1:05:16] balance here at this last quote brother
[1:05:19] branham said the tapes have a tape below
[1:05:22] or their the tapes have a load of
[1:05:24] promises right a load of scriptures so
[1:05:29] the tapes have part of the absolute they
[1:05:32] have promises of the absolute but
[1:05:35] remember he said that the tapes might
[1:05:37] reveal now anyone that knows the Bible
[1:05:39] knows only God can reveal the Word of
[1:05:42] God Jesus says only the father can
[1:05:45] reveal so see tapes just like it's just
[1:05:48] like a natural letter just like a Bible
[1:05:50] it's just like a plain Bible right but a
[1:05:53] tape the Bible has no mistakes but a
[1:05:56] tape can have mistakes so a tape is just
[1:05:59] something that holds part of the
[1:06:02] absolute but the Holy spirt had come and
[1:06:04] make that live praise God just like a
[1:06:09] table could only hold so many vegetables
[1:06:12] is like a tape can only hold so many
[1:06:14] promises of God but it can't hold all of
[1:06:17] them right but the Holy Spirit the one
[1:06:20] that is that he is the absolute he comes
[1:06:22] and quickens those promises that are
[1:06:24] mentioned on the tapes praise God
[1:06:26] hallelujah because jesus said no man can
[1:06:32] reveal this but the father
[1:06:34] no man can reveal what's on the tape
[1:06:36] except the father so the father is the
[1:06:40] absolute praise God the Holy Spirit is
[1:06:42] the absolute God Jesus the word is our
[1:06:44] absolute the revelation the pillar fire
[1:06:47] is the absolute praise God all right
[1:07:03] okay I hope that was a blessing by God's
[1:07:05] grace well we have the musician come
[1:07:07] here to the piano
[1:07:08] thank you man okay Church if you have
[1:07:14] any questions about any of those quotes
[1:07:15] or if you like any I don't oftentimes
[1:07:18] brother Jose likes quotes if you need
[1:07:20] any of those quotes let me know remember
[1:07:23] let's go back to some of those
[1:07:23] statements every word was the say the
[1:07:26] Lord
[1:07:27] it must be all or nothing and that's not
[1:07:34] true
[1:07:34] those things are just not true Church
[1:07:39] the messages from Jeffersonville are
[1:07:42] coming by the spirit of fear brother
[1:07:45] Branham said have you ever noticed how
[1:07:47] the people who lead others astray bind
[1:07:50] them closely to themselves by fear and I
[1:07:53] just showed you that example they sent
[1:07:55] out that email this week if you don't
[1:07:57] believe every word on the tape is the
[1:07:59] absolute or thus saith the Lord you're
[1:08:01] not Abraham's true seed they will say if
[1:08:06] the people don't do what they say they
[1:08:07] are if they leave then destruction will
[1:08:09] follow but they're saying today you'll
[1:08:11] get the coronavirus or you're gonna be
[1:08:13] lost with the world if you don't do like
[1:08:17] we do he said there are false prophets
[1:08:21] for a true prophet will always lead one
[1:08:23] to the word and bind the people to Jesus
[1:08:27] Christ see they're binding people to
[1:08:29] tapes or books we have to bind people to
[1:08:33] a Living God to the absolute one who is
[1:08:36] unlimited in power one who's infinite
[1:08:38] praise God and he won't a true leader
[1:08:42] won't tell the people to fear Him or
[1:08:44] what he says but to fear what the word
[1:08:46] says Amen praise God thank you Jesus
[1:08:50] hallelujah might remember there's only
[1:08:53] one absolute there's no other absolute
[1:08:56] and there's always Christ is always the
[1:08:59] absolute amen
[1:09:00] thank you lord hallelujah
[1:09:08] okay I think I'll stop right there I
[1:09:10] just want to make sure I got all those
