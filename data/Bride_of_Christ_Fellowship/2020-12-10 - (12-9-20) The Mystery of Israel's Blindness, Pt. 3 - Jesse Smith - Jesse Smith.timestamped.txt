[23:13] for god's grace
[23:14] uh numerous prayer requests tonight
[23:16] though let's remember um
[23:18] beatrice is working tonight i think it
[23:19] has something to do with her becoming a
[23:21] citizen
[23:22] so i think you have to work a little bit
[23:24] to become a citizen so
[23:26] she's working tonight let's pray for her
[23:27] as she works i
[23:29] don't know any detail that's all i know
[23:31] also there's a brother
[23:33] uh named emilio he's translating my
[23:35] youtube videos into spanish
[23:37] anyways his granddaughter keeps getting
[23:39] sick she has lots of sickness
[23:41] so yes for prayer for her also he's
[23:44] seeking the baptism of the holy ghost he
[23:45] said
[23:46] my videos have been a great help so
[23:48] let's pray for him to be born again he
[23:50] really wants to be born again so let's
[23:51] pray
[23:52] that heaven will come down on him also i
[23:54] talked to your brother uh from canada
[23:56] last night
[23:57] um he said just me calling i called him
[23:59] back after a couple weeks just out of
[24:01] the blue and he said it was
[24:02] totally god he was so depressed and
[24:04] discouraged and he said
[24:06] the words all the words that i said just
[24:07] raised him out of his discouragement
[24:09] and he said the timing was perfect he
[24:11] said he just got off the phone with his
[24:12] son jesse and then i called
[24:14] immediately a jesse after getting off
[24:17] the phone with his son jesse so
[24:19] it was lined up perfectly he was
[24:21] discouraged and god really
[24:22] blessed him and he's receiving the
[24:24] message he received serpent seed today
[24:25] so
[24:26] that's encouraging also um
[24:30] there's a spoke or a family unspoken
[24:32] we're not going to name but
[24:33] a family in the message and the the
[24:35] married
[24:36] mother lost a baby today there's a
[24:38] miscarriage today so we don't want to
[24:39] share too much but
[24:41] they just reached out to me for prayer
[24:43] so let's pray for that also
[24:45] the election uh it is now at the supreme
[24:48] court level
[24:48] as you might have known and though uh
[24:50] the states
[24:52] the states with the the fraud have to
[24:54] reply by tomorrow at 3 p.m and then the
[24:56] supreme court makes a decision let's
[24:58] just pray for justice
[25:00] we know we're going to lose rights at
[25:01] some point but i don't want to be now
[25:04] and all i can do is make my request
[25:06] known unto god
[25:07] and god will orchestrate everything but
[25:09] remember he don't i don't know if i'll
[25:11] show you the scripture but he was
[25:12] looking
[25:12] in israel he's looking for a man to
[25:14] stand up and pray and intercede
[25:16] he couldn't find any and that's when he
[25:18] took israel out of the promised land so
[25:20] we want to be
[25:21] those who stand up and will speak
[25:24] and pray to god for intercession that
[25:26] justice will be done that we can keep a

[32:54] commissioned by god to defend this
[32:55] message so we're thankful
[32:58] for the wonderful opportunity we have to
[33:00] do that
[33:01] i just had a pastor email me last week
[33:03] and said god is uh
[33:05] using me to write this book he says uh
[33:07] because of the lockdown he said if
[33:09] we can't go preach he said they can send
[33:11] this book i thought well
[33:12] i never thought about that we'll see how
[33:14] long the lockdown lasts but
[33:16] i just thought well what what an
[33:17] interesting thought i never
[33:19] thought about that so we'll just see
[33:21] what the lord does revelation 6
[33:23] 9 through 11.
[33:29] just looking at the fifth seal again how
[33:31] uh
[33:33] jews that have been blinded to christ
[33:35] can still be
[33:36] saved they can go their whole lives not
[33:38] confess
[33:39] jesus's name not be baptized in the name
[33:41] of lord jesus christ
[33:43] yet the lord still hears them and the
[33:45] lord will still
[33:46] avenge their cries revelation
[33:50] 6 9 i'll just read here and when he had
[33:52] opened the fifth seal i saw under the
[33:54] altar the souls of them that were slain
[33:56] for the word of god and for the
[33:58] testimony which they held
[34:00] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[34:02] how long o lord holy and true dost thou
[34:04] not judge and avenge our blood
[34:06] on them that dwell on the earth and
[34:09] white robes were given unto every one of
[34:11] them
[34:12] and it was said unto them that they
[34:14] should rest yet for a little season
[34:16] until their fellow servants also and
[34:17] their brethren that should be killed as
[34:19] they were
[34:20] should be fulfilled i just want to have
[34:22] one more word of prayer here
[34:24] heavenly father lord we've preached i'm
[34:26] sorry we've sang your songs lord god
[34:28] and we've worshipped you we've prayed
[34:29] we've tried to intercede
[34:31] now it's time lord to preach your word
[34:33] so father may you preach through me lord
[34:35] god may i yield to you
[34:36] and may faith come by hearing tonight
[34:39] lord god
[34:40] and we just pray you'll grant it lord
[34:42] god we know one day that faith will
[34:44] come for the revelation of the rapture
[34:46] the lord for this revelation
[34:48] may be clear to your people clear to all
[34:50] saints lord god
[34:52] that you blinded your people that you
[34:53] might get a gentile bride
[34:55] but lord you will take the blinders off
[34:57] one day what a glorious moment that will
[34:59] be
[35:00] on mount zion and father we just thank
[35:02] you lord that we can have open eyes now
[35:04] and receive it
[35:05] today in jesus christ's name we pray
[35:08] amen
[35:09] amen you may be seated by god's grace
[35:15] thank you just looking if there's any
[35:18] other requests i didn't forget okay
[35:21] all right so let's look here to uh
[35:23] israel's blindness we're looking at part
[35:25] three
[35:26] so remember we have three reasons i'm
[35:28] sorry six reasons
[35:30] why god can save blinded people
[35:33] first because jesus prayed for
[35:35] forgiveness for those that didn't know
[35:37] what they were doing
[35:39] jesus wouldn't pray in vain so if jesus
[35:42] would pray for people that were
[35:44] unaware of what they were doing we know
[35:46] they can be forgiven or else he
[35:48] he would have been praying in vain but
[35:49] our lord doesn't waste words
[35:51] he doesn't waste prayers oh and jesus
[35:53] said oh he said i know that the father
[35:55] hears me always amen praise god
[35:58] the scripture just came to me right now
[35:59] praise god i know that thou hearst me
[36:01] always i'm write that down real quick
[36:03] i know that thou hears me always
[36:10] so if the jesus prayed it the father
[36:12] would certainly honor it
[36:13] praise god now the second reason was
[36:15] because of paul's teachings in romans 11
[36:17] he says
[36:18] elect there's election that was there's
[36:20] a remnant that was blinded
[36:22] uh to christ the rest were uh elected to
[36:26] believe it
[36:27] right so some were blinded some received
[36:30] it but then god
[36:31] will give them he'll graft them back in
[36:33] he'll graft in the ones that were
[36:35] blinded
[36:36] after the gentiles are done third uh the
[36:39] foreshadowing of the life of joseph
[36:41] proves
[36:42] right that god is good to the blinded
[36:44] israelis praise god
[36:45] because joseph types jesus christ and
[36:48] jesus is kind to his brethren
[36:50] who mistreated him and he feeds them
[36:52] he's good to them and then we know
[36:54] scripturally
[36:55] they get 12 of those 24 seats around the
[36:58] throne in heaven praise god
[37:00] so any blinded jew that's faithful to
[37:02] the word of god
[37:03] jesus will receive just like joseph
[37:05] received his brethren
[37:07] okay the fourth reason was the fist seal
[37:10] and this is what we looked at last time
[37:12] a few weeks ago let's see i believe it
[37:13] was on uh
[37:15] yeah november 25th wow it's almost been
[37:17] uh half a month here
[37:18] so uh we saw that there was four
[37:22] reasons that prove it was israel uh they
[37:24] were slain for the word of god
[37:27] uh which was the old testament they call
[37:29] for vengeance and christians don't call
[37:31] for vengeance so they have to be
[37:33] jews third they're given white robes
[37:36] after their deaths at the white throne
[37:38] judgment but we have them now
[37:40] right the baptism holy ghost is
[37:42] symbolically uh
[37:44] as as symbolic as clothes over your soul
[37:47] praise god and we'll look again at that
[37:49] a little bit more tonight by god's grace
[37:51] it's like your soul is clothed it's not
[37:54] naked it's clothed with life praise god
[37:56] and that's just that's how the bible
[37:58] gives some symbolism for the baptism of
[38:00] the holy ghost we must accept it
[38:02] and then fourth there was more fellow
[38:04] servants or brethren that would have to
[38:06] be
[38:06] martyred and so that takes us to the
[38:08] blood curse
[38:09] that the jews called upon themselves at
[38:12] the cross of jesus
[38:13] let his blood be upon us so only god
[38:17] knows
[38:18] that number that needs to be calculated
[38:21] uh that needs to have punishment on them
[38:23] for crucifying their own messiah only
[38:25] god knows that number
[38:26] we know it's more than 6 million right
[38:28] because 6 million
[38:29] jews died during the holocaust and
[38:31] that's just that's just in the 1940s
[38:34] right
[38:34] so think about all the jews that were
[38:36] martyred before that so the number
[38:38] must be a great number uh in order to
[38:41] equal
[38:42] the punishment that would go upon
[38:44] crucifying your own messiah
[38:46] so the numbers in the millions no doubt
[38:49] if not more
[38:51] now for tonight let's get right to the
[38:52] new things so the fifth seal also opens
[38:55] up brother and tells us
[38:56] where souls go he said they're not
[38:59] sleeping
[39:00] he said the souls are living he said
[39:03] they go somewhere
[39:04] they are alive right because some
[39:06] churches teach the soul goes
[39:08] and it lays there in the grave right it
[39:11] lays in the cemetery
[39:12] that's what a lot of churches teach and
[39:13] that's wrong the soul does not stay
[39:15] there with the body
[39:17] the soul leaves the body praise god amen
[39:19] and it goes
[39:20] one of three places now notice it's
[39:23] three
[39:23] because three is a number of perfection
[39:27] praise god
[39:28] right and it's after earth right it's
[39:31] after earthly life
[39:32] four is the number of earth right
[39:34] there's four reactions you can add to
[39:35] the gospel because you're on earth
[39:37] but after earth there's three locations
[39:41] you can go
[39:42] right because it's not uh because uh
[39:44] heaven and
[39:45] heaven under the throne and the heart of
[39:47] the earth uh doesn't pertain
[39:49] all to the earth it pertains to the
[39:51] afterlife
[39:52] right so it's a number three not number
[39:54] four four always pertains to the earth
[39:57] okay so it's even perfect with three
[39:59] praise god
[40:00] and the locations are under the altar
[40:03] of incense in heaven paradise in heaven
[40:06] and then
[40:07] the prison in the heart of the earth so
[40:09] those are the three locations
[40:11] you can go now uh here we know in the
[40:14] fifth seal
[40:15] jews go under the altar in heaven it's
[40:18] near the throne of christ
[40:20] and what a consolation to know how near
[40:23] jews
[40:24] are to christ who've kept the old
[40:27] testament praise god what a consolation
[40:31] and church not only that but they can
[40:32] cry out to jesus
[40:34] and be heard praise god amen that that
[40:38] shows if that doesn't show it i don't
[40:39] know what will
[40:40] but it shows the power of god's
[40:42] covenants praise god
[40:44] you can be under a previous covenant and
[40:46] if you honor that covenant
[40:48] god's still going to honor you praise
[40:50] god you don't you you don't honor the
[40:52] current covenant you're not under the
[40:54] current
[40:54] uh uh contract would say you're under a
[40:57] a previous contract
[40:59] but god still honors the previous if you
[41:01] can't see the current one praise god
[41:04] and he still hears your prayers that
[41:06] that's amazing that's amazing you're not
[41:08] living under the current contract
[41:09] can you imagine your job honoring the
[41:11] previous contract
[41:13] that's unheard of right with teachers
[41:15] you know we we're under
[41:16] always under the current contract we
[41:18] couldn't be under the old contract
[41:20] but yet god is so great that he honors
[41:22] the current one
[41:23] and the old one praise god hallelujah
[41:26] all the benefits praise god amen
[41:28] all the benefits of abraham praise god
[41:30] what was that
[41:31] that was uh that was about uh
[41:35] 4 000 years ago or i'm sorry not how
[41:37] many years ago had
[41:38] abraham been that was after the flood so
[41:41] about four thousand probably four
[41:42] thousand
[41:43] or maybe three thousand so four or three
[41:45] thousand years ago god still honoring
[41:47] that covenant today
[41:49] because he's a merciful god amen
[41:52] now so that's the first thing
[41:55] now let's look at this altar of incense
[41:58] here in the scripture so go to
[42:00] revelation 8 3. let's go there
[42:02] and let's just get a good look at this
[42:04] altar
[42:06] it's called an altar of golden altar of
[42:09] incense
[42:10] and it's the only altar mentioned in
[42:12] heaven that i can find
[42:14] in the new testament okay
[42:18] so it's called the golden altar of
[42:19] incense revelation 8 3
[42:21] and another angel came and stood at the
[42:23] altar having a golden sensor
[42:26] that was the container that of course
[42:28] had the incense in it and there was
[42:29] given unto him much
[42:30] incense that he should offer it up with
[42:33] the prayers of
[42:34] all saints upon the golden altar which
[42:37] was
[42:37] before the throne so there's a golden
[42:40] altar
[42:40] right an altar of incense right before
[42:43] the throne of jesus christ
[42:45] just like moses set up in the old
[42:47] testament praise god there was an altar
[42:49] of incense where prayers were offered
[42:51] right before the holiest of holies right
[42:54] right before
[42:55] the ark of the covenant because remember
[42:56] moses got the idea
[42:58] of his tabernacle from heaven's
[43:00] tabernacle praise god
[43:02] moses was the shadow the true was in
[43:04] heaven amen
[43:06] and so that's where he gets the idea now
[43:08] here's some more go to verse five
[43:09] and the angel took the censer and filled
[43:11] it with fire of the altar and cast it
[43:13] into the earth
[43:14] and there was voices and thunderings and
[43:16] lightnings
[43:18] and an earthquake right
[43:21] he cast the censer to the earth that's
[43:24] quite a striking thing i don't
[43:25] understand that
[43:27] but a sensor is cast to the earth and it
[43:29] looks like judgment
[43:30] because whenever you see thunderings
[43:31] lightnings earthquakes it speaks of
[43:34] judgment okay next
[43:38] verse is 9 13 revelation 9 13 this is
[43:41] under
[43:42] the sounding of the fifth angel
[43:46] this of course this is during the
[43:47] tribulation period 9 13
[43:51] and the six angels sounded i'm sorry now
[43:52] we're getting the sixth and i heard a
[43:54] voice from the four horns of the golden
[43:56] altar
[43:57] which is before god okay so there's a
[44:00] voice
[44:00] from the horn so you have a golden altar
[44:04] it's got four horns on it this is where
[44:05] they offer
[44:06] incense this is where the prayers are
[44:09] this is where the prayers begin to be
[44:10] answered it seems like
[44:12] because they must go up before the
[44:13] throne of god remember the incense had
[44:16] to go
[44:16] in to the holiest of holies right it had
[44:19] to make a way
[44:20] into the holiest of holies what a
[44:22] consolation church in our prayers even
[44:24] now praise god
[44:25] are going out to heaven and jesus hears
[44:28] our prayers amen
[44:29] like the incense that went before them
[44:31] in the holiest of holies
[44:32] that's how we go into the presence of
[44:35] god amen
[44:36] thank god for his mercy now they got to
[44:38] be real prayers they got to be fiery
[44:40] prayers right
[44:40] they got to be like compassionate
[44:42] prayers we heard about that on sunday
[44:44] praise god it just can't be flippant
[44:47] prayers or
[44:48] insincere prayers you have to feel it
[44:50] you have to have compassion for it that
[44:52] represents the fire of god the sincerity
[44:55] like like the bible said a preacher is
[44:58] like a firebrand plucked out of the fire
[45:00] praise god
[45:01] amen there's like a it's like it's like
[45:04] an instrument right for
[45:05] for keeping a fire going it's an
[45:07] instrument and it's on fire it's plucked
[45:09] out of the fire and it's
[45:11] burning with the life of jesus amen
[45:14] and so we see here now notice this
[45:18] altar of incense is the closest piece of
[45:20] furniture
[45:21] to the holiest of holies right just like
[45:24] in
[45:25] moses's tabernacle so you have a
[45:28] incense then you have a veil then you
[45:30] have the holiest of holies
[45:32] now hebrews 6 19 let's read that this
[45:35] tells us
[45:36] heaven also has a veil now that's
[45:38] interesting
[45:39] the earthly veil was rent right
[45:42] the earthly veil was wrapped but there
[45:44] must be a veil in heaven
[45:46] because the bible says so and it's in
[45:48] the new testament
[45:49] because this veil separates the jews
[45:51] that are not born again
[45:52] from those who are born again ah
[45:56] think about that church wow let's read
[45:58] hebrews
[45:59] 6 19 i'm not making this up this is all
[46:01] scriptural
[46:02] so the heavenly veil still exists
[46:08] which hope we have as an anchor for the
[46:10] soul both
[46:11] sure and steadfast and which entereth
[46:15] into that within the veil
[46:19] so our hope is not just well i hope so
[46:22] real divine hope reaches all the way
[46:25] behind the veil to the very heart of
[46:27] jesus amen
[46:29] so your hope and your faith is actually
[46:31] connected to jesus why
[46:33] because it's his faith amen it's a gift
[46:35] he shares with you praise god amen
[46:38] it's the holy spirit in you it's an
[46:40] attribute it's an attribute of the holy
[46:42] spirit
[46:42] and it reaches past the altar of incense
[46:45] behind the veil
[46:46] to the very heart of christ jesus amen
[46:50] it's hard to explain it's hard to
[46:52] explain right it's hard to understand
[46:54] but yet the bible says it's true so i
[46:55] believe it amen
[46:59] see saved blinded jews are close to
[47:02] christ
[47:02] but see there remains a distance between
[47:05] the jews
[47:06] and jesus because they're not born again
[47:09] there's distance
[47:10] so there's the altar of incense they're
[47:12] under the altar you have the altar you
[47:14] have angels speaking from the altar
[47:16] then you have a veil that's strange i
[47:19] got a little echo here
[47:21] anybody know where that echo is coming
[47:22] from
[47:25] oh sorry about that i just i'm just
[47:28] curious i don't know if it impacts the
[47:29] live stream or not
[47:31] if it don't then who cares but uh
[47:34] if it does i don't know that might
[47:36] impact uh mommy
[47:38] or anyone on the the livestream there so
[47:41] so see church there is a space there's
[47:43] jews under the altar the altar incense
[47:45] there's angels then you have a veil and
[47:48] then you have the throne of god
[47:50] or it's also called the holiest of
[47:51] holies in heaven as well
[47:53] amen so now revelation uh 14
[47:57] 18 revelation 14
[48:04] 18.
[48:06] and another angel came out from the
[48:07] altar which had power over
[48:09] fire and cry with a loud cry to him that
[48:12] had the sharp sickle saying
[48:14] thrust in the sharp sickle and gather
[48:17] am i reading the right verse and gather
[48:19] the clusters of the vine of the earth
[48:22] for her grapes are fully ripe
[48:26] oh yeah from the altar yeah another
[48:28] angel came forth from the altar
[48:30] so look at these angels where are they
[48:31] coming form they're coming from this
[48:34] altar of incense right so in other words
[48:37] all these prayers right of all these
[48:40] prayers of the saints for justice
[48:42] right all the prayers of the saints uh
[48:44] lord avenge me like that's the jews too
[48:46] right
[48:46] avengers they're all getting answered
[48:49] now praise god
[48:50] they're all getting answered now because
[48:52] remember that altar of incense right was
[48:54] where prayers go
[48:55] so all those prayers were stored there
[48:57] and then god makes sure
[48:59] every prayer is answered amen amen every
[49:01] prayer that was from a sincere heart
[49:03] that lined up with the will of god you
[49:05] know god is going to answer it praise
[49:07] god
[49:08] now let's go back to revelation 13. just
[49:10] i want to just lay this out real quick
[49:11] and this makes me unpopular i know but i
[49:14] just can't uh
[49:15] i just can't deny the word of god right
[49:17] so uh revelation
[49:19] well i'm always unpopular anyway but uh
[49:22] revelation
[49:22] uh nine let's go back there now a lot of
[49:25] people
[49:26] read verse
[49:30] 14 15 and 16 and
[49:33] and they say that all these demons have
[49:35] already been loose out of the river
[49:36] euphrates brother ram teaches this in
[49:38] feast of trumpets
[49:40] but i personally don't believe that okay
[49:42] that's just i'm just letting you know
[49:43] that's my opinion
[49:45] because these trumpets can't sound until
[49:47] after the rapture
[49:48] and after the 144 thousand have been
[49:50] sealed
[49:51] so people can believe what they want
[49:53] brother brahm never said thus saith the
[49:55] lord with the feast of the trumpets
[49:57] okay but they can just believe whatever
[49:59] they want right because this is already
[50:01] after
[50:02] uh the rapture has already taken place
[50:04] uh because god
[50:05] can't and this and the 144 thousand jews
[50:07] are already sealed
[50:09] right so let's read that 14 saying to
[50:12] the six angel which had the trumpet
[50:13] loose
[50:14] the four angels which are bound in the
[50:15] great river euphrates and the four
[50:17] angels were loose which were
[50:18] prepared for hour a day a month a year
[50:21] for
[50:21] to slay the third part of men and the
[50:23] number of the army of horsemen
[50:25] were 200 000 000 and i heard the number
[50:27] of them so 200 million demons right
[50:30] and we know brother man mentions it but
[50:32] i personally just believe he was doing
[50:33] his best to interpret the word
[50:35] i personally believe this can't happen
[50:37] until after the rapture
[50:38] you say prove it i'll be happy to
[50:40] revelation 7 verse 1
[50:46] verse 3 i'm sorry revelation 7 3
[50:49] sorry revelation 7 3 saying hurt not the
[50:52] earth nor the sea nor the trees till we
[50:54] have sealed the servants of god
[50:55] in their foreheads amen and then he
[50:58] lists who they are
[50:59] they're the jews praise god the earth
[51:01] can't be hurt the men can't be hurt
[51:03] none of these major things can happen
[51:05] until after
[51:06] those 144 000 get the holy ghost and
[51:09] that can't happen until after the three
[51:11] and a half year ministry of the two
[51:12] prophets praise god
[51:14] right because the bible said after they
[51:17] leave the remnant glorify god
[51:19] and then they're ready then to receive
[51:20] the one they were preaching about jesus
[51:22] amen
[51:23] amen so people can believe whatever they
[51:26] want you know i'll just
[51:27] i'll just kind of nod my head and think
[51:29] you know when people preach that you
[51:30] know that the 200 million demons are at
[51:31] least i'll just
[51:32] nod my head and say i won't say amen
[51:34] i'll just say that's what most people
[51:36] think
[51:36] but if you put all the scriptures
[51:38] together it just can't line up
[51:40] right then you have the tribulation
[51:42] started in 1940s
[51:45] if if people teach us and believe this
[51:47] the tribulation already started
[51:49] church because that was the sixth
[51:51] trumpet was it not the sixth trumpet
[51:52] was that yeah that was the sixth trumpet
[51:55] so that's true the rapture already
[51:57] happened we missed the rapture we're
[51:58] living in the tribulation
[52:00] and this is the longest tribulation
[52:01] anyone ever thought of right because
[52:04] it's been over
[52:04] it's almost been 80 years of tribulation
[52:06] right so see how strange that sounds
[52:09] when you really look at all these
[52:10] scriptures and you've got to line it up
[52:12] so
[52:12] i just agree to disagree and i'll just
[52:14] do it with love
[52:15] i'm going to make a doctrine out of it
[52:17] but i am gonna try to stay with and
[52:18] rightly divide the word of truth
[52:21] all right so just so you know that's
[52:22] just one thing i thought i would lay in
[52:23] there because we just read about it the
[52:25] altar of incense
[52:27] okay all right but you know
[52:30] if you stand on the word you're going to
[52:31] get criticized right right
[52:34] if you don't if you don't worship
[52:35] brother brandon you're getting
[52:36] criticized by the brother and worshipers
[52:37] right
[52:38] so you just got to stand above that you
[52:40] got to stand upon the word of god
[52:42] now there must be another altar though
[52:45] in the holiest of holies
[52:47] right we would call it the mercy seat
[52:49] because jesus's blood
[52:51] there's a portion of it in heaven so go
[52:54] to revelation 5
[52:56] verse 6 revelation 5 6.
[52:59] so somehow that physical body we know
[53:02] jesus physical body
[53:04] uh was crilled and crucified somehow i
[53:07] don't know if it was by
[53:08] angel or what but somehow that blood was
[53:11] some of that blood was preserved and
[53:12] taken to heaven
[53:14] right now i don't know how but
[53:16] revelation 5 6 and
[53:18] i be held alone in the midst of the
[53:19] throne of the four beasts in the midst
[53:20] of the elders to the lamb
[53:22] as it had been slain having a i'm sorry
[53:25] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[53:26] are the seven spirits of god
[53:28] sent forth into all the earth so there
[53:31] is some type of
[53:32] bloody looking uh body of christ right
[53:36] in heaven and that one came forth
[53:39] to take the book and redeem it praise
[53:41] god because no other man was worthy to
[53:44] take the book of redemption
[53:45] because no other man could redeem man
[53:48] except the holy man praise god
[53:50] the one who became sin the one who paid
[53:52] for our sins he was the only one who
[53:54] could take that book of redemption
[53:55] and say i'm buying it back i'm taking it
[53:57] back and then i'm going to open it and
[53:59] i'm going to send it back to earth
[54:01] praise god amen
[54:02] so that the saints can eat the
[54:04] revelations of the seven seals right the
[54:06] open book
[54:07] and they would have they would have
[54:08] honey in their lips but they'd be bitter
[54:10] in their bellies
[54:11] and they would take that and prophesy
[54:13] again to every nation
[54:16] that's the whole story right taking the
[54:17] restored book taking the real teaching
[54:19] of redemption
[54:20] and delivering it back to god's people
[54:22] i'm glad i can hear it praise god
[54:25] hallelujah amen
[54:28] glory revelation 19 13.
[54:36] revelation 19 13.
[54:40] i'm glad i got a good understanding
[54:42] aren't you church of redemption
[54:44] redemption is really not it's not just
[54:46] coming out of egypt
[54:47] that's what everybody believes today oh
[54:48] once you're out of egypt you're filled
[54:49] with the holy ghost
[54:50] you ain't in the promised land yet right
[54:53] just because you're out just because
[54:54] you're crossing the red sea you got
[54:55] baptized
[54:56] that don't mean you're fully redeemed
[54:57] yet you gotta he brought you out in
[55:00] order to take you in praise god amen
[55:02] see we didn't know that denominations we
[55:04] know it now praise god
[55:06] because the book's been open amen the
[55:08] book of redemption praise god
[55:10] amen see it truly shows that this
[55:14] revelation
[55:14] it's thus saith the lord and it has to
[55:16] go around the world to show us what real
[55:18] redemption is because the redeemer
[55:20] came he opened it and brought it down to
[55:22] earth praise god
[55:23] amen ah
[55:27] yep revelation 19 13 there's got to be
[55:29] some blood in heaven
[55:31] there must be a heavenly mercy seat
[55:33] there must be a heavenly altar
[55:35] or in other words a mercy seat
[55:38] and he was clothed with a veg vesture
[55:40] dipped in blood
[55:41] and his name is called the word of god
[55:44] he has a vesture or cloth right and
[55:47] there's blood
[55:48] on it where'd that blood come from it's
[55:50] the same blood that we saw revelation 5
[55:52] it has to be the blood of the lamb
[55:54] praise god
[55:55] it has to be the blood of the word amen
[55:58] the blood of jesus
[55:59] amen somehow god's able to to
[56:02] have that blood there in heaven as well
[56:05] on a heavenly altar in the holies of
[56:06] holies
[56:07] making intercession for you and i right
[56:09] now praise god
[56:11] amen what else can you depend on when
[56:13] satan says sister who did this
[56:14] brother amen to this sister christian
[56:16] did this what else can you trust in
[56:18] other than the blood of jesus praise god
[56:20] you and i have no other hope except to
[56:22] plead the blood praise god
[56:25] and that blood says jesus they accepted
[56:27] jesus's pardon for it
[56:29] and they're not guilty of it they're
[56:31] justified amen
[56:32] amen the blood they have to have blood
[56:35] there
[56:36] that has mercy on us praise god amen
[56:40] see and the bible says we currently have
[56:43] redemption
[56:44] colossians 1 14. colossians 1 14 is not
[56:47] something that uh
[56:48] we we had you know before it's not
[56:51] something that we'll just have in the
[56:52] future
[56:53] the bible says we are redeemed bro
[56:56] brought back
[56:56] and purchased right now praise god we
[56:59] are brought back
[57:00] to full authority of christians praise
[57:02] god
[57:04] the children of god look at colossians 1
[57:06] 14 in whom we have it
[57:08] i'm not looking for it brother amen i've
[57:10] got it praise god
[57:12] satan we don't we're not looking for
[57:13] redemption we've got it praise god
[57:15] we are redeemed we are now the children
[57:18] of god amen
[57:19] that's why when you pray god many times
[57:21] hears you that's why when you need help
[57:23] god shows up praise god that's why when
[57:25] you need a refreshing god sends it to
[57:27] you
[57:27] because you now have redemption amen
[57:30] like that brother told me last night he
[57:32] was deep in depression he said god
[57:34] had you call me he's like why did you
[57:36] call me i said well i was just going
[57:37] through i had some free time
[57:38] i was going through my old voicemails he
[57:40] said god had you call me because i
[57:42] needed encouragement tonight
[57:44] see why because i'm already redeemed
[57:46] right i'm already redeemed
[57:47] i'm already a child they that are led by
[57:49] the spirit of god are the children of
[57:51] god
[57:52] amen through what through my efforts no
[57:54] through the blood of jesus
[57:56] amen because he saved me i'm trusting in
[57:59] it he forgives me
[58:00] i've got redemption i'm brought back i'm
[58:02] a child of god
[58:03] i know who i am i know where i come from
[58:05] and i certainly know where i'm going
[58:07] praise god amen and we've got the
[58:10] forgiveness of sin so redemption
[58:12] part most of that or part of that aspect
[58:14] is forgiven of all sins
[58:16] god has nothing against us because we're
[58:18] walking in the light that he's given us
[58:21] amen all right
[58:25] so that's the first location is under
[58:27] the altar
[58:28] the second location is paradise up
[58:30] higher
[58:31] beyond it must be behind the veil or
[58:34] close to the veil
[58:35] above that is called paradise the bible
[58:38] calls it
[58:39] and this is only this is the second
[58:41] location only holy ghost filled
[58:43] saints go there amen that's where i want
[58:45] to go amen
[58:46] hallelujah see
[58:51] uh so i believe this is my opinion
[58:55] foolish virgin christians must go be
[58:57] with the
[58:58] by the jews somewhere they must be by
[59:00] the jews somewhere because they're not
[59:01] born again
[59:02] the jews are not born again they only
[59:04] have a testimony for the word of god
[59:06] and so they're under the altar of
[59:08] incense they're under the prayer altar
[59:10] so i believe that's where the foolish
[59:12] virgin goes i could be wrong on that
[59:15] but paradise we know used to be in the
[59:16] heart of the earth used to be abraham's
[59:18] bosom we know
[59:19] jesus took his own blood down there he
[59:22] defeated satan he rose with the keys of
[59:24] death
[59:24] and hell changed paradise location to
[59:27] heaven praise god and now it's also
[59:30] called the third heaven
[59:32] this is where the heavenly hosts and
[59:34] believers go praise god an
[59:36] innumerable number of angels amen and
[59:39] you and i one day will get to go there
[59:40] and see it praise god
[59:42] hallelujah now the third location is
[59:46] prison
[59:46] it's called hell in luke 16 23. it's
[59:49] located in the heart of the earth
[59:51] it's the third location disobedient
[59:54] unbelieving souls go there like jesus's
[59:56] story
[59:56] of the rich man and the beggar lazarus
[59:59] first peter 3
[1:00:00] also says jesus preached the disobedient
[1:00:03] souls
[1:00:04] in prison and he descended to hell i'm
[1:00:06] sorry when he descended to hell
[1:00:08] following his crucifixion all right
[1:00:13] now let's look at what happens and off
[1:00:16] the close of this because we're already
[1:00:17] coming up on time here
[1:00:18] let's close on this i just you know i
[1:00:20] felt led to put this in the book
[1:00:22] the bible tells you almost exactly
[1:00:24] what's going to happen after you die
[1:00:27] the bible tells us almost certainly
[1:00:28] what's going to happen so let's go to
[1:00:30] luke 16
[1:00:31] 22 please
[1:00:36] so immediately after a person dies and
[1:00:38] sometimes right before the person dies
[1:00:41] angels show up praise god
[1:00:44] amen luke 16 22 and it came to pass that
[1:00:47] the beggar died when was carried by the
[1:00:49] angels into abraham's bosom praise god
[1:00:53] the rich man also died and was buried
[1:00:55] verse 23 can you pull it up there hon
[1:00:57] and he and hell he lifted up his eyes
[1:00:58] being in torments and seeth abraham
[1:01:00] afar off and lazarus in his bosom
[1:01:04] okay so we know believers will instantly
[1:01:07] see angels remember when sister karen's
[1:01:09] mother passed away she said their whole
[1:01:11] family heard
[1:01:11] angels singing right before she passed
[1:01:13] away so that proves one of the first
[1:01:15] things that happens
[1:01:16] is you start breaking that realm and
[1:01:18] angels are there right at their post of
[1:01:19] duty
[1:01:21] see jesus knew yours was your time to
[1:01:23] cross over to reward
[1:01:24] so he sent some messengers to guide you
[1:01:26] guide you across right brother brown
[1:01:27] called him angel paul bears
[1:01:30] angel followers that helped moses get
[1:01:32] from a death right to resurrection
[1:01:35] and to escort him into that other
[1:01:37] dimension praise god
[1:01:38] amen so we know angels are
[1:01:42] waiting right there to take us ascending
[1:01:45] up to heaven praise god rather than
[1:01:48] descending to the heart of the earth
[1:01:49] right
[1:01:50] so it seems like faithful jews and
[1:01:52] foolish virgin christians would also
[1:01:54] grow
[1:01:54] go under the altar of incense
[1:01:57] the second thing that happens if you're
[1:02:00] not born again you keep your same
[1:02:02] mind right your same memories your same
[1:02:06] character
[1:02:07] your same convictions some of your own
[1:02:09] feelings whether good or bad
[1:02:12] i believe a holy ghost-filled saint
[1:02:14] he'll get a new theophany
[1:02:15] and he'll lose all those most of those
[1:02:17] old ones i believe that
[1:02:19] but if you're not born again you keep
[1:02:22] almost all your thoughts in your mind
[1:02:24] and that's proven by the jews right they
[1:02:27] wanted vengeance that proves they didn't
[1:02:28] have the right
[1:02:29] right mind right they still wanted
[1:02:30] vengeance
[1:02:32] okay it's also proven by a few other
[1:02:34] examples here let me look at him here
[1:02:37] the rich man that went to hell he was
[1:02:39] still unreasonable
[1:02:41] and he thought well his brothers would
[1:02:43] repent if they saw miracles look how
[1:02:45] unreasonable that is oh just show my
[1:02:47] brother's a miracle remember the
[1:02:48] rich man he said send lazarus to go let
[1:02:50] him resurrect and go tell my
[1:02:52] my brothers and that was totally
[1:02:55] unreasonable and abraham said they won't
[1:02:56] believe
[1:02:57] if they won't even believe the law how
[1:02:58] they're going to believe a resurrection
[1:03:01] see that proof church any miracle it's
[1:03:03] only for believers praise god
[1:03:05] amen right unbelievers are not going to
[1:03:07] receive it they'll write off and say oh
[1:03:09] he was pretending oh the sister was
[1:03:11] pretending
[1:03:12] see if you don't even believe the simple
[1:03:14] word of god the simple
[1:03:16] revelation of faith and jesus christ
[1:03:18] raising from the dead you ain't going to
[1:03:19] believe nothing else about miracles
[1:03:21] they'll find a way to write it off like
[1:03:23] a person asked me one time
[1:03:24] oh prove to me that your mom uh
[1:03:26] resurrect or prove to me that your mom
[1:03:28] was healed of cancer go get the medical
[1:03:29] forms i'm like i can't get it
[1:03:31] but you isn't her own testimony enough i
[1:03:33] said why don't you call her on the phone
[1:03:35] they wouldn't they didn't want to do it
[1:03:37] because they ain't going to believe
[1:03:38] anyway right there's
[1:03:39] going to be all and the one i think the
[1:03:41] one jehovah's witness guy told me
[1:03:43] he said well she probably never had
[1:03:45] cancer to begin with
[1:03:47] huh well they picked it up on their
[1:03:48] machine right
[1:03:50] she was getting sick and weakly and
[1:03:51] tired that's why she went for the
[1:03:53] doctor's appointment in the first place
[1:03:55] see if you won't believe a simple word
[1:03:57] you ain't going to believe the miracles
[1:04:00] so when when these people that are
[1:04:01] sinners when they die they keep all
[1:04:03] their
[1:04:04] their previous thoughts their
[1:04:05] convictions
[1:04:07] and when the ones that aren't born again
[1:04:08] they keep the same ones too like the
[1:04:10] jews
[1:04:13] see they don't have divine love still
[1:04:14] god lets them keep
[1:04:16] their thoughts
[1:04:19] so see witnessing a miracle doesn't save
[1:04:21] a person's soul just like brother dennis
[1:04:22] preach right it's a false sense of
[1:04:24] security
[1:04:25] faith and repentance lead to salvation
[1:04:27] amen
[1:04:29] now thirdly the third thing that will
[1:04:31] happen after that after you see angels
[1:04:33] and many people will keep their human
[1:04:35] spirit i believe the holy ghostfield
[1:04:37] saints get a new one though
[1:04:40] holy ghost filled believers receive a
[1:04:41] new celestial heavenly body
[1:04:44] it's called a theophany uh by most
[1:04:46] scholars
[1:04:47] it's our eternal body that's in the
[1:04:50] heavens imagine that
[1:04:51] it's eternal praise god it was always in
[1:04:54] the mind of god
[1:04:55] right and it was now it wasn't always
[1:04:58] there as a body right as a body
[1:05:00] it was always there in the mind of god
[1:05:03] so that means god's thoughts are just as
[1:05:06] eternal as god's creation praise god
[1:05:08] amen right because at one point there
[1:05:11] was nothing there was no angels there
[1:05:12] was no bodies
[1:05:13] it was just god but his thoughts about
[1:05:16] the bodies were eternal praise god
[1:05:18] and so the bodies are eternal amen
[1:05:22] so see the bible says paul says we groan
[1:05:26] earnestly desiring to be clothed upon
[1:05:28] with our
[1:05:29] house which is from heaven anybody
[1:05:31] growing up for that lately
[1:05:33] i grow them for a body that's not achy
[1:05:34] and tired
[1:05:36] right i grown for a body that doesn't
[1:05:38] have the same old mind battles and
[1:05:40] thoughts and fears and
[1:05:41] and complexes amen right we grown for
[1:05:45] that body
[1:05:46] that's eternal that doesn't have any
[1:05:48] faults it doesn't have any fears it
[1:05:50] doesn't have any weaknesses because we
[1:05:51] want to be strong
[1:05:52] we want to be like jesus amen
[1:05:56] he said we groan for that i just want a
[1:05:58] new body amen
[1:06:00] i just want a body that's going to get
[1:06:01] everything right praise god
[1:06:03] and glorify jesus but paul calls it
[1:06:06] clothing you're clothed with it
[1:06:09] now go to the second corinthians 5 3
[1:06:12] acacia
[1:06:13] 5 3 here's the scripture that says
[1:06:15] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:06:17] the soul and spirit are naked before god
[1:06:21] which is a shameful state right so see
[1:06:24] in other words
[1:06:24] to like when we think of nakedness we
[1:06:26] think of shame right like adam and eve
[1:06:28] they were
[1:06:28] instantly shameful when they realized
[1:06:29] they were naked well so is the soul that
[1:06:32] doesn't have the life of god
[1:06:34] in other words god must be like offering
[1:06:36] right god must be offering here
[1:06:37] put on my life here's the holy spirit
[1:06:39] here you know put this on it'll cover
[1:06:41] you
[1:06:41] it'll cover your shame it'll cover your
[1:06:44] guilt praise god
[1:06:45] it'll cover your embarrassments it'll
[1:06:47] cover all that
[1:06:48] just put my clothes on put my life on
[1:06:50] amen
[1:06:51] oh thank the lord second corinthians 5 3
[1:06:54] sorry
[1:06:56] remember brother man said god wants you
[1:06:57] to give you the holy ghost more than you
[1:06:59] want it
[1:07:00] so god is like knocking on your door
[1:07:02] here put some clothes on put some
[1:07:03] clothes on here
[1:07:05] your life is shameful put some clothes
[1:07:06] on put my life on
[1:07:09] look if so be that being clothed
[1:07:12] we shall not be found naked
[1:07:16] what person uh in their same mind wants
[1:07:19] to be discovered naked
[1:07:20] it's a shame right for most sane people
[1:07:24] for insane people they like to be half
[1:07:25] naked or holy naked or whatever right
[1:07:28] but god but paul says if yours if your
[1:07:31] soul doesn't have that theophany
[1:07:33] if it does if it's not born again your
[1:07:35] souls naked or shameful before god
[1:07:37] that's why they got to be under the
[1:07:38] altar not above because they haven't
[1:07:41] quite come into god's presence all the
[1:07:43] way
[1:07:44] right that's why they got to be under
[1:07:45] the altar
[1:07:48] so there's a level of uh now this is
[1:07:51] quite a deep thought here that the soul
[1:07:53] is naked before god okay so see that
[1:07:57] so when when when let's say let's say
[1:07:58] the jewish person
[1:08:00] they're a true jew they die their body
[1:08:02] stays here but church their human spirit
[1:08:04] goes like this it ascends up to heaven
[1:08:06] now it's got the soul inside of it is
[1:08:07] everybody with me
[1:08:09] right because your soul is the nature of
[1:08:11] your human spirit it goes up there and
[1:08:13] it still cries out to god
[1:08:14] but it's still naked before god it
[1:08:17] doesn't have the right kind of clothing
[1:08:19] on it
[1:08:19] but jesus promised you just wait i'm
[1:08:21] going to give you a white robe praise
[1:08:23] god
[1:08:24] at the white throne judgment because you
[1:08:26] missed it during your life
[1:08:27] right but i'll give it to you because
[1:08:30] you're faithful to what you knew
[1:08:32] i'll give you clothing so you won't be
[1:08:34] ashamed for all eternity
[1:08:36] amen an eternal body in the heavens amen
[1:08:39] we're groaning we're groaning for that
[1:08:42] see because we already got a portion of
[1:08:43] it right here
[1:08:44] our souls our clothes our soul has the
[1:08:47] strength of jesus
[1:08:48] and now we just want the rest of it to
[1:08:50] have it amen we want the rest of these
[1:08:52] three parts to have it right
[1:08:53] we want the other two to have god's
[1:08:55] god's clothing on it pray because we're
[1:08:57] ashamed of this aren't we
[1:08:59] every time we sin we're ashamed of this
[1:09:01] every time we have evil thoughts right
[1:09:02] uh
[1:09:03] sometimes i have evil thoughts and later
[1:09:04] i'll repent i'll say how in the world
[1:09:06] did i think that
[1:09:08] what what inspiration was i under the
[1:09:10] devil's influence
[1:09:11] the devil's inspiration right and we're
[1:09:13] ashamed of that why because
[1:09:14] our mind's not always clothed the
[1:09:16] clothing comes off and on
[1:09:18] you understand the anointing comes off
[1:09:20] and on the mind right
[1:09:21] sometimes it's strong sometimes it's
[1:09:23] covered sometimes anointing leaves
[1:09:28] all right
[1:09:29] [Music]
[1:09:31] yeah i better yeah okay guys i got two
[1:09:33] minutes on here just to kind of give us
[1:09:35] a little bit of a cushion there so
[1:09:36] that's the third thing that happens a
[1:09:38] holy ghost-filled saint
[1:09:39] he gets a he gets clothing for his soul
[1:09:41] he gets a theophany body
[1:09:42] so his spirit and soul can go right into
[1:09:45] another body
[1:09:47] an eternal body in the heavens that was
[1:09:50] always there for us
[1:09:52] hallelujah like brother said he's going
[1:09:55] to get his hair back
[1:09:56] he's going to go get all the hair that
[1:09:58] he lost right it went back to where it
[1:10:00] was
[1:10:01] that's just a small thing right we all
[1:10:03] we really desires the perfection praise
[1:10:05] god
[1:10:05] but that's just a little thing little
[1:10:07] joke there now the fourth thing is
[1:10:09] after death after your angels escort you
[1:10:12] you get a new body
[1:10:13] the next thing is you are present with
[1:10:15] jesus now remember things there
[1:10:17] move really fast things here move really
[1:10:20] slow although we
[1:10:21] think they move faster things move very
[1:10:24] fast because you have satan accusing
[1:10:26] all night day and night he's accusing us
[1:10:28] and jesus says under the blood of the
[1:10:29] blood
[1:10:30] think about all the saints around the
[1:10:31] world he's accusing me that's a lot of
[1:10:33] visits to the throne of god
[1:10:35] that's a lot of pardons he gives us
[1:10:37] praise god amen
[1:10:39] and yet he's got time to go prepare a
[1:10:40] place for us
[1:10:42] a heavenly mansion called the new
[1:10:43] jerusalem right he's got time to do that
[1:10:47] and yet he's got time to be present with
[1:10:49] those that have passed on
[1:10:52] because paul says that in second
[1:10:53] corinthians 5 8 can you pull that up
[1:10:56] there
[1:10:58] he's got time to make the new jerusalem
[1:11:00] he's got time to forgive us
[1:11:02] he's got time to rebuke satan
[1:11:05] and he's got time to be present with you
[1:11:09] and anyone who dies before the rapture
[1:11:12] we are confident i say and willing
[1:11:14] rather to be absent from the body
[1:11:15] and to be present from with the lord
[1:11:18] rather
[1:11:19] present with the lord now it's it's
[1:11:21] uncertain how much we'll see him right
[1:11:23] because
[1:11:23] when brother bran went beyond the
[1:11:24] current time he said you can't see him
[1:11:26] now he's higher
[1:11:27] so i really can't explain that okay
[1:11:30] because i'm not sure which part brother
[1:11:31] man got to go to which part of paradise
[1:11:33] you got to go to i'm not sure
[1:11:35] i don't know but the bible says and if
[1:11:39] paul said
[1:11:40] we will be present with the lord we will
[1:11:42] be present with the lord
[1:11:45] right because paul's not going to lie he
[1:11:47] was inspired by the holy spirit
[1:11:50] but and we also know he's constantly
[1:11:52] making intercession for us as well
[1:11:55] intercession he's going between us and
[1:11:57] the father
[1:11:58] right and that's beyond behind the veil
[1:12:01] because that's how the high priest made
[1:12:02] intercession he had to go behind the
[1:12:03] veil
[1:12:04] and the bible said there's a veil in
[1:12:05] heaven and the holy spirit is in heaven
[1:12:08] he's got all this time to do all this
[1:12:10] intercession
[1:12:12] because he's the author of time he's not
[1:12:14] bound to it he lets time work for him
[1:12:20] let me find a place to stop here fifth
[1:12:24] you'll be reunited with members
[1:12:28] of the family that were believers uh
[1:12:30] that's in ii samuel 12
[1:12:32] 23. ii samuel 12 23
[1:12:35] in this case david is reunited with the
[1:12:38] the baby that died
[1:12:40] uh from his uh immoral union with
[1:12:42] bathsheba
[1:12:43] through adultery but the bible said
[1:12:46] they'll be reunited
[1:12:47] but now he's dead wherefore should i
[1:12:50] should i fast can i bring him back again
[1:12:52] i shall go to him but he shall not
[1:12:54] return to me
[1:12:56] see there is a reuniting with loved ones
[1:12:58] right but iran saw the millions running
[1:13:00] to my precious brother
[1:13:01] he said his wife even hope just hugged
[1:13:04] him and said my precious brother
[1:13:05] he thought oh sure she's gonna say i
[1:13:07] love you bill you're my husband and she
[1:13:08] didn't
[1:13:10] she just said to my precious brother and
[1:13:12] moved on
[1:13:15] interesting okay so we get reunited
[1:13:19] it's a great consolation to those who've
[1:13:21] lost children through tragedies or
[1:13:23] accidents miscarriages and more like we
[1:13:24] prayed for tonight
[1:13:27] also as a believer you'll instantly
[1:13:29] recognize saints who live before you
[1:13:33] because on mount transfiguration peter
[1:13:35] james and john
[1:13:36] got in the vision of of the
[1:13:39] the heavenly vision right and they
[1:13:41] instantly knew moses and elijah
[1:13:43] moses lived 1500 years before peter yet
[1:13:47] peter said that's moses amen
[1:13:49] see when you get that mind of the holy
[1:13:50] spirit you'll recognize all the saints
[1:13:52] amen
[1:13:53] why because they're your family they're
[1:13:56] part of god they're part of the
[1:13:57] they're in your family abraham's family
[1:14:00] praise god
[1:14:01] amen they also recognize elijah who was
[1:14:04] 900 years alive before peter james and
[1:14:07] john
[1:14:08] oh i know exactly what he looks like
[1:14:10] that's elijah
[1:14:12] right church we're gonna recognize
[1:14:14] people that are six thousand years old
[1:14:16] praise god adam and and and abel and
[1:14:20] abel praise the lord and bye we're gonna
[1:14:23] just recognize them because we're under
[1:14:24] the anointing of the holy spirit
[1:14:27] we're going to be under the vision of
[1:14:28] god right the leadership of god we have
[1:14:30] new eyeballs in
[1:14:31] hallelujah we have brand new glorified
[1:14:34] eyeballs
[1:14:35] or if we're not if we don't the
[1:14:37] glorified bodies yet we'll have
[1:14:38] theophany eyeballs
[1:14:40] and we'll see the theophany bodies with
[1:14:42] theophany's spiritual eyes
[1:14:44] and we'll recognize him instantly
[1:14:47] brother branham hallelujah
[1:14:49] right oh my think about it church
[1:14:53] all these blessings instantly after we
[1:14:55] cross over to that other side
[1:14:59] the bible said at jesus resurrection
[1:15:01] many of the old testament saints
[1:15:02] went into the holy city and appeared to
[1:15:05] many
[1:15:06] right and if they're under that
[1:15:07] anointing perhaps they recognized it
[1:15:09] right
[1:15:10] if they're under that holy anointing of
[1:15:12] god's spirit
[1:15:14] let's stand here i better stop here
[1:15:15] because i'm about ready to
[1:15:17] to head out here
[1:15:22] hallelujah so lastly the last thing
[1:15:24] we'll see is once we get their church we
[1:15:26] will bask
[1:15:26] in the glory of angel worship because
[1:15:29] the bible said the angels cease not
[1:15:31] and they cry all day holy holy
[1:15:34] holy is the lord god almighty imagine as
[1:15:36] we as the angels uh
[1:15:38] uh accompany us as they're like our uh
[1:15:41] our escorts as they escort us closer and
[1:15:43] closer
[1:15:44] the songs will get louder and louder
[1:15:46] what does that sound
[1:15:47] holy holy and as we grow closer we get
[1:15:50] louder and louder
[1:15:52] and louder and now our new ears can
[1:15:54] handle it now right
[1:15:56] we're not going to cover our ears like
[1:15:57] we do down here oh it's too loud
[1:15:59] somebody turn down the noise
[1:16:00] it's going to be music to our new ears
[1:16:04] as the angels cries get louder and
[1:16:06] louder and then we see
[1:16:08] jesus because to be absent from this
[1:16:10] body
[1:16:11] is to be present with the lord amen
[1:16:14] musicians you can come by god's grace
[1:16:21] which was and is and is to come
[1:16:25] [Music]
[1:16:26] revelation 5 12 says we'll hear
[1:16:30] loud voices shouting worthy is a lamb
[1:16:32] that was slain to receive power
[1:16:35] and riches and wisdom and strength and
[1:16:37] honor and glory
[1:16:39] in blessing loud
[1:16:42] shouts of praise now you think we shout
[1:16:44] loud here what about over there
[1:16:46] what about angels shouting men
[1:16:49] angels shouting what about the saints
[1:16:53] shouting and praise the lord
[1:16:55] joining that new song right joining in
[1:16:57] that heavenly song
[1:16:59] be new to us
[1:17:02] all these things instantly happen
[1:17:06] after we leave this shadow life
[1:17:09] and we go to the true life how are we
[1:17:11] looking forward to that true life
[1:17:12] amen hallelujah certainly with all of
[1:17:16] our hearts
[1:17:16] can we sing that song go to live with
[1:17:18] god
[1:17:19] i'd like to just sing that song here
[1:17:21] tonight
[1:17:24] church let's just take this attitude
[1:17:26] here tonight as we
[1:17:28] close this service
[1:17:35] let's just have this attitude here that
[1:17:37] uh we'll
[1:17:38] go through every trial
[1:17:42] let's have this attitude of we're just
[1:17:43] groaning oh lord how i want to have a
[1:17:46] new body
[1:17:47] let's not get comfortable here on this
[1:17:49] earth

[1:17:54] bodies let's not enjoy life too much
[1:17:57] here
[1:17:59] let's look forward to a perfect body and
[1:18:02] church i think the longer we think about
[1:18:03] it
[1:18:03] then we'll start groaning right we'll
[1:18:05] start feeling
[1:18:08] our need for that new body

[1:18:20] be clothed upon
[1:18:21] with our house which is from heaven
