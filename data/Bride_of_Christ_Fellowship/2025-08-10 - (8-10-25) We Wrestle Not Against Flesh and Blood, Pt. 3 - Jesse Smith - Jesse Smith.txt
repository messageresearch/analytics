TRANSCRIPT
========================================
here preaching just one service and uh I had forgot to let the church know that his son David might come uh and if he comes I asked him to give his testimony now he's freshly out of the Marines he was in there four years he's freshly out of the Marines and uh he's told me a little bit about his testimony and uh so if he comes here's what I'll probably do I'll probably uh ask everybody who I mean if you can't stay for like a second service we'll probably have like a just a short second service for a testimony. Um, and he has a wonderful testimony. Did you start the live stream yet? Okay, you did. Okay, then I'm not going to share details. Yeah, I'll share it later by God's grace, but thank you, hun. Um, but he has a just a wonderful testimony there. I was just really impressed uh by the honesty that he shared and uh uh the transparency. I just thought it was really special. Um the repentance and so forth. God's done a great work in his life. So, uh, my plan, saints, is that, you know, we can have first service with brother Brian and then maybe we all can quickly get some food real quick or we could, um, maybe order some pizza or whatever. We just got to find a plan to quickly eat as possible. Maybe about 2 o'clock just start a little testimony service. Okay. Um, that's the plan. And I know at some point we got to get back into our two services, you know? So, I'll talk to the moms about that. Want to get back into that and give this whole day to the Lord. This is the Lord's day. Praise God. And Brother Brandon did it. It's such a good example. You know, we've done it for years and years and years and just taking a little break for the young moms with the young babies. Hallelujah. By God's grace. So, so thankful for those little babies by God's grace. &gt;&gt; Uh, such a joy. Hallelujah. So, that's next Sunday. Really looking forward to that. Uh, Brother Cam invited me out to preach for him. So, I'll be working with some dates. You know, I'll probably go out preach for brother Cam and I'll need a guest minister to come in. He asked me to minister there. So, I I was talking to brother Simon and brother Cam about having them out, you know, to minister for us. So, we'll see how that goes. We always look forward to our brethren. Hallelujah. In the faith, coming to preach God's word. How many love the word of God? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ephesians chapter 6 here. Verse 10. I just want to This is part three. It's just going to be a short series probably. You know, I do I was studying this weekend to get back to the God hiding himself in simplicity. I was studying on that yesterday and today. Uh but then at the last moment, I kind of felt, well, let me deal with this thought here today and uh hopefully it'll be a blessing uh by the grace of the Lord. It's Ephesians 6:10. Oops, went a little too far here. Pardon me. Hallelujah. And I trust after last weekend with a testimony of my cousin, I trust that you've had more victories in your battles this week by God's grace. I know I have. Hallelujah. And I shared a little bit about that on Wednesday. Um how our brother, you know, went home. He drove three hours on Sunday and he said he still felt the anointing. Said he felt the anointing as soon as he drove into Akran. There must be some type of holy anointing around this city. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And it's every city that has the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Sheffield. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lorraine, you know, wherever it may be. Uh, hallelujah. Albian, you know. Uh, and then he said that anointing stayed on him till he drove three hours away and he was able to see more victory in his life and he woke up Monday morning with the anointing on him. What a blessing. Praise God. &gt;&gt; How you know the anointing's on you? Because you hate evil. &gt;&gt; That's how you know. &gt;&gt; You want to obey the word of God. Hallelujah. You might feel it really heavy. You might not. One thing you will do, you will hate sin and you will love the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Ephesians 6:10. I'll read 10 and 11 and we can all read 12. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the ws of the devil. Let's read this on three. 1 2 3. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. May God add his blessing to the ring of his word. You can be seated. By God's grace, I just have a few slides I want to show. This is from 2016. I preach a little series on the armor of God. So, I just thought I'll just review real quick uh so you can see some quotes from God's prophet, Brother Brandham. We've been looking at a wrestling u we wrestle not against flesh and blood. Okay? And what stuck out to me, brother Ray and brother Malachi, since you guys are visitors, was I went in the Greek and I I found out what that word wrestle meant. It means to throw someone down and choke them out. And I didn't realize, you know, I'd forgotten that. I preached on that, but I'd forgotten that. And then Jesus said that third kind of ground, the word gets choked &gt;&gt; by cares of the world and riches. So those two things will really choke out a Christian. &gt;&gt; Now, if they're in that case though, they're a foolish virgin, right? But a a wise virgin should be able to cast down and get, in other words, get all those uh sins weeded out of their lives. Praise God. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; But we're still going to wrestle. We're still going to go through we're going to battle sin our whole lives. But we won't let our lives be totally choked out. &gt;&gt; All right? &gt;&gt; So you put yourself in here. Now sisters, your garment goes way down to here. &gt;&gt; So you sisters picture this is you too. It's our brothers too. Now of course that's probably a Roman, right? And the Bible says thighs nakedness. So he's just about ready to show his show his nakedness there. You know Isaiah 47 says your thighs nakedness. Um but just the visual. So this is each one of you here today. I'm up there, but don't just let me stay up there. You go up there, too. Praise God. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; That's you. You are fighting uh not flesh and blood, not brothers in the church or sisters in the church or people at work. No, you're fighting demonic powers that are around you. &gt;&gt; Wickedness in high places. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And God has not left you alone to fight by yourself. God's fully equipped you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You got more than enough to win the battle. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Wednesday, we looked at standing and how God just wants us to stand. So when we're overcoming sin, we're standing like this. Now when we fall short, it's somehow the enemy either knocks these weapons out of our hands or our defenses &gt;&gt; or we just lay them down ourselves. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And then after that, once once we got it laid down, that's when he can tackle us and throw us down. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But like he's not gonna There's no way he could t There's no way a guy could tackle him if he's got the shield up and the sword. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to tackle him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to throw him nowhere. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Because he's going to stop you here and then he's going to cut you here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, we got to realize this is what's happening in our lives. &gt;&gt; And like I said Wednesday, you've got to put this on. &gt;&gt; You don't go to bed with this on. You've got to put it on. I guess if the anointing stays on you though, three hours away, I guess you it could remain on you. I guess if it's a powerful anointing, I guess I should rephrase that. If you wake up and the Holy Ghost is still on you and you're ready to fight, well then praise God that I guess that's possible. Hallelujah. Brother Ram said Moses lived so close to God. Pharaoh didn't know what to do with him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so, uh, I guess you can live so close to God that the anointing's on you when you go to sleep and it's on you when you wake up. But if it's not, you've got to put it on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the point we want to make. So, what I what I mean is sometimes we just wake up and we don't put on the armor of God. We don't seek after the kingdom of God, &gt;&gt; right? This is the kingdom of God. Jesus said, "The kingdom of God is within you." Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of this armor, all the defenses, and the offensive sword, all this is in you, and you got to put it on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm just going to read through a brief few quotes here. Again, this is from 2016. I thought I'd just briefly go through this brief briefly. And those are all my, you know, I just want to look at just a few. Oh, yeah. The scripture says, "G up now the loins of your mind." So, brother Ram says the first thing and the Bible teaches the first thing is the belt of truth on the loins. And brother Ram said, you know, that that this belt holds up everything else. So, you know, I don't know if that drawing was exactly accurate, but we know the first thing Paul tells us is get your mind right in the morning. &gt;&gt; Get your mind on the gospel. &gt;&gt; Get your Why would you put your mind on bad things? Let's put your mind on good things. The gospel means good news. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's able to save sinners. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And brother Ram said, "See, it's the belt that holds the rest of it together &gt;&gt; in the day when there's all kinds of isms." He said, "Gird yourself with the truth." Jesus said, "I am the truth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So the truth, un having the true beliefs of the word of God holds everything else together. You got to believe the truth. That's why false doctrine is such a curse, &gt;&gt; then if you have false doctrine, you don't even have the belt on, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's true. Because it's the truth of the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Uh, brother Ram said, "It's good to see the truth buckled around you knowing where you're standing." Hallelujah. You have the whole armor buckled on down uh good and tight, pulled down with the truth of God's word anchored in your heart and of course mind as Peter said the loins of your mind. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And he says now when you've got the truth, brother says all devils in hell can't upset you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you know the truth. How can a devil upset you when you know the truth? You know he's lying. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Isn't that beautiful? Praise God. He says, uh, when they went to the war, they had a big belt that buckled it together, held up their loins, their shields, kept the enemy's spears off. When the loin began to get weak, hang down. They had to tighten up their belt. Bring them up tight again. &gt;&gt; So, in other words, we got to bring our thoughts when we get go through trials. Bring your thoughts back onto the word of God. Tighten your thought your thought life up a little bit. &gt;&gt; You're getting too loose thinking about things you shouldn't think about. Think about the things of God. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; See that? That's why every thought must be brought into captivity to the gospel &gt;&gt; or else you're going to get loose. Your thoughts are and church, we all experience it. I mean, if if if any of you have a good morning routine, you know what it means to your mind is right. And then the first little thing &gt;&gt; like, well, I'll just check the news or I'll just check that, &gt;&gt; right? And and we we understand, right? We can all understand. Wow, that's Satan trying to get your belt a little loose. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, do we have to deal with the news? Yes, we know Israel's God's time piece, right? All these things, right? &gt;&gt; We want to understand that, &gt;&gt; right? But we got to remember all these things are just little tactics of Satan trying to get our mind loose off the word of God. We've got to keep our mind tight on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, we all seen these guys, right, brother Mal? We all see these guys ride around and their pants are hanging down, right? And they got we're seeing I'm like, this shows now that's a natural. That's actually a natural of what the spiritual is. Oh, that's good. That's good. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; We laugh at them or we get sad at them. Whatever you do, it's a shame either way, right? &gt;&gt; It's just gross, disgusting, immodest, all these things. It might be a sign of homosexuality, all these things. We understand that. And we don't laugh at sin. &gt;&gt; But that's how we are, church. That's how we would be spiritually if we start meditating on things that don't please God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; So, you know, we might laugh or snicker or say, "Oh, that's so bad." But what about us? Are we putting our minds on the things of God? &gt;&gt; Let's bring it down to home. Praise God. &gt;&gt; It's easy to preach against Leodysia and the days of No. That's easy, right? It's easy for us to say amen about that. But let's make sure our mind is focused on the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Ram says when you begin to feel like slacking, anybody feel like slacking sometime? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; I was tired this morning. I'm not anymore, but I was tired this morning. I felt like slacking in my body this morning. And oh, it's no use. So the devil said it's no use for you to pray, right? It's no use for you to go to church. It's no use for you to read your Bible. Brother said, "Reach down and tighten the belt a little bit. Pull up the sword a little tighter in your hand." Amen. &gt;&gt; Go forward. I like that. Be ready for the march. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I can't march throughout my day. I can't march through this service unless my mind is totally focused on God's word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We see it, church. We see it. And this is a wrestling match. Remember, &gt;&gt; if we don't do this, then Satan can pin us down and he's got us all choked up. You ain't gonna say no praise to God today. &gt;&gt; You're not going to sing any songs. You're not going to testify. You're not talking about Jesus. You're not going to say anything today. I've got you defeated. &gt;&gt; That's just what the devil wants. &gt;&gt; Come on, soldier. Amen. &gt;&gt; Tighten up your belt. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Tighten up your thoughts. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. As soon as you do that, you'll feel those faith muscles come back &gt;&gt; like, "Oh, this guy's not so heavy." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You'll push him off, stand up. I'm feeling a lot better now by God's grace. Amen. Where's my shield? Where's my sword? Now I'm ready to fight. Let's get this day back on track. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it all starts if we just get loose with our thinking. Hallelujah. God help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now again, I'm just going to hit the highlights here by God's grace. So, brother says, "Oh, yeah. Now, the breastplate of righteousness." Now, the Bible says we have no righteousness of our own, but it's the righteousness of Jesus Christ. And what does that protect? Your heart. Right? &gt;&gt; So, brother says, "You've got the word of God in you doing what's right, the breastplate of righteousness." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, first you got your mind right and now your heart. Your heart represents your emotions. So, you need a shield over your emotions. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says your emotions are shielded with Jesus's righteousness, not your own righteousness. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, other words, when you put that on, you know Jesus made me righteous. &gt;&gt; I didn't do it myself, brother Ray. I couldn't do it. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Right. We we we cannot make ourselves righteous. It's not my armor. It's his armor. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He protects my heart. And I remember I'm not righteous, but he gave me his righteousness when he died on the cross, rose from my sins, and I believed in it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; And what's Satan's desire for you to take off that breastplate? &gt;&gt; Right? So then now you're you can get hit, right? You can get shot there and think, "Well, I'm not righteous. I'm no good." Right? Well, of course you're no good. Hallelujah. Of course, you're not righteous. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You're not. Your righteousness isn't enough to fight the devil. It takes the righteousness of Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, but he wants to take off. He wants to loosen your belt. &gt;&gt; Right. Loosen up your thoughts. Take off the breastplate. And now, well, you're right, devil. I'm not very righteous. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; I am no good. Why should I even go to church? &gt;&gt; Why should I even go to Bible study? Why should I even pray? I'm not righteous anyway. But Jesus gave you a protection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus gave you a righteousness. He gave you a shield. Hallelujah. And you can say, "I'm not righteous. But he gave me his." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm going to do what's right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm going to witness. I'm going to testify. I'm going to pray. I'm going to seek God. I'm going to draw nigh to God. I'm drawing nigh to God. And then God draws nigh to me. &gt;&gt; Because of his righteousness, not because of mine. &gt;&gt; All right. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The helmet of salvation. Brother says he says now that's the mind in here. The head covers over the head. And he said now he says look at this. He goes on the brass headpiece knowledge of knowing this. My healing comes from God. &gt;&gt; My salvation comes from God. My experience matches his word. Not the church's idea. The word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Satan would love to get us loosen the belt. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Forget about Jesus righteousness &gt;&gt; and then for forget the idea that uh oh well maybe I can't be healed. &gt;&gt; Maybe I'm not saved. How often the devil battles us with that? &gt;&gt; Listen church, if you're battling whether you're saved or not, it's time to put that helmet back on &gt;&gt; because that will protect you. And remember, I am saved. Not by my righteousness, but by grace I'm saved through faith. Hallelujah. And I'm not boasting in my works. I'm boasting in my savior. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you don't feel saved, it's time to put the armor back on. Put your helmet back on. Know that you're saved. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Same thing for healing. Brother Ram says, same thing for healing, right? Uh the atonement not only healed our souls, it healed our bodies. &gt;&gt; If anybody knows about healing as brother Ray, hallelujah. At least in here. Well, Jose does too. He has a lot of healings, too. By God's grace. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that's because God helped them to keep their helmets on. &gt;&gt; Now church, some of us are younger, but we're going to come down to that time where we might get a lot of sicknesses. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; There might be accidents at work. And then we got to make sure the helmet of salvation is on us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember, know that I am saved. I am already healed. By his stripes, I was healed. Put that on because Satan's trying to attack. He's trying to get you to take it off and then choke you out and won't let you breathe. Won't let you get any life. Amen. Oh, there it is. the life. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's trying to choke you out so you have no spiritual life to fight him with. Hallelujah. But you have life. And Jesus said, "I give you life that you might have it more abundantly." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Here's the life. Put on the helmet. Make sure the belt's tightened up. Put on the breastplate. You've got life. Let's live. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's live to the glory of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As I said Wednesday, why would you spend your whole day on your back like this? The devil just getting victory over. Why would you spend the whole day like that when you don't have to? &gt;&gt; Why would I do that? Why would you do that? Just take a moment to pray. Confess your sins. You'll feel the faith coming back in your members. You'll feel revival. You'll feel emotion for Jesus. It'll all come back. And then you can stand up for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "Having done all, do what? Stand." &gt;&gt; That's all he wants you to do is stand for him. Don't let yourself be the word means throw. So they would probably take you by your uh your uniform, right? The Roman uniform. Throw them down like they do in Judah. We study Judah, right? In martial arts. The big thing is get their get their uniform, throw them down. Whether you got to do it over your hip, whatever you got to do, trip them. &gt;&gt; That's Satan's desire to throw you down and then choke you out. You have no life, no influence. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Remember that man without the wedding garment in the parable when Jes when he said, "Where's your garment?" He had nothing. &gt;&gt; See, it's like he was choked out. He had no testimony. They said, "What'd you do? Come in another way?" He couldn't say nothing. Why? He was spiritually choked out. He didn't make the rapture &gt;&gt; because he'd been wrestled down and he had nothing to share. He had no testimonies to share. Thank God if you got a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank God if God's been watching over you. Hallelujah. And you can testify about the glory of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The love of Jesus Christ. Thank God you got an experience that matches the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now the feet shout. Now this one doesn't have the picture. They actually had she is what they're called, which is just like defenses for the shins &gt;&gt; all the way up to the knees. &gt;&gt; Okay. Brother Bam just makes one statement. He says, "Go anywhere, any place, any time, feet shod with the gospel." &gt;&gt; Okay. So, Satan will try get us to loosen our belt, take off our helmet. I don't I'm not even saved. I don't even know if I'm saved. I don't have any righteousness. Uh my mind just is going to uh my mind's just going to wander on all these things. And then he tries to get you to take off your shoes and your sheav. &gt;&gt; And what does that mean? The Lord says, "Go pray for that. Go visit that person. uh go make that payment where you need to make your payment, right? Go to the bank and make the payment or something or go to that go to that person's house and give them a meal and you're like, "Ah, what good will it do anyway?" &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; Why should I help them out? They never help me out. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; See what it is? He's got He's got people choked out and they can't do anything for Jesus. Praise God. &gt;&gt; They can't go anywhere. They can't do anything. It's all In other words, it's all about them. It's selfishness. It's isolation. It's living for oneself. But we're not to live for ourselves. We're to live for others. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But see, putting on the feet, Sean, it caused you to go somewhere, maybe visit a small little church sometime, &gt;&gt; right, brother Malai? &gt;&gt; It might cause you to do that. I went to Sheffield last year, so that was my time to go visit. And you told me I should go for prayer, and I did. Remember that? &gt;&gt; You might not. You have so many testimonies. You might not remember that, brother, but I appreciate you. Brother Ray knew in his spirit I should go up for prayer and I went up for prayer and he told me later. I was like, "Praise the Lord." Hallelujah. Amen. Now, the shield of faith. Brother Ram said, "Faith knocks off the darts." [Music] &gt;&gt; Faith. So, Satan shoots powerful fast darts at you. &gt;&gt; Well, I wasn't expecting that. Boom. &gt;&gt; How many you ever had that you're around a sinner, all of a sudden they cuss or they use the Lord's name in vain? It's like boom. Whoa. My I wasn't ready for that one. &gt;&gt; Right. What is it? It's a It's an alert. Get up your shield. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Satan shoots quick uh fiery. In other words, they're powerful uh temptations at you. And you've got to have faith. And faith, the word means assurance. Brother Ram tells us, in other words, it's a revelation of the will of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, a revelation of God's will will stop every fiery dart that shot your way. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The fires of the devil will not touch you. Satan can't burn you because you've got a shield of faith. You've got revelation in God's word. You know the will of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And it just knocks him off. I like his language there. Just knocks him off. &gt;&gt; They had a dart game yesterday right at the at that facility. And you seen You ever seen a dart where it won't stick? That ought to be us. Praise God. When was the last time any play anybody played darts in here? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And you get discouraged because your darts don't hit. That's how the devil feels when his darts don't stick. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Satan shoots darts. He wants it to hit. He wants to hurt you. He wants to bring pain. But church, just raise up the word of God. Just raise up faith. I know what God's word says. I've got assurance in God's word. That can't hit me. That's going to fall off. Satan can't hurt me because God protects me. Hallelujah. And church, I remember, I think we did some history, and their shields were big enough to cover themselves if they just kneel down. There it is. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Kneel down in prayer. &gt;&gt; If they just kneel in prayer, nothing could hit them at all. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why prayer is so important. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If you just kneel in prayer, how is the devil going to get a fiery uh temptation? Whether it's greed or lust or the cares world or anxieties, uh &gt;&gt; depression and fear, all these things, how is that going to hit you if you're kneeling in the promises of God and you've got a protection, a supernatural weapon? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All you have to do is kneel and take cover. Ah, &gt;&gt; can I just say it like this? This ought to be you taking cover in your prayer closet. &gt;&gt; You've seen those memes. I've seen memes where dads are laying with their children reading the Bible on their bed and the dad's got Bibles holding up there and all the darts of devils are getting extinguished right there and the kids are so happy they're reading the Bible and the dad's holding off. He's got the shield of faith. Church, this is the best shield you got. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hold this up and say, "Satan, you can't hurt me because I've already got the promise of God. I'm shielded. I'm protected. I've got a protector. Hallelujah. I've got a provider. I've got God on my side. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And church, it knocks off all all the fiery darts. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; And remember what it said, above all. &gt;&gt; So, the most important thing you can have above all is faith in the word of God. &gt;&gt; True. And that will extinguish all the fiery darts of the wicked. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah, church. &gt;&gt; Any fiery dart that can come your way, you can defeat it if you hide behind the protection of the shield of faith. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It can't hurt you. It extinguishes all the temptations. &gt;&gt; Whether it's sickness, right? Whether it's uh pornography, right? Whether it's drug abuse, whether it's depression, as we said, whether it's resentment, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; a critical spirit, whatever the devil's trying to get at you. Hallelujah. Now remember, brother Ram battled the critical spirit more than everything else, &gt;&gt; right? You can look at his life, you know, uh you look at his life and over the course of his ministry, he battled most the critical spirit like in standing in the gap 63 where he almost left the field because if he said if they won't hear it, they don't have to hear it. &gt;&gt; And he almost moved up in the mountains. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But what did what did the angel remind him of? He said, "You're not an Old Testament prophet. You've been an apostolic prophet with many gifts." Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And so the Lord encouraged him to pick up his Bible. In other words, the Lord encouraged him to pick up his shield and he stopped started blocking all the enemy's attack. I'm not going to leave the bride. I'm going to the bride. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; The angel said, "You go and do that." He said, "Your wife will leave you." Hallelujah. There's going to be consequences if we put down the armor of God. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; God, help us to keep it on. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lastly, number six. Now remember, six is the number of anointed man. Adam was made on the sixth day perfect with the anointing of God. &gt;&gt; Six can be a good number and a bad number. God uses for a good number. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. Little said, "Now you're fortified." Amen. With the word of truth around your loin, preacher, that's what it is. Helmet of salvation, the shield of faith, and the sword waving in your hand. Now look what what it look what it means. Satan, I'm coming to meet you. You meet me in the name of science, in the name of culture or organization. You meet me in the name of this and that the other, but I meet you in the name of the Lord God of Israel. I'm coming after you. Give away. Even death itself can't stand there. Chop a hole right through it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, so when it feels like there's bound or like there's fences or there's mountains before you, right? There's obstacles before you, you got to take the word of God and rebuke Satan. Say, "I'm going through." Amen. &gt;&gt; I've started it with Jesus and I'm going through. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You cut your way through the trial. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get through this. God's going to help me. And remember, the trial, the fiery trials of your faith are more precious than gold. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the fact you got to fight off those fiery darts, it's a fiery testing, right? The fiery trials of your faith, your shield, are more precious than gold. And you take the word of God and you attack Satan with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can everybody see that? By God's grace. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So, you've got to be waving the word in our hands. I'm ready to rebuke Satan. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; See, see, church, when we leave our home or whatever it is, we got to be ready to speak the word of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to fall to this. I'm gonna overcome this. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because I've got the sword of the spirit and it's life and I'm gonna chop my way through this temptation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise. &gt;&gt; Oh my. What a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; In the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, that's the end of my review there. So, hallelujah. How many appreciate those visuals? Amen. &gt;&gt; I thought you might. It's been nine years since I showed them. So, my &gt;&gt; wonderful &gt;&gt; all these years of preaching, it just kind of all blends together if I because I forget. I'm a I'm a man. Now, I want to go a little bit further. Let me go a little bit further by God's grace. Hallelujah. Amen, brother. Thank you, brother. I appreciate everybody's positivity and encouragement. Now, um kind of building on that here, here's where I want to Wednesday, we looked at how, um in order for Satan to wrestle us, we have to compromise. If you don't compromise, there's going to be no wrestling match. &gt;&gt; And we showed some examples of how Brother Brandham compromised, right? Uh the devil said, uh oh, brother Brandham, you can have peace with your mother-in-law as long as you don't go out and preach to the Pentecostals. He's like, okay, I'll take that. I'll take that compromise. And church, look what happened. Flood and death happened. &gt;&gt; So, we never want to compromise with Satan. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's our uh that's our that's our battle too. Don't compromise. He said remember I'll give you Satan say I'll give you a little and I can have a little of your time. &gt;&gt; It's a compromise. But we do not compromise. We don't make any agreements with Satan. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every compromise makes you weaker and weaker. Right now, if you would ac uh Matthew 13:22 again, I ended with this and I want to go back to this here. We've got to stand up against anxiety and riches. This is what Jesus said. So, the this is like a foolish virgin type here. They're growing up, but their life is choked out. They're wrestled. They thrown down and they're choked out. They don't have a word in their mouth, right? They're not getting the life of the oxygen of the word. Their spiritual life is being choked out. Okay. So it's uh it's the cares of this world. Now the word care means anxiety. So remember with all these armor pieces each one can be removed with fear. &gt;&gt; Again like the devil say are you sure you're saved? And you and then if you're if you if you accept that you'll take off your helmet say I don't know if I am saved. &gt;&gt; Right? can uh and whatever fiery dart is shot, you know, uh fear can make you put down. I I don't know if I will get well. I don't know if I I don't know. I don't know if what the doctor says is true or not. We got to take what God says is true. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Doctors Brother said they're good as far as they know. &gt;&gt; But God can give a revelation greater than what the doctor says. &gt;&gt; He's got a word that trumps the doctor's word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the same thing riches riches can be used to loosen our belt a little bit. Well, maybe if I skip this service, I could get a little I could get a little more money. &gt;&gt; That's loosening the belt. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Well, if I just get up a little earlier and don't read my Bible, I could work an extra hour of overtime, but I won't read my Bible. That's the devil. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to get up earlier before your overtime to read the Bible if you want to do that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If not, you'll be choked out and you'll lose the victory of the day. And church, then the thing is, how many days do you stay down? &gt;&gt; How much of the week do we get victory, church? It ought not to be God help us not to just let it be one day. Let's have no days of loss. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can we string together a a week of victories by the grace of God? In other words, where we didn't waste any days where God helped us to stand. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But these two, Jesus points them out specifically. These two have a great impact on believers. &gt;&gt; Anxiety and riches. &gt;&gt; Oh my. God help us. Now, here's what I want to get through. Uh Galatians 5:1. I'm turning a page here. So, let's go to the next thought. Galatians 5:1. Now, I'm looking at the word stand, right? Because either all of us today, we're either standing ready to fight the devil or some of us might even be choked down right now. &gt;&gt; You got to look at you. You might be smiling, might be staring off, you might be sleeping, right? But we're all in one of these conditions. &gt;&gt; We're either standing ready to go fight for the for the Lord Jesus or Satan's got us choked down. &gt;&gt; You're not you're not going to sit. Now, you don't have to say amen. He said you're not going to say amen. &gt;&gt; You're not going to shake Ray's hand after service. Don't even look at brother Jose after service. He did this and Ray did that and Jesse did that. Don't don't even &gt;&gt; Yet everybody might look so happy. &gt;&gt; Got your best clothes on. &gt;&gt; It's iron and everything. &gt;&gt; You actually remembered your deodorant. &gt;&gt; Just silly stuff, you know. I'm just saying like every you can look good from the outside but be losing the battle on the inside. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Choked out with no life, no testimony, no oxygen, no life source. Hallelujah. not living with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Now look what struck the Galatians. Who knows what it was? Legalism. A demon of legalism. Imagine this. went into the church, Brother Ray, and started knocking off all their swords, knocking down all their shields and threw them down, Brother Ray, and was choking them down, saying, "You have to be circumcised in order to be saved as a Christian." Think about that. A Christian church, Brother Malachi. But if you walked in there spiritually, everybody would be laying down, choked out. And Paul's saying, and Paul said in there, "Are you guys even born again?" And he said, "Maybe I got to travail again to make sure you're born again." How can a born again believer get thrown down by Satan and choked out by legalism? &gt;&gt; But church, it happened. And and then he also says they're bewitched by evil spirits because rebellion is as a sin of witchcraft. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; When see people don't understand that when you take a false doctrine, it's actually a witchcraft demonic spirit that's entered in the church. &gt;&gt; And Paul walked in there like, "Man, you guys started off good. You started off with faith, but every one of you is choked down by legalism. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; What's we're Let's read this together. One, two, three. Stand fast, therefore, in the liberty wherewith Christ has made us free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. &gt;&gt; Stand here means to stand firm, to persevere, &gt;&gt; to keep one standing. &gt;&gt; So, they were, think about that, they were supposed to protect the ground of liberty, brother Ray. And that's what we got in the message. &gt;&gt; We're standing here, brother Malagi. And we got we're taking our ground. Hallelujah. This is our fortress. This is our castle. And it's a castle of Christian liberty. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; But Satan wants to come in there and start knocking over and shooting people. And oh, or just knocking over, wrestling them down and making them believe false doctrines of legalism. And then Paul says, if you do that, you're not standing in liberty anymore. You've actually been choked out. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And your entire castle, in this in this case, your entire church is a bunch of choked out weaklings. Can I say it like that? &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Choked out weaklings because of the legalism of circumcision. He says it in verse two. Behold, I I Paul say unto you that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. Verse three, for I testify again to every man that is circumcised that he's a debtor to the whole law. No, I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on this because remember about three years ago I preached a a series on uh good doctrine versus false doctrine and legalism right some right everybody remember okay good &gt;&gt; I don't know if you forgot it's okay if you forgot sometimes I forget too uh yeah oh yeah it's called doctrines of devils now everybody remember &gt;&gt; preach about 20 sermons on doctrines of devils showing what uh false doctrines were and legalism and all the things that go around the message now here's some examples today I believe of legalism. The press, play, and obey movement is definitely legalism. Right, brother Chris? Legalism is your own righteousness apart from the Bible. In other words, you you take your own idea. Well, I'll be holy if I do this, but it's wrong. It's not right in the scripture. &gt;&gt; It's self-righteousness. So, there's a whole group of Christians that say, "We don't need any preachers. I just need somebody to come up here and press play. We all sit down and just watch the words." And there's no living preacher. Oh, &gt;&gt; that's legalism, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's legalism. They've taken away from the word of God. &gt;&gt; I just I just saw the the blog the blog post yesterday. They said, "How can anybody The pastor said, "How can anybody not say uh we're in the perfect will of God by press and play?" Uh I can because Ephesians 4 11 says, "We need pastors, preachers, evangelists, and all these things until we all come in the unity of the faith." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we haven't come there yet. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. How can my question is how can anybody not see that? &gt;&gt; That's because they're not born again. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; So that's one form of legalism. And that's what they say, brother. I don't know if you heard it. They say if you press play, that's the token. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They say if you go to a press play church, that's the token of being a Holy Ghost fil believer. You go to That's just the same as saying you got to speak in tongues &gt;&gt; to know you got the Holy Ghost. It's the same exact thing. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; Same legalism. But Paul said, "Don't fall for that. Stand up against that." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what the pressure is, no matter what the persuasion, no matter who's saying it. It doesn't matter what man says it. It matters what God says. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And think about that. They all bow down to this press play and obey and they choke them down. &gt;&gt; Uhoh. &gt;&gt; You're not going to say Ephesians 4:11 anymore. You're not going to read Romans 10 anymore. Where blessed are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of them who preach the gospel of peace. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; They're choked out to that. &gt;&gt; All they know is press, play, and obey. &gt;&gt; It's legalism. And if we could take a If God could pull back the curtain of time, brother Ray, &gt;&gt; we would look in their church and everybody's being choked out. This devil's like, "I got him. I got him down. I got him down. You get that one. You get that one." &gt;&gt; And the real believer's already ran out the door with the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Or maybe they're on the outside praying for all these people on the inside. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But may God help us. If the curtain was pulled back today, each one of us would be standing warriors saying, "Preach it, brother. Preach it, brother. We're overcomers. We're standing in liberty. We're not going to bow down. We're not going to quit. We're going to stand for this message. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it's your choice. &gt;&gt; Either fight or surrender. &gt;&gt; I'm going to fight the good fight of faith. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Though none go with me, still I will follow. &gt;&gt; No turning back. No turning back. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Another month is they say you can't have drums in the church. Yeah, brother talked about drums and there are good quotes about drums. There's some quotes against drums. Just like there's quotes about tongues and quotes against tongues. &gt;&gt; It's in everything, church. It's going to be a balance that we got to go back to the scripture. And the scripture speaks of drums and percussions, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I preached a series on that, but I'm just giving you some examples. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; If somebody says no drums or no shouting or no rejoic or no screaming, no dancing, they've just knocked off the sword and shield and they got them thrown down choking them out. Hallelujah. That's why I was so blessed. Wednesday, I didn't even remember, Most of you weren't even here. That's okay. You got work and everything. Wednesday, I just started singing, uh, I can sing your love forever. I started dancing all over the church. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; It just struck me like, I'm going to sing of God's love forever. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; And I feel like dancing. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; It's victory, not foolishness. It's victory. I know that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't plan that. It's like God struck my heart. It's like I He's been so good to me. I'm literally going to sing of his love for eternity. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For eternity, Sister Beatress, &gt;&gt; that means there's no end. &gt;&gt; We're going to keep singing a new a new a new chord or a new verse about the love of God. How is that possible? All things are possible with God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But see, they throw him down. and they choke him out. Oh, no drums. Press, play, and obey. The other one, they say, uh, I preached on this numerous times, the you're the greatest of all time. You're the greatest believers of all time. Now, church, if somebody told you again and again, Rey, you're the greatest uh factory worker of all time. Now, the first time you'd be like, brother, I appreciate your kindness, but now for him, he he he'd cast it down every time, right? But for a younger maybe a young believer, if they if somebody says you're the greatest of all time and time again, you start I am pretty good actually. I mean, I guess the more I think about it, I'm good. &gt;&gt; I do go to church. I pay my tithes. &gt;&gt; I dress modestly. I'm think I'm pretty something's pretty special now. I mean, I'm pretty good. But church, that's message preachers that say, "These young people are the greatest young people of all time." How many of them have ever missed a meal by fasting? How many then ever been arrested and put in prison? &gt;&gt; And these preachers today are calling them the greatest of all time. The young, that's just the young people. Then they call their the preachers, these preachers are the greatest preachers of all time. &gt;&gt; The Bible says flattering lips workketh through it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The more people tell you how great you are, if you're not careful, you're going to let that go to your head. &gt;&gt; You're going to loosen up a little bit. Say, "Well, I'm pretty great. I mean, I might as well just I I don't have to pray today. I don't have to read my Bible today. People tell it to me. &gt;&gt; It's one of thems I've seen because nobody can correct you. You think you're so great and and in all real people choke down &gt;&gt; and they can't they can't even say. And church, watch that. When people do that, they don't go fellowship with other people. &gt;&gt; They make themselves were the holy go fellowship with other people. They make themselves we're the holiest. We don't need any fellowship.
