afternoon I keep saying that let's just read a few texts of Scripture here I like to start at revelation 3:21 I've kind of Hana on my heart lately I've just been listening to how can I overcome this week and so I think I'll just going to preach that message so revelation 3:21 like to preach on how can I overcome many times in my ministry you know when I study the prophets messages normally I'll just study thoughts you know and I'll bounce all around here but every now and then you know the Lord will have me just focus on on one sermon so that's what I kind of felt like this week I mowed the grass Monday and I thought Laura what sermon could I listen to and it just kind of came to my heart with how could I overcome so I just been the studying on that all week and listening to that one and so I like to preach that this morning by God's grace revelation 3:21 to overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne now let's go to James 4:7 I'll just take these two scriptures for a Texas this afternoon James for verse 7 let's all read verse 7 we can read that together James 4:7 let's read that on three one two three submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you praise God let's have a word of Prayer everything on your heart just make it known unto the Lord here Heavenly Father we just come reverently this afternoon we're thankful again for your word Lord for this worship that we've been able to experience and give back to you Lord all the praise Lord that you're your do of Lord and we're just happy to give that Lord I pray Lord we read your word now just let your holy spirit have preeminence through my lips Lord and through the ears of the saints O God through their praises and their amens and their hallelujahs as they agree with every word of God we believe Lord let us receive and Lord let us become all that you've called us to become Lord God we're so happy to be called Christians in this hour while we see the world falling apart we see the body of Christ rising up Lord uniting Lord becoming stronger more fervent more sure and Lord that's why we're here to make our calling and election sure that we are the bride of Jesus Christ that we believe every word of God and by your grace will live every word and overcome Satan and every one of his tricks and father we will give you all the glory today as you strengthen us and help us in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless she's been seated praise God praise the Lord I don't have any slideshow today so I'm sorry I just didn't have time for that but like to preach on this thought here with how can I overcome if you'd like to listen to it it's a two-hour message it was preached on August 25th 63 I find it interesting that morning he preaches how can I overcome and then they have a prayer or they have a healing service that evening with perfect faith and these two go together of course how can overcome than perfect faith because you overcome by faith right because faith is the revelation of the will of God so I want to preach a lot of the thoughts right now this message here and I'll be directing you know our thoughts here to the scriptures as well it's interesting also you know this we the week he preached it how can I overcome and then perfect faith and the next week he preached token and desperations which are they're just foundational messages like you you have to know these messages if you're gonna overcome praise God and of course you can't overcome without the token praise the Lord so what a great group a message that seemed like the Lord was just opening things up after the revelation seven seals there you know March and then a few months later here five months later the Prophet is just pouring out these revelations and that's what is that's what his last commission was right the opening of the word praise God the the third pole so this is part of the third pole this is how we're over comers praise the Lord by the word of God so I won't just wanted to start off with that thought with those scriptures and I want to just go through a few more so in our text was revelation 3:21 and it offers everyone the reward if you are an overcomer we all get the same reward we get to sit with Christ in the throne and brother man makes a statement where even says he says this is in his throne he says in his domain of the kingdom so a lot of us picture you know just we're sitting on a throne but brother man takes it further than that okay we know we will be with Christ in the on the throne we know there must be a very large throne praise God we know at the white throne judgment we'll sit with him in the throne but the Prophet takes us to a greater application he says this means in the throne he says which means also in the domain so the territory of of Christ and he said so with a church be with him in the entire domain he said the boundaries that Christ has given the bride from eternity to eternity in other words once time ends he said will be with him in his domain and then will be with him in his domain for all eternity praise God without end amen so this means more than just sitting one time on a throne like if you one time got to visit the White House you know that's the best way we could see it oh well I got my picture taken with President Obama or President Trump or whoever it is you know you are in the office or you might have been there in the office but this goes beyond that this goes throughout all Christ's entire domain all of eternity praise God so it talks about not just a one-time meeting with Christ but just being with him as the bride amen so that's the opening Scripture and it's all for all overcomers and i want to remind everybody that that the the opportunity and the tools to overcome is freely given to everyone remember jesus said whosoever will let him come and drink of the waters of life so the only thing that's required to be an overcomer is drinking amen right coming to Christ and drinking of the waters of life there in fact there's there's numerous symbols you can give to it that's one of the symbols one of the symbols is you know leaving leaving your slavery right as the the Liberty you know as the Liberty tells us you know the day of Liberty the Day of Atonement you know you're the trumpet sounds and we're set free and and as slaves we can leave our slavery and we can leave that behind and we can come to the waters of life and drink from the waters of life amen that's one symbol praise God but in our in the Bible we're given other symbols praise God we're given the symbol of a warrior in an Ephesians so let's goes back there a very familiar scripture so one symbol is a thirsty a thirsty Saint who's thirsty for living waters that's one symbol all you have to do to overcome is just leave the the sinfulness of the world and come and drink of the pure waters of life another symbol is you must stand like a warrior how many warriors we have in here this afternoon praise God and I just love the the illustration here the Bible gives us a verse ten fusions 610 finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of his might now a lot of people are strong today and money praise God a lot of people are strong today with words right with attitudes they got a strong attitude right a lot of people are strong with their their sports team they're strong in that they really know their team really well right a lot of people are strong with arrogance and pride I'll tell you this this is a real sad story but I'll just tell you how how much the Lord has been dealing with me on this I was teaching Thursday at Bible Club and and one of the girls there was a and I was teaching him I'll have you have to love your family and one of the girls there was adopted by her grandmother and I was showing how Jesus said whoever receives a child in my name receives me so saying anyone that will adopt a child and receive them in the name of Jesus they've received Jesus in other words they have the Spirit of Christ amen and and they pointed out to me the kids went out to me oh this third-grade girl her grandma's here and and she's adopted or nice and I looked at the grandma I said praise the Lord grandma and I said have you two and I'll use the scripture and I said are you doing this for your glory or Jesus's glory and I was trying to get her to say it was for Jesus but here's here's her heart heart I listen it was really sad because it's in front of like 80 kids and you know there's some adults there and I said I just felt led to do I said whose glory are you doing this for your glory or for Jesus glory and she said my glory and she stood there like this like I thought mine it's kind of smiled in front of all these people only I said well okay and so then I read I read another scripture where it said if you receive them in my name and I just felt lad I kind of turned back and said I said grandmother I said but do you receive her and your name or in the name of Christ and she said in the name of Christ and she finally bowed her head and humbled herself but I thought isn't that striking this woman was so mad with and I know the situation that's why I can say this this this mother was this grandmother was so upset with her son her son got arrested for drugs and now and he's in jail and now she has to take care of the daughter but she's so filled with pride that she's that she's taking the daughter for her glory and the presence of all those witnesses she says it's for her glory and see how people wanna they wanna they want to be strong and that's her being strong in herself in other words she's she's saying I'm strong I'm doing this for my glory now thankfully she said at the end it was in the name of Jesus but I don't know I told that I told the friends here we got to pray for this woman amen I got to pray for this woman but see that's an example we got to be strong in the Lord here's an example of a grandmother who's trying to do it brother amen in her own strength but we can't do it in our own strength we can't do anything in our own strength we've got to do everything we do with the strength of Christ in other words you got to go to work you've got a you got to be a husband you've got to be a wife you've got to be a mother father a grandfather grandmother you've got to do that in the strength of Christ amen because the Bible said soldiers of God overcomers of God are strong in the Lord if you and I feel insufficient not obviously she feels insufficient to be a grandmother of her own strength right she feeling but see we know if we feel insufficient about our ability we've got to learn to stop leaning upon our own strength and we've got to be strong in the Lord amen so see you know this example the month the grandmother is trying to overcome with her own strength and she's upset but see you can't you can't serve God by your pride you can't serve even God by fear you can't you can't serve God by your own ability we've all got to accept the power of God and we to overcome and be strong in the Lord and the power of his might that's just I wasn't in my notes but I just kind of came to me just now so I thought I'd share that see be strong in the Lord and the power of his own might verse 11 put on the whole armour of God that ye may able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand now Paul would not just be riding this two foolish virgin Paul's riding this to the wise virgin Paul's riding this two born-again Saints and it gives us the picture of soldiers that the and the imagery here is that a soldier who's born again an overcomer is somebody that will stand and fight and their main objective is just to remain standing if they fall they're going to lose but the imagery here's of a soldier that he stays on his feet and he's willing to stand there and overcome and he does it by the power of his armor amen hallelujah and then the Bible describes the armor is any of the armor your ability Church no youryour breastplate is Christ's righteousness not your own praise God your helmet is not your victory it's Christ's salvation in your life amen all these things that it's not your sword in your hand it's the sword of the word amen so nothing so the imagery one imagery is a thirsty a very thirsty person who goes to the fountain praise God they leave their sinful world behind here's another imagery of an overcomer they have to take on the whole armor of God and they've got to stand against Satan and take on the full armor and then the Bible said in verse 16 above all taking the shield of faith wherefore wherewith you may be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God now let me just make a few points on verse 16 the shield of faith and it it blocks every Dart every lie so as Satan shoots at you he's sending fiery darts of Lies and I know about you but whenever I hear something a lie my heart starts beating a lot harder right when you hear a false doctrine or you hear bad news about somebody or you're attempted or even like a temptation will come many times you know our heart start beating a little faster because we know of fiery darts on the way but the Bible says that if we hold up the shield of faith and faith is a revelation if we hold up a shield of faith and the Bible said faith will extinguish every fiery dart praise God in other words when we have a mime and this this means in our minds we're battling is this true should I believe this should I pass this on or not should I accept this should I meditate on this or not we the way to overcome in our mind is to remember what the Word of God says it's by remembering God's Word quoting God's Word believing God's Word and God's Word when you settle down and really believe it and take the word of God instead of the fiery dart it will quench the fire it will make the the temptation leave you'll overcome by the truth that was preached to you the truth you read in your Bible and you will be an overcomer amen hallelujah so this the shield represents the Battle of the mind amen you've got it and we've got to go back and remember no the Bible says this is Satan's lying say one thing in this ear we've got to remember and say the Bible says this praise God the Bible says this this is what faith tells me this is what I've been taught in the scripture this is what God has shown me and by this I'll overcome amen hallelujah verse 17 the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God so see there's more intense battles when just the shield of faith won't do it you ever think of that sometimes it feels like how many know like sometimes it seems like the battles you know Satan's far and he's just shooting arrows from afar off in other words the battle feels like well I just got a black these and then I can that can relax a little bit and that's true there are some battles like that but then there's battles where just the the enemy's so near that just the shield won't drive him away right it's not like the enemy's way far off it's like the enemy has come to close quarters and now just believing and just and that's gonna do good but it's gonna take more than that the enemy's so near we've got to drive him back with the Word of God see I think we experience that some battles it seems like the end up that the evil is so much closer than another times sometimes if you like evils knocking right on the door amen sometimes Church the evil is right in the church service sometimes the demons are right here trying to get in people's minds and get them to leave church or something like that right that's how close they feel or sometimes it's so close it's a sickness in your body amen and it's not way far off but it's a it's a sickness right in your body and so when it's that close we've got to take out the Word of God and we've got to fight against that because the enemy is so near and we've got to stand and remember that the weapons that we have are powerful and effective amen God wouldn't give us weapons that wouldn't work or we wouldn't give us weapons that would fail he give us weapons that are great conquering weapons that are very effective they're very strong and we've got to be overcomers and used the weapons that God has given to us hey man hallelujah so this is the the second imagery here the first one's a thirsty beggar who just wants water and they overcome by leaving the things of the world and going to the fountain here the warrior is strong in the Lord and he's got all the armor on he's got the shield of faith the revelations of God word and he's got the Word of God quoting amen now let's go to another one here let's go back to James for in our text James 4:7 this is the groundwork or say the foundational scriptures and brother bear mentions these scriptures of course in the sermon James 4:7 but let's read verse 6 because we got it we have to overcome our pride as well how many can say amen to that sometimes we get prideful we think we can do it on our own well God got to resist us in those those times verse 6 but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resists the proud but he gives grace unto the humble remember Paul said I'm laboured more because the grace that was with me that means Paul was a very humble person and of course God helped him be humble because he game that I trouble right off and on he'd have that I trouble sometimes he get healed sometimes he get sick again so God was using that to keep him humble but God resists the proud and he gives grace to the humble verse 7 submit yourselves therefore to God now that means obey that means to surrender we have to obey and surrender God's Word and then the Bible said that's resisting the devil and he will flee from you see that picture there so the picture is sometimes here you know the enemy's far away and just blocking you know the the fiery darts of lies but then there's times where Satan and the demons come so close that we got to be able to fight him one-on-one oh but really even if there's one of them it's never really one on one it's one on two amen hallelujah because it's not just me and you because greater is He that's in you then he that's in the world amen it's never one-on-one praise God unless you want to try to fight him with your own mind amen or your own ability because he resists that but see he'll fight with you it's really never one-on-one because God said I'll never leave you nor forsake you amen because you're his children and he loves you he wouldn't do that and of course he wants you to learn how to fight and he does teach us but he never leaves us amen because the Bible said resist the devil he'll flee so like we know it Jesus will get to that you know maybe next week by God's grace but Jesus when he fought Satan he fought so hard for three major assaults program calls that made assaults and then finally after a third time Satan left for a season right and that's and that's what I was mentioning earlier some of these fights are gonna feel like my it's just this is an intense spiritual battle this is a harder battle than other times and we've got to recognize that and we got to be able to quote the Word of God and obey the Word of God submit to God in those hours and keep fighting until the enemy has to flee praise the Lord and this is spiritual warfare we'd say right this is the overcomer this is how can I overcome now a great summary is in John the Gospel of John chapter 1 verse 12 and 13 a great summary this is a beautiful summary here and this works when you get born again but it also works as you receive revelation John 1:12 and 13 john 1:12 but as many as received him now notice the order here as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born now here's where it speaks to the new birth not of blood nor the will of flesh nor of the will of man but of God praise God so this goes back to your predestination God foreknew that you would love righteousness and you would surrender your free more agency to him so he called you and elected and then God ordains the time and place and season where you live and then he ordained your birth day men natural and spiritual praise God but notice the the order this is beautiful when you receive him then he gives you power to become amen so receive and then you become so I kind of look at like this you believe you receive and then you become praise God you believe it right you believe the gospel you got saved you got baptized you received him praise God you receive more of the word and then you become the word amen hallelujah you got to believe it first you got to repent and believe it then you start receiving more of the promises of God and then you become a real warrior a real overcomer amen and the overcomer is one who's born again hallelujah praise God so I want to lay that in now all these scriptures together revelation 3:21 Ephesians 6 James 4:7 and John 1 if you place many of these if you place all these together you get the groundwork for an overcomer this is the foundation of how you overcome you've got to stand and resist him and there's times you have to quote the Word of God to drive him back and if you do that you'll remain standing for the faith praise God you won't fall away you'll stand for the faith amen and you'll be an overcomer because you're born again oh thank the Lord amen I remember brother and said Jesus was tempted above any man that could ever be tempted brother am says that so we know that Jesus in his temptation in Matthew 4 we're not going to go there yet but that was the greatest temptation could ever be on a man because Jesus had all the power and Satan tempted him to use his power Jesus had all the authority he was going to get it but Satan tried to tempt him and take it early before it was God's time and that's a great temptation for you and I isn't it how many know that the Holy Ghost is a spirit of adoption I mean know that and how many how many want to be adopted where we're like well Bram says your name on the check is as good of the father's in other words how many people want to see God do miracles through them how many people want to see the Holy Spirit surged through them and do great things see we all want that right we all want that I want it we all want that but see we gotta learn to wait on that for God's timing so see that great temptation where Satan says throw yourself down the Angels will bear you up he's quoting a psalms right he's quoting the word we'll see jesus had the character to know that I don't do what Satan wants me to do when Satan wants me to do it I do what God wants me to do when God wants me to do it and church that's what we're talking about for us that's the the great lessons we can learn from we all know there's going to be a rapture amen we all know the bride is going to be without spot or blemish we all know there's going to be a meeting in the air we all know there's a latter in coming and it's tough saith the Lord but we gotta wait and patiently and be in the right position and grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord and let the spirit of adoption teach us and train us so that we don't get ahead of God but we stay in - with the Holy Spirit amen hallelujah because we've all seen this people jump in trying to make make guesses about when the rapture is gonna happen some said 2006 I remember that some said 2015 some said 2018 19 see what are they trying to do they're getting they're letting Satan tempt them to try to make something happen about the rapture to realize that every time they predict and make a prediction they're trying to scare people to get them ready we don't need someone to scare us ready we need the Holy Spirit to help us love and love God and be so close to God that Jesus gets us ready amen I don't need a man to get me to get ready I need Christ to make me ready see that's what that is all that is is a modern satanic temptation where toss yourself down from from the pinnacle the modern form of that is predict the rapture try to make yourself something like your supernatural try to make it happen and church none of us are gonna make it happen it's Christ that's gonna make it happen amen now let's look now I want to go right to some direct quotes here from this sermon is such a wonderful sermon if you haven't listened to a while I want you to listen to it if you get a chance how can I overcome because it's a real blessing now I want to start with this brother Ram starts the sermon by mentioning the Laodicean Church age because his tax is revelation 3:21 about sitting in the throne over comers now he says this he makes a point he says he said Laodicea needed a rebuke they were indifferent towards Christ and he said that was Christ's love christ was put out of the church but his love brought him back knocking trying to get back in so program notices Jesus is great love its Jesus's Church but the churches kicked him out right and now he's trying to get back in can you imagine if your spouse kicked you out of the house but then you and love you know come knock back and say can I come back in uh what uh what a great one of amount of love that would be if you're kicked out and scorned and they don't like you but then you come back and say honey can I get back in please I love you let me in let's talk this over that's love brother Ram says now notice he says Jesus said he that overcometh and program says notice not she that overcometh but he that overcometh and brother sambara has noticed this he's not calling the entire church back all the denominations and things he's calling individuals amen he that overcometh so see this is this is not going to be a worldwide revival like all the denominations think and all the all the mega churches think where they're predicting billions of people being saved and and all that a return of America to Christ we know that's not gonna happen because jesus said he that overcometh right open the door I'm knocking on his heart and my man said it's the individual it's not the group and church if we if we're sensitive to the Holy Spirit we can hear Christ calling our voice our individual name amen he's calling our name and so we got to respond in other words we don't wait for other people to respond and I hope that's your attitude as you as we learn to come to churches and love God more faithfully in the years and months to come of God Terry's that we don't wait for others to move that we can be sensitive enough to be led by the Holy Spirit that we can be moved and hear Christ calling our voice that's what I was guilty of for many years in denominations I wait so other people felt letting the Holy Spirit to go up to the altar or wait for other people I said well if this just happened then I'll get saved that was the wrong attitude the right attitude is when I hear his voice I will not harden my heart amen today if you hear his voice harden not your heart Amen but learn to respond to the individual call that's what the overcomer does the overcomer doesn't wait for other people the overcomer hears the voice and responds to Christ's voice now the next thought is he takes this this idea of Dodi so if you've heard the word Dodi LaRon takes about ten minutes and he he mentions how this church age is dou T it means rotten it means rotten doubt it means weak and lacking life and he says I've heard it say that so many times that God is a good God he said but they say it so much that God is like a Dodi grandfather and lets his grandchildren do whatever they want and never corrects him he said God is a father but he's a father of righteousness and love is corrective but I've said a real mother corrects her children a real father corrects their children amen but Ram said what made him think of this Dodi thought about Laodicea he was down in a holler or like a valley in the woods and he was gonna cross a stream and he jumped on the log he said it looked good but he stepped on it and then a big chunk broke off and he said that's the way a lot of Christians are becoming he said they're dead in sins and trespasses they can hold no weight at all think about this can you hold the armour of God amen without getting weak amen they can hold no weight at all overcome means to keep life in you he said it made that log worse than ever to be in the water because it wasn't attached to life amen so because it wasn't attached to life it rotted out and they got weak and old and don't and it couldn't hold forth anyway now say like this it wouldn't bring forth any fruit amen he said like Christians can get rejoiced one day but then get dhoti he said Christians should live constantly in the life of Christ he said if you lay around and know the things you're supposed to do and don't do it it's sin he said don't lay around and get dodi or rotten now let's pour plenty Paul I'm sorry okay no Lidia I forget which ones back there James 4:17 pull this one up here here's the scripture that he quotes now when he says this he says James 4:17 he says therefore to him that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin now here's the trouble with the message with with our humanity we hear so much truth we hear more truth than any other churches in the world I believe that with all my heart because no other churches go as deep in the Word of God as church as our churches do and that's because God sent us a prophet I know I was raised in a better culture Church and we never even scratch the surface of what I preach now never not even close and we're not saying that pridefully but that's just how it is because you can't understand the mysteries of God unless God sends you a prophet and that to reject the prophet is to reject the deepness of the revelation but see we hear so much and let me just give some examples about paying our tithes right about coming to church about worshiping God about reading our Bibles and having a prayer life and seeking God and fasting and praying I preach so much on those and every preacher should let's see if we know that we're not doing it and we should do it it actually turns into sin because we have to live the word that we know and when we live the word that we know it gives us life but if we reject the word that we know and don't do the word that we know then it comes a sin to us and we start dying away from our first love praise God brother have said strive with all that's in you to stay in the life of Christ to be fruit-bearing at church you and brother man says you and I all have this we all have this thing inside of our heart that gets thirsty that long that hungers for life and we all can know when we feel like we're dying right Church like this morning you know whether you feel like you're growing and more the life of God or you know if you felt like you've been dying this week I don't have to tell you if I have to tell you then you're really spiritually blind amen but if you love God and God's in your heart you should know do you feel live like you're growing in life or do you feel like you're falling away because you can't say the same we're either attached to the life of God over a not attached the life of God and so see we've got too long and strive to stay in the life of God now what I'm talking about here is not the soul if you're born if you're born again then we know that you're sealed to the day of your Redemption I'm talking about in your human mind if we give our thinking more to the things of the world and we don't have fiery darts and we feel weak and we feel bloodied and we feel a wounded and we don't feel strong in the faith we feel like we're wounded Christians right but we've got to be able to let the balm of the Holy Spirit be applied to our wounds confess our faults draw near to God get healed and start living again in our mind amen hallelujah that's right church that's right hallelujah because we're all guilty of times of laying around and not doing what we should do for Greece praise God I don't think I'm the only one that ever feels like oh I'm not living as close to God as I should I need to live closer to God see we have to feel that and this is the idea he starts with this later see in church Aegeus dodi it gets weak it can't handle the call of God it lays around and doesn't do anything the Bible said we if we abide in his word and bite in Christ then he said ask what you will and it shall be done uh-huh praise God what a blessing for us amen if we stay attached in the life of God so remember that James 4:17 to him that know what to do good and doeth and not to him it's sin praise God now he says Laodicea is a great age because we're so close to the Millenium in other words this age time will cease soon for this age you know we'll go from man's day to the Lord's Day we know that and after the judgments that will break into the Millennium but he also says it's a great age for sin Christians in the past ages had to be beheaded just for claiming to be a Christian right but now the enemy comes in the name of Jesus before to name the name of Jesus you get killed but now the enemy comes in the name of Jesus but Jesus said thank God in Matthew 24:24 it would deceive the very elect if it were possible that's a big if and that means the elected a men but RAM says see people today they can live above smoking and gambling and drinking and adultery and still not be an overcomer because they've got a religious spirit right and they can live over those they can live above those things and still not be an overcomer still not living all the Word of God that's right praise the Lord a brother makes a great statement here I like this this was a really good thought I hadn't really thought about program said and never in any age was the baptism of the Holy Ghost available like it is today with all the revelation that we have think about that the seven seals marriage and divorce the church ages we know all these mysteries the twelve mysteries we know the mysteries he said never before was it made known but it's so it's so sad that in the day in the age when everything is made known this is the age when Christ is kicked out of the church because they don't agree with the word that's been amen well they said they'll call it telepathy so obviously he's referring to his ministry the very ministry that could make them an overcomer they talked evil of it and they say telepathy or like my friends will say well he's a false prophet or he's not a prophet he was a good man but he had to get the healing but not a prophet oh if only they'd read the Word of God amen when they'd pray and get the spirit of revelation and see that but see in the very age when Christ is available to come in fully they kick him out so we know it's going to be a battle Satan's going to battle us Church to try not to let Christ come in all the way but we got a flow or we got to fling open every door and say Jesus come in we've got to separate ourselves from anything in the world and we got open every window let Jesus come in you got to open every door not Jesus come in we got to let Jesus fully come into our lives and this church amen say Lord whatever you'd want me to do have your way whatever my calling in life is whatever my purpose is and that's why we're doing those special meetings so we'll take some specific time to set aside to pray and seek God and hear the word and ask God to show us our specific purposes so that we can know what God wants us to do that's all my heart and I find it that when we pray and fast that's when our the hand the Lord the Bible says upon us now it can be other times of course we know that like bro BAM said he would pray in fast he would fast like uh he said like a Friday Saturday and then like have it like a little if the service was on Sunday he would fast Friday and then take a little bit on Saturday so we had a little strapped ranked and then eat a little bit on Sunday so just to give you an idea how he would fast if he was preaching and he needed some physical strength to take on the missions and do the prayer line he would fast a couple days in the week and he said he said Friday's my fast day team ever that were those day he said Friday's my fast day if he's got to preach on Sunday and he's got to see visions he wouldn't eat Friday but then Saturday he have a little bit of meal here a little sandwich something really liked she had enough strength now if he had to do that to serve his purpose in life what about you and I church Oh what about you and I we got to be willing to sacrifice remember the core - oh brother bear said not so much your money you got to be able to sacrifice your time if we want to see God working in our lives and find our purpose in life we got to be willing to sacrifice a little more praise God hallelujah this is the age when Christ wants to come in fully not so the Prophet said the Holy Spirit is rebuking this age that put Christ out of the church so how can I overcome he starts with this age this age it needs a rebuke from the Lord amen Jesus rebukes the aged and then the Prophet goes into this thought he injects his thought he said a minister asked him a question he said how can you put the bride in the rapture before the tribulation program said I like this man he wasn't a pushover who has to agree with everything you say praise God look around like this man because you just didn't believe everything he said like a lot of people say well I believe everything brother Bram said right now you should say everything the Bible says I believe it and we should say yes we believe almost everything brother Branham said but not his own human thoughts that maybe aren't in the Bible right everything brother Graham preached from the word we believe it but if it's just his thoughts you know some things that maybe turn out later just beyond his own opinions well then we don't believe every word like that that's the balance of being a Holy Ghost field Christian you rightly divide the word of God but better him said like a man like that who's not a pushover and has to agree with everything you say he said I believe the bride does not need to go through the tribulation because she's already purified before the rapture and he quotes John 5:24 let's read that liddie can you pull up John I'm sorry Casey can you vote it boy you're switching on me okay make us you're on paying attention John 5:24 so brother him quotes the scripture to show that the bride is already purified and forgiven before the rapture verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation see there's no judgment but has passed from death unto life leave that up there at little for a bit a little bit acacia see sir program says the the bride does not need to go through the tribulation to be purified she's already purified she's not under condemnation she's not living in the death of the sin she's got eternal life amen she's born again she has no condemnation through the blood of Jesus Christ and the man says well then brother Ram give me a type of it give me a type now go to Matthew 27:51 acacia but ma'am said sure I'll be happy to give you time he said everything has to tight because the Bible says the law was a shadow of things to come everything has a type anything we believe should have a type Matthew 27:51 program says see the Old Testament ended when the veil was torn because the veil kept people out from the holiest of holies but when God ripped the veil from top to bottom God was saying brother Jesse you come on in amen you same van come on in it's open to you hallelujah the veil sword come on in not stay out stay out stay out he said but come right on in amen that's what he was saying so the New Testament started right there when the sin debt was paid and man's welcomed in the presence of God amen the old the veil of the temple was rent in twain from top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent verse 52 here it is right here so here's our program says I'm proving that the bride doesn't have to go through the tribulation but this man is like well the Bible says the righteous have to go through tribulation and the man's right but he's referring to the foolish virgin not the bride Amen so this is our brother improves it and this is how I proved it on the video the last video made was wise and foolish merchants I don't know if you saw it but I go through all down through the whole Bible you can show you can show why some Lewis version in every age every age has 'm and this is proof and this is where the Holy Spirit directed me when I wrote that script out and the graves were open and all of them know all the Old Testament Saints resurrected know many of them not all of them why not all of them because all were not ready for the resurrection amen now all of them brother bang met God's requirement for the resurrection sea but we can meet it by being justified sanctified and baptized with the Holy Ghost we can meet God's requirements for the resurrection amen hey man see many not all many of the bodies the Saints which arose so we know job was there right job said I know my redeemer lives and I'll see him in this body though the the worms eat this flesh yet in this flesh I shall see God amen he knew the worms are you gonna eat his skin but then that's the ground without to give that up again a man in this flesh I shall see God Abraham had to be there praise God Daniel had to be there because Daniel Daniel wrote about it the Bible said that Daniel he said to us let's read it Daniel 1213 Keysha praise God 12:13 this one belle reve says better and said Daniel made it there see because we all have a lot huh me know that we all have a lot in life you're either standing in one of four lots and that's all about this parking lot that's where you parked but that's not the lot I'm talking about here there's a lot of the wise virgin or the foolish virgin or the make believer or the unbeliever thank God we can stand in the save lot amen and if we are born again then we are in the wise lot a man not the foolish lot Lydia Sarkissian bored up there Daniel 12 13 when you get a chance so this is what brother Branham quotes he said Daniel was there Daniel was an overcomer in his day hey man and how do you overcome Church by the blood and by his prayer life he said I'm not eating that Kings meat I'm not eating that contaminated food am i I'm going to live holy and separate even though it's available to me even though all these luxuries are available I'll turn them down because they'll defile my faith and we've got to turn down certain luxuries in life in order not to have our faith defiled like but like one man says is like TV like cable right that's something we could have but it's wiser to turn it down I'm not saying you couldn't have it but I'm saying it's wise to turn it down and turn and stay away from it it's a luxury you could have but everybody I everybody I see that gets it falls away why is that the case amen why is that the case best even every person I see that I've seen coat of this church and get cable in their home they fall away everyone yeah everyone now some of them still hang around the churches but their lives don't look wholly like they ought to and they fall away out of their service for God and they stop doing things they used to they stop living the Holy Light they ought to but most of them actually just fall down a church all together I'll name him T if you want not now about names you later her now look he said but go thy way to the end be for thou shalt rest I like that he's resting Abraham's bosom oh he didn't have to be in the heat of the the flames he was just rest in there in the bosom and you look he'll stand in thy lot at the end of days program said this is Daniel Daniel was resurrected after Jesus resurrected he was one of those Saints that lived the four Word of God he was sincere he was an overcomer and so he got the stand with Jesus on the earth and that day hallelujah some of our majors on this many of the Saints rose not all Siebel never said the Old Testament group who made the sacrifices he said some of them made them but he said they actually had to make them in sincerity and church that's the thing today we got to come to church with sincere hearts if something is said from the preaching and we're not living it we need to sincerely repent and say God help me to overcome that's sincerity right sincerity is not just hearing it say well one day I'll get the victory okay what are we gonna do today what your plans for today your plans ought to be to hear what God says and obey what God says Amen that ought to be my plan that'll be your plan to be overcomers and to let god's spirit have its way in our lives well RAM said Daniel he says Daniel this is the quote was the bride type of Israel the bride type in other words in Israel there was a bride and then there was a foolish virgin and Daniel was the wise version type that's what he says he said those that are really loving and living for Jesus is coming not all Israel but the bride type of Israel thank the Lord see bo-ram said when Jesus rose from the dead he says when Jesus appears in the sky the church the dead in Christ shall rise and those will all be changed in a moment the rest of them will know nothing about it so see everybody else from the foolish version every else will miss the rapture remember he said appear to those in the city so he's going back to Jesus resurrection see the sure we'll be like that we'll see each other and we'll see them the rest of the world won't see them it'll be caught away as a secret going waiting for that time then returning back to the earth for that glorious millennium then the thousand years the rest of the Dead lived not for a thousand years praise God amen now I hope that was a blessing that's a thought he labored on I want to bring that thought to you just to prove it there by the scripture the Old Testament Saints that Rose is the type the Old Testament type of the wise and foolish virgin I want everybody to see that there because he labored on that when people came a gun against him and said no the the church has to go through tribulation he said let's go back to the type Amen see some are more sincere than others so Church let's check our sincerity today you got enough sincerity to come to church at a time you don't come to me regularly don't regularly come to church that's the good sincerity but let's now next brother Ram goes through how long a member you give me 15 minutes here yeah he goes through numerous examples I'll just go through a couple and then I got two quotes I want to close with here give me about 15 more minutes well Ram said God has always had over comers he's never been without a witness someone has overcome in every age and RAM starts you know the first one he starts with is Noah does that surprise you Noah he said because Jesus type Noah's day to our day remember Luke 17 let's read it for anyone unfamiliar that go Luke 17 and then in case you can put up there I'll leave its 28th Luke 17 28 I want to give everybody a chance to see that 26 I'm sorry I was one a couple only Luke 17:26 and that's why you know how many seen that noah's ark in kentucky or have you've seen that noah's ark in kentucky okay hands up that's why that thing is so prophetic because it's in america and the mark of the beast comes out of america praise God and Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah verse 26 as the one days of Noah so shall be in the days of the coming of the Son of Man and where the Son of man visit brother Jose he was born in Kentucky amen right Ehsan a man brother Ram was born to manifest the Son of Man Jesus amen the gift of discernment right the Messiah sign they'll say the Lord the last sign of the Gentiles came in America so they have Noah's Ark only in America so in place it could be done with all the millions of dollars and the and the religious background that America has this only place that would do it China wouldn't do it Africa when to it Israel wouldn't do it it had to be done in America because America is the one that brings forth the mark of the beast cuz she's the Beast out of the land and she speaks with the power of the first beast which was Imperial pagan Rome see it has to be in America he said in Noah's time Jesus referred to it as it was the days of Noah so shall be the days of the son son of man now notice verse 27 they didn't eat they drank they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all a church we all do this right we all eat how am I gonna eat today how many gonna drink how many got married or want to get married someday see you got you little ones can put up your hands yeah see those girls really want to get married amen hey I didn't do I when I first came to the message I said Lord I want the rapture to come but let me get married first and God was merciful to me gave me about wonderful beautiful life there see so there's nothing wrong with that brother Graham got married twice yes well first wife died so you could get married again you know those things see those things will never become an idol to the believer but Jesus trying to say the world got caught up on those things they forgot about the gathering at the arc amen they forgot that the righteous ones if you want to be saved you've got to be in the ark amen it's okay to get married it's okay to eat and drink it's okay to to Google that life but when the spear says get in the Ark we better get in the Ark amen that's what they're saying that's what Christ is saying here they got so distracted with the things of the world they miss coming in the ark because it was open to everybody so is it today everybody can go in the rapture who wants to but only the elect will go I read that quote where was it last Sunday I finished the service with that quote brother man said it's your free more agency he said if any man wishes to go in the rapture they can go right because God is not going to turn God's not gonna force anybody that doesn't want to go to go in the rapture he's not gonna do that so he's only gonna let people go in the rapture who want to go in the rapture well that's the great balance isn't it with free more agency and predestination he said in the days the end to lubing world perhaps mins of people there was only I love this he says eight overcomers so brother man takes the middle portion of this sermon and he shows how there was only a small number of overcomers in every age he starts with eight in the days of Noah now look what he says many of them had good intentions said someday if things happen we'll go in the ark with brother Noah cuz he's a fine fella isn't that what they say today oh and the rapture gets close then we'll get the Holy Ghost like brother so-and-so or sister so-and-so oh one day we know what it's when I really feel God moving then I'll get the Holy Ghost and I really come down the altar and seek God no you better see God today don't put it off Oh someday I'll be more faithful like sister so-and-so or brother so-and-so let's not put it off let's get all of God that we can get today praise God see many of them he said had good intentions he says if you are laying around getting Dodi get in the Ark hurry quick because the door might close at any time and Eminem said there was always an ark in God's economy every time there was an ark he said a Noah sign in last time now this time there's an ark now he said it's not a denomination he said the Ark is in Romans 8:1 let's read that all you Ark people because the Ark is not in Kentucky the Ark is right here and then the Ark is wherever Christ is amen Romans 8:1 let's see the ark could leave us I'm gonna get Amen on that the ark will leave this church if we reject the ark it leaves any Church that rejects it we've got to welcome the Holy Spirit say let the Holy Spirit come in let God have his way let sinners repent lets sanctified ones repent and get filled let the Holy Ghost have his free way amen we've got to say that or else the Ark will leave it'll sail away to some other church that's hungry for God we can't get Dodi we can't lay around and do nothing we got to find what God wants us to do and do it for his glory Romans 8:1 tells the ark did you know this I didn't even know this ty listen this this week the ark was in Romans 8:1 I didn't even know it there is therefore now no condemnation that are in the ark glory and the Church said there's no condemnation and Noah because he was in the ark there's no condemnation of Moses because he was in the ark amen other words he was found the pillar of fire see there's no condemnation relations to them that are in the ark were all baptized into one body in one domain of that kingdom one spirit baptism he said through them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit there's our Ark today being led by the Holy Spirit praise God he said that's the only way you overcome it's all that is under the shed blood as overcomers because you cannot overcome yourself it is he that overcomes for you you're resting kind like Daniel you're resting and he's overcoming for you Manderson how will I know then brother bran that I'm in there I'm in the arc watch what kind of life you're living just look around see if it's lived out of you automatically or do you have to strain and pull see then you're doing it but you don't try to do it did you ever try yeah now love this now this some of you mothers alike and every time I dressed my children sister Naomi I think about this quote right here I got to put clothes like this morning out to put Genevieve in her clothes but Ram said Moran said this living a Christian life is like putting a shirt on a baby so next time you want to say God I want to be led by the Holy Spirit say god help me help me to let you put my arm through the shirt holes how many want to be sure whole Christians praise God I do well they said it's just like putting a little baby's arm in a sleep hole he's just up and down and over Jenna he does that to me all the time I'll try to get her arm into sleeve and she'll push out like she'll push out through the neck part she's like I got my shirt on I got my shirt out I'm like no you know I'm thinking brother branham's quote I'm thinking just yield to me now yield to me she's like oh the babies how they flex it they're like okay it's out and they're flexing they won't move their arm Mike honey you got to yield to me yield and that's what the Holy Spirit saying today yield to me Saints do what I want you to do obey me listen to the word you to me and I'll use you amen see he can't do it put on your coat honey ever tried to put a coat on one of those children and they just won't put their arm in the sleeve he can't do it the little arm is up and down and all around it takes your steady hand oh how glad I am I can just yield my hand to father and say Lord Jesus I can't get it in there you help me put the coat on me I quit trying praise God just let him do it now take this back to our scripture the Bible said submit yourselves to God what does the baby have to do I wish she wouldn't fight me so much but she does all she has to do is submit to God and God will take her hand and push it right in that sleeve and then she'll be dressed the right way and we all want to be dressed in his robes of righteousness don't we oh my but if the little baby keeps trying oh I can do it I can do it he's just everywhere he can't do it can I get any men's from the moms okay some of your dad say Amen - I'll say Amen you try to dress them in anything why I'm big enough I can do it I got it Victoire Genevieve so funny she'll find clothes laying on the floor like somebody's shirt and she'll put the shirt on and so it's like hanging over her neck and she's walking around and she thinks she's something big and special and it's like an adult sized t-shirt and she's got a sleeve over her head and she's walking around like I'm somebody big I'm someone that's how we are when we try to do something for God without God's leadership for it like that was me I was trying to argue with my mom mom this programs right you know this was years when I first came to message and I was literally raising my voice and that's what it was I I didn't accomplish anything of it other than having to go back and say I'm sorry mom forgive me I should not have got upset and raised my voice it was like a baby trying to put on that shirt all by itself but you know what I humbled myself I know what happened most even a year later God opened up brother cams eyes and then sister Betsy's eyes to the message see I started out that year brother hey man I was fighting I thought my I can do this I it can just be all me but then I had to humble myself and say Lord you just use me in other words in this case in this case there was Simon just used brother Simon instead of arguing and fussing about it he said to let the Holy Spirit put the arm in there and then he's fully then they get to then they get God's will he says we just have to hold still and let him do it just yield to him and say here Lord Here I am just let me be nothing I yield you put my hand in the right place that's the victory that's the overcoming the thing that you have to do is overcome as yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcome for you he knows the way we don't how many can say many that but in Noah's time there was only a overcomers and they went in they were caught inside how many want to be caught inside the rapture let me read this last two quotes of them I'll go to my last scriptures here he said if you have a good intention just be caught inside don't struggle not him that willeth or him that runneth but God just let God yield yourself to him and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised he's able to perform not join one denomination join another run to this run of that just yield yourself to God and walk with Him peaceful quiet not interrupted just keep on walking with him praise the Lord now next he goes to Daniel he said in Daniels now preach this maybe next Sunday Daniel only there was only four overcomers in Daniels day in the days of lot there was only three over comers out of Sodom now out of Sodom he says in the days of John the Baptist there's only I'm so there was only six over comers and then he comes to our day now let's stand to our feet and I want us to read two more quotes I will proudly read these over and over again here because we want to be overcomers I'm going to be overcomers we have to learn to yield to him Church I've got to learn to yield a more that's one thing I learned you know when remember when brother Brian Hawkins got healed this summer let me just share this real quick all right look back as I was preparing this it came to me that was just a time that I yielded to God let me just give you a little background on that just a few hours before that we were having the youth banquet and it was all laughs it was all jokes it was just playing the kit that the youth were just having a fun time where's Lydia right let they were playing like a clue game and all the adults were dressed up remember in the picture that I showed you brother Brian head on like his military stuff that's cuz he was dressed up for a game we were playing a game I wasn't playing a game but I was just we were there to let the young people have a game and then everybody was filled up I had some dessert my brother any men it was goodness there it was like a chocolate cake or something in other words I'm saying like this I wasn't feeling very spiritual in fact I was kind of feeling like a little bit worldly myself but there was a service right after that and everybody's tired and brother Frank nobody shout in the service that I heard I would have to pray for the people and it just felt like the spiritual it was like this it was like mm-hmm you all know what I'm talking about have you been there sometimes special meetings it don't sound very spiritual but church after the service you know the brother preacher was a nice message nobody came up for prayer you know there's no young people I came up for prayer we're just down in the basement talking and I was just telling mother Brian you know I wonder how much you come preach for me sometime and he said you know brother Jesse I have been able to preach because he's turned me down a couple of times I said I said well brother are you still feel led to preaching so I've been battling this degeneration I've been battling the Crohn's disease and everything like that he said the doctor told me I got to get to hip replacements and I said I said okay and in my heart in my mind I'm like why is this have to happen he's 42 years old why does he have to suffer and get both hips replaced and church here's where here's where I could have just I could have just you know tried to get my arm in there I'm just gonna but I had to yield to the Holy Spirit and it and it just felt like the anointing of God came down and I just looked at brother Brian and brother Jim and I said brothers let's pray right now and ask God to give this man healing there's no way he should have to go under the knife and get both of his hips cut out and removed and be on crutches he's 42 years old and I can say one time in my life believe him and that was one time where I yielded to the Holy Spirit of course there's other times but I didn't feel spiritual I was full with sugar and you know bacon and we're just playing gating the man was dressed up playing the game but the Holy Spirit said this is the moment to yield and the Holy Spirit dropped down and I said is there any sin you need to confess before we pray he said no brother I searched my life and I believe God can do it so we pray and I said I speak life where the degeneration is the doctor said degeneration never gets fixed but we cursed that death and we spoke life and three days later you know the story he calls up and he says I'm shouting I'm praising God I'm trying not to shout too loud he said but the doctor has announced me somehow your body's healed itself how did it happen Church we just yield it to the Lord not my will not their will but God's will be done and that's why I want to share that I know it's a testimony we've heard before but I want to share it was a yielding to the Holy Spirit I didn't feel spiritual I didn't even fast that day sister Beatrice I didn't even fast I didn't fast and how many times I'm fast like every Sunday and every Wednesday forever for this church and I didn't even fast that day I probably over ain't brother William I probably over eight I'll be honest we out do it sometimes but see it wasn't me trying to make something happen I just yield it and let the father guide my hand glory amen cuz he said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover Amen hallelujah just learning to yield how many want you to the Holy Spirit as we close musician if you'll come I want to read these two quotes just they're very very short now listen listen this please in the church age book program says no true believer is any stronger and spiritual healthy and alive than is knowledge of and adherence to the pure Word of God amen in other words you're never gonna be as strong as you can be or as healthy as you can be unless you're obeying the word now doesn't that bring your mind church obedience is greater than sacrifice you know what all this boils down to brother bang the rapture those who obey God that's what it's gonna boil down to glory josè those people in the rapture I believe it's gonna be some of us hopefully all of us but the difference is they're gonna obey the word by the leadership of the Holy Spirit they're gonna submit brother bang and they're gonna obey say
