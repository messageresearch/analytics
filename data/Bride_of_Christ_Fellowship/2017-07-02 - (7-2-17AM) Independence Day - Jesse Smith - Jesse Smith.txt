a little break you know from the series that you just do without a series last thing this one just let it go this way let's go - you said revelation 15 here [Music] like to speak this morning on Independence Day leads to Victory Day so I got it I got my inspiration from Victory Day breached April 21st 1963 but I think I my inspiration from that and I thought well we have Independence Day coming up I like to preach on that as well by God's grace I think you'll find this as the scripture teaches you first got to declare your independence and you get the victory this revelation 15:1 this reprograms text for his sermon victory day and I saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous seven angels having the seven last plagues for in them is filled up the wrath of God and I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire and then that had gotten the victory over the Beast and over his image and over his mark and over the number of his name stand upon just sea of glass having the harps of God this group is a bunch of victors amen and they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the lamb saying great marvelous are thy works Lord God Almighty just and true are thy ways thou king of saints now let's go to Joshua 14 for a second time we'll read just verse 12 the context is verses 6 to 12 this is about Caleb saying you need my mountain surely see the the connection here Joshua 14 let's read all that's already that together we can one more 6 verse 12 1 2 3 the Lord spake in that day for thou Curtis in that day on Anakin's were there and that the cities

every day every person every sincere first in Florida does the same Lord we need you Lord take the control more help us not to be in a hurry the Lord have your way and they each person yield to you that you might be glorified in Jesus Christ name ever said anything unless you'd be in series I would like to look at that to stop me here this morning Independence Day leads to victory date tonight at 4 o'clock we probably finish the Daniel series I think the chapter 11 on Wednesday night and won't really even finished Chapter 12 Daniel nice to finish that book by God's grace this series book that got his name playing remember that book was to be sealed up until the end time amen and brother have said it's the mysteries that God finished would be the mists the seventh angel to finish all the mystery of God so we're grateful that the mysteries are finished amen so let's look at this talk here you know I kind of got my inspiration for this last year and my family went to Virginia you probably know when I got back I said all I'm going to preach a message on the American Revolution I remember saying that here and never did I forgot about it but when we passed the Lord over is back today I thought yeah I think every time I to your church age or something and then we had Monday that will know the Alpha know we're gonna get a chance to pudding parade or anything like that but watch some videos and watch some soldiers give their speeches and I'm just crying and thanking the Lord for all the you know the sacrifice that men and women have made you know over the years for our freedom and then I thought I come into July 4th weekend I that slaughter preach a message on something about American history so I'm gonna try to do a little bit of that today by God's grace that's kind of I got my inspiration from I'm touching on a few things you know back from the American Revolution that I learned you know when we were over there I'm Virginia Williamsburg there Yorktown it was really quite wonderful cargo quite a refreshing vacation I recommend that anybody want to go on a good vacation go there go to Yorktown go to Jamestown you'll have a fantastic time and if you're if you're spiritual you see God's hand and everything so I want to you know as I said I want to tie in you know Victory Day with Independence Day by the grace of Lord we don't know you know Tuesday's Independence Day the fourth of July and it's up it's a memorial remembering of when our country's leaders signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776 they had to write up this big long document they actually approved it on July 2nd but they want to edit it one more day on July 3rd and then they all signed it on July 4th they even put it enough it's looking like about two more weeks to put in a beautiful draft the parchment you know and that that's what we see today you know when we see pictures of that Washington DC and so forth it's such an important document and know we'll be celebrating that and you know the sacredness of that day has really left Americans because it used to be such a great day they bring the Liberty Bell dings they find any bells that ring the bells they'd have political speech it's kind of out my Memorial Day or Veterans Day today you know where people are if you can you're supposed to gather for parades and speeches and out of the fallen right and honor those who have served be be thankful give thanks write unto God for what he's done but America's really lost touch with July 4th you know because there they they forgotten all that they this country was under and I was looking I'm just standing over the document last night briefly I did get a chance to read all of it but they listed there's how like Martin Luther they listed all of their grievances against the king you know it all the evils you've done the taxation without representation and he'd been killed many colonists you know from America that would say anything against him and he got a lot of awful things and of course you know about the Tea Party and Paul Revere's ride things like that but but they finally got fed up with it and and they had to decide on we gonna fight and become independent are we gonna remain under a man's hand we're here remaining out there a tyrants rule I thought I would have put a very tight to the church jadynn ahead what a great tied to the bride of Jesus Christ and and I believe it's you know a very good tight so you know what I did is I went back and looked at a little bit of my my notes from vacation last year and so you know in July of 1776 it was signed the Declaration was signed and wasn't long after that that the battle started and I just did a little reading on George Washington now he's a pretty good man the programs there's a lot of there's a lot of lies about him like they're not they thought he never told a lot that said now you know that no one's ever been perfect only christ chopped down the cherry between all these things but i was reading you know britannica last night and he was a pretty good fella he's pretty faithful right before you know before he was a general president and before the revolution he was a great plantation owner and a surveyor and did some different jobs and and the resize takes a pretty good fella was because one time that they kept track of how many times he went to church in here he went sixteen times only my sixteen times the church in london and he smoked tobacco and did all kinds of things so he's a pretty good fella remember they were under the age of the mayonnaise right they weren't under the age and we're under the flying eagle so he's a pretty pretty good man and very honest very hard-working he treated as slaves well he actually went abolish slavery but couldn't do that later you know Abraham Lincoln but he treated his slave just as well as anyone anyone else he was a very just man but you know laughter and then he was even a military leader for the whole state of Virginia we know that this is even before the Revolution he had such faithfulness about he was so faithful but the people Virginia looked up and said my this guy he needs to be our leader and he was the general you know but then I've heard of that he retired and went back to his plantation and then this started moving up about you know freedom and independence and an America be not from under Great Britain and everything like that and so he started to cut attended the meetings and he didn't say a whole lot he just attended and all these things and pretty soon he became people would ask him things and pretty soon he became a very influential person and he was one of the signers of course we know of the original Declaration of Independence and because of his because of his character the people looked at him and said we want him to be leader and the general of the whole army and so he was and he started off with the few good victories once the revolution started the most famous that you know was December of 1776 when he crossed the Delaware remember that so from July some book sometime between July December 10th I'm looking up and they start to the war and Italy victories but then they start falling on hard times and if you go and study that for what I've read from that night it had gotten really bad for the colonists they thought they were going to lose you know they thought they were going to lose because they hadn't had a victory in a few months or something like that it was pretty a pretty sad situation so George's mother had said the history says that he prayed and then did a surprise attack on Great Britain soldiers on Christmas night when he knew they might be drinking they knew may not be no Christmas night they might be drinking and having their frolicking and it was a very successful trip they're very successful and actually gave New Hope accorded this one this Bacchus I found there in the Jamestown this attack the stunning victory at Trenton New Jersey across to the Delaware on Christmas night the New Hope to the Patriot cause my what up what an example there of a leader who's got to be led of the Holy Spirit how many want to be led of the Holy Spirit you had to be led at a time when it looked like it was going to just fall apart how could how could an untrained army of just militia man what you talking thirteen counties man this is a very organized the government even its own government you know how could a bunch of mission of militiamen without any real training to beat the greatest army in the world amen but if God's behind you all things are possible amen remind me of like you know of Moses or something like that he just brought the people you started lead the people out so watch the Cubs victory and and they kept going and then you remember the winter of 1777 and 1776 it was when it washed had moved his army into Valley Forge in Pennsylvania I remember that they had severe weather and shortages of food and and terrible hardships for the soldiers and it was just a loser probably one of the lowest times of the war but they have it'll hope and if you know the story you know pretty soon the account has got some help from Lafayette and remember Lafayette he's a very famous man generally young generally come over across the sea and yeah he was around well traded military he helped bring training to the military he taught of all their ranks and biting and and got them really organized and training and after that the French even though there was a more French armies that came over and it was such a glorious thing to see that that when God's people and when they fight for their fighting for liberty don't you appreciate people that will fight for liberty and God has blessed our country in such a church you can see the effects of all they fought for you can see the next summer right now in the very Declaration of Independence it talks about how every man has the right I've got the god-given rights you know to pursue you know happiness and love and all those things but then and now it's God then they said we must work according to God's law the church was very ugly me I stood there Jamestown I stood in the very church that many of those men fasted and prayed they took a day of prayer fasting before actually heading into the war no Jamaat even before July 4th I stood there without my I shouldn't I stood in the home or George Washington state for a while there in Virginia and to see the table that he worked on they had his clothes and there were things like that by it was quite striking and then later on went to Yorktown I walked at the very fields that George Washington locked up we looked at the very Garrison's though you know where they built reconstructions of the Garrison's of the Britain soldiers and they had though they still had bombs from the trenches that the soldiers had built had done rather they still the very trenches and George Washington and his men had fought and they men to bring us freedom praise God the own the idea behind that was just independent I don't want to be ruled by man by some other man we want to rule ourselves by our own leadership and other others by our own leading and I think that's a great time for the church we don't want to be led by headquarters on earth he wouldn't be led by the headquarters of haman haman every church is soldered of it south praise the Lord and must follow the leading of the Holy Spirit and I was listening to last night we went out to my troops might turn up it's a little pizza place and there was a Jehovah's Witness person there they were saying how they were saying how the job is when the church has to be the true church because every Church they have preaches the same sermon every single time and they said that's a proof of the unit team can I get to say anything that wish that could happen but just because a group by man its headquarters and leadership can all preach the same thing that doesn't mean it's the call of God that can be the work of man look at any company Chevrolet or a polar or Microsoft they all can have the same words and the same bylaws are the same reasons of everything like that and he may imagine set that up but it would really be God if God could speak the same unity to all churches but from all different angles from all the different bible scriptures getting his bride ready that would be a real move of God amen and that's what we have in this hour we have that by God's grace the same Holy Spirit is preaching in Africa or Rhode Island or you know Mexico the same gothis preaching there is preaching an acronym and is preaching to us God's Word and it's preparing God's people for a second coming amen that's exactly right now what uh just for a moment before I get to the ending of the American Revolution I want to go back over Victory Day a little bit by God's grace okay joy make three Dan listen to that wow I don't think I've ever preached on Victory Day I'm not mistaken but brother branham preaches and we said that April fourth or 21st 63 he preached it in a brother's house they brother Isaacson or she's gonna think about it you did okay well my same thing Robin he's real good at coming and corrected me after discouragements and I first think that because I don't understand everything I don't have all the background knowledge but it's brother Isaacson's house in Sierra Vista Arizona I've never been there I imagine the wrongs that they met brother hammer said he liked these little house meetings because it reminded him of the apostatize what the Bible said they went from house to house preaching God's Word and they were sending brother Brandon Oh tidings cuz he said I have received your tie these and he said there are treasures to me that's interesting a pastor and there was passing them receiving the ties to the people and setting them to brother Brandon that's interesting I don't know if the brother was preaching or not or just plain tapes I couldn't hear on the tape one way or the other but then he opens up with revelation 15 as you read our text he talks about those who've got the victory and he said they just got victory over the Beast and now they're singing the praises he said brother Graham said the first thing he does is bring our thoughts back to war when we think of BJ he said because we just recently came across the beating that he was speaking of the v-day from May 8 1945 the v-j here was was actually a holiday on May 8 1945 it took place in Great Britain in the United States and it's celebrated victory the victory in Europe today when they got victory over Germany cities of both nations in both US and Great Britain as well as former occupied cities of Western Europe put out flags and banners and rejoice in the defeat of the Nazi war machine so managed oh this is the 96th I was 20 years later he references you know we just got out of a bday and when we think of victories that we think of war and brother branham's first example that he brings up a war is Cain and Abel he said in jealousy was the reason for the first bloodshed of that this is striking what the holy spirit would precess to the Hoffs church jealousies the first thing he brings up war and then jealousy and he said of course Cain was jealous becomes a God accepted Abel's revelation and not his he said both tried to find favor both were trying to find life but he said God only accepts one way God only a sex accepts the innocent blood as an atonement everybody have said no matter how small the groove God will come on the basis of Christ and his shed blood aren't you glad this morning if God came down the house group there and Sara Vista Arizona because of the chef-owner Christ how much more can he come to us amen if we're coming by the shed blood so what do we what's the reason what's our justification will probably think we could receive anything from God today is it because of what we've done if it is you won't get anything but if it's because of what God has done for us and trusting and what he's given to us and thanking him for what he's given us then we can expect something from God this morning it's exactly right amen when I read this quote here he said what the trouble is and he's comparing mr. Cain and Abel he said the trouble is God invites manna to look at his provided way but man wants to show himself so his own way its own idea about it so that's the idea of Cain and Abel Kane was looking at it I want to see salvation in my way I was cited the direct commands of God but Abel was looking at I want to obey God directly by his command by the revelation that he gave me by the word that he gave me which is interesting go down tells the story of how he lifts it up binoculars in soft heart and antelopes but he said he had to focus them and then he finally saw one and he said that's what we've got to do he said we got to focus our binoculars he said the word of the binoculars amen he said if your binoculars of the word show three persons he said you got to focus those binoculars again there we go he said what they fail to get the glass in focus God wants them to see one thing and that's the innocent blood that was shed for their sins we don't need organization he said we don't need any he said that only does damage we only need to look at one thing that's our substitute and the substitute is Jesus Christ I mean look at Jesus Christ this morning for healing for revelation for grace for faith for forgiveness you only need to look at one thing this day and that's the substitute that's Jesus Christ Alleluia program said God made one way because he was all human beings of all colors all ages to try to focus on one thing that's his word he said God became a man in order to take away sin that's that behold the lamb of God who took away all the sins of the world on the video and then program tells a story of a young married woman he'd meant that God gave her a victory over mental breakdown he said she lost her focus she was married to young man the man said he loved her but then he ran away with another woman who got married again she's in the she's a preacher's daughter and my mam said she was lost in a world so in other words she has a mental break now I know he loves there's no way he could let me he'll come back put them back I brought a man she just said she stayed in that world of her own in a mental breakdown for a long time until the vision came and brother Graham told her something that that she knew he could know and that let her know that God's presence was there and that she shouldn't trust in the lie that she was trusting in programs that she lost her focus on Calvary how many to focus on Calvary every day then every day indeed it praise God he said she was living in another world but she had to get refocused on Calvary in other words though he said that she should have live in a stupe condition she'll is living on lost her mind condition a mental breakdown condition there's no or whatever condition you may find yourself you may there's hope for him whatever condition your family may find themselves in there's hope in the cross of Jesus Christ hallelujah the program said see Cain was using his natural mind rather than a spiritual mind he wanted to see his own way rather than God's Way incentive program said Kings should have said this he should have said oh my brother Abel I'm so happy that God has accepted your sacrifice and now we've got away the Jehovah accepts this way because he's provided it by receiving your sacrifice wouldn't that have been the thing to do I think it's amen to that see it was jealousy that caused that first warn everybody see that let's talk about getting a victory it gives all these examples jealousy had caused him and Cain's you to look and said my even though my sacrifice now even though God didn't answer my prayer there are some people whose prayer God does answer and I need to change my worship I need to follow that way Lauren that would have been the right thing to do I'm innocent but instead he lived from the natural mind live he got jealous of Abel he said instead of coming and saying well wonderfully she got him it's the people let's do that sir we said he got jealousy the same thing as Cain God and then he utter then Cain took the blood of his brother Abel he said that's what starts the trouble that's where the trouble begins that's where the broken vows begin where the broken fellowship separates that's the thing that breaks up homes that's the thing that breaks up the wheel moving towards the first arch that we are moving towards divorces that's the very thing that breaks the fellowship so see instead of getting happy for somebody instead of rejoicing with God moving someone will get jealous or someone will get upset or someone will get some of their own spirit right and in a creates a war it grates divisions how many want a unified body in our church amen how many want to see the Bride of Christ unified around the world they met we I do so what must we do we must love a man we must not let anything get in between each other by the grace of the Lord the next example brother Graham game was Eve her fellowship with Adam and God was broken because she believed well there's two ways it's okay there's two ways to do this by medicine two ideas one was the lie the serpent and then the other one was God's plain word through Adam program so that's why God is not allowed women preachers and he had to Craig mother had to Craig Joseph and Rebecca and Sarah at the table they thought there was women angels mymadison no there's no such a thing as women angels God doesn't make the woman a messenger a leader of with the word not only makes a man a leader with the word that's right mother Graham said I know I know women that can preach like lightning far out preach a man but that's not the righteous thing to do he says Oh glory and then he goes into how this spirit of jealousy breaks up the fellowship of homes churches nations and then program goes in the national spirits Germany has a military spirit America has a product hahaha spirit he said France has an immoral sphere women wine liquor Finland has a loyal sphere and honest spirit and he said that causes warranted hey spirits will get upset with each other spirits on this person spirits on that person but man said even dogs he used sled dogs can get spirits on them and then off to separate the sled dogs in order because they'll kill each other because demons get on there but Emerson where'd this come from he said I come from Genesis the seed chapter because Cain did not love his brother and then program gets into nations have Wars than alliances than a few generations later they're back up at war again instead of being friends he said we need one Brotherhood and then program goes in the world war one that he could recounts world war one I know my son knows a lot more about World War one than I am so I'm not gonna say much about World War one just cool me on it but but Adam talks about when he was five years old World War one started he said and he thought his dad might have to go and he was he's going to try to defend his dad and keep his dad from going but a few years later he said they won the war and then they made a League of Nations and I thought that that piece for them pretty soon World War two started another back fighting again with bigger bottoms bigger planes more bloodshed and then program tells us where he got the inspiration for this sermon he said it's d-day Victory Day that was the day the armies took victory over the UH the enemies he said d-day is when they went in to fight but v-day is when a peace treaty was signed I mean know the difference d-day was when all the Allies that World War two stormed the beaches of Normandy France because the Germans had taken over that right now the Germans had taken over Normandy France pretty close right and so Eisenhower got his troops in different countries got their troops and they stormed the beaches of Normandy d-day we saw reenactment of it up in Pennsylvania remember that Milka we saw reenact a couple years ago that was really nice to see that really inspiring that was d-day and it wasn't long after that they got the victory and push back the Germans now d-day was June 6 1944 just past the anniversary of I remember seen on Facebook and everything but then the next year at Mayday was when that the v-day and v-day was again the day that they finally got victory and then the nations have agreed to stop fighting that's why remember I've got the inspiration for this sermon Victory Day the man said they blew the whistles when they had v-day they throw their hats in the air they shot guns in the air they beat the drums like the music they beat one of it on the back why because we won victory victory we won and it was a great thing it brought peace to the Christian nation so-called and we had a little time of breathing he said but now he goes into some other Wars now but now we're going to mix the transition from those natural wars into spiritual wars or we say Bible warns amen so now that he shares his inspiration for the natural Wars and then he goes back to the Bible wars praise God how many believe God's people have many great V days many great days where they can stand there and say this is the day I've overcome this is the day I've overcome Satan I've had a few day lately if you do you want a shout out or you want to praise or you want to weep tears of joy I don't know what I'm talking about Amen but you get the real bead that you get a real victory praise God something you battle for so low for so many years or so many folks are so hard and you finally get the v-day amen what a victory it is hallelujah that's what we're talking about now because remember there's gotta first be a declaration of independence first you got to declare your independent of these things but then you got to fight until you get the v-day praise God my dad said we fight every day every Christian fights a battle every day we're in a warfare right now going on constantly within us so not only do you have sometimes Wars out here with spirits but you've got a word side of you between right and wrong shall we receive it what shall we do shall we bow to the world shall we give up this thought that we got everybody man up said if we see it focus it take it from Genesis to Revelation she does Gus said the Lord each time right down through there we can't give it up we can't compromise with the rest of them we just can't do it we've got to stay here that's all now no matter how great the enemy is and how much machineries got against us and how many organizations and how many this is that yeah we have to pull the focus of God's Word till we find them there's one thing and that's the blood of Jesus Christ and he's the same yesterday today and forever so can you see that every day is a warfare for you and I we are battling at a Christian warfare and program said God's Heroes has always had warfare so we're basically in two battles and trials now and listen this brother of stops and he tells this little house Church in Sierra Vista this he says you little Church remember back here you are part of that unit in other words you're some of God's heroes did you know we got some of God's heroes in here of this party and then we raised their hands I want to God for us who's a hero who's a hero fighting for crisis party I am one of God's heroes race lilies and everybody racing ahead one of God's heroes I'm fighting for Christ we're not fighting for the world we're fighting for Jesus this morning amen we seem like a small outpost but ma'am said we're a little Church he said but you know what an outpost is you're an outcast back outpost back here you should be you should be by being some of it right here by you you're an outpost back here to keep up the banners to do what's right to still claim that Jesus Christ is the only hope of the world not the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholic Jewish whatever may be races planted color outside it it's Jesus Christ he's the one he's our Victor he's the one he's the chief captain of the move this is his orders we've got to carry out the orders you said some of you boys served in the ward we have any veterans in here this one anybody ought to serve in here I don't think so I think he's in ok so we don't have any natural meds a lot of spiritual veterans in here though he said if the captain gives you an order that's right what happens out there in that land this morning we that was here we have a better and you turn around and do something backwards you'll mess the whole army up that's right you'll throw it into a riot you've got to carry out the orders the only way you can do it is see the purpose and see what it's all about amen glory you see God's purpose this morning is to help us encourage us to keep fighting keep waving the banners that Jesus Christ is still the only hope of the world I'm glad to be a part of this morning amen to wave the banner to do my part and say this is a small little church a small little outpost but we still believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever will be witnesses that will stand upon that because we love that we believe that amen glory now he says there's been many be days for believers he said there's coming a final B day he talks about the Battle of Armageddon amen of course we know there's one more battle for that we know it's gog and magog but he met Jesus mentions Armageddon so but that's still true it is a one of the final battles before the millennium and then he goes let's go some some examples of some warriors actually read this I'm gonna forget that he says that Moses was a a warrior he said but the church Israel and Egypt had long forgot the victory they were slaves so has the modern church today never feel like that sometimes you lose the victory not just be honest sometimes you never lose the victory but man so that's the condition Israel is in an Asian they lost the victim they forgot what does it mean to be victorious what does it mean to be free so God said to Moses and Manderson Moses was born for something he was born to deliver the people of God he said what happened to Moses on the backside of the desert he got his glasses focused god's only purpose was it to marry this beautiful Ethiopian girl and settle down and have children but his mission beyond that was to deliver the children of God out from under that bondage that was his commission that's what he was born for church how you know you're born for more than just the natural things you're more your borders are more than just you know coming to church or having a job or having a family we're born for more than that we've got to ask God say Lord what was I born for what looks like you how can I find what I was born for most didn't fight us he was 80 years old that's when he finally got his glasses fixed at the burning bush and church that won't fix our glasses it's the burning presence of Jesus Christ amen a burning bush being in God's presence but the power of God's presence will get our eyes focus on what our purpose is that might be men like that the matters that each one of us is born for something we wasn't just put on here on earth for nothing he said that mountain never happened out there just to be that tree was put there for a purpose everything is for a purpose it's got to serve and we are here for a purpose maybe it's the testified to one person and get them saved and out of that might come a preacher who sent a million souls to Christ he gave Lutie right we gave an example dry moody I never checked that as far as this testimony but it seems like it's a powerful tested one maybe to get to more of the details but I've said maybe your purpose is to win one soul how many have a desire to witness all to Christ yeah okay so maybe that's your purpose being out and just you know the regular things y'all she's going to work I should work hard as you love my family I need to start that's wonderful but my back said beyond that even winning one soul a great purpose for the kingdom of God remember there's levels of rewards there's levels of colleagues - right there's five talents three talents one talent there's a hundredfold reaping right there's a 60 fold in the 30 fold there's all these different levels all different kinds of ministries we must seek God and see what is the mother calling for my life I want to know what I was born to do amen look what he says next unless it is don't despise where God has got you the church said hey no no no despise where God has got cheese why did I say that because I have found that for a while Lord why my doctor I'd like to be back in line are like be with my brother cabin two-pointer father brother Craig you know we get this spies where God has placed us but he says serve your purpose there's coming a great victory day one of these days where the battle is going to be over and I think of our brother James brownie his battle is over this morning it's over again aneurism went home to be with the Lord and I'll never forget he was the very first live creature I ever heard preach the message and I walked in the church I'll never forget it they had the old technologies before projectors what was those old projectors called the overhead projector and he had a picture of that Life magazine from 1963 I just heard about the message a few days ago I think it was the first weekend of December 19th I'm sorry in 2001 yeah I think it was that right around there maybe was January I maybe went to the Duke I don't remember but it this is some time in winter and he had an aura trajector and he had that light magazine on a projector sheet and he said he's preached on the inside and inside was kinda like a standard it's kind of a banner a flag and he said from the believer today this cloud of the beard overrun around there he said this car is our enzyme today and I didn't know every what he was talking about well one thing I believe was any rich water baptism but I wasn't raising the message I think I know he breached the Godhead was the right way it's only one person I know he freaked serpent see that that's how that's why I God I had to send Christ by a virgin birth was because of how sin entered the world through sex act so God had to bypass that and sent Jesus as a new creation to start a new race people who'd be born again the Holy Ghost amen and I'll never forget that what a great example that brother James lived and before we started this church both Samuel mention again he was glad to hear last year in June I went down and saw James and Samuel and in April 2006 I sat across the table said tell me what if we start a church we're feeling left to start a church what is it going to be like I'll never forget he looked right across the table and he said don't expect anybody to be the church he said you're the church he said don't expect anybody else to labor he said you've got the labor if you want to church he said God needs laborers and God these workers at his vineyard and that has been nothing but the truth right because we'd all get tired you know we all good we all go through battles and things like that but what we found is that every ministry is a burden and to work you've got a you got a labor you've got a fully support you can't give up and then I'll never forget I think it was 2011 on Mother's Day the power went out their church and James and Samuel came to our service over borrow do not pretend about modern the groom and afterwards I asked her brother James you know you were getting older brother I said what would your advice be for a young man like me and you know you go to spice but his advice was I wish I would have exercise and take care of my body better I wanted to have all the hard trouble that I have now he said I could travel more for mission work dude that's why I have rafter that I started running again I'm on a treadmill like I'm not gonna get bad health I still exercise at this day and then I do Taekwondo twice a week it but those things too though that wisdom that Warriors have talked you we're supposed to hang on to that amen and so I remember that program said that Moses though had a little disappointment at first the people rejected him and then he talks about that what seemed like a disappointment at the Red Sea when he brought 2 million people out to the Red Sea and were they going to go there surrounded by the Egyptians and by them said felt like a disappointment to Moses you've done 10 plays you've got all these miracles and Here I am I got too many people and we're surrounded by Devils the man said it seems the Christian life if the fellows not absolutely centered on Christ the Christian seems like this life holds so many disappointments but those disappointments are God's divine will happening for us how many believe that your disappointments are things God has allowed in this perfect will now it don't seem like it would be that but it's God's way of doing things he lets us hit the river to see what we'll do about it if you remember standing the gap in 63 and that message my dad told I was complex he lost the feeling for the people remember that and he said I can't go on and preach i apprec and the more the more the women cut their hair the more they wear makeup the more men go to organizational invite me to their churches he said and he said his family if they won't listen to me I'll go could be a trap her and I will preach in March go be a trapper and we've got used to me in us at the Lord he set out Thunder off that mountain and I'll come bring the prop the message down and go back up to the mountain remember that message Santa yeah that's right and brother branham said he sent that message that God had to correct him and program said if you do that he said he'll be nothing more than a bum you'll turn into a bum he said your wife will leave you if you go on with your complex and won't have a feeling for the people and preach even though they reject you the Angels for telling it here to have a divorce oh you're gonna be separated for your wife if you don't do what the Word of God says remember so I thought it was the Old Testament prophet and the angel said here are New Testament prophet there's a great difference between Old Testament right his New Testament of the Bible ministry and they stay with the people the Old Testament prophet could leave out and come back and leave out but the New Testament prophet stays right with the church exactly right and then at the very end of the message pro medicine let it be remembered here from tonight he said I have no vision about what I have to do from here for he said but he said let it be known if God has to push a man through a pipe and tell him everything he has to do he said there's no face involved in it amen and then brother Kevin said that every decision every victory he's had to make the decision did you get that from his testimony God doesn't always tell us every decision to make but he allows tests and trials he makes the trial said now I'm gonna watch my son overcome this trial and I know they're gonna use the right thing through this but if they fail God said I know they'll get it right next time are you with me church I don't understand wherever we're looking at this that's the example he goes Christianity if you're not careful if you don't see God has handed everything even allow you to make mistakes if you get disappointed with life mother instead but you've got to look at everything through Calvary how is God using this is shaky how is this trial changed my life and then you can be centered on Calvary and see God's hand and all your life thing that the man said God brought Moses I'm trying to speed up there God brought Moses to this to bring into a pide to get him to cry out he's out the room is out the red seat he looks surrounded my man said it got brought there to cry out in the midst was try and God said why he cried to me he said I know I needed the Commission speak speak and go forward well Graham said what courage to tell a man with two million people speaking go for room he said what courage he said what a courage that we ought to be that ought to be for a sick person speak the word and go forward what it courage it ought to be for a backslider turn yourself around and start back stay in the line of duty it's God's business to open up the Red Sea that's God's business you just speak the word and move forward that's all you and I have to do hey you like that I got that's all we have to do speak God's Word and go forward it's God's business to open up the Red Sea I like that the next example is Joshua remember sure about Joshua he was the next hero faith he says God let disappointments happen to show victory if only we could see then you would only see that these things that seems to be so burden you and upsetting you they are trials there are things to stand still focus your glasses on the Word of God speak the word and then just walk forward do you like that by God's grace so every trial is a situation where God is bringing you to a position and you're supposed to refocus your eyes upon the Word of God in other words each situation draws you closer to Christ amen my man said I love Joshua when he came to the River Jordan he did the same thing Moses did he had to put the word first when he put the word first he crossed down he said there you are with the Commission from God put the word first and brought a bead a it's got to come that's all it isn't how you're going to get to your destination that's up to God just keep on moving and follow the word don't you like that amen so we can just make a blanket statement saying in the will of God finding the purpose for God for your life here is poem says in every trial put the word first whatever you know to be truth just do that to speak that just stay with that and then God will open everything up up to us Amen if not it will just seem like disappointments let's just seemed like a struggles but if we put the word first the word will move we've got the prophesy right John had the prophesy again is that right but the spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of prophecy amen is that right so our live sometimes prophesied for ending the time of my life on the side of something okay I can't remember right now but I remember the windows of course of the children being boards of the mothers I couldn't action I remember that was prophetic that's very prophetic but our lives if the Spirit of God is in us it should prophesy of things to come that's exactly right we just put the word first Abraham is the third example in game another Victor didn't remember what mother ever said his bday was it was Mount Moriah when he took Isaac up to sacrifice him on Mount Moriah that was his v-day his bday wasn't when he had I see now that was a girl I was a great that might have a minor bday gonna have said this real feed day was when God had told him to go sacrifice and destroy the very thing he thought was the blessing of God the very thing he thought was going to be the album this is the Avenue so how God is going to fulfill the plan for my life he said this was his v-day I want to just read it he said program says that God raised up has raised us from the things of the world and crush you of the earth just like Abraham see we look at these little trials and we think there is something but they're nothing but just little testing times God tested Abraham but he's got this be day when he went up there and obedience to word the Word of God but remember said Abraham had his focus right because God said I'm going to make you of other nations he put his focus on what thus saith the Lord was and he walked straight with that what the said the Lord was day after day he walked year after year confessing anything contrary to that he said it had to be that way God said so church are we walking with us say the Lord today we ought to meet what the says nor do we have the bonus of Pentecost I'll be in the bride also the move is on the bride he's God we have those that say the Lord the move is on the bride in other words we can - as God moves us amen and what is he moving us to do Church he's moving us to win souls because we're trying to finish the Great Commission so how does that look that could look all we can set more money to missionaries we can do missionary working in Akron or Ohio we do missionary work other ways the leadership with the Holy Spirit today is trying to finish the Great Commission trying to inspire the bride to move and fulfill the Great Commission for this day amen so we can't say well Abraham as I said Lord Oviedo we have not saved the Lord Amen you know what the truth is we say God we have no say Lord the fullest of Pentecost must return Lord bring back Pentecost because the Raps was not going to happen until the fullness of Pentecost comes back to the bride and that's thus saith the Lord hey I'm happy to tell you that again I read a numerous times the last few months that's right and the move is on the bride so Lord move me so the fullness of Christ could be in me how many what the fullness of Christ and then that's what winter actually gonna come is what the fullness of Christ comes into the bride and she is a she goes back to the beginning back to what they had the beginning and how's that faith um faith cometh by hearing hearing gotta hear that gotta believe that gotta pray what and trust that and speak that and go forward right just like Moses just like Abraham speak that and go forward let us save the Lord Lord I'm speaking it now the move is on me and part of the pride the fullness of your spirit we must live through us Lord the move is on the I believe it I'm not letting anything get in the way I'm not letting anything unfocused or scratch my glasses I'm gonna keep my glasses clean I'm gonna keep my eyes focused right on the Word of God that's right did you know this church arteries can I just read uh Steve I think you like this I'm already out of our mercy I have like probably three hours of notes here I'm not giving able to be consistent I thought I could get through all of it did you know when brother Branham was going up when I'm sorry when Abraham was going up to offer Isaac brother Grantham said the same thing was happening in heaven that happened when Joel was tested brother man said the same thing happens in other words both programs said this is the paragraph 185 and he believed abraham abraham believed God rather and God said no doubt God told Satan I could just prove to you that he loves me see that the same thing any but I'm just talking preaching about Jove at this point and then he breaks back into Abraham is Nick amen I like that amen so say you said they're saying well of course Abraham loves you you gave him a son here's no way if you asked him to give that son back there's no way he loved you he'd curse you to your face and die everybody says no doubt Satan look at God's that he doesn't love you program said then he said God said I can prove to you that he loves me devil I wonder if God would say about us this morning hey ed I can prove that brother cabin and brother a man I can prove it brother guess he loves me I'm gonna go through this but he'll still love me no matter what amen no matter what I'm asking the sacrifice or take away whatever I loud his life he loves me no doubt God I'm told saying that Abraham loves me I'll prove it I'll prove it to you I like that we got proof sings to the devil don't you huh back what he proves that believes by promise because I told him that he'd be a father of Nations I like when I see God preached in the state don't you like that I like to see God preached in tell the devil he's going to do this he loves me he does believe every word I say seems like all come on he don't it's just a head you just gotta hedge about him and God says watch you live you doesn't go to this watch since I was helping to go kill them and then he'll actually go get in a very active do it then I'll stop and he said yeah sure sure God sure there's a chance of that happened and God seen just watch he loves Nick but rather said so Abraham took his own son off the top of the mountain his hands behind him the day that God said so right we got his hands up there he said when he pulled the knife from from its scabbard he said he pulled his hair back out of his face to take the bike he said that was Abraham speed day oh my when he was tested to the very limit of his only son now if you're just spiritual take that to the test when God hid his own son on his own feed day she talks about Christ but he goes back to Abraham Abraham speed a was Mount Kyra when the Lord provided for him a sacrifice instead of the son loves he loved listen that day Abraham proved to God without a shadow of a doubt his loyalty amen Abraham proved to God his faith in him Rahab said I got this for when I was 100 years old by believing a promise he told me I was a father nation and he asked me to take his life God is able to raise him up from the dead and on to make a Presbyterian shout hey he's proved to me already that he keeps his word has got proof to that he keeps his word church amen see your tests prove your love and loyalty to God well I'm going to love God with all their oil teens go through and program says that was his victim that was the day Abraham could shout and throw the hats at blow the trumpets this is my victory dad God approved to the devil that I love God and I'm willing to lose anything God take anything for my life as long as you know I love you I love nothing more than you you can take anything in my life and I'll still serve Jesus Christ that's a V day for the term team head that's a V day for you and I how that we got that was Abraham's real V day but man said the doubts had gone from Abraham when he was taking Isaac when he heard the real word doubts left when he seen God vindicate his word God's left love took its place that's what we need Daleks need to get their place take it my love so say Lord we can say that Lord let your love take the place of my doubts the Bible says these are get place to the devil right don't get thoughts thanks for thoughts the devil get rid of the doubts brother Graham said doubt your doubts right start doubting your mouth and but love in the place where the doubts used to me praise God yeah he said speak the word and go forward I know you love me Abraham you don't doubt me a bit no matter how long you have to wait you still believe me I asked you to destroy the very evidence I give to you and you love me so much you keep my word regardless that was a real v-day for God's people hey man let me try those we said the timing I'm trying to finish it by this time goes so fast I don't know man you gave the example of Jacob I'll just skip Jacob looking for time sake let me just give Jacob he talks about I got the heed a you wrestled the angel my men type size of the backs and wall he goes to church in to wrestle with a bat and Holy Ghost and to overcome the army of Esau right the army of organization he's the organizational man God hated Esau you know the spirit of Antichrist never remember call it his bday when he got Victor Dover brother Davis and all the ministers telling his missions were of the devil he got a you said he went out to his cave and the angel came at miss and said these are from Satan these are from me and you're gonna pray for kings and monarchs and all these things but Adam said that was a great day he said after praying all night in the cave so this is Jacob prayed into the night brother Brandon pray to the night it got a victory and we know who you really get sincere pray about something don't you having experienced it God answer your prayer if you get sincere enough about it that was one he day he recalled his life the program starts bring it to a close which I'll trying to do to my dad said Christ all these victories were temporaries Moses Jacob Abraham they're all temporary he said but Christ victory was eternal between Christ Jesus fought every enemy he said one day the chief warrior came down Jesus Christ the Son of God and there was an Easter that was a real v-day Jesus had thought prevail he fought against every enemy that was to be fought against and Jesus came into the day when he made this decision of what he would do after it received the Holy Spirit and I guess another bday when he was tempted of Satan to what Ernest might have said that was a bday when he could stand there and with Stannis Satan himself with three temptations right to his face he could say it is written I don't have to do that it is written I'm not doing what you're telling me to do it is Richard I'm not falling and worshipping something else where I wish I have got a madman Jesus is flesh person may be worse than God but he himself was the image of God amen and so that was a great meeting day Jesus overcame Satan hallelujah perhaps that every miracle Jesus did was a feat day when he raised the dead it was a beatnik yeah it's a V day when he walked on water at the V day see for a Christian many days can be B days you believe that sickness temptation everything that could be Jesus fought through every bit of it and had a V day he said that's exactly right he said Jesus death the resurrection was the ultimate v-day he said the Katie finally came to an hour of crucial hour that the debt must be paid Jesus had to come to the earth he had conquered every sickness he conquered everything now he must conquer the grade and when he conquered death death couldn't say in his presence he never even preached a funeral he proved that he had power over death and there's two more enemies there was the grave and held Hades in the grave so that day when he died he was so dead - the Sun was shining on the earth the earth had a nervous prostration The Rock's run out the hills he went down to have hunger death conquered hell and on Easter morning he conquered the grave he said talk about a complete a Rio vida amen so he conquered all the enemies that all the other patriarchs we know could not conquer the matter said he brought them out of the grave and he brought the captives that have been there the Bible said he bled captivity captive and now program brings it to us and he says now he ascended on high and gave gifts unto men tonight brings it to the fivefold ministry and the gifts of the Holy Spirit what was it swords he puts swords of the word in your hands to conquer to conquer what sickness sin superstitions evil to bring every living creature that wants to live bring every one of them to realization that because Jesus lives we shall live also their game we have to fight the fight of faith complete our victory for our complete victory is positive it's sure it's got to be we have the first fruits of it which is the baptism Holy Ghost is the firstfruits of their victory amen sorry we have the evidence of it in our heart now because we've already got the first battle behind us we've been able to conquer through faith of Jesus Christ we had a happy day and got saved and got baptized that is a be day or you can say this day I have overcome Satan's temptations in my past life all these temptations we've had be days we're so thankful for the beatings amen we're going to talk about money God say me he says he tried to get saved memory he remember he hammered and no hood upon the trees and said dear sir I know you're Jesus Christ when you saved me he said he never got an answer he said the devil whispered said why you doesn't send away your damned grace there's a little more grace see you men so mean until you won't forgive you remember remember when Romero said one of the reasons he knew that the Holy Ghost was he lost his temper that was one of the reasons he had a temper members teacher tried to have him to try things too get rid of his temper but he'd never overcome his temper he said when I knew my cover was gone that's one great sign on you I was born again hallelujah when I saw my cigarettes and worldly temptation chewing and evil movies when I saw that behind me that's one good sign I knew I was born again praise God I didn't do it yet because things that were causes me to be a slave now I had victory over them now I've been a conqueror amen look man said the first thing he knew he was starting speaking against the devil's didn't know I could be saved not I still could be saved I can still hear God's voice the first thing into a light came into the room and he said Lord he said let that light come back he said if I'm forgiven he said the light came back and he said he went left like a baby because God has showed him that he's forgiven that's a real v-day that's right oh my mother knew yay now if he closes by telling the story of the teenager young man who was in prison and he wanted a pardon and there was a governor they sent to the governor had a friend of the governor and the governor came down himself but the boy was in such an awful state as mine that the governor tried to talk to me said be quiet he said awful things I feel shut up we never say that but that's what it says I'm sorry be quiet I don't want to talk to you and he said I'm trying to part you don't be quiet can't you see I'm going to die pretty soon and then the governor leaves because the governor himself came down there but he couldn't show common respect to Authority and so he missed out on us party everybody matter said we don't want to miss out on our pardon he said the very governor of heaven earth will come down to our situation today aren't you grateful for that to give us a v-day what do we just have to do we have to have a humble respectful spirit to the Holy Spirit I mean that the Bible says if you honor God God Manar you the Bible said God honors every man in every nation who will humble themselves before the Lord that's exactly right now in closing I'm gonna start closing that here we start closing down now I started with my sure I got my inspiration for this I got it from the fourth of July and that was when they declared that they were free now all those men knew if they lost this war they could be hanging for that did you know that for high treason so this was not an easy decision to walk over there and sign your John Hancock and use one the signers of the original sign in there this was like a death so in a life-and-death situation what is the the person was really out for liberty in this case a person is really following the will of God in a life with that situation what are they going to do they're going to claim the victory and basically sign their name to it they're gonna declare that I will receive this promise and I'm willing to fight for it so write the Declaration of Independence really was that they have celebrations far as I read from Scripture I run from history I didn't see much celebrating to it on there the great the great victory celebration was when Washington after Yorktown Washington had all those British soldiers walking to New York and all the people you know they're kind of like captains rather ironic slaves and here's the men that you said you don't mistreat of all these British soldiers and they used to mistreat on there they are they're enslaved and now the people had victory now the people that don't have to worry about it just like when those past masters got grinding the days of Moses they've had all their taskmasters have been crowded and program said that's what it's like for us when we get victory over temptation all the demons of use of torments are drowned in the red blood of Jesus Christ amen the sea of Jesus Christ blood all those temptations all those Devils he sent our drown there and we got the victory through the blood of Jesus amen that's exactly right we could not have a bday without having first an Independence Day praise God where we stand upon our convictions and follow the word and put the word first and stand upon the promise of Liberty so I want to preach this message us and encourage because this quote came to my mind is from Christ that Mister God revealed I was just in this uh recently last week I think I was in some crisis mission God revealed and I'm sure once I read the quote you probably heard it before program said Jesus proves his resurrection life as he vindicates himself she the pride is independent from all others she's an independent woman a great speckled bird that's different from all others you remember the Bible on that the great speckled bird but she had his name she had his life so this is where I kind of fell inspired I'll think about this Independence Day and this quote came to my heart or my mind says the bride is an independent woman she's freed from all other men she's independent from all men but what is she she's dependent upon Christ and what the example program gives the speckled bird have you read that lately it's in Leviticus 14 if you read it it's the cleansing for a leper the very first thing they left were had to do was to go in to birds turtle doves pigeons had to bring them one of them had to be killed in an earthen vessel with running water over and all that blood and water mixed my thing about the Holy Spirit not in the water than the word all these things and then that dead bird was removed and then the living bird was dead the Bible says dipped dipped in the blood of its mate this is Bible the Bible read it until the biggest working one day and one two seven and then this bird covered in the blood of its mate would fly away the Bible said that's to be put loose on the field and this was the first signs of the sinner that you are forgiven that you're cleaning the sinner had to look down and see that that we that this bird is flying free because they're covered in the light of their mate and the church said this is going to let the leper know wow I I was so filthy dirty but I can be clean this is what God showing me God is going to have an innocent one died for me and I will be dipped in their righteousness dipped in their innocent blood and then wherever I applied people will see the life of my mate a pen they'll see the Holy Spirit on me because I'm covered in the cook and Nathan I'm covered in the life of Jesus Christ amen everybody knows that this makes her independent because she is all out loose in the overworld in the wilderness but everybody that sees her she's sees that she's covered in the blood of her mate I'm glad to be covered in the blood of Jesus Christ we are independently independen church the bride is an independent people we're not mayor are made of diet but the light of our mate remains on us amen underneath of course we know Christ lives as well but that's why we stay independent from systems and headquarters and all these things program said this is our V day the b-daman the life of God is covering over us and we're independent from any other thing we're only trusting in the life of our mate how many trusting in Jesus Christ today hallelujah romance of the bride is identified by him she's independent from all others keep thee only unto her as long as that you both shall live keep the only to him the word no adultery not one side of the nomination not one side of creed no adult should all the words and him alone personally identified by him his his property alone arches that be Christ property what did what did that bird do for that blood to get on nothing that just that was their position life what do we have to do nothing it's just our position in life to be believers a man had to accept his righteousness and fly away free to have a real bday let's do our feet my boundaries we are independent from any Creed of man any man handling we're free from that because we stay with the word were to fly free in Christ covered with the life of Christ how does it start you start with declaration of independence I'm going to be free from my temper I'm going to be free from greed I'm going to free from lust I'm going to be free from fear I'm going to be free you have to start by knowing that you are declaring I independent we're independent from that I was bought with a price I have a loan to somebody else I'm not my own I can't fight for myself I can't forgive myself I can't do anything by getting you myself I need somebody to do it for me amen I'm living off of someone else's life that's what we're doing today Church now I'm closing I'm goes about let me bring this back bring around full circle back to Washington Yorktown was the battle that changed everything and finished the American Revolution that's where we stood right there right by the trenches and watched his map gotta I got to run up him Lydia we ran out of the trenches and it was quite quite inspiring before Yorktown Washington had not won a victory for four years can you imagine coming to church and not having somebody heat him for four years not having somebody saved for four years what was it was testing time the arm had to go through tests they started question there's a lot of persecution on George Washington a lot of things we write in the papers is this I'm really on the leader we've met for years without the victory we've seen the devil whisper into hell you said you want to be free you should just give up can't you see how churches we can never give up on God's premise no matter how low it gets no matter how many losses you have in a row if you're still here there's still victory praise God there's still the promise of victory for us history says George Washington in Yorktown was the first one to build the trench and for six days there was a four of British that we're getting any help for six days they built trenched after trench after trench closer and closer and so they could overcome this floor to Yorktown of the British and that's what turned the whole thing and he was the first one to put that hammer in there and that shovel and start digging and everybody followed him he said this is a direct quote persons whose duty does not call them to the trenches and who assemble there merely to indulge in curiosity are not to walk I'm sorry hard to walk on the reverse of the trenches that they may not enter up the works another short question said if you're not up here in the front lines digging the trenches you secure on the other side so you get hit by the bullets praise God what are the trenches the trenches are the hardest work let's roll the sled is right let's run the lane where that's where the sore backs are and George Washington said if you're not going to get up here digging the trenches he said go stay on the other side George Washington said this as well as the beautiful quote at the short tip before the valley said the present moment will decide American independence and the glory and superiority of the Allies he could recognize this is the moment we've got to be free and we've got the labor to do it honey no no ma'am huh no the Bible says you if you want the kingdom of God you got to press into it Severino that jesus said
