[38:58] amen I thank God for you pray as I'm
[39:01] staying let us turn about the grace of
[39:04] God to first Kings 18 which God there
[39:18] in that scripture is going to read by
[39:22] God's grace beginning at the 33rd verse
[39:25] we kind of rehearsed a little bit of
[39:27] sales I fuel off a little bit on it
[39:29] earlier this morning body large and mom
[39:34] karma showdown yes and here it says in
[39:37] the 33rd version he put the wood in in
[39:39] Auto and cut the bullocks and pieces and
[39:42] laid him on the wood and said filled
[39:44] four barrels with water and pour it on
[39:47] the burnt sacrifice and on the wood now
[39:49] remember force to them yes and he said
[39:52] do it the second time and they did it
[39:54] the second time and he said to do it the
[39:56] third time and they did it the third
[39:58] time and the water ran the round about
[40:00] the altar and he filled the trench also
[40:03] recorder and it came to pass at the
[40:05] times of the offering of the evening
[40:07] sacrifice that in light of the Prophet
[40:10] came near and said Lord God of Abraham
[40:11] Isaac and Israel excuse me let it be
[40:16] known as David now I got in Israel and
[40:18] that I am the servant is that I've done
[40:21] all these things that that word hear me
[40:25] o Lord hear me that is this people may
[40:27] know that thou art the Lord God and that
[40:30] thou has turned their hearts back again
[40:32] now remember he's turning the hearts of
[40:34] the children that I had he mentioned the
[40:37] worship of the truth and a living God
[40:39] yeah I just basically said Lord I have
[40:42] said I have done I have done all these
[40:45] things you showed me you told me so that
[40:48] has not he lies his plan this is God's
[40:50] plan
[40:50] amen amen so we understand that his
[40:53] showdown was God showdown yeah it was
[40:56] God versus the devil hey my heart versus
[40:59] failed that's right right image show but
[41:02] we realized how gracious God he feels
[41:04] the stretch he does it a third time and
[41:06] today I like to say Lord do it again
[41:09] because amen it is it is here where the
[41:13] Bible tells us listen he says the 37
[41:15] first hear me o Lord hear me that this
[41:17] people may know that there are the Lord
[41:19] God and thou has turned their hearts
[41:23] gain then the fire of the Lord fell so
[41:27] their heart had been turned back to gain
[41:30] by the word and the instruction of
[41:32] Elijah right hand has been the fire fill
[41:35] right
[41:37] the fire was Hall with all that
[41:40] beautiful beautiful right and assume the
[41:44] burnt offering and the second would
[41:46] choose me and the wood in the stones and
[41:49] the dust is linked up all the water that
[41:52] was in the trench and when the people
[41:54] saw it they fell of their faces and they
[41:57] said the Lord he is God
[42:00] the Lord he is God it is I just said
[42:04] unto them watch this town take the
[42:07] promise of bail and not not one of them
[42:10] escape hello remember it doesn't take a
[42:16] lot of our era if I want to say like
[42:20] that to be for you too I'll be a
[42:23] minister of the devil
[42:24] right right right because this is all
[42:28] Satan had to do was turn one bird
[42:31] changed one word to God word not you put
[42:38] not there right and he became an enemy
[42:41] to God
[42:42] and if they take away you becoming in it
[42:46] is right and when all the people saw
[42:49] there's they'll see because what thing
[42:51] this is what I love off the Lord to me
[42:54] to me let me finish the scripture and as
[42:55] I said take a prize avail let not one of
[42:58] them escape and they took them and
[43:00] Eliezer brought them down to the brook
[43:02] up keshon and smooth fill there one more
[43:06] scripture please yeah we just go let's
[43:14] go to Exodus Street brings and Exodus 3
[43:17] are starting at the seventh verse we
[43:21] won't be long this evening by God's
[43:23] grace but but I want you to get to see I
[43:27] want you to really see that that come
[43:30] God is not interested in um a rituals
[43:33] right you know he whom the son
[43:36] is set free is free indeed and where the
[43:38] Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty
[43:40] and God is not interested in rituals
[43:43] right even though do you like you know
[43:46] truth and you may follow those truth to
[43:48] the tee or to the letter but when you
[43:51] lose love for the truth it becomes a
[43:53] ritual and so you've got to learn how to
[43:56] give your all to that what you know see
[43:59] that's what pleases God
[44:01] this is even in Exodus the 3rd chapter
[44:03] says and the Lord said I have surely
[44:05] seen the affliction of my people which
[44:07] are in Egypt and have heard their cry by
[44:10] reason of their taskmasters for I know
[44:13] their souls and I have come down to
[44:16] deliver them out of the hand of
[44:18] Egyptians and to bring them up out of
[44:20] the land unto a goodly land in a large
[44:22] up to a land flowing with milk and honey
[44:25] unto the place of the Canaanites the
[44:27] Hittites the Emirati paradise and
[44:30] Hittites and the Gemini's now therefore
[44:32] behold the cry of the children of Israel
[44:35] coming to me and I have also seen the
[44:38] oppression which is just impress them
[44:40] come down therefore and I was sitting
[44:42] there to Pharaoh that thou made rain for
[44:45] my people the children of Israel out of
[44:47] Egypt and Moses said unto God Who am I I
[44:51] love that question I love that you know
[44:54] because before you can ever know who God
[44:56] is you must come to know who you are
[44:57] right once you are asked Who am I not
[45:01] given tell you right you never know who
[45:04] you are until you question God Who am I
[45:09] see because the world right now is
[45:12] looking they don't know who they are
[45:14] only the people who question God who out
[45:16] lie God they can respond right Moses
[45:21] said Who am i right behold excuse me uh
[45:27] uh and God said unto Moses let me let me
[45:33] back up I lost money when I come in to
[45:40] Childress your shop excuse me where was
[45:42] I the elders and Moses said unto God Who
[45:45] am I that I should go unto Pharaoh
[45:48] that I should bring forth the children
[45:49] of Israel out of Egypt and he says
[45:51] suddenly I would be with thee and this
[45:54] shall be a token of the tea that I have
[45:56] set thee with all have brought the forth
[45:58] the children out of Egypt you should
[46:00] serve the God upon this mountain see
[46:02] there was a plea that God want to be
[46:03] served and that was the only place at
[46:05] that time that they could serve God was
[46:08] upon that particular mountain yeah right
[46:10] and Moses editor dr. hall when I come
[46:14] into the children of Israel it says to
[46:15] them the god of your father have sent me
[46:18] unto you and they shall say to me what
[46:20] is his name what shall I say unto them
[46:23] and God said unto Moses I am that I am
[46:26] and he said thus shalt thou say to the
[46:29] children of Israel I am have sent me
[46:32] unto you
[46:33] now if you understand that Jim because a
[46:37] brother mind when I was a layman
[46:40] he had never been to the voice of God
[46:42] not a just a field and as he passed
[46:46] people on the street he was asking them
[46:48] do you know when the voice of God is and
[46:57] he was wondering what people was looking
[46:58] at the strangeness and it just Donald to
[47:02] them is they don't know that there's a
[47:03] building called the voice of God he is
[47:06] looking quite crazy right see that's
[47:11] just how things go people you don't
[47:13] understand what's out there but never
[47:16] the last thing that we laughed about it
[47:17] and I said see that's that's exactly
[47:20] right with what people don't understand
[47:22] the question they don't know how to
[47:24] answer it right and sometimes you'll
[47:28] question they look it's like your sanity
[47:31] but there's a reality behind it because
[47:33] there is a face right so anyway they
[47:38] asked Moses listen what think about it
[47:42] Moses comes with him and they say well
[47:44] who sent you he said on who shall I tell
[47:46] oh oh Sydney and he says go to him and
[47:49] tell him I am sent me tip it to Pharaoh
[47:54] he couldn't come for him that
[47:57] I am sit you who is I am but see they
[48:02] didn't understand it was I am Moses
[48:05] because Moses was the one bringing the
[48:08] message and was that I am speaking out
[48:12] of Moses right
[48:14] so they look right in the face of God
[48:16] and believe you mean at that time Moses
[48:20] was the face of God right and if Moses
[48:23] was the face of God then what face do
[48:25] you have okay see what you must have
[48:29] we got to come up we got to come up into
[48:32] it around where you must understand that
[48:35] you are becoming God and God is becoming
[48:38] you and wherever you go you are here to
[48:42] declare that God is just like Moses see
[48:47] it doesn't stay with a prophet the
[48:49] people of Israel supposed to have the
[48:51] same testimony and they say oh God
[48:53] all of them did except choice when Kayla
[48:56] they were the only two that could be
[48:58] glad that Jehovah was real right okay
[49:01] let's hurry up living alone see and
[49:04] Moses says I am that I am and he said
[49:07] duh says I'll save the children of
[49:09] Israel I am sent me unto you you know
[49:12] why God said that I am that I am because
[49:15] God can be whoever he wants to be right
[49:18] I am was in Joshua I am was emotions I
[49:22] am challah living was in Caleb I am was
[49:24] in t I am whatever remember even even
[49:29] even in the day of Pentecost when he
[49:30] said this is that right because we can
[49:34] come back that disc is right it was God
[49:37] becoming what that now the I am cake
[49:41] became 120 on the day of Pentecost I
[49:46] want you to see come sing if you don't
[49:49] see your face you she's all right you
[49:52] see for the bad news base everybody know
[49:53] he's the seventh angel what about the
[49:55] bride brother man said the movies on the
[49:59] bride so what is she doing
[50:01] who is she hey let's see somebody and
[50:05] she's here
[50:07] and she's declaring the same god oh we
[50:11] get so excited when you say okay Elijah
[50:13] Elijah supposed to get a double poster
[50:15] I've got a portion of what you're
[50:19] supposed to have a ministry we have a
[50:22] ministry and it's the same I am that
[50:25] stuck into Moses supposed to step into
[50:28] you it's normal we don't have times in
[50:32] the fall backward the bride moves oh it
[50:35] she must move forward right and god
[50:38] Shannon will always oppose it thus shalt
[50:40] thou say unto the children of Israel the
[50:42] Lord God of your father the God of
[50:44] Abraham the god of Isaac and the God of
[50:46] Jacob shall have just sent me have sent
[50:49] me unto you this is my name forever and
[50:52] this is my memorial to all generation
[50:55] hallelujah
[50:57] the I am right so let's pray father God
[51:01] we come before your Lord as humbly as we
[51:04] know how and we thank you for your
[51:05] greetings we thank you for your mercy we
[51:09] take your father for being so good to us
[51:11] Lord you have been a bell to us that
[51:16] we've been to ourselves lord I pray that
[51:18] you bless the people help them not help
[51:21] us that we may see the truth of who we
[51:24] are because if we can see who we are
[51:27] your prophets saying Lord that we will
[51:30] become an invincible I help us now that
[51:34] we may spy ourselves in the scripture in
[51:37] Jesus Christ's name we pray you make me
[51:41] see that as we see this you show up well
[51:46] why I was brother Branham preach God in
[51:48] warfare huh he preaches that and he
[51:52] tells us that God mask himself yes yes
[51:55] though how can the bride be there
[51:58] at the white throne judgment as a judge
[52:05] it comes throughout all the ages she
[52:08] held the word yes right hey man is that
[52:11] right because remember now when Jesus
[52:14] went down into the region of the law he
[52:18] asked the question why did not
[52:21] believe my word they could have easily
[52:24] said what we never seen you before but
[52:26] he could have said I am was in Noah I
[52:31] was in North and Noah preached my word
[52:35] 300 was my face
[52:37] no was my say no it was my word and you
[52:41] didn't hear it right in any see it was
[52:45] Jesus Christ God himself ignore
[52:48] preaching to Don in the days of the
[52:51] intermediate world that's right brother
[52:53] Amen right and now God is in well kiss
[52:56] me oh yeah reaching to the world and
[53:01] they will be without excuse
[53:04] yes sir why do you say one word or not
[53:07] God has fixed this world in such a place
[53:10] that specially our women when they walk
[53:12] the streets everybody no gay man yeah
[53:17] but they know this out of your name yes
[53:21] sir yes sir
[53:23] don't you wanna meet this so a literally
[53:26] a living word really and Ray that's
[53:31] vital yes all me Laurie and that's what
[53:35] people do they look at you and they read
[53:37] you aim at a man right so you can
[53:41] understand me what when I'm gone with
[53:43] this because I'm trying to tell us this
[53:47] Jesus had to find his place in the
[53:49] scriptures that the Bible yes the Bible
[53:52] said he came to know who he was by the
[53:53] word yes and when he ran away he saw
[53:57] himself did he the word became one
[54:01] that's what we must tell brother panel
[54:05] did not bring all these powerful quotes
[54:07] about the bride just to make our money
[54:10] of some kind of a sensation there's
[54:12] gotta be a people that can not only uh
[54:16] swallow it but digest it all right
[54:20] gloria
[54:21] right so what do you say I'm trying to
[54:24] say difficult what we have done even in
[54:27] this message because of our approach
[54:31] people go because they're with me
[54:34] because I said this before you might not
[54:38] agree with that time but I really
[54:40] believe that where we got off is when we
[54:43] we took the gospel of Jesus Christ
[54:45] and we made it God sent a prophet right
[54:48] right
[54:49] find me in the scripture anywhere in it
[54:51] in a historical fact with a they stop
[54:54] preaching Jesus Christ and start
[54:57] preaching the Prophet right yes sir it's
[55:01] not their people right if it wasn't that
[55:04] it wasn't a part of the scoop to get box
[55:06] when brother Branham lived on earth in
[55:09] the flesh it was all right to say come
[55:11] see you later
[55:12] right right but who can you say come see
[55:15] now that's right brother young fella I'm
[55:18] trying to say not taking away from that
[55:20] gear I'm not taking away
[55:21] it meant from God sends a property
[55:24] because they needed to know that the
[55:26] voice of a prophet was in the land yes
[55:29] right but now listen what John said he
[55:32] said I'm a decrease that he might like
[55:34] increase so the revelation of John's
[55:37] voice because John has the Holy Ghost so
[55:41] as John preached it wasn't John creature
[55:43] it was a Holy Ghost in a John creature
[55:46] and right so when John ministry was
[55:48] earthly finished Jesus came out of the
[55:52] scene now the voice of God was who Jesus
[55:56] himself a man yeah I don't you must
[55:59] understand that when the Prophet dog he
[56:02] preached he preached it but he left
[56:04] unwrap it the voice of God
[56:07] hey man glory
[56:11] am I making sense yes sir
[56:14] because if you can see what I'm trying
[56:16] to tell you an angle that's the Lord
[56:19] help it is because I know how when you
[56:21] when you a pretty much program to hear
[56:23] it stains a certain way you're very
[56:25] cautious on how is here if somebody
[56:28] bring something a little different but
[56:30] I'm not I'm really telling you the way
[56:32] it should have been right right man what
[56:34] has happened is that people have fallen
[56:35] in love with the Prophet and they love
[56:37] Jesus alone right yes sir yes sir
[56:41] right brother you know and that's what
[56:44] I'm trying to tell you we go with oh oh
[56:46] oh
[56:47] if I was in Nevada that's I'm invited
[56:50] Jesus was hot I would have been there I
[56:52] would have been there but let me tell
[56:54] you something all those religious people
[56:56] believed in the law believed in hoses
[57:00] and when they looked at Jesus he became
[57:02] trash that's exactly what a lot of
[57:05] people in this message do when you see a
[57:08] come to a church and they're really
[57:09] excited about the word that praising God
[57:12] and in washing his feet
[57:14] they called them what Pentecostal and
[57:16] when they said when they said they say
[57:19] it in a way like that's trash
[57:21] all right brother right right hello yes
[57:24] sir now if you don't think that God will
[57:27] not judge people for doing that because
[57:29] he judged brother Branham yeah for
[57:32] greeting with his mother-in-law that's
[57:35] right that's right and he lost his wife
[57:38] and his daughter yes sir I guess what
[57:41] his wife told him will you know what
[57:44] these days are happening and the Holy
[57:47] Spirit has already told him over hi Oh
[57:49] River when he was going over getting
[57:51] ready to go over the waterfall
[57:52] what he had done love remember when you
[57:56] call those people trash he said Lord how
[57:58] did he call him trash my mother-in-law
[58:00] called trash you see them saying but he
[58:03] agreed because he did resist what she
[58:05] said I not a stand against silence is a
[58:09] yes right belly right see and he did not
[58:13] go against her when he should have yes
[58:15] sir
[58:16] am I making sense yes so what I'm trying
[58:18] to tell her tell you is that listen I
[58:21] want you I want you to encourage you
[58:23] read your books listen to the cake read
[58:26] your Bible but you need to stay quiet
[58:28] you can hear from God ah amen glory it
[58:36] must become a personal hear me yes of
[58:39] course that must be personal
[58:42] I'll tell you the truth there are times
[58:44] when I wake up in the morning I said
[58:45] lord give me something that can take me
[58:48] through the day and the Lord said turn
[58:50] this on and so and so it'll be just what
[58:54] I need for the day hey mad key if you
[58:57] talk to him like he's a person that's
[58:59] what brother branham said he said that
[59:00] was the
[59:01] they're friends you must know God as a
[59:04] person and not a fig yes glory
[59:07] hallelujah we're good if we would do for
[59:11] me if I prostrate myself before that
[59:13] picture there are people prostrating
[59:16] yourself before the cloud frustrated
[59:19] lord have mercy sitting they come down
[59:22] on the stretcher all right brother
[59:25] well you know God you know you can only
[59:27] bow before God
[59:28] that's right right hallelujah come on
[59:31] somebody in Anderson listen what Google
[59:35] said in all things he said for some
[59:37] people are trying to do something to
[59:40] look like somebody else or impersonate
[59:42] somebody else because they thought they
[59:45] did you see and I Lord I can't call
[59:49] these preachers names but we have
[59:50] renowned creatures in this message and
[59:52] when we have people who preaches just
[59:55] like these renowned creatures and we
[59:59] don't think that's about it we don't
[1:00:00] even see where it's wrong but as somehow
[1:00:03] an impersonation right brother right God
[1:00:07] hid them say they are impersonating a
[1:00:10] preacher because he's got it together
[1:00:12] God is telling and he can do it I can do
[1:00:15] it and I'm gonna impersonate the way he
[1:00:17] does it and I get the same result right
[1:00:20] brother right but we said and say
[1:00:23] hallelujah never say how y'all give me
[1:00:25] now I told somebody if I wanted a
[1:00:28] certain preacher to come preach in that
[1:00:30] church I would I was sin for that pitch
[1:00:32] I don't want to hear it right right yes
[1:00:40] because people is not right but we'll
[1:00:44] let it go on right because of the
[1:00:47] excitement in all of these days listen
[1:00:49] he said listen imprisoning somebody else
[1:00:51] because they thought they did and you
[1:00:53] see what it does it brings us back into
[1:00:55] a ritual and of all again right and I
[1:01:00] know for certain I've heard people
[1:01:03] saying you see how the way he preaches
[1:01:05] you see the way he that the style that
[1:01:08] he's doing it see so much like the way I
[1:01:10] bring the word
[1:01:13] god forbid then with the middle like
[1:01:16] John challenges just take it sword and
[1:01:19] slice dice all right right brother
[1:01:22] y'all make yogi what I'm saying you're
[1:01:24] not trying to get people to see it at
[1:01:27] all you're not going to make it to
[1:01:29] heaven being in my college right you're
[1:01:32] just not going to make de man I'm going
[1:01:35] to say that you won't make them the
[1:01:37] trials and the tribulations of the
[1:01:39] tribulations but you're not going to
[1:01:41] make bride because she's can't have one
[1:01:42] spot that's right my understanding her
[1:01:45] revelation of the God she served must be
[1:01:47] pure and clean a man it has to be high
[1:01:53] and you you cha cha Chi God could
[1:01:57] entrust things to darling your type of
[1:01:58] the jar nothing to miss it this down
[1:02:01] because John understood things that a
[1:02:04] lot of the other decide many others
[1:02:06] David because you always made it
[1:02:08] official
[1:02:09] man yes sir T and the message the real
[1:02:12] pride Jesus Christ
[1:02:13] she don't know who to love him right
[1:02:19] Jesus listen what he says I shall feel
[1:02:22] that I spilled it out to a spill it out
[1:02:24] to the sin God said that he hides
[1:02:27] let me thirty back up and you see what
[1:02:30] it does is bring foot back into a
[1:02:31] religious form again is the blood is the
[1:02:35] blood the light that electrifies and
[1:02:39] sanctifies your life that's right I just
[1:02:42] filled it out this it said God said that
[1:02:47] he's hiding his face from your prayers
[1:02:49] you've got your ritualistic form yes it
[1:02:53] is the truth you're doing what he told
[1:02:56] you but you're not doing it in sincerity
[1:02:59] and use fall out day and night but God
[1:03:03] said your sacrifice is a stick to me and
[1:03:06] I will not receive it any more when you
[1:03:08] pray under such condition I hide my face
[1:03:12] from you God don't want your always time
[1:03:16] to pray yeah but what do you do when you
[1:03:19] pray all right amen
[1:03:21] it's just something that your mom
[1:03:23] quickly for God when I did my our prayer
[1:03:26] and I'm okay I let me tell you something
[1:03:31] if you're praying and watching your
[1:03:33] watch you're not talking to God right
[1:03:35] brother right amen you're just wasting
[1:03:38] your words yes sir because when you talk
[1:03:42] to God hallelujah you internship because
[1:03:44] I would say some prayers a travel when
[1:03:47] you get into prayer you travel in that
[1:03:49] threat and you lose sight of time
[1:03:53] hallelujah I can tell you O God by His
[1:03:56] grace have called out got in the breath
[1:03:58] and when I get a lot of reps we also
[1:04:01] ball has already gone that didn't do it
[1:04:05] so prayer is where you go in and you
[1:04:08] travel God take you places in prayer
[1:04:11] that you know he knows when you when you
[1:04:14] down there just being on ritual you
[1:04:16] might as well studied all father's
[1:04:17] prayer he ended up with a period she
[1:04:19] parted route today because i'ma tell you
[1:04:21] something this ritual thing that
[1:04:23] everybody is doing yourself what brother
[1:04:25] who's a kid he would ever tell you
[1:04:26] something if it wasn't ritualistic you
[1:04:30] would not see the people the way they
[1:04:32] dress changing
[1:04:34] that's right brother ain't Maddox amen
[1:04:36] huh because that will hold when style if
[1:04:40] all the fashion comes meaning right

[1:05:42] enjoy being a Christian
[1:05:43] yes I'm not oh no I gotta be a to
[1:05:47] another day oh I love yes Hey so I named
[1:05:53] God's grace when he introduced himself
[1:05:55] to Abraham he said I'm the god away from
[1:05:57] him
[1:05:58] I'll shoot a wing introduce yourself the
[1:06:00] moment he said I'm the carburetor
[1:06:01] I'm the car without it I'm the god of
[1:06:03] pickup but it's trying to shove off I
[1:06:05] know about you all right
[1:06:08] so you must realize in an hour telling
[1:06:10] us a lot of you today I said when we get
[1:06:13] to heaven they're gonna be our galoshes
[1:06:15] up there which one will be the right one
[1:06:20] if you want something real I responded
[1:06:23] to worship
[1:06:26] aside ready knock down a bit if he gets
[1:06:30] the supper saw in the right hand I'm
[1:06:32] here then how can he be God and I start
[1:06:35] is right here that's right brother right
[1:06:38] no God help stop in his hand all right
[1:06:43] Amanda he's a father God like you a part
[1:06:46] of God yeah yeah yeah okay a mess God do
[1:06:51] it again but how he's gonna do it again
[1:06:54] we must charge back to Jesus Lord I in
[1:06:57] here so click - that's a wild lady he's
[1:07:02] been glorifying the ride right right
[1:07:07] somebody all the pride is this the bride
[1:07:10] is that the bride is this that's all
[1:07:12] right but can we how did she become that
[1:07:16] didn't accomplish she is by herself
[1:07:18] take me to Calgary holy gosh
[1:07:25] oh my god sake who says hopefully for
[1:07:29] thought hey glory Jesus said listen I
[1:07:34] will receive my own glory and I'm not
[1:07:37] interested in your glory he's making
[1:07:39] telling those people he said God ha ha
[1:07:42] he will give me the global yes but this
[1:07:47] is what I love about st. John 17th his
[1:07:49] father let me have that same Lord that I
[1:07:52] had you with you from the beginning and
[1:07:56] you know what he tells us that he gives
[1:07:58] his glory to us now how he gives his
[1:08:01] glory to us is that when he feels us
[1:08:02] with this Holy Ghost then we become him
[1:08:06] here to come us right yeah he became our
[1:08:10] sin that we might become his
[1:08:11] righteousness and that glory that we
[1:08:14] have with them in the beginning now
[1:08:16] shows up because now the whole Bible
[1:08:20] said that God of the creation is waiting
[1:08:22] but the manifestation say waiting and
[1:08:27] groaning for the sons of God hey man if
[1:08:32] they have to be better texture the
[1:08:34] understanding that's what the whole
[1:08:36] creation is wrong before the
[1:08:38] manifestations of the sons of God why
[1:08:40] because the creation know that they will
[1:08:43] have a revival once we have a revival is
[1:08:47] because the fall of the creation came
[1:08:50] out of the fall of late that's right
[1:08:52] amen really caused by not the thought is
[1:08:56] restored we will cause it to live a game
[1:08:59] a whole face would be new reading if you
[1:09:05] want to say like that because we take a
[1:09:09] position as the Lord oh the earth again
[1:09:12] a mad is that ok Laura all throughout

[1:12:43] doctor said I had cancer and if you went
[1:12:45] through all this nonsense and all of a
[1:12:48] sudden my wife said to me we were eating

[1:13:37] took a shell ahead and then when she
[1:13:39] said I had big cash it I had but God
[1:13:41] said no oh so you think about those
[1:13:46] things now what if I had listened to the
[1:13:48] doctor and the doctor was using
[1:13:50] great early folks he gave me options
[1:13:52] before he told me there was no cancer
[1:13:54] he will give me options of the operation
[1:13:57] if I had said okay I choose this one
[1:13:59] don't you know that man was gonna
[1:14:00] operate on me you know he knew the
[1:14:02] cancer was gone

[1:14:22] mommy not all doctors but how you gonna
[1:14:28] trust them you gotta trust God permits
[1:14:30] for a man oh yes you gotta trust God in
[1:14:32] this to the ratio and sir you better
[1:14:33] trust God yes sir because just like it's
[1:14:36] just a few of us listen if I said as it
[1:14:38] was in the days of North as it was in
[1:14:40] the days of lot this is still only a few
[1:14:42] say and everything else for serpents did
[1:14:48] you see it that's right walking with
[1:14:50] you've got a thoroughbred gals out there
[1:14:55] alright if God seed is coming to it
[1:14:58] purity is too far but devil is coming to
[1:15:02] his cure for the field whatever and to
[1:15:04] Thor
[1:15:04] alright now you gonna trust God not how
[1:15:07] can you not trust God in the day ooh
[1:15:10] think about what I just said listen
[1:15:13] so we gone and he said listen God comes
[1:15:15] along and when he wanted Abraham to do
[1:15:17] something what did he do he gave Abraham
[1:15:20] part of his name a from Abraham huh
[1:15:24] because he's getting ready to show
[1:15:26] Abraham that your true healthy father is
[1:15:29] a father and so therefore you will be a
[1:15:31] father of many nations
[1:15:33] maybe worse wait for him guess what
[1:15:36] there was nothing that could stop the
[1:15:38] promises of elegant but God says if I
[1:15:41] was going to be he walk now we read
[1:15:45] about him right here
[1:15:46] but there are kinds of Abraham as a
[1:15:48] minute I have wondered about the things
[1:15:51] that God is talking God goes up he
[1:15:54] go right also go right he goes back
[1:15:56] there was so many times that Abraham's
[1:15:58] akima listen to what God said to write

[1:16:04] in trouble who came to deliver him I
[1:16:07] went you must be see well i'ma tell you
[1:16:10] something sometimes she'd even tell lies
[1:16:14] did I ever help sell a lot that's right
[1:16:16] right right what did he tell her I saw
[1:16:18] because he was afraid come on somebody
[1:16:22] and you don't you think about it and
[1:16:25] there was God protected him all the time
[1:16:27] why because God gave him an
[1:16:29] unconditional covenant
[1:16:31] hey man you'll say God protect you oh
[1:16:33] I'm so holier-than-thou the time because
[1:16:37] he gave you all today yes amen you know
[1:16:42] you're better than nobody else other
[1:16:44] than God gave us a promise yes sir
[1:16:48] for this call I also found my
[1:16:51] knees are to the father of our Lord
[1:16:53] Jesus Christ now - do you think that is
[1:16:55] a Miss Creek in the Bible he pause
[1:16:58] understood who he was worshiping yes -
[1:17:04] the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of
[1:17:07] whom the whole family in heaven and
[1:17:09] earth it made God don't worship you
[1:17:14] but I do rush up the dog that's in you
[1:17:16] that's right amen

[1:17:20] you I'm giving honor to the God that's
[1:17:23] in you but I respect you
[1:17:25] I'm respecting the God that's in you
[1:17:28] know what I'm saying
[1:17:29] you know get up like you've heard
[1:17:31] people say when Jesus arrived into
[1:17:33] Jerusalem that donkey was just so proud
[1:17:36] all they just screaming at me whoo the
[1:17:43] donkey got confused that's how I'm
[1:17:47] screaming for the donkey right right and
[1:17:51] then when Jesus got off the donkey there
[1:17:54] was no more screaming in all of that and
[1:17:56] he says all monies and stop spirits at
[1:17:58] every time you Jesus leave you that's
[1:18:00] what happens
[1:18:06] oh it's right in it yes sir
[1:18:40] hey man they wouldn't let me live who
[1:18:44] peed okay but I'm just trying to bring
[1:18:50] the reality if the brother branham who
[1:18:53] was the greatest preacher of our any
[1:18:55] could be so humble right
[1:18:59] so meek and so lowly Oh that's what I
[1:19:02] love about him y'all see me now hey

[1:19:10] man he did he laughed he played joking
[1:19:13] on him saying he was ready he went some
[1:19:16] scholar some stuck-up selling you know

[1:19:31] but I like yes oh I don't feel so bad
[1:19:36] you know I know God told me for the
[1:19:39] seals you got they gotta be more

[1:19:47] agree you got to be more consecrated
[1:19:50] always yes sir our of consecration may
[1:19:52] God help me see if we look at this
[1:19:54] thing's all brother what are you trying
[1:19:56] to say what I'm trying to say is that if
[1:19:59] you are you
[1:19:59] 94 Christ you ought to act like you're
[1:20:02] not United with Christ right man let me
[1:20:05] ask you a question and I know this might
[1:20:07] sound strange
[1:20:08] what is Rebecca she left
[1:20:14] ELISA with the camera trained what if
[1:20:17] she would win it - Isaac's chant she's
[1:20:21] oh that Eloisa is something Oh
[1:20:30] Eloisa so either Ella eat all the things
[1:20:36] that he told me le either told me by now
[1:20:39] how do you think I do feel that in his
[1:20:44] presence all you talked about with him
[1:20:46] that's right really right now how did
[1:20:49] you take God feel that in his presence
[1:20:52] all you think talk about his dealings
[1:20:54] right brother right see what I'm saying
[1:20:57] it's simple it's right there in the bar
[1:20:59] yes yes and he was one to do something
[1:21:04] I'm getting I've got a study I'm working
[1:21:06] on here come the bride because you find
[1:21:08] out that the man that introduced the
[1:21:10] prior to his husband uh uh you know he
[1:21:13] moves out of the way yes yes right once
[1:21:18] the father and we're and mr. father dr.
[1:21:21] gospel for us and when he moves out of
[1:21:23] the way yeah buddy you got seen the show
[1:21:27] now is on the bride and the bridegroom
[1:21:30] is right he goes and he takes you see
[1:21:34] y'all you know say yes because now we
[1:21:37] don't belong to him anymore we have now
[1:21:40] been given over and that's what Paul
[1:21:42] saying he said I fear lest you be to God
[1:21:44] like et boss
[1:21:46] Yeah right but I feel fearful because
[1:21:51] I'm afraid you want to be seduced like
[1:21:54] is a eight loss amen yes I see what was
[1:21:59] it does he it happened that she was the
[1:22:02] power because she believed one word that
[1:22:04] wasn't right that's right right then who
[1:22:10] was the preacher
[1:22:11] serpent the devil hmm
[1:22:15] impulses you've got to be careful now
[1:22:17] because this gelatin that transformed
[1:22:19] himself into light
[1:22:20] let me case something I personally I
[1:22:24] don't have nothing to do with preachers
[1:22:26] in this message who's against the Holy
[1:22:28] Ghost right brother right no well that's
[1:22:34] too much emotions you don't just I had a
[1:22:37] brother tell me ah maybe basically
[1:22:40] separated me from him because he said
[1:22:42] you know what for the books you know you
[1:22:44] preach the Holy Ghost like people gotta
[1:22:46] have all those emotions and you know you
[1:22:48] you to put too much emphasis on only
[1:22:49] emotions and I thought yeah I do you
[1:22:55] know what and it's going to ever forever
[1:22:56] be that way ma because the early church
[1:23:00] started on with emotions yes sir yes got
[1:23:03] the Holy Ghost we will never know that
[1:23:05] they jumped out of widows and ran down
[1:23:07] the street screaming he's alive he's
[1:23:09] alive and let it set for the bedroom
[1:23:10] told us and that right right brother I
[1:23:12] ain't you don't react on discrete cities
[1:23:15] pop you talk about emotions how many of
[1:23:18] us been filled with old ago so much we
[1:23:20] jumping out windows right brother right
[1:23:23] yo heal them say yeah nothing took place

[1:23:26] with trunk with no why
[1:23:28] hey what is concealed they were acting
[1:23:32] out normal yeah right yeah yes and let
[1:23:37] me tell you something I guess I come
[1:23:39] from the old school

[1:23:43] brother ramjet at the time of that
[1:23:44] baptism God would gift in the Holy Ghost
[1:23:47] right baby but you know what a lot of
[1:23:49] people don't know what the in
[1:23:51] right brother hopefully now explains a
[1:23:54] tour that's right we never told him what
[1:23:58] we business only in their minds and no
[1:24:00] they thinking they were pissing from
[1:24:01] just these little things but what about
[1:24:03] all the stuff that's locked in your
[1:24:04] sub-conscience

[1:24:26] yourself that's right that's right
[1:24:28] brother but people don't get it and so
[1:24:30] as you go along in this message you hear
[1:24:33] a little something here there's
[1:24:34] something there
[1:24:34] Oh Lord forgive me I'm so sorry so you
[1:24:36] make up forevers a pity you for every
[1:24:38] pity for every kitchen and all of that
[1:24:40] stuff but if you had known at the
[1:24:43] beginning you could have made it one
[1:24:44] shot one time at the altar right right
[1:24:48] giving it out to God one time y'all hear
[1:24:53] what I'm saying
[1:24:54] yes sir yes sir and it's not the
[1:24:56] people's fault is the preachers fault
[1:24:57] right brother how many times you've
[1:25:00] heard of necessary repent and be
[1:25:02] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:25:04] the remission of your sins you know why

[1:25:19] same as ever watch they should make an
[1:25:21] altar call how many I'm gonna let win

[1:25:27] people right when the last you've been
[1:25:29] broken right brother right know himself
[1:25:32] what is it that keeps us from Wheaton
[1:25:33] before the Lord yes sir you know just
[1:25:36] that spirit they say is to pillock also
[1:25:39] to something to something and then we've
[1:25:42] sometimes build up a conflict like it's
[1:25:44] wrong right I don't care what y'all
[1:25:47] think I look like I could look like a
[1:25:48] monkey in distress amen I when I cry I
[1:25:51] cry you don't say right yeah whoopee but
[1:25:55] this is my soul and that's the way you
[1:25:57] got to look at it this is goes all right
[1:26:00] I don't know you got yes sure
[1:26:06] David well oh lord please don't let me
[1:26:10] be one of those that follow Moses and
[1:26:12] didn't get the revelation that was what
[1:26:15] was happening with Moses don't let me
[1:26:17] follow this message and not north of God
[1:26:18] that's it the message right I need to
[1:26:21] know him he knows me but I need to know
[1:26:24] him
[1:26:26] then a display don't let these people
[1:26:29] think because you look look these
[1:26:30] scriptures and know what brother branham
[1:26:32] said you go go speaking through the city
[1:26:34] hallelujah God told Nicodemus you must
[1:26:37] be born again that's right I have it
[1:26:41] amen is that right yes I can explain to
[1:26:44] you now my son though he doesn't say
[1:26:46] anything when we were we were in the
[1:26:48] belly of the mother when I use this all
[1:26:50] the time in my mother's womb I didn't
[1:26:52] need my hands I didn't heed my eyes I
[1:26:54] didn't eat my mouth I didn't even on of
[1:26:56] these facilities that I have not why
[1:26:58] because she was my mouth she fed me she
[1:27:00] was my hand she was my feet
[1:27:02] she did everything for me she used her
[1:27:04] body for me I they see right in that
[1:27:07] world but I was fooled I was being
[1:27:10] formed and shaped for the world to come
[1:27:12] hell you don't say because in this world
[1:27:15] I leave in my hands I needed my eyes I
[1:27:17] needed my mouth and it's a palette that
[1:27:19] I needed yes
[1:27:21] while I was your network in my mother's
[1:27:23] womb I didn't need them what do you
[1:27:28] think that God killed tells Nicodemus
[1:27:30] you must be born again
[1:27:32] cuz flesh and blood with knowledge into
[1:27:34] the kingdom really things that we have
[1:27:37] will not be of no use
[1:27:39] yes you don't need that we won't be
[1:27:42] working by the sweat of our brow
[1:27:45] everything that we dominica mean by the
[1:27:48] word that's what will happen we will be
[1:27:52] the spoken word really Brendan said this
[1:27:55] rod has potential to actually speak a
[1:27:58] word in existence and go literally right
[1:28:00] better right
[1:28:02] hallelujah and then one brother said it
[1:28:04] to brother Brendan said listen let me
[1:28:06] ask you something do you really think
[1:28:08] that all those people are not at God
[1:28:10] going to be able nerve the problem said
[1:28:14] Guardians sitting will live on earth he
[1:28:17] said God and made worlds and world and
[1:28:19] moons and move
[1:28:20] he's got all kind of universes in
[1:28:22] everything said oh god I'm one was
[1:28:27] waiting for me don't look at me crazy
[1:28:31] but I know I got something up there
[1:28:35] let me ask you one derstand if he's
[1:28:39] calling us to be creators here what do
[1:28:41] you think you gonna be there right
[1:28:44] right really if you will be your real
[1:28:47] you will catch a stock and you'll know
[1:28:50] exactly what he wants is everybody
[1:28:53] yes that's why I was said that the prime
[1:28:55] knows what to do with the word we know
[1:28:58] his thoughts let me ask you each a
[1:29:00] another thought so you can understand
[1:29:02] how Adam was able to make those animals
[1:29:05] one unforseen correctly cuz adam had a
[1:29:08] mind of his creator
[1:29:10] yes yeah what's the creator's line those
[1:29:14] animals and what Nathan a man right
[1:29:18] that's all he could do it
[1:29:22] see oh yeah if we could just see what
[1:29:27] God is taking on we got to stop being
[1:29:30] just me
[1:29:30] oh no I'm just I'm really keen on this
[1:29:33] number on this no I'm a southern god I'm
[1:29:36] being created in the image and likeness
[1:29:37] of God I'm learning how to speak the
[1:29:40] word in existence is that right amen yes
[1:29:44] young I don't play with God but I would
[1:29:50] tell you something a brother told me one
[1:29:53] time he said brother in Arizona he's a
[1:29:55] brother he's at one time I was late and
[1:29:57] God told me I was working late at night
[1:29:59] he won the speed he said and I had all
[1:30:01] these traffic lights in my way and he
[1:30:04] said God told me to speak to that life
[1:30:05] so every time you come up to the traffic
[1:30:07] light you say change and he did anything
[1:30:12] so one day I add that situation
[1:30:15] commitment I said order nothing true I
[1:30:18] just use it just the other day I'm
[1:30:20] drinking I said chainé chainé hallelujah
[1:30:26] I was inspired to do it I did and it
[1:30:29] worked
[1:30:30] amen it wasn't me it was God inspired me
[1:30:34] what I'm trying to say isn't that true
[1:30:36] you got some of the baby boys in the
[1:30:38] baby girl and you stand amongst it come
[1:30:40] on sweetie you can do it you can do it
[1:30:43] because this is them that they have the
[1:30:46] ability to walk right by are you say to
[1:30:50] UM the baby says ah you know cause it's
[1:30:54] hard for them to say daddy they always
[1:30:55] say mama firs right a daddy because well
[1:30:59] they say mama I think it is and anyway
[1:31:01] you said say daddy you're teaching them
[1:31:05] because you know what they nearly have
[1:31:07] the ability to talk so you teach them to
[1:31:10] pretty daddy and then they watch your
[1:31:13] mouth and watch how you say it and it
[1:31:14] was then all of a sudden when you're not
[1:31:16] thinking is it dad because now they
[1:31:19] start to do it on their own
[1:31:22] right now lelou you say that ain't God
[1:31:28] it is God because Jesus had already told
[1:31:31] his disciples how to speak to her and
[1:31:33] when that storm came on the sea and they
[1:31:36] ran to him and say father lot either
[1:31:38] cast out laughter we carriage house he

[1:35:18] right I'm still not gonna be well just
[1:35:19] give me a few more minutes and he says
[1:35:21] now these are now Romans 8:1 says there
[1:35:23] is now no condemnation to fill that are
[1:35:27] in Christ Jesus who walk not after the
[1:35:28] flesh but after the spirit and people
[1:35:32] think that because I see if you got the
[1:35:36] Holy Ghost that don't mean you don't
[1:35:37] make a mistake you do talk but God said
[1:35:41] even in your failure there is no
[1:35:42] condemnation did you know that that's
[1:35:45] what that scripture say yes huh why
[1:35:50] because the Holy Ghost come to get rid
[1:35:52] of your guilt conscience yes yes is that
[1:35:56] right
[1:35:57] see that blood that Debo's and avulsion
[1:35:59] it all right they couldn't get rid of
[1:36:01] the book because there was no
[1:36:02] compatibility with animals and humans
[1:36:05] yes but when Jesus came
[1:36:08] his blood was compatible him and he into
[1:36:11] yours out anyhow and twitter's only you
[1:36:13] a man therefore there is no condemnation
[1:36:16] you don't have to be condemned or the
[1:36:20] off that you have in your fresh cuz
[1:36:22] Jesus took care of it all yeah man y'all
[1:36:27] just a me let me ask you a question when
[1:36:29] you get on O death day and say you stop
[1:36:33] putting up your record of all your
[1:36:35] failures how do you gonna resist him if
[1:36:38] you don't know that you have been
[1:36:40] completely justified you gotta have this
[1:36:45] message to whip the devil at your time
[1:36:47] of death because the denomination's they
[1:36:50] make it worse this message makes his
[1:36:53] Grace and you make sure right so you can
[1:36:57] whip the devil by the Lord when he try
[1:36:59] to condemn you
[1:37:00] oh you tell him I'm free and he whom the
[1:37:03] Sun sets free is free indeed I'm free
[1:37:06] because of the blood of Jesus Christ

[1:39:04] are counted a new creature but they are
[1:39:06] dead to the things of the world there
[1:39:08] live in him

[1:39:12] film day by day he lives in them through
[1:39:16] every age every age that comes along

[1:39:22] requirements Oh God right who comes into
[1:39:27] that place to where he provides in his

[1:57:36] yes not let you go I will just jump down
[1:57:40] is where I want to go to paragraph 257
[1:57:43] is to see you said like on Mount
[1:57:45] Transfiguration all the prophets and
[1:57:49] everything else is finished all the days
[1:57:53] of the luqman you can understand that
[1:57:55] cover all the days of America this we
[1:57:57] can understand they didn't hear all of
[1:57:59] the Presbyterians we can understand but
[1:58:01] we can understand this part all the all
[1:58:04] the prophet and everything else is
[1:58:05] distended we can't understand never we
[1:58:07] can understand the Lutheran the
[1:58:09] Methodist of the Presbyterians you know
[1:58:10] that they things boom but she prevention
[1:58:15] is there all right he said they're all
[1:58:18] right this is my beloved here to him the
[1:58:21] word of this hour the word of the seals
[1:58:24] with all the mystery
[1:58:26] garland that's been here all these years
[1:58:27] bill is he's a Great Pyramid of Pi we're
[1:58:31] streaking off he's at the headstone
[1:58:33] making home down so that the star David
[1:58:36] was settled into his place and in the
[1:58:39] great Church of the Living God will be
[1:58:42] raised like the wings of an eagle has
[1:58:44] out yonder into the glory and what
[1:58:47] people don't understand is that until
[1:58:49] the product yes in place Israel cannot
[1:58:52] get in place yes your honor I mean we
[1:58:57] watch it Israel but we must understand
[1:58:59] the bride must be going Israel gets in
[1:59:02] place right so she can't give it place
[1:59:05] until we get it big the star then it
[1:59:08] cannot sell down in Israel and the real
[1:59:11] cat with the period and going out of
[1:59:14] here all right
[1:59:16] once you Israel all he won't you but the
[1:59:18] bride must come to what she's supposed
[1:59:20] to be before Israel can make the next
[1:59:22] move right
[1:59:24] hey madness is that okay yes she effect
[1:59:28] which means if you go back you're on the
[1:59:30] island authority the charge will come
[1:59:32] through this is uh this is another quote
[1:59:34] uh when I'm ending it here the church
[1:59:40] will come to justification to lose them
[1:59:44] truce education through Wesley through
[1:59:47] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:59:49] Pentecostals and go right on into
[1:59:52] perfection of the son of man listen that
[1:59:56] we need husband and wife will be the
[2:00:00] same self person God would be so
[2:00:03] manifested in his bride his church till
[2:00:06] they will be the same they are one how
[2:00:11] now now you see will react see what I'm
[2:00:15] saying he said this is what you gotta
[2:00:16] understand this is your goal this is
[2:00:18] your objective this is your press this
[2:00:20] is what you you pushing impressing to
[2:00:22] become seeing the son of man so much in
[2:00:24] you which is Christ in you the hope of
[2:00:26] glory to you in Christ
[2:00:28] of what yes not potentially in reality
[2:00:32] yes he's up the Lord
[2:00:37] I hope you did get something for what
[2:00:38] was preached because we're Westing on
[2:00:41] his promises you and I can't bring these
[2:00:43] thing to pass but because he has spoken
[2:00:45] these thing God himself through Jesus
[2:00:47] Christ amen
[2:00:49] has spoken these things and you and I we
[2:00:53] cannot come back bored
[2:00:54] but what they the Lord show me enclosing
[2:00:56] some prophecies will get settled me but
[2:01:00] different people how long even know who
[2:01:01] they are to this day but I would say
[2:01:05] well if it happens it just happens and
[2:01:10] that's it that's the wrong attitude when
[2:01:14] Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive
[2:01:17] everybody's winning in Great
[2:01:18] Expectations waiting for the promises
[2:01:23] and add hundreds of years before Christ
[2:01:27] ever came to the temple and there was
[2:01:30] only the rest I'm waiting that's right
[2:01:33] right see we suppose with the prophecy
[2:01:36] together we supposed to wait with
[2:01:38] expectation watch we're supposed to pray
[2:01:41] and look for the Hathaway in us yes Amen
[2:01:45] right so you and I must take this word
[2:01:47] and say okay this is all of the things
[2:01:49] that were said about the bride of Jesus
[2:01:51] bride I'm kind of looking at watch Lord
[2:01:53] let this happen Lord let this happen
[2:01:55] Lord let this be in me let this be me
[2:01:57] you asking God right to let the word
[2:02:00] that was spoken be found manifested in
[2:02:03] you yeah cuz you be needed a man marry
[2:02:08] when the never had Jesus if she didn't
[2:02:10] would have believed the angel that's
[2:02:12] right brother right but she can't
[2:02:13] believe the prophecy of an angel amen
[2:02:16] right look what happened to Zechariah
[2:02:18] when he didn't believe now I made him
[2:02:21] dumb that's right that's right that's
[2:02:23] right
[2:02:23] so God expect us to believe the
[2:02:25] prophecies and look with expectation for
[2:02:28] the prophecy to be manifested in us we
[2:02:31] don't have to rule them there you live
[2:02:33] in Jerusalem that the prophecy must come
[2:02:36] forth in and through and by yeah God hey
[2:02:39] man I'm done folks
[2:02:41] I hope you bit less yes I tried to pull
[2:02:44] my heart out to you you know English
[2:02:47] words I wish I knew another language to
[2:02:49] talk to you
[2:02:49] I'm so so confound by by the English
[2:02:53] language that's all that go but I still
[2:02:59] feel so compelled I feel like there's
[2:03:02] more to it and in let's say God there's
[2:03:05] more to it it's too short of a word and
[2:03:12] then it convenient anything I just can't
[2:03:14] stand it up with I can't how to wait
[2:03:16] till we get that original language that
[2:03:18] can spread God the way I won't whatever
[2:03:20] it is I believe that the English press
[2:03:23] colleagues actually the way I want to it
[2:03:25] you'll know it and I'm loading would be
[2:03:27] glorious folk art is so real hey man
[2:03:33] he's real people loving with all your
[2:03:36] heart yes G we all fall short but
[2:03:39] understand God said there's no
[2:03:41] condemnation that those who walk not
[2:03:42] after the flesh we try to walk after the
[2:03:46] spirit and you understand when God is in
[2:03:47] you there's no condemnation
[2:03:48] how can he come him you if he's living
[2:03:50] in right he's already approved you you
[2:03:54] don't wait for a second from he's
[2:03:56] already approved you ain't mad please
[2:04:00] God listed our Lord Jesus Jesus G where
[2:04:28] this hey
