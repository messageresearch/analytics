[28:59] foreign
[29:01] [Music]
[29:08] great to be here in the house of the
[29:10] Lord
[29:11] you know I came out here because I
[29:13] didn't want to miss singing I didn't
[29:14] want to miss worshiping the Lord and now
[29:17] I was worshiping the Lord I got all my
[29:19] nerves out a lot of the nerves out so I
[29:22] want to thank the Lord for that
[29:24] praise the Lord
[29:27] I just want to come here before you guys
[29:28] I'm just your brother I'm the one
[29:30] special so I just want to share what the
[29:32] Lord has placed on my heart and
[29:34] hopefully they'll hopefully the Lord
[29:36] will speak to your heart as he did to me
[29:41] you know I there's an analogy I always
[29:43] thought of um
[29:45] you know when a Woman Cooks their food
[29:47] they take so long it takes like an hour
[29:50] or two just to cook a meal just to enjoy
[29:52] like five to ten minutes of good food
[29:54] and I feel like that's the same with our
[29:56] pastor he prepares days after days weeks
[29:59] after weeks hours after hours just to
[30:01] prepare an hour an hour and a half
[30:03] serving for us to enjoy the good word of
[30:05] God and I pray that you would enjoy this
[30:07] word too
[30:09] let's take our Bibles today
[30:11] and I would like to turn to Psalms 62 5.
[30:23] for all their semen
[30:36] well the Lord put this on my heart today
[30:39] as I had this um
[30:42] this topic on my mind for about three or
[30:45] four weeks and
[30:46] God's been building upon my
[30:48] understanding of it so let's read the
[30:50] work together
[30:51] one two three
[30:52] my soul wait thou only upon God for my
[30:57] expectation is from him
[31:00] amen you guys all may have a seat
[31:04] so my topic today is expectation
[31:10] so okay
[31:15] you know lately sometimes at church I
[31:17] come to church and sometimes I don't
[31:20] expect much from God I get used to this
[31:23] kind of routine we had going to church
[31:25] enjoying the ministry go home repeat
[31:28] same thing
[31:30] and I'm learning that
[31:32] you know I have been lacking in my
[31:35] expectation from the Lord and we
[31:37] shouldn't let Church become common to us
[31:40] you know it's great we have our pastor
[31:43] but treat Church treat God like a
[31:45] marriage you don't get bored of your
[31:47] spouse do you do you get bored of your
[31:49] wife or your husband you know if you
[31:51] guys get bored of that you guys try to
[31:52] find a new love try to
[31:55] um make things fall in love again you
[31:57] know start all start with that falling
[31:59] in love going on dates you know that's
[32:01] the same thing with God you know we come
[32:03] to church we shouldn't be bored of
[32:04] church you should come to church to
[32:06] expect to commune with the Lord God
[32:08] wants to have fellowship with you God
[32:11] wants you to come expecting him to talk
[32:13] to you for him to meet your need so
[32:16] let's not forget why we come to church
[32:17] in the first place we come to church
[32:19] because we want to see God I want to see
[32:21] God I know you guys want to see the Lord
[32:23] too and sometimes we place Fellowship
[32:26] over God you know we enjoy each other's
[32:29] company that's great but that's not the
[32:31] reason why you come to church we came to
[32:34] church because God is here we want to
[32:36] see the Living God God changed our lives
[32:39] we must not forget that he's done it all
[32:41] it's great we have our pastor he brought
[32:44] us to the Lord helped us fall in love
[32:46] with the God but it was God who drew our
[32:48] hearts to him
[32:50] let's look in the word what did Jesus
[32:52] say about this Matthew 22 37.
[32:56] and Jesus said unto him thou shall love
[32:59] the Lord thy God with all thy heart and
[33:02] with all thy soul and with all thy mind
[33:04] this is the first and great commandment
[33:06] and the second is like this thou shall
[33:08] love thy neighbor as thyself
[33:10] what is Jesus saying the first thing you
[33:12] should do is love the Lord that's
[33:14] priority number one second priority
[33:17] would be your fellowship of your
[33:19] neighbor the people here at church
[33:23] and I know a lot of times we get
[33:25] confused about what's the lord's will
[33:27] for my life what does God want for my
[33:29] life the one thing you are constantly
[33:31] assure of is God's will is that he wants
[33:34] to have fellowship with you daily
[33:36] communion with you that's his will
[33:39] that's one thing you can always fall
[33:41] back on you don't know what God wants in
[33:42] your life God wants to fellowship with
[33:44] you he wants to commune with you
[33:47] okay so let me ask you so what is our
[33:50] expectation when we come to church what
[33:53] are we expecting when we come here
[33:55] are we expecting the fellowship with God
[33:57] or are we expecting to enjoy the company
[34:00] of other people after service
[34:02] you know did you put nothing into the
[34:04] service you get nothing out of it
[34:06] you know you reap what you sow if you
[34:08] want to see God pull on the word
[34:11] ask the Lord that he would move in this
[34:13] service and he will give it to you he
[34:15] will meet your need if you come to
[34:17] expect him
[34:18] so let's look at an example Mark 25 Mark
[34:21] 5 25. I think everyone knows this story
[34:24] about the woman with the blood issue
[34:30] I'm just going to read right here and a
[34:33] certain woman which had an issue of
[34:35] blood 12 years and has suffered many
[34:37] things of many Physicians and has spent
[34:40] all she had and nothing better but
[34:42] rather grew worse
[34:44] and when she heard of Jesus came in the
[34:46] Pressed behind and touched His Garment
[34:48] for she said if I may touch but his
[34:51] clothes I shall be made whole
[34:55] and I will skip down to
[34:57] 34. and he said unto your daughter thy
[35:01] faith had made thee whole go in peace
[35:03] and be whole
[35:04] of thy plague
[35:08] so I want to um the word expectation I
[35:11] want to compare it to another word that
[35:12] we we often forget and that is
[35:14] confidence when you have expectation
[35:17] you're also confident at the same time
[35:19] and you you can see the example of the
[35:22] woman was confident that if she just
[35:23] touched Jesus she would be healed well
[35:26] what kind of confidence do we have today
[35:28] do we have that same confidence that if
[35:31] we touch the Lord today that he would
[35:33] meet our needs today
[35:34] and let's look at there's a quote from
[35:37] Brother Branham I was listening to I'm
[35:39] not much of a corporation but
[35:42] let's this is from expectation 1950.
[35:46] I'm just going to read it and we'll go
[35:48] from there
[35:51] I'm expecting that to be there I'm
[35:53] expecting God when I'm praying in the
[35:55] room a few moments ago before entering
[35:57] the building seemed like something came
[35:59] over me that said something what's going
[36:01] to happen here tonight a great
[36:03] spontaneous healing I'm expecting that
[36:06] I will eventually say this to you
[36:08] pastors you will find out that at least
[36:10] 60 to 80 percent of every sick person in
[36:12] this building will be healed in the next
[36:14] hour
[36:15] see if that isn't right you can grab me
[36:17] a false prophet I know that when I'm
[36:20] speaking of that's right that is a lot
[36:22] of confidence in the Lord that he that
[36:25] God's gonna answer him and heal him of
[36:27] heal the people of their needs
[36:30] it's also looking confidence first John
[36:32] 5 14.
[36:34] and this is the confidence that we have
[36:36] in him that if we ask anything according
[36:38] to his will he will hear us
[36:41] and also Hebrews 10 35 cast not away
[36:45] therefore your confidence which had
[36:47] great recompense of reward go before the
[36:50] Lord with boldness you know you don't
[36:52] demand things from God I know that but
[36:54] you can be both before him like you go
[36:56] before your spouse you know
[36:58] you know force your spouse to go buy you
[37:00] something you ask your spouse and it'll
[37:03] be up to her if she wants to give it to
[37:04] you or not you know that's the same
[37:05] approach you're confident that your
[37:07] spouse will listen to you and that will
[37:09] take your needs in consideration and
[37:11] once he finds or finds a time to do it
[37:13] she'll do it or he'll do it that's the
[37:15] same approach with the Lord God wants to
[37:17] make sure you have your needs in that
[37:19] today he wants to make sure your needs
[37:21] are met
[37:22] yes so how confident are you that God
[37:25] can move in the service right now I
[37:28] believe all my heart that our Lord can
[37:30] can move in this service today I'm not
[37:33] talking about Wednesday I'm not talking
[37:35] about next week I'm talking about today
[37:37] and it doesn't matter who's preaching
[37:39] I'm I'm not anybody special but it
[37:42] matters that if you want to meet God
[37:43] today you can meet God today
[37:47] so there's there's a thing that
[37:49] sometimes we struggle with and that is
[37:51] doubt let's read on it on James 1 6.
[38:00] but let him ask in faith nothing
[38:02] wavering for he that waver if it's like
[38:05] a wave in the sea driven with the wind
[38:07] and tossed let not a man think that he
[38:10] shall receive anything of the Lord
[38:12] for a double-minded man it's unstable in
[38:14] his ways
[38:16] you know I want to bring this
[38:18] uh this thought of Doubt up
[38:23] you know what the Lord's been showing me
[38:24] that you know you can't control what
[38:27] comes in your mind right it only comes
[38:29] in comes out and it's up to you if you
[38:31] want to entertain that thought if you
[38:33] want to accept that thought of doubt
[38:35] and you know what you have the power the
[38:38] authority to cast that doubt from your
[38:41] mind if you want to believe something
[38:43] and you feel that doubt come up you can
[38:45] say nope I'm returning that back to the
[38:46] sender I'm believing the word of God you
[38:49] can turn that doubt away
[38:51] let me tell you when I got the Holy
[38:53] Ghost
[38:54] I was right here at the end of service
[38:56] everyone was gone
[38:57] and I was looking at this TV right here
[38:59] and I have so many doubts I heard the
[39:02] Devil tell me you'll get the Holy Ghost
[39:03] next week you'll get the Holy Ghost the
[39:06] next service when Pastor Jesse is here
[39:08] and you know what I told the devil no
[39:10] I'm not leaving until I get the Holy
[39:12] Ghost today
[39:14] I am getting it today and I went to
[39:16] Brother Simon's room and we prayed here
[39:18] and I got the Holy Ghost today so you
[39:20] have the you have confident confidence
[39:22] in God that he will answer your prayers
[39:24] and you can cast your doubts away if you
[39:27] have any doubts that come through for
[39:28] you
[39:33] okay
[39:36] another good another good Bible verse uh
[39:38] Genesis 32 26.
[39:41] I always look at this one
[39:43] a lot
[39:45] because this literally happened to me
[39:47] when Pastor Jesse you were testifying
[39:49] about brother dicks about that woman who
[39:52] had their hand up and brother Dix went
[39:53] and grabbed their hand that literally
[39:56] happened to me too the exact same thing
[39:58] so let's read Genesis 32 26.
[40:05] and he said let me go for the day
[40:07] breakth and he said I will not let thee
[40:10] go except thou bless me amen
[40:14] came and preached I stood over here
[40:16] everyone was gone besides me and my wife
[40:18] and I was praying right here on my knees
[40:20] I'm like God I want the exact same thing
[40:22] that happened to me that happened to
[40:24] that woman who had their hands touched
[40:25] that God confirmed that confirmed
[40:28] something of her need I'm like Lord I
[40:29] just wanted for you to touch me right
[40:31] here right now and I'm not leaving until
[40:33] you touch me that's how Bulldog was and
[40:36] a few minutes later my wife comes and
[40:37] turns around and she puts her hand up
[40:39] behind my back and that presence was the
[40:42] exact same presence I felt when I got
[40:43] the Holy Ghost it was like a three a
[40:46] hand that was three times the size of
[40:47] her hand and I felt that I'm like wow
[40:49] the Lord answered my prayer because I
[40:52] told the Lord I was not gonna leave
[40:54] until you blessed me and he let that
[40:56] come to pass
[40:58] [Applause]
[41:00] okay
[41:01] so expectation I want to talk a little
[41:04] bit about faith so do you guys know how
[41:06] Faith actually operates it's not just
[41:09] believing
[41:10] okay so look let's look at Mark 11 24
[41:13] please
[41:23] therefore I say unto you what things so
[41:25] ever ye desire when I pray When you pray
[41:28] believe that you shall receive them and
[41:30] thou shall have them
[41:32] and Hebrews 11 1.
[41:43] now Faith is the substance of things
[41:45] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[41:48] Seen
[41:49] so I'm going to do a little analogy so
[41:51] say I have
[41:53] a hundred dollars yeah this is a hundred
[41:55] dollars say this is a hundred dollars
[41:56] and I had my wife come up here and she
[41:58] told me she wanted
[42:00] to buy
[42:02] a book
[42:03] okay
[42:04] so when I this is a hundred dollars
[42:07] when I give my wife a hundred dollars
[42:09] she does not have the book but she has
[42:12] the substance the faith to believe that
[42:14] she already has it she's not rejoice
[42:16] she's not rejoicing that she doesn't
[42:19] have the book but she's rejoicing
[42:20] because he has the money the purchasing
[42:22] power to receive what she wants that is
[42:25] the same thing with faith faith is an
[42:28] assurance of what you will get of what
[42:30] you hope for you don't rejoice in the
[42:32] hundred dollars you get but eventually
[42:35] you I want to see her holding the book
[42:37] that she wanted not the hundred dollars
[42:39] if you hold a hundred dollars there's
[42:41] something wrong with that you gotta put
[42:43] that faith into use use that money that
[42:46] Faith you get been given and use it to
[42:48] buy what you need go before the Lord and
[42:52] ask the Lord of what you need you know
[42:54] God has a spiritual economy up in heaven
[42:56] you know we have a economy here where we
[42:58] exchange everything with money well
[43:00] God's money is this
[43:02] the word of God
[43:04] the truth the promises of God this is
[43:07] God's currency when you need something
[43:09] you go before the Lord you find that
[43:12] Bible verse that you have in need of and
[43:14] you read it you believe it you obey it
[43:17] and God's or God is obligated to fulfill
[43:22] that promise in your life
[43:24] so every time you come to church you
[43:26] hear the truth of God that is like God
[43:28] throwing you free money that's what it
[43:30] is God's giving you money money now you
[43:33] gotta take that money and go do
[43:35] something with it if you want to buy a
[43:37] car you take that money you invest you
[43:39] wait until you get more money or get
[43:41] more faith and then when you're ready to
[43:43] receive that car you go out and purchase
[43:45] it you go out to them that sell it
[43:50] Hallelujah
[43:52] okay so there's for with faith there's
[43:54] three parts to Faith number one
[43:57] is your belief so what you are believing
[44:00] is not in yourself but you are Believing
[44:02] on who God is
[44:04] there's two qualities that God has that
[44:08] we should be we should have faith in
[44:09] first is God's Integrity let's read
[44:13] numbers 23 19.
[44:24] numbers 23 19. God is not a man that he
[44:28] should lie neither the son of man that
[44:30] he should repent he have said and shall
[44:33] not he do it and or he has spoken and
[44:36] shall he not be made good
[44:39] do you believe that God is a good being
[44:42] that God is a god of love of Good
[44:45] Intentions for you
[44:47] that's what that's what it means to
[44:49] believe in God's Integrity that what he
[44:52] says he does is not it's not like
[44:55] you can believe someone said this like
[44:58] say I believe Jesus said if
[45:00] you move them out if you have faithful
[45:02] emergency you can move a mountain I
[45:03] believe Jesus said that but doesn't mean
[45:05] that I believe that he can do it that's
[45:07] two different things
[45:08] so you first you want to believe that
[45:11] God has good intentions for your life
[45:12] that he's a god of Integrity everything
[45:15] in the Bible can you show me did he fail
[45:18] once he never failed once everything
[45:20] always came to pass according to his
[45:22] word according to it as well that's how
[45:24] you can trust God God is not a liar he
[45:27] will fulfill what he promised the second
[45:31] the second quality of God
[45:33] is this integrity and his ability to
[45:36] perform many people have good intentions
[45:40] but they can't perform it
[45:42] let's let's take this an example say I
[45:45] see a homeless guy on the street I have
[45:47] good intentions that I want to help them
[45:49] out but I don't have any money on me my
[45:52] intentions are good but I don't have the
[45:54] ability to perform it but that's not God
[45:56] God has good intentions and he has the
[45:59] power to perform what you need
[46:01] God can do both
[46:03] let's look at Ephesians 3 11.
[46:08] now unto him that is able to do
[46:11] exceedingly abundantly above all that we
[46:15] ask of or think according to the power
[46:17] that worketh in US
[46:20] praise the Lord
[46:21] faith is not just believing but it's
[46:24] also a part of
[46:26] it's part of the process like we're
[46:27] saying so first part is your belief your
[46:30] conviction on who God is
[46:33] God is a loving God second
[46:36] thing about faith is you have to find in
[46:40] scripture God's promise for your life
[46:42] God's promises are conditional it's
[46:45] always if if if do this and then this
[46:48] will happen do this and that will happen
[46:52] and once you find a scripture
[46:55] that pertains to your situation you make
[46:57] sure you obey it
[46:59] and then the third thing is you walk in
[47:01] the channel until you receive it so
[47:04] that's that's a three-step process in
[47:06] faith faith is not just believing faith
[47:08] is believing
[47:10] obeying and staying in the channel until
[47:12] you receive it
[47:14] a good analogy is Peter walking on the
[47:17] water right disciples on the waving sea
[47:20] the first thing Peter saw was Jesus and
[47:23] he said what Lord if that be you come
[47:26] come visit me to walk in the water yes
[47:28] what did Peter do he was convicted that
[47:31] that was Jesus right I know the second
[47:34] thing find the conditional promise what
[47:36] did Jesus say come
[47:38] so Peter all he had to do was obey he
[47:41] didn't have to consult his disciples all
[47:43] he did was just step out on the water
[47:46] and started walking towards Jesus
[47:50] and he the third part is to stay in the
[47:53] channel till you receive it and he got
[47:55] so close to Jesus right which Jesus was
[47:57] able to grab him right
[47:59] so that's the same thing but the the
[48:01] wonderful thing is when Peter went and
[48:03] he fell he was looking at the waves the
[48:06] wind and he started ground drowning the
[48:08] wonderful thing about it is it's not
[48:11] your responsibility it's God's
[48:12] responsibility to save you because you
[48:14] obey
[48:16] you you did what he told you to do you
[48:19] obeyed his conditional promise you
[48:21] walked out you followed the Lord and
[48:23] when you were right at the right spot
[48:24] when you were sinking God saved you God
[48:27] rescued you
[48:30] that is faith
[48:32] amen
[48:34] and God will also reward you if you
[48:36] desire to fellowship with him let's go
[48:38] at Hebrews 11 6.
[48:48] but without faith it is impossible to
[48:51] please him for he that cometh to God
[48:53] must believe that he is and that he is
[48:56] the rewarder of them that diligently
[48:58] seek him
[49:01] you know I'm gonna go back to the top of
[49:03] expectation
[49:04] you know expectation Falls with
[49:06] confidence and also follows with faith
[49:09] do we have the faith to believe that God
[49:11] can commune with us today
[49:13] I believe he can
[49:17] you know I always thought you know
[49:20] when I read listen to brother branham's
[49:22] sermons I'm always
[49:25] kind of get like a little jealousy a
[49:28] little bit about it because I'm like
[49:29] yeah I was I was in those days I wish
[49:32] that could happen right now why why did
[49:35] I miss out on it you know I wasn't born
[49:36] yet you know but you know what Jesus is
[49:40] the same yesterday today and forever
[49:42] he can do what he did in brother
[49:44] branham's day to this day
[49:46] you know I always think about you know
[49:48] sometimes
[49:50] people don't believe that it's possible
[49:51] like what brother bran had it doesn't
[49:54] pertain to our day you know that's the
[49:56] same equivalent of you saying the days
[49:58] of Miracles have passed you know it does
[50:00] not it Jesus does not change
[50:03] you know what he had back then we can
[50:06] have it right now and this is the
[50:08] groundwork to start going into the right
[50:10] direction into the restoration you know
[50:13] we want to go back to the book of Acts
[50:15] and this is the way to do it as come
[50:17] expecting that God can move in this
[50:20] midst in this church service
[50:23] and God did promise he will meet you
[50:26] let's look at Jeremiah 29.
[50:28] uh verse 12 and 13.
[50:40] then Xiao ye call upon me and shall go
[50:43] and pray unto me and I will hearken unto
[50:46] you
[50:47] and ye sound seek me and find me and ye
[50:51] shall search for me with all your heart
[50:53] the God not promise that he will meet
[50:56] you if you search for him
[50:58] Deuteronomy 4 29.
[51:01] but if from thence thou shall seek the
[51:03] Lord thy God Thou shalt find him if thou
[51:06] seek him with all thy heart and with all
[51:08] thy soul
[51:09] I believe he could come to this service
[51:12] and we can seek the Lord and we will
[51:14] find him here
[51:16] you know and
[51:18] now while we're going this topic you
[51:20] know
[51:21] we want to go back to the book of Acts
[51:23] and
[51:24] you know we have to understand we are
[51:26] not alone in this and if we all desire
[51:29] the same thing we can all pull on God
[51:31] and it gives a greater anointing a
[51:34] greater God's there to hear you because
[51:36] it's not just your faith and alone it's
[51:38] everyone's Faith who wants to believe in
[51:40] the same thing
[51:41] because they were all in one Accord and
[51:43] they were all expecting the Holy Ghost
[51:45] to fall they didn't know what it was how
[51:47] it was going to happen they all just
[51:48] knew it was going to happen if we all
[51:51] come in that one if we all come into
[51:53] that same mindset every service just
[51:55] saying God I just want to see you move
[51:57] Lord I don't know what's going to happen
[51:58] I don't know what's gonna what's gonna
[52:01] happen how it's gonna happen but I just
[52:03] want you to move I just want to see you
[52:05] move I just want to see the Living God I
[52:07] don't want to see a God that's just the
[52:10] history that people know I want to see a
[52:12] God that's moving in our lives in our
[52:14] midst
[52:15] [Applause]
[52:18] now at the discussion we always hear all
[52:20] the time Matthew's 18 20 for where two
[52:23] or three are gathered together in my
[52:25] name there am I in the midst of them how
[52:28] many believe that
[52:30] I know I hear that a lot and yeah I
[52:32] believe it you know
[52:33] but God's saying
[52:35] you know how real how much do you
[52:37] actually believe this
[52:39] because if you really believe this it's
[52:41] going to come to pass
[52:43] you know uh
[52:48] let's think about let's go on a topic of
[52:50] unity like if you think about a football
[52:52] team you got one if imagine if you're
[52:55] the only player on that team you're not
[52:57] gonna win
[52:58] you need everybody and not just
[53:01] everybody you need a good team a good
[53:03] team with one mind one Accord
[53:06] one Spirit under the Lord Jesus Christ
[53:08] and like how Pastor Jesse said earlier
[53:11] today we're on a winning team that
[53:12] cannot lose that's right
[53:16] it comes halftime we're still winning it
[53:18] comes third quarter fourth quarter we
[53:20] are still winning I love that
[53:23] amen
[53:25] sorry I I didn't preach long I'm about
[53:27] to close sorry but I believe God will
[53:30] restore everything he's already
[53:32] restoring it now but now we have to take
[53:35] our part and walk back to it
[53:37] so let's take the first step today
[53:40] by coming with expectations
[53:45] okay I'm gonna close so it was all stand
[53:47] up sorry
[53:49] a short sermon but I pray that it would
[53:51] reach your heart
[53:56] I want to close with this one example
[53:58] you know sometimes we come to church and
[54:00] then we leave out we go home and
[54:03] you know sometimes we like talk to our
[54:05] spouse and whatever and
[54:07] I kind of get caught in this wake where
[54:09] it's like you know God moved mightily
[54:11] today at church do you see that brother
[54:13] he got his prayer answer you know what
[54:16] God's saying what about you did God meet
[54:18] your need
[54:19] think about it when the Rapture happens
[54:21] are you going to be sitting here
[54:22] watching that brother be like praise the
[54:25] Lord You're Going To The Rapture what
[54:27] about you
[54:28] God wants you to be in it God wants you
[54:31] to participate God Wants You on the
[54:33] altar he wants you to come before him
[54:35] God promised that if you seek him you
[54:39] will find him
[54:40] God promised if you want him tonight you
[54:43] want him here you can have it if you
[54:45] want the Holy Ghost you obeyed God will
[54:47] give it to you God will give it to you
[54:49] whether God say yes or no wait he will
[54:52] tell you if you wait on the Lord if you
[54:55] ask the Lord you come in confidence be
[54:57] bold like Jacob Lord I'm not leaving
[54:59] until you answer my prayer Lord I'm not
[55:01] leaving until I get an answer
[55:03] be confident God loves you God wants to
[55:06] meet your need
[55:09] amen so now can I kind of come up here
[55:11] all right um on the piano can you play a
[55:13] song um only believe
[55:15] I love that song
[55:20] as we um pray
[55:22] as we pray I want to give you guys an
[55:25] opportunity
[55:27] to commune with the Lord
[55:31] I think that's the most important thing
[55:33] after the service is communing with the
[55:36] Lord
[55:38] talk with the Lord Make It Personal
[55:41] it says between you and God
[55:44] God I have a need today and I need it to
